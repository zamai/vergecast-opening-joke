00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,170
Speaker ?:  Welcome to the Verge Cast, the flagship podcast of

3
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,890
Speaker ?:  Twitter competitors. I'm your friend Alex Kranz. And today

4
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,610
Speaker ?:  we're starting a mini-series called Solo Acts, which will feature interviews

5
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,850
Speaker ?:  from people who work independently to create great things on the internet.

6
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,450
Speaker ?:  Most of the time we talk about tech in terms of a handful of big gigantic

7
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,370
Speaker ?:  companies like Meta, Twitter, Netflix, all of those

8
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,650
Speaker ?:  guys. But some of the most interesting stuff we find online is the product

9
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,610
Speaker ?:  of a single person. Sometimes even in their spare time in this series,

10
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,010
Speaker ?:  we'll get to know these people, the tech they use to get stuff done and the

11
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,530
Speaker ?:  obstacles they face trying to compete with the Giants. So for the next five

12
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,410
Speaker ?:  Mondays on the Vergecast, our friend Ashley Escada will be curating

13
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,250
Speaker ?:  and hosting these interviews and sharing with us what she's learned. Hello

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,210
Speaker ?:  Ashley. I have to learn something You've hopefully learned. I'm

15
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,490
Speaker ?:  gonna be learning stuff. I feel like you've learned a lot. I have. I really

16
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,850
Speaker ?:  have. These people are all so fascinating and delightful. Really.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,610
Speaker ?:  You've Done a, a bunch of these interviews so far today. We're talking

18
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,330
Speaker ?:  to, you're talking to the folks at Hive? Yes, I am talking

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,250
Speaker ?:  to the founder of Hive Social, Roca Pop,

20
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,850
Speaker ?:  otherwise known as Cassandra Pop sometimes she goes by Cassandra

21
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,970
Speaker ?:  and she is a person who launched

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,010
Speaker ?:  a social media platform because she did not see the

23
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,530
Speaker ?:  social media she wanted to see in the world. Yes. She

24
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,330
Speaker ?:  decided to launch that when she was, she decided to learn to code and launch

25
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,610
Speaker ?:  a social media site at 19. Wow. So that's pretty amazing.

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,690
Speaker ?:  That is super amazing. And Hive, I feel like we talked about a lot

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,490
Speaker ?:  in those early days of the Twitter implosion. It got a lot of followers

28
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,370
Speaker ?:  then. Yeah, shortly after Elon Musk took over Twitter,

29
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,170
Speaker ?:  there was sort of an, I call it a pseudo exodus

30
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,650
Speaker ?:  because I feel like we're all still on Twitter. Yeah. I was like, I'm still

31
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,010
Speaker ?:  There. We're all still there. But everybody was kind of looking for

32
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,970
Speaker ?:  alternatives to at least try. And one of the ones that I had

33
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,850
Speaker ?:  stumbled upon amongst others was Hive Social. It feels like

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,010
Speaker ?:  a mixture of old school, MySpace, little, little

35
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,050
Speaker ?:  sprinkle of old school MySpace. Because you can set music

36
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,970
Speaker ?:  to your profile page Yes. To automatically play, which I know is like a feature

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,810
Speaker ?:  a whole bunch of people really liked, including myself. But it's also, you

38
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,770
Speaker ?:  know, you can post photos, you can post things that look like tweets. I

39
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,760
Speaker ?:  can just post text. And so it's kind of, you know, it kind of wants to

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,520
Speaker ?:  be a little bit of everything. Wants to give people a little bit of everything.

41
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,560
Speaker ?:  I mean I used it and then I stopped using it cuz it, it, it broke down a

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Speaker ?:  lot. But it sounds like when you only have one, one or two developers

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,880
Speaker ?:  it's a little more of a challenge. I think at the time of that massive influx

44
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,720
Speaker ?:  of users, they had three, three people working there. So

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,360
Speaker ?:  it's, there were definitely some challenges and Roka talks about that in

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,080
Speaker ?:  the interview. Oh, well let's just go to the interview then and in a little

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,480
Speaker ?:  bit. I'm gonna be back to ask you some more questions. All right.

48
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,600
Speaker ?:  Hika, thanks for being here today. Hi Ashley. Thank you for having

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,520
Speaker ?:  me. I'm really excited to be here. Well I am excited

50
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Speaker ?:  to talk to you because in the wake of some pretty big changes

51
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Speaker ?:  across some of the most popular social media apps, users seem

52
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,040
Speaker ?:  to be seeking alternatives that better suit their desired

53
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,600
Speaker ?:  experiences like more and more. And one of those competitors is

54
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,160
Speaker ?:  your app Hive Social Roka. Can you tell our

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,080
Speaker ?:  listeners a little bit more about what Hive Social is and

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,800
Speaker ?:  also how it started? So Hive Social is a social media

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,760
Speaker ?:  app that I self coded and developed beginning in the

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,440
Speaker ?:  later part of 2019. So I started to teach myself how to code

59
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,880
Speaker ?:  in June of 2019 and the very first version was launched in October

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,680
Speaker ?:  later that year. So that's how it started. I was still working

61
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,640
Speaker ?:  full-time and I was also in college full-time. So it was definitely

62
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,880
Speaker ?:  a crazy balance to, to try and maintain. I ended up bringing

63
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
Speaker ?:  a developer on and a designer just to help out because it was just

64
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,520
Speaker ?:  so much to try and do by myself from the UX design, doing that

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,480
Speaker ?:  by myself to the coding by myself. So definitely having extra hands helped

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,400
Speaker ?:  a lot. And then I know a lot of people frame Hive

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Speaker ?:  this competitor to Twitter now, but I think it's so much more

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,720
Speaker ?:  unique in a standalone app to just be a competitor in general because that's

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,520
Speaker ?:  why I ultimately made it. I just noticed that there was that downward market

70
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
Speaker ?:  trend with other apps and I wanted to fill that market demand. Now

71
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,920
Speaker ?:  just so everybody is aware of this, you, you started

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,080
Speaker ?:  learning how to code and you launched your very own social media

73
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,080
Speaker ?:  platform at 19 years old. Is that That's right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

74
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,320
Speaker ?:  Okay. I think some people would say including myself,

75
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,760
Speaker ?:  the audacity, the, the nerve, the the, it's just really

76
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,600
Speaker ?:  that is something to wake up one day and think to yourself,

77
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,720
Speaker ?:  I've had it with these social media sites, I'm just gonna make my own

78
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,360
Speaker ?:  w walk me through that thought process. I mean what, what prompted

79
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,160
Speaker ?:  you to do this? Well I actually started

80
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,400
Speaker ?:  noticing again that downward trend as a senior in high school.

81
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,200
Speaker ?:  But I hadn't started learning how to code or program or anything.

82
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,880
Speaker ?:  It was just something that I noticed that I started wishing that

83
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,160
Speaker ?:  certain apps had X, Y, Z and other people had similar

84
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,360
Speaker ?:  complaints and I was just waiting for that like next big social media app

85
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,160
Speaker ?:  that other people were also waiting for and I just got tired of waiting for

86
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,960
Speaker ?:  and was like, you know what? I might as well try and create my own. And so

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,840
Speaker ?:  I started very carefully looking through what exactly I wanted to be in

88
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,440
Speaker ?:  the app and I just went from there. And what do you think

89
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,560
Speaker ?:  feature-wise makes Hive unique or sets it apart from

90
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,520
Speaker ?:  other social media platforms that are out there right now? I think the customization

91
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,920
Speaker ?:  really sets it apart right now. Like you have your music feature that people

92
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,600
Speaker ?:  really love cuz you get to express your music taste in that way. And every,

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,040
Speaker ?:  every stream also counts towards your favorite artist

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,880
Speaker ?:  total for the year. You can do color themes, people love the Zodiac

95
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,280
Speaker ?:  science and the pronouns that they can have on the profile. I think the Discover

96
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,960
Speaker ?:  page is also super fun for people because you just get to find

97
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,960
Speaker ?:  all sorts of new content on there in your profile itself.

98
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,840
Speaker ?:  You can also have asks, which is also very personal for creators

99
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,480
Speaker ?:  because then it's like if you're on the platform for example and I wanna

100
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,640
Speaker ?:  ask you a question, then I can, and it's a direct interaction that's also

101
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,440
Speaker ?:  a lot more personal too. So I think those combined features make it super

102
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,000
Speaker ?:  fun for people. It does seem like there are a lot of

103
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,400
Speaker ?:  bits and pieces from previous social media platforms that

104
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,360
Speaker ?:  have either come and gone or that still exist that have found their

105
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,320
Speaker ?:  way into Hive social. Now I'm assuming a

106
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,280
Speaker ?:  lot of these features did not exist when you originally launched the app.

107
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,040
Speaker ?:  So what did that version of Hive look like compared to

108
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,560
Speaker ?:  today? That version was very bare bones

109
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,800
Speaker ?:  skeleton. I think if people saw the very first version compared to

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,720
Speaker ?:  today's, they'd be like, wow, like you actually had the balls to launch that.

111
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,640
Speaker ?:  I mean it, it was not as modern or

112
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,760
Speaker ?:  a clean cut or aesthetically pleasing as the design today. You

113
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,720
Speaker ?:  still had your music feature that was still a part of it. But things like

114
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,280
Speaker ?:  asks were just not there. Polls were not there. Again, it was just a very

115
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,640
Speaker ?:  bare bone skeleton app Compared to today's.

116
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,720
Speaker ?:  And because you launched this shortly after you

117
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,400
Speaker ?:  started learning how to code for yourself, tell me about the

118
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,160
Speaker ?:  actual process of building Hive. So my

119
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,480
Speaker ?:  process was literally trying to find coding tutorials online, which might

120
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,040
Speaker ?:  sound super silly but I found you Demi. Shout out to them. They

121
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,160
Speaker ?:  have a ton of tutorials and courses that other people make and then

122
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,440
Speaker ?:  you can buy them. And this is non-ad or sponsorship. It's literally what

123
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,600
Speaker ?:  I use cause I didn't have any other resources. I never took college classes

124
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,560
Speaker ?:  or anything for computer science. So oh, I did some research.

125
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,480
Speaker ?:  I knew I needed to use Xcode to code cause I was just making the i l

126
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,520
Speaker ?:  s version at first. And then the easiest language I guess to learn

127
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,400
Speaker ?:  with that was Swift. I was using Swift four at the time so I just typed in

128
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,120
Speaker ?:  Swift four and Firebase cause I was also researching

129
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,680
Speaker ?:  different databases. I settled on that one and a bunch of tutorials came

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,960
Speaker ?:  up. I bought a couple and then I would sit there and I would watch the video

131
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,840
Speaker ?:  video in like one end of the screen and then on the other I'd have Xcode

132
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,920
Speaker ?:  open and I would just literally, they would say something and then I would

133
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,800
Speaker ?:  code it. And I remember being super excited because I made my first text

134
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,760
Speaker ?:  box and I didn't do anything. It didn't even have like any words in

135
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,400
Speaker ?:  it to say like, oh enter your username or something. It was just a box. And

136
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,680
Speaker ?:  I remember taking a picture and I sent it to my sister-in-law and I was like,

137
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,200
Speaker ?:  look I made a rectangle, it's a box and it's there. You can't do anything.

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,640
Speaker ?:  You can't type in it but like I did it. So I think

139
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,600
Speaker ?:  that part was easy I guess. But again, I did

140
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,080
Speaker ?:  literally have guidelines that I was following. I did make a mistake though.

141
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,040
Speaker ?:  So after I brought my developer on board and he took a look at the code,

142
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,480
Speaker ?:  I still have his text message. He had said that it was

143
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,480
Speaker ?:  impressive because I had hardcoded everything. I didn't

144
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,680
Speaker ?:  know what the hell that meant. So I asked him the library, he like, well

145
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,240
Speaker ?:  most developers use storyboard. Like that's a lot easier cuz then you can

146
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,200
Speaker ?:  just, I guess attach functions to whatever you create visually. And

147
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,200
Speaker ?:  I was like, I done that this entire time because I was coding

148
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,320
Speaker ?:  every single line including the sizing, the the

149
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Speaker ?:  the point sizes and and the colors and everything and input the assets when

150
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,080
Speaker ?:  this whole time I could have been using the storyboard and that would've

151
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,760
Speaker ?:  been so much easier, would've saved me so much more time. And the time spent

152
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,560
Speaker ?:  on it, I, I know some people wonder like, oh well you started coding

153
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,400
Speaker ?:  in and you launched it in October, right? And so that's the, from June to

154
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,120
Speaker ?:  October it's about four or five months they say it's such a short

155
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,000
Speaker ?:  time and and it really is. But because it was the summer, I

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,760
Speaker ?:  didn't have school at that time so I was just working full-time.

157
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,520
Speaker ?:  I'd get up around 7:00 AM come home by three 30,

158
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,240
Speaker ?:  4:00 PM and then I would code from

159
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,120
Speaker ?:  4:30 PM to literally three or 4:00 AM the next night or sometimes

160
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,680
Speaker ?:  I just wouldn't even sleep and then I would just go to work and like repeat.

161
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,640
Speaker ?:  So they were very long days and long hours coding every single day.

162
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
Speaker ?:  Right? My dad would have to remind me to eat or sleep or drink water and

163
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
Speaker ?:  it's like no I wanna do this. Cuz once you're in that zone and like you're

164
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,560
Speaker ?:  so passionately or obsessed with it, you don't wanna stop or like lose your

165
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,880
Speaker ?:  train of thought or anything. So that was my process was just locking myself

166
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,760
Speaker ?:  in my room that summer and just coding it every single night

167
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,560
Speaker ?:  and every single day. I think it's fair to say that when I

168
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,160
Speaker ?:  fall into an internet rabbit hole, it does not normally end in

169
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,320
Speaker ?:  a social media platform getting created. Usually I just have watched

170
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,720
Speaker ?:  too many videos on YouTube or read, read too many

171
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,440
Speaker ?:  articles or have fallen into some subreddit that I wasn't aware of previously

172
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,280
Speaker ?:  and I get obsessed with. So kudos to you for that.

173
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,560
Speaker ?:  We're gonna take a quick break here, but when we come back I'll talk to

174
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,400
Speaker ?:  Barca about what it was like when people started flocking to Hive

175
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker ?:  social, looking for an alternative to Twitter.

176
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,680
Speaker 2:  This episode is

177
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,790
Speaker ?:  Okay. And we're back with my interview with Roka Pop, the founder of

178
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,310
Speaker ?:  Hive Social.

179
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,870
Speaker ?:  So the real kind of change points for

180
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,790
Speaker ?:  Hive Social is October and November of this past year. So

181
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,750
Speaker ?:  Elon Musk takes over Twitter, everybody out there is

182
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,470
Speaker ?:  either super excited about it or super not excited about it and looking for

183
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,150
Speaker ?:  an exit. And one of the apps that people turned to

184
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,630
Speaker ?:  was Hive that could not have been

185
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,470
Speaker ?:  easy. That had to have been a challenge for

186
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,750
Speaker ?:  an app that at that time employed three people. Is that right?

187
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,830
Speaker ?:  Yeah, three people. I think we're up to five Threes of

188
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,190
Speaker ?:  people almost. Yes, you've got almost threes of people working on the app.

189
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,550
Speaker ?:  So you have this massive user rush and

190
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,750
Speaker ?:  there were some complications. I remember I signed up for

191
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,550
Speaker ?:  Hive and I remember seeing a lot of folks saying that

192
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,870
Speaker ?:  usernames could be doubled up and there were some, there were some bugs and

193
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,550
Speaker ?:  challenges because of the mass influx of users.

194
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,990
Speaker ?:  I would love to hear you walk me through your side of

195
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,710
Speaker ?:  that experience. Yeah, so that experience completely

196
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,470
Speaker ?:  caught us of guard. We've had some growth spurts in the past as well. And

197
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,390
Speaker ?:  normally it's from something going viral. Like if people take a screenshot

198
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,310
Speaker ?:  their profile and they share it somehow, I don't know how it just, it

199
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,910
Speaker ?:  goes viral. So that's exactly what happened this time. It just happened on

200
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,870
Speaker ?:  a such a larger scale, whether that was in direct correlation with

201
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,150
Speaker ?:  everything that was going on on Twitter or it just reached the right accounts,

202
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,950
Speaker ?:  I have no idea. But it really exploded and

203
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,870
Speaker ?:  we were not prepared for that growth or, or our server

204
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,150
Speaker ?:  wasn't, I guess you could say, because we gained

205
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,430
Speaker ?:  over 150,000 people overnight and everyone trying

206
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,310
Speaker ?:  to sign up and making their accounts. That was just so amazing

207
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,110
Speaker ?:  to watch it happen. I didn't sleep for days literally cause I was just so

208
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,870
Speaker ?:  excited and I wanted to respond to people. If you get a response from like

209
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,470
Speaker ?:  the hi social account on Twitter, that's most likely me. There's two other

210
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,910
Speaker ?:  people who have access to you. But I'm on there a lot of the time and I try

211
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,470
Speaker ?:  and respond to everyone. So that's what I was doing. I was trying to respond

212
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,550
Speaker ?:  to people and let them know, you know, if they have questions like for example

213
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,270
Speaker ?:  about the duplicate usernames or when the site went down and the

214
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,030
Speaker ?:  completely, you know, the servers crashed, that was a, a kind of

215
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,000
Speaker ?:  panicky moment at that time. No functions worked. So

216
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,480
Speaker ?:  that's actually how the duplicate username bug came to be because

217
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,480
Speaker ?:  since the server was down and no functions were working, so like

218
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,040
Speaker ?:  the function to catch that duplicate username and say, hey, like this is

219
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,960
Speaker ?:  a duplicate, you can't use it. That was down too. So then that ended up

220
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,640
Speaker ?:  being a bug and now I have like over a hundred Nicki mjs on the app when

221
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,560
Speaker ?:  I know none of them are her. But I mean that's just one of

222
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,320
Speaker ?:  the things that the server going down had done and we, we were working to

223
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,520
Speaker ?:  get it back up. So we were working with the Google team, we ended up bringing

224
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Speaker ?:  on a different developer at that time and he's still with us, he's super

225
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,480
Speaker ?:  great. So we got it back up that Friday. It had,

226
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,440
Speaker ?:  I think it went down on Thursday and we brought it up Friday night and

227
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,240
Speaker ?:  then the wave just kept coming and we ended up going past 2

228
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
Speaker ?:  million users when I think we had 600 to

229
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,000
Speaker ?:  700,000 at that time. Oh wow. Yeah. That is a pretty big crush on your

230
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,880
Speaker ?:  systems. Yeah, it, it, it really was. I, I think that the post is still

231
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,720
Speaker ?:  up there. I had taken a screenshot of all the reads that were going

232
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,360
Speaker ?:  on within the, the server, which is like every, every time someone does something,

233
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,240
Speaker ?:  we had over, I think over 3 billion reads. So that

234
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,840
Speaker ?:  was, those were all the function calls going to the server and why it had

235
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,720
Speaker ?:  all come down. So those were really wild numbers to see, but I

236
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,680
Speaker ?:  was really excited about it because that kind of proved what I had

237
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,040
Speaker ?:  originally thought like all those years back that hey, there is this downward

238
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,280
Speaker ?:  market trend, there's this market demand, people are going to want a new

239
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,440
Speaker ?:  app and again, whatever correlation it has to anything else going a on

240
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,200
Speaker ?:  out there or if people just really want something new, I mean

241
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,320
Speaker ?:  they really showed out for the app and, and signing up and supporting it.

242
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
Speaker ?:  So it, it was just really awesome to see it come to life. Were there specific

243
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,880
Speaker ?:  communities that you noticed in the data

244
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,000
Speaker ?:  for users that really sort of helped bring in

245
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
Speaker ?:  more users? Because it feels like there are some like real key

246
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,600
Speaker ?:  communities in fandom that were

247
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,360
Speaker ?:  extremely excited about Hive. Oh yeah, the K-pop

248
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,240
Speaker ?:  communities, what actually kicked off those viral posts, so shout

249
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,960
Speaker ?:  out to them and then that just somehow turned into the gaming community

250
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,440
Speaker ?:  coming on board, which opened the doors for cosplay and then the beauty community

251
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,480
Speaker ?:  and then the Star Wars community and Star Trek community were huge

252
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,880
Speaker ?:  on there as well. I know some notable gaming

253
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,760
Speaker ?:  community specifically that gone on I think we're Call of Duty

254
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,120
Speaker ?:  and then Bungee, so, which was actually really funny because

255
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,120
Speaker ?:  maybe you can see, but I have an Xbox back there and I play Destiny myself,

256
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,000
Speaker ?:  which Bungee had created. So it was just kind of a

257
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,840
Speaker ?:  full circle moment for me to have love the game so much and then have the

258
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,200
Speaker ?:  actual community come on to Hive. So, so it was just really cool to connect

259
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,400
Speaker ?:  with those, with those, the people from that gaming community.

260
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,760
Speaker ?:  But I would definitely say those big three would be

261
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,720
Speaker ?:  at Ridgeland K-Pop and then Gaming Beauty Cosplaying. And I

262
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,400
Speaker ?:  think the fifth one I would have to say is music since you know, have

263
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Speaker ?:  supports music artists like I I mentioned the streams from the profile

264
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Speaker ?:  music accounts towards their overall total. That was

265
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,440
Speaker ?:  really big on there too. So we noticed a lot of hiphop, pop, anything

266
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,320
Speaker ?:  that's trending you would see or hear either on the radio or other

267
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,280
Speaker ?:  apps, it's very similar following those trends on Hive. For

268
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,800
Speaker ?:  listeners who are unaware of hives profile

269
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,720
Speaker ?:  features, one of them is the ability to, much

270
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,440
Speaker ?:  like MySpace used to have set a profile song that

271
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,360
Speaker ?:  plays whenever someone opens up your profile and then there is a

272
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,800
Speaker ?:  monetization ability to purchase additional

273
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,520
Speaker ?:  or unlock additional music slots up to four songs. And

274
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,200
Speaker ?:  so I thought that was a very interesting way for Hive

275
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,920
Speaker ?:  to monetize because it is a free app, it is free for users

276
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,240
Speaker ?:  to use and I am really curious about

277
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,240
Speaker ?:  the future of Hive in that regard. Becoming

278
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,040
Speaker ?:  profitable, being able to monetize in a way that will enable you

279
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,000
Speaker ?:  to hire additional developers to continue to work on

280
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,920
Speaker ?:  all of the things that Hive has going on, which I would love to hear

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,880
Speaker ?:  about Hive's plans in let's say the next year.

282
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,800
Speaker ?:  Like what does Hive look like in a year for you? Hive has

283
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,120
Speaker ?:  some really big things planned in the next year. We've partnered with a lot

284
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,080
Speaker ?:  of different brands that I'm really excited to talk about later, later

285
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,920
Speaker ?:  on as well. And the brands, the, the influencers, you'll

286
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,520
Speaker ?:  see those more. But Hives has always been an

287
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,840
Speaker ?:  authentic social media app. That's how I kind of refer to, because a lot

288
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,760
Speaker ?:  of the content that's posted on there is very genuine, it's raw, organic

289
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,360
Speaker ?:  or it could be very curated if you have a specific niche or community that

290
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,440
Speaker ?:  you belong to. So I think having a creator economy where we support

291
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,920
Speaker ?:  those creators is definitely in the works. For example, one

292
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,240
Speaker ?:  feature that's out there and actually the, the term

293
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,480
Speaker ?:  that our users or our our besties have called it

294
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,120
Speaker ?:  is hi streams, which is basically live streaming. We wanna introduce that

295
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,880
Speaker ?:  on the app and then allow users to much like TikTok

296
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,680
Speaker ?:  give gifts through that app that then those creators could convert to

297
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,400
Speaker ?:  cash and then withdraw that for themselves. And I think i's a

298
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,240
Speaker ?:  percentage from that would be lower than other apps because we understand

299
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,600
Speaker ?:  that. I mean, I was, I was, I used to be a micro influencer so I know how

300
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,440
Speaker ?:  important the, that money is, that cash flow is, we

301
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,000
Speaker ?:  wouldn't take a lot from them because it's their full-time job, it's what

302
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,520
Speaker ?:  they're trying to do and I want to support

303
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,280
Speaker ?:  them in that way. So I think live streaming would be one with those

304
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,320
Speaker ?:  in-app purchases, the gifts, and then also in-app

305
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,760
Speaker ?:  subscriptions to different members profiles. So if you've got exclusive content

306
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,640
Speaker ?:  you wanna show behind the scenes for the podcast, for example, then

307
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,520
Speaker ?:  you could put your account behind like a paywall. It's whatever price you

308
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,720
Speaker ?:  wanted, we'll probably have a limit. I don't think people are gonna be putting

309
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,680
Speaker ?:  like a $500 a month to see this profile. I

310
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,160
Speaker ?:  don't know, some people will pay a lot of money for access to certain people,

311
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,920
Speaker ?:  maybe We'll test it with like a small batch and we'll see. But that, that's

312
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,640
Speaker ?:  an idea that, that we've been toying around with because I think it is really

313
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,040
Speaker ?:  fun to see behind the scenes exclusive content and that's another way for

314
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,680
Speaker ?:  computers to get closer with their audience members. So those two

315
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,800
Speaker ?:  revenue streams are going to be coming to Hive. And again, the

316
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,400
Speaker ?:  those brand partnerships that I had mentioned, you'll see them throughout

317
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,320
Speaker ?:  the app because I think Hive will eventually have ads and before

318
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,000
Speaker ?:  anyone freaks out, hive did have ads before the shutdown

319
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,560
Speaker ?:  and all that. We used to have one ad every like

320
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,240
Speaker ?:  seven posts I think on the home feed. And now we're just kind of

321
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,120
Speaker ?:  reframing that since we do have these brand partnerships now they're, they're

322
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,680
Speaker ?:  very minimally invasive. They looked exactly like posts, so it never really

323
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,040
Speaker ?:  bothered people that that was the feedback that we got from the beta group.

324
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,760
Speaker ?:  So now with these brand partnerships instead of, you know, having

325
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,800
Speaker ?:  more randomized ads through Google Ad Mo because that's what we were

326
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,400
Speaker ?:  using, you'll probably see paid advertising from

327
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,400
Speaker ?:  these brands out there. So I'm really excited to bring those

328
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,080
Speaker ?:  campaigns onto Hive. I'm very picky with those as well. So nothing

329
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,840
Speaker ?:  low quality at all.

330
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,760
Speaker ?:  Okay, we're gonna take one more break and when we return I'll check in with

331
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,960
Speaker ?:  Alex Kranz and then more of my interview with Roca.

332
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,000
Speaker 1:  This podcast is sponsored by Toyota Crown. The all new Toyota

333
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,920
Speaker 1:  crown is breaking new ground when it comes to the premium sedan with an available

334
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,680
Speaker 1:  hybrid max powertrain. The Toyota Crown is the perfect combination of

335
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,440
Speaker 1:  power, style, and elegance, making it the car to glide in

336
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,640
Speaker 1:  from a driver focused interior that says you're always comfortable in the

337
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,360
Speaker 1:  spotlight to the stylish exterior that says I have arrived.

338
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,200
Speaker 1:  Toyota says, wherever you go in the all new Toyota crown, you make a

339
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,040
Speaker 1:  statement, the car that says so much, visit toyota.com/crown

340
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,080
Speaker 1:  to learn more. Toyota, let's go places.

341
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,570
Speaker ?:  All right, we're back from break. I've gotta, I gotta interrupt you. I'm

342
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,890
Speaker ?:  sorry. Okay, I got, I got questions. I'm, I'm enjoying this interview, but

343
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,850
Speaker ?:  I, I also have some questions because before the break,

344
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,250
Speaker ?:  Roca referenced this big shutdown and for those of us who don't

345
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,930
Speaker ?:  know, I've deactivated their servers temporarily

346
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,090
Speaker ?:  last fall after some researchers found what looked like some security issues

347
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,690
Speaker ?:  with the app. Ashley, can you kind of tell me more about that? Yeah,

348
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,530
Speaker ?:  so this group of researchers had basically posted

349
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,810
Speaker ?:  a report saying there are a ton of issues here. All

350
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,730
Speaker ?:  of these issues allow any attacker to access all data

351
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,570
Speaker ?:  on Hive. Oh boy. Which is not great. And, and that includes

352
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,090
Speaker ?:  private posts, private messages, shared media, even deleted

353
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,360
Speaker ?:  dms. Ooh, so sliding into the dms and

354
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,280
Speaker ?:  deleting Not gone forever. No, everything lives forever on the

355
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,880
Speaker ?:  internet. So yeah, it was a, it was a Berlin based security collective and

356
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Speaker ?:  they said this also includes private email addresses, phone numbers enter

357
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,760
Speaker ?:  during login, so not great. And so they

358
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
Speaker ?:  took down the servers entirely. The app was still up,

359
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,600
Speaker ?:  you could refresh, but it would just refresh to the exact same place that

360
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,360
Speaker ?:  the app was in the, the place your app was in when you opened it,

361
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,080
Speaker ?:  when they shut down the servers. But the service was actually down for two

362
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,040
Speaker ?:  weeks to fix these security risks, which in the world of

363
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,800
Speaker ?:  social media is an actual lifetime it feels like. Yeah. You know,

364
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,960
Speaker ?:  that begs the question, and I think everybody knows the answer. It's a

365
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,040
Speaker ?:  rhetorical question, what do people do when something doesn't work? They

366
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,800
Speaker ?:  stop using it. Yeah. So it's a, it's definitely a really

367
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,160
Speaker ?:  difficult problem to have when you have such a small staff and the inability

368
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,600
Speaker ?:  to remain live while you fix all of these issues in a test

369
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,560
Speaker ?:  environment. And so how do you get those people back? Yeah. How, how

370
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,520
Speaker ?:  do you get those people back? Does, does Roca have an answer for That? I

371
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,040
Speaker ?:  think she does.

372
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,560
Speaker ?:  I'm curious about the decision to pull Hive

373
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,120
Speaker ?:  entirely offline for a period of time and

374
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,520
Speaker ?:  how you as the founder plan to sort of

375
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,640
Speaker ?:  regain those users because obviously there has to

376
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,520
Speaker ?:  have been some drop. Yeah, so regaining the users

377
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,800
Speaker ?:  and the momentum that's going to come from the brand that we've partnered

378
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,720
Speaker ?:  with, and then also influencers later down the line as well as those extra

379
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,360
Speaker ?:  features that are coming later this year. I, I think Hive is an

380
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,960
Speaker ?:  ever-evolving app with, again, very carefully selective features. I'm,

381
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,600
Speaker ?:  I'm the one that makes the final decision on that. So if anything launches

382
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,200
Speaker ?:  and you guys don't like it, blame me fully because I'm the one picking and

383
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,880
Speaker ?:  choosing what to put in the, in the app. So the decision though, to take

384
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,560
Speaker ?:  it fully offline was actually from that

385
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,560
Speaker ?:  security company that had posted the original article, SERFOR Shung.

386
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,680
Speaker ?:  I had actually been in communication with them prior to the article even

387
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,360
Speaker ?:  going live. And the decision that we originally came to

388
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,600
Speaker ?:  was that they wouldn't post it until the issues

389
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,520
Speaker ?:  were fixed and then they posted it anyway. And then we,

390
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,480
Speaker ?:  we had a phone call afterwards where I told them kind of flat

391
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,440
Speaker ?:  out that, Hey, are you guys going to reconfirm that

392
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,480
Speaker ?:  or just confirm that these vulnerabilities were fixed, you kind of threw

393
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,360
Speaker ?:  a grenade and then you ran away and you caused this huge uproar.

394
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,200
Speaker ?:  They did confirm that they would do that for us, but as

395
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,520
Speaker ?:  of, yeah, I haven't seen anything come out, so I, I don't really know what's

396
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,920
Speaker ?:  going on with that. I haven't been in contact with them recently.

397
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,320
Speaker ?:  So that definitely threw a wrench in there

398
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,280
Speaker ?:  because the reason they were going to wait for those vulnerabilities

399
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,240
Speaker ?:  to be fixed, like that's their standard when they report vulnerabilities

400
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,080
Speaker ?:  on a company, it's usually after they have fixed those issues for

401
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,960
Speaker ?:  the simple common sense reason that hey, if you disclose these vulnerabilities

402
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,880
Speaker ?:  out there to people, then there's black hat hackers out there that

403
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,600
Speaker ?:  are going to exploit those. And at that point it

404
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,800
Speaker ?:  was just mind blowing to me that they had posted it because now

405
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,680
Speaker ?:  everyone has like a how to guide on how to exploit those vulnerabilities

406
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,560
Speaker ?:  and it just wasn't safe for people. I mean, we took full accountability

407
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,520
Speaker ?:  and responsibility for it by fixing them and we weren't communication with

408
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,480
Speaker ?:  them. So for them to have made that decision, it, it was really kind of

409
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,720
Speaker ?:  devastating because you worked for so many years on an app and you try

410
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,720
Speaker ?:  to make everything as perfect as possible. And it was my fault

411
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,680
Speaker ?:  for the, the security vulnerabilities even existing. But the fact that

412
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,600
Speaker ?:  they posted and exposed it to those hackers specifically that are

413
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,160
Speaker ?:  reading those, they're trying to see which companies have a, a

414
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,840
Speaker ?:  weaker security framework or system and, and to steal

415
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,600
Speaker ?:  people's data. It was again, just devastating. So we decided,

416
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,520
Speaker ?:  you know, now that hackers out there around the world know

417
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,280
Speaker ?:  about all of this, we would rather just take it offline.

418
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,560
Speaker ?:  And again, I know that resulted in the momentum

419
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,360
Speaker ?:  slowing down because nothing was working within the app.

420
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,120
Speaker ?:  Everything was just completely locked down. But I decided that was the best

421
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,520
Speaker ?:  thing because I would rather have shut down the app and made that decision

422
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,760
Speaker ?:  versus having people's data actually stolen. So I

423
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,000
Speaker ?:  think that's another confusing point for people is some of them think it

424
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Speaker ?:  was a security breach, but nothing was breached. There was no user data

425
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,240
Speaker ?:  stolen, nothing like that. It was just a security vulnerability report.

426
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,920
Speaker ?:  And we have fixed that. All of those since then. The Google

427
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,600
Speaker ?:  engineering team actually cleared that for us. We were on a call

428
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,400
Speaker ?:  with them back and forth and they gave us the green light and then

429
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,880
Speaker ?:  that's when we had brought it back online. I know a lot of people who had

430
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,720
Speaker ?:  initially tried Hive, obviously there was a, a

431
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,400
Speaker ?:  great clamoring for an Android app and then

432
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,120
Speaker ?:  also a desktop app and the process of those

433
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,640
Speaker ?:  things. I would love to hear a little bit about the process

434
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,320
Speaker ?:  of bringing Hive specifically to mobile only

435
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,800
Speaker ?:  at this point, and if you have any plans on your

436
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,720
Speaker ?:  roadmap for a desktop version of the app? Oh yeah, desktop is

437
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,920
Speaker ?:  gonna come later down the line. Right now we just want to focus on mobile

438
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,520
Speaker ?:  only because, you know, we, we did bring the service back online,

439
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,480
Speaker ?:  it's functional, but there's just certain bugs and there's features that

440
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,240
Speaker ?:  we wanna bring on that we really wanna dedicate all of our time of effort

441
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,960
Speaker ?:  and focus to before diverting that to a desktop app. Since

442
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,760
Speaker ?:  we're such a small team, we wanna use our

443
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,520
Speaker ?:  time and efforts wisely and we just don't think it's very feasible at this

444
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,440
Speaker ?:  time to add a desktop version onto our plate because

445
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,360
Speaker ?:  that's essentially rebuilding the entire app. So that is

446
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,040
Speaker ?:  gonna be tabled until later this year. And then right now we're just

447
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,680
Speaker ?:  focusing mobile only. Make that perfect, give everyone a seamless experience,

448
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Speaker ?:  bring those new features on and then we can focus on desktop.

449
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,250
Speaker ?:  I am very curious about your view of

450
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,210
Speaker ?:  the current state of social media. Do you think that we

451
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,090
Speaker ?:  will see major disruption in that space and how

452
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,050
Speaker ?:  that might happen? Or will we see more subtle change over the next few years?

453
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,650
Speaker ?:  Like what's your, what's your take on the current landscape?

454
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,730
Speaker ?:  I think major changes are coming because of the current landscape. So

455
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,730
Speaker ?:  I'm a really observant person. I like to read patterns in different

456
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,850
Speaker ?:  trends out there and just from seeing everyone's reactions

457
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,810
Speaker ?:  to not just the, the Twitter buyout that happened, but

458
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,250
Speaker ?:  social media in general, I, I don't think they're happy with it. I see a

459
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,450
Speaker ?:  lot more complaints than not. A lot of people are very

460
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,170
Speaker ?:  exhausted, I think from social media because it's not really fun

461
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,050
Speaker ?:  anymore. There's, aside from the aesthetic part with like

462
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,690
Speaker ?:  outdated layouts, whatever, you also just have the culture and

463
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,290
Speaker ?:  environment that are on these apps. Like for example, you go on Instagram,

464
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,330
Speaker ?:  you know, you have to curate this personality. And I know I

465
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:57,090
Speaker ?:  say have to, you don't need to, but if you wanna be someone on that platform

466
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,770
Speaker ?:  or you wanna showcase a certain lifestyle, you have to curate that personality

467
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,050
Speaker ?:  and kind of become this whole different person. When people in real life

468
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,850
Speaker ?:  know you as someone else on Twitter, you get on there and you're just

469
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,330
Speaker ?:  angry all the time because you see so many heart-wrenching

470
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,330
Speaker ?:  hosts and news on there about different things around the world or different

471
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,690
Speaker ?:  political things that are going on and it infuriates you. So

472
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,610
Speaker ?:  you've got one on Instagram where you have to be essentially fake, then you

473
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,170
Speaker ?:  have Twitter or you have to be angry. And then TikTok, I mean, you just get

474
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,930
Speaker ?:  on there and you kind of rant about whatever you make videos and that when

475
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,330
Speaker ?:  you just scroll forever you laugh and stuff. But even there, there's that

476
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,090
Speaker ?:  pressure to, again, if you wanna be a creator on there, you have to

477
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,850
Speaker ?:  consistently post. So the algorithm is pushing you. And I think

478
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,890
Speaker ?:  with that landscape constantly changing, different apps

479
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:49,010
Speaker ?:  are popping up. I know there's other apps and I guess

480
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,890
Speaker ?:  alternatives like Hive, but I think what sets Hive apart is

481
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,650
Speaker ?:  that we're actually a social media app that's again, a

482
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,490
Speaker ?:  unique standalone app. We're not clones of anyone else. We have our own

483
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,250
Speaker ?:  different, carefully selected blended features that work really cohesively

484
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,170
Speaker ?:  in the app. And we're very focused on UI and the user experience. And I think

485
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,970
Speaker ?:  that's what helps us deliver that more raw, organic experience to our

486
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,290
Speaker ?:  users. It's just the fact that we caring, we're really trying to make an

487
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,970
Speaker ?:  app that people genuinely love. And on that note,

488
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,130
Speaker ?:  if there's someone out there who is not unlike

489
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,010
Speaker ?:  you when you were 19 years old thinking I would like

490
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,610
Speaker ?:  to break out of the systems that I currently

491
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,370
Speaker ?:  operate in and I wanna build something, I wanna found my

492
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,330
Speaker ?:  own social media platform or something else like that, what advice do

493
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,200
Speaker ?:  you have for them and how do you think that your advice

494
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,720
Speaker ?:  is unique to you? Especially because you

495
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,920
Speaker ?:  have, you have experienced quite a ride in a

496
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,360
Speaker ?:  very short period of time. So I have two pieces

497
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,440
Speaker ?:  of advice or or three really. The first one is just started, the

498
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,360
Speaker ?:  second one is do not have any fear. And the third one is just find

499
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,080
Speaker ?:  humor in everything and I'll, I'll kind of go through each of those

500
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,000
Speaker ?:  points. So the first one for just starting it, me personally,

501
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,760
Speaker ?:  I'm a perfectionist. I, I know if I'm starting something I'm going to be

502
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,720
Speaker ?:  completely obsessed with it, but I also have this kind of fear that links

503
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,400
Speaker ?:  to the second point where, well what if I start it and it just

504
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,680
Speaker ?:  sucks. Like, what if I'm not good enough? I, I don't wanna start something

505
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,000
Speaker ?:  and have to learn it, I wanna start something and already be good at it,

506
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,200
Speaker ?:  which is so, so strange. But if you just start

507
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,160
Speaker ?:  it, that is honestly going to be the biggest hurdle, at least that I've

508
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,960
Speaker ?:  experienced. Because you're kind of just sitting there with that trepidation

509
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,640
Speaker ?:  like, oh, should I really do it? What if it doesn't work? And you kind of

510
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,880
Speaker ?:  think about failure and all those, what if scenarios that are honestly more

511
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,160
Speaker ?:  pessimistic than optimistic Because I think as humans we tend to think of

512
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,000
Speaker ?:  just that pathway for ourselves, but if you just start it,

513
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,920
Speaker ?:  you're already leaps ahead of other people who are just sitting on the

514
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,800
Speaker ?:  couch just dreaming about it. My second point to not have any fear,

515
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,000
Speaker ?:  again from my personal experience, some people that I talk to

516
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Speaker ?:  and my friends are like, you know, your competitors are Zuckerberg and Musk.

517
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,360
Speaker ?:  Like, aren't you kind of like afraid of that or what people are saying

518
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,200
Speaker ?:  about you? And I don't, I don't really have any fear

519
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,480
Speaker ?:  about that because I'm not focused on other people. I'm focused on myself,

520
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,320
Speaker ?:  I'm focused on Hive and I want it to grow. And it's like, yes, you should

521
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,920
Speaker ?:  always be aware of things that are going on on around you or

522
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,480
Speaker ?:  potential competitors, whatever it is. But be aware, don't be

523
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,080
Speaker ?:  concerned and don't be afraid. And my third point in finding

524
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,760
Speaker ?:  humor in everything, that's honestly what has gotten me to this point

525
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,640
Speaker ?:  because a lot of, I, I have seen a lot of comments if

526
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,320
Speaker ?:  he looks through Aaron Greenberg's posts on Twitter, when he, he had posted

527
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,960
Speaker ?:  an article, I think it was from Newsweek, they had used a profile

528
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,120
Speaker ?:  picture of me and a lot of people were saying that I was

529
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,920
Speaker ?:  either ai, that I wasn't real, that I was

530
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,400
Speaker ?:  secretly either a Chinese guy in a basement or some Russian

531
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,280
Speaker ?:  spy that was like making the app. So there's a lot of different

532
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,200
Speaker ?:  rumors out there about me and speaking to anyone listening to

533
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,440
Speaker ?:  this podcast, there will probably be a lot of rumors about you too. Whether

534
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,320
Speaker ?:  it's articles about you or if it's people in your real life that are saying

535
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,280
Speaker ?:  stuff about you as well. But you have to find humor in it. So for me

536
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,960
Speaker ?:  personally, when I heard the whole AI and then Chinese guy Russian

537
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,520
Speaker ?:  spy thing, I made a TikTok response, I made a TikTok video

538
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,720
Speaker ?:  response and I just had fun with it and it, it got a lot of laughs

539
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,400
Speaker ?:  for me. It was kind of stress free because so much was going on with the

540
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,000
Speaker ?:  app. I kind of just had that break and I was like, I'll just make a quirky

541
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,560
Speaker ?:  little response. And then everyone else loved it too. So as long

542
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,240
Speaker ?:  as you start it, you don't have fear and you find humor

543
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,400
Speaker ?:  and stuff, I think you'll get really far. So that's coming from my

544
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,760
Speaker ?:  own experience with, you know, hive and everything that's been going on with

545
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,840
Speaker ?:  it. I think that's really good advice. And if you are in fact

546
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,520
Speaker ?:  a digital creation and an ai, it's, it's a really

547
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,400
Speaker ?:  impressive one. It's a really impressive one. You can

548
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,360
Speaker ?:  also just say you built yourself, I built myself, I have programs

549
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,200
Speaker ?:  running in the background. You guys don't see, I have some wires in the corner.

550
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,000
Speaker ?:  It's hooked up to me as my little charging port. So I

551
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,840
Speaker ?:  appreciate this conversation so much and I can't wait to

552
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,400
Speaker ?:  see what is in the future for hives. So thank you Ruka for, for chatting
