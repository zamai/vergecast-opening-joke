Description: The Verge's David Pierce, Alex Cranz, Allison Johnson, and Richard Lawler discuss the Google Pixel 9 review and its controversial reimagine AI feature, a Chick-fil-A streaming service, Sonos app updates, and more.

2
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:16,735
Speaker 6:  devolving

3
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:01,375
Speaker 6:  make every error possible. So we're gonna get to all of that. But

4
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,255
Speaker 6:  we should start with The. Pixel. And I want to get into like the existential

5
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:08,015
Speaker 6:  crisis that is coming for us here in a minute. But first we should just talk

6
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:11,855
Speaker 6:  about the phone. Allison, you reviewed the whole

7
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:15,695
Speaker 6:  sort of Pixel nine line minus the fold, but the The Pixel

8
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:19,455
Speaker 6:  nine and The Pixel Pro. I don't, I I lost track. There's too many phones.

9
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:20,855
Speaker 7:  There's a lot of phones.

10
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:25,455
Speaker 6:  And I would say the, the initial read from your review was

11
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:29,335
Speaker 6:  that like, at least on a hardware perspective, Google kind

12
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:31,095
Speaker 6:  of nailed it, right?

13
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:35,175
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah. Talking about the phones as phones is actually

14
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:38,935
Speaker 7:  really easy and like straightforward. 'cause they're great. They're

15
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:42,295
Speaker 7:  iPhones from the front. This is like just, everybody's just made their phone

16
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,855
Speaker 7:  into an iPhone and I think that's fine. You know, the, the sides are flat,

17
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:50,335
Speaker 7:  the screens are bright, you know, the bezels are all uniform,

18
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:54,655
Speaker 7:  et cetera. They look and feel really good

19
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,935
Speaker 7:  in a way that the last couple generations of pixel

20
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,045
Speaker 7:  phones were like, eh, I don't know. I can see why you charge like

21
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:07,125
Speaker 7:  $200 less for this than like a Galaxy S 24

22
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,845
Speaker 7:  plus. But this time around they like nailed it. It's right,

23
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:13,645
Speaker 7:  right up there with the, with the best of the best I think.

24
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:18,125
Speaker 6:  I feel like this was finally Google saying like, what

25
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,925
Speaker 6:  if we just made it really nice. Yeah. Which feels like an insult,

26
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,765
Speaker 6:  but I, I think your, your point about the price I think is exactly right.

27
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:27,325
Speaker 6:  'cause I feel like Google has been caught in this thing since the beginning

28
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:31,205
Speaker 6:  of The Pixel where the goal was to make a

29
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,725
Speaker 6:  really high-end phone for not a really high end price. And

30
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:39,125
Speaker 6:  increasingly there are fewer and fewer ways You can cheap out on a

31
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,285
Speaker 6:  phone. The processor is no longer one of them. 'cause you have to do all

32
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:45,045
Speaker 6:  this AI stuff, you have to do all the camera stuff. Like you need the processor.

33
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,605
Speaker 6:  So you can't save money there. You can't save money on the camera. So one

34
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:52,445
Speaker 6:  of the ways to save money is basically by making the thing

35
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:56,485
Speaker 6:  itself cheaper and less nice. Right? It makes it

36
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:00,165
Speaker 6:  easier to make the materials less expensive. All that is fine and good, but

37
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:04,005
Speaker 6:  Google just never got it there. Like it never was able to

38
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:07,045
Speaker 6:  make a nice thing at that price. And I feel like this time,

39
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:10,805
Speaker 6:  whatever you wanna say about the price, I think it, it has, it's a bummer

40
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:12,925
Speaker 6:  that it's gotten more expensive over time, but the fact that they were just

41
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:16,205
Speaker 6:  like, okay, this is now a flagship phone and we're gonna do all the flagship

42
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:19,325
Speaker 6:  things to, it feels like the right call.

43
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:22,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I really think so. And especially in the US where

44
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:26,805
Speaker 7:  we usually buy our phones through our carriers, you're not even really like

45
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:31,085
Speaker 7:  paying, you know, full price. Like who is paying full price for a pixel phone

46
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:34,725
Speaker 7:  right now? I Right. I know at least one person. Really?

47
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:38,245
Speaker 7:  Yes. Parker got one for like a hundred bucks.

48
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:43,405
Speaker 7:  I don't even understand that math. But that's the thing is like

49
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,405
Speaker 7:  the price difference on paper, you're like, okay, this phone is $200 cheaper.

50
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:51,405
Speaker 7:  This one, you know, you lose a few things, but then you

51
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:55,125
Speaker 7:  look at the math and it's like, we're talking about, you know, $8 a month

52
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:59,005
Speaker 7:  versus $10 a month, or you're just getting your phone just fully,

53
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:03,285
Speaker 7:  you know, free basically through the carrier. You're, you're suddenly less

54
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:06,965
Speaker 7:  concerned with like, well I'd really like it if it was $200 cheaper. So

55
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:10,205
Speaker 7:  it's just like weird territory. I think the

56
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:14,565
Speaker 7:  midrange, especially upper midrange in the A series being

57
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:18,565
Speaker 7:  so good, like you get so much in the A series for like a, an

58
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:22,565
Speaker 7:  actual midrange price that having the, the

59
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:26,445
Speaker 7:  regular mainline ones just like hovering just above that didn't make

60
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:29,685
Speaker 7:  a lot of sense. So now this, yeah, this year feels like,

61
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:33,565
Speaker 7:  forget it. Like here they're just, they're just really good phones and

62
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:37,485
Speaker 7:  it worked. They do have giant butts. They do.

63
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:42,685
Speaker 7:  Which is a, a choice. So there's the thing in the like

64
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:46,845
Speaker 7:  era of like, every phone looks like an iPhone from the front, which is fine.

65
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:50,565
Speaker 7:  You have to do something on the back that's like, oh, that's not an iPhone.

66
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:54,405
Speaker 7:  That's a Galaxy S 24. Google is really leaning

67
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:57,005
Speaker 7:  into the, like it was the visor

68
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:02,005
Speaker 7:  camera bump. Now it's just like a little thing on its own and it's like

69
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,805
Speaker 7:  super chunked out. I dunno how else to describe

70
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:09,765
Speaker 8:  It. It's just, it's got a booty on it. Yeah. And it's like, but

71
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:12,925
Speaker 8:  I, I didn't, I I, you know, I got one last week when we were at The Pixel

72
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:16,565
Speaker 8:  event and I've found that I don't mind the bump.

73
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:20,365
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I do look at it sometimes. I'm like, that's a big ass. But I'm also

74
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:20,925
Speaker 8:  like, it's fine

75
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:24,565
Speaker 7:  When you see it at first you're like, oh wow, that's really something. And

76
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,525
Speaker 7:  you get used to it pretty quickly. I think.

77
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:29,605
Speaker 8:  I think I like forced you and Sean to look at it. I was like, is this truly

78
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,765
Speaker 8:  large? This looks enormous. And you're like, just trying to blog

79
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:34,125
Speaker 8:  it was great.

80
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,925
Speaker 6:  Is this enormous is a very honest

81
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,125
Speaker 7:  Question. What is this?

82
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:39,085
Speaker 8:  It

83
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,085
Speaker 6:  It all update? I feel like I have two thoughts on the bump. One is that it

84
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:45,725
Speaker 6:  is, it is just very slightly asymmetrical in a way that kind of drives me

85
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:49,605
Speaker 6:  nuts. Like the, the lenses are all just shifted off to the

86
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:52,405
Speaker 6:  left so that the flash and the sensor can be off to the right. And like,

87
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:56,245
Speaker 6:  I get why you have to do that. But it is so close to being symmetrical

88
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:59,725
Speaker 6:  that it is, it's just a little weighted to the left in a way that kind of

89
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:02,845
Speaker 6:  hurts my eyes to look at. Okay. The other thing is that I think

90
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:07,205
Speaker 6:  camera bumps are overrated because everybody puts a case on their phone

91
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:11,125
Speaker 6:  anyway. And the fact that this one is big enough that the phone doesn't wobble

92
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:15,445
Speaker 6:  on a table, makes the camera bump a solved problem, in my opinion. It

93
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:18,005
Speaker 6:  is really nice. The thing I hate about the iPhone is that it wiggles and

94
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,685
Speaker 6:  you, you touch the corner when it's down and it wiggles as you're trying

95
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:24,365
Speaker 6:  to do it. And if they've made this in such a way that it like

96
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,725
Speaker 6:  leans it up at like a teeny tiny angle, but it doesn't wobble, that's kind

97
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:28,045
Speaker 6:  of great.

98
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:30,245
Speaker 8:  It does wiggle know.

99
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:31,045
Speaker 6:  Have you ever noticed

100
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:35,005
Speaker 8:  This? Well, I, I've, I've always been a case person and my last case like

101
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:39,325
Speaker 8:  cut me. It hurt me. It broke and it hurt me. I was like

102
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:43,165
Speaker 8:  putting it in my on, I had like this, like a plastic case and I was putting

103
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:46,045
Speaker 8:  it in my pocket and it like shredded my finger was horrible. I

104
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:49,765
Speaker 7:  Yikes. I saw evidence So I. Think a piece of the case landed

105
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:50,925
Speaker 7:  in my bag or something.

106
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I like it broke. I was like, look at this, it's almost broken off.

107
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:55,965
Speaker 8:  Boom. And you're like, well,

108
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:56,965
Speaker 7:  There

109
00:07:56,965 --> 00:08:00,485
Speaker 8:  It goes. And then it and then it, it got vengeance. Alison. But yeah, So

110
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:04,165
Speaker 8:  I never, I never noticed that. It it does wobble the iPhone wobbles. Yeah.

111
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:08,925
Speaker 7:  I, and it, I don't do cases. So I. I have to remember that.

112
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:13,085
Speaker 7:  But every time I put the damn S 24 Ultra down on a

113
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:16,925
Speaker 7:  table and it was like, do do do do do typing out an email. Yeah. But the

114
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:17,885
Speaker 7:  iPhones too. Yeah.

115
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:21,965
Speaker 8:  Shocking lack of cases at The Pixel event by the way. I know. But that's

116
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:25,245
Speaker 8:  what honestly convinced me it was okay to, to take off the case that was

117
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:28,645
Speaker 8:  hurting me physically was like, well they're all fine.

118
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,765
Speaker 8:  This is, they didn't break their phones. I would

119
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:34,285
Speaker 6:  Say, do you? They're all, they all have what I would call unlimited access

120
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:38,085
Speaker 6:  to new phones. Yeah, I know. In a way that is not representative of most

121
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:38,245
Speaker 6:  people.

122
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:42,245
Speaker 7:  Oops, here's your phone back. No, the thing that really did

123
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:46,125
Speaker 7:  happen is we covered the event. We went to lunch and I

124
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,845
Speaker 7:  went to pull the phone out of my bag and just like straight

125
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:53,725
Speaker 7:  onto the concrete ground. Like there there is a

126
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:57,245
Speaker 7:  little like, scuff on the side of it, but you know what? It's fine. Yeah,

127
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:01,125
Speaker 7:  it was fine. It it, it worked totally fine. The panic quickly subsided.

128
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:05,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. We were all fine. That's good. Still fine. Yeah.

129
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:08,205
Speaker 6:  And I also feel like Google doing this with the camera bump kind of made

130
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:11,525
Speaker 6:  me think of when Apple tried really hard to make

131
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:15,925
Speaker 6:  the the mag safe circle into this sort of iconic thing

132
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:19,245
Speaker 6:  where it's like a thing apple's very good at is being like, oh, this weird

133
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:23,645
Speaker 6:  new thing that we have to do. We're gonna make it iconic. Like the

134
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:27,405
Speaker 6:  the dynamic island. They're like, no, this isn't just an engineering flaw

135
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:31,005
Speaker 6:  in our screen. It's a thing we did on purpose. It's magical.

136
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:35,805
Speaker 6:  Or the notch in the MacBook. They're like, no, this doesn't suck.

137
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:40,045
Speaker 6:  It's great. And I feel like, like Google's kind of doing

138
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:43,725
Speaker 6:  the same thing where they're like, yeah, we have a big ass camera bump. What

139
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:46,085
Speaker 6:  are you gonna do about it? You wanna fight? Yeah, check it

140
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,685
Speaker 7:  Out. and it turns out we don't, we don't wanna fight. We're just like, yeah,

141
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:49,565
Speaker 7:  it's fine. Yeah.

142
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:52,005
Speaker 6:  It's a big ass camera bump. We'll, we'll all live.

143
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,365
Speaker 7:  Just lean in. But

144
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:57,245
Speaker 6:  So like as as basic Android phone things

145
00:09:57,465 --> 00:10:01,115
Speaker 6:  go pixel's as good as anybody at this point, right? Like it's,

146
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,835
Speaker 6:  we we can talk about all the AI stuff, we can talk about all the other stuff.

147
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:07,435
Speaker 6:  But I feel like the The Pixel has been somewhere

148
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:10,915
Speaker 6:  between as good as and just behind the

149
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:14,995
Speaker 6:  Galaxy s line over the years. And this year seems

150
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:15,555
Speaker 6:  to be right there.

151
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:19,675
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. Like I put the S 24 Ultra kind of in a

152
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:23,635
Speaker 7:  class above all the rest if you want like absolutely everything. But

153
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:27,235
Speaker 7:  yeah, the pixels feel like they're right in that kind of second tier

154
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:29,515
Speaker 7:  with everybody else this time. That's

155
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:33,195
Speaker 6:  Really exciting. And are the the sizes are identical to me. The, like the

156
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:35,315
Speaker 6:  small pro is very enticing. Yeah.

157
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:39,515
Speaker 7:  That's the one I am loving because I would like,

158
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,355
Speaker 7:  throughout the year I'll switch back to, you know, a, a phone I've already

159
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:46,315
Speaker 7:  reviewed and I would switch back to The Pixel eight rather than the eight

160
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:50,275
Speaker 7:  Pro just 'cause I like the size better. And then you're sort of like, oh,

161
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:54,315
Speaker 7:  I'm giving up the telephoto lens, blah, blah, blah. So the eight pro

162
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:58,195
Speaker 7:  this time around is the size of the, the nine pro this time

163
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:02,075
Speaker 7:  around is the size of the eight last year and the nine this year.

164
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:05,955
Speaker 7:  There's a lot of phones. Yeah. So many phones. Yeah. But you don't give

165
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:09,875
Speaker 7:  up anything on the camera front as like the obvious things that have to

166
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,475
Speaker 7:  be different are different. Like the battery and the

167
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:17,555
Speaker 7:  screen resolution doesn't need to be quite as high, but it, it feels like

168
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:21,475
Speaker 7:  no compromises and I love it. I'm gonna keep coming back to it

169
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:22,275
Speaker 7:  this year.

170
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:25,795
Speaker 6:  How is the camera? I mean the, it was very funny looking at the photos in

171
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:29,635
Speaker 6:  your review and there are lots of 'em. They're very good. And so many of

172
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:33,595
Speaker 6:  the photos are like the, the before and the after is

173
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:36,955
Speaker 6:  like an AI horror show. But I, I found myself going back to the before photos

174
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:39,875
Speaker 6:  being like, oh, these are actually really nice photos. Like this thing, this

175
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,755
Speaker 6:  thing seems to take nice photos and it actually doesn't seem like it's

176
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,475
Speaker 6:  overprocessing the hell out of them in the way that both Apple and Samsung

177
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:52,675
Speaker 6:  have become prone to. Like, I I find myself gravitating towards the

178
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,605
Speaker 6:  sort of pixel version of a shot more and more over time here. And

179
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:59,725
Speaker 8:  Even when it processes it with like the low light stuff, it still looks

180
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,765
Speaker 8:  really good and clean versus everybody else. Yeah.

181
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It does a nice job.

182
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:08,965
Speaker 7:  I think it's The Pixel camera has kind of been like, on this more

183
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:13,165
Speaker 7:  consistent path where it started, like the early

184
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:16,885
Speaker 7:  pixel phones were kind of like too cool of a color

185
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:20,845
Speaker 7:  cast. I I didn't really like that. And they've like slowly kind

186
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:24,525
Speaker 7:  of corrected I think over the years while Samsung

187
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:28,605
Speaker 7:  and Apple have been in this very warm kind of like, let's

188
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:31,565
Speaker 7:  punch up the saturation sort of territory. And I think

189
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:34,565
Speaker 6:  Would, if everything looked the sickest, like I just imagine that's what

190
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:37,525
Speaker 6:  all those engineers sit around doing. Like, does this photo look sick? Not

191
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,925
Speaker 6:  sick enough. Like turn up the sick knob. It more

192
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:41,245
Speaker 7:  Needs more sick. Yeah.

193
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,365
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It feels like those have kind of gone like

194
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:50,525
Speaker 7:  almost too far in a direction. And The Pixel just kinda like, yeah,

195
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:54,445
Speaker 7:  there's there's some shadows here. We didn't blast them to

196
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,085
Speaker 7:  oblivion. I appreciate it.

197
00:12:57,715 --> 00:13:01,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I I want to love this phone. I really do. Like I I have,

198
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:05,645
Speaker 6:  I have been waiting for a good excuse to go back to The Pixel

199
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:09,605
Speaker 6:  because I'm deeply bored of my iPhone and it also has scratches all over

200
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:13,565
Speaker 6:  it that I didn't do anything to make happen and they frustrate me. So

201
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:16,445
Speaker 6:  I was like, maybe I'll buy a pixel. And Liam, our producer, bought a pixel

202
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:19,325
Speaker 6:  fold that I essentially bullied him into buying and I would like to join

203
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:22,565
Speaker 6:  him in this and this, it feels like this is a good pixel. Like we did, we

204
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:24,205
Speaker 6:  did a good pixel this year. Yeah. The

205
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,685
Speaker 8:  Pixel fold is nice.

206
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:30,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Which the one excited to try that thing. I don't have for review yet.

207
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:34,245
Speaker 7:  We all get to like touch it and play with it at the event, but it is shipping

208
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,205
Speaker 7:  later, so they haven't seated those reviews yet. But

209
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:42,405
Speaker 7:  I have an unprecedented number of VERGE staffers in my dms

210
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,725
Speaker 7:  being like, how's The Pixel

211
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:44,845
Speaker 6:  Fold. Interesting.

212
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like off the charts.

213
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,685
Speaker 7:  And my answer is like, it's good.

214
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:54,005
Speaker 6:  It's hot cold summer. You, you've been calling this like two years in a row

215
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:54,765
Speaker 6:  now it's great. And you,

216
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,645
Speaker 7:  This time I'm just making it happen.

217
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:58,245
Speaker 8:  You're bringing it back.

218
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,805
Speaker 6:  All right, well that's enough nice things to say about Google. Let's talk

219
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:04,525
Speaker 6:  about how Google is in the process of what I would say is potentially ruining

220
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:08,405
Speaker 6:  society altogether and just decimating the idea of

221
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,485
Speaker 6:  truth and, and shared knowledge and it

222
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:13,245
Speaker 7:  Just ledge and anything, David, it's just your memories. So

223
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:18,005
Speaker 6:  Allison, can you just, I, I have more thoughts about this than I

224
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:20,685
Speaker 6:  realized as we are coming into this. I wanna talk about all of this, but

225
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:24,325
Speaker 6:  can you just describe how the Reimagine AI feature

226
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,525
Speaker 6:  works and like how you use it in the context of a Pixel nine?

227
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:31,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah, so it's, it's right inside the Magic Editor

228
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:35,965
Speaker 7:  kind of tools that were on last year's phone.

229
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:39,885
Speaker 7:  So you open up a photo, it's in the Google Photos app. You tap

230
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,965
Speaker 7:  on edit, you tap on the little sparkly ai,

231
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:47,685
Speaker 7:  so you have to go get it. But like, then you do the thing where you circle

232
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:51,485
Speaker 7:  something in the scene or you tap on a subject and

233
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:55,885
Speaker 7:  that selects it. And then you get this new option that

234
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:59,245
Speaker 7:  says reimagine. And what's different from last year is like

235
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,845
Speaker 7:  last year you could just take things out or kind of like pick something up

236
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:06,645
Speaker 7:  and move it and change the size. This is just like kicking the door

237
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:10,445
Speaker 7:  down of generative AI and you just write in

238
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:14,445
Speaker 7:  a text prompt of what you want there and it

239
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,365
Speaker 7:  puts it in and there are some guardrails. So you can't put like

240
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:21,965
Speaker 7:  obviously gross stuff. But the thing

241
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:22,445
Speaker 7:  we,

242
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:24,885
Speaker 6:  I

243
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:24,925
Speaker 7:  Mean,

244
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,125
Speaker 7:  I mean You can, if you ask for a you to be a pool of eyeballs,

245
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:32,405
Speaker 7:  it'll make a pool of eyeballs and it gross

246
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:35,885
Speaker 6:  Google says there are guardrails. I would not say there is much evidence

247
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:37,725
Speaker 6:  in the world of their

248
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:41,845
Speaker 8:  I would say there are rails, guard rails that you have to be good at prompting.

249
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:45,205
Speaker 8:  'cause I'm not good at prompting. And I tried to get it to do dog vomit last

250
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:49,085
Speaker 8:  night and it just giving, kept giving me lime green bowls filled

251
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:53,045
Speaker 8:  with dog kibble. And I'm like, that's, that's, I asked

252
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:57,205
Speaker 8:  for liquid and I, like, I asked it to do like a ur sitting behind my

253
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:00,645
Speaker 8:  sister-in-law menacingly. And instead it was like, first it just did like,

254
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:05,045
Speaker 8:  just black, just darkness. Okay. Behind her it was

255
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:08,845
Speaker 8:  just like a black figure, like, like an absence of light figure. And I was

256
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:11,245
Speaker 8:  like, well that's creepy, but not what I wanted. And then it did just like

257
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:15,685
Speaker 8:  a creepy man in the corner and I was like, that's not a Minotaur. Oh

258
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,805
Speaker 8:  no. But it is creepy. I'll send that one to her.

259
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's not a mino,

260
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:23,565
Speaker 8:  That's what I wanted. Come on. So I'll say like,

261
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:28,015
Speaker 8:  I was really, really, really impressed with what you and Welch have been

262
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:31,455
Speaker 8:  able to do with it, but I have not had as much. Yeah.

263
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:35,815
Speaker 7:  And to be fair, we were, it started off

264
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:39,735
Speaker 7:  innocently. I wasn't putting dead bodies into my photos right off

265
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:43,735
Speaker 7:  the get go. But then we're kind of like, we're some of the

266
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:47,375
Speaker 7:  first people to really test this. We gotta push it and you,

267
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:52,295
Speaker 7:  you don't have to be super smart because we're not super smart to get

268
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:55,895
Speaker 7:  around these guardrails where you're kind of like,

269
00:16:56,475 --> 00:17:00,455
Speaker 7:  you say things in a different way and, and suddenly the AI is like, oh, okay.

270
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:04,535
Speaker 7:  And like whatever it's trained on knows exactly what a dead body

271
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:08,175
Speaker 7:  looks like. So it'll put that in your photo and you're like, oh God,

272
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:12,655
Speaker 7:  this is gross. and it was getting to the point where I was

273
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:16,335
Speaker 7:  sort of cringing every time I was putting in a prompt that was like

274
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:20,215
Speaker 7:  kind of ick, icky. I was like, oh, I hope it doesn't make

275
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:23,135
Speaker 7:  that. And some of the time it did and

276
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,455
Speaker 6:  It, what were your favorite ones that you got? Good or bad?

277
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:31,175
Speaker 6:  Favorite? Define any way you want. Oh yeah. What were the, what were your

278
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:32,535
Speaker 6:  favorite ones that you did? I

279
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:36,495
Speaker 7:  Got, okay, this one is one of Welch's, but I think it's brilliant. It's like

280
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:40,895
Speaker 7:  he's outside of some cute little cafe that says like, cafe

281
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:44,895
Speaker 7:  spaghetti and he put spaghetti on one of the tables, but

282
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:48,735
Speaker 7:  it's like a, like a waterfall of spaghetti in like mirror and a

283
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,725
Speaker 7:  sauce like spilling everywhere. Like that's just funny. You

284
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:56,365
Speaker 7:  can, You can do some funny stuff with this. And I plan to

285
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:59,565
Speaker 7:  keep terrorizing my family and friends with like

286
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:04,565
Speaker 7:  weird stuff. So it's, yeah, it's not like you,

287
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:08,525
Speaker 7:  you kind, you have to go outta your way to get it to do gross, weird,

288
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:11,205
Speaker 7:  maybe manipulative things, but I mean,

289
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:13,725
Speaker 8:  You got it to do. Is it they pronounced gooey ducks?

290
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:18,085
Speaker 7:  Oh God, yeah. Well kind of. I think there's

291
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:19,165
Speaker 7:  some kind of gooey duck filter.

292
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:23,165
Speaker 8:  It did not do it for me. I, I don't know if you broke it, but

293
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:24,165
Speaker 8:  if you've

294
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:27,565
Speaker 7:  Seen a gooey duck, it's kind of unmistakable and like

295
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:32,325
Speaker 7:  what it created. So it was a bowl of food of like

296
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:36,645
Speaker 7:  beautiful, like salad, watermelon, just like the

297
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:39,565
Speaker 7:  lighting is perfect. And I was like, put the grossest things in there, like

298
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:43,325
Speaker 7:  eyeballs or like, like rabbit's feet

299
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:48,285
Speaker 7:  and it did all that. But the gooey docs, I was trying to, I trying to

300
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:51,925
Speaker 7:  get it to make, you know, some questionable things and,

301
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:56,005
Speaker 7:  and it gave me what I describe as looked like raw thumbs

302
00:18:56,195 --> 00:19:00,125
Speaker 7:  that like don't have fingernails on them. And they were slimy like a little

303
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,685
Speaker 7:  bit slimy. So it just sort of, I dunno,

304
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:05,405
Speaker 7:  I don't know how to describe it.

305
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:09,405
Speaker 8:  When I tried gooey ducks, it did like, looked like

306
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:13,125
Speaker 8:  clams or something. Yeah. It was like, so something's here. And I was like,

307
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,885
Speaker 8:  no, that's not revolting enough. It's

308
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:18,285
Speaker 7:  Like the AI starts going down a road and there's a stop sign. Like, mm, no.

309
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:19,205
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I

310
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:22,965
Speaker 8:  Was like, no. Too revolting. And that's like vomit. I

311
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:26,845
Speaker 8:  couldn't, like, I was doing all sorts of different liquid prompts and

312
00:19:26,845 --> 00:19:28,325
Speaker 8:  it was just like bowl.

313
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:30,365
Speaker 7:  Keep

314
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:31,285
Speaker 8:  It outta the bowl.

315
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:35,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Sometimes it, it really does kind of put up a stop sign. Like

316
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:39,205
Speaker 7:  it, it'll tell you straight up, like you cannot generate that picture,

317
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:42,765
Speaker 7:  put in something else. You frigging weirdo people won't

318
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,445
Speaker 8:  Let you change people.

319
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:47,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's the big one. That's off limits. Like You can't selecting something

320
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:51,405
Speaker 7:  on a person, you can't like change someone's shoes or anything. This,

321
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:55,085
Speaker 7:  this is a good thing. This is a good guardrail. I think given what I've seen

322
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,165
Speaker 7:  of this tool, it,

323
00:19:57,165 --> 00:20:01,085
Speaker 8:  It's such a weird space to be in because on

324
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:01,605
Speaker 8:  the one hand

325
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:06,425
Speaker 8:  we're, we're here talking about how concerning it is to have unfettered access

326
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:10,065
Speaker 8:  to these tools. On the other hand, if I wanna put horns on someone,

327
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:14,545
Speaker 8:  I wanna put horns on someone and now I just have to like, I have to go to

328
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:18,505
Speaker 8:  Photoshop. I have to remember how layers work and, and that's not as fun.

329
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:19,425
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

330
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:23,185
Speaker 6:  Okay. I have become totally radicalized

331
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,065
Speaker 6:  by this phone on, on all of this stuff and, and truly I am, I have

332
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:32,025
Speaker 6:  reached a point where I am like, shut it all down. It's none of

333
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:35,745
Speaker 6:  this, this can be allowed. Throw out the baby with the bath water, like shut

334
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:39,345
Speaker 6:  it all down. and it, it's really what, what has

335
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:42,545
Speaker 6:  continued to do it for me, especially with The Pixel nine is not the, like

336
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:47,765
Speaker 6:  there was a great digital trend story that I think what he did was he got

337
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:51,445
Speaker 6:  it to show a picture of Barney firing an

338
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:55,445
Speaker 6:  AK of 47 at Elmo. It might have been the reverse of that, but I think it

339
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:56,125
Speaker 6:  was that. No, that's

340
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,005
Speaker 8:  It. No, that's, and

341
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,925
Speaker 6:  That is like in a certain way horrifying. But like, I

342
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,685
Speaker 6:  actually track that as like way less of a problem than some of the stuff

343
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:08,005
Speaker 6:  that Chris Welch has been just sort of relentlessly posting about the last

344
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:11,885
Speaker 6:  few days, which is just like, he just created, he

345
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:15,605
Speaker 6:  took a, a photo of an empty intersection in New York and with

346
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,925
Speaker 6:  one request made it look like there had been a bicycle accident there. Or

347
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:23,005
Speaker 6:  You can take a car with a dent and add the thing that dented it into the

348
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:26,605
Speaker 6:  photo even though it's not there. Like it's this unbelievably

349
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:31,005
Speaker 6:  mundane stuff that is so much more problematic to me than the fact

350
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,765
Speaker 6:  that You can like generate Nazi cartoon characters. Which again,

351
00:21:34,865 --> 00:21:38,085
Speaker 6:  is a thing that Google will let you do, but you can't have one without the

352
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:41,405
Speaker 6:  other. I'm increasingly convinced that like the idea of like, I

353
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:45,885
Speaker 6:  want to be able to insert myself into a photo with somebody

354
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:49,875
Speaker 6:  else. I get that. Right. Like one of the funny things

355
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,715
Speaker 6:  about my family is like my mom is always the one who takes the pictures and

356
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:55,435
Speaker 6:  so she's never in any of the family photos and she hates it, but she also

357
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:59,035
Speaker 6:  wants to be the one to take the photos that sucks. And like that is a problem

358
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:03,635
Speaker 6:  Google has solved with artificial intelligence. I will absolutely happily

359
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:08,115
Speaker 6:  sacrifice that to get rid of all this other stuff. Like we, it just

360
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:09,715
Speaker 6:  like shut it all down.

361
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:13,155
Speaker 8:  The thing is they kind of, all these tools are separated and I think, like

362
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:16,435
Speaker 8:  Alison, you talked about it in your review. It's, it's annoying from a user

363
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:20,075
Speaker 8:  perspective in that I did, I couldn't, I thought I didn't have, I had the,

364
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:23,195
Speaker 8:  the regular Pixel nine, I just thought I didn't have access to Reimagine.

365
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:27,275
Speaker 8:  And then Alison was like, it's over there. And, and I, and I found where

366
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:30,555
Speaker 8:  it was in the, in the app, like the stuff where people are making

367
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:36,005
Speaker 8:  Barney shooting Elmo, that's one tool, that's Pixel Studio. And

368
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:39,845
Speaker 8:  that one, like, that's where I tried to make Kirby and just made a sad balloon.

369
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:43,565
Speaker 8:  And and you can't create people in that one. And, and there's some pretty

370
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:46,925
Speaker 8:  strict guardrails except for around apparently all cartoon characters. Right.

371
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:51,045
Speaker 8:  And then there's reimagine. Would you have to go into the photos app,

372
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:54,925
Speaker 8:  click on edit and then click on the little thing to the point where I just

373
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,125
Speaker 8:  didn't find it. Kirby, you

374
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,165
Speaker 6:  Just tried really hard to make that sound like a lot of work. That is not

375
00:22:59,205 --> 00:22:59,645
Speaker 6:  a lot of work.

376
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,045
Speaker 8:  It's it's not a lot of work and it's not a lot of work, but there's, there's

377
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:05,645
Speaker 8:  a little friction there. But it is like, it's, it was hard to find right?

378
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:09,525
Speaker 8:  It wasn't natural. Whereas when you go to do Add Me, which is probably

379
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:13,605
Speaker 8:  the most, the least controversial of these features that's in the camera

380
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:17,405
Speaker 8:  app. Like you open the camera app because like I thought Reimagine was gonna

381
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:19,885
Speaker 8:  be on the camera app. That's kind of where my brain was logically. I was

382
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:23,205
Speaker 8:  like, oh, you're editing images, it'll be there. No, it's in this a whole

383
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:27,165
Speaker 8:  other place. and it was like, it was both frustrating to have to go to three

384
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:30,245
Speaker 8:  different apps to do all this stuff, but at the same time, that means those

385
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:34,085
Speaker 8:  aren't smooshed together. Like you could have Abi and just

386
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:38,045
Speaker 8:  get rid of Reimagine you could, you like, pixel Studio

387
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:40,285
Speaker 8:  is a whole ass app. You can just delete that

388
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:44,765
Speaker 6:  In this specific instance. Yes, I agree with that. Yeah. But I think we're

389
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:48,165
Speaker 6:  pretty clearly headed toward two things, which is one, all of those features

390
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:51,245
Speaker 6:  you just described being totally ubiquitous everywhere. Right? Like anything

391
00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:54,525
Speaker 6:  that is a camera is gonna have all of that stuff really fast. Yeah.

392
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:58,965
Speaker 6:  And B all of that stuff is going to be pushed

393
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:03,405
Speaker 6:  together, right? Like the, the, they're all, it's all gonna be in the photos

394
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:06,565
Speaker 6:  app. It just is. It's all gonna, and, and in the same way that you like press

395
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:10,045
Speaker 6:  the plus button to upload a photo, you'll be able to press the plus button

396
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:12,965
Speaker 6:  to generate a photo. And we're, we're gonna treat those two as the same thing.

397
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:17,365
Speaker 6:  All of this stuff is coming forward in the interface and is

398
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:20,805
Speaker 6:  coming together in a way that I think is like, feels sort of

399
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:25,365
Speaker 6:  in that, in Unstoppable at this moment and like has

400
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:28,005
Speaker 6:  to be stopped because I agree there are some of these things that are fine,

401
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:31,885
Speaker 6:  right? Like I think Adme is a little weird, but it actually seems like the

402
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:34,685
Speaker 6:  way that Google forces it to work 'cause you have to do it in the moment

403
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:36,805
Speaker 6:  and I think is is like largely fine. Yeah.

404
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:39,565
Speaker 8:  You can't dick around with it as much as I thought you were gonna be able

405
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:39,725
Speaker 8:  to.

406
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:44,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like fine. I will, I will let that one continue to

407
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:47,725
Speaker 6:  exist. It doesn't seem like it works all that well. Like it works sort of

408
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:51,165
Speaker 6:  passively fun, but it's kind of like you sloppily photoshopped yourself in,

409
00:24:52,015 --> 00:24:55,045
Speaker 6:  which I think it seems like what that should be. I'm, yeah, we

410
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:57,725
Speaker 8:  It's a royal family job is what we call it. Yeah, right.

411
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:01,485
Speaker 6:  It's it's the like Yes, I was also there, but it's very clear I was not in

412
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,125
Speaker 6:  this photo. Like I'm good with that. Yeah, I'm good with that. It was like,

413
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:08,045
Speaker 6:  what was the, what was the app that would take both a photo of the,

414
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:11,445
Speaker 6:  with both your front and back camera at the same time and then Stitch 'em

415
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:13,925
Speaker 6:  together? Add me? I forgot. Oh, it was front back, right? Was that what it

416
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:17,805
Speaker 6:  was called? I think it was called Front Back. Add me

417
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:21,245
Speaker 6:  feels like just like a better version of front back, like Yeah.

418
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:22,045
Speaker 8:  Front back.

419
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:26,165
Speaker 6:  Oh. But, but it, it just feels increasingly to me, like this road that we're

420
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:29,885
Speaker 6:  on is all of these things eventually becoming one tool and basically becoming

421
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:33,605
Speaker 6:  another swipe in the camera. Right. You'll go photo video,

422
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:37,765
Speaker 6:  but whatever cinematic mode, panorama

423
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:42,325
Speaker 6:  generative. And it's like, we cannot let that happen. I'm, I'm so,

424
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,405
Speaker 6:  so, so convinced we cannot let that happen.

425
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:48,045
Speaker 8:  Alison, do you think that's why they kept it out of the, the edit app and

426
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:51,965
Speaker 8:  they they kind of have it again, not su like, obvious

427
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:55,245
Speaker 8:  enough that it's pretty easy to find, but also I would, I took a week to

428
00:25:55,245 --> 00:25:55,645
Speaker 8:  find it.

429
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:59,245
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I I think it's deliberate and I've talked to,

430
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,765
Speaker 7:  you know, people on The Pixel camera team about like,

431
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:08,165
Speaker 7:  you know, where where do you decide where to put these things? And is

432
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:12,005
Speaker 7:  it, you know, is it a bigger problem if it's in the camera app or something

433
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:15,405
Speaker 7:  in the photos app and kind of philosophy is like

434
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:19,365
Speaker 7:  how, how sticky it is and how like

435
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:24,285
Speaker 7:  permanent like the effects are is more important than

436
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:28,085
Speaker 7:  like, did you go into the camera app to trigger this or what? I think the

437
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:32,005
Speaker 7:  way they have it now is very sensible. Like, I don't

438
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:35,885
Speaker 7:  think, you know, my, my mom's not gonna stumble across

439
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,445
Speaker 7:  to Reimagine trying to just like look at photos of her

440
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:43,205
Speaker 7:  grandchild or whatever. And, and I think that

441
00:26:43,665 --> 00:26:47,365
Speaker 7:  the thing to also note on, on the whole situation is like

442
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:52,005
Speaker 7:  the, the thing that people yell at us immediately is like, this has always

443
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:55,765
Speaker 7:  exist. You know, Photoshop exists, we've been able to do all this stuff

444
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,765
Speaker 7:  and there are way, way fewer barriers when it's

445
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:04,485
Speaker 7:  a phone and it's built into the phone and all you have to do is, is tap

446
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:07,605
Speaker 7:  on some stuff. And the other thing that

447
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:12,245
Speaker 7:  we, that was really troubling to us as we dug into it was

448
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:17,125
Speaker 7:  the, the photo reimagined stuff has

449
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:20,925
Speaker 7:  a metadata tag that says made with Google ai.

450
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:25,565
Speaker 7:  That's the extent of it. The Pixel studio stuff, which is fully

451
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:29,805
Speaker 7:  synthetic gets a more robust, like kind of embedded,

452
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:34,485
Speaker 7:  you don't see it, but it's a watermark that will kind of carry across, you

453
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:37,445
Speaker 7:  know, it's syn I shot Yeah. Syn id which

454
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:40,845
Speaker 6:  Google and DeepMind have made like a lot of noise about like, this is supposed

455
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:44,445
Speaker 6:  to be a gigantic industry standard that makes all of this stuff work and

456
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:44,965
Speaker 6:  Okay. Yeah.

457
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:48,885
Speaker 8:  And they only apply it to the one where You can make an image of

458
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:49,365
Speaker 8:  Barney shooting

459
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:51,645
Speaker 6:  The one that is Elly fake. Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:54,325
Speaker 7:  Like, I didn't need it like, oh, it's

461
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:54,805
Speaker 6:  A water

462
00:27:54,955 --> 00:27:55,245
Speaker 7:  Like

463
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:57,645
Speaker 6:  That. It's Barney shooting Elmo. God. Okay.

464
00:27:57,715 --> 00:28:00,845
Speaker 7:  It's like, oh, I can't believe believe they're actually fighting. Yeah. No.

465
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,765
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I feel like that's completely backwards. Like, I wanna know

466
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:08,645
Speaker 7:  that something has been added to this, this real

467
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:11,965
Speaker 7:  photo, you know, with these synthetic tools,

468
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:16,525
Speaker 7:  not the other way around. It's, it's strange. It's such a weird

469
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:16,765
Speaker 7:  time.

470
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:21,245
Speaker 6:  I think philosophically there's actually a reason Google wouldn't do

471
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:24,045
Speaker 6:  that. Like part of the reason I I find all of this so concerning is that

472
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:27,805
Speaker 6:  everything Google has said publicly feels very flippant

473
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:31,605
Speaker 6:  about this. Right? Like Google's answer I think to Wired was that, you know,

474
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:35,445
Speaker 6:  it's not about photos, it's about making your memories match your memory.

475
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:36,445
Speaker 6:  And it's like, what?

476
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:40,805
Speaker 8:  I mean that's what we heard constantly, I think at, at The Pixel event

477
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:44,605
Speaker 8:  was they said, no, this isn't about your photo. Your photo is a thing you

478
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:48,405
Speaker 8:  take and and it's, it's archival, right? This is about the memory.

479
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:52,365
Speaker 8:  This is, this is isn't supposed to be for the journalists shooting the

480
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:56,285
Speaker 8:  thing. It's supposed to be for the parent who wants to fix things for

481
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:59,485
Speaker 8:  their kids. And it's like, okay, well yeah, that makes sense. But you've

482
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:02,405
Speaker 8:  also given it to the journalists and you've also given it to all of the people

483
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:06,845
Speaker 8:  who are perpetuating misinformation online. And that is a

484
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,725
Speaker 8:  bigger group than we would like because people love to chase cloud

485
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:11,845
Speaker 8:  online with fake shit.

486
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:15,645
Speaker 6:  It also doesn't make sense. That makes sense. If the feature you're introducing

487
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:19,485
Speaker 6:  is red eye reduction, right? Yeah. That sure fine. If you

488
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:22,565
Speaker 6:  wanna release a thing that makes people's eyes look like they're open when

489
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:25,085
Speaker 6:  they're not, I honestly have no problem with that. And Neela is not here

490
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:27,925
Speaker 6:  to yell at me about that and he would And that's fine. I have no problem

491
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:29,085
Speaker 6:  with that. We're

492
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:30,165
Speaker 8:  Gonna the whole spectrum here.

493
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:33,845
Speaker 6:  Well, and that, that to me is like, this is where I come to the, the only

494
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:37,925
Speaker 6:  solution is to burn it all down thing. Yeah. 'cause like you can't, I I have

495
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:41,645
Speaker 6:  not yet seen a way to do a little bit of, of it without

496
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:45,085
Speaker 6:  inevitably doing all of it. And I think if we do all of it, we are somewhere

497
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:45,485
Speaker 6:  awful.

498
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's Pandora's box. Yes.

499
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:51,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I think at this point it's like, J shut the box and set it on fire

500
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:54,205
Speaker 6:  and let's all just pretend none of this ever happened and everything will

501
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:54,405
Speaker 6:  be fine.

502
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:58,485
Speaker 8:  David, would you feel more comfortable if it was

503
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,845
Speaker 8:  like an app that you had to download? So you had to go, you

504
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:06,205
Speaker 8:  had to find it in the play store, you had to download it and sign in, and

505
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,725
Speaker 8:  then you could do all of this stuff. Would that make it feel a little better?

506
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:12,485
Speaker 6:  A little, yeah. I mean, I think I I Allison to your point, we, the biggest

507
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:15,205
Speaker 6:  pushback we get when we talk about this stuff is people being like, this

508
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:18,485
Speaker 6:  has been, it's been possible to manipulate photos forever. And that's true.

509
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:23,165
Speaker 6:  And Sarah Jung wrote a great piece for us about this, this week that

510
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:27,325
Speaker 6:  I think really captures a lot of this. But like in so many ways,

511
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:30,885
Speaker 6:  the story of the tech industry is making a thing slightly more convenient

512
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:34,525
Speaker 6:  and you actually change everything. Like what Uber did to the taxi industry

513
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:38,365
Speaker 6:  was just make it slightly more convenient. Like the, the idea of things

514
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:42,245
Speaker 6:  being fewer steps away from you and, and they become like a step change

515
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:46,205
Speaker 6:  More popular is real. Like yeah, there's an ev there's

516
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:50,165
Speaker 6:  evidence of that everywhere you look and So I think, yeah, if, if they made

517
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:53,685
Speaker 6:  it an app that you had to download, I would be slightly less

518
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:57,725
Speaker 6:  alarmed if they made it an app you had to download that costs $700 and

519
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:00,845
Speaker 6:  required like a master's degree to learn how to use successfully. So I would

520
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:04,965
Speaker 6:  also be less alarmed. I I really do think that like, the

521
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:08,565
Speaker 6:  fact that it's a separate app right now is a good thing. I suspect given

522
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,085
Speaker 6:  the way that Google talks about this, that that has much more to do with

523
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:14,925
Speaker 6:  the fact that this is new than the fact that Google has taken

524
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:18,685
Speaker 6:  some moral stance about ai. Totally, totally agree. I don't there's any evidence

525
00:31:18,685 --> 00:31:22,645
Speaker 6:  to suggest that Google thinks it's a good thing for the world to keep

526
00:31:22,645 --> 00:31:25,005
Speaker 6:  this out of people's hands. Like nothing.

527
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:28,245
Speaker 8:  They want it in people's hands, right? Like to the, to the point of the,

528
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:29,565
Speaker 8:  their philosophy is this now.

529
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:33,045
Speaker 6:  Right? So why wouldn't Google find more and more ways to bring it forward?

530
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:36,205
Speaker 6:  Like you, you're gonna get to a point where you're like, Hey Gemini, take

531
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:40,125
Speaker 6:  a photo of this, but insert a car crash into it and it will,

532
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:43,365
Speaker 6:  it will produce that photo. The original photo that you take will include

533
00:31:43,365 --> 00:31:44,765
Speaker 6:  that. Like, why, why won't

534
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:46,845
Speaker 8:  We get that? Well, you're gonna have to actually say it, but take a photo

535
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:51,085
Speaker 8:  of this bicycle mangled next to a car

536
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:51,885
Speaker 8:  with a dent.

537
00:31:52,065 --> 00:31:55,845
Speaker 6:  No, it has that already. It's good. It can, it can put a

538
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:58,925
Speaker 6:  giraffe into the photo of my backyard. I could have a giraffe in my backyard.

539
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:02,765
Speaker 6:  Like all it needs is the photo of my backyard, which is the easy part, right?

540
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,925
Speaker 6:  Like I, I just, I have reached this point now where like, I, I don't know

541
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:11,045
Speaker 6:  what else we can do except just shut it all down,

542
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:14,725
Speaker 6:  which is why like the, this the, the bill in California right now is so

543
00:32:14,925 --> 00:32:17,245
Speaker 6:  fascinating, right? 'cause the question is like, who is responsible for when

544
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:19,005
Speaker 6:  all of this is horribly wrong? And

545
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:24,365
Speaker 6:  if it passes and we get down this road where all of a sudden

546
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:28,605
Speaker 6:  the companies that make these tools are responsible for what happens with

547
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:32,565
Speaker 6:  them. Ooh. That gets it, it gets so messy and we end up with a weird

548
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,565
Speaker 6:  section two 30 thing all over again. Who is responsible for mean things that

549
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:40,365
Speaker 6:  people say on the internet, but like, if Google were responsible

550
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:43,605
Speaker 6:  for every single thing that reimagined produced, you think Google would've

551
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:43,965
Speaker 6:  launched this?

552
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:44,725
Speaker 8:  No.

553
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:46,325
Speaker 6:  The thing, not a chance.

554
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:51,405
Speaker 7:  The thing they told us when we were like, Hey, so we've been able to use

555
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:55,045
Speaker 7:  your tool to make all these like pretty disturbing things. What do you think

556
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:58,485
Speaker 7:  about that? And they were like, oh, we have these terms of service

557
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:02,125
Speaker 7:  and that's a violation of the policy. It's like,

558
00:33:02,955 --> 00:33:06,445
Speaker 6:  Okay, no, it's, no, it's it's worse than that. It's worse than that. The,

559
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:10,485
Speaker 6:  the statement that they've given to everybody, including us from Alex Moria,

560
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:14,325
Speaker 6:  Google says, we design our generative AI tools to

561
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,045
Speaker 6:  respect the intent of user prompts. And that means they may create content

562
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:20,645
Speaker 6:  that may offend when instructed by the user to do so. That says in as many

563
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,765
Speaker 6:  words, it's your fault not ours. Mm.

564
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:25,605
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Yeah. and it does, we

565
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:28,445
Speaker 6:  Didn't do it. You did it. Guns don't kill people. People kill people,

566
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:31,685
Speaker 8:  Right? And I, I think they're coming at this from the, they're, they're thinking,

567
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:34,925
Speaker 8:  oh, we're just like Photoshop. Because to to everybody who comments

568
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:39,565
Speaker 8:  that that's true, like Photoshop can do all of this and probably do it

569
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:42,925
Speaker 8:  be, and in many cases do it better. Photoshop is hard

570
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:47,485
Speaker 8:  and this is so easy and Google is kind of ignoring

571
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:50,725
Speaker 8:  that ease. Like they're, they're happy to talk about it on stage. They're

572
00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:54,125
Speaker 8:  happy to talk about it in an advertisements and, and profiles and whatever.

573
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:56,485
Speaker 8:  They're not happy to talk about it when we ask them. Right?

574
00:33:56,485 --> 00:34:00,045
Speaker 6:  The ease is a feature, not a bug. Unless you ask Google about how easy it's,

575
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,205
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And then, and then they're like, well, yeah, that's not the problem.

576
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:05,725
Speaker 8:  And it's like, no, no, that is actually the problem. You've increased access

577
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:07,195
Speaker 8:  here. Yeah.

578
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,155
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And like, it, it's,

579
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:10,635
Speaker 8:  This

580
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:14,195
Speaker 6:  Is so weird to me because it is like, to your point, Alison, like some of

581
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:17,595
Speaker 6:  the same stuff that Google is building to make it so that like the

582
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:22,035
Speaker 6:  dark scenes that you shoot on your phone look better,

583
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:25,475
Speaker 6:  which I think everyone agrees is a good thing, right? Like night sight is

584
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:28,715
Speaker 6:  awesome and night sight is ai, right? Like that's just, that is what it is.

585
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:33,355
Speaker 6:  How you stop that before it gets to, I

586
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:36,715
Speaker 6:  can insert unbelievably compelling lies into every single one of my photos.

587
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,595
Speaker 6:  And I think the, the thing that Sarah wrote in her piece, which we'll link

588
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:44,395
Speaker 6:  in the show notes, and I've gotten some crap for forgetting to link things

589
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,555
Speaker 6:  in the show notes, and I'm very sorry and I will start, I will do better

590
00:34:46,555 --> 00:34:50,515
Speaker 6:  from now on, is that so much of like, life

591
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:54,315
Speaker 6:  is just having photos, right? Like I have a, I have a leak in my ceiling,

592
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:57,955
Speaker 6:  I take a photo and I send it to somebody. I have, there's a, there i I got

593
00:34:57,955 --> 00:35:00,555
Speaker 6:  in a car accident a couple weeks ago and the very first thing I did was walk

594
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:03,395
Speaker 6:  around my car and take pictures of it. What if you can't trust those pictures

595
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:06,595
Speaker 6:  anymore? What if somebody can point to them and say those might be ai and

596
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:09,755
Speaker 6:  all of a sudden those pictures are meaningless. Like we are entering a phase

597
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:13,475
Speaker 6:  where it's going to be so easy and only going to get easier

598
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,955
Speaker 6:  to make this incredibly mundane stuff. Like we don't think about how

599
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:21,275
Speaker 6:  much a part of our lives photos are. We talk a lot about politics and like

600
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:25,275
Speaker 6:  really high stakes stuff, but the what if the low stakes photos don't count

601
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:25,955
Speaker 6:  anymore?

602
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:30,595
Speaker 8:  I I was just realized the, the one thing we can still count on

603
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:34,595
Speaker 8:  is all of the insurance companies are gonna band together and be like, absolutely

604
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:38,565
Speaker 8:  not. Yeah. Yeah. Because 'cause like, like that's the one where it's

605
00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:42,085
Speaker 8:  like, oh yeah, that's a lot of money for them. If David's just adding a bunch

606
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,725
Speaker 8:  of dents to the car, like gimme more money. Yeah.

607
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,165
Speaker 6:  What if the insurance company can refuse my claim because they don't have

608
00:35:47,165 --> 00:35:48,125
Speaker 6:  to believe my photos. Right.

609
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:51,445
Speaker 7:  Or it was shot on a Pixel nine and they're like, oh, we don't accept those.

610
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:52,285
Speaker 7:  Right.

611
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:55,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like you might have stripped out the metadata. It's only one line of

612
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:58,925
Speaker 6:  metadata. It's not that hard to do. Yeah. People are more motivated to get

613
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:02,965
Speaker 6:  around these things than they get credit for, for so, so many

614
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:06,925
Speaker 6:  reasons. Alright. Buy The Pixel nine. Just don't do any of that.

615
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,045
Speaker 6:  I think the takeaway be

616
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:10,085
Speaker 7:  Good. Don't do evil.

617
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:10,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

618
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:12,445
Speaker 8:  You don't be a dick. Yeah. Weird.

619
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:16,165
Speaker 6:  Don't be evil. Somebody should really use that as a That's a good tagline

620
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:17,285
Speaker 6:  for some days. Yeah. It rings a bell.

621
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:22,605
Speaker 6:  All right Allison, we gotta take a break and we're gonna let you go. We're

622
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:25,685
Speaker 6:  gonna come back and we're gonna talk about a bunch of streaming shenanigans

623
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,205
Speaker 6:  because there are endless streaming shenanigans. We'll be right back.

624
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,425
Speaker 8:  assets and I would

625
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:55,225
Speaker 8:  for parts and those would be very lucrative parts, but it is much more

626
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:57,145
Speaker 8:  potentially powerful altogether.

627
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:01,025
Speaker 6:  Richard, I'm, I'm really enjoying the, the theory of a pro nepo baby

628
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:05,705
Speaker 6:  economy. Yeah. That, that we, we just demand. It's by we give things to

629
00:41:05,705 --> 00:41:09,105
Speaker 6:  the Nepo babies, but we demand that they spend all their money on those things.

630
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:10,545
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I really love this for them.

631
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:14,465
Speaker 13:  And, and I love this round of news because it brings back Ed Brolin and

632
00:41:14,465 --> 00:41:17,465
Speaker 13:  Jr. Who I didn't know was still in, in, in the league at all. Who is

633
00:41:17,465 --> 00:41:17,705
Speaker 6:  This person

634
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:22,625
Speaker 13:  He is, if you're like me and you've read like all of

635
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,905
Speaker 13:  the books about ESPN and Disney and all of the Disney Wars and these guys

636
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:28,945
Speaker 13:  have all the fun and all these kind of entertainment industry books about

637
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:32,145
Speaker 13:  the nineties and two thousands and all, I guess going back to the eighties,

638
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:35,405
Speaker 13:  he's one of those figures who pops up, he's a heir to a liquor fortune,

639
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:39,525
Speaker 13:  I think. Mm. And has bought his way into

640
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:43,125
Speaker 13:  media companies all over the place. and it is currently running

641
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:45,645
Speaker 13:  is currently I think a chairman of Fuo or

642
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:47,645
Speaker 8:  Yep. Chairperson of fubu. Currently

643
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:52,965
Speaker 6:  Fuo famously now in a gigantic fight with most of the

644
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:56,885
Speaker 6:  rest of Hollywood over venue sports. There's just only

645
00:41:56,885 --> 00:42:00,725
Speaker 6:  12 people in Hollywood. I think is like, the main important thing to

646
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:03,885
Speaker 6:  remember is that this is a tiny industry and everybody has worked everywhere

647
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:06,845
Speaker 6:  and they all, they're all the companies are run by the same four people

648
00:42:07,385 --> 00:42:08,485
Speaker 8:  Air the Seagram fortune.

649
00:42:09,345 --> 00:42:09,565
Speaker 6:  Oh,

650
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:13,565
Speaker 8:  He really has been like, he was CEO of the Warner Music Group.

651
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:18,485
Speaker 8:  He's just been all, he, he's very involved with Seagram, chairman of

652
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:22,165
Speaker 8:  Vindy Universal, like did a little Broadway

653
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:25,085
Speaker 8:  producing Man Loves Media.

654
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:30,805
Speaker 6:  I mean it, but it like bigger picture. It really seems

655
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:34,605
Speaker 6:  increasingly, like right now, like Netflix is good,

656
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:39,125
Speaker 6:  just be Netflix. The games thing seems to be slowly starting to work.

657
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:43,365
Speaker 6:  That's like Netflix is fine, is it? And then everybody else is just pure

658
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:47,285
Speaker 6:  anarchy right now. Like Disney is starting its succession plan again,

659
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:51,205
Speaker 6:  canceling shows. Alex, the other thing I need you to explain to me is why

660
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,765
Speaker 6:  everyone was so sad that the accolade got canceled. Everybody as far as I

661
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:57,205
Speaker 6:  know, hated the accolade to the point where I didn't even watch it because

662
00:42:57,205 --> 00:42:59,925
Speaker 6:  everybody thought it was bad, but then everybody was up in arms that it was

663
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:00,925
Speaker 6:  canceled this week. Yeah.

664
00:43:00,965 --> 00:43:03,685
Speaker 8:  I I would like, if we wanna talk, pivot over to Acolyte, the reason people

665
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:07,485
Speaker 8:  are mad about that is because the same thing happened with the

666
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:11,285
Speaker 8:  Marvels. The same thing happens with any woman or person of color

667
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:15,485
Speaker 8:  led property that is really attractive to nerds. You get a small

668
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:18,445
Speaker 8:  portion of people who are just tired of nerd shit. And, and I love you all

669
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:22,365
Speaker 8:  live your lives. You get a larger person of people who are nerds and

670
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:25,805
Speaker 8:  want nerd shit, but they only want to if it looks like them. And they tend

671
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:29,645
Speaker 8:  to all be white dudes. And, and those people are really good at being really,

672
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:33,445
Speaker 8:  really loud. So the people who are just like, oh, I'm, I'll watch this. They're

673
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:37,325
Speaker 8:  not out there tweeting. But in the case of the acolyte it people

674
00:43:37,325 --> 00:43:39,805
Speaker 8:  are really bad that it got canceled because they're really concerned that

675
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:42,885
Speaker 8:  they're gonna do the same thing they did, did Willow, which was excellent

676
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:46,125
Speaker 8:  and shouldn't have been pulled from the service, but nobody watched it and

677
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,765
Speaker 8:  they're afraid that they're gonna pull this one from Disney plus. 'cause

678
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:52,125
Speaker 8:  nobody watched it like that. That was the thing. It it just got bad ratings.

679
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:52,845
Speaker 8:  Nobody watched it.

680
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:54,405
Speaker 6:  So was it good though?

681
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:55,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah,

682
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:59,165
Speaker 6:  Because I'm, I'm super sympathetic to that entire argument. If it

683
00:43:59,165 --> 00:44:02,045
Speaker 8:  Was all about what if these twins

684
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:06,445
Speaker 8:  who are really powerful in the force, one of them goes and goes

685
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:10,285
Speaker 8:  fully Jedi, then realizes Jedi suck and then

686
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:14,205
Speaker 8:  slowly gets to seduce to the dark side by Manny Jacinto's arms

687
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:15,245
Speaker 8:  and like,

688
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:16,645
Speaker 6:  I'm really enjoying Richard's

689
00:44:16,645 --> 00:44:17,845
Speaker 8:  Face. Wouldn't wanna watch that. You described

690
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:18,245
Speaker 6:  It. Why

691
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:19,605
Speaker 13:  Wasn't that the trailer I would watch would've watched?

692
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:23,125
Speaker 8:  Right. Like, it it really is like the whole time he's all like, oh no, I've,

693
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:27,045
Speaker 8:  I've removed my shirt and I'm flexing right now. Now I've got a lights saber.

694
00:44:27,045 --> 00:44:31,005
Speaker 8:  And you're like, yeah, this rules. And we, we we were robbed

695
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:31,565
Speaker 8:  basically.

696
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:34,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That is the single most compelling argument for the accolade that I've

697
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:35,285
Speaker 6:  ever heard.

698
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:37,205
Speaker 8:  I think that's, they just shown his

699
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:41,165
Speaker 13:  Arms, I feel like paid for that second or third or however many seasons

700
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:44,965
Speaker 13:  they've had of the Bounty Hunter show. Right. Of Bob Fit. Because we

701
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:47,085
Speaker 13:  got kind of tired of Star Wars after a point. Yeah.

702
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:50,525
Speaker 8:  And, and, and we see this again and again and again. There's the, the combat,

703
00:44:50,715 --> 00:44:53,645
Speaker 8:  like You can have fatigue. You can have angry,

704
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:58,325
Speaker 8:  racist, sexist fan boys. You can't have both. And right now

705
00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:02,125
Speaker 8:  they have both. So anytime there is a project that doesn't speak to those

706
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:05,405
Speaker 8:  racist, sexist fan boys, that that just, there's a to the

707
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:09,405
Speaker 8:  bottom drops out of the audience because everybody else is tired of it. And

708
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:12,725
Speaker 8:  even if you say, no, no, this time it's good. You have to say it in a very

709
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:16,165
Speaker 8:  specific way. And they struggle to market it over and over and over again.

710
00:45:16,165 --> 00:45:17,485
Speaker 8:  Because I keep seeing now everybody's like,

711
00:45:17,505 --> 00:45:20,805
Speaker 13:  You need to have enough volume to drown out certain things. Yeah. And, and

712
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:22,765
Speaker 13:  if that volume goes away suddenly that's all that's left.

713
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,005
Speaker 8:  Right. And and we saw this, like I said, we saw the exact same thing with

714
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:28,565
Speaker 8:  the Marvels and now everybody's like, Hey, did you see the Marvels? That's

715
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:31,605
Speaker 8:  actually really good. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, it was really good. Just

716
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:35,365
Speaker 8:  everybody was tired of superheroes when it came out. So, and it did have

717
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,645
Speaker 8:  some stupid parts, but everybody was mainly tired of superheroes. And then

718
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:42,285
Speaker 8:  a whole bunch of other people were like, but you stars girls. That's exactly

719
00:45:42,285 --> 00:45:45,645
Speaker 8:  what you sound like when you complain like that. People, just to be clear,

720
00:45:46,085 --> 00:45:47,085
Speaker 8:  I wanna insult you

721
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:50,605
Speaker 6:  Every time we hear that now, just take that clip and just play it in response

722
00:45:50,605 --> 00:45:53,325
Speaker 6:  to Yeah. Whoever tweets mean things about these shows.

723
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:58,805
Speaker 6:  So, but, but like this is all part of the sort of bigger, like what

724
00:45:58,805 --> 00:46:02,485
Speaker 6:  is going on inside of these streaming services thing that I keep

725
00:46:02,485 --> 00:46:06,085
Speaker 6:  coming back to is like, it, it just seems like outside of Netflix,

726
00:46:06,135 --> 00:46:09,965
Speaker 6:  which I think can afford to just throw everything at everybody

727
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:11,645
Speaker 6:  and some of it will stick and it'll be fine.

728
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:17,205
Speaker 6:  Like Disney can't afford to make this

729
00:46:17,395 --> 00:46:21,365
Speaker 6:  many bad Star Wars shows, right. That people don't watch. And

730
00:46:21,985 --> 00:46:25,565
Speaker 6:  now Disney is like back in succession planning, they just announced the new

731
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:29,325
Speaker 6:  succession committee to who for whoever is going to next be fired

732
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:33,245
Speaker 6:  by Bob Iger two years after they're given the job. Like, I

733
00:46:33,245 --> 00:46:37,205
Speaker 6:  don't know, it just, there's so much just like swirling chaos inside of all

734
00:46:37,205 --> 00:46:38,125
Speaker 6:  of these things. Right now, I

735
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:41,845
Speaker 8:  Would say that Hollywood is in one of its most

736
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:45,605
Speaker 8:  difficult moments, like more difficult the the pandemic, particularly

737
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:48,765
Speaker 8:  all these streamers and stuff. Because when you look at, when you look at

738
00:46:48,785 --> 00:46:52,445
Speaker 8:  who, who's in the field, you've got like Apple, they don't care. They can

739
00:46:52,445 --> 00:46:55,685
Speaker 8:  fart out these things and, and they'll do fine. So you've got Apple, they,

740
00:46:55,685 --> 00:46:58,165
Speaker 8:  they don't make a whole lot of shows. They put a lot of money into them,

741
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:02,045
Speaker 8:  but they don't make a whole lot. And they're struggling in the

742
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:05,165
Speaker 8:  movie business. All of their movies are bombs, but their TV shows great,

743
00:47:05,545 --> 00:47:09,125
Speaker 8:  get a lot of reviews. But whatever Apple, you've got Amazon

744
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:13,445
Speaker 8:  actually the second largest streamer and, and they're doing just fine. They've

745
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:16,485
Speaker 8:  got sports rights now they, they have advertising so you don't even have

746
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:19,805
Speaker 8:  to pay for it really. You can just like pop in and start watching like

747
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:24,125
Speaker 8:  Amazon's doing fine. And they also are Amazon. So they've got all of

748
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:27,405
Speaker 8:  this other stuff to make money for them. Like AWS and Amazon.

749
00:47:27,985 --> 00:47:31,925
Speaker 8:  And then you have like the non-tech ones. You have Warner Brothers who just

750
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:35,845
Speaker 8:  wrote down all of their broadcasts, network networks. You have

751
00:47:35,845 --> 00:47:39,085
Speaker 8:  Paramount who just wrote down all of their broadcast networks. You have Disney

752
00:47:39,305 --> 00:47:43,165
Speaker 8:  who didn't and probably will soon write down all of their networks. And

753
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:46,765
Speaker 8:  that's because all the broadcast stuff was supporting everybody and supporting

754
00:47:46,885 --> 00:47:50,405
Speaker 8:  'em through this streaming moment because they knew broadcast was going away

755
00:47:50,405 --> 00:47:52,645
Speaker 8:  and streaming was coming. And they're like, okay, we have to get through

756
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:56,325
Speaker 8:  this. But the broadcast died faster than they

757
00:47:56,565 --> 00:48:00,285
Speaker 8:  expected. One of the few exceptions is NBC Peacock,

758
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:04,365
Speaker 8:  they're also struggling, but they did a really good job with the Olympics.

759
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:05,205
Speaker 6:  They did.

760
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:09,245
Speaker 8:  They like, they showed what happens when a really smart

761
00:48:09,355 --> 00:48:13,245
Speaker 8:  broadcaster programs really well on these platforms and it

762
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:16,725
Speaker 8:  worked and they, they did really, really well. How long that lasts,

763
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:20,365
Speaker 8:  how quickly those people churn. That's, that's all other story.

764
00:48:20,755 --> 00:48:23,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The the Olympics are unfortunately over. Yeah.

765
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:25,165
Speaker 8:  Which is you get two weeks tough

766
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:25,645
Speaker 6:  Times for Netflix.

767
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:28,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Or tough times for Peacock rather. Yeah.

768
00:48:28,665 --> 00:48:31,165
Speaker 13:  No, no one else is watching Diamond League. We're not coming back to the

769
00:48:31,165 --> 00:48:33,205
Speaker 13:  Paralympics. They're about to start, come on, let's, let's go, let's keep

770
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:33,405
Speaker 13:  this going.

771
00:48:33,835 --> 00:48:37,405
Speaker 6:  That new Steph Curry show on Peacock, that seems like it's awful. Like really

772
00:48:37,405 --> 00:48:38,405
Speaker 6:  great times for Peacock.

773
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:42,525
Speaker 13:  I think the thing about Netflix is it turns out that basic cable for

774
00:48:42,555 --> 00:48:45,925
Speaker 13:  15 to $20 a month is a pretty good idea. Yeah. Yeah.

775
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:48,095
Speaker 8:  That's

776
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:51,455
Speaker 6:  It. And Netflix did it, right? Like I think, I think more than people realized,

777
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:55,295
Speaker 6:  certainly more than I realized until very recently, Netflix

778
00:48:56,235 --> 00:49:00,015
Speaker 6:  can be that, right? Like if you, if you have a reasonably steady

779
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:03,935
Speaker 6:  run of very good things, and then just an

780
00:49:04,215 --> 00:49:08,105
Speaker 6:  infinite supply of like background noise, You can win.

781
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:11,905
Speaker 6:  And for 20 bucks a month, that's essentially what Netflix has. Like, and,

782
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:15,785
Speaker 6:  and as long as it keeps having those periodic wins, which it

783
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:19,745
Speaker 6:  continues to do, it's gonna be very hard to supplant that. and

784
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:23,705
Speaker 8:  It's gotten a lot more savage about its cancellations too. Yes. Right?

785
00:49:23,705 --> 00:49:27,505
Speaker 8:  Like, like it is not afraid. Disney Plus was pretty, pretty

786
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:31,265
Speaker 8:  timid about canceling things, which is why we got three seasons of Mandalorian

787
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:35,345
Speaker 8:  and the, the entire season of Boba Fat. Why?

788
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:39,465
Speaker 8:  But, but like Disney's gotten a little more aggressive about it and Disney's,

789
00:49:39,465 --> 00:49:43,105
Speaker 8:  you know, pulling from, from Warner Brothers playbook of like, okay, the

790
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,545
Speaker 8:  show doesn't get a lot of views. We're gonna pull it. We are gonna then scrap

791
00:49:46,545 --> 00:49:49,905
Speaker 8:  the entire show because we don't wanna have to pay the tax. We just wanna

792
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:53,665
Speaker 8:  write it off as a loss. That's what happened with Willow. That may be what

793
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:55,865
Speaker 8:  happens with the acolyte. And that, I think that's where so much of that

794
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:56,505
Speaker 8:  tension is because

795
00:49:58,445 --> 00:50:02,225
Speaker 8:  you like archival purposes. Sometimes people do like the show and they just

796
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:05,065
Speaker 8:  wanna watch it, put it out on DVD, but that's expensive and they don't wanna

797
00:50:05,065 --> 00:50:05,265
Speaker 8:  do it.

798
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:08,625
Speaker 6:  Well, and I think the, the thing you said about the broadcast piece of it

799
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:11,585
Speaker 6:  is really important because the, the bet for so long was that

800
00:50:12,335 --> 00:50:16,025
Speaker 6:  they could just invest and lose money and make mistakes and have it all go

801
00:50:16,025 --> 00:50:19,865
Speaker 6:  wrong. Because this like Money Fountain on the other side would

802
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:23,825
Speaker 6:  pay for it. Yeah. and it would go down and it seemed reasonably like

803
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:26,705
Speaker 6:  it might be linear that as more people streamed, fewer people would watch

804
00:50:26,705 --> 00:50:30,045
Speaker 6:  linear tv, but mostly that would be one-to-one and everything would be fine.

805
00:50:30,185 --> 00:50:34,005
Speaker 6:  And that is not even remotely how it has turned out. And so

806
00:50:34,025 --> 00:50:37,565
Speaker 6:  the, all of a sudden it's like, oh, this money that we thought we had

807
00:50:37,945 --> 00:50:41,765
Speaker 6:  to invest in bad Star Wars shows we actually don't have

808
00:50:41,945 --> 00:50:45,005
Speaker 6:  at all. Yeah. And it's like, that makes you panic on two levels because one,

809
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:47,885
Speaker 6:  we've spent this money on a bad Star Wars show, and two, we didn't have the

810
00:50:47,885 --> 00:50:50,605
Speaker 6:  money in the first place that we thought we were gonna have. And so you just

811
00:50:50,605 --> 00:50:54,565
Speaker 6:  end up in this like, it's, it feels like a spiral towards ugly places.

812
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:57,885
Speaker 8:  That's why you're hearing a lot of talk in, in Hollywood right now is that

813
00:50:57,885 --> 00:51:01,285
Speaker 8:  like, David Zaslav is gonna get fired from Warner Brothers because he's getting

814
00:51:01,315 --> 00:51:04,925
Speaker 8:  paid so much money and he just wrote down all of their broadcast stuff

815
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:09,125
Speaker 8:  and his whole big plan was, which I thought was a good plan when he,

816
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,965
Speaker 8:  when he first did it, was let's merge it all together. Let's make this super

817
00:51:13,065 --> 00:51:16,565
Speaker 8:  app, let's, let's like, put our broadcast on here. And

818
00:51:16,955 --> 00:51:20,165
Speaker 8:  they just haven't done it. And when they have done it, it's been like, did

819
00:51:20,165 --> 00:51:23,845
Speaker 8:  you guys watch CNN on Max ever? Am I the only one that does it?

820
00:51:24,425 --> 00:51:28,245
Speaker 8:  It it, it does you like three minutes of CNN and then it

821
00:51:28,245 --> 00:51:31,645
Speaker 8:  cuts to like 10 minutes of Medicare in

822
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:34,845
Speaker 8:  Oh, like additional supplemental Medicare insurance

823
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:36,525
Speaker 8:  commercials.

824
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:38,845
Speaker 6:  To be fair, that's just CNN you just described CNN

825
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:42,165
Speaker 8:  Is that just CNNI like, I, I guess I never watch it the, the old fashioned

826
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,685
Speaker 8:  way, but I was like, oh my goy, I had to turn it off. I can't rush into

827
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:49,405
Speaker 6:  This is why. So the other day Alex comes storming into our slack going

828
00:51:49,555 --> 00:51:51,885
Speaker 6:  have the CNN Chirons always looked this crazy.

829
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:55,845
Speaker 8:  That's right. I did just start watching CNN last week. Hi,

830
00:51:56,345 --> 00:51:57,485
Speaker 8:  my name's Alex Cranz.

831
00:51:57,795 --> 00:51:58,925
Speaker 6:  This makes sense. Well, it's

832
00:51:58,925 --> 00:51:59,085
Speaker 8:  Bad.

833
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:03,285
Speaker 6:  I have great news for you in these Trying Times in streaming, which

834
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:06,885
Speaker 6:  is that Chick-fil-A is here now and Chick-fil-A will fix it.

835
00:52:10,355 --> 00:52:14,285
Speaker 6:  Richard can You can you just quickly explain what Chick-fil-A is doing

836
00:52:14,285 --> 00:52:17,325
Speaker 6:  here? And then I have, I have many roads for us to go down, but can you just

837
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:18,565
Speaker 6:  tell us what we know so far?

838
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:22,925
Speaker 13:  Okay. First of all, no, I cannot. Second what we know so far is that

839
00:52:23,205 --> 00:52:26,245
Speaker 13:  deadline said that Chick-fil-A is working with a number of production studios

840
00:52:26,245 --> 00:52:30,165
Speaker 13:  and tradi traditional studios to create original shows for a streaming platform

841
00:52:30,165 --> 00:52:33,685
Speaker 13:  that they say they want, want, want to launch this year. Something that

842
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:37,565
Speaker 13:  a lot of people may not be aware of is that the owner of Chick-fil-A the

843
00:52:37,565 --> 00:52:41,525
Speaker 13:  Kathy family, they also were key to the foundation of Trivia

844
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,925
Speaker 13:  Studios, which you may not know necessarily by the name, but you know, by

845
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:48,725
Speaker 13:  what they make there, which is the Marvel movies really in, in

846
00:52:48,725 --> 00:52:52,045
Speaker 13:  Georgia, a massive, massive, massive production lot

847
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:54,425
Speaker 13:  where a lot of things are made.

848
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,465
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Ge Georgia's got the good discounts if you wanna shoot

849
00:52:58,465 --> 00:53:02,305
Speaker 8:  there. Yeah. And the good studios, it's not just Tyler Perry.

850
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:06,865
Speaker 6:  Okay. So I I have done in the last 24 hours, what I would say

851
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:10,265
Speaker 6:  is too much research on Chick-fil-A and its entertainment aspirations.

852
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:14,345
Speaker 6:  Can I share a little bit of what I've discovered with you? Yes.

853
00:53:15,055 --> 00:53:18,945
Speaker 6:  Chick-fil-A has a whole separate brand that it's, that it calls penny

854
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:22,665
Speaker 6:  cake and penny cake. Why is it named Penny cake?

855
00:53:23,065 --> 00:53:26,685
Speaker 6:  I, I could not tell you, but it's basically a, a

856
00:53:27,095 --> 00:53:30,965
Speaker 6:  brand full of like family friendly games and

857
00:53:30,965 --> 00:53:34,845
Speaker 6:  activities. It has a bunch of like, puzzles. It has a bunch

858
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:38,805
Speaker 6:  of those things where you like pull a, a prompt out of

859
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:42,285
Speaker 6:  a bag and you talk about it as a family. And it's like,

860
00:53:43,465 --> 00:53:47,325
Speaker 6:  if you squint at it, it's kind of a like thing to do around the table while

861
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,165
Speaker 6:  you eat Chick-fil-A but in general, it just seems like some

862
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:53,925
Speaker 6:  executive at Chick-fil-A was like, I wanna make puzzles. And they were like,

863
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:57,565
Speaker 6:  all right, make puzzles, I guess Chick-fil-A also

864
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:01,405
Speaker 6:  fun fact has made content before it made a

865
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,045
Speaker 6:  series of shows called the Stories of Evergreen Hills

866
00:54:06,315 --> 00:54:10,205
Speaker 6:  that I would describe as like animated in the style of the

867
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:14,125
Speaker 6:  Polar Express, but about like how to be

868
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,885
Speaker 6:  a good person. It's like, what if the Berenstein Bears and Polar

869
00:54:17,885 --> 00:54:21,485
Speaker 6:  Express sort of smooshed together and was worse?

870
00:54:21,855 --> 00:54:24,885
Speaker 6:  You'd have stories of Evergreen Hills. I encourage you to look this up on

871
00:54:24,885 --> 00:54:28,685
Speaker 6:  YouTube. A bunch of them exist. They're kind of weird and

872
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:32,645
Speaker 6:  like, you know, vacation Bible schooly in the sense that like they

873
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,845
Speaker 6:  have a big moral lesson at the end and they want to teach you how to be a

874
00:54:34,845 --> 00:54:36,005
Speaker 6:  better person. It's

875
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:37,525
Speaker 8:  Like Veggie Tales. Yeah.

876
00:54:38,665 --> 00:54:42,605
Speaker 6:  But so Richard, to your point, it's what's

877
00:54:42,605 --> 00:54:46,125
Speaker 6:  weird to me is that it's Chick-fil-A doing this. Like, I I I've had to wrap

878
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:48,325
Speaker 6:  my head around the fact that Chick-fil-A is not a restaurant, it's a, it

879
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:51,645
Speaker 6:  is just a large company with a name, right? And companies do lots of things,

880
00:54:52,075 --> 00:54:55,605
Speaker 6:  some under their brand and some not under their brand. But this family owns

881
00:54:55,605 --> 00:54:56,685
Speaker 6:  an enormous studio,

882
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:02,185
Speaker 6:  is well versed in the content business. And

883
00:55:02,765 --> 00:55:06,745
Speaker 6:  yet we're gonna get like Chick-fil-A plus as A streaming service. I

884
00:55:06,745 --> 00:55:09,505
Speaker 6:  doubt that's what it's gonna be called. I should say like, I think it might

885
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:12,545
Speaker 6:  be Penny Cake. I think they might come up with another brand like whatever.

886
00:55:12,845 --> 00:55:16,465
Speaker 6:  But the idea of like Chick-fil-A the restaurant wanting

887
00:55:16,645 --> 00:55:20,545
Speaker 6:  to make content just does not make any sense to me. Is this,

888
00:55:20,645 --> 00:55:22,945
Speaker 6:  am I, am I overthinking this or under thinking this?

889
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:26,825
Speaker 13:  Did Chick-fil-A stop and say why not? When they were thinking about sponsoring

890
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:27,345
Speaker 13:  a bowl game,

891
00:55:29,265 --> 00:55:33,105
Speaker 13:  I mean, they did not fair. And does Chick-fil-A plus make less sense than

892
00:55:33,345 --> 00:55:36,225
Speaker 13:  Hallmark Plus? If you think, if you think about, Ooh, that's a good one.

893
00:55:36,365 --> 00:55:38,625
Speaker 13:  Why does a card company have a network?

894
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:40,305
Speaker 8:  Oh, I just figured it out.

895
00:55:40,485 --> 00:55:44,225
Speaker 6:  So okay, wait, but I'll give you that. If Chick-fil-A wants to basically

896
00:55:44,225 --> 00:55:46,985
Speaker 6:  make worse food network, then I'm No,

897
00:55:46,985 --> 00:55:50,825
Speaker 8:  No, no. Probably no. Chick-fil-A is gonna acquire what the, the, the

898
00:55:50,985 --> 00:55:54,145
Speaker 8:  scorched remains of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment

899
00:55:55,045 --> 00:55:58,945
Speaker 8:  in in red. They're gonna acquire all that and then they're just gonna

900
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:02,305
Speaker 8:  do Christian streaming service.

901
00:56:04,765 --> 00:56:08,695
Speaker 8:  'cause they love Jesus differently than

902
00:56:08,695 --> 00:56:12,655
Speaker 8:  other people do, but they have their own opinion. Yeah,

903
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:17,175
Speaker 8:  I I I love that they don't work on Sunday, but that that's what they're gonna

904
00:56:17,175 --> 00:56:19,855
Speaker 8:  do. They're gonna do a Christian entertainment

905
00:56:21,005 --> 00:56:22,055
Speaker 8:  streaming service. I

906
00:56:22,055 --> 00:56:24,685
Speaker 6:  Think that's right. And as we've seen, seen, that's a big market. Yeah. Right.

907
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:26,405
Speaker 6:  Like Angel Studios is very successful.

908
00:56:27,365 --> 00:56:29,645
Speaker 8:  I mean, it wasn't a big market for Chicken Soup for the Soul entertainment.

909
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,365
Speaker 6:  No. But I would say they'd made a lot of mistakes.

910
00:56:33,885 --> 00:56:35,285
Speaker 8:  Yeah. That's, that's that were

911
00:56:35,285 --> 00:56:39,205
Speaker 6:  Not like, like if Chick-fil-A gets really big into selling DVDs at Chick-fil-A

912
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:42,805
Speaker 6:  I think we'll have a problem. But my guess is that's not, and all the Chick,

913
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,445
Speaker 13:  The story Chicka for the Soul seems to be, it would've been a fine company

914
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:48,725
Speaker 13:  if it were happy being what it was. It was trying to be 100 other things.

915
00:56:48,725 --> 00:56:49,165
Speaker 13:  Totally.

916
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:52,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah. But Chick-fil-A that's about it. It's about to do. So,

917
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:56,205
Speaker 6:  Okay, so this, this is the game. I just, I just wanna play for a few minutes

918
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:59,885
Speaker 6:  here. Okay. I'm, you are now the head of content at Chick-fil-A

919
00:56:59,965 --> 00:57:03,485
Speaker 6:  congratulations to both of you. Yes. You are in charge of

920
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,845
Speaker 6:  making A streaming service

921
00:57:07,085 --> 00:57:09,965
Speaker 6:  A, you have to come up with the name and B, you have to tell me

922
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:15,085
Speaker 6:  at least two shows that you wanna put on your streaming service. Alex,

923

Speaker 6:  you go First

924
00:57:16,035 --> 00:57:19,285

925
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:24,645
Speaker 8:  for ft. I don't know, I'm not gonna do that.

926
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:25,645
Speaker 8:  P Chick-fil-A for the

927
00:57:25,645 --> 00:57:27,445
Speaker 6:  Soul. C-F-A-F-T-S, something

928
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,045
Speaker 8:  Like that. That's not great. That it's not great. This is a work in progress.

929
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:32,325
Speaker 8:  But I think that's where we're gonna go. We're gonna get a reboot, a Touch

930
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:36,005
Speaker 8:  by the Touched by an Angel. Ooh. And wait,

931
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:37,485
Speaker 6:  That's good. That's actually very

932
00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:41,365
Speaker 8:  Good. And, and either a reboot or we're just gonna get the

933
00:57:41,365 --> 00:57:44,205

934
00:57:45,025 --> 00:57:48,485
Speaker 6:  Oh, okay. So just like Sweet down home family shows. Yeah.

937
00:57:55,645 --> 00:57:58,525
Speaker 6:  We'll just deep fake someone else into character. Deep fake.

938
00:57:58,525 --> 00:58:01,525
Speaker 8:  Someone else that does face. Yeah. Oh, but then we get the moment where the

939
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:05,495
Speaker 8:  moms goes, I smoked pot. and it, there's like an intense noise

940
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:09,215
Speaker 8:  around her. Oh, that's gonna be so good. Okay. Be like, I can't believe Chick-fil-A

941
00:58:09,215 --> 00:58:09,535
Speaker 8:  did that

942
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:13,115

963
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:06,745
Speaker 13:  they, and they're like, shorting the stocks of those companies is great.

Speaker 6:  Sex in the City and Pacific Rim.

972
00:59:20,465 --> 00:59:24,285

980
00:59:50,985 --> 00:59:54,645
Speaker 6:  one I would say, that's what I'm going after. So we're doing a bunch of,

981
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:58,005
Speaker 6:  like, one of the things Chick-fil-A is apparently doing is looking for like

982
00:59:58,005 --> 01:00:01,805
Speaker 6:  family friendly game shows. So I'm going with like all of the,

983
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:05,925
Speaker 6:  all of the, you know, Christian music videos. People are gonna play

984
01:00:05,925 --> 01:00:07,085
Speaker 6:  that all the time. We're gonna just

985
01:00:07,085 --> 01:00:07,485
Speaker 8:  Jars of clay,

986
01:00:07,485 --> 01:00:10,485
Speaker 6:  We music thing, just jars of clay everywhere you look,

987
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:15,045
Speaker 6:  some switchfoot when we're feeling edgy. Lots of stuff to do. And then

988
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:18,365
Speaker 6:  Little Creed. And then it's just gonna be a lot of like

989
01:00:18,935 --> 01:00:22,845
Speaker 6:  great British show, great British baking show style competition shows where

990
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:25,725
Speaker 6:  it's competition, but everybody's really nice to each other. They, at the

991
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:28,325
Speaker 6:  end we're end. We're gonna takeover. I think I am going to absolutely dominate.

992
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:32,645
Speaker 6:  And one show at least is going to be called My Pleasure. and it is going

993
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:35,445
Speaker 6:  to be our tent pole show. I don't know what it is, but I know it's called

994
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:36,405
Speaker 6:  My Pleasure.

995
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:39,725
Speaker 8:  It's actually gonna be a remake of Red Shoe Diaries. We're just gonna go

996
01:00:39,725 --> 01:00:40,845
Speaker 8:  really, really wild with that

997
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:44,165
Speaker 6:  One. As I say it out loud, my pleasure might be like too sexy a show.

998
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:48,405
Speaker 8:  I I was like, it was like, that's a little racy for for Chick-fil-A

999
01:00:48,555 --> 01:00:51,205
Speaker 6:  Okay, well we, we have a lot to think about. Chick-fil-A

1000
01:00:51,205 --> 01:00:52,485
Speaker 13:  After Dark. Come on now. Yeah.

01:00:57,645 --> 01:01:00,645
Speaker 6:  Nickelodeon and it's just called Chick-fil-A After Dark.

1004
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:04,515
Speaker 8:  The Nugs are spicier after Dark. Okay.

1005
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:06,995
Speaker 6:  So we're accidentally inventing Chick-fil-A's porn network, which is good.

1006
01:01:07,385 --> 01:01:09,075
Speaker 6:  This is, this is the next, we're

Speaker 6:  Alright, one more thing we should talk about before we get off of the streaming

1011
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:22,635
Speaker 6:  stuff, which is some interesting Podcasty news.

1012
01:01:23,425 --> 01:01:27,075
Speaker 6:  This is a podcast after all the big

1013
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:30,155
Speaker 6:  podcast news of this week, I would say

1014
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:35,475
Speaker 6:  is that Alex Cooper, who hosts call her Daddy

1015
01:01:35,855 --> 01:01:39,315
Speaker 6:  and I think is probably like the second biggest name on Spotify

1016
01:01:39,805 --> 01:01:43,515
Speaker 6:  after Joe Rogan, just in terms of like people who got

1017
01:01:43,685 --> 01:01:47,255
Speaker 6:  giant whatever, eight figure deals to go be on Spotify

1018
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:50,735
Speaker 6:  exclusively is leaving Spotify and going to SiriusXM

1019
01:01:50,995 --> 01:01:53,895
Speaker 6:  signed a huge deal for like a hundred million dollars.

1020
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:59,015
Speaker 6:  Super big deal. And just strikes me as very interesting because

1021
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,015
Speaker 6:  I'm sorry it was $125 million.

1022
01:02:01,755 --> 01:02:02,295
Speaker 8:  So much money.

1023
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:06,495
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I just think it's fascinating because Sirius also

1024
01:02:06,495 --> 01:02:10,415
Speaker 6:  just recently, I believe it was Smartless that made a huge deal with Sirius.

1025
01:02:10,635 --> 01:02:14,055
Speaker 6:  So we're in this weird moment where like the podcast business is kind of

1026
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:18,375
Speaker 6:  retrenching and there was this huge boom and then it all sort of pulled

1027
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:21,805
Speaker 6:  back. But then like Sirius in particular is out here just writing gigantic

1028
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:22,165
Speaker 6:  checks.

1029
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:26,005
Speaker 8:  No, this makes sense. Sirius is always like 10 years late to the game

1030
01:02:26,385 --> 01:02:26,605
Speaker 8:  if,

1031
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:30,565
Speaker 13:  If she were a radio host and she had hit one big deal and probably

1032
01:02:30,565 --> 01:02:33,525
Speaker 13:  wasn't going to hit a big deal again at that network and then went to Sirius

1033
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:37,405
Speaker 13:  for a lot of money and probably none of us ever listening to her

1034
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:40,525
Speaker 13:  on serious ever again. Yeah, you wouldn't even think about this. You would

1035
01:02:40,525 --> 01:02:42,965
Speaker 13:  just say, oh yeah, that's, that's obviously what happened. This is

1036
01:02:42,965 --> 01:02:43,085
Speaker 8:  The Howard

1037
01:02:43,215 --> 01:02:45,125
Speaker 6:  Stern Did she did a Howard Stern is what you're saying?

1038
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:48,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah, yeah. It's the Howard Stern. Okay. I hope she enjoys having her 12

1039
01:02:48,925 --> 01:02:52,815
Speaker 8:  listeners, all of whom are in their car. 'cause they forgot to

1040
01:02:52,815 --> 01:02:54,735
Speaker 8:  cancel the subscription in their car. Okay. So

1041
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:58,175
Speaker 6:  This is part of the reason I actually brought this up. 'cause I think Howard

1042
01:02:58,185 --> 01:03:02,015
Speaker 6:  Stern deal in a certain way made sense. A, it's like he's a big name,

1043
01:03:02,015 --> 01:03:05,175
Speaker 6:  he's a big brand. And also I think the like demographic,

1044
01:03:05,585 --> 01:03:09,495
Speaker 6:  especially age-wise of people who love Howard Stern and people who spend

1045
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:12,295
Speaker 6:  a lot of time in their car listening to satellite radio is pretty solid.

1046
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:16,135
Speaker 6:  This one seems strange to me because

1047
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:20,975
Speaker 6:  Alex Cooper is much younger. The call her daddy audience is presumably much

1048
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:23,415
Speaker 6:  younger. It's just a completely different generation. Like one of the reasons

1049
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:27,255
Speaker 6:  there was a great, I think it was Wall Street Journal story right before

1050
01:03:27,275 --> 01:03:30,775
Speaker 6:  the Olympics about Alex Cooper as like the Gen Z

1051
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:34,655
Speaker 6:  whisperer and like, do Gen Z people

1052
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,095
Speaker 6:  know what SiriusXM is? Well

1053
01:03:37,095 --> 01:03:39,455
Speaker 8:  They're gonna have to, if they're gonna follow her. I mean that's probably,

1054
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:42,255
Speaker 13:  People will still be available on other pod podcast platforms.

1055
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:45,535
Speaker 6:  So they're just spending all this money to sell ads for call her daddy

1056
01:03:45,895 --> 01:03:48,975
Speaker 13:  I guess, which is fine. You know, if You can make the money work, then fine.

1057
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:53,055
Speaker 6:  That just seems like a ton of money if that's your play. But what do I

1058
01:03:53,055 --> 01:03:54,295
Speaker 6:  know? Maybe, maybe it'll work.

1059
01:03:54,395 --> 01:03:56,415
Speaker 8:  You get three months for a dollar.

1060
01:03:58,415 --> 01:04:00,935
Speaker 6:  I just like, we're in this moment now where it's like serious and iHeart,

1061
01:04:00,935 --> 01:04:04,455
Speaker 6:  which are like two huge radio players are the only ones left spending money

1062
01:04:04,475 --> 01:04:08,415
Speaker 6:  on podcasts. And I don't know if that is like a sign of things to come of

1063
01:04:08,735 --> 01:04:12,655
Speaker 6:  consolidation or if it's, they're just the only ones dumb enough

1064
01:04:12,655 --> 01:04:12,975
Speaker 6:  to I would say

1065
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:15,015
Speaker 8:  Keep writing these pictures. I would say, I would say it's, it's a sign of

1066
01:04:15,255 --> 01:04:18,575
Speaker 8:  consolidation. I think the, the these two companies have managed to persist

1067
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:22,815
Speaker 8:  iHeart Radio with like an enormous monopoly on broadcast radio in

1068
01:04:22,815 --> 01:04:26,495
Speaker 8:  the United States. Yeah. It's like they, they just wanna try to

1069
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:28,135
Speaker 8:  stay alive as long as possible

1070
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:32,575
Speaker 6:  And you'll, they'll just write giant checks until there are no more giant

1071
01:04:32,575 --> 01:04:32,975
Speaker 6:  checks to

1072
01:04:32,975 --> 01:04:35,615
Speaker 8:  Write. Yeah. Until, until the giant check account is closed.

1073
01:04:35,975 --> 01:04:37,775
Speaker 6:  I mean listen Alex Cooper get

1074
01:04:37,775 --> 01:04:41,415
Speaker 8:  That money. Get your bag. Yeah. Get the bag. Absolutely. Go for it. I love

1075
01:04:41,415 --> 01:04:41,895
Speaker 8:  this for her.

1076
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:44,775
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back, do a

1077
01:04:44,775 --> 01:04:45,855
Speaker 6:  lightning round. We'll be right back.

1078
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:53,335
Speaker 13:  interesting accounting based on the idea that if you used Alexa and bought

1079
01:08:53,485 --> 01:08:57,255
Speaker 13:  Echo hardware, you would buy more stuff from Amazon. And that is not what

1080
01:08:57,255 --> 01:09:01,055
Speaker 13:  people do. They just used Alexa to turn off their lights and stuff and set

1081
01:09:01,295 --> 01:09:05,015
Speaker 13:  reminders and the kids ask it questions, they, they don't

1082
01:09:05,115 --> 01:09:05,735
Speaker 13:  buy more stuff.

1083
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:09,935
Speaker 8:  One time a roommate of mine bought I would say like $40 worth

1084
01:09:09,935 --> 01:09:13,495
Speaker 8:  of Cadbury eggs and then a hundred dollars of laundry

1085
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:17,095
Speaker 8:  detergent on my Alexa. And then I was like, why did you

1086
01:09:17,635 --> 01:09:21,255
Speaker 8:  buy that? And she's like, I just wanted to see. And then we stopped using

1087
01:09:21,275 --> 01:09:25,215
Speaker 8:  it ever for buying things because that was so many Cadbury eggs

1088
01:09:25,515 --> 01:09:26,975
Speaker 8:  and overpriced detergent.

1089
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:30,415
Speaker 6:  That's a pretty funny bit to pull at somebody's house actually, to just walk

1090
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:33,575
Speaker 6:  in and just start yelling at the speaker to buy stuff and just see how far

1091
01:09:33,575 --> 01:09:34,455
Speaker 6:  You can get. Little

1092
01:09:34,455 --> 01:09:37,735
Speaker 8:  Kids do it all the time. They're like, buy me a, buy me a fire tablet. Yeah.

1093
01:09:37,735 --> 01:09:39,015
Speaker 8:  And you're like, no, shut up.

1094
01:09:40,145 --> 01:09:40,495
Speaker 6:  Leave

1095
01:09:40,495 --> 01:09:41,735
Speaker 8:  It alone. It's not for you.

1096
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:45,175
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This is one of those things that I feel like is just

1097
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:49,735
Speaker 6:  like a, a failure on all sides. 'cause Richard, you're right that, like for

1098
01:09:49,735 --> 01:09:52,735
Speaker 6:  Amazon, I'm sure they lost money on every single one of these things that

1099
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:55,895
Speaker 6:  they sold, which is why Amazon doesn't want to just sell these things as

1100
01:09:55,895 --> 01:09:59,695
Speaker 6:  a photo frame And. if you were to say Amazon, why not sell it for more

1101
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:03,615
Speaker 6:  money so that You can make money on it as a photo frame? Some accountant

1102
01:10:03,615 --> 01:10:07,535
Speaker 6:  within Amazon would tell you that that's not how business works. Yeah, I'm

1103
01:10:07,535 --> 01:10:11,495
Speaker 6:  not an accountant, what do I know? But, but then to do something

1104
01:10:11,495 --> 01:10:14,615
Speaker 6:  like this, presumably for a teeny tiny number of people, this is a thing

1105
01:10:14,615 --> 01:10:17,695
Speaker 6:  I've just never understood about large companies, like Google does this worse

1106
01:10:17,695 --> 01:10:21,415
Speaker 6:  than anybody. They're like, we have a thing with not as many users that isn't

1107
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:24,935
Speaker 6:  making us as much money as we hoped. It costs us absolutely nothing to

1108
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:28,895
Speaker 6:  run, so we're gonna cancel it. It's like, why? What are we

1109
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:32,455
Speaker 6:  accomplishing here? It was like when every when the, they took the

1110
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:36,615
Speaker 6:  MTV news archive offline, it's like, I'm pretty sure You can afford to keep

1111
01:10:36,915 --> 01:10:40,295
Speaker 6:  MTV news.com online. Like I think it's fine. Maybe

1112
01:10:40,295 --> 01:10:44,055
Speaker 8:  It's like a tax write off. Do you get a tax write off if you just remove

1113
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:46,415
Speaker 8:  a feature? Like, like do they get a tax write off for

1114
01:10:46,415 --> 01:10:49,015
Speaker 6:  That? They're like, no, we did a bad job on that one. Yeah. Like,

1115
01:10:49,015 --> 01:10:51,975
Speaker 8:  Like, like Hollywood is always like, nevermind, we're not gonna release this

1116
01:10:51,975 --> 01:10:54,575
Speaker 8:  movie and we're gonna put it in a vault forever. Gimme money

1117
01:10:55,655 --> 01:10:57,655
Speaker 8:  IRS and like Amazon just don't

1118
01:10:57,655 --> 01:10:59,775
Speaker 13:  Gimme money. I mean that's the thing at Google is that the reason why a

1119
01:10:59,775 --> 01:11:02,135
Speaker 13:  lot of these products have canceled is because they can't find anyone to

1120
01:11:02,295 --> 01:11:05,015
Speaker 13:  run them. Because if you're not running a project that's growing or going

1121
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:07,615
Speaker 13:  somewhere, then you aren't going to get that next promotion, et cetera,

1122
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:10,335
Speaker 13:  et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. It's probably a similar thing within Amazon.

1123
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:14,165
Speaker 13:  It's like, okay, so, so who wants to weekly check in and make sure that

1124
01:11:14,165 --> 01:11:17,715
Speaker 13:  the, the photo subscription is still working? Nobody.

1125
01:11:17,985 --> 01:11:19,275
Speaker 13:  Okay. Canceling. I,

1126
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:23,475
Speaker 6:  I guess, I don't know, open source it like get, get the user

1127
01:11:23,575 --> 01:11:24,235
Speaker 6:  to do it. Like

1128
01:11:25,105 --> 01:11:26,435
Speaker 8:  Richard's just like they're, you check

1129
01:11:26,435 --> 01:11:30,395
Speaker 6:  This box once a week. Like, I don't know. And I get that I'm asking for something

1130
01:11:30,395 --> 01:11:33,675
Speaker 6:  that's never gonna happen, but it just always feels so silly to me when companies

1131
01:11:33,675 --> 01:11:37,475
Speaker 6:  do this. It's such an own goal of customer

1132
01:11:37,475 --> 01:11:41,435
Speaker 6:  relations and making people trust you as a company in the name of

1133
01:11:41,815 --> 01:11:45,635
Speaker 6:  saving one person, one meeting a quarter. Well

1134
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:48,995
Speaker 13:  You think it's unreasonable that they spend a trillion dollars on new AI

1135
01:11:48,995 --> 01:11:52,075
Speaker 13:  chips, but they can't spend $100 to keep this running.

1136
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:56,355
Speaker 6:  Exactly. What if you just put one of those chips onto keeping all

1137
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:59,515
Speaker 6:  of those customers happy and then if you don't wanna have this problem again,

1138
01:11:59,675 --> 01:12:03,055
Speaker 6:  I don't know, make better products. There's an idea for you.

1139
01:12:03,395 --> 01:12:05,495
Speaker 6:  Amazon Crans, what's yours

1140
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:10,615
Speaker 8:  Not related to Amazon. Mine is JBL. You remember

1141
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:14,015
Speaker 8:  last year they had the, the headphones that had a screen on them for the

1142
01:12:14,015 --> 01:12:17,855
Speaker 8:  case. Oh yeah, they did it again. But the the, the screen

1143
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,705
Speaker 8:  got bigger. It's a much bigger screen. You can, like You can pause,

1144
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:23,965
Speaker 8:  You can You can skip tracks.

1145
01:12:25,205 --> 01:12:29,125
Speaker 6:  I still cannot decide if this is the best idea ever or

1146
01:12:29,365 --> 01:12:31,845
Speaker 6:  a completely pointless use of technology. You've do more. I've never used

1147
01:12:31,965 --> 01:12:34,965
Speaker 6:  a pair of headphones like this. So I, I genuinely can't say, but I can't

1148
01:12:34,965 --> 01:12:35,285
Speaker 6:  decide.

1149
01:12:35,605 --> 01:12:38,525
Speaker 8:  I think you might be able to do more with this than You can do with G Gemini

1150
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:40,485
Speaker 8:  because You can set alarms.

1151
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:43,725
Speaker 8:  So I

1152
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:45,605
Speaker 13:  Was gonna go the other way. I was gonna say this is like a book's poem,

1153
01:12:46,145 --> 01:12:46,725
Speaker 13:  but I had phone

1154
01:12:46,725 --> 01:12:50,325
Speaker 8:  Case. Yeah. But yeah, but You can you set alarms, you You can check text

1155
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:53,525
Speaker 8:  messages. Basically if you didn't have an, some sort of

1156
01:12:53,655 --> 01:12:57,645
Speaker 8:  smartwatch, you just pull this outta your pocket instead of your, your phone.

1157
01:12:58,265 --> 01:13:01,085
Speaker 8:  That's probably likely gonna happen.

1158
01:13:02,085 --> 01:13:03,285
Speaker 6:  I right. Don't that's,

1159
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:06,365
Speaker 13:  That's actually better. I I I kinda like that. Yeah. Like I don't need a

1160
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:09,045
Speaker 13:  smartwatch all the time, but I'm going to be carrying my earbuds anyway.

1161
01:13:09,955 --> 01:13:13,685
Speaker 8:  They, they like, they just look neat. I don't know. I'm, I'm

1162
01:13:14,065 --> 01:13:17,565
Speaker 8:  one of those people where while I do feel we should have smart,

1163
01:13:17,945 --> 01:13:21,725
Speaker 8:  we should have small good smartphones. I also understand that people

1164
01:13:21,725 --> 01:13:25,685
Speaker 8:  love cheap screens and this is just cool. Like just

1165
01:13:25,795 --> 01:13:27,365
Speaker 8:  slap a screen on it. Let's go.

1166
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:31,365
Speaker 6:  My thing is I want all of this, but I want it to be like

1167
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,285
Speaker 6:  button controls that I can do just by like putting my hand in my

1168
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:38,605
Speaker 6:  pocket. Ooh. Right. Like I want the, the controls that are on my headphones.

1169
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:42,525
Speaker 6:  In a lot of cases, I also want those on the thing in my pocket.

1170
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:46,165
Speaker 6:  So I can just reach in and like whack it twice to go to the next

1171
01:13:46,345 --> 01:13:48,205
Speaker 8:  Song's. Be like actual physical buttons.

1172
01:13:48,635 --> 01:13:51,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like what if my AirPods case just had 12 buttons on it?

1173
01:13:51,745 --> 01:13:54,205
Speaker 8:  That'd be nice. And you just sounds amazing. Then people are like, why, what

1174
01:13:54,205 --> 01:13:55,925
Speaker 8:  you fiddling within your pocket? It's David. It's basically

1175
01:13:55,925 --> 01:13:59,045
Speaker 6:  Just a little fidget spinner and I just, I'm just in there just clicking

1176
01:13:59,045 --> 01:13:59,725
Speaker 6:  around all day.

1177
01:13:59,825 --> 01:14:02,725
Speaker 8:  I'm always like flipping the case open and close and then I'm like, why don't

1178
01:14:02,725 --> 01:14:05,045
Speaker 8:  I have any battery? Oh, it's

1179
01:14:05,045 --> 01:14:08,965
Speaker 6:  Me. So one random thing. Have you, I always hate

1180
01:14:08,965 --> 01:14:11,950
Speaker 6:  asking people if they see anything on TikTok because the answer is no, because

1181
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:15,565
Speaker 6:  everybody has a completely different TikTok experience. But for like two

1182
01:14:15,575 --> 01:14:19,285
Speaker 6:  weeks there was one guy Hawking, a pair

1183
01:14:19,425 --> 01:14:23,365
Speaker 6:  of Lenovo earbuds that also had a screen on the

1184
01:14:23,365 --> 01:14:27,005
Speaker 6:  case. That was like every fifth video I saw. Yes. On

1185
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:28,965
Speaker 6:  TikTok. Do you know what I'm talking about?

1186
01:14:29,075 --> 01:14:32,765
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I like, I I've since quit TikTok. I'm I'm, I'm away from

1187
01:14:32,765 --> 01:14:36,085
Speaker 8:  TikTok right now 'cause I was in Texas and I was getting a lot of political

1188
01:14:36,645 --> 01:14:40,595
Speaker 8:  location based stuff that I didn't wanna see. But yeah, I remember that guy.

1189
01:14:41,095 --> 01:14:44,235
Speaker 8:  He, he just was call. I was like, oh, should we call these in? He made

1190
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,875
Speaker 6:  A very convincing case. He Yeah.

1191
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:50,035
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I was like, I should I buy these Lenovo, like Lenovo is

1192
01:14:50,035 --> 01:14:53,955
Speaker 8:  working on TikTok like you, that was the consistent thing.

1193
01:14:53,975 --> 01:14:57,795
Speaker 8:  It would always be like these weird lifestyle products from Lenovo and you're

1194
01:14:57,795 --> 01:15:01,635
Speaker 8:  like, I didn't know you sold like a flashlight with a Lenovo

1195
01:15:01,635 --> 01:15:02,315
Speaker 8:  brand on it. See? Co

1196
01:15:02,495 --> 01:15:06,355
Speaker 6:  See is this the same Lenovo, like Lenovo is definitely turning into

1197
01:15:06,355 --> 01:15:08,835
Speaker 6:  one of those companies that just kind of makes everything Yeah.

1198
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:12,755
Speaker 8:  You're like Sure. Including weird ein laptops. Thank you Lenovo.

1199
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:13,075
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1200
01:15:13,145 --> 01:15:14,275
Speaker 6:  Hell yeah. Just keep doing that.

1201
01:15:14,315 --> 01:15:17,195
Speaker 13:  I I did not get that. The only thing I get on TikTok now is Cole Hacker

1202
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:18,075
Speaker 13:  edits of himself.

1203
01:15:20,545 --> 01:15:23,035
Speaker 6:  That seems better. I think I, I prefer, prefer,

1204
01:15:23,275 --> 01:15:23,595
Speaker 8:  I like that.

1205
01:15:23,855 --> 01:15:27,715
Speaker 6:  One of the features I've always wanted from TikTok is like a walk a mile

1206
01:15:27,715 --> 01:15:31,075
Speaker 6:  in somebody else's shoes where like I should be able to scan a QR code and

1207
01:15:31,075 --> 01:15:34,515
Speaker 6:  just immediately get your, for you feed for an hour. I think that would be

1208
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:38,075
Speaker 6:  so fun. And it's like, what a way to get to know somebody then to like

1209
01:15:38,225 --> 01:15:41,235
Speaker 6:  quickly And you have control over it. You have to share it with me. It's

1210
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:44,595
Speaker 6:  like sharing your location with somebody. I'm like, I can share my feed with

1211
01:15:44,595 --> 01:15:46,195
Speaker 6:  you. I think that would be so fun.

1212
01:15:46,615 --> 01:15:49,515
Speaker 8:  Why is TikTok not doing that as a a speed dating app?

1213
01:15:50,095 --> 01:15:54,075
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. It's like on Hinge. But instead of having to

1214
01:15:54,075 --> 01:15:57,355
Speaker 6:  like answer asinine questions about yourself, you just are like, here's my

1215
01:15:57,355 --> 01:15:58,555
Speaker 6:  feed. Do you love me? Like

1216
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:01,675
Speaker 8:  TikTok, this is how you're gonna make money because you don't make money.

1217
01:16:01,705 --> 01:16:05,515
Speaker 8:  This is, this is how TikTok will make money. Is is just doing this.

1218
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:07,515
Speaker 8:  This is great. I love this dating apps.

1219
01:16:07,775 --> 01:16:11,075
Speaker 6:  That's a good idea. Yeah. Anyway, TikTok You can have that for free.

1220
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:13,715
Speaker 6:  Sponsor the lightning round. What's

1221
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:14,835
Speaker 8:  Speaking of Lightning? What's yours?

1222
01:16:15,185 --> 01:16:18,675
Speaker 6:  Mine is, I just wanna talk about the Sonos app again for a minute

1223
01:16:19,235 --> 01:16:23,035
Speaker 6:  because this, this whole Sonos app story

1224
01:16:23,215 --> 01:16:26,795
Speaker 6:  has gone from like ridiculous to

1225
01:16:27,135 --> 01:16:29,755
Speaker 6:  sad to just weird and confusing.

1226
01:16:30,935 --> 01:16:34,555
Speaker 6:  The most recent thing is that Sonos, which Chris

1227
01:16:34,605 --> 01:16:38,235
Speaker 6:  Welch scooped what last week, two weeks ago recently.

1228
01:16:38,465 --> 01:16:42,435
Speaker 6:  That the company was considering re-releasing

1229
01:16:42,435 --> 01:16:46,355
Speaker 6:  the app. Patrick Spence said in a Reddit a MA this

1230
01:16:46,355 --> 01:16:50,315
Speaker 6:  week that he was hopeful until very recently that Sonos could

1231
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:54,195
Speaker 6:  just re-release the app. But then they found that

1232
01:16:54,195 --> 01:16:57,795
Speaker 6:  they couldn't and that the old app would just make everything worse.

1233
01:16:58,855 --> 01:16:59,075
Speaker 6:  And

1234
01:17:01,065 --> 01:17:04,355
Speaker 6:  This is so brutal for Sonos. Like

1235
01:17:05,025 --> 01:17:08,195
Speaker 6:  it's just, I mean lemme just read you more of the quote here. So he says

1236
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:11,045
Speaker 6:  the trick of course, course is that Sonos is not just the mobile app, but

1237
01:17:11,285 --> 01:17:14,165
Speaker 6:  software that runs on your speakers. And in the cloud too. In the months

1238
01:17:14,165 --> 01:17:16,325
Speaker 6:  since the new mobile app launched, we've been updating the software that

1239
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:19,525
Speaker 6:  runs on our speakers and in the cloud to the point where today S two is less

1240
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:23,685
Speaker 6:  reliable and less stable than what you remember. Like what he, what

1241
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:27,125
Speaker 6:  he's saying is, we broke everything so badly that we can't

1242
01:17:27,555 --> 01:17:29,925
Speaker 6:  even go back anymore. I just like,

1243
01:17:30,765 --> 01:17:34,405
Speaker 8:  I have so many questions. How does that, it's unreal. How does that

1244
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:38,405
Speaker 8:  work? I mean the, the, the s two app was never very

1245
01:17:38,435 --> 01:17:41,245
Speaker 8:  good. This is part of the thing where I'm like, I think the current app is

1246
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:44,605
Speaker 8:  getting a bit of a bad shake 'cause it's not very good. But the last one

1247
01:17:44,605 --> 01:17:48,365
Speaker 8:  was also bad and was constantly like disconnecting and forcing you to reset

1248
01:17:48,365 --> 01:17:49,085
Speaker 8:  your entire home.

1249
01:17:49,305 --> 01:17:53,245
Speaker 6:  The last one, like it's, it's a very funny Rorschach

1250
01:17:53,245 --> 01:17:57,205
Speaker 6:  test of like, do you want all the features but kind of bad or do you

1251
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,485
Speaker 6:  want slightly better but no features,

1252
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:01,485
Speaker 8:  Right?

1253
01:18:01,595 --> 01:18:04,845
Speaker 6:  It's like, well maybe Sonos you should have just done, they're both bad

1254
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:09,525
Speaker 6:  to be clear. Not good outcomes, but it's just, it's

1255
01:18:09,525 --> 01:18:10,445
Speaker 6:  it's, this is just tough.

1256
01:18:11,115 --> 01:18:12,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah. This is, this is awful.

1257
01:18:12,485 --> 01:18:14,605
Speaker 13:  Awful. I just don't understand how they, they got to the point of having

1258
01:18:14,605 --> 01:18:17,005
Speaker 13:  an app that doesn't work and doesn't do what people want.

1259
01:18:17,575 --> 01:18:21,485
Speaker 6:  Right. Like IIII totally agree. And the fact

1260
01:18:21,485 --> 01:18:25,005
Speaker 6:  that Sonos has had to walk it so far back as to

1261
01:18:25,005 --> 01:18:28,685
Speaker 6:  basically acknowledge and I guess to some extent credit to

1262
01:18:28,685 --> 01:18:32,645
Speaker 6:  Patrick Spence for just saying out loud like, yeah, we screwed it up.

1263
01:18:32,645 --> 01:18:35,685
Speaker 6:  Like they started by trying to do the, you know, change is hard thing. And

1264
01:18:35,685 --> 01:18:38,045
Speaker 6:  then they started by saying it took courage to do this. They actually use

1265
01:18:38,045 --> 01:18:41,885
Speaker 6:  the word courage, which PSA to CEOs. Don't use the word courage

1266
01:18:41,885 --> 01:18:45,485
Speaker 6:  anymore. Just stop it. It doesn't help. It always backfires.

1267
01:18:45,745 --> 01:18:49,565
Speaker 6:  We will use it against you just don't do it anymore. And now

1268
01:18:49,585 --> 01:18:51,925
Speaker 6:  at least they have come all the way around and been like, yeah, we released

1269
01:18:51,965 --> 01:18:55,725
Speaker 6:  a crappy app. This sucks. We're sorry. But also

1270
01:18:55,725 --> 01:18:59,165
Speaker 6:  there's nothing we can do about it. Like, it's so bad.

1271
01:18:59,965 --> 01:19:03,925
Speaker 6:  I really, I feel for, I feel for Sonos. Oh and this is a not

1272
01:19:03,965 --> 01:19:06,205
Speaker 6:  a good moment to be doing this If you're Sonos.

1273
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:09,925
Speaker 8:  They apparently, I didn't realize they, they got rid of their beta program

1274
01:19:10,105 --> 01:19:13,245
Speaker 8:  or they, they, they, they didn't make it as robust as it used to be.

1275
01:19:15,905 --> 01:19:19,845
Speaker 6:  I'm, there are a lot of things that went wrong in the process here, but ultimately,

1276
01:19:19,845 --> 01:19:23,325
Speaker 6:  like it should have been blindingly obvious that this thing wasn't ready.

1277
01:19:24,065 --> 01:19:27,325
Speaker 6:  And, and I and what, what Chris Welch has said on this show is that because

1278
01:19:27,385 --> 01:19:30,005
Speaker 6:  the headphones were coming and because there was such a rush to do that,

1279
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:32,645
Speaker 6:  there was this sense like, like we have to do all of this at once. Yeah.

1280
01:19:32,665 --> 01:19:34,885
Speaker 6:  And holy God did that backfire

1281
01:19:35,425 --> 01:19:39,125
Speaker 13:  All to launch these headphones that, did anyone ask for Sonos

1282
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:39,485
Speaker 13:  headphones?

1283
01:19:39,995 --> 01:19:42,965
Speaker 6:  Have you, have you seen a pair in the wild? I was actually just wondering

1284
01:19:42,965 --> 01:19:45,965
Speaker 6:  about this the other day. I've seen, I have not heard one person even ask

1285
01:19:45,965 --> 01:19:47,485
Speaker 6:  about them since they came out.

1286
01:19:47,815 --> 01:19:51,405
Speaker 8:  Sonos was always like, it was a, it was a niche brand. I mean I I I have

1287
01:19:51,405 --> 01:19:55,005
Speaker 8:  a lot of Sonos speakers. It's always been a niche brand and it like

1288
01:19:55,645 --> 01:19:59,525
Speaker 8:  appetite to compete with the Apples of the world is like, don't, don't

1289
01:19:59,525 --> 01:20:02,285
Speaker 8:  do that. Yeah. They have so much more money than you. But

1290
01:20:02,285 --> 01:20:06,085
Speaker 6:  It's, it's been a niche brand with like huge brand recognition.

1291
01:20:06,085 --> 01:20:09,205
Speaker 6:  Right? Like I know a lot, lot of people who would never own Sonos stuff but

1292
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:10,605
Speaker 6:  kind of know what Sonos is.

1293
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:15,005
Speaker 8:  Yeah. But I don't think it's like at the same stage as like Bose No. Like,

1294
01:20:15,005 --> 01:20:18,125
Speaker 8:  like definitely not. Like I I would say the only people who know who Sonos

1295
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:21,885
Speaker 8:  is or that know what Sonos is are people who are fairly online and,

1296
01:20:21,945 --> 01:20:25,285
Speaker 8:  and so it's that kinda like really good online brand recognition. But

1297
01:20:25,645 --> 01:20:28,805
Speaker 13:  I think that even people who aren't online, they maybe didn't necessarily

1298
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:31,165
Speaker 13:  know what Sonos was, but they could be convinced to buy it.

1299
01:20:31,515 --> 01:20:31,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1300
01:20:32,715 --> 01:20:35,405
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Like you could walk into Best Buy and You can say, man, you know what,

1301
01:20:35,445 --> 01:20:38,685
Speaker 13:  I need some home. I need to hear music everywhere in my house. You would

1302
01:20:38,685 --> 01:20:40,685
Speaker 13:  say, you know, I got something for you. Yeah. What,

1303
01:20:40,865 --> 01:20:43,205
Speaker 6:  How much money. That's, I think, I think that's exactly right And I feel

1304
01:20:43,525 --> 01:20:47,405
Speaker 6:  like what Sonos has done here is totally torch that

1305
01:20:47,455 --> 01:20:50,845
Speaker 6:  reputation. Right. This sense of like, Sonos was always

1306
01:20:52,025 --> 01:20:55,925
Speaker 6:  too expensive but also the best. Right? Like tho those and, and You can

1307
01:20:55,925 --> 01:20:59,805
Speaker 6:  get people over too expensive in a lot of cases it it

1308
01:20:59,805 --> 01:21:03,485
Speaker 6:  is, it is just absolutely lighting on fire.

1309
01:21:03,555 --> 01:21:07,045
Speaker 6:  This reputation of it will do the thing that you want it to do exceptionally

1310
01:21:07,045 --> 01:21:10,525
Speaker 6:  well. 'cause it just doesn't anymore. Yeah. And like, and it, it,

1311
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:14,165
Speaker 6:  the road to get back to that seems like it is pretty long at this point for

1312
01:21:14,195 --> 01:21:16,845
Speaker 8:  This. There're still excellent airplay. Two speakers.

1313
01:21:17,635 --> 01:21:21,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Again, never, I couldn't even tell you if I have the Sonos app

1314
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:24,525
Speaker 6:  on my phone. Yeah. And I use Sonos all the time and it still sounds great.

1315
01:21:24,605 --> 01:21:25,525
Speaker 6:  I still love the speakers.

1316
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,925
Speaker 6:  Lord knows I'll not be updating that system anytime soon.

1317
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:34,005
Speaker 8:  I, I stopped using the app years ago because it, like, it forced me to reset

1318
01:21:34,025 --> 01:21:37,805
Speaker 8:  my entire system one too many times. And once I got it working with my

1319
01:21:37,805 --> 01:21:41,725
Speaker 8:  audio or with my tv, I was like, okay, I never touched this again. It's,

1320
01:21:41,725 --> 01:21:45,645
Speaker 8:  they're now airplay speakers. Yeah. Nobody tell me how I should

1321
01:21:45,645 --> 01:21:49,005
Speaker 8:  just get a receiver and a, and and big bookshelf speakers. I know

1322
01:21:49,475 --> 01:21:51,765
Speaker 8:  it's expensive. I already spent the money shut up.

1323
01:21:51,955 --> 01:21:54,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If you, I wonder if we're gonna get to the point where like if you

1324
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:58,445
Speaker 6:  have a phone and a sono system that is like all still running the old

1325
01:21:58,725 --> 01:22:01,085
Speaker 6:  software 'cause you never updated, that's gonna become like a thing You can

1326
01:22:01,085 --> 01:22:04,005
Speaker 6:  sell on eBay for way more money. Yes. Because it's the thing that still works.

1327
01:22:04,605 --> 01:22:06,085

Speaker 6:  Much.

1329
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:08,805
