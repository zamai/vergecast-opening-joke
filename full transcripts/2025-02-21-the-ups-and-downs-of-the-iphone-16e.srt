Description: Lots of gadget news this week! David, Jake Kastrenakes, and Allison Johnson start by talking about the iPhone 16E, which is both the cheapest compelling iPhone in a long time and a deeply odd addition to Apple's phone lineup. They also discuss the end of the Humane AI Pin, the latest from the Rabbit R1, and whether AI gadgets are even going to be a thing. After that, it's time for the lightning round: David and Jake talk about Amazon Chime, Mira Murati's new startup, and the future of James Bond. Then, in a special DOGE lightning round, Lauren Feiner joins the show to discuss everything happening with Trump, Musk, DOGE, and the US government. Because there's a lot of it.

2
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:36,265
Speaker 5:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the Humane

3
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:39,985
Speaker 5:  AI pin for what I assume will be the very last time I'm your friend

4
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:43,865
Speaker 5:  David Pierce. Neli is out on vacation somewhere. I don't even

5
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:47,225
Speaker 5:  know where he is. He's on a beach doing vacation things. He's gone. Jake

6
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:50,545
Speaker 5:  Kakis is here. Hi Jake. Hey, thanks for having me. It's been a minute. I'm

7
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:53,505
Speaker 5:  very happy you're back. Allison Johnson is also here. Hi Allison.

8
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:54,465
Speaker 6:  Hello

9
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:58,785
Speaker 5:  Allison. You're gonna hang with us for a while and then you're gonna go

10
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,185
Speaker 5:  do more fun things than hang with us. But we have a lot of stuff to talk

11
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:06,025
Speaker 5:  about. The Humane AI pin is dead and I think we

12
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,465
Speaker 5:  are obligated to spend several hours talking about that as the leading

13
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:13,465
Speaker 5:  publication on all things humane AI pin. There's a

14
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:17,345
Speaker 5:  new iPhone, Amazon Chime is dead, which no one has talked to me about

15
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,745
Speaker 5:  yet. And I have really strong feelings about that. I cannot wait to discuss.

16
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,265
Speaker 5:  There's a lot of politics stuff that we're gonna wait and get to at the very

17
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:26,745
Speaker 5:  end of the show. We are going to save as much Trump,

18
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:30,505
Speaker 5:  Elon DOGE stuff for the very end, and we're going to tell you when you can

19
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:33,745
Speaker 5:  stop listening If you don't want to hear it anymore. All that is coming.

20
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:38,105
Speaker 5:  Let's start with the iPhone. This is this, it's this like turned into sort

21
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:41,865
Speaker 5:  of an accidental iPhone launch. Alison, you, you wrote the story,

22
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,505
Speaker 5:  you've talked to folks. What is going on here? Tell us about this new phone.

23
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,185
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so we've been kind of expecting a new iPhone

24
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:53,545
Speaker 6:  SE successor for a little while now. The, the rumors were

25
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:57,465
Speaker 6:  swirling and what we got is the

26
00:02:57,465 --> 00:03:01,165
Speaker 6:  iPhone 16 E. The s SE series

27
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:03,125
Speaker 6:  is dead. Question mark,

28
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:04,685
Speaker 5:  Do we know what E stands for?

29
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:09,765
Speaker 6:  Okay. I like David Emil's explanation. It's E

30
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:12,805
Speaker 6:  stands for eggs and that's why it's so expensive.

31
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:16,445
Speaker 6:  No.

32
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:20,565
Speaker 5:  Okay, cool. Because S se was s se officially special edition or

33
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:23,925
Speaker 5:  was it one of those where like Apple just sort of makes up letters and refuses

34
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:24,685
Speaker 5:  to explain what they're,

35
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:28,365
Speaker 6:  I feel like Apple probably circulates a rumor that it was special

36
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:31,925
Speaker 6:  edition and we all just like repeat it and then it becomes fact.

37
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:36,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah, do not know. I do not know what e stands for. Easy

38
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:40,805
Speaker 6:  extra. I don't think either of those terms apply.

39
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,245
Speaker 6:  So the gist is like, it's sort of an

40
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:50,205
Speaker 6:  se successor, but they're really positioning it as like

41
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:54,165
Speaker 6:  part of the 16 family. So it's

42
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:58,405
Speaker 6:  a 6.1 inch screen. It's basically like an iPhone

43
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,605
Speaker 6:  14 kind of chassis.

44
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:06,245
Speaker 6:  So it's, it's a modern phone, which the last SE was

45
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:10,085
Speaker 6:  not. It had a tiny screen and it does,

46
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:11,765
Speaker 6:  apple intelligence of course

47
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:18,125
Speaker 6:  has wireless charging, but no mag safe, which is a

48
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:21,565
Speaker 6:  very weird reality. And

49
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:26,325
Speaker 6:  all the kinds of like modern iPhone things you

50
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:30,205
Speaker 6:  would expect, like what are we on a 18 processor now? Oh,

51
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:33,965
Speaker 6:  and the new Apple modem, the C one,

52
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:37,285
Speaker 6:  so Right. This is its debut appearance.

53
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:40,365
Speaker 5:  So I, I wanna talk about the C one separately 'cause I think that's super

54
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:43,285
Speaker 5:  interesting. But the more I look at this phone,

55
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:46,775
Speaker 5:  the less I think I understand why it exists.

56
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:52,015
Speaker 5:  Except like If you just wanna say Apple should sell a phone for

57
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:56,175
Speaker 5:  less than $800. Sure, fine. Whatever. Apple

58
00:04:56,435 --> 00:05:00,375
Speaker 5:  itself has never bought into that theory like this. This company

59
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:03,695
Speaker 5:  has spent the entirety of its smartphone selling life,

60
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,775
Speaker 5:  refusing to sell cheap smartphones because it can make a lot of money and

61
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:11,535
Speaker 5:  sell a lot of phones for a lot more money. So I

62
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:15,375
Speaker 5:  don't buy that as the whole reason for the existence of the 16 e.

63
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:19,535
Speaker 5:  This the se weirdly I understood more

64
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:23,455
Speaker 5:  'cause it's like, look, you want the little phone? Here it is. They did it

65
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:25,815
Speaker 5:  with the mini, they did it with the, it's like, look, it's cheaper, it's

66
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:26,095
Speaker 5:  smaller.

67
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:30,095
Speaker 7:  It wasn't the little phone, it was the, we kind of forgot about this.

68
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,575
Speaker 7:  We still have some lying around. Yeah, it's

69
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:33,175
Speaker 5:  Fair. If you'll,

70
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,175
Speaker 7:  If you'll take it like you'll give us money. Sure, yeah,

71
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:39,975
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's like the leftover bin of funds, which weirdly is a strategy I

72
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:41,415
Speaker 5:  actually understand more. Yeah. Which

73
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:45,015
Speaker 7:  I, I I, I personally, I was offended by the SE line,

74
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:49,255
Speaker 7:  the se he was, it was embarrassing like that that should not have been

75
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:50,695
Speaker 7:  allowed in stores. This is

76
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:51,455
Speaker 6:  A hot take.

77
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:55,655
Speaker 7:  This is, I I I think it's a completely reasonable take this, this

78
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,285
Speaker 7:  phone. Ha it had the design of essentially the iPhone

79
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:03,365
Speaker 7:  six. It, it has been a decade and they

80
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:04,525
Speaker 7:  were still selling that thing.

81
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:07,845
Speaker 5:  Apple shows me the SE and just had it only be

82
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:11,845
Speaker 5:  refurbished. Like, just, just never even acknowledge that it's a new phone

83
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:15,485
Speaker 5:  just jumps straight to like it's in the

84
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:18,925
Speaker 5:  clearance section at a Best Buy. Like that's, that's what the SE should have

85
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:19,045
Speaker 5:  been.

86
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:20,805
Speaker 6:  Someone's old iPhone. Yeah.

87
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:24,045
Speaker 5:  Right. And even though no one's ever had it, it's been sitting in a factory

88
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:26,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah. For six years. Right. So like sure it's

89
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:29,845
Speaker 6:  Old. Yeah. The previous se the outgoing one, it was bad.

90
00:06:30,045 --> 00:06:33,885
Speaker 6:  I mean, the screen was way too small for like a modern phone. It did

91
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:37,885
Speaker 6:  feel like kind of leftovers. I, but, but it

92
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:41,245
Speaker 6:  cost $429 with like

93
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,565
Speaker 6:  poultry 64 gigabytes of storage. So that's like

94
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:49,845
Speaker 6:  kind of, you figure out that's like a $500 phone. So that was

95
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:53,485
Speaker 6:  something that was like, hey, sure you want a cheap

96
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:57,365
Speaker 6:  kind of iPhone that exists. I

97
00:06:57,365 --> 00:07:00,805
Speaker 6:  didn't think anybody should buy it, but it was there. So this one costs

98
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:05,125
Speaker 6:  5 99 with 128 gigs of storage, which is

99
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:08,805
Speaker 6:  like a, a reasonable amount of storage in a modern

100
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:12,765
Speaker 6:  screen, but that's like way more expensive. So yeah,

101
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,165
Speaker 6:  we're not talking about a cheap iPhone

102
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:18,645
Speaker 6:  anymore. We're not talking about like

103
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:23,965
Speaker 6:  the like cost to feature trade off

104
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:27,445
Speaker 6:  is just like all outta whack this time. I feel like

105
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:31,965
Speaker 7:  From the Apple making money perspective, I'll agree. I don't, I don't totally

106
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:35,405
Speaker 7:  understand. Right. 'cause they, they want to go high-end expensive

107
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:39,205
Speaker 7:  from the value prop for the average buyer.

108
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:44,005
Speaker 7:  It, you know, my early take is this is going to be the phone

109
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:47,845
Speaker 7:  to buy. Interesting. Right. This is almost

110
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:51,405
Speaker 7:  everything you'd get from the standard iPhone 16 for $200 less,

111
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:53,725
Speaker 7:  $200 for MagSafe, whatever.

112
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,605
Speaker 5:  I could not disagree more. This is so fun. Oh

113
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:57,365
Speaker 7:  Really?

114
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:00,365
Speaker 5:  So we've all been reviewing phones for a very long time and, and I think

115
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:03,805
Speaker 5:  the thing that I have had drilled into my head over a decade

116
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:08,645
Speaker 5:  is that the difference in actual cost in

117
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:12,605
Speaker 5:  terms of like how people feel it between a $500 phone and

118
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:16,565
Speaker 5:  a thousand dollars phone is smaller than you think. And the it,

119
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:20,645
Speaker 5:  the, there has been no market for a $600 phone for 10

120
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:23,845
Speaker 5:  years because it doesn't matter because that's not how people buy phones.

121
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,805
Speaker 5:  Because people trade in their phones to remove the costs. They pay

122
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:30,605
Speaker 5:  them over time. So it's, it comes out to like a couple of dollars a month.

123
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:34,165
Speaker 5:  Like people keep their phones a long time so they're able to amortize the

124
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:37,765
Speaker 5:  cost over a long period of time. So the idea like if this were $199,

125
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:41,045
Speaker 5:  I would, I would be all in on it. And I would completely agree with you Jake,

126
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:44,405
Speaker 5:  that like, bang for your buck, this is the best iPhone

127
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:48,845
Speaker 5:  at five ninety nine. I'm like, okay, you're looking at, I dunno,

128
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:52,885
Speaker 5:  a dollar 50 a month less on your thing and

129
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:57,165
Speaker 5:  who that is a bad trade. And so I'm at the point now where

130
00:08:57,165 --> 00:09:00,625
Speaker 5:  like I wanna talk about the trade offs Apple made here. 'cause I think they're

131
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:04,065
Speaker 5:  actually really interesting. But e even absent all of those,

132
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:06,175
Speaker 5:  I'm like, I

133
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:10,215
Speaker 5:  even if every trade off is the right one, and I don't think they made all

134
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:14,025
Speaker 5:  the right trade offs. It's, it's not that big a

135
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:17,585
Speaker 5:  savings, I don't know, like cut this price in half. And I think it's super

136
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:17,985
Speaker 5:  interesting.

137
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:21,065
Speaker 7:  I think there are so many people who are just like, what, what iPhone should

138
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:23,865
Speaker 7:  I buy? If you have to ask that question, get this one.

139
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:27,785
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So the, the test keys is my husband,

140
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:32,545
Speaker 6:  he has an iPhone 10 R it barely,

141
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,025
Speaker 6:  you know, gets through a day and he was just like, it's

142
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:40,985
Speaker 6:  time to buy a new iPhone. He's the person who will just be like,

143
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:44,785
Speaker 6:  which one's the cheapest? I'll take that one. I asked him, I was like, are

144
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:48,225
Speaker 6:  you gonna miss Mag safe? And he said, what is mag safe? So

145
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,665
Speaker 6:  there you go. All

146
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:53,385
Speaker 5:  Right. Well you have done your husband a great disservice, Allison.

147
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:54,985
Speaker 6:  I know

148
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:58,545
Speaker 7:  We have to test it. We have to see if it's good, but assuming it is, it is

149
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:00,465
Speaker 7:  as like expected.

150
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:05,575
Speaker 7:  I don't know what you would be missing out on. Right? Like I think If you

151
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:09,535
Speaker 7:  got the, the old se I would be like, that looks like an old phone. Right?

152
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,455
Speaker 7:  You're not, you're gonna have a very different experience. The 16 e, same

153
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:17,495
Speaker 7:  processor, same screen, everything is is is essentially

154
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:20,575
Speaker 7:  the same as the, the standard 16. You're just like not missing out in the

155
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:21,655
Speaker 7:  same way that you used to be.

156
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:25,935
Speaker 5:  I do largely agree with that. And again, I think the, the, I think the only

157
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:29,775
Speaker 5:  thing I'm really thrown by here is that this thing is like $200 more

158
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:33,415
Speaker 5:  expensive than makes sense for it to be in my head. But let, let's put that

159
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:37,055
Speaker 5:  aside for a minute. So I, I do think the trade-offs Apple is making here

160
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:39,815
Speaker 5:  are really interesting for exactly that reason, Jake, because what they're

161
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:43,575
Speaker 5:  clearly trying to do is get rid of all the things you don't care about

162
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:47,175
Speaker 5:  down to a price that is more affordable,

163
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:52,295
Speaker 5:  but essentially solves the, it'll still do all the iPhone things you need

164
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:55,975
Speaker 5:  it to thing. So Alison, I I, this is a

165
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:58,575
Speaker 5:  complicated thing to ask you to do off the top of your head, but like between

166
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:02,775
Speaker 5:  the, the iPhone 16, which until this week was the, the base one

167
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:06,695
Speaker 5:  in the line and the 16 e, what are the things you lose

168
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,015
Speaker 5:  by downgrading the 200?

169
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:11,095
Speaker 6:  I think MagSafe is a big one.

170
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:17,175
Speaker 6:  I mean, the complicating thing in there is that the iPhone 15 is

171
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:20,935
Speaker 6:  still a thing you can buy. Right? So Apple,

172
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:24,655
Speaker 5:  Ignore that for now. We'll come back to that. Yeah. But I think the, the,

173
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:28,295
Speaker 5:  like the should you buy last year's phone thing just makes everything

174
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:31,255
Speaker 5:  complicated. So let's just throw that out for now. Okay. Let's just go 16

175
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,095
Speaker 5:  versus 16 E

176
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:35,215
Speaker 6:  For now. Yeah. So 16 E does the,

177
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:40,255
Speaker 6:  the thing where it has one camera so you lose the ultra

178
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,015
Speaker 6:  wide and with that you lose the macro

179
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,175
Speaker 6:  capabilities. So there's that

180
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:52,225
Speaker 6:  again, not a thing my husband is gonna care about. I keep coming

181
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:52,705
Speaker 6:  back to,

182
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:59,115
Speaker 6:  yeah, I, it's not a huge list of things. I don't think the camera

183
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:02,275
Speaker 6:  control obviously is not there. You get that action button.

184
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,365
Speaker 6:  That's kind of it. Am I missing anything? Huge.

185
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,725
Speaker 7:  You lose the dynamic island

186
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:11,445
Speaker 5:  Dynamic.

187
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Instead, so

188
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,885
Speaker 5:  If I'm being completely honest, you

189
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:20,525
Speaker 7:  Are a, a dynamic island fan boy. I know. No, I

190
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:24,325
Speaker 5:  Know the opposite. I, I had to, I had to tap on

191
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:28,285
Speaker 5:  my phone screen to double check and make sure that the 16 didn't

192
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:29,525
Speaker 5:  also have a notch. Like

193
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:34,725
Speaker 5:  I cannot, I don't know, the dynamic island is actually neat. Like as somebody

194
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:38,085
Speaker 5:  who follows sports a lot, the idea of having the the little live activities

195
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:41,125
Speaker 5:  is, is great. I actually think Apple has done that really well.

196
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:46,625
Speaker 5:  Don't think it's a thing I would like miss in a huge constant way.

197
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,545
Speaker 5:  If I didn't have it anymore, pay

198
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:52,505
Speaker 7:  $200 more and get better access to sports scores. That's a selling

199
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:52,785
Speaker 7:  point.

200
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:55,105
Speaker 5:  I feel like that would work.

201
00:12:56,645 --> 00:13:00,465
Speaker 5:  The one other spec I think that has made a a lot of people feel

202
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:04,265
Speaker 5:  feelings is the 60 Hertz display on the 16 E. And I think

203
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:08,465
Speaker 5:  again, if, if the rubric is, does Allison's husband care?

204
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,545
Speaker 5:  The answer is almost certainly no. We've talked about this on the show before,

205
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:15,745
Speaker 5:  but like I downgraded from, I've had a pro or a pro Max

206
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:20,155
Speaker 5:  every year for years, and I downgraded to the, the 16

207
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:23,955
Speaker 5:  because I wanted the blue one. A decision I have never

208
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:27,835
Speaker 5:  for one second regretted. Like, I'm not kidding. It is, it was such a good

209
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:31,955
Speaker 5:  decision. The blue one makes me so happy. The 60 hertz display

210
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:35,635
Speaker 5:  thing is like, it's really noticeable If you hold two phones

211
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:39,355
Speaker 5:  side by side, one with the 60 hertz display and one with 120 hertz promotion

212
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:43,155
Speaker 5:  display, it is a real meaningful upgrade. I

213
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,715
Speaker 5:  do not believe it has changed my day-to-day experience of using an iPhone

214
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:49,635
Speaker 5:  one tiny iota. Yeah. Like I just, I don't see it.

215
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:53,235
Speaker 6:  I always notice it like right when I switch from a

216
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:57,635
Speaker 6:  120 hertz display to a phone with 60 hertz for

217
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:01,235
Speaker 6:  like a day and then I kind of forget about it. And then it's nice when I

218
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:04,715
Speaker 6:  go back to the 120 hertz display, I'm like, Ooh, this is really smooth and

219
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:08,675
Speaker 6:  nice. But yeah, I think it's, it's a thing you can put outta your mind or

220
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,795
Speaker 6:  a lot of people can, some people can't and that's fine. It, it's like

221
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:16,875
Speaker 6:  weird. The apple doesn't include it. It's, you know,

222
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:21,115
Speaker 6:  we, when we're comparing this to the regular iPhone

223
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:24,955
Speaker 6:  16, it's like, yeah, they all have a 60 hertz display, but that

224
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:28,795
Speaker 6:  kind of forgets the fact that like, maybe they shouldn't, I think

225
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:32,595
Speaker 6:  it sort of highlights. I I mean you can pick up any Android

226
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:36,475
Speaker 6:  phone that's $500. It has 120 hertz display, but that's, I

227
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,355
Speaker 6:  don't know. So the

228
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:41,355
Speaker 7:  Rumors, the, the rumor out there are,

229
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:45,475
Speaker 7:  are suggesting that the iPhone 17, just the standard one is gonna get

230
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:47,475
Speaker 7:  the promotion one 20 oh display.

231
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:48,555
Speaker 5:  Oh, interesting. Which

232
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,685
Speaker 7:  I think maybe actually puts the 16 EA little bit more in

233
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:56,325
Speaker 7:  perspective. Like you can see they're gonna level up the baseline one,

234
00:14:57,425 --> 00:15:00,605
Speaker 7:  the pro model has already has a bunch of differentiators.

235
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:05,965
Speaker 7:  I think it starts to separate those levels a little bit more

236
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:09,605
Speaker 7:  clearly than the e versus the standard right now where it's like, you

237
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:10,145
Speaker 7:  know,

238
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:14,785
Speaker 5:  That is yet another piece of evidence that suggests

239
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:18,185
Speaker 5:  something that I don't wanna believe and have no evidence for, which is that

240
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:22,225
Speaker 5:  the whole iPhone lineup is about to get more expensive. Oh. Which I

241
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:25,865
Speaker 5:  think would make the 16 EI think might seem cheaper in September

242
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:28,465
Speaker 5:  than it does right now. And that is a thing that I worry about.

243
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,025
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I believe that,

244
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,025
Speaker 7:  I mean, I I know you said where you'd save politics for later, so I give

245
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,185
Speaker 7:  brief, but like

246
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:38,265
Speaker 5:  Tariffs are allowed. We, we can tariffs matter to every gadget we buy that

247
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:38,585
Speaker 5:  counts.

248
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:42,805
Speaker 7:  Is this phone $600 if the tariffs didn't

249
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:46,405
Speaker 7:  hit or is it right or or is it $600 because they know the

250
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:49,885
Speaker 7:  tariffs are here because they know the other phones are probably gonna have

251
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:52,685
Speaker 7:  to get more expensive. Yeah, that feels really possible to me.

252
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:57,045
Speaker 6:  The thing if, if this phone was $500, like

253
00:15:57,515 --> 00:16:01,005
Speaker 6:  sold, you know, MagSafe fine, whatever, it feels like a

254
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:04,685
Speaker 6:  $500 phone that they're charging $600 for. So I'm, I will

255
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:07,605
Speaker 6:  accept any theory about why that is.

256
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:12,325
Speaker 5:  I do think there, there is an interesting piece of math in there that is,

257
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:16,325
Speaker 5:  is what people are upgrading from and how much they're getting

258
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:20,325
Speaker 5:  in trade-in value right now. Because I think like if you're coming from,

259
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:25,245
Speaker 5:  I don't know, an iPhone 13 let's say, and

260
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:29,165
Speaker 5:  you're getting like three or $400 in trade-in value and that would turn

261
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:32,925
Speaker 5:  a $500 16 e into like a hundred dollars phone. Like

262
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:37,365
Speaker 5:  that's what becomes pretty compelling. And I think

263
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,125
Speaker 5:  this is why the phone price thing is so complicated because everybody is

264
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:45,165
Speaker 5:  actually paying a different price. The the price of a phone is not

265
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:48,605
Speaker 5:  the price of a phone. It is actually dependent on so many other things,

266
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:52,165
Speaker 5:  especially in the US where everything is mediated by carriers and everything

267
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:55,805
Speaker 5:  has long-term deals. It's just a mess. Like I, I have to

268
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:59,405
Speaker 5:  buy my wife a new phone because she is just

269
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:03,045
Speaker 5:  spectacularly good at breaking her phones. I love her very much and she just

270
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:06,925
Speaker 5:  can't keep a phone alive and just try. She's basically in, she's

271
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:10,285
Speaker 5:  a, an Android diehard and absolutely steadfastly refuses to get an iPhone

272
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:13,165
Speaker 5:  even though it would make it easier to video chat with our entire family.

273
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:14,245
Speaker 7:  Can we have her on the show?

274
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:19,005
Speaker 5:  She would love to be on the show and tell me how irritating her phone choices

275
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:19,325
Speaker 5:  are.

276
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I I need this, I need this.

277
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:26,165
Speaker 5:  But she is basically like, all I want is like a pretty good phone that's

278
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:28,605
Speaker 5:  pretty cheap. Which, which one do I get? And I have found that to be such

279
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:32,405
Speaker 5:  a more complicated question to answer than I ever expected. Especially because

280
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,765
Speaker 5:  like now I'm like, oh, well the, the pixel nine A is probably coming soon,

281
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:39,045
Speaker 5:  but then as soon as that comes out, like the Pixel eight will be a lot cheaper

282
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:42,365
Speaker 5:  and that's probably a better, and it's just like all of this is so confusing

283
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:46,485
Speaker 5:  and so I I find myself spending less time worrying about how much a phone

284
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:48,685
Speaker 5:  costs unless it is like

285
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,715
Speaker 5:  $300 and then it then it counts, right? Yeah. And then it's like, okay, this

286
00:17:53,715 --> 00:17:54,555
Speaker 5:  is a very cheap phone now.

287
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:58,675
Speaker 6:  That's what it kind of feels like the, the SE was in the territory of

288
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:02,515
Speaker 6:  like, you could pay that out of pocket or I think that

289
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:06,435
Speaker 6:  a, a good chunk of people could pay that out of pocket. Yeah. It wasn't out

290
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:10,115
Speaker 6:  of the question. An $800 phone I is different.

291
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:14,195
Speaker 6:  And then yeah, once you get to $600, does that push it into

292
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:17,515
Speaker 6:  the bracket of like, well I don't have that lying around.

293
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:21,955
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna subsidize this through my carrier. And then you get into what are

294
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:25,715
Speaker 6:  the deals right now, what are they offering? And I did this with my hairstylist

295
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:29,875
Speaker 6:  recently when it's like, you, what phone do you buy? And

296
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:33,995
Speaker 6:  we ended up starting with like what carrier deals are

297
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:37,835
Speaker 6:  there right now. And that's how we got to like she has the Pixel

298
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:38,675
Speaker 6:  nine now and I

299
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:39,995
Speaker 5:  That's such a sad state of affairs.

300
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:44,315
Speaker 6:  It's like, look through coupons, what is Mint Mobile gonna give

301
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:48,155
Speaker 6:  you for free? And it was like, well that was the

302
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:52,075
Speaker 6:  better deal than paying for something else out of pocket. So

303
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:52,475
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

304
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:56,315
Speaker 5:  Says an awful lot about the state of smartphones that that is the case. Sure

305
00:18:56,315 --> 00:19:00,145
Speaker 5:  it does. Let's talk about MagSafe because I think this is

306
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:04,025
Speaker 5:  the, of all the trades that Apple made, this is the one that I

307
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:07,905
Speaker 5:  stuck on. And Alison, it sounds like you did the same that it was like, is

308
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:11,705
Speaker 5:  this, is this a correct trade off to make

309
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:14,505
Speaker 5:  in exchange for making a phone cheaper? Jake, I don't know how you feel about

310
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:18,265
Speaker 5:  MagSafe. You notoriously, Jake runs around the office hating MagSafe. So

311
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:22,105
Speaker 5:  Yes, I it's true. I, well I have a Pixel eight and so I have never

312
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:25,265
Speaker 5:  even seen a magnet in my life. I

313
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:30,385
Speaker 5:  not sure what they're used for. So the thing everybody says about MagSafe

314
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,865
Speaker 5:  is that it's for, it's for wireless charging and that is true,

315
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:38,265
Speaker 5:  but it's also only part of why I really like MagSafe. Like

316
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:42,305
Speaker 5:  I have no case, but I have a, I have a mag safe pop

317
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,985
Speaker 5:  socket on the back of my phone and this is how I hold my phone

318
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:46,225
Speaker 6:  And that stays on there.

319
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:50,305
Speaker 5:  It stays on it, it slides around in a way that is like very fun

320
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:54,425
Speaker 5:  to fidget with and also very dangerous. But it has never once

321
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:58,585
Speaker 5:  actually fallen off while I have been using it. So, okay, for now

322
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,865
Speaker 5:  we're, we're still alive, but also like I have a, I have a a stand

323
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:06,345
Speaker 5:  here that I put my phone on when I'm sitting at my computer so that I can

324
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:10,185
Speaker 5:  look at it directly and unlock it that way and do like two-factor

325
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:13,825
Speaker 5:  authentication and that kind of thing. It I have, I have one in my car that

326
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:17,785
Speaker 5:  mag saves too. It's like I see it less as a, as a

327
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:22,305
Speaker 5:  charging system and more like an accessory system. And the MagSafe accessory

328
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,785
Speaker 5:  system is actually really good now. And I think like

329
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:28,585
Speaker 5:  there are going to be a lot of people who get this phone and switch from

330
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:32,585
Speaker 5:  lightning to USBC and that's going to be annoying but good because

331
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:36,265
Speaker 5:  all of your gadgets are going to be USBC and life with all of your gadgets

332
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:39,785
Speaker 5:  being USBC is better. But I think there are going to be a bunch of people

333
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,425
Speaker 5:  who miss out on a big part of what makes the iPhone

334
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:47,285
Speaker 5:  ecosystem great, which is increasingly filled with MagSafe

335
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:47,485
Speaker 5:  stuff.

336
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:52,165
Speaker 6:  So we don't have a lot of MagSafe in my house either with

337
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,405
Speaker 6:  my husband having the 10 R

338
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,725
Speaker 5:  And you having every phone that exists simultaneously.

339
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,925
Speaker 6:  I have all the phones, so I just do like regular wireless charging, which

340
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:03,845
Speaker 6:  the 16 E does do wireless charging without the MagSafe.

341
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:07,565
Speaker 6:  Right. But something that our, our colleague Jen

342
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:11,525
Speaker 6:  Tuey said was that one of her kids, her

343
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:15,365
Speaker 6:  like kind of older kids doesn't have is

344
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:18,765
Speaker 6:  the last person in the house without mag safe. And it's becoming a problem

345
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:23,125
Speaker 6:  because everybody else can use the MagSafe accessories and she's the one

346
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,285
Speaker 6:  stuck without it. So that was really like, okay, this is maybe like

347
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:30,085
Speaker 6:  if your household is invested in this,

348
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:35,165
Speaker 6:  I can see how that would be annoying. And the thing I'm thinking about

349
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:39,125
Speaker 6:  is If you hold onto this phone for seven years, which

350
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:41,685
Speaker 6:  my husband Charlie would do that,

351
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:46,965
Speaker 6:  is it gonna be annoying in seven years that he doesn't have mag safe? And

352
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:50,525
Speaker 6:  I'm like, can't you just stick your phone to the wall over here?

353
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:54,845
Speaker 6:  Whatever we're doing then, I dunno. It is, it is the thing that feels like

354
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:59,485
Speaker 6:  why like on a $500 phone maybe I could see no mag safe.

355
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:03,925
Speaker 6:  Just why, why did they leave it out? It it's irritating.

356
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:07,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It struck me as the most obvious sort of

357
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:11,725
Speaker 5:  missing feature. Like the rest of the stuff is downgrades on things.

358
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:15,725
Speaker 5:  And I'm actually coming around to the camera choice. I think one of the things

359
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:18,365
Speaker 5:  I saw, and I, I forget who was posting about it, but basically the argument

360
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:22,325
Speaker 5:  that they made is you can now make iPhone decisions based on how much

361
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:25,125
Speaker 5:  you care about the camera. And I actually think that makes a lot of sense,

362
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,645
Speaker 5:  right? Like If you just look at the iPhone as a series of, of kind of

363
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:32,045
Speaker 5:  base camera to excellent camera and you just pay more for more camera,

364
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:35,365
Speaker 5:  that's actually like the simplest way to think about the iPhone line now

365
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:38,685
Speaker 5:  and kind of works. And I think most people

366
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:43,075
Speaker 5:  just want a thing that takes pictures, right? Like that's it,

367
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:45,635
Speaker 5:  it'll take pretty good pictures. You don't have to think a ton about it.

368
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:48,755
Speaker 5:  You'll, you, you open the thing with the action button and take a photo and

369
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:51,915
Speaker 5:  move on. It's your day. Like I think that describes most people's iPhone

370
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:54,675
Speaker 5:  photography and if it doesn't describe you, you're not gonna buy the 16 e

371
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:58,475
Speaker 5:  Anyway. So that I think I've, I've actually come around to,

372
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:01,075
Speaker 5:  we also know cameras are a really expensive part of smartphones. So If you

373
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:05,035
Speaker 5:  wanna save money on smartphones, that is one way to do it. MagSafe is one

374
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:08,435
Speaker 5:  that it's like, this feels like a thing that you've gone from

375
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:12,175
Speaker 5:  not just having better to having worse like the screen or the camera, but

376
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:15,855
Speaker 5:  to just not having anymore and like the camera control, I can happily

377
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:19,335
Speaker 5:  lose because I don't ever ever use the camera control on my iPhone.

378
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:23,335
Speaker 5:  Maybe that's just me. I just don't, I don't like it, I don't use it. I forget

379
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,175
Speaker 5:  it's there for weeks at a time. MagSafe is, is like a

380
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:30,535
Speaker 5:  core part of the iPhone for me now and I, I feel like it would be very hard

381
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,375
Speaker 5:  to get rid of that. What

382
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:35,175
Speaker 7:  They're doing in the Android world right now is that because basically none

383
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:38,975
Speaker 7:  of the phones have a mag safe equivalent, which they should.

384
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:41,935
Speaker 7:  There's a whole standard for it called she two. It's existed for a year and

385
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:45,565
Speaker 7:  a half at this point. The case companies are just putting a ring of magnets

386
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:48,645
Speaker 7:  in their cases. So If you have a phone that supports wireless charging, you

387
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:52,245
Speaker 7:  just buy a MagSafe compatible case, slap it on, and now you've got

388
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:55,725
Speaker 7:  MagSafe. Now it's obviously not quite as good because you can't use those

389
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:59,605
Speaker 7:  accessories like the super slim, you know, wallet that just smacks right

390
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:03,555
Speaker 7:  onto the, the phone itself. But you know, If you are somebody

391
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,165
Speaker 7:  who just really wants Max, If you can get it, there's ways to get it true.

392
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:11,325
Speaker 7:  And I suspect that's a possible outcome for the, for the 16 E

393
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,685
Speaker 7:  here. Surely somebody's gonna fill that market,

394
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:18,525
Speaker 7:  you know, it's not as elegant. I agree with you. I I think there's probably

395
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:21,405
Speaker 7:  gonna be a lot of people who are bummed about this, but there's, there's

396
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:25,165
Speaker 7:  some options and the, the Android world has lived slightly

397
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:28,045
Speaker 7:  unapply without it for a few years now.

398
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:32,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. I think, I think the the case thing is actually a pretty

399
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:36,725
Speaker 5:  good argument and, and like you can get into this ecosystem

400
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,605
Speaker 5:  If you really want to and like honestly the way Apple is

401
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:43,445
Speaker 5:  gonna sell this based on the way that they sell everything else is like,

402
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:46,685
Speaker 5:  well If you want all that stuff, it's only $200 more. Yeah. Like this,

403
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:50,085
Speaker 5:  it's such a, they now have the thing where they're gonna be able to sell.

404
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:53,925
Speaker 5:  You start with the 599 phone and then you're gonna accidentally leave the

405
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,085
Speaker 5:  store with like a $2,000 pro max and you'll be like, I don't understand how

406
00:24:57,085 --> 00:25:00,965
Speaker 5:  this happened. All I wanted was MagSafe. And that is a thing Apple

407
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:04,565
Speaker 5:  is extraordinarily good at. Before we get off this subject, and

408
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:08,165
Speaker 5:  Allison, you're gonna review this thing at some point and when you do, we'll

409
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:10,525
Speaker 5:  have to check back in because I'm, I'm very curious what it's like to actually

410
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:14,605
Speaker 5:  live with some of these tradeoffs after using the big fancy

411
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:18,485
Speaker 5:  iPhones, but we should talk about why this modem is a big deal. Jake, can

412
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,165
Speaker 5:  you explain why this modem is a big deal?

413
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:23,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah, apple has been trying to make its own

414
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:28,245
Speaker 7:  cell phone modems for years at this point. You know, I think we

415
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:31,805
Speaker 7:  all know they have increasingly been trying to make more and more of their

416
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:35,765
Speaker 7:  own in-house parts and that has worked out really phenomenally well for things

417
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:39,845
Speaker 7:  like processors. They have really struggled when it

418
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:43,365
Speaker 7:  comes to the modem. At one point

419
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:48,655
Speaker 7:  Intel really wanted to get into the cell phone modem game. And so

420
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:52,735
Speaker 7:  Intel had this big unit working on cell

421
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:56,375
Speaker 7:  phone modems and it was not going well at all. Apple

422
00:25:56,635 --> 00:26:00,335
Speaker 7:  at the same time wasn't going well for them either. Apple bought

423
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:03,975
Speaker 7:  Intel's entire team Oh, that's great. An entire team that was

424
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:08,055
Speaker 7:  failing. Yeah. And so fast forward several more

425
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:11,855
Speaker 7:  years, they have taken that team and they have finally put together

426
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:15,855
Speaker 7:  a modem and we haven't got a chance to test it out. I think this is really

427
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:16,455
Speaker 7:  interesting because

428
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:22,175
Speaker 7:  If you look at the iPhone 16 E, we've essentially tested

429
00:26:22,385 --> 00:26:25,895
Speaker 7:  every part of it in other phones before. The

430
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:30,175
Speaker 7:  one new thing here is the C one, which is what Apple is calling is first

431
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:34,295
Speaker 7:  modem. And Whether it can

432
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:38,175
Speaker 7:  keep up with the standard Qualcomm modem that has been in every

433
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,495
Speaker 7:  other iPhone is going to be the big question here

434
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:42,735
Speaker 7:  because

435
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:46,565
Speaker 5:  That is a thing people will notice if their cell connection is spotty and

436
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:49,245
Speaker 5:  drops out. I don't know If you guys have seen this, but the, the conspiracy

437
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:53,005
Speaker 5:  theories about this are just rampant No in our comments

438
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:57,165
Speaker 5:  on Reddit everywhere and, and the the leading conspiracy theories that Apple

439
00:26:57,225 --> 00:27:01,165
Speaker 5:  has actually been sabotaging the Qualcomm modems in the other iPhones

440
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:04,965
Speaker 5:  in order to make it so that the performance gap between those phones and

441
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:08,845
Speaker 5:  the 16 God is small. I should be clear that there's absolutely no reason

442
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:12,645
Speaker 5:  to believe any of this. Oh no, I think somebody was like, oh, there's a

443
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:15,645
Speaker 5:  Qualcomm chip, but they use the other more mysterious Qualcomm chip and I'm

444
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:18,885
Speaker 5:  like, I don't know what a mysterious Qualcomm chip is, but like, it it is,

445
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:23,285
Speaker 5:  it it is a really interesting and measurable thing, right? Like to your point,

446
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:26,085
Speaker 5:  Jake, you're gonna be able to hold two iPhones next to each other. And the

447
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:29,205
Speaker 5:  only reason one would get faster speeds than the other is because Apple made

448
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:32,685
Speaker 5:  one and Qualcomm made the other. And I have a feeling actually both

449
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:36,205
Speaker 5:  companies are going to be very nervous about how that's gonna go. Because

450
00:27:36,795 --> 00:27:40,605
Speaker 5:  like if, If you Qualcomm, you look at what Apple has done to the Silicon

451
00:27:41,015 --> 00:27:44,765
Speaker 5:  world over the last several years and has the way it has just lapped

452
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:48,045
Speaker 5:  intel in particular on all kinds of different devices.

453
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:52,285
Speaker 5:  And if you're Qualcomm, that suddenly starts to seem sort of nerve wracking.

454
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:55,965
Speaker 5:  You're, you've been like the only company in this game for decades and you

455
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:59,365
Speaker 5:  have made an awful lot of money by being the only one who makes modems that

456
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:02,805
Speaker 5:  are any good. And then if you're Apple, you're like, oh God, we've we bought

457
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:06,725
Speaker 5:  this crappy team from Intel. We put all this time and energy

458
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:09,845
Speaker 5:  into it. We've, we've sort of staked our thing in the ground and it's not

459
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:13,765
Speaker 5:  like if we have Antennagate two because the C one isn't very

460
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:16,285
Speaker 5:  good, that's gonna be a really tough look for Apple.

461
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:20,685
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna be careful to hold it correctly. I

462
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:21,925
Speaker 6:  dunno, it's

463
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:25,085
Speaker 5:  A weird thing. Think the way is you hold it sort of by the, by the top middle

464
00:28:25,265 --> 00:28:26,245
Speaker 5:  and just kind of dangle

465
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:30,805
Speaker 6:  Your phone. That's not what I plan to do. No, it's a really strange thing

466
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:34,645
Speaker 6:  to be contemplating or a review of this device

467
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:38,685
Speaker 6:  and it's like a, a modem is a, a solved problem,

468
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:42,365
Speaker 6:  you know, in every other phone where I'm like, it's, it's something I am

469
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:44,165
Speaker 6:  like aware of when I test a

470
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:47,725
Speaker 5:  Phone. Well it's, it's a solved problem parentheses by Qualcomm, right?

471
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,925
Speaker 5:  In every way. It's just Qualcomm all the way down. Well, it's just, you

472
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:54,685
Speaker 6:  Put the Qualcomm thing in your phone, it works. I nev rarely

473
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:58,645
Speaker 6:  notice like, oh, the, you know, signal seems

474
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:02,485
Speaker 6:  to be dropping out and it shouldn't. But yeah, this

475
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:06,325
Speaker 6:  is, this is something I'll be on obviously, you know, very interested

476
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:10,325
Speaker 6:  in with the 16 E. So we'll

477
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:10,445
Speaker 6:  see.

478
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:14,765
Speaker 5:  I'm kind of excited about it. I first got into tech journalism

479
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:17,885
Speaker 5:  and reviewing phones like right as LTE was becoming a thing,

480
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:22,405
Speaker 5:  which feels like thousands of years ago now. But like doing the thing

481
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:26,325
Speaker 5:  where you just wander around on the streets taking a hundred speed tests

482
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:30,245
Speaker 5:  just to see what happens is like a surprisingly joyful part of

483
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:30,445
Speaker 5:  these.

484
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's gonna be a throwback.

485
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:33,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

486
00:29:33,795 --> 00:29:35,325
Speaker 6:  It's great. I'm gonna run some speed

487
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:37,765
Speaker 5:  Tests. I'm, I'm very curious to see. I will say the other thing that has

488
00:29:37,765 --> 00:29:41,325
Speaker 5:  come up a bunch in our comments is people who are now

489
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:45,085
Speaker 5:  wondering if Apple making these modems in-house is

490
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:48,925
Speaker 5:  going to make it easier slash more compelling for Apple to put

491
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:53,045
Speaker 5:  modems inside of MacBooks, which is a thing

492
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:56,605
Speaker 5:  that I have hoped for for many years and would very, very much love to see.

493
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:57,245
Speaker 5:  I

494
00:29:57,245 --> 00:30:01,045
Speaker 7:  Have no idea why any human would pay for that, but

495
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:05,045
Speaker 7:  I I underst like, I do not understand why Apple has not

496
00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:08,985
Speaker 7:  done it charge you an extra 200 bucks for that done. Sure.

497
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:10,065
Speaker 7:  I don't understand why they haven't

498
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:13,985
Speaker 5:  Done that. I I would have agreed with you until an experience I had last

499
00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:17,865
Speaker 5:  year with the M four iPad Pro, which was the first

500
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:21,665
Speaker 5:  time I had my whole life sort of eim and I literally

501
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:25,585
Speaker 5:  just turned on the iPad Pro. I never, I was like out at

502
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:28,425
Speaker 5:  a coffee shop, I didn't connect it to wifi, I didn't do anything and it was

503
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:31,745
Speaker 5:  just online. I logged into my account and was just online

504
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:36,105
Speaker 5:  and it was, it was one of the coolest technology experiences I've had in

505
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:39,625
Speaker 5:  years of just like, like it's the difference between

506
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:43,265
Speaker 5:  when you had to turn your computer on and off every time you used it and

507
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:46,465
Speaker 5:  just opening the lid and it started to be on again. That all of a sudden,

508
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:49,985
Speaker 5:  like the whole thing just feels better and more accessible. This idea that

509
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:52,985
Speaker 5:  everywhere I am I can just pop my laptop open and start working is like,

510
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,875
Speaker 5:  there's something real there.

511
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:58,955
Speaker 7:  I I would use a Starbucks hotspot from

512
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:02,555
Speaker 7:  my house if it saved me money on my my cell phone bill.

513
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:08,795
Speaker 7:  What, what like adding another device to, to your thing.

514
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:12,675
Speaker 7:  I understand. I I think it makes a ton of sense for business users. It,

515
00:31:12,675 --> 00:31:16,555
Speaker 7:  it does sound amazing and magical, but whoof it's a lot, lot

516
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:17,995
Speaker 7:  of gadgets, lot of gadgets.

517
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:21,235
Speaker 5:  I know I say all that but I've, I've always been too cheap to buy the cellular

518
00:31:21,325 --> 00:31:25,195
Speaker 5:  Apple watch for like, and it's, it's the same thing, right? It is like

519
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:29,115
Speaker 5:  magically connected everywhere is the whole pitch and I get it and I want

520
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:32,595
Speaker 5:  it and I wouldn't pay anymore for it. But I think I would on a laptop,

521
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:36,055
Speaker 5:  I would almost never use it because I just sit at home on my Mac mini every

522
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:39,815
Speaker 5:  day. But like it would make me feel good. Yeah, I would enjoy it. Alright,

523
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:43,015
Speaker 5:  we should talk about one more phone before we get off of phones.

524
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:47,335
Speaker 5:  And that phone is the Oppo Find N five

525
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:51,055
Speaker 5:  A phone that is not coming to the United States. Don Preston on our team

526
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:55,175
Speaker 5:  reviewed it. Alison, I just wanna know how jealous you are that you have

527
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:58,975
Speaker 5:  not gotten to my gosh, try and review this phone. This is the thinnest foldable

528
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:03,015
Speaker 5:  phone in The world according to Dom. It got a lot of the hardware things

529
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,975
Speaker 5:  right. It's basically as thick as A-U-S-B-C port

530
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,295
Speaker 5:  plus like the least metal you can possibly imagine.

531
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,575
Speaker 5:  I believe. Lemme see, I I'm just gonna read the sentence that he wrote

532
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:18,415
Speaker 5:  when closed. This is less than a millimeter, thicker than an iPhone 16 Pro

533
00:32:18,415 --> 00:32:22,095
Speaker 5:  Max or Samsung Galaxy S 25 Ultra and weighs only two grams more than the

534
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:25,375
Speaker 5:  Apple phone open. It boasts a bigger screen than an iPad mini, but is thinner

535
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,095
Speaker 5:  and weighs less. It's lighter than any of the foldables you can buy in the

536
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:31,655
Speaker 5:  US right now. And is a full three millimeters thinner than the Galaxy Z fold

537
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:35,495
Speaker 5:  six. Like this is, this looks like what a foldables supposed to look like.

538
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:37,055
Speaker 5:  They did it.

539
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:41,485
Speaker 6:  They did it. Yeah. And I kind of, I

540
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:45,365
Speaker 6:  love dom's kind of thesis on this review is like now

541
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:49,125
Speaker 6:  what, you know, it's still a, a pretty

542
00:32:49,195 --> 00:32:53,125
Speaker 6:  expensive phone. I think we just got rid of the

543
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,965
Speaker 6:  pricing is is like around, well it's not coming

544
00:32:56,965 --> 00:33:00,085
Speaker 6:  to us, which we've established, but it would cost around

545
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,285
Speaker 6:  $1,800 If you just did the calculation,

546
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:06,925
Speaker 5:  Which to be fair is like that's the going rate for foldables. Yeah. But that

547
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:10,535
Speaker 5:  is still literally a hundred percent too expensive.

548
00:33:10,775 --> 00:33:10,975
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

549
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:11,295
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

550
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:14,255
Speaker 5:  It is. It should be half of that price. And then I think these things would

551
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:15,015
Speaker 5:  have a ratio. It's

552
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:18,895
Speaker 7:  Only three I iPhone 16 es so I I can see There you go.

553
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:22,695
Speaker 7:  You get there like the onscreen amount alone If you kind of, that kind of

554
00:33:22,695 --> 00:33:23,295
Speaker 7:  adds up. It's

555
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:27,055
Speaker 6:  Interesting. Yeah. You could take three 16 Es and make a

556
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:27,535
Speaker 6:  trifold.

557
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:30,375
Speaker 5:  Yeah, like a accordion style. Your your three

558
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:34,015
Speaker 7:  16. That's the dumb ass. Is this the, the end and the answer is no

559
00:33:34,605 --> 00:33:35,335
Speaker 7:  more screens.

560
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:39,855
Speaker 5:  Yep. What if I took all these and just took them apart into many screens?

561
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:43,575
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it looks so beautiful. I am gonna

562
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:47,895
Speaker 6:  find one at Mobile World Congress and put it in my pocket and

563
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:52,055
Speaker 6:  run out of the the conventional. No, it, and it, it sounds

564
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:55,935
Speaker 6:  silly or like, well they were already pretty thin,

565
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:59,655
Speaker 6:  like comparably and, but like every

566
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:03,055
Speaker 6:  millimeter really does make a difference, especially when you're folding

567
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:06,415
Speaker 6:  in half and it, I just keep coming back to the pixel

568
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:10,935
Speaker 6:  fold too, whatever, nine pro fold where

569
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:15,735
Speaker 6:  you're like, could that really be as nice as it seemed like the, the

570
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:19,695
Speaker 6:  specs, the dimensions seem right and then you pick it up, you're like, this

571
00:34:19,795 --> 00:34:23,655
Speaker 6:  is right. Yep. It feels so nice to use this. That's the impression

572
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,415
Speaker 6:  I I got from Dominic on the, on the APO phone

573
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:30,335
Speaker 6:  and I wanna pick one up and not give it back.

574
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:34,695
Speaker 5:  I do think it's really exciting that it, it seems like we are getting

575
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:38,775
Speaker 5:  closer to the point where the hardware works,

576
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:42,855
Speaker 5:  right? Like I I I quibble with Dom a little bit on the idea

577
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:46,015
Speaker 5:  that like, you can't see the crease and it's like, no, it's right there in

578
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:49,895
Speaker 5:  the picture in every picture. Like I see it, there's still a crease

579
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:53,655
Speaker 5:  and these things all need to be sturdier. They need to be more durable, they

580
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:57,535
Speaker 5:  need better cameras. Like I actually think there's quite a bit of refining

581
00:34:57,535 --> 00:35:01,485
Speaker 5:  and improving left to do in a lot of these devices, but as a, as

582
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:04,645
Speaker 5:  a pure piece of hardware design. Like we're actually, we're getting close

583
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:08,165
Speaker 5:  and then it's like, okay, now we just have to take this thing and cut

584
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:12,045
Speaker 5:  $700 off it and and sincerely, I

585
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:15,125
Speaker 5:  have no idea if that's possible, but I think if it's not,

586
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:20,395
Speaker 5:  we're sort of done here. Right? Yeah. Like I think the, the market for an

587
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:24,435
Speaker 5:  $1,800 phone of any kind is just never gonna be very big. Yeah. I just

588
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:27,795
Speaker 5:  don't see it. And I think most people are like, if if I could have

589
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:32,275
Speaker 5:  this phone Exactly. Or this phone. Exactly. But it opened

590
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:35,715
Speaker 5:  up to be bigger. I would take the one that opened up to be bigger. But that's,

591
00:35:35,815 --> 00:35:39,125
Speaker 5:  I'm not willing to make any trades in service of that thing, I think is where

592
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:39,845
Speaker 5:  most people are.

593
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:43,805
Speaker 7:  That's a hundred percent where I like and I huge nerd would love a

594
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:47,285
Speaker 7:  folding phone. Really cool. The cameras are ever so slightly worse and it

595
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:49,765
Speaker 7:  costs $600 more. Yeah. Yeah. Like

596
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:50,325
Speaker 6:  I,

597
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,565
Speaker 7:  That, that's not worth it for me. Right.

598
00:35:53,395 --> 00:35:56,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And it's like, I think it's a phone that like

599
00:35:57,385 --> 00:36:01,165
Speaker 6:  my parents would really like, like they would love to

600
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:04,445
Speaker 6:  unfold their phones and read something and be able to make the text bigger

601
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:07,885
Speaker 6:  or whatever, see pictures of their grandkid and

602
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:12,565
Speaker 6:  big, bigger size. But I am never gonna recommend one to them.

603
00:36:13,075 --> 00:36:17,045
Speaker 6:  It's, you know, the, the durability is just too much of

604
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:20,485
Speaker 6:  a question mark. And Dom makes a good point in the review that If you can't

605
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:23,805
Speaker 6:  afford to replace this phone or

606
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,485
Speaker 6:  make a very expensive repair to it, then you should not buy a folding

607
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,325
Speaker 6:  phone. And I think that's exactly right.

608
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:33,605
Speaker 5:  That's a good rule of thumb. Yeah. Like If you, If you couldn't afford to

609
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:36,125
Speaker 5:  walk into the store and buy two of these, you probably shouldn't walk into

610
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,045
Speaker 5:  the store and buy one of these.

611
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:41,405
Speaker 7:  Have I fixed the like your, your fingernail will crease the

612
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:45,045
Speaker 7:  screen forever. Problem foldables yet. 'cause that's that's horrifying.

613
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:46,285
Speaker 6:  That's better. Yeah. Better.

614
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:47,165
Speaker 7:  Okay. Better. Is

615
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:51,405
Speaker 6:  It? Yeah. I still don't risk

616
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:55,285
Speaker 6:  it too much. And you definitely don't wanna like have a piece of

617
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:58,965
Speaker 6:  debris in your bag and like that, like the phone

618
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:03,005
Speaker 6:  folds over on, I've carried a lot of folding phones

619
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:06,885
Speaker 6:  in the bottom of my tote bag, which is dusty and gross and they have all

620
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:10,405
Speaker 6:  been okay. But I haven't done that for like

621
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:13,725
Speaker 6:  two years or three years, you know, so

622
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:18,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The, the long-term durability of one

623
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:22,205
Speaker 5:  of these is still the biggest question to me. Like the, is it going to

624
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:25,445
Speaker 5:  break the first time you open it thing? Not completely solved

625
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:30,405
Speaker 5:  for any of these companies, but like mostly solved. It's, it's gotten a lot

626
00:37:30,405 --> 00:37:33,325
Speaker 5:  better than the like, oops, I accidentally peeled off the screen,

627
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:38,325
Speaker 5:  which was not that long ago, but we're still at a point now where like

628
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:42,125
Speaker 5:  that that thing you just said Alison about like debris in your pocket

629
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:45,765
Speaker 5:  is like you, you're gonna get a little nervous every time you just throw

630
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:49,605
Speaker 5:  this into your purse or your backpack. And until you solve that,

631
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:53,565
Speaker 5:  we're just not quite there. But we're getting there. And I think the

632
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:57,485
Speaker 5:  idea that there are a bunch of companies pushing really hard at this design

633
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,205
Speaker 5:  stuff is cool and I wish they'd stop worrying about thinness and

634
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:05,005
Speaker 5:  start fixing the durability stuff. But that's how I feel about

635
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:08,485
Speaker 5:  all phones right now. The iPhone air, I'm gonna say this again in September

636
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:12,765
Speaker 5:  and whenever we get the Galaxy S 25, was that the air

637
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:13,085
Speaker 5:  too?

638
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:14,045
Speaker 6:  Edge.

639
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:18,125
Speaker 5:  Edge, that's right. I feel the same. Like we're we're doing a thin phone

640
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:21,325
Speaker 5:  year and I'm like, what if our phones didn't break? That'd be cool

641
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,365
Speaker 5:  into

642
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:23,005
Speaker 6:  That. You would like that?

643
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:27,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But yeah, this thing is not coming to the us which is

644
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:28,965
Speaker 5:  sad. It's

645
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:29,405
Speaker 7:  Devastating,

646
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:33,085
Speaker 5:  But we're we're, we're gonna, we're gonna find one. There was a world in

647
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,765
Speaker 5:  which we thought one plus might take this and launch it

648
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:39,365
Speaker 7:  Itself. Yeah. I don't understand why one plus just came out and we're just

649
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:42,885
Speaker 7:  like, we're not gonna do it. I know they just came out and broke our har

650
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,285
Speaker 7:  broke our hearts. Yeah. They have to, I don't understand what was in this

651
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:48,045
Speaker 7:  for them. They could have kept us going at least for

652
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:51,525
Speaker 5:  I think it was about what, nine months ago? Oh

653
00:41:51,525 --> 00:41:55,405
Speaker 5:  God. That the AI pin had launched. It

654
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:59,245
Speaker 5:  went poorly. I would, I would say I was mean to it and not

655
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:02,605
Speaker 5:  as mean to it as I should have been. In retrospect we, we'll get back to

656
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:06,565
Speaker 5:  that, but there was this rumor going around that Humane was

657
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:09,205
Speaker 5:  actually looking to sell itself, right? This company had raised a ton of

658
00:42:09,205 --> 00:42:12,245
Speaker 5:  money, it had brought on a ton of hype. It kind of bombed with this first

659
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:15,885
Speaker 5:  product. We didn't think it was gonna work and then we,

660
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:19,765
Speaker 5:  it was trying to sell itself to HP for somewhere

661
00:42:19,765 --> 00:42:23,725
Speaker 5:  between 750 million and a billion dollars. And we were all like,

662
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:28,035
Speaker 5:  that seems high. Also, LOL at HP

663
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:31,835
Speaker 5:  paying a billion dollars for Humane's weird

664
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:35,995
Speaker 5:  AI operating system. And this thing, the AI pin

665
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:39,795
Speaker 5:  that basically didn't work at all, that never came to anything

666
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:44,585
Speaker 5:  Humane kind of went quiet. They got, they were like slightly apologetic and

667
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:46,785
Speaker 5:  then were like, well, we're also making an operating system. That's gonna

668
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:50,705
Speaker 5:  be a whole thing. Batten down the hatches, do their thing. And then

669
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:54,505
Speaker 5:  this week it was announced that HP

670
00:42:55,085 --> 00:42:58,825
Speaker 5:  was buying technology from Humane. HP actually

671
00:42:59,735 --> 00:43:03,425
Speaker 5:  reached out to us to very carefully confirm that HP was not

672
00:43:03,425 --> 00:43:07,385
Speaker 5:  acquiring Humane. It was buying some technology and

673
00:43:07,405 --> 00:43:10,945
Speaker 5:  assets and, and hiring some people from Humane.

674
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:15,585
Speaker 5:  But that humane as we know it, including the AI pin is shutting down.

675
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:19,945
Speaker 5:  And as of February 28th, so a week from Friday, today

676
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:23,745
Speaker 5:  as you're hearing this, the AI pin will essentially be

677
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:27,065
Speaker 5:  dead. They're turning off the service. It won't do any cloud stuff. There's

678
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:31,025
Speaker 5:  a thing in Humane's, FA Q1 of the questions is

679
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,705
Speaker 5:  basically like, what will my device be able to do? And it's like, it'll be

680
00:43:33,705 --> 00:43:35,225
Speaker 5:  able to tell you its battery level.

681
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:39,145
Speaker 7:  Yeah. This thing is, this is really, really rough. Like, like it's immediate.

682
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:42,025
Speaker 7:  Like you, you, If you bought one, you knew you were an early adopter, but

683
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:45,865
Speaker 7:  like, like straight up you're $700, $800 pin, just, it's just

684
00:43:45,865 --> 00:43:49,825
Speaker 7:  dead. Like it's doing nothing. And basically nobody's getting a

685
00:43:49,825 --> 00:43:50,145
Speaker 7:  refund

686
00:43:50,685 --> 00:43:53,505
Speaker 5:  In less than a year. That hurts just gone. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's bad.

687
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:57,465
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Humane is doing refunds for people who are in the 90 day window

688
00:43:57,645 --> 00:44:00,425
Speaker 5:  in which people could normally get refunds. Would love,

689
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:03,705
Speaker 7:  Love to know how many people that is.

690
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:05,705
Speaker 5:  Oh my God, I had the same thought. Like,

691
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:06,265
Speaker 7:  Like

692
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:07,625
Speaker 5:  If, If you bought,

693
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:09,025
Speaker 7:  You think they set aside any money for that.

694
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:12,745
Speaker 5:  Like, let's see, three months ago would've been like Thanksgiving.

695
00:44:13,405 --> 00:44:17,225
Speaker 5:  So If you, If you bought a humane AI pin, let's say between

696
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:21,465
Speaker 5:  November 1st and today, please email

697
00:44:21,465 --> 00:44:24,945
Speaker 5:  us Vergecast at The Verge dot com and tell us everything

698
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:29,065
Speaker 5:  about why and who and under the influence of

699
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:32,805
Speaker 5:  what and what has happened since I want to, I want to know

700
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:36,045
Speaker 5:  everything. Who got one for Christmas? Oh no.

701
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:40,845
Speaker 5:  Oh my God, I bet that happened. There are people who were like, oh, I have

702
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:44,685
Speaker 5:  a, I have a nerdy nephew. Like what can I buy? Oh no.

703
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:49,325
Speaker 5:  A 700 pin Oh man. Which

704
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:50,805
Speaker 7:  Required subscription as well.

705
00:44:51,475 --> 00:44:55,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Great. Love, love to spend all of the money in The world.

706
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:59,285
Speaker 5:  You could buy an iPhone 16 E for less Okay. Than a human

707
00:44:59,355 --> 00:44:59,885
Speaker 5:  have. So

708
00:44:59,885 --> 00:45:03,565
Speaker 7:  David, you you reviewed this thing I did, right? They had these, these big

709
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:07,205
Speaker 7:  promises about the future of ai, the future of wearables. They were trying

710
00:45:07,485 --> 00:45:11,445
Speaker 7:  to redefine gadgets, right? Mo move into a a

711
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:14,045
Speaker 7:  postmortem era. Were they onto anything?

712
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:18,285
Speaker 5:  Well, this is where Alison and I have been fighting for a year and will continue

713
00:45:18,285 --> 00:45:21,885
Speaker 5:  to fight because I, I still think the answer is

714
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,405
Speaker 5:  yes. I think, I think the answer to

715
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:30,005
Speaker 5:  how much are they onto and how meaningful is the thing that they were

716
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:30,205
Speaker 5:  onto

717
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:35,895
Speaker 5:  TBD. Right? But I think the idea that you should have a way to interact with

718
00:45:35,955 --> 00:45:39,735
Speaker 5:  AI that doesn't involve taking your phone out of your pocket. Yes. I

719
00:45:39,855 --> 00:45:43,535
Speaker 5:  I am convinced there is something there. And I think after this happened,

720
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:47,455
Speaker 5:  Wes Davis on our team dmd me and like, this thing would've been better if

721
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:51,175
Speaker 5:  it was just a, a Siri microphone that you could wear, wouldn't it? And I

722
00:45:51,175 --> 00:45:53,895
Speaker 5:  was like, yep, it would have. And I think that's really true. But

723
00:45:54,975 --> 00:45:58,795
Speaker 5:  Humane's thing was they just went too

724
00:45:58,945 --> 00:46:02,595
Speaker 5:  hard at it and they did a bunch of stuff that was technically

725
00:46:02,705 --> 00:46:06,595
Speaker 5:  sort of impossible that they, they like, they made a laser projector

726
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:10,355
Speaker 5:  as one of the key user interfaces. Like all this stuff sounds absurd in

727
00:46:10,515 --> 00:46:14,275
Speaker 5:  retrospect. And it seemed absurd then frankly it seemed absurd the whole

728
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:17,355
Speaker 5:  time. But they, they had a laser projector instead of a touchscreen. And

729
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:21,075
Speaker 5:  it's like we're all pretty good at messing around on screens now. It was

730
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:24,955
Speaker 5:  designed to do everything by voice. It was designed to have

731
00:46:24,955 --> 00:46:28,435
Speaker 5:  everything be totally abstracted away from you. And

732
00:46:29,295 --> 00:46:33,195
Speaker 5:  the vision of that is actually what a lot of people have. Like people

733
00:46:33,195 --> 00:46:36,595
Speaker 5:  talk about age agentic ai and the idea that all of these systems should be

734
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:39,715
Speaker 5:  able to go work for you. OpenAI is working on that. Google is working on

735
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:42,915
Speaker 5:  that. We've seen some of the stuff that they're working on, they're all working

736
00:46:42,915 --> 00:46:46,555
Speaker 5:  on it as like chatbots in web browsers and apps on your phone.

737
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:51,155
Speaker 5:  Humane was like, okay, well what if this is actually a dedicated device and

738
00:46:51,595 --> 00:46:55,115
Speaker 5:  requires a complete rethinking of how everything happens. And I think that

739
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:58,955
Speaker 5:  was where it got the thing wrong. So it's like If you, If you boil it all

740
00:46:58,955 --> 00:47:02,915
Speaker 5:  the way down, I think Humane's like the, the

741
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:06,835
Speaker 5:  very first like meeting at a bar where they were like, here is the

742
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:10,075
Speaker 5:  thing we should do, I think was not that far off. And then every decision

743
00:47:10,075 --> 00:47:12,235
Speaker 5:  they made After that was the wrong one. I

744
00:47:12,275 --> 00:47:15,515
Speaker 7:  I think, I think what's so hard there is like what they wanted to do

745
00:47:15,975 --> 00:47:19,955
Speaker 7:  within the current, you know, world of phones is just

746
00:47:19,955 --> 00:47:23,915
Speaker 7:  impossible for a third party app, right? Yes. And what they were

747
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:27,555
Speaker 7:  trying to do even a year ago when they launched

748
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:31,175
Speaker 7:  was not something you could do on your Android phone was not something you

749
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:34,855
Speaker 7:  could do on your iPhone. I fast forward a year and you have

750
00:47:35,595 --> 00:47:39,455
Speaker 7:  AI built in natively that is starting to be able to do these

751
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:43,095
Speaker 7:  things. And so it it's almost like they were, you know, they're

752
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:46,895
Speaker 7:  pirates trying to board the ship and it, it just

753
00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:50,855
Speaker 7:  wasn't gonna happen. Allison, where where was it that you were

754
00:47:50,855 --> 00:47:53,375
Speaker 7:  clashing with David on this? You were, you were in the just do it in the

755
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,095
Speaker 7:  smartphone camp.

756
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,895
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It, the, the future of the AI gadget is,

757
00:47:58,165 --> 00:48:01,935
Speaker 6:  it's a phone is is my stance and I love a gadget and I

758
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:06,175
Speaker 6:  saw the humane pin a year ago at Mobile World Congress and it was like,

759
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:10,575
Speaker 6:  this is a gadget. Like it's kind of fun. Is it a good idea?

760
00:48:10,795 --> 00:48:11,015
Speaker 6:  No,

761
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:16,615
Speaker 6:  we clearly that's how it panned out. But yeah, it's like why

762
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:20,575
Speaker 6:  take all of these things and try to like reinvent

763
00:48:20,575 --> 00:48:23,855
Speaker 6:  the wheel and like put a worst processor and

764
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:28,215
Speaker 6:  you, you know, make a whole new interface system that people

765
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:31,895
Speaker 6:  have to learn and figure out heat

766
00:48:31,895 --> 00:48:35,735
Speaker 6:  dissipation, which they did not because the thing

767
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:39,535
Speaker 6:  would shut itself down all the time and Yeah. Clearly

768
00:48:39,645 --> 00:48:42,495
Speaker 6:  like that didn't, didn't work out for them.

769
00:48:43,495 --> 00:48:47,455
Speaker 5:  So Alison, I think the, the, it's a real bummer that the AI pin didn't

770
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:50,695
Speaker 5:  work out because it makes your argument look even stronger than it did already.

771
00:48:50,755 --> 00:48:51,095
Speaker 5:  It did.

772
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:51,615
Speaker 6:  I noticed that.

773
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:55,535
Speaker 5:  But I do think the, the thing to me that gives

774
00:48:55,555 --> 00:48:59,135
Speaker 5:  me the strongest evidence against everything should just be a phone is the

775
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,855
Speaker 5:  camera on the meta ray RayBan smart glasses because that,

776
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:06,255
Speaker 5:  that is a thing in which my experience of taking photos is

777
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:10,655
Speaker 5:  meaningfully different and in many ways better because I'm not holding

778
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,735
Speaker 5:  my phone in front of my face. And so it's like that's the thing that I look

779
00:49:13,735 --> 00:49:17,135
Speaker 5:  at as like, okay, there are things we can do if we're going to sort of

780
00:49:17,135 --> 00:49:20,615
Speaker 5:  disintermediate the phone and put those components in different places

781
00:49:21,085 --> 00:49:25,055
Speaker 5:  that can be better for it. Yeah. And that's unfortunately

782
00:49:25,115 --> 00:49:28,695
Speaker 5:  the only one that I have found so far. But it is like, that's the one I hold

783
00:49:28,695 --> 00:49:31,895
Speaker 5:  onto that I'm like, maybe there is something to this. And I think the idea

784
00:49:31,895 --> 00:49:35,855
Speaker 5:  of a microphone that is also more accessible than the one in my pocket feels

785
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:37,815
Speaker 5:  meaningful to me in that same way.

786
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:42,295
Speaker 6:  And I think it like, like building on what the phone

787
00:49:42,295 --> 00:49:46,055
Speaker 6:  already has, like it already has a processing power, it can al it already

788
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:49,815
Speaker 6:  connect. Most phones can already connect reliably

789
00:49:49,955 --> 00:49:53,255
Speaker 6:  to cloud services with their Qualcomm modems or whatever.

790
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:58,415
Speaker 6:  Like instead of throwing all that away and starting

791
00:49:58,725 --> 00:50:02,495
Speaker 6:  like way out here with something else, like the meta ray bands makes

792
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:06,535
Speaker 6:  so much sense 'cause it just sort of starts with like, okay, here's one

793
00:50:06,535 --> 00:50:09,855
Speaker 6:  capability and it works with your phone

794
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:13,975
Speaker 6:  and you don't need it If you don't wanna carry it at that particular moment.

795
00:50:14,075 --> 00:50:17,855
Speaker 6:  And then kind of building on that, the way they've been adding the

796
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:21,855
Speaker 6:  AI features I think is way more compelling

797
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:25,695
Speaker 6:  than just throwing it all out and being like, what if

798
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:26,735
Speaker 6:  no phone?

799
00:50:27,555 --> 00:50:31,435
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about last, let's see, it

800
00:50:31,435 --> 00:50:35,115
Speaker 5:  would've been right about now, last year I went to

801
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,995
Speaker 5:  New York two Humane's offices and actually like spent some time

802
00:50:39,025 --> 00:50:42,715
Speaker 5:  with Imran Choudry and Bethany Bonno who are the co-founders. And

803
00:50:43,265 --> 00:50:46,155
Speaker 5:  they were like, it was right before the product was launching. So they had

804
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:49,835
Speaker 5:  one of those like room set up where they had the exploded parts and walked

805
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:52,275
Speaker 5:  me through how it all works and all the stuff they had developed and they

806
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:55,275
Speaker 5:  had early prototypes and we were just talking through basically like how

807
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:57,595
Speaker 5:  they had built this thing and where it came from. And one of the questions

808
00:50:57,595 --> 00:51:01,515
Speaker 5:  I asked them was, why do this much the

809
00:51:01,515 --> 00:51:05,475
Speaker 5:  first time? Like you're, you're a first gen hardware startup, you've never

810
00:51:05,475 --> 00:51:09,195
Speaker 5:  done any of this before. Nobody has seen any of this stuff before. Why

811
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:13,315
Speaker 5:  push this hard on something this expensive and this

812
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:17,235
Speaker 5:  complicated and this new on your first try? And I believe it was Imran

813
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:20,875
Speaker 5:  said, because if now that we've done all of this work,

814
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:25,315
Speaker 5:  it will make doing the lesser things much easier.

815
00:51:27,415 --> 00:51:31,075
Speaker 5:  And I actually, like there is something sort of compelling in that argument,

816
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:33,915
Speaker 5:  right? It's like we've done the incredibly complicated things, so now we're

817
00:51:33,915 --> 00:51:36,475
Speaker 5:  gonna strip out the cellular modem, we're gonna basically make this thing

818
00:51:36,475 --> 00:51:40,275
Speaker 5:  an accessory to your phone and it'll, it'll be easier and cheaper

819
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:42,755
Speaker 5:  and better. And now we can do that because we've done the hard work already.

820
00:51:43,655 --> 00:51:47,315
Speaker 5:  The thing that they didn't reckon with is that they were never gonna get

821
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:50,235
Speaker 5:  the chance because this thing went so badly. Right. And I think

822
00:51:51,105 --> 00:51:54,395
Speaker 5:  what I look at the opposite is like the, the rabbit where like this thing

823
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:58,075
Speaker 5:  couldn't do anything but it was $200 and it was like cute and fun.

824
00:51:58,175 --> 00:52:01,635
Speaker 5:  And I think it bought that company some time

825
00:52:02,345 --> 00:52:06,195
Speaker 5:  because people didn't have the same sort of like visceral

826
00:52:07,035 --> 00:52:10,995
Speaker 5:  negative reaction to how bad it was because it wasn't trying nearly as

827
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:14,875
Speaker 5:  hard. And I think the lesson there was like, and, and frankly

828
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:18,795
Speaker 5:  like Apple where Iran and Bethany worked before, learned the same

829
00:52:18,795 --> 00:52:21,835
Speaker 5:  thing with Vision Pro. Like what, what Meta did with the Ray bands is like,

830
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:25,355
Speaker 5:  do the least and then try to build from there. And Apple was like, what if

831
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:28,995
Speaker 5:  we did the most? And it turns out that's actually in a lot of ways, the wrong

832
00:52:29,275 --> 00:52:32,995
Speaker 5:  approach. And I've just been thinking like the, the prototype for these simpler,

833
00:52:33,345 --> 00:52:37,195
Speaker 5:  cheaper phone attached thing that I think would've made

834
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:40,515
Speaker 5:  more sense for Humane, I am very sure exists

835
00:52:41,015 --> 00:52:42,435
Speaker 5:  and they should have shipped that instead.

836
00:52:42,615 --> 00:52:46,555
Speaker 7:  Humane went way too far in the hardware, which is, I think part

837
00:52:46,555 --> 00:52:50,355
Speaker 7:  of the thing that was attention grabbing about Humane was right. It's this

838
00:52:50,355 --> 00:52:53,715
Speaker 7:  mysterious gadget as a projector. It's tiny, doesn't have a screen.

839
00:52:54,425 --> 00:52:58,315
Speaker 7:  Obviously it was a disaster, but I am curious. You got to use it. You tested

840
00:52:58,315 --> 00:52:59,035
Speaker 7:  it, you reviewed it,

841
00:53:00,755 --> 00:53:03,935
Speaker 7:  we know what was bad about it. Was there anything about the hardware that,

842
00:53:03,935 --> 00:53:05,815
Speaker 7:  that you're like, you know what, there's something there.

843
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:06,935
Speaker 5:  It's

844
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:09,595
Speaker 5:  no,

845
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:13,075
Speaker 7:  I tried, I tried to find

846
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:16,675
Speaker 5:  Something. I'm torn on this in the, in a certain way

847
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:21,735
Speaker 5:  it speaks very highly of the team that made it, that it exists at

848
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:24,895
Speaker 5:  all. Like it's a beautifully made little thing. Like it's,

849
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:29,405
Speaker 5:  it's small. It's, it's really nice to like fiddle and worry with it, have

850
00:53:29,445 --> 00:53:33,325
Speaker 5:  a really clever set of accessories. The magnet works really well. It has

851
00:53:33,325 --> 00:53:37,285
Speaker 5:  really pleasant noises. Like the, the touch reaction is good. There's

852
00:53:37,285 --> 00:53:40,885
Speaker 5:  like all the little tiny details that most companies don't get right on the

853
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:44,205
Speaker 5:  first try. They got right on the first try, right? Like there are, there

854
00:53:44,205 --> 00:53:48,125
Speaker 5:  are surprisingly few of those sort of rough edges we're used

855
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:52,005
Speaker 5:  to from startup products, but then they had the opposite problem,

856
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:54,405
Speaker 5:  which is that all the big things they were trying to do didn't work at all.

857
00:53:54,905 --> 00:53:58,645
Speaker 5:  And, and the big swings that they made were things like the laser projector,

858
00:53:58,645 --> 00:54:02,485
Speaker 5:  which just essentially was useless. Like the interface didn't make any

859
00:54:02,485 --> 00:54:05,965
Speaker 5:  sense. You functionally couldn't use it at all in any kind of light,

860
00:54:06,385 --> 00:54:09,645
Speaker 5:  and it just didn't, they just didn't need to exist, right? And so

861
00:54:10,265 --> 00:54:13,565
Speaker 5:  you could tell that all of the stuff they spent like real huge

862
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,685
Speaker 5:  money and resources on were just pointed in the wrong direction.

863
00:54:18,105 --> 00:54:21,405
Speaker 5:  But then there's a team who was tasked with like, making the thing nice and

864
00:54:21,405 --> 00:54:25,285
Speaker 5:  they did a really good job. Like the, we talk about like polished turds a

865
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:29,245
Speaker 5:  lot and it's, it's a real, like we, we kind of mean as an insult,

866
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:32,605
Speaker 5:  but it, this is like a really nicely polished turd. It really is.

867
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:36,525
Speaker 7:  I mean it's, it's like right you, like you said it like the rabbit sold because

868
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:39,645
Speaker 7:  it's $200 and it's bright and it's colorful and it's nice and this thing

869
00:54:41,035 --> 00:54:44,405
Speaker 7:  also very pretty just just

870
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:46,445
Speaker 7:  way in a different world.

871
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:50,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, and I think the other mystique that humane made was the way

872
00:54:50,205 --> 00:54:53,815
Speaker 5:  that they went about talking about this thing. Like

873
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:57,375
Speaker 5:  in, in writing about it this week, I went back and watched the first Ted

874
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,295
Speaker 5:  Talk that Imran Chari gave

875
00:55:00,945 --> 00:55:04,095
Speaker 5:  where he like described the thing and a,

876
00:55:05,645 --> 00:55:08,895
Speaker 5:  that demo is fake. Like it, I just, I please

877
00:55:09,325 --> 00:55:12,695
Speaker 5:  lawyers come at me with evidence that that is not true. And I will happily

878
00:55:12,715 --> 00:55:15,895
Speaker 5:  recant it. I have now watched that demo a hundred times, I've been using

879
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:19,735
Speaker 5:  this product for a year. And it is, it is impossible that he was able to

880
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:23,615
Speaker 5:  do those things on stage to get it to translate between

881
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:27,095
Speaker 5:  languages without any prompting to get it to answer a phone call. I know

882
00:55:27,155 --> 00:55:30,135
Speaker 5:  how you answer a phone call on this thing, and it is by doing a gesture with

883
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:32,735
Speaker 5:  your hands that he doesn't do standing on stage and it answers the phone

884
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:36,495
Speaker 5:  call. It's just impossible. But anyway, so they,

885
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:40,455
Speaker 5:  they made it out to be this very like, you know, hugely important.

886
00:55:40,565 --> 00:55:43,895
Speaker 5:  Like they were very quiet about it and they made this like very dour,

887
00:55:44,525 --> 00:55:48,415
Speaker 5:  serious video about how important this gadget was gonna be.

888
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:52,215
Speaker 5:  And they got it named to Times Inventions of the year. And it was like

889
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:56,495
Speaker 5:  they, they set this up to be some huge

890
00:55:56,925 --> 00:55:59,775
Speaker 5:  consequential moment in the history of technology

891
00:56:01,265 --> 00:56:01,925
Speaker 5:  and it sucked.

892
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:06,245
Speaker 7:  I mean, it's very funny. Like it, it couldn't do what they promised it would

893
00:56:06,245 --> 00:56:09,285
Speaker 7:  do, which, you know, it's kind of a, a big strike to start out with. But

894
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:11,925
Speaker 7:  I think there's also this element of like, they promised it would, you know,

895
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:16,125
Speaker 7:  bringing this sort of new world of ambient computing where you're not

896
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:20,085
Speaker 7:  staring at your phone so much, things just sort of happen in front of you

897
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,485
Speaker 7:  and you don't have to worry about it. And I think what we see with the meta

898
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:27,215
Speaker 7:  ray bands is people already wear glasses

899
00:56:27,355 --> 00:56:31,255
Speaker 7:  and sunglasses that's really natural. And putting a

900
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:35,215
Speaker 7:  chunky pin on your shirt that is kind of

901
00:56:35,215 --> 00:56:38,815
Speaker 7:  uncomfortable and may not stick on and then having to like hold your hand

902
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:42,655
Speaker 7:  up and look at a projector that's actually like more obtrusive than just

903
00:56:42,655 --> 00:56:46,495
Speaker 7:  quickly pulling out your phone and doing something. Yeah. And so like

904
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:50,215
Speaker 7:  there, there was clearly this kernel of an idea that, that I,

905
00:56:50,415 --> 00:56:54,335
Speaker 7:  I think really resonates with like everyone like it, it would be great to

906
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:57,095
Speaker 7:  use our phones less, it would be great if things just sort of happened a

907
00:56:57,095 --> 00:56:58,015
Speaker 7:  little bit more ambiently

908
00:56:59,555 --> 00:57:03,375
Speaker 7:  and executed on it in I think one of the most perplexing

909
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,575
Speaker 7:  ways imaginable. Yeah.

910
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:09,895
Speaker 5:  So Josh Miller, the, the CEO of the browser company, I don't think

911
00:57:09,895 --> 00:57:13,095
Speaker 5:  he'll mind me telling this story on The Vergecast. We'll see Josh, sorry,

912
00:57:14,185 --> 00:57:17,735
Speaker 5:  introduced me not that long ago to this concept of novelty fatigue, which

913
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:21,215
Speaker 5:  is basically that If you try to do

914
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:25,855
Speaker 5:  too many new things, even if they're the right things, at the same

915
00:57:25,855 --> 00:57:29,655
Speaker 5:  time it will feel wrong to people. And that, and that actually what

916
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:32,495
Speaker 5:  you have to do in product design is

917
00:57:33,585 --> 00:57:36,815
Speaker 5:  build slowly. Like you, you can have improved

918
00:57:37,055 --> 00:57:40,935
Speaker 5:  everything imaginable all at the same time and you'll

919
00:57:40,935 --> 00:57:44,015
Speaker 5:  still leave people behind because it won't, it won't feel right. It won't

920
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:47,575
Speaker 5:  feel familiar. And so that that cadence of introducing novelty to people

921
00:57:47,995 --> 00:57:51,655
Speaker 5:  is actually a huge part of the process of product design. And I think

922
00:57:51,925 --> 00:57:55,695
Speaker 5:  like the most generous possible interpretation of

923
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:59,015
Speaker 5:  what happened to Humane, and I, I don't believe this at all, but I think

924
00:57:59,015 --> 00:58:02,775
Speaker 5:  one of the mistakes that they made, and one way to look at all of this is

925
00:58:02,775 --> 00:58:06,655
Speaker 5:  they just went way beyond novelty fatigue with everybody. They

926
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:09,495
Speaker 5:  were like, we are going to reinvent everything about how you do everything

927
00:58:09,995 --> 00:58:13,975
Speaker 5:  all at once. And I think even if it had all worked, it wouldn't have worked

928
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:17,455
Speaker 5:  because it just, it felt wrong and it wouldn't have made sense.

929
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:21,215
Speaker 7:  It, it's funny, like I I understand exactly why he is saying that and it's

930
00:58:21,215 --> 00:58:25,135
Speaker 7:  because his browser arc is really perplexing when you first use it.

931
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:28,535
Speaker 7:  I bounced off that thing like five different times and now I use it every

932
00:58:28,535 --> 00:58:32,415
Speaker 7:  day and I'm furious that they're like low key maybe not working on

933
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:32,855
Speaker 7:  it anymore.

934
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:38,695
Speaker 7:  I do, I I think you're probably

935
00:58:38,795 --> 00:58:41,655
Speaker 7:  mostly right there, but there I do think there's also this thing of like,

936
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:46,295
Speaker 7:  you know, the two of you have tested every phone

937
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:49,395
Speaker 7:  under the sun. I feel like

938
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:53,115
Speaker 7:  usually you can tell if if there's, if there's a little kernel of something

939
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:55,875
Speaker 7:  in there that is working, you can see it and

940
00:58:57,135 --> 00:59:00,235
Speaker 7:  it, it, I think you were right that they, they tried way too many things,

941
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:04,235
Speaker 7:  but I I'm not even sure if there was one thing that was clicking there for

942
00:59:04,235 --> 00:59:04,435
Speaker 7:  people.

943
00:59:05,505 --> 00:59:08,995
Speaker 6:  Yeah, just seems like the concept really. And

944
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:13,795
Speaker 6:  the, the way they sold it was like, yeah, don't

945
00:59:13,795 --> 00:59:17,315
Speaker 6:  look at your phone, just talk to this thing. Just be free in The world. And

946
00:59:17,315 --> 00:59:20,915
Speaker 6:  like, who doesn't want that? But yeah, it, it has to work.

947
00:59:21,505 --> 00:59:24,045
Speaker 7:  But like how, how are you free in The world when there's this like heavy

948
00:59:24,385 --> 00:59:27,245
Speaker 7:  chunky thing, like literally pulling your shirt down? Yeah.

949
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:31,285
Speaker 5:  I think ultimately one of the most convincing arguments against the

950
00:59:31,285 --> 00:59:34,965
Speaker 5:  humane pin from the beginning was everything about this

951
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:39,165
Speaker 5:  makes more sense in an Apple watch. Mm. Yeah. And I, I think that

952
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,925
Speaker 5:  is true. Even the things about it that I like, which are like, it's not in

953
00:59:42,925 --> 00:59:46,645
Speaker 5:  my pocket. It's easier to access. It's something I can sort of discreetly

954
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:50,525
Speaker 5:  talk to without having to stare at a screen. Like we've

955
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:53,405
Speaker 5:  found the wearable spot for that and I think it's probably on your wrist

956
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:53,725
Speaker 5:  and I

957
00:59:53,725 --> 00:59:57,245
Speaker 7:  Would feel like straight up, I I think it is like troubling and

958
00:59:57,245 --> 01:00:01,165
Speaker 7:  unfortunate and bad for technology as a whole that basically

959
01:00:02,055 --> 01:00:05,995
Speaker 7:  we have to wait for Apple or Google to do this, right? Yep. It would

960
01:00:05,995 --> 01:00:09,915
Speaker 7:  be great if, if Humane could come along and say, Hey,

961
01:00:10,295 --> 01:00:13,075
Speaker 7:  we made a watch. It's gonna hook into your iPhone, it's gonna do it all the

962
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:16,795
Speaker 7:  iPhone things and we've added all this stuff that Right. In a world

963
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:19,755
Speaker 7:  where they could do that, I I would not be surprised if they had just

964
01:00:19,755 --> 01:00:23,275
Speaker 5:  Done that. Yeah. This is why I'm so curious to see what Sam Altman and Johnny

965
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:26,955
Speaker 5:  Ive are working on Because there, there is a, there is a version of

966
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:30,635
Speaker 5:  some AI gadget that is essentially

967
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:34,875
Speaker 5:  headphones or mostly just a microphone or something that

968
01:00:35,075 --> 01:00:38,995
Speaker 5:  is like, like give me a, a tool that just lets me

969
01:00:39,055 --> 01:00:42,875
Speaker 5:  do the sort of advanced voice mode stuff with my

970
01:00:43,215 --> 01:00:47,115
Speaker 5:  AI bot. And there's something pretty interesting inside of that, especially

971
01:00:47,115 --> 01:00:50,235
Speaker 5:  as these models start to get better and more capable. But again, you, you

972
01:00:50,235 --> 01:00:53,875
Speaker 5:  can't, it is, it is not allowed. Yeah. Because Google and

973
01:00:54,205 --> 01:00:55,355
Speaker 5:  Apple will not let you,

974
01:00:55,605 --> 01:00:59,275
Speaker 7:  Which also like Meta is freaking out about this. Like, thi this is

975
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:03,275
Speaker 7:  going to be the big limitation on future versions of the raybans.

976
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:06,035
Speaker 7:  Yep. Which is is I think like a little frightening If you look at it because

977
01:01:06,035 --> 01:01:09,835
Speaker 7:  the raybans are, are one of the most interesting and sort of exciting

978
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:13,515
Speaker 7:  products because they're doing so much with so little and

979
01:01:13,515 --> 01:01:17,435
Speaker 7:  clearly they have big dreams there and is not quite clear. Even if

980
01:01:17,435 --> 01:01:20,075
Speaker 7:  they could pull 'em off, it's not clear how much they can pull off

981
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:22,555
Speaker 5:  Meta phone. We need the meta phone.

982
01:01:24,385 --> 01:01:27,355
Speaker 5:  What was that called? Was that the Chacho? Was that the Facebook phone? Was

983
01:01:27,355 --> 01:01:28,595
Speaker 5:  it the HTC Chacha?

984
01:01:30,115 --> 01:01:30,595
Speaker 7:  I think there's name

985
01:01:30,595 --> 01:01:34,515
Speaker 5:  Before my time that no one has said out loud in a really long time. Wait,

986
01:01:34,515 --> 01:01:34,875
Speaker 5:  hold on.

987
01:01:34,915 --> 01:01:38,355
Speaker 7:  I just, I literally just, I think that is still in the reviews closet. We

988
01:01:38,355 --> 01:01:38,835
Speaker 7:  have, Joshua

989
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:42,835
Speaker 5:  Was primarily messaging and also features tight integration with the

990
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:45,955
Speaker 5:  social network Facebook, which includes a dedicated Facebook button below

991
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:48,435
Speaker 5:  its keyboard, which allows users to quickly share content on the service.

992
01:01:48,915 --> 01:01:52,235
Speaker 5:  I just like imagine Wow. Like a

993
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:56,635
Speaker 5:  poorly designed blackberry that they finished making and

994
01:01:56,635 --> 01:02:00,435
Speaker 5:  at the very, like the, like the last second five minutes

995
01:02:00,435 --> 01:02:03,195
Speaker 5:  before they shipped it, somebody went, oh God, we were supposed to have a

996
01:02:03,275 --> 01:02:06,675
Speaker 5:  Facebook button and just slapped it on the bottom. That's the a CCC chacha.

997
01:02:07,075 --> 01:02:11,035
Speaker 5:  I never saw one in the wild. I'm gonna go looking for that. And if, If

998
01:02:11,035 --> 01:02:14,935
Speaker 5:  you owned one, get at me. I have a lot of questions

999
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:18,885
Speaker 5:  for you. Alright, so this HP thing

1000
01:02:18,885 --> 01:02:22,325
Speaker 5:  we we're just writing off, right? Like there's no reason to continue to believe

1001
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:26,205
Speaker 5:  anything is gonna happen here. The the press release for this

1002
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:30,325
Speaker 5:  was so like damning in the way that it

1003
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:34,125
Speaker 5:  came out from HP. Like can I just read you a a sentence from

1004
01:02:34,725 --> 01:02:38,685
Speaker 5:  please HP's executive? This is from Wan Tran who

1005
01:02:38,685 --> 01:02:42,485
Speaker 5:  is the president of technology and innovation at HP Humane's

1006
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:46,005
Speaker 5:  AI platform. Cosmos backed by an incredible group of engineers, will help

1007
01:02:46,005 --> 01:02:49,605
Speaker 5:  us create an intelligent ecosystem across all HP devices, from

1008
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:52,245
Speaker 5:  IPCs to smart printers and connected conference rooms

1009
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:57,465
Speaker 5:  like just the fall, the fall from Grace from

1010
01:02:57,725 --> 01:03:01,385
Speaker 5:  we have found the successor to the smartphone to connected

1011
01:03:01,385 --> 01:03:04,185
Speaker 5:  conference rooms and smart printers. I can't is just

1012
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:08,665
Speaker 6:  Tought, I can't think of a place I want AI less than a printer.

1013
01:03:09,615 --> 01:03:13,265
Speaker 6:  Like printers are annoying to start with,

1014
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:17,305
Speaker 6:  with no extra, with nothing. No chat bot

1015
01:03:17,305 --> 01:03:21,065
Speaker 6:  like making things up. Like can you imagine I it's a nightmare.

1016
01:03:21,505 --> 01:03:25,065
Speaker 7:  I listen if they put, they put one of those projectors in the printer,

1017
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:29,865
Speaker 7:  I I there's something there. It's like in instead of printing is I, I

1018
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:31,225
Speaker 7:  I guess projectors exist. I

1019
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:34,065
Speaker 5:  Don't know, I don't think it could get worse is my theory on the Smart Printer

1020
01:03:34,065 --> 01:03:37,975
Speaker 5:  thing is like sure. Chat GPT, like let me, let

1021
01:03:37,975 --> 01:03:41,095
Speaker 5:  me just tell you the website I'm trying to print and you figure it out. I

1022
01:03:41,095 --> 01:03:42,855
Speaker 5:  don't care what could possibly go wrong.

1023
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:47,055
Speaker 6:  I'll describe it to the printer and it can invent

1024
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:49,135
Speaker 6:  the thing I'm trying to print.

1025
01:03:50,695 --> 01:03:51,455
Speaker 6:  I love it that

1026
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:54,895
Speaker 5:  Before we switch gears, Heather, we should briefly talk about Rabbit, which

1027
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:57,375
Speaker 5:  I think is actually

1028
01:03:58,365 --> 01:04:01,555
Speaker 5:  continuing to like push it the thing it's trying to do, like

1029
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:03,755
Speaker 5:  the the R one sucked.

1030
01:04:04,155 --> 01:04:08,075
Speaker 7:  I like watching you very gently try not to over,

1031
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,275
Speaker 7:  over give him too much credit.

1032
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:16,235
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like I want to, I want to give Rabbit the least possible credit while

1033
01:04:16,235 --> 01:04:18,115
Speaker 5:  still giving them credit is where I'm at with Rabbit.

1034
01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:23,955
Speaker 5:  But they're, they're trying to do the thing they, the big promise of

1035
01:04:23,955 --> 01:04:26,875
Speaker 5:  Rabbit and the R one at the beginning was this thing called the the local

1036
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:30,395
Speaker 5:  action model that was going to actually go and do stuff for you. This is

1037
01:04:30,395 --> 01:04:34,235
Speaker 5:  what we now call agentic ai. Like again, these are the right

1038
01:04:34,235 --> 01:04:37,875
Speaker 5:  ideas, at least If you believe the rest of the tech industry, this is what

1039
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:41,835
Speaker 5:  everyone is working on right now. And Rabbit was actually relatively early

1040
01:04:41,855 --> 01:04:44,875
Speaker 5:  to be like, we're going to build a thing that lets you do stuff and we'll

1041
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,715
Speaker 5:  go do stuff on your behalf. That stuff didn't work

1042
01:04:48,705 --> 01:04:52,635
Speaker 5:  ever reliably in any way because all it's doing is

1043
01:04:52,795 --> 01:04:56,115
Speaker 5:  clicking around a virtual instance of a really insecure browser for you.

1044
01:04:56,775 --> 01:04:59,875
Speaker 5:  But Rabbit has continued to poke at this and I think

1045
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:04,715
Speaker 5:  smartly got pretty quiet for a while. Like the thing came out,

1046
01:05:04,945 --> 01:05:07,675
Speaker 5:  everybody's like, this is stupid. And then everybody's like, ah, whatever,

1047
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:11,435
Speaker 5:  it's $200, I won't worry about it. And I think that like bought Rabbit

1048
01:05:11,595 --> 01:05:15,355
Speaker 5:  a minute to just kind of go do their thing and they've been slowly

1049
01:05:15,355 --> 01:05:19,245
Speaker 5:  launching some of the stuff that they've been talking about. So the, the

1050
01:05:19,245 --> 01:05:23,205
Speaker 5:  thing that came out this week is an agent that can

1051
01:05:23,365 --> 01:05:27,245
Speaker 5:  actually go and use Android apps for you and it's just a research

1052
01:05:27,245 --> 01:05:30,725
Speaker 5:  prototype and it's essentially like if you've used operator or any of these

1053
01:05:30,725 --> 01:05:32,965
Speaker 5:  other things or even like read the white papers, it's exactly what you think.

1054
01:05:32,965 --> 01:05:36,805
Speaker 5:  It's basically like clicking around an app on your behalf. But

1055
01:05:36,805 --> 01:05:40,205
Speaker 5:  like it's starting to be able to do those things. And so I think

1056
01:05:40,495 --> 01:05:44,445
Speaker 5:  again, this question of do I want it to happen on this device

1057
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:48,645
Speaker 5:  that is going to go in my pocket or do I want it to happen on my phone that

1058
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:52,205
Speaker 5:  is already in my pocket? That's, that's a big hurdle

1059
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:56,325
Speaker 5:  even once somebody figures out this technology, but like

1060
01:05:56,835 --> 01:06:00,445
Speaker 5:  genuine kudos to Rabbit for continuing to plug away at this thing, I think.

1061
01:06:00,445 --> 01:06:01,805
Speaker 5:  And I think it'll be interesting to see where it goes.

1062
01:06:02,515 --> 01:06:05,845
Speaker 6:  It's the, the other answer to your question, Jake, of like,

1063
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:09,725
Speaker 6:  how do you build AI for people? If you aren't

1064
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:14,085
Speaker 6:  Apple or Google, how do you get in, you know, without

1065
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:18,045
Speaker 6:  getting into those ecosystems is like you, you make a little

1066
01:06:18,465 --> 01:06:21,885
Speaker 6:  flashy gadget and release it and get a lot of attention.

1067
01:06:22,265 --> 01:06:25,925
Speaker 6:  And then maybe they were just always gonna do this,

1068
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:29,925
Speaker 6:  you know, the large action model and, and maybe it's like

1069
01:06:30,035 --> 01:06:33,685
Speaker 6:  sort of tangentially related to the hardware, but it just

1070
01:06:33,705 --> 01:06:37,325
Speaker 6:  clicks around for you. And like, it's,

1071
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:41,725
Speaker 6:  it's interesting, it's intriguing, but I still, I see it and I

1072
01:06:41,725 --> 01:06:45,485
Speaker 6:  think like, well the app intent that's coming, you know,

1073
01:06:45,915 --> 01:06:49,765
Speaker 6:  with the like smarter theory and iOS 18 is

1074
01:06:50,555 --> 01:06:54,445
Speaker 6:  kind of gonna be able to do those things for you. It seems like, it seems

1075
01:06:54,445 --> 01:06:58,405
Speaker 6:  like they're trying to shortcut their way around. Like we can't

1076
01:06:58,825 --> 01:07:02,645
Speaker 6:  get into the operating system the way that Apple obviously can.

1077
01:07:02,745 --> 01:07:05,885
Speaker 6:  And it's like a weird wonky kind of workaround.

1078
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:10,765
Speaker 7:  I I, I do think there's something really delightful in that we

1079
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:14,165
Speaker 7:  were like, well, it's too complicated to get all the APIs and nobody can

1080
01:07:14,165 --> 01:07:18,045
Speaker 7:  give us access to all this. Let's just train computers to be

1081
01:07:18,045 --> 01:07:22,005
Speaker 7:  able to understand everything that they see and move a mouse around and

1082
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:25,485
Speaker 7:  just do all the things a human can do. And then we don't have to get actual

1083
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:29,405
Speaker 7:  access, which is just so wildly complicated.

1084
01:07:29,785 --> 01:07:33,685
Speaker 7:  But also like, I I get that works that you can do everything If you

1085
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:34,005
Speaker 7:  can do that.

1086
01:07:34,795 --> 01:07:38,245
Speaker 5:  It's just hard. It's such a damning critique of like regulatory systems and

1087
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:42,325
Speaker 5:  capitalism that is the case. It's like, oh no, you

1088
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:45,885
Speaker 5:  can either make Apple Play nice

1089
01:07:46,505 --> 01:07:50,485
Speaker 5:  or you can invent several unforeseeably new

1090
01:07:50,485 --> 01:07:54,005
Speaker 5:  technologies that just end around the whole process.

1091
01:07:54,235 --> 01:07:56,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's like, well I guess we'll just go invent the new technologies

1092
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:59,645
Speaker 5:  and it'll be fine. To that end, actually one more thing we should talk about

1093
01:07:59,645 --> 01:08:03,565
Speaker 5:  before we take a break and then go to the lightning ground is Amazon is having

1094
01:08:03,565 --> 01:08:07,445
Speaker 5:  an event next week where I would say we're somewhere between like

1095
01:08:07,445 --> 01:08:10,405
Speaker 5:  kind of confident and extremely confident that they're going to finally launch

1096
01:08:10,405 --> 01:08:13,805
Speaker 5:  this new Alexa we've been hearing about forever. It would be so funny

1097
01:08:14,265 --> 01:08:17,325
Speaker 5:  if this was just like, here's some new heroes, like the ones we launched

1098
01:08:17,435 --> 01:08:21,245
Speaker 5:  this week. Look at arrows, here it is. We did a ring again,

1099
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:25,475
Speaker 5:  but I think it's gonna be the new Alexa. And I think Amazon is

1100
01:08:25,655 --> 01:08:29,315
Speaker 5:  the company maybe best positioned other than Apple and Google

1101
01:08:30,095 --> 01:08:33,835
Speaker 5:  to build this AI stuff in a much more coherent way,

1102
01:08:33,845 --> 01:08:37,555
Speaker 5:  right? Like it has lots of business relationships with the

1103
01:08:37,755 --> 01:08:41,035
Speaker 5:  companies it would need to get the data to do this stuff. We've heard that

1104
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:44,755
Speaker 5:  it's working with providers more directly instead of like

1105
01:08:44,975 --> 01:08:48,115
Speaker 5:  trying to do the hacky go to use the DoorDash website, they're actually going

1106
01:08:48,115 --> 01:08:51,795
Speaker 5:  to like integrate with DoorDash in a more meaningful way. And if

1107
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:55,715
Speaker 5:  anybody has the, the literal resources and time and

1108
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:59,595
Speaker 5:  energy and whatever to bake this stuff in, in, in a way that feels

1109
01:08:59,655 --> 01:09:02,715
Speaker 5:  st sturdier than just clicking around a virtual Chrome instance,

1110
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:07,155
Speaker 5:  it would be Amazon. And yet every single piece of reporting and rumor about

1111
01:09:07,155 --> 01:09:10,755
Speaker 5:  Amazon suggests that the new Alexa is going to be very bad. And I just,

1112
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:12,115
Speaker 5:  I don't know how to feel about that.

1113
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:14,075
Speaker 7:  I still do not think people are gonna pay for this.

1114
01:09:15,145 --> 01:09:18,755
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Oh, I ha yeah, they keep getting that gonna charge. That's the, the

1115
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,235
Speaker 5:  rumor has been that it's gonna, it's gonna come with an up charge. Oh no.

1116
01:09:21,345 --> 01:09:24,555
Speaker 5:  Okay. And I don't think that's a good idea. I mean, Google and Microsoft

1117
01:09:24,555 --> 01:09:27,595
Speaker 5:  have both found very quickly that people will not pay extra. Yeah. And they're

1118
01:09:27,715 --> 01:09:30,675
Speaker 5:  starting to roll it back. So like now in workspace, you just get it for free

1119
01:09:31,355 --> 01:09:33,675
Speaker 5:  and you're like, can I turn off Gemini? And Google says, absolutely not.

1120
01:09:33,915 --> 01:09:37,235
Speaker 5:  Under no circumstances will you turn off Gemini. Gemini, Gemini is gonna

1121
01:09:37,335 --> 01:09:40,915
Speaker 5:  ask you every time you try to type anything, If you wanted to type

1122
01:09:41,065 --> 01:09:41,555
Speaker 5:  your address

1123
01:09:41,555 --> 01:09:44,595
Speaker 7:  Instead If you put the Gemini button in the spot where the comment button

1124
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:45,395
Speaker 7:  used to be,

1125
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:46,275
Speaker 6:  Oh no. And

1126
01:09:46,535 --> 01:09:50,275
Speaker 7:  Oh my God, is this driving me insane?

1127
01:09:50,945 --> 01:09:53,875
Speaker 5:  Command shift M Jake what? Command shift m this

1128
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:54,835
Speaker 7:  Is, oh,

1129
01:09:55,045 --> 01:09:55,795
Speaker 5:  It'll change your life.

1130
01:09:56,265 --> 01:09:58,515
Speaker 7:  This is great, David talking to you for an hour and a half every

1131
01:09:58,515 --> 01:10:00,555
Speaker 5:  Day, the text command shift for these hacks, this is what we're here

1132
01:10:00,555 --> 01:10:03,555
Speaker 6:  For. That's change that they'll change that to the Gemini. And then what

1133
01:10:03,555 --> 01:10:04,235
Speaker 6:  will you do, David?

1134
01:10:04,905 --> 01:10:08,395
Speaker 5:  Then I'm, then I'm done. I'm switching to I'm switching to teams After that.

1135
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:08,875
Speaker 5:  I don't know.

1136
01:10:10,575 --> 01:10:14,155
Speaker 5:  All right Allison, we're gonna let you go. Thank you for joining us. You're

1137
01:10:14,155 --> 01:10:17,195
Speaker 5:  gonna have to come back once you've used the 16 e and and report back on

1138
01:10:17,225 --> 01:10:19,155
Speaker 5:  life without Mac safe because I'm very curious.

1139
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,875
Speaker 6:  Sounds good. Thanks for having me.

1140
01:10:21,335 --> 01:10:23,795
Speaker 5:  All right. And we're gonna take a break and then we're gonna come back in

1141
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:25,355
Speaker 5:  a sliding round time. We'll be right back

1142
01:12:42,135 --> 01:12:42,635
Speaker 1:  Let, let's,

1143
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:54,225
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back Time for the lightning round. Unsponsored for

1144
01:12:54,225 --> 01:12:57,905
Speaker 5:  flavor. I just wanna say, I suggested on the show, Jake, you, you were not

1145
01:12:57,905 --> 01:13:01,705
Speaker 5:  here for this, but Neil, I just randomly out of nowhere called the Lightning

1146
01:13:01,705 --> 01:13:04,465
Speaker 5:  round Unsponsored for Flavor like two weeks ago.

1147
01:13:05,725 --> 01:13:08,545
Speaker 5:  He didn't know what he meant by that, but it has stuck in my brain ever since.

1148
01:13:08,565 --> 01:13:12,065
Speaker 5:  And last week I suggested that we should make t-shirts that say Unsponsored

1149
01:13:12,065 --> 01:13:16,025
Speaker 5:  for flavor on it. And you would be amazed at the number

1150
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:19,025
Speaker 5:  of people who have since told me they would buy these t-shirts. So

1151
01:13:20,155 --> 01:13:22,835
Speaker 5:  I can't promise this is going to happen, but this is now a thing. I'm increasingly,

1152
01:13:23,075 --> 01:13:23,235
Speaker 5:  I mean,

1153
01:13:23,515 --> 01:13:27,235
Speaker 7:  You guys talked literally the entire lightning round into existence.

1154
01:13:27,895 --> 01:13:31,035
Speaker 7:  You, you took, so I listen, I, I think there's something here.

1155
01:13:31,035 --> 01:13:34,915
Speaker 5:  Listen, if we, if we can make a shirt that just says emails that is a reference

1156
01:13:35,135 --> 01:13:38,235
Speaker 5:  no one gets, I think we can do on sponsor for flavor. Yeah, I feel good about

1157
01:13:38,235 --> 01:13:41,635
Speaker 5:  it. Alright, we have a lightning round. We're gonna do this lightning round

1158
01:13:41,775 --> 01:13:45,595
Speaker 5:  in two parts. First, Jake, you and I are gonna run through some news.

1159
01:13:45,925 --> 01:13:48,355
Speaker 5:  We're gonna talk about some stuff and then we're gonna take, we're gonna

1160
01:13:48,355 --> 01:13:50,675
Speaker 5:  stop. We're not gonna take a break, we're just gonna stop. And then we're

1161
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:54,115
Speaker 5:  gonna call Lauren Finer who's going to come in and she's going to tell us

1162
01:13:54,205 --> 01:13:58,075
Speaker 5:  about the week in Trump and Elon and DOGE and various governmental

1163
01:13:58,265 --> 01:14:02,155
Speaker 5:  shenanigans. Everyone's favorite segment. Brendan Carr is a dummy,

1164
01:14:02,455 --> 01:14:05,795
Speaker 5:  is on hiatus for this week while Mila is on vacation. But we'll be back with

1165
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:09,795
Speaker 5:  a vengeance on next Friday show. And so If

1166
01:14:09,795 --> 01:14:13,645
Speaker 5:  you, we will give you a moment to stop listening If you wanna stop

1167
01:14:13,645 --> 01:14:17,565
Speaker 5:  listening or watching or experiencing us in whatever way you

1168
01:14:17,565 --> 01:14:21,365
Speaker 5:  experience us when we start talking. So that's what we're gonna do. But

1169
01:14:21,365 --> 01:14:25,205
Speaker 5:  first, Jake, let's run through some news. Let's roll. The first thing I would

1170
01:14:25,205 --> 01:14:26,885
Speaker 5:  like you to do is explain quantum computing to me.

1171
01:14:27,555 --> 01:14:31,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Easy in, in, we have how much time now? Yes. Okay. So there's

1172
01:14:31,445 --> 01:14:35,395
Speaker 7:  these little blah. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Should

1173
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:36,515
Speaker 7:  we describe the story? Yeah. So

1174
01:14:36,755 --> 01:14:40,715
Speaker 5:  Microsoft announced a thing called Myana one, which

1175
01:14:40,735 --> 01:14:44,155
Speaker 5:  is a new chip for quantum computing that

1176
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:48,395
Speaker 5:  includes several amazing words that I would just like to say to you out loud

1177
01:14:48,465 --> 01:14:48,955
Speaker 5:  very quickly.

1178
01:14:50,475 --> 01:14:54,435
Speaker 5:  Microsoft's called it the world's first topo conductor, which kicks ass.

1179
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:58,515
Speaker 5:  It also has a new material made from Indium

1180
01:14:58,515 --> 01:15:02,345
Speaker 5:  arsenide and aluminum also kicks ass. There is a thing called a

1181
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:06,105
Speaker 5:  topological qubit. Love this. I don't know what any of this means, but

1182
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:09,825
Speaker 5:  it appears as far as I understand, that Microsoft made a chip that it thinks

1183
01:15:09,825 --> 01:15:13,705
Speaker 5:  is going to make quantum computing more accessible for more things. Am I

1184
01:15:13,705 --> 01:15:13,905
Speaker 5:  close?

1185
01:15:14,445 --> 01:15:18,395
Speaker 7:  So I think it's one of those, I think with all of

1186
01:15:18,395 --> 01:15:21,715
Speaker 7:  these quantum computing achievements, there's a little bit of like a maybe,

1187
01:15:21,945 --> 01:15:25,675
Speaker 7:  like nobody's quite sure, you know, it's a stepping

1188
01:15:25,675 --> 01:15:29,635
Speaker 7:  stone towards something bigger. I will say, I think, you know, with

1189
01:15:29,815 --> 01:15:32,675
Speaker 7:  ai, If you had asked me three years ago, is AI gonna happen in our lifetime,

1190
01:15:32,835 --> 01:15:36,555
Speaker 7:  I would've been like, not a chance. Not even close. And with quantum

1191
01:15:36,555 --> 01:15:39,595
Speaker 7:  computing, I have been the same way where I'm like, I, I don't need to worry

1192
01:15:39,595 --> 01:15:42,515
Speaker 7:  about this. This is like, it's not a thing, it's just not gonna happen. And

1193
01:15:42,515 --> 01:15:45,635
Speaker 7:  there have been a bunch of really big announcements about quantum computing

1194
01:15:45,835 --> 01:15:49,595
Speaker 7:  recently, and it feels like, you know, the researchers in the field are

1195
01:15:49,605 --> 01:15:53,435
Speaker 7:  maybe finally taking steps there. And I don't think the answer is that we're

1196
01:15:53,435 --> 01:15:57,235
Speaker 7:  going to have Myron on one ships in our houses anytime

1197
01:15:57,945 --> 01:15:58,235
Speaker 7:  ever.

1198
01:15:59,775 --> 01:16:02,195
Speaker 7:  But I, I, I also, one thing I've started to realize about quantum computing

1199
01:16:02,195 --> 01:16:05,875
Speaker 7:  is you don't necessarily need them to be everywhere. You just need one quantum

1200
01:16:06,155 --> 01:16:09,435
Speaker 7:  computer and you can do a lot. And I think we're still quite a ways away,

1201
01:16:09,615 --> 01:16:12,255
Speaker 7:  but it's a cool name. Cool chip.

1202
01:16:12,685 --> 01:16:16,215
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think the, the thing that is making it feel more real for me is exactly

1203
01:16:16,215 --> 01:16:20,055
Speaker 5:  what you just said. The idea that this is not like the

1204
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:24,015
Speaker 5:  next next computer that you own in your house. It's the

1205
01:16:24,045 --> 01:16:27,975
Speaker 5:  next next thing that exists in a data center that makes all

1206
01:16:27,975 --> 01:16:31,495
Speaker 5:  of this stuff vastly more powerful. Yeah, and it's really interesting. I

1207
01:16:31,495 --> 01:16:34,295
Speaker 5:  would encourage everybody to go watch the video that Microsoft published

1208
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:37,375
Speaker 5:  because the way that they talk about the possibilities for quantum computing

1209
01:16:37,755 --> 01:16:41,695
Speaker 5:  is a lot of what we hear companies say about ai, which is just the

1210
01:16:41,695 --> 01:16:45,655
Speaker 5:  things you can do when you massively scale the amount of processing

1211
01:16:45,655 --> 01:16:49,615
Speaker 5:  and the amount of information that a system can understand are very

1212
01:16:49,615 --> 01:16:53,495
Speaker 5:  similar. It's really interesting. So that's one thing. Number two

1213
01:16:53,755 --> 01:16:56,975
Speaker 5:  is, I would just very quickly like to pour one out for Amazon Chime.

1214
01:16:58,035 --> 01:17:02,015
Speaker 5:  The funniest and worst piece of video conferencing software

1215
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:07,055
Speaker 5:  that I have maybe ever used in my life, Amazon is shutting down

1216
01:17:07,105 --> 01:17:11,085
Speaker 5:  Chime, which is, it's, I think there was a brief period where

1217
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:15,005
Speaker 5:  Chime was going to be like an important part of an Amazon suite of business

1218
01:17:15,245 --> 01:17:18,605
Speaker 5:  services, but then video calling became completely commoditized

1219
01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:23,085
Speaker 5:  and that just, everybody kind of gave up. And the only time I've

1220
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:26,925
Speaker 5:  ever used Chime is when I'm forced to, in order to talk to people

1221
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:30,885
Speaker 5:  who work at Amazon. And even the people at Amazon, even the people who use

1222
01:17:30,895 --> 01:17:34,805
Speaker 5:  Chime think it's bad. I, I, I know that for sure,

1223
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:39,245
Speaker 5:  but the thing I just wanted to say is that this, this thing was announced

1224
01:17:39,805 --> 01:17:42,885
Speaker 5:  and a bunch of people were in our comments talking about it, and

1225
01:17:44,345 --> 01:17:47,485
Speaker 5:  all anyone said was, chime sucks. I worked at Amazon, it was awful.

1226
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:51,685
Speaker 5:  And it was, it was great and I just enjoyed it very much. A bunch of people

1227
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:55,325
Speaker 5:  who had AWS reps who forced them to use Chime and now they will not have

1228
01:17:55,325 --> 01:17:57,165
Speaker 5:  to. It's a good day for everybody. I

1229
01:17:57,165 --> 01:17:59,485
Speaker 7:  Just have to say that, you know, before this segment started, David said

1230
01:17:59,485 --> 01:18:01,885
Speaker 7:  to me, Jake, are there any of these stories that you don't wanna talk about?

1231
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:05,885
Speaker 7:  And you can't say Chime. And the only story that I

1232
01:18:06,145 --> 01:18:08,165
Speaker 7:  did not wanna talk about Chime. So Jake, this

1233
01:18:08,165 --> 01:18:12,005
Speaker 5:  Is the last time I'm ever gonna get to talk about the AI pin I and

1234
01:18:12,005 --> 01:18:14,205
Speaker 5:  chime on this podcast. You have to let me have this.

1235
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:18,925
Speaker 7:  I I feel like Chime was just inve. Like who was using

1236
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:21,925
Speaker 7:  this thing? Why were they using it? Why did it exist?

1237
01:18:22,605 --> 01:18:25,645
Speaker 5:  I have always thought there was like a 50,000 word feature.

1238
01:18:25,645 --> 01:18:26,805
Speaker 7:  Why is it called Chime? What

1239
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,245
Speaker 5:  Company? Choices of business software.

1240
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:33,365
Speaker 7:  Why did Amazon think they needed a a video calling service? I

1241
01:18:33,365 --> 01:18:36,645
Speaker 7:  don't, there are 900 of them. Well, do you remember that moment? They have

1242
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,925
Speaker 7:  a team subscription one

1243
01:18:38,925 --> 01:18:41,725
Speaker 5:  Would think, do you remember that moment though at the beginning of the pandemic

1244
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:42,405
Speaker 5:  all

1245
01:18:42,405 --> 01:18:42,805
Speaker 7:  Of sudden didn't

1246
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:43,525
Speaker 5:  Verizon we're

1247
01:18:43,525 --> 01:18:44,165
Speaker 7:  Like, have one?

1248
01:18:44,165 --> 01:18:48,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, Verizon bought blue jeans. Remember Blue jeans? This is

1249
01:18:48,045 --> 01:18:49,285
Speaker 5:  what I'm saying. And for Verizon.

1250
01:18:49,355 --> 01:18:52,445
Speaker 7:  Verizon got mad at me once because I used Blue Jeans wrong. I was like, I

1251
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:55,565
Speaker 7:  I'm pretty, this is your fault. This is, I didn't choose BlueJean.

1252
01:18:56,345 --> 01:19:00,085
Speaker 5:  I'm pretty sure Meta used Blue jeans for a minute. Like truly,

1253
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:04,085
Speaker 5:  I have always thought there is a big story in how companies pick

1254
01:19:04,215 --> 01:19:07,685
Speaker 5:  conference call providers. Like Apple uses WebEx and demands that everyone

1255
01:19:07,685 --> 01:19:08,605
Speaker 5:  who speaks to 'em uses WebEx.

1256
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:12,005
Speaker 7:  I'm just gonna say there are two acceptable video calling services.

1257
01:19:12,395 --> 01:19:16,245
Speaker 7:  There's Google Meet, there's Zoom and anything else. Get it

1258
01:19:16,245 --> 01:19:16,725
Speaker 7:  outta my face.

1259
01:19:17,365 --> 01:19:20,625
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent agree. I have no notes done. Also, If you

1260
01:19:20,915 --> 01:19:22,385
Speaker 7:  Phone, If you online subscription, bring back phone

1261
01:19:22,385 --> 01:19:22,545
Speaker 5:  Calls.

1262
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:26,665
Speaker 7:  I'm sorry. Phone. I'm so with you. Listen, people don't answer

1263
01:19:26,665 --> 01:19:30,185
Speaker 7:  their phone anymore. I'm gonna sound so old and crotchy. Listen,

1264
01:19:30,255 --> 01:19:33,705
Speaker 7:  anytime I get a phone call, I'm like, ooh, who's always calling? I wanna

1265
01:19:33,705 --> 01:19:36,025
Speaker 7:  pick this up. This could be anything. It's a surprise.

1266
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:38,575
Speaker 5:  It's exciting stuff. It really is.

1267
01:19:38,685 --> 01:19:41,495
Speaker 7:  It's always spam, but, but I had a That's fine. Nobody answers.

1268
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,735
Speaker 5:  I had a person I was talking to for a story this week text me right before

1269
01:19:44,795 --> 01:19:48,735
Speaker 5:  we were supposed to get on our Google meet and she was just like,

1270
01:19:48,755 --> 01:19:52,495
Speaker 5:  Hey, can, can we instead just do a phone call so I can like go on a walk?

1271
01:19:53,315 --> 01:19:55,335
Speaker 5:  And I responded to being like, that sounds like that's an awesome idea. Yeah,

1272
01:19:55,335 --> 01:19:59,295
Speaker 5:  of course. And truly the, the joy in her

1273
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:03,175
Speaker 5:  voice when I called her and she was like, I'm outside talking

1274
01:20:03,275 --> 01:20:07,015
Speaker 5:  to you. Oh my God, I was like this. Let's bring that back. Anyway, enough.

1275
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,765
Speaker 5:  Chime. RIP Chime. You were a real one.

1276
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:15,855
Speaker 5:  Mira Murati, former CTO of OpenAI joins

1277
01:20:15,855 --> 01:20:19,135
Speaker 5:  the, the OpenAI diaspora in starting

1278
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:23,295
Speaker 5:  a, I would say somewhat mysterious new AI company.

1279
01:20:24,855 --> 01:20:27,295
Speaker 5:  I dunno that we know much about this company at all yet. Do we?

1280
01:20:27,445 --> 01:20:30,375
Speaker 7:  Yeah, she's spoken a bunch of vagaries. They're like, we're going to release

1281
01:20:31,175 --> 01:20:34,895
Speaker 7:  research. And I'm like, oh, sick. Great. That like,

1282
01:20:35,215 --> 01:20:39,135
Speaker 7:  I, I, listen Mira obviously a wildly talented AI

1283
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:42,735
Speaker 7:  engineer. Clearly, you know, she, she was a CT of OpenAI

1284
01:20:43,175 --> 01:20:46,895
Speaker 7:  while they did some very impressive stuff. So I think there's a lot of potential

1285
01:20:46,895 --> 01:20:49,495
Speaker 7:  here. She's attracting a lot of major talent.

1286
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:54,295
Speaker 7:  However, to your point, there are a lot of companies in this,

1287
01:20:54,395 --> 01:20:58,335
Speaker 7:  you know, AI diaspora and I, I don't

1288
01:20:58,335 --> 01:20:59,655
Speaker 7:  know if there's room for all of them.

1289
01:21:00,435 --> 01:21:04,335
Speaker 5:  It is sort of fascinating how much of this industry is going

1290
01:21:04,335 --> 01:21:08,255
Speaker 5:  to be people who started their company because they disagreed

1291
01:21:08,255 --> 01:21:11,775
Speaker 5:  with Sam Altman in some meaningful way. Like that's the anthropic story.

1292
01:21:12,115 --> 01:21:16,095
Speaker 5:  That's the Mira's company is called Thinking Machines Lab, which is not

1293
01:21:16,135 --> 01:21:16,495
Speaker 5:  a good name.

1294
01:21:17,255 --> 01:21:20,615
Speaker 7:  I like it. I like it. It's if it were, it's like the browser company. If

1295
01:21:20,615 --> 01:21:21,095
Speaker 7:  it was, it's

1296
01:21:21,135 --> 01:21:24,855
Speaker 5:  If it thinking machines, labs, If you be fine with it. If it were thinking

1297
01:21:24,855 --> 01:21:28,015
Speaker 5:  machine labs, that's true. Fine with that too. It's, they put the s in the

1298
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:28,935
Speaker 5:  wrong place. What about it? His

1299
01:21:29,015 --> 01:21:31,495
Speaker 7:  P possessive thinkings machine lab.

1300
01:21:32,075 --> 01:21:32,575
Speaker 5:  Oh, I like

1301
01:21:32,575 --> 01:21:35,815
Speaker 7:  It. It's Doctor Thinkings. Yeah, I like that a lot. Yeah, he's their, their

1302
01:21:35,915 --> 01:21:38,575
Speaker 7:  mascot and he know he's got a little lab coat on

1303
01:21:38,575 --> 01:21:41,655
Speaker 5:  Doctor thinking like a, he's like a question mark. Yeah. With a cloud above.

1304
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:45,775
Speaker 5:  That's pretty good. Yeah. I like that a lot. Doctor thinking, TM

1305
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:48,695
Speaker 7:  Thinking that's who you chat with. Yeah.

1306
01:21:49,555 --> 01:21:53,295
Speaker 5:  But yeah, and we're, we're just in a space where it is kind of o

1307
01:21:53,295 --> 01:21:57,215
Speaker 5:  open AI's ideas percolating out in these sort of

1308
01:21:57,215 --> 01:22:00,975
Speaker 5:  mutated forms in lots of different ways. In the same way that like a

1309
01:22:01,005 --> 01:22:04,855
Speaker 5:  huge portion of the electric car industry is people who cut their teeth at

1310
01:22:04,855 --> 01:22:07,775
Speaker 5:  Tesla and then went on to do other things. And I think that has made that

1311
01:22:07,975 --> 01:22:11,895
Speaker 5:  industry different as a result. Opening AI is very much

1312
01:22:11,895 --> 01:22:15,815
Speaker 5:  doing the same thing around the AI world. Yeah. Fascinating. All

1313
01:22:15,815 --> 01:22:19,745
Speaker 5:  for it. We'll see, everybody's raising the most money it is

1314
01:22:19,945 --> 01:22:23,585
Speaker 5:  possible to raise on earth. So congrats to everybody. Next one,

1315
01:22:23,965 --> 01:22:27,505
Speaker 5:  the New York Times. Speaking of companies against OpenAI,

1316
01:22:28,195 --> 01:22:31,745
Speaker 5:  which is suing OpenAI. Oh, we should disclose here that Vox Media has some

1317
01:22:31,855 --> 01:22:35,745
Speaker 5:  kind of content sharing deal with OpenAI. That, that's all I

1318
01:22:35,865 --> 01:22:39,505
Speaker 5:  know about. So disclosure, the New York Times, which is

1319
01:22:39,595 --> 01:22:43,145
Speaker 5:  suing OpenAI is put out some

1320
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:47,825
Speaker 5:  guidance to its team about how to use AI in

1321
01:22:48,435 --> 01:22:52,305
Speaker 5:  their actual work in journalism. And I put this one on here for you, Jake

1322
01:22:52,325 --> 01:22:55,865
Speaker 5:  in particular, you are our executive editor, you run our newsroom.

1323
01:22:56,605 --> 01:22:57,385
Speaker 5:  How do you feel about this?

1324
01:22:57,985 --> 01:23:01,865
Speaker 7:  I mean, it's funny because I I I don't think there are any reporters

1325
01:23:02,205 --> 01:23:05,845
Speaker 7:  who want to use ai, like, at least for the writing,

1326
01:23:06,095 --> 01:23:09,525
Speaker 7:  right? Like the writing is the fun part. Like that's the part of the job

1327
01:23:09,525 --> 01:23:10,525
Speaker 7:  that we want to do.

1328
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:16,285
Speaker 7:  A and so, and it's funny, If you look at the New York Times guidance,

1329
01:23:16,635 --> 01:23:18,965
Speaker 7:  they're kind of, they're like, don't write with this.

1330
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:24,365
Speaker 7:  The thing that the a that the New York Times suggested that

1331
01:23:24,365 --> 01:23:28,325
Speaker 7:  their teams do with AI is like, I I, I don't know that everybody

1332
01:23:28,325 --> 01:23:32,125
Speaker 7:  will know this, but like when you publish an article onto the internet, you

1333
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:36,045
Speaker 7:  know, you would think there's a headline and an image and then the entire

1334
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:39,965
Speaker 7:  article and you'd be like, great, I put those things in, I'm done. But

1335
01:23:39,965 --> 01:23:43,925
Speaker 7:  there's actually like 50 other really annoying

1336
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:47,525
Speaker 7:  and kind of tedious fields you have to fill out. You gotta fill out a separate

1337
01:23:47,805 --> 01:23:50,525
Speaker 7:  headline for Google. You gotta fill out a separate headline for Facebook.

1338
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:53,805
Speaker 7:  You gotta fill out separate descriptions for all of those things.

1339
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:58,815
Speaker 7:  And, and this kind of just multiplies. And so New York Times is like maybe

1340
01:23:58,815 --> 01:24:01,895
Speaker 7:  you could use to fill out stuff out that you just don't wanna do.

1341
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:06,215
Speaker 7:  Maybe you could use it to like write copy for a tweet or

1342
01:24:06,535 --> 01:24:10,415
Speaker 7:  whatever. And you know, I I think

1343
01:24:10,415 --> 01:24:13,255
Speaker 7:  those are the areas that people find this stuff tedious. I wanna say like

1344
01:24:13,255 --> 01:24:16,415
Speaker 7:  currently we are not using it for any of that. Right. And I do think it is

1345
01:24:16,415 --> 01:24:19,455
Speaker 7:  really interesting to see the New York Times like a, a pretty

1346
01:24:21,095 --> 01:24:23,895
Speaker 7:  a clearly like the, a very, very traditional newsroom

1347
01:24:25,385 --> 01:24:29,365
Speaker 7:  trying to offer their their team some leeway. But yeah,

1348
01:24:29,485 --> 01:24:32,405
Speaker 7:  I think like for us internally, again, like the writing is the fun part.

1349
01:24:32,455 --> 01:24:35,485
Speaker 7:  We're not going to using that. Yeah.

1350
01:24:35,565 --> 01:24:39,525
Speaker 5:  I think the question of kind of where does a good use

1351
01:24:39,525 --> 01:24:43,365
Speaker 5:  of AI end and a problematic use of AI begin is

1352
01:24:43,365 --> 01:24:47,325
Speaker 5:  like the open question, right? Yeah. Because I think a lot of what the time

1353
01:24:47,325 --> 01:24:50,005
Speaker 5:  said is, is the stuff you're talking about like all this sort of metadata

1354
01:24:50,265 --> 01:24:53,925
Speaker 5:  and the kind of the work around the work, but then it's like there was a,

1355
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:57,765
Speaker 5:  a training video. A lot of this is according to to good reporting from

1356
01:24:57,765 --> 01:25:01,365
Speaker 5:  Samphire, a training video that included using AI to like

1357
01:25:01,515 --> 01:25:04,725
Speaker 5:  develop news quizzes. And that's a really interesting one. 'cause to some

1358
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:07,485
Speaker 5:  extent that's a, that's a real like honest to God editorial product.

1359
01:25:07,745 --> 01:25:11,645
Speaker 7:  And I think the thing ultimately becomes, for me with AI is like, okay, great,

1360
01:25:11,645 --> 01:25:15,045
Speaker 7:  if if it can like do this stuff faster, like I, I can like potentially see

1361
01:25:15,045 --> 01:25:18,765
Speaker 7:  it. But once you're having AI put together a large

1362
01:25:18,995 --> 01:25:22,925
Speaker 7:  body of work, the amount of work you personally are going to have to put

1363
01:25:22,925 --> 01:25:26,845
Speaker 7:  in to fact check it to make sure it is correct is is potentially going

1364
01:25:26,845 --> 01:25:29,165
Speaker 7:  to be more work than If you had just done it. Yeah.

1365
01:25:29,645 --> 01:25:33,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The, the whole I have to let AI do it and then I have to fact check

1366
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:37,005
Speaker 5:  every part of it so it actually takes longer. Yeah. Is extremely real. Alright,

1367
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:40,845
Speaker 5:  two more. One kind of breaking ish news today,

1368
01:25:41,085 --> 01:25:44,885
Speaker 5:  Thursday as we're recording this, Amazon now has creative control

1369
01:25:44,885 --> 01:25:48,845
Speaker 5:  over the James Bond franchise. This is something I suspect you

1370
01:25:48,845 --> 01:25:52,685
Speaker 5:  and I both have feelings and maybe deep misgivings about. Okay,

1371
01:25:52,685 --> 01:25:56,485
Speaker 7:  This is hilarious because like a month ago, the, the Wall Street Journal

1372
01:25:56,505 --> 01:26:00,085
Speaker 7:  had some like blockbuster report about how the, the

1373
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:03,965
Speaker 7:  Broccoli family, which controls, you know, the

1374
01:26:04,035 --> 01:26:07,885
Speaker 7:  bond rights in some manner just like hated

1375
01:26:08,025 --> 01:26:11,685
Speaker 7:  Amazon. And so now it sounds like maybe they were paid a lot of money.

1376
01:26:12,475 --> 01:26:13,605
Speaker 7:  Like that seems to be what

1377
01:26:13,765 --> 01:26:16,725
Speaker 5:  Happened. Okay. I'm glad we're on the same page about this. I I I went through

1378
01:26:16,725 --> 01:26:18,645
Speaker 5:  exactly the same, like

1379
01:26:18,885 --> 01:26:20,045
Speaker 7:  A lot of money. Like here,

1380
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:24,165
Speaker 5:  Here is a quote from the Wall Street Journal story to Friends

1381
01:26:24,365 --> 01:26:28,205
Speaker 5:  Broccoli, Barbara Broccoli who has for decades overseen

1382
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:31,245
Speaker 5:  all of the James Bond stuff has characterized her thoughts on Amazon. This

1383
01:26:31,245 --> 01:26:34,605
Speaker 5:  way these people are fucking idiots. That was

1384
01:26:34,845 --> 01:26:38,625
Speaker 5:  December 19th. That was two months ago. Yeah.

1385
01:26:38,645 --> 01:26:42,625
Speaker 5:  And now, yeah, I, the only answer I can come to is Amazon wrote

1386
01:26:42,705 --> 01:26:46,305
Speaker 5:  a big giant check, which makes sense. If I were Amazon, I would write a big

1387
01:26:46,305 --> 01:26:49,785
Speaker 5:  giant check. Yeah. Amazon bought MGM for a huge amount of money. James Bond

1388
01:26:49,785 --> 01:26:53,625
Speaker 5:  is the most important IP that MGM owns. The franchise

1389
01:26:53,645 --> 01:26:57,425
Speaker 5:  is a disaster. Like it's been a while since they put out a movie. The

1390
01:26:57,425 --> 01:27:01,305
Speaker 5:  franchise is great. Like I love James Bond movies, but in recent years

1391
01:27:01,305 --> 01:27:03,545
Speaker 5:  it's been a mess. They don't have a movie, they don't have an actor, they

1392
01:27:03,545 --> 01:27:07,145
Speaker 5:  don't have a script. Like James Bond does not exist because the

1393
01:27:07,145 --> 01:27:10,425
Speaker 5:  broccoli and Amazon have been at the stalemate. So at some point

1394
01:27:11,515 --> 01:27:15,305
Speaker 5:  write the checks so you can start making James Bond movies is just the

1395
01:27:15,305 --> 01:27:16,545
Speaker 5:  obviously correct thing to do.

1396
01:27:16,895 --> 01:27:20,705
Speaker 7:  There's something very like old school and nice about, you know, the,

1397
01:27:20,725 --> 01:27:24,305
Speaker 7:  the franchise having, I don't know, this, this

1398
01:27:24,535 --> 01:27:28,465
Speaker 7:  protector and obviously it, it relies a lot on, on the

1399
01:27:28,465 --> 01:27:32,345
Speaker 7:  broccoli having good taste and making correct decisions with the franchise.

1400
01:27:34,765 --> 01:27:36,625
Speaker 7:  You know, I I think they've done okay.

1401
01:27:38,565 --> 01:27:40,865
Speaker 7:  I'm not a bond expert, I don't, but

1402
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:46,435
Speaker 7:  you know, I I do think like, oh good, the mega corporation that

1403
01:27:46,435 --> 01:27:50,195
Speaker 7:  owns lots of things now controls one of the most lucrative

1404
01:27:50,435 --> 01:27:54,075
Speaker 7:  franchises in existence. Like yeah, like this. If you want more bond content,

1405
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:56,715
Speaker 7:  this is fantastic news.

1406
01:27:57,255 --> 01:28:01,195
Speaker 5:  If you want more good bond content, TBD Yeah. Strong

1407
01:28:01,395 --> 01:28:05,355
Speaker 5:  TBD it really does feel like we're, we're, we're like one turn of this

1408
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:09,275
Speaker 5:  away from like a Prime video series

1409
01:28:09,275 --> 01:28:12,995
Speaker 5:  where James Bond is wearing like Amazon Basics t-shirts and this

1410
01:28:13,275 --> 01:28:16,995
Speaker 5:  all just like James Bond is gonna start appearing on Thursday night football.

1411
01:28:17,105 --> 01:28:21,035
Speaker 7:  Okay. But the Bond Alexa voice, that's gonna be

1412
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:21,515
Speaker 7:  good. Ooh.

1413
01:28:22,455 --> 01:28:25,825
Speaker 5:  That I would be into, I would take that, yeah. But then it would have to

1414
01:28:25,825 --> 01:28:29,785
Speaker 5:  say Alexa at the beginning of every single like as if it was Bond. That's

1415
01:28:29,785 --> 01:28:33,425
Speaker 5:  good stuff. Yeah. So I, that one as somebody who has

1416
01:28:33,425 --> 01:28:37,305
Speaker 5:  almost universally loved James Bond movies, that one is exciting

1417
01:28:37,305 --> 01:28:41,145
Speaker 5:  because I think we'll get movies but also does not bode well for them

1418
01:28:41,145 --> 01:28:44,785
Speaker 5:  being any good. So we'll see. All right, last one before we switch gears,

1419
01:28:46,345 --> 01:28:50,065
Speaker 5:  a headline, I swear we have run 600,000 times on The

1420
01:28:50,185 --> 01:28:53,825
Speaker 5:  Verge dot com. Spotify's Hi-Fi streaming could finally arrive this year.

1421
01:28:54,325 --> 01:28:55,985
Speaker 5:  We can't help ourselves. Jake

1422
01:28:56,635 --> 01:29:00,505
Speaker 7:  Chris Welch has a tradition every year on the

1423
01:29:00,505 --> 01:29:03,485
Speaker 7:  anniversary of Spotify saying it would launch

1424
01:29:04,445 --> 01:29:07,685
Speaker 7:  a Hi-Fi streaming service posting. Hey, they still haven't done it.

1425
01:29:08,825 --> 01:29:12,525
Speaker 7:  It has now been four years, but hey,

1426
01:29:12,905 --> 01:29:15,125
Speaker 7:  it, this could be it. This could be the one.

1427
01:29:15,785 --> 01:29:19,565
Speaker 5:  You know what? I think, I think no one will care anymore. I think

1428
01:29:19,565 --> 01:29:23,325
Speaker 5:  ironically, it has been so long that the number of people who were

1429
01:29:23,325 --> 01:29:27,125
Speaker 5:  like psyched about the idea of truly lossless streaming

1430
01:29:27,985 --> 01:29:31,925
Speaker 5:  has gone down to almost zero. Everybody just bought AirPods and moved

1431
01:29:31,925 --> 01:29:32,445
Speaker 5:  on with their life.

1432
01:29:32,765 --> 01:29:36,445
Speaker 7:  Like, and oh, so, so the, the rumor is, or or the, the story here is

1433
01:29:37,555 --> 01:29:41,085
Speaker 7:  Spotify's gonna add an additional subscription for

1434
01:29:41,225 --> 01:29:44,965
Speaker 7:  $6 a month that gets you Hi-Fi and like early access to

1435
01:29:44,965 --> 01:29:48,685
Speaker 7:  concert tickets and some other features and, and I think like,

1436
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:51,645
Speaker 7:  feels like a hard sell. 'cause I think you're right. Like do people care?

1437
01:29:52,065 --> 01:29:55,845
Speaker 7:  It was hard to tell that you were listening to Flack

1438
01:29:55,845 --> 01:29:58,285
Speaker 7:  under even the best of circumstances

1439
01:30:00,105 --> 01:30:04,045
Speaker 7:  and every other music service just includes it in their default plan.

1440
01:30:04,685 --> 01:30:08,665
Speaker 7:  So like, you know, I I I'd like it,

1441
01:30:08,845 --> 01:30:09,985
Speaker 7:  but yeah.

1442
01:30:10,255 --> 01:30:13,305
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it'll be, it'll be interesting to see. Yeah. The, the report is that

1443
01:30:13,395 --> 01:30:15,985
Speaker 5:  The's gonna be a new tier called Music Pro.

1444
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:21,465
Speaker 5:  And it'll be fascinating to see what Spotify can put in there because obviously

1445
01:30:21,465 --> 01:30:25,265
Speaker 5:  Spotify needs to figure out a way to charge people more money in order

1446
01:30:25,285 --> 01:30:28,945
Speaker 5:  to make all of its investments in Joe Rogan worth it. And

1447
01:30:30,765 --> 01:30:34,185
Speaker 5:  the question of like, what else will people pay for remains

1448
01:30:34,985 --> 01:30:37,585
Speaker 5:  relatively hard to know, I would say. Alright,

1449
01:30:38,735 --> 01:30:42,715
Speaker 5:  hard pivot time If you do

1450
01:30:42,715 --> 01:30:46,515
Speaker 5:  not want to listen to us, talk about Donald Trump and Elon

1451
01:30:46,515 --> 01:30:49,955
Speaker 5:  Musk and politics for the next, I don't know, 20 minutes.

1452
01:30:50,665 --> 01:30:54,395
Speaker 5:  Turn off the first cast. We're done. We're already way over. We did it for

1453
01:30:54,395 --> 01:30:54,875
Speaker 5:  you. Anyway,

1454
01:30:56,575 --> 01:31:00,235
Speaker 5:  that's, that's it. That's The Vergecast. But

1455
01:31:00,695 --> 01:31:03,795
Speaker 5:  If you, we, there is a lot going on and we have to talk about this stuff

1456
01:31:03,795 --> 01:31:07,155
Speaker 5:  because it matters and it is important to everything The Verge covers.

1457
01:31:07,575 --> 01:31:11,555
Speaker 5:  So Lauren Finer is gonna join us right now and she's gonna walk us through

1458
01:31:11,935 --> 01:31:15,635
Speaker 5:  all of the latest in DOGE and Elon and Trump

1459
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:19,675
Speaker 5:  and chaos. So let's get into that. Lauren Finer welcome.

1460
01:31:20,495 --> 01:31:21,595
Speaker 7:  Hi, thanks for

1461
01:31:21,595 --> 01:31:25,515
Speaker 5:  Having me. We have brought you here for a new way of talking about

1462
01:31:26,075 --> 01:31:29,995
Speaker 5:  governmental chaos on the show, which is quickly and at the

1463
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:30,555
Speaker 5:  very end,

1464
01:31:32,395 --> 01:31:35,195
Speaker 5:  I think this is, this felt like a good week to do this because there's been

1465
01:31:36,025 --> 01:31:39,755
Speaker 5:  like a, a lot has happened, but not that much sort of

1466
01:31:40,015 --> 01:31:43,995
Speaker 5:  hugely new stuff has happened. So this felt like a good moment to just kind

1467
01:31:43,995 --> 01:31:47,755
Speaker 5:  of catch up on all of the goings on because I think unless you're paying

1468
01:31:47,755 --> 01:31:51,635
Speaker 5:  attention minute to minute, all of the little stuff adds up to so much that

1469
01:31:51,635 --> 01:31:55,555
Speaker 5:  it can be hard to keep track of. So at the risk of

1470
01:31:55,555 --> 01:31:59,215
Speaker 5:  making you do a completely unfair thing that is impossible.

1471
01:32:01,075 --> 01:32:03,725
Speaker 5:  Walk us through what has happened this week. Let's start with DOGE. What's

1472
01:32:03,725 --> 01:32:04,565
Speaker 5:  DOGE been up to this week?

1473
01:32:05,505 --> 01:32:08,805
Speaker 16:  Oh, DOGE. Well, DOGE has been

1474
01:32:08,975 --> 01:32:12,965
Speaker 16:  continuing to be showing up at different

1475
01:32:12,965 --> 01:32:16,165
Speaker 16:  government agencies. Yesterday there was some reporting that

1476
01:32:17,825 --> 01:32:21,645
Speaker 16:  the 19-year-old do staffer who's gone by

1477
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:25,685
Speaker 16:  big balls in the past showed up at CI

1478
01:32:25,725 --> 01:32:28,765
Speaker 16:  S A, which is the cybersecurity arm within

1479
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:29,725
Speaker 16:  DHS.

1480
01:32:30,105 --> 01:32:34,005
Speaker 5:  Can I just say by the way, that the, the speed with which we've all just

1481
01:32:34,005 --> 01:32:37,765
Speaker 5:  gone to saying big balls without it like being you, you don't even notice

1482
01:32:37,765 --> 01:32:40,525
Speaker 5:  that. It's like just saying a person's name, you're like, oh yeah, big balls

1483
01:32:40,525 --> 01:32:42,845
Speaker 5:  is there the other day. It sucks and I hate it.

1484
01:32:43,555 --> 01:32:47,245
Speaker 16:  Yeah, we do have a federal office named after a meme coin, so at this point,

1485
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:49,325
Speaker 16:  every, this is what we're doing is our game. Yeah,

1486
01:32:49,515 --> 01:32:51,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But anyway, keep going.

1487
01:32:51,435 --> 01:32:55,325
Speaker 16:  Yeah, so I mean we've seen, you know, DOGE continuing to do its

1488
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:58,085
Speaker 16:  thing. We've seen some attempts to,

1489
01:32:59,425 --> 01:33:01,445
Speaker 16:  you know, pull back on that.

1490
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:06,965
Speaker 16:  Y you know, so far there's kind of been this like mixed bag

1491
01:33:07,555 --> 01:33:11,245
Speaker 16:  from the courts. A judge ruled this week that

1492
01:33:11,395 --> 01:33:14,845
Speaker 16:  DOGE could keep accessing government data for now

1493
01:33:15,445 --> 01:33:19,285
Speaker 16:  basically they said, you know, this emergency motion, there wasn't

1494
01:33:19,285 --> 01:33:22,965
Speaker 16:  enough there to keep DOGE from transferring data from

1495
01:33:23,605 --> 01:33:26,525
Speaker 16:  a handful of government agencies immediately.

1496
01:33:27,385 --> 01:33:31,285
Speaker 16:  But the judge also indicated there could be, there could be a

1497
01:33:31,285 --> 01:33:35,165
Speaker 16:  different ruling on the merits later on. So, you

1498
01:33:35,165 --> 01:33:39,045
Speaker 16:  know, they're continuing to move forward at this point. And

1499
01:33:39,305 --> 01:33:42,845
Speaker 16:  you know, in the meantime, you know it, even in an

1500
01:33:42,845 --> 01:33:46,725
Speaker 16:  accelerated way, the courts are gonna take time to

1501
01:33:47,485 --> 01:33:51,005
Speaker 16:  sort all of this out. And in the meantime, a lot of government

1502
01:33:51,405 --> 01:33:55,245
Speaker 16:  employees are still being laid off. The CFPB was gutted

1503
01:33:55,275 --> 01:33:58,645
Speaker 16:  late last week, you know, pretty much all their technology

1504
01:33:58,725 --> 01:34:02,565
Speaker 16:  staffers that help investigate the tech side

1505
01:34:02,565 --> 01:34:03,365
Speaker 16:  of things within

1506
01:34:04,965 --> 01:34:08,805
Speaker 16:  FinTech have been let go. So, you know, a lot of

1507
01:34:08,805 --> 01:34:11,645
Speaker 16:  this is already, the damage is gonna be done

1508
01:34:12,985 --> 01:34:15,725
Speaker 16:  and it's still causing a lot of chaos around here.

1509
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:19,685
Speaker 5:  And that's kind of the bet, right? Is that the, the speed with which

1510
01:34:19,755 --> 01:34:23,445
Speaker 5:  this team can work will outpace anyone's

1511
01:34:23,445 --> 01:34:27,085
Speaker 5:  attempts to stop it and they'll, the damage will essentially already be done.

1512
01:34:27,355 --> 01:34:31,085
Speaker 16:  Exactly. I mean, Musk has been known for, you know, sleeping and

1513
01:34:31,185 --> 01:34:35,045
Speaker 16:  on factory floors trying to just work around the clock to get

1514
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:38,965
Speaker 16:  these things done. And there was reporting earlier on

1515
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:42,205
Speaker 16:  that this is part of it that he's thinking he can kind of

1516
01:34:43,315 --> 01:34:46,365
Speaker 16:  outpace government staffers that he sees as,

1517
01:34:47,865 --> 01:34:51,765
Speaker 16:  you know, lazy or not that productive, which,

1518
01:34:51,905 --> 01:34:55,565
Speaker 16:  you know, a lot of government staffers that I've talked to find pretty

1519
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:59,125
Speaker 16:  offensive. You know, these are people who have devoted their lives to,

1520
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:03,565
Speaker 16:  to these jobs that are in the civil service. And they,

1521
01:35:04,585 --> 01:35:08,565
Speaker 16:  in a lot of cases, especially in tech roles, take big tech, big pay cuts

1522
01:35:08,665 --> 01:35:12,445
Speaker 16:  to work in these sort of roles. So yeah,

1523
01:35:12,445 --> 01:35:16,325
Speaker 16:  that does seem to be the bet here that they can just move forward at

1524
01:35:16,325 --> 01:35:20,285
Speaker 16:  a pace that accomplishes what they wanna accomplish before the

1525
01:35:20,285 --> 01:35:21,125
Speaker 16:  courts can catch up.

1526
01:35:21,425 --> 01:35:25,365
Speaker 5:  And it also seems like it's not like DOGE is like covering itself in

1527
01:35:25,365 --> 01:35:28,645
Speaker 5:  glory and getting everything right and making a series of incredibly like

1528
01:35:28,645 --> 01:35:32,245
Speaker 5:  smart, thoughtful decisions too, right? Like what was the, the

1529
01:35:32,245 --> 01:35:35,765
Speaker 5:  8 million versus $8 billion, you know,

1530
01:35:36,095 --> 01:35:37,965
Speaker 5:  teeny tiny miss that that they made this week,

1531
01:35:38,295 --> 01:35:41,885
Speaker 16:  Right? So there was a, on the DOGE

1532
01:35:41,995 --> 01:35:45,645
Speaker 16:  website where they try to keep track of like

1533
01:35:45,645 --> 01:35:48,845
Speaker 16:  everything they're cutting, there was this,

1534
01:35:50,165 --> 01:35:53,965
Speaker 16:  I guess decimal place error where there was a contract

1535
01:35:54,035 --> 01:35:57,645
Speaker 16:  that they claimed to have cut that was

1536
01:35:57,995 --> 01:36:01,805
Speaker 16:  that they listed as $8 billion, but it actually was

1537
01:36:01,805 --> 01:36:05,645
Speaker 16:  8 million. And you know, the problem might have stemmed from an

1538
01:36:05,645 --> 01:36:09,085
Speaker 16:  issue in how that number appeared in a different, you know,

1539
01:36:09,085 --> 01:36:12,805
Speaker 16:  government database. But, you know, it kind of just

1540
01:36:12,835 --> 01:36:15,965
Speaker 16:  goes to show that this is something that's being

1541
01:36:17,595 --> 01:36:21,365
Speaker 16:  done very quickly maybe with not a lot of

1542
01:36:21,805 --> 01:36:25,685
Speaker 16:  checking on the finer details here. And

1543
01:36:26,185 --> 01:36:29,805
Speaker 16:  you know, I I think that Elon Musk has even said, you know, there'll

1544
01:36:30,125 --> 01:36:33,005
Speaker 16:  be some error, you know, we're not always gonna get it completely right,

1545
01:36:33,225 --> 01:36:33,445
Speaker 16:  but,

1546
01:36:35,315 --> 01:36:39,175
Speaker 16:  and it, that's to be expected. But at the same time, when you're talking

1547
01:36:39,175 --> 01:36:42,735
Speaker 16:  about government services that impact a lot of people, it,

1548
01:36:42,885 --> 01:36:44,975
Speaker 16:  it's really important to get it right in a lot of these cases.

1549
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:49,615
Speaker 5:  There was a wired headline this week that

1550
01:36:49,615 --> 01:36:52,775
Speaker 5:  was like the, the DOGE incompetence is a feature and not a bug.

1551
01:36:53,755 --> 01:36:57,255
Speaker 5:  And I've been thinking about that ever since. Like, doing well is not the

1552
01:36:57,255 --> 01:37:00,575
Speaker 5:  point, right? Like you call this whatever you want every, I keep talking

1553
01:37:00,575 --> 01:37:03,215
Speaker 5:  to people who are like, well they're not even like identifying the things

1554
01:37:03,215 --> 01:37:06,335
Speaker 5:  that would save all that much money. And I keep being like, that's the money

1555
01:37:06,395 --> 01:37:07,455
Speaker 5:  is not the point.

1556
01:37:08,015 --> 01:37:11,615
Speaker 7:  I mean this is the Twitter playbook, right? Yeah. Like E Elon didn't care

1557
01:37:11,615 --> 01:37:14,895
Speaker 7:  if it broke a little bit. He, he, he gutted the company

1558
01:37:15,475 --> 01:37:19,255
Speaker 7:  and he let things break and then he just sort of built on top of that

1559
01:37:19,255 --> 01:37:23,135
Speaker 7:  broken core. And you know, it's one thing when it's

1560
01:37:23,815 --> 01:37:27,015
Speaker 7:  a, a micro microblogging service or whatever

1561
01:37:28,355 --> 01:37:31,335
Speaker 7:  and it's another thing when it is the federal government of the United States

1562
01:37:31,835 --> 01:37:35,215
Speaker 7:  and there are millions and millions and millions of people who

1563
01:37:35,685 --> 01:37:39,615
Speaker 7:  rely on getting checks and services and benefits

1564
01:37:40,475 --> 01:37:44,095
Speaker 7:  to, to survive. Like, you know,

1565
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:48,585
Speaker 7:  in many ways we optimize to make sure that everything happens

1566
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:51,985
Speaker 7:  correctly. And he is optimizing to make sure that

1567
01:37:53,235 --> 01:37:56,605
Speaker 7:  there are no, or you know, he claims he claims

1568
01:37:57,185 --> 01:38:01,045
Speaker 7:  to be opt optimizing for making sure that there's zero error. But in

1569
01:38:01,045 --> 01:38:01,525
Speaker 7:  doing that,

1570
01:38:03,225 --> 01:38:05,315
Speaker 7:  there's going to be so much error in what gets missed

1571
01:38:05,385 --> 01:38:06,355
Speaker 5:  Because he is just

1572
01:38:06,465 --> 01:38:07,515
Speaker 7:  Pulling stuff apart.

1573
01:38:08,145 --> 01:38:12,035
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I, Liz Lato and I were joking on the show a couple of weeks ago

1574
01:38:12,045 --> 01:38:14,715
Speaker 5:  about like, thank God we filed our taxes early

1575
01:38:15,655 --> 01:38:19,395
Speaker 5:  before DOGE got into the IRS and blew it all up. And it now seems like

1576
01:38:19,505 --> 01:38:22,915
Speaker 5:  DOGE is in the IRS blowing it all up. And I think

1577
01:38:23,225 --> 01:38:26,795
Speaker 5:  like we, we've talked a bunch about what will be the thing that

1578
01:38:26,895 --> 01:38:30,835
Speaker 5:  really makes this feel real for people. Because so much of this is like

1579
01:38:30,835 --> 01:38:34,795
Speaker 5:  theoretical, right? Like big balls is has your social security number, right?

1580
01:38:34,795 --> 01:38:38,315
Speaker 5:  Like that seems bad, but it's hard to know what to do with that. That's like

1581
01:38:38,355 --> 01:38:42,195
Speaker 5:  a very 20, 25 sentence. But I think most people don't really know what

1582
01:38:42,535 --> 01:38:46,235
Speaker 5:  to make of that piece of information. But this thing about like, oh it's

1583
01:38:46,495 --> 01:38:50,155
Speaker 5:  my, my tax refund is going to be massively delayed or canceled or

1584
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:54,715
Speaker 5:  taken away from me for political reasons is like, those are the things

1585
01:38:55,345 --> 01:38:59,265
Speaker 5:  that may start to happen fairly quickly here and

1586
01:38:59,265 --> 01:39:02,785
Speaker 5:  it's gonna be some mix, like you're saying Jacob of like commission and omission,

1587
01:39:02,795 --> 01:39:05,865
Speaker 5:  right? Things that fall apart on purpose and things that fall apart because

1588
01:39:05,865 --> 01:39:07,945
Speaker 5:  there's literally no one left to pay attention to them.

1589
01:39:08,175 --> 01:39:11,825
Speaker 16:  Yeah, I definitely think that's gonna be the thing that gets people kind

1590
01:39:11,825 --> 01:39:15,705
Speaker 16:  of clued into what's going on here. If things that they rely on

1591
01:39:15,705 --> 01:39:19,625
Speaker 16:  start to break or you know, they're not getting their VA benefits or

1592
01:39:20,145 --> 01:39:23,425
Speaker 16:  Medicare benefits or things like that. I also think that there might be

1593
01:39:23,425 --> 01:39:26,665
Speaker 16:  some things that won't become apparent for quite some time.

1594
01:39:27,765 --> 01:39:31,625
Speaker 16:  You know, for example, at the CFPB who, who's checking

1595
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:35,705
Speaker 16:  on the consumer complaints now, who's getting back to those, right?

1596
01:39:36,105 --> 01:39:39,945
Speaker 16:  And that might not be something that you file every day or even, you know,

1597
01:39:39,945 --> 01:39:43,705
Speaker 16:  every year, but at some point it's going to become apparent

1598
01:39:43,965 --> 01:39:47,025
Speaker 16:  If, you know, those sorts of complaints aren't being answered to,

1599
01:39:47,495 --> 01:39:50,465
Speaker 5:  Yeah, wasn't there a bill last week to like

1600
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:55,105
Speaker 5:  increase bank fees? That's like, this is the sort of thing that the CF

1601
01:39:55,205 --> 01:39:58,985
Speaker 5:  PB exists to make sure does not happen and that

1602
01:39:59,015 --> 01:40:02,985
Speaker 5:  overdraft fees can't kill you as a person who made a mistake with

1603
01:40:02,985 --> 01:40:06,785
Speaker 5:  your ATM card. Like these are the things that we just don't have in place

1604
01:40:06,785 --> 01:40:10,425
Speaker 5:  anymore. Lauren, a couple of specific things I do want to touch on here.

1605
01:40:10,805 --> 01:40:14,745
Speaker 5:  One is Trump's executive order about the FTC and

1606
01:40:14,745 --> 01:40:17,185
Speaker 5:  the FCC. Can you explain that?

1607
01:40:17,905 --> 01:40:18,425
Speaker 16:  I can try.

1608
01:40:19,895 --> 01:40:20,865
Speaker 5:  It's the best we can hope for.

1609
01:40:21,255 --> 01:40:24,945
Speaker 16:  Yeah, yeah. Basically in this new

1610
01:40:24,945 --> 01:40:28,385
Speaker 16:  executive order this week, president Trump

1611
01:40:29,135 --> 01:40:33,065
Speaker 16:  basically asserted that the, the

1612
01:40:33,065 --> 01:40:36,945
Speaker 16:  White House has this kind of authority to supervise what

1613
01:40:36,945 --> 01:40:40,145
Speaker 16:  have typically been independent regulatory agencies.

1614
01:40:40,985 --> 01:40:44,545
Speaker 16:  Agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission.

1615
01:40:45,565 --> 01:40:49,505
Speaker 16:  And these are agencies that the president does get to

1616
01:40:49,505 --> 01:40:53,405
Speaker 16:  select who leads the agency and therefore sets

1617
01:40:53,425 --> 01:40:57,405
Speaker 16:  the agenda, decides what things get voted on or not. But

1618
01:40:57,405 --> 01:41:01,045
Speaker 16:  at the same time, they're staffed by other

1619
01:41:01,045 --> 01:41:04,085
Speaker 16:  commissioners from different parties. There's rules about how many commissioners

1620
01:41:04,085 --> 01:41:08,005
Speaker 16:  from each party there can be. So there's somewhat of a balance

1621
01:41:08,005 --> 01:41:11,165
Speaker 16:  there and it's hard for a chair to just

1622
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:14,565
Speaker 16:  unilaterally lead an agency in a certain direction.

1623
01:41:15,865 --> 01:41:19,365
Speaker 16:  But in this way it seems like the president is trying to

1624
01:41:19,945 --> 01:41:23,765
Speaker 16:  assert this kind of oversight over these independent agencies

1625
01:41:24,025 --> 01:41:27,925
Speaker 16:  to, it seems, make sure that their agenda is in

1626
01:41:27,925 --> 01:41:31,725
Speaker 16:  line with what he wants. So that's really contrary

1627
01:41:31,725 --> 01:41:35,645
Speaker 16:  to how these agencies have worked in the past. You know,

1628
01:41:35,645 --> 01:41:38,685
Speaker 16:  obviously he's already installed people that he seems to think

1629
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:42,645
Speaker 16:  align with him and his political values. If you look at

1630
01:41:43,385 --> 01:41:47,085
Speaker 16:  Andrew Ferguson at the FTC and Brendan Carr at the FCC

1631
01:41:47,925 --> 01:41:49,965
Speaker 16:  and some of the recent statements they've made,

1632
01:41:50,075 --> 01:41:53,605
Speaker 5:  They have been just thrilled to talk about how much they love doing Donald

1633
01:41:53,605 --> 01:41:57,445
Speaker 5:  Trump's bidding. Like if anything you're, you're underselling the extent

1634
01:41:57,445 --> 01:42:01,085
Speaker 5:  to which he already has lackeys in charge and has decided that was not enough.

1635
01:42:01,155 --> 01:42:01,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1636
01:42:01,505 --> 01:42:05,085
Speaker 7:  I'm confused why he would even need to do this. Like, is Brendan car gonna

1637
01:42:05,085 --> 01:42:08,165
Speaker 7:  go rogue and be like, eh, neutrality is pretty good.

1638
01:42:09,635 --> 01:42:13,485
Speaker 16:  Yeah, I, I think, you know, obviously I think this applies to many

1639
01:42:13,485 --> 01:42:17,365
Speaker 16:  more agencies than just those two. I think it would apply to

1640
01:42:17,685 --> 01:42:21,285
Speaker 16:  agencies like the SEC for example, but,

1641
01:42:21,505 --> 01:42:25,405
Speaker 16:  you know, I think it just is another way of Trump asserting his power

1642
01:42:26,165 --> 01:42:30,045
Speaker 16:  and asserting his influence over as much of the federal government

1643
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:33,925
Speaker 16:  as he can. And I don't know exactly what it will look like

1644
01:42:34,105 --> 01:42:37,885
Speaker 16:  for this to be executed. You know, it seems like

1645
01:42:37,905 --> 01:42:41,805
Speaker 16:  he kinda wants these agencies to run by what

1646
01:42:41,805 --> 01:42:45,685
Speaker 16:  he calls significant regulatory actions by the executive office of the

1647
01:42:45,685 --> 01:42:48,525
Speaker 16:  president. What does that entail?

1648
01:42:49,765 --> 01:42:53,565
Speaker 16:  I guess it remains to be seen, but basically

1649
01:42:53,635 --> 01:42:57,485
Speaker 16:  it's just another way to exert the sort of influence and,

1650
01:42:57,745 --> 01:42:59,045
Speaker 16:  you know, whether that's gonna be through

1651
01:43:00,605 --> 01:43:04,405
Speaker 16:  official or unofficial communications with these

1652
01:43:04,885 --> 01:43:07,845
Speaker 16:  agencies. I think there's going to be some level of,

1653
01:43:09,345 --> 01:43:13,205
Speaker 16:  of kind of trying to get these agencies to work in a way that's in line

1654
01:43:13,205 --> 01:43:14,205
Speaker 16:  with the president's values.

1655
01:43:14,595 --> 01:43:18,445
Speaker 5:  Clearly there is no pretense of separation of

1656
01:43:18,445 --> 01:43:22,125
Speaker 5:  powers anymore. Like that's not the, the Trump administration has let go

1657
01:43:22,125 --> 01:43:25,845
Speaker 5:  of the idea that they even need to pretend they're interested in the separation

1658
01:43:25,845 --> 01:43:29,805
Speaker 5:  of powers. I mean, you have, you have Trump saying, well was

1659
01:43:29,805 --> 01:43:32,765
Speaker 5:  it when when someone saves his country, no laws are broken.

1660
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:36,645
Speaker 5:  They're all saying they're just gonna ignore the judges. Like it's, it's

1661
01:43:36,645 --> 01:43:40,565
Speaker 5:  pretty straightforward what is happening here. It's just been interesting

1662
01:43:40,565 --> 01:43:44,485
Speaker 5:  to see Jake, to your point where they feel like they need to actually put

1663
01:43:44,545 --> 01:43:48,445
Speaker 5:  pen to paper on this stuff and where Trump can

1664
01:43:48,445 --> 01:43:51,925
Speaker 5:  just like truth social it into existence and hope that that works.

1665
01:43:52,155 --> 01:43:55,205
Speaker 7:  Yeah, everything's just like yo Loing, like seeing how far they can go with

1666
01:43:55,205 --> 01:43:55,285
Speaker 7:  it.

1667
01:43:55,675 --> 01:43:59,005
Speaker 16:  Well I think a lot of these executive orders, it's, you know, we've seen

1668
01:43:59,965 --> 01:44:03,445
Speaker 16:  an executive order, I think on maybe the first day of his

1669
01:44:03,445 --> 01:44:07,045
Speaker 16:  presidency where he kind of just said, yeah, the first Amendment exists

1670
01:44:07,265 --> 01:44:11,005
Speaker 16:  and we can't censor. And it's like, yeah, that already,

1671
01:44:11,265 --> 01:44:12,125
Speaker 16:  it already said that.

1672
01:44:13,195 --> 01:44:14,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that one's been there a while,

1673
01:44:15,905 --> 01:44:19,765
Speaker 16:  But I think there's just this sense of wanting to assert via executive

1674
01:44:19,765 --> 01:44:23,565
Speaker 16:  order, here are my values as president and here's how

1675
01:44:23,685 --> 01:44:25,205
Speaker 16:  I am going to lead this office.

1676
01:44:26,035 --> 01:44:29,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah, makes sense. Alright, last one. Tariffs. We got

1677
01:44:29,955 --> 01:44:33,805
Speaker 5:  tariffs going so well for everyone. I would say have

1678
01:44:33,805 --> 01:44:37,765
Speaker 5:  gone just swimmingly for everyone involved. No

1679
01:44:37,765 --> 01:44:41,165
Speaker 5:  strangeness. So we're doing more of them. We're doing more tariffs now.

1680
01:44:41,805 --> 01:44:45,125
Speaker 16:  Yeah. So Trump was threatening a

1681
01:44:45,125 --> 01:44:48,445
Speaker 16:  25% and higher tariff on chips

1682
01:44:49,305 --> 01:44:53,085
Speaker 16:  and we've already seen at Acer saying that

1683
01:44:53,115 --> 01:44:54,885
Speaker 16:  it's going to raise laptop prices

1684
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:59,885
Speaker 16:  10% in response to the 10%

1685
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:04,565
Speaker 16:  tariff on income goods from China. So, you know, this is,

1686
01:45:05,075 --> 01:45:09,005
Speaker 16:  they're kind of saying, alright, we see you're raising this, we're gonna

1687
01:45:09,005 --> 01:45:12,885
Speaker 16:  raise our prices. And I think that's exactly the thing

1688
01:45:12,885 --> 01:45:16,805
Speaker 16:  that a lot of economists have feared is that this is really going to

1689
01:45:16,805 --> 01:45:20,485
Speaker 16:  raise prices for consumers. I think the Trump administration would say in

1690
01:45:20,485 --> 01:45:24,365
Speaker 16:  the long run, this is going to be better for consumers, it's going to make

1691
01:45:24,365 --> 01:45:28,045
Speaker 16:  things more fair, it's gonna provide more opportunity within the

1692
01:45:28,145 --> 01:45:31,405
Speaker 16:  us But that's a pretty big gamble here.

1693
01:45:32,085 --> 01:45:35,605
Speaker 7:  I love Acer's response here where they're just like, it's 10. Like yeah,

1694
01:45:35,605 --> 01:45:39,485
Speaker 7:  price can go up 10%. Like what? Like it's 10% tariff, 10% price, act like

1695
01:45:39,835 --> 01:45:41,285
Speaker 7:  it's kind of it, that's

1696
01:45:41,285 --> 01:45:42,725
Speaker 5:  Literally how it works. Like,

1697
01:45:42,725 --> 01:45:45,845
Speaker 7:  Like we just been like, wait, like we've been waiting for somebody to say

1698
01:45:45,845 --> 01:45:49,685
Speaker 7:  this and, and finally, you know, as your CEO came out and was just like,

1699
01:45:49,685 --> 01:45:51,005
Speaker 7:  that's Yeah, it's math. Yeah. Like

1700
01:45:51,005 --> 01:45:54,685
Speaker 5:  That's it. Your government made it 10% more expensive, so now it's 10% more

1701
01:45:54,685 --> 01:45:55,125
Speaker 5:  expensive.

1702
01:45:55,395 --> 01:45:55,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1703
01:45:56,155 --> 01:45:59,645
Speaker 5:  It's just science. What is your sense, Lauren, of how this is

1704
01:45:59,715 --> 01:46:03,445
Speaker 5:  working as a political move? 'cause I think it's like,

1705
01:46:03,695 --> 01:46:07,525
Speaker 5:  there, there are all kinds of complicated economic rationales

1706
01:46:07,525 --> 01:46:10,885
Speaker 5:  behind all of this, but I think one thing Trump has always said is that this

1707
01:46:10,885 --> 01:46:14,685
Speaker 5:  is like a, a move of power and strength for the Trump administration and

1708
01:46:14,685 --> 01:46:18,365
Speaker 5:  it is like a statement of purpose in The world. And with Mexico

1709
01:46:18,505 --> 01:46:21,125
Speaker 5:  and Canada, they were kind of like, we're doing it too. And then Trump was

1710
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:24,565
Speaker 5:  like, nevermind. And it doesn't feel like it's working. Is does it,

1711
01:46:25,185 --> 01:46:25,685
Speaker 5:  is it working?

1712
01:46:27,435 --> 01:46:31,365
Speaker 16:  That probably depends who you ask. I think maybe

1713
01:46:31,785 --> 01:46:34,885
Speaker 16:  he is thinking all along, this is a negotiation tactic and I'm gonna start

1714
01:46:34,885 --> 01:46:38,805
Speaker 16:  from this really strong stance on how we're going to do

1715
01:46:38,805 --> 01:46:39,405
Speaker 16:  trade policy

1716
01:46:41,105 --> 01:46:43,485
Speaker 16:  and you know, land somewhere in the middle.

1717
01:46:45,105 --> 01:46:48,085
Speaker 16:  But you know, on the other hand, you're talking about

1718
01:46:48,965 --> 01:46:52,365
Speaker 16:  putting tariffs on who a, a historical

1719
01:46:52,805 --> 01:46:56,565
Speaker 16:  ally like Canada, that has really changed

1720
01:46:56,585 --> 01:47:00,485
Speaker 16:  the dynamic with that country. So I, I think

1721
01:47:00,825 --> 01:47:04,765
Speaker 16:  it, it's really, I don't know if it would necessarily be the way that Trump

1722
01:47:05,595 --> 01:47:09,325
Speaker 16:  anticipated it would work out. Maybe it is, but it it's

1723
01:47:09,325 --> 01:47:12,245
Speaker 16:  certainly causing a lot of chaos around The world.

1724
01:47:12,475 --> 01:47:16,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I just feel like I, I, I keep reading all this stuff that Trump

1725
01:47:16,285 --> 01:47:19,805
Speaker 5:  says about like, you know, they'll just build factories and plants in the

1726
01:47:19,805 --> 01:47:22,725
Speaker 5:  United States and it's like, oh that's that it's fine. That just takes like,

1727
01:47:22,725 --> 01:47:25,845
Speaker 5:  what's that like two weeks? Like my guy, you're a real estate developer,

1728
01:47:25,845 --> 01:47:29,525
Speaker 5:  you know how long buildings take and then it's like, Intel's over here, we

1729
01:47:29,525 --> 01:47:31,765
Speaker 5:  gave them all the money in The world and they still can't build chips that

1730
01:47:31,765 --> 01:47:35,565
Speaker 5:  anybody wants. Like maybe this stuff is hard and maybe, maybe

1731
01:47:35,625 --> 01:47:38,925
Speaker 5:  that's not the fight that we should be fighting, but I digress. Anything

1732
01:47:38,925 --> 01:47:42,485
Speaker 5:  else, Lauren? What, what else is top of mind in the, in the Trump and

1733
01:47:42,835 --> 01:47:45,525
Speaker 5:  DOGE and Musk universe right now before we get outta here?

1734
01:47:46,245 --> 01:47:50,125
Speaker 16:  I mean there's, there's just so much. I think, you know, I'm

1735
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:53,285
Speaker 16:  just gonna be continuing to track all of this and

1736
01:47:54,305 --> 01:47:58,165
Speaker 16:  you know, continuing to see where DOGE goes next, what sort of

1737
01:47:58,235 --> 01:48:01,445
Speaker 16:  data they're trying to get and hopefully eventually get an understanding

1738
01:48:01,505 --> 01:48:05,485
Speaker 16:  of what they're going to use it for. I don't know if that's something

1739
01:48:05,485 --> 01:48:08,845
Speaker 16:  that even they know right now, but yeah, I think that's the thing that we

1740
01:48:08,845 --> 01:48:10,525
Speaker 16:  really want to understand. Ultimately,

1741
01:48:10,665 --> 01:48:14,565
Speaker 5:  What's your read on how the pushback is going? 'cause like you said, the,

1742
01:48:14,735 --> 01:48:18,565
Speaker 5:  there have been some court decisions stopping things that have gone.

1743
01:48:19,245 --> 01:48:22,845
Speaker 5:  I would say the, those court decisions have been some degree of respected

1744
01:48:22,845 --> 01:48:26,725
Speaker 5:  and disrespected over time, but the, there's definitely been more energy

1745
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:31,325
Speaker 5:  on the other side of the aisle fighting back against this stuff. How is that

1746
01:48:31,495 --> 01:48:32,565
Speaker 5:  going on that side?

1747
01:48:32,875 --> 01:48:36,725
Speaker 16:  Yeah, I think we've seen a, a little bit of success from

1748
01:48:36,725 --> 01:48:40,645
Speaker 16:  the opposition. You know, we've seen some court

1749
01:48:40,645 --> 01:48:44,565
Speaker 16:  orders that, you know, at least put some sort of

1750
01:48:44,565 --> 01:48:48,365
Speaker 16:  pause on, you know, accessing or

1751
01:48:48,605 --> 01:48:52,525
Speaker 16:  changing data or you know, further firings.

1752
01:48:53,825 --> 01:48:57,685
Speaker 16:  But it's definitely been kind of all over the place. We saw that the

1753
01:49:00,175 --> 01:49:03,775
Speaker 16:  Treasury Inspector General said that they'd investigate

1754
01:49:05,115 --> 01:49:08,815
Speaker 16:  doer's access to the payment system and that was in response

1755
01:49:08,955 --> 01:49:12,775
Speaker 16:  to Senate Democrats who had asked for that

1756
01:49:12,775 --> 01:49:16,255
Speaker 16:  kind of investigation. So, you know, we're starting to see

1757
01:49:16,775 --> 01:49:20,415
Speaker 16:  a little bit of this opposition gained some traction.

1758
01:49:21,885 --> 01:49:25,815
Speaker 16:  That said, you know, like I mentioned earlier, there's a lot that it

1759
01:49:25,815 --> 01:49:29,175
Speaker 16:  seems like DOGE is already doing that could, you know,

1760
01:49:30,205 --> 01:49:33,735
Speaker 16:  mess up some systems or access data

1761
01:49:34,115 --> 01:49:37,575
Speaker 16:  or lead to layoffs that are really hard to undo

1762
01:49:37,785 --> 01:49:38,415
Speaker 16:  later on.

1763
01:49:39,085 --> 01:49:42,695
Speaker 5:  Totally. Alright, Lauren, thank you for coming and doing this with us.

1764
01:49:43,095 --> 01:49:46,815
Speaker 5:  This was extremely helpful and, and I think we're gonna have to do this more.

1765
01:49:47,465 --> 01:49:50,605
Speaker 5:  We need to get out of here. I have officially made Jake late for a meeting

1766
01:49:50,605 --> 01:49:54,525
Speaker 5:  that I promised I was not gonna make him late for We've gone way over. Thank

1767
01:49:54,525 --> 01:49:57,965
Speaker 5:  you both for doing this. This was incredibly fun. Hopefully Neli just stays

1768
01:49:57,965 --> 01:50:01,245
Speaker 5:  on vacation. We don't, we don't need that guy. We'll be back next time.

1769
01:50:01,755 --> 01:50:05,085
