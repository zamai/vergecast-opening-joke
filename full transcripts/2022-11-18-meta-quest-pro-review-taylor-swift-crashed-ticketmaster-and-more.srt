Speaker 4:  I got through man. Okay. I won. We're I, I assure you, we will talk about

11
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,980
Speaker 4:  Ticketmaster on this episode of the Verge Cast. There's it's software,

12
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,880
Speaker 4:  it's monopolies, there's a lack of competition and there's Tay

13
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,790
Speaker 4:  to the, it's the most verge cast keywords.

14
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,030
Speaker 6:  This is the most verge cast you can

15
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,230
Speaker 4:  Be. You can, yeah. You add 'em all up. That's the Verge cast.

16
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,630
Speaker 6:  Nothing more verge cast than Taylor

17
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,070
Speaker 4:  Swift. Competition issues and software on the major cultural figure. That's

18
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,700
Speaker 4:  our whole show. It's the whole show. All she needs is Bluetooth.

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,100
Speaker 6:  It's there. That's how you get the tickets.

20
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,710
Speaker 4:  What kind

21
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,670
Speaker 5:  Blue? What headphones do you think Taylor Swift listens to her own music

22
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,240
Speaker 5:  on?

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,390
Speaker 4:  Oh, that's a good

24
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,240
Speaker 6:  Question. She

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,130
Speaker 6:  doesn't,

26
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,070
Speaker 6:  she like, and if she does, she has a very nice audio system. She

27
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,950
Speaker 6:  has other people like play.

28
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,870
Speaker 5:  No, see I go straight to like Wired EarPods. Just like buy, buy a

29
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,990
Speaker 5:  fancy coffee and walk down the street with your wired EarPods listening to

30
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,150
Speaker 5:  your new album. Like that's, that's,

31
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,510
Speaker 6:  Well that's what she would wear like in the Diet Coke commercial. Remember

32
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,230
Speaker 6:  that one? That would always play in the movies. Yes, exactly. She got singing

33
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,950
Speaker 6:  to herself. Yeah. Always wear the wired ones. That's right. Yeah, that's

34
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,670
Speaker 4:  True. Okay, well two things. I forgot. Thoughts, two

35
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,550
Speaker 4:  things. One, there was the phenomenon of Ah, girl

36
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,660
Speaker 4:  wired EarPods. Yeah. Took place over last summer. That was the whole thing.

37
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,510
Speaker 4:  I could see her fitting into that. Yeah. Second unrelated, my favorite Bruno

38
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,390
Speaker 4:  Mar's fact in the entire world is that he masters all

39
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,200
Speaker 4:  of his records in an old Cadillac Escalade that he leaves parked in

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,240
Speaker 4:  his driveway. Yes. Just cuz he says that's where his music sounds the most

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,440
Speaker 4:  amazing, incredible. And I, it is a great, it's a rolling stone profile.

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,160
Speaker 4:  Bruno March from ages ago. He just has it. He doesn't go anywhere. He's

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,200
Speaker 4:  like, this slate is where the magic happens. You

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,550
Speaker 6:  Spent 10,000 on your speaker. Stupid.

45
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,240
Speaker 4:  Like if it doesn't sound good in the slate, it doesn't sound good. I have

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Speaker 4:  to imagine Taylor has a similar superstitious

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,020
Speaker 4:  audio situation

48
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,120
Speaker 6:  And it's the EarPods.

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah, she's got like a pair

50
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Speaker 6:  Wired, sorry, EarPods like

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,680
Speaker 4:  Wired EarPods. She's got a pair that was like old cost headphones with like

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,800
Speaker 4:  the, you know, the foam is getting all rotted out. Like those are her special

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Speaker 4:  ones that everything sounds good on. Yeah. Yeah. Like she's bringing that

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,760
Speaker 4:  to the national guy Studio being like, I need to plug these in. They're porta

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,630
Speaker 4:  pros. Like I feel it. That's just my theory. If you know,

56
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,880
Speaker 4:  I would, I'm dying to know. Cuz it can't just be airplanes.

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,800
Speaker 6:  What if she burns it to a CD and plays it on her old

58
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,530
Speaker 6:  Discman?

59
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,600
Speaker 4:  Oh that's like her thing. Her thing. If it doesn't,

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,680
Speaker 6:  Cause she's from that era, so she's like, okay, I gotta put it on my Discman

61
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,600
Speaker 6:  that I've had since 2000. See how I sound?

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,100
Speaker 6:  I sound great. Ship it. We're done here.

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,400
Speaker 4:  How do we always end up talking about burning optical media with you? It

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,640
Speaker 4:  has I on the show. It's

65
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,020
Speaker 6:  So often.

66
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,400
Speaker 4:  All right. Hi, it's the Verest. I'm your friend Eli. That's Alex Kranz.

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,920
Speaker 6:  Hi. I'm your friend that's really sorry. Reckless Patel has been quiet this

68
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,630
Speaker 6:  week. He's trying to get those T Swift tickets.

69
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,133
Speaker 4:  I if only my clone. I can't wait to talk about this experience. David Pierce

70
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:25,480
Speaker 4:  is here.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,960
Speaker 5:  Hi. I have no interest in Taylor Swift tickets. I'm

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,880
Speaker 4:  Over Robertson joining us. Hi. You okay David? When

73
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,400
Speaker 4:  I first, when I knew you as a young man, you cared about Taylor Swift tickets

74
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
Speaker 4:  more than any other young man

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,160
Speaker 5:  That I, oh, I still do. There was, there was a day at the Verge office where

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
Speaker 5:  I had fully half of the

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,080
Speaker 5:  staff online just to

78
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,920
Speaker 5:  buy me Taylor Swift tickets, which is how I know I was early to Taylor

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,160
Speaker 5:  Swift because this was before everyone else was online buying Taylor Swift

80
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,960
Speaker 5:  tickets. No, if I wasn't about to have a child and thus never

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,280
Speaker 5:  going out to do anything fun ever again for the rest of my life, as far as

82
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,080
Speaker 5:  I can tell, I would've been in the Ticketmaster offices yelling at them about

83
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,720
Speaker 5:  Taylor Swift this week. Like that Just bring

84
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,030
Speaker 6:  The baby.

85
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah, the shows are on like June.

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,060
Speaker 5:  It'll like be in college by then.

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,720
Speaker 4:  You leave the kid home alone by June. It'll

88
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,860
Speaker 6:  Be fine.

89
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,680
Speaker 4:  All right. There is a lot to talk about. We will return to the subject of

90
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,570
Speaker 4:  Taylor Swift. I assure you, Ticketmaster just put out an explainer blog post.

91
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,480
Speaker 4:  It starts with we knew people would wanna buy these tickets, which

92
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,200
Speaker 4:  is, I feel like if you are trying to explain your behavior, starting

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,030
Speaker 4:  with, we were aware of the problem that we made.

94
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,900
Speaker 4:  You're already on your back foot. But we have been teasing

95
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,720
Speaker 4:  our Meta Quest Pro review for weeks on the show. In many

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Speaker 4:  ways the written review is up on the website. You should read it. Abby

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,320
Speaker 4:  did a great job writing that review the video review, I think

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,310
Speaker 4:  next week, early next week. It's, it's like coming. It's

99
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,150
Speaker 4:  a hard edit is what I would say. Yeah. Because it takes place not

100
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,970
Speaker 4:  only in reality but also the metaverse

101
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,370
Speaker 7:  Virtual reality.

102
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,600
Speaker 4:  Virtual reality, which is not a

103
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Speaker 4:  predictable, stable or even an easy to

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,160
Speaker 4:  enter environment in any way, shape or form. Right.

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,070
Speaker 4:  Like just logging into the metaverse. Very challenging at a,

106
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,600
Speaker 4:  I mean this is like the crux of your review is like this software is

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,270
Speaker 4:  horrible.

108
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,160
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's the thing that really disappoints me is that meta is

109
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,120
Speaker 7:  typically really, really good at software because it takes software in

110
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,480
Speaker 7:  earlier generations to mean games and it's really good at buying

111
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,120
Speaker 7:  games. And then yeah, you come out with this thing, this thing is all about

112
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,950
Speaker 7:  Horizon. It's metaverse platform and it's, it's miserable.

113
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So let's start, let's actually start with the Quest two cuz you

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,600
Speaker 4:  mentioned games. The Quest two is basically a games console. It

115
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
Speaker 4:  is an, I think Meta itself has referred to it as an Nintendo Switch

116
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,980
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

117
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,800
Speaker 7:  For your face.

118
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a midrange Android phone for your face and it is

119
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,680
Speaker 4:  very much geared around, it's an appliance, it's a game console. You put

120
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Speaker 4:  it on, you pick a game, you play the game, you're done.

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,000
Speaker 7:  Right. There are people who don't use it that way, but if you get it then

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,720
Speaker 7:  they have this thing just ready for you to go. Which is like, Hey, do you

123
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Speaker 7:  wanna play Beat Saver?

124
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And and they have bought up most of the popular games and

125
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,980
Speaker 4:  apps on the Quest two. Like all of them, all of them they are under

126
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,240
Speaker 4:  FTC review for buying within the company Makes Supernatural. Right? Yeah.

127
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,080
Speaker 4:  And by the way, meam put out their answer to that lawsuit this

128
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,960
Speaker 4:  week. I mean I dunno if you listen to Phil Spencer onco this week, but

129
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,720
Speaker 4:  like any company that is in the middle of a competitor review starts just

130
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,280
Speaker 4:  self-flagellating itself with how much they suck. So Phil Spencer's onco,

131
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,790
Speaker 4:  he is like, we suck at video games. Sure. We're in certain place.

132
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,480
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're horrible at, no one likes us in mobile crap

133
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,120
Speaker 4:  garbage. I'm a bad like the whole thing cuz they wanna buy activation

134
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,670
Speaker 4:  Meta is in this FTC review, put out their answer to the

135
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,360
Speaker 4:  FTCs complaint and they're like, we've never made a successful VR software

136
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,780
Speaker 4:  product ever. We've had to buy them all. I mean

137
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,670
Speaker 7:  Not, it's not wrong. Very true. Yeah. That's both self

138
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,960
Speaker 7:  mean. You probably cut VR out of that and it was still most

139
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,110
Speaker 7:  transformative.

140
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,120
Speaker 4:  It's just a very funny legal document. They're like, we should be allowed

141
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,970
Speaker 4:  to buy this company because we actually can't do it on our own.

142
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,760
Speaker 4:  So this would be cool if we could buy the successful company. But

143
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,600
Speaker 4:  the question to a, I think you share this opinion with me is a great

144
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Speaker 4:  product. It's self-contained. It was until

145
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,680
Speaker 4:  recently relatively inexpensive. It over

146
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,600
Speaker 4:  delivers on the core promise, which is you will experience virtual

147
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,220
Speaker 4:  reality in a convenient self-contained way

148
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,230
Speaker 4:  and you'll mostly have a good time.

149
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,670
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I think it, it compensates that there are things that VR

150
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,360
Speaker 7:  headsets still just, they're always gonna be kind of heavy. They're always

151
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,040
Speaker 7:  gonna be kind of bulky. There are still just things that we haven't figured

152
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,480
Speaker 7:  out with them, but they do a very good job of trying to streamline those

153
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,080
Speaker 7:  things and emphasizing the positives

154
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,700
Speaker 4:  Of it. Yeah. So I just wanna start there. That's the foundation

155
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,950
Speaker 4:  for this conversation is the Quest two me's second

156
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,680
Speaker 4:  mainstream VR headset. Right. Is a good product that like

157
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,480
Speaker 4:  over delivers.

158
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But also one, one thing Addie just said that like is is a, I think

159
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,560
Speaker 5:  a useful construct for me. Even like I just went back and reread your review

160
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,240
Speaker 5:  and now what you just said makes a lot of this make a ton of sense to me.

161
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,440
Speaker 5:  Which is like the quest is a thing you like put on use for a few minutes

162
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,400
Speaker 5:  and then take off and it's like even the games are very short. Like all the

163
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,440
Speaker 5:  bad reviews of the games in the Quest store are people being like, this is

164
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,740
Speaker 5:  super fun and it costs me $19 and it ended after 25 minutes.

165
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,720
Speaker 5:  And like that's perfectly fair criticism. But it's also like this is not

166
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,440
Speaker 5:  a thing you're meant to wear for hours at a time. It's like put it on, do

167
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,720
Speaker 5:  your 30 minute workout, take it off, go do something else. Like it is, it's

168
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,120
Speaker 5:  a, it's an episodic thing.

169
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,960
Speaker 7:  Although ironically I've spent way more time in single sessions with the

170
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,640
Speaker 7:  Quest two than I have been able to in the Quest Pro, which is one of my problems.

171
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,200
Speaker 5:  Fair. Yeah. Okay, let's get into that.

172
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah, so I just want to start there. It's not that I, I don't think any of

173
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,720
Speaker 4:  us think virtual reality is a hopelessly broken concept. I don't think that

174
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,680
Speaker 4:  this is like dumb to chase after. Yeah. There's an example from meta of

175
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,520
Speaker 4:  a successful product that over delivers, especially for its previous

176
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,180
Speaker 4:  price, right? The Quest Pro is supposed to do far,

177
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,080
Speaker 4:  far more than that quest to, right? Like the entire premise

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,550
Speaker 4:  is you're gonna wear it all day at work.

179
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,080
Speaker 7:  I mean I hesitate to say what the entire premise is because I am still

180
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,920
Speaker 7:  convinced that Meta doesn't know what the premise is and they just had to

181
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,440
Speaker 7:  come up with a pitch and the pitch they came up with Yes. Is that you're

182
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,040
Speaker 7:  gonna have meetings in this thing, you're gonna wear it for all for

183
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,000
Speaker 7:  using, I don't know, Microsoft Office. Yes. Yeah. It's

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,920
Speaker 7:  supposed to be the professional, the computer that you use. It's like a

185
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,120
Speaker 7:  laptop

186
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,910
Speaker 4:  Especially cuz it's, it's priced like a laptop at 1499

187
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,880
Speaker 4:  before you even add the full white blocker, which

188
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,640
Speaker 4:  I think is absolutely needed on this. So the first thing I would say by the

189
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,460
Speaker 4:  Quest two is the hardware when you pull outta the box is physically

190
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,360
Speaker 4:  far superior to the Quest two. Yeah. Right. It it is just

191
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
Speaker 4:  a nicer thing until you try to use it and then it is

192
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,690
Speaker 4:  immediately revealed to be a much worse thing.

193
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,920
Speaker 7:  Oh I think it sneaks up on you. Yeah, I think those first, my first half

194
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,960
Speaker 7:  hour when I wear it I'm like, oh this is nice. It's so much more convenient

195
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,420
Speaker 7:  to put on like it doesn't have this overhead strap that's really like

196
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,390
Speaker 7:  bad. It's really nice that I can see outside because it has, you know,

197
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,800
Speaker 7:  less light blocking and then like it just, it

198
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,920
Speaker 7:  devolves. Yeah.

199
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah

200
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Speaker 6:  Because that was your complaint, right? Both of you is is that it doesn't

201
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,370
Speaker 6:  block the light on the sides and so you're seeing a lot more of the world.

202
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,720
Speaker 6:  So your, your brain is basically like, what is reality

203
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,430
Speaker 6:  vomit?

204
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,080
Speaker 4:  Well so it, it depends. Okay. And I, this is where

205
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,760
Speaker 4:  this I to agree with Addie, they didn't decide what it was

206
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,160
Speaker 4:  for. So it's trying to be several things. Okay. So if

207
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,100
Speaker 4:  you wanna use it as a VR headset

208
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,920
Speaker 4:  out of the box, this thing will make you vomit because of the light

209
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,480
Speaker 4:  issue. Right. Because the wings it comes with to block the light aren't on

210
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,120
Speaker 4:  by default. So you'd put it on and like do VR stuff in that without the wings.

211
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,440
Speaker 4:  Cause

212
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,930
Speaker 6:  The wings are additional they cost

213
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,250
Speaker 4:  No, no the wings come in the box but they're like magnetic. Magnetic.

214
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,840
Speaker 7:  No, the wings are included. There is a separate thing that you can buy that's

215
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,960
Speaker 7:  $50 that blocks out even more light. Okay.

216
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,800
Speaker 5:  Can you just explain to me how this feels on your face? Because I, I have

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,920
Speaker 5:  now read your review a bunch of times and talked to you both about it and

218
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,320
Speaker 5:  I still cannot get a mental image of why on earth you would put this thing

219
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,840
Speaker 5:  on and they're like, look, it's a headset but you can also

220
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,720
Speaker 5:  have peripheral vision. Like is this like leaky light? Is it like

221
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,000
Speaker 5:  you can

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,990
Speaker 4:  See No, so this is, it's there's a big gap. Look at pictures of it.

223
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,800
Speaker 4:  Like pictures of ADDIE in it or picture their own marketing materials. There

224
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,720
Speaker 4:  are two rubber wings that can magnetically attached to the side

225
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,680
Speaker 4:  that will block out your peripheral vision. Okay. They are not always on.

226
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,400
Speaker 4:  You are meant to take them off. You can take them off and many of the marketing

227
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,000
Speaker 4:  materials, they're not there. That's for I think when you're trying to do

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
Speaker 4:  the mixed reality stuff. Right, right. When you're, when you're doing

229
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,670
Speaker 4:  augmented reality and you're looking through a video

230
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,360
Speaker 4:  feed in the headset and you're looking at the world around you and like basically

231
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,070
Speaker 4:  the only demo that works is now you're a DJ and it's like man

232
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,560
Speaker 4:  I did this in my twenties. Oh look it's just me

233
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,190
Speaker 4:  DJing to no one just like my twenties. Right. Like

234
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,960
Speaker 4:  that's like the mixed reality. Yeah. So you want the light cuz you're

235
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,600
Speaker 4:  in your environment. Okay. So you want your peripheral vision a little bit

236
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,350
Speaker 4:  cuz you're in the mixed reality world. You're in the room

237
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,640
Speaker 4:  that you're in. Right. Which

238
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,800
Speaker 5:  Is where the pass through video also comes in. So you're like okay I get

239
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,440
Speaker 4:  It. Right. And then you can put the wings on. I'm not sure what

240
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,190
Speaker 4:  for

241
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,040
Speaker 7:  This is like a real, the wings are actually completely adequate. I think

242
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,790
Speaker 7:  the wings. The wings stop me from having motion sickness. They're perfect.

243
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,920
Speaker 4:  Okay. So that, so maybe that's for some people it's fine for me. You put

244
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,480
Speaker 4:  the wings on, you try to do VR stuff and I just like got sick and I think

245
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,320
Speaker 4:  that the pancake lenses which make the thing thinner

246
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,130
Speaker 4:  are harder to look through than the Fresno lenses on the Quest two.

247
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,960
Speaker 7:  Do you have to like relax your eyes as like magic eye?

248
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,120
Speaker 4:  It's not like magic. There's just something weird about just unsettling.

249
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,880
Speaker 4:  It's just unsettling. Like I, I just, I, it's less comfortable.

250
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,680
Speaker 7:  I've heard from people who, who actually say the opposite who say like

251
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,200
Speaker 7:  this thing is so much better. I like the way that it has this sort of depth

252
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,750
Speaker 7:  of field but that kind of makes me ultimately think it is subjective.

253
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,600
Speaker 7:  That it is not like this is this necessarily incredible leap

254
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,560
Speaker 7:  forward for everyone. And I think that still just resolution. It's not, you

255
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,480
Speaker 7:  know, metas fault here. Resolution is hard but it is not a huge leap in

256
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,150
Speaker 7:  resolution.

257
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I, again, I'm someone who like works

258
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,800
Speaker 4:  out in supernatural consistently. So I, I spend a lot of time

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,720
Speaker 4:  in E Quest two. So I put this thing on, I was expecting a leap. Yeah. And

260
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,360
Speaker 4:  instead it was just like inherently more uncomfortable and you can put the

261
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,920
Speaker 4:  full face blocker on and then adding, I both had this experience

262
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,720
Speaker 4:  where it wants to all this eye tracking and has a camera for your

263
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,680
Speaker 4:  face. It wants to help you adjust it to look good and there's

264
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,600
Speaker 4:  a little dial on the top. Oh no, that's like move the

265
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,650
Speaker 4:  spacing of the lenses to match your eyes. And the Quest two, it's just fixed

266
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,400
Speaker 7:  To be clear not the problem. And then no it also it move adjusts the distance

267
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,280
Speaker 7:  for your eyes. You, you wanna adjust the spacing you have to reach inside

268
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,800
Speaker 7:  it and press them together physically. Which is not,

269
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,550
Speaker 6:  Which is your thing. Ary

270
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,360
Speaker 4:  Your pd, your pary distance. So in the Quest two there's like three to tens,

271
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,160
Speaker 4:  you get three choices. The Quest pros like 500 choices. Yeah.

272
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,800
Speaker 4:  There's lots of little stops and you have to reach up up through your nose

273
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,480
Speaker 4:  and like bonk it around and it the whole time it's like farther, closer,

274
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,960
Speaker 4:  farther and it's like I hate you. Then you can adjust the,

275
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,880
Speaker 7:  It does it every time I launch an app. It's just, I understand you were trying

276
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,580
Speaker 7:  to give me the optimal experience. I am never going to get that experience.

277
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,320
Speaker 4:  And then there's the depth of the lenses from your eyes, which is the wheel,

278
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,070
Speaker 4:  which is the wheel on top and it just doesn't believe

279
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,030
Speaker 4:  that you have reached the farthest point of the wheel. It's like keep going,

280
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,400
Speaker 4:  keep going to the left. And both Addie and I had the same reaction which

281
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,330
Speaker 4:  was like shut up mark. It's all the way to the left. Like it's, it's

282
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,390
Speaker 4:  so annoying.

283
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,160
Speaker 6:  Well you guys have 2020 vision, like no absolutely not.

284
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,800
Speaker 6:  No add Right? So you guys are like wearing contacts. I'm wearing

285
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,640
Speaker 7:  Contacts. Yeah. No I just, I have one eye that works at the house. Good

286
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,160
Speaker 7:  vision and one eye that's like 20, 40, 20 60 and I compensate.

287
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,730
Speaker 4:  I'm a cyborg.

288
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,710
Speaker 7:  No I just live with it.

289
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,560
Speaker 6:  I do wonder if that's part of it because you know they were saying if you

290
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,360
Speaker 6:  wear glasses you're gonna have to go get special lenses for it to see through

291
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,880
Speaker 6:  it or you're gonna have to go for context. And I think there's a lot of stuff

292
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,530
Speaker 6:  here oriented towards perfect vision. Perfect.

293
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,440
Speaker 4:  There's a lot of stuff here that's oriented towards I think

294
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,360
Speaker 4:  describe the Quest two as compensating. Yeah. The Quest two is an

295
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,680
Speaker 4:  average experience. Yes. Everyone has the same level of average

296
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,360
Speaker 4:  experience. Right? Like you put the thing on you cv, there's dinosaur

297
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,280
Speaker 4:  great grandma screamed, everyone got their views on YouTube today we're moving

298
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,240
Speaker 4:  on. Right. This thing is trying to make you have a great experience. So

299
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,160
Speaker 4:  it actually has all these more fine adjustments for you in your eyes. And

300
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,520
Speaker 4:  it is measuring things and and all of that is,

301
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,280
Speaker 7:  Although it's most of its adjustments are doing things that other headsets

302
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,800
Speaker 7:  have done. It's value add is that it will like it will

303
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,320
Speaker 7:  detect where things are and it will tell you how to adjust it. Which I'm

304
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,240
Speaker 7:  convinced that the reason it has all these annoying things is because it's

305
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
Speaker 7:  gonna do that automatically in the next generation. That they've filed patents

306
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,440
Speaker 7:  that do automatic like inter pupillary distance adjustments. So I think this

307
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
Speaker 7:  is a midpoint but it's an annoying midpoint.

308
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,160
Speaker 6:  Is it like clippy? Like is that the level of annoyance? No.

309
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,480
Speaker 4:  At least Clippy had your best interest trying. Yeah this is very much like

310
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,840
Speaker 4:  I need you to stop talking Mark. It's as far to the left as it can

311
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,820
Speaker 4:  go. Stop it, stop it right now

312
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,120
Speaker 5:  The the middle point thing seems right to me cuz like this seems like

313
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,000
Speaker 5:  directionally clearly the right thing for meta to be trying to do because

314
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,720
Speaker 5:  the whole, you're never gonna get to a point where it just one idea

315
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,000
Speaker 5:  works for everybody And I think the, you can either do the sort of lowest

316
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,190
Speaker 5:  denominator thing, which is gonna make some large portion of people

317
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,000
Speaker 5:  physically ill because VR is cool and fun like that. Or you can

318
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,080
Speaker 5:  eventually build towards this thing where it, there is a magical solution

319
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,960
Speaker 5:  for everybody and I'm super suspicious of the idea that a lot of dials

320
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,880
Speaker 5:  and knobs is the right answer. But maybe someday in the future if it

321
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,840
Speaker 5:  does work automatically that

322
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,680
Speaker 4:  Feels, feels like a good answer. I'm just saying we've paid $1,500 and we

323
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,640
Speaker 4:  we're 15 minutes into this conversation. We haven't even finished putting

324
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,200
Speaker 4:  it on. Right. Like it is just,

325
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,160
Speaker 4:  we're already deeply annoyed at the thing that costs $1,500.

326
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,120
Speaker 4:  This is supposed to be the future of all computing and human experience And

327
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,430
Speaker 4:  I'm like I can't turn this dial anymore to the left than it is.

328
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,840
Speaker 7:  I would also just like to add it puts all my weight on my forehead on like

329
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,680
Speaker 7:  a one inch strip and look again, GR headset

330
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,280
Speaker 7:  straps often they kind of suck. This is just, it's bad in a

331
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,590
Speaker 7:  really specific way that makes it really hard for me to wear.

332
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,680
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it's supposed to be more balanced. Well

333
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Speaker 6:  It's bad in that it's $1,500. Cause I did see some like complaints

334
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,400
Speaker 6:  being like well you could just go get another strap and it's like for

335
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,360
Speaker 6:  $1,500 I should not have to buy additional things to make this

336
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,320
Speaker 6:  thing usable. Yeah.

337
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,160
Speaker 4:  Just so just like out the gate that pro, that's the problem that

338
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,880
Speaker 4:  sneaks up on you. I've worn this thing for a while. I'm a little bit more

339
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,400
Speaker 4:  nauseous than I was in the other one and my forehead hurts.

340
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,720
Speaker 4:  Great. Like this is the future of work

341
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,000
Speaker 6:  Supernatural.

342
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,840
Speaker 4:  Right? Like that's all bad. Then I think Addie has mentioned the

343
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,640
Speaker 4:  display resolution several times. I was just not impressed by it. It

344
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,240
Speaker 4:  has a wider, a wider field of view but it actually,

345
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,480
Speaker 7:  I don't actually even think it has a significantly wider field of view. Looking

346
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,300
Speaker 7:  up the numbers. The numbers are relatively similar.

347
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,840
Speaker 6:  You see, you still see pixels, right? Like you still see

348
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,280
Speaker 4:  Everyone and not to call anyone out but Meta did a lot of

349
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,120
Speaker 4:  influencer stuff where they did the ar, everyone has three screens on a

350
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,840
Speaker 4:  monitor looking through the lens. That's great. That's what influencer marketing

351
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,600
Speaker 4:  is for. And then you actually try it and you're like, oh these three screens

352
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,150
Speaker 4:  are six 40 by 40. Like there's not enough pixels here to play the game.

353
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Because

354
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,640
Speaker 6:  You have to go like way, way, way, way, way, way, way higher than

355
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,400
Speaker 6:  you actually think you do because you're not just being like resolution,

356
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,320
Speaker 6:  you have to be like resolution under little magnifying

357
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,240
Speaker 6:  glasses because that's what makes this vr. Yeah that's just, yeah I

358
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,230
Speaker 6:  was, I was always kind of,

359
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,510
Speaker 4:  It's all grainy and there's a little

360
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,320
Speaker 7:  Text is just, it's hard. Like I guess I maybe dark mode

361
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,920
Speaker 7:  would help but I still just don't even think it really does. And I also should

362
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Speaker 7:  not have to activate dark mode to like read things on

363
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,280
Speaker 7:  Google.

364
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,440
Speaker 4:  Right. Like you bring up a browser window and what you're gonna see is that

365
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,040
Speaker 4:  the border of the window is gonna have, you know that like old school anti

366
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,550
Speaker 4:  Alia thing? Yeah. It's marching shimmer. Ooh.

367
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,960
Speaker 4:  It's all over the place. Gross. And then the text and the browser window

368
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,530
Speaker 4:  is like not very high resolution And

369
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,230
Speaker 6:  Do all your spreadsheets in this.

370
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,160
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So like just from the jump like this basic thing, I'm gonna

371
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,400
Speaker 4:  put this on and I'm gonna have three screens for my laptop, which is what

372
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,360
Speaker 4:  they marketed. I have no, no, absolutely not. I can't think

373
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,120
Speaker 4:  of a reason. I wanted

374
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,960
Speaker 7:  To, if you were already, if you have to use VR for your job and you

375
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,880
Speaker 7:  have like a workflow then this is not materially worse. But it's

376
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,400
Speaker 7:  also if you do not use VR for your job, you should not do this. Do not do

377
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,470
Speaker 7:  this. It is not a good experience.

378
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,200
Speaker 4:  Okay. So that's just putting it on and using it like they want you to.

379
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. None of that's good. And I think the Quest two is superior. Okay. Then

380
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,920
Speaker 4:  there's Horizon which also runs in Quest two, which is just

381
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Speaker 4:  an unmitigated disaster. And the worst part,

382
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,120
Speaker 7:  Let's be specific about which Horizon we're talking about. It is a cornucopia

383
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,890
Speaker 7:  of bad,

384
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,920
Speaker 4:  There's Horizon Work Rooms which is the like

385
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,880
Speaker 4:  conferencing solution. Yeah. And there's Horizon Worlds, which is

386
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,400
Speaker 4:  like the hangout and play games and be cool with your friends one. Right.

387
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,720
Speaker 7:  Sure. Be cool. It's basically roadblocks by

388
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,110
Speaker 7:  Facebook.

389
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,840
Speaker 4:  What I can,

390
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,120
Speaker 7:  And this is probably being flipping, this is the best way to describe it

391
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,800
Speaker 7:  from what I can tell, I was like that seems to explain everything in

392
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,610
Speaker 4:  My No Minds around the corner to buy Roblox by Facebook.

393
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,600
Speaker 4:  No one could for tell. So we tried work rooms and the big

394
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,510
Speaker 4:  feature here is it does the face tracking so you can see expressions. Yeah.

395
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,440
Speaker 4:  This was basically a disaster from the jump. Like even just trying to

396
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
Speaker 4:  get into work

397
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,430
Speaker 7:  Groups is bad. Like

398
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,200
Speaker 4:  I don't know how to, it's we couldn't make it, first of

399
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,120
Speaker 4:  all we just like couldn't make it work. Like why is this video delayed

400
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,710
Speaker 4:  for so long? It's just days of frustration

401
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,080
Speaker 4:  like transpire. I'm

402
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,960
Speaker 7:  Just at ease review. It's

403
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,910
Speaker 4:  Bad. I mean this is some of the worst software that I've ever used.

404
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,440
Speaker 5:  This part is so surprising to me cuz like Horizon Worlds is like a very hard

405
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Speaker 5:  thing to get right. It's like a, a persistent space that you have to get

406
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,890
Speaker 5:  a lot of people in and find fun interesting things to do with them.

407
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,520
Speaker 5:  Horizon work rooms is is conference rooms for your

408
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,760
Speaker 5:  avatars where no one has legs. This is like not hard

409
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,470
Speaker 7:  Software.

410
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,240
Speaker 4:  This is like,

411
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,130
Speaker 5:  Like the idea of how to make this work is so, so,

412
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,080
Speaker 5:  so straightforward And it's kind of amazing to me that they seem to

413
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,790
Speaker 5:  have botched it as badly as it seems like they did.

414
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,450
Speaker 7:  It's just that they spread this thing out across desktop and

415
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,360
Speaker 7:  VR in the most confusing way possible while

416
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,240
Speaker 7:  not taking advantage of, you know, the social networking thing that they

417
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,070
Speaker 7:  have been pushing into VR headsets for like three years.

418
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,720
Speaker 7:  Like you, so you, The entire thing is virtual

419
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,480
Speaker 7:  rooms that you go and meet in. You can't create a meeting in vr.

420
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,400
Speaker 7:  What? Like unless you hook up a separate computer and then

421
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Speaker 7:  go into a browser and then log through this login system. I still don't know

422
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,020
Speaker 7:  what it attaches to what account I put in email address. It seems to work.

423
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,000
Speaker 7:  And then you invite people through email and then maybe they

424
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,360
Speaker 7:  get an invite if you hook it up to a calendar and then they click a link

425
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,000
Speaker 7:  and then ideally they get into the meeting

426
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,710
Speaker 7:  unless they don't get into the meeting.

427
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,520
Speaker 4:  I just wanna point out that the way you're supposed to do this, it's true

428
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,230
Speaker 4:  you're supposed to do all this in computer. You are supposed to install

429
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,600
Speaker 4:  screen mirroring software on your laptop. Oh

430
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:28,880
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

431
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,840
Speaker 4:  It sends your screen into the headset and then the cameras and

432
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,320
Speaker 4:  the headset are supposed to detect your laptop and put a

433
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,060
Speaker 4:  VR keyboard where your keyboard would be.

434
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,290
Speaker 7:  Did that happen?

435
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,200
Speaker 4:  No, because they have not, they don't yet support

436
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,410
Speaker 4:  this 16 inch.

437
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,840
Speaker 6:  So did you like take the wing off and just kinda like look out the side of

438
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,760
Speaker 6:  your eye to type?

439
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,930
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You kind of look under your nose, you know,

440
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,800
Speaker 7:  Finally all my mava speak and paid off. I can touch time.

441
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,640
Speaker 5:  This means at some point there was a meeting where somebody was like, we

442
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,520
Speaker 5:  made a prototype where you're in a workroom and you can just hit a button

443
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,720
Speaker 5:  that says invite people and then you can invite them by their phone numbers

444
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,180
Speaker 5:  or their meta accounts or just have a link that you can share with people.

445
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,000
Speaker 5:  And somebody presumably Mark Zuckerberg goes no they have to install

446
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,280
Speaker 5:  companion software on their

447
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,420
Speaker 5:  laptop

448
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,400
Speaker 7:  And like the companion software, the idea is a lot of it is you have this

449
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,240
Speaker 7:  private workroom and you can do your three screens thing, which we obviously

450
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,830
Speaker 7:  have our own problems with. But it is bizarre to me that you cannot

451
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,480
Speaker 7:  just like log into a meeting and like go

452
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,920
Speaker 7:  into the metaverse on your headset. There's just not any reason to have to

453
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,880
Speaker 7:  use a desktop for that.

454
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,980
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So like say Addie, you start the

455
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,900
Speaker 6:  meeting, you want Eli to come to the meeting and he's in there

456
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,860
Speaker 6:  doing supernatural. He's having a great time. No,

457
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,280
Speaker 4:  No that's a different app.

458
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,110
Speaker 6:  But But you, so you won't get like a notification being like add wants

459
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,140
Speaker 6:  meeting time.

460
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,980
Speaker 4:  There is that stuff at the base layer of the Quest headset.

461
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,620
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You can see if your, it's a game console. You can see if your friends

462
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,430
Speaker 4:  are online. It is not And this is like a very verest thing to say.

463
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,500
Speaker 4:  It is not a

464
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,370
Speaker 6:  Computer. Yeah. But like right now, if I put on the supernatural,

465
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,150
Speaker 6:  I have it paired. So like if I get a slack in the middle

466
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,780
Speaker 6:  of my workout, I can be like, oh I should pause this and go do that. You're

467
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,460
Speaker 5:  A monster. Yeah.

468
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,800
Speaker 4:  What like whatever, whatever. What?

469
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,620
Speaker 6:  But I can do

470
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,380
Speaker 4:  That is monstrous. Just

471
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,900
Speaker 6:  Focus.

472
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,770
Speaker 7:  If you're getting email, be in the zone. In theory it's

473
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,220
Speaker 4:  Free. You know what I mean?

474
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,810
Speaker 6:  Gotta get in that zone five.

475
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,340
Speaker 7:  It's just, just like this is not how you imagine a thing works. Like this

476
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,020
Speaker 7:  is not how you imagine a service from a company that is entirely known for

477
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,580
Speaker 7:  connecting people.

478
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,250
Speaker 4:  Right. Let just describe our first attempt to meet in her husband.

479
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,180
Speaker 4:  Okay. I was at home at was at her house. He I believe

480
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,670
Speaker 4:  was at his house. Yeah. He may have been in our office.

481
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,020
Speaker 6:  He was actually in the Twitter bathroom waiting for the next

482
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,940
Speaker 4:  Office. I'm like, I'm getting in this meeting. I sent add a link. No one

483
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,900
Speaker 4:  got in the meeting. That's just what happened. And so we were just

484
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,820
Speaker 4:  like talking like no one nothing's working.

485
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,940
Speaker 7:  Technically I got into the meeting several times, just not very far.

486
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,860
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

487
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,620
Speaker 4:  Addie entered a meeting at one point and her avatar was just stuck in a

488
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,580
Speaker 4:  wall. Just stuck in a wall. I got into a different meeting

489
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,540
Speaker 4:  stuck into a different wall. That's it. That was our first

490
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,940
Speaker 4:  five hours of screwing with Horizon work rooms just stuck in

491
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,980
Speaker 7:  The corner. We had to get Alex Heath into a meeting

492
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,780
Speaker 4:  Together. It's true. So then we try again. Alex is like, I'm gonna join the

493
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,860
Speaker 4:  meeting. He's just like, I'm not in this meeting. The frustration level coming

494
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,660
Speaker 4:  through Slack, which has been screen mirrored into VR for me

495
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,060
Speaker 4:  is like I'm not in the meeting. Did you guys start without me? I want to

496
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,300
Speaker 4:  be in this meeting.

497
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,020
Speaker 6:  Where is

498
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,460
Speaker 4:  Everybody? Patty and I are just like sitting at a table Vera and our video

499
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,420
Speaker 4:  director is like on Zoom and not on Zoom like on a video conference and we're

500
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,780
Speaker 4:  just like waving our arms at each other.

501
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,080
Speaker 6:  So he's a real person. The jealousy looking down at your

502
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,520
Speaker 7:  Cartoons.

503
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Cuz you can, people can video conference in the jealousy. I felt looking

504
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,360
Speaker 4:  at Veen who was a fully rendered human being, he's got

505
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,320
Speaker 4:  legs in control of his emotions and what his face looked

506
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,000
Speaker 4:  like was off the charts because adding and I are just like, are you winking?

507
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Speaker 4:  Cuz it looks like you're winking the cameras. It

508
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,240
Speaker 7:  Seems to think my eyes are half closed all the time. I can't

509
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,350
Speaker 6:  Figure it out.

510
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm like outta your asleep, you're, you just look asleep every time

511
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,440
Speaker 4:  I look at you, you look mad or asleep or you're winking at me. Why?

512
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,080
Speaker 4:  And I was like, I don't trust what her face looks like so there's no way

513
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,760
Speaker 4:  I can trust what my face looks like. I am now just talking like my grandpa

514
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,400
Speaker 4:  just waving the hands around just, and then

515
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,120
Speaker 4:  I'm waving 'em so fast the headset loses track of them. At one point I

516
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Speaker 4:  knocked into one of the controllers of my real desk and it was like, you're

517
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,920
Speaker 4:  holding controllers now. So then I had like weird outstretched broken

518
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,840
Speaker 4:  hands and I'm just like wave my hands and easy to find

519
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,950
Speaker 4:  my

520
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,960
Speaker 7:  Once that hand tracking has gotten quite good. I don't think that the hand

521
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,720
Speaker 7:  tracking, I did not have materially better results. But like in general just

522
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,240
Speaker 7:  meta's hand tracking has gotten quite good.

523
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,670
Speaker 6:  Better than less.

524
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,960
Speaker 4:  I mean it just didn't like me so I was like, okay so we have our little meeting.

525
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,800
Speaker 4:  You can see part of it in the video. It's not the idea that we're all

526
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,990
Speaker 4:  gonna meet together in that space and have more empathy for each other.

527
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,720
Speaker 6:  Well Veen lords over you. Perfectly ready.

528
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,260
Speaker 4:  Jealous. The only thing I felt that Ven was a real boy and not a cartoon

529
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,280
Speaker 4:  was so mess

530
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,300
Speaker 6:  He had arms.

531
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,960
Speaker 7:  And let me tell you, it is hard to make people jealous of video conferencing.

532
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,700
Speaker 7:  Yes.

533
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,040
Speaker 5:  But that's the thing. Like I just can't get past this idea that like if you

534
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,760
Speaker 5:  want to have a video conference with someone in a meta product, there are

535
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,600
Speaker 5:  100,000 ways inside of meta products to

536
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,520
Speaker 5:  talk to someone on video. And they just decided that this one, which is

537
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,920
Speaker 5:  the one that they essentially care the most about and are making you buy

538
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,840
Speaker 5:  specialized hardware for is just a, the heaping pile of garbage. It's like

539
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:35,960
Speaker 5:  great

540
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,580
Speaker 4:  Job. I mean it's so bad.

541
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,400
Speaker 7:  And all I can figure is that they need this to work with, I don't know, a

542
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,080
Speaker 7:  bunch of enterprise software and it's gonna, eventually it's gonna hook into

543
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,070
Speaker 7:  teams and Zoom. But A, that's not like I, that's not there yet. And

544
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,840
Speaker 7:  B I just don't see how it gets better when you hook it into even

545
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,750
Speaker 7:  more software.

546
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,630
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I promise the Zoom integration that just doesn't exist.

547
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's just like you're like how do I integrate? And it's like nothing.

548
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,710
Speaker 4:  There's press releases. Sure.

549
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,920
Speaker 5:  This is all really validating my like overarching thesis about the Quest

550
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,160
Speaker 5:  Pro, which is that Meta absolutely did not make it to be an enterprise device

551
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,800
Speaker 5:  and then made it and it sucked. And they were like, okay, no actual person

552
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,320
Speaker 5:  is gonna buy this. Can we get it? People to buy it so that their companies

553
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,880
Speaker 5:  think they're cool maybe. And then it became an enterprise device,

554
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,760
Speaker 7:  Which is what makes me kind of mad because if they had actually been

555
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,600
Speaker 7:  honest enough to just say this is not for most people to like use as

556
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
Speaker 7:  a computer. This is for businesses that want to do business things and then

557
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,120
Speaker 7:  they scrapped all of the meta e stuff. Like you don't have to create a dumb

558
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,520
Speaker 7:  meta account to use it. You can just use it like you can use an HTC headset,

559
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,960
Speaker 7:  it's a piece of hardware. If they sold it as hardware, I would be much more

560
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,920
Speaker 7:  positive on it. They're just trying to create this like

561
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,880
Speaker 7:  suite and trying to sell it to people who do not have a

562
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,080
Speaker 7:  preexisting need for a VR headset. And it's really frustrating, right?

563
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,880
Speaker 5:  It's like the, the thing Google did with Google Glass is like, I think exactly

564
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,680
Speaker 5:  what you're talking about. Where they were just like, here's like a small

565
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,240
Speaker 5:  handful of things that this thing does. It's great if you like wanna see

566
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,040
Speaker 5:  an instruction manual while you're working on a thing. It's like there are

567
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,920
Speaker 5:  a small number of things that enterprise VR is like good and real and useful

568
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,720
Speaker 5:  for. And if you just lean into that, that's fine. But

569
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,640
Speaker 5:  meta instead was like, this is the future of everything. This is

570
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,840
Speaker 5:  a glimpse at the Metaverse that we're betting billions of dollars on. And

571
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,830
Speaker 5:  also none of it works

572
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,980
Speaker 6:  When you spend billions of dollars.

573
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,531
Speaker 4:  10, 10 billion,

574
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:25,663
Speaker 6:  10 billion,

575
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:26,794
Speaker 4:  10 billion

576
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,040
Speaker 6:  And you know that you're not actually gonna make money for at least 10

577
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,230
Speaker 6:  years. You gotta, you gotta do something.

578
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,840
Speaker 4:  He's not getting fired. I wanna, I wanna wrap, I wanna come to that at the

579
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,590
Speaker 4:  end of this. Okay. Cause we are not yet through the experience, oh sorry.

580
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,360
Speaker 4:  I agree with Addie that if they were just like, here's our interim

581
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,910
Speaker 4:  point of a high-end headset, it's more of a developer kit situation.

582
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But they, I think Zuckerberg had needed to show

583
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,440
Speaker 4:  something for the name change for the massive amount of dollars.

584
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,600
Speaker 4:  Right? Like this is the thing, he's betting his entire

585
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,480
Speaker 4:  reputation on the Metaverse and he can't be like another year of the

586
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,280
Speaker 4:  Quest two. They're

587
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,920
Speaker 7:  Also just, they're obsessed with locking people into an ecosystem that

588
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,760
Speaker 7:  they're, they want to own the next iOS. And so they can't just offer

589
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Speaker 7:  this as enterprise hardware the way that Google did with glass or the way

590
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,480
Speaker 7:  that hey HTC does. Yeah. With its headsets. Like they have to

591
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,720
Speaker 7:  own this whole software ecosystem and they're bad at software like this.

592
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:19,960
Speaker 7:  You

593
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,170
Speaker 4:  Know how Meta has never successfully made a VR app by itself? Well they actually,

594
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,970
Speaker 4:  or aware of this meta. It's helpful. Tell the court Can I just,

595
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,810
Speaker 4:  we this is like we're concluding, right? These are the wrap up thoughts but

596
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,270
Speaker 4:  no, no point out. We have not yet talked about Horizon

597
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,690
Speaker 4:  worlds at all. Which is just

598
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,910
Speaker 4:  another kind of disaster. Like another

599
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,360
Speaker 4:  creeping body horror disaster that can befall

600
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,490
Speaker 4:  you.

601
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,350
Speaker 7:  So mind experience was delightfully surreal.

602
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,640
Speaker 7:  I hear it wasn't actually that, but I don't know. Cause that wasn't my experience

603
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,200
Speaker 7:  cuz I have no idea how this system

604
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,160
Speaker 4:  Works. All right. So he can't get in any of our meetings by

605
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,130
Speaker 4:  the way, the idea that you would, I host entire broadcast about decisions.

606
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,320
Speaker 4:  If your CEO is like, I made this decision in a VR

607
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,160
Speaker 4:  workspace, you're run from that company, don't work there. Just get out.

608
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Just be like, you know what Elon, I'm not, I'm not coming to the office

609
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,280
Speaker 4:  somehow I'm not hardcore enough for this joint. Like, get outta there so

610
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,600
Speaker 4:  he can't get into this meeting. So like, all right, let's go in Horizon Worlds.

611
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,720
Speaker 4:  Maybe the corporate network block Horizon Worlds, by the way, our corporate

612
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,170
Speaker 4:  network not blocking the consumer playtime

613
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,880
Speaker 4:  vr but blocking the conferencing solution is a

614
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,720
Speaker 4:  perfect encapsulation of corporate networking seems scammy. So we click the

615
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,120
Speaker 4:  button, we drop into Horizon worlds. We're we're trying to like go to Addie's

616
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,240
Speaker 4:  house.

617
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,500
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I have a house in this scenario.

618
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,800
Speaker 4:  She, she has a house in the Metaverse. It's very nice. It's full of shapes.

619
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,840
Speaker 7:  It's full of shapes.

620
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,160
Speaker 4:  Just endless shapes. There's a dark board and then there's for some reason

621
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,840
Speaker 4:  there's a shooting gallery on the

622
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,170
Speaker 4:  balcony.

623
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,550
Speaker 7:  On the balcony.

624
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,440
Speaker 4:  It's a very confusing, it's, you know, daddy that

625
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,640
Speaker 4:  was like, what do I want in my house shooting range? Of

626
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,820
Speaker 4:  course

627
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,600
Speaker 7:  Not incorrect.

628
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,410
Speaker 4:  Confusing. Anyway, so that is Mark Zuckerberg's entire bet. I'm the future

629
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,400
Speaker 4:  of his company and his reputation. Look, I, there's a great piece in the

630
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:11,160
Speaker 4:  New York Times by Cashmere Hill who's a great reporter about the people who

631
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,120
Speaker 4:  spend all kinds of days of their lives in horizon worlds and they

632
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,630
Speaker 4:  love it and they sleep with the headsets on plugged into the wall.

633
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,320
Speaker 4:  It's, it's very much the matrix. They're just brains and vats. But they love

634
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,000
Speaker 4:  it. And you know what? It's America. Do you wanna be a brain in a va?

635
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,840
Speaker 4:  God speed. I hope your crypto investments panel,

636
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,390
Speaker 7:  This is where we get to like, the problem is meta. Like there are

637
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,200
Speaker 7:  services that do this similar, a thing like this and people love it.

638
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,160
Speaker 7:  There is VR chat, there is Roblox, there is, I mean Fortnite, depending on

639
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,080
Speaker 7:  how you define it, it's that meta is in a lot of ways just uniquely bad

640
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,270
Speaker 7:  at trying to get people to the places where they would have fun.

641
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:50,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I just like you started out by saying this, they don't know

642
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,840
Speaker 4:  what this thing is for. So it's not designed to make you have

643
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,800
Speaker 4:  one good experience. It was designed to prove the point that Meta has

644
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,320
Speaker 4:  spent a lot of money making a headset

645
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
Speaker 7:  Just here it is. And

646
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,600
Speaker 5:  I think if we had come out of this and it was like, okay, the software

647
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,440
Speaker 5:  sucks. The, the, the thing sucks, but like some of the new

648
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,320
Speaker 5:  tech that meta put into here, like face tracking and the improved

649
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,040
Speaker 5:  pass through and it's like if, if we, if there was some semblance of progress

650
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,640
Speaker 5:  here that it was like we're not even close to there yet, which I don't think

651
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,360
Speaker 5:  any of us thought we would be, but at least were in a useful or interesting

652
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,120
Speaker 5:  direction. I would at least feel like, okay this is like a deeply

653
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,860
Speaker 5:  hilarious failure, but at least is like some small step in the right direction.

654
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,810
Speaker 5:  But it, it even seems like all of the tech that they built that in

655
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,080
Speaker 5:  in theory should have at least been like a good demo isn't like the fact

656
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,200
Speaker 5:  that the face tracking doesn't really seem to work at all in any sort of

657
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,760
Speaker 5:  meaningful useful way to me is way more damning than like any of the rest

658
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,010
Speaker 5:  of this for the Quest Pro.

659
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,880
Speaker 4:  Oh. But we should mention the video pass through is very grainy. Like

660
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,520
Speaker 4:  it's not usable all

661
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,620
Speaker 5:  The time. Yeah. If you can't read texts, you have nothing. Like

662
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,440
Speaker 4:  I'm, when you turn on the cameras and you're passing through reality so

663
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,960
Speaker 4:  you're doing like fake augmented reality. Yeah. It's is it like, it's like

664
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,720
Speaker 4:  unusually grainy.

665
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,120
Speaker 7:  Is it the same as the Quest two? Cause the Quest two is like super grainy

666
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,930
Speaker 4:  And the Quest two is black and white. So this is basically that color.

667
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,390
Speaker 5:  Oh cool. That's not better. It's like,

668
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean it's just like there's a part of me and I can't, you know, there's

669
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,030
Speaker 4:  two ways to look at this. One, if this is the absolute state of the art,

670
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,010
Speaker 4:  then Apple is not releasing a product for five years. Yeah. Right? Like

671
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,880
Speaker 4:  if this is the absolute state of the art, there's no way that Apple releases

672
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,740
Speaker 4:  a product like this. It is just not ready. Even if the software is great,

673
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,360
Speaker 4:  the thing the hardware can do where they're passing through the video pasture

674
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,280
Speaker 4:  part of it, they're five years away or Apple is way better and they've

675
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,720
Speaker 4:  been hinting that they're gonna do it just to troll Facebook into releasing

676
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,560
Speaker 4:  this thing. Right? Like I, I can't tell. But

677
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,480
Speaker 4:  if this is the state of the art, there's no way that app, the Apple that

678
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,320
Speaker 4:  we know is anywhere close to releasing a product. Cuz there's, it's not good

679
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,400
Speaker 4:  enough to be a consumer product, especially at this price point. And I I

680
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,090
Speaker 4:  think you're right. Like the, the Quest two is a superior product to this.

681
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,880
Speaker 4:  If you wanna like play around in vr, even if you wanna do like the thing

682
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,400
Speaker 4:  where you have two or three screens off your laptop. Yeah. Quest two is better

683
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,220
Speaker 4:  because you'll get close enough to the same experience

684
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,350
Speaker 6:  For a fraction of the price for

685
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,000
Speaker 4:  A fraction. And the Quest three they already said is command next year. Yeah.

686
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,160
Speaker 4:  So it'll probably be cheap too.

687
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,640
Speaker 5:  That is super damning cuz that means meta is not making

688
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,160
Speaker 5:  quick, real, meaningful progress towards this thing that it's

689
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,960
Speaker 5:  claims is right around the corner. Like that's if, if things have not gotten

690
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,760
Speaker 5:  better since the Quest two, that is scary news for Meta and the whole idea

691
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,280
Speaker 5:  of the metaverse.

692
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,870
Speaker 6:  Well I think there's like a lot of technological challenges

693
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,680
Speaker 6:  that are just holding this back. There's the displays, there's

694
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,640
Speaker 6:  the cameras that can do all the spatial stuff while also being able to be

695
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,680
Speaker 6:  good at pass through. There's just a lot of stuff where it's like where,

696
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,390
Speaker 6:  you know, has anybody actually solved this problem even in like

697
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,320
Speaker 6:  a lab somewhere? Are there actually really good ones cameras out there

698
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,040
Speaker 6:  that can do the spatial audio and do the good pass through? Well

699
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,760
Speaker 4:  You use most of the products in the market. You've seen Facebook's next

700
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,480
Speaker 4:  generation tech for control. I mean is anyone ready

701
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:03,960
Speaker 4:  Control

702
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,880
Speaker 7:  Labs? Yeah, I, the thing that I'm mainly curious about how third party

703
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,290
Speaker 7:  developers are going to use this because I think that the tracking cameras,

704
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,280
Speaker 7:  it is possible a lot of like the face tracking, it's possible. A lot of the

705
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,080
Speaker 7:  shortcomings there are software related, right? That there are things

706
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,840
Speaker 7:  where, you know, six months down the line they release an update and

707
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,720
Speaker 7:  suddenly it gets way better and they release, they have a like API

708
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,360
Speaker 7:  that's accessible enough that this gets into VR chat, which is in a lot of

709
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,000
Speaker 7:  ways much more sophisticated than Horizon worlds that you have all of these

710
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,520
Speaker 7:  potential breakthroughs that I really, the thing I'm still

711
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,170
Speaker 7:  really, I think that the pass through is not viable

712
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,000
Speaker 7:  as a good product, but the face tracking I think has a lot of potential and

713
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,560
Speaker 7:  could be really interesting. And I'm very disappointed that they did not

714
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,240
Speaker 7:  find a good showcase for it. And I think it speaks badly of them that they

715
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,120
Speaker 7:  did not like communicate with developers in a way that would have something

716
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,630
Speaker 7:  ready.

717
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,480
Speaker 4:  Even the, the main thing that should

718
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,400
Speaker 4:  be helpful to everyone, which is Foviated

719
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,280
Speaker 4:  rendering where they dere the parts of the display

720
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,080
Speaker 4:  that you're not looking at and put all of the GPU power into the part of

721
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,280
Speaker 4:  the display where you are looking. Yeah. Which is a very cool idea, right?

722
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,220
Speaker 4:  Like next generation sci-fi level idea. Like how do we

723
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,160
Speaker 4:  get the most out of GPU in a super

724
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,100
Speaker 4:  constrained mobile package? Yeah. We figure out where your eyes are and we

725
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,960
Speaker 4:  put more polygons there basically. That's just a cool idea. Doesn't seem

726
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,800
Speaker 4:  to be doing anything. There's, I think, but one game that uses it. Addie,

727
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,440
Speaker 7:  I haven't gotten an official confirmation from Meta on it, but there we know

728
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,990
Speaker 7:  there is a game.

729
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,530
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

730
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,190
Speaker 7:  So yeah,

731
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,040
Speaker 4:  It's like a game. Even like the core promise of the thing is like

732
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,880
Speaker 4:  not happening. Yeah. Right. That you're gonna get higher. Well

733
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,400
Speaker 7:  Cause this isn't for games that they're like, they're just not trying to

734
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,870
Speaker 7:  get developers, game developers onto this.

735
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,840
Speaker 5:  I mean it's, it's for nothing is where it lands basically, right? Like this

736
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,470
Speaker 5:  is, this is for nothing.

737
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,320
Speaker 7:  I think that there are probably cases where this works really well for people

738
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,280
Speaker 7:  with extremely specific needs in the enterprise VR space. Like if

739
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,080
Speaker 7:  you have a thing and you really want to do a particular kind of fo rendering

740
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,760
Speaker 7:  or you really wanna do a certain kind of mixed reality or you just really

741
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,640
Speaker 7:  need a, I don't know, a high resolution

742
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,600
Speaker 7:  ish headset that you can wear that's pretty mobile. Like I

743
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,560
Speaker 7:  don't necessarily think that this is a bad choice, but I am also not convinced

744
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,520
Speaker 7:  that it has any really amazing use cases that make

745
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Speaker 7:  it a must buy over the competition there.

746
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,380
Speaker 4:  And again, the competition is their own headset.

747
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,240
Speaker 7:  The competition is also things like the HTC five focus three.

748
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,680
Speaker 7:  Like there's vaio this company that does actually have just incredible

749
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,480
Speaker 7:  resolution in the primary eye area. Like there are other enterprise

750
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,240
Speaker 7:  headsets. And I mean I am have no doubt that there are

751
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,800
Speaker 7:  areas where this is definitely the best choice. It does not seem obvious

752
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,440
Speaker 7:  to me that it's the best choice. Yeah.

753
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,690
Speaker 4:  Well it's on sale. We'll see how people do. My,

754
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,720
Speaker 4:  my i I keep thinking like a 1920s

755
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,560
Speaker 4:  newspaper whenever we think about summing this up and I'm like, it's Zuckerberg's

756
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,330
Speaker 4:  Foley. Like, like he staked his reputation

757
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,260
Speaker 4:  on this idea and this is as far as he's gotten.

758
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,120
Speaker 4:  Yes. And I, if I were meta, I would've kept

759
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,560
Speaker 4:  this one in the lab. Like fundamentally I would've been like, we're working

760
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,760
Speaker 4:  on some stuff. We've read some great demos, quest three's coming, we're gonna

761
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,640
Speaker 4:  have the, you know, they they, some of the stuff they did right, they had

762
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,520
Speaker 4:  influencers and reporters come in and put on the headset and be on rails

763
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,720
Speaker 4:  for 10 minutes. And you don't quite realize like you can't turn the knob

764
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,320
Speaker 4:  all the way, like in a very controlled environment, this thing feels great

765
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,060
Speaker 4:  and then the second it encounters reality, it just falls apart.

766
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,040
Speaker 4:  And like I think they had to show it. I think they had to release something

767
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,320
Speaker 4:  to prove that all this investment was worth something. Especially as they're

768
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,240
Speaker 4:  laying off 11,000 people and the cuts are not

769
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,200
Speaker 4:  focused on reality labs. They're everywhere. I think they had to have,

770
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,440
Speaker 7:  Although they have apparently canceled their smartwatches, which is really

771
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,600
Speaker 7:  disappointing to me.

772
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,160
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They canceled the portal devices and the smart watches that hadn't

773
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,340
Speaker 4:  come out. So what they got left is this headset and I like,

774
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,320
Speaker 4:  ooh. I dunno. It's, it's something. It's

775
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,800
Speaker 4:  something else. The video comes out next week. All right, we gotta take a

776
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,840
Speaker 4:  break. Addie, thank you so much. Yeah. When we come back, we gotta talk about

777
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,840
Speaker 4:  Elon. We gotta talk about Taylor Swift, Chris Gadgets. There's much more

778
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,960
Speaker 4:  chance coming. We'll

779
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,680
Speaker 4:  grab

780
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,490
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're back now to talk about the two biggest celebrities on the

781
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:24,250
Speaker 4:  planet. Elon Musk and Taylor Swift. Who I think vibe wise, my God,

782
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,800
Speaker 5:  That's, wait, hold on.

783
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,520
Speaker 6:  I don't like that.

784
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,370
Speaker 5:  That's true. Isn't it? Like at this moment in our world, that

785
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,840
Speaker 5:  is literally true.

786
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,730
Speaker 6:  I hate it. That

787
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,960
Speaker 5:  Sucks.

788
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,330
Speaker 4:  Well, 50% sucks. Yeah,

789
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,010
Speaker 5:  50% of what

790
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:41,290
Speaker 6:  I'm fine with. Like Jillian Anderson's just out there and y'all are just

791
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,470
Speaker 6:  calling her trash. This is terrible.

792
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:46,610
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry. There's not a world in which Jill Anderson, it's a bigger celebrity

793
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,410
Speaker 4:  than I

794
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,770
Speaker 6:  Somebody called her the lady from X five. So upsetting where

795
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,250
Speaker 4:  That curve goes up and down.

796
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,170
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah, no, she was definitely 1990, like eight. It

797
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,530
Speaker 6:  was Jillian Anderson. Taylor Swift was in like seventh

798
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,150
Speaker 6:  grade. She wasn't famous.

799
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,490
Speaker 4:  The Y axis on that scale is deeply, I want, you

800
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,010
Speaker 5:  Know, that's, that's an Apple chart right

801
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,210
Speaker 4:  There, right? We're gonna start with Elon or Taylor.

802
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,890
Speaker 6:  Let's talk about Taylor. I wanna talk about T Swift. Let's

803
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,040
Speaker 5:  Do Taylor. Okay,

804
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,030
Speaker 4:  So Taylor Swift, American recording artist, famous. Have you heard of

805
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,210
Speaker 4:  Scooter bro?

806
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,390
Speaker 6:  She will destroy him.

807
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,990
Speaker 4:  Scooter bro, by the way, invited himself on Koder and then uninvited himself

808
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,780
Speaker 4:  from

809
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,590
Speaker 6:  Well he saw, he was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. How much does he, how much does

810
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,230
Speaker 6:  he Swift? Does he listen to? No, nevermind. Yeah.

811
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,180
Speaker 4:  It was not gonna happen. Anyway, Taylor is on tour, the ERAS tour.

812
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,080
Speaker 4:  She hasn't been on tour in three years. Lots of people want to go to

813
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,200
Speaker 4:  this

814
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,800

824
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,310
Speaker 4:  Yeah, she did not get the verified fan.

825
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:09,920
Speaker 6:  That's

826
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,280
Speaker 4:  The only way. And she's like on a class trip, she's not even home. So my

827
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,200
Speaker 4:  sister and my brother-in-law were like designated to buy the tickets. Okay.

828
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,000
Speaker 4:  But they got wait listed. I got in. So like everyone's already

829
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,640
Speaker 4:  kind of mad. So

830
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,400
Speaker 6:  Wait, wait. But you had to be verified, right?

831
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah, but I bought the, I mean I purchased from Ticketmaster before and then

832
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,600
Speaker 4:  I signed, I was instructed to sign up for the pre-sale. So

833
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,440
Speaker 6:  You were verified Taylor Swift fan.

834
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,040
Speaker 4:  And I had purchased the record. Yeah. So I got the Boost. I was

835
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,600
Speaker 4:  verified. You're ready? I was like in it. Yeah. They were on the wait

836
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,040
Speaker 4:  list.

837
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,910
Speaker 6:  Sucks.

838
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,600
Speaker 4:  I was in it. Everyone like already everyone's like sort of irritated at me,

839
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,440
Speaker 4:  right? Like all of our hopes and dreams are on me and I'm like, do do like

840
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,110
Speaker 4:  right

841
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,040
Speaker 6:  With your bad internet.

842
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,840
Speaker 4:  Well I'm bad internet in the woods. I'm looking at my calendar and I got

843
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,880
Speaker 4:  you. You gotta show up on the website a half an hour on

844
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,080
Speaker 4:  ticketmaster.com at half an hour to enter a waiting room and the waiting

845
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,240
Speaker 4:  room will dump you into the queue and all this stuff. And I'm thinking like

846
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,800
Speaker 4:  everyone in the world, well this will just be an ordinary software

847
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,360
Speaker 4:  experience that I have. Yeah. Or I push a button and something happens and

848
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,960
Speaker 4:  something happens and I push another button and it takes my credit card and

849
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,200
Speaker 4:  I've accomplished my task for the day. Yeah. And I'm looking at my calendar,

850
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,880
Speaker 4:  I'm like, oh this is gonna be weird cuz I'll be on the radio talking about

851
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,680
Speaker 4:  Elon Musk while all of this clicking is occurring. Oh no. And the other

852
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,920
Speaker 4:  guest on NPR at that time is Senator Ed

853
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,760
Speaker 4:  Markey. So it's me, the senator Taylor Swift

854
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,960
Speaker 4:  and Ticketmaster we're all just gonna do this at the same time. And I was

855
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,840
Speaker 4:  like, you know what, whatever it's npr. My mouth can

856
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,390
Speaker 4:  run about Elon and Autopilot. He's a politician. He won't shut up. Like

857
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,960
Speaker 4:  I'll be able to handle this. Yeah.

858
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,720
Speaker 5:  There was also like a 60% chance that Ed Mark was buying Taylor Swift Taylor.

859
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,820
Speaker 5:  Right? Like if you think about that moment, like he for sure had another

860
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,530
Speaker 6:  NPR host also do it.

861
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,040
Speaker 4:  So like everyone, no question. You know, go to buy the tickets.

862
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,000
Speaker 4:  We're all excited cuz I got waitlisted for the right day. There's like

863
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,650
Speaker 4:  a real chance cuz you had to tell 'em what shows you wanted. Yeah.

864
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:07,480
Speaker 5:  Do you know how many layers deep into like weird, insane filters you are

865
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,840
Speaker 5:  right now. Like again, to go back to the Quest thing, we haven't even talked

866
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,430
Speaker 5:  about the buying tickets. This is all like the runup to the buying thing.

867
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,680
Speaker 4:  Like I'm like worried I'm gonna end up getting tickets for their actual

868
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,600
Speaker 4:  graduation. Yeah. And my family is gonna have to make a very important

869
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,340
Speaker 4:  decision.

870
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,560
Speaker 5:  You skip graduation, that's easy. Hundred

871
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,240
Speaker 4:  Percent. We're gonna skip graduate. We we got the right day, the day before

872
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,560
Speaker 4:  graduation. It's all good. So I'm like in line on the phone. I'm like First

873
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,540
Speaker 4:  amendment da stuff,

874
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,590
Speaker 6:  The knee stuff.

875
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,040
Speaker 4:  What you got listed to. I think I did a good job. I don't think you would

876
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,840
Speaker 4:  know that. I was like in a dead flop sweat looking at like Chrome. All this

877
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,240
Speaker 4:  was happening. The thing is just immediately a disaster crashing all over

878
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,040
Speaker 4:  the place, it drops you in the queue. The Q says 2000 plus queue in Chicago

879
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,440
Speaker 4:  does not move for hours. Oh. Meanwhile, all their queues are moving. Other

880
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,630
Speaker 4:  people are getting booted. People are just lying all over the internet. Like,

881
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,560
Speaker 4:  I got in the queue. There's no tickets left. All of you should drop out.

882
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,670
Speaker 4:  Like

883
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,220
Speaker 6:  I would do that.

884
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,160
Speaker 4:  And like various big tech engineers are making chrome extensions to

885
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,850
Speaker 4:  show you your actual place in the queue

886
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,760
Speaker 6:  In like live. Live. That's incredible

887
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,440
Speaker 4:  Because in the, in the page source, there's actually the number of people

888
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,120
Speaker 4:  in front of you. Oh. So like I'm watching ticks of

889
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,480
Speaker 4:  like teenage Taylor Swift fans. It's like, here's what you do. You

890
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:20,940
Speaker 6:  Ed Mark is just,

891
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,620
Speaker 4:  You hit view source, you scroll down to line two 20 of the source code

892
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,430
Speaker 4:  and then it will show you the key of how many people are in front of you.

893
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,880
Speaker 4:  It's using to render the thing. And I'm like doing all this

894
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,360
Speaker 6:  Radio Ed's just over there being like, yeah. Government.

895
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So the queue's not moving. AOCs tweeting, Ticketmaster of

896
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,040
Speaker 4:  Monopoly. This is all bad. Six and a half hours

897
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,180
Speaker 4:  later. The Chicago queue moves.

898
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,240
Speaker 6:  You were on the radio for so long. Long.

899
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I was only radio for now. I canceled like all of my meetings. Like

900
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,990
Speaker 4:  many of my meetings. I have most of my meetings on a Tuesday.

901
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Can't today.

902
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,920
Speaker 4:  And I was just like openly telling people like I'm trying to buy Taylor Swift

903
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,880
Speaker 6:  Tickets and people Yeah.

904
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,800
Speaker 4:  Box media, the company that it is the team that we have. Everyone's like,

905
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,300
Speaker 4:  I understand that's a high priority,

906
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,960
Speaker 5:  But also this was like a, a cultural moment in that way. That it was like

907
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,720
Speaker 5:  everyone could have used that excuse on Tuesday. Right. It's like no matter

908
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,480
Speaker 5:  what you were doing or what your responsibilities were, if you were just

909
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,920
Speaker 5:  like, ah, Taylor Swift tickets, everything would've been like, I understand.

910
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,680
Speaker 5:  Please let me know if I can assist you in any way. Yeah. It's like we were

911
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,960
Speaker 5:  all united in fighting Ticketmaster that day. I

912
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,680
Speaker 6:  Was in more than one meeting where somebody was like, I'm here. I'm paying

913
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,360
Speaker 6:  attention, but I'm also trying to buy Taylor Swift

914
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,400
Speaker 4:  Tickets. Yeah. I was in those

915
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,230
Speaker 5:  All. Yeah. Which means I'm not here and I'm not paying attention.

916
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,240
Speaker 4:  I wasn't at my regular computer. I was at the, cause I was on the radio.

917
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,200
Speaker 4:  I was my podcasting setup. So

918
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,590
Speaker 6:  Like for like 2015,

919
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,260
Speaker 4:  It's just like everything was, I was on my 2015

920
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,130
Speaker 4:  iac. The whole thing is ridiculous

921
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,280
Speaker 4:  to finally come through. It's six o'clock at night, it lets me through and

922
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,390
Speaker 4:  it immediately crashes and puts me back with queue. This happens three times.

923
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,667
Speaker 4:  I would, so now it's 6 45.

924
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:51,160
Speaker 5:  So it gives you the page that it's like you have tickets, do you wanna buy

925
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,440
Speaker 5:  them? And you say yes. And it says, just kidding. Back in

926
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,080
Speaker 4:  Dumps you. So then you finally get it. Oh my God. And it's, it's Ticketmaster.

927
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,760
Speaker 4:  So you're looking at it like a picture of Soldier Field and it's

928
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,590
Speaker 4:  like, and then here's the part that again, I got through, I managed my tickets.

929
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:08,350
Speaker 4:  I feel very lucky. I'm gonna complain about the process of winning.

930
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:09,360
Speaker 4:  Just like, bear with me.

931
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,150
Speaker 6:  It's fine.

932
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:14,120
Speaker 4:  This is the worst fucking video game I have ever played in my entire

933
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,000
Speaker 4:  life. Cuz they're just lighting up seats on

934
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,620
Speaker 4:  a giant picture of Soldier Field and then they're fading out

935
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,930
Speaker 6:  And you have to decide.

936
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,840
Speaker 4:  So you have to, it's like, I need six tickets. I need them all together.

937
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,560
Speaker 4:  There's like clumps of two, two and four everywhere. There's packages. All

938
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,520
Speaker 4:  the tickets are being like bought by the 17,000 other people that are

939
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,340
Speaker 4:  trying to buy tickets. Yeah. And you're like, okay, I'm gonna hit refresh.

940
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,680
Speaker 4:  The sections around where I wanna sit are lit up. I'm gonna double click

941
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,560
Speaker 4:  on those and it's gonna zoom very slowly. And while the

942
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,360
Speaker 4:  zooming is happening, sold out, I'm gonna wash the seats

943
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,240
Speaker 4:  that have been available. Disappear. Mm. So then it was,

944
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,200
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna refresh. Okay. I'm only gonna zoom halfway. Yeah. I have one

945
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,800
Speaker 4:  of those Logitech mice where you can undo the wheel tens and you can smooth

946
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,480
Speaker 4:  scroll. So I, I'm gonna figure out how to roll it exactly

947
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,290
Speaker 4:  halfway. And so I get click targets. They're not huge,

948
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,160
Speaker 4:  they're just some click targets. Yeah. And then I'm gonna try to

949
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,800
Speaker 4:  click six times as fast as I can. When I say it's the worst

950
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,640
Speaker 4:  video game ever made, like I did this for a

951
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,440
Speaker 4:  half an hour. Oh my God. The whole time I was like, this is so stupid. You

952
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,960
Speaker 4:  know, I want six tickets, like dinner's ready. You know how much I'm willing

953
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,110
Speaker 4:  to pay. Just like it's a computer.

954
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,230
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

955
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,960
Speaker 4:  They just,

956
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,830
Speaker 5:  Instead you're playing like scroll wheel arbitrage.

957
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:34,600
Speaker 4:  Just like find six tickets near each other that with

958
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,440
Speaker 4:  this total number. Yeah. And then be like, these are your tickets. And I'd

959
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,360
Speaker 4:  be like, thank you sir. No. And instead it's like, here's what you're gonna

960
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,840
Speaker 4:  do. You're gonna refresh a picture of a stadium. Some parts of the stadium

961
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,730
Speaker 4:  will be blue. You're gonna try to scroll in on the zoom on the blue parts

962
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,560
Speaker 4:  to find little orange circles with stars in them. Then click on six of

963
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,440
Speaker 4:  those. If you don't click on all six at once, someone can take them from

964
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,600
Speaker 4:  you. Then you have to start over half an hour. Get all the way

965
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,360
Speaker 6:  Through. You're not good at

966
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,400
Speaker 5:  This game. This sounds like a Mario Party mini game that I would've like

967
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,560
Speaker 5:  hated on the nten season.

968
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,000
Speaker 4:  It was the worst video game I've ever played. I called my sister in the middle

969
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,440
Speaker 4:  of this and I was like, I'm gonna cry. And she's like, are you in? I'm like,

970
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,320
Speaker 4:  I'm in. But it's worrisome. This isn't even over yet. There's actually,

971
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,160
Speaker 4:  there's one more layer of software chaos. Okay. I get in, I get the six tickets,

972
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,740
Speaker 4:  they're in the cart, they're not all together. I got four and two. Feel great.

973
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,440
Speaker 4:  Hit the button, save payment information. Put in the three

974
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,720
Speaker 4:  digit CVV on the card. Yeah. Doesn't go

975
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,560
Speaker 4:  through. What the fuck? Try it again. Doesn't go through what the

976
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,320
Speaker 4:  fuck. Enter the card over again. Start from scratch, put the card in.

977
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,520
Speaker 4:  Doesn't go through. You've tried to pay with this card too many times. Dumps

978
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,920
Speaker 4:  me back out. This is real thing happened right as it dumps me back out. I

979
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,040
Speaker 4:  get a text message for my credit card fraud alert. Were you trying to hold

980
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,800
Speaker 4:  tickets from ticket? I was like, yes. I literally wrote,

981
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,720
Speaker 4:  yes. Fuck you back. And it was

982
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,880
Speaker 4:  like, go ahead and try again. I was like, no I can't. Did it all again. Play

983
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,080
Speaker 4:  the video game for another four or five minutes. Got the tickets in the end,

984
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,940
Speaker 4:  played the video. I was good at the video game the second time around. Yeah.

985
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,680
Speaker 4:  You know how you're like playing old school Mario and you like, you kinda

986
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,520
Speaker 6:  Suck and then you get

987
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,840
Speaker 4:  Into it, you kind of suck and like, I dunno if this is ever happened to you,

988
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,160
Speaker 4:  it was happening when I was a kid. Like there would be like a power blip

989
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,440
Speaker 4:  or the game would crash right at the end and you're like, I've gotta do it

990
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,360
Speaker 4:  again. And then the second time you'd be really good at it. Yeah. Is that

991
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:15,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

992
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,440
Speaker 6:  Perfect. All intended. Actually, Ticketmaster,

993
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,760
Speaker 4:  That's like finally at seven 30, I played the video games paid with a different

994
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,320
Speaker 4:  credit card. Okay. Sent my sister a Victoria screenshot and she, she called

995
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,840
Speaker 4:  me and she was like, how do you feel? And I was like, I hate you. Like this

996
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,000
Speaker 4:  has been one of the worst days of my

997
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,400
Speaker 5:  Life. That was literally your day. Like that

998
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,730
Speaker 4:  Was what I did that day.

999
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:34,740
Speaker 5:  Oh my God.

1000
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,560
Speaker 4:  Now the parts of this, right? And I've seen other ticket

1001
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,320
Speaker 4:  vendors, like there are ways to do this better,

1002
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,960
Speaker 4:  but it does not create the cultural moments that all the artists

1003
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,840
Speaker 4:  want. Right? You want Ticketmaster to crash. That is a sign of

1004
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,280
Speaker 4:  success. You want there to be more demand than you have sales for.

1005
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,520
Speaker 6:  You want all your customers furious,

1006
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,440
Speaker 4:  Right? You want, you want, in some cases you want the secondary market cuz

1007
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,960
Speaker 4:  Ticketmaster owns the secondary market and they get a cut of all those. I

1008
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,000
Speaker 6:  Mean that was like the whole thing with the PS five in the Xbox Series X.

1009
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,880
Speaker 6:  Where it's like, okay, you want to be in the grind. I don't actually,

1010
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,190
Speaker 6:  I hate the grind.

1011
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:13,960
Speaker 5:  I mostly agree with that premise, but I think it turns on you

1012
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,720
Speaker 5:  eventually. Right? And it's like it has clearly turned on Ticketmaster in

1013
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,000
Speaker 5:  this moment, which we should talk about. But I think one of the interesting

1014
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,650
Speaker 5:  things to me is when people do, and don't get mad

1015
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,400
Speaker 5:  at the artists involved because there have been times where like this just

1016
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,600
Speaker 5:  recently happened with Blink 180 2 where everybody got really mad at Blink

1017
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,800
Speaker 5:  180 2 for charging like many hundreds of dollars for

1018
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,560
Speaker 5:  basically every ticket to everyone of its concerts. And then that

1019
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,480
Speaker 5:  became this whole story about actually how Ticketmaster dynamic pricing works,

1020
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,560
Speaker 5:  which is more like airlines where it's, it's an all about supply and demand

1021
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,320
Speaker 5:  and they essentially surge prices. So know everything is really expensive

1022
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,800
Speaker 5:  so that they get the secondary market out of it. And it's like this whole

1023
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,760
Speaker 5:  system sucks and is opaque and who we decide to be

1024
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,440
Speaker 5:  mad at seems to vary kind of based on the day. And of course Taylor Swift

1025
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,130
Speaker 5:  has never done anything wrong in her life. So we can't be mad Taylor Swift.

1026
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,880
Speaker 4:  So it's starting to come for her, right? People are like, why you, you said

1027
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,430
Speaker 4:  anything? Why mean you apologize? Why? Why are you excusing this

1028
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,320
Speaker 4:  starting to come? But a lot of the early angers pointed Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster

1029
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,200
Speaker 4:  did put out their explainer blog post today. By the way, they canceled the

1030
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,720
Speaker 4:  actual public sale. So they said they sold that. Which is not, I mean

1031
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,880
Speaker 5:  Literally Ticketmaster's whole excuse has been like, did you guys know that

1032
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,360
Speaker 5:  Taylor Swift is this popular? And we're all like, yes, it's Taylor's like,

1033
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,340
Speaker 5:  yeah, it's everything Ticketmaster has said is basically like, we

1034
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,930
Speaker 5:  are bad at our jobs.

1035
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,560
Speaker 4:  So the thing that's really just on the tech

1036
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,960
Speaker 4:  level. So their whole thing was they were overwhelmed by demand. As they

1037
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,720
Speaker 4:  was saying, they're expecting 1.5 million verified presale

1038
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,560
Speaker 4:  people. They 14 million people show up and they got three and a half billion

1039
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,400
Speaker 4:  requests. Okay. I believe you that that is

1040
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,840
Speaker 4:  a crazy numbers more than you thought.

1041
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,600
Speaker 5:  But that's also, even that itself is, is a technological failure on Ticketmaster's

1042
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,640
Speaker 5:  part. Right? The fact that 14 million people needed to generate three and

1043
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,960
Speaker 5:  a half billion requests to their servers to buy tickets is already a failure

1044
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,260
Speaker 5:  of Ticketmaster's technology.

1045
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,840
Speaker 4:  And there's like some bots there, but it's like, you know how many

1046
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,440
Speaker 4:  people, because of how this all this whole system worked

1047
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,560
Speaker 4:  where you have to be a verified fan and some people were on a wait list and

1048
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,440
Speaker 4:  some people weren't. You know, the total number of people who are

1049
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,280
Speaker 4:  eligible to buy tickets, those people should go into

1050
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,020
Speaker 4:  a system that can manage that demand. And then

1051
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,680
Speaker 4:  the other 12 and a half million people in

1052
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,660
Speaker 4:  bots can go to a YouTube video or like whatever.

1053
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,640
Speaker 4:  You can just send them somewhere else. That's the thing that does not

1054
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,400
Speaker 4:  add up in this explanation, in this blog post and all these other things

1055
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,320
Speaker 4:  they've said is somehow, even though we

1056
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,160
Speaker 4:  were in control of gating this demand, we let through these other

1057
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,760
Speaker 4:  12 and a half million people in bots who generated three and a half million

1058
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,620
Speaker 4:  requests and then we sold out of tickets

1059
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,560
Speaker 6:  And the other 2 million verified fans including your

1060
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,400
Speaker 6:  sister on a wait list. On a wait list. So they didn't even like, so there's

1061
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,080
Speaker 6:  like 14 million people being like, I'm gonna get in your sister's. Like I

1062
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,320
Speaker 6:  can't.

1063
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. There's just a procedural step here that doesn't add up.

1064
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,360
Speaker 4:  That's like you are not in control of your software and then you can zoom

1065
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,320
Speaker 4:  that out. Right. So Ticketmasters owned by Live Nation actually the

1066
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,040
Speaker 4:  chain of corporate ownership here is great Ticketmasters owned by Live Nation.

1067
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,600
Speaker 4:  Okay. Which is Live Nation is the big concert promoter. They own a lot of

1068
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,460
Speaker 4:  venues. They bought Ticketmaster in a deal that many people including AOC

1069
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,920
Speaker 4:  and your friendly local podcast. So think should not have gone through because

1070
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,840
Speaker 4:  of clear vertical merger. Now the now if

1071
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,720
Speaker 4:  you want to play, if you're an artist, you wanna play in a city, you have

1072
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,960
Speaker 4:  to like go deal with the mob. Yeah. Like they own the venues, they own the

1073
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,600
Speaker 4:  ticketing. You're paying some money to this corporation. Totally

1074
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:39,760
Speaker 6:  Vertically

1075
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,720
Speaker 5:  Clear. They also Live Nation also manages a lot of artists like

1076
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,320
Speaker 4:  Directly. Yeah. So we have 360, it's even

1077
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,850
Speaker 5:  More like literally from from the building down to the person

1078
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:50,600
Speaker 5:  working the building. They own every single part of the whole

1079
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,210
Speaker 4:  Stack. 30% of Live Nation is owned by Liberty Media, which also owns

1080
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:58,160
Speaker 4:  f1, which is great. Cool. I mean Liberty,

1081
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,430
Speaker 4:  Liberty is a huge investor in Warner Brothers Discovery. It's just like,

1082
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:05,200
Speaker 4:  it's just a big consolidated situation. Yeah. That's not to say that

1083
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,560
Speaker 4:  Liberty CEO John alone is not kind of like a straight shoot and genius. He's

1084
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,160
Speaker 4:  like, here's what I do. I buy everything and then I make money. I appreciate

1085
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,720
Speaker 4:  that about him. But it's just this big stack of consolidation. Yeah. Taylor

1086
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,560
Speaker 4:  Swift, not Live Nation artist Taylor Swift's tour is run

1087
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,520
Speaker 4:  by aeg, which is the only, the other big monopoly they put on Coachella and

1088
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,840
Speaker 4:  all this other stuff. And so Ticketmasters defenses, you all think we're

1089
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,360
Speaker 4:  Monopoly, but even AEG chose Ticketmaster. Cause

1090
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,880
Speaker 6:  You're all that

1091
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,770
Speaker 4:  Exist can do it. And it's like Yeah, because anyone else who tries

1092
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:37,440
Speaker 4:  is crushed by your monopoly. Yeah. Like that's the actual problem

1093
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,280
Speaker 4:  here. No other ticket vendor can reach scale because they can't go

1094
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,760
Speaker 4:  to Live Nation venues and they can't service Live Nation

1095
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,640
Speaker 4:  artists. So everyone else is small. So when an artist at the scale of

1096
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,440
Speaker 4:  Taylor Swift has to go buy this service, her

1097
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,000
Speaker 4:  options on the market are risk it with companies that cannot operate at the

1098
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,650
Speaker 4:  scale. Yeah.

1099
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,360
Speaker 6:  Or you Bob's ticket sales.

1100
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,840
Speaker 4:  Right? It's like if your choice was AWS or your Plex

1101
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,150
Speaker 4:  server, like those are Taylor's choices.

1102
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,680
Speaker 6:  Come on Taylor, it's gonna be

1103
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,400
Speaker 4:  Great. And like that's like the fundamental thing that people are talking

1104
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,940
Speaker 4:  about here is because Live Nation owns Ticketmaster, no other ticketing service

1105
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,560
Speaker 4:  can address those venues and achieve the appropriate scale. And Ticketmaster

1106
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,310
Speaker 4:  is monopoly and they can concoct these like

1107
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,280
Speaker 4:  ultimately unsatisfying explanations and that's all you

1108
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:25,480
Speaker 4:  can do.

1109
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,320
Speaker 6:  Well I think it's more than that too. It's also they don't have

1110
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,980
Speaker 6:  to do a good job. They never have to do a good job

1111
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:36,800
Speaker 6:  and they never have done a good job. Name. A time where Ticketmaster like

1112
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,630
Speaker 6:  using Ticketmaster was a pleasant experience.

1113
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:42,320
Speaker 4:  Okay. 1987. Were you high when I bought the

1114
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,120
Speaker 4:  tickets from the back room of the Kohl's department store, which

1115
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,160
Speaker 4:  had the Ticketmaster

1116
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,240
Speaker 6:  Computer. That was, that was

1117
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,310
Speaker 4:  It. That was it.

1118
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And then that

1119
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,560
Speaker 4:  Was like a real thing. That was their, by the way that was innovation was

1120
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,120
Speaker 4:  they put computers in like department stores around the country on

1121
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:57,610
Speaker 4:  a

1122
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:58,720
Speaker 6:  Proprie to

1123
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,580
Speaker 4:  Master network.

1124
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,440
Speaker 6:  You had to go to the stadium where it, it's being sold. And my sister

1125
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,280
Speaker 6:  would do this like stand outside and wait a day or two in

1126
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,840
Speaker 6:  advance and go through and do it. Kinda like when you go to buy a ps Yes.

1127
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,950
Speaker 6:  Three.

1128
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,080
Speaker 4:  Alex, are you just explaining how buying tickets

1129
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,510
Speaker 6:  Works? You know what that's happening right now? We have young audience.

1130
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:21,520
Speaker 6:  I appreciate that. We had like they're young verge vergecast people who are

1131
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,040
Speaker 6:  like, what was it like before Papa?

1132
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,760
Speaker 4:  Let's just zoom back. So the movie days are confused like a huge

1133
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,990
Speaker 4:  plot. Like the plot of this movie is the next day they're gonna go buy tickets.

1134
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

1135
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,760
Speaker 4:  That is true. Yeah. It's, you don't think that that's the plot of the movie.

1136
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,000
Speaker 4:  That's the plot of the movie, which is, is that they have to make it through

1137
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,240
Speaker 4:  the night and not be so stoned they can't go buy tickets.

1138
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,840
Speaker 6:  Which would be more fun getting really stone and

1139
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,400
Speaker 6:  barely making it in time to buy your tickets by lining up or what You

1140
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,020
Speaker 6:  did

1141
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,780
Speaker 4:  The worst video game in American history. I'm gonna go with the other thing.

1142
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,640
Speaker 4:  The movies seem bad, but, so there's like this middle ground. Yeah. This

1143
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,380
Speaker 4:  is what I'm saying. There's a middle ground of you have to physically go

1144
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:01,200
Speaker 4:  and buy tickets in the seventies with your friends. Yeah. Great. You

1145
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,520
Speaker 4:  can

1146
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,120
Speaker 6:  Do the computer and Kohl's,

1147
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,840
Speaker 4:  Matthew McConaughey is there, right? Yeah. Then there's the eighties in

1148
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,320
Speaker 4:  early nineties where Ticketmaster is like, here's what we're gonna do.

1149
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,240
Speaker 4:  Sears is gonna sign up for a phone line. We're gonna give them a

1150
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,160
Speaker 4:  20 BOD modem and a weird mainframe and train someone

1151
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,920
Speaker 4:  to use it. And we're gonna consolidate ticketing on our, our client

1152
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,120
Speaker 4:  server system. Yeah. This is legitimately the

1153
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,680
Speaker 4:  Ticketmaster innovation. Right? They like built a weird

1154
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:32,320
Speaker 4:  network on the phone lines, which by the way, the government broke up at

1155
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,960
Speaker 4:  and t and required the phone companies to allow things to connect to their

1156
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,600
Speaker 4:  phone lines. Just a side note, Carter phone decision, we think about it a

1157
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,400
Speaker 4:  lot here at the Vercast enabled Ticketmaster to exist. Then they moved

1158
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,200
Speaker 4:  that onto the internet, got rid of the, the checkout staff at Kohl's department

1159
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:45,440
Speaker 4:  store

1160
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,240
Speaker 6:  Don't need

1161
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,560
Speaker 4:  'em. And they're like, you're gonna do it

1162
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,170
Speaker 6:  Yourself Self checkout. Yes.

1163
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:52,920
Speaker 4:  So the the thing they're doing is still this network, it just, you're doing

1164
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,480
Speaker 4:  self checkout

1165
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,040
Speaker 6:  And it

1166
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,520
Speaker 4:  Sucks and it sucks. But they own, they still own the network. They still

1167
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,160
Speaker 4:  control the venues and now they control the artists. And you would think

1168
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,720
Speaker 4:  that any big company, the number of tweets I saw, our friend Mark has

1169
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,480
Speaker 4:  tweeted Taylor should just start her own ticketing company. It's like,

1170
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,480
Speaker 4:  yeah, now you're all the way at the point where it's like, oh, I could just

1171
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,240
Speaker 4:  set up a server and

1172
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,640
Speaker 6:  Run tickets. Oh, you get your PL server. Yeah. You also does tickets. Now

1173
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,080
Speaker 4:  Here's, I don't know if you know this, an Invidia Shield, a single Invidia

1174
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,920
Speaker 4:  shield can run all of Ticketmaster. It's true. Right? But what you

1175
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,640
Speaker 4:  don't have is the, the four decades of venue contracts that you

1176
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,400
Speaker 4:  need and four decades of being mobbed up in the music industry and then being

1177
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,200
Speaker 4:  owned by Live Nation and then being owned by like on and on and on. So at

1178
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,440
Speaker 4:  the end of the day, it's not, the technology has been commodified out, even

1179
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,920
Speaker 4:  though that was a thing that enabled the business in the eighties. Now it's

1180
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,160
Speaker 4:  just a bunch of contracts that you can't break through. Right.

1181
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,840
Speaker 5:  We've talked, there are plenty of other ticketing platforms on the internet.

1182
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,240
Speaker 5:  Like if, if you just wanna sell, like Taylor Swift could have gone to Event

1183
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,040
Speaker 5:  Bright and been like, Hey, I'm gonna sell all my tickets through Event Bright.

1184
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,200
Speaker 5:  Right. Like there's a million of these out there. It's just that none of

1185
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,960
Speaker 5:  them can sell interesting tickets because of this actual monopoly that

1186
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,040
Speaker 5:  exists. Right. It's like the only way to take down Ticketmaster is to build

1187
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,120
Speaker 5:  a bunch of concert venues. Yeah. Like that's literally what

1188
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,720
Speaker 4:  It's, and to sign Jays into a 360 deal. Right,

1189
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,480
Speaker 5:  Exactly. And easy. Yeah. And so it's like you just, you can't,

1190
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,360
Speaker 5:  you can't beat Ticketmaster without essentially taking on the entire live

1191
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,960
Speaker 5:  music industry, which no one is able to do because

1192
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,050
Speaker 5:  it's impossible at this moment in time.

1193
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,000
Speaker 4:  We have a grand ideas for how to make a combination YouTube video deco

1194
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,440
Speaker 4:  episode about this. So I'm gonna put a pin in this. We'll go back to it.

1195
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,520
Speaker 4:  There's a great John Oliver segment about this. Also, you could just go back

1196
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,600
Speaker 4:  to the nineties and watch Pearl Jam testify to Congress about the Ticketmaster

1197
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,440
Speaker 4:  monopoly. That's a real thing you can do with your time while you're waiting

1198
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,480
Speaker 4:  for your dealership tickets to No,

1199
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,280
Speaker 5:  They're sold out. That's the video that Ticketmaster should have sent the

1200
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,900
Speaker 5:  other 12 and a half million people to. That would've been a cool move.

1201
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,480
Speaker 4:  All right. Let's quickly talk about Elon then. We'll take a break and we'll

1202
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,120
Speaker 4:  we'll do a gadget. Sounds good. We'll do a gadget lightning round. Elon David,

1203
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,010
Speaker 4:  what's going on?

1204
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:55,850
Speaker 5:  So we're kind of out of the like brief,

1205
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:59,280
Speaker 5:  bonkers, chaotic product phase and into the,

1206
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,200
Speaker 5:  like Elon Musk blows up the org chart phase I would say. So I

1207
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,500
Speaker 5:  think right around now as we're recording, this is the

1208
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,280
Speaker 5:  set deadline for all Twitter employees to literally fill out a

1209
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,840
Speaker 5:  form on the internet as far as I can tell that says either I am

1210
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,640
Speaker 5:  committed to being, what was the, what was the quote? Extremely

1211
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,410
Speaker 5:  hardcore in building the next phase of Twitter.

1212
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:25,400
Speaker 5:  Or if you check yes, welcome to you know, hardcore Twitter if

1213
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,080
Speaker 5:  you check. No, that is, you have resigned from the company. This

1214
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,240
Speaker 5:  cannot possibly be legal. I am not a lawyer. I don't know anything this,

1215
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,640
Speaker 5:  there's just no way that this is how any of this actually works. But, so

1216
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,120
Speaker 5:  that's happening. He's like, he's very clearly trying to weed a lot of people

1217
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,560
Speaker 5:  out of the company as fast as he possibly could, right? Yes. He's been firing

1218
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,560
Speaker 5:  anyone who criticized him on Twitter. He's been firing people who criticized

1219
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,400
Speaker 5:  him in Slack. He is out there saying he doesn't wanna be the CEO of

1220
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,400
Speaker 5:  Twitter or any company, which is something he said before. I think he said

1221
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,280
Speaker 5:  that during a deposition about Tesla. And so he's just now at this place

1222
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,880
Speaker 5:  where he's like, okay Twitter blue. We rolled it out, it went horribly.

1223
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,647
Speaker 5:  We're we're rolling it back. That's now set to come out November 29th.

1224
01:05:02,647 --> 01:05:06,270
Speaker 5:  And it's, it's very clear that he is in full like

1225
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,880
Speaker 5:  burn Twitter the company to the ground and build it back up

1226
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,880
Speaker 5:  face. And whether that's gonna be possible I think is the next thing to see.

1227
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,560
Speaker 5:  But like that's the distinct vibe I get is that he's really, really hoping

1228
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,440
Speaker 5:  a lot of people check no on that box tonight. Right.

1229
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,000
Speaker 4:  Except too many people check. No already. Here's a problem. This, this is

1230
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,200
Speaker 4:  happening while we've been recording. Oh wow. So the deadline is arriving.

1231
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,720
Speaker 4:  There's a newsletter called the Pragmatic Engineer that's been reporting

1232
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,760
Speaker 4:  on this that authorized Twitter account and he's been putting a lot of stuff

1233
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,680
Speaker 4:  there. Basically like teams of 50 40 people are like,

1234
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,070
Speaker 4:  I'll quit. So Elon is now holding

1235
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:41,840
Speaker 4:  meetings where he is like it gets severance cause he

1236
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,830
Speaker 4:  gets severance. Although the terms of the severance agreement are not,

1237
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:49,200
Speaker 4:  they haven't been released. So you have to basically say I leave agree to

1238
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,430
Speaker 4:  a contract that I haven't read, which is

1239
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,960
Speaker 6:  I wouldn't

1240
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,760
Speaker 4:  Do that, I wouldn't do that. They're already being sued over that. It's like

1241
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,830
Speaker 4:  the lawsuit got filed while we were talking,

1242
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:00,520
Speaker 5:  When he fired half the company two weeks ago, he promised severance that

1243
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,280
Speaker 5:  at least as far as we've heard so far, has not yet materialized. So I think

1244
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,960
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of reason to believe this is not up enough.

1245
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,680
Speaker 4:  Right. So he is, he's already in labor lawsuit number one. But then too many

1246
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,920
Speaker 4:  people are leaving. So he is asking to come back. He's already relaxed his

1247
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,440
Speaker 4:  work from home rules. So initially he said you can either

1248
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,860
Speaker 4:  work in this office or it's resignation accepted,

1249
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,960
Speaker 6:  Got a lawsuit for that one,

1250
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,880
Speaker 4:  Got a lawsuit for that one. Cause you have to have an office that's

1251
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,060
Speaker 4:  inclusive and you have to make accessible

1252
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,190
Speaker 6:  Accommodations for people who need it. And he's not,

1253
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:32,780
Speaker 4:  Alex is a person who handles all this stuff on the ver

1254
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,720
Speaker 4:  Can you tell the managing editor is a good manager?

1255
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,840
Speaker 6:  Sorry,

1256
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,000
Speaker 4:  There was a time when I knew this stuff, but now you don't have to

1257
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,960
Speaker 4:  everybody it's great. Highly committed. He

1258
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,240
Speaker 4:  hasn't made reasonable accommodations for people. He's relaxed the work from

1259
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,200
Speaker 4:  home rules into this sort of ran

1260
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,920
Speaker 4:  situation. Yeah. Where if your

1261
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,380
Speaker 4:  manager vouches for you that you, you're

1262
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,800
Speaker 4:  extraordinary, then you can work from home. He's cool man. And if they're

1263
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,650
Speaker 4:  wrong, they're fired. And it's like, I would not

1264
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,190
Speaker 4:  do that.

1265
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,150
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1266
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:09,780
Speaker 4:  It's just another bet I wouldn't make. Cuz who knows what the criteria

1267
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,950
Speaker 4:  are and whether they will change.

1268
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:14,910
Speaker 6:  What is the definition of cool man?

1269
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:18,120
Speaker 4:  It's like also you've already fired half of

1270
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,920
Speaker 4:  everyone. Why would I be like they're great. I'm putting my job

1271
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,360
Speaker 4:  on the line for it when no one knows how you make decisions. Yeah. That's

1272
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,120
Speaker 4:  another lawsuit that's waiting to come. And so he is having an all hands,

1273
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,450
Speaker 4:  I believe right now the reason Alex Heath is not with us on this episode

1274
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:34,520
Speaker 4:  is because there's an all hands happening while we record. Where he is basically

1275
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,440
Speaker 4:  saying, please stay at Twitter. Even though I have asked most of you to leave

1276
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,800
Speaker 4:  if you're not hardcore enough. Is that about the summary of

1277
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,640
Speaker 5:  It? Yeah, that's about right. And this is, this is perfectly in keeping with

1278
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,440
Speaker 5:  what the last several weeks have been like. Right? It's just like all the

1279
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,280
Speaker 5:  Elon Musk era of Twitter has been, is just whipsawing back and forth between

1280
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,960
Speaker 5:  these like grand proclamations and really quick shipping of something. Oh

1281
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,720
Speaker 5:  God, that didn't work. We have to undo that. And then like 15 minutes

1282
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,480
Speaker 5:  later some crazy grand proclamation slash new feature in a different direction.

1283
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,920
Speaker 5:  Like this is what Blue was, this is what verification was. Remember the official

1284
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,520
Speaker 5:  badge that was there and gone and there and gone and there and now I think

1285
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:08,960
Speaker 5:  it's gone again.

1286
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,040
Speaker 4:  The verge keeps getting the official badge and it keeps going away.

1287
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,120
Speaker 5:  Like over and over. This keeps happening. It's like it, it honestly, honestly

1288
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,840
Speaker 5:  is like the, the company is just absolutely spinning out of

1289
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:22,680
Speaker 5:  control in all directions at all times now. And there has

1290
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:26,360
Speaker 5:  been a lot of people saying essentially that this is on purpose.

1291
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,440
Speaker 5:  That this is how you do a cultural reset and that he's trying to blow up

1292
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,160
Speaker 5:  the company. And you've gotta figure that there's gonna come a time where

1293
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,640
Speaker 5:  he looks around and goes, oh God, I need some employees. I keep thinking

1294
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,680
Speaker 5:  about the thing he says about WhatsApp, right? Where he's like, WhatsApp

1295
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,400
Speaker 5:  got to 2 billion users with 50 engineers. Like does he just want 50 people

1296
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,760
Speaker 5:  to work at Twitter? Cause like he's well on the way to that,

1297
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think that's, that's the entire thing. You know, a lot of people

1298
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,240
Speaker 6:  have been saying, oh he's gonna blow it up because he wants to blow up Twitter

1299
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,880
Speaker 6:  because he's mad because he had to pay 54 or 20 a share for that. I

1300
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
Speaker 5:  Don't believe in that for that. And I don't think that at all. I think the

1301
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,200
Speaker 5:  idea that he's gonna destroy it out of spite I think is wrong. I

1302
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,520
Speaker 6:  Just don't know that. Yeah. I think he is aggressively saying like, think

1303
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,720
Speaker 6:  about it, his companies, he maybe didn't create those

1304
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,640
Speaker 6:  companies. SpaceX and, and Tesla, even though he is

1305
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,360
Speaker 6:  technically a founder, he didn't create those companies, but he created the

1306
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:14,310
Speaker 6:  culture there and he created a culture that is very like, we work hard.

1307
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:18,240
Speaker 6:  That's it. We just work hard. We go as hard as we can. Sometimes

1308
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,150
Speaker 6:  sexual harassment happens and that is the price we pay for doing really cool

1309
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:26,040
Speaker 6:  rocket ships and stuff. And Twitter is from a very different culture

1310
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:30,000
Speaker 6:  of like, we care about our employees. We believe in work life balance. We

1311
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,790
Speaker 6:  believe that like people shouldn't die just to make a weird app on the internet.

1312
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:37,760
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And, and so he has to reset that culture and he can either

1313
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,520
Speaker 6:  do that like the slow and gentle long term way, which would take years. Or

1314
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,360
Speaker 6:  he can be like, everybody get out and I'm gonna take the wreckage. I'm gonna

1315
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,460
Speaker 6:  save a bunch of money because I'm not having to pay all of these people.

1316
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,150
Speaker 6:  And if I can weather the storm of the shit show that I've created,

1317
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,840
Speaker 6:  then on the other side of this, I'm gonna be fine. And it seems very clear

1318
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,480
Speaker 6:  that that's the decision he's made, even though it's a bad

1319
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,030
Speaker 6:  one. Gross.

1320
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:02,880
Speaker 5:  I agree a hundred percent. And I think the thing that he's doing is

1321
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,160
Speaker 5:  thinking that that, that Twitter is the same as Tesla and SpaceX. Right?

1322
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,080
Speaker 5:  And this has been sort of talked about to death that like, you know, oh he

1323
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,800
Speaker 5:  runs Tesla and SpaceX, he must know how to run Twitter. Why are all of you

1324
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,720
Speaker 5:  people on Twitter mad at this? And I think like what, what seems

1325
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,620
Speaker 5:  to be true is that working at Tesla and SpaceX like largely sucks.

1326
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:24,440
Speaker 5:  But there are a lot of people who work there believing that it is in service

1327
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,000
Speaker 5:  of something really good, right? Like we are, we are either going to space

1328
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,520
Speaker 5:  or we are like saving the planet. Like,

1329
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,370
Speaker 6:  Or we really like Elon Musk, like the entire point of a Tesla AI day

1330
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:36,120
Speaker 6:  is to like inoculate people get there. Or not inoculate, but I

1331
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:40,110
Speaker 6:  wish, but like, like bring them in.

1332
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:43,320
Speaker 4:  It's like everyone gears a here's a guy in a

1333
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,700
Speaker 4:  suit, everyone's got an mr a shot.

1334
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,600
Speaker 6:  But it is about like making, like finding these people who

1335
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,600
Speaker 6:  will put up with all of his, his bullshit, who will see a dude in a suit

1336
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,060
Speaker 6:  dressed as a robot and be like, that's the future. I indoct

1337
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:01,040
Speaker 6:  indoctrinate. There's a word. That's the one I meant to say. But so

1338
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,480
Speaker 6:  he, he really is out. Like Tesla AI day is there to indoctrinate these

1339
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,260
Speaker 6:  people and Totally. And he's gotta do that at Twitter now.

1340
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,360
Speaker 6:  And that's like, that's kind of his plan. He's like, I'm gonna get out everybody

1341
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,720
Speaker 6:  who doesn't wanna be a part of my vision. Who

1342
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,560
Speaker 4:  Doesn't? Well so here the problem is that his vision does not

1343
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,560
Speaker 4:  make any sense and is actually not really well articulated.

1344
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,360
Speaker 6:  Well cuz his vision is what Elon wants. Elon gets.

1345
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,730
Speaker 6:  That's the vision. He's really out there saying, do you wanna be a part of

1346
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:31,170
Speaker 6:  an Elon Musk enterprise? If not, get out.

1347
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:34,920
Speaker 4:  No, I'll be more charitable. And I've been very rude to Elon on Twitter because

1348
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,320
Speaker 4:  I know that he's reading all the tweets and that he reads the virtual every

1349
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,680
Speaker 4:  day. It's great when you know that you have that feedback loop in your life.

1350
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,610
Speaker 4:  Yes. With SpaceX and with Tesla, the vision

1351
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:47,320
Speaker 4:  is crystal clear. The steps to the vision are

1352
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:51,150
Speaker 4:  obvious and the challenges are crystalline. Right?

1353
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:55,080
Speaker 4:  SpaceX is, we want humanity to be an interplanetary species. I

1354
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,760
Speaker 4:  need to put people on Mars to get there. We have to launch rockets and land

1355
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,940
Speaker 4:  them because the first problem is cutting the cost of a launch down. Right?

1356
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:04,400
Speaker 4:  And they went and they solved the first engineering problem, which is launch

1357
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,560
Speaker 4:  the rockets, land them, make the rockets reusable. Very impressive. Very

1358
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:11,200
Speaker 4:  impressive. But like, there's a big goal, right? There's all the goals

1359
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,000
Speaker 4:  underneath it and then there's the first goal, which is land the rocket stage

1360
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,680
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And reuse it to lower the cost of getting to orbit. And they went and

1361
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,520
Speaker 4:  accomplished that and that and then that one in the market as it should

1362
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,320
Speaker 4:  have. Yeah. Now our rocket launches are cheaper than everyone else's, where

1363
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,160
Speaker 4:  the market leader, let's go, we win. Right? Okay. Then we are then, then

1364
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,040
Speaker 4:  his goals are like hilarious. Like space suits look cool. So

1365
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,720
Speaker 4:  kids want to go to space. Like this is a thing he said, I thought it was

1366
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,320
Speaker 4:  like one of the rast things he's ever said. Yeah. Right. They, it should

1367
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,160
Speaker 4:  look cool. It should be inspiring and awesome. Okay. We're gonna totally

1368
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,960
Speaker 4:  computerize the capsule so that when we send astronauts to iss, they're not

1369
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,600
Speaker 4:  really doing anything. They're just looking at screens. Cause computers are

1370
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,400
Speaker 4:  better at this. They did it. Yeah. Okay. So like you see like they're solving

1371
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,050
Speaker 4:  these really hard engineering challenges that are all baby steps

1372
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:01,960
Speaker 4:  to the big goal. Yes. Tesla I think is the same way, right? We want to reduce

1373
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,360
Speaker 4:  the amount of emissions on the planet. Everybody who works on

1374
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,320
Speaker 4:  autonomous driving knows that computers are better drivers than people. You

1375
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:12,920
Speaker 4:  want to decrease the rate of fatalities. You can argue about whether that

1376
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,640
Speaker 4:  will ever come true. You know, but it's a noble, it's

1377
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,000
Speaker 4:  more challenging AI problem in almost anything. We're, I would say we're

1378
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,760
Speaker 4:  not much farther along the autonomous driving curve than we were five years

1379
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,230
Speaker 4:  ago.

1380
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:27,800
Speaker 5:  Well, and that's actually a, a good like counterexample of what you're talking

1381
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,920
Speaker 5:  about, right? Where like, I would actually argue that Tesla's vision for

1382
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,740
Speaker 5:  self-driving is incredibly like murky and unclear

1383
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:38,680
Speaker 5:  and in the way that it's vision for like, you know,

1384
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,600
Speaker 5:  curving emissions and electrifying the entire vehicle industry is

1385
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,800
Speaker 5:  like crystal clear. And to your point, it's like it has steps towards it

1386
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,200
Speaker 5:  and we kind of know what the end game looks like. Self-driving is just this

1387
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,800
Speaker 5:  like messy thing that nobody kind of knows what it's gonna be at the end.

1388
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,470
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's proving so much harder to do. And so even Elon's vision,

1389
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:58,080
Speaker 4:  some of his pronouncements have assumed that he will solve

1390
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,040
Speaker 4:  this hardest of all engineering problems. Yeah. We'll have robo, we'll

1391
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,000
Speaker 4:  have a million robo taxis in a year is a thing that he has said on

1392
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,120
Speaker 4:  the assumption that they will solve self-driving. Right. And so they just

1393
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,520
Speaker 4:  have to keep doing it. But like he assumes he will solve the engineering

1394
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,160
Speaker 4:  problems and he won't do a thing. The problem with Twitter is even the big

1395
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:19,120
Speaker 4:  pronouncements, the pronouncements at the level of we will go to Mars or

1396
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,080
Speaker 4:  we will have a million robo taxis in a year or whatever it is. His big pronouncements

1397
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,400
Speaker 4:  are like shit the Online News Association was talking about in

1398
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,440
Speaker 4:  2007. Yep. Bloggers will compete with

1399
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,400
Speaker 4:  journalists, citizens will make the news. Yeah.

1400
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,240
Speaker 6:  He was treating a lot about

1401
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,800
Speaker 4:  That. We will, we will crowdsource truth. And it's like you guys, like I

1402
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,760
Speaker 4:  live through this, it was boring the first time. Like do you

1403
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,200
Speaker 4:  wanna, can I just like do a search about bloggers versus journalists and

1404
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,640
Speaker 4:  show you some crap from 2001? Like we did this

1405
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:51,520
Speaker 4:  already and we know what it looks like. And it is true that social

1406
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,170
Speaker 4:  media has like changed the dynamics of the news and like,

1407
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:59,160
Speaker 4:  my God man, like we cannot do like the

1408
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,040
Speaker 4:  best journalists, the most relevant journalists you can think of all came

1409
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,020
Speaker 4:  up as hardcore bloggers and social media personnel. Like down the line,

1410
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:10,880
Speaker 4:  you pick a field in journalism and you're like, who's at the top? And it's

1411
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,420
Speaker 4:  like that person had a blog spot Yeah. And they blogged their face

1412
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:18,360
Speaker 4:  off. That's where we all came. Like it's just true. Like

1413
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,180
Speaker 4:  the thing that he is describing is happening on Twitter already happened.

1414
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:26,080
Speaker 4:  Yep. It happened at scale. It reorganized the shape

1415
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:26,790
Speaker 4:  of the world.

1416
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:29,040
Speaker 6:  It's happening as we speak sometimes

1417
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,800
Speaker 4:  It's happening on TikTok right now. So you just, you, you can't get to this

1418
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,480
Speaker 4:  vision without a engaging with the fact that the

1419
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,200
Speaker 4:  conversation's already like been had at massive scale with,

1420
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,830
Speaker 4:  in a way that reorganized the shape of the culture.

1421
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:47,280
Speaker 4:  Like black Twitter exists. Do you guys remember we spent like a several years

1422
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:51,200
Speaker 4:  of our life just talking about the words on Freak. Yes. And who should get

1423
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,680
Speaker 4:  paid for the words on that's Twitter, that's black Twitter creating

1424
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:58,420
Speaker 4:  culture Yep. And having it cycled out into the mainstream.

1425
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:02,280
Speaker 4:  And there was, I mean to this day I think there's a reasonable discussion

1426
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,080
Speaker 4:  and debate over where the money should flow that

1427
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,360
Speaker 4:  cycled into TikTok dance. It's like, we've just done this a thousand

1428
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,200
Speaker 4:  times. Ferguson is a, Casey new

1429
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,080
Speaker 4:  and I both have t-shirts that Jack Dorsey Andreessen gave

1430
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,040
Speaker 4:  us after Ferguson after black Twitter, like

1431
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,160
Speaker 4:  used Ferguson to create awareness of police

1432
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,960
Speaker 4:  brutality. They handed us t-shirts at a conference that said stay woke with

1433
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,520
Speaker 4:  a Twitter bird on them. I can't find mine. I know Casey. Like we did

1434
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,460
Speaker 4:  this already. Yeah. And you cannot destroy a company

1435
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,960
Speaker 4:  and say, my vision is what this company was already doing.

1436
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,730
Speaker 4:  Right. You have to engage the very squishy

1437
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:46,560
Speaker 4:  problem of what do you mean by a town square? A digital town square?

1438
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:46,960
Speaker 4:  You have

1439
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,000
Speaker 6:  To engage with reality.

1440
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,600
Speaker 4:  Right. It's it, and I just think like, yeah, maybe he's got a vision for

1441
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,400
Speaker 4:  Tesla that you can understand. And I think that's a great vision. And I

1442
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,240
Speaker 4:  honestly think SpaceX is the more impressive company because the challenge

1443
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,200
Speaker 4:  was harder. And the the idea that you could actually

1444
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,080
Speaker 4:  reinvent a government run business in a

1445
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,160
Speaker 4:  market driven, like that's

1446
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,160
Speaker 6:  So cool. And notably he, he doesn't run that the day to

1447
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,560
Speaker 4:  Day there. Gwen Shotwell runs that company. Yeah. Although SpaceX got sued

1448
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,280
Speaker 4:  today by a number, by nine employees. We, this is

1449
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,880
Speaker 4:  following on a great piece that Lauren GREs for us. They wrote several employees

1450
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,040
Speaker 4:  at SpaceX wrote a letter saying this company basically tolerates sexual harassment.

1451
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,080
Speaker 4:  Yep. They all got fired. They were dragged into a meeting where they were

1452
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:30,480
Speaker 4:  told this is Elon's company. Either you're with Elon or against him Yep.

1453
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,160
Speaker 4:  To file a lawsuit. So even SpaceX, someone insulated from the chaos

1454
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,800
Speaker 4:  because of the person of Gwen Shotwell, maybe not so insulated. Yeah. I just

1455
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,440
Speaker 4:  think there's no vision for Twitter, so you cannot blow up the

1456
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:45,240
Speaker 4:  company. Right. And say, I've got a vision and it's these

1457
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,340
Speaker 4:  platitudes that are like 2001,

1458
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:52,080
Speaker 4:  2003 level. What does it mean for journalists to use

1459
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,960
Speaker 4:  the internet platitudes? Because obviously we're all just gonna

1460
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,540
Speaker 4:  dunk in you all day at night.

1461
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:01,440
Speaker 5:  But that's the thing. It's like, it, it would be one thing if he was basically

1462
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,120
Speaker 5:  trying to recreate Twitter from the ground up, which would be like a very

1463
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,040
Speaker 5:  funny outcome because he is, he's tweeting all the things. Like I'm just

1464
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,320
Speaker 5:  looking at his Twitter now. His most recent tweet says Twitter is like open

1465
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:15,040
Speaker 5:  sourcing the news. Which like, I guarantee Jack Dorsey has tweeted at some

1466
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,680
Speaker 5:  point in the mid two thousands. I guarantee it. Dude,

1467
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:21,280
Speaker 4:  Do you remember when Reddit tried to figure out who the Boston Marathon bombers

1468
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,160
Speaker 4:  were and then got it wrong? That's what happened when Open source the

1469
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:25,910
Speaker 4:  news.

1470
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:29,650
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So and, and then, but he says that on the one hand and then

1471
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:33,520
Speaker 5:  he talks about, you know, making the x the everything app, which

1472
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,780
Speaker 5:  nobody knows what the hell that means, but it has something to do with payments.

1473
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:40,640
Speaker 5:  And apparently Casey and, and the platform crew, they got a thing that

1474
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,310
Speaker 5:  says he's bringing long tweets back. So he wants to invent blogging.

1475
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:48,160
Speaker 5:  It's like Twitter has always been this like weird sort of amorphous

1476
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:52,110
Speaker 5:  thing. Apparently Vine might come back. Like there is no plan.

1477
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:55,850
Speaker 4:  I just wanna read you a headline. Here's a headline that we wrote

1478
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:59,680
Speaker 4:  in 2013, Reddit apologizes for online

1479
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:03,310
Speaker 4:  witch hunts Go Cas community to be sensitive of its own power.

1480
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:07,160
Speaker 4:  This is after they open source the news and they try to figure out

1481
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,120
Speaker 4:  who the Boston Marathon bombers were until they found the wrong person and

1482
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,400
Speaker 4:  an online mob descendant upon them. We have been through the cycle

1483
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,290
Speaker 4:  before. So these platitudes that are ignorant

1484
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:21,960
Speaker 4:  of all of the history of these ideas are not gonna motivate

1485
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,640
Speaker 4:  anyone at Twitter who is deeply aware of, like, again, I

1486
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,360
Speaker 4:  need to say this every single time criticism of Musk running Twitter is not

1487
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,000
Speaker 4:  praise for Twitter under previous administrations

1488
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,360
Speaker 4:  poorly

1489
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:33,640
Speaker 6:  Run

1490
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:37,520
Speaker 4:  Company, a badly run company. But one of the reasons it's run so

1491
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,040
Speaker 4:  badly is because it has always been

1492
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,400
Speaker 4:  paralyzed by its own. Like its own overwhelming

1493
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,200
Speaker 4:  power. Right. Twitter's influence is disproportional to its size

1494
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,680
Speaker 4:  and its revenue. And because they have always been so aware of it, they're

1495
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,480
Speaker 4:  paralyzed into not doing anything. Whereas Facebook, hilariously how they

1496
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,120
Speaker 4:  do it, influence is directly proportional to its size and revenue. And they're

1497
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,840
Speaker 4:  like, screw it, let's do a genocide. Right? Like, like Mark Zuckerberg is

1498
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,400
Speaker 4:  like, screw it. We're so important. I need to set up a Supreme Court that

1499
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:09,080
Speaker 4:  will issue four decisions a year. Yeah. Twitter's like, what if we are just

1500
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,280
Speaker 4:  paralyzed? And I, I just think like, I'm looking at all this must stuff.

1501
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:16,240
Speaker 4:  And again, he, he told his staff, Twitter is at heart a software and

1502
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,520
Speaker 4:  servers company. And it's like, no, it's not. Dude. You are a social sciences

1503
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,560
Speaker 5:  Company. You're a content moderation

1504
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,120
Speaker 4:  Company. You run a small country and you're the king of that

1505
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,040
Speaker 4:  country. And the most important thing about that country is

1506
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,800
Speaker 4:  if the citizens of that country can pull your pants down, they

1507
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,560
Speaker 4:  will. That's Twitter. You're the king of the,

1508
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,270
Speaker 4:  of a country whose sole purpose is to pants you good luck. Like

1509
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:41,260
Speaker 4:  it's not software and servers,

1510
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:45,160
Speaker 6:  But he thinks it's like, I I genuinely think a lot of his

1511
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,680
Speaker 6:  stuff about making it the town square doing all of this is platitudes to

1512
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,440
Speaker 6:  explain the fact that like what he really wants, he wants to do the big X

1513
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,840
Speaker 6:  everything app. That's, that's like his endgame. He said it repeatedly. And

1514
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,570
Speaker 6:  I think everything in between that is just how do I get people

1515
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:01,680
Speaker 6:  to abide by the cult personality? This Elon

1516
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,630
Speaker 6:  Musk,

1517
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:06,440
Speaker 4:  I, if you wanna do the, so the X David, you've written about these apps before,

1518
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:10,150
Speaker 4:  right? In China and other countries. WeChat is like a dominant

1519
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:13,000
Speaker 4:  social fabric app. Yeah. Everything happens on the, and

1520
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,640
Speaker 6:  He wants to do that, like he said repeatedly, I wanna do that here. And

1521
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,400
Speaker 6:  with his current team, he's not gonna do that because that's not what Twitter

1522
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,240
Speaker 6:  is. But

1523
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,200
Speaker 5:  You just, you need more than 50 engineers. It

1524
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,120
Speaker 4:  Turns you need more than 15 engineers. You need more than 229 million users.

1525
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:27,660
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1526
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:28,720
Speaker 6:  Yep. You need a

1527
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:32,240
Speaker 4:  Lot. Like one of the reasons WeChat works is there's like one and a half

1528
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,560
Speaker 4:  billion people in China and they all use it.

1529
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,400
Speaker 5:  Well, and the, I mean this like WeChat had a

1530
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,360
Speaker 5:  hook, right? Like WeChat had, WeChat was first a like massively

1531
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,720
Speaker 5:  successful messaging app and that that was the thing it had going for it.

1532
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,560
Speaker 5:  And then once you have that, you have this big captive audience you can bake

1533
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,400
Speaker 5:  all kinds of stuff into. And for a million cultural reasons, this is impossible

1534
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,960
Speaker 5:  to do in the United States. Like I, I would bet anything you asked me to

1535
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,720
Speaker 5:  bet that no one, including Elon Musk will ever

1536
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:03,160
Speaker 5:  pull this off in the United States because it is just not how our ecosystem

1537
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,700
Speaker 5:  works and how we do life in technology.

1538
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:09,600
Speaker 5:  But it all requires more than 50 engineers and it

1539
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,400
Speaker 5:  requires a thing people want to use, which is being systematically

1540
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,400
Speaker 5:  destroyed on both ends every single day by Elon Musk right now.

1541
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All right. So we've wrapped up Elon, we'll see how this goes. Every

1542
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,240
Speaker 4:  day is cast, I will tell you, once a week, the Virgin editorial team gathers

1543
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,360
Speaker 4:  and I say, are we over covering Elon? And we all kinda look at each other

1544
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:30,070
Speaker 4:  and we say, not yet. So we have received a request for

1545
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:33,880
Speaker 4:  a button on our homepage that will turn Elon stories off. We've taken

1546
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,080
Speaker 5:  That's a good idea.

1547
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,800
Speaker 4:  It's just a straight Elon filter. There's other stuff happening. The

1548
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,940
Speaker 4:  tech industry is in turmoil. There's new gadgets, which we should talk about.

1549
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:45,880
Speaker 4:  But this thing that is happening at Twitter, I feel like is the biggest story

1550
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:49,480
Speaker 4:  in the world because for, I mean, what was my thesis? And welcome to how

1551
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,560
Speaker 4:  Twitter will destroy your reputation and potentially cause grievous damage

1552
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,440
Speaker 4:  to other companies. It is happening so much faster than I expected. Yep.

1553
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:00,230
Speaker 4:  So we'll see how this goes. If he has to sell more Tesla stock, whew.

1554
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:03,720
Speaker 4:  That's not great. Okay, we're gonna take a break. We're come back.

1555
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,560
Speaker 4:  We're gonna talk about gadgets on this. The Vercast, I love a gadget

1556
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,120
Speaker 4:  only took us an hour and 40 minutes to get there. We're in an hour 40. All

1557
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,160
Speaker 4:  right. This is be a lightning round of all lightning rounds. We'll be right

1558
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:18,780
Speaker 4:  back.

1559
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,290
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're back. We are just way over, just ridiculously

1560
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:44,410
Speaker 4:  over

1561
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:46,330
Speaker 6:  45 more minutes of Elon. Let's go. Let's

1562
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:49,330
Speaker 4:  Go. That has to be fun, right? We're gonna talk about gadgets. Alex run the

1563
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:52,520
Speaker 4:  lightning round.

1564
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:55,970
Speaker 6:  It's barely on here, but what I really wanna talk about is that Qualcomm

1565
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:59,800
Speaker 6:  announced a whole new brand for Windows

1566
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,160
Speaker 6:  CPUs because this time, this time Qualcomm is

1567
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,560
Speaker 6:  serious about Windows CPUs.

1568
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:09,480
Speaker 4:  Okay? I cannot, for the life of me remember this word. I looked at it a

1569
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:13,120
Speaker 4:  lot last night and I was like, oxymoron. ORs. Like what

1570
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:13,850
Speaker 4:  is

1571
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:15,400
Speaker 6:  Or Orion?

1572
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,170
Speaker 4:  Orion or,

1573
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:20,220
Speaker 6:  Oh, it's a Y or

1574
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,130
Speaker 6:  why No,

1575
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:23,530
Speaker 4:  Or I

1576
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:24,170
Speaker 6:  Or I.

1577
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:25,250
Speaker 4:  Oh, Ryan.

1578
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:29,230
Speaker 6:  No, Ryan. It's poorly spelled o r

1579
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:31,950
Speaker 6:  y o n. I'm gonna call it Oron.

1580
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:32,440
Speaker 4:  Oron.

1581
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,790
Speaker 5:  It's oron. Or I will hear no other answer. It's oron forever.

1582
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:39,490
Speaker 5:  Qualcomm did this to themselves. It's definitely O, but it is oron.

1583
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:41,490
Speaker 4:  So there are no details about the cpu.

1584
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:45,480
Speaker 6:  No details. It'll be released in 2023. What is interesting is

1585
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,960
Speaker 6:  that this is using part of a company called Nuvia that Qualcomm acquired

1586
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,640
Speaker 6:  a couple years ago that's made up a bunch of engineers who worked on

1587
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:56,600
Speaker 6:  Apple's chips. Yes. Back in the day. And those eventually became the M

1588
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,400
Speaker 6:  one, which is a very, very good cpu. So theoretically the same could happen

1589
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:04,320
Speaker 6:  for Qualcomm. But given that Qualcomm's been trained to do this for how

1590
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,310
Speaker 6:  many years, I'm not super optimistic.

1591
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:10,840
Speaker 5:  Qualcomm chips to me are like, are like the LG

1592
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:14,760
Speaker 5:  display screens that you see every once in a while where they're

1593
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,840
Speaker 5:  just like, here's a neat thing we made. And then you never see it again.

1594
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,200
Speaker 5:  Like the number of times Qualcomm has been like, oh, there's a problem that

1595
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,080
Speaker 5:  you have with your headphones slash car slash tablets slash television

1596
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:29,040
Speaker 5:  slash wearables slash pc. We'll fix it. And then

1597
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,400
Speaker 5:  they put out a chip and you're like, is this, is this the one that you said

1598
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,480
Speaker 5:  was gonna fix it? And they're like, yeah, it's slow, but next generation,

1599
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Speaker 5:  we're gonna fix it. It's gonna be great. And this is just what we do. It's

1600
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:42,200
Speaker 5:  like we are kicking the football and Qualcomm is, is Lucy just

1601
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,170
Speaker 5:  jerking away it's chip every time we try get it

1602
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:48,780
Speaker 4:  Be crazy. So I want

1603
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:52,520
Speaker 4:  two things. One, Qualcomm announced us that they're yearly junked in

1604
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:52,970
Speaker 4:  Hawaii

1605
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:54,200
Speaker 6:  We did not attend. Which

1606
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,000
Speaker 4:  We won't take, we won't let companies pay for

1607
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,690
Speaker 6:  Junkets. And I don't wanna send anybody to Hawaii and listen

1608
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:01,750
Speaker 4:  Me, we're, we're just not paying the money to Hawaii.

1609
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,280
Speaker 6:  Like, and I go to Hawaii to

1610
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,680
Speaker 4:  Watch them be like, here's a spelling of the word Orion that you've not seen

1611
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,160
Speaker 4:  before. No further details. Perfect. So this happens, like this happened

1612
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,400
Speaker 4:  late at night Hawaii time. And we're just like, what is this? No details.

1613
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:17,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But know that there is a very fancy Qualcomm junket going on in the

1614
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,680
Speaker 4:  background. There are, by the way, entire industries that are basically junk.

1615
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,880
Speaker 4:  It driven, like I love cars, I love to cover cars

1616
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:27,560
Speaker 4:  more. We have to overcome the ethical barrier of the drunken driven

1617
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,720
Speaker 4:  car media, which I, we cannot do.

1618
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,400
Speaker 6:  Like 90% of entertainment media is like, do you wanna just go hang out

1619
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:37,320
Speaker 6:  with Chris Evans? You can for 30 minutes come

1620
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,030
Speaker 6:  to Budapest.

1621
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:41,420
Speaker 5:  I do, I do. I will. Thank you for asking. It's

1622
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:45,160
Speaker 4:  Yes. I know that the disclosures are a joke for us across the board, but

1623
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,750
Speaker 4:  it's like, oh man, I can't do that many disclosures.

1624
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:50,680
Speaker 6:  It's too many. That's just the, that's the Verge cast

1625
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,250
Speaker 6:  folks.

1626
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:56,030
Speaker 4:  We took a trip to Hawaii, we went to Budapest. Christ was there.

1627
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:59,840
Speaker 4:  Then I drove a Cadillac across the mountains that was also like, it's all

1628
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,960
Speaker 4:  like that. Whatever. It's fine, fine. We do our best. We pay for when at

1629
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,320
Speaker 4:  support. But there's this big Qualcomm event going on. So there's a bunch

1630
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,640
Speaker 4:  of news, other Qualcomm event. Second thing, Nuvia is really fascinating,

1631
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,320
Speaker 4:  right? Yeah. So a bunch of ex Apple engineers, they got sued by Apple, Qualcomm

1632
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,850
Speaker 4:  by Nuvia. So Arm has sued Qualcomm. So you can't make these trips.

1633
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:19,800
Speaker 4:  Apple's mad at Nuvia. So you took some stuff from us and Qualcomm

1634
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,960
Speaker 4:  is out there being like, Orion, we're doing it. It doesn't

1635
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:26,900
Speaker 4:  matter. So it's just like these chips, this name,

1636
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:30,820
Speaker 4:  lot of baggage underneath this collection of letters.

1637
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:34,640
Speaker 6:  And what if it just sucks on top of all of that? It finally comes out and

1638
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:35,120
Speaker 6:  you're like, it's

1639
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,070
Speaker 5:  Going to

1640
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:37,520
Speaker 6:  I three,

1641
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,790
Speaker 5:  It's going to

1642
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,150
Speaker 6:  I three level.

1643
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:43,800
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It, it's just, I don't know. Are we, are we at a point now where

1644
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,280
Speaker 5:  Qualcomm like made one really good thing 20 years ago and we just forgot

1645
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,120
Speaker 5:  that they never made nes?

1646
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,720
Speaker 4:  Wait, I need to, I need to, I need to be, I need to make

1647
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,680
Speaker 4:  clear. Hold on. Apple did not file a lawsuit against Nuvia. Oh.

1648
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,660
Speaker 4:  They filed the lawsuit against Gerard Williams ii,

1649
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:03,400
Speaker 4:  who is the chief architect. He was the chief

1650
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:06,120
Speaker 4:  architect of the M series. And then he left to start Nuvia. So they filed

1651
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,910
Speaker 4:  it against him, not Nuvia itself. This is important, but not important because

1652
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:13,860
Speaker 4:  presumably he's architecting the chips Nuvia.

1653
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:17,200
Speaker 4:  But anyway, Apple's got a lawsuit against some of the things that happen

1654
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,400
Speaker 4:  in Nuvia Arm has a lawsuit against Qualcomm. And you're right David, they've

1655
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,960
Speaker 4:  gotta actually make the chips. They've gotta be good. But theoretically they

1656
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,310
Speaker 4:  bought this company to get ahead of the curve

1657
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:28,050
Speaker 6:  Lawsuits. Yeah.

1658
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:29,160
Speaker 4:  Oh, Ryan

1659
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,500
Speaker 6:  Orion.

1660
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,200
Speaker 4:  All right. What's next on the line you're

1661
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,280
Speaker 6:  In Right next up is, I mean this one's for me. I'm very excited about it.

1662
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:40,120
Speaker 6:  The I Gatos new stream deck. It's the stream deck plus and it's got

1663
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,800
Speaker 6:  knobs. That's it.

1664
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,440
Speaker 4:  That's, I will say this is one of our best headlines ever. And Alice

1665
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,920
Speaker 4:  wrote it. Oh God. New stream deck joins the knob. Yeah,

1666
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,800
Speaker 4:  definitely. Hiphop crew. It's very pretty. I won't want, I have no idea

1667
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,480
Speaker 4:  what I would use it for.

1668
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:57,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah, same. That like, it's perfect. I just, I don't know what I'll do with

1669
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:00,040
Speaker 6:  it, but I'm gonna have a great time. It's got a bunch of knobs. We're, we've

1670
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:03,240
Speaker 6:  seeing that a lot in like the keyboard space. Everybody's like, you know

1671
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,520
Speaker 6:  what your keyboard needs big old knob and it's nice. That stream deck was

1672
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,560
Speaker 6:  like, you know what? Yes. Yeah, let's do it. This

1673
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:12,640
Speaker 5:  Just makes me happy. Like the Verge believes in buttons. This is like a thing.

1674
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,520
Speaker 5:  I feel very strongly like the Verge, we we, the verge, we believe in buttons

1675
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:20,060
Speaker 5:  and this has a lot of buttons. Yeah. And it has a little tiny touch bar thing,

1676
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:23,460
Speaker 5:  but you don't have to touch that cuz you can just control it with the knobs.

1677
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:27,340
Speaker 5:  And the knobs look nice. They have a little like reflective thing on them

1678
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:29,920
Speaker 5:  for when the light shines. It's lovely. It makes me happy.

1679
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,260
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Everything about this

1680
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:34,600
Speaker 5:  Put them all to my volume so that I can spend all of them at the same time

1681
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,590
Speaker 5:  just to make the volume go up really fast. It's gonna be,

1682
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:37,920
Speaker 6:  It's gonna be really, really cool.

1683
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,400
Speaker 4:  Every button is an emotional adventure that you can take. It's

1684
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,320
Speaker 4:  true. Any button you see in your life, someone put it there and someone pushes

1685
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:49,080
Speaker 4:  it. And those are all decisions. A lot of feelings got get tied up in all

1686
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,950
Speaker 4:  those decisions.

1687
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:50,240
Speaker 5:  I

1688
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,830
Speaker 6:  Love it. And then Sona said their earnings call this week and they confirmed

1689
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:57,760
Speaker 6:  that they plan to enter four new product categories starting next

1690
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,880
Speaker 6:  year. One of those is lightly gonna be some Sonos headphones,

1691
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,720
Speaker 6:  which I don't personally think makes sense, but I feel like David has,

1692
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,590
Speaker 6:  has contested this before on the Verge cast with me. So

1693
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I I just feel like if you're Sonos you have to make headphones at some

1694
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,120
Speaker 5:  point. Like it's just, it's it's taken them too long. Like just make

1695
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:20,000
Speaker 5:  headphones like we're why we get it. Your Sonos. I kind

1696
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,240
Speaker 5:  of thought them getting into the whole portable speaker thing was a weird

1697
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,480
Speaker 5:  idea that it's like if you wanna invest in the home, invest in the home,

1698
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,800
Speaker 5:  but they need to do other stuff. So just, just buy all the way in. Make your

1699
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,620
Speaker 5:  AirPods Max competitor, make your AirPods competitor and just

1700
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:36,480
Speaker 5:  try to be the real full audio company

1701
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,560
Speaker 5:  that runs your whole life. Yeah. Like for all I know, they're gonna start

1702
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:43,110
Speaker 5:  making like third party speakers to put into your car.

1703
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:47,040
Speaker 5:  Like NE's gonna swap out the CarPlay thing in his Jeep for a

1704
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,280
Speaker 5:  Sonos thing in his Jeep. And that's where this is gonna be.

1705
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,400
Speaker 6:  It could happen. It could happen. But like, I think what was really interesting

1706
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,640
Speaker 6:  is they said new categories. Yeah. So we know that a bunch of Chris Welch

1707
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:59,160
Speaker 6:  has done a lot of reporting and, and shown that we're getting a new like

1708
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,760
Speaker 6:  sub, I think we're getting a new kind of replacement for the Sonos play.

1709
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:03,120
Speaker 6:  Five.

1710
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,600
Speaker 4:  The opto the

1711
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,440
Speaker 6:  Optimal. It's good, it's great. But these are new categories. One of

1712
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:12,200
Speaker 6:  'em may be a home theater box or your dream.

1713
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,800
Speaker 4:  They've gotta make a receiver. I'm telling you the thing they should make,

1714
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,820
Speaker 4:  Patrick, if you're listening to this and I know you are, make a receiver

1715
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:21,520
Speaker 4:  and make the lights really big on the front. Yeah, right.

1716
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,240
Speaker 4:  Just a big atmos light. Big Doby vision light. One light for every speaker

1717
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,880
Speaker 4:  channel. Boom. Just big lights.

1718
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,040
Speaker 6:  Just look at a glance.

1719
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,390
Speaker 4:  That's all I want in the world.

1720
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:31,320
Speaker 6:  Just see everything.

1721
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The home theater thing seems like it's definitely gonna happen like

1722
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:37,080
Speaker 5:  that. That's another one where it's just like Sonos, just finish the job.

1723
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,040
Speaker 5:  Right? Like you, they've, they've been sort of trending towards this for

1724
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:43,710
Speaker 5:  a while. It's like either make a TV or make a set top box.

1725
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:47,480
Speaker 5:  Just do it. I'm bored of dealing with your nonsense. Just make

1726
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:47,880
Speaker 5:  the damn

1727
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,760
Speaker 4:  Box. But gigantic. L e d indicators for atmos provision

1728
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,560
Speaker 4:  for every channel of speakers. That's all I

1729
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:56,640
Speaker 5:  Really like. I imagine now that if, if, if I were to like walk into your

1730
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,240
Speaker 5:  house, there would just be like a glowing neon Dolby atmo sign

1731
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,750
Speaker 5:  above your television.

1732
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,680
Speaker 4:  It's just like, you know, we actually don't watch movies. We just watched

1733
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,960
Speaker 4:  that one Atmos cliff, we're hearing a forest and it's raining. I'm like,

1734
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,400
Speaker 4:  come, let's go watch a movie. I'm like, is you're in this forest

1735
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,320
Speaker 4:  again. Right? What else you

1736
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:17,000
Speaker 6:  Got? And then Chris, this is also from Chris. He really,

1737
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,840
Speaker 6:  really, really liked Amazon Alexa Voice

1738
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:21,730
Speaker 6:  Remote Pro.

1739
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:23,420
Speaker 4:  Is that the one with the big buttons? They

1740
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:27,320
Speaker 6:  Got the big buttons. It's got backlight so you can like see

1741
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:31,030
Speaker 6:  the big buttons. It's, it's still got buttons that are like Netflix,

1742
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:34,520
Speaker 6:  Hulu, but their buttons, you'd actually use no Blockbuster Insight. So Netflix,

1743
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:37,640
Speaker 6:  prime Video, Disney Plus and Hulu paid to this.

1744
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,080
Speaker 4:  They paid the money.

1745
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,920
Speaker 6:  They paid and like, okay, I'm glad you took their money and not What's

1746
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,840
Speaker 6:  Walmart's thing called?

1747
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,400
Speaker 5:  Voodoo?

1748
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,200
Speaker 6:  Voodoo. I don't want Voodoo ever. It's never gonna happen.

1749
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,280
Speaker 4:  I used Voodoo for a while cuz it had higher bit rate than anyone else. And

1750
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,520
Speaker 4:  then Walmart bought it and that's,

1751
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,970
Speaker 6:  And now, I dunno, it's garbage. Don't use it.

1752
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:56,070
Speaker 4:  No. There's like one Voodoo fan here. You're like a Plex person.

1753
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:59,400
Speaker 6:  I love Plex Plex, but I don't love Voodoo. I do like that it,

1754
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,730
Speaker 4:  They all railhead. Were deep on Voodoo for a while.

1755
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,150
Speaker 6:  It was fun. I didn't have good internet then.

1756
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:05,040
Speaker 4:  That's why

1757
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:05,840
Speaker 6:  Literally

1758
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,480
Speaker 4:  Hate it off the rails. It's a remote, not off the rails. Welch gave it an

1759
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,440
Speaker 4:  eight. It's got good buttons.

1760
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,880
Speaker 6:  He really, really liked it. It was great. We're starting to see a lot of

1761
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,560
Speaker 6:  stuff coming from Matter. So Jen Tuy was, was in

1762
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,540
Speaker 6:  Amsterdam for the big matter announcement two weeks ago.

1763
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:24,400
Speaker 6:  And so we're starting to see some of that stuff start to come out. TP

1764
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,240
Speaker 6:  Link has got a huge router that's gonna have matter in it, but

1765
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:32,080
Speaker 6:  also is doing wifi seven. You cannot currently I think buy anything

1766
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,100
Speaker 6:  that uses wifi seven. So that's some real future proofing.

1767
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:38,800
Speaker 4:  But it also is, it looks like a, a cross

1768
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,600
Speaker 4:  between a gaming PC and a ups.

1769
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,030
Speaker 6:  You can, like the lights on it are customizable so you can make like a little

1770
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:46,150
Speaker 6:  smiley face or a little sat like

1771
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:50,070
Speaker 4:  Little face. What I want my router to do, it's wink at me with like

1772
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:53,560
Speaker 6:  Only when like when you're like, is the internet being slow because my computer

1773
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:57,230
Speaker 6:  or the router and you look at it and the router winks, that would be like

1774
01:35:57,230 --> 01:36:00,920
Speaker 6:  choice. And then Wise is getting into the mesh

1775
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,600
Speaker 6:  router business. I don't know if I would use a router

1776
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,710
Speaker 6:  from Wise, but it's happening. Yeah,

1777
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:10,200
Speaker 4:  I mean it's like matter time and then there's like the one plug that you

1778
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,410
Speaker 4:  can buy. Yeah.

1779
01:36:11,410 --> 01:36:14,760
Speaker 6:  So lot of news. A lot of it's really great. It's on the site. You should

1780
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,500
Speaker 6:  all go read it. A lot of really great stuff.

1781
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:20,000
Speaker 5:  The one other cool thing that was announced this week, which is actually

1782
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,960
Speaker 5:  the, the like one of the early 2023 stories I am most curious about is

1783
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,120
Speaker 5:  that Apple announced that the major league soccer streaming service that's

1784
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,880
Speaker 5:  been working on is launching I think February 1st. And

1785
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,800
Speaker 5:  it's gonna be a hundred bucks for the whole major league soccer season. I'm

1786
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,930
Speaker 5:  not even really a, an MLS fan, but like

1787
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:36,760
Speaker 6:  No blackouts

1788
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:40,480
Speaker 5:  What looks like when Apple builds a streaming service from scratch

1789
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,800
Speaker 5:  for sports, I think it's gonna be fascinating. Yeah. They've said no blackouts,

1790
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,120
Speaker 5:  you get all the live games for a hundred bucks a season, they're gonna do

1791
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:50,480
Speaker 5:  a like red zone style whip around show. Apple

1792
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:54,000
Speaker 5:  has, I would not say done like a super great job of

1793
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,560
Speaker 5:  broadcasting sports so far. Like it, it, it felt like, it like hired a bunch

1794
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,880
Speaker 5:  of people who had never watched baseball to do its baseball show. But it's

1795
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,880
Speaker 5:  gonna be really interesting to see like these two like really tied together

1796
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,520
Speaker 5:  and were like from the ground up we're gonna build a new thing and I think

1797
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,480
Speaker 5:  it's gonna be fascinating. Can

1798
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:11,120
Speaker 4:  Can you do a whip around show for soccer?

1799
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:11,600
Speaker 4:  What's

1800
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,120
Speaker 6:  A whip around

1801
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,040
Speaker 4:  Show? So like NFL Red Zone is like a whip around show where it jumps from

1802
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,480
Speaker 4:  game to game to game. Okay. But

1803
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,250
Speaker 5:  Like as interesting stuff happens,

1804
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:21,760
Speaker 4:  No but like it has a very, like football is a very

1805
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:22,880
Speaker 4:  organized

1806
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,440
Speaker 6:  Sport.

1807
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right? They're like, it's called Red zone because if you're inside

1808
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,360
Speaker 4:  the 20 yard line, you're in the red zone. Yeah. So whenever any team is in

1809
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,760
Speaker 4:  the Red Zone, red zone cuts to that team and they're like, they're gonna

1810
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,640
Speaker 4:  score a touchdown or a field goal or not. This is the exciting part of the

1811
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,440
Speaker 4:  game we're gonna show to you. Yeah. And all the games happen at the same

1812
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,560
Speaker 4:  time. Mostly. Right.

1813
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:45,280
Speaker 5:  That's the key. There's so much going on simultaneously that it's really

1814
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,720
Speaker 5:  easy to do that where if you're cutting between three basketball games in

1815
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,480
Speaker 5:  a night, like it's just, it doesn't work the same

1816
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,400
Speaker 4:  Way and and then it's not as structured cuz you're like Right. The soccer

1817
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,630
Speaker 4:  ball is near the goal and it's like usually nothing happens.

1818
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:58,590
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1819
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:59,630
Speaker 4:  When that like

1820
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:01,800
Speaker 6:  I feel like soccer does not lend itself.

1821
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like soccer is to

1822
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:03,440
Speaker 6:  The red zone.

1823
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:06,580
Speaker 4:  The beauty and elegance of these kicks and runs

1824
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:09,040
Speaker 6:  The beauty and elegance of dudes falling and pretending

1825
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,600
Speaker 4:  Their heart once again,

1826
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:14,280
Speaker 5:  There is gonna be a lot of the whip around show that says look at this awesome

1827
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:17,110
Speaker 5:  pass that accidentally went out bounds. Like there's gonna be a lot of that.

1828
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:18,520
Speaker 5:  I was just saying and I'm ready for it.

1829
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:22,120
Speaker 4:  Maybe there is somewhere internationally there's like a football with and

1830
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,840
Speaker 4:  I'm just not aware of it. Please let me know if you've heard, because I'm

1831
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,640
Speaker 4:  just thinking structurally how would you produce it? And it's like, I mean

1832
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:27,840
Speaker 4:  it's,

1833
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,840
Speaker 5:  It's, it's literally, it's gonna be a lot of like beautiful runs and beautiful

1834
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:34,440
Speaker 5:  passes and almost goals. Like that's what highlights are now. Right. Like

1835
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:38,080
Speaker 5:  I watch, I'm a big Arsenal fan and so I watch the like 16 minute

1836
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:41,790
Speaker 5:  long highlights of an Arsenal game if I miss it. And

1837
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:45,530
Speaker 5:  it's like a one nothing game that they get 16 minutes of highlights on.

1838
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:46,810
Speaker 4:  So it's like

1839
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:50,040
Speaker 5:  They're gonna do it, it'll it'll be there. It'll just be like, look at this

1840
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:53,560
Speaker 5:  great kick that no one got to on the other end of it. And you have to appreciate

1841
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:54,960
Speaker 5:  that it's the beautiful

1842
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,560
Speaker 4:  Game. I did. That's what I was saying. Like look at the power and elegance

1843
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,440
Speaker 4:  of this long pass that it's no

1844
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:03,240
Speaker 4:  mill. Yeah, that's fine. I'm,

1845
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:07,200
Speaker 4:  I'm very excited for Apple. Lets try this out. I just like, this is the

1846
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,600
Speaker 4:  lead up to Apple trying to get Sunday ticket, which is like the big product.

1847
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:10,920
Speaker 4:  Yes.

1848
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,240
Speaker 6:  To get a sport that people actually

1849
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:12,940
Speaker 4:  Watch

1850
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:16,520
Speaker 5:  And that's why like this just as a product. That's why I'm fascinated by

1851
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,480
Speaker 5:  this for that exact reason cuz there are bigger prizes out there that this

1852
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,070
Speaker 5:  is gonna be what they try to get.

1853
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:24,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And Eddie Q has very publicly been like, we're not gonna just take

1854
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:28,280
Speaker 4:  rights and rebroadcast things. We wanna do it our own way and this is their

1855
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:32,200
Speaker 4:  own way. And it's like alright this is their attempt to make

1856
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,720
Speaker 4:  something that looks like Red zone. Cuz if you take it you gotta make Red

1857
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,520
Speaker 4:  Zone. I

1858
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:40,360
Speaker 6:  Mean it sounds way better than everything. My brother tries to watch football

1859
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:44,120
Speaker 6:  games and then I have to deal with the phone calls cause he can't watch the

1860
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,960
Speaker 6:  football games. So this already, I wish he was into this kind of football

1861
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:50,810
Speaker 6:  because this seems like it's gonna save me a lot of phone calls

1862
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:54,360
Speaker 4:  Because you're gonna buy the one thing from Apple. Yeah. And you're still

1863
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,310
Speaker 4:  gonna get the phone calls.

1864
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:56,520
Speaker 6:  I hate it.

1865
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:59,280
Speaker 4:  Alright, we gotta wrap this show up. There's some more stuff. I think it's

1866
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,930
Speaker 4:  very funny that Cannon is trying to charge people $50 a year

1867
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:04,960
Speaker 4:  to, for their webcam software.

1868
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:05,760
Speaker 6:  Don't do it.

1869
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,160
Speaker 4:  Please show, just buy a capture card please for

1870
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,210
Speaker 4:  $50.

1871
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:12,990
Speaker 6:  Go buy another webcam. Just don't, don't give them your money.

1872
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:14,000
Speaker 4:  It's very good. Which

1873
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,720
Speaker 6:  Is terrible.

1874
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,560
Speaker 4:  But some good news Razor is upgrading the USC ports on the

1875
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,000
Speaker 4:  2020 twos late 14 to USB four. Which is cool. That's

1876
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,080
Speaker 6:  And they're doing it through

1877
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:26,520
Speaker 4:  Software. Through software. That's awesome. Good job. Razor. Good job. Okay.

1878
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,280

1890
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,800
Speaker 4:  a great piece from a man in Chicago Lewis about the Department of Homeland

Speaker 4:  It's probably fine. It's probably fine department Homeland security is a

1897
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,880
Speaker 4:  boondoggle, like a pure boondoggle. Nobody wanted to create it. They bunched

1898
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:33,040
Speaker 4:  all this stuff together. Corporate structure. You know how I, how I feel

1899
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:36,160
Speaker 4:  about corporate Tructure. Yeah. It's just a mess. Read the story everyone

1900
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:39,400
Speaker 4:  quoted in the story is like, this thing's a mess and it sucks. You gotta

1907
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,880
Speaker 4:  a top five stories and a story showing move down. We think people are gonna

1908
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,720
Speaker 4:  like it. We've got some big ideas for that on mobile, which the thing that

1912
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:20,280
Speaker 4:  clicks to calm down. We figured out what people wanted. We think this is
