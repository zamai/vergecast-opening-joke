00:00:02,395 --> 00:00:06,125
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Spec Bumps. I'm your friend

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:09,965
Speaker 2:  David Pierce and I am once again in the e Barrett

4
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:13,885
Speaker 2:  Prettyman Courthouse in Washington DC. That's right folks. I am back

5
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:17,685
Speaker 2:  at USV Google this time. I'm here for Sundar Phai, the CEO of Google.

6
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:21,765
Speaker 2:  His testimony was on Monday and we learned some fascinating

7
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:25,285
Speaker 2:  stuff about the Apple deal, about the things that Google wanted to preload

8
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:29,205
Speaker 2:  onto iOS devices. There's this fascinating alternate universe that Apple

9
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:32,085
Speaker 2:  and Google could have gone down. We're gonna get into all of that I think

10
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:35,725
Speaker 2:  next week we have a lot of catching up to do on some of the trials with SBF

11
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:39,645
Speaker 2:  and antitrust and some new antitrust stuff happening, lots to get to. But

12
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:43,245
Speaker 2:  for today we're gonna talk about two things. First, we're gonna talk about

13
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:47,165
Speaker 2:  the Apple event from Monday night, the big Scary Fast event with all of

14
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:51,085
Speaker 2:  its new devices and unlabeled y axes. We're gonna get into the

15
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:54,805
Speaker 2:  new devices, whether they're interesting, why Apple chose to do this at 8:00 PM

16
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,565
Speaker 2:  Eastern on a Monday night and a bunch more. Then I'm gonna talk to

17
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:02,485
Speaker 2:  Becca Farsace from our video team, all about phone cameras. We've spent

18
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:06,045
Speaker 2:  a lot of time this year talking about and shooting with these new phone cameras

19
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,445
Speaker 2:  and increasingly on things like the Pixel and the Galaxy Line and the iPhone.

20
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:12,725
Speaker 2:  The phones are the thing like that is the reason you buy a new phone

21
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:16,845
Speaker 2:  herein and year out. It's either that or like your battery dies. So we're

22
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:20,525
Speaker 2:  gonna get into are phones getting better? Are they getting more different,

23
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:24,245
Speaker 2:  developing their own taste or are we getting kind of to a platonic ideal

24
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:28,045
Speaker 2:  of smartphone photos? It's a super fun conversation. It goes like all over

25
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:30,605
Speaker 2:  the place, but it's a good time. All that is coming up in just a minute,

26
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:34,725
Speaker 2:  but I just found the cafeteria in this courthouse after like a

27
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:38,045
Speaker 2:  lot of days of being here and that means I actually get to have lunch

28
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:41,805
Speaker 2:  during the trial. This is very exciting for me. I'm gonna go make that happen.

Speaker 2:  Welcome back All, right? They let me outta the courtroom. It was very exciting.

40
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:27,775
Speaker 2:  I don't have a cold anymore, let's get to it.

41
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:31,295
Speaker 4:  Good evening. And Welcome To Apple Park.

42
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,775
Speaker 2:  On Monday night, apple held an event that it called Scary Fast. For some

43
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,855
Speaker 2:  reason in my head, this event is called Spooky Scary, but it's not. It was

44
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:42,295
Speaker 2:  called Scary Fast and there were signs from the beginning that this event

45
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:46,335
Speaker 2:  was always gonna be a bit unusual. First of all, it was

46
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:50,255
Speaker 2:  on a Monday at 8:00 PM Eastern, 5:00 PM Pacific, which is up

47
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,695
Speaker 2:  against like Monday night football. Nobody was invited, it was all virtual.

48
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,495
Speaker 2:  And like we talked about last week on the show, this sort of seemed like

49
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:00,445
Speaker 2:  Apple trying to flex its muscles in prime time. My theory going

50
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:04,125
Speaker 2:  in was that either this was gonna be one of Apple's sneaky big

51
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:07,085
Speaker 2:  announcements ever. It was gonna like announce it bought Disney or something

52
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:11,005
Speaker 2:  or that it was essentially trying to bury an event, which seemed weird because

53
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,405
Speaker 2:  normally when Apple thinks it had S news that isn't all that interesting.

54
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:16,405
Speaker 2:  It just puts out a press release. So I was very confused about what this

55
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:20,245
Speaker 2:  was gonna be and as you can see, I also had a million theories about how

56
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:23,085
Speaker 2:  this event was gonna work, whether there would be costumes, And, what we

57
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:26,765
Speaker 2:  would see announced and I was wrong about, I think just about every single

58
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:30,645
Speaker 2:  one of them. But we'll get to that to talk about what did happen. Alex Cranz

59
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:34,445
Speaker 2:  and Dan Seaford are here. Alex Cranz. Hello. Hello. Dan Seaford.

60
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:38,325
Speaker 2:  Hello. Hello. I have no idea where to start. I con, I confess I'm

61
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,325
Speaker 2:  so confused now. Many hours after this Apple event that

62
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:45,245
Speaker 2:  I'm not sure what to do. But let's, let's just start with the vibe of the

63
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:49,085
Speaker 2:  thing itself. So Dan, we got this invite and it was

64
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,925
Speaker 2:  for 8:00 PM Eastern on a Monday night and we immediately started

65
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:56,805
Speaker 2:  trying to decide what is Apple doing here? We had

66
00:03:56,805 --> 00:04:00,365
Speaker 2:  a lot of theories now that we've seen the thing. Why did Apple do this at

67
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,405
Speaker 2:  8:00 PM on a Monday night?

68
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:06,045
Speaker 6:  I think the strongest theory, which we still really don't know the answer

69
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,565
Speaker 6:  to why they did it on Monday night, but the strongest going theory is it's

70
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:13,525
Speaker 6:  a testing of the waters to see if they can get the audience and the

71
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:17,405
Speaker 6:  interest in the primetime time slot for when they do a bigger

72
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:21,205
Speaker 6:  event that's either the next iPhone or the next iPad event or their

73
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:24,925
Speaker 6:  spring event, whatever it might be. That's my guess. And I think that

74
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:29,285
Speaker 6:  in Apple's eyes, at least based on what I've seen, based on the interest

75
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:32,965
Speaker 6:  on our own site, they probably have the interest to do it.

76
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:34,605
Speaker 6:  And so going forward,

77
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,045
Speaker 5:  No Dan, they're

78
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:38,245
Speaker 6:  Probably gonna be at 8:00 PM on Monday nights.

79
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:41,885
Speaker 5:  Dan, this is incorrect because we all watched this one

80
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,565
Speaker 5:  because we were hoping it was gonna be something interesting and something

81
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:49,405
Speaker 5:  a little more because it was, it was at 8:00 PM or 5:00 PM if you're on the

82
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:53,005
Speaker 5:  Pacific time, there was that little bit of like desire and then instead it

83
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:56,965
Speaker 5:  was not just a a very traditional Apple event. It was like the

84
00:04:56,965 --> 00:05:00,685
Speaker 5:  most traditional Yeah. And it just, I

85
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:04,485
Speaker 5:  do not think it was successful at what they wanted to do. Yeah, people

86
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:08,005
Speaker 5:  watched it. But are people gonna tune in every time or did they

87
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,885
Speaker 5:  just like waste it?

88
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:13,325
Speaker 6:  I honestly, I think that for an iPhone event, they could have it at three

89
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:14,645
Speaker 6:  in the morning and people will tune in.

90
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,125
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. I agree with that.

91
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:20,205
Speaker 6:  The audience probably has heard to say this, but the amount of

92
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:23,845
Speaker 6:  attention that Apple can pull is so much more than

93
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:27,685
Speaker 6:  basically any other company. And so Apple can do

94
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:31,605
Speaker 6:  basically what it wants. I will say that they did lean into the fact that

95
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:35,205
Speaker 6:  it was at night, like their prerecorded infomercial was shot at night

96
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:39,045
Speaker 6:  and they were all wearing dark clothes because it was spooky and

97
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:42,365
Speaker 5:  It's the dynamic range on the iPhone that shot it all was incredible.

98
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,845
Speaker 2:  We're gonna talk about that in the next segment. I don't, that's just, that's

99
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,525
Speaker 2:  for Becca to talk about later. Don't even worry about it.

100
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,565
Speaker 6:  There was lots of like cloud or smoke effects and You know

101
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:56,005
Speaker 6:  nobody wore a costume. I was hoping that they would be a little bit more

102
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:57,565
Speaker 6:  fun and wear a costume. I

103
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,725
Speaker 2:  Was a little disappointed that no one even, there weren't even like little

104
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:04,205
Speaker 2:  jokey costumes that appeared for a second and then dis like I was, I was

105
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:04,925
Speaker 2:  hoping for something.

106
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,205
Speaker 6:  Nobody even had like a jack of lantern pin or anything.

107
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,445
Speaker 5:  Right. I have an additional theory for why they did it at this time. Okay.

108
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:14,725
Speaker 5:  Because I was sitting there last night after the event. It was about

109
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,525
Speaker 5:  8 31 because the event ended exactly at eight 30. It was a 30

110
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:22,165
Speaker 5:  minute event. And I was like, why was it at this time of day? Because

111
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:26,045
Speaker 5:  generally speaking, you wanna get as maximum, you wanna get as many people

112
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:30,365
Speaker 5:  watching as possible, right? So everybody on the Pacific Coast is watching

113
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:34,285
Speaker 5:  as they watch right before they leave to work. Right? Everybody on the East

114
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:38,085
Speaker 5:  Coast and everybody in central time is watching over like dinner because

115
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,725
Speaker 5:  I guess that's what we all did. Yeah.

116
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,525
Speaker 2:  We had people on our staff who were like, I just put my kids to bed in the

117
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:44,765
Speaker 2:  middle of an Apple event. What is happening here? I

118
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:47,685
Speaker 6:  Speed ran bedtime last night. I was like, you guys are all getting to bed.

119
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:50,205
Speaker 6:  Brush your teeth as fast as possible. Gotta go. I

120
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:53,725
Speaker 5:  Would, I would argue that it wasn't the best time to maximize

121
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:56,885
Speaker 5:  American views. And so then I was like, I was thinking about it and I was

122
00:06:56,885 --> 00:06:59,765
Speaker 5:  like, okay, well maybe Europe. And I was like, no, Europe, it's even later.

123
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:03,405
Speaker 5:  So this is actually a much worse time for Europe because they're all in bed

124
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,765
Speaker 5:  to sleep. 'cause it's sleeping time for them. So you're cutting out that

125
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:10,245
Speaker 5:  whole market. So the best I could think was, maybe this was

126
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:14,685
Speaker 5:  for China where it would've been first thing in the morning would've been

127
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:18,445
Speaker 5:  seven, eight o'clock. Where we're currently having a massive

128
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,765
Speaker 5:  debate with the country about processors and who builds those

129
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:26,645
Speaker 5:  processors. And this entire event was about processors. So

130
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:30,525
Speaker 5:  there's, I was like, is there something there or was it really just, we wanna

131
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:34,525
Speaker 5:  see if Americans will tune in as they're putting their kids to

132
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,685
Speaker 5:  bed the day before Halloween. In which case

133
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:42,085
Speaker 5:  I feel like that was a weird, weird bet to me.

134
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:46,005
Speaker 6:  I could see the China argument more for an iPhone event. A Mac event.

135
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:46,565
Speaker 6:  But this,

136
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:50,685
Speaker 5:  It wasn't a Mac event as much as it was a processor event that had Macs

137
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:51,805
Speaker 5:  in it. Right? Sure.

138
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:55,765
Speaker 6:  But it was the processors that go into Macs. It's not the processors

139
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:58,965
Speaker 6:  that go into iPhones and most of the iPads, it is like their

140
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,765
Speaker 6:  desktop computing processors.

141
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,885
Speaker 5:  But those processors are just as important just as like the iPhone is

142
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:08,165
Speaker 5:  obviously more important than the Mac, but those processors as it compares

143
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:11,725
Speaker 5:  to, to the other big folks making processors that go in

144
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,485
Speaker 5:  computers and servers and stuff just as important.

145
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:18,565
Speaker 2:  It's a good theory. Yeah. I think and and Apple is definitely going out of

146
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:22,125
Speaker 2:  its way to flex itself as a chip manufacturer in all ways. But

147
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,005
Speaker 6:  The only difference is they don't sell the chips.

148
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,365
Speaker 2:  That's what I was just about to say.

149
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:30,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They sell computers that have the chips. Right? You cannot

150
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:33,645
Speaker 6:  go to Apple and be like, I wanna run a server farm. Right? Gimme your chips

151
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:37,045
Speaker 6:  so that I can put 'em in there. Like they're not competing with Intel and

152
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:40,845
Speaker 6:  TSMC and and the others that are fabricators and also You know

153
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:43,405
Speaker 6:  building server chips and all this stuff. They are building their products

154
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,485
Speaker 6:  chips for their products that they sell either directly to businesses or

155
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,325
Speaker 6:  to consumers as a fully fledged product. So like that's how it

156
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:54,085
Speaker 6:  is a Mac event. Like yes, they were flexing about their chips, but the only

157
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:56,965
Speaker 6:  way to get these chips is in a Mac and there's no other way to get it

158
00:08:57,225 --> 00:09:01,125
Speaker 5:  Dan. I need it to be the chips scenario. 'cause otherwise we're gonna

159
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,525
Speaker 5:  be like doing 8:00 PM Mac events for the rest of our lives.

160
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:08,965
Speaker 2:  I'm with Dan. I I think if you made me bet $50 right

161
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,965
Speaker 2:  now on what time will the iPhone event be next year? I'm gonna say it's,

162
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:14,085
Speaker 2:  it's e evening East coast time.

163
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:17,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. 'cause You know what evening east coast time is. It's not the middle

164
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:21,805
Speaker 6:  of the workday. Yeah, like, like for us it's our job to watch it. We

165
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:25,645
Speaker 6:  stopped our whole workday many workdays to focus on it and to to

166
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:29,525
Speaker 6:  plan for it and stuff like that. But for most people it's like you were

167
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:31,525
Speaker 6:  sneaking it in the middle of your workday.

168
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:35,005
Speaker 5:  Before I was a journalist, that was one of my favorite things was like middle

169
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:38,325
Speaker 5:  of the workday I'd be like, oh I'm gonna take my lunch and watch an Apple

170
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:38,645
Speaker 5:  event.

171
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:42,045
Speaker 2:  It's so that Apple can make sure its employees work the whole day and then

172
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:45,805
Speaker 2:  watch the Apple event. It's really, this is about Apple Park getting its

173
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:48,845
Speaker 2:  full productive use All. right. Let's move on. So I. Think I agree. It was

174
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:52,405
Speaker 2:  odd but I also suspect this will not be the last time Apple does this. But

175
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:55,805
Speaker 2:  let's, let's talk about the chips. So we got the the M three, the M three

176
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,845
Speaker 2:  PRO and the M three Max. This is the first time Apple has launched the whole

177
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:02,045
Speaker 2:  family of chips all at once, which I thought was very interesting. Dan, we

178
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:04,485
Speaker 2:  were talking just before we started recording and you were saying basically

179
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:08,565
Speaker 2:  that the story of these chips is slightly

180
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,765
Speaker 2:  more complicated than usual. It's not just kind of the good,

181
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:14,085
Speaker 2:  better, best it has been in the past.

182
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:18,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so the typical rollout for M Chipps, at least for the M one and the

183
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:21,325
Speaker 6:  M two generations was Apple would come out with the M base model and then

184
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:23,845
Speaker 6:  six months, 12 months later that you'd have the M three pro, the M three

185
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,645
Speaker 6:  Max and then eventually the M three Ultra and each one would build upon it.

186
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:30,685
Speaker 6:  So the unique thing here is that the M three, like you said,

187
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:34,205
Speaker 6:  David is all rolling out at the same time. But there is some like

188
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:38,365
Speaker 6:  real weirdness once you get into the pro and the Max because

189
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:42,285
Speaker 6:  not only are there M three PRO and M three Max, but there's also like M three

190
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:45,885
Speaker 6:  PRO with a certain number of cores on it and then M three Pro with more cores

191
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:49,245
Speaker 6:  on it and then M three Max with a certain number of cores and M three Max

192
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:53,005
Speaker 6:  with more cores on it. And that will determine how many

193
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:56,725
Speaker 6:  features each one of them has And what capabilities it has. So if you want

194
00:10:56,725 --> 00:11:00,605
Speaker 6:  the absolute best CPU, you have to get the M three Max with the

195
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:04,405
Speaker 6:  best GPU, which wasn't always the case in the past. Okay. The way

196
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:08,485
Speaker 6:  that Apple split the power cores and the efficiency cores

197
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:12,605
Speaker 6:  is not linear anymore. The M three PRO has a 12

198
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:16,405
Speaker 6:  core CPU on it and six of those are efficiency cores and six are

199
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:19,925
Speaker 6:  performance cores. And then the M three Max does like 12

200
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:23,805
Speaker 6:  performance cores and then four efficiencies cores. So in

201
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:27,525
Speaker 6:  prior models it was like a linear thing and you had the same

202
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:31,485
Speaker 6:  ratio of performance and efficiency cores in the pro and the Max chips. But

203
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:34,925
Speaker 6:  that's upended now. We'll have to see how that shakes out in the real world

204
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:38,485
Speaker 6:  And, what that performance means. But it is just more

205
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:42,365
Speaker 6:  stuff you have to think about and consider when you're, when you're buying

206
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:42,525
Speaker 6:  these,

207
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:46,765
Speaker 5:  I like this 'cause ultimately it's not gonna be more stuff for most people

208
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:49,645
Speaker 5:  listening to this. 'cause ideally a bunch of people are gonna get ahold of

209
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:52,645
Speaker 5:  these things and benchmark them and you're gonna get a better sense of which

210
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,405
Speaker 5:  is the right one for you. But I like, it feels like the company is

211
00:11:56,485 --> 00:12:00,285
Speaker 5:  thinking more as being more thoughtful about their processor design by

212
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,405
Speaker 5:  by adjusting the amount of efficiency of cores. 'cause if you've got the

213
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:06,965
Speaker 5:  Max, that's like the biggest one, right? It's equivalent of the AMD thread

214
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:10,845
Speaker 5:  ripper or something like that. Yeah. You don't necessarily want energy

215
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:12,285
Speaker 5:  efficiency there, right?

216
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:14,125
Speaker 2:  You're buying that for like raw power.

217
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:18,045
Speaker 6:  You're buying it for raw power. Sure. But if you're buying a pro

218
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,805
Speaker 6:  as opposed to the standard M three because that's the other thing is now

219
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,205
Speaker 6:  the standard M three is part of the MacBook Pro line. So if you're stepping

220
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:29,045
Speaker 6:  up to the M three Pro for reasons, one of those reasons

221
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:32,925
Speaker 6:  is probably power. And I will tell you from personal experience with

222
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,845
Speaker 6:  a standard M Chipp versus an M Pro chip, I can Max out

223
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:40,285
Speaker 6:  those performance scores on a standard M chipp pretty easily with simple

224
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:43,285
Speaker 6:  workloads in Lightroom and stuff like that. And the extra performance scores

225
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:46,645
Speaker 6:  in the M Pro chip allows me to have the headroom where I do not maximum out

226
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:49,725
Speaker 6:  or if I do Max amount that's for a shorter amount of time and stuff like

227
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:53,605
Speaker 6:  that. If I run a Lightroom export on an M series, MacBook

228
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:57,485
Speaker 6:  Air, that computer is, I can't do anything with it until that export is done.

229
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,325
Speaker 6:  Whereas my M one Pro, even a two year old M one Pro allows me to run

230
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:04,125
Speaker 6:  an export and do other things. It allows me to do more quote professional

231
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:08,045
Speaker 6:  tasks. But if the new chips don't have as many

232
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:11,965
Speaker 6:  performance scores, then that might change that equation. But it's hard

233
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,405
Speaker 6:  to say without actually testing all of them.

234
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:17,765
Speaker 5:  I mean it's still fairly linear from the regular to the pro.

235
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:22,005
Speaker 2:  You're right Alex that there is still some measure of like good,

236
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:25,885
Speaker 2:  better, best going on. It's just that the kind of leap from one to

237
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,525
Speaker 2:  the next is maybe less clear to me than before. What I have a hard time with

238
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:33,365
Speaker 2:  is seeing where I would want the base chip. Like why would I buy

239
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:36,925
Speaker 2:  the entry level 14 inch MacBook Pro? Yeah. I guess is a question we've been

240
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:40,005
Speaker 2:  asking for a while because the MacBook Air has gotten so good, but for me

241
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:43,565
Speaker 2:  it's like I see why the top end

242
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,165
Speaker 2:  computer here, the 16 inch MacBook Pro, you've got 128 gigs of unified memory

243
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:52,285
Speaker 2:  like the 40 core GP, this thing costs, what is it? Like $7,200? Like?

244
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:55,925
Speaker 2:  Like hell yeah. Fully loaded. Yeah. I see why that computer kicks ass.

245
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:59,925
Speaker 2:  What I don't understand is this sort of middle ground of

246
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:04,205
Speaker 2:  everything is more powerful but not

247
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:07,925
Speaker 2:  necessarily sort of dramatically. So in some ways here,

248
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:11,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think we should talk about this base model. 'cause this base model

249
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:14,885
Speaker 6:  is really the the new thing in the lineup. The others, the M three PRO and

250
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:18,165
Speaker 6:  the M three Max are upgrades of the M two pro. But now we have this base

251
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:22,125
Speaker 6:  model 14 inch MacBook Pro with the M three standard ship

252
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:24,445
Speaker 2:  And the 13 inch is dead. Dead now, right? 13

253
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,405
Speaker 6:  Inch is dead and gone. Okay, goodbye touch bar. Cranz loves the touch bar.

254
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:28,165
Speaker 6:  Sorry Cranz.

255
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:30,605
Speaker 5:  I love the idea of the touch bar. Let's be clear.

256
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:35,885
Speaker 6:  The idea, great execution, not so much now it's gone. So now the pro

257
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:39,845
Speaker 6:  line starts at $1,600, which is a $400 price drop from

258
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,805
Speaker 6:  where it started with the M two generation. But that

259
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:47,645
Speaker 6:  $1,600 computer comes with a base M three chip, not a pro or a Max chip.

260
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:51,085
Speaker 6:  And it's got other compromise in it. It has eight gigs of RAM for

261
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:55,005
Speaker 6:  $1,600, it has fewer ports on it. They took

262
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:58,765
Speaker 6:  away A-U-S-B-C port so there's none on the right hand side. So it's

263
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,645
Speaker 6:  really basically set up like a MacBook Air except with an HDMI port

264
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:03,645
Speaker 6:  and an SD card slot.

265
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,805
Speaker 2:  I mean there's all kinds of little things like that. It doesn't, yeah, it's

266
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:09,445
Speaker 2:  not fully like Thunderbolt four certified right in its

267
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,645
Speaker 2:  like, and again, I just, I just wanna say this again one more time for emphasis

268
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:16,365
Speaker 2:  it's $1,600 and it has eight gigs of ram. Yeah that is

269
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:20,485
Speaker 2:  ludicrous. Like that should not be allowed. Apple should be ashamed of itself

270
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,765
Speaker 2:  for trying to sell that to people

271
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:26,005
Speaker 6:  And like Apple's line is that unified memory is more efficient and you don't

272
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,885
Speaker 6:  need as much. But my retort to that is you can hit

273
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:33,445
Speaker 6:  swap very easily on an eight gigabyte. Oh yeah. Mac, I've done it. We've

274
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:37,365
Speaker 6:  done it in testing. I hit swap on my 16 gig Mac all the time. And you do

275
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:40,885
Speaker 6:  notice when that happens. And then if eight gig was all anyone needed, why

276
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:44,085
Speaker 6:  are you selling 16 gig and 24 gig upgrades for 200 and $400

277
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:48,125
Speaker 6:  anyways? So now you have this computer at $1,600

278
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:52,485
Speaker 6:  that is right next to the price of the 15 inch MacBook Air that

279
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:56,445
Speaker 6:  has a larger screen, a lighter chassis, thinner design, all that

280
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:59,565
Speaker 6:  stuff. It's a little bit cheaper. But the question is like now you have even

281
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:02,805
Speaker 6:  more of a confusion of like what do you go for? Like if you wanted, prior

282
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:06,765
Speaker 6:  to this, if you wanted the Good Pro computers, you started at $2,000, you

283
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,645
Speaker 6:  got a faster processor, more capable, more ports, all the whole nine yards

284
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:13,725
Speaker 6:  and you got the great display and all that kind of stuff. Now the main difference

285
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:16,005
Speaker 6:  is the screen and an HDMI port.

286
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:19,885
Speaker 5:  I mean that's often been the big difference between the MacBook Air and the

287
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:23,725
Speaker 5:  MacBook Pro. Like historically that was the primary difference was

288
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:27,565
Speaker 5:  not the processors but the display and, and people were like, yeah, I wanna

289
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:31,405
Speaker 5:  play more for prettier display because So I like I think that makes

290
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:35,205
Speaker 5:  a lot of sense. I honestly, I think this positioning makes sense because

291
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:39,165
Speaker 5:  it's saying look, if you, if you care just about lightness and good

292
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,045
Speaker 5:  battery life, go get one of the two heirs or maybe wait until

293
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,925
Speaker 5:  they release the M three version of those errors. But go get those errors

294
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:49,605
Speaker 5:  and then if you actually want like a better display, if you want the good

295
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:52,925
Speaker 5:  display, then you can get better battery life in similar

296
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:57,045
Speaker 5:  speeds for similar price and get the the MacBook

297
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,885
Speaker 5:  Pro the base model. I

298
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,805
Speaker 2:  Think that theory made a lot more sense to me like six

299
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:06,725
Speaker 2:  years ago when the AIRS screen was pretty crappy.

300
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:10,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's now you're going from like very good screen to even better screen,

301
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:13,965
Speaker 2:  which is again like I think Apple would be happy with the outcome of this

302
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,645
Speaker 2:  conversation being most people should still buy MacBook Airs. Like I think

303
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,885
Speaker 2:  most people still do buy MacBook Airs and that's all fine and good to me

304
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:23,685
Speaker 2:  it's just like the MacBook Pro is sort of inexorably moving

305
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:27,125
Speaker 2:  towards being the Mac Pro. I think that it's just gonna get higher and higher

306
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,765
Speaker 2:  and higher end. But Apple cannot let go of this idea that they're like, we

307
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:34,085
Speaker 2:  have to have one that is under $2,000. Yeah. And it's like just don't just

308
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:36,125
Speaker 2:  get rid of it. It's the air. It's fine. The

309
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,365
Speaker 6:  Theory for the longest time was that they kept around that stupid 13 inch

310
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:43,245
Speaker 6:  MacBook Pro because this is quote a theory that businesses will

311
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,725
Speaker 6:  only buy a computer if it has pro in its name and they don't actually care

312
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:48,485
Speaker 6:  about the specs or whatever. And so they want the cheapest one that has pro

313
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,645
Speaker 6:  in the name. And so now the cheapest one with pro in the name is $1,600.

314
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:55,885
Speaker 6:  It's up from $1,300 on the 13 inch model. I would argue that

315
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:59,365
Speaker 6:  like that makes sense. It's a much better computer and that is who's buying

316
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:03,205
Speaker 6:  this? So it's like almost not even a consumer pitch. And you

317
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:06,965
Speaker 6:  can see that in ways where like you don't get the new color option,

318
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:10,925
Speaker 6:  which is not really a color, but you don't get that option on the base model.

319
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:15,045
Speaker 6:  And you like if you buy the 16 inch model and then

320
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:18,885
Speaker 6:  you do upgrade the ram, you're at 1800 or $2,000 at that point you

321
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:22,085
Speaker 6:  might as well just buy the better processor and all that stuff. Ooh,

322
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,565
Speaker 5:  We're ignoring one thing. The airs all come base

323
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:29,605
Speaker 5:  2 56 gigabytes of storage. The pro comes base five

324
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:30,445
Speaker 5:  12. That's a

325
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:33,325
Speaker 6:  Fair point. Sure. But the airs start at $1,100.

326
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:37,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah, but so to get, they basically spend the same amount to boost the

327
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:37,805
Speaker 5:  storage.

328
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:41,445
Speaker 6:  Not quite, you don't get there. You, you get close to it, but it's still

329
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,445
Speaker 6:  cheaper. You get

330
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:46,085
Speaker 5:  Close enough that you're like, oh, if I spend a hundred dollars more, I get

331
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,245
Speaker 5:  a prettier display too kind of deal.

332
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:51,045
Speaker 6:  You get a smaller display and I would argue that that customer that really

333
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:54,965
Speaker 6:  cares that much or is looking at a 15 inch MacBook error is looking

334
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:58,285
Speaker 6:  at that because it has the bigger display and that actually matters more

335
00:18:58,285 --> 00:18:58,485
Speaker 6:  to them

336
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:01,485
Speaker 5:  Then why would we compare it to the 14 inch at all? Because

337
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:05,125
Speaker 6:  They're in the lineup there. This is modern apple where

338
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:08,885
Speaker 6:  it'll always be where at you're at one point and you're like, well if I just

339
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:12,325
Speaker 6:  spend a little bit more, yeah, I get more, oh now that I'm here,

340
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:16,765
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm at 1600. Well shoot, I really should get that 16 gigs of ram

341
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:19,965
Speaker 6:  because I'm spending almost $2,000 for this computer already. I want to last

342
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:23,685
Speaker 6:  a few years and stuff like that. Oh, now I'm at $1,800. This is how you step

343
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:27,485
Speaker 6:  your, you rationalize every single step and every single step.

344
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:31,645
Speaker 6:  The profit margins are bigger. And so like this is modern apple and this

345
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:32,925
Speaker 6:  is, this is how it goes with everything.

346
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:36,045
Speaker 5:  Okay. We talked about the eight gigabytes of ram and that's very offensive.

347
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:40,285
Speaker 5:  I do wanna talk like I'm, I'm still just thinking about that 256

348
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:43,685
Speaker 5:  gigabytes of storage minimum on the air. That's just,

349
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:46,165
Speaker 5:  that feels as bad as eight gigabytes.

350
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:49,725
Speaker 6:  I don't think that's as big of as a problem as some of these other constraints

351
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:53,645
Speaker 6:  on the pros for one, the air, if you think about how people use

352
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:56,285
Speaker 6:  computers these days, they're living in a browser. Most of their life lives

353
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:57,565
Speaker 6:  in the clouds. This is

354
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,085
Speaker 5:  Spoken like a man who doesn't hoard his data.

355
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:04,525
Speaker 6:  I I I hoard data. My computer is a terabyte drive. I've got seven terabytes

356
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:08,165
Speaker 6:  of drive plugged into it. Do not talk to me about hoarding data. I pay, I

357
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:12,005
Speaker 6:  pay a, a inordinate amount of fees for cloud storage in the terabytes of

358
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:15,645
Speaker 6:  range. But if I think about like a typical consumer buying the MacBook Air,

359
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:19,405
Speaker 6:  a student or someone who's just looking for a home computer or whatever,

360
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,405
Speaker 6:  most of their life is living in the cloud. They are living in a browser and

361
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:26,125
Speaker 6:  things like that. There aren't, they aren't storing a lot of stuff directly

362
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,445
Speaker 6:  on their driving. They don't even know

363
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:27,725
Speaker 5:  What files

364
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:31,725
Speaker 6:  Are. Exactly. So I, I I don't think that's a problem on the airs. When the

365
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:34,245
Speaker 6:  airs first launched, there was a lot of controversy about the speed of that

366
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:37,685
Speaker 6:  storage. I don't think that's a problem at that level either. But once you

367
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:41,445
Speaker 6:  add a pro to the name and once you step up to these price brackets, that

368
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:44,965
Speaker 6:  is where all of these considerations do matter and, and make differences

369
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,605
Speaker 6:  depending on the workload. If you're buying the pro computer and you're saying,

370
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,485
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna be editing images and video, I wanna be a creator, I wanna

371
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,885
Speaker 6:  pursue this and stuff like that, you will quickly run into these walls if

372
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:59,365
Speaker 6:  you stay with the base model. And that's just the reality of it.

373
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:02,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. My guess would be that the, the kind of

374
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:06,685
Speaker 2:  consistent choice for a lot of people here is gonna be the 14 inch

375
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:11,125
Speaker 2:  either pro or Max depending on the person. But like the 16

376
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,965
Speaker 2:  just feels like it's so much bigger and more expensive that you're gonna

377
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:18,045
Speaker 2:  lose some people. It's also just a Yeah, big machine. Like it's a it's heavy

378
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,525
Speaker 6:  Big computer. Yeah, you're pushing almost five pounds of that.

379
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:24,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But I think as the, as the like You know c creator tool for

380
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:28,285
Speaker 2:  people with expendable income, the 14 inch with the pro and the Max,

381
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:32,285
Speaker 2:  if, if it benchmarks the way we probably expect it to based on all

382
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:35,965
Speaker 2:  of Apple's unlabeled graphs that say it's faster. Do you see the one where

383
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:39,645
Speaker 2:  it was just like image processing two x and you're just like, what is that

384
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:43,485
Speaker 2:  app? That's nothing. You just said image processing two x, like that's,

385
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:45,685
Speaker 2:  and with a, with a swoopy line, they

386
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:49,445
Speaker 5:  Did have labels for the graphs, but it's very, very small

387
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:52,645
Speaker 5:  and like just a shade lighter than the background.

388
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,685
Speaker 6:  The y axis is those is relative performance. It

389
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:59,525
Speaker 2:  Said relative performance. That's nothing. Just don't even put words

390
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:00,285
Speaker 2:  there. Just

391
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,405
Speaker 6:  Draw lines floating out in space.

392
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:06,045
Speaker 5:  Look, I, I used to do this too. I would make charts and it would just be,

393
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:09,285
Speaker 5:  I'd just be like, people don't care about the actual speed. They just wanna

394
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:12,365
Speaker 5:  see a big number. And I got yelled at a lot for it.

395
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,485
Speaker 2:  But I just think the M three Pro, I'm just, I just specked this out while

396
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:20,365
Speaker 2:  we were talking here and you can get the 14 inch MacBook Pro with an M

397
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:24,165
Speaker 2:  three PRO 18 gigs of unified memory, five 12 gigs of storage,

398
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:28,165
Speaker 2:  blah blah blah. $2,000 on the dot. Yeah, it's, it's 1999.

399
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:30,925
Speaker 2:  I suspect that one is going to be the one that most people do. 'cause you're

400
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:34,285
Speaker 2:  gonna start with the base one and like you're talking about Dan just slowly

401
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:37,885
Speaker 2:  step your way up to that. Anyway, that's the one I think Apple wants to sell

402
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:38,045
Speaker 2:  you.

403
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:41,565
Speaker 6:  If history follows what happened with the M one PRO and the M two Pro, that's

404
00:22:41,565 --> 00:22:45,085
Speaker 6:  the one that's like gonna be in stores at Best Buy and B and H and all this

405
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:48,045
Speaker 6:  stuff. And they are gonna discount it by $200 when they put it on sale. And

406
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:51,725
Speaker 6:  then at $1,800 you have a hell of computer for $1,800. And I think a lot

407
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:54,605
Speaker 6:  of people can be really happy with it and they should not get the $1,600

408
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:55,205
Speaker 6:  base model.

409
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:58,365
Speaker 2:  Have you seen the Space Black one? Alex and I we're both very excited about

410
00:22:58,365 --> 00:22:59,685
Speaker 2:  this place. Black one. It's so pretty.

411
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:00,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's space dark gray.

412
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:05,525
Speaker 6:  I, I'm not gonna quote him exactly, but Jason Snell over at Six Colors had

413
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:07,965
Speaker 6:  a really great line about it in his piece. You should go check it out. But

414
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,765
Speaker 6:  him and I were kind of talking about it yesterday. It is just a darker version

415
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:14,765
Speaker 6:  of Space Gray. It is not really black. So if you have in your mind

416
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:19,005
Speaker 6:  that this is the return of the black book, which was that black plastic

417
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:22,885
Speaker 6:  MacBook from the mid two thousands, this is not it, it's,

418
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,005
Speaker 6:  it's still gray. It's

419
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:24,085
Speaker 2:  A

420
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:24,925
Speaker 5:  Shame. Nevermind

421
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:28,405
Speaker 6:  I, I know what to say. It's, it's another shade of gray. They are claiming

422
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:32,165
Speaker 6:  that this anodization is like supposed to be more

423
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:36,685
Speaker 6:  resistant to fingerprints and I did slap my palm on it and smear my fingers

424
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:39,965
Speaker 6:  around on it to try and see, but it was hard to tell if they actually remained

425
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:43,885
Speaker 6:  or not. I think once we have it in use and see if it's any better

426
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:46,925
Speaker 6:  than the midnight, 'cause the midnight grossed up almost immediately. This

427
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,685
Speaker 6:  might be slightly better.

428
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:50,645
Speaker 2:  Let's talk about the iMac for two minutes, which I think is as long as the

429
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:54,685
Speaker 2:  iMac deserves. I started out when Apple announced the iMac, which is

430
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:58,045
Speaker 2:  literally just the same damn computer, but they took out the old chip and

431
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:01,885
Speaker 2:  they put in the new chip, the end, no new accessories, no nothing, nothing.

432
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:05,685
Speaker 2:  Still Lightning keyboard. I was outraged by this. I'm still kind of

433
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:09,325
Speaker 2:  outraged by this, but I also now understand this And. what I think it is

434
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:13,325
Speaker 2:  is Apple believes that there are people who buy imax and that's a very specific

435
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:16,445
Speaker 2:  set of person And. what they are going to do is they're going to take their

436
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:20,645
Speaker 2:  11 year old iMac that they bought that runs an

437
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:23,845
Speaker 2:  Intel thing and no longer gets software updates and is basically falling

438
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:26,445
Speaker 2:  apart. They're gonna replace it with this one and they're gonna be very happy.

439
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:29,485
Speaker 2:  And I think they're right and I think that is like a sad way to think about

440
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:32,645
Speaker 2:  the iMac line at this point in time. But I think that's where we are.

441
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:36,485
Speaker 5:  The iMac was always there though. There was like the, the, the bit of time

442
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:40,405
Speaker 5:  where the iMac was used by kids and teens, but

443
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:44,165
Speaker 5:  for the most part it's always been like your parents' computer that they

444
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:46,605
Speaker 5:  keep in their computer room because they're the ones that still have computer

445
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:46,885
Speaker 5:  rooms.

446
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:51,365
Speaker 6:  Yes, it served the role as the shared family computer or the home computer.

447
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:55,645
Speaker 6:  And I would argue that at this point that is an increasingly shrinking

448
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:59,685
Speaker 6:  audience and does not exist for the reality of most modern families

449
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:03,445
Speaker 6:  or modern homes. People have moved on to personal devices whether they're

450
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:07,325
Speaker 6:  Chromebooks or laptops or iPhones or tablets or whatever. So

451
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:11,325
Speaker 6:  it makes sense to me that they are not throwing lots of investment at the

452
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:14,605
Speaker 6:  iMac like David said. I agree. Like we don't have an iMac Pro because the

453
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:18,165
Speaker 6:  Mac studio exists and the Mac Pro exists and that serves those customers

454
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:21,725
Speaker 6:  better because they can swap out that computer without having to like deal

455
00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:25,645
Speaker 6:  with the whole thing. And the audience for

456
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:29,765
Speaker 6:  imax, which we all know, is you go into a spa or a fancy

457
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:33,725
Speaker 6:  doctor's office or whatever and they are sitting there on the desk as they're

458
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:35,605
Speaker 6:  checking computers. Yes. At the reception

459
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:38,645
Speaker 2:  Or your kitchen according to Apple, while you cook, you just like hang out

460
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:40,165
Speaker 2:  on your iMac like a super cool guy.

461
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:44,245
Speaker 6:  Same. Yeah, I, I can't wait to read divorce notes of like the husband insisted

462
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:47,885
Speaker 6:  on putting the iMac in the kitchen so they got to, the wife was like, this

463
00:25:47,885 --> 00:25:51,365
Speaker 6:  is invading my space. But yeah, that's the reality of it. So what we got

464
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,725
Speaker 6:  is You know, I'm glad that they didn't completely ignore the iMac like they

465
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:57,765
Speaker 6:  have for two and a half years that they did put a faster chip in it. But

466
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,965
Speaker 6:  everything else is exactly the same. It would've been great to have USBC

467
00:26:00,965 --> 00:26:03,965
Speaker 6:  accessories 'cause I would've heavily replaced some of my older accessories.

468
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:04,685
Speaker 6:  These

469
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:08,965
Speaker 5:  Prices are goofy if I'm reading this correctly. The base

470
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:11,165
Speaker 5:  model iMac doesn't have USB ports.

471
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:14,765
Speaker 6:  It has two instead of four. So the base model,

472
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,205
Speaker 6:  this is the same as the M one generation. It has two US BBC ports on the

473
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:21,965
Speaker 6:  back. If you upgrade the processor to the higher bin version or whatever

474
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:22,925
Speaker 6:  it jumps up to four.

475
00:26:23,345 --> 00:26:23,965
Speaker 5:  That's goofy.

476
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,365
Speaker 2:  Goofy All, right? We have spent now exactly as long talking about the event

477
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:31,045
Speaker 2:  as the event was itself. So we're, we're done here. This, this event deserves.

478
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:34,885
Speaker 2:  So more thank you guys. Dan, I'm assuming we will have reviews

479
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,805
Speaker 2:  of these at some point in the hopefully not to distant in future. So stay

480
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,045
Speaker 2:  tuned for that. Stay tuned.

481
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:39,205
Speaker 6:  Yep.

482
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:41,925
Speaker 2:  Thank you both. We gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and

483
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:44,925
Speaker 2:  we're gonna talk about cameras like iPhones, which shoot events sometimes

484
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:46,485
Speaker 2:  at night. We'll be back

485
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:54,565
Speaker 3:  Support for this episode comes from Sonos. Me and the rest of The Vergecast

486
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:57,605
Speaker 3:  team are all audio professionals. And at The Verge we have an office full

487
00:26:57,605 --> 00:27:01,125
Speaker 3:  of Sonos products. Personally I use the Sonos era 300 in

488
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:05,325
Speaker 3:  particular a lot. It's an all-in-one plugin smart speaker designed for immersive

489
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,165
Speaker 3:  sound and spatial audio listening out loud. Its breakthrough acoustic design

490
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:12,565
Speaker 3:  projects sound from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, allowing listeners

491
00:27:12,585 --> 00:27:15,925
Speaker 3:  to feel like the music and sound is all around them no matter where you are

492
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,405
Speaker 3:  in the room or what you play. The listening experiences. Nothing short of

493
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:23,045
Speaker 3:  extraordinary. For a full immersive home theater experience, you could take

494
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:26,885
Speaker 3:  two era three hundreds and use them as your Dolby Atmos surround speakers

495
00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:30,805
Speaker 3:  when paired with an arc or beam and my favorite feature, it actually has

496
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:34,565
Speaker 3:  a three and a half millimeter Jack So I can plug in literally anything to

497
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:38,365
Speaker 3:  this device. You can also connect the ERA 300 to a turntable CD

498
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:42,285
Speaker 3:  player or other audio device using the USBC port. Also know speakers

499
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,365
Speaker 3:  connect wirelessly over wifi so you can group speakers in different rooms

500
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:49,645

502
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:01,225
Speaker 2:  We're back right at the end of the Apple thing. The other night there was

503
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:04,345
Speaker 2:  this little notice on the stream that said the event had been shot on an

504
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:07,945
Speaker 2:  iPhone, an iPhone 15 pro Max I think and

505
00:28:08,005 --> 00:28:11,625
Speaker 2:  edited on a Mac, which is impressive given all the dark shots and

506
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:15,585
Speaker 2:  swoopy drone stuff and the huge empty rooms and the tricky camera moves.

507
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:19,345
Speaker 2:  It was a pretty good flex from Apple. But how big a flex

508
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:23,265
Speaker 2:  really? That's the question for me. The event was shot on an iPhone, but

509
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:27,025
Speaker 2:  as we saw in some of the behind the scenes footage, it was an iPhone plus

510
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:31,025
Speaker 2:  like a room full of giant lights and a bunch of drones and gimbals

511
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:35,145
Speaker 2:  and much more. They didn't just like put the phone in video mode and pointed

512
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:38,385
Speaker 2:  at Tim Cook You. know what I mean? And I don't mean that as a dig. That's

513
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:42,185
Speaker 2:  not how anyone ever shoots anything professional. And this is still really

514
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:45,785
Speaker 2:  cool. And actually one of the things I thought was interesting was one of

515
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:49,505
Speaker 2:  the folks who produced the event said that it was remarkable how not different

516
00:28:49,505 --> 00:28:52,745
Speaker 2:  it was to use the iPhone. Here's a clip from the behind the scenes shot.

517
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:57,025
Speaker 7:  We're able to get the same complex shots on such a small device similar

518
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:00,625
Speaker 7:  to how we would do any traditional camera. We're on cranes,

519
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:02,505
Speaker 7:  dollies, drone shots,

520
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:03,705
Speaker 3:  Drones going up.

521
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:09,505
Speaker 2:  This all raises a question we've been kind of asking all year, how

522
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:13,625
Speaker 2:  good are smartphone cameras really? Have they gotten so

523
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:17,305
Speaker 2:  good over the last 15 years that we've stopped noticing the ways they keep

524
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:21,145
Speaker 2:  getting better but they continue to be mind blowing. Are they going

525
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:24,945
Speaker 2:  to be as good as or better than big pro level cameras anytime

526
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:28,385
Speaker 2:  soon? We've been made these grand promises about the evolution of smartphone

527
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:32,265
Speaker 2:  cameras. Where are we on that road to figure that out? I grabbed Becca

528
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:36,065
Speaker 2:  Farsace who has been running around all summer and fall taking photos and

529
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,185
Speaker 2:  video with all of these new high-end smartphones. And we're gonna get to

530
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:42,085
Speaker 2:  the bottom of this Becca Welcome back to The Vergecast. Thanks

531
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:42,565
Speaker 8:  For having me.

532
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:46,645
Speaker 2:  Let's talk cameras. 'cause you've been doing tests of really the

533
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:49,125
Speaker 2:  iPhone and the Pixel are the two I'm I'm most curious about. And I think

534
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:53,365
Speaker 2:  the biggest question that I've had over the course of this year is

535
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:56,685
Speaker 2:  where are we in smartphone cameras? I feel like we've, we've been on this

536
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:59,925
Speaker 2:  trend of like smartphone cameras are getting really good, really fast, better

537
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:03,765
Speaker 2:  every year. They're eventually going to be as good as pro cameras. Just you

538
00:30:03,765 --> 00:30:07,285
Speaker 2:  wait, it's, and I feel like that idea has really aggressively plateaued for

539
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,885
Speaker 2:  me the last couple of years. But then Apple comes out and they're like, it's

540
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:13,685
Speaker 2:  the most pro whenever you can You know, use video out through USBC. This

541
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:16,005
Speaker 2:  is a pro camera. Where are we in smartphone cameras.

542
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:20,765
Speaker 8:  Okay, question for you. When was the last time you were impressed with the

543
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:21,325
Speaker 8:  smartphone camera?

544
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:25,645
Speaker 2:  Like truly like blown away, impressed. I think the,

545
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:29,645
Speaker 2:  the cinematic mode on the iPhone was the first one in a long

546
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:32,165
Speaker 2:  time. It had been a while before that, but the cinematic mode on the iPhone

547
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:35,325
Speaker 2:  was a moment that I was like, holy crap, this takes a thing I couldn't do

548
00:30:35,325 --> 00:30:38,965
Speaker 2:  before and works. I can now. All of my like

549
00:30:39,015 --> 00:30:42,565
Speaker 2:  awful video walking down the street now looks passable.

550
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:46,085
Speaker 2:  But just in terms of like the photos I get out of a phone, it's been years.

551
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,245
Speaker 8:  Okay. Talk to me about cinematic mode. Do you still use it

552
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:52,285
Speaker 2:  Occasionally? It's one of those things that I use when I remember to turn

553
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:55,325
Speaker 2:  it on. Okay. Which I think is the problem with a lot of phone cameras is

554
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:59,125
Speaker 2:  they have a lot of cool features that are six swipes away and thus I

555
00:30:59,125 --> 00:30:59,725
Speaker 2:  don't use them.

556
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:03,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And that's something about the Pixel eight pro and the Pixel

557
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:07,005
Speaker 8:  eights camera system that I will we'll talk about in a bit. Okay. Interesting.

558
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:10,885
Speaker 8:  Cinematic mode. Okay. And And that basically cinematic mode applies a blur

559
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:13,805
Speaker 8:  effect to the background of your videos. It makes them look a bit more what

560
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,645
Speaker 8:  some would call professional. It came in the iPhone 13 I believe.

561
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:18,765
Speaker 8:  Maybe just the pro,

562
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:22,365
Speaker 2:  I think it started in the pro and has since worked its way down. Yeah. And

563
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:24,885
Speaker 2:  it like stabilizes things as you're walking. It just, it just feels,

564
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:26,565
Speaker 8:  Adds a little bit of a color look better.

565
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:29,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. And so all the things where you're like, I want, I wanna walk

566
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:32,645
Speaker 2:  through something as I'm taking video and it used to just feel jumpy and

567
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:35,885
Speaker 2:  bad. It smooths it out in a way that like I will actually watch those videos

568
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,285
Speaker 2:  later.

569
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:40,445
Speaker 8:  Cool. And that's a software? Yeah that That's software. Yeah. Okay. So really

570
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:43,285
Speaker 8:  you weren't impressed with the camera, you were just impressed with software.

571
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:44,685
Speaker 8:  That's fair. That this company added. That's fair. Yeah.

572
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:44,965
Speaker 2:  Okay.

573
00:31:44,965 --> 00:31:48,605
Speaker 8:  That's fair. Hardware side of things. It is very slow. But the way I look

574
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:51,645
Speaker 8:  at it, like I think You know you entered this question kind of comparing

575
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:55,485
Speaker 8:  them to You know standalone cameras, cameras that have interchangeable lenses

576
00:31:55,585 --> 00:31:58,965
Speaker 8:  or that we only use to take photos and there's just really no comparison

577
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:03,005
Speaker 8:  to me because the experience is so different. Okay. Like when I pick

578
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,445
Speaker 8:  up a smartphone to take a photo, like it feels like I'm picking up a brick

579
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:09,445
Speaker 8:  and I'm pointing it at someone and they know the etiquette, they know what

580
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:13,565
Speaker 8:  to do. But when I pick up like a camera that's made to take photos, it

581
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:17,365
Speaker 8:  feels different. I feel like my purpose is to only take photos and the person

582
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:20,805
Speaker 8:  who's standing in front of me all of a sudden is a lot more nervous. And

583
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,645
Speaker 8:  so they're two like very different things. So now if we talk about

584
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:28,245
Speaker 8:  just phones and their cameras, do we think that they are

585
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:32,285
Speaker 8:  progressing me meaningfully? Maybe like every three years. Okay.

586
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:36,445
Speaker 8:  Every three years. I feel like if you look at like the iPhone 12

587
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:40,005
Speaker 8:  and you compare it to the 15, there is a big difference in quality.

588
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:43,085
Speaker 8:  That's fair. And I, I would know because I use an iPhone 12. Nice.

589
00:32:44,265 --> 00:32:48,125
Speaker 8:  But if I look at the 14 to the 15, yeah, no, you're not gonna notice a

590
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:48,445
Speaker 8:  difference.

591
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,885
Speaker 2:  Right. And I guess that's fair. I mean that's like the upgrade cycle of a

592
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,045
Speaker 2:  phone now, right? Yes. People are keeping them for three, four, or five years.

593
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:56,365
Speaker 2:  So if, if you're feeling that upgrade every time you actually upgrade your

594
00:32:56,365 --> 00:33:00,245
Speaker 2:  phone, maybe that still counts. But I just can't let go of this idea that

595
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:04,325
Speaker 2:  for, I don't know, the last say eight years, we have been told it's sort

596
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:08,205
Speaker 2:  of right around the corner where your phone's photos are going to

597
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:11,885
Speaker 2:  be possibly the same as what you'd get from A-D-S-L-R or

598
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:15,645
Speaker 2:  a Fuji Street camera that people run around with for thousands of dollars

599
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:16,605
Speaker 2:  or whatever. I

600
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:18,525
Speaker 8:  Love the Fuji Street camera. I love that one. This is what I

601
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:20,925
Speaker 2:  Call that, that I don't like. There's a million of them and they're, they're

602
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:24,565
Speaker 2:  all X one whatever. They're just the Fuji Street camera. But I just don't

603
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:27,125
Speaker 2:  feel like we're getting closer to that at this point. I feel like we're teaching

604
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:30,405
Speaker 2:  these cameras to do new things on smartphone, which are cool. But just in

605
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:34,285
Speaker 2:  terms of like how my photos and videos look, I don't

606
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:37,445
Speaker 2:  necessarily feel like I've gotten much closer to,

607
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:41,445
Speaker 2:  I truly won't miss my camera in a while.

608
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:45,485
Speaker 8:  Okay. Back to your point about like forgetting to turn on cinematic mode.

609
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:49,645
Speaker 8:  There are settings if, let's talk about the iPhone for a moment. Sure. 'cause

610
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:53,565
Speaker 8:  I think it actually, I do think the iPhone 15 pros camera comes close

611
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:57,525
Speaker 8:  in some ways Okay. To some standalone cameras, but you have to be

612
00:33:57,525 --> 00:34:01,485
Speaker 8:  willing to click some buttons. Okay. And I don't think you're gonna

613
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:05,205
Speaker 8:  be that person. And I don't think phones are like, I don't think they're

614
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:09,165
Speaker 8:  trying to have you pick it up and like take the photo that maybe

615
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:12,845
Speaker 8:  you imagine that a standalone camera takes, right? That's right. You have

616
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:15,805
Speaker 8:  to like go in and and tune some things. Right. Which

617
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:19,245
Speaker 2:  Again goes back to your point about like the object itself. Like you just

618
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:22,845
Speaker 2:  have all that stuff one thumb movement away when you pick up

619
00:34:23,165 --> 00:34:26,445
Speaker 2:  a big camera in a way that on your phone it's actually like buried in settings,

620
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:27,045
Speaker 2:  venues. Yeah.

621
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:30,925
Speaker 8:  Buried in settings. And also not one thumb. Yeah. My God. I mean these

622
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:34,605
Speaker 8:  things are huge. Like I had tiny hands and reaching across the screen sucks

623
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:38,325
Speaker 8:  and, and I'm less likely to push buttons that are across the screen. So let's

624
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:39,085
Speaker 8:  make them small.

625
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:43,165
Speaker 2:  Okay. So like what would, what do you do on the 15 pro to get

626
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:43,285
Speaker 2:  there?

627
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:47,285
Speaker 8:  Oh, I'm so excited. Let me tell you about it. Please. So there is like a

628
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:51,005
Speaker 8:  48 megapixel mode, right. And you can turn that on and you can take a photo

629
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:54,965
Speaker 8:  like I find faces. It's gonna find faces. It's like it loves faces. Yep.

630
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:58,805
Speaker 8:  And if you are say like five feet away from somebody and then

631
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:03,085
Speaker 8:  the, the background is like far beyond them, you'll actually start to get

632
00:35:03,085 --> 00:35:06,725
Speaker 8:  some depth. Like some, some like natural depth because the sensors are

633
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:10,645
Speaker 8:  actually getting bigger and the lenses are bigger and You know, like

634
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,285
Speaker 8:  real camera things are starting to happen. And

635
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:16,285
Speaker 2:  So much of that is physics. Like you need space for those things.

636
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:20,085
Speaker 8:  Real physics. Yeah. Yeah. Can I explain it? Well, some days

637
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,125
Speaker 2:  I know big sensors good

638
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:26,205
Speaker 8:  Big sensor good. Bigger lenses. Good. Got that. Sometimes more

639
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:30,125
Speaker 8:  megapixels fine. Yeah. But yeah, you're starting to get like some

640
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:34,085
Speaker 8:  real depth. I especially notice it if I, if I turn on like You

641
00:35:34,085 --> 00:35:37,965
Speaker 8:  know raw photos, 48 megapixels, blah blah blah. And I flip the

642
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:41,765
Speaker 8:  camera around and I take a photo of myself with the main camera, like

643
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:45,725
Speaker 8:  that distance from like, I don't know, maybe that's two feet on me that

644
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:49,445
Speaker 8:  like I'm gonna actually see depth and you can compare that to like You know

645
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:53,005
Speaker 8:  some of the, the lower end Sony cameras. Okay. And it's like

646
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:57,005
Speaker 8:  not terribly far off. You know something that has like a smaller sensor

647
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:00,525
Speaker 8:  like an AP PSC sensor. Like it's looking pretty good and the colors

648
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:04,885
Speaker 8:  are really nice. I mean Apple has always kind of had really

649
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:08,565
Speaker 8:  great color science. Yeah. And, and so it's just like for me I love like

650
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:12,605
Speaker 8:  a little bit more blue and so like denim, oh my God. The way it reproduces

651
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:16,125
Speaker 8:  denim. I'm just like, wow, I'm gonna wear this denim jacket every day.

652
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:19,645
Speaker 2:  So All. right. Well what else? I feel like to me the thing on the 15 that

653
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,445
Speaker 2:  has actually been the biggest improvement is the fact that you can now do

654
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:26,205
Speaker 2:  portrait after. Which goes back to your point of like, I don't have to remember

655
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:30,685
Speaker 2:  the thing anymore. I can just take the picture and figure out what

656
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:34,005
Speaker 2:  to do with it later. Yeah. Which is a weird, like, we like to talk about

657
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:36,965
Speaker 2:  what is a photo? There's like a weird philosophical question behind all that.

658
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:40,565
Speaker 2:  But just like leaving that aside, it's nice that I don't have to sit there

659
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,845
Speaker 2:  and go, oh I have two seconds to get this like cute photo of my dog doing

660
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:46,805
Speaker 2:  a funny thing. I don't have to swipe it to portrait and then try to, it says

661
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,045
Speaker 2:  like back up. You're too close. And then I have to and I've just missed it.

662
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:51,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Now you just take the picture and it does the thing sometimes,

663
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:52,125
Speaker 8:  But Yeah. Most

664
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:55,885
Speaker 2:  The time. Yeah. But I wonder how much we can put that in

665
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:58,805
Speaker 2:  software because like you Yeah. You spend a lot of time, one of my favorite

666
00:36:58,805 --> 00:37:02,725
Speaker 2:  things is to be in The Verge office and just watch you or

667
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:06,165
Speaker 2:  someone else on the video team set up a camera because it's such a good reminder

668
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:09,885
Speaker 2:  of like, you like that there's so much time of just you, you hit a button

669
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:12,165
Speaker 2:  and then you look at the screen and you look at the histogram, you're like,

670
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:15,285
Speaker 2:  Hmm, that's not it. And then you hit more buttons and it's just like there's

671
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:18,365
Speaker 2:  work that goes into doing this stuff that all these companies are trying

672
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:22,165
Speaker 2:  to abstract out. Yeah. On your phone. I wonder how possible that is

673
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:26,085
Speaker 2:  ever going to be and if the, if the answer is just give people more knobs,

674
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:29,165
Speaker 2:  now we're back to like the user interface for that on a phone is just never

675
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,165
Speaker 2:  quite gonna work.

676
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:34,405
Speaker 8:  I think it can get really good. It can get really good and I, I see a world

677
00:37:34,495 --> 00:37:37,965
Speaker 8:  where You know the iPhone starts suggesting more like try

678
00:37:38,365 --> 00:37:41,645
Speaker 8:  portrait mode on this. So it's like even more like you're not thinking about

679
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:45,085
Speaker 8:  it. I mean Google has proven time and time again with their camera systems

680
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:47,845
Speaker 8:  that like software can do a lot. True.

681
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:50,045
Speaker 2:  And there is an amazing amount you can do in post,

682
00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:53,565
Speaker 8:  Oh my god. An amazing amount if you feel like digging and then also manipulating

683
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:57,485
Speaker 8:  images. But I do wanna, I mean, flat out software can do a lot. I

684
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:00,405
Speaker 8:  don't know where we're headed. I don't have an answer for like, oh yeah.

685
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:04,165
Speaker 8:  In 10 years, like all of our photos are gonna have this great blur and it's

686
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:07,485
Speaker 8:  gonna look more natural and the cutout's gonna be better. I don't know. That's

687
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,325
Speaker 8:  what I love about my job is that like I get a new product and I get to be

688
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:14,005
Speaker 8:  like, oh, did this happen this year? But back to like the, what is a photo?

689
00:38:14,435 --> 00:38:17,525
Speaker 8:  Like I love this question. I love thinking about it. I think about it a lot.

690
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,885
Speaker 8:  I don't think phones like really take photos anymore. I mean they take photos,

691
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:25,925
Speaker 8:  but like they're manipulating so much of the color. They're like, I mean,

692
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:29,245
Speaker 8:  and then now you can like change anything you want. Like you can take a photo

693
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,045
Speaker 8:  on iPhone and put it in Google photos and change everything. So like

694
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:36,565
Speaker 8:  these to me aren't like, let's stop like asking yourself like what is a photo?

695
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:38,165
Speaker 8:  Like, I mean like,

696
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:40,165
Speaker 2:  First of all, I will never stop asking that question.

697
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:42,325
Speaker 8:  Go ahead. Keep asking and I'll, I'll,

698
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:45,125
Speaker 2:  I'll fire me if I stop asking that question. No, somebody described it to

699
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,205
Speaker 2:  me relatively recently, which I thought was really interesting. Ooh, let

700
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:50,685
Speaker 2:  me hear. What we're doing with our phone cameras now is to

701
00:38:50,715 --> 00:38:54,605
Speaker 2:  photography. What, like the cameras spinning around on

702
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:58,285
Speaker 2:  top of the Google maps mapping things are Hmm. Where they are like

703
00:38:58,595 --> 00:39:02,525
Speaker 2:  they are fundamentally data collection devices. Yeah. And then you can

704
00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:05,205
Speaker 2:  do all kinds of interesting things with the data. Google uses it to map roads,

705
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:07,965
Speaker 2:  it uses it to get street view. It uses it to find places, it uses it for

706
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:11,525
Speaker 2:  AR and Google Maps. Like all this stuff. Technically what it is capturing

707
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:15,445
Speaker 2:  is video. Yes. But the point of it is not the video, the point of it is the

708
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,805
Speaker 2:  data inside of the video. And they were like, that's just what our phones

709
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:21,005
Speaker 2:  are now. They're Yeah. Collecting a bunch of data about their surroundings

710
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:24,365
Speaker 2:  that you then manipulate to be whatever you want. Yeah. And I was like, that's

711
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:27,525
Speaker 2:  a cool way of thinking about it that is fundamentally not photography. Yeah.

712
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:30,165
Speaker 2:  But it is a really interesting way of thinking about like what happens when

713
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:32,045
Speaker 2:  I hit the button on my camera. Well

714
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:34,885
Speaker 8:  Let's also think about like what you're taking photos of. I, I mean, I'll

715
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,845
Speaker 8:  tell you what, I take photos of like receipts

716
00:39:36,905 --> 00:39:37,845
Speaker 2:  You and denim jackets

717
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:41,165
Speaker 8:  Me and denim. Yeah. The top number one is me and denim

718
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:45,845
Speaker 8:  number two is receipts. Yep. Number three is like I, I'll just like,

719
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:49,485
Speaker 8:  oh, I wanna remember this restaurant. Let me just take a photo of it 'cause

720
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:52,965
Speaker 8:  that's quicker. Totally. Like I'm not really taking like photos.

721
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:57,205
Speaker 8:  I mean I like, I'm collecting data as you're saying. And so like I don't

722
00:39:57,205 --> 00:40:01,125
Speaker 8:  have this big problem around like, oh, our phones don't take photos. It's

723
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:04,405
Speaker 8:  like, I just need it to like collect information. You know and like, and

724
00:40:04,405 --> 00:40:07,805
Speaker 8:  then I'm gonna send that information to my friends and they can see that

725
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,925
Speaker 8:  I, I don't know, went swimming and it was really fun. And that's

726
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:13,645
Speaker 8:  just data to them too on me. Right?

727
00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:17,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Andrew, our producer was saying to me before we started that we're

728
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:20,325
Speaker 2:  still in this phase where if you shoot something on a smartphone, you always

729
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:23,725
Speaker 2:  say you shot it on a smartphone that like every magazine cover, nobody talks

730
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:25,845
Speaker 2:  about the camera that they use, but they'll always tell you that they shot

731
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:29,445
Speaker 2:  it on an iPhone. I love this. I do too. And, and it's, and it's so true.

732
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:32,885
Speaker 2:  And it's like I, I could name you the movies that Steven Soderberg shot with

733
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:36,045
Speaker 2:  an iPhone. I could not for one second tell you what camera he uses when it's

734
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:39,925
Speaker 2:  not an iPhone. Right. Okay. And that to me goes to either we're just doing

735
00:40:39,925 --> 00:40:43,165
Speaker 2:  different things with different goals or phones are not getting

736
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:46,485
Speaker 2:  anywhere near the realm of the other stuff because the camera shouldn't matter.

737
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:50,325
Speaker 8:  Disagree. I think if everyone actually knew cameras, like I would love to

738
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:54,165
Speaker 8:  know what every magazine cover is shot on because I know cameras, right.

739
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,125
Speaker 8:  Everyone knows phones. So of course if you tell 'em, oh it was shot on an

740
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,685
Speaker 8:  iPhone, it's like they know what that is. If you show told 'em it was shot

741
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:01,725
Speaker 8:  on like a Nikon Z nine. That's

742
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,765
Speaker 2:  True. But I also think part of it is like proving it's still such a novelty

743
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:07,485
Speaker 2:  that you can take a cool photo on a phone. Yeah. And, what they don't show

744
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:11,205
Speaker 2:  you is that you have to do twice as much lighting. Yeah. And work way harder

745
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:15,085
Speaker 2:  to get that photo to look good on a phone. Yes. Such that it will exist on

746
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:18,885
Speaker 2:  a magazine cover. Yeah. But I just think it's still like, oh my God, you

747
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:22,325
Speaker 2:  can take a good photo with a phone. And to me it's like until we're way past

748
00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:23,965
Speaker 2:  that where it's

749
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:26,645
Speaker 8:  Like, it's like, wait, you don't believe that? Are you still at that point

750
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:29,165
Speaker 8:  where you're shocked that you can take a good photo on a phone? No,

751
00:41:29,165 --> 00:41:29,805
Speaker 2:  But everybody is,

752
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:30,725
Speaker 8:  You think they are?

753
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:34,285
Speaker 2:  It's still such a novelty that you can do something cool on a phone. Like

754
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:34,685
Speaker 2:  can we

755
00:41:34,685 --> 00:41:35,085
Speaker 8:  Pull the audience?

756
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:37,605
Speaker 2:  Marquez Brownley started a whole new YouTube channel where he shoots stuff

757
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:40,605
Speaker 2:  on his phone and part of the shtick is I'm shooting it on my phone to prove

758
00:41:40,605 --> 00:41:41,045
Speaker 2:  that you can,

759
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:44,285
Speaker 8:  And it's genius because then he is also just like testing the phone at the

760
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:44,965
Speaker 8:  same time. Oh it's

761
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:46,925
Speaker 2:  Great. Smart. And the channel's great's so smart. The kids he played, he

762
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:49,725
Speaker 2:  did it all extremely well and very smart. And he just like sits next to cars

763
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:53,125
Speaker 2:  and films himself doing selfie videos. Yeah. Great job. But it is, we're

764
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:56,565
Speaker 2:  still at the point where like I can do this on my phone is like mind blowing

765
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:57,205
Speaker 2:  to lots of people.

766
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:00,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Interesting. I would love to hear from folks if you agree or disagree

767
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:03,765
Speaker 8:  with that because I don't know, like I remember Casey Nys stat was shooting

768
00:42:03,765 --> 00:42:07,685
Speaker 8:  videos and like, I don't know, on his like Samsung Galaxy S seven

769
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:11,525
Speaker 8:  or something. Yeah. And like that I was like, whoa, that's crazy.

770
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:15,245
Speaker 8:  But that was like six years. No, that had to be more than six years ago.

771
00:42:15,245 --> 00:42:18,605
Speaker 8:  That had to be like eight years ago now. Yeah. So. I. Guess that Novelty's

772
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:21,325
Speaker 8:  like gone to me. Like it's, there's no doubt you can take a good photo on

773
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:24,045
Speaker 8:  a phone. That's fair. And so then your point of like, are we gonna get any

774
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:27,925
Speaker 8:  better? It's like, yeah, marginally, but

775
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:31,685
Speaker 8:  like we can already do all the things that we wanna do on them. Yeah. So

776
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:35,565
Speaker 8:  then the bigger question for me that I get a lot is like, why would I buy

777
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:38,805
Speaker 8:  a standalone camera? Like I really believe that people think that their phone

778
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:42,685
Speaker 8:  cameras are good enough. And so then I ask them like, well what do you wanna

779
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,845
Speaker 8:  do? Like what do you think a camera can give you that your phone isn't right?

780
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:49,805
Speaker 8:  And it's always experience. And that's like where I base all of my like

781
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:53,005
Speaker 8:  reviews around is like, what is the experience of holding this thing? What

782
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:56,845
Speaker 8:  is the experience of using this thing? Like that's what it is for me because

783
00:42:56,845 --> 00:42:59,685
Speaker 8:  we can all take a good photo. I even have, oh, I should have brought that.

784
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:03,805
Speaker 8:  I have the first iPhone. Right. Nice. And like the camera on it. I

785
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:08,005
Speaker 8:  love it takes good photos. Like And, what does good mean? Okay.

786
00:43:08,075 --> 00:43:11,765
Speaker 8:  They're exposed well enough. Sure. You can see things

787
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:15,725
Speaker 8:  well enough. Like the color's fine, it's kind of in focus,

788
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:20,365
Speaker 8:  but the experience is so fun and like I, there's just, yeah.

789
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:23,605
Speaker 8:  So like, yeah, phones will get better, but like, I think everyone believes

790
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:25,725
Speaker 8:  that what they have in their pocket is actually pretty good. Good.

791
00:43:25,725 --> 00:43:28,565
Speaker 2:  This is my point. You're grading on a curve. We're still grading phones on

792
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:32,285
Speaker 2:  a curve. Like it's because they're phones. Like you're, you're not replacing

793
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:36,565
Speaker 2:  your professional gear. You still carry 11 Pelican pieces every time

794
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:37,285
Speaker 2:  you wanna shoot something.

795
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:40,445
Speaker 8:  No, I carry one Pelican case and it's got a lot of stickers and it's very

796
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:43,565
Speaker 8:  cute and we love her. What are you talking about? 11? I don't even, I don't

797
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:44,645
Speaker 8:  have, I don't have enough hands for that.

798
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:47,885
Speaker 2:  There's like a van that follows Becca around every time you go to shoot something.

799
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:48,245
Speaker 2:  That's all.

800
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:52,445
Speaker 8:  Boy, I wish, if anyone wants to drive that van, it has

801
00:43:52,445 --> 00:43:53,525
Speaker 8:  that van hit me up.

802
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,405
Speaker 2:  Okay, let's switch gears a little bit. Just before we have to go, I'm curious

803
00:43:56,405 --> 00:43:59,965
Speaker 2:  about the differences between the iPhone 15 and I guess

804
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:03,485
Speaker 2:  specifically the iPhone 15 Pro, which is like Yeah, the camera, east camera.

805
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:06,525
Speaker 2:  Oh yes. And the Pixel eight Pro. And we were talking about this on the show

806
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:10,325
Speaker 2:  a couple weeks ago that like we've sort of settled into a place where those

807
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:14,205
Speaker 2:  two companies and Samsung to some extent too, have different ideas

808
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:17,325
Speaker 2:  about photos. Yeah. But everybody had kind of settled into their lane and

809
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:21,085
Speaker 2:  it's like we'd gotten to a point where I think you could fairly reliably

810
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:25,085
Speaker 2:  look at a photo and guess which company Yeah. Made the phone that

811
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:27,965
Speaker 2:  it captured. You've spent a bunch of time with the Pixel and the iPhone.

812
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:31,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Over the last couple of months. Is that still the case? Are they kind

813
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:34,765
Speaker 2:  of in their own lane about what their photos should look like?

814
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:39,045
Speaker 8:  I think we are all coming together to the

815
00:44:39,045 --> 00:44:41,765
Speaker 8:  most collective. We think this photo looks good.

816
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:43,005
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay. I

817
00:44:43,005 --> 00:44:46,725
Speaker 8:  Really do. We do this fun thing. I do this fun thing and then I see who will

818
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:50,045
Speaker 8:  take the bait. When I'm doing these photo comparisons, I basically start

819
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:53,885
Speaker 8:  the edit. Here's some like video jargon for you or some background on my

820
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:57,445
Speaker 8:  process. I start the edit before I even start the script because like I just

821
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,005
Speaker 8:  take so many photos, like I really take over a thousand photos

822
00:45:01,425 --> 00:45:04,325
Speaker 8:  and then I put them all next to each other in the timeline. And I sit there

823
00:45:04,325 --> 00:45:07,685
Speaker 8:  and I watch a blank timeline. Sometimes I put music in just for fun and I

824
00:45:07,685 --> 00:45:11,645
Speaker 8:  just like watch the slideshow happen. Mm. And then I screenshot it

825
00:45:11,645 --> 00:45:15,125
Speaker 8:  and I send it to people and I'm like, okay, these are three different phones.

826
00:45:15,315 --> 00:45:18,765
Speaker 8:  Tell me which one's which. And like I would say one person always takes the

827
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:22,685
Speaker 8:  bait and that's Verin. My boss and coworker, he's like a photo

828
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:26,245
Speaker 8:  person. He can't even, he can't even tell anymore. Sometimes I can't even

829
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:28,845
Speaker 8:  tell. Sometimes they're like, oh wait, I forgot. Let me go look at the file

830
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:29,845
Speaker 8:  names. Interesting.

831
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:30,245
Speaker 2:  Like

832
00:45:30,385 --> 00:45:34,365
Speaker 8:  We are really coming to like the point of like, this is what the most people

833
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:38,125
Speaker 8:  think is a good photo. And that's what all of the, the, the North

834
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:39,605
Speaker 8:  star for all of these companies is.

835
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:42,645
Speaker 2:  So what, what are the characteristics of that? I'm assuming it's a little

836
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:46,565
Speaker 2:  extra saturation everywhere. We love dynamic range. Oh my god. My God. We

837
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:47,445
Speaker 2:  love dynamic range. Doesn't,

838
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:48,245
Speaker 8:  Can't get enough.

839
00:45:48,385 --> 00:45:52,245
Speaker 2:  The number one most we love dynamic range. Yes. Let me see the sky and

840
00:45:52,345 --> 00:45:54,565
Speaker 2:  and the ground. Let's do this. Yes. Ugh. Yes.

841
00:45:54,665 --> 00:45:57,805
Speaker 8:  Ugh. And the shadows like the man lurking in the back. Exactly. Want him

842
00:45:57,805 --> 00:45:57,965
Speaker 8:  too.

843
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:02,205
Speaker 2:  And I would think that everything, you wouldn't want it to be too colorful,

844
00:46:02,225 --> 00:46:06,125
Speaker 2:  but you'd want it to be like 3% extra colorful.

845
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:07,805
Speaker 2:  I don't know. You tell me. What are you seeing

846
00:46:08,105 --> 00:46:10,725
Speaker 8:  You know? I think the, the dynamic range is actually interesting 'cause I

847
00:46:10,725 --> 00:46:13,485
Speaker 8:  think there's like a pendulum, right. And I think companies really swung

848
00:46:13,485 --> 00:46:16,765
Speaker 8:  out on the dynamic range. Yeah. And it was like all of a sudden everything

849
00:46:16,765 --> 00:46:19,645
Speaker 8:  was not believable. Which is funny that like Yeah

850
00:46:19,645 --> 00:46:22,445
Speaker 2:  Like sometimes things are dark. Yeah. Which phones forgot for a while.

851
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:26,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Like I, I see shadows and that's okay. And So I think we we're now

852
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,365
Speaker 8:  we're like coming back to like more of a middle ground there. I think You

853
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:33,045
Speaker 8:  know white balance is really important. You know more. So there's

854
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:37,085
Speaker 8:  some like focus things happening. Like people do like a little depth of field

855
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:40,605
Speaker 8:  You know people do want things to be a little out of focus properly exposed.

856
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:44,205
Speaker 8:  But that's been good for a long time. But the big thing is the white balance

857
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:47,885
Speaker 8:  that used to be the differentiator between like Google and Apple

858
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:51,845
Speaker 8:  You know it was like the iPhone was always warmer and the Pixel

859
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:55,725
Speaker 8:  was always cooler. And now we're seeing the Pixel kind of like realize that

860
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:59,365
Speaker 8:  it was a little too cool Okay. And come towards Apple in that way.

861
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:02,685
Speaker 8:  But it does feel like the competition has always kind of been chasing Apple

862
00:47:02,745 --> 00:47:06,445
Speaker 8:  and continues to. And I find that where their photos have been

863
00:47:06,455 --> 00:47:10,405
Speaker 8:  consistent throughout cameras, the You know Pixel has changed

864
00:47:10,475 --> 00:47:12,445
Speaker 8:  more and has adapted more to that style.

865
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:16,245
Speaker 2:  Okay. So you think we're we're headed towards a much more like coherent

866
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:18,445
Speaker 2:  version of what a smartphone photo looks like?

867
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:21,805
Speaker 8:  Yes. Because You know much like we don't label magazines with like what camera

868
00:47:21,835 --> 00:47:25,325
Speaker 8:  took them like on Instagram. Like you don't know what everyone's phone,

869
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:28,485
Speaker 8:  who's everyone. True You know what what phone they have. And I think people

870
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:32,205
Speaker 8:  wanna like fit in on Instagram, right? So you want the photo that looks good

871
00:47:32,305 --> 00:47:35,965
Speaker 8:  but also doesn't look too different from everyone else's. And You know

872
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:39,125
Speaker 8:  maybe if you're an iPhone user you wanna like call out your Android friends

873
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:41,725
Speaker 8:  and your Android friends just wanna live in peace All. right. It's

874
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,925
Speaker 2:  Just they're doing fine. Yeah. Just leave them alone. Fine.

875
00:47:44,265 --> 00:47:47,845
Speaker 8:  All shut up. We don't care that we're green. That only affects you.

876
00:47:48,305 --> 00:47:51,165
Speaker 2:  Wow. That's kind of deep. Actually we're gonna come back to that another

877
00:47:51,165 --> 00:47:55,005
Speaker 2:  time. It's fine. So what about the like pro experience

878
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,605
Speaker 2:  of doing this? Obviously Apple made a bunch of noise about this is a pro

879
00:47:57,605 --> 00:48:01,165
Speaker 2:  camera. Yeah. Having used these things kind of within an inch of their life.

880
00:48:01,165 --> 00:48:04,885
Speaker 2:  Like is it, does it feel more pro? There's more stuff to do but I would not

881
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,805
Speaker 2:  say that's the same thing as being a pro camera.

882
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:10,565
Speaker 8:  No I, I think You know, obviously Pro is like marketing. It's like a way

883
00:48:10,565 --> 00:48:14,165
Speaker 8:  to say this is the best phone but they can't call it like the iPhone

884
00:48:14,165 --> 00:48:15,485
Speaker 8:  15 best

885
00:48:15,665 --> 00:48:17,805
Speaker 2:  Max parentheses the the good one. Yeah.

886
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:21,565
Speaker 8:  I wish they would The better iPhone 15 pro,

887
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:25,805
Speaker 8:  the bigger better. Yeah that would be incredible. The smaller not so good.

888
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:29,165
Speaker 8:  I mean it's good. Nevermind So I mean all of that's marketing. Right. And

889
00:48:29,805 --> 00:48:33,765
Speaker 8:  I was talking to some folks at Google at the event and I was kind

890
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:37,045
Speaker 8:  of picking their brain on like pro tools and pro this and pro that and You

891
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:40,805
Speaker 8:  know Google at the Pixel eight Pro didn't say this is for pros. Whereas

892
00:48:40,825 --> 00:48:44,445
Speaker 8:  in the iPhone 15 pro Max they were like, this is for

893
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:48,245
Speaker 8:  pros. And Google's kind of stance on it was like You know if

894
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:51,645
Speaker 8:  folks who are professional photographers come to the system, they will have

895
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:55,365
Speaker 8:  tools that they recognize in their professional workflow and that's cool

896
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,885
Speaker 8:  and that's great. And they're like, and they honestly said to me, but we

897
00:48:57,885 --> 00:49:01,685
Speaker 8:  find that most pros don't like You know they they pick up a

898
00:49:01,725 --> 00:49:04,085
Speaker 8:  phone because they know that it's like the easy thing and they're not trying

899
00:49:04,085 --> 00:49:07,725
Speaker 8:  to work with it. And, and I haven't spoken to Apple about this So I don't

900
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:11,285
Speaker 8:  know where they stand on it. The thing is they label everything pro but then

901
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:14,965
Speaker 8:  they don't give the pro tools, which it's like okay.

902
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,885
Speaker 8:  Like that's fine 'cause we've established that like pros aren't maybe using

903
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:21,525
Speaker 8:  this system for their professional work. Sure. But it does just kind of like

904
00:49:21,785 --> 00:49:25,005
Speaker 8:  baffle me and I think it's just 'cause they want people to buy apps and pay

905
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:25,605
Speaker 8:  for things You

906
00:49:25,605 --> 00:49:28,525
Speaker 2:  Know. I think that's right. And I do think there, there's potentially more

907
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:31,725
Speaker 2:  interesting stuff to come on the third party side. Like what we've seen from

908
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:34,325
Speaker 2:  the third party camera apps in the last few months has been really interesting.

909
00:49:34,355 --> 00:49:36,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there's potentially a lot more to do there. And I, and

910
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:40,525
Speaker 8:  I wanna shout out all the developers there. Like I did feel bad when I You

911
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:43,085
Speaker 8:  know I made this whole like a thousand photos with the iPhone 15 pro and

912
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:46,045
Speaker 8:  I went to the desert and it was sick and I drove in sand for the first time

913
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:49,485
Speaker 8:  and I'm nice addicted. I just wanna like, ooh, whip through the sand

914
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:53,685
Speaker 8:  anyway. And in that I was like, You know Apple, if you wanna be a programmer

915
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:57,525
Speaker 8:  you have to have like pro controls. And I, and I didn't really mention and

916
00:49:57,605 --> 00:50:01,405
Speaker 8:  shout out all the folks who like have built pro controls for

917
00:50:01,405 --> 00:50:05,365
Speaker 8:  the iPhone and there's many good ones that I wish

918
00:50:05,445 --> 00:50:08,725
Speaker 8:  I could list off for you right now. And I, and I can't just pull them outta

919
00:50:08,725 --> 00:50:11,245
Speaker 8:  my brain like that. But there's lots of folks that are building really good

920
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:14,565
Speaker 8:  tools if you're interested in that. And I think it is cool that there is

921
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,645
Speaker 8:  like a marketplace for those people to make what they love and do what they

922
00:50:17,645 --> 00:50:18,165
Speaker 8:  love. So

923
00:50:18,165 --> 00:50:21,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah, totally All, right? We have to go but before we do, okay. You have

924
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:25,525
Speaker 2:  to tell me. Yeah. Only one answer. Okay. What is the best smartphone for

925
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:26,965
Speaker 2:  taking pictures and video right now?

926
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:31,205
Speaker 8:  Oh my god. Okay. Can I tell you what it's not? No.

927
00:50:31,505 --> 00:50:34,485
Speaker 8:  Aw. Okay. Well it's the first gen iPhone. It's gorgeous.

928
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:39,125
Speaker 8:  It, it has like a filmic quality. It makes the cutest noise.

929
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:43,405
Speaker 8:  It's really slow and she's just so cute to hold in your hands and

930
00:50:43,405 --> 00:50:47,285
Speaker 8:  everybody's like, oh my God, what is that? And then you get to open the camera

931
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:51,245
Speaker 8:  and take a photo and everyone is just like amazed and it

932
00:50:51,245 --> 00:50:54,805
Speaker 8:  warms my whole heart. I, it's a great bar trick. I've been doing it a lot.

933
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:58,005
Speaker 2:  It's actually a really good answer. I'll allow that. I was not gonna allow

934
00:50:58,005 --> 00:51:00,405
Speaker 2:  that when you started talking and now I will allow that. I

935
00:51:00,745 --> 00:51:01,245
Speaker 8:  Get it outta my desk.

936
00:51:01,245 --> 00:51:04,885
Speaker 2:  What is the future of Polaroids is just like first gen iPhones that they

937
00:51:04,885 --> 00:51:08,245
Speaker 2:  just like make a comeback as the new retro camera that everybody's obsessed

938
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:10,805

Speaker 2:  mixed reality and all these new things about glasses on your face.

962
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:35,485
Speaker 2:  So, I, grab Daddy Robertson, who knows this space better than anybody. Addie,

963
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,205
Speaker 2:  thanks for being here. Hi, this is about a product that of the people at

964
00:52:39,205 --> 00:52:42,325
Speaker 2:  The Verge only you and I have used so far, So, I'm just gonna play you the

965
00:52:42,445 --> 00:52:45,005
Speaker 2:  question and we're gonna go from there. Sound good? Sounds good. All right,

966
00:52:45,005 --> 00:52:45,925
Speaker 2:  let's do it. It's from Peter.

967
00:52:47,225 --> 00:52:51,205
Speaker 9:  Hi guys, this is Peter. Long time listener, first time caller. I love what

968
00:52:51,205 --> 00:52:54,485
Speaker 9:  you do but I am at a little bit of an impasse. I'm a big

969
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:58,485
Speaker 9:  proponent of the future and of potential for spatial

970
00:52:58,485 --> 00:53:02,365
Speaker 9:  computing. I love this idea of the Apple Vision Pro headset and I'm excited

971
00:53:02,365 --> 00:53:05,965
Speaker 9:  to try it out. But I recently saw a really good

972
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:09,685
Speaker 9:  review of the Xreal glasses formerly called N

973
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:12,805
Speaker 9:  Reel Glasses and I think you guys were talking about them recently too. And

974
00:53:12,845 --> 00:53:16,685
Speaker 9:  I can't help but wonder if this really is something that

975
00:53:16,765 --> 00:53:20,485
Speaker 9:  captures 90% of the use cases

976
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:24,485
Speaker 9:  that I'm particularly, that I'm going to use the Apple Vision Pro for at

977
00:53:24,665 --> 00:53:28,405
Speaker 9:  one 10th of the price and much more convenient form factor, no battery,

978
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:32,365
Speaker 9:  much lighter. You can pop it in your pocket. I really feel like we need to

979
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:35,965
Speaker 9:  think about this and this might be closer to where we're heading

980
00:53:36,435 --> 00:53:40,405
Speaker 9:  than the big heavy Apple Vision Pro thoughts. Thank you.

981
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:44,525
Speaker 2:  I love this question but I wanna know like right off the top what you think.

982
00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:48,725
Speaker 10:  Okay, So I just have to caveat a, I'm assuming we're talking

983
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,605
Speaker 10:  about the NRE or sorry, the Xreal errors,

984
00:53:52,745 --> 00:53:56,005
Speaker 10:  not the Xreal lights. That's correct. The Xreal airs are the new headset

985
00:53:56,425 --> 00:53:59,605
Speaker 10:  and I am also going to only be able to talk about this from really a theoretical

986
00:53:59,605 --> 00:54:03,205
Speaker 10:  perspective perspective. Haven't used the Vision Pro have just played a

987
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:07,045
Speaker 10:  bit with the new Xreal glasses. I think it depends on what

988
00:54:07,045 --> 00:54:10,885
Speaker 10:  you see 90% of the use cases as being that Apple has

989
00:54:11,105 --> 00:54:15,045
Speaker 10:  all of this sort of, you'll be able to do situational things kind

990
00:54:15,045 --> 00:54:18,285
Speaker 10:  of promise going on that the idea is that it can sense your surroundings

991
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:22,165
Speaker 10:  to some extent that it can pin things to your desk or your wall or

992
00:54:22,265 --> 00:54:25,885
Speaker 10:  it can give the illusion that it has actual

993
00:54:25,885 --> 00:54:29,805
Speaker 10:  virtual objects in your real space. And that is a thing you will not get

994
00:54:29,825 --> 00:54:33,605
Speaker 10:  at all with the new Xreal headset that that is

995
00:54:33,745 --> 00:54:37,725
Speaker 10:  purely, it's like imagine you stuck a tablet up in front of your face and

996
00:54:37,725 --> 00:54:41,405
Speaker 10:  the tablet was always there and the tablet was also like slightly

997
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:45,325
Speaker 10:  transparent, especially in light. Those are the downsides of Xreal. The

998
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:49,285
Speaker 10:  upsides is that in a lot of ways I agree with you A, you have a

999
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:53,005
Speaker 10:  thing that is not tied to Apple's ecosystem

1000
00:54:53,185 --> 00:54:57,165
Speaker 10:  or to a bunch of XR developers making things that it's really just you

1001
00:54:57,165 --> 00:55:00,365
Speaker 10:  plug it in, you see a screen in front of your face, it's incredibly convenient

1002
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:04,645
Speaker 10:  B, that you can see everything else. Actually you're not

1003
00:55:04,645 --> 00:55:08,285
Speaker 10:  passing through a video feed, which is just kind of almost inherently

1004
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:11,765
Speaker 10:  going to be lower resolution and an inferior experience to the real world.

1005
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,965
Speaker 10:  And C yeah, they're kind of surprisingly comfortable even compared

1006
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:19,965
Speaker 10:  to the older Xreal glasses. And I haven't tried the Vision Pro, but

1007
00:55:19,965 --> 00:55:21,085
Speaker 10:  it's, it's a big thing.

1008
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:24,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's, it's less comfortable I can say with great confidence. Okay.

1009
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:25,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

1010
00:55:25,465 --> 00:55:28,485
Speaker 10:  So yeah, I really think people should be giving this a look. I'm not necessarily

1011
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:32,405
Speaker 10:  clear that it's a super viable product yet and I haven't had a chance to

1012
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:36,045
Speaker 10:  seriously review it, but I am similarly optimistic about it. I think Xreal

1013
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:36,965
Speaker 10:  iss a really interesting company.

1014
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:40,525
Speaker 2:  I agree. And I, I think your your point about it depends on what 90% of your

1015
00:55:40,525 --> 00:55:44,285
Speaker 2:  use cases are is really right. 'cause it, the thing that Xreal has done for

1016
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:48,245
Speaker 2:  me is make it very clear that the Vision Pros idea of

1017
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,525
Speaker 2:  a $3,500 device that essentially puts a bunch of virtual computer

1018
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:56,165
Speaker 2:  monitors in the air and you'll sit there with your mouse and keyboard

1019
00:55:56,745 --> 00:56:00,485
Speaker 2:  and use a headset to be a bunch of monitors that is gonna be,

1020
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:04,365
Speaker 2:  if not like, totally commoditized very soon then like not worth

1021
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:07,965
Speaker 2:  $3,500 because that's fundamentally what the extra glasses are. Right? Like,

1022
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:11,285
Speaker 2:  like you said, they are, they are just computer monitors I imagine plugging

1023
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:14,645
Speaker 2:  any device you have into a monitor that just floats in front of your face.

1024
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:18,885
Speaker 2:  So if that's your use case, Xreal is pretty good. I don't

1025
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:21,525
Speaker 2:  think it'll be as good as a lot of the Subdivision Pro is doing, but it does

1026
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:25,365
Speaker 2:  the job fairly well. To me, the biggest downside of these glasses so far

1027
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:29,485
Speaker 2:  and really a lot of these sort of plug and play products is just the

1028
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:33,325
Speaker 2:  interface. Like holding up my phone while

1029
00:56:33,845 --> 00:56:36,845
Speaker 2:  watching something through the Xreal glasses is cool 'cause I can just like

1030
00:56:36,845 --> 00:56:40,005
Speaker 2:  lean back and watch on a big screen, but I'm still navigating on my phone,

1031
00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:43,925
Speaker 2:  which means I'm constantly looking down at my phone and kind of

1032
00:56:43,925 --> 00:56:47,365
Speaker 2:  losing the thing. Whereas You know the Vision Pro and the meta stuff has

1033
00:56:47,665 --> 00:56:51,325
Speaker 2:  native interactions and it feels like you're in a space as opposed to this

1034
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:55,005
Speaker 2:  much hacker feeling thing that is the glasses. So again, it's, it's a much

1035
00:56:55,005 --> 00:56:58,965
Speaker 2:  less elegant system but if the goal is like I need more screens in front

1036
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:02,085
Speaker 2:  of my face while I sit at my computer, like Excel's pretty close,

1037
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:06,525
Speaker 10:  I think it also, a phone is kind of the worst way to interact with it. That's

1038
00:57:06,525 --> 00:57:06,605
Speaker 2:  True.

1039
00:57:07,165 --> 00:57:10,325
Speaker 10:  I was using it with a steam deck and the steam deck is basically just, I'm

1040
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:13,245
Speaker 10:  holding a controller and I can see the screen in front of my face now and

1041
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:13,845
Speaker 10:  so it's just, I

1042
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:16,085
Speaker 2:  Did it with the Switch for a while for the same reason. Yeah. Pretty much

1043
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:17,805
Speaker 10:  Just like using a console.

1044
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:21,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And in that case it's very good. So I, think in general, like

1045
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:25,565
Speaker 2:  we're, we're both pretty bullish on this kind of glasses,

1046
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:29,805
Speaker 2:  right? I think is, is Xreal even like doing anything sort of

1047
00:57:29,805 --> 00:57:32,565
Speaker 2:  unusual or are they just sort of first in this space you've been paying attention

1048
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:36,445
Speaker 2:  to these like wacky manufacturers of AR glasses longer than I have. Like

1049
00:57:36,445 --> 00:57:37,925
Speaker 2:  is is doing something special.

1050
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:41,925
Speaker 10:  My sense is that they are just ruthlessly conceptually efficient.

1051
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:46,165
Speaker 10:  Okay. That their first glasses were a bit more in

1052
00:57:46,225 --> 00:57:50,125
Speaker 10:  the, they have cameras and you can play sort of AR games and

1053
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:54,005
Speaker 10:  you can pin things sort of to the floor and they

1054
00:57:54,005 --> 00:57:57,605
Speaker 10:  completely cut that. There's no cameras in the new glasses. It's just a

1055
00:57:57,605 --> 00:58:00,725
Speaker 10:  thing that sits there. It doesn't give any illusion of interacting with

1056
00:58:00,725 --> 00:58:04,645
Speaker 10:  space, but that also means that they can be really light. They can be, I'm

1057
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:08,085
Speaker 10:  not gonna say normal looking, but more normal looking and they can be

1058
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:11,765
Speaker 10:  comparatively really cheap. Yeah. And I think that they really have actually

1059
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:15,365
Speaker 10:  just figured out there's a thing maybe we can make people want to do with

1060
00:58:15,365 --> 00:58:17,965
Speaker 10:  this and we're gonna deliver the best experience of that we can.

1061
00:58:18,355 --> 00:58:20,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I said, I said on the show last week that I'm, I'm super intrigued

1062
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:23,765
Speaker 2:  by this race between companies like Meta, which are basically saying we're

1063
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:27,365
Speaker 2:  gonna take various stylish classes, start with essentially audio and then

1064
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:30,405
Speaker 2:  try to figure out how to add more screen stuff to it. And companies like

1065
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:34,365
Speaker 2:  Xra who are like, we have a screen, it looks kind of silly in in

1066
00:58:34,365 --> 00:58:37,965
Speaker 2:  comparison to like the RayBan's meta selling, but it has a screen

1067
00:58:38,145 --> 00:58:41,445
Speaker 2:  and we'll figure out how to do the rest of it later. And those two companies

1068
00:58:41,445 --> 00:58:44,685
Speaker 2:  are sort of running at each other from opposite directions and it's gonna

1069
00:58:44,685 --> 00:58:48,125
Speaker 2:  be interesting to see what happens. And then I think like the Quest and Vision

1070
00:58:48,185 --> 00:58:51,445
Speaker 2:  Pro stuff are just like all the way off in a different dimension and I think

1071
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:55,325
Speaker 2:  it's not impossible that the simpler stuff is gonna end up being

1072
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:58,045
Speaker 2:  way more appealing to way more people. I would not bet on that yet, but I

1073
00:58:58,045 --> 00:58:59,165
Speaker 2:  don't think that's outta the question.

1074
00:58:59,555 --> 00:59:03,005
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I think pass through has just really inherent limitations. I know

1075
00:59:03,005 --> 00:59:05,965
Speaker 10:  that there are cases that it's very good for, there are specific things

1076
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:09,805
Speaker 10:  it's very good for, but as a really casual consumer device, it is not the

1077
00:59:09,885 --> 00:59:11,325
Speaker 10:  thing I'm most bullish on. Yeah,

1078
00:59:11,345 --> 00:59:15,125
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So $400 for, for Xra Glasses. Glasses, again we've,

1079
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:18,525
Speaker 2:  we've only used them a very little bit like strikes me as a lot to spend,

1080
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:22,405
Speaker 2:  they're, they're a little bit of a, a novelty but compared to You know whatever,

1081
00:59:22,465 --> 00:59:25,885
Speaker 2:  $3,500 for the Vision Pro next year, which isn't even shipping yet.

1082
00:59:26,445 --> 00:59:30,325
Speaker 2:  I guess it's a good deal. It's more than 10% is fun for 10%

1083
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:32,285
Speaker 2:  of the price I guess. I don't know. Yeah,

1084
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:35,565
Speaker 10:  I think that if you think what you need is a really versatile,

1085
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:40,125
Speaker 10:  albeit imperfect screen that goes pretty much anywhere with

1086
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:43,845
Speaker 10:  you and that has a level of privacy. If you're, I, I don't know,

1087
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:47,325
Speaker 10:  somewhere you don't want people to see what you're doing and that you can

1088
00:59:47,325 --> 00:59:51,245
Speaker 10:  just really, as far as I can tell, plug into most things you own pretty

1089
00:59:51,245 --> 00:59:54,245
Speaker 10:  easily. It seems like a good early adopter thing.

1090
00:59:54,355 --> 00:59:58,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah, my main use case so far has been sitting here in this chair at

1091
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:02,125
Speaker 2:  my desk like with feet up on my desk leaning back head sort of slightly

1092
01:00:02,235 --> 01:00:05,965
Speaker 2:  upwards with the glasses on playing video games with the controller in my

1093
01:00:05,965 --> 01:00:09,125
Speaker 2:  hand. And like you said, it's an excellent setup. The screen's not amazing,

1094
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:11,165
Speaker 2:  neither is the switches, it does the job.

1095
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:14,485
Speaker 10:  Yeah. My biggest problem so far is really just that you have to angle them

1096
01:00:14,515 --> 01:00:18,445
Speaker 10:  precisely to not get some really heavy blur at the bottom of the

1097
01:00:18,445 --> 01:00:18,885
Speaker 10:  screen. Yes.

1098
01:00:18,955 --> 01:00:22,845
Speaker 2:  I've spent a lot of time moving the nose pads around to get them

1099
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:26,045
Speaker 2:  just so, and I eventually can get them there, but it is, it is a fair amount

1100
01:00:26,045 --> 01:00:27,085
Speaker 2:  of work. You're right. Yeah,

1101
01:00:27,185 --> 01:00:30,885
Speaker 10:  It, it's way better than the original, like the lights, but it's still

1102
01:00:31,165 --> 01:00:33,005
Speaker 10:  I think the biggest drawback to them. Yeah,

1103
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:36,005
Speaker 2:  That's fair. All, right Addie, thank you as always. Appreciate it.

1104
01:00:36,275 --> 01:00:36,565
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

1105
01:00:38,945 --> 01:00:41,525
Speaker 2:  All right. That's it for The Vergecast today. Thanks to everybody who's on

1116
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:20,285
Speaker 2:  be back on Friday to talk inevitably more about Apple plus Sam bankman

1117
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:23,485
Speaker 2:  free Google and all the other stuff happening in in tech. We'll see you then.

1118
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:24,085
Speaker 2:  Rock and roll

1119
01:01:34,145 --> 01:01:37,595
Speaker 3:  Support for this episode comes from Sonos. Me and the rest of The Vergecast

1120
01:01:37,595 --> 01:01:40,795
Speaker 3:  team are all audio professionals. And at The Verge we have an office full

1121
01:01:40,795 --> 01:01:44,675
Speaker 3:  of Sonos products. Personally, I use the Sonos era 300 in particular

1122
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:48,675
Speaker 3:  a lot. It's an all-in-one plugin smart speaker designed for immersive sound

1123
01:01:48,695 --> 01:01:52,675
Speaker 3:  and spatial audio listening out loud. Its breakthrough Acoustic design projects

1124
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:56,035
Speaker 3:  sound from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, allowing listeners to feel

1125
01:01:56,035 --> 01:01:59,355
Speaker 3:  like the music and sound is all around them. No matter where you are in the

1126
01:01:59,355 --> 01:02:03,115
Speaker 3:  room or what you play, the listening experience is nothing short of extraordinary.

1127
01:02:03,495 --> 01:02:06,635
