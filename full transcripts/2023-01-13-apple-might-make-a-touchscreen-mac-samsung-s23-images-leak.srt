31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,520
Speaker 4:  these cold long winter nights. But we've got a lot of things

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,320
Speaker 4:  going on on the Verge cast today. We've got a ton of Apple rumors,

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,640
Speaker 4:  we've got a ton of Samsung rumors. We have no Fleetwood Mac rumors

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,600
Speaker 4:  because again, we don't want Andrew to die, but we, we've just got, there's

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,640
Speaker 4:  a whole bunch of things happening today, so we're gonna get right into it.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,320
Speaker 5:  Let's

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,240
Speaker 6:  Do it. And, and let's get started. Started with the biggest rumor that we've

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,320
Speaker 6:  all been waiting for. At least some of us have been waiting for or someone

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,760
Speaker 6:  has been waiting for that Apple might finally make a touchscreen Mac.

41
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,600
Speaker 4:  Yes. This is Dan's favorite thing Dan, you were so excited about this.

42
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,480
Speaker 4:  I've never seen someone glow with joy at a rumor

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,240
Speaker 4:  before. Yeah. You like, I notice like a, a

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,160
Speaker 4:  legendary desire for all Verge cast listeners, for all people

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,080
Speaker 4:  at the Verge to have a touch MacBook Pro, a touch Mac.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. At

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,560
Speaker 5:  All. Yeah. So there's rumors coming from Bloomberg

48
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,080
Speaker 4:  You said really enthusiastic.

49
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You know, well, I mean look, it'll be good. It'll be

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Speaker 5:  fine to have it. I think that there's like, let me just like say

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,160
Speaker 5:  what this rumor is. So Mark Derman at Bloomberg has reported

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,400
Speaker 5:  that in 2025 Apple will release its first

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
Speaker 5:  touchscreen Mac, or at least that's what they're aiming for now, which is

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,120
Speaker 5:  two years away at least. And it might use an Olet screen, but the big deal

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
Speaker 5:  is it would be a touchscreen, which would be first for the Mac. So

56
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,400
Speaker 5:  the way that he's framed this rumor is that this is not

57
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,960
Speaker 5:  iPad hardware running Mac os It is. Okay. Kind

58
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Speaker 5:  of framed as like this is a, a MacBook style laptop

59
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,320
Speaker 5:  with a touchscreen on it. Which is, you know, very similar to

60
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,360
Speaker 5:  countless windows running devices that have been on the market for many years

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,640
Speaker 5:  that have touchscreens and people like them and they enjoy them and stuff

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,400
Speaker 5:  like that for like a decade. But what it doesn't seem like it is, what's

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,520
Speaker 5:  that?

64
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Speaker 4:  It's like a decade. We've had touchscreen windows machines for over a decade.

65
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,960
Speaker 5:  Yes. Very long time. But a lot of those touchscreen

66
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,240
Speaker 5:  devices and those Windows machines have been like convertibles. Either they

67
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,000
Speaker 5:  like flip the screen around behind the keyboard or you could

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,680
Speaker 5:  do the surface style and rip the keyboard off becomes a tablet, stuff like

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,520
Speaker 5:  that. This is like at least how it's framed now in the reporting it,

70
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,000
Speaker 5:  I am not reading that. I am reading that this is a laptop with a touchscreen

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,920
Speaker 5:  and a fixed hinge that extends to a certain opening degrees and then it's

72
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,400
Speaker 5:  just st always a laptop. You never turn this into a tablet. And so then the

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,040
Speaker 5:  question becomes, well what benefit does that bring? Right. And I think that

74
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,360
Speaker 5:  if it pans out that way, it would just be like your main

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,240
Speaker 5:  input devices are still the keyboard and the track pad, which have

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,960
Speaker 5:  been always, well at least the track pad's always been excellent on max and

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,560
Speaker 5:  the recent keyboards have been very good. Yeah. And then the touchscreen

78
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,360
Speaker 5:  is just there and you can like poke at it to like scroll

79
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,280
Speaker 5:  a, a webpage or pinch zoom on something or tap a button or something

80
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,960
Speaker 5:  like that. Which is exactly how I use a touchscreen windows laptop. And that'll

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,280
Speaker 5:  be nice

82
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,440
Speaker 6:  And it's fine.

83
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,280
Speaker 4:  So it's basically like for those of us who have stupid fingers,

84
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,400
Speaker 4:  cuz I have very stupid fingers and I'll use my iPad all the time and then

85
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,280
Speaker 4:  I'll go to my MacBook and then I'll be like, oh, I wanna make Richard bigger

86
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,040
Speaker 4:  on the screen and just reach out and touch Richard's face and nothing

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,320
Speaker 4:  happens because it's just a normal computer. And I'm like, oh yeah,

88
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,240
Speaker 4:  that's not how those work. It's for me. Right. Like it's, it's for those

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,320
Speaker 4:  of us who are just like, forget.

90
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,840
Speaker 6:  Well I think it's also for people who are much younger than us Yeah. Who

91
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,280
Speaker 6:  have had touchscreens surrounding them their whole lives. Partially due to

92
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,720
Speaker 6:  Apple's success with the iPhone, with the iPad, they are used to being able

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,480
Speaker 6:  to reach out and touch things that is,

94
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,080
Speaker 5:  Or you know, they have Chromebooks that have touchscreens and that's what

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,240
Speaker 5:  they're using in school. And so like that's what you know they are, they

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,920
Speaker 5:  are accustomed to it. It is a very natural interaction. Wanna touch a screen?

97
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,640
Speaker 5:  I can tell you from years of reviewing laptops, many of those Windows

98
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,120
Speaker 5:  laptops that head touchscreens and every time I would like review a laptop

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,480
Speaker 5:  for a couple of weeks or whatever and go back to using my work Mac, I would

100
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,880
Speaker 5:  hit the stupid screen, punch a screen by reflex cuz it became so

101
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,760
Speaker 5:  natural and normal to be able to like click an okay button

102
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,040
Speaker 5:  or you know, close a window by just having the screen. It's not

103
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,840
Speaker 5:  the primary interaction model, it's just another

104
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,440
Speaker 5:  convenient way to use the device in a natural way. That makes sense.

105
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,480
Speaker 5:  I think the people that like really kind of like are

106
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,760
Speaker 5:  against this idea are the people who are of the mind

107
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,000
Speaker 5:  that like my fingers never leave the home row. I know all the keyboard shortcuts

108
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,480
Speaker 5:  and I have perfect typing form and I know how to navigate the whole os without

109
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,400
Speaker 5:  ever lifting my fingers off the keyboard. And like that's great for you.

110
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 5:  You don't ever have to touch the screen if you don't want to. Like I'm sure

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,640
Speaker 5:  Mac os will still

112
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,240
Speaker 6:  Work. Davis Bacon is very proud. It's

113
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,800
Speaker 5:  Just Richard exactly the way. But like the rest of the world doesn't work.

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,680
Speaker 5:  Have you ever watched someone use a computer? Their hands are like all over

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,240
Speaker 5:  the place and like they, they got their hand down on the track pad or they

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,800
Speaker 5:  are like, you know, have poor typing for 'em like myself. Like

117
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,920
Speaker 5:  so it's, it's a natural way. It makes sense. The fact that they didn't do

118
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Speaker 5:  it for so long I think is kind of like silly. I

119
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,520
Speaker 4:  Don't think it's silly

120
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,200
Speaker 6:  Though that they went with the touch bar at all that that ever happened.

121
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,080
Speaker 4:  The touch bar was incredible. Shut your dirty mouth. It was in, it was

122
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,520
Speaker 4:  wonderful. I loved it so much.

123
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,160
Speaker 5:  I mean if you still want it, you could still get it on a MacBook Pro 13 inch

124
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,040
Speaker 5:  M two if you love

125
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,640
Speaker 4:  It that much. The other day I was going and I have a stream deck at home

126
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,200
Speaker 4:  and it has a button on it that I just press and it opens a quick post and

127
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,480
Speaker 4:  I can immediately pop off a quick post and now instead I have to like do

128
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,400
Speaker 4:  more things. And I was like, man, I wish this MacBook Air had

129
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,360
Speaker 4:  a touch bar with a quick post button on it and I could just go, boop, like

130
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,080
Speaker 4:  I miss i I dream about a touch bar that's

131
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Speaker 4:  works perfectly. It never existed but it could have. Okay. My

132
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,160
Speaker 4:  heart.

133
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,880
Speaker 6:  And that was what struck me cuz I went, I went back and looked at Jake's

134
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,440
Speaker 6:  review of the first MacBook PR that had a touch bar. Yeah. And that

135
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,080
Speaker 6:  was kind of what he said was that the idea was decent and that he could see

136
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,520
Speaker 6:  where, where there were opportunities for it but the software didn't exist.

137
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,360
Speaker 6:  And now years later we know that the software never existed. It never exist.

138
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,800
Speaker 6:  The use case it, it just never really came about.

139
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,600
Speaker 5:  It never, it never got the buy-in. Yeah.

140
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,760
Speaker 4:  There was like three developers who were like, those three developers were

141
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,840
Speaker 4:  working so hard and they're we're doing so much cool stuff and then you'll

142
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,760
Speaker 4:  be like, wow, I can't do anything else but like mute.

143
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,480
Speaker 4:  But I can mute real fast and it's great and I don't have to think about it.

144
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,680
Speaker 4:  I guess I could also do that with physical buttons and

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,360
Speaker 5:  Changing the volume takes three taps I believe it took as opposed to just,

146
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,080
Speaker 5:  you know, one Yeah. Rude. The other, the other way to look

147
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,880
Speaker 5:  at this I think is you could argue that Apple has already

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,480
Speaker 5:  made a touchscreen laptop and it's called the iPad with the magic keyboard

149
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,320
Speaker 5:  or now even more so the magic keyboard folio. And I think the magic keyboard

150
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,800
Speaker 5:  folio is the more instructive use case here. The one that came out for the

151
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,480
Speaker 5:  10th gen iPad because the magic keyboard for the

152
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,120
Speaker 5:  iPad Pro kind of is designed to bring that screen forward

153
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,720
Speaker 5:  toward you so it's closer to you so that when you do touch it, it's not like

154
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,640
Speaker 5:  you're reaching as far, but the magic keyboard folio is the opposite. It's

155
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,360
Speaker 5:  design is like pretty far away for you to be reaching up and touching the

156
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,200
Speaker 5:  screen much like it is with a laptop. And the screen is like kind of a

157
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,160
Speaker 5:  distance for you to touch. And so your primary interactions when you're using

158
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,880
Speaker 5:  the magic keyboard folio with the iPad is you're using the keyboard and the

159
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,360
Speaker 5:  track pad and then occasionally you're tapping the screen to select a box

160
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
Speaker 5:  or hit okay. Or close a window or scroll or just zoom

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,440
Speaker 5:  whatever it is convenient for you. But again it's, it's like this extra interaction.

162
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:49,880
Speaker 5:  So

163
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,840
Speaker 4:  This is what I wanted to talk about cuz like, okay, they say we're gonna

164
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,720
Speaker 4:  do a touch, it's gonna be gonna be a MacBook, it's gonna look like an app

165
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,040
Speaker 4:  MacBook, it's gonna act like a MacBook and it'll just have a touch thing

166
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,360
Speaker 4:  on it. And like you could go and do that for years now. You could go and

167
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,920
Speaker 4:  like hack one, put a, there are these cool little like weird screen overlays

168
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,120
Speaker 4:  you could do, don't do it. They were terrible. But you could theoretically

169
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,080
Speaker 4:  do it. It's like the worst experience in the world. But the

170
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,720
Speaker 4:  problem is like iPad exists and iPad is built for touch and all the buttons

171
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,680
Speaker 4:  are big for touch. Everything is intended for touch. The MacBook is not

172
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,680
Speaker 4:  intended for touch and I don't think anybody wants the buttons to suddenly

173
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,000
Speaker 4:  get huge and all of those touch, have

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,240
Speaker 5:  You seen Control Center on recent Mac Os? Like

175
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,040
Speaker 4:  I am looking at my little, my little, you know the

176
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Speaker 4:  little dots that make your windows get big and small. Those are still small.

177
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,720
Speaker 4:  Sure. But I would imagine on like on if it was a touch, I'd want them big

178
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,400
Speaker 4:  so that I don't,

179
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,640
Speaker 6:  And those are annoying to hit with the mouse. They should be big.

180
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,800
Speaker 4:  So you're, you're a pro big button. You're I see

181
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,680
Speaker 5:  How, I mean look with, so this is this Rumor's two years out, right? So that

182
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,640
Speaker 5:  is two versions of Makos that they can tweak and adjust and

183
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,520
Speaker 5:  continue to bring Makos closer to this touch experience. Like

184
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,080
Speaker 5:  we're already, we've, we, I think if you look back like two Mac os

185
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,840
Speaker 5:  reviews ago, the story was about how they're making it more like an

186
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,080
Speaker 5:  iPad with the control center updates, right. And some other interaction things.

187
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,040
Speaker 5:  This year they brought Stage Manager, which is very obviously an

188
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,240
Speaker 5:  iPad first designed feature that you can also run on the Mac but

189
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,040
Speaker 5:  it works like it does on the iPad. And so like you could

190
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,840
Speaker 5:  see that these next steps are gonna come, they'll figure out some way to

191
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,720
Speaker 5:  do window management in a nice more toucher friendly way. But again,

192
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,280
Speaker 5:  I don't know if touch is ever going to be the primary

193
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,520
Speaker 5:  interaction this

194
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,320
Speaker 4:  Often figured out how to do Windows management on an iPad though. Like just

195
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,840
Speaker 4:  last, this was like two years ago that they were like, we're doing Windows

196
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,240
Speaker 6:  Or on a Mac in opinion,

197
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,880
Speaker 5:  But Right. But that, that's like, that's, that's not because it, it's not

198
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,560
Speaker 5:  touchable, it's because of the iPad's os structure

199
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
Speaker 5:  and the way that they are trying to

200
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,760
Speaker 4:  Reinvent everything.

201
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,320
Speaker 5:  But if the, but like the iPad comes

202
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,600
Speaker 4:  From

203
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,280
Speaker 5:  Everything as a touch first experience and this

204
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,200
Speaker 5:  in a, in a, in a laptop, the touch layer is not the first primary

205
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,040
Speaker 5:  way of interacting with it. It is like a tertiary interaction level.

206
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,880
Speaker 5:  And so like you don't need everything to be touch friendly like on

207
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,360
Speaker 5:  Windows. Not everything is touch friendly. Like there's lots of little fiddly

208
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,280
Speaker 5:  things on Windows that when you're using touchscreen on a Windows device,

209
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,680
Speaker 5:  like are still fiddly. Microsoft has changed it a little bit. They, they

210
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,480
Speaker 5:  get the, the task bar a little bigger. The buttons get a little bit larger

211
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,520
Speaker 5:  when you switch into tablet mode and stuff like that. But there's still a

212
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,120
Speaker 5:  lot of fiddly check boxes. It's still Windows. And I don't think that really

213
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,320
Speaker 5:  needs to change because it's not like this would be the primary interaction.

214
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,280
Speaker 5:  It's just like certain things you would wanna touch or you would reflexively

215
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,000
Speaker 5:  touch. I think the thing that I always end up doing is on the lock screen

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,080
Speaker 5:  when you log in, you type in your password and you wanna click okay and you

217
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,400
Speaker 5:  wanna touch the button to hit Okay. Which is already, it's

218
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,080
Speaker 4:  So satisfying. Just

219
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Speaker 5:  Boop. Exactly. And so like things like that is

220
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,360
Speaker 6:  Where you will touch and that's what we've seen on, on Windows. Like those

221
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,480
Speaker 6:  like three buttons to manage the windows. They, they're not a lot bigger

222
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,760
Speaker 6:  than they used to be, but they've gotten more touch friendly. They, they

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,400
Speaker 6:  figured it out. If mi if Microsoft can figure out how to make the UI touch

224
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,240
Speaker 6:  friendly between Windows eight and Windows 11 and it mostly is now

225
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,800
Speaker 6:  Mo mostly most of the time.

226
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,400
Speaker 4:  Mostly

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,440
Speaker 6:  I'm pretty sure Apple can can do something there.

228
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,720
Speaker 5:  The other point here is that you can run iPad

229
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Speaker 5:  apps on the Mac now. Like if you open the home app on the Mac,

230
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,920
Speaker 5:  it is essentially the iPad app running on the Mac with the same interaction,

231
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,680
Speaker 5:  the same ui, and the same interface. And that goes on for like a number of

232
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,520
Speaker 5:  other apps. So like it's not weird to run those, it'd actually be better

233
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,160
Speaker 5:  to use those with touch because they were designed touch first. So a lot

234
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,840
Speaker 5:  of the things are like, I would like to be able to touch this screen, but

235
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,600
Speaker 5:  then if I'm using, I don't know, I, I'm looking at GarageBand and my web

236
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,320
Speaker 5:  browser right now, I probably would not interact with those with Touch primarily

237
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,600
Speaker 5:  I would use my mouse and keyboard like I always have. Ooh,

238
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,320
Speaker 4:  Are we gonna get to a point? They always say every time these rumors start

239
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,440
Speaker 4:  flying and we start hearing about like the touchscreen MacBooks and

240
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,240
Speaker 4:  the, the continued fusion of iPad OS and Mac Os, we start

241
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Speaker 4:  talking about walled gardens. How like if we had to do,

242
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,680
Speaker 4:  there's, there's the Go 90 scale, which is all about streaming

243
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,200
Speaker 4:  services, but I think there should be like a walled garden scale from like

244
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,000
Speaker 4:  no wall to wall. That's a terrible scale, but that's what it is.

245
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,000
Speaker 4:  How in danger do you think the un walled Garden of Mac OS

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,960
Speaker 4:  is with a touch Mac and that that like iPad energy

247
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,920
Speaker 4:  getting more infused into the Mac? Cause I'm a little nervous. I'm

248
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,440
Speaker 4:  not gonna lie.

249
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,480
Speaker 5:  I mean, I mean the optimist in me, which is a rare person who comes

250
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,840
Speaker 5:  out, you don't see the optimism.

251
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,200
Speaker 4:  Who is, this is not, this is not Dan.

252
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,440
Speaker 5:  I don't, I don't think it like, again, I don't think because I don't see

253
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,360
Speaker 5:  them making touch the primary interaction level, which would

254
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,160
Speaker 5:  mean that like you would design an app that runs in the app store so it can

255
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,120
Speaker 5:  be installed on Mac, iOS and iPad all at the same

256
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,440
Speaker 5:  time. It has to run through the app store to do that. Right. Right. That's

257
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Speaker 5:  if the touch is the first primary interaction level. But if you're still

258
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,280
Speaker 5:  able to make Mac apps that use a keyboard and mouse and have

259
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,680
Speaker 5:  all their keyboard shortcuts, support and things like that, or keyboard and

260
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,160
Speaker 5:  track pad, what have you, as long as you're still able to do that and those

261
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,280
Speaker 5:  are still able to run because it's still Mac os they didn't, don't change

262
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,200
Speaker 5:  it that drastically then like you'll still be able to download apps

263
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,920
Speaker 5:  from websites and from, you know, stuff like that and run them already.

264
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
Speaker 5:  Right now that's kind of an annoying thing to do because you have to like

265
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Speaker 5:  jump through a bunch of check boxes to get the thing to install. Yeah. But

266
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,680
Speaker 5:  I don't see how adding touch changes that, especially if touch

267
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,080
Speaker 5:  is not the primary interaction

268
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,920
Speaker 6:  Level. I I have one question for, for Dan that I, I wanna ask you, are

269
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,840
Speaker 6:  we glossing over the ole rumor? Like how, how big of a change would it be

270
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,640
Speaker 6:  to have ole screens on MacBook Pros from, from the screens that we have now?

271
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:42,840
Speaker 6:  The,

272
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,080
Speaker 5:  You know, it's, it's kinda interesting. We're gonna probably talk about the

273
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,240
Speaker 5:  micro L e d rumor later on in the show. But like many

274
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,240
Speaker 5:  micro, micro led micro led. Yes. Micro, micro, no

275
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,440
Speaker 4:  We say no micro L E d We're not saying micro led.

276
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,760
Speaker 4:  Absolutely not. Richard. No, do not nobody normalize

277
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,320
Speaker 4:  that. Everybody listening, you're not allowed to normalize that.

278
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,600
Speaker 5:  Please normalize it. Tweeta tweeta, Alex

279
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,960
Speaker 5:  recordings of you saying it.

280
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,560
Speaker 5:  So there's like the, in the span of like, or the, the progression of display

281
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,440
Speaker 5:  technology for computers, right? It's like L C D and then mini l

282
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
Speaker 5:  e d, which apple's already at with the MacBook Pro 14 and 16

283
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,800
Speaker 5:  and then O led and then micro L e D and O

284
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,200
Speaker 5:  would have, you know, slightly better blacks

285
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,280
Speaker 5:  than the current crop of mini L e d. But I gotta tell you the mini l

286
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,720
Speaker 5:  e d screens on the 14 and the 16 MacBook Pro look phenomenal. Like

287
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,440
Speaker 5:  I I, I don't know how much I would appreciate having olet instead of

288
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,360
Speaker 5:  them like maybe it would be a little bit more efficient. Maybe it'd be using

289
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,320
Speaker 5:  less power, I don't know. But they get way brighter than

290
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,040
Speaker 5:  any OD laptop I've ever seen and they get way brighter than most OED

291
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,880
Speaker 5:  screens that we're familiar with. So like if you go from mini l e D to od,

292
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,320
Speaker 5:  that's kind of like a small step in certain respects, but maybe a

293
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,200
Speaker 5:  sidestep in others. And then when you get to micro l e d that is

294
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,920
Speaker 5:  supposed to bring the, all the benefits of OD and all the benefits of mini

295
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,640
Speaker 5:  L e d without the drawbacks of either of them, the drawbacks of ole being,

296
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,520
Speaker 5:  the fact that it's organic and can have burn and can degrade

297
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,160
Speaker 5:  over time. And then mini l e d being not quite as

298
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,960
Speaker 5:  black blacks or high levels of contrast as ole

299
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,600
Speaker 5:  offers, but micro L e D is able to offer that. So like it's a stepping

300
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,760
Speaker 5:  towards it.

301
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,560
Speaker 4:  I I I feel like the ola you're like if you're, they're on,

302
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,440
Speaker 4:  they're on mini l e D right now, right? Yes. And then the plan is micro L

303
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,000
Speaker 4:  e d but primarily for watches first, even though that's like the weirdest

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,520
Speaker 4:  place to put it.

305
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,120
Speaker 5:  Well yeah, I mean if we wanna just jump to that report. I mean like the other

306
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,880
Speaker 5:  thing, there's been so many like Apple rumors this week. So the other thing

307
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,080
Speaker 5:  from No, no,

308
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,320
Speaker 4:  No, I wanna talk about my thing first. I wanna talk about my free thing first.

309
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,960
Speaker 4:  Everybody get excited? These rumors are coming. I told you this is a rumors

310
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,560
Speaker 4:  episode, we're all talking rumors. But I was just gonna say like it doesn't

311
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,200
Speaker 4:  make sense to go to O ad if you're at mini l e d because the reason that

312
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,400
Speaker 4:  O ad is so captivating on a TV is you don't get all that bloom

313
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,400
Speaker 4:  that you get with edge lighting or that you get with mini l

314
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,240
Speaker 4:  e d that's, that makes it like you get a lot of bloom in a 55

315
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,880
Speaker 4:  inch tv. You don't get a lot of bloom very often in

316
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,320
Speaker 4:  a high quality laptop display like you see in a Mac. So it doesn't make sense

317
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,280
Speaker 4:  to look like ola, I mean such a minor

318
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,680
Speaker 5:  Upgrade if you had a high quality OLA display and compared it side by side

319
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,840
Speaker 5:  though, you would notice like we can, we can see a difference between the

320
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,800
Speaker 5:  mini l e d in the pro display xcr,

321
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,680
Speaker 5:  which was like the first mini l e d kind of technology that Apple came out

322
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,360
Speaker 5:  with and then it went into the iPad Pro 12.9

323
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,240
Speaker 5:  and it got better in the iPad PRO 12.9 and then it went into

324
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,040
Speaker 5:  the MacBook Pro 14 and 16 and it did get noticeably better when you put them

325
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,440
Speaker 5:  them side by side, there's less blooming because there are more mini

326
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,520
Speaker 5:  LEDs in those laptops than there was on the iPad or

327
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,800
Speaker 5:  the pro display xdr,

328
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,820
Speaker 4:  Right?

329
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,740
Speaker 5:  Maybe if you put the Olet S next to a mini L E d, you would see that

330
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,260
Speaker 5:  kind of same step forward. Okay. Where it's like, okay, now now that blooming

331
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,220
Speaker 5:  I didn't notice before. Oh, I see it now. And I don't see it on

332
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,700
Speaker 5:  the od my thought is that the OD just won't get the same brightness,

333
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,580
Speaker 5:  it just won't hit the same levels of brightness.

334
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,100
Speaker 6:  Well I I think my, my question or my thought for the about why they might

335
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,300
Speaker 6:  do this, if we assume that all the rumors we've heard this week are true,

336
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Speaker 6:  every single thing is going to come true. Exactly. Everything's

337
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,380
Speaker 4:  Gonna happen.

338
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,660
Speaker 5:  Nothing will change

339
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,580
Speaker 6:  That. That some micro l e d is coming from

340
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,300
Speaker 6:  Apple, that they're going to do OED laptops. That the reason why you would

341
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,420
Speaker 6:  have this design target for these 2025 macro pros as OED screens

342
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,060
Speaker 6:  is because you don't think that the micro l e d technology will be ready

343
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,580
Speaker 6:  for a laptop by then. Right? Right. And it may not be ready for several years

344
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,340
Speaker 6:  even after that. Even if they get it in the watch, it could take years to

345
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,820
Speaker 6:  scale up, but

346
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,980
Speaker 4:  It sounds like it's gonna be expensive. Right.

347
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,780
Speaker 5:  Right. So like then the question is do they stick with the mini l e D

348
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,580
Speaker 5:  for until micro l e d is ready in a laptop size?

349
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,500
Speaker 5:  Or do they do this kind of like half step forward with an OED before

350
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,260
Speaker 5:  going the full step to micro? I

351
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,220
Speaker 4:  Guess we did see a lot of ods at CES this year. We saw a lot of OD laptops.

352
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,540
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there's a ton of OD laptops on the market. Like there's,

353
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,620
Speaker 5:  Monica's reviewed a bunch of them. There's, they range in prices now.

354
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,900
Speaker 5:  You can get OED laptops running Windows for about a thousand dollars now.

355
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,020
Speaker 5:  And they do look really good, but they don't hit nearly the brightness of

356
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,740
Speaker 5:  the MacBook Crows like Right. They don't hit the, the regular everyday

357
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,700
Speaker 5:  brightness and they certainly don't hit the HDR brightness. So that's like

358
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,700
Speaker 5:  what mini l e d brings that ole as we've seen it so far,

359
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,900
Speaker 5:  does not. So in two years maybe Ole will have gotten

360
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,740
Speaker 5:  to a point, they, it gets a little bit brighter every year, right? Like the

361
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,220
Speaker 5:  TVs have gotten a little bit brighter every single year. Maybe they'll get

362
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,860
Speaker 5:  a little bit brighter enough to to, to get up to the point of where many

363
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,540
Speaker 5:  l e D is at.

364
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,180
Speaker 6:  The, the last thing that, that I wanted to get on on this particular thing

365
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,820
Speaker 6:  is that it's a turn from Apple. They, they've like, like we've said kind

366
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,180
Speaker 6:  of at the beginning, that they, they were not doing touchscreen laptops.

367
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,860
Speaker 6:  They said they wouldn't do touchscreen laptops now if they would, but

368
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,020
Speaker 6:  if you think about Apple, isn't it kind of, that's their thing is to say

369
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,500
Speaker 6:  that they won't do something and then they later say that they did it and

370
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,580
Speaker 6:  did it better than anyone else.

371
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,380
Speaker 5:  I mean that's, yeah, that's totally Apple's mo. I think what's interesting

372
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,980
Speaker 5:  about the touchscreen though is that it's taken so long for them to make

373
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,060
Speaker 5:  that turn like

374
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,420
Speaker 4:  10 years. 10 years

375
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,180
Speaker 5:  Or more. Even longer. Like even longer. It's probably closer to 15

376
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,340
Speaker 5:  years. And like

377
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,940
Speaker 4:  When Steve was saying absolutely not to touchscreen laptops

378
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,420
Speaker 4:  when he was alive and he'd passed away in what, 20,

379
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,620
Speaker 5:  11,009 or 2010 when they launched the iPad, right?

380
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,460
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

381
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,020
Speaker 4:  He never see this.

382
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,540
Speaker 5:  Yeah. His argument was that like your arm gets tired and it's

383
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,420
Speaker 5:  clumsy trying to use as touch and like that is true if touch is the only

384
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,300
Speaker 5:  way that you interact with it, but guess what, you also have a keyboard and

385
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,160
Speaker 5:  a track pad in front of it. So like, that's why I'm saying like touch is

386
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,040
Speaker 5:  like this third level of interaction. It's not your primary way of using

387
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,720
Speaker 5:  it. But you, we did see Apple, you know, Steve Jobs

388
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,840
Speaker 5:  also said that they would never do a stylist because it would be like, you

389
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,680
Speaker 5:  know, filing down your fingers or something like that. And lo and behold

390
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,400
Speaker 5:  the Apple pencil came out and the apple pencils really good and stuff like

391
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,320
Speaker 5:  that. So like, yes, Apple's done this. Like we will say it's bad or deny

392
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,040
Speaker 5:  it until it happens and then when we do it, it's the best thing ever. It's

393
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,480
Speaker 5:  just what's interesting is how long the Mac has gone without a touch

394
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,800
Speaker 5:  screen and how they've done these kind of like half steps, like the touch

395
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,440
Speaker 5:  bar that didn't really work or take off instead, instead of just doing the

396
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,520
Speaker 5:  thing that everybody wanted was just put a touchscreen on it.

397
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,240
Speaker 4:  All right. We gotta talk about the micro, we've talked about the many

398
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,080
Speaker 4:  LEDs. We've talked about the O LEDs. Oh, I called 'em O LEDs.

399
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's right. We, we, we've talked about the touchscreens. We gotta

400
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,480
Speaker 4:  talk about the micro LEDs because those are only,

401
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,240
Speaker 4:  the rumor is that's only for the watch, right? Dan,

402
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,080
Speaker 4:  walk me through it. Walk us through it.

403
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so here's another, another report from Mark Ena Bloomberg.

404
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,360
Speaker 5:  But this one is backed by some other reporting that we, that Apple

405
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,000
Speaker 5:  is working on micro e d screens, which you've been talking about for a few

406
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,640
Speaker 5:  minutes. The report is that like the Apple is designing its own

407
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
Speaker 5:  displays that it would then work with manufacturers to build, as opposed

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,560
Speaker 5:  to buying already design displays off the shelf and integrating 'em in it's

409
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,880
Speaker 5:  products. And that it will start with

410
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,040
Speaker 5:  making these micro LED screens for the Apple watch, which is currently using

411
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,960
Speaker 5:  OED screens and has since launched. And so this would be like

412
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,920
Speaker 5:  kind of the first major screen technology shift for the Apple

413
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,840
Speaker 5:  Watch. And that is, it's also rumored around the timeline of 24 or

414
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,440
Speaker 5:  25. So we're a little bit ways out. And then once it's in the Apple watch,

415
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,400
Speaker 5:  maybe it would be in a high-end version, like whatever the version of the

416
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,320
Speaker 5:  ultra is at that year, it would show up in there. So it's a little bit lower

417
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,760
Speaker 5:  yield or smaller number of devices out there. And then as Apple

418
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,960
Speaker 5:  figures out, the manufacturing is able to bring the cost down, stuff like

419
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
Speaker 5:  that, it would trickled out to the phones and then the tablets and then eventually

420
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,560
Speaker 5:  probably the, the laptops and the desktop displays. So it's, it's like their

421
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,120
Speaker 5:  next level of display technology. Yeah, and I think as we've just

422
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,880
Speaker 5:  discussed, we can find a really great argument for micro l e d

423
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,160
Speaker 5:  in a tv, in a desktop display, in a laptop display. But

424
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,280
Speaker 5:  once you get down to a smaller handheld size device and once you get down

425
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,160
Speaker 5:  to an Apple watch, especially I I, it's hard for me

426
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,920
Speaker 5:  to see what micro l e d brings to that technology

427
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,240
Speaker 5:  because if you look at the ultra, the watch ultras screen right now, it's

428
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,800
Speaker 5:  bright, it's 2000 nets, it's got incredible viewing angles.

429
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,760
Speaker 5:  It's incredibly vibrant and color rich and it looks like it's

430
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,840
Speaker 5:  painted on the glass already. And all of those things are what Mark Irman

431
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,120
Speaker 5:  is saying, micro l e d brings. And it's like we already had that,

432
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,600
Speaker 4:  That was what, so Chris Welch wrote this really rarely great

433
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,960
Speaker 4:  explainer about the micro L e D watch and the two things he was like, so

434
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,160
Speaker 4:  here are like the big things. It's supposed to do better. It's supposed to

435
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,120
Speaker 4:  have better like, I guess power control because it's LEDs instead of

436
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,800
Speaker 4:  OLEDs and they won't burn, burn in, but they'll do basically the same kind

437
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,640
Speaker 4:  of power control but better somehow and it'll look like it's painted on

438
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,240
Speaker 4:  the screen. And I'm just What does that

439
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:54,840
Speaker 4:  mean?

440
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,370
Speaker 6:  Well, one of the things I wonder is that maybe the, the impulses a

441
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,170
Speaker 6:  if this is the screen size that they think they can make first also. Yeah.

442
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,810
Speaker 6:  Something that I've heard people talk about with micro l e d and we've, we've

443
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,010
Speaker 6:  heard it being talked about to go in virtual reality and augment reality

444
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,810
Speaker 6:  headsets, that kind of tech technology, if you can make the screen a different

445
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,050
Speaker 6:  shape, if you can change maybe the bezel or something like that. If, if it

446
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,530
Speaker 6:  gives them some advantages there maybe that that's a reason for them to put

447
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,450
Speaker 6:  in the watch initially.

448
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,090
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So it's like

449
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:22,730
Speaker 4:  There's,

450
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,490
Speaker 5:  There's probably things that I'm not aware of or not thinking of that

451
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,410
Speaker 5:  it does bring benefits, but at least as in the report that we have about

452
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,330
Speaker 5:  it in the article that Mark wrote and Bloomberg, he said it

453
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,290
Speaker 5:  does these things better color reproduction, better brightness,

454
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,170
Speaker 5:  and better viewing angles. And I'm like, none of those things are a problem

455
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,810
Speaker 5:  on the watch ultra. Like have you, like nobody's complained about any of

456
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,130
Speaker 5:  those things.

457
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,770
Speaker 4:  Dan, you've got an Apple watch. Richard, do you also have an Apple watch?

458
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,730
Speaker 4:  No, I do not. I assume, yeah. What what do you do? You have a smartwatch?

459
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,850
Speaker 6:  I I have a Fitbit somewhere that I I are you free? Yeah. I,

460
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,690
Speaker 6:  I'm untethered.

461
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,290
Speaker 4:  You're free. Oh my gosh. What's

462
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,890
Speaker 6:  That like? I don't know how long I've been standing or if or if I ever did.

463
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,370
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

464
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,250
Speaker 4:  I don't think you like never You just sat and float with

465
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,130
Speaker 4:  your computers all around you. Yes. Three

466
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,090
Speaker 6:  Laptops surrounded by screens.

467
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,900
Speaker 4:  That's newsfeed on all three of them. Yeah, but I've,

468
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,460
Speaker 4:  I don't think I've ever looked at my Apple watch and been like, man that

469
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,300
Speaker 4:  red just doesn't pop the way I wish it did with a micro l e d screen. Like

470
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,780
Speaker 4:  I, I do that with my TV all the time. Yeah. But not my watch.

471
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,680
Speaker 5:  Here's a optimist take, I'm full of them

472
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,000
Speaker 5:  today.

473
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,240
Speaker 4:  You are. You are just pro Apple today.

474
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,640
Speaker 5:  If you look at the Apple Watches user interface,

475
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,480
Speaker 4:  Okay.

476
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,160
Speaker 5:  The design of it is entirely in dark mode. It is designed

477
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,120
Speaker 5:  to take advantage of an OED screen. All the menus are black, all the backgrounds

478
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,840
Speaker 5:  are black. Many of the watch faces have black backgrounds, so on and so forth.

479
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,800
Speaker 5:  There's, I mean Apple's been adding more colorful ones over the years and

480
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,360
Speaker 5:  yes you can do a light watch face or whatever, but the interface that when

481
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,320
Speaker 5:  you jump into menus and stuff like that is all black and that all of that

482
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,240
Speaker 5:  is stemming from power management on the first Apple watches

483
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,200
Speaker 5:  that came out and they used OED screens and OED screens consume

484
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,080
Speaker 5:  less power with black backgrounds because they turn on fewer pixels or whatever.

485
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Speaker 4:  Well they're just not on like those pixels are just off

486
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,760
Speaker 5:  If micro l e d they're just off so they're not using as much power. Yeah,

487
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,400
Speaker 5:  yeah. Or any power when they're off. If micro l e d is

488
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,440
Speaker 5:  able to allow Apple to have the same level of power consumption as

489
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,120
Speaker 5:  the ole and have more interface flexibility, maybe

490
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,000
Speaker 5:  we'll see a revamp of the Apple watches design UI design, which

491
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,560
Speaker 5:  we haven't seen in since basically since it came out.

492
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,240
Speaker 4:  But how does that

493
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,600
Speaker 5:  Work? Oh, maybe we'll see a refresh there. Because this technology allows

494
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,280
Speaker 5:  them to do more flexibility with what the interface looks like and what is

495
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,800
Speaker 5:  displayed on the screen without consuming more power. That could be a thing.

496
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,320
Speaker 4:  But how does it make it more flexible? I just don't

497
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,800
Speaker 5:  That's Well like you could have a white background instead of black,

498
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,360
Speaker 4:  But you're still gonna have the same power draw issues you'd have on an olet.

499
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,240
Speaker 4:  You just wouldn't have to worry about burning.

500
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,680
Speaker 5:  I mean not necessarily.

501
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,450
Speaker 4:  Yeah, because Bo, both micro LEDs and in in OLEDs there, they're whole,

502
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,050
Speaker 4:  the whole idea is that if it's black, that means there's just nothing on

503
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,690
Speaker 4:  Right. It's completely tho those pixels are turned off. So like

504
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,290
Speaker 4:  those power draw issues, I don't know. It's one of those things where one,

505
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,050
Speaker 4:  I'm like the micro l e D thing just doesn't make that much sense. It seems

506
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,890
Speaker 4:  like a weird hill for, for the design wonks that Apple to die

507
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,570
Speaker 4:  on to be like, yes, we're going to pivot so many resources

508
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,010
Speaker 4:  towards a micro L e D screen, the smallest we can make

509
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,610
Speaker 4:  on our wrist instead of these other places where there's genuine use case.

510
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,050
Speaker 4:  Especially well now hold on, hold on. Especially

511
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,970
Speaker 4:  when E Ink exists and has even less power draw.

512
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,170
Speaker 5:  You

513
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,370
Speaker 6:  Walked

514
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,170
Speaker 4:  Right into that one. It's not like you're out here. Yeah, y'all were like,

515
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,330
Speaker 4:  you thought you were getting away with it. Have you

516
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,010
Speaker 5:  Seen ink? I mean come on Alex.

517
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,090
Speaker 4:  Gallery three's

518
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,210
Speaker 5:  Coming. You know what Pebble used Ein? Where's Pebble

519
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:49,970
Speaker 6:  Today? A legend.

520
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,690
Speaker 4:  It wasn't EIN's fault. Pebble's love

521
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,690
Speaker 5:  The pessimist take on this is that Apple is doing this transition

522
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,650
Speaker 5:  and move to get away from having to rely

523
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,970
Speaker 5:  on other companies as much. It can design its own screens and design its

524
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,530
Speaker 5:  own things and design its own margins and et cetera, et cetera. So it's not

525
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,450
Speaker 5:  relying on LG display or Samsung display or Sharp or whoever's, you know,

526
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,210
Speaker 5:  making and designing the screens. That is probably

527
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,930
Speaker 5:  what's driving a lot of this. Unless the technology, which we haven't seen,

528
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,730
Speaker 5:  cuz admittedly I've never seen a micro l e d screen in person. They are only

529
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,530
Speaker 5:  available on like $800,000 TVs that you only get to see if you go to

530
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,370
Speaker 5:  ces. And I didn't go to ces. So exactly

531
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,410
Speaker 4:  The wall, the Samsung wall really

532
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,890
Speaker 6:  Cool. I've, I've seen the Samsung wall, it looked

533
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,570
Speaker 5:  Fun, but like we've never seen it on a phone size device. We'd never seen

534
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,090
Speaker 5:  it on a watch size device. We've never seen it on a laptop size device. We

535
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,890
Speaker 5:  don't, we don't really know how much better it could look in those use

536
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,730
Speaker 5:  cases. So if un unless like if, if it

537
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,690
Speaker 5:  turns out that it's not that much different than OED that we have or the

538
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,330
Speaker 5:  mini l e d that we have, then this reads to me more like a business move

539
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,250
Speaker 5:  in that it allows Apple more control over its pipeline and more control over

540
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,210
Speaker 5:  the profit margins and things like that. It's probably the reality is going

541
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,330
Speaker 5:  to land somewhere in the middle, right? There's, it's going to bring some

542
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,930
Speaker 5:  better technology, better user experience and better display

543
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,530
Speaker 5:  technology to the devices that makes using them easier or better

544
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,530
Speaker 5:  or more enjoyable. But it will also help Apple's business

545
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:13,770
Speaker 5:  case.

546
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,250
Speaker 6:  Hmm. We can settle this easily. We, we can just call our good personal friend

547
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,450
Speaker 6:  Dan Cook. He's got one of the like three the wall displays that have ever

548
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,410
Speaker 6:  been installed and we'll, we'll sit down and watch some stuff and figure

549
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,050
Speaker 6:  out what's good for Yeah.

550
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,210
Speaker 5:  Do we have, do we have

551
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,010
Speaker 4:  To talk to him? Richard? I I would watch you ideally know hang out with

552
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,850
Speaker 4:  Dane Cook. What would you guys talk about? You're just

553
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,890
Speaker 4:  on your phone the whole time. Just like I I don't wanna talk to you or look

554
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,330
Speaker 4:  at the wall. I'm just here because my bosses told me to come.

555
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,560
Speaker 4:  All right. Right. We're gonna take a break and when we come back we're gonna

556
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Speaker 4:  talk more rumors this time, not Apple. We're gonna talk about some Samsung

557
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,080
Speaker 4:  rumors. Big event coming up. Stay tuned

558
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,920
Speaker 4:  and we're back. Dan, I feel like you, you are on rumor

559
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,160
Speaker 4:  patrol today. You are Fleetwood Mac. What's going on with Samsung?

560
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,720
Speaker 4:  That was a big, that was a big claim. You've got a lot to live up to. You're

561
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,120
Speaker 4:  Fleetwood Mac

562
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,040
Speaker 5:  Now. Not a rumor. This is actual real news. They are

563
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,840
Speaker 5:  having an event on February 1st. It is the first Samsung event of the year

564
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,720
Speaker 5:  and we're expecting to see the next generation of the Galaxy S line, which

565
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,640
Speaker 5:  would be the S 23. This is a little bit earlier than Samsung usually has

566
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,120
Speaker 5:  an event. Typically we see it later in February closer to when

567
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,880
Speaker 5:  MWC happens

568
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,720
Speaker 4:  Because they do like Mobile World Congress.

569
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They usually try to beat MWC by like a week or two, but now they're

570
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,680
Speaker 5:  beating it by like a whole month. And it feels like it's coming up really

571
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,400
Speaker 5:  fast after CES for all of us. Such as kind of slogged through Cs, but whatever.

572
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,720
Speaker 5:  It's happening February 1st and today actually

573
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,120
Speaker 5:  we got rumors that of the first like images of the

574
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,880
Speaker 5:  S 23 that we've really seen in terms of renders have leaked and you know,

575
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,840
Speaker 5:  they look like phones.

576
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,800
Speaker 5:  What can we say

577
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,080
Speaker 4:  That? Sure. Is there a phone? The

578
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,000
Speaker 5:  Thing, the thing with the S 23 launch is that like, this is not like the,

579
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,760
Speaker 5:  the, the area that Samsung really like pushes boundaries, right? That happens

580
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,720
Speaker 5:  with the folding phones later in the year. This is like the mainstream galaxy

581
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,880
Speaker 5:  phones that most people, at least here in the US if you're buying an Android

582
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,720
Speaker 5:  phone, you're probably buying a Galaxy S phone. And this is like when

583
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,200
Speaker 5:  the, these look

584
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,040
Speaker 4:  Like iPhones,

585
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,480
Speaker 5:  They look well they, I mean they look like Galaxy S phones. They really haven't

586
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,440
Speaker 5:  changed the design on these front of a couple

587
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,720
Speaker 4:  Years. These photos? No, the camera modules. Yes.

588
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,080
Speaker 5:  So

589
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,240
Speaker 4:  It looks like the camera modules look Samsung, but everything else looks,

590
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,440
Speaker 4:  it

591
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,720
Speaker 5:  Looks like they've iPhone eliminated the camera bump, which would be a change

592
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,560
Speaker 5:  in that. Like it's slightly thinner now. It's not as wobbly when you put

593
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,840
Speaker 5:  it on a table and things like that. But these are slab smartphones. That's

594
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,800
Speaker 5:  not a bump. They're not like breaking the, the mold here with what this

595
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,880
Speaker 5:  design looks like and stuff like that. You can expect it to have the latest

596
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,600
Speaker 5:  Qualcomm chip inside of it. That's a pretty much a given. It will probably

597
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,280
Speaker 5:  have upgraded cameras, it might have a slightly better, slightly brighter

598
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,200
Speaker 5:  display. It's likely that there will be the S 23, the S 23

599
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,000
Speaker 5:  plus the S 23 ultra, just like the S 22 models that preceded it.

600
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,000
Speaker 5:  And so, you know, there will be the S 23 ultra

601
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Speaker 5:  would be the top of the line that's probably gonna have a stylist and the

602
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,840
Speaker 5:  most cameras and the latest technology and stuff like that. And then the

603
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,400
Speaker 5:  other models will have some features stripped out or just smaller size screens.

604
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,120
Speaker 6:  Can we expect a sprint exclusive Galaxy S 23 Epic

605
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,160
Speaker 6:  to 5G with a hardware keyboard? Is that, is that likely that Sprint

606
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,400
Speaker 5:  Yes. Still existed? I'm sure you could have

607
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,280
Speaker 4:  Where's gonna be our Army green one with like the plastic case

608
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,400
Speaker 4:  so that you can check it outta your car, it'll survive. That's always my

609
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,760
Speaker 4:  favorite like variation on the s the Galaxy

610
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,400
Speaker 5:  S six. Yeah, they haven't done like the, the active models in a couple of

611
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,600
Speaker 5:  years. I don't think. Those were always like the ones that like were super

612
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,680
Speaker 5:  chunky and rugged and could like take a beating, but they, it's been a while

613
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,880
Speaker 5:  since I've seen one of those release. They should just do that with the regular

614
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,680
Speaker 5:  line. Just make it more rugged. Yeah,

615
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,480
Speaker 4:  Just gimme some chunky phones. Yeah. But like the thing that's really throwing

616
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,280
Speaker 4:  me on looking at these renders is the wallpaper on these things just looks

617
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,480
Speaker 4:  ripped straight from Apple a couple of years ago when they first did the

618
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,280
Speaker 4:  notch and they tried to hide the notch, you know, by the, by doing like all

619
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,240
Speaker 4:  the color but curved on one side, just barely missing the notch. All of these

620
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,520
Speaker 4:  have the exact same wallpaper.

621
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean I would say that's not a new move for Samsung. When they first

622
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,760
Speaker 5:  launched phones with the whole punch camera, they did the same thing with

623
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,200
Speaker 5:  their, their wallpaper. They, they like hit it. It just like with the way

624
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
Speaker 5:  the wallpaper promo wallpaper worked.

625
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,600
Speaker 4:  That's wild. Do you think is, is this one gonna have a notch or is it gonna

626
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,200
Speaker 4:  be a hole punch?

627
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,480
Speaker 5:  Oh, it's almost definitely a hole punch based on these rumors or based on

628
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,920
Speaker 5:  these images.

629
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,040
Speaker 4:  It is just the most iPhone looking Samsung device I've seen

630
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,840
Speaker 4:  in a very long time. Like they usually don't ape Apple

631
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,480
Speaker 4:  to this extent. And this looks real iPhoney.

632
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,200
Speaker 5:  Well if you look at the S 22 and the S 21 before it, it kind of had

633
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,040
Speaker 5:  some more distinctive like design traits around, especially particularly

634
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,800
Speaker 5:  around the camera. Like you had that like metal housing that like bent

635
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,520
Speaker 5:  into the metal frame of the phone and stuff like that. And that was kind

636
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,120
Speaker 5:  of pretty distinctive design tree. And now it's like

637
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,720
Speaker 5:  they seem to be removing that. They seem to be going with, it's hard to tell

638
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,600
Speaker 5:  exactly, but maybe the sides are a little bit more square, which is giving

639
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,440
Speaker 5:  you that iPhone as type of look to the modern iPhones and stuff like that.

640
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,560
Speaker 5:  The can, the back is very plain. It's just three, three holes.

641
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,120
Speaker 5:  There's no like adornment to it and things like that. So I,

642
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,000
Speaker 4:  What's seven?

643
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,760
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I mean like obviously we have not seen these things in person.

644
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:26,800
Speaker 5:  We are working off of like the very first kind of image leaks that we've

645
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,400
Speaker 5:  seen so far. But yeah, I'm with you that like these aren't super exciting

646
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,600
Speaker 5:  looking,

647
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,000
Speaker 6:  Perhaps they just don't care anymore. Look, you've got how many engineers

648
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,440
Speaker 6:  devoted to making the Galaxy folks hinge work in the screen?

649
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
Speaker 6:  Notre. So

650
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,080
Speaker 4:  Just the guy being like, oh yes, I

651
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,400
Speaker 5:  I I

652
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,840
Speaker 6:  Have a feeling they don't have that much time.

653
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,360
Speaker 5:  We sell way more S 20 threes or

654
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,560
Speaker 6:  S and also everyone else's phones look like this too. So maybe you're not

655
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
Speaker 6:  so worried about saying, oh, we're copying Apple. You say look at a phone.

656
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,720
Speaker 6:  It is what phones, this is what phones look like.

657
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,240
Speaker 5:  Yes. For better or worse,

658
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,680
Speaker 4:  Do you think this is gonna be the year? Samsung's just like, thems are phones.

659
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,440
Speaker 4:  Here's your phones. Take 'em. All right, see you next year. Like do you think

660
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,680
Speaker 4:  they're gonna put a lot of effort into

661
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,560
Speaker 5:  The Sun Pack? That's not Sam Sex. Yes. Well, so the, oh I, I didn't

662
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,280
Speaker 5:  even mention this is their first in-person unpacked event in like three years.

663
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,680
Speaker 5:  I think they're gonna go all out. I think they're like the last

664
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,280
Speaker 4:  Big speech.

665
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,800
Speaker 5:  I don't remember the last in-person unpacked event. I went to

666
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,760
Speaker 5:  myself but up until the pandemic they were like

667
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,720
Speaker 5:  doing these like really tech-heavy

668
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,440
Speaker 5:  presentations. Like the

669
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,400
Speaker 4:  Super elaborate

670
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,480
Speaker 5:  Oh super elaborate. They had like stages with screens underneath the presenters

671
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,440
Speaker 5:  and curved up behind them and all of like orchestral music and everything

672
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,200
Speaker 5:  was like this big production and stuff like that. And I think they might

673
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,000
Speaker 5:  be really excited to go do that again cuz they haven't been able to really

674
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,600
Speaker 5:  do that because you don't really get that same impression through a virtual

675
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,800
Speaker 5:  presentation.

676
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,760
Speaker 4:  So we're gonna get something besides these phones then, right? Because it's

677
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,000
Speaker 4:  gonna be really sad if they're like, look at this incredible stage and here's

678
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,440
Speaker 4:  the phone. Richard said we don't really care about an he's correct

679
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,080
Speaker 4:  enjoy. Like they can't, there's gonna be other cool stuff they're gonna have

680
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,520
Speaker 4:  at it. Like head we, there were some headphone rumors this week, right? Did

681
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,120
Speaker 4:  I read that right?

682
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,160
Speaker 5:  Well they've, they've released a new feature for the existing Galaxy Buds

683
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,960
Speaker 5:  two Pro, which just came out last August. So you can now record 3D

684
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,600
Speaker 5:  audio with them. So that's kind of cool. I don't know, I haven't

685
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,600
Speaker 5:  seen any rumors for headphones and I haven't seen any rumors for wearables.

686
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,320
Speaker 5:  Samsung had a really big fall for wearables.

687
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,240
Speaker 5:  They launched the Galaxy Watch five, they will launch the Watch five Pro

688
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,960
Speaker 5:  and they've been pretty well received and pretty popular. So I'd be surprised

689
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,440
Speaker 5:  if we see any wearables that's not typically happen at, at this year's or

690
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,040
Speaker 5:  this time of year event. It's really, they focus on the S line because the

691
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,120
Speaker 5:  S line is their moneymaker.

692
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,520
Speaker 4:  Okay. And no, no note the note's dead, right?

693
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,840
Speaker 5:  No, the s the S 22 essentially embodied the note last

694
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,320
Speaker 5:  year and it's pretty reasonable to expect that the S 23

695
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,240
Speaker 5:  Ultra will embody the note. It'll have the stylus and

696
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,880
Speaker 5:  the more squared off design that works well with the stylus for running

697
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,560
Speaker 4:  On the screen. Well it's coming February 1st. You guys get excited. We'll

698
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,720
Speaker 4:  absolutely have, we'll probably see more rumors not far away before then.

699
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,840
Speaker 4:  We'll, we'll have a big breakdown of it beforehand. It's gonna be great.

700
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,920
Speaker 4:  Richard. There's also, there was some news with H B O Max. There's a

701
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,880
Speaker 4:  bunch of news this this week I feel like for H B O Max, the Minx. This was,

702
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,240
Speaker 4:  this is something I personally was very excited about, Minx was the show

703
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,360
Speaker 4:  that nobody watched. Look at your faces. You've ne do you even know what

704
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,160
Speaker 5:  Minx is? I watched Minx. I thought they canceled it.

705
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,400
Speaker 4:  They did. They canceled it.

706
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,920
Speaker 6:  HBO o I only heard of it when you said that they canceled it.

707
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,480
Speaker 4:  You're like, oh bummer. But so Minx was this show about

708
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,360
Speaker 4:  like seventies Feminist Porno Magazine. It was on H B O max.

709
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,040
Speaker 4:  It got canceled. Stars has now picked it up Oh. And

710
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,880
Speaker 4:  is gonna be airing the second season cuz they filmed a whole second season

711
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,640
Speaker 4:  and then H B o Max was like, no, we don't wanna pay for it. Take it. We don't

712
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,320
Speaker 4:  want it. And so it's going on Stars, which happens to be owned by

713
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,800
Speaker 4:  Legendary, which also produced banks. But it's like, it's good, it's kind

714
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,640
Speaker 4:  of good news cuz we had so many weeks of stuff getting canceled and just

715
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,800
Speaker 4:  disappearing and getting yanked from the service. So it's nice to know that

716
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,560
Speaker 4:  some of this stuff is gonna find a home. I hope. I really wanna see what

717
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,200
Speaker 4:  happens in that back half of the nevers.

718
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,000
Speaker 6:  And meanwhile on HBO Max where you're getting less than you used to get,

719
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,960
Speaker 6:  you will now be paying more on, at least on the app pre-plan. It's

720
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,720
Speaker 6:  getting $1 more expensive effective today if you're a new subscriber, I think

721
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,520
Speaker 6:  kicking in like next month, if you already subscribed

722
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,280
Speaker 6:  15 99 0

723
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,120
Speaker 5:  Warning, how much more will I have to pay to mooch my father-in-law's

724
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,960
Speaker 5:  cable account that gives me access to H B O Max? Well

725
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,920
Speaker 6:  You you've seen it with Netflix. It starts with with price hikes all the

726
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,760
Speaker 6:  time. And then suddenly they're like, you know what? We're not so into password

727
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,000
Speaker 6:  sharing.

728
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

729
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:37,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

730
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,200
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be a sad

731
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Speaker 6:  Day. Like, so, so I think you're gonna see kind of all, all the streamers

732
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,400
Speaker 6:  go down the same path. And that's something that Emma Roth wrote, wrote about

733
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,360
Speaker 6:  recently about why streaming all of these plans is getting more expensive.

734
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,560
Speaker 6:  We, we know that Netflix has had price hikes every year,

735
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,640
Speaker 4:  Right?

736
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,480
Speaker 6:  Just about for several years now.

737
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,360
Speaker 5:  Apple TV raised its price a month or two ago. Yep.

738
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,680
Speaker 6:  The price of Disney Plus is going up now there's, they're bringing in ad

739
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,600
Speaker 6:  packages. HBO already had the a, the ad package so

740
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,640
Speaker 6:  that you kind of had that option. But they started at 15 bucks essentially

741
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,280
Speaker 6:  two years ago, you know, years ago now we, or almost three years ago. Wow.

742
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,920
Speaker 6:  2020.

743
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:13,800
Speaker 4:  Woo.

744
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:19,370
Speaker 6:  It has been a pandemic, but they, they had not raised the price, but

745
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:23,050
Speaker 6:  they started high at that, at that time it was a, it was a bit more expensive

746
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,810
Speaker 6:  than, than Netflix and everything else because, because it was hbo o but

747
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,250
Speaker 6:  now HBO Max is the, the primary HBO o and, and

748
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,250
Speaker 6:  I don't know, I'm, I'm not sure how people feel about this. I feel like if

749
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,050
Speaker 6:  if you were enjoying paying for HBO Max, you're not necessarily worried about

750
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,370
Speaker 6:  it at a dollar more, but you might miss some of the content that they've

751
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,770
Speaker 6:  pulled. And I, I wonder how it's gonna go when they, when they blend together

752
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,610
Speaker 6:  the HBO O max and discovery apps

753
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,490
Speaker 5:  And, and

754
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,450
Speaker 4:  Then this is just, this is just the ad free version

755
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,170
Speaker 4:  of HBO O max. Yes. Which is, which was historically the

756
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,610
Speaker 4:  same price as what you would pay to subscribe to HBO Max. Right.

757
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,450
Speaker 4:  Through your cable network. But nobody has cable anymore except for Dan's

758
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,570
Speaker 4:  father-in-law. So

759
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,490
Speaker 5:  I hope he never cuts the cord.

760
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,850
Speaker 6:  It, it's, it's just me. I'm, I'm the only person who still has

761
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,530
Speaker 4:  Cable. Those people are still gonna be paying $15 a month. The rest of us

762
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,370
Speaker 4:  are gonna be paying $16 a month.

763
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,370
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And

764
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,610
Speaker 4:  So everybody,

765
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,970
Speaker 5:  I don't, I mean, like, to Rich's point, I don't think that's a trick. This

766
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,770
Speaker 5:  is not the price hike that causes people to cancel. Yeah. But it

767
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,370
Speaker 5:  is just telling of like where this is going. So like then like in a couple

768
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,170
Speaker 5:  years, it eventually it'll be another $2 price hike or whatever. They're

769
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,610
Speaker 5:  going to get to that $20 price point where Netflix is already at for its

770
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,530
Speaker 5:  4K plan. And then you combine that with they

771
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,450
Speaker 5:  are removing things, they're removing old shows, they are removing

772
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,770
Speaker 5:  canceling new shows and stuff like that. And now it's just like, I don't

773
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,650
Speaker 5:  know. It, it ain't great. I

774
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,610
Speaker 4:  Mean, you know, if, if if, if, if my best friend David

775
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,650
Speaker 4:  Zaslav was here with us today, he would say, well look, we, we added

776
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,570
Speaker 4:  Fixer Upper, we added some other TLC shows that only

777
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,970
Speaker 4:  my mom and my sister watch. I love you both, but you have trash taste in

778
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,330
Speaker 4:  TV and film and you're not listening to this cuz you have trash taste. So

779
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,730
Speaker 4:  you're not even listening to the best show on, on, on podcast networks ever.

780
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,730
Speaker 4:  Rude. But like, like they, they have

781
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,450
Speaker 4:  added stuff. They've pulled a lot out. They pulled a lot out that we, that

782
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,330
Speaker 4:  most of us can considered kind of core H B O stuff.

783
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,450
Speaker 4:  Really high quality cartoons, really high quality TV shows. They pulled that

784
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,010
Speaker 4:  Westworld, I think is probably the most notable example of a show that just

785
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:29,690
Speaker 4:  got like, just gone like, oh, you didn't catch up on season

786
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,090
Speaker 4:  four.

787
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,040
Speaker 6:  I I, I was shocked. Like I knew that they had pulled it, it, but when I actually

788
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,920
Speaker 6:  went to HBO O Max and I searched for it and it wasn't there, I I I just,

789
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,840
Speaker 6:  I didn't even know how to feel.

790
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you're just

791
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,080
Speaker 5:  Like, I mean

792
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,840
Speaker 6:  Honestly didn't watch and I haven't watched since the first season. So it

793
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,520
Speaker 6:  was, it was a vest.

794
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,560
Speaker 5:  I mean I, I think that was in the interest of

795
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,480
Speaker 5:  public health to remove Westworld and so nobody

796
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,600
Speaker 5:  fell down that, that rabbit hole of watching Westworld.

797
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,680
Speaker 4:  The, like this is the only reason Eli is, that's actually probably what NEI

798
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,440
Speaker 4:  is doing. He found some old copies of Westworld. Somebody, somebody sent

799
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,360
Speaker 4:  him some, that's where he is right now, furiously watching that season

800
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,320
Speaker 4:  four. He's the only one. It was just him and David Zaslav who then

801
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,880
Speaker 4:  said absolutely not kill it, kick it off the network. But

802
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,840
Speaker 4:  yeah, I'm like, I think he, Zov would say we we're adding a bunch of content,

803
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,840
Speaker 4:  we're gonna be adding more with this, with this new

804
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,480
Speaker 4:  product that they haven't, that may be called Max just

805
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,160
Speaker 4:  Simply Max, which is a terrible name, great name for a kid,

806
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,440
Speaker 4:  terrible name for a streaming network. And my question

807
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,280
Speaker 4:  is, are they gonna increase the price again? Are we gonna see Max rollout

808
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,120
Speaker 4:  in six months and then have to pay even more money?

809
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,240
Speaker 5:  No, I don't, I don't think they'll increase it in six months. When, when,

810
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,920
Speaker 5:  when they roll out Max, they'll keep the price the same and they will say,

811
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,640
Speaker 6:  And that's why they raised it now. Like that's,

812
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,520
Speaker 5:  That's the reason. Yeah. They raise it now. So, so they, they will be able

813
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,160
Speaker 5:  to keep it the same and then a year later, six months after that or whatever,

814
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,000
Speaker 5:  okay, then you'll, you'll get the price hike for that and then they'll, it's

815
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,280
Speaker 5:  just like a a, a frog in boiling water. It's, they just keep little turning

816
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,760
Speaker 5:  up the heat over time and then you just keep paying it until you realize

817
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,720
Speaker 5:  like, wait a minute, Netflix isn't worth $20 a month and you cancel it like

818
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:07,960
Speaker 5:  I do.

819
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,080
Speaker 4:  I mean I still pay for all of them. I have no money

820
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,040
Speaker 4:  for anything. Someone helped me figure out how to budget. Can't

821
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,520
Speaker 4:  pay my rent. But I can pay for HBO Max, but I won't pay for Max. I

822
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,440
Speaker 6:  Told you about cryptocurrency.

823
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,560
Speaker 4:  Richard. Richard, no, I I can't lose any more money to you, sir.

824
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,600
Speaker 4:  I have to, I have to like, I have to have a retirement at some point. Living

825
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,240
Speaker 4:  in your house. The, I guess the other kind of

826
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:37,840
Speaker 4:  news for me that was really surprising this week was John Deere

827
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,000
Speaker 4:  saying, we're gonna allow you to repair tractors, which is

828
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,880
Speaker 4:  a big moment for Right to repair advocates. I mean, nobody here

829
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,520
Speaker 4:  has a tractor to my knowledge. Unclear. Dan, you do you have a tractor?

830
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:50,800
Speaker 5:  No,

831
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,920
Speaker 4:  Richard, Richard lost his tractor in the cryptocurrency.

832
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,480
Speaker 6:  It was unfortunate I took some lost on Ethereum.

833
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,560
Speaker 5:  Stop. Yeah, I mean, to be fair, these, these, these we're talking about like

834
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,120
Speaker 5:  tractors, commercial level tractors.

835
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,880
Speaker 4:  No, no, no. We're talking about

836
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,440
Speaker 6:  Stuff like that. No, there's, you

837
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,680
Speaker 4:  Gotta move that hay. You gotta, you gotta feed the

838
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,120
Speaker 6:  Cows. Not that far from where I live. They have a John Deere like facility

839
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,800
Speaker 6:  where you can see these huge tractors and combines driving around on the

840
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,640
Speaker 6:  streets all the time. It's, it's a amazing, like seeing them in person

841
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,720
Speaker 6:  is really isn't so inspiring. It's just like, I can't believe something is

842
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,040
Speaker 6:  that big.

843
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,080
Speaker 4:  They're fun to sit in.

844
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,640
Speaker 5:  So is it, isn't there a huge catch with this John Deere news though? Yes.

845
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,800
Speaker 6:  It's been kind of a flashpoint over the last few years in, in the Right to

846
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,520
Speaker 6:  repair thing because farmers have a lot of kind of cultural

847
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,480
Speaker 6:  cache, political economic importance, you know, to to everything

848
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,080
Speaker 6:  that we do. And they've been saying that we have a problem. The trucks,

849
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,160
Speaker 6:  the, the tractors and, and all of this farm equipment is getting more technology

850
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,000
Speaker 6:  based. They have to repair things on the farm. They're, they're not near

851
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,800
Speaker 6:  some, like they can't go to the Apple store when, when their tractor breaks

852
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,480
Speaker 6:  down. Right. If they wanna fix apart, if they need to make, if they need

853
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,280
Speaker 6:  to tweak something because it's not working for, for what they're doing,

854
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,880
Speaker 6:  they wanna be able to do it. They wanna be able to get in there. Some, some

855
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,760
Speaker 6:  of these people who are on farms have computer experience are, you know,

856
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,480
Speaker 6:  kind of hacking them and doing their own thing. Making them run doom if they

857
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,160
Speaker 6:  want to. Yeah. And John Deere doesn't like that or hasn't liked that

858
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,720
Speaker 6:  and, and has pushed back. But now, yes, with, with this agreement,

859
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:20,920
Speaker 6:  they sort of said that farmers should be able to repair

860
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,560
Speaker 6:  their own tractors, but there are some loopholes that kind of allow them

861
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,040
Speaker 6:  to get out of this deal if they want to. So, so it's not because it

862
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,080
Speaker 4:  Wasn't with the government, it's with this agreement isn't with the government,

863
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,760
Speaker 4:  it's just with like a group of, it is like an organized group of very

864
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,160
Speaker 4:  passionate farmers. Also, if you call those organized groups where they all

865
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,600
Speaker 4:  collectively come together to make bargaining agreements and stuff. A union

866
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,000
Speaker 4:  don't, doesn't go Well I did it one time,

867
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,960
Speaker 4:  do not recommend, but, but this was with the what? The

868
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,360
Speaker 4:  American

869
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,400
Speaker 6:  American Farm Bureau Federation.

870
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah, the American Farm, bureau of Federation, not a federal organization,

871
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,040
Speaker 4:  just a group closely tied with the federal government, closely tied with

872
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,880
Speaker 4:  farmers, technically an independent group as far as I know. And, and they

873
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,200
Speaker 4:  just, they, they, the agreement was, yeah, we agree to let you

874
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,520
Speaker 4:  do it up until a point. And also we reserve the right to

875
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,400
Speaker 4:  rescind it at any point, if any right. To repair law at the

876
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,520
Speaker 4:  state or federal level comes out that we don't like. Yeah. So basically

877
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:20,880
Speaker 4:  do it our way or

878
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,800
Speaker 6:  Else they've turned this group in into an ally for them and

879
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,160
Speaker 6:  an enemy against people trying to pass these right to repair laws potentially.

880
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,560
Speaker 6:  And

881
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,640
Speaker 5:  You might remember New York just passed a right to repair law the end

882
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,600
Speaker 5:  of this year, which is like pretty groundbreaking and, and, and was a

883
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,720
Speaker 5:  new level for it. However, at the last minute, just before it went live,

884
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,600
Speaker 5:  there was a huge change to it that, you know, it doesn't apply to

885
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,960
Speaker 5:  farm equipment and it doesn't kind of apply to the things that people want

886
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,680
Speaker 5:  from John, from John Deere. So, so that already is on the books,

887
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,800
Speaker 5:  but I guess John Deere's happy with that one. And I guess if one came out

888
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,080
Speaker 5:  where it did apply to their equipment, then they would say, all right, well

889
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,160
Speaker 5:  we're, we're out of this agreement.

890
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,080
Speaker 4:  Now it gives me, it gives me the wikis,

891
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,680
Speaker 5:  But I mean, if it's a law, they're forced to comply. So like whatever, right?

892
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,720
Speaker 5:  Like if, if a law comes out, they have to comply, right?

893
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,400
Speaker 4:  But right now they basically are pitting, they're basically saying, okay,

894
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,520
Speaker 4:  farmers, you can either put your weight behind this law and

895
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,840
Speaker 4:  get your right to your little fancy right to repair laws that you think will

896
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,400
Speaker 4:  solve everything passed. Or you can join with us

897
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,360
Speaker 4:  and we'll let you do most of what you want without having to worry about

898
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,920
Speaker 4:  laws, without having to worry about going and talk, writing your congressman.

899
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,440
Speaker 4:  That's so boring. Just work with us. Like it's a very

900
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,120
Speaker 4:  seductive routine going on here. Not a romantically

901
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,560
Speaker 4:  seductive. Just seductive.

902
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I don't, I

903
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,360
Speaker 4:  Don't trust them. No, don't trust them. This always, always makes me think

904
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,960
Speaker 4:  of like how 1930s people were getting very,

905
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,280
Speaker 4:  I'm going back in time, y'all, I'm sorry. 1930s people were getting super

906
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,640
Speaker 4:  upset about film. They felt there was, there was too much titillation in

907
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,280
Speaker 4:  film. They felt too much was happening. So they said, we're gonna start passing

908
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,720
Speaker 4:  a bunch of censorship laws to censor how films and TV are being made, or

909
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,400
Speaker 4:  TV didn't exist, how films are being made. And all of the, the film companies

910
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,280
Speaker 4:  got together and said, no, we're gonna figure our own thing out with absolutely

911
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,160
Speaker 4:  no oversight from the government. Theoretically. Good thing that then created

912
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,560
Speaker 4:  the Hayes code, which is made by like this guy who was like a

913
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,560
Speaker 4:  preacher and had very strong feelings and a lot of them were really racist

914
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,240
Speaker 4:  and sexist and homophobic. And then they made the MP a,

915
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,000
Speaker 4:  which has continued in, perpetuated a lot of that racist and sexist at

916
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,960
Speaker 4:  homophobic stuff when like maybe just some little regulation

917
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,680
Speaker 4:  of like, Hey, if it's got certain titillating things going on,

918
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,160
Speaker 4:  maybe reconsider having kids go and see that without permission from their

919
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,440
Speaker 5:  Parents. A similar thing happened with, with music too.

920
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,480
Speaker 4:  I don't know, maybe, am I calling for more regulation? A similar thing. I

921
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,720
Speaker 4:  feel like I'm calling for sensitive regulation ever. Yeah.

922
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,840
Speaker 5:  Politically, this is, it's a industry trying to come up with

923
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:52,000
Speaker 5:  to a self-regulation to prevent government interference for sure. Because

924
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,720
Speaker 5:  government interference might do things that they don't agree or like,

925
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,760
Speaker 5:  and sometimes it's been effective and sometimes it works. I don't know how

926
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,880
Speaker 5:  effective parental advisory stickers were when I was a kid, cause that just

927
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,080
Speaker 5:  made me want to buy it more. But you know. Ooh, when

928
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,080
Speaker 4:  You say that Emma on there, you're like, I need that. That's the am I allowed

929
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,960
Speaker 4:  to have it? I don't care. That's the one I want. Yeah. I just murdered

930
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,840
Speaker 4:  so many people. I'm now I have nightmares, but, all right,

931
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,640
Speaker 4:  well, we're gonna take a break for a second. It's got really dark. We're

932
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,960
Speaker 4:  gonna say, okay. I know it got really dark. Somebody say something funny

933
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,760
Speaker 4:  quick. No, no. Funny. All right. Okay. I love those, those mature

934
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,760
Speaker 4:  rated games, but we should probably move on. So we're gonna take a break

935
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,320
Speaker 4:  and when we come back, we're gonna try to have a lightning round. Some really

936
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,120
Speaker 4:  fun gadgets this week. Did I select all the gadgets this week? You

937
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,680
Speaker 4:  be the judge.

938
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,920
Speaker 5:  I, I wonder how you'll be able to tell.

939
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,840
Speaker 4:  All right, we'll be back.

00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,950
Speaker 4:  And we're back. I think the thing I really wanna talk about

959
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,870
Speaker 4:  was somebody over last week sent me a video

960
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,230
Speaker 4:  of a guy wearing glasses that had E ink built into it. And I got so

961
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,110
Speaker 4:  mad. I was furious. And then Sheena today saw the exact same video

962
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,230
Speaker 4:  in her own like work throughout the day and was like, I have to blog

963
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:20,710
Speaker 4:  about this with the exact same amount of fury I had. And it was a

964
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,270
Speaker 4:  beautiful, beautiful moment. So thank you Sheena for that. But these things

965
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:27,790
Speaker 4:  are called, hold on. This is from a startup called Soul

966
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,990
Speaker 4:  Reader. It's an, they, they're claiming it's gonna be about

967
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,950
Speaker 4:  $350. They're working with Palmer Lucky who, who made the, the

968
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,790
Speaker 4:  ocu who founded Oculus and then went off to do a bunch of like,

969
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,910
Speaker 4:  he's like in satellites now or something, right? Like he's, he was making,

970
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,470
Speaker 4:  he's in government surveillance. Yeah, he's building like weapons and surveillance

971
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,470
Speaker 4:  systems and stuff, but I guess he took a break from building weapons and

972
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,670
Speaker 4:  surveillance systems to work with this company called Soul Reader on these

973
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,670
Speaker 4:  $350 E Ink glasses.

974
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,230
Speaker 4:  They're just a hands-free display, but instead of like a

975
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,950
Speaker 4:  color display in there, it's E ink. Totally opaque e

976
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:06,910
Speaker 4:  ink. Okay. I don't understand why it exists,

977
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,950
Speaker 4:  but I'm really like, like part of me is delighted by it.

978
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:14,710
Speaker 4:  Cause I want new uses of E ink, but the other part of me is horrified by

979
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,150
Speaker 4:  it because who needs this? What

980
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:19,790
Speaker 5:  Does this delight you as much as BMW's car that's covered in ein

981
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,230
Speaker 5:  panels?

982
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,670
Speaker 4:  No, because that's cool. I want a car that has color chaining panels

983
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,790
Speaker 4:  on it. I wanna like go through a tunnel and come out the other side and be

984
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:31,390
Speaker 4:  like, ah, I'm a whole new person. It's red now. That's neat. This is like,

985
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,470
Speaker 4:  I wanna put some glasses on and I guess just hang out

986
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,710
Speaker 4:  and, and read that way. I think there, there's probably definitely a use

987
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:42,610
Speaker 4:  case for people who don't have as much mobility, but I'm

988
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,970
Speaker 4:  still a little confused by their existence

989
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,010
Speaker 6:  As a person who spent an ungodly amount of money to buy an item in a video

990
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,450
Speaker 6:  game that doesn't make me any better at the game. And, and then bought a

991
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:56,410
Speaker 6:  version of that in real life to represent the useless item in the game that

992
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,610
Speaker 6:  is also useless in real life.

993
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,610
Speaker 6:  I think the problem with this is that it's a little too useful. It's too

994
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,090
Speaker 6:  close to being useful. Like, like you said, like they're, they're kind of

995
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,850
Speaker 6:  use cases for it, but still it's, it's glasses that you would put

996
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,810
Speaker 6:  on to read something and you'd pay $350 for

997
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,570
Speaker 6:  that experience. And then the only thing you would be able to do is read

998
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:16,930
Speaker 6:  something,

999
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:17,490
Speaker 4:  Right?

1000
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,370
Speaker 6:  First of all, words are evil and bad and written. The written word

1001
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:21,890
Speaker 6:  shouldn't exist.

1002
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,770
Speaker 6:  Second, rich. Rich,

1003
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,160
Speaker 5:  Do you, you know what your job is,

1004
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:26,920
Speaker 9:  My dude.

1005
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:30,400
Speaker 5:  Do you know what we do here?

1006
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,920
Speaker 6:  Look

1007
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,520
Speaker 4:  What you do. Richard does something very different

1008
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,720
Speaker 6:  The, with the way I do it

1009
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,760
Speaker 9:  Just

1010
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,720
Speaker 5:  With, with such utter hate and distaste for each word that comes out of

1011
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,000
Speaker 5:  the keyboard,

1012
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,360
Speaker 6:  Ev every day

1013
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,320
Speaker 4:  Just mercilessly killing all that copy

1014
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:53,320
Speaker 6:  Re regretfully. But I, I, I certainly wouldn't want just the

1015
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,920
Speaker 6:  written word to be my entire experience and interaction with the world. It

1016
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,480
Speaker 6:  just, I, I just can't do it. And, and, and I can see how it's useful that

1017
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,200
Speaker 6:  that's, I think that's the problem is that it's too close to being something

1018
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,200
Speaker 6:  that's u useful. If it were completely useless, I'd be into it.

1019
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:10,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Do you guys remember a few years ago there was a trend of gadgets that

1020
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,920
Speaker 5:  were like visors that you put on that were like video screens

1021
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,640
Speaker 5:  and they had headphones attached? Yes. And it was supposed to be like this

1022
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,400
Speaker 5:  like personal theater experience. I think de had

1023
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,880
Speaker 5:  reviewed one. They're

1024
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,600
Speaker 6:  Still getting promoted on YouTube. Like, like people still see them. We,

1025
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:25,840
Speaker 6:  we,

1026
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:26,520
Speaker 9:  It

1027
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,640
Speaker 5:  That's like what this is except for reading.

1028
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,480
Speaker 4:  It's an Instagram commercial. Yeah. So you can read all of

1029
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,920
Speaker 5:  Your stuff. I I have never seen anyone outside of ces. See

1030
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,760
Speaker 6:  It was that la See, was that last word that you said that that was I was

1031
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,960
Speaker 6:  into it until you said reading.

1032
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,800
Speaker 4:  I said nope. It did video. Richard might be into it, but otherwise, nope.

1033
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,000
Speaker 4:  All right. Richard, what, what's your, what's your gadget of the week? What's,

1034
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,080
Speaker 4:  what's, what's got you excited?

1035
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,160
Speaker 6:  Chris person brought the Pine seal into everyone's life.

1036
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,410
Speaker 4:  He did. People got excited in, in at the Verge

1037
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,650
Speaker 6:  About this. I, I don't fully understand what it is. And, and again, that

1038
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:01,450
Speaker 6:  is the key to making it interesting is it's $25. It plugs into U S b. I don't

1039
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:03,450
Speaker 6:  know what it does, but I want one, I need it right now.

1040
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:10,410
Speaker 9:  So

1041
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,850
Speaker 9:  Richard read the first line of the article

1042
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:18,130
Speaker 5:  And then just stopped Cause words bad.

1043
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,170
Speaker 9:  Yeah, so he doesn't know what it does, but he got his 25 bucks,

1044
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,210
Speaker 4:  He's got four of them now.

1045
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,010
Speaker 6:  I'm just saying it's a better way to live.

1046
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,810
Speaker 4:  So the pine cell is a soldering iron and you can dial in

1047
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,810
Speaker 4:  the, the heat you want and it doesn't, you usually you

1048
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,930
Speaker 4:  have to like plug a soldering iron in and it's got a big golf cable and all

1049
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,970
Speaker 4:  this stuff and it can be kind of annoying and and awkward and it takes a

1050
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,850
Speaker 4:  while to heat up and you will burn the crap out of yourself repeatedly. And

1051
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,850
Speaker 4:  Chris guarantees you will burn yourself less with this. Chris

1052
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,410
Speaker 4:  doesn't know how bad I am at soldering.

1053
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:55,050
Speaker 5:  So yeah, this, this is powered by u s bbc, which is kind of like very

1054
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,170
Speaker 5:  convenient. You can run it off a Wall war or you can run it off a u s BBC

1055
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:01,210
Speaker 5:  battery according to Chris in the article. But the, the key thing here is

1056
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,970
Speaker 5:  this is like $25 and it heats up super quickly and then

1057
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:08,050
Speaker 5:  cools down really quickly. So maybe you'll burn yourself less with this one

1058
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:11,570
Speaker 5:  because it cools down so quickly and it's just not as like Yankee and bulky

1059
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:15,450
Speaker 5:  as like the old school soldering irons that have not really changed in 50

1060
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:15,570
Speaker 5:  years.

1061
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,690
Speaker 6:  That's $25 in this translucent I'm in, I'll, I'll, I'll pick

1062
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,840
Speaker 4:  People and, and was Wild was like everybody in

1063
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,160
Speaker 4:  chat at here at the Verge when when he dropped this thing he was like, does

1064
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,200
Speaker 4:  anybody know what the pine cell is? Like? Two people knew and we're like,

1065
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,440
Speaker 4:  yes, I love it. And everybody else was like, no, I need it. Like just

1066
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,240
Speaker 4:  reflexively. It was like, it was like the Sharper Image, sharper Image

1067
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,960
Speaker 4:  catalog. You just opened it and everybody's like, I want it right now. Like

1068
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,840
Speaker 4:  so and then all, a lot of readers, our readers seem to really, really like

1069
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,560
Speaker 4:  it too. Apparently it's better for the tips don't melt it.

1070
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,480
Speaker 4:  Like don't get all messy and gross as often. So very exciting

1071
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,880
Speaker 4:  if you're in need of a soldering iron.

1072
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,520
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's easy to replace the tips and stuff like that.

1073
00:56:56,550 --> 00:57:00,480
Speaker 4:  This pine cell has a terrible name and it's also open source. I don't

1074
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,320
Speaker 4:  know what an like, he's explained it to me multiple times. What an open

1075
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,280
Speaker 4:  source soldering iron is and I still don't understand and I'm okay with

1076
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,040
Speaker 4:  that. I'm like Richard right now. No, actually

1077
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,880
Speaker 5:  If you get the pine si you can go build your ploy.

1078
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,320
Speaker 4:  I've got, I got to, don't need to bring up the fact that my ploys

1079
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,520
Speaker 4:  been sitting in a Ziploc bag for six months. I was sanding. Well,

1080
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,640
Speaker 5:  I you just need a pine sill and then you can build your plo.

1081
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,280
Speaker 4:  I know. I just need the pine si to finish. Yeah, it's gonna be great. Okay.

1082
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,320
Speaker 4:  Dan, what's your gadget of the week? Is it this week or are you gonna be

1083
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,120
Speaker 4:  cheating and say something from ces?

1084
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,520
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna cheat and say something from ces. I knew it but

1085
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,240
Speaker 5:  the, the reason I'm saying this is because this was actually our

1086
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:44,040
Speaker 5:  like best like smart home gadget that we saw at ces

1087
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,560
Speaker 5:  and that article didn't come out until after last week's v

1088
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,440
Speaker 5:  episode. So this is the aca,

1089
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,840
Speaker 5:  present sensor is like my gadget of the week. I'm super excited for this

1090
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,800
Speaker 5:  thing and I know Jen is really excited about it. Basically this is

1091
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:02,680
Speaker 5:  a device that can detect, it uses millimeter wave technology, not

1092
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,600
Speaker 5:  like millimeter way 5g, but like it, it emits millimeter waves

1093
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,360
Speaker 5:  from it and it can detect a person in a room or a space

1094
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,240
Speaker 5:  really accurately and really down to like minute movement. So

1095
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,840
Speaker 5:  it knows that you're breathing. And what it can do then is you can say like,

1096
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,950
Speaker 5:  if I'm in this room, don't turn off the lights. Which is like a problem with

1097
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,870
Speaker 5:  motion sensors in smart homes is that like when you

1098
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,910
Speaker 5:  have, it's really great for motion sensors to turn on lights when you're

1099
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:32,750
Speaker 5:  come into a room. But then if you don't have your automation set up properly

1100
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,670
Speaker 5:  or they don't detect motion, say you're reading a book or you're watching

1101
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:38,830
Speaker 5:  a movie or whatever it is and you're not moving enough for the current ones

1102
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,910
Speaker 5:  to see you, they will turn the lights off after whatever time you set. So

1103
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:46,350
Speaker 5:  this solves that problem. So now I can like not have my lights turn

1104
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,670
Speaker 5:  off in the middle of the day in my office when I'm sitting there just typing

1105
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:52,910
Speaker 5:  at my computer or you know, eating dinner in the dining room and things like

1106
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:56,310
Speaker 5:  that. So I'm, I'm really excited. This came out in China a year or so ago.

1107
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:59,630
Speaker 5:  They've got a new version that's coming to the US that's a little bit smaller,

1108
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,150
Speaker 5:  a little bit more compact and, and, and I'm pretty excited about it.

1109
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,590
Speaker 4:  Is it gonna support matter?

1110
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:09,350
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so the way that ACA supports matter is through its hub.

1111
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:12,950
Speaker 5:  So hubs, the hub is going to be updated and,

1112
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,950
Speaker 5:  and then yeah the the hub, I believe the M two

1113
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:19,470
Speaker 5:  hub is going to be the first one that's going to get their software update

1114
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:22,560
Speaker 5:  to support matter. And then all the devices that connect to that hub, which

1115
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,880
Speaker 5:  use ZigBee will be available to other matter

1116
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:29,600
Speaker 5:  devices. I would say that like with a Cara matters

1117
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,680
Speaker 5:  not that big of a deal because a car itself already

1118
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,200
Speaker 5:  supports all of the major smart home platforms you can integrate into Home

1119
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,000
Speaker 5:  kit. It supports Google Assistant, it supports Amazon's, it supports smart

1120
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,800
Speaker 5:  things outta the box. So maybe Matter will open that up to even other or

1121
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,920
Speaker 5:  future smart home platforms that we don't know about yet. But for now at

1122
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,200
Speaker 5:  least matter's not going to change much for your car experience,

1123
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,080
Speaker 5:  but they're getting it so good. Cool.

1124
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,400
Speaker 4:  Are, would you be able to like use it? Cause you said it can detect breathing.

1125
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,640
Speaker 4:  Would you be able to use it like point it at somebody and be like, are they

1126
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,440
Speaker 4:  dead flash the lights in the house if they stop breathing

1127
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:05,840
Speaker 5:  In theory

1128
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,000
Speaker 4:  Like new sleep appia detector,

1129
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:11,880
Speaker 5:  Like I I, I've seen some testing. There's been

1130
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:16,080
Speaker 5:  some folks on YouTube who have purchased the Chinese version and like just

1131
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,760
Speaker 5:  imported it where they were and have tested it. And like the level that

1132
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,000
Speaker 5:  the, you can set it to like detect motion is so

1133
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:27,160
Speaker 5:  finite. Like, and you can set zones of like, okay

1134
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,000
Speaker 5:  beyond 10 feet, don't ignore anything. And that like, it's like

1135
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,600
Speaker 5:  there's almost like a virtual wall right at 10 feet where it just stops detecting.

1136
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:35,000
Speaker 5:  Oh

1137
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,320
Speaker 4:  That's

1138
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,080
Speaker 5:  Cool. Anything beyond that. And as soon as you break that barrier it,

1139
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,280
Speaker 5:  it can detect you or sees motion, which is just wild. It's really cool.

1140
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:46,240
Speaker 4:  That's very, very cool. Okay, nevermind. That sounds fun. That's,

1141
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,400
Speaker 4:  that's not cheating. I'm gonna cheat though again and I'm gonna add one more

1142
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:53,520
Speaker 4:  because there's an air conditioner Jen saw at

1143
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,480
Speaker 4:  c e s that she did not mention in our excellent c e s

1144
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,920
Speaker 4:  episode that went up this week. And it's an air conditioner with an L e D

1145
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,990
Speaker 4:  screen on it. It's a mini split AC

1146
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:08,590
Speaker 4:  unit with a digital photo frame, 27

1147
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:12,790
Speaker 4:  inches made for by lg. It uses the think

1148
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:16,470
Speaker 4:  queue app. It appears to just be one of the 27 inch ultra wide

1149
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,150
Speaker 4:  monitors slapped on the front.

1150
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,270
Speaker 5:  That's what it looks like.

1151
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,950
Speaker 4:  This air conditioner with like a big like

1152
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,870
Speaker 4:  garish frame. I've never been more delighted by something

1153
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,750
Speaker 5:  I, I like what they're trying to do here. Yeah, like because those mini-split

1154
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:34,830
Speaker 5:  acs are not attractive and when you have them in your home to be

1155
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:38,750
Speaker 5:  effective, they basically have to be in almost every room, right? So you've

1156
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,470
Speaker 5:  got a bunch of them and you've gotta cut hole in the wall and install them

1157
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:44,270
Speaker 5:  and stuff like that. And they're not pretty to look at. So this is like an

1158
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:47,910
Speaker 5:  attempt to kind of mask it with technology and design

1159
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,830
Speaker 5:  and like they get a little way there. It's, it looks better than

1160
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:55,430
Speaker 5:  a non mini-split I think. And maybe it's supposed to be like maybe someone

1161
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:58,590
Speaker 5:  isn't gonna notice that there's an air conditioner up there behind it. I

1162
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,470
Speaker 4:  Don't know. Just be like, why do you have this 27 inch digital

1163
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:05,350
Speaker 4:  picture frame with some water in it on

1164
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,870
Speaker 5:  Your wall? Hot mounted high up on the wall. Like yeah, why is it like all

1165
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:09,910
Speaker 5:  the way up there towards

1166
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:13,190
Speaker 4:  The ceiling? The ceiling? Why is it pointed towards your fan?

1167
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:17,030
Speaker 4:  What's happening here? It's so good.

1168
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,440
Speaker 5:  Mini split are very good for efficiency though. So like they do have lots

1169
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,280
Speaker 5:  of benefits. Mini design is not

1170
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,880
Speaker 4:  One of them. I just love like so many ways they could have gone about, they

1171
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,800
Speaker 4:  could put some wood paneling on there. They could have put like some, I don't

1172
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,560
Speaker 4:  know, some leaves or something about it and said they were like, cuz

1173
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,520
Speaker 4:  everybody has just leaves randomly hanging in their home. Instead they're

1174
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,400
Speaker 4:  like, we're gonna put a picture frame on it. A 27 inch monitor. Just

1175
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,160
Speaker 4:  slap it on there.

1176
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah, well now they can sell you an art subscription.

1177
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:44,640
Speaker 4:  Oh there we go

1178
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,840
Speaker 5:  To display on the screen. So that's, it's got recurring revenue.

1179
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,320
Speaker 4:  There you go. You

1180
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,160
Speaker 5:  Gotta think about the business here. Alex, I

1181
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,800
Speaker 4:  I have. I'm so sorry, I forgot. Yeah, there's no pricing on it. There's no

1182
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,160
Speaker 4:  release state. So if you were looking for a new mini split

1183
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,920
Speaker 4:  and this sounds incredible to you, I'm sorry,

1184
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,520
Speaker 4:  you're probably gonna have to wait a little while. This might not ever appear

1185
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,680
Speaker 4:  but you can just do this with your current minis split. Just, just go buy

1186
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,040
Speaker 4:  a 27 inch monitor and duct tape it up there, right?

1187
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You know bolt aase amount to it. And
