00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,120
Speaker 2:  Welcome To, The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of AI generated

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,960
Speaker 2:  wallpapers. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am currently wandering

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,560
Speaker 2:  around my house redoing I guess what you would call my

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,200
Speaker 2:  charging strategy. If you hear that and you think, David, who has a charging

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,440
Speaker 2:  strategy, that's ridiculous. A, I agree with you and B, you're

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,840
Speaker 2:  totally wrong. So the way I've set it up is that basically instead of just

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,680
Speaker 2:  like having a charger that I use, I have a bunch of

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,680
Speaker 2:  like charging stations around the house. There's one in the kitchen

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,560
Speaker 2:  where a couple of things are plugged in. There's one upstairs, there, have

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,960
Speaker 2:  one in the basement. There's one right next to the couch. And basically the

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,560
Speaker 2:  idea is like where you are most of the time, you should be able to charge

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,440
Speaker 2:  things. This is great now because my wife and I both have

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,160
Speaker 2:  phones that use U S B C. She's on a Pixel. I'm on an iPhone right now and

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,000
Speaker 2:  so I get to just redo some things. The most annoying part of this process

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,800
Speaker 2:  has been Apple Watch chargers because actually I need to charge the Apple

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,000
Speaker 2:  watch probably more than I need to charge my phone. But having a bunch of

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,880
Speaker 2:  those like pucks sitting around is sort of stupid. So I'm reworking the

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,680
Speaker 2:  whole system. I bought a bunch of those big anchor wall warts that

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,920
Speaker 2:  have a couple of plugs in them that look really nice. It works great. Cannot

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,720
Speaker 2:  recommend enough spending way too much time overthinking where all of your

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,640
Speaker 2:  charging cables are in your house. Anyway, we have an awesome show coming

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,160
Speaker 2:  up for you today. We're gonna talk all about Google gadgets. We're gonna

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,280
Speaker 2:  talk about the Pixel eight and Pixel eight pro reviews that are coming out.

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,720
Speaker 2:  We're gonna talk about the Pixel Watch two, which I think is sneakily kind

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,640
Speaker 2:  of fascinating and maybe very good. And then we're gonna talk about this

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,480
Speaker 2:  new Chromebook Plus designation that Google just put out where

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,240
Speaker 2:  it thinks it can help make better Chromebooks and convince you to buy better,

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,360
Speaker 2:  slightly more expensive. Chromebooks, all of that is coming up in just a

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
Speaker 2:  second, but I have this one 10 foot long U S

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,960
Speaker 2:  B C cable somewhere. It's braided, it's awesome, it was really

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
Speaker 2:  unnecessarily expensive, but it makes it so that you can sit anywhere on

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
Speaker 2:  the couch and charge your phone. It's the dream except I don't know where

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,680
Speaker 2:  it's anymore, so I'm gonna go find it. Wish me luck. This is The Vergecast.

35
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,400
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,850
Speaker 3:  I went to the precinct and I said, look, I

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,730
Speaker 3:  wanted to talk about a murder that I think happened happened

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,730
Speaker 4:  In 1993. Travell Coleman shot a man but was never

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,370
Speaker 4:  a suspect. He kept the secret for years and years.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,090
Speaker 5:  I've heard of people turning themselves in, but it's usually soon

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,810
Speaker 5:  thereafter the crime. I've never experienced anything like someone coming

42
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,770
Speaker 5:  forward 17 years after the fact. So no, this is absolutely extraordinary

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,570
Speaker 4:  Here. TLS story on the latest episode of Criminal Listen

44
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,490
Speaker 4:  wherever you get your podcasts.

45
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,650
Speaker 6:  Hey, this is Neela Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of Decoder.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,090
Speaker 6:  This week in the Decoder Feed we're dropping interviews from Vox Media's

47
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,530
Speaker 6:  code conference, an exclusive event for some of the most influential names

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,450
Speaker 6:  in tech. I talked to a lot of folks like A M D C E O, Lisa Sue. We're

49
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:57,770
Speaker 4:  Betting on

50
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,560
Speaker 7:  What the, the next big thing in AI is.

51
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,280
Speaker 6:  Getty Images, c e o, Craig Peters, I think there are others that are just

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,400
Speaker 6:  kind of off doing what they want to do and damn the consequences. And

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Speaker 6:  Kevin Scott, Microsoft c t o and executive vice president

54
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,040
Speaker 6:  of ai. Like honestly like that would've been a little bit better if there

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,280
Speaker 6:  had been more ai. We had a blast over the next few days. We'll bring you

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,840
Speaker 6:  those interviews and more recorded live on the stage at the code conference.

57
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,920
Speaker 2:  Welcome back, great news. I found the cable, all my stuff is gonna

58
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,800
Speaker 2:  be so charged. I really by the way, cannot recommend enough having

59
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,000
Speaker 2:  one wildly long charging cable. It's the kind of

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,840
Speaker 2:  thing that just like makes a bunch of things in life easier when

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,320
Speaker 2:  you're traveling or sitting on the couch or whatever. We love a 10 foot charger

62
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,480
Speaker 2:  in this house. Alright, let's get into today's show. The first thing I wanna

63
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,760
Speaker 2:  talk about is the Pixel eight and Pixel eight Pro. Google's latest phones,

64
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,160
Speaker 2:  they came out last week. Reviews are hitting now. Lot going on as far as

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,720
Speaker 2:  we can tell. These phones are really about two things, the cameras

66
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,080
Speaker 2:  and the ai. We've been hearing about these phones for months and I've been

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,000
Speaker 2:  wondering over the last week if that's the reason I was left a little,

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,920
Speaker 2:  not disappointed but I guess underwhelmed by the stuff Google

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,640
Speaker 2:  announced. If not underwhelmed then like Whelmed You know.

70
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,920
Speaker 2:  But as they say, the proof is in the pudding. Allison Johnson has been using

71
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,680
Speaker 2:  and reviewing the two phones to see if all that camera and AI

72
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,320
Speaker 2:  stuff adds up to a winner in the Android world. So

73
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,280
Speaker 2:  let's find out. Allison's here. Hi Allison. Hello. We have the Pixel eight

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,200
Speaker 2:  in the Pixel eight Pro and one of the things I feel like you have to

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,960
Speaker 2:  do in this process is like figure out how to explain kind of which

76
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,560
Speaker 2:  is which and which is for what. Where have you landed? How do you sort of

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,000
Speaker 2:  explain the difference between the Pixel eight and the Pixel eight Pro?

78
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,240
Speaker 10:  I think the thing I landed on like literally five minutes ago is that

79
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,400
Speaker 10:  it feels like with the main Pixel eight, Google is trying to position

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,320
Speaker 10:  it as like the mainstream phone. Like the one I would

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,400
Speaker 10:  recommend to my mom or dad when they're Pixel seven A

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,240
Speaker 10:  or six A, like gives out in X number of years, whatever. And

83
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,160
Speaker 10:  then if you're eight Pixel nerd, which I

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,680
Speaker 10:  love the Pixel nerds, but the You know they're nerds. That's the eight pro

85
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,680
Speaker 10:  and that's where you get like all the extra things and it's, it's a

86
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,160
Speaker 10:  more of a distance between the two of them than there's been in previous

87
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,080
Speaker 10:  years, which I think was a little like not everybody felt great

88
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,040
Speaker 10:  about that. Sort of felt like Pixel eight was missing out on a

89
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,000
Speaker 10:  bunch of stuff that the eight pros suddenly getting. I was like why? And

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,840
Speaker 10:  they both got more expensive this year, so that's sort of made it harder

91
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,800
Speaker 10:  to swallow. But that's where I've landed I think. I think it's making sense

92
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,360
Speaker 10:  as like Pixel eight is just kind of might be the phone for everybody.

93
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,200
Speaker 2:  Okay. And that's, I mean that's, that's a little bit like what Samsung has

94
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,720
Speaker 2:  been doing with the SSS and the Ultras. Like it's kind of landed in that

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,040
Speaker 2:  same place I would say. And I think that works. Like the alternative would

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Speaker 2:  be like the iPhone where there are four models and I feel like I have no

97
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,720
Speaker 2:  idea how to explain to people which iPhone to buy. So the idea of like there's

98
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,520
Speaker 2:  one that is one price and then for like a few hundred dollars

99
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,880
Speaker 2:  more and a whole bunch of extra stuff. You get this other one?

100
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,240
Speaker 10:  Yeah, the Normie phone. Yeah,

101
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,040
Speaker 2:  It works.

102
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,480
Speaker 10:  I think so. Okay.

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,400
Speaker 2:  So we gotta, we should just talk about the camera first. Yeah 'cause that's

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,040
Speaker 2:  the thing, right? I feel like the two stories of this phone are camera and

105
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,880
Speaker 2:  AI and there's kind of an overlapping Venn diagram there. I have a bunch

106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,840
Speaker 2:  of specific questions but give me just some overall impressions of the

107
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,880
Speaker 2:  Pixel eight and pro cameras.

108
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,240
Speaker 10:  So it's so weird you have to kind of think of it as like a three

109
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Speaker 10:  part thing because there's the hardware, which there have been

110
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,480
Speaker 10:  some upgrades on both models to the hardware. There's like a new

111
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,200
Speaker 10:  main camera sensor, new lens, like some little

112
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,880
Speaker 10:  upgrades here and there. Nothing earth shattering but there's that.

113
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,280
Speaker 10:  There's all the software stuff that the camera app itself does. And then

114
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,200
Speaker 10:  there's the things in Google Photos, which is the whole Pandora's

115
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,440
Speaker 10:  box of what is a photo.

116
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,840
Speaker 2:  We'll do that last because I do, I do wanna talk about that and I'm very

117
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,920
Speaker 2:  curious like how all of that actually works in practice. But I agree that

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,880
Speaker 2:  that is kind of a separate thing. So let's come back to that. But like just

119
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,880
Speaker 2:  the actual photos coming outta the camera. What have you seen so far? It's

120
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,800
Speaker 10:  Very Pixel to me. I think it's kind of settled into this, like

121
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,960
Speaker 10:  you sometime get like a cooler tone in your photos.

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,600
Speaker 10:  I feel like that was more pronounced in like previous years on the Pixel

123
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,120
Speaker 10:  and I still see some of that creeping in on some of my shots. But overall

124
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,120
Speaker 10:  I'm just like happy with them. Skin tones can kind of

125
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,360
Speaker 10:  look like a little waxy sometimes, but I like,

126
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,600
Speaker 10:  there's sort of like outliers but I think I'm just, we're overall happy

127
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Speaker 10:  with it and if when it fails it kind of does so in a

128
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,320
Speaker 10:  predictable way. It's not kind of just like throwing a

129
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,280
Speaker 10:  purple shade into a sunset like other phone will do.

130
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,120
Speaker 10:  So yeah, I think it's kind of reliable. It's, it's occasionally like

131
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,560
Speaker 10:  very good and most of the time it's like just pretty good at

132
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:56,920
Speaker 10:  everything.

133
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,280
Speaker 2:  Okay. If I'm remembering this right, the big spec difference between the

134
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,640
Speaker 2:  eight and the eight pro is the telephoto camera, right?

135
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Have you, have you noticed the difference like when you're using the

136
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Speaker 2:  eight, do you find yourself being like, oh I wish I had the pro for this

137
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,920
Speaker 2:  so I could use the the Zoom

138
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,480
Speaker 10:  A little bit? Yeah and that's the thing with the, with like an iPhone

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,120
Speaker 10:  15 and then the 15 Pro Max You know like a five time

140
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,040
Speaker 10:  telephoto zoom, which is what is on the eight pro in the iPhone

141
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,400
Speaker 10:  15 Pro Max is like, it feels like a real

142
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,040
Speaker 10:  zoom lens. You can actually get like quite a bit closer to something. You

143
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,240
Speaker 10:  can do a real kind of like compression shot.

144
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,840
Speaker 10:  My husband was running in a race like of for funsies five K this

145
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,640
Speaker 10:  weekend. You can get that like cool shot of like the starting line

146
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,320
Speaker 10:  and a bunch of people in the foreground. You just can't do that

147
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,280
Speaker 10:  with a three times lens or no telephoto lens, just

148
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,920
Speaker 10:  just what you get on the Pixel eight. You do get that like

149
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,840
Speaker 10:  two times lossless crop zoom on both of them and that was

150
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,400
Speaker 10:  introduced last year. It's good. Most of the time I have

151
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,560
Speaker 10:  like notes on it. That is one thing that is like I think a

152
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,360
Speaker 10:  lot of people would appreciate having that and you just kind of have to

153
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,200
Speaker 10:  make a call whether you're gonna shell out quite a bit more

154
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,800
Speaker 10:  money carry around a bigger phone or just sort of settle for

155
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,000
Speaker 10:  for what you get.

156
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, it seems sort of silly to say that the difference between

157
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,040
Speaker 2:  like two and three X and five x is so big but

158
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
Speaker 2:  it really is like it goes from, I'm taking the photo slightly closer to

159
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,320
Speaker 2:  I'm actually taking a different looking photo. Yeah. Which

160
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,960
Speaker 2:  is a bigger deal than I think I've given it credit for. Like I in the, the

161
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,920
Speaker 2:  iPhone cycle this year got a 15 pro instead of a 15 pro max and just

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,760
Speaker 2:  noodling around with other people's. I kind of regret it. I don't Yeah. Want

163
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Speaker 2:  the bigger screen normally and this is why like I just wish for more feature

164
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,400
Speaker 2:  parody in general because I want the smaller screen but all the camera stuff

165
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,080
Speaker 2:  and you just kind of can't have that in life right now.

166
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,560
Speaker 10:  Why can't we have it All?

167
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,320
Speaker 2:  Right. I just want all the things. Yeah. But in general you, you think

168
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,320
Speaker 2:  that we've settled into kind of knowing what a Pixel is like? I feel like

169
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,880
Speaker 2:  at this point if you show me a photo I can tell you

170
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,560
Speaker 2:  10 times outta 10 whether it's a Samsung photo or an Apple photo. Yeah. And

171
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,240
Speaker 2:  I feel like Pixel has been kind of increasingly that way too.

172
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,080
Speaker 2:  Do you think it's as distinct a, a vibe as

173
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,040
Speaker 2:  Samsung and Apple are at this point? I think so.

174
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,120
Speaker 10:  I think it's like it's inoffensive. That's kind of how I would describe

175
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,040
Speaker 10:  it. Samsung has a look, iPhone kind of has a look

176
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,800
Speaker 10:  and Pixels sort of somewhere in the middle and occasionally like kind of

177
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,960
Speaker 10:  goes off in one direction or another. And I, I'm annoyed

178
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,200
Speaker 10:  with portrait mode. I really want that to be better. Like, oh no the next

179
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,400
Speaker 10:  time it's like it's fine, it's inoffensive.

180
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,640
Speaker 2:  Wait but no, tell me more. 'cause I, so the single

181
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,640
Speaker 2:  biggest technology change for me that happened with having a

182
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,520
Speaker 2:  kid this year is that all I care about is portrait mode. Like

183
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,720
Speaker 2:  yeah I just, all I do, I just run around shooting in portrait mode. Yeah.

184
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,440
Speaker 2:  So is it not, it's not great. It's okay.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,880
Speaker 10:  I mean you have a wide portrait shot and then you can do

186
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,840
Speaker 10:  the two x on either of the phones and

187
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,120
Speaker 10:  the two times portrait mode just doesn't look very good. I'm not

188
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,520
Speaker 10:  really sure what it's doing. It looks kind of crunchy and

189
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,640
Speaker 10:  that's like, I like that little bit of extra reach when

190
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,520
Speaker 10:  you're taking the portrait photo. Yeah. So the wide shots still

191
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,440
Speaker 10:  kind of have that like hardboard cutout look where your

192
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,280
Speaker 10:  subject is like super in focus and everything else is super not You know

193
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,440
Speaker 2:  It's just full, there's no like gradation at all. Yeah. It's just like it's

194
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,640
Speaker 2:  blur more than it is like Boca in general. Yeah. Yeah. I get that.

195
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,040
Speaker 10:  It'll do that Sometimes I've taken some really lovely portrait photos with

196
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,840
Speaker 10:  it and they tend to not be the, the two times lens. Okay.

197
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,080
Speaker 10:  But yeah, it's not, not my absolute favorite. I think it could be better

198
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,160
Speaker 10:  but it's, it's not terrible. Okay,

199
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,880
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. What about the pro controls on the, on the pro where you actually

200
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,720
Speaker 2:  get some of that manual controls in the camera app? Have you enjoyed

201
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,680
Speaker 2:  having that? Yeah,

202
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,880
Speaker 10:  I, I'm not one like, like when you're chasing a toddler around,

203
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,840
Speaker 10:  I'm not one to get in there and be like, let me dial up the i s o

204
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,880
Speaker 10:  or You know. I tend to like just trust the phone camera to do

205
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,760
Speaker 10:  its thing. But going in there you actually get, you can turn on like

206
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,080
Speaker 10:  picture and a picture like focusing and

207
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,160
Speaker 10:  you can turn which has focus peeking attached to it. Oh

208
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,920
Speaker 2:  Nice. Okay. It

209
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,800
Speaker 10:  Actually makes the macro mode like worth anything.

210
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,720
Speaker 10:  'cause you can actually see if your picture's in focus. Right. Which is

211
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,640
Speaker 10:  cool what

212
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:38,960
Speaker 2:  A world.

213
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,680
Speaker 10:  Yeah. You can see like what part of your subject is actually in focus.

214
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,080
Speaker 10:  So that was kind of a revelation. I was like, oh I would actually use the

215
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,080
Speaker 10:  macro mode now. But it's nice. The, the controls are nice, it's cool

216
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,920
Speaker 10:  having it there. It's not, it's not in your way if you don't want it

217
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,120
Speaker 10:  like it, it's not gonna hurt you. Yeah. I appreciate it.

218
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. I'm, I'm glad to hear that All. right. So let's talk about the

219
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,600
Speaker 2:  AI stuff. The two things in Google Photos and you should tell me if there

220
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,640
Speaker 2:  are more that I should be interested in. But the two that I have found myself

221
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,560
Speaker 2:  obsessively wondering how you have found them are

222
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,360
Speaker 2:  best take, which is the one that takes a bunch of photos and then lets you

223
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,960
Speaker 2:  sort of pick and choose the parts of each photo that you liked best and combine

224
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,400
Speaker 2:  'em all into one photo and then the magic editor, which lets you like

225
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,640
Speaker 2:  move stuff around to frame the shot better. Let's just

226
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,840
Speaker 2:  start with Best Take because we spent like, dear God like two hours on The

227
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,480
Speaker 2:  Vergecast last week talking about this. How has it been so far? What do you

228
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,360
Speaker 2:  make of it? Is it, is it like as cool a feature enough to like change the

229
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,920
Speaker 2:  world and make us all terrified about the truth of photography forever? It's

230
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,600
Speaker 10:  Somewhere in there like okay, it's, I don't,

231
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,200
Speaker 10:  I don't know how afraid we should be of it. It's like

232
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,240
Speaker 10:  occasionally really good at what it's supposed to do,

233
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,840
Speaker 10:  especially when there's really good lighting. Like the demo we did

234
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,040
Speaker 10:  at the Google event, it's like a horror movie almost where you switch

235
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,680
Speaker 10:  the face on someone and like nothing else moves except their

236
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,640
Speaker 10:  expression and sometimes it looks really seamless and you're

237
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Speaker 10:  like, oh my God this is terrifying. What does this mean for humanity? Sometimes

238
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,440
Speaker 10:  it looks pretty bad and like my toddler like suddenly

239
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,360
Speaker 10:  has another arm.

240
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,640
Speaker 10:  Here's like gesturing. I'm like okay, well this is not gonna end

241
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,480
Speaker 10:  society as we know it. And so it is, it's like somewhere in the middle

242
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,560
Speaker 10:  like I took some group shots with it and there's, you can sort of feel

243
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,440
Speaker 10:  like alright this is just, this is just a tool. Someone had their eyes shut,

244
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,480
Speaker 10:  I can change it so their eyes are open, this is fine, this is great, I enjoy

245
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,560
Speaker 10:  having it. But then you can kind of get in there and like

246
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,560
Speaker 10:  there's just totally changed the expression on someone's face

247
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,960
Speaker 10:  and it sort of feels like I don't think I like it. Even if it's not,

248
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,960
Speaker 10:  I'm not like, like doing an evil deeded with it.

249
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,960
Speaker 10:  I'm just like changing the expression on my toddler's face.

250
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,840
Speaker 10:  Right. I still feel sort of weird about it. I'm like, well I know he

251
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,240
Speaker 10:  wasn't making that face when he was doing that exact thing. And

252
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,000
Speaker 10:  I think we're all gonna have to kind of find where we're comfortable with

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,440
Speaker 10:  it. And for me personally, I'm like, like also with

254
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,520
Speaker 10:  Magic Editor you can do some wacky stuff with it and like

255
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,800
Speaker 10:  there was a picture of my son and one of his friends You know

256
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,680
Speaker 10:  at a baseball game and they're like hanging on the fence and I can just

257
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,480
Speaker 10:  like cut him out and move him over. So he's next to his friend

258
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,080
Speaker 10:  and it looks like that's exactly how I took the photo

259
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,840
Speaker 10:  and nothing evil has happened there but I feel

260
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,120
Speaker 10:  strange about it and I don't, I don't really like it.

261
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,000
Speaker 2:  Do you go and look at that photo then the next day or whatever and

262
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,400
Speaker 2:  feel differently about it? Like this is one of the things I keep thinking

263
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,160
Speaker 2:  about with this is like if I do that to a photo will I always

264
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,880
Speaker 2:  remember that I did that to that photo or that You know the fifth time I

265
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,440
Speaker 2:  look at it I will have forgotten and it's just a, it's just a cool photo

266
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,520
Speaker 2:  but does the fact that I've done something to it change my relationship

267
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,200
Speaker 2:  to that photo? And I feel like with Best Take in particular, I think I

268
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,120
Speaker 2:  would You know what I mean? Right. But I it does sound like you're having

269
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,760
Speaker 2:  that experience a little bit with all of this stuff.

270
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,920
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I think it's just a question of like how far you wanna

271
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Speaker 10:  take it and like where your comfort level is. Like I have no

272
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,480
Speaker 10:  problem like taking some minor thing out of the

273
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,160
Speaker 10:  background of a photo that's like You know take a picture and there's something

274
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,920
Speaker 10:  like on the counter behind my kid. Sure. And I'm like, that's garbage.

275
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,000
Speaker 10:  Let's pretend it was never there. Or yeah, with Best take

276
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,840
Speaker 10:  when someone's eyes are closed you open their eyes like this is fine,

277
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,000
Speaker 10:  but where's the line for you and where you're going to look at

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,920
Speaker 10:  that photo and feel icky about it after you make the

279
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,800
Speaker 10:  edit is like, maybe it's a little different for everybody. I'm

280
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,480
Speaker 10:  learning for myself.

281
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,520
Speaker 2:  Totally fair. Yeah. Have you seen any sort of

282
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,720
Speaker 2:  guardrails that Google is putting on that experience? Like is there a limit

283
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,680
Speaker 2:  to what it'll let you do kind of in the name of improving your photo or is

284
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,000
Speaker 2:  it pretty much the sky is the limit inside of the tool?

285
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,120
Speaker 10:  It'll put the brakes on if you try and do too

286
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,080
Speaker 10:  much. The UI is pretty limiting. Like to start

287
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,560
Speaker 10:  with, you basically have the options of like you are

288
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,360
Speaker 10:  selecting things in the scene to either like erase

289
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,960
Speaker 10:  or you have a little magic wand you can tap and

290
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,120
Speaker 10:  it'll suggest like change the sky or change the lighting

291
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,280
Speaker 10:  I think. And so you, you can't, it's not like a generative

292
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,760
Speaker 10:  like anything you want, do you want unicorns, rainbows like

293
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,000
Speaker 10:  throw 'em all in there kind of experience. So that's a good

294
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,720
Speaker 10:  thing I think. And it sort of, it limits how you

295
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,000
Speaker 10:  approach a photo of like okay, I know I can only do

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,560
Speaker 10:  so much here. It's, it's not a free for all.

297
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,240
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So when you're, when you're done testing all this stuff, are

298
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,040
Speaker 2:  these still features you think you'll use like in, in your day-to-day life

299
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,360
Speaker 2:  as like a regular person, if you remember life as a regular person

300
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,920
Speaker 2:  before you had 700 phones barely in your room at all times. Yeah. Is this

301
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,840
Speaker 2:  the kind of thing that like every time you You know take a bunch of family

302
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,920
Speaker 2:  photos? Like I had this experience over the weekend and I was thinking about

303
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,640
Speaker 2:  this all the time. We went to a pumpkin patch as you do in October and

304
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,760
Speaker 2:  it was five adults and three kids under two years

305
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,960
Speaker 2:  old. So the idea of getting all of us in a photo where we're all going to

306
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,440
Speaker 2:  be looking at the camera smiling at once, impossible, just literally never

307
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,320
Speaker 2:  gonna happen. And so what I have on my phone is 200 pictures.

308
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,000
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I just stood there for five minutes and just took pictures constantly

309
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,000
Speaker 2:  and literally zero out of 200 everyone is making the face you'd want them

310
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,360
Speaker 2:  to make. And I had this moment of thinking like, oh this is what this is

311
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,920
Speaker 2:  for. Between these 200 photos there is one perfect

312
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,520
Speaker 2:  photo and if I could make it, I could share it with my whole family and everybody

313
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
Speaker 2:  would go ah and then move on with their lives and everything would be great.

314
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,840
Speaker 2:  But I also like, I don't know if I'm going to have an

315
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,640
Speaker 2:  existential crisis every time I open up my camera from now do You know what

316
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,520
Speaker 2:  I mean? Yeah. Like what do you think when you stop sort of thinking about

317
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,240
Speaker 2:  this in like a reviewer, what does this mean for the world mindset and just

318
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,680
Speaker 2:  start taking pictures of your family and life. Do you think this is the kind

319
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Speaker 2:  of thing that'll end up sort of in your day-to-day workflow? Yeah,

320
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,680
Speaker 10:  I think it would like in those exact situations where I

321
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,760
Speaker 10:  am always finding that situation where I look back at the

322
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
Speaker 10:  photos I took of some particular like moment and

323
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,680
Speaker 10:  You know if it's a toddler and an adult, like

324
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,320
Speaker 10:  it's hard to, even with two people get like You

325
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,240
Speaker 10:  know the right moment. Yeah. And the right the expression I'm like oh well

326
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,200
Speaker 10:  this photo has this and yeah it's, it is the kind of thing you find yourself

327
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,120
Speaker 10:  wishing for and in testing you just kinda

328
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,120
Speaker 10:  wanna do the most ridiculous things and break it. So

329
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,200
Speaker 10:  we've did like normal faces and then silly faces and then

330
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,160
Speaker 10:  you're swapping in someone's like ridiculous face when everyone else is

331
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,800
Speaker 10:  making a normal face and you're like, that's kind of weird and

332
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,400
Speaker 10:  creepy. But I think in just a day to day like

333
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,960
Speaker 10:  I am so used to taking those 200 photos

334
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,680
Speaker 10:  and now yeah I think I would just have something to

335
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,360
Speaker 10:  do with them now rather than just kind of settle on like well

336
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,360
Speaker 10:  I'm gonna look weird in this one and everyone else looks fine.

337
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The other AI feature I'm very curious about and is one I'm

338
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,880
Speaker 2:  personally invested in is the Audio Magic Eraser

339
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,240
Speaker 2:  which is supposed to cut out, what is it, background noise and just kind

340
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Speaker 2:  of all unwanted audio from the video you're taking. Is that essentially the

341
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,440
Speaker 2:  idea?

342
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,600
Speaker 10:  Yeah, you just record your video like usual and

343
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,520
Speaker 10:  then you go into the editing tools and Google photos and there's a little

344
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,440
Speaker 10:  audio tab and it separates into some different

345
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,120
Speaker 10:  like very basic channels that are labeled like speech

346
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,120
Speaker 10:  and noise and Wind.

347
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,640
Speaker 2:  Super exciting if it works, does it work?

348
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,720
Speaker 10:  It works, yeah. Yeah, that this is another one I'm like I

349
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,680
Speaker 10:  would use this all the time if this is actually on my phone. So I recorded

350
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,640
Speaker 10:  a little test clip just walking down the busy street near where I live.

351
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,600
Speaker 10:  It's like raining a little bit, there's all kinds of unwanted

352
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,080
Speaker 10:  noise going on and you can hear what it does.

353
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,400
Speaker 2:  Let's hear the before with no touching. This is just what the phone

354
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,160
Speaker 2:  itself picks up,

355
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,360
Speaker 11:  Just taking the Pixel eight out for a stroll in the rain. And

356
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,400
Speaker 11:  something I've noticed is that, so Audio Magic Eraser

357
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,440
Speaker 11:  really does best with constant kind of

358
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,240
Speaker 11:  background noise. Something like a crowd or traffic

359
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,920
Speaker 11:  like you're hearing right now sort of comes in and out. It's a little bit

360
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,840
Speaker 11:  harder to control for but still, I don't know, it's

361
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,440
Speaker 11:  pretty impressive.

362
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,960
Speaker 2:  Okay. And here is the after with the Audio Magic

363
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,840
Speaker 2:  Eraser turned on,

364
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,600
Speaker 11:  I'm just taking the Pixel eight out for a stroll in the rain and

365
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,880
Speaker 11:  something I've noticed is that, so Audio Magic Eraser,

366
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,880
Speaker 11:  it really does best with constant kind of

367
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,840
Speaker 11:  background noise. Something like a crowd or traffic like

368
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,480
Speaker 11:  you're hearing right now sort of comes in and out. It's a little bit harder

369
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,520
Speaker 11:  to control for but still, I don't know, it's pretty impressive.

370
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,680
Speaker 2:  Okay, that's really impressive. It definitely like clips and compresses your

371
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,640
Speaker 2:  voice a bit but it just, I mean it gets, it got rid of all of the background

372
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,040
Speaker 2:  noise That's wild. And

373
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,800
Speaker 10:  You have like a degree of control over that was like turning

374
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,640
Speaker 10:  everything all the way down so you could leave a little bit in if you didn't

375
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,920
Speaker 10:  want it to sound, you can definitely hear those moments when it's like kind

376
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,880
Speaker 10:  of juddering and Yeah and trying to figure things out. But yeah, it's

377
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,640
Speaker 10:  super impressive.

378
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah for everyone on the Birch Cast who has had to listen to me like shout

379
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,800
Speaker 2:  into my phone over traffic, this is gonna be a huge win.

380
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,160
Speaker 10:  There you go. Alright,

381
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,640
Speaker 2:  Three more things I'm curious about and then I'm gonna let you go. The first

382
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,000
Speaker 2:  one is the new tensor processor, which

383
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,600
Speaker 2:  the last Pixel performance was kind of

384
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,120
Speaker 2:  at times it got hot, it just wasn't the best, what's the verdict this time?

385
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,640
Speaker 2:  And

386
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,600
Speaker 10:  I gotta say personally I never had too much trouble with the ELAs

387
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,080
Speaker 10:  tensor but I've seen the reports of like You know the overheating and

388
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
Speaker 10:  I did notice on this one I was out standing

389
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,960
Speaker 10:  outside on on like a pretty hot day and there's

390
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,040
Speaker 10:  the screens will get a little bit brighter this year. Like the high brightness

391
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,920
Speaker 10:  mode on the eight pro actually goes up to 2,400 knits

392
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,400
Speaker 10:  was just super bright. I saw that kick in and I was like, this is great,

393
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,440
Speaker 10:  I can read what's on my phone now. And a couple minutes in like

394
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,520
Speaker 10:  phone got pretty hot and it just went back down. Oh

395
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,080
Speaker 2:  Wow. Okay.

396
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,920
Speaker 10:  Yeah, which is the, usually the case on iPhones too.

397
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,680
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Not uncommon but with the device kind of in that state,

398
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,520
Speaker 10:  I flipped into the video recording and it gave me a little warning like,

399
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,520
Speaker 10:  eh, your phone's too hot, it's probably not gonna record at the highest

400
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,560
Speaker 10:  quality. So if that is a concern,

401
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,600
Speaker 10:  I, this is, it was a warm day, but I live in Seattle, I don't live

402
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,840
Speaker 10:  in the tropics. If that's a concern for you then

403
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,240
Speaker 10:  I am sorry to say that it might be a little bit more of the same on

404
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,200
Speaker 10:  Tensor G three.

405
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,680
Speaker 2:  Okay. So the, the problems maybe not totally solved, but in

406
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,320
Speaker 2:  general the Pixel seven other than when it was sort of at its threshold

407
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,600
Speaker 2:  did pretty well. And I'm as I, I would assume the same is true this year.

408
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,400
Speaker 2:  Like I can't imagine you're having sort of day-to-day performance issues

409
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,920
Speaker 2:  on this phone.

410
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,040
Speaker 10:  Yeah, no, it, it handles everything fine. It says a little edge cases

411
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,360
Speaker 10:  where you're really pushing it, like I'm trying to take a whole

412
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,200
Speaker 10:  bunch of portrait mode shots really fast and it, it's

413
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,560
Speaker 10:  just kind of like slow down lady but

414
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,160
Speaker 10:  overall it's fine.

415
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,880
Speaker 2:  Okay. And then temperature sensor, which it has. Okay. Is that useful for

416
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,000
Speaker 2:  anything? This is like, this strikes me so much as a thing that like Google

417
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,040
Speaker 2:  just happened to have a bunch of these lying around a factory somewhere so

418
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,000
Speaker 2:  they put them in. Have you found it valuable at all to have in these funds?

419
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,600
Speaker 10:  No, not, not at all. Like I have a moment

420
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,480
Speaker 10:  where I'm like, oh I'm drinking, this is a hot cup of coffee. I'll get

421
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,920
Speaker 10:  the phone and see what the temperature is and it, it gives you

422
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,920
Speaker 10:  You know degrees or whatever. It's just like, but there's text on it, it

423
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,800
Speaker 10:  just says hot. I'm like yeah All.

424
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,640
Speaker 10:  right. I I knew that actually I didn't need a sensor to tell me

425
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,160
Speaker 10:  that. Yeah,

426
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,320
Speaker 2:  Thanks Google. That's AI at work right there. That's

427
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,880
Speaker 10:  Our AI dollars at work. I don't know.

428
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,160
Speaker 2:  And then last thing is battery life. How do the Pixel eights stand

429
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,840
Speaker 2:  up? You know

430
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,840
Speaker 10:  It seems to be fine. I think like Google

431
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,640
Speaker 10:  very smartly doesn't make any particular claims of like

432
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,120
Speaker 10:  better battery life or better power efficiency

433
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,520
Speaker 10:  and I'm finding that both of the phones will get through a full day

434
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,680
Speaker 10:  with varying degrees of like a comfortable percentage

435
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,120
Speaker 10:  left at the end of the day. Sure. But yeah,

436
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,000
Speaker 2:  Presumably the pro does a bit better just by virtue of being larger. Yeah

437
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,960
Speaker 10:  That one you could, if you're just kind of a moderate user you can

438
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,680
Speaker 10:  push into the next day. But yeah, full day of use

439
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,760
Speaker 10:  is just a kind of a blanket like yeah you'll, you'll get that.

440
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,520
Speaker 10:  Okay,

441
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,160
Speaker 2:  That's good. So overall it seems like there's no kind of

442
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,840
Speaker 2:  one mind blowing earth shattering new thing here, which in a

443
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,640
Speaker 2:  smartphone in 2023 is not entirely unexpected but I do think

444
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,440
Speaker 2:  Google has been on this grind of like we can do a lot of

445
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,720
Speaker 2:  little AI things. There's a bunch of that in here where they're doing the

446
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,040
Speaker 2:  summaries of web pages in the browser with AI and the better spam call filtering

447
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,800
Speaker 2:  and all that kind of stuff. Does that all add up to much for you?

448
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,280
Speaker 2:  Like does, does the full sort of AI story make the Pixels

449
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,800
Speaker 2:  more compelling than what you're getting from Samsung or Apple or any of

450
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,160
Speaker 2:  these other companies at this point?

451
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,840
Speaker 10:  It's starting to and I feel like that's kind of been Google's

452
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,200
Speaker 10:  pitch with the Pixels for the past couple years is like it's gonna,

453
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,880
Speaker 10:  it's so smart, it's gonna do these things for you, it's gonna make your

454
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,680
Speaker 10:  life easier. And You know the Pixel six and Pixel seven, like

455
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,840
Speaker 10:  they're good phones. I don't feel like there was anything it was doing that

456
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,360
Speaker 10:  was just really making my life easier. I think that

457
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,320
Speaker 10:  promise is like could start to come true in the Pixel eight and some of

458
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,720
Speaker 10:  it depends on assistant with Bard which is

459
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,960
Speaker 10:  going to come at some point in the future

460
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,960
Speaker 2:  Potentially.

461
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,400
Speaker 10:  Yes, this is Google so take that as you will.

462
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,480
Speaker 10:  But that could really make Google Assistant very

463
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,240
Speaker 10:  useful to be able to ask it like questions

464
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,800
Speaker 10:  that require checking multiple sources or

465
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,680
Speaker 10:  looking in your email. And I think there's a lot of

466
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,600
Speaker 10:  potential there. There's also you get seven years of OSS

467
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,120
Speaker 10:  updates,

468
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,320
Speaker 2:  Which is a big deal. It, it really is. I remain as

469
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,200
Speaker 2:  we've talked about unconvinced that Google is only even going to make phones

470
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,120
Speaker 2:  still in seven years. So who knows? But I do think that's a real promise

471
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,120
Speaker 2:  and that's a big deal if if that is actually true and seven years from

472
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,520
Speaker 2:  now your phone is still good and functional and up to date. Like that's huge

473
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,280
Speaker 2:  and that's a real reason to buy these phones.

474
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,360
Speaker 10:  Yeah, yeah. So it seems like there's potentially like

475
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,640
Speaker 10:  really useful things coming to it. The assistant voice typing

476
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,080
Speaker 10:  is quite a bit better in the Pixel eight. It

477
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,240
Speaker 10:  actually will like understand your sort of inflection and pauses and

478
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,960
Speaker 10:  it'll put punctuation in rather than like an entire

479
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,920
Speaker 10:  long string of text which is like God bless my mother but that is what

480
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,960
Speaker 10:  I get from her every time she texts me. And you kind of seem like

481
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,680
Speaker 10:  a sociopath when you do that but I'm like, I would actually maybe

482
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,360
Speaker 10:  use voice texting on this phone and that's not a thing I

483
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,400
Speaker 10:  consider. So there's a lot of potential. I think there's more potential

484
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,520
Speaker 10:  for the Pixel eight and the eight Pro to be this phone of like it actually

485
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,280
Speaker 10:  does make your life a little easier but it's you, you gotta put

486
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,000
Speaker 10:  your trust in Google to get there.

487
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah. As with so many things, I just reviewed the Meta Quest three and it's

488
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,800
Speaker 2:  the same thing. It's like look, no wrong answers. If you feel good about

489
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,440
Speaker 2:  it, knock yourself out if you don't. I totally understand but like let's

490
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,920
Speaker 2:  all be clear-eyed about what you're signing up for here. Yes, yes. And it

491
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,480
Speaker 2:  all means somebody is going to see a lot of what you do in your life all

492
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,720
Speaker 2:  the time.

493
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,280
Speaker 10:  Oh yeah, yeah. You gotta be good with that too. Yeah, no big deal

494
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,200
Speaker 2:  All. right. Well I should let you get back to deciding which score you're

495
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Speaker 2:  gonna give it to piss off everybody on the verse.com. Thank you. But thank

496
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,480
Speaker 2:  you as always, really appreciate you coming on.

497
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,360
Speaker 10:  Yeah, thanks

498
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,440
Speaker 2:  All. right, let's switch gears and talk about the Pixel Watch two last year's

499
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,280
Speaker 2:  Pixel watch had a bunch of good ideas and nice designs but it felt

500
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,080
Speaker 2:  very much like a first generation product. It had all the kind of stupid

501
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,440
Speaker 2:  mistakes and weird build issues and all the stuff you do when you've

502
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,280
Speaker 2:  never done this before. So I've been looking forward to this one, the second

503
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,080
Speaker 2:  one ever since. Super curious what the second gen watch might

504
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,840
Speaker 2:  fix or improve upon and rethink after

505
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,000
Speaker 2:  a year of doing this Victoria song on our team has been reviewing it and

506
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,600
Speaker 2:  I'm desperately curious to hear how it's going. So let's hear how it's going.

507
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,320
Speaker 2:  Hi Vee.

508
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:54,920
Speaker 12:  Hello.

509
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,240
Speaker 2:  You were just telling me right before we started recording that the Pixel

510
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
Speaker 2:  watch two currently on your wrist is not the first Pixel

511
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,840
Speaker 2:  watch two. My first question was going to be is the Pixel watch

512
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,840
Speaker 2:  two less breakable than the original Pixel watch and suddenly I am

513
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
Speaker 2:  nervous. Tell me what's going on.

514
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,600
Speaker 12:  Yeah, so day two I was on day two with the Pixel watch two

515
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,640
Speaker 12:  I wake up and I look down several deep scratches

516
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,360
Speaker 12:  like all over the Pixel watch at like You know it was dark, it was

517
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,120
Speaker 12:  rainy so I was having a hard time telling if it was a crack or scratches.

518
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,200
Speaker 12:  So I was like oh my god I've had this for like two days.

519
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,080
Speaker 12:  I'm racking my brain to be like what did I do to do

520
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,000
Speaker 12:  this to the watch? And I couldn't remember anything. So You know I had to

521
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,800
Speaker 12:  go up to Google and be like, Hey guys, this is not gonna work.

522
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,240
Speaker 12:  We need review photos so can you get

523
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,040
Speaker 12:  me a new watch? And they actually did hand deliver a new watch and they

524
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,160
Speaker 12:  had a guy take a look at my scratched up Pixel watch and we were just standing

525
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,880
Speaker 12:  there in a circle for a bit being like what could have possibly caused this

526
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,480
Speaker 12:  And it So I still haven't heard back. They said they would get back to me

527
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,440
Speaker 12:  with like if there were any trace materials and the scratches that might

528
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,440
Speaker 12:  indicate what caused the scratches. But as far as I know

529
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,800
Speaker 12:  I went to bed, it was fine, woke up, scratches all over the

530
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:14,960
Speaker 12:  place.

531
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,880
Speaker 2:  Okay, so one of two things is happening here. Either you encountered

532
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,360
Speaker 2:  Wolverine but like tiny, tiny wolverine or two,

533
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,640
Speaker 2:  this is a really bad sign for the Pixel watch two because my main thing

534
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,080
Speaker 2:  with the Pixel watch one was like they did a lot of things right and we're

535
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,720
Speaker 2:  just missing kind of the like fit and finish and

536
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,320
Speaker 2:  structure of the thing that often you get right with the second one, first

537
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,960
Speaker 2:  one you're like learning how to make these things it's hard work, Watches

538
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,640
Speaker 2:  are hard, it's a circle, I get all that stuff. But the second one is like

539
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,960
Speaker 2:  we had this problem with the first one, the things got scratched. This feels

540
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,720
Speaker 2:  like a very bad sign. Does this strike you as a very bad sign?

541
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,080
Speaker 12:  So my main concern is that, and I like ran this story a couple

542
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,720
Speaker 12:  weeks ago, is that there's no current repair option

543
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,440
Speaker 12:  for the Pixel watch. And You know if you drop your watch and you

544
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,200
Speaker 12:  crack it, if you scratch your watch yourself, technically that's not covered

545
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,800
Speaker 12:  under a warranty. I'm not gentle with these Watches Watches just

546
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,120
Speaker 12:  in case people are wondering. Yeah I am. I'm very klutzy. I fall down

547
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,080
Speaker 12:  constantly. The original Pixel watch I was running once and I didn't do

548
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,560
Speaker 12:  the class properly and it went flying. Oh boy. Almost flew into the East

549
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,000
Speaker 12:  River and it was fine, no scratches and it was like skinning across asphalt.

550
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,920
Speaker 12:  So I really thank you have to be quite unlucky in some

551
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,760
Speaker 12:  respects. So You know, I wanna say I had the original for

552
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,720
Speaker 12:  a year and nothing bad happened to it. I had the new one for two days and

553
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,440
Speaker 12:  something bad happened to it. Yikes. So the second one I've had for

554
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,040
Speaker 12:  about five days now and nothing has happened to it. Okay. I've also been

555
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,000
Speaker 12:  a lot more conscious of where I put it down because that happened to

556
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,400
Speaker 12:  me. But like I'm hesitant to say that the Pixel watch is like

557
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,680
Speaker 12:  bad for that reason but just because of the curved display and

558
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,680
Speaker 12:  the way it looks, it is a little more prone to it. And other smartwatch

559
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,440
Speaker 12:  companies have moved on to like either sapphire crystal or

560
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,760
Speaker 12:  stronger materials. So that is just like a thing to keep in

561
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,960
Speaker 12:  mind. You just kind of have to be a little more careful with this one. I

562
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,200
Speaker 12:  think that's the lesson I learned with the Pixel watch too.

563
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,880
Speaker 2:  All. right. So let's talk about the rest of this watch. 'cause I think where

564
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,800
Speaker 2:  you and I landed last year was basically like pretty

565
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,760
Speaker 2:  good first start. Really excited to see the second one 'cause there

566
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,840
Speaker 2:  were a lot of things like we're talking about that felt like a company's

567
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,280
Speaker 2:  first wearable. The Fitbit thing was still relatively new. The integration

568
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,840
Speaker 2:  was kind of messy. The processor was old and not good enough. They did some

569
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,480
Speaker 2:  wonky stuff with the straps so it's like this was gonna be the one where

570
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,800
Speaker 2:  it was like, okay, if Google is serious about this and gonna do it, well

571
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,760
Speaker 2:  it's gonna start to put the pieces together. So

572
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,240
Speaker 2:  I have a bunch of specific questions for you but like big picture,

573
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,280
Speaker 2:  does it feel like a big step in that direction this time?

574
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,080
Speaker 12:  Yes. Aside from the fact that it's one size, usually it's

575
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,560
Speaker 12:  like one gigantic size and the small wrist that among us are complaining,

576
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,440
Speaker 12:  it's the opposite problem here. If you have big wrist, this is gonna look

577
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,360
Speaker 12:  very small and dainty on you. Aside from that and the issues

578
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,240
Speaker 12:  with the screens that I just mentioned in every other way, this is a pretty

579
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,720
Speaker 12:  sizable step forward. So that's like what stuck out to me the most

580
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:19,000
Speaker 12:  that usually the sequel isn't good. And I talk about this in my review

581
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,760
Speaker 12:  but we never talk about the Apple Watch series two. Like we talk about the

582
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,240
Speaker 12:  three, we talk about the original, we talk about the four or five six for

583
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,160
Speaker 12:  whatever reasons we never talk about the series two. Samsung

584
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,560
Speaker 12:  legitimately skipped a Galaxy Watch two, it didn't even bother with two,

585
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,120
Speaker 12:  it just went from the original to the three. Right. So You know generally

586
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,320
Speaker 12:  the second is either something that the first should have been

587
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,520
Speaker 12:  or it's just like the forgotten middle child of of

588
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,440
Speaker 12:  gadgets that we just don't ever talk about. And I think this is

589
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,160
Speaker 12:  the rare sequel that is definitively better than the original

590
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,960
Speaker 12:  with with a few caveats and exceptions which we'll get it to.

591
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,000
Speaker 2:  Okay so let, let's run down some of it. 'cause I, I went back to your review

592
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,400
Speaker 2:  last year and pulled out some of the things you liked and disliked and I

593
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,000
Speaker 2:  think the one that jumped out to me the most was battery life because you

594
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,960
Speaker 2:  had, I would say like middling battery life last year sort of in

595
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,640
Speaker 2:  normal use. It wasn't like dramatically worse than any other

596
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,280
Speaker 2:  smartwatch but it also wasn't particularly impressive. But then as soon as

597
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,160
Speaker 2:  you started doing stuff, especially exercising, the battery life was

598
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,520
Speaker 2:  kind of a mess. How is it this year?

599
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,440
Speaker 12:  It is a massive improvement. So like people asking for

600
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,240
Speaker 12:  multi-day battery life like Garmin levels or like truly Fitbit levels

601
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,720
Speaker 12:  stop. You're gonna be disappointed because you still have to charge this

602
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,400
Speaker 12:  every day. Sure. But you are gonna get 24 hours with

603
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,360
Speaker 12:  always on display enabled. Last year you could

604
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,200
Speaker 12:  get 24 hours if you turned off tilt till wake and you turned off the

605
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,560
Speaker 12:  A O D and you were just like super babying the watch

606
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,040
Speaker 12:  being very intentional with how you're using it when you're using it, you

607
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,680
Speaker 12:  don't have to do that as much this year because one it charges

608
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,000
Speaker 12:  a hell of a lot faster. Like this morning I went on a run,

609
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,200
Speaker 12:  I did all my like little exercise duty, dotes, whatever after a whole

610
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,600
Speaker 12:  night of charging. I had about a hundred percent at like

611
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,480
Speaker 12:  11:00 AM yesterday. Okay. So I'm, I'm here at

612
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,200
Speaker 12:  10:00 AM with 15% left and here we are about an hour later I'm

613
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,440
Speaker 12:  at full. I just went about my like shower putting on

614
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,200
Speaker 12:  clothes becoming a human again ritual and it was done

615
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,200
Speaker 12:  That's fast charge. Like I think 45 minutes to an hour is what most people

616
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,120
Speaker 12:  will need if you're not getting it down to zero. So that's pretty

617
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,840
Speaker 12:  great. And then just in terms of general usage, I

618
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,560
Speaker 12:  was writing down statistics left and right just because last year was

619
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,440
Speaker 12:  so bad. Like I went I think on a 30 minute to 45 minute run last

620
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,120
Speaker 12:  year and it drained

621
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,600
Speaker 12:  41%, 41%, which is absurd. That's terrible for such a short period of time.

622
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,160
Speaker 12:  And subsequent software updates fixed that so that it was less bad

623
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,840
Speaker 12:  but it's actually good now it's on par with Samsung in terms of battery

624
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,840
Speaker 12:  drain now. So I went on a bunch of two mile runs, I went on

625
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,160
Speaker 12:  a bunch of walks with the G P S enabled and I wanna say

626
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,080
Speaker 12:  that in general I was not losing anything more than six to

627
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,000
Speaker 12:  15%. And that's in a bunch of various like

628
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,760
Speaker 12:  situations. Sometimes when I'm streaming music offline, sometimes

629
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,120
Speaker 12:  I am actually using safety check while I'm doing my

630
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,760
Speaker 12:  workout. So that's enabling cellular the entire time kind of.

631
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,280
Speaker 12:  So You know there's just a lot of different scenarios. I never lost more

632
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,920
Speaker 12:  than 15% in a 30 to 45 minute time period, which

633
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,400
Speaker 12:  for most people that's like a solid workout. That's what you're gonna do.

634
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,000
Speaker 12:  And I had some really active days where I was getting a bunch of

635
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,720
Speaker 12:  auto auto workout tracking, which was a big issue with last year

636
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,680
Speaker 12:  as well. So You know I'm going about my day. I never really had to

637
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,600
Speaker 12:  worry about the the battery and I, I just

638
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Speaker 12:  so everyone knows, I did not use a single battery saving

639
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,160
Speaker 12:  feature this entire week,

640
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,880
Speaker 2:  Which is good and you shouldn't have to, right? Like I think what you're

641
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,680
Speaker 2:  describing to me is like what a smartwatch should be, which is basically

642
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,560
Speaker 2:  like I should take it off and charge it when I shower and get ready in the

643
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,720
Speaker 2:  morning and then I should never ever, ever think about its battery otherwise.

644
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,280
Speaker 2:  And it sounds like what you're describing is basically that, right? Like

645
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,120
Speaker 2:  it charges pretty quickly so that you can shower and get ready while

646
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,880
Speaker 2:  it charges. And then once again we're coming around to I need to put a

647
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,720
Speaker 2:  watch charger in my bathroom and I hate this And I still, people

648
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,120
Speaker 2:  sent me a bunch of pictures of like dangly Apple watch chargers in their

649
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,800
Speaker 2:  bathroom when I talked about this on The Vergecast a while back and I hate

650
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,600
Speaker 2:  it and it makes me so angry and yet this is the life I have to live. But

651
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 2:  it sounds like it's as good as it needs to be for you to like live your life

652
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,720
Speaker 2:  and not be annoyed by the battery And that feels like a huge win over last

653
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:41,920
Speaker 2:  year.

654
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,880
Speaker 12:  Yeah, it's a huge win and I think for the average person it's gonna be

655
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,720
Speaker 12:  great if you're a Garmin head and you're wondering

656
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,680
Speaker 12:  whether this is gonna last you a 14 hour hike with G P s

657
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,160
Speaker 12:  on, I don't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't bett all my chickens on that. That's

658
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,360
Speaker 12:  not like what you're not gonna be happy, this is not

659
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,040
Speaker 12:  enough of an improvement. But for the average person, the person who's looking

660
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,760
Speaker 12:  at a flagship smartwatch because they want all the Google services or because

661
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,200
Speaker 12:  they want to do something other than track fitness but also track

662
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,560
Speaker 12:  You know a reasonable walk every day or something like that. This is, this

663
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,240
Speaker 12:  is finally good enough.

664
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,680
Speaker 2:  So you mentioned two things in that description that were also issues that

665
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,360
Speaker 2:  the Pixel watch one had, which was the G P S, which was

666
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,840
Speaker 2:  sort of wacky and weird on the first watch and

667
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,680
Speaker 2:  automatic workout tracking, which was a thing it didn't do

668
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,880
Speaker 2:  at all I don't think, despite the fact that this is like a thing Fitbit's

669
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,360
Speaker 2:  pretty good at

670
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,040
Speaker 12:  It, did a version of it but not what people were wanting.

671
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:41,880
Speaker 12:  Okay,

672
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,840
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. Again, both of those better this year, hopefully supposedly

673
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,760
Speaker 2:  better this year. What have you found so far? So

674
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,520
Speaker 12:  The auto tracking is definitely better. I went on several walks

675
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,320
Speaker 12:  and You know do, do doting not starting a walk on purpose.

676
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,040
Speaker 12:  And I did get notifications that were like, Hey it looks like you're doing

677
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,960
Speaker 12:  a walk, would you like to record? And I was like Ah, here we go.

678
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:07,160
Speaker 12:  Great. On the other side they also have reminders to

679
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,920
Speaker 12:  stop your workout. Okay. So if you're the type of person that's just like

680
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,000
Speaker 12:  you get home, you lie down on the couch and you're like, why did I exercise?

681
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,800
Speaker 12:  This was a terrible mistake and you forget to turn off your activity

682
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,760
Speaker 12:  after about five minutes it will be like, yeah I I do you wanna stop

683
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,120
Speaker 12:  and You know? It did that for me like a couple of times when I was just

684
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,640
Speaker 12:  like sitting on a park bench taking in the sites or just

685
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,520
Speaker 12:  forgetting to turn off my walk. It did remind me to do that. So

686
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,120
Speaker 12:  on that front, yes it is better. G p s is a

687
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:41,360
Speaker 12:  mixed bag. I basically tested it without my Pixel phone when I went

688
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,280
Speaker 12:  on run so that I could use the Pixel Watches built-in G

689
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,240
Speaker 12:  P s. It takes a while to find a signal You know I've got an

690
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,800
Speaker 12:  ultra two on the other hand and the ultra two will find a signal like boom

691
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,880
Speaker 12:  done. Like I have to wait a second for it to find a signal. This sometimes

692
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,760
Speaker 12:  I have to wait around and I have to walk like 10 feet before it finds

693
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,280
Speaker 12:  a signal. Sometimes it's a little longer. And I live in an area

694
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,080
Speaker 12:  that's very challenging for G P s, I'm surrounded by water, I'm surrounded

695
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,920
Speaker 12:  by tall buildings. That's understandable. This is not necessarily a

696
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,520
Speaker 12:  thing that's limited to Google. A bunch of some aren't watch

697
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,520
Speaker 12:  companies, even those with good g p s have this issue where I live. It's

698
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,440
Speaker 12:  just something that I clocked and I had a weird instance

699
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,080
Speaker 12:  where I went on a run, the G P S map was only half

700
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,880
Speaker 12:  right And it said I only did 1.3 miles,

701
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,920
Speaker 12:  which is wrong. I never do just 1.3 miles on a run

702
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,960
Speaker 12:  two minimum is my, is my thing. Like I, I feel like I need to do two miles

703
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,920
Speaker 12:  to feel like I got at least some sort of cardio release going on. So I had

704
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,800
Speaker 12:  done about a a two mile run feeling like really good wanting to check

705
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,680
Speaker 12:  my stats after and it's like 1.3 miles in the app on on

706
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,560
Speaker 12:  my wrist. It was like 2.1 and then I was like this is, this is bull honky

707
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,520
Speaker 12:  so I'm trying to update it wouldn't update 24 hours later. It's like

708
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,400
Speaker 12:  you did 2.1 miles. Oh weird. So I feel like I've been gaslit

709
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,960
Speaker 12:  with G P S and I had this problem last year. Yeah

710
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,120
Speaker 12:  the maps were a lot less accurate last year. So there is some

711
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,840
Speaker 12:  mild improvement there. I just think there's something wonky going on in

712
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,720
Speaker 12:  the backend and I've reached out to Google like what's up? Why is it

713
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,400
Speaker 12:  doing this for this particular run? But I also have to mention that I went

714
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,040
Speaker 12:  on four runs total and it only did that for one of them

715
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,280
Speaker 12:  And I went on, according to this watch, like several walks this

716
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,200
Speaker 12:  weekend and those were all generally pretty accurate. So just on this one

717
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,120
Speaker 12:  run it had a 24 hour meltdown as to how far I actually

718
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,040
Speaker 12:  ran. And so my stats were wrong, which if you're like me, that's

719
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,200
Speaker 12:  unacceptable. It drives, it ruins your whole day, you get no credit. Oh

720
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,000
Speaker 12:  a hundred percent. Yeah for anything. So You know if that's

721
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,920
Speaker 12:  you, you might not be happy with that 'cause there

722
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,760
Speaker 12:  is some wonky backend going on and You know I've had that issue with Fitbit

723
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,680
Speaker 12:  over the years off and on. So that just might be a thing that they're still

724
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,960
Speaker 12:  kind of working out.

725
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,680
Speaker 2:  Speaking of the Fitbit thing, the last year we had a lot of questions

726
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,320
Speaker 2:  about Fitbit and Pixel and whether these two

727
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,160
Speaker 2:  companies that are now one company kind of understood how they work together

728
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,360
Speaker 2:  and then just before the Pixel watch two came out, Fitbit launched a new

729
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,280
Speaker 2:  Fitbit. Does this ecosystem make more sense to you than it did

730
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,880
Speaker 2:  like, it seems like they did a bunch of new Fitbit stuff in the Pixel watch

731
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,560
Speaker 2:  too. There's new sensors, skin temperature and stress and heart rate stress

732
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,480
Speaker 2:  I think is one of the things that Fitbit itself has been really, really You

733
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,040
Speaker 2:  know promoting and and spending a lot of time talking about over the last

734
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,320
Speaker 2:  year or so. Does the integration work better for you? Like do you, do you

735
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,800
Speaker 2:  kind of understand where Pixel ends and Fitbit begins now?

736
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,960
Speaker 12:  Yes. So last year was a total shit show. Like it was three

737
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,960
Speaker 12:  smart Watches, they nerfed the Google smartwatch in terms of fitness features

738
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,680
Speaker 12:  and health features and they took the the Fitbit Watches and went, we will

739
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,440
Speaker 12:  take everything that mildly made you slightly smarter and take it all

740
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,320
Speaker 12:  away. And so that's less of a problem this year because I think

741
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:04,320
Speaker 12:  last year by the nature of having three smart Watches, it was

742
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,000
Speaker 12:  very confusing and there was no real honest way to differentiate them

743
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,040
Speaker 12:  in a way that made sense. This year you have the Charge six, which is a

744
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,800
Speaker 12:  fitness band and you have the Pixel watch and the delineation between these

745
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,400
Speaker 12:  two And what features they offer is a lot clearer

746
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,440
Speaker 12:  and thank the fricking Lord that it is because when you have the Pixel

747
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,080
Speaker 12:  watch too, you're not wondering like, well Fitbits can do this, so why

748
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,880
Speaker 12:  can't this do that? Don't you have a Fitbit integration?

749
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,440
Speaker 12:  What's the deal? So yeah, there's, there's none of that This

750
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,360
Speaker 12:  year you get all the abnormal high low heart rate notifications. You

751
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,240
Speaker 12:  get all the E K G AFib notifications, both

752
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,080
Speaker 12:  passive and spot checks. You get the stress tracking which they introduced

753
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,960
Speaker 12:  with the Sense two last year. You get the continuous stress, stress

754
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,000
Speaker 12:  tracking, which is hilarious in many different ways. Yeah.

755
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,760
Speaker 2:  Speaking of making you feel feelings, like there's nothing quite like a notification

756
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,000
Speaker 2:  being like, are you stressed when you're stressed? Yeah. And you're like,

757
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,280
Speaker 2:  yes, thank you Fitbit. I am stressed. Thanks so much for asking.

758
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,640
Speaker 12:  Fitbit actually has the best implementation of stress tracking of

759
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,480
Speaker 12:  anybody out there. In my humble opinion. It's just a lot

760
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,480
Speaker 12:  more thoughtful. You could tell a lot of like thinking went into this

761
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,760
Speaker 12:  because you are not going to get notified when the stress is happening,

762
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,040
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah. They try to do it after, which I appreciate

763
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Speaker 12:  You're gonna get a delay. Which it comes with its own trade offs because

764
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,920
Speaker 12:  I, I'll get notifications and I'll be like, what was I doing three hours

765
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,920
Speaker 12:  ago when I was having this bodily stress response? Right? Was

766
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,600
Speaker 12:  I happy? Was I sad? I don't know. But sometimes it is very

767
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,880
Speaker 12:  relevant. Like I actually got some bad personal news last week my

768
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,800
Speaker 12:  grandma died and like in the moment I was just like, I'm going

769
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,400
Speaker 12:  to shut down and compartmentalize because I have work to do and

770
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,560
Speaker 12:  also Korea's a different time zone so we'll deal with this later. And then

771
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,440
Speaker 12:  later when I actually did get to deal with it, about an hour after I had

772
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,280
Speaker 12:  processed all the feelings, it was like, hey, we found a stress response.

773
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,240
Speaker 12:  Would you like to look your mood? And I was like,

774
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:07,880
Speaker 12:  sure. Sad. That's what it was. That's what it

775
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,720
Speaker 12:  was. But You know, it does take, it does like give you a second to kind

776
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,560
Speaker 12:  of think and log the mood and if

777
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,400
Speaker 12:  you're in a place where you can whip out your phone and write

778
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,320
Speaker 12:  a sentence or two, there's at least a prompt there. I don't think that

779
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,280
Speaker 12:  mood journaling is a natural human impulse. So when we saw this

780
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,760
Speaker 12:  with watchOS 10 where apple's like you have these abstract

781
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:34,520
Speaker 12:  moods that you can log on your watch. Yeah. I, I never used it because

782
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,400
Speaker 12:  I'm not gonna be like in a moment where I'm stressed and like, wow, this

783
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,480
Speaker 12:  was really stressful. I should log this for posterity.

784
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it it, that never did anything for me.

785
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,800
Speaker 12:  That never did anything. So this is actually, it's not perfect. There is

786
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,640
Speaker 12:  a delay. You have to remember how you were feeling when you were feeling

787
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,040
Speaker 12:  and be in a position to be able to log the mood. But there's context for

788
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,920
Speaker 12:  it. Okay.

789
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,360
Speaker 2:  I like it. Anything else about the watch that that jumps out to you? It strikes

790
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,400
Speaker 2:  me as like as a, as an everyday fitness tracker, it is like

791
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,960
Speaker 2:  unambiguously much better than last year. It seems like Google's kind of

792
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,840
Speaker 2:  right there now, right?

793
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,240
Speaker 12:  It's surprising because You know when you have the Pixel phones, you're

794
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,320
Speaker 12:  just kinda like why are you making this Google with this? You kind of get

795
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,160
Speaker 12:  why they're making it and they actually have a shot to be the

796
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,920
Speaker 12:  best at something. So I don't do, I think that the Pixel watch too

797
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,960
Speaker 12:  is the best Android smartwatch out there right now. I'm still kind of

798
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,760
Speaker 12:  like, no. Okay. I still think Samsung is slightly better but the gap is

799
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,640
Speaker 12:  a lot, lot smaller. It is a lot smaller. They did a lot better

800
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,280
Speaker 12:  than I thought they were going to do And some of that actually is because

801
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,720
Speaker 12:  I think they were pretty unique in the safety features this year with safety

802
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,640
Speaker 12:  check and safety signal. So I actually just used safety signal this morning

803
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,920
Speaker 12:  'cause I was like, I'm leaving this watch at home but I'm going to like

804
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,200
Speaker 12:  see how this affects my battery to use safety signal and You know I

805
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,080
Speaker 12:  don't have an L T E plan on the watch, but I was still able to send notifications

806
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,880
Speaker 12:  about where my location was to my husband while I was out there. And

807
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,640
Speaker 12:  You know if you ever see any girl with her girlfriends

808
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,360
Speaker 12:  when they're leaving, they're like, text me when you get home. So that's

809
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,160
Speaker 12:  sort of like a, an acknowledgement that that is a cultural thing that

810
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,120
Speaker 12:  yeah, I have to do. And it's kind of nice that I can just set a

811
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:21,080
Speaker 12:  timer and it gives the reason why I am setting that timer and

812
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,880
Speaker 12:  my location now. My husband was just like, oh she's just testing something

813
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,800
Speaker 12:  Ignore. So like if something had happened to me, I

814
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Speaker 12:  don't know that it would've been particularly useful. Yeah. For that particular

815
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,920
Speaker 12:  use case. Yeah, I do think that's cool. There is, there's some little wonkiness

816
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,760
Speaker 12:  there though because safety signal is basically you being

817
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,320
Speaker 12:  able to access emergency features without having an L T E

818
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:47,160
Speaker 12:  plan. But you still need to have the L T E watch. So

819
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:51,560
Speaker 12:  that is a little inelegant if you ask me. And you also have to

820
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,480
Speaker 12:  have a Fitbit premium subscription in order to have the safety

821
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,320
Speaker 12:  signal. So it's just like kind of saving maybe $10 a month

822
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,840
Speaker 12:  max in order to have the emergency features. It's kind of a

823
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,840
Speaker 12:  nice option to have but also doesn't fully

824
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:12,120
Speaker 12:  make sense. And you would think that why not just also offer

825
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,000
Speaker 12:  that to non L T E models, but it's not on the non L T

826
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,920
Speaker 12:  E models. So there's like a lot of stuff like that, small things

827
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,600
Speaker 12:  that are just kind of like, well why did you do it this way? And it leads

828
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,080
Speaker 12:  into my other kind of quandary in question with the Pixel watch too. Is

829
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,960
Speaker 12:  that, are we heading towards more ecosystem fragmentation

830
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:34,880
Speaker 12:  because the thing about the original Pixel watch that I was just like yes,

831
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,080
Speaker 12:  was that it was for everyone who had an Android phone. Yep. Samsung Gate

832
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,640
Speaker 12:  keeps health features. Samsung Gate keeps certain things to Samsung

833
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:46,720
Speaker 12:  phones and that wasn't a thing that you had to think about with

834
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,440
Speaker 12:  the Pixel watch, but it is something you have to think about now with the

835
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,240
Speaker 12:  Pixel watch too in that like do you want this to automatically

836
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,160
Speaker 12:  recognize that it's bedtime and turn on low power mode so you get an extra

837
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,720
Speaker 12:  10 to 15% battery when you wake up in the morning? 'cause it does save about

838
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,560
Speaker 12:  that much. Cool. If you have a Pixel phone, you can go into the digital

839
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,480
Speaker 12:  wellness settings and make it so that it auto syncs with your

840
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:13,240
Speaker 12:  watch and will automatically go into bedtime mode, which the original does

841
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,080
Speaker 12:  not do. You have to manually do it and who falls asleep going

842
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,480
Speaker 12:  must, must put bedtime mode into to my watch. I never did that

843
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,960
Speaker 12:  so that was a huge problem. I don't have to do that with this because I've

844
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,920
Speaker 12:  paired it to a Pixel phone. I'm still gonna have to do this manually if

845
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,880
Speaker 12:  I pair it to a Samsung phone. So like we're starting to have instances

846
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:36,960
Speaker 12:  like that where I'm just like, hey you guys were supposed to be

847
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,720
Speaker 12:  the ecosystem like agnostic watch

848
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,280
Speaker 12:  and now you are kind of putting some things in there that make it better

849
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,320
Speaker 12:  with Pixel phones. So like it's not

850
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,720
Speaker 12:  available now, but they were saying that it could screen your calls in a

851
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,600
Speaker 12:  future software drop. So that is also gonna be limited to

852
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,160
Speaker 12:  Pixel phones only. So I'm like aha, I see we are introducing

853
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,440
Speaker 12:  some ecosystem nonsense into the mix. There

854
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,280
Speaker 2:  Was a lot of that this year. I think in the, in the phones too, there's a

855
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,520
Speaker 2:  definite sense that Google is getting more comfortable keeping stuff for

856
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,280
Speaker 2:  itself and it's like, it's still probably like if you

857
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,160
Speaker 2:  don't own a Samsung phone or a Google phone, it seems like the

858
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:21,160
Speaker 2:  Pixel watch is probably the more ecosystem friendly of the two if

859
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,720
Speaker 2:  you're gonna pair it to some other Android device. But it is, I I agree with

860
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,680
Speaker 2:  you. It's still a little concerning to see Google sort of slowly start

861
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,480
Speaker 2:  to close the doors and they're like, we just mostly wanna sell you Pixel

862
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:31,840
Speaker 2:  stuff

863
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Speaker 12:  Because like I get, if you don't want a Pixel phone, especially if you're

864
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,120
Speaker 12:  in the us like Android users tend to have Samsung phones. They're

865
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,320
Speaker 12:  totally makes sense. I really hate how it seems companies

866
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,000
Speaker 12:  are using Smart Watches as cudgels to keep you in a, in an ecosystem

867
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,400
Speaker 12:  like Yep. I occasionally want to switch to an Android phone just 'cause

868
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,240
Speaker 12:  my iPhone is pissing me off but I'll never do it because I have an Apple

869
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,120
Speaker 12:  watch. So like that's very annoying to me. Yeah and I

870
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,040
Speaker 12:  see Google doing this here and it was just sort of like, ah you guys,

871
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,200
Speaker 12:  you you I was, I was rooting for you to keep it platform agnostic

872
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,840
Speaker 12:  and Garmin is still the only truly platform agnostic thing.

873
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I agree. But I think in general the story you're telling about the

874
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,640
Speaker 2:  Pixel Watch two makes me excited. I feel like, I think you're right that

875
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,080
Speaker 2:  Google has a lot of incentive to keep building this thing, not least because

876
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,800
Speaker 2:  it's spent a hell of a lot of money on Fitbit and the fact that it is

877
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,680
Speaker 2:  sort of systematically improving the things that weren't great give me hope

878
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,360
Speaker 2:  that like as it keeps working on this stuff, I think the the form factor

879
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,400
Speaker 2:  ideas it has are right. I think some of the assistant stuff, especially as

880
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,480
Speaker 2:  they start incorporating the large language model stuff is gonna start to

881
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,320
Speaker 2:  be very cool. There are a lot of interesting places this could go and I,

882
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,080
Speaker 2:  I think it gives me hope that Google might actually know how to build a good

883
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,360
Speaker 2:  smartwatch over time, which I was not sure of last year.

884
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,640
Speaker 12:  I was not sure of that either. But I really do think that if they get

885
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,320
Speaker 12:  their shit together and they really stay on top of the Fitbit

886
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:56,240
Speaker 12:  integration, which it's kind of rocky at this point, not a lot of people

887
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,120
Speaker 12:  are loving the Fitbit app redesign, which I can kind of understand having

888
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,840
Speaker 12:  played with it for a few days more deeply. But it's just like if you can

889
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,560
Speaker 12:  stay on top of that, if you can manage to not piss every Fitbit user

890
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:11,680
Speaker 12:  who's been there for the last 20 years or however off, if you can

891
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,240
Speaker 12:  continue to innovate and I, I really do think Samsung should be worried

892
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:20,280
Speaker 12:  they should start not resting on their loyal laurels. 'cause the

893
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,000
Speaker 12:  Galaxy Watch six was incredibly iterative. I almost fell asleep writing

894
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,120
Speaker 12:  the review even though it's a great watch. I was just like, it's the same

895
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,040
Speaker 12:  as last year kind of. Oh my god. So by

896
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,680
Speaker 12:  nature of being new, even if it's not perfect, it's still more

897
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,520
Speaker 12:  exciting than the existing Android options. And because it's Google

898
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,840
Speaker 12:  and because they own the software platform, I dunno they

899
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,600
Speaker 12:  have the chance to be the best at something which besides search engines,

900
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,480
Speaker 12:  what can you say that Google is the best at? So I don't know. It's very

901
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:50,960
Speaker 12:  interesting

902
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,480
Speaker 2:  And maybe not even search engines but that's a different podcast. We will

903
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,240
Speaker 2:  come back to that All. right. We should take a break. But vie thank you as

904
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,440
Speaker 2:  always. If you figure out your tiny Wolverine problem come back on and let

905
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,040
Speaker 2:  us know. Okay,

906
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,680
Speaker 12:  I I

907
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,040
Speaker 2:  Will Thank you All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come

908
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,400
Speaker 2:  back. We're gonna talk about Chromebooks

909
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,170
Speaker 2:  Welcome back a couple of weeks ago Google announced a new program called

910
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:13,130
Speaker 2:  Chromebook Plus basically a designation for computers that meet a certain

911
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:17,170
Speaker 2:  set of criteria for processors, screens, webcams, that sort

912
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:21,250
Speaker 2:  of thing. And thus all in should be up to a slightly higher

913
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:25,650
Speaker 2:  standard as a pc. As a person who loves Chromebooks and hasn't

914
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,490
Speaker 2:  frankly seen one that I actually wanna buy in a few years, this

915
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:33,330
Speaker 2:  makes me happy. But it's also kind of confusing. I've sincerely

916
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,290
Speaker 2:  never been able to tell exactly how much Google cares about Chromebooks.

917
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,290
Speaker 2:  They're hugely successful in schools, which is obviously great for Google

918
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:45,010
Speaker 2:  because it gets young users using Google products. Obviously a big win for

919
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:48,930
Speaker 2:  the company. But is that it or does Google really want to compete with

920
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,890
Speaker 2:  Windows and Mac OSS and Dell and HP and whoever else and be a serious

921
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,690
Speaker 2:  player in the PC market? It honestly feels like some days it does

922
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,530
Speaker 2:  and goes all in on this idea and then it cancels a bunch of products and

923
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:04,370
Speaker 2:  changes its mind like four months later and then four months after that

924
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,930
Speaker 2:  decides to go all in again. I just sincerely don't understand.

925
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:12,050
Speaker 2:  Anyway, Monica Chin on our team has been covering Chromebook Plus over the

926
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:15,930
Speaker 2:  last couple of weeks and has been reviewing Chromebooks for years. So

927
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:19,290
Speaker 2:  I brought her in to help me figure out what this actually means for the future

928
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,200
Speaker 2:  of Chromebooks Monica Welcome back to The Vergecast, thank you very much.

929
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,640
Speaker 2:  Thank you for allowing me to drag you here to talk about Chromebooks, which

930
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,640
Speaker 2:  is a thing I think I care about more than possibly any other person.

931
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,720
Speaker 14:  Look, you don't have to tell me twice. I could talk for days and days about

932
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,440
Speaker 14:  Chromebooks. This could be the Chromebook podcast

933
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,800
Speaker 2:  I'm in. But the reason we're here is because of Chromebook Plus,

934
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:39,880
Speaker 14:  Chromebook Plus.

935
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,280
Speaker 2:  I feel like the Chromebook world is forever whipsawing in

936
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,200
Speaker 2:  Google's mind between like we wanna make this good and make

937
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,360
Speaker 2:  great computers and Chromebooks can be competitive. We think they're the

938
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,160
Speaker 2:  laptops of the future and swinging back the other way of just

939
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,960
Speaker 2:  like Chromebooks surfer kids in school and they're designed to be as cheap

940
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,600
Speaker 2:  as possible and who cares And then they just sort of swing back and forth

941
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,120
Speaker 2:  between those two. Where do you feel like we've been on that pendulum

942
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,200
Speaker 2:  for let's say like the last 12 months?

943
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,440
Speaker 14:  Yeah, so companies have been trying to make

944
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:16,520
Speaker 14:  the quote unquote premium Chromebook into a thing for like

945
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,040
Speaker 14:  quite some time now.

946
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,560
Speaker 2:  Like a decade. Yeah.

947
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:23,560
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And by premium I mean like a Chromebook that you could charge more

948
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,080
Speaker 14:  than a thousand dollars for and like people would buy it that

949
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,320
Speaker 14:  in the Windows laptop world we are at a point where that is not

950
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,280
Speaker 14:  like a super super high price. It's certainly a lot of money, like no one's

951
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,640
Speaker 14:  like owe a thousand dollars super cheap. But we're at a point where like

952
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,440
Speaker 14:  that is a price that like is not only reserved for super

953
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,080
Speaker 14:  expensive gaming laptops like that is something you would pay for maybe

954
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,880
Speaker 14:  a Dell X P S 13 or a Galaxy Book like something like that.

955
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,840
Speaker 14:  Yeah. But for Chromebooks that is still very much like a You know you put

956
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,760
Speaker 14:  a Chromebook out that costs that much, that is not that much less than

957
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,360
Speaker 14:  the MacBook Air You know it needs to be really well built and the question

958
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,320
Speaker 14:  is like can we convince people to pay that much for Chromebooks? So we had

959
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,720
Speaker 14:  Samsung which has tried the Galaxy Chromebook which was

960
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,640
Speaker 14:  beautiful and gorgeous had an OLA screen. Just honestly one

961
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,760
Speaker 14:  of the prettiest computers I've ever used. Battery lasted like four hours

962
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,880
Speaker 14:  was not not a good time to actually use, they tried the Galaxy Chromebook

963
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,600
Speaker 14:  two, it was a little less expensive still like very

964
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,440
Speaker 14:  red. That was like one of the big things about the Galaxy Chromebook line

965
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,240
Speaker 14:  is you get a red one.

966
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,480
Speaker 2:  I love the red,

967
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:28,320
Speaker 14:  Love the red. Really gorgeous Galaxy Chromebook two was like not as

968
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,240
Speaker 14:  beautiful. Screen was like not as premium but it was a little

969
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,440
Speaker 14:  bit less expensive that I think everyone kind of agreed was a better way

970
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,000
Speaker 14:  to go about it. HP has tried like a dragonfly Chromebook,

971
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:43,440
Speaker 14:  they started out putting out like this gorgeous like reminiscent of

972
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,520
Speaker 14:  the actual HP dragonfly line, which is a very big famous business line.

973
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,000
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Like something that they were trying to push on like oh this is for

974
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,880
Speaker 14:  the C-suite. They also kind of ended up knocking that down to something

975
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,800
Speaker 14:  that to the HP Dragonfly Pro is like one they put out

976
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,160
Speaker 14:  now, which is like more of a, again, more of a modest like

977
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:04,560
Speaker 14:  not quite as ole gorgeous beautiful but it has an R G

978
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,720
Speaker 14:  B keyboard. It's still kind of cool prices and more closer to a thousand

979
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,800
Speaker 14:  dollars. Like they've also sort of bumped down to sort of more of a mid

980
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,680
Speaker 14:  range tier. So You know you see companies here and there sort of try this

981
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,560
Speaker 14:  thing and then I haven't really seen an example of

982
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,480
Speaker 14:  one that has become so successful that they've continued putting out

983
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,440
Speaker 14:  tons and tons more versions of it. Right. Which is what you do

984
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,280
Speaker 14:  see with some Chromebooks that do become very successful. Like Acer's Chromebooks,

985
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,960
Speaker 14:  spin seven 13 or You know stuff that's in that tier.

986
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,280
Speaker 2:  So do you think it's even possible, this is a a thought experiment I have

987
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,400
Speaker 2:  been through many times over the years that if you could get

988
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:44,480
Speaker 2:  everything else right, like I think, I think we agree that the the MacBook

989
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,240
Speaker 2:  Air is probably the closest to doing all of the laptop things right As

990
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,480
Speaker 2:  anyone at this moment. If you just took a MacBook Air and all of the things

991
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,960
Speaker 2:  that it does very well, battery life and performance and the way it looks

992
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,680
Speaker 2:  and the keyboard and all this stuff took out Mac OSS and put in Chrome oss,

993
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,880
Speaker 2:  could you sell that to people for a thousand dollars?

994
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:04,120
Speaker 14:  Yeah. So it's tough because the number of like

995
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:08,080
Speaker 14:  full fledged apps you can use on Chrome oss,

996
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,160
Speaker 14:  the options you have are not as many at this point. Now there

997
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:15,880
Speaker 14:  are ways to use lots of the big

998
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:19,960
Speaker 14:  Windows apps, the big like quote unquote premium Windows apps on

999
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,120
Speaker 14:  ChromeOS. Like there are versions of like Photoshop for

1000
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,080
Speaker 14:  web and like the different Adobe apps office is on there

1001
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,120
Speaker 14:  in some form. And then there are of course Android apps which like You know

1002
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,840
Speaker 14:  that is a whole separate conversation about like how well Android apps

1003
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,760
Speaker 14:  on Chromebook are or are not going. Yeah. But like there are versions of

1004
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,680
Speaker 14:  things like Spotify, there's a version of it you can use on ChromeOS

1005
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:47,960
Speaker 14:  Slack. As far as I know there is not still. Although it's always

1006
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,720
Speaker 14:  hard to know 'cause that one has been like coming and going yeah seriously

1007
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:54,640
Speaker 14:  the store for years, like literally I could say it Today and tomorrow it

1008
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,360
Speaker 14:  could come back or go right? It's hard to know. You know PWAs are like

1009
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,160
Speaker 14:  things that you can use. So there are options but it is

1010
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,840
Speaker 14:  still a little bit more complicated. Like if you were on Windows and you

1011
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,560
Speaker 14:  wanna use a professional app that leverage your G P U

1012
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:13,760
Speaker 14:  or You know play a game, whatever it is, you go on Steam you on

1013
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,240
Speaker 14:  the Microsoft store, you just download it and then it's there. And on Chrome

1014
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,360
Speaker 14:  os it is still more complicated to figure out like okay, do I have to use

1015
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,480
Speaker 14:  this on the web? Is the Android app the best option? Maybe there is an Android

1016
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,720
Speaker 14:  app option but maybe instead I should be using the pwa. Like there's just

1017
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,640
Speaker 14:  a it it's a little bit more complicated and not as robust of

1018
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,360
Speaker 14:  a software ecosystem. Yeah. That said there certainly are other

1019
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,120
Speaker 14:  benefits to Chrome OSS over like something like Windows or Mac oss.

1020
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,800
Speaker 14:  People love how quick it is to boot. I mean it boots like almost instantly.

1021
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,680
Speaker 14:  Yep. That's like a big draw of it. Background security updates, those are

1022
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,040
Speaker 14:  like a thing that people really like. A lot of people like to run

1023
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,400
Speaker 14:  Linux on their Chromebooks. That is a thing you can do. The

1024
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:57,760
Speaker 14:  crowd that these quote unquote premium Chromebooks have sort of

1025
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,520
Speaker 14:  been targeting is a crowd of people that You know Chrome OSS

1026
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:05,080
Speaker 14:  for ages and ages. Many people have associated with like this is for students,

1027
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,800
Speaker 14:  this is for like kids or budget shoppers. The

1028
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,800
Speaker 14:  contingent of people that the premium Chromebook has sort of been trying

1029
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,640
Speaker 14:  to target is people who are not students. People who are like, who have

1030
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,360
Speaker 14:  some deep pockets who are your engineers or creators

1031
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,440
Speaker 14:  or You know business executives, whatever job they have. But you

1032
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,120
Speaker 14:  prefer Chrome OS to Windows or Mac OS because of these other benefits that

1033
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,000
Speaker 14:  it has. But they don't wanna be limited to like cheap devices that are

1034
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Speaker 14:  built for students. They want the kind of premium hardware that You know

1035
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,560
Speaker 14:  there are coworkers in the C-suite are all on Think pads or HP

1036
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,480
Speaker 14:  dragonflies and they want a laptop that runs Chromes but has that same kind

1037
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,160
Speaker 14:  of You know really nice build.

1038
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,160
Speaker 2:  I think you just described like the perfect second

1039
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,920
Speaker 2:  device, right? Like the thing you're describing where it's like you can do

1040
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,040
Speaker 2:  almost everything but some of it is gonna be kind of hacky is also kind of

1041
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,960
Speaker 2:  the way the iPad works. And so I think if you like want

1042
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:01,920
Speaker 2:  to be the person who uses an iPad for work, like you can do it, but

1043
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,560
Speaker 2:  you're gonna do a bunch of things in these really wacky hacky ways that

1044
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:09,400
Speaker 2:  aren't as easy as on some other systems. And I feel like Chromes has a handful

1045
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,960
Speaker 2:  of those, which I guess has always been the problem. 'cause it's like if

1046
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,680
Speaker 2:  you want a light thin, simple computer

1047
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,800
Speaker 2:  that boots really fast and you just like wanna send a bunch of emails while

1048
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,920
Speaker 2:  you're on a plane, like Chromebook is perfect but for most people that can't

1049
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,400
Speaker 2:  be the only computer you own.

1050
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:27,040
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And when you get above a thousand dollars, that just starts becoming

1051
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:31,040
Speaker 14:  expensive for most people. You know as a second device

1052
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,320
Speaker 14:  and You know I write about Chromebooks every time I write something like

1053
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,600
Speaker 14:  this. The comment section is full of people who are just like, well actually

1054
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,720
Speaker 14:  it's really easy to use blah blah blah program if you just get on Linux

1055
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,800
Speaker 14:  and do blah blah blah blah. And it's like, yeah that's that's great. Yeah.

1056
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,440
Speaker 14:  But it is like a slightly more of a hiccup than it is to just download on

1057
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:47,600
Speaker 14:  Windows.

1058
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:51,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah. If your, if your answer to a problem is download Linux like you're,

1059
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,080
Speaker 2:  you're telling on yourself in a way that I don't think you understand.

1060
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,880
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And so there, there is certainly contingent there are in in my comment

1061
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,240
Speaker 14:  section it's full of, of people who You know are in that group. The question

1062
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,600
Speaker 14:  is really how big is that group and is that group big enough to really sustain

1063
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,440
Speaker 14:  a rigorous ecosystem of these products that goes on for years and years

1064
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,000
Speaker 14:  and years.

1065
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:13,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So Google I guess to its either detriment or

1066
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,160
Speaker 2:  credit seems committed to this idea that it is going to figure out how to

1067
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,000
Speaker 2:  sell high end Chromebooks. So tell me about the Chromebook

1068
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,160
Speaker 2:  Plus program that was just announced. Yeah,

1069
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,800
Speaker 14:  So the Chromebook Plus is a certification and if you're familiar with what

1070
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:30,360
Speaker 14:  Intel EVO is, it's kind of a similar idea.

1071
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,560
Speaker 14:  Evo was previously Project Athena and previously before that was the, the

1072
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,320
Speaker 14:  ultra book label. It's kind of like companies will

1073
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:42,560
Speaker 14:  roll out these certifications. They, they have like a list of

1074
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,280
Speaker 14:  requirements and if your computer meets that list of requirements you can

1075
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:49,360
Speaker 14:  put that label, you can license that brand and you can put it on your

1076
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:53,160
Speaker 14:  product. And then You know in, in this case if your laptop qualifies

1077
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,960
Speaker 14:  for the Chromebook Plus branding, you can then put your laptop

1078
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:00,080
Speaker 14:  on the Best Buy shelf. It'll have a big sticker that has like Chromebook

1079
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,840
Speaker 14:  Plus or whatever it is. You can have Chromebook Plus in the name You know

1080
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,680
Speaker 14:  in the Best Buy listing. It might say like a use Chromebook Plus and then

1081
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,800
Speaker 14:  You know the idea is they'll promote this Chromebook Plus label as You know

1082
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,400
Speaker 14:  these are the plus laptops.

1083
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,640
Speaker 2:  I mean these are the good ones is what it's saying. Right?

1084
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,400
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And then Chromebooks without label will be more likely to be purchased.

1085
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,640
Speaker 14:  That's the idea of programs like this,

1086
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,720
Speaker 2:  Which I, which I think is fine. Like part of me wants to make fun of Google

1087
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,600
Speaker 2:  for essentially having to come up with a label that says these are our good

1088
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,080
Speaker 2:  computers. Which implies that most of your computers are not good computers.

1089
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,960
Speaker 2:  But I also understand that there's a gigantic portion of the Chromebook world

1090
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,960
Speaker 2:  that is incredibly price sensitive and is just

1091
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,640
Speaker 2:  like, is buying these things in bulk is buying these things for schools.

1092
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:43,640
Speaker 2:  Like I get that what's on the list of things you have to

1093
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,360
Speaker 2:  do to be a Chromebook Plus computer?

1094
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:50,040
Speaker 14:  Yeah, so compared to the Intel Levo standard, which is this kind of thing

1095
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,880
Speaker 14:  that Intel runs or something like a M D Advantage which a MD runs for

1096
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,480
Speaker 14:  gaming stuff, it is not a particularly extensive list. So

1097
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,280
Speaker 14:  we, you have to have an Intel core I three or a Horizon 7,000

1098
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,400
Speaker 14:  processor, which

1099
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,840
Speaker 2:  Is basically just like a quality class PC processor.

1100
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,800
Speaker 14:  Yeah. So if you have a seller on like that, that's not a core i three or

1101
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,640
Speaker 14:  higher, that doesn't count an I P S panel with at least 10 80 p resolution,

1102
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,200
Speaker 14:  a 10 80 P webcam, eight gigabytes of ram and 128

1103
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,160
Speaker 14:  gigabytes of storage. That is pretty much all we were given in terms of

1104
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,200
Speaker 14:  what the, the requirements are.

1105
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:26,080
Speaker 2:  That seems like, I mean and I guess maybe this is the idea but that is like

1106
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:30,240
Speaker 2:  bare minimum decent laptop specs. Anyone who is like, I want

1107
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,040
Speaker 2:  a laptop that is pretty good. I would tell everyone to

1108
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,160
Speaker 2:  not get anything less than any of those things. Like you're just sabotaging

1109
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,160
Speaker 2:  yourself if you get anything lower than those specs.

1110
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,560
Speaker 14:  I mean I don't know that I think a Chromebook needs to have a Windows laptop.

1111
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:44,400
Speaker 14:  Yes, sure.

1112
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:44,720
Speaker 2:  Okay.

1113
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:48,480
Speaker 14:  Chromebook I think these are, some of these to me would be like okay, this

1114
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,080
Speaker 14:  is a quote unquote good Chromebook that you're shopping for in particular.

1115
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,000
Speaker 14:  I mean the 10 80 p webcam, like that's

1116
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,400
Speaker 2:  Fair. Yeah.

1117
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,680
Speaker 14:  128 gigabytes of storage. Like there's a time when I would've said that

1118
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,440
Speaker 14:  was a little high higher than is necessary. Every Chromebook just ChromeOS

1119
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,240
Speaker 14:  doesn't take up as much space as Windows does the Ram similarly. But

1120
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,760
Speaker 14:  I think they are sort of meant to signal like this is a Chromebook that

1121
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,600
Speaker 14:  has like some pretty solid specs for the category.

1122
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:14,280
Speaker 2:  Two things I noticed missing in those specs. One,

1123
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,040
Speaker 2:  anything having to do with design or materials or fit and finish or

1124
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,920
Speaker 2:  weight or whatever. No sense of like what this thing is supposed to look

1125
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,040
Speaker 2:  like.

1126
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,400
Speaker 14:  Yep. No sense of that. The

1127
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,320
Speaker 2:  Other one is battery life, which I would argue yeah for a Chromebook

1128
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:31,640
Speaker 2:  is maybe the single most important spec that exists on a device

1129
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:35,040
Speaker 2:  like that. You asked them about the battery life emission. Right? What did

1130
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:35,400
Speaker 2:  they tell you?

1131
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,840
Speaker 14:  So I tried very hard to find out about this and it was a little bit of an

1132
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,720
Speaker 14:  adventure. So at the Chromebook Plus like event that we were all at

1133
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,960
Speaker 14:  where they announced it, we were like looking at the list, they put the

1134
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,680
Speaker 14:  list up on the big screen when they were like giving the speech or whatever.

1135
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,560
Speaker 14:  And I immediately said, why is battery life not on there? So You know after

1136
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:55,080
Speaker 14:  the talk gets out I hunt down one of the Google people and I'm like hey

1137
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,600
Speaker 14:  so why isn't battery, why isn't there a battery life requirement? And he's

1138
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,840
Speaker 14:  like Oh there totally is. There's definitely a battery life requirement.

1139
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,040
Speaker 14:  We just like, we didn't announce it on stage. And I was like, I feel like

1140
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:03,480
Speaker 2:  Lead with that. Like

1141
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,000
Speaker 14:  I was like what's the battery life requirement? And he was like, oh I don't

1142
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,080
Speaker 14:  know but like it'll be in the press release. So we wait You know a couple

1143
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,520
Speaker 14:  days press release comes out, there's no battery life requirement in there.

1144
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,880
Speaker 14:  I email, I email him back. Cool. I'm like hey. So You know you

1145
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,120
Speaker 14:  said there was a battery life requirement in the press release. There's

1146
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,800
Speaker 14:  not You know is is there a battery life requirement? What's going on? Couple

1147
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,480
Speaker 14:  days later to my recollection Google gets back to me and they

1148
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:30,240
Speaker 14:  say the following, all Chromebooks are required to meet a 10 hour battery

1149
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,080
Speaker 14:  life requirement based on internal testing standards. Well not a new requirement

1150
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,840
Speaker 14:  for Chromebook Plus dot dot Chromebook Plus laptops must also

1151
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,800
Speaker 14:  adhere to this. So that's their claim. Now I have

1152
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,720
Speaker 14:  no idea what testing sta their internal testing standards are for that 10

1153
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:49,480
Speaker 14:  hour battery life requirement in the first place. So that's not really saving

1154
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,000
Speaker 14:  that means much to me. Can

1155
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,800
Speaker 2:  You remember the last Chromebook you tested they got 10 hours of battery

1156
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,080
Speaker 2:  life?

1157
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,720
Speaker 14:  No, I'm there. There has certainly been some but I don't remember. I

1158
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,480
Speaker 2:  Think it's been a while. Well and and to your point, I mean some of the ones

1159
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:04,360
Speaker 2:  that we've liked in the past, even the high end ones have been crushed

1160
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,200
Speaker 2:  by their battery life. The Galaxy Chromebooks were a really good example

1161
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,080
Speaker 2:  of this that like beautiful machines did a lot of things right. Really short

1162
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,640
Speaker 2:  battery life.

1163
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,480
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And I mean it's worth noting that well You know my battery life that

1164
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,800
Speaker 14:  I get is only my battery life 'cause I'm testing with my workload. Like

1165
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,480
Speaker 14:  you might get something totally different but I don't know what Google I'm,

1166
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,720
Speaker 14:  I don't know if they're doing video playback like I don't know. I just dunno

1167
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,080
Speaker 14:  how they're, if they're doing one of those things where it's like you turn

1168
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,560
Speaker 14:  off the wifi and you put the screen at like a hundred knits and you turn

1169
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,080
Speaker 14:  off the speakers and you play

1170
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,520
Speaker 2:  A local video file and they're hours

1171
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,280
Speaker 14:  Reverse local video, that also to me is not a good

1172
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,080
Speaker 14:  reflection of how much battery you can expect. So I think my result is

1173
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,920
Speaker 14:  probably a little bit better but I don't claim that it's identical what

1174
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,360
Speaker 14:  you're gonna get.

1175
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,720
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So one thing I thought was interesting about the way Google

1176
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:53,360
Speaker 2:  is approaching this is that if you qualify for the Chromebook Plus

1177
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,960
Speaker 2:  certification, not only do you get the sticker that says this is one of the

1178
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,600
Speaker 2:  good ones, you actually get some more stuff. Like from a software

1179
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,120
Speaker 2:  perspective these things are gonna be better than the lower end

1180
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,120
Speaker 2:  Chromebooks. Right. That surprised me a little bit. Actually part of the

1181
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:10,920
Speaker 2:  appeal of Chrome OSS has been that it's this like very simple straightforward

1182
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,400
Speaker 2:  thing. You can kind of log in anywhere and all of your stuff appears. But

1183
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,680
Speaker 2:  now it seems like Google is starting to say like we're gonna, especially

1184
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:20,360
Speaker 2:  with AI stuff right. Give you more to do on these more powerful

1185
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:20,720
Speaker 2:  machines.

1186
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:24,840
Speaker 14:  Yeah. So the main thing is that there are some AI powered features

1187
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,760
Speaker 14:  which we were told are as of now going to be exclusive to

1188
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:33,040
Speaker 14:  Chromebook Plus devices. I, it seems to me plausible

1189
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,480
Speaker 14:  that they will end up on all Chromebooks eventually.

1190
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:38,120
Speaker 2:  Okay. It's like what they're doing with the Pixels. Like the stuff starts

1191
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,680
Speaker 2:  there and then kind of works its way down through the ecosystem just based

1192
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:44,200
Speaker 14:  On like how I see that they do this kind of thing with Android. Like I don't

1193
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,880
Speaker 14:  know that I would assume like this will never leave the plus line. Yeah.

1194
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:51,680
Speaker 14:  But yeah, there's a magic eraser tool in Google Photos. There

1195
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,760
Speaker 14:  are improvements to lighting and noise cancellation in

1196
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:59,040
Speaker 14:  video conferencing which we got a demonstration of.

1197
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,600
Speaker 14:  And then there's like an offline file sync thing which automatically

1198
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,320
Speaker 14:  downloads stuff from drive onto the device. Oh. Which we also got to see

1199
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:07,760
Speaker 14:  in action

1200
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,920
Speaker 2:  Suddenly 128 gigs seems like not enough that

1201
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,200
Speaker 14:  That was in my re I was like oh I have a lot of stuff in Drive. I don't

1202
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,920
Speaker 14:  know but I assume it's, it's theoretically supposed to like save you from

1203
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,360
Speaker 14:  having to do that if you are someone who would be You know going on and

1204
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,560
Speaker 14:  doing that manually. Well and it's smart

1205
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:26,080
Speaker 2:  'cause Google has fought against this thing for years where the perception

1206
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,440
Speaker 2:  of CR the Chromebook is still, it only works when you're online. Right.

1207
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:32,000
Speaker 14:  And there are lots of people who still think that. Right.

1208
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,360
Speaker 2:  And on the one hand I think that's like a fake fear because like my MacBook

1209
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,880
Speaker 2:  is more or less useless when I'm not online anymore. Like I don't, it

1210
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,440
Speaker 14:  Turns out there's very little you can do without the internet and

1211
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah, exactly. But also Google I think is is smart too. And I remember they

1212
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,840
Speaker 2:  did this with docs and stuff back in the day. They were like, no, you can

1213
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:51,440
Speaker 2:  do this stuff offline. Yeah your computer will be okay.

1214
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:55,160
Speaker 2:  So doing the offline stuff makes a lot of sense to me that that seems smart.

1215
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,600
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And then there are gonna be like AI generated wallpapers,

1216
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,160
Speaker 14:  which you like type in a text prompt and it like generates a wallpaper.

1217
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,320
Speaker 14:  Love it. That's the idea. We didn't get to see that that wasn't ready at

1218
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,960
Speaker 14:  the time. There's a quote unquote personal writing assistant. Oh lord.

1219
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:12,400
Speaker 14:  Very curious. Excited to try that out. I love

1220
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,360
Speaker 14:  to be assisted with my writing so You know I well welcome that

1221
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:20,200
Speaker 14:  tool. And then there's like a three month subscription to Photoshop on the

1222
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,880
Speaker 14:  web and there's like three months of GForce now is priority tier. There's

1223
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,080
Speaker 14:  like a couple things like that where you get some free trials of some stuff

1224
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,120
Speaker 14:  and I mean

1225
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,800
Speaker 2:  That's a decent amount of stuff. That's a, that's a pretty strong push to

1226
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,440
Speaker 2:  buy the better Chromebook. It

1227
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,360
Speaker 14:  Certainly is. It will be interesting to see how long all of those things

1228
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:40,320
Speaker 14:  remain. Yeah. You know plus exclusive before it becomes less

1229
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,680
Speaker 14:  before they sort of trickle down. Yeah. That

1230
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:46,200
Speaker 2:  That's very fair. So I'm curious what you think the

1231
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:49,200
Speaker 2:  manufacturers of Chromebooks are gonna do because like you were saying at

1232
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,800
Speaker 2:  the beginning, all of these hook have been burned by trying to charge a lot

1233
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,560
Speaker 2:  of money even for a very good Chromebook. It just, it has been

1234
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,200
Speaker 2:  hard. I've been out here banging the drum of like a thousand dollars Chromebook

1235
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,880
Speaker 2:  can actually be a really good idea. I think the Pixel book is like one of

1236
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,440
Speaker 2:  the all time best laptops. I still believe that

1237
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,280
Speaker 14:  That was a good one.

1238
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:10,160
Speaker 2:  Most people didn't like I, I grant that I am not most people in that particular

1239
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:14,160
Speaker 2:  way. And so if I am, I don't know Jesus or Samsung or

1240
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,000
Speaker 2:  Lenovo or HP or whoever, I have a lot of experience not selling

1241
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:22,040
Speaker 2:  high end Chromebooks And now Google's out here saying again, sell high end

1242
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,960
Speaker 2:  Chromebooks, it's totally gonna work this time. Do you think they're gonna

1243
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:29,000
Speaker 2:  try, are we gonna get a real pushback to the premium in the Chromebook space

1244
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,040
Speaker 2:  here or has everybody been burned too much by now?

1245
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:34,840
Speaker 14:  From what the evidence that we have so far, and again this is evidence is

1246
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,920
Speaker 14:  highly curated by Google. Sure. Like they You know have decided which ones

1247
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,680
Speaker 14:  they are gonna announce on stage it. It seems like a lot of these

1248
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,680
Speaker 14:  are pretty solidly mid range so far. Okay. The ones that have

1249
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:49,200
Speaker 14:  been announced, the cheapest one I think is, it's 3 99

1250
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,960
Speaker 14:  0.9 which is the Acer Chromebook Plus line. Okay. And then a bunch of the

1251
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,680
Speaker 14:  other ones that were announced were sort of in the like 500

1252
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:00,600
Speaker 14:  $800 range. So these are high end quote unquote

1253
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,440
Speaker 14:  I and Chromebooks and that they're not, they're above the like school laptop

1254
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:08,680
Speaker 14:  cart tier but these are not HP Dragonfly Pro

1255
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,480
Speaker 14:  like $2,000 executive devices. That does not seem to be, I

1256
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:16,080
Speaker 14:  think who they're going for with this label. It seems to me they're more

1257
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,840
Speaker 14:  looking for, these are like parents shopping for their kids or something

1258
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,920
Speaker 14:  and they don't necessarily know anything about specs but they see plus and

1259
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,600
Speaker 14:  they're like oh plus sure. I think that must mean it's good. And I actually

1260
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,360
Speaker 14:  that is similar to how if you look at like what tends to get

1261
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,280
Speaker 14:  certified as Intel evo, they sort of have very specifically targeted that

1262
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:38,120
Speaker 14:  label towards like these are the best like consumer things that you might

1263
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,840
Speaker 14:  buy rather than like we're shoving this at the enthusiasts and

1264
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,520
Speaker 14:  the the enterprise customers.

1265
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:47,480
Speaker 2:  Okay. So yeah it seems like what we're gonna get is likely a lot of things

1266
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:51,360
Speaker 2:  that are right at that minimum spec range, which like you

1267
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,120
Speaker 2:  said for a Chromebook is fine. My initial reaction as soon as you said I

1268
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,920
Speaker 2:  three was to be like that's not enough. But for a lot of Chromebook

1269
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:02,160
Speaker 2:  uses it probably is So is eight gigs of ram. Yeah. So is 128 gigs of storage,

1270
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,840
Speaker 2:  like that's a pretty good Chromebook. Yeah.

1271
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:08,680
Speaker 14:  In my experience at Core I three often flies on Chrome

1272
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:08,960
Speaker 14:  oss.

1273
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,320
Speaker 2:  I think maybe what I need to do is just let go of the idea that I'm ever

1274
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,600
Speaker 2:  gonna get like the really beautiful, perfect,

1275
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:18,600
Speaker 2:  spectacular Chromebook that I want. There

1276
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,960
Speaker 14:  Certainly are some you can try. They they get, they get pretty pricey

1277
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:22,600
Speaker 14:  what's

1278
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,240
Speaker 2:  Like the best one out there If I want like America's fanciest Chromebook

1279
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:26,880
Speaker 2:  in

1280
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:30,400
Speaker 14:  My opinion, which is just my opinion, it is the Asus

1281
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,360
Speaker 14:  Chromebook CX five flip CX five. But that is not, that is actually not

1282
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,200
Speaker 14:  a super, super fancy one. That is just one that I think is really

1283
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:38,560
Speaker 14:  good.

1284
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:42,960
Speaker 2:  Oh this thing looks nice, I just googled this, I'm into this. Okay. It

1285
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,400
Speaker 14:  Is really, really nice and the battery life is so good.

1286
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:50,960
Speaker 14:  That was my experience with that one. But in terms of like one that's actually

1287
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:54,880
Speaker 14:  super like quote unquote luxury, what you wanna try is the h HP Elite

1288
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,720
Speaker 14:  Dragonfly Chromebook or something that's in that line Dragonfly

1289
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:02,760
Speaker 14:  Pro. I think that's like more of a consumer version of

1290
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,720
Speaker 14:  the Elite Drive Fly Chromebook. But the elite Dragonfly Windows laptop

1291
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:10,760
Speaker 14:  is like one of the absolute nicest computers you can buy. It

1292
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:14,640
Speaker 14:  is a business laptop. It is like $4,000. Like it's some crazy price.

1293
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,440
Speaker 14:  The Drive Fly Chromebook is kind of the Chromebook version of that and it

1294
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,320
Speaker 14:  is really, really nice. Yeah,

1295
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,440
Speaker 2:  I love the Dragonfly because it's another one of those like, it's like black

1296
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:26,040
Speaker 2:  on black on black. It's super simple. It reminds me of like the CR

1297
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:29,840
Speaker 2:  48, the very first Chromebook from a million years ago where they just

1298
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:33,240
Speaker 2:  sort of made a black prototype and then shipped it. And I mean that in like

1299
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,320
Speaker 2:  the best possible way. The dragonfly kind of reminds me of that. It's just

1300
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,160
Speaker 2:  like, yeah they didn't try too hard. They're just like here's a cool, it's

1301
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,440
Speaker 2:  like a thing a spy would use in a movie and I appreciate that.

1302
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,880
Speaker 14:  It's very nice. It's really expensive. I, but if you're looking for that,

1303
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,880
Speaker 14:  that's kind of the one that's currently floating around.

1304
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:53,040
Speaker 2:  Okay. Do you think we're gonna get a good push here? Like Chromebooks

1305
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,720
Speaker 2:  had this gigantic spike during the pandemic because everybody bought them

1306
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,080
Speaker 2:  for school, kind of crashed back to Earth over the last couple of years.

1307
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:02,240
Speaker 2:  Is the plus thing gonna work do you think? Like do it, does it have a real

1308
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,760
Speaker 2:  chance of convincing some more people to get Chromebooks?

1309
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,320
Speaker 14:  I imagine that this year it seems like everyone's kind of

1310
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,080
Speaker 14:  doing it like Ace is doing some HP's, doing some

1311
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,080
Speaker 14:  Acer's, doing some, whether that like pushes

1312
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:21,280
Speaker 14:  Chromebook purchases back to where they were in 2020. I think that's probably

1313
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,840
Speaker 14:  unlikely because that was a pretty specific event that pushed the sales

1314
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,640
Speaker 14:  that high. Whether it brings in new customers or whether

1315
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:32,440
Speaker 14:  it just drives the people who would already be buying Chromebooks to instead

1316
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,120
Speaker 14:  buy Chromebook Pluses is sort of hard for me to judge at this point.

1317
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,800
Speaker 14:  I wouldn't be surprised if it's like somewhere in the middle there.

1318
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,280
Speaker 2:  That's a good point. And I think Google in this case is probably smart to

1319
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:46,280
Speaker 2:  look at that sort of four to $600 price range and

1320
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,120
Speaker 2:  be like, we can make some real noise there. 'cause right now, even on the

1321
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,200
Speaker 2:  Windows side, I feel like I start to get really nervous recommending people

1322
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,240
Speaker 2:  computers in that price range because odds are you're making some

1323
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:01,200
Speaker 2:  sort of catastrophic sacrifice, but Chromebooks in most cases are

1324
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,760
Speaker 2:  like cheaper than that. Like substantially cheaper than that in a lot of

1325
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,680
Speaker 2:  ways that people are buying and using and mostly being okay with. So if Google

1326
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:11,800
Speaker 2:  can make like the best $500 laptop and not worry about being the best a

1327
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,320
Speaker 2:  thousand dollars laptop, like I'll be sad, but that's probably better for

1328
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:18,080
Speaker 2:  the actual future of Chromebooks in the long run.

1329
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:21,840
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And I, I think it probably will have the impact of making it easier

1330
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,840
Speaker 14:  for some people to shop without paying more than they need to is what

1331
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,000
Speaker 14:  I'm seeing right now. And that to me seems like a, a good thing. Yeah,

1332
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,160
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. Like the, the laptop world right now is just one sort

1333
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:35,960
Speaker 2:  of relentless upsell until you get to about 1800 bucks and all you walk in

1334
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,360
Speaker 2:  and they just suddenly they just, everything goes up a hundred dollars at

1335
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,440
Speaker 2:  a time until you're like, how did I buy a MacBook Pro? Like that's not right.

1336
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:45,520
Speaker 2:  I here for Adele XPS 13. Like what are we doing here? Yeah, I'm I'm

1337
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,480
Speaker 2:  still sad that I'm not gonna get the like kickass Chromebook. I'm just

1338
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,280
Speaker 2:  mad at Google really for canceling the Pixel book. Do you think that'll ever

1339
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:56,000
Speaker 2:  come back based on nothing? This is based on nothing. Just make me feel better.

1340
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:56,520
Speaker 2:  No,

1341
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,680
Speaker 14:  I mean anything's possible. Yeah. You know there's, there's always a possibility

1342
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,720
Speaker 14:  that in the infinite expanse that it's time something will happen. So I

1343
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,200
Speaker 14:  don't wanna say no, it won't happen. I mean if you wanted me to take the

1344
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,080
Speaker 14:  side of a of, of like a bet here. No. Yeah. I think that when, when you

1345
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,360
Speaker 14:  look at where they went with the Pixel book Go and how much better a response,

1346
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,320
Speaker 14:  it seems like that got, I think if there's another Pixel book, it's closer

1347
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,240
Speaker 14:  to the Pixel book go than it is to like the funky convertible thing

1348
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,800
Speaker 14:  the Pixel book was. But I, that was a very cool product and at the time

1349
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,640
Speaker 14:  I remember when it was like trying to figure out, oh, what's the best Chromebook?

1350
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,840
Speaker 14:  Like that was the obvious 'cause there had been nothing like it before.

1351
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,000
Speaker 14:  Yeah. But that wouldn't really be the case I think if it came out today.

1352
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:36,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, I I think that's right. I hope Google makes another one, but I,

1353
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,880
Speaker 2:  I'm not holding my breath.

1354
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:41,400
Speaker 14:  Make one just for you and bring it to your house and that's

1355
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,320
Speaker 2:  All I want. If there's a prototype lying around somewhere that nobody wants

1356
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,800
Speaker 2:  anymore, just, just sell it to me. I'll take it. I'm, I will happily, happily

1357
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:51,720
Speaker 2:  take whatever Pixel book two exists somewhere in Mountain View. Alright,

1358
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,680
Speaker 2:  I can talk to you about this forever sometime. You're gonna come back on

1359
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,480
Speaker 2:  and we're just gonna talk about Windows apps and Android apps and the connect

1360
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:00,000
Speaker 2:  to phone thing and like all the ways the Chromos almost gets it right and

1361
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,680
Speaker 2:  doesn't quite get there. Oh yeah. But for now we gotta take a break. Monica,

1362
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:03,600
Speaker 2:  thank you as always.

1363
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:04,480
Speaker 14:  Thank you very much.

1364
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:13,540
Speaker 15:  Support for this show comes from Intel. Where do world

1365
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:17,580
Speaker 15:  changing ideas get their start at Intel. It starts with

1366
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:21,020
Speaker 15:  real solutions and real solutions start with

1367
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:24,860
Speaker 15:  exceptional engineering. Empowering those with disabilities

1368
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:28,780
Speaker 15:  starts with assistive AI and discovering new galaxies

1369
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,540
Speaker 15:  starts with supercomputing. The intelligent factory

1370
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,300
Speaker 15:  starts with edge analytics while the sustainable supply chain

1371
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,740
Speaker 15:  starts with open manufacturing. And that's just the start.

1372
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,460
Speaker 15:  The quantum computing revolution, the next generation of AI

1373
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,260
Speaker 15:  experts, the renewable energy grid, liquid cooling, data

1374
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,580
Speaker 15:  centers, early diagnosis for cancer, water

1375
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:55,380
Speaker 15:  restoration, farmland protection, they all start

1376
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:59,260
Speaker 15:  with Intel. The examples are countless, the impacts are

1377
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:02,660
Speaker 15:  endless, but the foundation is always the same.

1378
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,380
Speaker 15:  It starts with Intel. Learn more at Intel dot com

Speaker 15:  slash stories

1380
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:20,950
Speaker 2:  All. right. We're back. Let's get to a question from The Vergecast Hotline

1381
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:24,470
Speaker 2:  as we do on the show every week. As a reminder, the Hotline number is

1382
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:28,150
Speaker 2:  8 6 6 Verge one one. And truly,

1383
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:31,390
Speaker 2:  I love all of the weird questions you've been sending us. We've been getting

1384
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:35,270
Speaker 2:  some really fun, really wonky ones recently. Thank

1385
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,790
Speaker 2:  you for everything you've been calling and asking about and if you don't

1386
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:41,790
Speaker 2:  wanna call, you can always email us Vergecast at The Verge dot com. That

1387
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:45,470
Speaker 2:  works just as well. Thank you again to everyone who's been emailing and calling

1388
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:48,230
Speaker 2:  super fun times on the Hotline. Our question today comes from Tyler.

1389
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:52,990
Speaker 16:  Hey David, this is Tyler. Hey, I was just thinking back to

1390
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:57,270
Speaker 16:  this maybe blog post or something that went viral in the late two

1391
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:01,230
Speaker 16:  thousands and it was all about how to use iTunes to create custom

1392
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:04,790
Speaker 16:  playlists. You know we sort of forget about this, but iTunes had so much

1393
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:08,750
Speaker 16:  data baked into it and so many fields where we could add our own data to

1394
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:12,270
Speaker 16:  it. I feel like me and everybody else I knew, we all rated our songs, we

1395
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:15,630
Speaker 16:  had custom genres and you could tell iTunes,

1396
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:19,990
Speaker 16:  Hey, please make me a playlist with everything I've

1397
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:23,670
Speaker 16:  rated three stars or higher that I've not listened to in the past

1398
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,710
Speaker 16:  four months. And then maybe mix in with that music that I have bought in

1399
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:31,590
Speaker 16:  the past two months that I have not rated yet. And it was just this great

1400
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:35,710
Speaker 16:  way to kind of control what you're listening to. And I just feel so sad

1401
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:39,550
Speaker 16:  that You know with most of the streaming services, like none of that

1402
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:43,190
Speaker 16:  control is there anymore. And I'm just so curious if

1403
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:47,310
Speaker 16:  anybody in that streaming world thinks that there's an appetite

1404
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:51,190
Speaker 16:  for people that care about organizing their music and being kind of a

1405
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:54,350
Speaker 16:  music nerd about it. Anyway, thank you so much. Love the show. Bye.

1406
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:58,830
Speaker 2:  Okay, I love this question because I think Tyler, like a lot of

1407
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:02,790
Speaker 2:  us at The Verge and also all The Vergecast family, were a lot of

1408
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:06,520
Speaker 2:  like music nerds and metadata nerds. And so the idea of like, I would like

1409
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,520
Speaker 2:  to go in and type in a lot of information about all of my songs so that I

1410
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,800
Speaker 2:  can do things with, it just feels right to me. I have two things to say about

1411
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,680
Speaker 2:  this. The first is just a frankly hard truth about the way that

1412
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,560
Speaker 2:  the world works. Most people, Tyler, do not want the thing

1413
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,480
Speaker 2:  that you described. I agree that that's unfortunate. I agree that there are

1414
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:27,960
Speaker 2:  lots of people out there who do want that and would like to have more control

1415
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,400
Speaker 2:  over their music. But we've been in this phase really for the last decade

1416
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:35,480
Speaker 2:  where the idea of having your own music collection

1417
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:39,680
Speaker 2:  with You know things that you've ripped from CDs and stuff that you've downloaded

1418
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:43,600
Speaker 2:  and this sort of carefully curated beautiful library of stuff is

1419
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,840
Speaker 2:  just a dying art. There are people out there who do it and there are lots

1420
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,480
Speaker 2:  of great apps out there, particularly on iOS. There are some really good

1421
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:54,800
Speaker 2:  local music playing apps that actually give you some of the stuff that you're

1422
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,240
Speaker 2:  talking about. But in general, that's a dying behavior. People want these

1423
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:02,120
Speaker 2:  algorithmically generated playlists. They want to use things like new music

1424
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,800
Speaker 2:  Friday and release radar to discover new music. People wanna

1425
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:09,760
Speaker 2:  find all the stuff without all the work. And that is what I've been hearing

1426
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,720
Speaker 2:  from streaming services for years, that the idea of building a library of

1427
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,360
Speaker 2:  music is just a dying art. I think that's sad. I wonder if it'll come back

1428
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,080
Speaker 2:  around. But I think asking any of these streaming services to

1429
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:25,040
Speaker 2:  invest in that is just probably not gonna happen at least for the next

1430
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,720
Speaker 2:  few years. Maybe that'll change. Vinyl is coming back in a big way. This

1431
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,480
Speaker 2:  sense of ownership is coming back in a lot of ways in media I think

1432
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,960
Speaker 2:  because things move around a lot and things come and go and the idea of like

1433
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,120
Speaker 2:  I want to have a collection that is mine, I think is kind of coming back

1434
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:43,160
Speaker 2:  so maybe it'll get better, but for now I would not hold my breath but

1435
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,520
Speaker 2:  I have better news, which is that I think AI is going to go

1436
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,520
Speaker 2:  a long way towards solving part of what you're asking for. I think

1437
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:55,240
Speaker 2:  being able to say, I have input all this data about what I like And, what

1438
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,080
Speaker 2:  these songs are and stuff, probably not gonna happen. But the thing about

1439
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,560
Speaker 2:  a service like Spotify is that it has a ton of that

1440
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:06,680
Speaker 2:  metadata about these songs. It knows the style of the songs, the style

1441
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,240
Speaker 2:  of the singing, how much guitar there is, how much piano there is, what the

1442
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,880
Speaker 2:  B p m is, And, what Spotify it has been

1443
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,040
Speaker 2:  reported and revealed is working on is basically a way to

1444
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:22,000
Speaker 2:  use AI prompts to generate these kinds of playlists. So

1445
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,720
Speaker 2:  you could say, I want music with You know this genre

1446
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,720
Speaker 2:  and this kind of singer and a twangy guitar that is under four minutes

1447
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:33,880
Speaker 2:  and 108 beats per minute. That is also good to listen to

1448
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:37,800
Speaker 2:  by the pool and it will just make you that playlist. I have no idea how

1449
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:41,560
Speaker 2:  good it will be. As we've seen with a lot of these chatbots, it's kind of

1450
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:45,280
Speaker 2:  iffy in a lot of ways. And I actually just recently talked to Gusav Soderstrom

1451
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,680
Speaker 2:  who's the president at Spotify and has been working on all of this stuff

1452
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:52,640
Speaker 2:  for years. He's very into the idea that AI can

1453
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:56,200
Speaker 2:  be a way to filter and sort and search through and discover

1454
01:25:56,540 --> 01:26:00,040
Speaker 2:  new music. That's a big thing Spotify is investing in. You see it already

1455
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:03,840
Speaker 2:  with things like the day list playlist, which is this sort of endlessly changing

1456
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:07,280
Speaker 2:  set of songs depending on what time of day it is And, what mood you're in,

1457
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:10,760
Speaker 2:  And, what you like to listen to at certain times. So not only does Spotify

1458
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:14,200
Speaker 2:  have this access to this sort of huge corpus of music,

1459
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:18,640
Speaker 2:  but also it knows what you listen to and when And what you like

1460
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,880
Speaker 2:  and when you listen to it. And for me in particular, I've been a Spotify

1461
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:25,840
Speaker 2:  user for like 12 years now and it knows more about

1462
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,400
Speaker 2:  my music taste frankly than I do, especially how it's changed over time.

1463
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,960
Speaker 2:  So the idea that not only could it take all of its knowledge about music,

1464
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:36,760
Speaker 2:  but all of its knowledge about me and put it into this system where I can

1465
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:40,280
Speaker 2:  just query, like play me songs that I really liked

1466
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:44,560
Speaker 2:  in 2006, like last time I went through a

1467
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,600
Speaker 2:  breakup, what songs did I listen to, right? Like all this stuff is out there

1468
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:51,360
Speaker 2:  and findable. And one of the cool things about a lot of the AI tools that

1469
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,160
Speaker 2:  we've seen is when you really constrain it down and instead of just saying

1470
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:58,000
Speaker 2:  all of the information in the world, you say music or movie

1471
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,880
Speaker 2:  recommendations or whatever, it won't always be perfect, but it's much more

1472
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,320
Speaker 2:  likely to actually put you in sort of a useful interesting place

1473
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:09,120
Speaker 2:  with some of these tools. So I think that is potentially very exciting. I

1474
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,240
Speaker 2:  know it doesn't solve your whole problem of being able to say, play me everything

1475
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:15,120
Speaker 2:  that I've rated three stars, but maybe we get to a point where you can say,

1476
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:19,360
Speaker 2:  make me a playlist of songs I've listened to more than 25 times. That's a

1477
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,880
Speaker 2:  cool idea. And would essentially gin up all of the things you've been obsessed

1478
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,080
Speaker 2:  with over the years. So I'm hopeful that we're actually gonna get a lot of

1479
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,840
Speaker 2:  what you're talking about even though we, the users are not going to have

1480
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:33,440
Speaker 2:  quite as much control over it as I think you would like Tyler. And I would

1481
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:37,040
Speaker 2:  like also, we'll see what Spotify launches and I think a lot of other companies

1482
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,840
Speaker 2:  are gonna follow, but I am sort of fascinated by that. And also my interview

1483
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:44,320
Speaker 2:  with Gustav is going to be on The Vergecast sometime in the next couple of

1484
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,960
Speaker 2:  weeks and we talk about AI and playlists and lots of other stuff. So

1485
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:49,040

1486
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:51,680
