Description: The Verge's Victoria Song joins the show to talk about her year of testing smart rings, and which of the many new options is the one you should buy. Then Chris Welch takes us through his testing of the new hearing health features for Apple's AirPods, including the surprisingly intense hearing test you can take right on your phone. Finally, Andrew Webster helps us answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline: why doesn't Apple buy Nintendo, and what would happen if it did?

00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:06,555
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of decades

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:10,355
Speaker 1:  of listening to music. Too loud in your headphones. I'm your friend David Pierce

4
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:14,555
Speaker 1:  and I am sitting here at my computer doing what I call a feeds

5
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:17,155
Speaker 1:  reboot. I think I've talked about this on the show before, but basically

6
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:21,035
Speaker 1:  once a year I try to go through and just take all

7
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:24,995
Speaker 1:  the stuff out of every single feed or thing that I subscribe

8
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:28,635
Speaker 1:  to on the internet and I define that super loosely, So I. Try to go through

9
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:33,075
Speaker 1:  all the people I follow on every social platform I go through, all the

10
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,755
Speaker 1:  email newsletters I subscribe to, I go through all the email newsletters

11
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:39,715
Speaker 1:  I never subscribe to but am somehow on the list for all the channels I follow

12
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:43,515
Speaker 1:  on YouTube, all the podcasts I subscribe to. Anything that just puts

13
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:46,955
Speaker 1:  an ongoing list of stuff in front of me at any given time.

14
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:50,835
Speaker 1:  Once a year I try to go through it all, look at every single source that

15
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:54,395
Speaker 1:  stuff is coming from and get rid of all the stuff I don't want anymore. Over

16
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:57,955
Speaker 1:  the course of a year, you just become like a different person with different

17
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:01,835
Speaker 1:  interests and a lot of the sources you care about get better or worse

18
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:05,795
Speaker 1:  or more relevant or less relevant. And once a year to just go

19
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:09,555
Speaker 1:  through the whole list is really helpful. It's super boring

20
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:13,155
Speaker 1:  frankly, and kind of tedious because most of these platforms don't make it

21
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:16,235
Speaker 1:  easy to go through and sort of systematically unfollow things.

22
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:20,995
Speaker 1:  But it's so helpful. I cannot recommend it enough. I try to like put on

23
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:24,715
Speaker 1:  a movie I've seen before or just a bunch of episodes of the office in a row

24
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:27,835
Speaker 1:  or when the weather's nice, I'll go like sit at a coffee shop and just over

25
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:31,395
Speaker 1:  the course of an afternoon burn through all of the feeds that I have.

26
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:35,715
Speaker 1:  I find this actually most useful in an RSS reader where there's tons

27
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:39,635
Speaker 1:  of things that like change a bunch or publish too much or publish

28
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:43,035
Speaker 1:  not enough or go outta business or whatever. And going through and doing

29
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:46,755
Speaker 1:  a full reset of all the stuff that is being pushed at me is so helpful.

30
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:50,995
Speaker 1:  Highly recommend it. Again, not a lot of fun, but totally worth it

31
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:55,435
Speaker 1:  Anyway. One thing you should not unsubscribe to by the way, is The

32
00:01:55,555 --> 00:01:59,035
Speaker 1:  Vergecast. This is a very good podcast. I hope we're doing our best

33
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:02,235
Speaker 1:  and we have a super fun show coming up today actually, we're gonna talk about

34
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:05,595
Speaker 1:  two things. First, we're gonna talk about smart rings because I think smart

35
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:09,115
Speaker 1:  rings are really interesting and this has been in a certain way kind of the

36
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:12,155
Speaker 1:  year of the Smart Ring. We've gotten a bunch of new entrants, we've gotten

37
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:15,435
Speaker 1:  new models from some of the companies that have been doing this a while.

38
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:19,915
Speaker 1:  Vong has tested everything there is to test and has some thoughts, so we're

39
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:22,995
Speaker 1:  gonna talk about it. We're also gonna talk about the hearing health features

40
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:26,835
Speaker 1:  on the new AirPods Pro two, which I think are actually pretty

41
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:30,955
Speaker 1:  cool and exciting, but are also big promises

42
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:34,475
Speaker 1:  from a company like Apple promising that your AirPods can act as a hearing

43
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:38,355
Speaker 1:  aid and really make a difference in how you hear and operate in the

44
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:41,555
Speaker 1:  world. If that stuff works, it's awesome and there should be more like it,

45
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:44,595
Speaker 1:  but we're gonna see if it works. Chris Welch has been testing it. He knows

46
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,995
Speaker 1:  the answer. We also have a really fun question on The Vergecast hotline.

47
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:51,475
Speaker 1:  So much stuff to do. But. first I have to finish this

48
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,915
Speaker 1:  feeds reboot. I normally do it in the summer, but this year just couldn't

49
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:58,595
Speaker 1:  make myself sit down and do it. And now I'm doing it. I'm in it. I'm getting

50
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,925
Speaker 1:  it done. It's gonna be awesome. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right

51
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:51,375
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. All right, my podcasts have been pruned.

52
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,735
Speaker 1:  The RSS reader is just humming. Everything

53
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,135
Speaker 1:  is great. Let's get into it. So the first thing we're gonna talk about today

54
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:02,855
Speaker 1:  is smart rings. I don't wear a smart ring,

55
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:07,055
Speaker 1:  but I'm fascinated by them because for years now they have

56
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:10,975
Speaker 1:  been this really interesting device kind of trying to figure out what it's

57
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:14,895
Speaker 1:  for. You wear it on your finger, which gives it access to some really interesting

58
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,175
Speaker 1:  biometric data. You also typically wear it all the time because it's a

59
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,815
Speaker 1:  ring and it's unobtrusive and you just can wear it all the time. So in theory,

60
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:25,895
Speaker 1:  it has access to all this interesting information about you and the ability

61
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:29,855
Speaker 1:  to do all kinds of interesting stuff. But it's a tiny gadget

62
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:33,975
Speaker 1:  with a tiny battery and not that much literal physical room to

63
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:37,535
Speaker 1:  do stuff. So how do you make a smart ring that's good. And what does it even

64
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:41,495
Speaker 1:  mean to make one? That's good. Like I said, I don't

65
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:45,295
Speaker 1:  wear a smart ring, but V song does. She actually wore six, like for

66
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:49,135
Speaker 1:  months to do a test to see what the best one is. And I wanted to have her

67
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:53,055
Speaker 1:  on both to see what she learned and whether she figured out

68
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:56,775
Speaker 1:  what a smart ring is really for. So let's just get into it. V.

69
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:57,335
Speaker 1:  Hello.

70
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:58,855
Speaker 4:  Thanks for having me.

71
00:04:59,405 --> 00:04:59,895
Speaker 1:  Gadgets.

72
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:01,335
Speaker 4:  So many gadgets.

73
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:04,375
Speaker 1:  We just, we talk about watches, we talk about rings, we talk about things

74
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:08,295
Speaker 1:  on your face. This is just what we do. You wear things and look ridiculous

75
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:10,975
Speaker 1:  in public and then I ask you about it. This is, this is our lives. Yeah,

76
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:15,015
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This is, you know, it's a burden I'm willing to take. So no one else

77
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:15,855
Speaker 4:  has to look stupid.

78
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:20,135
Speaker 1:  It's beautiful. We appreciate it. So the, the thing I mostly want to talk

79
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:24,055
Speaker 1:  about, I confess, is the new Aura ring a device I have been

80
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:28,215
Speaker 1:  fascinated by for a very long time, and both think is very interesting and

81
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:30,735
Speaker 1:  not nearly as interesting as it should be. But we're gonna get to that

82
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:36,015
Speaker 1:  first, I think I wanna talk about this, this battle royale of smart rings

83
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,895
Speaker 1:  that you did and put yourself through some true like

84
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:44,215
Speaker 1:  a summer's worth of pain in order to pull up. So

85
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:47,135
Speaker 1:  first, just like lay the stakes of this experiment for me. 'cause I think

86
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:51,135
Speaker 1:  to some extent, like most people, even most people listening to this have

87
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:54,535
Speaker 1:  never given one second of thought to a smart ring in their whole lives. So

88
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:57,925
Speaker 1:  I'm very curious like how you go through the process of picking the best

89
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,725
Speaker 1:  one and wearing six of them at a time.

90
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:04,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah, So I decided that I was gonna wear six smart rings

91
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:08,685
Speaker 4:  all at the same time for about, I wanna say

92
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:12,925
Speaker 4:  two, about two and a half, three months earlier the summer. Which

93
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:14,085
Speaker 1:  Six fingers by the way?

94
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:18,725
Speaker 4:  No, no pinky, no thumb. Okay. Because those are, you know, two

95
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,485
Speaker 4:  extremes. So just the middle three.

96
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,285
Speaker 1:  So you did like, you did a brass knuckles

97
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:27,245
Speaker 4:  Basically? I did, I did. I was a smart ring mafia wife. I love this for

98
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:31,165
Speaker 4:  you. Okay. For, for a solid three months. Ended up with six ring

99
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:34,845
Speaker 4:  pants over the summer, despite all my best efforts at

100
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:37,205
Speaker 4:  sunscreen, it just happened.

101
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:41,525
Speaker 1:  You must look like you had some like unknowable disease just

102
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:43,205
Speaker 1:  to have six ring tans.

103
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:47,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah, they've, they've somewhat faded now because the experiment is

104
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:50,405
Speaker 4:  over. I declared a winner, but yeah, so you know,

105
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:55,205
Speaker 4:  it, this idea actually popped into my head a

106
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:59,205
Speaker 4:  few months before the summer because I knew that the Samsung Galaxy

107
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:02,725
Speaker 4:  ring was coming and that in order to review that

108
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:07,485
Speaker 4:  I needed to know about the entire landscape. But, you

109
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:11,445
Speaker 4:  know, I didn't wanna subject all of our readers to a bunch

110
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:14,845
Speaker 4:  of little smart ring reviews as I was testing stuff. So

111
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:18,725
Speaker 4:  what I ended up doing was taking a look at the market, what was currently

112
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:21,645
Speaker 4:  available was coming out and I decided

113
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,365
Speaker 4:  let's do this gauntlet where I test all of them at the same time

114
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,085
Speaker 4:  and tell you which is the best at being a smart ring.

115
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:31,565
Speaker 1:  Can I tell you what's interesting about that to me, by the way, and this

116
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:34,645
Speaker 1:  is, we're we're just, I'm just diving into the results before I even let

117
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,365
Speaker 1:  you finish your question. But the thing that was so striking to me was that

118
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:40,325
Speaker 1:  a, there were six of these, which I would not have guessed, that there were

119
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,405
Speaker 1:  like six actual viable competitors here and

120
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,725
Speaker 1:  how much the same all six of these are

121
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:51,285
Speaker 1:  in sort of what they are and what they are trying to be like,

122
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:55,965
Speaker 1:  God help you having to review this six times in a row. It's like,

123
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:59,965
Speaker 1:  it's like I feel for the people who have to like review the, the

124
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:03,765
Speaker 1:  $500 Android phones because they're just all the same

125
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:08,005
Speaker 1:  and, and at some point it's really helpful to be like, okay, these are basically

126
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:11,725
Speaker 1:  all the same. Let's run through the like narrow ways in which they are different.

127
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:15,085
Speaker 1:  But even just reading through the thing, I was surprised at how few

128
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:19,685
Speaker 1:  sort of differences in ideas these six things had.

129
00:08:20,155 --> 00:08:23,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So when Smart Rings first were a thing like 10 years ago or so,

130
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:27,725
Speaker 4:  there were a lot of ideas as to what a smart ring could be.

131
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:31,445
Speaker 4:  You had something like Ringly and Motive

132
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:35,325
Speaker 4:  Ringly was just a big fashion thing that didn't do too much.

133
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:39,245
Speaker 4:  Very unobtrusive, but just really there for people who wanted something fashionable

134
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:42,445
Speaker 4:  that could also track stuff. And then you had Motive, which had some really

135
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:46,205
Speaker 4:  big ideas about two factor authentication in a Smart Ring

136
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:50,485
Speaker 4:  and Oh that's right, fitness tracking on top of that, you know, at

137
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:54,245
Speaker 4:  some point before they shuttered they were like, we're gonna be able to authenticate

138
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,525
Speaker 4:  you based on your your gate. So there was a lot of weird, interesting ideas.

139
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:01,405
Speaker 4:  But the one ring that survived that first iteration of

140
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:05,285
Speaker 4:  Smart Rings was the Aura Ring. And so this second class batch

141
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:09,365
Speaker 4:  of that had came after it. In many ways they're just trying to

142
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:13,285
Speaker 4:  do what the Aura Ring got successful at

143
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:17,725
Speaker 4:  with a Twist, right? So that's what I came up

144
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:21,445
Speaker 4:  against with a lot of these competitors. I too was surprised

145
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:26,125
Speaker 4:  at CES this year when I went, I went, oh my God, why are there like

146
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:29,725
Speaker 4:  a half a dozen smart rings out there? I guess

147
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:34,045
Speaker 4:  this popped up and has been a thing. Okay,

148
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:38,365
Speaker 4:  cool. I guess. And then, you know, the really big impetus was Samsung coming

149
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:41,965
Speaker 4:  out in February going like, Hey, we're getting in on Smart

150
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,805
Speaker 4:  Rings. And So I found myself in a situation where it was, okay,

151
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:49,085
Speaker 4:  we, we gotta do a deep dive into this and see, because

152
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:53,565
Speaker 4:  Samsung's big Samsung, Samsung, if they were successful in

153
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:57,405
Speaker 4:  Smart Rings, you know, that had an opportunity to get other

154
00:09:57,545 --> 00:10:00,285
Speaker 4:  big tech to maybe copy them. So

155
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:05,405
Speaker 4:  that, that was the whole thought process behind it. And it was, it

156
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,885
Speaker 4:  was real fun to just go through all of them and go like, oh,

157
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:12,565
Speaker 4:  you have ideas, but they are not even a quarter baked.

158
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:16,645
Speaker 4:  Forget half baked, you are y you know, If, you watch Great

159
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:20,285
Speaker 4:  British Bake off. And Paul Hollywood goes and he goes, oh this is

160
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:23,125
Speaker 4:  underdone. That there were some, there were some

161
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:27,885
Speaker 4:  rings that were, oh this is, this is extremely underdone.

162
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:32,885
Speaker 4:  It was the circular ring slim that was my least favorite of the bunch. It

163
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:36,685
Speaker 4:  just did not do what was supposed to do. It felt really cheap on the

164
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:39,885
Speaker 4:  finger. They have since reached out to me since I wrote this and they're

165
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:42,165
Speaker 4:  like, we addressed some of the issues and

166
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:46,525
Speaker 1:  Which is the story we hear all the time. All the time. And is often not

167
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:46,845
Speaker 1:  the case.

168
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:50,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Often not the case. But like one of the things they said they

169
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:54,565
Speaker 4:  addressed was the fact that this is, this was the only smart ring that had

170
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:58,365
Speaker 4:  a haptic motor in it. So I had high hopes because it, it's a

171
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:02,005
Speaker 4:  smart ring that has ideas about what the smart part of a smart ring should

172
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:05,925
Speaker 4:  be. That haptic alarm was just the nightmare.

173
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,765
Speaker 4:  'cause you had to tap above a very imperceptible, hard to see logo.

174
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:13,925
Speaker 4:  And I just ended up smacking my hand most mornings being very frustrated

175
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:17,285
Speaker 4:  why this thing wouldn't stop buzzing. They said, you can just tap the ring

176
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:21,485
Speaker 4:  anywhere now and it's fine. And we'll see. We'll see. Yeah,

177
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:26,005
Speaker 1:  I confessed that is one use case I think could be very cool. I, I honestly

178
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:29,885
Speaker 1:  like the whole reason I wear the Apple watch to bed is

179
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:33,885
Speaker 1:  to use it as an alarm. I just think it's a nicer thing to wake up to, especially

180
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:37,285
Speaker 1:  when you sleep next to someone than having like a big loud alarm. So the

181
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:40,125
Speaker 1:  idea of being able to do that on a ring and not have to wear the watch. Super

182
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:44,845
Speaker 1:  interesting and exciting to me. Also, neither of the options

183
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:48,765
Speaker 1:  you just described sound like good, useful, reliable ones. So

184
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:52,045
Speaker 1:  remains to be seen. Also, we've already talked too much about the circular

185
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:55,885
Speaker 1:  stem, but notably neither circular nor slim, that's all I'm

186
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:59,805
Speaker 4:  Gonna say. Notably, no, and it's, it was the least comfortable

187
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:03,725
Speaker 4:  of all of them. It felt 3D printed and that just was kind of

188
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:08,155
Speaker 4:  ha not cool. I, I was on Reddit and in some of the circular

189
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:11,915
Speaker 4:  forums and there, there were a lot of angry people on there just because

190
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:15,875
Speaker 4:  there's just a, a bunch of really cool ideas, but

191
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:20,395
Speaker 4:  very underdone in terms of execution. So that was very easy to

192
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:23,955
Speaker 4:  eliminate as like straight off from the get go. It was like, no,

193
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:26,035
Speaker 4:  you, sorry, you are not the best.

194
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,395
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The next one, I think you probably had a harder time getting rid of

195
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,835
Speaker 1:  if, knowing the little bit I knew about this research process, I'm guessing

196
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:34,715
Speaker 1:  this was a harder one.

197
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:38,875
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I really have enjoyed the EV ring. I've

198
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:42,795
Speaker 4:  been talking to the company behind it ano for years because they just

199
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:47,075
Speaker 4:  were really gung-ho about the FDA clearance process. So that kind of sets

200
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:50,835
Speaker 4:  them apart in terms of accuracy. They had a very

201
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:54,875
Speaker 4:  interesting idea in terms of design. It has an open gap at the top, which

202
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:59,075
Speaker 4:  I, I will say one of the most frustrating things about smart

203
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:02,955
Speaker 4:  rings is sizing. Smart watches have bands.

204
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,995
Speaker 4:  You can adjust them. It's very easy to adjust them. Smart

205
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:10,635
Speaker 4:  rings less so because it's on your finger. They're not adjustable.

206
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:15,315
Speaker 4:  There's a lot of tech inside, so you can't get them resized. You just have

207
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:19,035
Speaker 4:  to get the right size that fits you. And what

208
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:23,015
Speaker 4:  most people don't realize is that you bloat you have, you

209
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:26,855
Speaker 4:  have a lot of pasta one night or the temperature rises, your fingers

210
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:31,135
Speaker 4:  swell. So, you know, it can be very hard to get these rings off,

211
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:35,455
Speaker 4:  especially, you know, they're, you're supposed to wear smart rings on

212
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:39,415
Speaker 4:  your index finger, that's gonna be the most accurate. But, you know, maybe

213
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:43,295
Speaker 4:  that's just not in the cards for you. Maybe you want the to wear be

214
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,845
Speaker 4:  worn on the middle finger or the ring finger. So, you know,

215
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:51,165
Speaker 4:  just it can, it can change the size that you need. Right. And

216
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,485
Speaker 4:  you could gain weight. You could lose weight. That will also change how a

217
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:58,325
Speaker 4:  ring fits on you. Not so much of an issue with the ring because

218
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:02,205
Speaker 4:  of that open gap design is always very easy to take off. It's very comfortable

219
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:05,925
Speaker 4:  to wear. I thought that was really clever. It looked

220
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:09,805
Speaker 4:  so nice. I it was so pretty. But it's, it's a first

221
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:13,525
Speaker 4:  gen product and it had some very first gen

222
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:17,645
Speaker 4:  quirks and again, this, this is gonna be a theme with some of the, the

223
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:21,285
Speaker 4:  rings on this list, they have gone and they said we have addressed

224
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:24,205
Speaker 4:  some of the feedback since the first run.

225
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:29,125
Speaker 4:  So yeah, we will see how, how that, how that goes going on. But,

226
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:33,205
Speaker 4:  you know, I really loved the hardware design, but

227
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:36,765
Speaker 4:  it's not just the hardware that matters. If you're using it as a fitness

228
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:40,325
Speaker 4:  tracker, the, the software, how that data is presented to you

229
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:44,405
Speaker 4:  also matters. and there was just some quirks here that I'm hoping will get

230
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:47,405
Speaker 4:  smoothed over in a second iteration.

231
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:51,655
Speaker 1:  Yeah, agreed. You, I think my, my only gripe with this

232
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:54,855
Speaker 1:  part of your piece was that I think you,

233
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,455
Speaker 1:  if anything undersold how much better looking this thing is than every other

234
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:02,935
Speaker 1:  one of the competition. Like it really is. Yeah. You, you could put the six

235
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,415
Speaker 1:  of them next to each other and it would be the other five in one bucket and

236
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:10,375
Speaker 1:  then this one on its own, right? Like it is, it is, yeah. A full like order

237
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:14,375
Speaker 1:  of magnitude more stylish and attractive than the others.

238
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:19,125
Speaker 1:  So like kudos that doesn't get you anywhere.

239
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:22,765
Speaker 1:  Like, you know that, that and a nickel will buy you a Coke, but

240
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:27,685
Speaker 1:  it, it's, that's a cool, interesting start. Right? And you ran

241
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:31,165
Speaker 1:  into one of my favorite things about first gen products, which is

242
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:35,725
Speaker 1:  my pet theory forever has been that If you make a product and it's hard to

243
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:39,565
Speaker 1:  update the firmware. Your product probably sucks. It's just, it's a real,

244
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:43,525
Speaker 1:  like the, the tiny details that matter, right?

245
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,085
Speaker 1:  Like If, you haven't fixed that. There are probably other things that you

246
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:50,245
Speaker 1:  haven't paid attention to and this is one of those

247
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:53,565
Speaker 1:  things, but it gives me great hope that there are a lot of things that Evie

248
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:57,485
Speaker 1:  can go get right that are easier than making nice looking hardware. And

249
00:15:57,585 --> 00:16:00,405
Speaker 1:  if it does those things that could be very compelling.

250
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:04,125
Speaker 4:  I I have a, I have a bit of faith in the company because I've talked to their

251
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:08,285
Speaker 4:  CEOA bunch of times and this is a dude who is very well versed in the

252
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:12,085
Speaker 4:  medical space and what it takes to make a FDA cleared

253
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:16,005
Speaker 4:  product. So I, I I generally give that a lot of credit because

254
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:20,005
Speaker 4:  it takes a certain level of dedication and resources to

255
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:24,325
Speaker 4:  go that route to begin with. So, you know, I I

256
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:27,925
Speaker 4:  wanted to give them a little more, you know, cut them some slack, but you

257
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:31,365
Speaker 4:  know, th this is a battle royale, we can't be too nice. So they

258
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:35,165
Speaker 4:  unfortunately were kicked out second. Yeah, fair. And yeah.

259
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:37,965
Speaker 1:  All right, we're gonna skip over the next one, which is the ring con because

260
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,085
Speaker 1:  you barely even talked about it's fine. You're like, fine, this thing is

261
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:43,925
Speaker 1:  thoroughly fine, who cares? Moving on. So this thing is fine. Who cares?

262
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:47,805
Speaker 1:  Moving on. The next one was the Galaxy Ring. I will say,

263
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:52,045
Speaker 1:  I would've guessed probably those first three would've been the first three

264
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:55,165
Speaker 1:  you would've gotten rid of. This was the first one that surprised me that

265
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:57,365
Speaker 1:  it went here. Tell me why. Yeah,

266
00:16:57,665 --> 00:17:00,685
Speaker 4:  The hardware's great. I think it actually has the best hardware. It's the

267
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:04,565
Speaker 4:  slimmest, it's the most comfortable to wear besides the EV ring. But you,

268
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:08,445
Speaker 4:  you know what, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. And at the time it

269
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,125
Speaker 4:  had the largest size range. It no longer does, but

270
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:16,805
Speaker 4:  it just doesn't stand alone. The thing about the

271
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:20,965
Speaker 4:  Galaxy ring on its own is that it

272
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:24,885
Speaker 4:  doesn't do a whole lot. It's a fitness tracker. It, it,

273
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:28,885
Speaker 4:  it's an okay fitness tracker. The battery life will

274
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:31,925
Speaker 4:  be better If, you get it with a Galaxy Watch because it does like some smart

275
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,165
Speaker 4:  sensor trade off as to like, which one's gonna be more accurate. And that

276
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:37,005
Speaker 4:  bore out in my testing, which

277
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:40,165
Speaker 1:  Is super cool by the way, like as a, it's very cool as an ecosystem play.

278
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:44,075
Speaker 1:  I actually think that's really clever. But it does, like if

279
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:47,435
Speaker 1:  you're, if you're narrowing it down to only people who have Samsung phones

280
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:51,085
Speaker 1:  and narrowing it down again to only people who have Galaxy watches, you've

281
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:54,365
Speaker 1:  like, the number of people who get the best version of this product is just

282
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:54,885
Speaker 1:  very small.

283
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,005
Speaker 4:  It's very small. And then If, you have the newest

284
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,325
Speaker 1:  And you've already spent a ton of money. Like

285
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:04,565
Speaker 4:  If, you have the newest right. Smart, ah, Samsung Galaxy Flip

286
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,605
Speaker 4:  six or the fold six, you know, you can also use it as

287
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,885
Speaker 4:  a pinchy pinch, gesture control for certain things on the phone. And that's

288
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:15,365
Speaker 4:  something they're interested in expanding. Very cool idea. Yep.

289
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:19,645
Speaker 4:  Awesome. In terms of ecosystem play, If you, you know,

290
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:23,765
Speaker 4:  can stomach ecosystems as, as a thing that we're being locked into,

291
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:28,165
Speaker 4:  but okay, so you're gonna buy the, the fold six,

292
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:32,325
Speaker 4:  you're gonna buy a Galaxy Watch on top of that and you're gonna buy a

293
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:35,925
Speaker 4:  smart ring. There's no discount bundle for getting all three of those things

294
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:40,085
Speaker 4:  together. You are spending over $2,000 at this point, close

295
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:43,965
Speaker 4:  to $3,000. It doesn't matter if there's no

296
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:48,165
Speaker 4:  subscription because you've just paid Samsung $3,000

297
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:52,245
Speaker 4:  to get the full benefit range of this Samsung

298
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:56,565
Speaker 4:  Galaxy ring. And then also it is very much tied to

299
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,965
Speaker 4:  the Android ecosystem only. So, you know,

300
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:04,085
Speaker 4:  I'm sure I, I got so many angry Samsung people

301
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:08,565
Speaker 4:  by eliminating it this early. And don't get me wrong, it's a great

302
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:12,485
Speaker 4:  little ring. I love the little charging case. I think the hardware is really

303
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:16,565
Speaker 4:  excellent, but you shouldn't have to pay $3,000

304
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:20,605
Speaker 4:  to get the full range of what it can do.

305
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:24,645
Speaker 4:  It's full to unlock its full potential. Like in some ways weighing

306
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:28,525
Speaker 4:  that cost versus a subscription. Yeah. They don't have to charge

307
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:32,165
Speaker 4:  you a subscription if you're willing to pay $3,000 to get everything.

308
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:36,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I think it, to me, it's just a totally different way of thinking

309
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:39,445
Speaker 1:  about a smart ring and it, it's not necessarily wrong, it's just really different,

310
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:43,405
Speaker 1:  right? Like this is a thing you buy after you have bought those

311
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:47,125
Speaker 1:  other devices. The the Ring is not the entry point

312
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:50,365
Speaker 1:  into Samsung's ecosystem. You're not gonna go buy these other devices because

313
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:54,085
Speaker 1:  you want the Galaxy Ring and If, you already have those other devices

314
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:57,765
Speaker 1:  kick ass. I think there's a, there's a decent chance this is the best choice.

315
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:01,725
Speaker 1:  If, if you're like, I'm coming to this shootout, yes, I already own these

316
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:05,565
Speaker 1:  two devices. I think the galaxy ring probably wins or at least comes close.

317
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:10,405
Speaker 1:  But that's not most people and that's not most people. And you're not, and

318
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:13,165
Speaker 1:  you, you're not. And you shouldn't make those other choices just to get a

319
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:13,485
Speaker 1:  smart ring.

320
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's also not, most people looking for a smart ring,

321
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:21,085
Speaker 4:  like the people looking for a smart ring is very kind of,

322
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:26,525
Speaker 4:  they're a defined set of people. I would say A lot of them are people

323
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,205
Speaker 4:  who just don't like smartwatches, So, I. Immediately you're, you're

324
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:33,725
Speaker 4:  kind of losing that benefit of like using it with a smartwatch.

325
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,965
Speaker 4:  And a lot of times they, you know, this is an interesting tip that, that

326
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:41,965
Speaker 4:  Aura told me, but their user base is majority female now. Hmm.

327
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:45,805
Speaker 4:  So they started out as a company where, you know, it was a majority men and

328
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:49,765
Speaker 4:  now they're majority women. So I think a lot of women who just

329
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:53,525
Speaker 4:  don't wanna wear these bulky smart watches who don't, who want

330
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:57,285
Speaker 4:  something a little more sleek, a little more understated. They, they're the

331
00:20:57,285 --> 00:21:01,205
Speaker 4:  ones who are really kind of pushing the smart ring as, as a form factor forward.

332
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:04,885
Speaker 4:  Like If, you look at smart ring ads on social media

333
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:09,165
Speaker 4:  'cause Lord knows I get served a zillion smart ring ads on my cursed

334
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:13,085
Speaker 4:  algorithm. It's all women. It's all women really kind of pushing the Oura

335
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:16,565
Speaker 4:  Ring forward. So, you know, I think in terms of people

336
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:19,445
Speaker 4:  looking for that, Samsung's great, but

337
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:23,975
Speaker 4:  you know, the ecosystem play is kind of their greatest strength and their

338
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:27,415
Speaker 4:  greatest weakness at the same time. It's very interesting to see how that'll

339
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:28,135
Speaker 4:  play out. Yeah,

340
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,615
Speaker 1:  I, I totally agree. So that leaves us with two, speaking of the AA ring,

341
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:35,855
Speaker 1:  we have the, the ultra human ring air stupid name and we have the

342
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:38,855
Speaker 1:  Ora Ring three. Which one came in second place?

343
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,935
Speaker 4:  It was the ultra human ring Air it, is it 'cause

344
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:43,615
Speaker 1:  Of the stupid name?

345
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:47,135
Speaker 4:  No it's not. 'cause it's the stupid name. Okay. It's because it's like way

346
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:49,455
Speaker 4:  too focused on training. Mm.

347
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:51,495
Speaker 1:  And it's like whoopy that way. Is it?

348
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:52,055
Speaker 4:  It's very

349
00:21:52,055 --> 00:21:53,335
Speaker 1:  Whoopy. It's like super intense. Okay.

350
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:57,335
Speaker 4:  It's very whoopy. It's like if Garmin made a smart ring, I feel like

351
00:21:57,335 --> 00:22:00,535
Speaker 4:  it would be very close to the ultra human ring and that's gonna be a plus

352
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:04,415
Speaker 4:  for some people. Yeah. But for others I think it's

353
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:08,095
Speaker 4:  just kind of too cluttered. It's too much.

354
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:12,015
Speaker 4:  It's, I thought it was really interesting because they, you know, they'll

355
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:15,215
Speaker 4:  tell you here's your caffeine window and here are the drinks that you can

356
00:22:15,215 --> 00:22:17,975
Speaker 4:  drink during the day. Here's like a little like

357
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:22,815
Speaker 4:  widget plugin that you can use If, you want sun exposure and just

358
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:26,975
Speaker 4:  very hyper-focused on optimizing. And I

359
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:30,775
Speaker 4:  believe there are a ton of people who would love that. I, I enjoyed it quite

360
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:34,735
Speaker 4:  a bit. I, I liked it a lot but I also felt that

361
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:38,735
Speaker 4:  it was just a little hyper-focused on that aspect

362
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:42,815
Speaker 4:  of it versus the Oura Ring, which is a little more holistic.

363
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:47,495
Speaker 4:  So If, you look at something that's really specialized

364
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:51,455
Speaker 4:  versus something that is for everybody, I think something

365
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:55,255
Speaker 4:  that's for everybody generally wins out. Which, yeah, at the end of the day,

366
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:58,655
Speaker 4:  that's why I picked the Oura Ring over the Ultra

367
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:02,655
Speaker 4:  Human Ring air. Even though that name is a

368
00:23:02,655 --> 00:23:06,535
Speaker 4:  mouthful. It was, it was quite a nice ring. I really liked it. What pained

369
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:10,135
Speaker 4:  me actually about those two being the winners is that those two are the ones

370
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:13,855
Speaker 4:  that use docs for charging. And I really like

371
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:17,855
Speaker 4:  a charging case for a smart ring. So agreed. It pains me that we have

372
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,615
Speaker 4:  to give doc supremacy, but it just boils down to the ring

373
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:22,295
Speaker 4:  itself of

374
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:26,055
Speaker 1:  The two. The only one of those two that I've had is the oral ring and the

375
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:29,695
Speaker 1:  number of times that it's Little Doc has just slid off my bedside

376
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:32,935
Speaker 1:  table and fallen onto the ground because it's not heavy enough drives me

377
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:33,535
Speaker 1:  nuts. It's,

378
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:34,855
Speaker 4:  It's not great.

379
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:38,815
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But I agree the charging is like, you know, do better everybody. But

380
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:42,135
Speaker 1:  that's not, it's not the the be all end all of this whole thing and the,

381
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:45,015
Speaker 1:  the battery's on all of them last long enough that like, it's, it's mostly

382
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:48,885
Speaker 1:  fine. So that means the Aura Ring three was the winner. Yes.

383
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:52,245
Speaker 1:  Kind of a boring outcome. I'm not gonna lie to you. That's

384
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:52,925
Speaker 4:  Not very boring.

385
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:56,885
Speaker 1:  It's like, it, it's, it was like Aura versus a bunch of Aura

386
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,085
Speaker 1:  imitators. I was and Aura

387
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:01,725
Speaker 4:  One I was rooting just like If. you can just imagine me as Tyra Banks with

388
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:05,325
Speaker 4:  six ring tanks. I was rooting for all of you to Deone

389
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:09,485
Speaker 4:  Aura to be quite frank. I did not want, I did not want it to

390
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:12,565
Speaker 4:  be the winner. and there was, there was a point where I was like, should

391
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:16,365
Speaker 4:  I give it to the ultra human? And just really my instinct was

392
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:20,165
Speaker 4:  that, you know, it's a little too training focused. If it had been a bit

393
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:23,845
Speaker 4:  more holistic then I would've happily

394
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,805
Speaker 4:  given it to the ultra human ring air. What a also

395
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:28,885
Speaker 4:  the name is just, I'm

396
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:29,085
Speaker 1:  You, it's,

397
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:29,965
Speaker 4:  It's really tripping me out.

398
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:32,405
Speaker 1:  Terrible. But I'll say one of the things that really struck me about this

399
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:36,325
Speaker 1:  is, I think this is where Aura having been in this

400
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:39,205
Speaker 1:  game this long has been really useful because a lot of the things you just

401
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:42,925
Speaker 1:  said about ultra human were true of aura in previous

402
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:46,685
Speaker 1:  generations. That it was really good at generating a lot of numbers and not

403
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,405
Speaker 1:  that good at making any sense of it or helping you in any sort of

404
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,085
Speaker 1:  meaningful way unless you like really wanted to be somebody who was super

405
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:56,405
Speaker 1:  intense about your sleep. And over time they've just gotten better at this.

406
00:24:56,405 --> 00:25:00,285
Speaker 1:  Like they, they they do more like wellness content. It's much more of

407
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:04,165
Speaker 1:  like a thoughtful thing for how to live your life as opposed to

408
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:08,085
Speaker 1:  just like a sleep score. And yeah, I think a a that's to aura's

409
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:11,405
Speaker 1:  credit and B, that is just a thing that takes time. And so Aura has just

410
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:15,125
Speaker 1:  been at this for so long now that I think it has figured out how to turn

411
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:18,845
Speaker 1:  all of that data into something that makes sense to lots of people instead

412
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:22,685
Speaker 1:  of just the like the hustle bro body hackers who

413
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,405
Speaker 1:  are served by some of these other devices.

414
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:27,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So like one point I'm gonna make is that we are now on an Oura Ring

415
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:31,685
Speaker 4:  Gen four or Oura Ring four. They removed the gen from the name.

416
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:35,125
Speaker 4:  Okay. And that drives my OCD Crazy. But so we're on the fourth

417
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,325
Speaker 4:  generation of Aura Ring. Most of these other rings are on their first

418
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:43,005
Speaker 4:  maybe second Right. Or like, and when we talk maybe second

419
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:47,645
Speaker 4:  literally just announced maybe second version of of the rings.

420
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:47,965
Speaker 4:  They

421
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:50,485
Speaker 1:  Announced it after you said the first one was bad. Yes. They said well we

422
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:53,605
Speaker 4:  Have another one basically. Yeah. The honestly, yes. So,

423
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:59,045
Speaker 4:  so you know the, it's very hard to kind of

424
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:03,165
Speaker 4:  discount experience in all of this. Sinking was a big

425
00:26:03,215 --> 00:26:06,805
Speaker 4:  issue for some of these competitors. Yes. They, it took a while. Like

426
00:26:06,895 --> 00:26:10,765
Speaker 4:  again with the circular I, I rage quit several times 'cause

427
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:12,165
Speaker 4:  it just would not sink. Yeah.

428
00:26:12,675 --> 00:26:14,205
Speaker 1:  Aura good at firmware updates now

429
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:18,405
Speaker 4:  Good at firmware updates now it does not take a lot to sink. Yeah. An

430
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:21,885
Speaker 4:  aura ring when you open the app, you're like, ooh, it's shiny and polished.

431
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:26,085
Speaker 4:  There's no like finickiness with it. Right. All the other ones, there's,

432
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,365
Speaker 4:  there's a bit of, there's a little bit of a lack of polish. It's very either

433
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:32,885
Speaker 4:  basic and some people just won't care about that and that's fine.

434
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:37,325
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying you can tell there's a difference when you open up the app

435
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:41,005
Speaker 4:  and it's smooth and there's no jitteriness or there's no

436
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:44,965
Speaker 4:  crashing or you know, it doesn't take forever to find a connection with

437
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:48,445
Speaker 4:  the ring. Even though they're all just using Bluetooth, it's not that hard.

438
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:52,765
Speaker 4:  So, you know, there's just a, a degree of polish

439
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:56,365
Speaker 4:  there that I can very confidently say after spending several

440
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:59,445
Speaker 4:  mornings waiting for all of these things to sink

441
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:03,485
Speaker 4:  that I can say that the aura was the best at it. Yeah,

442
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:07,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So the aura wins and then

443
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:11,195
Speaker 1:  immediately just to flex on 'em, they drop a new

444
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:14,835
Speaker 1:  version, they drop gen four, right? The Aura three one, this,

445
00:27:14,945 --> 00:27:17,755
Speaker 1:  this shootout and then they drop to the four. What's new in the four?

446
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:22,235
Speaker 4:  So the four goes to an all titanium design. And

447
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:26,795
Speaker 4:  for most people what you're gonna notice is that the inside of the ring is

448
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:30,635
Speaker 4:  flat. There's no like sensor bump. The, the old ring had

449
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:34,195
Speaker 4:  three little bumps on the inside and that was there for a reason. The inside

450
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,635
Speaker 4:  was epoxy. And epoxy is a type of resin where

451
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:41,715
Speaker 4:  it diffuses light in a specific way. It can get a, a little bit

452
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:45,195
Speaker 4:  messy. So you really want the sensors to have good skin contact

453
00:27:45,735 --> 00:27:49,715
Speaker 4:  in that case to kind of mitigate that kind of factor. Also

454
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:53,235
Speaker 4:  rings will rotate during the day. Ideally you want the sensors to be on the

455
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:57,115
Speaker 4:  underside of your ring because that's gonna get the best signal pathway

456
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:01,955
Speaker 4:  to your blood and all that nonsense. So

457
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:06,155
Speaker 4:  what this new ring does is that it recesses the sensors so

458
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:09,515
Speaker 4:  that it's more comfortable, you know, when I'm bloated this is a lot easier

459
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:13,235
Speaker 4:  and less painful to take off than the, the gen three was. I do appreciate

460
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:13,355
Speaker 4:  that.

461
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:19,075
Speaker 4:  And they have a new sensor algorithm which, you know, it just

462
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:23,035
Speaker 4:  basically more than doubles the number of signal pathways that can be used.

463
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,355
Speaker 4:  So if the ring is moving around on your finger,

464
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:30,395
Speaker 4:  it's not gonna matter quite as much for accuracy and

465
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:34,955
Speaker 4:  data collection. So it's, it's so minute. It's very

466
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:38,835
Speaker 4:  cool in terms of like an engineering perspective. Oh it also improves battery

467
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:42,355
Speaker 4:  life. Okay. So it's very cool from like a Ooh that's really

468
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:46,475
Speaker 4:  nerdy. That's awesome. I love this for the engineers. But

469
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:50,185
Speaker 4:  in terms of actually wearing it, not,

470
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:52,985
Speaker 4:  not a huge difference. Yeah, not a huge difference.

471
00:28:53,295 --> 00:28:56,865
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's fair. But I think the, there, there was a bunch of

472
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:59,665
Speaker 1:  software like between the beginning of the three and the beginning of the

473
00:28:59,665 --> 00:29:00,985
Speaker 1:  four also. Oh gosh. That is like

474
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:02,105
Speaker 4:  So much

475
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:05,905
Speaker 1:  The three, and again I think this is very much to aura's credit. Like the

476
00:29:05,905 --> 00:29:09,505
Speaker 1:  three is a much better device than it was when it shipped, which is not always

477
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:13,505
Speaker 1:  true of these devices. And the four gets all

478
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:16,265
Speaker 1:  of that. And then a little more like the one I was excited about was the,

479
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:20,665
Speaker 1:  the sort of expanded activity trekking. Yes. Because for me,

480
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:25,545
Speaker 1:  my problem with the Ora rings for a while and granted it's been, I,

481
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:28,705
Speaker 1:  I think the last one I wore was like the very beginning of the three

482
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:33,945
Speaker 1:  was that it eventually got to a point where it was only sort of sporadically

483
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:37,505
Speaker 1:  good at everything except sleep. Which it was very good at. But I didn't

484
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:41,285
Speaker 1:  care. Like I, I just, I have gotten to a point where sleep tracking just

485
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:44,645
Speaker 1:  does nothing for me. I, I know when I sleep well and I know when I don't,

486
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:48,605
Speaker 1:  I, that's pretty much all I got but there was a lot of the like

487
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:52,685
Speaker 1:  standalone activity tracking that it wasn't very good at even then. And I

488
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:56,645
Speaker 1:  think now it seems like the, the three and especially now

489
00:29:56,645 --> 00:30:00,605
Speaker 1:  the four are, are pretty good at that actually that like

490
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,805
Speaker 1:  as activity trackers they're pretty good.

491
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:06,685
Speaker 4:  They've expanded the automatic activity detection, which was a big thing

492
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:10,125
Speaker 4:  because like on a smartwatch it is so easy to manually start

493
00:30:10,605 --> 00:30:14,205
Speaker 4:  a activity. Yeah. On a smart ring you have to take out your phone, you have

494
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:16,285
Speaker 4:  to open up the app, you have to do the thing which is

495
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:18,165
Speaker 1:  Like non-starter honestly it's,

496
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:21,605
Speaker 4:  It's a non-starter for a lot of people. But now they've expanded it to 40

497
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:25,485
Speaker 4:  activities and it's not just the Aura Ring four that's gonna

498
00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:29,125
Speaker 4:  get that they've really not gate kept any of these software updates. Like

499
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:32,885
Speaker 4:  it might Well that all goes back. Yeah it goes, it goes all back. So it might

500
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:36,605
Speaker 4:  take a bit to roll out to the three but you know, I asked

501
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,925
Speaker 4:  Aura and nothing is really gate kept software wise.

502
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:44,405
Speaker 4:  It's just that this is like got the new sensing algorithm so it's more

503
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:48,165
Speaker 4:  accurate. That's the only thing that's really true of the four versus the

504
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:51,085
Speaker 4:  three. So not a huge incentive to upgrade for people unless their batteries

505
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:51,365
Speaker 4:  are shot.

506
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:57,045
Speaker 4:  But the automatic activity detection is, you

507
00:30:57,045 --> 00:31:00,925
Speaker 4:  know, I don't track my walks on smart watches

508
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:05,245
Speaker 4:  for a number of reasons but you know, it was actually quite good

509
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:09,325
Speaker 4:  at picking up when I had done the walks. It includes GPS maps,

510
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:13,245
Speaker 4:  it includes the heart rate. So it's like oh my little activity

511
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:17,125
Speaker 4:  was, it was still counted. Yeah. And I didn't have to worry about

512
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:20,965
Speaker 4:  duplicates because I do track all of my runs on a watch and all of my strength

513
00:31:20,965 --> 00:31:24,845
Speaker 4:  sessions on a watch and those, it just imported from

514
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:28,725
Speaker 4:  the health API so it was very clean, it was a very clean experience.

515
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:33,725
Speaker 4:  I have yet to get housework counted in

516
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,485
Speaker 4:  the Oura Ring. So apparently I'm not cleaning.

517
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:37,485
Speaker 1:  You have to clean more

518
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:41,365
Speaker 4:  Aggressively. I'm not cleaning with vigor. Yeah. Yeah. So we'll, we'll

519
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,805
Speaker 4:  have to see. I would love to hear from people if it's catching their basketball

520
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:48,405
Speaker 4:  sessions or whatever, but I'm boring. I mostly

521
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:52,445
Speaker 4:  run walk and do strength training. So I.

522
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:54,845
Speaker 4:  I'd love to hear from other people how that's worked out for them.

523
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:58,965
Speaker 1:  Well I barely do that so you've got me on that. But the reason Aura

524
00:31:58,965 --> 00:32:02,365
Speaker 1:  is very happy to bring all of these new features back to their old rings

525
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:06,125
Speaker 1:  is because of the way Aura makes money, which I would say caused a great

526
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,645
Speaker 1:  amount of consternation in our comments and in your email inbox

527
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:13,565
Speaker 1:  after you published three years, is this the battle royale in particular,

528
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:15,445
Speaker 1:  which is the subscription fee?

529
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:21,145
Speaker 1:  I should probably just lay my cards on the table here and say I don't think

530
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:24,145
Speaker 1:  this is a problem and a $6 a month subscription fee for something like this

531
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:27,985
Speaker 1:  is fine. It's fine. If, you don't wanna have it. Don't have it.

532
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:32,105
Speaker 1:  Like this is not, I think if you're, if if Apple started to suddenly

533
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:35,385
Speaker 1:  magically charge you another $6 a month to have an iPhone, I would have an

534
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:38,865
Speaker 1:  issue with it because that is like a, a thing. Everyone needs to live modern

535
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:42,565
Speaker 1:  life. A smart ring is not that thing. $6 a month to

536
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:46,525
Speaker 1:  make your $350 ring actually continue to be very

537
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:50,365
Speaker 1:  good for as long as Aura has done it I think is fine. I'm gonna get a lot

538
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:52,485
Speaker 1:  of angry people. That's just where I'm at. You,

539
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:56,365
Speaker 4:  You are going to get a lot of angry people. I have some sympathy because

540
00:32:56,835 --> 00:33:00,365
Speaker 4:  what basically, you know, Ora did a Marquez where

541
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:04,645
Speaker 4:  they had a, that's that's what they did. That's what they did

542
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,405
Speaker 4:  with the Gen three. Even though they did it before Marquez did it.

543
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,685
Speaker 1:  Marquez just catching strays on the first cast. Jeez.

544
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:14,365
Speaker 4:  No I, I mean like I think this is just like kind of a really easy recent

545
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:17,085
Speaker 4:  example to explain why people are mad.

546
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:20,485
Speaker 1:  Did Aura Release WA wallpapers app? Is that No. Oh okay. I see

547
00:33:20,485 --> 00:33:23,845
Speaker 4:  What you're talking about. So you know the, the Gen two had no subscription.

548
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:27,925
Speaker 4:  They introduced it with the gen three Fair. So you had a thing that did not

549
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:31,805
Speaker 4:  have a subscription that you've then added a subscription to. And that

550
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:35,565
Speaker 4:  is why Aura has been catching strays and has

551
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:39,565
Speaker 4:  made people super angry about this for so long. That

552
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:41,725
Speaker 1:  Is fair. It didn't use to require charging for charging something that didn't

553
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:44,765
Speaker 1:  use to cost money sucks. I do, I do agree with that. Yeah. I'm sensitive

554
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:44,965
Speaker 1:  to that

555
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:48,725
Speaker 4:  Argument. Yeah. So I, I fully understand where people are coming from

556
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:52,925
Speaker 4:  as to like why they were mad that Aura has a subscription

557
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:57,085
Speaker 4:  to begin with. On the other hand, I have to

558
00:33:57,145 --> 00:34:01,005
Speaker 4:  say that one time hardware sales does not

559
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,805
Speaker 4:  keep the lights on for most companies real and it really doesn't. When

560
00:34:04,805 --> 00:34:08,645
Speaker 4:  you have a company like Aura who is investing quite a lot into research and

561
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:12,165
Speaker 4:  development and science that's stuff is

562
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:16,085
Speaker 4:  expensive to have peer reviewed studies on

563
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:20,045
Speaker 4:  your device, you know, just submitting to a journal, a peer reviewed

564
00:34:20,045 --> 00:34:23,885
Speaker 4:  journal that's like $25,000. That's a lot of money. And

565
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:27,605
Speaker 4:  that's why you see a lot of dubious claims in the health tech

566
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:31,565
Speaker 4:  space about algorithms, about all of this stuff. They

567
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:35,005
Speaker 4:  are, they don't have to do this really, they don't have to test their

568
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:38,765
Speaker 4:  algorithm against Polysomnography, which is the clinical gold standard. They

569
00:34:38,765 --> 00:34:42,485
Speaker 4:  don't have to do any of this research. None of it is required

570
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:46,285
Speaker 4:  to just sell you a consumer grade device. They're choosing to do it

571
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:49,925
Speaker 4:  and it is expensive to do this So

572
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:54,205
Speaker 4:  I I in that sense you are paying for that. You are paying for the science,

573
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:57,205
Speaker 4:  you are paying for that degree of research.

574
00:34:57,745 --> 00:35:01,325
Speaker 1:  Is that a good trade? I mean Oro, Oro has won our contest and you just gave

575
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:04,925
Speaker 1:  it a nine. Like is that, is that the right trade off for Aura to be making

576
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:05,445
Speaker 1:  over time?

577
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:09,965
Speaker 4:  It is, it is a gambit that they are taking, I don't know if it's the right

578
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:13,605
Speaker 4:  one. Okay. They are betting that people are willing to pay for the best and

579
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:17,595
Speaker 4:  so long as they are the best. Okay, sure. Go for

580
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:21,435
Speaker 4:  it. I do think it is worth noting that all of

581
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:25,035
Speaker 4:  their competitors make a very big point about not having a subscription.

582
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:29,075
Speaker 4:  Right. And Samsung can afford to do that. Samsung is big.

583
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:32,595
Speaker 4:  They have other revenue streams. They don't need to

584
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:36,315
Speaker 4:  charge a subscription for the Galaxy ring, which is pricey.

585
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:39,805
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Because you have to spend $2,000 on a phone to get there.

586
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:44,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. To get everything you're gonna have to spend on all that hardware.

587
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:46,885
Speaker 4:  For some people they're not gonna think too hard about that because they

588
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:50,125
Speaker 4:  already have it or whatnot. Sure. Et cetera, et cetera. Sure. Love that.

589
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:55,125
Speaker 4:  But for some of the other competitors like Ring Con, which we completely

590
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:58,965
Speaker 4:  glossed over 'cause it's fine, you know, it's, it's it's, they can undercut

591
00:35:59,435 --> 00:36:03,045
Speaker 4:  Aura in terms of price and they can deliver a decent

592
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:07,105
Speaker 4:  fitness tracking experience and some people are

593
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:09,265
Speaker 4:  just gonna be super happy with that and they're gonna be fine with that.

594
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:10,865
Speaker 4:  And that's, that's great. I just

595
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:14,465
Speaker 1:  Think If, you want a decent fitness tracking experience,

596
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:18,185
Speaker 1:  download an app on your phone. Like I I I need that. I'm, I'm sort of serious,

597
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:22,145
Speaker 1:  right? Like you, you, you would be surprised not you v

598
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:26,065
Speaker 1:  but most people I think would be surprised at the sophistication

599
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:29,065
Speaker 1:  that you can get by downloading an app on your phone and then holding your

600
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:30,305
Speaker 1:  phone in your hand. It's not

601
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:35,105
Speaker 1:  remotely within range of these dedicated devices, but like If, you just want

602
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:38,745
Speaker 1:  a thing that does a relative job of counting your steps and telling you how

603
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:42,105
Speaker 1:  you slept. Those are apps on your phone. They exist. Yeah. Download those

604
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:45,985
Speaker 1:  things. I think the people who want this dedicated hardware

605
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:50,905
Speaker 1:  mostly want the best things and should, and this is like, it's, it's why

606
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:54,705
Speaker 1:  ultra human and whoop and some of these companies are going so hard. It's

607
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:58,065
Speaker 1:  why Garmin continues to go as hard as it does because these are, this is

608
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,665
Speaker 1:  the customer. And I think to some extent the thing that Apple

609
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:05,905
Speaker 1:  did with smartwatches was like pull that down towards

610
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:10,305
Speaker 1:  everyday people in a way nobody had before and, and had like taught Google

611
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:13,185
Speaker 1:  and Samsung in a lot of ways how to make watches that appeal to regular people

612
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:17,345
Speaker 1:  but also do some of those other things. And rings for me are still

613
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:20,945
Speaker 1:  very much in the like, unless you're serious about this, you don't even

614
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:22,465
Speaker 1:  consider buying one phase.

615
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:26,545
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They're just very, I really feel like it appeals

616
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:30,825
Speaker 4:  the most actually to wellness influencers and like that

617
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:34,945
Speaker 4:  type of person who just does not want a bulky smartwatch.

618
00:37:35,015 --> 00:37:38,905
Speaker 4:  They don't want smart, they're, you know, it is definitely not

619
00:37:38,905 --> 00:37:42,665
Speaker 4:  the average Vergecast listener. But there I have been to parties where

620
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:46,625
Speaker 4:  this very well dressed, well-heeled woman comes up to

621
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:50,225
Speaker 4:  me and she's like, oh I see you have an Aura ring. I love my aura ring because

622
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:54,345
Speaker 4:  I wanna wear this designer watch that is not a smart watch. I don't want

623
00:37:54,345 --> 00:37:57,225
Speaker 4:  an Apple watch, I don't want this. And I've just been sitting there going

624
00:37:57,225 --> 00:38:01,145
Speaker 4:  like, oh, okay. Yeah. How, how much is that

625
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,305
Speaker 4:  Air one salad that you're eating? Yeah. Like exactly. You know, I

626
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:07,225
Speaker 1:  Mean I buy that entirely Right. Like that. Yeah. And I think that is a really

627
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:10,865
Speaker 1:  good case for smart rings, but I think for most people If you don't wanna

628
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:14,735
Speaker 1:  wear a smartwatch and you don't care deeply

629
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:18,335
Speaker 1:  about the fitness side of things. Like, my point is there's no use for a

630
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:21,015
Speaker 1:  casual smart ring user at this moment. For most things.

631
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:25,255
Speaker 4:  For most things it's, it's truly just people who do not care

632
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:29,415
Speaker 4:  about, like, it's gonna seem foreign to techies I think. But they're just

633
00:38:29,665 --> 00:38:33,295
Speaker 4:  truly normal people who do not care about anything a

634
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:37,245
Speaker 4:  smartwatch has to offer. Because if we compare a smart ring and a smartwatch,

635
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:40,965
Speaker 4:  which are generally similarly priced value for value, the

636
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:44,765
Speaker 4:  smartwatch is gonna give you more of everything and

637
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:48,765
Speaker 4:  is in my opinion, a kind of ave better value proposition

638
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:52,405
Speaker 4:  for a lot of people. But there are just people who do not care about that.

639
00:38:52,745 --> 00:38:55,925
Speaker 4:  And it's, it's why I get so many people just

640
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:59,725
Speaker 4:  messaging me and DMing me and being like, I don't understand the whole point

641
00:38:59,745 --> 00:39:03,125
Speaker 4:  of a smart ring and I get it. I get what they're, where they're coming from.

642
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:06,605
Speaker 4:  But I've also talked to these other people who just are like, I don't get

643
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:10,525
Speaker 4:  the point of a smartwatch. Right. So it's, you're just serving two

644
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:13,845
Speaker 4:  very different audiences in in that respect. And

645
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:18,605
Speaker 4:  you know, it's the Kim Kardashians who is an Oura Ring user. It is be

646
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:22,285
Speaker 4:  Gwyneth Paltrows, the Jennifer Aniston, all of these people who are

647
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:25,995
Speaker 4:  just, it's a more discreet thing. So you're really just paying for the

648
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:28,395
Speaker 4:  discretion. You're paying for the form factor.

649
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:34,555
Speaker 4:  And we'll have to see because the, the thing about

650
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:38,515
Speaker 4:  other companies and if Apple comes out with a smart ring,

651
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:42,515
Speaker 4:  I think Aura is cooked. I think they're potentially cooked, maybe

652
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:46,435
Speaker 4:  not right away, but you know, 'cause the first Apple Watch wasn't anything

653
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:50,395
Speaker 4:  super amazing. It was just, oh, Apple's here. But like

654
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:54,715
Speaker 4:  if Apple was like, oh the Apple rang for oh

655
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:58,995
Speaker 1:  And I mean if Apple could take the decade of stuff it has learned

656
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:02,955
Speaker 1:  about health and fitness and just pull it out of the watch and into this

657
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,315
Speaker 1:  different form factor, like I think there's reason to believe that thing

658
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,715
Speaker 1:  could get much better, much faster

659
00:40:08,185 --> 00:40:12,155
Speaker 4:  Than, much better, much faster. And you know, if they kind of take some

660
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:16,075
Speaker 4:  of what Samsung's doing and pull it into the ecosystem, oh all

661
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:19,995
Speaker 4:  of a sudden we got the smart part of the smart Ring. 'cause right now we're

662
00:40:19,995 --> 00:40:23,555
Speaker 4:  just having a basic fitness tracker in a different form factor that is slightly

663
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:27,355
Speaker 4:  more comfortable for people to wear. Especially for this one specific

664
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:31,315
Speaker 4:  use case which is sleep tracking. Right. And Aura does that really well,

665
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:35,315
Speaker 4:  but Aura doesn't make phones, aura doesn't, it's, it's a very like

666
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:39,355
Speaker 4:  one trick pony kind of situation and they have to partner with other companies

667
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:43,755
Speaker 4:  in order to kind of expand beyond that. So,

668
00:40:44,855 --> 00:40:48,435
Speaker 4:  ah, did this, is this, is this subscription

669
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:52,395
Speaker 4:  plan gonna play out long term? I say in my review, I'm not sure

670
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:56,475
Speaker 4:  as so long as they're the best at this niche category. Yeah sure. I think

671
00:40:56,475 --> 00:41:00,275
Speaker 4:  it could, it could work for them but other

672
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:04,155
Speaker 4:  people are coming. I think it's very telling that Samsung came

673
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:08,075
Speaker 4:  out and knocked it out of the park with the hardware in its first go.

674
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:11,515
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The software is what needs work with Samsung and you know,

675
00:41:11,895 --> 00:41:15,755
Speaker 4:  not gatekeeping it to very expensive phones and watches to get the best

676
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:16,115
Speaker 4:  out of it.

677
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:19,755
Speaker 1:  Which to be clear is exactly what Apple would and will do if it ever

678
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:20,355
Speaker 1:  launches this

679
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:24,315
Speaker 4:  One. Yeah. But you know the, the Apple fans, they're really

680
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:25,795
Speaker 4:  invested. I have already,

681
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:26,875
Speaker 1:  Yeah. They got the money.

682
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:31,475
Speaker 4:  I have already heard from readers who are like, if Apple came out with the

683
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:34,485
Speaker 4:  Smart Ring, I would get it, but I can't be bothered with this Oura Ring and

684
00:41:34,485 --> 00:41:37,405
Speaker 4:  its subscription and I'm like duly noted. Duly noted.

685
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:40,125
Speaker 1:  It's good to be Apple. It really, really, really is

686
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:40,965
Speaker 4:  Is good be it's

687
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,245
Speaker 1:  Very good to be Apple. Yeah. Alright v we gotta go. Thank you so much.

688
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:47,045
Speaker 1:  Here's hoping you don't have to do this again next year because Apple launches

689
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:49,165
Speaker 1:  a ring but also If. you do. We'll be back. I

690
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:53,165
Speaker 4:  Probably will. I already have a, a straggler smart ring that I have to

691
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:55,365
Speaker 4:  review so we'll see.

692
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:57,525
Speaker 1:  All right, well we'll see you for the next one.

693
00:41:58,245 --> 00:41:58,565
Speaker 4:  Alright,

694
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:32,045
Speaker 1:  Alright, we're back. So when Apple announced all of its

695
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:36,005
Speaker 1:  new stuff in September, one of the biggest announcements was

696
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:38,685
Speaker 1:  about the AirPods Pro two, but it wasn't new

697
00:43:39,335 --> 00:43:43,085
Speaker 1:  headphones, it was just a software update for the headphones that brought

698
00:43:43,295 --> 00:43:47,205
Speaker 1:  among other things some new hearing health features and

699
00:43:47,205 --> 00:43:51,045
Speaker 1:  particularly an hearing aid mode that could actually be a really

700
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,685
Speaker 1:  big deal for people with hearing loss. We didn't get to try it at first,

701
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:58,365
Speaker 1:  but Chris Welch has gotten to try the new features now they're coming out

702
00:43:58,365 --> 00:44:02,085
Speaker 1:  soon. I think there's something very exciting going on here

703
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,845
Speaker 1:  if all of this actually works the way that Apple claims that it does. Chris

704
00:44:05,845 --> 00:44:09,365
Speaker 1:  luckily knows the answer. Let's get into it. Chris Welch, welcome back.

705
00:44:09,735 --> 00:44:11,085
Speaker 1:  Hello. It's a pleasure to be

706
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:11,565
Speaker 5:  Here as always.

707
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:15,285
Speaker 1:  This is, we've gotten to do this so much recently. It's just, it's like headphone

708
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,325
Speaker 1:  season in a, in a truly crazy way right now.

709
00:44:18,385 --> 00:44:22,165
Speaker 5:  It is. Now we're here for a headphone reason, but something a bit different

710
00:44:22,165 --> 00:44:22,605
Speaker 5:  than usual.

711
00:44:22,865 --> 00:44:26,645
Speaker 1:  That's true. It's like headphones adjacent, I would say. Yes. Yes. So

712
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:31,365
Speaker 1:  this is a strange way to ask an initial question, but what exactly have you

713
00:44:31,365 --> 00:44:33,565
Speaker 1:  been testing on the AirPods?

714
00:44:33,845 --> 00:44:37,685
Speaker 5:  So I've been testing a suite of new hearing health features for the AirPods

715
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:40,845
Speaker 5:  Pro. Apple announced to these at their event a few months ago

716
00:44:41,465 --> 00:44:45,245
Speaker 5:  and now they're rolling out with iOS 18.1 and some new

717
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:49,125
Speaker 5:  firmware for the Air Budds the week of October 28th. And so everyone

718
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:52,805
Speaker 5:  will be able to use their AirPods as hearing protection as hearing

719
00:44:53,035 --> 00:44:56,645
Speaker 5:  aids and there'll be, there's hearing tests. You can test

720
00:44:57,555 --> 00:45:01,485
Speaker 5:  your hearing because no one ever goes to the hearing doctor. I haven't been

721
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:03,965
Speaker 5:  in years. Yeah. So there's a lot to cover. Yeah.

722
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,885
Speaker 1:  I am going to ask you to reveal some personal information about yourself.

723
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:09,485
Speaker 1:  Of course. I hope you're ready for that. I'm ready. But the, the reason I

724
00:45:09,485 --> 00:45:13,245
Speaker 1:  ask that question that way is it seems like my initial

725
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:16,525
Speaker 1:  impression of this was that there was going to be like a, a hearing aid mode

726
00:45:17,265 --> 00:45:20,725
Speaker 1:  on the AirPods, right. That you would like go into settings and turn it on

727
00:45:20,725 --> 00:45:23,005
Speaker 1:  and then it would do a bunch of different stuff or it would be sort of an

728
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:26,205
Speaker 1:  accessibility feature. Yeah. And what it actually seems like is Apple has

729
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:30,085
Speaker 1:  baked this kind of hearing awareness

730
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:34,285
Speaker 1:  both of your own hearing and of the world into kind of how the whole

731
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:38,205
Speaker 1:  thing works. Like it's much more holistic Yeah. Than I expected. Has that

732
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:40,005
Speaker 1:  been, has that been your impression too? Mostly,

733
00:45:40,045 --> 00:45:42,045
Speaker 5:  I mean there is a hearing aid mode like that is a separate mode that you

734
00:45:42,045 --> 00:45:45,285
Speaker 5:  turn on or off. Okay. But the rest of like hearing protection is always on

735
00:45:45,405 --> 00:45:48,245
Speaker 5:  by default in all modes now. So like it was there before, like they had,

736
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:51,645
Speaker 5:  I think it was called loud noise reduction, but this is much broader. It's

737
00:45:51,645 --> 00:45:54,245
Speaker 5:  like people like wore their AirPods to concerts before and Apples never really

738
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:57,205
Speaker 5:  like said Sure, that's great. They didn't tell you not to, but they, you

739
00:45:57,205 --> 00:46:00,285
Speaker 5:  know, weren't like thrilled about it. But now you actually can use your AirPods

740
00:46:00,285 --> 00:46:04,085
Speaker 5:  at concerts and like they've tuned the EQ so you hear stuff better.

741
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:07,765
Speaker 5:  And so that's there and that's gonna be a huge deal for a lot of people who

742
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,245
Speaker 5:  like don't wear earplugs at concerts. Please wear earplugs at concerts.

743
00:46:12,945 --> 00:46:16,285
Speaker 5:  And so that's there. Yeah. It's like a lot of it's just on by default and

744
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:18,925
Speaker 5:  it's just gonna be there from now on. Okay.

745
00:46:19,065 --> 00:46:21,765
Speaker 1:  So the very beginning of this process is you take the hearing test right?

746
00:46:21,765 --> 00:46:24,805
Speaker 1:  That's the like the first thing that happens. Yeah. Tell me about this hearing

747
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:25,085
Speaker 1:  test.

748
00:46:25,555 --> 00:46:29,405
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah, it was very like emotional, very nerve wracking.

749
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:33,285
Speaker 5:  'cause I haven't seen the audiologist since probably 2018 pre covid

750
00:46:33,285 --> 00:46:36,365
Speaker 5:  easily. So it's been a long, long time. And like, I don't listen to like

751
00:46:36,365 --> 00:46:39,525
Speaker 5:  metal. I like sad bastard, singer, songwriters, you know, that kind of genre.

752
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:42,805
Speaker 5:  So like, thankfully I'm sure that's saved me a bit over the years, but like

753
00:46:42,805 --> 00:46:45,645
Speaker 5:  I grew up with like a Sony Diskman at my hip and like then so many iPods

754
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:49,485
Speaker 5:  and iPhones and so like I was nervous taking it. And so it's like

755
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:52,285
Speaker 5:  five minutes and you hear like a series of beeps, these three tone beeps

756
00:46:52,285 --> 00:46:55,365
Speaker 5:  just beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep and like all sorts of frequencies.

757
00:46:55,905 --> 00:46:58,325
Speaker 5:  And it lasts about five minutes first to do your left here,

758
00:47:00,155 --> 00:47:00,925
Speaker 5:  then you're right here.

759
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:05,005
Speaker 5:  And the test is different for each, like you hear it tones like different

760
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:08,885
Speaker 5:  times for both ears. So it's so you can't game it or like

761
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:12,525
Speaker 5:  that kind of thing. But yeah, it's just very intense. Like I had several

762
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:16,125
Speaker 5:  people here at the office take it and they were all like, yeah, it's just

763
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,965
Speaker 5:  very, you know, it's a lot also like hearing

764
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:23,685
Speaker 5:  loss is super common. Like 1.5 billion people in the world have some level

765
00:47:23,685 --> 00:47:27,125
Speaker 5:  of hearing loss and so like, it's nothing to be ashamed of or like stigmatized

766
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:30,170
Speaker 5:  and so it's just, you know, part of life. But like taking that test for the

767
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,845
Speaker 5:  first time is definitely like a thing.

768
00:47:32,465 --> 00:47:36,005
Speaker 1:  So it, the test is like, it, it plays these tones and it's, I'm sort of

769
00:47:36,005 --> 00:47:39,685
Speaker 1:  imagining the, the thing that you do, I've done this

770
00:47:39,795 --> 00:47:42,445
Speaker 1:  once that I can think of where you actually sit in the doctor's office with

771
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:45,525
Speaker 1:  a giant pair of headphones and and they're like, raise your hand when you

772
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:49,445
Speaker 1:  hear the tone. Yeah. Raise the, the hand on the side that it's on.

773
00:47:49,595 --> 00:47:52,085
Speaker 1:  It's kind of a, it sounds like it's sort of a smartphone ized version of

774
00:47:52,085 --> 00:47:52,205
Speaker 1:  that.

775
00:47:52,305 --> 00:47:55,125
Speaker 5:  Tap the screen whenever you hear a tone essentially. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yes.

776
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,485
Speaker 5:  So you tap the screen and like some noises are like super faint so you've

777
00:47:57,485 --> 00:48:00,125
Speaker 5:  gotta like pay super close attention. It's like that thing where like you

778
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:02,805
Speaker 5:  think you heard something but you're not sure they've like accounted for

779
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:06,685
Speaker 5:  all that and like the testing. And so yeah, it takes about five minutes.

780
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:10,965
Speaker 5:  It's a long five minutes, then you get your results charted out and there

781
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:13,885
Speaker 5:  are five tiers of hearing loss. There's little to know which I fell in somehow,

782
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:17,765
Speaker 5:  which is congrat amazing to me. Congrat. Yeah, thank you. There's moderate,

783
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:22,165
Speaker 5:  sorry, there's mild, moderate, severe and profound is the last one.

784
00:48:22,545 --> 00:48:26,325
Speaker 5:  And so those are the five levels. And so the hearing aid functionality is

785
00:48:26,325 --> 00:48:29,845
Speaker 5:  for anyone who has mild to moderate hearing loss. So If you have like more

786
00:48:29,845 --> 00:48:32,565
Speaker 5:  than that then you're still gonna have to go see like a professional and

787
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:36,925
Speaker 5:  get like that tier of hearing aid versus this. But it's still like a

788
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:40,125
Speaker 5:  big deal for so many people who don't wanna spend thousands of dollars.

789
00:48:40,825 --> 00:48:43,405
Speaker 5:  But yeah, the test itself is, it's kind of fun.

790
00:48:44,085 --> 00:48:46,845
Speaker 1:  I am sort of terrified just at the prospect thinking about this now because

791
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:50,845
Speaker 1:  I'm sort of in the position that you are. And I think about this with vision

792
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:54,485
Speaker 1:  too. Like I have, I have 2020 vision. I don't wear glasses. I'm very proud

793
00:48:54,485 --> 00:48:58,365
Speaker 1:  of that fact. I am 100% sure that if I go to an

794
00:48:58,365 --> 00:49:01,245
Speaker 1:  eye doctor, they are going to make me wear glasses. And so I'm never gonna

795
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:04,045
Speaker 1:  do it. I don't even have problems with my vision. It's just one of those

796
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:07,205
Speaker 1:  things that like, I, I bet it could be better and I don't even know. But

797
00:49:07,225 --> 00:49:10,725
Speaker 1:  the prospect of that scares me. And I think what's interesting about hearing

798
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:15,245
Speaker 1:  is that we all sort of understand the massive scale

799
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:19,165
Speaker 1:  of vision issues, right? That like you, we understand prescription

800
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:22,525
Speaker 1:  levels and they go all the way up and down and you can, you can go all the

801
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:26,245
Speaker 1:  way from like barely needing glasses to being totally blind. Like yeah, that

802
00:49:26,445 --> 00:49:28,605
Speaker 1:  spectrum we all understand. We don't talk about that with hearing at all.

803
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:32,935
Speaker 1:  And I think there is like, I don't know, decades at this point

804
00:49:32,935 --> 00:49:36,855
Speaker 1:  of people warning you about wearing headphones and listening to music Too

805
00:49:36,855 --> 00:49:40,535
Speaker 1:  loud. And I can still hear my parents being like, turn the music down.

806
00:49:40,535 --> 00:49:44,375
Speaker 1:  You're gonna, you're gonna go deaf. Yeah. But I don't think I've ever

807
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:48,335
Speaker 1:  had someone quantify my hearing for me. So. I. I am

808
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:50,895
Speaker 1:  curious like what was that, what does it feel like when you, you take the

809
00:49:50,895 --> 00:49:54,255
Speaker 1:  test it process and as you get the audio audiogram being like

810
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,905
Speaker 1:  you're mostly okay, like what is that? Yeah, a strangely

811
00:49:58,935 --> 00:50:00,505
Speaker 1:  like gratifying feeling.

812
00:50:00,855 --> 00:50:03,505
Speaker 5:  Very strange And like for some reason like my left ear a bit worse off than

813
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:06,305
Speaker 5:  my right. So that had me wondering like where in life like does my left ear

814
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:09,145
Speaker 5:  exposed to like much more sound than my right And like I couldn't pinpoint

815
00:50:09,255 --> 00:50:11,865
Speaker 5:  like any phase of life where that would've been the case. But it's driving

816
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:13,145
Speaker 5:  with the window. That's it is that's what it is.

817
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:14,865
Speaker 1:  It's just the wind coming by could very

818
00:50:14,865 --> 00:50:15,905
Speaker 5:  Well be just crushing your ears

819
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:16,265
Speaker 1:  Honestly.

820
00:50:16,295 --> 00:50:19,825
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. So that was my main takeaway. But I could see this going like

821
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:22,385
Speaker 5:  viral on TikTok and like having like a moment which would be good for like

822
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:25,185
Speaker 5:  awareness. I think, you know, it is like private obviously it's health information

823
00:50:25,185 --> 00:50:28,485
Speaker 5:  so not everyone is gonna be comfortable sharing. But I think, you know, it

824
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:30,845
Speaker 5:  could have a moment on like social media of just people like raising awareness

825
00:50:30,985 --> 00:50:34,485
Speaker 5:  and sharing their results and you know, I'm sure like the iPod generation

826
00:50:34,505 --> 00:50:37,965
Speaker 5:  is gonna have a reckoning of some sort, but yeah, it's gonna be

827
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:38,525
Speaker 5:  something.

828
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:41,405
Speaker 1:  Okay. So just to go back to one of the things you said a minute ago, the

829
00:50:41,545 --> 00:50:45,405
Speaker 1:  the, there are the five different scales of, of hearing loss

830
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:49,405
Speaker 1:  and you said the AirPods are only designed for the first

831
00:50:49,815 --> 00:50:53,245
Speaker 1:  three basically, right? Yeah. Little to no mild and moderate. Like that's,

832
00:50:53,465 --> 00:50:56,885
Speaker 1:  and for the rest that is you, you require something

833
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:59,525
Speaker 5:  Different. Still have to see a doctor and Okay. Have like a professional

834
00:50:59,845 --> 00:51:02,765
Speaker 5:  hearing aid equipped. Yeah, this is like more, this is like apple's counters,

835
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:05,405
Speaker 5:  like all the, all these new like over the counter hearing aids, this is their

836
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:09,125
Speaker 5:  take on that. And so yeah, it's gonna be like a super, super powerful thing.

837
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,805
Speaker 5:  Like we talk about like ecosystem lock-in and like this is like a whole new,

838
00:51:12,805 --> 00:51:15,085
Speaker 5:  whole new level of that If. you think about it like your hearing aid is like

839
00:51:15,085 --> 00:51:18,245
Speaker 5:  an Apple device now. And so like what are the ads you're ever gonna like

840
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,125
Speaker 5:  leave the iPhone at that point.

841
00:51:20,675 --> 00:51:23,485
Speaker 5:  Like on the whole I think it's a very good thing. I think there are some

842
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:26,125
Speaker 5:  concerns about like smaller companies, like why would you bother making your

843
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,405
Speaker 5:  own hearing aid and trying to compete against Apple, like the biggest tech

844
00:51:29,405 --> 00:51:32,205
Speaker 5:  company in the world, like once they come into this space. But on the whole

845
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:35,565
Speaker 5:  people are gonna save a ton of money, which is I think a huge deal. Totally.

846
00:51:35,905 --> 00:51:39,765
Speaker 1:  So once it's set up and once it's tuned to you specifically,

847
00:51:40,235 --> 00:51:44,165
Speaker 1:  what does it do? Like it it's, it's easy to say, you know, it just,

848
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:47,085
Speaker 1:  it makes everything louder so that you can hear it. But I have to imagine

849
00:51:47,115 --> 00:51:49,925
Speaker 1:  it's more complicated than that. Like what are, what are the actual features

850
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:51,605
Speaker 1:  inside of this hearing it stuff

851
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:55,725
Speaker 5:  You can tune like how loud it is you can tune like how sharp the sound is

852
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:58,245
Speaker 5:  and how crisp like there are a lot of the customization options once you

853
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:01,085
Speaker 5:  actually have your results. And so like that's important. If you wanna make

854
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:05,005
Speaker 5:  it sound right and yeah, so Apple says it

855
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:07,325
Speaker 5:  takes like a few days to adjust to how it sounds like for me it barely did

856
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:09,285
Speaker 5:  anything because I have little to no hearing loss. So I didn't really notice

857
00:52:09,285 --> 00:52:12,765
Speaker 5:  much of anything, but I say like that can still help people who like need

858
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:16,045
Speaker 5:  certain frequencies boosted and So I just haven't noticed it myself but,

859
00:52:16,685 --> 00:52:20,525
Speaker 5:  but it's there. If you want it. Battery life is about six hours with the

860
00:52:20,525 --> 00:52:22,845
Speaker 5:  hearing aid mode turned on, which is about the same as the Air pods itself.

861
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:26,845
Speaker 5:  So yeah, that's pretty nice. And yeah, I

862
00:52:26,845 --> 00:52:29,525
Speaker 5:  mean I don't know, not sure what else there is to say about like, I haven't

863
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:32,365
Speaker 5:  tried it myself. I'm sure there are gonna be like a deep dives about like

864
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:34,845
Speaker 5:  how well it works versus like over the counter options. Was there a

865
00:52:34,845 --> 00:52:38,525
Speaker 1:  Little part of you as a reviewer who was who wish that I wish I didn't have

866
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:40,485
Speaker 1:  worse ears. So I could actually do this to myself?

867
00:52:40,675 --> 00:52:44,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, in some way, but for now I'm just glad that I should concerts and still

868
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:47,605
Speaker 5:  still have mostly good hearing intact. So yeah,

869
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:50,685
Speaker 1:  I think it nets out. It nets out. Okay. Yeah, the concerts one I think is,

870
00:52:50,685 --> 00:52:53,925
Speaker 1:  is interesting 'cause there do seem to be sort of two sides of

871
00:52:54,595 --> 00:52:58,205
Speaker 1:  what a device like this does to your, your hearing, right? On the one hand

872
00:52:58,435 --> 00:53:02,165
Speaker 1:  it's enhanced things you want to hear. And I think to me the, the

873
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:05,165
Speaker 1:  best sort of existing thing I've heard a bunch of people mention is like

874
00:53:05,165 --> 00:53:08,725
Speaker 1:  the the voice isolation feature that you can get on calls and stuff that

875
00:53:09,035 --> 00:53:12,045
Speaker 1:  it's just, that's a, that's a certain bit of processing just designed to

876
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:15,045
Speaker 1:  make it easier to hear the thing that you want to hear and it's like take

877
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:18,645
Speaker 1:  that idea and sort of expand it across all the audio

878
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:22,685
Speaker 1:  on your phone and that is one version of what it's trying to do. Does that,

879
00:53:22,685 --> 00:53:26,165
Speaker 1:  does that seem about right to you? Having used it now? Yeah. Okay. But then

880
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:28,845
Speaker 1:  the flip side is all the, all the hearing protection stuff, right, which

881
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:32,365
Speaker 1:  is like the, these things are designed to protect your ears from getting

882
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:35,165
Speaker 1:  worse. And that strikes me as something that, that

883
00:53:36,265 --> 00:53:39,645
Speaker 1:  may actually be just as interesting to just as many people, even people like

884
00:53:39,645 --> 00:53:42,045
Speaker 1:  you who aren't photographing concerts all the time. Right.

885
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:47,325
Speaker 1:  I, I realized in just reading about this that I have no idea how that would

886
00:53:47,555 --> 00:53:51,085
Speaker 1:  work. Like what, what is, what is it doing in the hearing protection mode?

887
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:54,845
Speaker 5:  Just avoids loud sounds beyond like a certain threshold I think, I'm not

888
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:57,325
Speaker 5:  sure what the number is offhand, but like once things are like over that

889
00:53:57,325 --> 00:54:00,485
Speaker 5:  level, it'll just kinda like down, you know, just bring things back to a

890
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:03,645
Speaker 5:  safer level. And so that works in like all modes, like noise cancellation

891
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:07,605
Speaker 5:  mode, transparency mode, and also at the adaptive audio mode. And so

892
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:11,285
Speaker 5:  like each of those, like you'll hear like certain amounts of like a concert

893
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:14,565
Speaker 5:  like, like noise cancellation mode, you're still not gonna hear like much

894
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:16,685
Speaker 5:  of anything. So just still trying to like cancel out everything. So like

895
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:20,245
Speaker 5:  that's not the most enjoyable concert experience I would say, but you can

896
00:54:20,245 --> 00:54:22,925
Speaker 5:  use that transparency mode here pretty much everything. It's still gonna

897
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:25,445
Speaker 5:  be fairly loud in your ears, but it's gonna be like a much safer level of

898
00:54:25,445 --> 00:54:28,965
Speaker 5:  loudness versus If you didn't have them in at all. And so that makes all

899
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:29,805
Speaker 5:  the difference. Got

900
00:54:29,805 --> 00:54:33,685
Speaker 1:  It. So it's, it's basically there to just say it is

901
00:54:33,685 --> 00:54:37,565
Speaker 1:  going to sort of brutally suppress the worst noises, right?

902
00:54:37,585 --> 00:54:41,325
Speaker 1:  No matter the cost. Like forget the smoothing it out, trying to make it sound

903
00:54:41,325 --> 00:54:45,285
Speaker 1:  natural thing. Like we are going to just, just demolish any of these

904
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,605
Speaker 1:  really loud damaging sounds.

905
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:50,405
Speaker 5:  I mean just tuned to makes some things sound like natural and crisp and like

906
00:54:50,645 --> 00:54:53,245
Speaker 5:  detailed. Okay. So like you don't lose much by having it on. Like I was at

907
00:54:53,445 --> 00:54:56,485
Speaker 5:  this open mic night a few nights ago and didn't feel like I was like really

908
00:54:56,485 --> 00:54:58,805
Speaker 5:  missing out on much in terms of like frequency range or anything like that.

909
00:54:58,805 --> 00:55:01,845
Speaker 5:  So like I was impressed. I haven't used it like a big arena show yet, hopefully

910
00:55:01,845 --> 00:55:05,445
Speaker 5:  this week and he'll get a chance to do that. But yeah, I don't know, it's

911
00:55:05,445 --> 00:55:09,365
Speaker 5:  like a, it's just strange to have them in all the time now.

912
00:55:09,365 --> 00:55:11,645
Speaker 5:  Like for these tests that I've been doing, I think that's like a whole different

913
00:55:12,095 --> 00:55:15,525
Speaker 5:  thing to talk about. Like people are gonna be wearing air pods all the time

914
00:55:15,585 --> 00:55:18,045
Speaker 5:  now, which is kind of unusual versus where we've been before.

915
00:55:18,605 --> 00:55:22,325
Speaker 1:  I wonder about that though. I mean I, and I'm I'm, I'm still sort of

916
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:26,405
Speaker 1:  struck by you just saying so casually. Lots of people wear AirPods at

917
00:55:26,405 --> 00:55:29,405
Speaker 1:  concerts and like at first I was just like, oh yeah, sure, of course. And

918
00:55:29,505 --> 00:55:32,965
Speaker 1:  I'm like, wait, why on earth would you wear AirPods at concerts? But

919
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:37,685
Speaker 1:  to some extent I think we have really normalized the idea of

920
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:41,205
Speaker 1:  wearing AirPods all the time. Yeah. I think we, you can argue about whether

921
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:44,725
Speaker 1:  that's a good thing or a bad thing. I think by and large it's act it actually

922
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:48,285
Speaker 1:  sucks because like the social cues are a problem. Like right.

923
00:55:48,285 --> 00:55:50,565
Speaker 5:  If people think it's rude, but now you really can't have that like assumption.

924
00:55:50,595 --> 00:55:53,445
Speaker 5:  Like usually when I have my AirPods in people probably assume like I have

925
00:55:53,445 --> 00:55:56,045
Speaker 5:  like half, they have like half my attention. Whereas now like someone could

926
00:55:56,045 --> 00:55:58,085
Speaker 5:  be using it as a hearing aid and like you could have their full attention,

927
00:55:58,085 --> 00:56:00,845
Speaker 5:  right? And so it's not, you can't just assume like what someone is using

928
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:02,885
Speaker 5:  them for. I think that's gonna be the big legacy change here.

929
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:06,765
Speaker 1:  Totally. So yeah. What, how, how do you see that playing out? Like is this

930
00:56:06,765 --> 00:56:09,765
Speaker 1:  just going to push the, I'm wearing headphones from the minute I wake up

931
00:56:09,765 --> 00:56:13,645
Speaker 1:  till the minute I go to sleep thing to kind of the, the nth

932
00:56:13,645 --> 00:56:17,485
Speaker 1:  degree forever. Like for me it's always what do I do when

933
00:56:17,485 --> 00:56:20,805
Speaker 1:  I'm wearing headphones and I walk into Starbucks? Right. Right. And I, I

934
00:56:20,805 --> 00:56:23,725
Speaker 1:  think about like if I'm wearing over the ear headphones, this is the thing

935
00:56:23,725 --> 00:56:26,005
Speaker 1:  I've thought about too much. If I'm wearing over the ear headphones, I will

936
00:56:26,005 --> 00:56:28,645
Speaker 1:  take them off. You take them off around my neck because I'm wor like, you

937
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:31,085
Speaker 1:  should assume I'm wearing noise canceling headphones and legitimately cannot

938
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:34,925
Speaker 1:  hear you. Yeah. If I'm wearing AirPods I'll usually just

939
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:38,765
Speaker 1:  take one out. Okay. And sometimes even like take one out

940
00:56:39,615 --> 00:56:43,285
Speaker 1:  while the person is looking at me as a way of being like, hello,

941
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:47,005
Speaker 1:  I have, I am now paying attention to you. Yeah. But again, like you're saying,

942
00:56:47,005 --> 00:56:49,685
Speaker 1:  there are now going to be people who have an actual medical purpose to be

943
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:53,245
Speaker 1:  wearing these things in order to be able to hear people better. Right. And

944
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:57,205
Speaker 1:  if I'm the person behind the counter at Starbucks, that's just, it's gonna

945
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,405
Speaker 1:  be tricky to figure out what to do about that.

946
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:04,165
Speaker 1:  But it also just seems like maybe the only correct assumption is just gonna

947
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:07,765
Speaker 1:  be just talk to the people and hope to God they're not playing really loud

948
00:57:07,765 --> 00:57:09,565
Speaker 1:  music and I don't, I don't know. Yeah.

949
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:13,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think it's gonna take time obviously. I think it's gonna like just

950
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:16,045
Speaker 5:  kind of like have that thought of like people are being rude or like trying

951
00:57:16,045 --> 00:57:18,885
Speaker 5:  to ignore you kind of fade away. I mean that'll still be the case in certain,

952
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:22,605
Speaker 5:  like I put my AirPods in to avoid people at times. So like that's gonna keep

953
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,125
Speaker 5:  going I'm sure. But like there's just like that assumption of like why someone

954
00:57:25,145 --> 00:57:28,365
Speaker 5:  has their AirPod air AirPods in or earbuds in, it's gonna have to change

955
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:30,725
Speaker 5:  over time. It's gonna be a while I think. And I think like this is gonna

956
00:57:30,725 --> 00:57:33,925
Speaker 5:  put a lot of pressure on Samsung and Google, Google's like roll out their

957
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:36,925
Speaker 5:  own like versions of these features and like once that happens then, you

958
00:57:36,925 --> 00:57:40,765
Speaker 5:  know, and then it's really on. And so, but yeah, it's been like a

959
00:57:40,765 --> 00:57:43,805
Speaker 5:  surreal experience. Like the test is very intense. The hearing protection

960
00:57:43,805 --> 00:57:47,285
Speaker 5:  stuff is a lot of fun. It's good I think for everybody 'cause you don't realize

961
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:50,285
Speaker 5:  like how loud daily life is. Like I'm down in the subway hearing like screeching

962
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:53,605
Speaker 5:  trains go by sometimes and I'm just like covering my ears when I have nothing

963
00:57:53,605 --> 00:57:56,925
Speaker 5:  else available to me. So stuff like that is, yeah,

964
00:57:57,345 --> 00:58:01,045
Speaker 1:  You, you never go back once you wear something that is, is really good at

965
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:03,845
Speaker 1:  doing that kind of work. Yeah. Like it, it, it ruins a lot of things for

966
00:58:03,845 --> 00:58:07,805
Speaker 1:  you. But to that point actually, I, I'm curious how

967
00:58:07,805 --> 00:58:11,125
Speaker 1:  you're feeling as a, as a headphone guy about all of this because

968
00:58:11,665 --> 00:58:15,605
Speaker 1:  the, I think the, the stuff that Apple is doing for hearing health I

969
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:17,845
Speaker 1:  think is like unequivocally a good thing, right? Yeah. Like the, the question

970
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:21,805
Speaker 1:  is how well it works and for how many people And, and that's gonna be tricky

971
00:58:21,805 --> 00:58:24,485
Speaker 1:  because people are complicated and ears are different and everybody's hearing

972
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:28,205
Speaker 1:  is different, but whatever I think that is mostly agreed

973
00:58:28,235 --> 00:58:32,085
Speaker 1:  upon a good thing to be working on. But we're also in this phase and I think

974
00:58:32,085 --> 00:58:34,845
Speaker 1:  Apple is out in front of this, of

975
00:58:35,905 --> 00:58:39,845
Speaker 1:  trying to perfect every sound in every instance all the

976
00:58:39,845 --> 00:58:43,645
Speaker 1:  time. Right? And like the, the AirPods Pro two are probably

977
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:47,205
Speaker 1:  the best example of this, right? There's the, there's a gaming mode, there's

978
00:58:47,205 --> 00:58:50,765
Speaker 1:  a, there's stuff dedicated to just Siri working well. There's voice

979
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:51,205
Speaker 1:  isolation,

980
00:58:51,315 --> 00:58:53,125
Speaker 5:  Spatial audio, head tracking. Yeah

981
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:56,485
Speaker 1:  There's spatial audio head tracking. Like God help us if the

982
00:58:56,875 --> 00:59:00,765
Speaker 1:  head nod thing ever starts to take off like that, that sounds like a nightmare

983
00:59:01,025 --> 00:59:04,805
Speaker 1:  but I just think we're, we're headed to this place where step one is like

984
00:59:04,805 --> 00:59:07,405
Speaker 1:  build a nice pair of headphones and then step two is like

985
00:59:08,785 --> 00:59:12,525
Speaker 1:  try and process it perfectly and for

986
00:59:12,525 --> 00:59:16,445
Speaker 1:  every imaginable situation. And I just wonder if that's the right road

987
00:59:16,445 --> 00:59:19,485
Speaker 1:  to be going down with all of this stuff. Like we're headed towards such a

988
00:59:19,485 --> 00:59:22,605
Speaker 1:  weird everything is ar audio

989
00:59:23,845 --> 00:59:27,005
Speaker 1:  universe. Yeah. And I what does that make you feel as a, as a music guy?

990
00:59:27,685 --> 00:59:30,285
Speaker 5:  I think I feel much better about like these use cases versus like the other

991
00:59:30,285 --> 00:59:32,765
Speaker 5:  stuff we've seen previously. Like we've made a lot of noise about like, you

992
00:59:32,765 --> 00:59:36,045
Speaker 5:  know, giving up the headphone jack and like the pho you buy like the decides

993
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:38,365
Speaker 5:  what earbuds you get basically. Yeah. And like that's where we're at now.

994
00:59:38,865 --> 00:59:41,765
Speaker 5:  So to see like health benefits like that's where I'm like okay this is the

995
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:44,245
Speaker 5:  payoff to like where we've been going for all these years and that's great

996
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:47,325
Speaker 5:  but like, although like head nods and like those gimmicks are, you know,

997
00:59:47,325 --> 00:59:49,965
Speaker 5:  they are what they are, you know, people are gonna use them or they won't.

998
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:52,525
Speaker 5:  But like this is like the argument where it's like okay this is worth like

999
00:59:52,525 --> 00:59:56,045
Speaker 5:  giving up that phone jack going wireless only 'cause we're these are not

1000
00:59:56,045 --> 00:59:59,885
Speaker 5:  like just earbuds anymore obviously. And so that's good I think for the whole

1001
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:03,885
Speaker 5:  industry. But as far as like, you know, just music is still there, you know,

1002
01:00:04,045 --> 01:00:06,965
Speaker 5:  I love my music. I can just settle in and and you know and just vibe. Yeah.

1003
01:00:06,965 --> 01:00:10,525
Speaker 5:  And that's not gonna change anytime soon but they do do so much more now

1004
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:13,605
Speaker 5:  and so yeah, just a lot to think about to process and so

1005
01:00:14,765 --> 01:00:17,885
Speaker 5:  this is like a huge moment obviously, but gonna see the same from Samsung

1006
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:20,765
Speaker 5:  and, and those companies I'm sure 'cause like how could they not, you know,

1007
01:00:21,145 --> 01:00:21,925
Speaker 5:  try and copy this.

1008
01:00:21,925 --> 01:00:25,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It does seem like pretty clearly the next thing for all of these

1009
01:00:26,005 --> 01:00:28,885
Speaker 1:  companies. Yeah. And again I think it's mostly a good thing and I do think

1010
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,805
Speaker 1:  one thing it seems Apple has done well and I wanna hear more about your experience

1011
01:00:32,805 --> 01:00:36,125
Speaker 1:  of this is kind of after that initial setup, it doesn't

1012
01:00:36,515 --> 01:00:39,925
Speaker 1:  seem like you have to do all that much. Like you, you take the test and it

1013
01:00:39,925 --> 01:00:43,565
Speaker 1:  learns about your ears and yeah, I expected there to be tons of, you know,

1014
01:00:43,565 --> 01:00:46,725
Speaker 1:  buttons and knobs and you're constantly having it going in and, and like

1015
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:49,285
Speaker 1:  the, the voice isolation is another one for me. It has always driven me crazy

1016
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:53,085
Speaker 1:  that that's not just on like it's, it just makes your calls sound

1017
01:00:53,085 --> 01:00:56,045
Speaker 1:  better. Yeah. Just turn the thing on. I don't understand what the problem

1018
01:00:56,045 --> 01:00:59,805
Speaker 1:  is. Yeah. But Apple has always sort of hidden it underneath a setting and

1019
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:02,645
Speaker 1:  my assumption would be that a lot of this would be hidden underneath a setting

1020
01:01:02,665 --> 01:01:06,605
Speaker 1:  but it sounds increasingly like it's not and that once

1021
01:01:06,605 --> 01:01:08,605
Speaker 1:  you take the test and it understands your ears, it just kind of happens.

1022
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:09,125
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1023
01:01:09,635 --> 01:01:13,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah it's pretty true. So like there's the hearing aid mode, there's also

1024
01:01:13,645 --> 01:01:17,125
Speaker 5:  this media assist half of it to where it tunes like your music and your phone

1025
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:20,925
Speaker 5:  calls and videos based off like all your data from your hearing test. So

1026
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:24,285
Speaker 5:  all those things sound clear as well. So that's nice. So yeah, it's like

1027
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:27,325
Speaker 5:  a very comprehensive, all encompassing feature that's just kind of there,

1028
01:01:28,045 --> 01:01:30,845
Speaker 5:  just always there in the background, just working and so yeah, there's not

1029
01:01:31,005 --> 01:01:34,645
Speaker 5:  much to do. Like you can turn it all, some of it off hearing aid obviously

1030
01:01:34,645 --> 01:01:38,125
Speaker 5:  can turn on or off, but the hearing protection is just there, which

1031
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:42,445
Speaker 5:  should be the case obviously. And so yeah, there's not much to like do or

1032
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:45,005
Speaker 5:  tinker with or get wrong or mess up yourself, which I think is super important.

1033
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:47,325
Speaker 5:  Especially 'cause like, you know, there're gonna be older people using these

1034
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:49,805
Speaker 5:  features who like don't wanna have to like dig through settings, many use

1035
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:53,605
Speaker 5:  to, you know, tinker with stuff and so that's a big deal. Yeah. I don't know,

1036
01:01:53,605 --> 01:01:55,965
Speaker 5:  it's just there, it's simple, you know, it is very Apple. We say that a lot.

1037
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:59,885
Speaker 5:  It just works. This mostly has just worked Say Mary,

1038
01:01:59,885 --> 01:02:02,005
Speaker 5:  curious to see like how it compares to like other options on the market,

1039
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:04,925
Speaker 5:  like people's steep dives and like hearing aid functionality and, and all

1040
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:05,885
Speaker 5:  that. Yeah.

1041
01:02:05,885 --> 01:02:09,285
Speaker 1:  What do you, what have you heard anything from the, the kind of hearing aid

1042
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,685
Speaker 1:  community so far?

1043
01:02:10,905 --> 01:02:13,965
Speaker 5:  Not much. I've been trying to chat folks up but I guess, you know, they're

1044
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:16,965
Speaker 5:  a busy bunch these audiologists so That's true. So hopefully pretty soon

1045
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:19,405
Speaker 5:  I'll be able to stay with somebody and get some context but it seems like

1046
01:02:19,405 --> 01:02:21,685
Speaker 5:  people are pretty optimistic and hopeful that this is gonna be at least,

1047
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:24,645
Speaker 5:  you know, push the whole industry forward towards like making all this, you

1048
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:27,605
Speaker 5:  know, more affordable and that whole trend. So

1049
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:31,805
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I mean we've been waiting for a few years now since

1050
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:35,605
Speaker 1:  that bill passed for this kind of over the counter

1051
01:02:35,605 --> 01:02:38,725
Speaker 1:  hearing aid revolution that we were expecting and I think

1052
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:43,045
Speaker 1:  years ago people were expecting ultimately this, right? Yeah. Like, and

1053
01:02:43,045 --> 01:02:46,285
Speaker 1:  which I think is actually very cool. Apple sort of delivered the thing people

1054
01:02:46,285 --> 01:02:48,845
Speaker 1:  have been asking for, which is give me something that looks like a pair of

1055
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:52,645
Speaker 1:  headphones that doesn't scream medical device but

1056
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:56,565
Speaker 1:  gives me some of the help that I need. And I think I, I'm

1057
01:02:56,565 --> 01:03:00,405
Speaker 1:  gonna be fascinated to see how Apple communicates that line between here

1058
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:03,845
Speaker 1:  is who they're for and here is who they're not that like

1059
01:03:04,235 --> 01:03:08,125
Speaker 1:  even where you fall on the audiogram test, if it's gonna like throw up

1060
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:11,245
Speaker 1:  a thing that's like go see a doctor immediately about your hearing or if

1061
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:15,045
Speaker 1:  it's just more gentle about it, like we can help but only so much. Yeah.

1062
01:03:15,045 --> 01:03:17,725
Speaker 5:  It's pretty gentle. My experience, like the test is very like low stress.

1063
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,885
Speaker 5:  It's like this is all normal, hearing loss is normal, these are your results,

1064
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:25,515
Speaker 1:  Everything's fine. But we did call 9 1 1 on your behalf just now. Yeah. Talk

1065
01:03:25,515 --> 01:03:25,635
Speaker 1:  to

1066
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,435
Speaker 5:  A doctor If you have any questions? Yeah.

1067
01:03:27,735 --> 01:03:31,565
Speaker 1:  But, and it makes me wonder if this is going to be the

1068
01:03:31,565 --> 01:03:35,245
Speaker 1:  beginning of that movement that we've been seeing because I think

1069
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:40,205
Speaker 1:  there is one version of the outcome here that says Apple is

1070
01:03:40,405 --> 01:03:42,485
Speaker 1:  actually way ahead of some of these other companies and health stuff and

1071
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,765
Speaker 1:  has been working on this a lot longer and has a lot more of the expertise

1072
01:03:44,765 --> 01:03:47,565
Speaker 1:  and a lot more of the, you know, corporate lock in to make some of this stuff

1073
01:03:47,565 --> 01:03:51,505
Speaker 1:  work. And I think there's truth to some of that, but also Google

1074
01:03:51,565 --> 01:03:55,465
Speaker 1:  and Samsung ought to be able to do this kind of thing

1075
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:59,265
Speaker 1:  pretty well pretty quickly. Yeah. Is there any

1076
01:03:59,265 --> 01:04:02,705
Speaker 1:  reason you think Apple might have some insurmountable lead here or is this

1077
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:06,025
Speaker 1:  just gonna become the next feature of, of all of these headphones? I

1078
01:04:06,025 --> 01:04:07,825
Speaker 5:  Think they'll be the next feature in time. I think Apple got a head start

1079
01:04:07,825 --> 01:04:11,145
Speaker 5:  is 'cause they've like focused on this vertical integration of like all their

1080
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:14,505
Speaker 5:  hardware for so, so long that like they've had to jump on like these features.

1081
01:04:14,745 --> 01:04:17,665
Speaker 5:  But I'm sure in time like Samsung and Google, I'm not sure how like other

1082
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:20,545
Speaker 5:  companies would get involved like Zen Heiser and Sony, like what are they

1083
01:04:20,545 --> 01:04:23,585
Speaker 5:  gonna do? Right? Like being just like third party Sony has something over

1084
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:25,905
Speaker 5:  the counter hearing aids, but like that's not quite the same thing as like

1085
01:04:26,205 --> 01:04:28,785
Speaker 5:  that's the thing that's tied to your phone, like knows what you're listening

1086
01:04:28,785 --> 01:04:31,585
Speaker 5:  to and like how to make that sound better at all times.

1087
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:35,225
Speaker 5:  Say it's curious, like, I'm curious if Apple's gonna like run ads about these

1088
01:04:35,465 --> 01:04:38,785
Speaker 5:  features like on tv, like that'll be fascinating. But I think there's just

1089
01:04:38,785 --> 01:04:41,985
Speaker 5:  gonna be like a big push of like awareness hearing health. 'cause that's,

1090
01:04:42,005 --> 01:04:45,945
Speaker 5:  you know, very easy to take for granted until, you know, you

1091
01:04:45,945 --> 01:04:49,665
Speaker 5:  start losing some of it over time. Totally. Thankfully I'm still in good

1092
01:04:49,665 --> 01:04:53,465
Speaker 5:  shape. I've got random bouts of tinnitus. Tinnitus. Well however that's

1093
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:56,425
Speaker 5:  pronounced random bouts of that like once or twice a month where I hear just

1094
01:04:56,425 --> 01:05:00,385
Speaker 5:  a little like ringing in my ears. But if that's the worst that I've had through

1095
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:02,945
Speaker 5:  40 years so far, then I'll, I'll take that. Yeah,

1096
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:06,505
Speaker 1:  That's not so bad. You gotta, you could just print out and frame the, the

1097
01:05:06,505 --> 01:05:10,065
Speaker 1:  audiogram results there. That's pretty good. Yeah. Before I let you go, anything

1098
01:05:10,065 --> 01:05:13,065
Speaker 1:  else in the, the software update here? I mean Apple

1099
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:17,445
Speaker 1:  basically announced these things like they were a brand new product.

1100
01:05:17,715 --> 01:05:20,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Despite it just being a software update to a set of existing headphones.

1101
01:05:20,665 --> 01:05:24,605
Speaker 1:  You've been using the software update for a while now. Anything else to

1102
01:05:24,605 --> 01:05:24,845
Speaker 1:  report?

1103
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:29,965
Speaker 5:  I mean that's the reason that I would update to iOS 18.1. You know, If, you

1104
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:33,525
Speaker 5:  don't care about all the AI stuff and Apple Intelligence, this is a great

1105
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:37,005
Speaker 5:  reason to like get all these new features. You can't do it on iOS 18.0 or

1106
01:05:37,005 --> 01:05:39,765
Speaker 5:  like any previous version. So you have to update If, you want all these AirPods

1107
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:43,005
Speaker 5:  features. So If, you don't care about the ai AI stuff, which I do like the

1108
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:45,925
Speaker 5:  summarized notifications on iOS 18.1. They're, they're pretty handy.

1109
01:05:46,945 --> 01:05:49,645
Speaker 5:  But as far as like other like AirPods stuff, you know, the head nods are

1110
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:50,845
Speaker 5:  there, they work fairly well. Do

1111
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:51,685
Speaker 1:  You use them beyond?

1112
01:05:51,755 --> 01:05:55,045
Speaker 5:  I've tried them. I turned them off pretty quickly. They worked, you know,

1113
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:57,885
Speaker 5:  I'm sure, I'm sure there are people who love like all these like very niche

1114
01:05:58,165 --> 01:06:01,085
Speaker 5:  features and so, you know, people like love having Siri, like read their

1115
01:06:01,085 --> 01:06:04,525
Speaker 5:  notifications out loud. I would never want that to, to be my situation.

1116
01:06:04,785 --> 01:06:08,725
Speaker 1:  No. To me it's just the, the penalty for having the

1117
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:12,845
Speaker 1:  nod and head shake on and get it wrong is that like I answer a

1118
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:15,085
Speaker 1:  phone call that I don't want to in the

1119
01:06:15,085 --> 01:06:18,445
Speaker 5:  Wrong. That you very clearly like shook your head vigorously not to answer.

1120
01:06:18,555 --> 01:06:18,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1121
01:06:18,845 --> 01:06:22,605
Speaker 1:  Exactly. Like that is, I know enough about this technology

1122
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,605
Speaker 1:  to know that that stuff is imperfect. Yeah. And the just the penalty for

1123
01:06:25,605 --> 01:06:29,525
Speaker 1:  being wrong once terrifies me. Like even now when I'm, I'm in the car

1124
01:06:29,525 --> 01:06:31,805
Speaker 1:  or whatever and it's like, so and so is calling. Would you like to answer?

1125
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:36,325
Speaker 1:  I I have, I never have said the word no more clearly than I do Yeah. In

1126
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,845
Speaker 1:  those moments. Yeah. And still I'm afraid that something is gonna go wrong.

1127
01:06:40,405 --> 01:06:44,365
Speaker 1:  So I think making that stuff even simpler seems like a

1128
01:09:04,235 --> 01:09:06,935
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the hotline as always. The number is

1137
01:09:35,275 --> 01:09:37,815
Speaker 1:  We have a very fun question about video games.

1138
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:43,375
Speaker 6:  Hi Vergecast, my name is Brian, I'm in North Carolina, nearish, epic and

1139
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:47,295
Speaker 6:  limited run games. For context, I've had this question ever since you had

1140
01:09:47,455 --> 01:09:50,735
Speaker 6:  RI tested on the show about Delta and emulation on iOS,

1141
01:09:51,315 --> 01:09:54,695
Speaker 6:  it came up again at the tail end of your origins of podcasting episode.

1142
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:58,955
Speaker 6:  Apple had a gaming problem. Why don't they just buy Nintendo?

1143
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:02,945
Speaker 6:  I know they have enough liquid capital sitting around that they could purchase

1144
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:06,385
Speaker 6:  the entirety of that company like you. Or I could go buy a switch.

1145
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:11,005
Speaker 6:  So what's stopping them? Is it Lena Khan? Does that matter?

1146
01:10:11,005 --> 01:10:14,815
Speaker 6:  If the company isn't American, is it that they don't actually

1147
01:10:14,845 --> 01:10:18,495
Speaker 6:  care about games? Would Nintendo say no to a

1148
01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:22,475
Speaker 6:  Scrooge McDuck sized pile of Apple cash? So that's

1149
01:10:22,475 --> 01:10:25,995
Speaker 6:  my question. Why doesn't Apple solve its problem with gaming by eating

1150
01:10:26,035 --> 01:10:29,915
Speaker 6:  Nintendo? What stops it from doing that? And just for fun,

1151
01:10:29,945 --> 01:10:33,655
Speaker 6:  what would the world look like if it did? Thanks for talking about this.

1152
01:10:34,245 --> 01:10:37,855
Speaker 6:  I've been sitting with this in my head for literal months and I'm more than

1153
01:10:37,855 --> 01:10:41,255
Speaker 6:  happy for it to sit in your heads. Instead, I need to go do other things

1154
01:10:41,275 --> 01:10:42,095
Speaker 6:  now. Thanks. Bye.

1155
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:46,495
Speaker 1:  All right. I have brought the verges foremost Nintendo expert, Andrew Webster

1156
01:10:46,495 --> 01:10:50,415
Speaker 1:  here to help me with this. Andrew. Hello. Hello. So. I caught you

1157
01:10:50,415 --> 01:10:53,775
Speaker 1:  in the middle of writing a piece. Would you just briefly describe the piece

1158
01:10:53,775 --> 01:10:56,415
Speaker 1:  that you've, you're, you're working on? Because I think it's a useful setup

1159
01:10:56,595 --> 01:10:57,495
Speaker 1:  for what we're doing here.

1160
01:10:57,875 --> 01:11:01,655
Speaker 7:  Oh, well now I have to write it, but the, the working headline is,

1161
01:11:01,975 --> 01:11:05,375
Speaker 7:  I have given up on guessing what Nintendo is going to do,

1162
01:11:05,945 --> 01:11:09,855
Speaker 7:  which is a conclusion I've come to after covering them for like, I dunno,

1163
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:10,815
Speaker 7:  15 years or so,

1164
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:14,815
Speaker 1:  So I. I wanna separate, separate this into two pieces. There is the, why

1165
01:11:14,815 --> 01:11:18,655
Speaker 1:  does an Apple buy a Nintendo piece of it? and there is the, what

1166
01:11:18,655 --> 01:11:22,575
Speaker 1:  would the world look like if Nintendo were owned by Apple? And I feel like

1167
01:11:23,235 --> 01:11:27,215
Speaker 1:  in the first case the answer seems very straightforward, which is that

1168
01:11:27,355 --> 01:11:31,295
Speaker 1:  anyone would, seems like they would wanna buy Nintendo, right? Like ev

1169
01:11:31,815 --> 01:11:35,495
Speaker 1:  everyone given the opportunity would, including Apple I assume

1170
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:38,535
Speaker 1:  would leap to buy Nintendo. You think that's true?

1171
01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:42,415
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think the, what's stopping them is obviously Nintendo.

1172
01:11:42,935 --> 01:11:46,775
Speaker 7:  Nintendo has Scrooge McDuck piles already and they just keep getting

1173
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:48,495
Speaker 7:  more and more.

1174
01:11:50,485 --> 01:11:54,345
Speaker 7:  So there's not really any reason for them to sell. And I do think

1175
01:11:54,345 --> 01:11:58,225
Speaker 7:  that that point about Apple not caring about gaming is very true.

1176
01:11:58,645 --> 01:12:02,585
Speaker 7:  I'm like, in addition to being the verges foremost Nintendo expert,

1177
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:06,585
Speaker 7:  I'm also our only Apple arcade expert. And it is a great service. Yeah.

1178
01:12:06,585 --> 01:12:10,465
Speaker 7:  That it is just nobody knows about because

1179
01:12:10,835 --> 01:12:14,785
Speaker 7:  Apple does not care. And I also don't think Apple thinks it

1180
01:12:14,785 --> 01:12:18,625
Speaker 7:  has a gaming problem because it makes a lot

1181
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:22,545
Speaker 7:  of money from games and not the kind of games that Nintendo

1182
01:12:22,555 --> 01:12:22,905
Speaker 7:  makes.

1183
01:12:23,815 --> 01:12:27,545
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I think the question of like, would Apple be interested in making

1184
01:12:28,485 --> 01:12:32,345
Speaker 1:  the next Zelda game is actually really interesting. I think Apple is very

1185
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:36,265
Speaker 1:  happy running a store in which it gets cuts of the

1186
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:39,585
Speaker 1:  work that other people do. And if we've learned one thing about the gaming

1187
01:12:39,825 --> 01:12:41,585
Speaker 1:  industry in the last couple of years, it's that you spend an awful lot of

1188
01:12:41,585 --> 01:12:45,545
Speaker 1:  money making things that may or may not work. And I guess the

1189
01:12:45,545 --> 01:12:49,145
Speaker 1:  appeal of Nintendo is that mostly it makes things that work, its hit rate

1190
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:50,825
Speaker 1:  has gotta be better than anybody's, right?

1191
01:12:51,215 --> 01:12:55,025
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I mean they tried this, I am one of the few

1192
01:12:55,025 --> 01:12:58,825
Speaker 7:  people who will say Super Mario Run was an excellent game fair and it was

1193
01:12:58,825 --> 01:13:02,745
Speaker 7:  downloaded, I don't know, 200 million times, but not enough people bought

1194
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:06,705
Speaker 7:  it for Nintendo to consider that success. So like you've

1195
01:13:06,705 --> 01:13:10,105
Speaker 7:  already had Shiro Miyamoto make a game for the iPhone and

1196
01:13:10,775 --> 01:13:14,705
Speaker 7:  they never followed it up. So, and you know, apple

1197
01:13:14,705 --> 01:13:18,385
Speaker 7:  Arcade already has a very good sell to clone So I think Apple's pretty happy.

1198
01:13:18,695 --> 01:13:22,665
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So before we pivot to the what would it look like thing I just

1199
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:25,425
Speaker 1:  wanna, I went back after we got this question and found

1200
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:30,505
Speaker 1:  from last summer, summer of 2023, there were all those emails

1201
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:33,425
Speaker 1:  from 2020 that leaked out in the Microsoft case

1202
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:37,785
Speaker 1:  and one of them was from Phil Spencer to a couple of folks on his team about

1203
01:13:37,985 --> 01:13:41,305
Speaker 1:  Nintendo. And I think he, he pretty neatly I think sums up

1204
01:13:42,065 --> 01:13:45,185
Speaker 1:  everyone's feelings about Nintendo in general. And he says, I totally agree

1205
01:13:45,185 --> 01:13:48,825
Speaker 1:  that Nintendo is the prime asset for us in gaming. And today gaming is our

1206
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:51,465
Speaker 1:  most likely path to consumer relevance. This is, they're talking about Xbox,

1207
01:13:51,465 --> 01:13:55,025
Speaker 1:  obviously I've had numerous conversations with the LT of Nintendo about tighter

1208
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,945
Speaker 1:  collaboration and feel like if any US company would have a chance with Nintendo,

1209
01:13:57,945 --> 01:14:01,465
Speaker 1:  we are probably in the best position. This is the best part. The unfortunate

1210
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:04,825
Speaker 1:  or fortunate for Nintendo situation is that Nintendo is sitting on a big

1211
01:14:04,825 --> 01:14:07,705
Speaker 1:  pile of cash. They have a board of directors that until recently has not

1212
01:14:07,705 --> 01:14:11,605
Speaker 1:  pushed for further increases in market growth or stock appreciation. And

1213
01:14:11,605 --> 01:14:15,365
Speaker 1:  his basic thing is like, I don't know what to give Nintendo. They don't want

1214
01:14:15,365 --> 01:14:19,205
Speaker 1:  our money, they don't want our resources. They're very happy being Nintendo.

1215
01:14:19,425 --> 01:14:23,125
Speaker 1:  And I feel like that is why no one has bought Nintendo because Nintendo is

1216
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,045
Speaker 1:  super happy being Nintendo.

1217
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:29,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. We think of Nintendo as this playful company. You know, me

1218
01:14:29,645 --> 01:14:33,355
Speaker 7:  and Boto is like happy go lucky guy, but they're a

1219
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:37,235
Speaker 7:  ruthless corporation that extracts as much money from everything as they

1220
01:14:37,235 --> 01:14:40,235
Speaker 7:  can. Yeah. Good luck finding Zelda on sale ever.

1221
01:14:40,885 --> 01:14:44,435
Speaker 1:  Right, right. I mean, what the switch is eight years old now. Yeah. And still

1222
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:47,115
Speaker 1:  doing just fine. Like Nintendo knows exactly what it's doing

1223
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:52,235
Speaker 1:  and Yeah, I I I like to the would they accept

1224
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:55,715
Speaker 1:  any offer? I'm sure there's a number, everybody always has a number, but

1225
01:14:55,715 --> 01:14:58,755
Speaker 1:  at some point Nintendo's market cap I think I was looking at this morning

1226
01:14:58,755 --> 01:15:02,595
Speaker 1:  is like $62 billion and that's a, that's a big number

1227
01:15:02,615 --> 01:15:06,235
Speaker 1:  and at some point I'm sure there is a number, but I bet that number is substantially

1228
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,955
Speaker 1:  higher than anybody thinks it is for what it would take to actually get that

1229
01:15:08,955 --> 01:15:12,835
Speaker 1:  done. But since you brought up Apple Arcade, I just, I just

1230
01:15:12,835 --> 01:15:16,355
Speaker 1:  want to fantasize for a minute here. Let's, let's say Apple decides to write

1231
01:15:16,355 --> 01:15:20,035
Speaker 1:  a check for, you know, all of the cash. It has $250 billion

1232
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:23,555
Speaker 1:  and it owns Nintendo. And do you think Apple would do with Nintendo

1233
01:15:24,425 --> 01:15:28,395
Speaker 7:  That is like, I've been thinking about this and I feel like there's two avenues,

1234
01:15:29,095 --> 01:15:32,915
Speaker 7:  one of which is good and will not be successful and one of which is bad and

1235
01:15:32,915 --> 01:15:33,715
Speaker 7:  we will make a ton of money.

1236
01:15:34,305 --> 01:15:34,955
Speaker 1:  That sounds right.

1237
01:15:35,255 --> 01:15:39,035
Speaker 7:  The one is the Apple arcade route, which is like, yeah you can play like

1238
01:15:39,885 --> 01:15:43,755
Speaker 7:  Mario three and the Mario Wonder and like all these games

1239
01:15:43,855 --> 01:15:47,755
Speaker 7:  on your phone and Nintendo has access to the hardware

1240
01:15:47,895 --> 01:15:51,795
Speaker 7:  in a way that they do when they make their own hardware

1241
01:15:51,815 --> 01:15:55,355
Speaker 7:  and can make things that are perfectly suited for it. Again, Mario one is

1242
01:15:55,355 --> 01:15:57,795
Speaker 7:  good. It's a game designed for a touchscreen. They know what they're doing.

1243
01:15:57,935 --> 01:15:58,475
Speaker 7:  That's like

1244
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:00,035
Speaker 1:  A dream scenario by the way. That's

1245
01:16:00,035 --> 01:16:00,395
Speaker 7:  A dream scenario.

1246
01:16:00,635 --> 01:16:03,755
Speaker 1:  A lot of like you get to emulate all the games on your Apple devices, it

1247
01:16:03,755 --> 01:16:07,675
Speaker 1:  becomes this like incredible place for Nintendo to put everything it's ever

1248
01:16:07,675 --> 01:16:10,435
Speaker 1:  made, including all the new stuff like that. Sounds awesome.

1249
01:16:10,905 --> 01:16:14,435
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And that's what people say they want, but not enough people most likely

1250
01:16:14,435 --> 01:16:17,075
Speaker 7:  would actually pay the money for it. Yeah. And what's more likely to happen

1251
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:21,365
Speaker 7:  is, so Mario Run, I keep bringing it up,

1252
01:16:21,465 --> 01:16:24,765
Speaker 7:  it was generally a failure for them, but they have had several

1253
01:16:24,815 --> 01:16:28,685
Speaker 7:  successful mobile games which are, there's Am Crossing one, there's

1254
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:32,285
Speaker 7:  Fire Emblem one, and they are just filled with all of the free to play

1255
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,525
Speaker 7:  bullshit that everyone hates, but they make so much money they're still running

1256
01:16:36,985 --> 01:16:40,005
Speaker 7:  and even though Nintendo has forgotten about

1257
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:43,525
Speaker 7:  mobile gaming, they don't turn those switches off because they get money

1258
01:16:44,025 --> 01:16:47,565
Speaker 7:  and that is how Apple makes it money from gaming.

1259
01:16:48,305 --> 01:16:52,245
Speaker 7:  So I think the dire scenario is, you know, loot boxes

1260
01:16:52,305 --> 01:16:53,125
Speaker 7:  and animal crossing

1261
01:16:53,535 --> 01:16:57,085
Speaker 1:  Right. Or loot boxes in tiers of the kingdom. Right. That's exactly the,

1262
01:16:57,085 --> 01:17:00,525
Speaker 1:  that's that's where this starts to get really dark. Yeah. Which of course

1263
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:04,645
Speaker 1:  ruins tears of the kingdom in a lot of, and so it's like maybe there is something

1264
01:17:04,645 --> 01:17:07,645
Speaker 1:  about the way that Nintendo works right now that is the reason it's able

1265
01:17:07,645 --> 01:17:10,820
Speaker 1:  to do the things that it does. Like maybe it stick it inside of a corporation

1266
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:14,685
Speaker 1:  that is much more worried about maximizing growth and it changes all of the

1267
01:17:14,685 --> 01:17:17,405
Speaker 1:  incentives here. Yeah. Like maybe the way we have it is actually the correct

1268
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:17,965
Speaker 1:  way to have it.

1269
01:17:18,355 --> 01:17:21,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Mario Wonder exists when I was talking to the

1270
01:17:22,245 --> 01:17:26,165
Speaker 7:  directors because they were like, we're not gonna have a deadline, we're

1271
01:17:26,165 --> 01:17:29,485
Speaker 7:  just gonna let people come up with ideas and when it's ready, it's ready.

1272
01:17:29,785 --> 01:17:33,045
Speaker 7:  And then it was, you know, the best Mario in a decade. So

1273
01:17:33,425 --> 01:17:34,165
Speaker 7:  that's how it happens.

1274
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:38,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. So do you, do you think there is

1275
01:17:38,525 --> 01:17:42,245
Speaker 1:  a world in which this ever happens in, in the time that

1276
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:46,045
Speaker 1:  we're doing this? Like Nintendo's been around forever, we've given

1277
01:17:46,165 --> 01:17:49,665
Speaker 1:  up guessing what's gonna happen with Nintendo. Is this just

1278
01:17:49,755 --> 01:17:52,865
Speaker 1:  Nintendo's after you're making alarm clocks, not worrying about like live
