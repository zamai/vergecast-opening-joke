Description: For the second episode in our three-part miniseries about the future of music, Charlie Harding, a music journalist and co-host of the Switched on Pop podcast, joins the show to tell the story of Auto-Tune. He walks us through how a simple plugin became such a recognizable sound in music, why both artists and fans gravitated to the Auto-Tune sound, and why Auto-Tune has continued to grow even through backlash in the music business. Then we look ahead to AI, and try to figure out what — if any — lessons we might be able to learn about the sound and culture of the AI era to come.

00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:06,285
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the Difference Between

3
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:10,565
Speaker 1:  Reverb and De Verb. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I have decided that

4
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:13,925
Speaker 1:  I am going to relearn how to play the guitar. So I have this guitar that

5
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:17,605
Speaker 1:  sits behind me on all of my meetings and all of my podcast recordings. And

6
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:20,525
Speaker 1:  so people are often like, oh, that's cool. Do you play guitar? What's your

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,045
Speaker 1:  favorite song? Do you know Time of Your Life by Green Day? Like all this

8
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:26,805
Speaker 1:  stuff? And the answer is, I don't really play. I used to, I played a lot

9
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:29,645
Speaker 1:  when I was a kid for a long time. I was actually pretty good at it. But then

10
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:32,685
Speaker 1:  I got to that point that you get to with a lot of things where my guitar

11
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:35,685
Speaker 1:  teacher was like, you either need to try harder and care about this more,

12
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:39,925
Speaker 1:  or just quit. And So I just quit. Bad choice in

13
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,965
Speaker 1:  retrospect, but like I was 12, whatcha gonna do. But now I have this

14
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:47,485
Speaker 1:  guitar and I've decided I'm gonna remember how to play it. So I got this

15
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:51,045
Speaker 1:  app musician that people really recommend, and I really like so far.

16
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,405
Speaker 1:  It just sits here on the iPad and it tells me what to play and it actually

17
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:58,365
Speaker 1:  uses the microphone to see if I'm playing it correctly and gives you

18
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:01,725
Speaker 1:  this sort of dynamic feedback as you go. It's not as good as having like

19
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:05,285
Speaker 1:  a person to teach me, but I can do it in my basement. So I'm calling it a

20
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:09,125
Speaker 1:  victory. So far I have learned basically that this is

21
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:10,005
Speaker 1:  a C chord

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,125
Speaker 1:  and not much else, but you know, it's progress. We're we're, we're doing

23
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:18,245
Speaker 1:  it one day at a time. Anyway, that is not what we're here to talk about.

24
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:22,525
Speaker 1:  This is the second episode in our miniseries all about the future of

25
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:26,485
Speaker 1:  music. Last week we talked to Jack Coy about Track Star and basically

26
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:30,125
Speaker 1:  music content and how we as fans discover new music and how

27
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:34,165
Speaker 1:  musicians discover new fans and be in the world.

28
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:38,205
Speaker 1:  This week we're talking about a technology that I think you could argue is

29
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:42,045
Speaker 1:  the single most important thing that has happened to music in the last two

30
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:45,845
Speaker 1:  decades. And that thing is autotune. We're talking to Charlie Harding,

31
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,885
Speaker 1:  who is a longtime Vergecast contributor and a friend of the show and also

32
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:53,645
Speaker 1:  the co-host of the excellent podcast, Switched on Pop. I'll link it in the

33
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:57,205
Speaker 1:  show notes. If, you don't listen to it. You should. It's excellent. He's

34
00:01:57,205 --> 00:02:00,565
Speaker 1:  gonna tell us all about the history of autotune, how it changed music,

35
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:04,925
Speaker 1:  and maybe try to figure out with us if there's a way to take

36
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:08,485
Speaker 1:  what happened to Autotune over the last two decades and think ahead as we

37
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:12,405
Speaker 1:  get to AI and TikTok and all the other changes that are

38
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:15,725
Speaker 1:  happening to the music industry. What can we learn from what has happened

39
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:19,325
Speaker 1:  with Autotune that might give us a hint about where we're going

40
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:23,445
Speaker 1:  the next 25 years? All that is coming up in just a sec. We have a lot of

41
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:26,285
Speaker 1:  very fun songs to play. They are going to stick in your brain for months

42
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:30,285
Speaker 1:  and I'm very, very sorry about that, but it's gonna be worth it. It's gonna

43
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:33,605
Speaker 1:  be awesome. All that is coming up, but I just remembered how to play a de

44
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:36,405
Speaker 1:  chord and So. I'm gonna go do that a bunch of times and feel very good about

45
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:39,925
Speaker 1:  myself. I know two chords now. I'm basically a guitar player. This is The

46
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:41,245
Speaker 1:  Vergecast. We'll be right back.

47
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:30,325
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. Alright, let's just get into it. So Charlie Harding, like I

48
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:33,965
Speaker 1:  said, is a music journalist. He's a professor of music. He's also the

49
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:37,405
Speaker 1:  co-host of Switched on Pop, one of my absolute favorite

50
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:41,725
Speaker 1:  deep wonky music podcasts. I really cannot recommend it enough.

51
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:45,685
Speaker 1:  He's been on this show with us before talking mostly about AI music.

52
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:49,725
Speaker 1:  We did a great episode with him last fall where we tried to make a song with

53
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:53,845
Speaker 1:  AI and it got weird and very fun. He was around for the whole laser

54
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:58,005
Speaker 1:  bong craziness. We talked a lot about ai, Drake with him. We've talked

55
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:01,765
Speaker 1:  a lot about AI with Charlie. Today we're gonna talk about something different

56
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:05,445
Speaker 1:  and that is autotune. But one of the reasons I wanted to have Charlie here

57
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:09,365
Speaker 1:  to do this is that I think there might be some similarities between the

58
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:13,125
Speaker 1:  story of Autotune and the story of ai. So in order to do that,

59
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:17,005
Speaker 1:  Charlie is going to show up here and he's going to tell us the story of

60
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:20,565
Speaker 1:  autotune, how it changed music, how it changed the world, and then we're

61
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:23,805
Speaker 1:  gonna try to figure out if there's anything we can learn about what comes

62
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,365
Speaker 1:  next. So here we go. Let's just get into it. Here's my conversation with

63
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,995
Speaker 1:  Charlie Harding. Charlie Harding, welcome back to the show.

64
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:31,155
Speaker 4:  Pleasure to be here.

65
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:34,475
Speaker 1:  It's been a minute. I, this is, this is very fun. I always like having a

66
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,035
Speaker 1:  reason to talk to you, and this time it's not about like weird AI videos

67
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:38,675
Speaker 1:  on YouTube. This is very exciting for us.

68
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,835
Speaker 4:  I imagine we will get to AI because that is the topic we

69
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:45,475
Speaker 1:  Will almost, that's every topic. Get to AI videos on YouTube. I just realized

70
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:48,675
Speaker 1:  that is where we are headed here at some point, but we're gonna take a minute

71
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:52,515
Speaker 1:  to get there. Yeah. So I. I wanna start like this, this

72
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:55,675
Speaker 1:  is sort of a, a like needlessly pedantic way to start this conversation,

73
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:59,715
Speaker 1:  but I, I've realized in prepping for this that when we talk

74
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:03,435
Speaker 1:  about autotune, we're kind of talking about a bunch of things,

75
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:07,355
Speaker 1:  but also one very specific thing. So before we get into

76
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:11,235
Speaker 1:  the whole story of autotune, like yeah, what, what is autotune, what do

77
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:14,435
Speaker 1:  people mean when they refer to autotune today in 2024?

78
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:17,115
Speaker 4:  I think there's two different definitions of autotune. The sort of formal

79
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:20,795
Speaker 4:  definition is that there's a company called ANS that made

80
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:24,315
Speaker 4:  a audio software tool called Autotune

81
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:28,435
Speaker 4:  that is used to help people adjust the pitch of their vocal

82
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,315
Speaker 4:  after they have recorded it. Or actually you can even record it live into

83
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,915
Speaker 4:  autotune today. That is also an effect. People use it, it's an audio processing

84
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,395
Speaker 4:  effect and it is also, second definition

85
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,435
Speaker 4:  basically becomes synonymous with any kind of pitch correction.

86
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:47,235
Speaker 4:  There are many companies that help us do pitch correction and so

87
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:50,715
Speaker 4:  when you say autotune, you could either mean this audio plugin or you could

88
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:53,435
Speaker 4:  mean any form of pitch manipulation and correction.

89
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:57,485
Speaker 1:  Okay. So autotune is like the, the Kleenex of the space. It is, it is both

90
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:00,605
Speaker 1:  a thing, but it's also the name everybody uses to refer to everything. Kind

91
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:01,085
Speaker 1:  of like it.

92
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:01,885
Speaker 4:  Yes, exactly.

93
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,045
Speaker 1:  Okay, got it. So let's go all the way back to the beginning here. You, you

94
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:09,845
Speaker 1:  mentioned Autotune, the product. Yes. Where did it come from?

95
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,605
Speaker 4:  There are so many things in audio that have come from the military industrial

96
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:17,285
Speaker 4:  complex aerospace, and in this case the oil

97
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:21,405
Speaker 4:  industry because Autotune was invented by

98
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:25,285
Speaker 4:  a guy named Andy Hildebrand, who was a geologist who worked

99
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,325
Speaker 4:  in oil and gas. And he used techniques like the

100
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:32,685
Speaker 4:  foyer transform analysis, which is used both in

101
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:38,645
Speaker 4:  geophysics and in audio processing. And he, he

102
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:42,565
Speaker 4:  helped find oil deposits using

103
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:47,165
Speaker 4:  wave seismology tools. I, I don't quite know the science of this stuff.

104
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:51,165
Speaker 4:  I'm a music journalist and he had this idea that

105
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:54,645
Speaker 4:  he wanted to pursue his passion in music. He was a flutist

106
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:58,885
Speaker 4:  and that is one who plays the flute, just to be clear. And, and

107
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:02,725
Speaker 4:  so he, he launched this software company in the nineties and built

108
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:06,525
Speaker 4:  a tool that used some of the math and science that he had used in

109
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:10,605
Speaker 4:  oil and gas to create a pitch correction tool. Somehow the

110
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:15,285
Speaker 4:  wave technology he used to identify oil fields also applied to

111
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:19,125
Speaker 4:  how we can better Tune our vocals. So thank you Oil and gas

112
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,685
Speaker 4:  for pitch correction. If there's any reason you didn't like autotune, I just

113
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:23,565
Speaker 4:  gave you another one.

114
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:27,445
Speaker 1:  Yeah, right. It's for, for better or for worse, I have to say no single part

115
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:30,805
Speaker 1:  of that answer was remotely close to what I expected. I love it. This is

116
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:34,445
Speaker 1:  great. So how, how does it go from

117
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:38,605
Speaker 1:  like Guy Makes Science Project to actually

118
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:42,525
Speaker 1:  being used? I think brief spoiler alert, we're gonna get

119
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:46,485
Speaker 1:  to share here very quickly, but yeah, of course. Is Cher the very, very beginning

120
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:50,285
Speaker 1:  of that story or was Autotune kind of around in the industry before

121
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:50,925
Speaker 1:  Share

122
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:54,765
Speaker 4:  Happened? It's very close to share the tool

123
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,565
Speaker 4:  Autotune launches in 1997

124
00:07:58,865 --> 00:07:59,965
Speaker 4:  shares Believe,

125
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:11,085
Speaker 4:  Which is really the song where people start to recognize the effect

126
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,045
Speaker 4:  isn't until the fall of 1998. The idea

127
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:19,285
Speaker 4:  of autotune was that it would be a sort of subtle effect to

128
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:23,245
Speaker 4:  help slightly enhance a out of Tune vocal, not completely

129
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:26,005
Speaker 4:  out of Tune. Like you still had to sing pretty well in Tune, but it could

130
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,685
Speaker 4:  help sort of nudge the, the bad moments back into Tune. Hmm. And so there

131
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:33,325
Speaker 4:  certainly were some producers that were using it before Cher.

132
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:37,725
Speaker 4:  What Cher did is that she and her team took this

133
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:41,605
Speaker 4:  tool and kind of abused it. They set the settings so that

134
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,565
Speaker 4:  it pitch corrected as fast as it possibly could in such a way that

135
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:49,325
Speaker 4:  it created this, this very strange vocal effect

136
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:53,045
Speaker 4:  that they started calling the share effect. I do have to note though,

137
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:57,125
Speaker 4:  there is an important recording that came out before Cher's

138
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:01,005
Speaker 4:  belief that also had this over the top autotune

139
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:04,325
Speaker 4:  effect. And it's very unfortunate that it is

140
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:08,805
Speaker 4:  Kid Rock's only God knows why. Released a few months before Cher's

141
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:09,085
Speaker 4:  belief

142
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:12,045
Speaker 6:  Say Every man

143
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,165
Speaker 6:  like me.

144
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:19,245
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's tough. We'll give it a Cher I think, I think it's right. The

145
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:20,445
Speaker 1:  Cher absolutely gets the credit

146
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:23,325
Speaker 4:  For that one. So, and, and, and, and the thing is, that song was released

147
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:27,325
Speaker 4:  as an album cut, not as a single, but after Cher is believed. They were like,

148
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,845
Speaker 4:  oh, that's stuff that's a cool sound and we already did it. So they later

149
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:33,925
Speaker 4:  released only God knows why as a single. And so it's often heard as

150
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:37,045
Speaker 4:  having occurred after shares belief. It was technically released beforehand.

151
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:41,005
Speaker 4:  So that's fair enough. We've got oil and gas, we've got Kid Rock.

152
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,685
Speaker 4:  We're, we're just, we're hitting all the marks right now.

153
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:47,445
Speaker 1:  Some tough bedfellows on The Vergecast today. Yeah, So

154
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,525
Speaker 1:  I. It's super interesting to me that it very, at the very beginning, like

155
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:55,125
Speaker 1:  months after this thing was launched for this ostensibly pretty

156
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:56,565
Speaker 1:  straightforward purpose.

157
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:58,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Odine totally. It's

158
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:01,725
Speaker 1:  Already being used in these wild out there

159
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:05,685
Speaker 1:  surprising ways. Did it happen like that from the very beginning? Like was

160
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:09,285
Speaker 1:  it, it, it seems like it got crazy before it got

161
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,805
Speaker 1:  quiet in, in such a really interesting way with Autotune.

162
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:15,685
Speaker 4:  Well, the share effect was almost a one-off. Like some people

163
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:19,565
Speaker 4:  started to do similar-ish things. You can think of. Like

164
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,725
Speaker 4:  Madonna's music in 2000 has a sort of pitch

165
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:24,445
Speaker 4:  correction. He sound

166
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:29,965
Speaker 4:  DAF Punk's one more time in 2001 actually uses a

167
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:33,925
Speaker 4:  different pitch correction tool, but people start to mimic this effect

168
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,725
Speaker 4:  for sure. It's much more common that people are using

169
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:41,525
Speaker 4:  autotune the proper tool, this, this effect as like

170
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,045
Speaker 4:  really gentle pitch correction. And,

171
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:49,525
Speaker 4:  and so the share effect was kind of like, I think at first kind of a one-off

172
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:50,125
Speaker 4:  novelty.

173
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:55,565
Speaker 4:  People were using Autotune though. Like you can hear it very

174
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:59,685
Speaker 4:  audibly on a song like Maroon

175
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,285
Speaker 4:  Five's. She will be loved from 2002

176
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:16,165
Speaker 4:  where it was supposed to be subtly used, but there's something just like

177
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:19,205
Speaker 4:  a little bit wrong with the recording and people picked up on the fact that

178
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:23,005
Speaker 4:  like, I don't know, there's something about that vocal, which is slightly

179
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:26,685
Speaker 4:  inhuman. I can't identify it. 'cause it's not that like hard tuning

180
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:30,965
Speaker 4:  share effect. It's, it's the Auto-Tune tool, but kind

181
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:34,885
Speaker 4:  of overused. And people started to complain, oh, this is the

182
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:38,325
Speaker 4:  sign of the end of music. People aren't really singing. They're, they're

183
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:41,165
Speaker 4:  doing something after the fact too, you know, make it glossy and shey.

184
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:45,325
Speaker 1:  Fascinating. Was that the reaction to Cher even because she

185
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:49,525
Speaker 1:  was not trying to hide what was going on there? No,

186
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,325
Speaker 4:  No. Well, when you listen to the song, believe it

187
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:56,725
Speaker 4:  uses both a mix of tuning and

188
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:00,645
Speaker 4:  no tuning in the verse. She begins with

189
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:04,765
Speaker 4:  autotune on and she's sort of singing about, you know, trying to find love

190
00:12:04,855 --> 00:12:08,685
Speaker 4:  after a broken heart. And there's this sort of feeling of

191
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:10,405
Speaker 4:  like this, you know, this robotic

192
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:15,845
Speaker 4:  just going through the motions kind of person and the, the vocal tuning

193
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:19,725
Speaker 4:  almost matches the, the presentation of, of

194
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:20,205
Speaker 4:  the lyric.

195
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,605
Speaker 4:  Then as she goes into the chorus, she sings, I believe in

196
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,085
Speaker 4:  Life After Love, she actually drops the auto Tune.

197
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,245
Speaker 4:  So it's actually this creative effect in which she's saying like,

198
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:46,725
Speaker 4:  I can feel robotic and like soulless and then I can sort of break through

199
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:50,925
Speaker 4:  and shares of course an amazing vocalist. And so she turns that effect on

200
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:54,805
Speaker 4:  and off to match the lyric of the song. When

201
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:58,485
Speaker 4:  it came out though, everyone's like, whoa, what is she doing? Not like, oh,

202
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:02,645
Speaker 4:  she's not singing, but that is a very strange and cool

203
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:06,485
Speaker 4:  effect. I wanna do that too. And Shera and her producers actually misled

204
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,485
Speaker 4:  people and didn't tell them what they did really because they wanted to have

205
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:12,125
Speaker 4:  this kind of cool proprietary sound that nobody else could mimic.

206
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:16,165
Speaker 1:  That's so interesting. And at that point, autotune, I guess was new enough

207
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,765
Speaker 1:  that we hadn't already sort of explored the edges of it in that

208
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:21,445
Speaker 1:  same way? Oh

209
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:24,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah, absolutely not. This was, this was, this was totally novel to people.

210
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,725
Speaker 4:  They'd never heard a thing quite like it, but there is a whole history of

211
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:31,365
Speaker 4:  other vocal processing techniques, tools like the Vocoder

212
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:35,445
Speaker 4:  or the Talk Box, and people probably assumed, and actually the producers

213
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:38,725
Speaker 4:  misled interviewers and said, oh yeah, it's just like a voc coating tool,

214
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,725
Speaker 4:  which is a, a a a tool that actually goes back to World War ii. It was

215
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:47,005
Speaker 4:  invented as a, a way of encoding and decoding

216
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:50,205
Speaker 4:  messages to be sent under sea so they wouldn't be caught by German u-boats.

217
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:54,205
Speaker 4:  I'm telling you. Wow. Audio is like all military industrial stuff.

218
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:57,245
Speaker 4:  We wouldn't have recorded music if it weren't for, you know, early sort of

219
00:13:57,405 --> 00:14:01,045
Speaker 4:  military audio tools, but in any, in any case, they said that it was this

220
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:04,005
Speaker 4:  tool that had been around for, for decades and decades and decades so that

221
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:05,805
Speaker 4:  they could have their, you know, secret sauce.

222
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,525
Speaker 1:  That's so interesting. So real quick, just give me like the, the

223
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:13,565
Speaker 1:  technical explanation of how autotune actually works. Like you

224
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:16,845
Speaker 1:  mentioned it's, it's job ostensibly is to take

225
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,365
Speaker 1:  a pitch that you sing incorrectly and make it the correct

226
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:25,365
Speaker 1:  pitch. Yes, I understand that much. Yeah. How,

227
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,125
Speaker 1:  what else is useful to understand about how Autotune actually works

228
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:30,645
Speaker 1:  in order to understand how people use it?

229
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:34,685
Speaker 4:  Basically it's a tool that is trying to identify what pitch are

230
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:37,965
Speaker 4:  you attempting to sing, and then it does what you would call pitch

231
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:41,925
Speaker 4:  quantization, basically pushing the pitch that you are singing to the pitch

232
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:45,805
Speaker 4:  that you're trying to sing. And you can do this at different

233
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:49,885
Speaker 4:  speeds. So if I'm singing here, but I'm

234
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:50,405
Speaker 4:  trying to sing here,

235
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:55,765
Speaker 4:  it would go, it would sort of glide you to your pitch.

236
00:14:56,185 --> 00:15:00,005
Speaker 4:  And when we think of the share effect or the autotune effect that

237
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:03,565
Speaker 4:  is turning that pitch speed all the way down to zero, meaning it

238
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:07,445
Speaker 4:  automatically, immediately jumps your voice from one pitch to another. And

239
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:11,325
Speaker 4:  when it does that, it creates this sort of digital artifacting that is

240
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:15,165
Speaker 4:  unnatural. It is strange, and it is now

241
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,485
Speaker 4:  very desirable. People like this sound and

242
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:22,925
Speaker 4:  intentionally bake it into how they sing because it is a fun,

243
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:23,645
Speaker 4:  creative effect.

244
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:28,165
Speaker 1:  Got it. Okay. But in, in theory, it really is just that simple of

245
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:31,605
Speaker 1:  like, you, you have a pitch and you have a pitch that you want and

246
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,445
Speaker 1:  Autotune makes those the same thing.

247
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:36,245
Speaker 4:  Yes. Okay. And you can say how, how fast does it do it? You can maybe add

248
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:39,005
Speaker 4:  some vibrato, there's all these little, you know, fine Tune parameters, but

249
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,485
Speaker 4:  basically fix my pitch. Okay. And you do this by sort of saying, I'm trying

250
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:46,085
Speaker 4:  to sing in this scale, and you set your scale

251
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,525
Speaker 4:  and then it just knows that, hey, you're singing way off your scale. Let,

252
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,565
Speaker 4:  let me, lemme fix that for you.

253
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:55,085
Speaker 1:  Okay. So in sort of that basic definition of it, I can actually

254
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,845
Speaker 1:  understand why Autotune, if it worked

255
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,565
Speaker 1:  at the beginning, and it sounds like it did, would be an immediate gigantic

256
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,485
Speaker 1:  hit. Right. And like it, from the way you describe it, it sounds like it

257
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,805
Speaker 1:  was like, you, you talk about Madonna, you talk about Maroon five, you talk

258
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:12,645
Speaker 1:  about like these are Yeah. A plus list artists who are using

259
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:16,605
Speaker 1:  autotune basically immediately did this thing just like come out and

260
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:17,725
Speaker 1:  take over the music industry.

261
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:21,965
Speaker 4:  I mean it definitely today is used on the majority of recordings. And I said,

262
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:25,605
Speaker 4:  when I say majority, I mean like over 90% of recordings. The only

263
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:28,885
Speaker 4:  recordings that won't use autotune are probably going to be, and I should

264
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:32,325
Speaker 4:  say use some kind of pitch correction. The only recordings that don't use

265
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:36,245
Speaker 4:  pitch correction would be like a very naturalistic rock song, maybe an

266
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,205
Speaker 4:  indie song. You certainly certain rappers who are not singing use it, but

267
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:43,165
Speaker 4:  the majority of, of any song vocals using autotune when it came out

268
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:46,005
Speaker 4:  the gate. Sure. I mean, anytime that somebody needed to post process fix

269
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,845
Speaker 4:  something that was outta Tune autotune was the tool to use. There have been

270
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:53,645
Speaker 4:  tools for Quantizing rhythm that had existed before

271
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:57,205
Speaker 4:  Autotune so that you could say, Hey, you meant to hit the snare here, but

272
00:16:57,205 --> 00:17:01,045
Speaker 4:  you actually hit it a little bit late. Let's nudge it back over. And so producers

273
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:04,885
Speaker 4:  have always wanted to find ways to fix pi pitch

274
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:08,805
Speaker 4:  problems and, and they actually had really challenging slow ways

275
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:12,645
Speaker 4:  of fixing pitch all the way back into the seventies where you would go into

276
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:15,645
Speaker 4:  a piece of tape, there were digital processors you would send it to and you

277
00:17:15,645 --> 00:17:18,725
Speaker 4:  could like nudge one little note a little bit. Oh wow. North or south of

278
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:22,325
Speaker 4:  where it's supposed to land. It was very slow and laborious. So

279
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:26,085
Speaker 4:  people have been always trying to perfect recordings that are slightly

280
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:29,445
Speaker 4:  imperfect to, to make them, you know, more Exactly. In key

281
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:34,125
Speaker 1:  So I. I just, I keep coming back to the share thing. Yeah. Because it's like,

282
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:37,245
Speaker 1:  I'm so fascinated by the idea of like a lot of what you just described are

283
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:41,325
Speaker 1:  sort of tools in a producer's toolkit, right? Yes. Like things

284
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:44,965
Speaker 1:  that in theory aren't sort of front and center in the

285
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:48,245
Speaker 1:  recording. They're just designed to like solve a set of problems that you

286
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:52,205
Speaker 1:  have. And I, I think there was clearly a lot

287
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:56,045
Speaker 1:  of that in how autotune is used and still is. And I think like to your point,

288
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,485
Speaker 1:  it not every song sounds like believe, but if every song has autotune, like

289
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:03,205
Speaker 1:  that's, it's being used in the way it's supposed to. Yeah. But also it

290
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:06,925
Speaker 1:  became an instrument in a very real way. Oh yeah. In a way

291
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,085
Speaker 1:  that most of these technological things don't.

292
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,565
Speaker 4:  Right. And that's thanks to T-Pain, right? So like it goes from being the

293
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:17,605
Speaker 4:  Cher Effect to becoming the T-Pain Effect T-Pain who like Cher

294
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:18,485
Speaker 4:  Great singer,

295
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:22,845
Speaker 1:  Which no one knew forever, by the way. My favorite thing about T-Pain, like

296
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:25,965
Speaker 1:  everybody knew Cher could sing before she did believe, but we spent like

297
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:29,245
Speaker 1:  a decade being like, oh, T-Pain can't sing and it's all because of auto T.

298
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:33,165
Speaker 4:  Right? Right. So Cher puts up believe in 1998, fast forward

299
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:36,885
Speaker 4:  to 2005 T Payne's I'm Sprung is one of the first time that people

300
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,565
Speaker 4:  hear this effect in the world of r and b.

301
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:51,565
Speaker 4:  And it goes from being the share effect to being the T-Pain effect. And pretty

302
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:55,405
Speaker 4:  quickly it becomes the sort of way that

303
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:59,285
Speaker 4:  people sing in particular, it gives rappers the capacity of sing.

304
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:03,005
Speaker 4:  And there are a number of early recordings, but the one

305
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:06,725
Speaker 4:  that really sort of lands it for folks is Kanye's eight oh Eights in

306
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:09,285
Speaker 4:  Heartbreak, the song Heartless in 2008.

307
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:20,165
Speaker 4:  All of a sudden Kanye who, you know, he's not a particularly strong singer,

308
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:24,645
Speaker 4:  has the capacity to hit a pitch and sing melodies.

309
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:28,405
Speaker 4:  Once that track is out the gate, every rapper

310
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:32,165
Speaker 4:  realizes that they have the opportunity to start embedding hooks

311
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,405
Speaker 4:  into their music. And you know, oftentimes it is the chorus hook that people

312
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:39,605
Speaker 4:  sing. And so I I I would say from

313
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:44,485
Speaker 4:  to T-Pain to Kanye and then everybody,

314
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,925
Speaker 4:  it, that's really, it's really in the sort of late

315
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:52,205
Speaker 4:  aughts that the Auto-Tune effect becomes

316
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:56,325
Speaker 4:  ubiquitous. It takes more than a decade from shares belief

317
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:59,845
Speaker 4:  before people start using it as in the same way they might use

318
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:03,605
Speaker 4:  distortion or reverb. It just becomes another tool in the

319
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:07,205
Speaker 4:  toolbox that people are using as this overblown effect,

320
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:08,925
Speaker 4:  not the gentle version of it.

321
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:13,045
Speaker 1:  Right. But I guess one key difference is that

322
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,405
Speaker 1:  at least to my knowledge, yeah, and you're, you're much more in this than

323
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:20,045
Speaker 1:  I am, but I don't remember there being a huge cultural backlash against

324
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:24,325
Speaker 1:  reverb. And yet there, there have been at least

325
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:27,805
Speaker 1:  a co, at least a couple that I can remember of sort of big

326
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:32,525
Speaker 1:  loud angry moments where the music industry or someone big in the

327
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:36,485
Speaker 1:  music industry said, you know, we have to get rid of autotune. It's

328
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,245
Speaker 1:  ruining everything. It is destroying this thing. We believe in. What, just

329
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:43,885
Speaker 1:  before we get into all it, make the case against autotune, like If, you were

330
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,645
Speaker 1:  put yourself in the position, you Charlie Harding, hate

331
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,885
Speaker 4:  Autotune and think it should be excised from the earth. Tell me why.

332
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:52,245
Speaker 4:  I guess

333
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:56,635
Speaker 4:  you could say that autotune

334
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:01,355
Speaker 4:  homogenizes the voice. I'm having trouble saying this 'cause I actually don't

335
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:04,715
Speaker 4:  believe it, but like, we're just gonna clip that part and just, just play

336
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:08,675
Speaker 4:  it. That's okay. Perfect. Yeah, like someone's unique

337
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:12,195
Speaker 4:  vocal identity is the way that they hit a pitch.

338
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:16,435
Speaker 4:  Not, not nobody sings perfectly in pitch. We all scoop into our notes.

339
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:20,195
Speaker 4:  We use vibrato differently and autotune sort of, you know,

340
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:24,075
Speaker 4:  carves out all of those imperfections. Part of what makes

341
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:28,155
Speaker 4:  us sound like ourselves makes us sound human. And so

342
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:31,795
Speaker 4:  you could say that, yeah, it's a homogenizing tool. You could also say that,

343
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:36,795
Speaker 4:  you know, prince Stars who don't have

344
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:41,395
Speaker 4:  proper vocal training and technique, but you know, that's

345
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:45,195
Speaker 4:  like the history of rock and roll are people who were not trained singers,

346
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:49,115
Speaker 4:  right. Who sing properly with all their air and you know, oh, but

347
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:52,195
Speaker 4:  like rather have personality to their voice and maybe intentionally don't

348
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:56,195
Speaker 4:  sing. Like Henry Rollins is a great example. Like the entire word of like

349
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:59,955
Speaker 4:  punk music is not about singing properly. So I think both of this, these

350
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,755
Speaker 4:  arguments of it homogenizes the voice and it allows people who don't sing

351
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,195
Speaker 4:  well to be stars are probably the, the primary

352
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:10,835
Speaker 4:  criticisms in the aughts after Kanye's record

353
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:14,675
Speaker 4:  as more and more people start to copy the sound. There were plenty of critics

354
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:17,315
Speaker 4:  who are just like, everyone's starting to sound the same. That's the age

355
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:20,275
Speaker 4:  old criticism of all popular music. Yeah. You know, everyone sounds the same.

356
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,555
Speaker 4:  There are still plenty of, you know, boomer YouTubers who like to talk about

357
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:28,275
Speaker 4:  how autotune is still ruining music. And the reality is that

358
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:32,155
Speaker 4:  autotune only becomes more popular after that era. Listeners want

359
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:36,035
Speaker 4:  more of it. It's not some cabal of music executives being like,

360
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:39,675
Speaker 4:  ha ha ha ha, we are going to give autotune to the people. But rather it's

361
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:42,995
Speaker 4:  like, clearly people are listening to this music and they want more of it.

362
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:47,375
Speaker 4:  The counter argument to autotune, homogenizing

363
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:51,295
Speaker 4:  voices is that like If, you listen to Drake's passion,

364
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:51,655
Speaker 4:  fruit

365
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:52,655
Speaker 9:  Passion

366
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:57,535
Speaker 9:  passive, you said

367
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:01,615
Speaker 4:  It does not sound like Charlie XC X is 360. Yeah.

368
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:05,375
Speaker 10:  360. When you're in, you see when you're mirror,

369
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,895
Speaker 10:  you're just looking at me everywhere. I'm so,

370
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,975
Speaker 4:  It does not sound like Travis Scott's sicko mode

371
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:16,135
Speaker 11:  Made this ice in Booth at the gate outside

372
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:16,575
Speaker 11:  when

373
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:22,855
Speaker 4:  Like, you can still identify who people are. And I I love that about

374
00:23:22,855 --> 00:23:26,695
Speaker 4:  Autotune is that actually it's what you do with it that makes it your

375
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:30,735
Speaker 4:  own way of recording. I think about it kind of like, you know, when you,

376
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:34,655
Speaker 4:  when you pick up an old style phone, there's all kinds of ways that

377
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:38,255
Speaker 4:  the voice is being processed. All the low end information and the high end

378
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:41,055
Speaker 4:  information is being cut off and all of the dynamic

379
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:45,965
Speaker 4:  volume changes are also being squashed and compressed. And they're doing

380
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:49,845
Speaker 4:  that to save data on their, on networks. And yet, like, I

381
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,645
Speaker 4:  mean, If, you call me on the phone, I would immediately know it's your voice

382
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,765
Speaker 4:  and not Eli's voice. Right? Right. Like the ear

383
00:23:58,225 --> 00:24:01,445
Speaker 4:  is so meltable to whatever effects that we use to change it.

384
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:06,325
Speaker 4:  I think that's awesome. So I think where Autotune goes from here

385
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:10,075
Speaker 4:  is that people learn to use this effect to

386
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:14,035
Speaker 4:  enhance their own creativity, their own artistry.

387
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:17,875
Speaker 4:  Artists like Drake start embedding really

388
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:22,235
Speaker 4:  great hooks in his raps because

389
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:26,355
Speaker 4:  he can now sing in ways that he couldn't otherwise. He's not a, you know,

390
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:30,235
Speaker 4:  he, he's not a great vocalist. He's a great rapper and he's a greatist.

391
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:34,355
Speaker 4:  But like, again, he is not trained to be a great vocalist. Right. Singer.

392
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:38,675
Speaker 4:  You know, we don't get Travis Scott without autotune. I you don't get Charlie

393
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:42,555
Speaker 4:  xx without Autotune. People end up using this Tune this this sound very creatively

394
00:24:42,575 --> 00:24:43,435
Speaker 4:  and it explodes.

395
00:24:43,905 --> 00:24:47,475
Speaker 1:  Okay. And do you think of it in, in your own

396
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:52,075
Speaker 1:  world and work as sort of spiritually different from any

397
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:55,875
Speaker 1:  other tool that in, in a, in a toolkit that a producer

398
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:59,635
Speaker 1:  or an artist has? Like is it, does it belong on the same level as reverb

399
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:01,835
Speaker 1:  and distortion or is it something else entirely?

400
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,965
Speaker 4:  I think about it as a producer and as an educator in music as just

401
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:10,765
Speaker 4:  another tool in the toolbox for sure. I think that a lot of

402
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:13,805
Speaker 4:  the backlash has to do with this question of like, what is human and what

403
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:17,605
Speaker 4:  is inhuman? The synthesizer had the same kind of backlash in its

404
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:21,525
Speaker 4:  development that, oh, it's not a real person playing a real instrument.

405
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:25,045
Speaker 4:  This is mechanical. It doesn't sound as expressive. I mean, clearly those

406
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:28,165
Speaker 4:  critics also lost the plot because the synthesizer is one of the predominant

407
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:32,045
Speaker 4:  sounds of popular music. I think about it as just a normal effect

408
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:35,645
Speaker 4:  that anybody can use and one that should be used

409
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:38,845
Speaker 4:  creatively to enhance the feeling of a song.

410
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:43,205
Speaker 1:  Okay. How has Autotune changed? It's what, 27 years old

411
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:46,485
Speaker 1:  now? Yeah. Is it, is it functionally still the same piece of software it

412
00:25:46,485 --> 00:25:48,485
Speaker 1:  was in the nineties or has it? Sure,

413
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:52,365
Speaker 4:  Sure. There, there are many. Autotune is a

414
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:56,125
Speaker 4:  software developer, thus they need to constantly new things.

415
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:56,725
Speaker 4:  They gotta

416
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:58,245
Speaker 1:  Show quarterly growth, man. Yeah.

417
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:01,525
Speaker 4:  You gotta keep buying the next version. So I think, I don't know, we're well

418
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:03,885
Speaker 4:  past Autotune XI can't remember what version we're on

419
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,965
Speaker 1:  Right now. Yeah. Their engagement metrics are off the charts. There's like

420
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:07,285
Speaker 1:  a social network in there somewhere.

421
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,365
Speaker 4:  Oh, they have, they have a subscription service. They've got everything.

422
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:15,405
Speaker 4:  The reality is that actually a lot of people still like the autotune effect

423
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:19,445
Speaker 4:  of yesteryear. And so If, you use autotune today

424
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:23,245
Speaker 4:  and you buy the latest version of it. You can turn on classic mode so you

425
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:26,405
Speaker 4:  can actually go back to how it used to sound. That's amazing. Autotune today

426
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:31,085
Speaker 4:  is much more naturalistic. It does a better job of tuning your vocal in

427
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:34,885
Speaker 4:  ways that are less obvious, but the effect, the autotune effect that people

428
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,765
Speaker 4:  love, whether it's with T-Pain or Cher or Kanye, whoever, what you like is

429
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,565
Speaker 4:  that hard tuning the thing which is inhuman and you like to, to

430
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:45,445
Speaker 4:  play with it. And so most people actually will just go back to the classic

431
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:45,845
Speaker 4:  mode.

432
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:50,125
Speaker 1:  Alright, I wanna talk about more about where we are right now with

433
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,245
Speaker 1:  Autotune But. first we gotta take a quick break. We'll be right back.

434
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:44,965
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Charlie Harding still here. Hi Charlie. Hello So.

435
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:49,485
Speaker 1:  I. Wanna talk about Autotune kind of right now, because I

436
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:52,485
Speaker 1:  think you, you've mentioned this a little bit a couple of times, but I think

437
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:56,525
Speaker 1:  the idea that the existence of Autotune has a changed

438
00:27:57,105 --> 00:28:01,085
Speaker 1:  the kinds of music that people are like able to make who didn't

439
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:05,125
Speaker 1:  have certain kinds of skills or whatever before, but also the kinds of people

440
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:09,125
Speaker 1:  who might be coming into the music industry has changed. So, I. I'm

441
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,645
Speaker 1:  curious, If, you look at sort of the the sweep of like who is making music

442
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:16,485
Speaker 1:  and the music that they're making. Can you look at it as like autotune

443
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:19,725
Speaker 1:  changed all of this, the fact that autotune is everywhere and can make anyone

444
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:22,925
Speaker 1:  singing sound pretty good? Like has that changed

445
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:25,265
Speaker 1:  the entire music universe?

446
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:28,425
Speaker 4:  I kind of think about it more like the development of the electric guitar.

447
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:31,425
Speaker 4:  It was like a new instrument that people could pick up and it created this

448
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:35,145
Speaker 4:  new sound. And So I think produ young

449
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:38,505
Speaker 4:  producers today want to sound like autotune

450
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,785
Speaker 4:  just as in the sixties. They want it to sound like Hendrix. Right? Like

451
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:46,985
Speaker 4:  it's the sound that is attractive. And so yeah,

452
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:50,305
Speaker 4:  it does let anybody sing, but it only lets people sing if they can't sing

453
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:52,705
Speaker 4:  with the autotune effect. And that's probably the thing that they're going

454
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:53,305
Speaker 4:  for anyway.

455
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:58,035
Speaker 1:  It's slightly surprising by the way that that that sound has

456
00:28:58,035 --> 00:29:01,595
Speaker 1:  been popular for this long, right? Like we're, we're, yeah, we're a long

457
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:05,515
Speaker 1:  way into this world and decades. Again, you go all the way

458
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:09,355
Speaker 1:  back to, to T-Pain in the early OTTs and share even before that

459
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:12,795
Speaker 1:  and like, yeah. The idea that people like the sound of autotune has lasted

460
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:13,755
Speaker 1:  a really long time.

461
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:17,635
Speaker 4:  That's why it's more like a guitar or a distortion effect.

462
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:21,715
Speaker 4:  It's, it's a feeling that it gives people, it's not about vocal tuning,

463
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:24,435
Speaker 4:  like this is, this is what gets people angry. They're like, ah, it makes

464
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:27,075
Speaker 4:  you inhuman. But no, no, no, no, no. It's like the electric guitar is also

465
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:30,835
Speaker 4:  unreal, right? Like it's generating electrical signals that has to be amplified

466
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,715
Speaker 4:  by an amplifier. It doesn't have all the acoustic properties of a beautiful

467
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:37,635
Speaker 4:  acoustic guitar, but it also sings and speaks in its own unique way. And

468
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:40,155
Speaker 4:  so that's how I think about it. And I think that young people wanting to

469
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:43,485
Speaker 4:  produce music want to sound like autotune. I mean,

470
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:47,885
Speaker 4:  truly when you record with autotune today, it's not a post-processing

471
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:51,925
Speaker 4:  technique. I mentioned it earlier, people put autotune on their vocal

472
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:56,485
Speaker 4:  from the get go, and they're trying to play with the effect to get it

473
00:29:56,485 --> 00:30:00,365
Speaker 4:  to do this weird artifacting thing. This, they, they

474
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:04,205
Speaker 4:  like all the things that it does imprecisely. That's why

475
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:08,045
Speaker 4:  they use the classic mode. They want it to sound like this thing from 1998.

476
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:11,805
Speaker 4:  They don't want it to sound like a, a pristine, pure tool that allows

477
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:13,325
Speaker 4:  'em to sing better. It's not about that.

478
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,285
Speaker 1:  Interesting. So explain that to me a little bit because I think one, one

479
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:20,605
Speaker 1:  thing I've read a bunch is that one big shift was when

480
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:25,125
Speaker 1:  autotune went from a thing you did in post after you laid down

481
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,805
Speaker 1:  a vocal track, like a, it it was a, it was a post-processing tool to

482
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:32,845
Speaker 1:  now something that you do live in the beginning. Yes. And

483
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:36,005
Speaker 1:  there was a, there was a line in the, there's a really good pitchfork story

484
00:30:36,005 --> 00:30:37,925
Speaker 1:  that you sent me about the history of autotune

485
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:39,765
Speaker 4:  Oh, by Simon Reynolds. Yeah. It's spectacular.

486
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:43,525
Speaker 1:  There's a line in there that's basically like, there are a lot of singers

487
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:46,445
Speaker 1:  who have never heard their takes without autotune. Oh yeah. That is like

488
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:49,845
Speaker 1:  just my, my brain exploded thinking about that. And so Yeah.

489
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:53,805
Speaker 1:  But you, you mentioned like thinking differently about the way that they're

490
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:57,845
Speaker 1:  actually making this stuff in real time because of autotune. Yeah. What does

491
00:30:57,845 --> 00:31:01,245
Speaker 1:  that look like? Like what, what would it be like in the studio to record

492
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:04,845
Speaker 1:  in a, in a sort of immediately post autotune universe?

493
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:09,335
Speaker 4:  I mean, people do this not just in studios, but in home bedrooms. I mean,

494
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,775
Speaker 4:  the biggest stars in the world where intentionally travel to Hawaii to record

495
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:15,335
Speaker 4:  and record in an Airbnb, they bring a microphone, they bring a

496
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:19,135
Speaker 4:  portable, small recording interface. Oftentimes they'll use one

497
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:22,975
Speaker 4:  called the Universal Audio Apollo that allows you to

498
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:26,855
Speaker 4:  run autotune on this little interface live without any

499
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:29,375
Speaker 4:  sort of latency so that when you're speaking into your microphone, you just

500
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:33,295
Speaker 4:  hear yourself through autotune. And then they

501
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:37,055
Speaker 4:  are singing, trying to get it to do things that make weird

502
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:40,855
Speaker 4:  auto Tune sounds. I am bad at singing with autotune. Here's the thing, like

503
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:43,895
Speaker 4:  you actually have to be good at using the effect to make it sound right?

504
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:47,735
Speaker 4:  Mm. You have to intentionally sing slightly out of Tune to get it to sort

505
00:31:47,735 --> 00:31:50,095
Speaker 4:  of bend back into Tune. You have to

506
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:53,415
Speaker 1:  So If you sing. Well, it actually, it doesn't get to do anything. So it doesn't

507
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:53,895
Speaker 1:  work.

508
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:56,695
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's not gonna be interesting. Yeah. I, I don't, I don sing well, by

509
00:31:56,695 --> 00:32:00,215
Speaker 4:  the way, I'm not a vocalist, but like, I am not good at using autotune to

510
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:03,535
Speaker 4:  make it sound fun and creative. You actually have to be talented at using

511
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:06,855
Speaker 4:  autotune and practice with it. So yeah, it's something you like, bake into

512
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:10,935
Speaker 4:  the sound before it even goes into your software. Like you can't turn

513
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:14,815
Speaker 4:  it off after the fact. Now, I mean, you, some people still do, but like,

514
00:32:15,015 --> 00:32:17,215
Speaker 4:  a lot of people don't want to hear what their voice sounds like without it

515
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:19,815
Speaker 4:  on This is what I'm saying, where it's like, I think of it more like the

516
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:24,015
Speaker 4:  electric guitar because to play electric guitar with a lot of

517
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:27,655
Speaker 4:  distortion is fundamentally different than playing classical guitar.

518
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:31,135
Speaker 4:  And If, you ask a classical guitarist to play a super distorted electric

519
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:34,415
Speaker 4:  guitar, they might not be able to control all the feedback that it creates.

520
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:38,495
Speaker 4:  They might not be aware of how to get it to sing properly and vice

521
00:32:38,495 --> 00:32:42,405
Speaker 4:  versa. You know, a like a fast lead guitarist, an electric guitar might

522
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:45,125
Speaker 4:  sound absolutely terrible on an acoustic guitar. It's a skill that you have

523
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,805
Speaker 4:  to learn to sing into autotune.

524
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:50,485
Speaker 1:  So you ac you actually think of singing into autotune and singing

525
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:54,165
Speaker 1:  without autotune as two just utterly different skills.

526
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:59,645
Speaker 4:  I think that they are related skills. Sure. But to make autotune sound

527
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,805
Speaker 4:  good, I think you gotta be good at it. Again, it doesn't necessarily mean

528
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:05,885
Speaker 4:  you have to, I'm not, I'm, I'm not arguing that you have to go to music school

529
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:08,605
Speaker 4:  to learn how to do this, but you have to practice at it. Like it takes time.

530
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:11,285
Speaker 4:  It's a skill that you have to develop as a musician. And when I do it, I

531
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:15,205
Speaker 4:  don't sound good. It is common that people will use autotune to

532
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,805
Speaker 4:  practice melodies and, you know, use it as a way of

533
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:22,565
Speaker 4:  dealing with the fact that they aren't good vocalists. But I, I, again, I

534
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:26,365
Speaker 4:  think that If, you wanna sound like T-Pain. You have to practice

535
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:30,245
Speaker 4:  singing like T-Pain. Yeah. Yeah. And again, T-Pain is a great vocalist. Cher

536
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:31,005
Speaker 4:  is a great vocalist.

537
00:33:31,985 --> 00:33:35,675
Speaker 1:  They're just not doing the same thing as, you know, Frank Sinatra was decades

538
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:35,995
Speaker 1:  ago.

539
00:33:36,025 --> 00:33:38,315
Speaker 4:  It's just, yeah. It's just a different way of singing. Yeah.

540
00:33:38,795 --> 00:33:41,155
Speaker 1:  I feel like there are gonna be some people who hate that, but I find that

541
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:42,075
Speaker 1:  kind of fascinating. I love

542
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:44,075
Speaker 4:  That. I think there are a lot of people that are not gonna like what I just

543
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,155
Speaker 4:  said, but I really believe it.

544
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:48,035
Speaker 1:  We'll put Charlie's email in the show notes. You could tell it yourself.

545
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:52,635
Speaker 4:  Thank you. I just, I mean, I just know this through practice of working

546
00:33:52,635 --> 00:33:56,515
Speaker 4:  with musicians in studios and some people are really good

547
00:33:56,515 --> 00:33:58,115
Speaker 4:  at using autotune and other people aren't.

548
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:02,555
Speaker 1:  Yeah. What, how does that pertain to live music? Is

549
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:05,555
Speaker 1:  it the same, is it the same sort of thing? Like as, as Autotune has gotten

550
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:08,795
Speaker 1:  more powerful, it's just present, live the same way it is in recordings and

551
00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:09,995
Speaker 1:  it's fine. Once

552
00:34:09,995 --> 00:34:13,955
Speaker 4:  Again, there are both ways of using Autotune live. Some

553
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:17,675
Speaker 4:  people need to have that effect on when they sing because like if you're

554
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:21,515
Speaker 4:  Travis Scott and you're performing live in concert, that is your sound. So

555
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:26,115
Speaker 4:  they developed, Ontario's developed an autotune live tool that

556
00:34:26,115 --> 00:34:30,075
Speaker 4:  you can run, you know, through your microphone on a live stage. It's not

557
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:33,115
Speaker 4:  baked into the microphone. It's an effect down the, you know, audio chain

558
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:36,835
Speaker 4:  at some point. Sure. There is also Autotune Live used for

559
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:41,155
Speaker 4:  that subtle vocal tuning to help people, you know, when you're running around

560
00:34:41,155 --> 00:34:43,515
Speaker 4:  on stage, it's exhausting. You might be outta breath, you're not hitting

561
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:47,275
Speaker 4:  your pitches as effectively. There's all kinds of ways that vocals are enhanced

562
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:50,955
Speaker 4:  to sound more like the original recording. You know, subtle auto tuning

563
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,155
Speaker 4:  is one version of that. Also, playing backing tracks of like a thousand

564
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:58,395
Speaker 4:  chorus vocals that are perfectly already in Tune is another way that things

565
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:01,235
Speaker 4:  sound more in Tune when you're at a live recording. Yeah.

566
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:05,355
Speaker 1:  So you, you sing the one, but there's 50 other yous singing it correctly

567
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:06,115
Speaker 1:  around you. Yeah, yeah,

568
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:06,435
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Exactly.

569
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:08,835
Speaker 1:  I want that every time I sing. That sounds great.

570
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,435
Speaker 4:  I know, totally. It's like I always want my backing tracks. Yeah, that's

571
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:14,355
Speaker 4:  because people expect the recordings that they hear and when you listen to

572
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:17,435
Speaker 4:  your favorite artists, they're usually in the chorus singing at least

573
00:35:18,905 --> 00:35:22,755
Speaker 4:  nine versions of the track to add depth with

574
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:26,955
Speaker 4:  Coing. Like the thing that just makes it sound big and awesome and, you

575
00:35:26,955 --> 00:35:30,755
Speaker 4:  know, bringing eight extra backup singers on tour is expensive. So we might

576
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:33,515
Speaker 4:  just play the backing track and add a little tuning to your vocal 'cause

577
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:37,245
Speaker 4:  you're outta breath. Yeah. So those are all different ways that people use

578
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:40,765
Speaker 4:  autotune Live. Either the autotune effect or the sort of more subtle pitch

579
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:41,685
Speaker 4:  correction version of it.

580
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:46,005
Speaker 1:  What's the like simplest, most mainstream version of that

581
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:49,805
Speaker 1:  at this point? I think about the, the, maybe video is a good

582
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:53,645
Speaker 1:  metaphor, right? Where at the very high end you have super high end

583
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:57,205
Speaker 1:  video editing software, but we've boiled it all the way down to like, you

584
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:00,965
Speaker 1:  can edit pretty successfully inside of TikTok and it has made it available

585
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:04,045
Speaker 1:  to tons of people who are doing tons of different things. Do we have that

586
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:08,005
Speaker 1:  equivalent for autotune? Like is that just available to regular people

587
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,725
Speaker 1:  in the way that like Instagram filters are?

588
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:13,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean there are iPhone apps that are like the autotune effect that

589
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:17,725
Speaker 4:  have been developed by the Gregory Brothers who famously made

590
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:18,965
Speaker 4:  autotune the news years ago.

591
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:25,365
Speaker 12:  We Looking, you, we, you, we find you

592
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,805
Speaker 4:  If, you buy Apple's Logic, which is their like audio

593
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:34,645
Speaker 4:  recording software. It comes with their own free version of pitch correction.

594
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:39,085
Speaker 4:  Every software developer that makes audio tools has tried to

595
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:43,325
Speaker 4:  make their own autotune effect and they are cheaper than the on

596
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:46,765
Speaker 4:  Tara's version. So there's all kinds of way of getting into autotune If.

597
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:48,845
Speaker 4:  you wanna try to autotune your vocals. It's very accessible.

598
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:52,845
Speaker 1:  Okay. And is that, is that a good thing? I feel like you, you would argue

599
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:54,045
Speaker 1:  that's a good thing. Yeah. Yeah.

600
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,485
Speaker 4:  I don't know. It's like, are you trying to argue that there should be like

601
00:36:56,535 --> 00:37:00,245
Speaker 4:  fewer paint brushes and paints in the world so that we can have more Monets?

602
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:03,605
Speaker 4:  I don't like, I think more creative tools for more people is great.

603
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:08,085
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I, I I support it. So I, there is one sort

604
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:12,005
Speaker 1:  of new backlash to Yeah. This that I, I'm, I've been thinking about

605
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:15,805
Speaker 1:  a lot and I'm, I'm curious to get your feedback on. So one thing I see on,

606
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:19,725
Speaker 1:  on TikTok and Instagram and everywhere else these days is like

607
00:37:19,975 --> 00:37:23,605
Speaker 1:  these videos of singers in their kitchen

608
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:27,805
Speaker 1:  or in like a garage or just wandering down the street singing

609
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:31,965
Speaker 1:  these, these beautiful soulful melodies. Do you, do you know the ones

610
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:34,565
Speaker 1:  I'm talking about? There's this one that's like a guy with a salt and pepper

611
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:37,605
Speaker 1:  beard and he's just pouring coffee and his girlfriend is standing behind

612
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:41,085
Speaker 1:  him and he just starts singing into an AirPod. And it sounds incredible.

613
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,845
Speaker 1:  And I'm like, first of all, the, the way I know this isn't real is because

614
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:56,765
Speaker 1:  AirPods don't sound like that. Yeah. And you're lying. But like, all

615
00:37:56,765 --> 00:38:00,685
Speaker 1:  that aside, there's been this really fascinating thing where a bunch of

616
00:38:00,685 --> 00:38:04,605
Speaker 1:  singers have come up and gotten a lot of, a lot of fans

617
00:38:04,605 --> 00:38:07,885
Speaker 1:  and a lot of fame and like record deals and some stuff out of these social

618
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,605
Speaker 1:  videos. It's, it's a very like, natural, you know, musician creator

619
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:15,565
Speaker 1:  way to come up. But then in every single one of their

620
00:38:15,565 --> 00:38:19,405
Speaker 1:  videos there is this giant comment section saying,

621
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:22,325
Speaker 1:  oh, they're using autotune. I'd love to hear what it sounds like without

622
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:26,165
Speaker 1:  autotune. Ugh, it's autotune. And it's like, on the one hand,

623
00:38:27,415 --> 00:38:30,645
Speaker 1:  maybe the argument is who cares? But on the other hand, it's like we're in

624
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:33,245
Speaker 1:  this moment where authenticity is everything. Yeah, totally. And totally.

625
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:37,165
Speaker 1:  Also you're standing in your kitchen singing. So the idea that I'm supposed

626
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:41,125
Speaker 1:  to process this like a professional recording Yeah. It, it, there's

627
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:44,365
Speaker 1:  a disconnect there that I have always struggled to wrap my head around how

628
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:48,085
Speaker 1:  I'm supposed to feel about this. And I, I'm curious, like if if they were

629
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:50,605
Speaker 1:  playing an electric guitar, I'd be able to see the electric guitar, right?

630
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:52,845
Speaker 1:  Sure. So, I'm, I'm curious how you think about How Auto Tune is supposed

631
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,965
Speaker 1:  to fit in that version of music that we're in right now.

632
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:57,365
Speaker 1:  Well,

633
00:38:57,365 --> 00:39:00,845
Speaker 4:  I think autotune has become a sort of like catchall for any sound that is

634
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:04,725
Speaker 4:  post-processing that makes things sound more perfect than they are. Yeah.

635
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:07,365
Speaker 4:  So for example, like if I'm singing in my kitchen, there's gonna be a bunch

636
00:39:07,365 --> 00:39:09,485
Speaker 4:  of reverb and it's gonna sound really bad, but there's all kinds of tools

637
00:39:09,485 --> 00:39:13,405
Speaker 4:  you can use to get rid of reverb after the fact. There are

638
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:16,645
Speaker 4:  ways that you can use just EQ and compression and other very common tools

639
00:39:16,665 --> 00:39:20,565
Speaker 4:  and post-processing to make your, your voice sound better. So even if

640
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:24,125
Speaker 4:  I record with an iPhone, I can get my iPhone to sound

641
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:27,845
Speaker 4:  pretty close to a professional recording by having

642
00:39:28,155 --> 00:39:31,925
Speaker 4:  good post-processing tools. I So I, think autotune has just been Yeah. As

643
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:35,845
Speaker 4:  the catchall enemy for anyone who doesn't like music, which

644
00:39:35,845 --> 00:39:39,685
Speaker 4:  is slightly un naturalistic. I I just wanna say If, you

645
00:39:39,695 --> 00:39:43,365
Speaker 4:  don't like the sound of autotune. That's fine. Like,

646
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:47,045
Speaker 4:  I think it's totally fine to have your taste If, you prefer House Sinatra

647
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:50,725
Speaker 4:  sings. That's cool. Like If, you prefer how

648
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:54,805
Speaker 4:  punk rockers sing. That's also fine. There are different aesthetics

649
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:58,765
Speaker 4:  and auto Tune is just one of them. It is the one that's really popular at

650
00:39:58,785 --> 00:39:59,245
Speaker 4:  the moment.

651
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,685
Speaker 4:  If, you feel that? It's like, it sounds unnatural. I don't like unnatural.

652
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:07,325
Speaker 4:  That's fine. But it just, it's just is another way of, of singing.

653
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:11,365
Speaker 4:  And I think that this, this criticism is fair, is a bit

654
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:11,885
Speaker 4:  overblown.

655
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:16,325
Speaker 1:  Okay. I guess I agree to a large extent, but I do think there

656
00:40:16,425 --> 00:40:20,365
Speaker 1:  is something that I've, I just can't sort out inside of me

657
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:23,805
Speaker 1:  that there's something about autotune that feels like hiding that, that it's

658
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:27,645
Speaker 1:  like if you're, if you're if, because I actually, I buy

659
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:31,125
Speaker 1:  the thesis that there are things that sound like autotune, but I, I

660
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:35,365
Speaker 1:  do think, and and maybe I'm wrong about this, that there

661
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:39,285
Speaker 1:  is still a, a real use of autotune that is not designed to be seen.

662
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:42,925
Speaker 1:  Right? Yes. Like if, if, if you're right, that 90 plus percentage of

663
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:46,485
Speaker 1:  music is using autotune in some way, like,

664
00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:50,165
Speaker 1:  I don't know, Taylor Swift is, is not somebody people like, she sounds like

665
00:40:50,165 --> 00:40:53,645
Speaker 1:  autotune, but she's using it and there are people who get really pissed about

666
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:57,245
Speaker 1:  that and Yeah. And because they're like, oh, it's dishonest in some way,

667
00:40:57,245 --> 00:41:01,205
Speaker 1:  that this isn't actually what you sound like this is, this is you, this

668
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:05,045
Speaker 1:  is the equivalent of like putting a, a face filter on yourself before you

669
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,525
Speaker 1:  post a picture. Sure. Which is now another thing, people have sort of visceral

670
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:12,765
Speaker 1:  reactions to online Yeah. In this moment of like fake authenticity. And

671
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:16,725
Speaker 1:  I don't know, like do we need, is there like, is there like an Auto-Tune

672
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,885
Speaker 1:  watermark that should exist on every song that uses it? I don't know. Well,

673
00:41:19,885 --> 00:41:20,325
Speaker 1:  okay, so,

674
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,925
Speaker 4:  So you're, you're getting at this question of like, authenticity just with

675
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:27,725
Speaker 4:  the pop star. Like we want something about us wants our pop star to be

676
00:41:27,995 --> 00:41:31,405
Speaker 4:  sitting right next to us, our best friend telling their personal stories,

677
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:34,405
Speaker 4:  and yet we know that they're recording it in a professional studio working

678
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:38,205
Speaker 4:  with producers and songwriters to make this presentation, which is

679
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:42,245
Speaker 4:  exciting and, you know, enhances all of our emotions. So there's always this

680
00:41:42,525 --> 00:41:46,165
Speaker 4:  conflict about what is real and unreal in recorded music. And I think especially

681
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:49,605
Speaker 4:  in pop music than other forms, we don't expect our actors to be themselves

682
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:53,565
Speaker 4:  in a film, and yet pop stars are putting on a performance,

683
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:57,485
Speaker 4:  and yet we have this expectation of they are who they say they are. You brought

684
00:41:57,485 --> 00:42:01,365
Speaker 4:  up Taylor Swift, for example, and Taylor Swift uses all kinds of vocal processing

685
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,885
Speaker 4:  in her music on the song Delicate, she uses a vocoder

686
00:42:05,465 --> 00:42:09,445
Speaker 4:  on the song Midnight Reign. She uses a tool called Formin Shifting where

687
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:12,245
Speaker 4:  she sort of shifts the voice to sound more masculine.

688
00:42:13,605 --> 00:42:17,485
Speaker 4:  I don't like the moments in a Taylor Swift vocal where I can hear

689
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:21,885
Speaker 4:  Audible pitch correction done poorly. And I've heard it done

690
00:42:22,385 --> 00:42:25,525
Speaker 4:  one or two times. Sometimes when you're producing a song and you need to

691
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:29,325
Speaker 4:  get it out fast for whatever reason. Getting these pitch tuning

692
00:42:29,335 --> 00:42:33,205
Speaker 4:  tools to sound natural actually is, is a skill you can get paid

693
00:42:33,245 --> 00:42:37,125
Speaker 4:  a good amount of money just to do the really slow version of

694
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:41,205
Speaker 4:  hand drawn autotune. Thi this is a big part of the craft

695
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,605
Speaker 4:  and what you're trying to do is make something which was a beautiful

696
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:48,965
Speaker 4:  emotional performance, be a little bit more in Tune

697
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:52,605
Speaker 4:  and If. you do it wrong. You hear this

698
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:57,685
Speaker 4:  like this weird artifact that's unpleasant. I, I

699
00:42:57,685 --> 00:43:01,645
Speaker 4:  don't like when I hear that because it's the attempt of a naturalistic performance

700
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:05,685
Speaker 4:  clearly being manipulated. You have to hide the tools

701
00:43:05,805 --> 00:43:09,605
Speaker 4:  you're using to clean things up in order for it to sound good. In the same

702
00:43:09,605 --> 00:43:13,445
Speaker 4:  way that a photoshopped photo that is poorly done and you can see some kind

703
00:43:13,445 --> 00:43:17,325
Speaker 4:  of weird, like the anatomy of the person isn't right. We don't like

704
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:20,485
Speaker 4:  that. Even though we completely accept that every single magazine photo is

705
00:43:20,485 --> 00:43:20,965
Speaker 4:  photoshopped.

706
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,645
Speaker 1:  Interesting. So there's a, there's a real, as long as you don't make

707
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,725
Speaker 1:  me think about it, I can rock with it kind of thing. Yeah. But it's like,

708
00:43:28,865 --> 00:43:32,845
Speaker 1:  as soon as you put this, you know, cognitive dissonance in front of my face,

709
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:36,165
Speaker 1:  it's gonna feel bad. Yeah. But otherwise I can sort of internalize that it's

710
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:37,245
Speaker 1:  happening. I just won't have to think about

711
00:43:37,245 --> 00:43:40,725
Speaker 4:  It. It's the same thing with CGI, right? Yeah. So I just watched Alien Romulus

712
00:43:40,845 --> 00:43:44,765
Speaker 4:  recently. Nice. And this CGI of the, of the

713
00:43:44,765 --> 00:43:48,365
Speaker 4:  Android character is trying to recreate a deceased actor

714
00:43:49,065 --> 00:43:52,885
Speaker 4:  and it doesn't work. It's, it's so obviously inhuman

715
00:43:52,985 --> 00:43:55,525
Speaker 4:  and even though they're an Android, it's just like, it doesn't look right.

716
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:59,525
Speaker 4:  But the rest of Alien Romulus is like full of CGI and

717
00:43:59,945 --> 00:44:03,925
Speaker 4:  at no point am I like, not alien just doesn't like, feel alien enough

718
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:07,605
Speaker 4:  to me. So I. It's, it's all about the context in, in this

719
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:11,405
Speaker 4:  presentation, anything which is supposed to be completely authentic ent

720
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:15,645
Speaker 4:  entirely natural that is processed, we will perceive as that doesn't feel

721
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:19,485
Speaker 4:  right. Yeah. Things that are presented as I am a pop star on a

722
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:23,445
Speaker 4:  stage and everything about me is like perfectly composed. We accept that

723
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:27,325
Speaker 4:  there is go, we, we, we not only accept, we expect that things are

724
00:44:27,325 --> 00:44:31,045
Speaker 4:  going to have been enhanced. So I just wanna give everyone, everyone

725
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:34,925
Speaker 4:  permission to be mad at autotune at certain moments. But

726
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:38,165
Speaker 4:  when it's intentional, let go of it. Whatever. Like if someone's trying to

727
00:44:38,165 --> 00:44:40,845
Speaker 4:  do it, let them do it. If someone's doing it poorly, fine criticize them.

728
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:41,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

729
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,085
Speaker 1:  I like it. Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come

730
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:46,005
Speaker 1:  back and talk about where we go from here. We'll be right back.

731
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:38,285
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Hello Charlie. We've gone long enough without talking

732
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:41,405
Speaker 1:  about AI videos on YouTube or some of the AI videos on YouTube.

733
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:46,045
Speaker 1:  So, I wanna I actually wanna talk about basically two different pieces of

734
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:50,005
Speaker 1:  where I think things might be headed from here. One is

735
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:53,925
Speaker 1:  AI and one is back to the kind of authenticity thing.

736
00:45:54,775 --> 00:45:58,245
Speaker 1:  Let's talk about AI first. Yeah. And I, I bring this up because I think there

737
00:45:58,245 --> 00:46:01,965
Speaker 1:  is a, a possible future for AI that looks

738
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:05,725
Speaker 1:  a lot like the arc of autotune that you just

739
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:09,645
Speaker 1:  described, where tool becomes available. Some people

740
00:46:09,825 --> 00:46:13,765
Speaker 1:  use it like a tool and it's rendered mostly invisible. And it does, it

741
00:46:13,765 --> 00:46:17,285
Speaker 1:  helps in the process and it becomes a tool in the toolkit. Other people will

742
00:46:17,285 --> 00:46:21,245
Speaker 1:  use it incredibly aggressively and showy and it will allow new people

743
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,565
Speaker 1:  to do new kinds of things.

744
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:27,125
Speaker 1:  Ultimately, some people will be pissed off about it, but eventually it will

745
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:30,965
Speaker 1:  just be rolled into how the music industry works and may even

746
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:34,205
Speaker 1:  become like the dominant aesthetic in the way that autotune is.

747
00:46:35,015 --> 00:46:38,565
Speaker 1:  Could be totally wrong, but I i, there there's something about that rhymes

748
00:46:38,565 --> 00:46:42,245
Speaker 1:  to me with where AI might be headed. What do you make of that

749
00:46:42,245 --> 00:46:42,685
Speaker 1:  comparison?

750
00:46:43,115 --> 00:46:46,445
Speaker 4:  Well, we'd have to break AI down into all the various ways that it's being

751
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:49,405
Speaker 4:  used for music, because AI is just sort of like a process that can be used

752
00:46:49,405 --> 00:46:52,725
Speaker 4:  in lots of different ways from writing lyrics to separating

753
00:46:53,115 --> 00:46:56,285
Speaker 4:  stem recording. So you can separate the bass and drums and vocals and instruments

754
00:46:56,285 --> 00:47:00,245
Speaker 4:  from a recording to generating whole songs for you from a prompt.

755
00:47:00,315 --> 00:47:04,005
Speaker 4:  There's so many different ways that AI is being used, some of which are maybe

756
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:07,645
Speaker 4:  more invisible. For example, like If, you use chat GPT to help you find a

757
00:47:07,645 --> 00:47:11,285
Speaker 4:  rhyme. There's no way that I can identify that you did that. Sure. Except

758
00:47:11,285 --> 00:47:14,005
Speaker 4:  for this, sometimes chat GPT makes really bad rhymes. It's getting better

759
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:15,165
Speaker 4:  and better. It

760
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,285
Speaker 1:  Really likes to rhyme like do and two, and it's like, great job chat.

761
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:22,125
Speaker 4:  Thanks for that. Yeah. That's the thing. AI songs and poorly written songs

762
00:47:22,225 --> 00:47:26,205
Speaker 4:  use too many perfect rhymes. They're kinda just overly sweet, really bad

763
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:29,805
Speaker 4:  single syllable, perfect rhymes. That's, that's the tell.

764
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:33,725
Speaker 4:  But I, I don't think we've seen a tool yet that

765
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:38,285
Speaker 4:  is marketed as an AI tool that has become a

766
00:47:38,285 --> 00:47:42,085
Speaker 4:  predominant sound in, in popular music. There's all kinds of AI tools that

767
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:45,685
Speaker 4:  I use in my music production, but I don't think of them as ai. So like

768
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:49,845
Speaker 4:  I use a de verb plugin if there's too much reverberation in a recording and

769
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:52,765
Speaker 4:  like technically it's using a neural net, but it doesn't really have a sonic

770
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:56,565
Speaker 4:  fingerprint in the way that that autotune does. So I

771
00:47:56,565 --> 00:48:00,525
Speaker 4:  imagine there will be some kind of effect that will use some

772
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:04,525
Speaker 4:  kind of ai neural net in its thing that will become a

773
00:48:04,525 --> 00:48:08,205
Speaker 4:  sound. But the AI as a, as a

774
00:48:08,205 --> 00:48:11,605
Speaker 4:  methodology is, is sort of too broad to say that, well, we're gonna hear

775
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:14,045
Speaker 4:  AI in the future. Does that make sense?

776
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:17,085
Speaker 1:  It does. And I think, I hadn't really thought about it like that until you

777
00:48:17,085 --> 00:48:20,725
Speaker 1:  put it like that, but it is, it, maybe the strength and weakness of AI is

778
00:48:20,725 --> 00:48:24,685
Speaker 1:  that it doesn't have a mark in its way. Like you can make Yeah.

779
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:27,965
Speaker 1:  An AI song that sounds like anything,

780
00:48:29,025 --> 00:48:32,685
Speaker 1:  but it's never really gonna sound like itself in a, in a way that is,

781
00:48:33,605 --> 00:48:37,565
Speaker 1:  I think by design, right? Like the, all these tools are meant not to

782
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:40,245
Speaker 1:  sound like themselves. They're all trying to mimic something else and they're

783
00:48:40,245 --> 00:48:43,365
Speaker 1:  all generally doing a bad job of it. And that maybe it would be more interesting

784
00:48:43,705 --> 00:48:47,685
Speaker 1:  if they had like If, you went and made a song with Suno that it sounded

785
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:51,085
Speaker 1:  like something and, and that maybe, maybe there is something to that that

786
00:48:51,085 --> 00:48:52,645
Speaker 1:  is actually missing from these tools. So,

787
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:56,405
Speaker 4:  So you know how like If, you try to currently make an image

788
00:48:56,745 --> 00:49:00,685
Speaker 4:  of a person in Dolly three or Midjourney, like,

789
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:04,285
Speaker 4:  it kind of has, there's a style, there's a default style and obviously there's

790
00:49:04,285 --> 00:49:07,645
Speaker 4:  all kinds of way you can get around that style, but it's this weird

791
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:12,445
Speaker 4:  somewhat cartoony magazine. Glossy very thin.

792
00:49:12,675 --> 00:49:14,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like very white.

793
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:16,965
Speaker 1:  Well, and they're the things, right? Like you look at the fingers and you

794
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:20,365
Speaker 1:  look at the lapels and like they, they have their tells in that

795
00:49:20,755 --> 00:49:23,045
Speaker 4:  Kind of way. They have tells. Yeah, exactly. And so, so right now If you

796
00:49:23,065 --> 00:49:26,845
Speaker 4:  use tools like Suno or uio, they do have their tells and

797
00:49:26,845 --> 00:49:30,565
Speaker 4:  perhaps, you know, in 20 years in the future, people are like, I wanna use

798
00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:33,445
Speaker 4:  classic suno because I like the things that it does wrong. Wait,

799
00:49:33,445 --> 00:49:35,045
Speaker 1:  What are those tells? Like how would you describe those?

800
00:49:35,565 --> 00:49:38,565
Speaker 4:  Okay, so first of all, a lot of it's trained on actually really low

801
00:49:39,285 --> 00:49:43,125
Speaker 4:  sample rate and bit rate MP threes just to like reduce

802
00:49:43,145 --> 00:49:46,845
Speaker 4:  the size of the, of the data. And so there is this like

803
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:51,085
Speaker 4:  grainy hissy sound. Mm. Like it sounds, it sounds like a bad

804
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:54,525
Speaker 4:  MP three from 1997 being played in winamp. Awesome. Or

805
00:49:54,935 --> 00:49:58,125
Speaker 4:  maybe, maybe like more relatable for folks would be like, If, you turn on

806
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:01,445
Speaker 4:  AM radio, AM radio has a sound where it's just like not quite high fidelity.

807
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:03,605
Speaker 4:  There's a low fidelity sound.

808
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:08,925
Speaker 4:  The, the, the sounds of instruments are

809
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:13,405
Speaker 4:  strange. Like, okay, take for example a horn section If, you try to make

810
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:17,445
Speaker 4:  a like a, a funk song with horns. The great thing about a

811
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:21,205
Speaker 4:  horn section is nobody hits the note at exactly the same

812
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:24,925
Speaker 4:  time at exactly the right pitch. The excitement is the subtle

813
00:50:24,925 --> 00:50:28,765
Speaker 4:  differences of, you know, eight horns all trying to do

814
00:50:28,765 --> 00:50:31,965
Speaker 4:  their thing at almost the exact same time. And that actually cr that inhuman

815
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:35,925
Speaker 4:  imperfection is what makes it sound really good. AI oftentimes

816
00:50:35,955 --> 00:50:39,885
Speaker 4:  just like makes it all too perfect. Mm. Same with vocals. The vocals

817
00:50:39,885 --> 00:50:43,805
Speaker 4:  sound actually pret tuned. And so you can identify

818
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:47,565
Speaker 4:  these things and in addition to the vocals are the, the lyrics are have way

819
00:50:47,565 --> 00:50:51,365
Speaker 4:  too many perfect rhymes, et cetera, et cetera. I actually assigned my students

820
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:55,245
Speaker 4:  to NYU one of their assignments was go to suno,

821
00:50:55,245 --> 00:50:58,965
Speaker 4:  prompt it to write a song. Grade that song based off of everything that you've

822
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:02,285
Speaker 4:  learned in class now write your own song from the same prompt. And all of

823
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:06,125
Speaker 4:  my freshman students wrote significantly better songs than,

824
00:51:06,185 --> 00:51:08,805
Speaker 4:  oh, that's a great one than the UD and Suno song. And most of them threw

825
00:51:08,805 --> 00:51:11,405
Speaker 4:  them out entirely. I asked them to try to incorporate elements of them into

826
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:15,245
Speaker 4:  their track and they're like, it's too hard, it's too bad. So, but

827
00:51:15,245 --> 00:51:18,085
Speaker 4:  maybe this badness could be something that we, we like in the future.

828
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And that comes back to the other thing I wanna talk about with this

829
00:51:21,485 --> 00:51:25,245
Speaker 1:  authenticity thing. I think a, a theory that

830
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,565
Speaker 1:  I'm starting to hear more and more from people is that the next

831
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:33,325
Speaker 1:  phase of culture in so many ways is going to be a

832
00:51:33,395 --> 00:51:37,245
Speaker 1:  spin all the way back to, again, whatever you want to think of as like, quote

833
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:39,205
Speaker 1:  unquote authentic stuff.

834
00:51:39,715 --> 00:51:40,685
Speaker 4:  It's called punk rock.

835
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:44,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's right. Like it. And, and we're going to, people are going to

836
00:51:44,525 --> 00:51:48,125
Speaker 1:  deliberately start releasing vocals that sound

837
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:52,285
Speaker 1:  worse because they are more honest somehow. And yeah, we're gonna go back

838
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:56,205
Speaker 1:  to, you know, not using the internet in the ways that we've been using,

839
00:51:56,205 --> 00:52:00,165
Speaker 1:  like this idea of just sort of ask, skewing all of this stuff because it

840
00:52:00,165 --> 00:52:03,925
Speaker 1:  has made us not ourselves anymore. And going back to like,

841
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:07,005
Speaker 1:  I don't know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna just put a bunch of instruments in a room

842
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:10,805
Speaker 1:  and record like the Beatles 60 years ago. And that, that is the next

843
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:11,205
Speaker 1:  thing.

844
00:52:12,225 --> 00:52:16,045
Speaker 4:  Who famously used the music studio for all of its wild creative tools and

845
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:19,805
Speaker 4:  use all kinds of post-processing vocal tools like Vera Speed and

846
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:23,485
Speaker 4:  et cetera. So I'm just saying we've always been doing this, but yes, I hear

847
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:23,885
Speaker 4:  where you're going

848
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:26,845
Speaker 1:  Again. Yeah. Again, the question of like, how far back do you have to go

849
00:52:26,845 --> 00:52:29,085
Speaker 1:  to find something, quote unquote authentic is a good one.

850
00:52:29,255 --> 00:52:33,005
Speaker 4:  We're all gonna play the mandolin guitar and, and

851
00:52:33,365 --> 00:52:37,285
Speaker 4:  banjo and violin and, you know, sing in, in old timey bands, is what

852
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:37,565
Speaker 4:  you're saying.

853
00:52:37,675 --> 00:52:41,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And like if, if, if I sang flat on the take, it's gonna be flat

854
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:45,165
Speaker 1:  on the record. And I would say, historically speaking, there have been

855
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:48,325
Speaker 1:  a lot of people who want us to go that way. and we have never ever, ever

856
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:52,045
Speaker 1:  gone that way. But I do think there's a reasonable argument that

857
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:56,205
Speaker 1:  AI is like the end of a certain road of

858
00:52:56,345 --> 00:52:59,565
Speaker 1:  inauthenticity that maybe we are due for a pushback the other

859
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:03,445
Speaker 4:  Way. I think that that's a completely acceptable expectation. Like we've

860
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:07,365
Speaker 4:  seen that trend many times in the history of popular music, in the rise

861
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:11,125
Speaker 4:  of electronic recording and the, the electric guitar,

862
00:53:11,345 --> 00:53:14,725
Speaker 4:  louder sounds and rock and roll. You had the folk

863
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:18,885
Speaker 4:  resurgence after the super highly produced era of the

864
00:53:19,085 --> 00:53:22,525
Speaker 4:  1980s. You had grunge as a pushback to that

865
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:26,845
Speaker 4:  So I think it's completely likely that we're gonna see new sounds and styles

866
00:53:27,005 --> 00:53:30,925
Speaker 4:  emerging that do try to harken to our most human sound

867
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:35,165
Speaker 4:  as a pushback to anything that is, is ai. At the same

868
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:38,165
Speaker 4:  time, I wonder if we've already reached peak

869
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:42,205
Speaker 4:  authentic, because If, you go on TikTok today.

870
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:46,765
Speaker 4:  I feel like every other thing on TikTok is the TikTok shop

871
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:50,605
Speaker 4:  Yes. Is some sort of advertisement. And it's all filmed the exact same way.

872
00:53:50,605 --> 00:53:54,165
Speaker 4:  It doesn't matter if it's a creator with 10 likes or if it's progressive

873
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:57,885
Speaker 4:  insurance, it's all like, Hey, I'm holding my phone, I'm back lit.

874
00:53:58,145 --> 00:54:01,685
Speaker 4:  I'm just like talking naturally, just shooting the breeze, whatever. Oh,

875
00:54:01,685 --> 00:54:05,245
Speaker 4:  and by the way, this is progressive insurance. And so it's already been co

876
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:09,085
Speaker 4:  that like the authentic human thing in video has

877
00:54:09,085 --> 00:54:12,965
Speaker 4:  already been co-opted by advertisers. So where people go next, I

878
00:54:12,965 --> 00:54:16,725
Speaker 4:  think it might be weird, it might be something like autotune that

879
00:54:17,345 --> 00:54:21,125
Speaker 4:  is, is the effect of the, of, of the, of the next, you know, generation of

880
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:21,325
Speaker 4:  music.

881
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:25,805
Speaker 1:  Do you have any theory about what that might be in, in this world? Like

882
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:29,045
Speaker 1:  what are the, what are the teens doing that is gonna seem crazy to, to the

883
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:30,045
Speaker 1:  old folks in a couple of years?

884
00:54:30,075 --> 00:54:33,845
Speaker 4:  They're still using a lot of autotune there. It's not going anywhere

885
00:54:33,845 --> 00:54:37,645
Speaker 4:  right now. It seems like we have like a, i I

886
00:54:37,645 --> 00:54:40,725
Speaker 4:  joked about everybody playing the mandolin and there does seem to be like

887
00:54:40,765 --> 00:54:44,725
Speaker 4:  a lumineer style resurgence in the, the music of like, Noah Kahn

888
00:54:44,725 --> 00:54:45,365
Speaker 4:  is a great example.

889
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:49,205
Speaker 15:  Sticks and

890
00:54:51,065 --> 00:54:52,925
Speaker 15:  Mom, she forgot that I exist.

891
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:54,965
Speaker 1:  I was gonna say thank you. Stick season. Yeah,

892
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Ex exactly. So I. I don't, I don't think there is the

893
00:54:58,605 --> 00:55:02,445
Speaker 4:  emergent thing yet. People are still having a lot of fun making

894
00:55:02,445 --> 00:55:05,565
Speaker 4:  music on their computers because it's the easiest way to record

895
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:10,005
Speaker 4:  So I think we're seeing more a, like branching of many different kinds of

896
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:13,165
Speaker 4:  expression than a solidification around one sound. Mm.

897
00:55:13,785 --> 00:55:16,245
Speaker 1:  Can I tell you my theory and I'm, I'm very curious. I wanna hear it If you

898
00:55:16,245 --> 00:55:20,125
Speaker 1:  think of this, my theory is that the like voice

899
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:23,965
Speaker 1:  memo demo is going to become an actual

900
00:55:23,965 --> 00:55:25,765
Speaker 1:  honest to god like genre of music.

901
00:55:26,145 --> 00:55:27,405
Speaker 4:  Oh, interesting. Yeah. I think

902
00:55:27,405 --> 00:55:30,405
Speaker 1:  That you see this all the time, right? Where like the, a song will come out

903
00:55:30,405 --> 00:55:33,645
Speaker 1:  and then, like Charlie Po does this all the time. Yeah. Where he'll, he'll

904
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:37,525
Speaker 1:  go on TikTok or or whatever at some late night show and

905
00:55:37,525 --> 00:55:41,365
Speaker 1:  play his demo of the song where he's just like

906
00:55:41,365 --> 00:55:43,965
Speaker 1:  sort of inventing the melody in his head and trying to get it down into his

907
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:47,645
Speaker 1:  phone. Yeah. And that part of me is starting to wonder like, maybe we're

908
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:51,605
Speaker 1:  gonna get to the point where the, the polished thing in the unpolished thing

909
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:55,205
Speaker 1:  actually get to live next to each other. If, if instead of there just being

910
00:55:55,235 --> 00:55:58,765
Speaker 1:  sort of one canonical finished version of the thing,

911
00:55:59,435 --> 00:56:03,285
Speaker 1:  what we actually want is lots of different experiences of this same kind

912
00:56:03,285 --> 00:56:07,245
Speaker 1:  of thing. Yeah. All the way down to just like the artist riffing

913
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:10,725
Speaker 1:  into their phone for a minute. And that that, like, we want to experience

914
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,045
Speaker 1:  all of that as fans.

915
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:15,965
Speaker 4:  The new Halsey record has multiple tracks that are exactly that Oh shit.

916
00:56:15,965 --> 00:56:19,765
Speaker 4:  That are basically like voice memos and demos and things that are interspersed

917
00:56:19,765 --> 00:56:22,725
Speaker 4:  and you know, that, that has a long history of like interlude tracks on hip

918
00:56:22,725 --> 00:56:25,685
Speaker 4:  hop tracks that are kind of like, oh, this is a phone call. But

919
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:29,725
Speaker 4:  IIII like that. I mean, I wanna just point out one other trend that has popped

920
00:56:29,725 --> 00:56:33,445
Speaker 4:  up as well as like the return to 1920s,

921
00:56:33,885 --> 00:56:37,845
Speaker 4:  thirties jazz. Yeah. Or, or like what you might call classical pop

922
00:56:38,115 --> 00:56:42,005
Speaker 4:  with the artists like ve who are making things that are things

923
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:45,765
Speaker 4:  a false nostalgia for music, which is a hundred years old and that young

924
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:49,165
Speaker 4:  people are into, so yeah, there's all kinds of routes.

925
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:52,925
Speaker 4:  I don't know if I really wanna hear a lot of people's voice memos though,

926
00:56:53,165 --> 00:56:53,285
Speaker 1:  But

927
00:56:54,985 --> 00:56:57,885
Speaker 1:  as we look at, you know, we're, we're 27 years into autotune,

928
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:03,125
Speaker 1:  which is a long time in Yeah. Music genre and in

929
00:57:03,145 --> 00:57:06,925
Speaker 1:  pop music. Do you think If, you fast forward a while,

930
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:11,005
Speaker 1:  we will look back at this as kind of an autotune

931
00:57:11,425 --> 00:57:15,405
Speaker 1:  era in the way that we've had sort of distinct eras in music and it'll,

932
00:57:15,405 --> 00:57:19,005
Speaker 1:  it'll linger, but like the idea of autotune being kind of the dominant sound

933
00:57:19,005 --> 00:57:22,445
Speaker 1:  of music will go away ly and we will be replaced by something else and this

934
00:57:22,445 --> 00:57:26,285
Speaker 1:  will be the autotune moment. Or is this just gonna

935
00:57:26,285 --> 00:57:27,365
Speaker 1:  be how music is forever?

936
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:31,445
Speaker 4:  What's amazing about all listeners, whether they're a trained musician or

937
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:34,245
Speaker 4:  not, is they can turn on a recording and often tell you, oh, that's like

938
00:57:34,245 --> 00:57:36,525
Speaker 4:  an eighties thing and I don't like the eighties. Mm. And the reason why they

939
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:40,485
Speaker 4:  can do that is because snare drums were produced in a very specific way from

940
00:57:40,485 --> 00:57:43,245
Speaker 4:  the 1980s. There's lots of other production techniques that sound 1980s.

941
00:57:43,985 --> 00:57:47,725
Speaker 4:  And every era has these, these sonic artifacts of,

942
00:57:47,785 --> 00:57:51,205
Speaker 4:  of their moment. And you can, and they place them in time in the same way

943
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:54,805
Speaker 4:  that a, you know, point and shoot Kodak photograph from the early two thousands

944
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:58,285
Speaker 4:  screams early two thousands. Yeah. You can even have AI generate things that

945
00:57:58,285 --> 00:58:01,565
Speaker 4:  look like 0.0 shoot Kodak photographs, which are actually having a comeback.

946
00:58:01,715 --> 00:58:04,085
Speaker 4:  I've been at birthday parties recently where people are handing these things

947
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:06,005
Speaker 4:  around to get that aesthetic. Yeah.

948
00:58:06,005 --> 00:58:09,725
Speaker 1:  People are out here buying like cool pics. Cameras from 2003 again. Yep.

949
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:10,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah, exactly.

950
00:58:10,305 --> 00:58:13,885
Speaker 4:  And So I think that, you know, 20 years in the future, it may

951
00:58:14,185 --> 00:58:17,765
Speaker 4:  be that autotune is no longer the predominant sound. I think that's probably

952
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:21,685
Speaker 4:  likely. But when someone's like, but I wanna sound like, you know, 2008,

953
00:58:21,955 --> 00:58:25,845
Speaker 4:  they're gonna use that again as a, you know, and as an act of sort of creative

954
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:29,485
Speaker 4:  nostalgia, So I think that we have been in the autotune decades,

955
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,685
Speaker 4:  we'll probably move beyond it, but in the same way that like the

956
00:58:33,925 --> 00:58:36,445
Speaker 4:  electric guitar is not the most popular instrument today, but it's still

957
00:58:36,445 --> 00:58:40,285
Speaker 4:  ubiquitous in recording. Right. I think that autotune will be around in

958
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:42,845
Speaker 4:  some kind of form and it might just sort of fade into the background and

959
00:58:42,845 --> 00:58:44,325
Speaker 4:  pop forward later on. Who knows?

960
00:58:44,715 --> 00:58:47,245
Speaker 1:  Okay. But right now we're still very much in the autotune era.

961
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:51,725
Speaker 4:  I mean, I think the coolest record of the year was Brat by Charlie

962
00:58:51,885 --> 00:58:55,725
Speaker 4:  XCX and she admits that she has no

963
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:59,685
Speaker 4:  longer has the ability to sing without autotune because it's just

964
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:02,205
Speaker 4:  so part of her sound. She's like, I don't sound good to autotune anymore.

965
00:59:02,345 --> 00:59:04,325
Speaker 4:  And that record is, is amazing. Yeah.

966
00:59:04,635 --> 00:59:07,605
Speaker 1:  Yeah. If, if, if Autotune is what it took for us to get brat, I'll take it.

967
00:59:07,775 --> 00:59:08,685
Speaker 1:  We'll, we'll be all right.

968
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:09,485
Speaker 4:  Amen.

969
00:59:11,105 --> 00:59:13,405
Speaker 1:  All right, Charlie, thank you so much as always. This was really fun.

970
00:59:13,705 --> 00:59:14,125
Speaker 4:  Thanks.

971
00:59:15,105 --> 00:59:18,005
Speaker 1:  All right, that's it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to Charlie again

972

Speaker 1:  for being here. And thank you as always for listening. There's more on everything

973
00:59:21,765 --> 00:59:25,285
Speaker 1:  we talked about in the show notes. I highly recommend the

974
00:59:25,285 --> 00:59:28,845
Speaker 1:  Pitchfork story on the history of autotune. There's a ton of good stuff in

975
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:32,765
Speaker 1:  there. I'll also link to Switched on Pop, so many great episodes of that

976
00:59:32,765 --> 00:59:35,565
Speaker 1:  show that you should listen to. Truly cannot recommend it highly enough.

987
01:00:19,905 --> 01:00:23,565
Speaker 1:  Off the top of your head. Yes. Give me a a, a intro to

988
01:00:23,725 --> 01:00:27,525
Speaker 1:  autotune playlist. What are like for, for somebody who is like, I want to

989
01:00:27,525 --> 01:00:31,085
Speaker 1:  experience autotune, what are some songs you would just recommend off the

990
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:31,445
Speaker 1:  top of your head?

991
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:35,365
Speaker 4:  Okay, well, I would first go to other vocal processing

992
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:39,165
Speaker 4:  techniques and you'd have to listen to like Kraft Fors, trans Europe

993
01:00:39,165 --> 01:00:42,205
Speaker 4:  Express, using the Vocoder, you have to put harder, better, faster, stronger

994
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:45,685
Speaker 4:  from DAF Punk, not autotune technically you have to listen to some talk box,

995
01:00:45,715 --> 01:00:49,685
Speaker 4:  like show me the Way by Peter Frampton Living on a Prayer by

996
01:00:49,705 --> 01:00:53,565
Speaker 4:  Bon Jovi, California. Love by Tupac and Dre. And then,

997
01:00:54,105 --> 01:00:57,605
Speaker 4:  you know, obviously you need to have Lollipop on there because

998
01:00:58,205 --> 01:01:00,965
Speaker 4:  I mean, what, what, what is auto do without Lollipop?

999
01:01:02,585 --> 01:01:06,365
Speaker 4:  You need what else has to go on there? Certainly

1000
01:01:06,645 --> 01:01:10,565
Speaker 4:  Travis Scott HIAs in the room, the entire album of Brat. But if

1001
01:01:10,665 --> 01:01:14,525
Speaker 4:  any one song, I'm more of a 3 6 5 than a 360.

1002
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:18,165
Speaker 4:  So I'm gonna say 3, 6, 5. Okay. Drake's in my feelings

1003
01:01:19,825 --> 01:01:23,645
Speaker 4:  shares believe TPAs, I'm sprung and I'm not

1004
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:25,525
Speaker 4:  gonna recommend Maroon five's. She'll be left.
