2
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:32,015
Speaker 4:  Hello and Welcome. To Vergecast. The flagship podcast of Samsung Decks, powered

3
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:35,375
Speaker 4:  by Knox, supported by Android. It's real.

4
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:40,375
Speaker 4:  When you turn on a Samsung phone, the the logos are outta

5
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,535
Speaker 4:  control. Powered by

6
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,655
Speaker 5:  NOx. I mean it has always been thus powered by Android. Nobody is better

7
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:45,495
Speaker 5:  at logos than Samsung.

8
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:46,855
Speaker 4:  It's very good. Is

9
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:47,495
Speaker 6:  Some touch whizz in

10
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:49,655
Speaker 4:  There? Hi, I'm my friend Eli David. Pierce is here. Hi.

11
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:51,655
Speaker 5:  We're in the studio together. Yeah, this is very exciting.

12
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:54,135
Speaker 4:  You can just reach over and smack Alex. He wants.

13
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,815
Speaker 5:  Thank God. Honestly, Alex

14
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:56,415
Speaker 4:  Franz is here.

15
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:59,375
Speaker 6:  I'm just really excited to hear Neli talk about Dex.

16
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:01,335
Speaker 4:  It's a full hour of talking about Dex. That's

17
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:02,095
Speaker 6:  All we're doing today.

18
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:06,135
Speaker 4:  There's quite a lot. Apple has a surprise event in Prime time up

19
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:08,055
Speaker 4:  against Monday night football. That's

20
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:08,775
Speaker 6:  Choice. That's,

21
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:12,495
Speaker 4:  That's a real thing that's happening. There's some AirPod leaks,

22
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:16,695
Speaker 4:  price hikes on services. A real theme of our show lately. David wants

23
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:20,335
Speaker 4:  to talk about one year of X and I, I believe we're gonna put social

24
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:23,135
Speaker 4:  networks on the go. 90 scale. We are. In fact it's just gonna be incredible.

25
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:26,135
Speaker 4:  Yes. And then we got a lightning round including I would say the funniest

26
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:29,535
Speaker 4:  recurring lightning round element of all time, which is Microsoft

27
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:33,295
Speaker 4:  executives either bemoaning or being proud of the fact that they killed Windows

28
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:37,215
Speaker 4:  Strong and the me the needle just swings back and forth between

29
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,655
Speaker 4:  those two things. Right? The same people every couple years.

30
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:44,295
Speaker 4:  It's coming up on The Vergecast. But first let's talk Dex.

31
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:47,855
Speaker 5:  Can I just read everyone two messages from Slack? Yeah. That Neli send

32
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:52,935
Speaker 5:  at 11:28 AM on Tuesday, October 24th. Neli sends, we

33
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:56,615
Speaker 5:  have a Verge cast room for all of us to make the show. Neli just says

34
00:02:57,045 --> 00:03:01,005
Speaker 5:  also hello from Dex. And then a a moment later I have paired it to

35
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:04,325
Speaker 5:  a mechanical keyboard. So that's the worst for everyone in this office. And

36
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:08,165
Speaker 5:  there are two typos of that message. So this, this is

37
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:11,645
Speaker 5:  now, this is now an important part of my life is tracking your decks

38
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:15,845
Speaker 5:  situation and in general your ninja train situation. Yeah. Okay. So how are

39
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:16,045
Speaker 5:  we doing?

40
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:19,965
Speaker 4:  Here's this here. The basic updates. I have AZ fold

41
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:23,285
Speaker 4:  five. A really cool Z fold five. It has our D brandand skin on it.

42
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:25,165
Speaker 4:  So that's cool. It

43
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:25,565
Speaker 5:  Does look good.

44
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:26,685
Speaker 4:  It looks really good. Putting

45
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:29,805
Speaker 5:  Those skins on is not a small amount of work is a thing I discovered. But

46
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:30,445
Speaker 5:  they do look very cool.

47
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:32,765
Speaker 4:  It looks very cool. Boy do I dislike this phone?

48
00:03:34,545 --> 00:03:38,005
Speaker 4:  Boy do I just not like it and it's not Android. I like a number of Android

49
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:41,765
Speaker 4:  phones. Android's great. Specifically trying to use a

50
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:45,525
Speaker 4:  folding phone for what I'm trying to do is not

51
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:45,805
Speaker 4:  good.

52
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:48,605
Speaker 5:  Are you one of those people who's like really mad about the crease in the

53
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:48,765
Speaker 5:  middle?

54
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:52,365
Speaker 4:  No, So. I don't mind the crease. Okay. The Z fold five. So the Pixel fold

55
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,205
Speaker 4:  and Z fold five are kind of the same folding display, but they fold in in

56
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:59,845
Speaker 4:  different directions. Yeah. So and Samsung went with tall, skinny and

57
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,405
Speaker 4:  Google went with short and wide the correct way. Yeah. So

58
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:06,045
Speaker 4:  using this phone when it's closed is ridiculous.

59
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,125
Speaker 5:  It's a TV remote. Yeah, it's, it just really is and

60
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,245
Speaker 4:  It nothing quite works. Right. And then when you open it you have to use

61
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:14,605
Speaker 4:  two hands. Yeah, always. Which is fine. So I'm on the train, I got my tablet

62
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:18,925
Speaker 4:  and it Jelly Scrolls. So the display controller I think

63
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:22,965
Speaker 4:  is on the left and So, I scroll off my finger on the right. So the left side

64
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:26,725
Speaker 4:  of the screen moves up faster than the right side of the screen. Oh it's

65
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,285
Speaker 4:  super gross. And so the text, I can just see it go whoop. Yeah. And I can

66
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:33,525
Speaker 4:  see Dan can't see it. We just argue. We just argued about this in the office.

67
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:36,125
Speaker 4:  He's like, I dunno what you're talking about. And I was like, I'm on a rollercoaster.

68
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:37,685
Speaker 4:  I don't, I don't like this.

69
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:40,725
Speaker 5:  It's such a funny thing. 'cause this is one of those things with phones that

70
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:44,685
Speaker 5:  we largely solved like back 10 years ago on this show.

71
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,365
Speaker 5:  Like I bet if you go back to Verge casts from like 2013 and 2012,

72
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,525
Speaker 5:  there were a lot of people mad about wonky scrolling stuff on

73
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,405
Speaker 5:  Android phones. And the thing where like you can't scroll and read the text

74
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:58,165
Speaker 5:  at the same time, which is kind of how I always describe it to people. And

75
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:02,085
Speaker 5:  we're back at this somehow we're back at, although I will say Nila just

76
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:05,965
Speaker 5:  opened his phone and got immensely distracted. The scrolling. The scrolling.

77
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:07,725
Speaker 5:  So Samsung, she doing something right here.

78
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:11,565
Speaker 4:  It doesn't have a, doesn't have a ringer switch. I had an open it and like

79
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:15,365
Speaker 4:  monkey with one UI to turn off the ringer. So that's the phone. Yeah. So

80
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:18,405
Speaker 4:  the first part of this where I just roll up on the train, I've got one device.

81
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,965
Speaker 4:  I don't like using this phone. I understand why it's sick as hell.

82
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:26,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. And in that blissful moment when I've got it open

83
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:30,885
Speaker 4:  and I'm reading the Google doc and someone's like, what is that? That's that

84
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:31,485
Speaker 4:  rules. Yeah.

85
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:34,405
Speaker 5:  But then I Do you get that? Do you get a lot of like people looking at your

86
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:36,405
Speaker 5:  rear shoulder being like, well foldable phone on the

87
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:39,925
Speaker 4:  Train. It's a flashy thing to do to unfold a phone for even in

88
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:43,445
Speaker 4:  2023 people have seen them but you're still just like, ha whoop.

89
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:48,005
Speaker 5:  Oh don't mind see this larger. No problem. Just make eye contact

90
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:49,845
Speaker 4:  As you do that. So that part's cool. Ask

91
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:52,445
Speaker 5:  For your train ticket. You're just like, one second, let me open up my phone.

92
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And you're always just kind of like in a fight, whatever. But that

93
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:59,405
Speaker 4:  part is fine. Like it's a phone. It works. It's a good fast Android

94
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:03,085
Speaker 4:  Samsung phone except I find the display scrolling

95
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:07,205
Speaker 4:  to be extremely distracting. That might just be me, a noted Pixel density

96
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:11,605
Speaker 4:  enthusiast might just be me. Some people can't see it. Okay, fine. Then you

97
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:15,125
Speaker 4:  get to decks. So you roll in the office, you

98
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:19,565
Speaker 4:  have A-U-S-B-C doc and a Bluetooth mechanical keyboard. And

99
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,805
Speaker 4:  I'm just pulling stuff out of our reviews closet.

100
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:25,245
Speaker 6:  I like how many keyboards did you go through? Because I kept going in and

101
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:25,805
Speaker 6:  out of meetings.

102
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:29,325
Speaker 4:  I'm at, I'm at the third now I'm at a log MX mini or whatever it's called.

103
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:29,885
Speaker 4:  They

104
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:31,205
Speaker 6:  Were just stacking up on your desk

105
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:34,925
Speaker 4:  On it was not great. And I've got a, a razor gaming mouse,

106
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:39,245
Speaker 4:  like a wired ultra high DPI gaming mouse. Like

107
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,485
Speaker 6:  20 buttons on it. Yeah.

108
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,725
Speaker 4:  There's a lot of buttons on the side. All of which appear to be mapped to

109
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:46,885
Speaker 4:  something in Android for some reason, which is not great 'cause I'm whatever.

110
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:50,805
Speaker 4:  So you plug in the US PC doc hdm I display, then

111
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:55,565
Speaker 4:  you get to Dex and then Dan Ds expert,

112
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:56,645
Speaker 4:  Dan ert

113
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:57,085
Speaker 5:  The

114
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:58,565
Speaker 4:  Dexperts

115
00:06:58,565 --> 00:06:59,045
Speaker 6:  The masthead.

116
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:03,125
Speaker 4:  He told me that you have to install an app called Good Luck.

117
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:07,005
Speaker 4:  Okay. Which is made by Samsung to ultra

118
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:10,965
Speaker 4:  customized Samsung one ui. And his characterization of

119
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:14,005
Speaker 4:  this app is they made this app to get around Google's restrictions.

120
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:15,085
Speaker 5:  Oh.

121
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:19,685
Speaker 4:  'cause they have to ship one UI not too far away from

122
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:21,125
Speaker 4:  Android. Right.

123
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,005
Speaker 5:  Because Google doesn't, because Samsung for a decade completely lost its

124
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:27,085
Speaker 5:  mind with software design. Right. And tried to shove apps called Milk music

125
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,325
Speaker 5:  at you. Yes. Google was like, stop doing

126
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:33,245
Speaker 4:  That. So now all that stuff is in good luck. It's called Good

127
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:33,485
Speaker 4:  Luck.

128
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,205
Speaker 6:  Is milk music in there?

129
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,285
Speaker 4:  Good luck has two tabs at the bottom. Do

130
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:39,685
Speaker 5:  You think, it sounds like good luck on purpose where they're just like, here's

131
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:40,445
Speaker 5:  some stuff, good

132
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:44,205
Speaker 4:  Luck. It's what it feels like. Look, I know there are extremely hardcore

133
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,885
Speaker 4:  Galaxy fans out there who think I'm crazy for only now discovering. Good,

134
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:52,805
Speaker 4:  good luck. And I apologize, I'm just saying this is an app where

135
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,445
Speaker 4:  at the bottom of the screen, the two tabs are Makeup and Life Up. Yeah.

136
00:07:57,065 --> 00:08:00,285
Speaker 4:  And then you can install various plugins. Sick to one ui.

137
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:01,405
Speaker 6:  Did you life Up?

138
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:05,125
Speaker 4:  I lifed up a little bit and I installed the plugin that let's decks run

139
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,845
Speaker 4:  at 1440 P. So now I'm running Dex. Yeah. Looking

140
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:13,565
Speaker 4:  good. Dex runs Android apps. It turns out. So

141
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:17,325
Speaker 4:  Slack doesn't have a sidebar. So gross. Just like you're just using the

142
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:20,205
Speaker 4:  Android app wider right. On your desktop. It

143
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:23,445
Speaker 5:  Desktop computer doesn't like tablet apps. It it just makes of them as many,

144
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:24,245
Speaker 5:  many, many phone apps.

145
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:28,245
Speaker 4:  No. So then I, I solve this problem by running Slack as a web app in

146
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:32,125
Speaker 4:  Chrome in which it is very broken because it's running an Android Chrome

147
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:33,085
Speaker 4:  and desktop mode.

148
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:33,965
Speaker 5:  This is the thing

149
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,685
Speaker 4:  About, I was so close to this working. This

150
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:36,245
Speaker 6:  Is okay. It is the thing

151
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:40,125
Speaker 5:  About the whole Android and Google universe is it's

152
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,845
Speaker 5:  all there. They've made all the things. Yeah. It's just like they're, they

153
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,445
Speaker 5:  refuse to have the meeting where they're like, what if your thing and your

154
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:50,805
Speaker 5:  thing both existed in the same place? Yeah. And they're like,

155
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:52,085
Speaker 5:  we would never do that.

156
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:56,005
Speaker 4:  So again, Dan's advice to me was treat this like a Chromebook and

157
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:59,765
Speaker 4:  use Samsung's internet browser because it's better on this than

158
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:03,085
Speaker 4:  Chrome So I switched to Samsung's browser moderately better.

159
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:03,765
Speaker 5:  Okay.

160
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:08,045
Speaker 4:  It's just not quite there is what I would say. You can see how it

161
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:08,525
Speaker 4:  would rule

162
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:13,205
Speaker 6:  Like your, your desktop looked like a very functional

163
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:17,205
Speaker 6:  desktop from afar. Yeah. When I, when I last saw it, I didn't see

164
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:20,925
Speaker 6:  a keyboard attached. I just saw you were using the, the phone as a touch

165
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:21,205
Speaker 6:  pad.

166
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:24,725
Speaker 4:  Yes, that's true. Before I had a mouse you can just use the, the fold as

167
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:28,405
Speaker 4:  a touchpad. So that was, that was my touch pad with like my little mechanical

168
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:30,085
Speaker 4:  keyboard next to it. Green looked,

169
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:34,325
Speaker 6:  The monitor looked. I was like, oh that looks like a computer monitor with

170
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,405
Speaker 6:  like computer stuff happening. Yeah. That what's normal.

171
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:39,085
Speaker 5:  Okay. Wait, can we, can we get to the thing you were gonna do in the lightning

172
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:41,245
Speaker 5:  round, but we should just talk about right now, which

173
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,205
Speaker 4:  Is talk about Metal Gear, Solid You know

174
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:46,805
Speaker 5:  Delta You know. Yeah you can talk about that in the lightning round. But

175
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:50,445
Speaker 5:  no, Satya Nadella gave an interview this week to Business

176
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:54,445
Speaker 5:  Insider in which he, like every other Microsoft executive in history said,

177
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:58,525
Speaker 5:  giving up on mobile and Windows phone was a mistake. And like You know

178
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:01,885
Speaker 5:  who could have done a good job at The thing you are describing is

179
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:02,525
Speaker 5:  Microsoft.

180
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:04,605
Speaker 4:  They sort of tried, they have tried with

181
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,445
Speaker 5:  The, they're trying now. They stopped trying for a long time. They're like

182
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,645
Speaker 5:  sort of pushing in back in that direction. But like all the stuff you're

183
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:14,565
Speaker 5:  describing where it's like oh I want a thing that like runs Android apps

184
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:17,805
Speaker 5:  when it's my phone, but then I sit down and I have something that is much

185
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,925
Speaker 5:  closer to a full desktop operating system. It's like You know who could have

186
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:24,245
Speaker 5:  built that starting 12 years ago but instead did a bunch of weird shit and

187
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:27,925
Speaker 5:  then shut all their platforms down and fired their CEO. It's Microsoft All.

188
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:30,325
Speaker 4:  Right. Let me just read, I'll read you the quote. Here's N Nadella quote.

189
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:34,085
Speaker 4:  'cause Boyd, does he agree with you? He was asked

190
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:38,565
Speaker 4:  what about a mistake or a wrong decision that you might regret? Nadella says

191
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,365
Speaker 4:  the decision I think a lot of people talk about and one of the most difficult

192
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:45,325
Speaker 4:  decisions I made when I became CEO was our exit of what I'll call the

193
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:49,205
Speaker 4:  mobile phone as defined. Then in

194
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:53,045
Speaker 4:  retrospect, I think there could have been ways that we made it work by perhaps

195
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:57,325
Speaker 4:  reinventing the category of computing between PCs, tablets and

196
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:57,565
Speaker 4:  phones.

197
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:01,645
Speaker 5:  You're totally right. I read that as him saying there's another category

198
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:05,445
Speaker 5:  of devices that we didn't do, didn't think about. But

199
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:09,445
Speaker 5:  he's definitely saying there is a version of a phone that

200
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:12,405
Speaker 5:  is kind of all of those things and we should have built it. Yeah.

201
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:15,885
Speaker 4:  Or we or he is hinting that they're gonna try yet again. Sure.

202
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:16,965
Speaker 6:  But they aren't

203
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,925
Speaker 5:  PAOs Panay. He tried so hard.

204
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:23,325
Speaker 6:  Well that's not gonna happen. They just get, because they

205
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:26,205
Speaker 6:  either have to do Android or they have to do the thing everybody else has

206
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:28,685
Speaker 6:  to do, which is build an entire OSS from scratch.

207
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:32,565
Speaker 4:  Look, I'm just gonna say this directly to, to our friend Satya Nadella. If

208
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:36,245
Speaker 4:  you're listening Satya, you made the right decision. It was

209
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:40,685
Speaker 4:  strategic catastrophe to buy Nokia. Yeah. And then to do Windows

210
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:43,005
Speaker 4:  phone instead of, it looked

211
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:43,965
Speaker 6:  Cool though. It

212
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:44,765
Speaker 4:  Was all stupid.

213
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,405
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. The bad calls were made before him.

214
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:50,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. He was just like, You know what the platform is on fire into the ocean

215
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:54,685
Speaker 4:  with you. Yeah. That is a very deep cut. I'm not gonna explain it, but for

216
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:58,285
Speaker 4:  the people who Gannett into the freezing Finish Ocean with you

217
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:02,005
Speaker 4:  is basically what Sachin Nadella said much to these people. Pretty much.

218
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And that's, I think that was fine. I think the company's doing much

219
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,685
Speaker 4:  better. What I think he's hinting at here is, and we're gonna talk about

220
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:12,365
Speaker 4:  Humane later too. Yeah. There's like suddenly a bunch of people are like,

221
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,005
Speaker 4:  what comes after the phone? And there's a lot of action around what comes

222
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:17,845
Speaker 4:  after the phone. Mostly because none of these people have businesses I was

223
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:17,965
Speaker 4:  say,

224
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:18,245
Speaker 5:  Takes

225
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,165
Speaker 4:  30% away from them

226
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:22,925
Speaker 5:  Who say all of that are not Apple and not Google really like phones.

227
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's just, there's just a lot of heat around what comes after the phone

228
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,205
Speaker 4:  again comes up every so often and this is when the pendulum swings

229
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:34,285
Speaker 4:  for Microsoft executives to, oh should we have quit on the phone?

230
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:38,525
Speaker 4:  And like a year ago you asked Della this question and he was like, that was

231
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,605
Speaker 4:  the best decision I've ever made is getting away from this dinosaur and saying

232
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:43,685
Speaker 4:  we sell services across everyone's platforms.

233
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:48,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean I think in general Alex, I think you're right that this

234
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,965
Speaker 5:  is never gonna work and Microsoft to be foolish to try now. Yes. And I think

235
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,445
Speaker 5:  has been foolish to try really for the last five years to start building

236
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:56,925
Speaker 5:  towards that again. But I do think there's a really interesting tech

237
00:12:56,955 --> 00:13:00,925
Speaker 5:  history alternate universe. Yeah. In which we tried to do this. Right.

238
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:02,285
Speaker 5:  Because I think even if

239
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:04,805
Speaker 4:  I'm holding people trying to do it, even if DS

240
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:04,885
Speaker 5:  Were

241
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,925
Speaker 4:  Amazing, I unfolds into a bigger screen. Have you seen it? It's amazing.

242
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:12,245
Speaker 5:  Even if Dex were amazing, I don't think there's ever gonna be a mainstream

243
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:15,845
Speaker 5:  use for it because it's just not how we've like learned to use technology.

244
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:16,885
Speaker 5:  It's just not how It works.

245
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:20,645
Speaker 4:  Well. So here's the actually be, besides all the little problems in the

246
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:24,685
Speaker 4:  software, there's one deeply hilarious problem with this entire

247
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:28,725
Speaker 4:  approach to having just one thing. I come to the office,

248
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:31,045
Speaker 4:  the whole point of this is I don't have a desk anymore. If I had a desk,

249
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:34,605
Speaker 4:  I just put a laptop on the desk and I would leave, which is what I did for

250
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,285
Speaker 4:  years. But now, because we're like roaming desks, hybrid work, da da da So,

251
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,165
Speaker 4:  I don't have a desk. So I'm like, I, I can't just leave my laptop on this

252
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:44,565
Speaker 4:  like hotel desk would steal then I have to get up.

253
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:45,485
Speaker 4:  I know

254
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:46,965
Speaker 5:  I would,

255
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:51,125
Speaker 4:  I have to get up and go to meetings all the time where having my computer

256
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:55,245
Speaker 4:  is often useful and instead of this little guy, I'm just

257
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:58,125
Speaker 4:  like, me, me, me, me. What am I doing? Nothing

258
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,845
Speaker 5:  Cooler than sitting on your phone in a meeting being like, no, I'm taking

259
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:02,805
Speaker 5:  notes on the meeting. Don't worry. Everybody's like,

260
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:06,685
Speaker 4:  Open the spreadsheet with my little folding phone and laptop mode. Like this

261
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:10,205
Speaker 4:  is the worst. Yeah. So anyway, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try this for another

262
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:13,965
Speaker 4:  week just for the comedy of it all. And because I, I feel like I should write

263
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:17,925
Speaker 4:  down some of these experiences Agreed about the future of computing and

264
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:21,365
Speaker 4:  jolly scrolling to be quite honest. And then I think my, my

265
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,965
Speaker 4:  solution is gonna be, I'm just gonna leave my laptop in the reviews closet

266
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:25,405
Speaker 4:  where I found this one. That

267
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:26,085
Speaker 5:  Feels right. Yeah.

268
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:29,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then we'll I'll just buy another computer for home. Okay. And

269
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:31,325
Speaker 4:  that's the real solution to this phone. Your

270
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,485
Speaker 5:  Homework for next week though is you're not allowed to bring your laptop

271
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:37,445
Speaker 5:  to The Vergecast. You have to do The Vergecast. Ooh. From with only

272
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:40,485
Speaker 5:  your, you can bring your whole damn deck setup. If you want to

273
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:42,805
Speaker 4:  Bring, bring the mechanical

274
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:46,365
Speaker 5:  Keyboard, bring the razor mouse, no laptop allowed next week.

275
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,005
Speaker 4:  You do not want me to bring a mechanical keyboard to the ver Chest.

276
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,205
Speaker 5:  I mean I do

277
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:54,445
Speaker 4:  For our audience's sake alone, you do not want that amount of noise in this

278
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:54,605
Speaker 4:  room.

279
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:56,885
Speaker 6:  Our audio engineer would not be a fan.

280
00:14:56,885 --> 00:14:58,445
Speaker 4:  Now he can AI it right out.

281
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:00,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's no problem. NVIDIA's got a thing for

282
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:03,285
Speaker 4:  That All. right. Let's talk about some actual news. There's a bunch of actual

283
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:06,405
Speaker 4:  news. We should start with Apple 'cause there's a bunch of Apple News including

284
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,205
Speaker 4:  an event. Yep. So there was some rumor

285
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:14,165
Speaker 4:  buildup late last week, early this week that Apple's gonna have some max.

286
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,245
Speaker 4:  A lot of people didn't believe it. 'cause we're just,

287
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:16,845
Speaker 5:  It's

288
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,085
Speaker 4:  Late in the year. It's late in the year. Yeah.

289
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:21,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We have passed the point typically where Apple is commonly going

290
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,925
Speaker 5:  to release products and there have been some rumors that there were gonna

291
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,205
Speaker 5:  be no iPads for the rest of the year and no max for the rest of the year.

292
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,485
Speaker 5:  And then Apple did the thing where they launched that stupid pencil that

293
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:32,205
Speaker 5:  we talked about last week. So everybody was like, okay, well if they were

294
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:34,045
Speaker 5:  gonna have another event Yeah. Where they were gonna launch the pencil, why

295
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:36,965
Speaker 5:  would they do this this way? I think it's just 'cause it's stupid. They wanted

296
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:39,805
Speaker 5:  to Gannett outta the way. So yeah, there were a lot of good reasons to think

297
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,485
Speaker 5:  there wasn't gonna be an event. And then all of a sudden out of nowhere we

298
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:43,445
Speaker 5:  have an event. Yeah.

299
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:47,925
Speaker 4:  So Monday night at night. Yeah. The night before

300
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:51,765
Speaker 4:  Halloween it's called Scary. Fast. That's the

301
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:55,525
Speaker 4:  name on the invite. Streaming only. And we believe it's gonna be

302
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:55,765
Speaker 4:  Max.

303
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:59,365
Speaker 5:  We assume it's gonna be Max because it's like the most likely thing. And

304
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:02,845
Speaker 5:  there's been some reporting about it. The M three we think coming to

305
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:06,845
Speaker 5:  MacBook Pros. Okay. Yeah. And potentially a new 24 inch iMac. All of that

306
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:08,565
Speaker 5:  stuff is kind of overdue.

307
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:10,045
Speaker 6:  No. 27 inch,

308
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:12,125
Speaker 5:  Which drives me insane.

309
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:15,365
Speaker 4:  I think there John, John Gru believe believes it'll be a 27 inch.

310
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:19,725
Speaker 5:  I hope So I think John Gruber might be the witch casting. Yeah.

311
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,925
Speaker 5:  Which is a term that I love very much. I hope he's right. I really

312
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:27,765
Speaker 5:  do. But yeah, the, the 24 inch iMac is pretty overdue for

313
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:31,685
Speaker 5:  an update at this point. And I think the 27 inch iMac is just the studio

314
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:34,845
Speaker 5:  display and the Mac Studio. Now I think that's how Apple sees it. It's wrong.

315
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:38,405
Speaker 5:  And I hope they changed their mind. But yeah, that and MacBook Pros, which

316
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:42,245
Speaker 5:  doesn't really seem like it merits a whole event. They don't seem to

317
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,205
Speaker 5:  have invited anybody to this. It's a purely

318
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:46,725
Speaker 4:  Virtual, here's what I believe event, here's what I believe about this event.

319
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,805
Speaker 6:  I've heard this theory already.

320
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:53,165
Speaker 4:  Apple is looking at its own streaming numbers. They know it's probably

321
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:56,805
Speaker 4:  just chip bumps to existing form factors. A reasonable guess. Yeah. Right.

322
00:16:57,585 --> 00:17:01,405
Speaker 4:  And they know that people will watch their events no matter what. So

323
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:04,965
Speaker 4:  they're gonna do a primetime infomercial that millions of people are gonna

324
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:08,925
Speaker 4:  watch. And it's just gonna be a weird spooky Halloween themed TV

325
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,365
Speaker 4:  show about the Mac.

326
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:13,165
Speaker 5:  Okay. I have several questions. Yeah. Question number one, does Tim Cook

327
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:13,685
Speaker 5:  come out in costume?

328
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,285
Speaker 6:  Yes. Frankenstein or Frankenstein's Monster.

329
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:18,845
Speaker 4:  You think he's gonna be Frankenstein's monster? Like

330
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:21,645
Speaker 6:  I just wanna see, I mean mainly because I wanna see Tim Cook with like a

331
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:25,445
Speaker 6:  green face just like presenting products. 'cause

332
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:25,885
Speaker 6:  it'd be funny.

333
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,445
Speaker 4:  What do you think the maximum amount of costume Tim Cook would wear is probably

334
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,925
Speaker 4:  not, I think about this 'cause my, my parents are coming this weekend to

335
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:36,285
Speaker 4:  do our first Halloween with Max in the new town. And I told my mom, I was

336
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,765
Speaker 4:  like, I'm gonna buy you costumes. And she was, she just made this noise

337
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,165
Speaker 5:  Like,

338
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:43,965
Speaker 4:  She was like, like, and I was like, okay, what if I just get you like a witch's

339
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,925
Speaker 4:  hat? And she's like, okay, what about a witch's cloak? I got my dad a big

340
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,685
Speaker 4:  silly haggard beard and I'm just seeing how far I can push it. Like how many

341
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:55,605
Speaker 4:  additional elements I can add. And like suddenly they will just be in

342
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:58,205
Speaker 4:  full kit and I don't think I'm gonna get there. I think I'm gonna get to

343
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,565
Speaker 4:  two elements and we're gonna stop.

344
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:03,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I feel like you can do like hat and beard. Yeah. And that's about as

345
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:04,165
Speaker 5:  far as you're gonna get. Yeah.

346
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:07,045
Speaker 4:  So what, how many elements do you think we can get on Tim Cook?

347
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:08,925
Speaker 6:  Oh, I think he goes all the way. You

348
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:10,525
Speaker 4:  Think, you think he's just a full commit?

349
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,245
Speaker 5:  No, Craig goes all the way. Yeah,

350
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:12,845
Speaker 4:  I know Craig goes

351
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:14,725
Speaker 5:  All way, way that Craig would be unrecognizable. Craig

352
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,405
Speaker 4:  Full Dracula is my belief.

353
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:17,765
Speaker 5:  Ooh, that's good. Ooh.

354
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:19,165
Speaker 6:  With the hair.

355
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,125
Speaker 4:  Because the hair, because you get the big flowy Dracula You know and

356
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,205
Speaker 6:  Like the, the little cavader whatever that, that Dracula always wears.

357
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:27,085
Speaker 5:  I think Tim Cook is gonna be more like,

358
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:30,085
Speaker 4:  I want come back to Dracula always wears a Ava.

359
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,205
Speaker 6:  Is it whatever the thing is. He wears

360
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:36,565
Speaker 4:  Fashion. I only, I only recognize the Blade Dracula. Drake, please

361
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:37,205
Speaker 4:  continue. Dick.

362
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:39,125
Speaker 5:  I have Drake. So for Dracula,

363
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,925
Speaker 4:  That's what they call him in this movie.

364
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:45,365
Speaker 5:  That rules, I think Tim Cook is more like the, like in the office they

365
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:49,125
Speaker 5:  have a Halloween episode and Jim shows up with a, just a name

366
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:50,085
Speaker 5:  tag on that says Dave

367
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,005
Speaker 5:  and Dwight's like what are you for Halloween? And he points at it and goes,

368
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:56,965
Speaker 5:  I'm Dave. I feel like that's about the level of costume out Spectrum Tip

369
00:18:56,965 --> 00:19:00,085
Speaker 5:  Cook. Yeah. He's gonna wear like a full zip instead of a quarter sip and

370
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:01,725
Speaker 5:  be like Dave Halloween

371
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:05,765
Speaker 4:  All. right. But this is just my general theory here Yeah. Is that Apple

372
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:09,845
Speaker 4:  owns a streaming service. They have Hollywood stars and celebrities

373
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:13,325
Speaker 4:  at their beck and call and they know their numbers. They know they can attract

374
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:17,245
Speaker 4:  attention on Prime time on a Monday up against Monday night football. And

375
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:20,685
Speaker 4:  that's gonna be fine for them. So no other company can do this. I

376
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:23,765
Speaker 5:  Agree with everything you just said. I just don't understand tactically why

377
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:26,445
Speaker 5:  you would do it for a boring event and not the iPhone.

378
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:30,125
Speaker 6:  This is, this is what I keep getting stuck on is like

379
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:31,565
Speaker 6:  why now?

380
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:32,885
Speaker 4:  So I. Yeah.

381
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:36,085
Speaker 5:  Why, why make your Ultraflex spec bumps to laptops? Unless,

382
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:37,805
Speaker 6:  Wait. No, no. Tim Cook goes for because

383
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:41,805
Speaker 4:  Because the stakes are low. They have to, when it's the iPhone,

384
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:45,685
Speaker 4:  all the analysts have to come, the partners have to come, the

385
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:49,605
Speaker 4:  stock price has to go up or down. They have to do, we have to be there.

386
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,405
Speaker 4:  The press has to be there and do the hands on, like there's a whole bunch

387
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:56,885
Speaker 4:  of stuff you gotta do with the iPhone. And they're still veering that towards

388
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:58,605
Speaker 4:  full infomercial. Yeah.

389
00:19:58,705 --> 00:19:59,085
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah.

390
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:03,535
Speaker 4:  This, if it's just a bunch of spec bumps to a Mac, they

391
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,495
Speaker 4:  don't have to do any of that stuff.

392
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,695
Speaker 6:  Who was the last I I, I was trying to

393
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:10,135
Speaker 4:  Think about this. So you, you can test the conceit that you can move the

394
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:11,735
Speaker 4:  event to Prime time. Yeah.

395
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:15,575
Speaker 5:  Right. Whereas if you try it with the iPhone and it flops, you've made a

396
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:16,615
Speaker 5:  huge mistake. Right. Whereas

397
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,455
Speaker 4:  This is just like, we're just having fun in Halloween. That's interesting.

398
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:23,095
Speaker 4:  But I think their events are headed inexorably in this

399
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:23,535
Speaker 4:  direction.

400
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:27,335
Speaker 6:  Who was the last person to do a primetime infomercial? Because all I could

401
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:30,655
Speaker 6:  think of was the Victoria's Secret fashion show. And like it's a good,

402
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:31,215
Speaker 5:  There's a reason

403
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:34,375
Speaker 4:  If Apple brings out Taylor Swift and Fallout Boy for this thing, it's all

404
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:34,615
Speaker 4:  of,

405
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:39,015
Speaker 5:  I mean, what this makes me think of is that event Apple had, Jesus,

406
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:43,095
Speaker 5:  I dunno five years ago when they brought out the all the Apple TV people.

407
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,615
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it was just a parade of celebrities with nothing to show. It was

408
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:49,685
Speaker 5:  the worst Apple event I remember that ever. We're all just sitting in the

409
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:51,845
Speaker 5:  room and it was a bunch of people being like, here's a TV show we're talking

410
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:54,805
Speaker 5:  about making remember, do you have anything to show us? And then they like

411
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:58,365
Speaker 5:  had a couple of trailers at the end, but it was just a lot of like Camille

412
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:00,205
Speaker 5:  Najani being like, I might make a TV show.

413
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,085
Speaker 6:  Remember there was one like an acting exercise and they were like, listen

414
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:05,165
Speaker 6:  to the wind. Yeah. The theater.

415
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:05,885
Speaker 5:  Some

416
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:08,285
Speaker 4:  Deeply, this was before they had shows. They didn't show a lot of trailers.

417
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:10,365
Speaker 4:  They, they were just like, Oprah's here. And she's like, they're in a billion

418
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:11,165
Speaker 4:  pockets. Right.

419
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:14,765
Speaker 5:  And the pitch was, look at all these celebrities who will do stuff with us.

420
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I would guess if you're gonna do something like this again, I would

421
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:21,285
Speaker 5:  not be shocked if there are musical guests, which Apple really hasn't done

422
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,045
Speaker 5:  in a while. If there are

423
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:25,365
Speaker 6:  Lots of Heidi celebrities, what Kme is there?

424
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:26,725
Speaker 5:  It's just because

425
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:27,125
Speaker 6:  Goes

426
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,805
Speaker 5:  All out. It's a Victoria's Secret fashion show. No,

427
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:32,045
Speaker 6:  No. She goes all out for Halloween. Like remember the year she dressed as

428
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:32,325
Speaker 6:  a worm?

429
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:38,005
Speaker 4:  Tim Cook there with a, a name tag that says Dave and then it's Heidi Klum

430
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:38,525
Speaker 4:  in full Worm.

431
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:41,245
Speaker 6:  That's all. Like, that's This is how you tv.

432
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:44,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. See this is how you make a spectacle on television. I think I watched

433
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,885
Speaker 4:  that. This is just my theory. It could just be a, a bogged standard Mac

434
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:51,365
Speaker 4:  event. I just think if you're gonna program something of this in prime time

435
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:55,485
Speaker 4:  the night before Halloween course, you definitely have CVAs. That's,

436
00:21:55,485 --> 00:21:59,285
Speaker 4:  that's a given. Yeah. But I think the most important piece of the puzzle

437
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:02,925
Speaker 4:  is like, does Apple think that it is primetime entertainment?

438
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:06,125
Speaker 5:  Oh, I absolutely think it does. Yeah. No. Hundred percent. I I think that's

439
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:06,205
Speaker 5:  right

440
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:09,205
Speaker 4:  Because you, you have to believe that about yourself in order to attract

441
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:11,445
Speaker 4:  eyeballs at this time. And I think they'll be successful. I think a lot of

442
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:14,685
Speaker 4:  people are gonna watch this thing. All of us are gonna be weight on Pin pins

443
00:22:14,685 --> 00:22:18,525
Speaker 4:  and needles success for 27 inch max, 27 time max. There's only

444
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:21,845
Speaker 4:  one metric of success. That's true. Do I buy a new 27 inch iMac? Well,

445
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:25,485
Speaker 6:  No. If they do it at primetime, are they truly competing, competing with

446
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:28,725
Speaker 6:  primetime tv? Are we gonna see like, like is that what we need to measure

447
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:31,885
Speaker 6:  them against or just other Apple events? Like do we need to measure them

448
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:32,405
Speaker 6:  against money?

449
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,605
Speaker 4:  Well, there's no measure. I have no idea how many people watch that.

450
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:37,125
Speaker 5:  You see like the concurrent numbers on YouTube or whatever. But that's only

451
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,925
Speaker 5:  part of it. I think there's been a bunch of interesting news this week. Like

452
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:43,485
Speaker 5:  Apple TV plus got more expensive as a lot of their services did. There was

453
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:47,245
Speaker 5:  the news from Bloomberg that Apple is making yet more effort to

454
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:50,365
Speaker 5:  consolidate everything into the TV space. It just feels like we are definitely

455
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:53,565
Speaker 5:  at this moment where Apple is trying to flex itself as an entertainment company.

456
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:57,485
Speaker 5:  And I think the idea that it's, it's going to treat its stuff as like

457
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,725
Speaker 5:  huge TV and they're gonna start to have like Apple event upfronts I think

458
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:03,805
Speaker 5:  is like not true. But there's definitely a thing that's happening that Apple

459
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,485
Speaker 5:  believes everyone will pay attention no matter what it does. Yeah.

460
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:11,205
Speaker 5:  I still don't understand why that leads you to say, let's do this at 8:00 PM

461
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:15,085
Speaker 5:  Eastern on a Monday night. Just 'cause we can like Yeah, that's weird.

462
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:19,325
Speaker 5:  But I think it'll work like it, it's, it's gonna work in the sense that a

463
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:21,605
Speaker 5:  lot of people are going to pay attention because people always pay attention

464
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:25,045
Speaker 5:  because it's Apple. And the funniest part of this is no other company has

465
00:23:25,045 --> 00:23:28,885
Speaker 5:  been able to get to where Apple was like 10 years ago in terms of making

466
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:32,845
Speaker 5:  their events an event. Sony tried really hard for a long time. Samsung continues

467
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:33,165
Speaker 5:  to try.

468
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:36,285
Speaker 4:  Sony did have Taylor Swift. I just won't put that out there. That's the

469
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:37,725
Speaker 5:  Bar. Yeah. Sony literally had Taylor Swift.

470
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:40,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But it wasn't good. It was like deeply uncomfortable.

471
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:44,085
Speaker 4:  It was it They were doing three D TVs. It was not like a great time.

472
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:46,900
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They said look at the tv. Taylor Swift is on instead

473
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,500
Speaker 4:  Of Taylor Swift, instead

474
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:47,860
Speaker 5:  Of looking at

475
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,605
Speaker 6:  Taylor Swift. Swift. And she wasn't like Taylor Swift yet. She was like Taylor

476
00:23:50,615 --> 00:23:50,965
Speaker 6:  Swift.

477
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:53,085
Speaker 5:  Taylor Swift has always been Taylor Swift. Oh.

478
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:54,125
Speaker 6:  But there's like different degrees.

479
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:54,805
Speaker 4:  I'm so afraid

480
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:55,445
Speaker 6:  I'm so

481
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:57,085
Speaker 4:  Swift. There was this conversation where

482
00:23:57,085 --> 00:24:00,085
Speaker 6:  I confused her with Jessica Simpson and that's where she was at. Then you,

483
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:01,045
Speaker 5:  That feels like a problem. I

484
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:02,885
Speaker 4:  Why you? I'm worried about your physical safety.

485
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:08,125
Speaker 6:  I love Taylor Swift. I'm a huge fan of the Aras Tour.

486
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:11,845
Speaker 5:  The the cool move for Apple because it's going against Monday night football,

487
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:15,685
Speaker 5:  would be to bring Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey. That's how you won up

488
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:16,085
Speaker 5:  Sony.

489
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:17,245
Speaker 4:  You

490
00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:19,165
Speaker 5:  Get them to publicly announce their relationship.

491
00:24:19,865 --> 00:24:22,205
Speaker 4:  So we think it's chip bumps. We're not doing that.

492
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:24,805
Speaker 6:  No, it's, it's, I like this plan better.

493
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:27,405
Speaker 4:  It's Tim Cook is dressed up as Taylor Swift

494
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:29,165
Speaker 5:  And Craig is Travis Kelsey.

495
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:31,925
Speaker 4:  You see what I'm saying? It's, and it is a very obvious

496
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:32,805
Speaker 5:  One. All. right? Well we figured it out.

497
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,205
Speaker 4:  We figured it out. So we think we, we think we're getting m threes and MacBook

498
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:38,765
Speaker 4:  Pros. We think we're getting a 24 inch iMac refresh. We'll see.

499
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:42,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Then there's some other stuff leaked. Germin had new

500
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:45,885
Speaker 4:  AirPods. Apparently the third gen AirPods are not selling well people are

501
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,725
Speaker 4:  just buying the cheaper older ones. 'cause if you're in that middle, why

502
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:51,885
Speaker 4:  not go all the way to the pros is basically my feeling. Yeah.

503
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:54,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think there are basically two kinds of AirPod buyers right now. There

504
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:58,045
Speaker 5:  are people who buy the newest pros because they're the best ones and they're

505
00:24:58,045 --> 00:25:01,125
Speaker 5:  very good. And there are people who buy the thing that goes on sale at Costco.

506
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:04,685
Speaker 5:  Yep. Yep. I am the person who bought them on sale at Costco. I literally

507
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:08,525
Speaker 5:  could not tell you what generation of AirPods I have. And I don't care because

508
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:11,645
Speaker 5:  they're AirPods. Right. I don't like the pros because I don't like the sticking

509
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:15,365
Speaker 5:  them in the ear canals. That just feels bad in my ears. But I think that's

510
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:19,165
Speaker 5:  the case now. There's, they have entry level AirPods and new pros and

511
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:20,925
Speaker 5:  anything in between. I

512
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:24,085
Speaker 4:  Don't know that there's, there's yet another kind of buyer. Okay. And I have

513
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:27,965
Speaker 4:  seen them. And it's not Costco. It's the people who buy the knockoff AirPod

514
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:31,085
Speaker 4:  Maxes at Home Depot, which are just in the middle of the store at

515
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:31,565
Speaker 5:  Home Depot.

516
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:35,365
Speaker 4:  I see, I see. People pick this. I met, we bought a new house, I mean Home

517
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:36,125
Speaker 4:  Depot every weekend.

518
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:37,565
Speaker 6:  That's where you live now.

519
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:41,645
Speaker 4:  It's just like where I'm going. And I watch people walk by this display

520
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:45,605
Speaker 4:  of knockoff AirPod Maxes at the Home Depot and they pick up the box

521
00:25:45,705 --> 00:25:49,365
Speaker 4:  and I look at them and I, I've seen at least two people do like a

522
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:53,205
Speaker 4:  furtive look around. 'cause 'cause they know, and then they walk

523
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:56,805
Speaker 4:  away with the box and I'm like, oh. All the, there's a lot of people on the

524
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,685
Speaker 4:  New York City subway wearing the Home Depot Bare Black Maxes. Wow. And I

525
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:04,445
Speaker 4:  don't even know like why is Home Depot allowed to sell how fully counterfeit

526
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:08,285
Speaker 4:  products? But it's happening every weekend. I see this. They're like 20 bucks.

527
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:10,525
Speaker 4:  Like David's scrolling through them right now. Okay. I

528
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:14,165
Speaker 5:  I can, I can offer you a pair of a hundred dollars skull candies

529
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:18,365
Speaker 5:  or I can offer you a $20 pair of Zoomy sound play wireless

530
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:19,765
Speaker 5:  over ear headphones. They

531
00:26:19,765 --> 00:26:20,805
Speaker 4:  Look exactly like AirPod

532
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:22,685
Speaker 5:  Maxes for 1997. And do look alarmingly.

533
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:25,965
Speaker 4:  I'm telling you on the New York City subways, a lot of people are wearing

534
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:28,885
Speaker 4:  $20 Home Depot. AirPod Maxes. This

535
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:30,685
Speaker 6:  Lady's just vibing. She's having a great time.

536
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:34,525
Speaker 5:  Neli, I have great news. They have HD sound for an immersive music experience.

537
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:37,645
Speaker 4:  This is, I'm just telling you, I think there's, I think this is a third category.

538
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:41,165
Speaker 4:  You've got the people, you've got the two categories of AirPod buyers. Yeah.

539
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:45,085
Speaker 4:  And then, and then you have the whatever that looks fine. It looks

540
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:47,445
Speaker 4:  like the thing Oh sure. That's expensive. And I,

541
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:50,525
Speaker 5:  That's why like you, you go to Walgreens and they just like sell headphones

542
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:53,205
Speaker 5:  in line and it's like who buys these? And it's like some, some people buy

543
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:53,285
Speaker 5:  them.

544
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:56,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And So I. I think that those middle, the third gen AirPods, like the

545
00:26:56,925 --> 00:27:00,245
Speaker 4:  good ones in the middle. I think Apple expected those to be the big seller.

546
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:04,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But actually you're, you're being squeezed by Home Depot on the bottom

547
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:07,885
Speaker 4:  and at the top people actually give a shit and they're gonna buy the best

548
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:08,565
Speaker 4:  ones. Right.

549
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:12,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. No, I think that's right. But I do think it's exciting to see, frankly

550
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:16,325
Speaker 5:  Apple like continue to push what AirPods can be. 'cause it sort of seemed

551
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:19,405
Speaker 5:  like for the last couple of years they were just like, well we won.

552
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:24,205
Speaker 5:  AirPods are like everywhere. Everybody has them. You either have AirPods

553
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:25,005
Speaker 5:  or you have the other ones.

554
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:26,685
Speaker 4:  But the problem is they're now commodified.

555
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:30,205
Speaker 5:  Yes, exactly. And now it's like they're, they're pushing on some of the stuff.

556
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:33,045
Speaker 5:  I think the new ones supposedly are gonna get, they're gonna have

557
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:36,965
Speaker 6:  Shorter noise cancellation, which is very upsetting if you like

558
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:40,765
Speaker 6:  to use Bluetooth headphones for audio stuff. Like for talking Yeah.

559
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:41,645
Speaker 5:  I had like longer stems.

560
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:45,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I want, I was like, I, that was the part I was like, no. At my, my

561
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:45,885
Speaker 6:  desk. I

562
00:27:45,885 --> 00:27:48,525
Speaker 5:  Would like AirPods that are basically like dental headgear that kind of go

563
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:51,045
Speaker 5:  all the way down around your chin. It's just one piece.

564
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:51,525
Speaker 4:  Wow.

565
00:27:51,985 --> 00:27:52,405
Speaker 5:  Is a good idea.

566
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:53,765
Speaker 6:  Get the Ray band metas. That's what you

567
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,005
Speaker 4:  Do. They still make neck buds. Those like things that you

568
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,565
Speaker 5:  Were Oh yeah. You can still get 'em back buds.

569
00:27:58,585 --> 00:27:59,525
Speaker 4:  That's you baby. Yeah.

570
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:01,965
Speaker 6:  The Walgreens checkout counter where you

571
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:04,845
Speaker 4:  Get those All. right. So that's the, we we don't know when that's happening,

572
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:08,605
Speaker 4:  but they're coming. Yep. You see them reinventing that lineup because

573
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:12,565
Speaker 4:  I, I think wireless earbuds total commodities now. Yeah. They have to keep

574
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,365
Speaker 4:  pushing 'em up. Alex you, we've been talking about price hike with you

575
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:20,605
Speaker 4:  I think every week now it's like, it's another one. Throw a dart at the board

576
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:24,565
Speaker 4:  of streaming services and it's like the price is going up 9 99

577
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:27,565
Speaker 4:  for Apple TV plus. Yeah. Seems very high.

578
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:31,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I really enjoy Apple TV Plus there's one show on it that's one

579
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:35,685
Speaker 6:  of my top 10 shows of all time. I'll watch it like every six months. It's

580
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:36,165
Speaker 6:  like my office.

581
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:40,005
Speaker 5:  I think Apple TV's hit rate is higher than any other stream service.

582
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:42,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But it's also got 12 shows. I mean

583
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:46,165
Speaker 4:  No, it's got more now. It's got more now, but I disagree that it's hit rate

584
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:50,085
Speaker 4:  is higher. Really? I think it has hits, which is unlike other streaming

585
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:50,365
Speaker 4:  services.

586
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:53,245
Speaker 6:  Is this because you watch the Octavia Spencer show and it's not very good.

587
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:56,605
Speaker 4:  Most of the show. That's what I mean. They make a lot of

588
00:28:57,405 --> 00:29:01,205
Speaker 4:  brilliantly produced excellent looking nothing c Yeah.

589
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:04,965
Speaker 4:  See a show in which if you just go look at the Reddit for the show C

590
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:09,125
Speaker 4:  starring Jason Momoa, the most common question in that Reddit is

591
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:13,525
Speaker 4:  can they see? Because the show is not committed to its own

592
00:29:13,595 --> 00:29:14,085
Speaker 4:  conceit.

593
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:18,005
Speaker 6:  It's complicated guys. It just depends on who, which character you're talking

594
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:18,765
Speaker 6:  about. But it

595
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:19,125
Speaker 4:  Is beautiful.

596
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,325
Speaker 6:  It's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah.

597
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:22,005
Speaker 4:  But are you looking at the Reddit?

598
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:26,085
Speaker 5:  No, no. I'm looking at the, I mean I, I honestly, I stand by this like,

599
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:30,165
Speaker 5:  there are very few disaster shows on

600
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:30,445
Speaker 5:  Apple

601
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:31,285
Speaker 6:  Tv. That's true. That's true.

602
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:35,405
Speaker 5:  Everything on there with the exception of the morning show, which is full

603
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:37,005
Speaker 5:  honest to God garbage.

604
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:38,445
Speaker 4:  No, it's, wow.

605
00:29:38,795 --> 00:29:42,205
Speaker 6:  It's it's a soap opera. It is so soap opera, so

606
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:46,205
Speaker 6:  melodramatic that like we know where Reese Witherspoon

607
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:47,285
Speaker 6:  was on January 6th.

608
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:47,845
Speaker 5:  It

609
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:50,165
Speaker 6:  But like that's a spoiler. I'm so sorry. It

610
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:53,565
Speaker 5:  It's, it's just like, what if you spent all the money in the world to make

611
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:54,165
Speaker 5:  a soap opera?

612
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:57,765
Speaker 6:  Yes. That's why I love it. I'm like, wow, we're finally getting prestige

613
00:29:57,765 --> 00:30:00,965
Speaker 6:  show soap operas. But but yeah, there the prices are

614
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:05,085
Speaker 6:  $10 a month is, is hard to, to stomach. Especially one of our

615
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:08,605
Speaker 6:  commenters after we put the story up, just broke it down. And by percentages

616
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:12,525
Speaker 6:  Apple TV is going up about 43%. Wow. Apple Arcade is

617
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:16,125
Speaker 6:  40%. Apple News is 30% overall average. It's 37%.

618
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:19,605
Speaker 6:  Does it feel like you're getting 37% more service? I

619
00:30:19,605 --> 00:30:21,165
Speaker 5:  Would say can I get a 37% raise?

620
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:23,885
Speaker 6:  Gotta gotta maintain no sense.

621
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:25,445
Speaker 4:  No. Only if you're bundled with three other people.

622
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:29,965
Speaker 5:  To me, what's very obvious here is Apple is trying to get everybody to subscribe

623
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:30,525
Speaker 5:  to Apple One.

624
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, you can see it. Yeah. The Apple one is only going up five bucks.

625
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:36,925
Speaker 4:  Apple one Premier for families is going up five bucks.

626
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:41,325
Speaker 5:  And if you use Apple Arcade and Apple

627
00:30:41,945 --> 00:30:45,885
Speaker 5:  TV plus that's that price right there. Done. Everything else is

628
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:49,645
Speaker 5:  gravy. You could all have Apple Services. Like it's so transparently a better

629
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:53,045
Speaker 5:  deal to be on Apple one than to be on some other missed patch of their

630
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:56,325
Speaker 6:  Services. Only became a, a better deal. Like this program like right now.

631
00:30:56,325 --> 00:30:58,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because, because I was actually trying to switch

632
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:02,245
Speaker 6:  over to Apple one like two or three weeks ago and I did all the math and

633
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:05,045
Speaker 6:  I was like, well I don't use some of this stuff. Right. So I'm not gonna

634
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:05,325
Speaker 6:  do this.

635
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:09,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. If you like, if you use News Plus and fitness and all of that stuff,

636
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:13,285
Speaker 5:  it's been a better deal for a while. But right now it's like if you use two

637
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:13,645
Speaker 5:  things,

638
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:16,445
Speaker 6:  It's a much better deal. It's better. Yeah. Now I'm really

639
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:20,045
Speaker 4:  Mad. I have to say, there's no way anyone should pay

640
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,685
Speaker 4:  1299 a month for Apple News Plus. No,

641
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:23,285
Speaker 5:  That's absurd.

642
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,445
Speaker 6:  Someone out there is doing it. I mean it's Tim Cook,

643
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:29,605
Speaker 4:  Someone else. I think it's just coming. It's gotta be coming in the bundle.

644
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:33,125
Speaker 4:  But as an all la cart subscription, unless you are

645
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36,845
Speaker 4:  extremely committed to reading PDF's, exterior review, which I am. And

646
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:40,565
Speaker 4:  that's a bad deal. Yeah. Like that just, that's so expensive.

647
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,085
Speaker 4:  That's more than the TV service. Yeah.

648
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:47,045
Speaker 5:  And you get pay walled news, which is good. Yay for money for the news industry,

649
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,445
Speaker 5:  but there are not very many people for whom that's gonna be worth $13 a month.

650
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:51,285
Speaker 5:  Just don't see

651
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,925
Speaker 4:  It. Right. And that so that now we're just like fully in the bundle. Yeah.

652
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Other bit of Apple News. iOS

653
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,445
Speaker 4:  17.2 Beta is out. Yeah.

654
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:02,325
Speaker 5:  This is the other thing we'll probably hear more about on Monday. I would

655
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:05,085
Speaker 5:  guess. It's a lot of little things. The big thing is the Journal app is finally

656
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:08,805
Speaker 5:  coming. I don't know why it took this long. I'm not sure anyone caress

657
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:10,165
Speaker 5:  that the Journal app exists.

658
00:32:10,325 --> 00:32:12,685
Speaker 6:  I I forgot about the Journal app until you just said that.

659
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:16,885
Speaker 5:  I think. I think you and a lot of people, but now it's coming. My guess

660
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:20,885
Speaker 5:  would be, so the developer Beta is out now. My guess would be we'll get some

661
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:24,605
Speaker 5:  kind of public Beta pretty fast or it'll just hit like it's a 0.2

662
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:27,805
Speaker 5:  update. It's not Yeah. Ultimately all that exciting. But they will probably

663
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:29,645
Speaker 5:  talk about the Turtle app on Monday would be my

664
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:33,165
Speaker 4:  Guess. I don't think So I think it's all, all Max and Gotcha. It's a, it's

665
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:36,285
Speaker 4:  gonna be a TV show. Yeah. Ooh, ooh.

666
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:41,485
Speaker 4:  Spooky fast. 27 inches. Just trying to manifest

667
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:44,765
Speaker 4:  it. And then we have a big story this week about double tap hit the Apple

668
00:32:44,765 --> 00:32:47,605
Speaker 4:  watches. V has a story about how It works, which is pretty cool.

669
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:48,805
Speaker 6:  It seems really,

670
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:52,005
Speaker 4:  Really cool. I don't buy that, it can't come to my Apple Watch Ultra, by

671
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:52,165
Speaker 4:  the way,

672
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:53,925
Speaker 6:  Or my, my series six

673
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:55,685
Speaker 4:  Or my series two.

674
00:32:57,265 --> 00:33:00,845
Speaker 4:  But it, it does seem really cool. The one thing that's interesting is you

675
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,085
Speaker 4:  have to have your display on for it to work. Yeah. I hate that.

676
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:07,445
Speaker 5:  And it doesn't seem to be super reliable. Like it's definitely a work

677
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:10,605
Speaker 5:  in progress, this feature. But it's a cool idea. And it seems to be

678
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:14,725
Speaker 5:  like these stories really interesting just in getting into how complicated

679
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:18,165
Speaker 5:  something like this is to make and just like, if you think about what your

680
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:21,685
Speaker 5:  hands are doing all the time, it's a noisy Yeah. Input

681
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:24,885
Speaker 5:  mechanism. So it's, it's just, it was neat to read her story and see all

682
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:25,805
Speaker 5:  the stuff it takes to do it.

683
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:28,405
Speaker 4:  I'm, I dunno about you, but I'm constantly clenching my fists

684
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,605
Speaker 6:  Just sitting there like the, the, the meme of Arthur just,

685
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:37,125
Speaker 4:  Just furious. Bring me Drake. What if they have

686
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:40,205
Speaker 4:  actual Drake? What if they had Drake dressed up as Dracula? That's my prediction

687
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:43,165
Speaker 4:  for the Apple event. Everybody there. It's there. It's no 27 inch iMac. Drake

688
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,245
Speaker 4:  dressed up as Dracula.

689
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:48,005
Speaker 6:  No, no actual Apple stuff at all. It's just gonna be Tim hanging out with

690
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:48,525
Speaker 6:  his friends. That

691
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:52,205
Speaker 5:  Would be the true flex. No new products. Yeah. Just hanging out. Or

692
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,365
Speaker 6:  They show off the apple pens. The new pencil. Oh

693
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:54,645
Speaker 7:  God.

694
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:57,685
Speaker 6:  Just the pencil.

695
00:33:58,255 --> 00:33:58,885
Speaker 5:  Death first.

696
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:02,285
Speaker 4:  All. right. We gotta take a break. We're gonna come back and David's gonna

697
00:34:02,285 --> 00:34:05,405
Speaker 4:  execute this idea of putting social networks on the go 90 scale. We'll be

698
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:05,645
Speaker 4:  right back.

699
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:10,505
Speaker 7:  Sure.

700
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:27,995
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back on The Vergecast. The show that we make every week.

701
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:29,515
Speaker 4:  We

702
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:31,155
Speaker 5:  May have just been watching Blade Trinity.

703
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:35,435
Speaker 4:  I'm still thinking about Blade Trinity. It's a great movie.

704
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:38,555
Speaker 6:  It's a really good movie. No, I mean it's a watchable movie. That's

705
00:36:38,585 --> 00:36:39,195
Speaker 5:  It's a movie.

706
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:43,355
Speaker 6:  It's a movie. You will have a good time watching but you probably

707
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:45,795
Speaker 6:  won't like earnestly recommend to another person.

708
00:36:45,985 --> 00:36:49,475
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So you're just one of those people who really likes bad things. Yes.

709
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:50,755
Speaker 6:  I like it when

710
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:53,555
Speaker 5:  A bad thing or like because they're bad. Yeah. You're like, I'm glad that

711
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:54,635
Speaker 5:  this is terrible and exists.

712
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:58,355
Speaker 4:  No, it's bad. It's bad in the right way. Right, right. Like, like it's a

713
00:36:58,355 --> 00:37:00,475
Speaker 4:  it's a well made bad movie.

714
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:04,675
Speaker 6:  It's entertaining. It's just not good. Like the morning

715
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:05,035
Speaker 6:  show.

716
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,675
Speaker 5:  No. See I disagree with every part of that about the morning show. Yeah.

717
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:12,155
Speaker 4:  There's some things that are like bad and sloppy and Ill considered and not

718
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:16,115
Speaker 4:  coherent. Every lifetime movie Blade Trinity is like, they had an

719
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:20,075
Speaker 4:  idea and they executed the hell of the idea and it just wasn't a

720
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:20,475
Speaker 4:  good idea.

721
00:37:20,835 --> 00:37:23,675
Speaker 5:  Yeah. All, right? Yeah. That I can appreciate. Yeah. Right. Like you, you

722
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:27,835
Speaker 5:  executed your whole vision perfectly. Yeah. And you shouldn't have, there's

723
00:37:27,835 --> 00:37:27,915
Speaker 5:  not

724
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:31,795
Speaker 4:  A, there's not a frame of Blade Trinity where they weren't like, this

725
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:33,315
Speaker 4:  isn't exactly what I wanted.

726
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:35,315
Speaker 5:  You just should have wanted something else.

727
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:36,915
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It should have just gone a different way.

728
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:37,475
Speaker 5:  Understood.

729
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:41,435
Speaker 4:  All. right. David, you, this is your baby and I believe a a,

730
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,555
Speaker 4:  a listener has requested that we do this. This

731
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:47,315
Speaker 5:  Was specifically requested. Okay. It's been a year as

732
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:50,795
Speaker 5:  you're listening to this on Friday, it has been exactly one year since the

733
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,515
Speaker 5:  Elon Musk acquisition of Twitter was made final. Obviously

734
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:58,075
Speaker 5:  Twitter is no longer both literally and

735
00:37:58,515 --> 00:38:02,315
Speaker 5:  metaphorically it's dead. We've had a year full of new ideas about

736
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:06,115
Speaker 5:  social. We've had a year of like would be coming and going. We've had a lot

737
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:09,555
Speaker 5:  of change. We've been talking about it a lot. And So I think what we haven't

738
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:13,315
Speaker 5:  done a lot of a over the last year is just talk about Twitter

739
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:16,555
Speaker 5:  as a product. Like we've talked a lot about the machinations of the company

740
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:20,115
Speaker 5:  and all the weird stuff going on, but like, is it still a good,

741
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:23,915
Speaker 5:  vibrant, thriving, potentially successful social platform?

742
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:28,395
Speaker 5:  And it seems like a good time to check in on all of the other ones that

743
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:32,155
Speaker 5:  are trying to be this thing of which there are an alarming number. Yeah.

744
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:36,085
Speaker 5:  You made some of these up, but an increasingly smaller number. Spoiler alert

745
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,925
Speaker 5:  for what we're about to get to. So what I figured we should do first is just

746
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:43,805
Speaker 5:  like, let's do, let's do the state of Twitter a little bit a year after

747
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:47,405
Speaker 5:  Elon Musk. Got it. Took it over. I actually don't think this is gonna take

748
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:51,125
Speaker 5:  very long because I don't think it's a particularly complicated opinion to

749
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,965
Speaker 5:  have anymore. I think if we'd had this debate three months ago, reasonable

750
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:57,285
Speaker 5:  people could disagree about the vibrancy of Twitter or X or whatever you

751
00:38:57,285 --> 00:39:00,925
Speaker 5:  wanna call it. I think at this point it is pretty much undeniable and

752
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:03,725
Speaker 5:  unavoidable that it is a worse platform and a dying one.

753
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:08,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But there's a lot of jackasses in the world that really like to use

754
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:12,205
Speaker 6:  x. Sure. Like what I want is it to be at an 80,

755
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:16,525
Speaker 6:  but I think the jackass factor brings it down to like a 45

756
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:17,085
Speaker 6:  or a 50

757
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:19,725
Speaker 5:  All. right. Well let, let's get to the scale in a sec. Okay. Sorry. 'cause

758
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:22,165
Speaker 5:  firstly I got excited NE's gonna have to give us a speech about what the

759
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,325
Speaker 5:  Go 90 scale is. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. A bunch of

760
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,165
Speaker 4:  Disclosures. I have to remind a bunch of people what go 90 is

761
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:29,565
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be a whole thing. Yeah. But, but I think like at this point

762
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:33,525
Speaker 5:  I, and I do think the question of is X going to continue to be around for

763
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:37,485
Speaker 5:  a long time is separate than is it vibrant and

764
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:40,445
Speaker 5:  cool and useful and like, is it culturally relevant in the way that it was?

765
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:40,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

766
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:40,965
Speaker 6:  Very

767
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:44,205
Speaker 5:  Different. I already feel like it is drastically less culturally relevant

768
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,685
Speaker 5:  than it was even 12 months ago.

769
00:39:45,945 --> 00:39:47,765
Speaker 6:  Yes, a hundred percent. Yeah.

770
00:39:48,065 --> 00:39:52,005
Speaker 4:  No, without question. And the, there's a way to measure it. Twitter was never

771
00:39:52,005 --> 00:39:52,445
Speaker 4:  very big.

772
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:53,005
Speaker 5:  Right.

773
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:56,605
Speaker 4:  It was always the smallest of the social companies. It was a bad business.

774
00:39:57,005 --> 00:40:00,845
Speaker 4:  I will once again issue our disclaimer. That criticism of

775
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,765
Speaker 4:  X under Elon Musk is in no way praise of Twitter under Jack Dorsey.

776
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:09,045
Speaker 4:  It was a badly run company. And again, they

777
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:11,845
Speaker 4:  sold it 'cause they didn't have any ideas on how to make it that valuable

778
00:40:11,845 --> 00:40:12,805
Speaker 5:  Clown carne goldmine.

779
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:16,605
Speaker 4:  Yep. Yep. That's the Zuckerberg quote about, about Twitter. So bad company,

780
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:20,885
Speaker 4:  but outsized influence in the media, in sports and politics.

781
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:24,165
Speaker 5:  I mean, the joke for years that was, that cable news was just host reading

782
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:27,685
Speaker 5:  to tweets to each other. Yeah. Which was not untrue for a very long time

783
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:29,245
Speaker 5:  that I don't see anywhere.

784
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:32,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's gone. So the the notion that you could solve every problem by

785
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:35,765
Speaker 4:  tweeting or create vastly more problems than tweeting

786
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:40,045
Speaker 4:  is gone. Like it's just that sort of over in a big and

787
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:41,685
Speaker 4:  important and probably healthy way.

788
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:46,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Is there even a Twitter person of the day anymore? You know that person.

789
00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:47,245
Speaker 6:  Everybody would dunk on.

790
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:50,285
Speaker 4:  It's Elon Musk. That's he, it's it's Eternal's. That's what he spent the

791
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:52,605
Speaker 5:  Money on. It's actually, that's such an interesting point there. Yeah. For

792
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:53,885
Speaker 5:  so long, you just

793
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:54,285
Speaker 6:  Knew

794
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:56,645
Speaker 5:  A random person. There was always like the main character of Twitter and

795
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:58,645
Speaker 5:  everybody would be talking about it and then you would forget about them.

796
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:01,765
Speaker 5:  Like the, the bird watching woman is always the first one that comes to mind.

797
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:03,525
Speaker 5:  Yes. It's just Elon every day. It's

798
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:07,125
Speaker 4:  Just Elon. Every day his, the reach of his tweets is dramatically increased.

799
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:07,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

800
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:09,405
Speaker 6:  Because he said, make my tweets. Sure.

801
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,485
Speaker 4:  And, and if I bought Twitter I would do the same thing.

802
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:15,365
Speaker 5:  But then recently, apparently it's gone down. Did you see this? He, he tweeted

803
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:19,285
Speaker 5:  something in a reply, which is how he tweets a lot. And his stuff

804
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:22,605
Speaker 5:  gets huge reach because he's Elon Musk and on and on. But then at one point,

805
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:26,245
Speaker 5:  I might get this slightly wrong, but I think he quote tweeted his own tweet

806
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:30,165
Speaker 5:  onto his timeline saying, bringing this to my main timeline

807
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:32,885
Speaker 5:  so that it gets more reach. Yes. I remember that. And it's like, oh, even

808
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:34,725
Speaker 5:  Elon can't get the view counts anymore.

809
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:39,405
Speaker 5:  And yeah, it just, I don't know. I, again, I, I don't think we need to like

810
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:43,005
Speaker 5:  dwell on this forever, but it's, there's just nothing about that

811
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:45,725
Speaker 5:  product that feels like it has gotten better in 12 months.

812
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:49,205
Speaker 4:  And there was like a relationship between Twitter's size

813
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:53,885
Speaker 4:  and its influence that kept it relevant. Yeah. 'cause

814
00:41:53,885 --> 00:41:57,445
Speaker 4:  it was never its size that made it relevant. Yeah. Like TikTok is very

815
00:41:57,845 --> 00:41:59,645
Speaker 4:  relevant because it is huge and

816
00:41:59,645 --> 00:41:59,925
Speaker 6:  Everybody

817
00:41:59,955 --> 00:42:03,405
Speaker 4:  Uses it and everyone uses it and, but it's still pretty insular. Like

818
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:07,645
Speaker 4:  your average TikTok trend does not break into the mainstream too

819
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:07,965
Speaker 4:  much.

820
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:11,725
Speaker 6:  Everybody's gonna be doing that slip slide soon. Just, just you wait out

821
00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:12,205
Speaker 6:  on the streets.

822
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:15,005
Speaker 4:  Oh, I've seen it with the, the Skippy dance. Yeah. It's

823
00:42:15,005 --> 00:42:17,565
Speaker 6:  A lot. Oh yeah. I tried to do it. Don't do it. You'll die. Did

824
00:42:17,565 --> 00:42:18,405
Speaker 5:  You try to do it had

825
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:19,245
Speaker 6:  In my house? Tell

826
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,165
Speaker 4:  Us more. I'm I'm at the,

827
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:20,925
Speaker 6:  That's as far as I got

828
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:24,085
Speaker 4:  Point in my, my golden years here where I look at something, I'm like, that's

829
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:25,005
Speaker 4:  that's a young man's game.

830
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:28,485
Speaker 6:  I'm in my midlife crisis phase. You're

831
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:29,205
Speaker 4:  Like, I'm skipping. I'm still like,

832
00:42:29,545 --> 00:42:29,845
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna

833
00:42:29,845 --> 00:42:32,565
Speaker 4:  Try. But no, TikTok is really fascinating and just in that way 'cause it's

834
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:36,565
Speaker 4:  the phenomena are large. Yeah. But they are contained. Yeah. And the

835
00:42:36,565 --> 00:42:40,165
Speaker 4:  whole user base does not see everything by definition. And so

836
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:43,965
Speaker 4:  TikTok itself has a lot of cultural import individual things that are happening

837
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:47,885
Speaker 4:  on TikTok are pretty siloed. Twitter was just like, all of Twitter, well

838
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:51,405
Speaker 4:  now look at this. Right. We'll talk about this. We'll be together, be engaged

839
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:55,005
Speaker 4:  with this and that for too long that thing was covid. Right. But like, it

840
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,605
Speaker 4:  was the driving force of a lot of that debate. Even it like massive

841
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:03,085
Speaker 4:  worldwide influence. And now Twitter, even if it keeps the users,

842
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:07,125
Speaker 4:  the influence is gone. Right. Yeah. And that's the danger. And so the

843
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:11,125
Speaker 4:  advertisers are leaving. We, we've seen reported the users are

844
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:15,045
Speaker 4:  fleeing and I, I think Elon's sort of like raging against it.

845
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:19,685
Speaker 6:  He's just trying to like scream his way out of it, but on online. So it's

846
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:20,645
Speaker 6:  not as aggressive. Yeah.

847
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:24,645
Speaker 4:  I mean look, he, he take, he took Twitter and he turned it into Parlor.

848
00:43:24,945 --> 00:43:27,445
Speaker 4:  He did it. He did it. Yeah. That's what it is now.

849
00:43:27,745 --> 00:43:30,845
Speaker 5:  And now I, I do wonder there's an interesting, like the, the conspiracy theory

850
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:34,405
Speaker 5:  has always been that he's trying to just bankrupt it. Like it's the equivalent

851
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:36,805
Speaker 5:  of like burning your house down for the insurance money. Seems to be Yeah.

852
00:43:36,805 --> 00:43:39,925
Speaker 5:  The, the theory, I don't think that's what he's trying to do. It does seem

853
00:43:39,925 --> 00:43:43,525
Speaker 5:  very clear that what he wants is to build the like

854
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:47,445
Speaker 5:  finance app and thought he could just bolt that onto Twitter and it

855
00:43:47,445 --> 00:43:50,445
Speaker 5:  would make sense. Yeah. He thought he could just dunno what that is. Convert

856
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:53,365
Speaker 6:  All of those users and instantly have his app.

857
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:56,445
Speaker 5:  Right. He's just like, I'll just let Twitter users pay each other and then

858
00:43:56,445 --> 00:44:00,405
Speaker 5:  that's how I'll get my finance super app. I do wonder if this all falling

859
00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:04,405
Speaker 5:  apart might just accelerate his, like, I'm gonna go make PayPal again. Plans

860
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:07,885
Speaker 5:  So. I think like X is already very different than it was 12 months ago. I

861
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:11,085
Speaker 5:  have a feeling 12 months from now it's gonna be even more

862
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:14,525
Speaker 5:  unrecognizable to what it was when he bought it. Well, because in a bunch

863
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:15,125
Speaker 5:  of weird directions

864
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:18,965
Speaker 6:  By that point, we'll all be paying a dollar just to have an account on it.

865
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:21,005
Speaker 6:  And so none of us will have an account on it. Yeah.

866
00:44:21,415 --> 00:44:22,965
Speaker 5:  Truly one of the most hilarious

867
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:26,925
Speaker 4:  Or the European government will find it out of existence. Yeah. I that it,

868
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:30,925
Speaker 4:  but the thing that is just obvious to me one year in, is

869
00:44:31,005 --> 00:44:34,925
Speaker 4:  it the cultural relevance of Twitter? That everyone is gonna talk about it,

870
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:37,845
Speaker 4:  that the news will be driven about it, that the politicians are worried about

871
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,245
Speaker 4:  it, that you name it

872
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:43,485
Speaker 5:  Gone. Yep. And I think the, the thing that most immediately accelerated

873
00:44:43,485 --> 00:44:47,005
Speaker 5:  that recently was what's going on with Israel and Hamas

874
00:44:47,345 --> 00:44:51,165
Speaker 5:  and all of the misinformation stuff that was happening, like the, the flooding

875
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:54,565
Speaker 5:  of people out of Twitter and into new platforms

876
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:57,845
Speaker 5:  really took off in a big way just in the last few weeks, which was

877
00:44:58,365 --> 00:44:59,925
Speaker 6:  Fascinating. I thought it was really interesting that everybody flooded out

878
00:44:59,925 --> 00:45:02,965
Speaker 6:  of Twitter and into new platforms. None of which actually also did a good

879
00:45:02,965 --> 00:45:03,685
Speaker 6:  job. Oh

880
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:04,565
Speaker 5:  No. Everybody, everybody's

881
00:45:04,565 --> 00:45:08,445
Speaker 6:  Like, we wanna figure out, TikTok will tell us the real news.

882
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:11,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. God. And there was like a story this week about how TikTok did not

883
00:45:11,465 --> 00:45:14,885
Speaker 6:  in fact do a very good job of it. Yeah. I think New York Times did that with

884
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:18,645
Speaker 6:  Taylor Lorenz and so like no, nobody just go read

885
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:20,365
Speaker 6:  the, the news You know

886
00:45:20,365 --> 00:45:21,605
Speaker 4:  There are whole places. The news got it pretty wrong.

887
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:23,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The news also got it pretty rough. It's,

888
00:45:23,365 --> 00:45:27,245
Speaker 4:  It's not been a great time. But like if you're starting from a that

889
00:45:27,485 --> 00:45:31,285
Speaker 4:  baseline, right. Which is the New York Times issuing major

890
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:35,125
Speaker 4:  corrections. Yeah. Well then the secondary information ecosystem

891
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:39,205
Speaker 4:  is gonna be bad too. And I, we've definitely seen that. And the thing

892
00:45:39,205 --> 00:45:42,885
Speaker 4:  is that Twitter at least in its Jack Dorsey period

893
00:45:43,705 --> 00:45:47,565
Speaker 4:  had an inkling of wanting to be like, neutral.

894
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:51,485
Speaker 4:  Neutral is the wrong word, but it, it just wanted to be like,

895
00:45:51,695 --> 00:45:55,605
Speaker 6:  There felt like there was a level of like peer review happening on Twitter

896
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:59,445
Speaker 6:  before where like generally the accurate stuff would, would crawl

897
00:45:59,445 --> 00:46:03,285
Speaker 6:  to the top eventually, or, or the context would arrive and you'd be like,

898
00:46:03,285 --> 00:46:06,765
Speaker 6:  okay, I, I understand what I'm reading here. And that doesn't happen anymore.

899
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,645
Speaker 6:  Where somebody will just be like, yeah, this is crazy, isn't it?

900
00:46:08,845 --> 00:46:11,405
Speaker 4:  I would, I would say it's, it's like the opposite of that, but the word,

901
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,285
Speaker 4:  it's almost like neutral, but it's not neutral. 'cause Twitter was never

902
00:46:14,285 --> 00:46:17,485
Speaker 4:  neutral, but it was, it was never, it was, it was level and there was things

903
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:21,365
Speaker 4:  that were out of bounds. Yes. And the new version X is like,

904
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:24,765
Speaker 4:  what if we just amplify the things that are out of bounds? So I, I, and that

905
00:46:24,765 --> 00:46:26,885
Speaker 4:  is a distinct shift in the character of the platform.

906
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:29,565
Speaker 5:  I actually think it's even simpler than that. Yeah. And I think one of the

907
00:46:29,565 --> 00:46:33,525
Speaker 5:  things that is working for Threads right now is that

908
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:37,325
Speaker 5:  the people in charge of it are believably trying their best. And I think

909
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:40,245
Speaker 5:  that was a thing that people believed Twitter for a long time was it was

910
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:43,165
Speaker 5:  a lot of people trying to do a very hard thing, but generally trying their

911
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:46,525
Speaker 5:  hardest to do it. Right. Yes. And reasonable people can disagree about. Right.

912
00:46:46,825 --> 00:46:49,885
Speaker 5:  But I think the, the reason Mark Zuckerberg became a bad guy for a long time

913
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:53,725
Speaker 5:  was that a lot of people believed he was not trying to do

914
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:57,885
Speaker 5:  good things. And in a truly masterful PR

915
00:46:58,245 --> 00:47:01,445
Speaker 5:  campaign, mark Zuckerberg has won many of those people back. But I

916
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:05,125
Speaker 4:  Think, wait, the Masteral PR campaign, by the way, is making Adams compete

917
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,165
Speaker 5:  With Elon Musk. No,

918
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:08,765
Speaker 4:  It's, it's, it's make Adam ery the face of this product. Oh,

919
00:47:09,005 --> 00:47:12,405
Speaker 5:  Absolutely. And I think, I think Adam er and the, the team running Threads

920
00:47:12,405 --> 00:47:15,685
Speaker 5:  has done a really good job of being out there and being present and

921
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:19,805
Speaker 5:  appearing at least to be trying hard to do the right thing. And it's

922
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:23,645
Speaker 5:  very clear now that the leadership at X is not Yeah. Interested in

923
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:26,925
Speaker 5:  what the right thing is. And so it just changes the feeling that you get

924
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:30,445
Speaker 5:  from being here. Like I am no longer in good hands. And that feels bad.

925
00:47:30,635 --> 00:47:30,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

926
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,485
Speaker 4:  Which is weird. 'cause these products at scale, all of them have the same

927
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:38,285
Speaker 4:  incentives. Yeah. Which is to increase engagement and be sticky. Right.

928
00:47:38,385 --> 00:47:42,245
Speaker 4:  But you see Adam constantly try to thread the needle

929
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:46,205
Speaker 4:  on is there news here or not? And his answer is like, ah, I really don't

930
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:49,085
Speaker 4:  want there to be, and people are gonna do it anyway, but we are gonna show

931
00:47:49,085 --> 00:47:52,605
Speaker 4:  you other happy stuff. Right. Zuckerberg this week on their earnings call

932
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:56,365
Speaker 4:  said there should be a text-based social network of a billion people that

933
00:47:56,365 --> 00:47:59,965
Speaker 4:  is more positive. And so you see them, they're actively trying to

934
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:03,525
Speaker 4:  make it. So you can't talk about Israel and Hamas. You definitely cannot

935
00:48:03,525 --> 00:48:07,325
Speaker 4:  talk about Covid. Which again, I think is a defining moment in the,

936
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:11,325
Speaker 4:  the Twitter. Yep. This is the thing that broke Twitter the most. We'll see

937
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:15,005
Speaker 4:  if the other platforms survive, but I that thing where all of

938
00:48:15,465 --> 00:48:19,325
Speaker 4:  the influential people are using one platform and it's crazy and you can

939
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:23,045
Speaker 4:  just yell at them directly, which is was a delight. Yeah. Is gone. Yep. I

940
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:24,685
Speaker 4:  do not think it is ever coming back. And

941
00:48:24,725 --> 00:48:25,485
Speaker 6:  I think that's okay.

942
00:48:25,765 --> 00:48:28,045
Speaker 4:  I think that is e easily for the best. Yes,

943
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,485
Speaker 5:  I agree. So, which is a good segue Yeah. To our next bit, which is all of

944
00:48:31,485 --> 00:48:34,805
Speaker 5:  the would be successors. Mila, will you explain the Go 90 Scale

945
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,005
Speaker 4:  All? right. So Verizon started as a video streaming service called Go 90.

946
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:41,565
Speaker 4:  They were early to the idea of starting a doom streaming service credit to

947
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:45,525
Speaker 4:  Verizon. We profiled it, you can read that

948
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:49,365
Speaker 4:  story. But eventually, like all streaming services, it died. It went

949
00:48:49,365 --> 00:48:53,125
Speaker 4:  90. So the scale is the go 90 scale of Doom streaming services, which

950
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:57,005
Speaker 4:  we're repurposing here for Twitter clones. But the Go 90 scale

951
00:48:57,005 --> 00:49:00,965
Speaker 4:  of Doom streaming services is Zero is alive, zero is

952
00:49:00,965 --> 00:49:04,645
Speaker 4:  alive. And then you can go 90. You can go 90. Yeah. And you can die. Right?

953
00:49:04,795 --> 00:49:05,885
Speaker 4:  Like go 90. You

954
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:06,605
Speaker 5:  Fall over and die.

955
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:10,805
Speaker 4:  I encourage you to read this story about Go 90. Ben Papa wrote it. It's a

956
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:14,445
Speaker 4:  lot of, it's a lot of telecom executives thinking they understand

957
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,005
Speaker 4:  teenagers.

958
00:49:15,525 --> 00:49:16,005
Speaker 6:  I understand that

959
00:49:16,185 --> 00:49:18,485
Speaker 4:  You could join a video crew on Go 90. Yeah. My friends,

960
00:49:19,325 --> 00:49:23,165
Speaker 5:  I just feel like somebody, the minute someone came out of a meeting and was

961
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:26,645
Speaker 5:  like, we've decided to call it Go 90, whoever that person's boss was should

962
00:49:26,645 --> 00:49:28,605
Speaker 5:  have been like, nevermind. We're not doing strike of service. Yeah. Like,

963
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:32,525
Speaker 5:  we're out. But, okay. So that's the scale. Let's just start

964
00:49:32,525 --> 00:49:36,485
Speaker 5:  with X. It's a good balancing point to start with. Where do we

965
00:49:36,485 --> 00:49:39,965
Speaker 5:  think, again, remember this is between Fully Alive,

966
00:49:40,405 --> 00:49:44,205
Speaker 5:  crushing it totally vibrant and like full dead. Yeah. Like

967
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:47,405
Speaker 5:  end of platform gonna be gone. Where do we feel like X is?

968
00:49:47,715 --> 00:49:51,645
Speaker 6:  Okay, I said it earlier, but I think it's gonna be at 80. Like that's

969
00:49:51,645 --> 00:49:55,325
Speaker 6:  where it should be. But I think it has such a high like kind of jackass

970
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,965
Speaker 6:  quotient on the platform right now that it's more like a 50 to

971
00:49:58,965 --> 00:49:59,925
Speaker 6:  45 at the moment.

972
00:50:00,395 --> 00:50:04,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I would say 45. It's at a 45. Yeah. Right. Dab in the middle. Yeah.

973
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:08,485
Speaker 6:  For a lot of people it's an 80. It's, it's like most people, it's an 80 almost,

974
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:10,445
Speaker 6:  but there's just enough that it's like a, it's

975
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:13,445
Speaker 5:  Four, five. Yeah. My instinct would be to put it a little higher except a,

976
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:17,165
Speaker 5:  like you're saying, never underestimate the number of people who are the

977
00:50:17,165 --> 00:50:21,005
Speaker 5:  worst. And B, these things just take longer than we give them credit for.

978
00:50:21,405 --> 00:50:24,365
Speaker 5:  Right. Like, I spent a lot of time thinking about the people who still pay

979
00:50:24,365 --> 00:50:28,285
Speaker 5:  for AOL that they got on discs. It's like that stuff doesn't die as

980
00:50:28,285 --> 00:50:31,165
Speaker 5:  quickly as we think it does. We stop talking about it and most people move

981
00:50:31,165 --> 00:50:34,845
Speaker 5:  on. But like most things die slow. Yeah. And I think

982
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:38,685
Speaker 5:  Twitter has begun what is probably like the inexorable slow

983
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:42,525
Speaker 5:  death, but it has not died. So I, I think that's right. 45. Somewhere

984
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:46,045
Speaker 5:  in the 45 range feels about right. Yeah. Where do we put Threads? Which,

985
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:49,125
Speaker 5:  so the Threads news this week was also on the earnings call. Like you were

986
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:52,925
Speaker 5:  saying, Neli, they announced that Threads has almost a hundred million monthly

987
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:56,645
Speaker 5:  active users. What does almost mean in this context? Who knows? But it's

988
00:50:56,645 --> 00:51:00,245
Speaker 5:  a big number. The number has been growing. All the people whatever, two months

989
00:51:00,245 --> 00:51:04,045
Speaker 5:  ago who were like, Threads is struggling to keep users, have less to say

990
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:06,685
Speaker 5:  Now Thread seems to be doing fine. Where do we put it on the list?

991
00:51:07,175 --> 00:51:07,765
Speaker 4:  45.

992
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:08,485
Speaker 5:  Really?

993
00:51:08,955 --> 00:51:09,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

994
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:09,925
Speaker 5:  Why?

995
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:13,605
Speaker 4:  I put just like a different color of 45. Okay.

996
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:13,965
Speaker 5:  Like

997
00:51:14,225 --> 00:51:14,525
Speaker 4:  You know.

998
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:15,725
Speaker 6:  Happy 45. Yeah.

999
00:51:15,835 --> 00:51:19,605
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's a happy 45. Like happy 45. Most products

1000
00:51:19,915 --> 00:51:23,885
Speaker 4:  fail. I don't, there's, that's just the nature of them. Most

1001
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:27,005
Speaker 4:  new products just fizzle out. Meta has launched a lot of products.

1002
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:30,765
Speaker 5:  I was just about to say. Yeah. So the, the case for and against Threads

1003
00:51:31,265 --> 00:51:35,205
Speaker 5:  is that it's Meta. Yeah. My immediate instinct for Threads is to put it at

1004
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:39,045
Speaker 5:  like 25 because a Zuckerberg is out here now saying

1005
00:51:39,225 --> 00:51:42,485
Speaker 5:  we see a path to a billion users, which is what he's been saying all along.

1006
00:51:42,805 --> 00:51:46,205
Speaker 5:  I think he's enjoying this competition. I think he likes how much Threads

1007
00:51:46,205 --> 00:51:48,645
Speaker 5:  has made him the good guy. And I think that's gonna buy Threads a pretty

1008
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:52,165
Speaker 5:  long runway. Threads also I think seems to be working like we're gonna get

1009
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:54,685
Speaker 5:  to a bunch of other ones, but Threads is, Threads

1010
00:51:54,685 --> 00:51:55,085
Speaker 4:  Has the heat.

1011
00:51:55,225 --> 00:51:58,685
Speaker 5:  It has the heat. That's exactly right. And I think that can be

1012
00:51:59,025 --> 00:52:02,925
Speaker 5:  fickle, but it very much has the heat right now. Yeah. So, I.

1013
00:52:03,045 --> 00:52:06,925
Speaker 5:  I would put it lower than 20 or lower than 45. I'm in the like mid twenties

1014
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:07,245
Speaker 5:  fridge

1015
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:09,725
Speaker 6:  That Yeah, that's, that's where I'm in. I'm in the twenties. Okay. It feels

1016
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,165
Speaker 6:  very, very likely that it's gonna last a little while,

1017
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:15,765
Speaker 4:  But that's not Okay. Fine. Yeah. I like, like, like, okay. Is it gonna last

1018
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:17,925
Speaker 4:  a little while? It's kind of a different question, but I

1019
00:52:17,985 --> 00:52:21,645
Speaker 6:  It feels like it's, it's got some legs to it. Yeah. It feels like of

1020
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:24,325
Speaker 6:  a lot of these we were gonna talk about, I think this is the one.

1021
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:27,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All the rest of 'em are dead. Yeah. And some of them are like literally

1022
00:52:27,165 --> 00:52:27,725
Speaker 4:  dead this week.

1023
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:32,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like, like this is the one I'm ranking closest to zero. It feels like

1024
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:35,085
Speaker 6:  it's gonna have the one that lasts the longest.

1025
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:39,045
Speaker 4:  I, I think the danger here is when you do that, you call it the winner. And

1026
00:52:39,045 --> 00:52:39,885
Speaker 4:  I don't think it's actually

1027
00:52:39,885 --> 00:52:41,485
Speaker 6:  The winner. I don't think it's the winner. That's true.

1028
00:52:41,485 --> 00:52:44,805
Speaker 4:  That's, and that's why I'm at 45. It has the potential, it's like a happy

1029
00:52:44,805 --> 00:52:48,525
Speaker 4:  45. Yeah. But it very much has the potential to be the winner. Some, but

1030
00:52:48,525 --> 00:52:51,205
Speaker 4:  some of the decisions they've made and some of the, the postures they have

1031
00:52:51,205 --> 00:52:55,045
Speaker 4:  struck are actually dangerous for them. Yeah. Right. So

1032
00:52:55,315 --> 00:52:59,205
Speaker 4:  it's not real time. Like there's a bunch of people lately doing tests to

1033
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:02,525
Speaker 4:  see how like real time Threads is. Right. Even in the

1034
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:06,365
Speaker 4:  following feed, it's like algorithmic where it's keeping you

1035
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:09,405
Speaker 4:  from real time posts from people you follow. I

1036
00:53:09,405 --> 00:53:11,445
Speaker 6:  Mean, but the EU is gonna fix that for us

1037
00:53:12,895 --> 00:53:13,245
Speaker 4:  Short,

1038
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:17,845
Speaker 5:  The danger for Threads would be at least culturally, is essentially that

1039
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:20,605
Speaker 5:  it turns into Facebook. Right. Right. Yeah. Which is like, there's a version

1040
00:53:20,605 --> 00:53:24,325
Speaker 5:  of Threads that is hugely successful and totally culturally irrelevant. Yep.

1041
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:27,885
Speaker 5:  And that's what Facebook is. But Facebook is zero people's Facebook, it's

1042
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:31,765
Speaker 5:  a really good business. Sure. But it's not like, it's not

1043
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:35,325
Speaker 5:  ever going to get to what Twitter was. Right. Like that thing where people

1044
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,525
Speaker 5:  on cable news are reading tweets at each other, which

1045
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:40,245
Speaker 4:  By the way might have been bad for democracy. Oh sure.

1046
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:43,685
Speaker 5:  Society. I think a perfectly reasonable case to make is that every tech choice

1047
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:46,565
Speaker 5:  we've made in the last 15 years was wrong. And we should just go back to

1048
00:53:46,565 --> 00:53:47,125
Speaker 5:  2006

1049
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:50,805
Speaker 4:  And do it again. But specifically, CNN is a bad podcast of people reading

1050
00:53:50,805 --> 00:53:53,725
Speaker 4:  tweets to each other was a bad moment. Yes.

1051
00:53:53,725 --> 00:53:55,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. In world history. A hundred percent agree.

1052
00:53:55,545 --> 00:53:58,885
Speaker 4:  And I think this is what Zuck and Messer are talking about when they're like,

1053
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:01,525
Speaker 4:  this shouldn't be, we don't want to do news. They have a million reasons

1054
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:04,725
Speaker 4:  to not do news or governments around the world or making them pay for news.

1055
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:08,245
Speaker 4:  They're blocking it and they're like, there's a lot of complication there.

1056
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:12,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But I think if you look at the most negative impact of Twitter, it

1057
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:15,965
Speaker 4:  was the news became Twitter and Twitter lacked

1058
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:18,045
Speaker 4:  all nuance and was just a dog fight.

1059
00:54:18,585 --> 00:54:18,805
Speaker 5:  Yes.

1060
00:54:19,225 --> 00:54:22,765
Speaker 4:  All the time. And I don't think they want Thrones to be that. So I'm saying

1061
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:25,165
Speaker 4:  it's just like a ha It's is almost certainly gonna be the winner.

1062
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:27,885
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah. All. right. Well, we'll split the difference. We'll put it at

1063
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:28,045
Speaker 5:  like

1064
00:54:28,385 --> 00:54:29,045
Speaker 4:  35.

1065
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:31,085
Speaker 5:  35. There we go. Mastodon,

1066
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:35,165
Speaker 4:  Maston's A zero. It's, it's alive necessarily by default. Alive.

1067
00:54:35,425 --> 00:54:38,125
Speaker 4:  It depends on what you're talking about with Mastodon. Yeah.

1068
00:54:38,215 --> 00:54:38,565
Speaker 6:  Let's,

1069
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:42,365
Speaker 4:  Because it is definitionally uncurable, if you talk about the decentralized

1070
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:44,005
Speaker 4:  network of things, that is Mastodon. No,

1071
00:54:44,005 --> 00:54:45,205
Speaker 5:  We're not talking about Activity Pub.

1072
00:54:45,745 --> 00:54:47,805
Speaker 4:  I'm not talking about Activity Pub. I'm talking about Mastodon, the social

1073
00:54:47,805 --> 00:54:51,205
Speaker 4:  network Sure. Of many, many, many Mastodon servers. The

1074
00:54:51,295 --> 00:54:52,885
Speaker 6:  Speed that David got there,

1075
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:57,005
Speaker 4:  She know everyone knows what I'm talk about, but I'm No, I mean, I mean specifically

1076
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,565
Speaker 4:  Mastodon, the social network made up of decentralized servers that people

1077
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:02,205
Speaker 4:  can run and federate however they want. Yeah.

1078
00:55:02,445 --> 00:55:02,885
Speaker 5:  I feel like that's less

1079
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:04,165
Speaker 4:  Definitionally un killable.

1080
00:55:04,475 --> 00:55:08,045
Speaker 5:  Sure. But I also feel like that's less and less what Mastodon is. Mastodon

1081
00:55:08,045 --> 00:55:11,765
Speaker 5:  has leaned into Mastodon social being the thing, like

1082
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,965
Speaker 5:  they made this very intentional choice in the name of getting more people

1083
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:18,885
Speaker 5:  onto the platform and making discovery easier to default people to

1084
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:22,005
Speaker 5:  what amounts to a centralized platform. You don't have to stay there. You

1085
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:25,845
Speaker 5:  can leave if you want. You can federate, but like Mastodon and Mastodon

1086
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:29,405
Speaker 5:  social, which is one instance of Mastodon, are increasingly the same thing.

1087
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:34,045
Speaker 5:  And I, I don't know what that means. I think they're, they're continue to

1088
00:55:34,045 --> 00:55:37,445
Speaker 5:  be open questions about what happens when Mastodon gets a hundred million

1089
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:41,165
Speaker 5:  users. If literally the people running it can afford to do that. I think

1090
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:43,685
Speaker 5:  you're probably right that it's pretty close to zero at the moment. But I

1091
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:46,525
Speaker 5:  also think, I think the idea that it is un killable, I don't think is true.

1092
00:55:46,595 --> 00:55:46,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1093
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,125
Speaker 6:  I think the concept of Mastodon is a zero. I think execution is

1094
00:55:50,675 --> 00:55:54,645
Speaker 6:  like in the forties or fifties because because we're

1095
00:55:54,645 --> 00:55:58,485
Speaker 6:  we're so early in this conversation about decentralization and stuff. We're

1096
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:01,725
Speaker 6:  so, or in the movement or whatever you wanna call it. We're so early on in

1097
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,845
Speaker 6:  it that I don't know if Mastodon is necessarily gonna be the most successful

1098
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:08,525
Speaker 6:  one. I don't know if like it's theories for, for how to do de

1099
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:12,645
Speaker 6:  decentralization is gonna work. Yeah. Especially when you have threats just

1100
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:14,925
Speaker 6:  out there. I'm trying not to talk about it. I I got too close to activity.

1101
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:16,285
Speaker 6:  Close So, I flying So I close

1102
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:17,205
Speaker 4:  The activity Pub

1103
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:19,685
Speaker 6:  Sun. I'm so sorry. But Mastodon, I'm not

1104
00:56:19,685 --> 00:56:19,845
Speaker 4:  Sorry.

1105
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:20,685
Speaker 6:  David

1106
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:21,965
Speaker 4:  Is keeping us in the truth.

1107
00:56:22,075 --> 00:56:25,765
Speaker 5:  That was specifically notorious activity. Pub hater. David Pierce. That's

1108
00:56:25,765 --> 00:56:25,925
Speaker 5:  me.

1109
00:56:26,305 --> 00:56:30,165
Speaker 6:  But yeah, I think, I think mast on social and, and that concept and stuff

1110
00:56:30,185 --> 00:56:33,845
Speaker 6:  is, is much higher on the scale because we're, we're already seeing this.

1111
00:56:33,845 --> 00:56:37,005
Speaker 6:  This is something that Dan talks about a lot. He, he's our, our big mast

1112
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:40,405
Speaker 6:  on user in the office. And, and he's seen it a ton where everybody's like,

1113
00:56:40,405 --> 00:56:43,165
Speaker 6:  well, I don't wanna be on my little servers that I'm on. It's actually more

1114
00:56:43,165 --> 00:56:46,845
Speaker 6:  complicated and I wanna be on the main mast on server. And that's death for

1115
00:56:46,845 --> 00:56:50,645
Speaker 6:  that whole platform whenever I wanna be on the main one is everybody's

1116
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:53,925
Speaker 6:  desire. Then, then the whole, the whole conceit falls apart.

1117
00:56:53,925 --> 00:56:55,525
Speaker 4:  Then you've recentralized the service. Yeah.

1118
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:58,725
Speaker 6:  Like then what have you done? You've done, you've made a crummier Threads.

1119
00:56:59,035 --> 00:57:02,085
Speaker 5:  Well, yeah. Right. And then you become something that Threads can eat. Yeah.

1120
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:03,005
Speaker 5:  And

1121
00:57:03,345 --> 00:57:06,205
Speaker 6:  So I'm, I'm, I'm like at a, I'm like at a 45, 50.

1122
00:57:06,485 --> 00:57:08,845
Speaker 4:  I think this really depends on whether you think Massillon is mass on social

1123
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:12,565
Speaker 4:  or not. Because I, the Yes, there's one platform.

1124
00:57:12,765 --> 00:57:16,445
Speaker 4:  I think they're opportunistically trying to grow users on that one. But

1125
00:57:16,585 --> 00:57:19,885
Speaker 4:  You know they're a very idealistic bunch over at Mastodon.

1126
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:20,285
Speaker 5:  Yes.

1127
00:57:20,525 --> 00:57:22,805
Speaker 6:  I, I'm rooting for them, but I'm like, whoa. Like

1128
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:27,205
Speaker 4:  Yuin was on decoder and he was basically like, I don't know how to

1129
00:57:27,205 --> 00:57:29,325
Speaker 4:  make money and I don't want to. Right. Like that's

1130
00:57:29,385 --> 00:57:30,405
Speaker 5:  Not, and actually believe what, that's not,

1131
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,525
Speaker 4:  He's not his posture. Yeah. Yeah. And I think he just wants to grow the service

1132
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:37,085
Speaker 4:  'cause there's an opportunity to grow the service. But I think fundamentally

1133
00:57:37,285 --> 00:57:41,005
Speaker 4:  they're into the decentralized approach to the network, which thread

1134
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:44,845
Speaker 4:  could federate into and could either crush or flood with

1135
00:57:44,845 --> 00:57:45,645
Speaker 4:  users or who knows.

1136
00:57:45,805 --> 00:57:48,245
Speaker 6:  I will say this, when we're, when we're talking about all of these and talking

1137
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:52,045
Speaker 6:  about the scale and survivability, we think a lot in that concept of growth.

1138
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:55,885
Speaker 6:  But that growth itself, like the growth at all costs is a very like Threads

1139
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:59,125
Speaker 6:  financially incentivized thing. And a lot of these, particularly something

1140
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:02,605
Speaker 6:  like Mastodon, that's not their interest. It is about that decentralization

1141
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:05,805
Speaker 6:  and stuff. So I think for a lot of those users, they'll probably be there

1142
00:58:06,075 --> 00:58:07,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. For ages.

1143
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well, and I think part of the reason I wanted to do this on the go

1144
00:58:09,685 --> 00:58:13,485
Speaker 5:  90 scale is like streaming services. This won't be a winner.

1145
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:17,285
Speaker 5:  Takes all. Yeah. Right. Like there, there can be lots of these that exist

1146
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:17,765
Speaker 5:  ideally.

1147
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:19,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's the ideal state, right?

1148
00:58:19,285 --> 00:58:21,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's, yeah. Again, activity pub

1149
00:58:22,185 --> 00:58:23,445
Speaker 6:  All. right. Although some of these on here,

1150
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:27,285
Speaker 5:  Next one up on the list Blue sky. Yeah. We're going in order from like

1151
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:31,645
Speaker 5:  possible to less possible Blue sky. It's about to get real ugly, but let's,

1152
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:32,685
Speaker 5:  let's, it's

1153
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:33,445
Speaker 4:  A hard drop.

1154
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:33,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1155
00:58:34,115 --> 00:58:37,965
Speaker 6:  Blue Blue Sky's a 70 for me. Yeah. And it's, it's, it's a vindictive

1156
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:41,685
Speaker 6:  70. Mainly because I'm on blue sky, I never use it.

1157
00:58:41,905 --> 00:58:45,765
Speaker 6:  And a bunch of my friends in like academia use it a lot. And they're always

1158
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:48,365
Speaker 6:  like, why aren't you ever on blue sky? Mm. So I want it to go away. So they

1159
00:58:48,365 --> 00:58:49,245
Speaker 6:  stop asking. Blue

1160
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:52,605
Speaker 5:  Sky is definitively wear the weirdos went. Yeah. It's

1161
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:52,685
Speaker 6:  Where

1162
00:58:52,685 --> 00:58:55,285
Speaker 5:  The weirdos connected. And whether that's a, whether that's an insult or

1163
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:58,645
Speaker 5:  a compliment thinking of is irrelevant. All the weirdos went to Blue Sky.

1164
00:58:58,645 --> 00:58:58,925
Speaker 5:  Just

1165
00:58:58,925 --> 00:59:01,725
Speaker 6:  Thinking of our coworkers who are active Blue Sky users. I'm like, yeah,

1166
00:59:01,795 --> 00:59:04,525
Speaker 5:  It's the weirdos. Yeah. And that's like, that's where the shit posters went.

1167
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:07,925
Speaker 5:  Like if you mostly just went to like,

1168
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:12,045
Speaker 5:  cause low stakes trouble for other people. Blue sky. Yeah. That's,

1169
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:15,045
Speaker 6:  And you have 40,000 followers there right now. Nice.

1170
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:15,805
Speaker 5:  Look at

1171
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:17,285
Speaker 6:  You. No, I don't. I have four.

1172
00:59:17,465 --> 00:59:19,205
Speaker 5:  Oh, nice. That's less than, and

1173
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:22,485
Speaker 6:  It's all my friends saying, why aren't you chatting here? Why I using Blue

1174
00:59:22,485 --> 00:59:23,605
Speaker 6:  Sky? I was like, because look at Threads

1175
00:59:23,915 --> 00:59:27,125
Speaker 4:  Blue Sky. I I agree. It's 75. A little, little higher than Alex.

1176
00:59:27,505 --> 00:59:31,325
Speaker 6:  And it's not even, and it's also not even active in that thing we're not

1177
00:59:31,325 --> 00:59:33,245
Speaker 6:  talking about today. That's totally not related. Well, no,

1178
00:59:33,245 --> 00:59:35,005
Speaker 4:  They have their own decentralized idea that

1179
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:38,885
Speaker 6:  Makes it like that. That gives it like a plus five. You see closer death

1180
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:40,245
Speaker 6:  modifier. Yeah. Yeah.

1181
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:44,245
Speaker 4:  I blues if the, the tension from Masson is between Ma on

1182
00:59:44,245 --> 00:59:48,005
Speaker 4:  the decentralized social network idea and ma on social decentralized

1183
00:59:48,065 --> 00:59:51,965
Speaker 4:  server that you can log onto. Blue Sky is at the far end of the tension where

1184
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:54,525
Speaker 4:  they're like, we made a decentralized social network. It has one server.

1185
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:58,885
Speaker 4:  We won't even tell anyone else how to set up their own server. The protocol

1186
00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:01,765
Speaker 4:  isn't finished and we're standing up trust and safety on this server. Also,

1187
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,165
Speaker 4:  Jack Dorsey is an investor in our company. Like

1188
01:00:04,745 --> 01:00:08,445
Speaker 6:  You just kept, like, you just are trying to shoot it to 90,

1189
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:10,565
Speaker 6:  which is modifier after modify.

1190
01:00:10,665 --> 01:00:14,365
Speaker 4:  I'm, it, it's there. Yeah. But all of these companies are gonna run into

1191
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:17,245
Speaker 4:  a revenue problem. I think Threads will solve it very quickly.

1192
01:00:18,095 --> 01:00:22,045
Speaker 4:  Again, Maston I think is just ideologically un killable, blue

1193
01:00:22,105 --> 01:00:25,765
Speaker 4:  sky. How are they gonna make a dollar? What's the plan? Are

1194
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:26,165
Speaker 4:  they're

1195
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:26,245
Speaker 6:  Gonna

1196
01:00:26,245 --> 01:00:30,045
Speaker 4:  Start. This is a group of people that advertisers do not want to be

1197
01:00:30,045 --> 01:00:30,285
Speaker 4:  near.

1198
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:31,485
Speaker 6:  They're gonna open a Patreon.

1199
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:35,445
Speaker 4:  Right. It's gonna, it's gonna be some weird mix of subscription and,

1200
01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:39,445
Speaker 4:  and contributions. And the, and the goal of it is not

1201
01:00:39,445 --> 01:00:43,365
Speaker 4:  to run the centralized server, at least from their white paper, from

1202
01:00:43,365 --> 01:00:47,285
Speaker 4:  like, they're just very far away from where they started. Yes. Yeah.

1203
01:00:47,285 --> 01:00:49,605
Speaker 4:  They're running a clubhouse. That's fine. They're

1204
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,085
Speaker 6:  Running Clubhouse and we that Yeah.

1205
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:52,845
Speaker 4:  Clubhouse is also dead. I would point out, I

1206
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:54,525
Speaker 6:  Was like, that's on the nine, that's 90 on the scale.

1207
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,965
Speaker 4:  And I they just have to make some decisions along the way there. Yeah.

1208
01:00:58,235 --> 01:01:01,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think that's right. I I would put it about that high too. They did

1209
01:01:01,445 --> 01:01:04,405
Speaker 5:  a couple of things really. Right. Like the way they thought about usernames

1210
01:01:04,405 --> 01:01:08,125
Speaker 5:  was very smart. Yeah. They had some, some nifty ideas about custom

1211
01:01:08,155 --> 01:01:11,045
Speaker 5:  timelines that I continue to think is very cool. But I think they're gonna

1212
01:01:11,065 --> 01:01:14,885
Speaker 5:  end up having the legacy of being like, like friend

1213
01:01:14,885 --> 01:01:18,165
Speaker 5:  feed. Right. Where they're like, we had a bunch of ideas before the products

1214
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:22,165
Speaker 5:  took off and they're gonna be like, we did that first. Right? Like, everybody's

1215
01:01:22,165 --> 01:01:25,525
Speaker 5:  like, oh, they invented the newsfeed. And there's like some developer out

1216
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:27,805
Speaker 5:  there who's like, actually it was me first. Everybody's like, I don't care.

1217
01:01:27,925 --> 01:01:30,125
Speaker 5:  'cause Facebook destroyed you. That's gonna be the legacy of,

1218
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:33,925
Speaker 4:  There's already some like connector software that connects Blue Sky's

1219
01:01:34,115 --> 01:01:38,045
Speaker 4:  decentralized approach to the activity pub decentralized approach. And

1220
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:42,085
Speaker 4:  you can see how that thing Ugh. It's gonna be like, it's just designed

1221
01:01:42,085 --> 01:01:43,965
Speaker 4:  to piss everyone off. You know like

1222
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:47,565
Speaker 6:  The, the app when you need to move music services Yeah. And you're always

1223
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:48,645
Speaker 6:  think it'll work and it never does.

1224
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:52,685
Speaker 4:  Well we'll just see how this goes. But my, my feeling is that it's successful

1225
01:01:52,685 --> 01:01:56,445
Speaker 4:  now because it has a bunch of investor money in it. Yeah.

1226
01:01:56,825 --> 01:01:58,965
Speaker 4:  And the the turn is coming. Yep.

1227
01:01:59,345 --> 01:02:03,005
Speaker 5:  All. right. Bunch more. These are all gonna be fairly quick. I'm gonna change

1228
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:06,085
Speaker 5:  the order up here. CK Notes is the next one I wanna talk about, which is

1229
01:02:06,485 --> 01:02:06,965
Speaker 5:  slightly different.

1230
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:11,005
Speaker 4:  Oh, CK is a company right now. Is it easily at 65 or 70?

1231
01:02:11,385 --> 01:02:12,805
Speaker 6:  So notes is even higher, right.

1232
01:02:12,935 --> 01:02:15,565
Speaker 4:  Notes Notes are just like a long for the ride. Yeah.

1233
01:02:15,955 --> 01:02:17,685
Speaker 6:  It's a 70, 75 for me.

1234
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,365
Speaker 4:  What notes or sub ck

1235
01:02:19,785 --> 01:02:20,125
Speaker 6:  All of

1236
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:22,085
Speaker 5:  It make the briefcase against ck

1237
01:02:23,385 --> 01:02:27,125
Speaker 4:  Cks entire business is taking a cut of other

1238
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:31,045
Speaker 4:  people's businesses. The number of people who have started successful

1239
01:02:31,425 --> 01:02:35,405
Speaker 4:  cks is not large. Like it's large in the context of the

1240
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:39,445
Speaker 4:  internet or like, maybe like the media. Casey has a really successful CK

1241
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:43,125
Speaker 4:  more power to Casey. They're taking 10% of his revenue.

1242
01:02:43,435 --> 01:02:47,285
Speaker 4:  This is a business that is founded on whales. So you just need, and

1243
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:49,285
Speaker 5:  It does not seem to be creating new ones. Yeah. Right. Very quickly

1244
01:02:49,285 --> 01:02:53,045
Speaker 4:  Anymore. And then the ones that it has created, some of them are like,

1245
01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:56,925
Speaker 4:  again, large amounts of money, large amounts of subscribers,

1246
01:02:57,725 --> 01:03:01,285
Speaker 4:  cultural relevance, shaky. The Barry Weiss of the world.

1247
01:03:01,475 --> 01:03:05,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Andrew Sullivan's of the world. I I I came up as an Andrew Sullivan

1248
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:09,205
Speaker 4:  reader in the nineties. Yep. Fine. Right. But they've got a handful

1249
01:03:09,225 --> 01:03:11,805
Speaker 4:  of those that are making a bunch of money. They're taking a huge amount.

1250
01:03:12,065 --> 01:03:15,885
Speaker 4:  You take 10% out of Andrew Sullivan. Yeah. Or

1251
01:03:15,955 --> 01:03:19,645
Speaker 4:  Heather Cox Richardson or Barry Weiss. The, the top of the

1252
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:23,205
Speaker 4:  charts at ck. You're taking an awful lot of money from those people to send

1253
01:03:23,205 --> 01:03:27,005
Speaker 4:  emails to just what you're doing. That's the service you are providing.

1254
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:31,045
Speaker 4:  They are not bringing new customers onto the platform. Most new

1255
01:03:31,405 --> 01:03:34,165
Speaker 4:  subscribers on cks are subscribers to other cks.

1256
01:03:34,165 --> 01:03:35,805
Speaker 5:  Yep. The recommendations thing seems to

1257
01:03:35,805 --> 01:03:38,965
Speaker 4:  Have worked. So they, they, they're just moving, they're taking more money

1258
01:03:38,985 --> 01:03:41,645
Speaker 4:  out of the existing CK base and not bringing new people on CK

1259
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:43,085
Speaker 6:  Nevermind, I'm at 80 now.

1260
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:47,525
Speaker 4:  And then in April they are hitting up retail

1261
01:03:47,525 --> 01:03:50,885
Speaker 4:  investors for cash in like a

1262
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:55,765
Speaker 4:  pre-public round of investment. They won't really sell the numbers,

1263
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:59,525
Speaker 4:  but we know CK had negative revenue last year. It's just

1264
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:02,965
Speaker 4:  like CK is in a place where the next thing they have to do

1265
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:06,965
Speaker 4:  is introduce advertising their platform because they need a big new source

1266
01:04:06,965 --> 01:04:10,805
Speaker 4:  of revenue to make that go because they can't convince new millions

1267
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,805
Speaker 4:  upon millions of more new people to pay them. And I know people are gonna

1268
01:04:13,805 --> 01:04:17,605
Speaker 4:  say that. I'm like biased against CK 'cause I had Chris best on decoder and

1269
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:21,485
Speaker 4:  I yelled at him about not moderating CK No, I'm whatever you think of

1270
01:04:21,485 --> 01:04:24,925
Speaker 4:  that. I'm looking at the math of their business. Yeah. And I'm saying

1271
01:04:25,075 --> 01:04:28,045
Speaker 4:  there's a cliff coming and that's why you're hitting up retail investors

1272
01:04:28,145 --> 01:04:31,885
Speaker 4:  for cash. Yeah. With negative revenue. Yeah. Like that's however

1273
01:04:31,985 --> 01:04:35,485
Speaker 4:  you think about the trust and safety function of sub stack notes. When you're

1274
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:39,245
Speaker 4:  in that position and you're charging your, your most popular

1275
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:43,365
Speaker 4:  creators the most money to send emails,

1276
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:48,085
Speaker 4:  eventually one of them is gonna wake up and say, I wonder how much MailChimp

1277
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:48,805
Speaker 4:  costs. Yeah.

1278
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:49,165
Speaker 5:  There's

1279
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:49,925
Speaker 6:  You know there's other

1280
01:04:50,205 --> 01:04:52,045
Speaker 5:  Services they can use WordPress. Yeah, yeah.

1281
01:04:52,195 --> 01:04:56,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There's so much free stuff that they can go and do this on and

1282
01:04:56,715 --> 01:04:57,805
Speaker 6:  it's just doesn't seem

1283
01:04:58,155 --> 01:05:00,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's bad. I agree. All. right. So we're, we're all in agreement on

1284
01:05:00,925 --> 01:05:04,845
Speaker 5:  that one. I'm just gonna read you a bunch and I want you to tell me if any

1285
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:08,765
Speaker 5:  of these are not at least an 85. And then after that

1286
01:05:08,785 --> 01:05:12,605
Speaker 5:  we can, we can go to break. I have Pebble, which is objectively a 90. It

1287
01:05:12,605 --> 01:05:16,405
Speaker 5:  died. I didn't even RIP Pebble know what Pebble was. It was called T

1288
01:05:16,425 --> 01:05:19,285
Speaker 5:  two for a a minute because they just straight up were like, this is the new

1289
01:05:19,285 --> 01:05:22,525
Speaker 5:  Twitter and then it was Pebble, it's gone.

1290
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:26,565
Speaker 5:  There's also Noster, which is the other decentralized thing that Jack Dorsey

1291
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:30,325
Speaker 5:  is invested in. And then we have things like spout and Counter social and

1292
01:05:30,515 --> 01:05:33,485
Speaker 5:  post and WT social and co-host.

1293
01:05:34,085 --> 01:05:36,365
Speaker 6:  I thought these were all Mastodon instances.

1294
01:05:37,595 --> 01:05:41,485
Speaker 5:  Nope. Sadly. Do we have any reason to not put any

1295
01:05:41,485 --> 01:05:42,845
Speaker 5:  of these things at at least an 85?

1296
01:05:43,325 --> 01:05:46,725
Speaker 6:  I wanna put WT social at a zero just because I'm, I think it's funny.

1297
01:05:47,515 --> 01:05:48,205
Speaker 4:  It's your own list. I

1298
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:50,325
Speaker 6:  Wanna root for it. Just pick up I'm root Root for you. Wtt social. You

1299
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:51,405
Speaker 5:  Gotta believe in something. Yeah.

1300
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,605
Speaker 6:  It's my Tinker Bell. So

1301
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:57,045
Speaker 4:  I. They all have the same problem. They all have the same problem.

1302
01:05:57,155 --> 01:06:00,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's not users, it's not technology. Yeah. It's how are you gonna make

1303
01:06:00,405 --> 01:06:03,285
Speaker 4:  money? Yeah. What's your plan? Let's say, let's say you have a hundred of

1304
01:06:03,285 --> 01:06:07,045
Speaker 4:  the world's most dedicated spout users. Spout has a hundred people who are

1305
01:06:07,045 --> 01:06:10,445
Speaker 4:  logged onto it and they have 24 hours a day of user engagement from its a

1306
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:14,325
Speaker 4:  hundred people. What's the, what's the plan? Is it charge the money?

1307
01:06:14,715 --> 01:06:16,085
Speaker 6:  They'll make flower crowns.

1308
01:06:16,365 --> 01:06:19,925
Speaker 4:  I just think all these have a sort of blinkered view of what it would take

1309
01:06:19,925 --> 01:06:21,125
Speaker 4:  to replace Twitter, which is

1310
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:22,285
Speaker 5:  So does Mastodon. To be fair,

1311
01:06:22,285 --> 01:06:23,245
Speaker 4:  You just need a place to post.

1312
01:06:23,425 --> 01:06:25,765
Speaker 5:  We didn't levy that against Mastodon. It's true of Mastodon too.

1313
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:29,845
Speaker 4:  Mastodon first of all, is a company is like two people funded by a

1314
01:06:29,845 --> 01:06:33,605
Speaker 4:  government grant in Europe. Sure. And one contractor who manages billing,

1315
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:35,405
Speaker 4:  you should go listen to that episode of De

1316
01:06:35,405 --> 01:06:36,365
Speaker 5:  Dakota. No, that's that's real. Yeah.

1317
01:06:36,445 --> 01:06:39,245
Speaker 4:  I was like, what's your org chart? And he is like, well, there's me and Claire

1318
01:06:39,465 --> 01:06:43,125
Speaker 4:  and that's looking for, and obviously they have server costs and

1319
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:46,405
Speaker 4:  I'm sure they're gonna grow in different ways. Yeah. But as a company, this

1320
01:06:46,405 --> 01:06:50,365
Speaker 4:  is just a social experiment. I think if you're wt

1321
01:06:50,425 --> 01:06:52,765
Speaker 4:  social, you might believe you're a company.

1322
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If you believe hard enough, it could be a zero.

1323
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:58,565
Speaker 4:  And I, and I think if your company is modeled after Twitter a

1324
01:06:59,155 --> 01:07:02,965
Speaker 4:  notoriously poorly run company, you've just got some problems coming

1325
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:06,005
Speaker 4:  your way. Yeah. I think the Cold start problem of how do we get a network

1326
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:09,125
Speaker 4:  effect or how do we get a bunch of users is actually, and they're all trying

1327
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,965
Speaker 4:  to compete on weird ideas about what people had a problem with

1328
01:07:12,965 --> 01:07:16,685
Speaker 4:  on Twitter. And I think they all miss the fact that a lot of people liked

1329
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:19,805
Speaker 4:  how drama that a lot of people liked how dramatic Twitter was.

1330
01:07:20,225 --> 01:07:22,885
Speaker 5:  Or at least couldn't look away from it. Yeah. Right. Like it was, it had

1331
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:24,325
Speaker 5:  that car crash appeal.

1332
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:26,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. It's like, what if we made Twitter without car crashes? And it's

1333
01:07:26,885 --> 01:07:28,325
Speaker 4:  like, yeah, no, no one's coming.

1334
01:07:28,555 --> 01:07:31,925
Speaker 6:  Look at it anymore. I just want my Twitter person of the day. Yeah. I love

1335
01:07:31,925 --> 01:07:35,125
Speaker 6:  telling people who don't use Twitter about it. And they're just like, okay,

1336
01:07:35,515 --> 01:07:37,285
Speaker 6:  yeah. Anyway, here's what's going on with my kids.

1337
01:07:38,665 --> 01:07:42,005
Speaker 4:  Did you see Kevin Durant tweeted, I'm on Threads with a burner, come find

1338
01:07:42,005 --> 01:07:45,925
Speaker 4:  me. No way. And it's like, that's what people are here for. Yeah.

1339
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:47,325
Speaker 5:  Like, I respect that

1340
01:07:47,555 --> 01:07:50,445
Speaker 4:  He's not tweeting. I'm on wt social with a burner. Wait,

1341
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:54,325
Speaker 5:  So this is Threads to lose basically like, nobody has won this yet, but it,

1342
01:07:54,325 --> 01:07:58,285
Speaker 5:  it very much feels like the next 12 months are Threads to screw up.

1343
01:07:58,595 --> 01:08:02,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I, I would put it just, the mirror image is, it's a

1344
01:08:02,565 --> 01:08:05,645
Speaker 4:  negative 45 for Twitter and it's a positive 45 for Threads,

1345
01:08:06,745 --> 01:08:10,525
Speaker 4:  but it's about to be an election year. A lot of weird

1346
01:08:10,525 --> 01:08:14,285
Speaker 4:  stuff is gonna start happening on these platforms. Just a lot of

1347
01:08:14,285 --> 01:08:17,685
Speaker 4:  weird stuff. Yeah. And I, those numbers can move,

1348
01:08:18,105 --> 01:08:21,645
Speaker 4:  but I, I think Threads their attitude about news and realtime

1349
01:08:21,645 --> 01:08:24,525
Speaker 4:  information is just the, the pressure on that is just increasing.

1350
01:08:24,715 --> 01:08:27,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And that's gonna collide with an election in a pretty real way. Yeah.

1351
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:31,925
Speaker 4:  And sport and just sports. The NBA season has started, we're still in the

1352
01:08:31,925 --> 01:08:35,725
Speaker 4:  middle of the NFL season. Yeah. Like that audience is wanting to move to

1353
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:37,165
Speaker 4:  Threads and it's just like not happening.

1354
01:08:37,355 --> 01:08:40,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I think that's right. Yeah. The next 12 months I think are gonna

1355
01:08:40,205 --> 01:08:43,205
Speaker 5:  be really fascinating. Like, I think many of these we will not even mention

1356
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:47,245
Speaker 5:  in a year. And I think the stakes are going to feel

1357
01:08:47,255 --> 01:08:50,165
Speaker 5:  super high for a lot of these folks as we want towards an election. I,

1358
01:08:50,185 --> 01:08:53,725
Speaker 6:  I'm still rooting for WT social, which I've learned a lot about. It's got

1359
01:08:53,745 --> 01:08:55,965
Speaker 6:  two stars on Product hunt out

1360
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,005
Speaker 5:  Of five. Okay. We, that's, yeah, that's,

1361
01:08:58,245 --> 01:08:59,045
Speaker 6:  Lifewire has got a

1362
01:08:59,045 --> 01:09:00,285
Speaker 5:  Great, this segment has gone 19 on

1363
01:09:00,285 --> 01:09:00,805
Speaker 6:  How to use it.

1364
01:09:01,755 --> 01:09:05,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm just like, it's the non-toxic social, like that's great. I'm happy

1365
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,365
Speaker 4:  that there's a non-toxic social network.

1366
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,805
Speaker 5:  Okay. We, we've officially Alex is now googling wt social, which means we're

1372
01:11:31,675 --> 01:11:35,515
Speaker 4:  been posting at various Ford executives on my behalf. Thank you

Speaker 4:  things into a, you have to make the media company you want.

1376
01:11:46,305 --> 01:11:48,755
Speaker 5:  Neil as Vision board is just Thunderbolt four cables.

1377
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:53,635
Speaker 4:  They're very expensive. All. right. I'll take the first one, which

1378
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:57,555
Speaker 4:  I'm the, the only thing I wanted to talk about this week is Metal Gear.

1379
01:11:57,555 --> 01:12:01,515
Speaker 4:  Solid Delta. Snake Eater. You have now running an N reel. The top. It

1380
01:12:01,515 --> 01:12:04,475
Speaker 4:  was the first thing on the rundown. The first thing. And David moved it.

1381
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:07,235
Speaker 6:  I watched. It was great just watching it highlighted. And

1382
01:12:07,735 --> 01:12:11,035
Speaker 4:  In our editorial meeting today. So there's a lot of weird passive aggressive

1383
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,595
Speaker 4:  stuff that happens in enterprise software. And, what I was thinking about

1384
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:15,435
Speaker 4:  was David rerunning the rundown every week.

1385
01:12:16,015 --> 01:12:18,875
Speaker 5:  Can I just say, just before you get into this, this might be the greatest

1386
01:12:19,285 --> 01:12:23,275
Speaker 5:  video game title of all time. Metal Gear Solid Delta Colon Snake

1387
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:26,355
Speaker 5:  Eater. Yeah. Just whips to like, that's so good.

1388
01:12:29,105 --> 01:12:33,035
Speaker 4:  This is one of the greatest video games ever made. It was a PS two game.

1389
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:37,675
Speaker 4:  It just ruled. It ruled. And now it still looks like a video game.

1390
01:12:37,865 --> 01:12:41,475
Speaker 4:  Like You know, like you get new gameplay footage now. New engines that You

1391
01:12:41,475 --> 01:12:45,275
Speaker 4:  know it's still super, looks like a video game. But this game ruled. This

1392
01:12:45,275 --> 01:12:48,075
Speaker 6:  Used to be called something else though. This was Metal Gear Solid Snake

1393
01:12:48,245 --> 01:12:50,355
Speaker 4:  Eater. Yeah. It was Metal Gear. Solid three. Snake Eater.

1394
01:12:50,435 --> 01:12:51,315
Speaker 6:  I didn't get past one.

1395
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:52,355
Speaker 4:  Oh my God. Alex.

1396
01:12:52,575 --> 01:12:53,915
Speaker 6:  I'm still in a box somewhere. Plays

1397
01:12:53,915 --> 01:12:56,075
Speaker 4:  Station. The, the number of things that you and I just have to stream together,

1398
01:12:56,925 --> 01:13:00,075
Speaker 4:  right. Just on this show alone. Yeah. It's, it's all of the Metal gears now.

1399
01:13:00,305 --> 01:13:03,755
Speaker 4:  Just a full on week long Twitch stream. Yeah. Blade Trinity.

1400
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,155
Speaker 4:  And I believe Pump Up the volume is still,

1401
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:09,115
Speaker 6:  This is gonna be a good time. Everybody come join us. It's gonna be great.

1402
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:11,035
Speaker 4:  This is our, this is our, we're

1403
01:13:11,035 --> 01:13:14,315
Speaker 5:  Gonna start a podcast called Copyright Infringement in which we just watch

1404
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:14,835
Speaker 5:  all the things

1405
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:19,075
Speaker 4:  That we have to watch. I'm more excited about this game than I think happen.

1406
01:13:19,105 --> 01:13:20,995
Speaker 4:  This a defining video game.

1407
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:22,835
Speaker 6:  Are you gonna take that day off

1408
01:13:23,295 --> 01:13:27,035
Speaker 4:  And just burn through Metal? Gear. Solid? Yeah. Probably. Yeah, that's my

1409
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,275
Speaker 4:  idea. All, right. David, what's your love

1410
01:13:28,275 --> 01:13:32,235
Speaker 5:  That mine is a little tidbit of information we got. So we've talked a lot

1411
01:13:32,235 --> 01:13:35,595
Speaker 5:  about the Google Antitrust trial and one of the big open questions has been

1412
01:13:36,015 --> 01:13:39,755
Speaker 5:  how much money does Google pay Apple to be the exclusive search

1413
01:13:39,755 --> 01:13:43,315
Speaker 5:  engine on all the Apple devices? We knew it was billions of dollars.

1414
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:47,715
Speaker 5:  I had heard numbers as low as five and as high as 20. But these

1415
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:50,155
Speaker 5:  numbers have come out. But they've only come out in closed court and they're

1416
01:13:50,155 --> 01:13:53,515
Speaker 5:  not being given to reporters. Like the, the access to information has been

1417
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:57,115
Speaker 5:  a huge open question during all of this trial. The New York Times head of

1418
01:13:57,115 --> 01:14:00,995
Speaker 5:  report on Thursday that the actual number is

1419
01:14:01,155 --> 01:14:04,995
Speaker 5:  $18 billion, or at least in 2021, Google paid $18 billion to

1420
01:14:04,995 --> 01:14:08,915
Speaker 5:  Apple to be the default search engine in Safari. There was

1421
01:14:08,915 --> 01:14:12,525
Speaker 5:  also some interesting stuff in there that when Satya Nadella

1422
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:16,765
Speaker 5:  testified, he said, and it seemed like he was kind

1423
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:20,645
Speaker 5:  of guessing at the time, that one thing Apple might be

1424
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:24,165
Speaker 5:  worried about is that if it took the deal away from Google, Google would

1425
01:14:24,165 --> 01:14:27,685
Speaker 5:  use all of its many powerful and popular iOS apps to do things like

1426
01:14:27,685 --> 01:14:31,205
Speaker 5:  promote Chrome. Like if, if every time you went to Gmail it was just like,

1427
01:14:31,205 --> 01:14:33,885
Speaker 5:  Hey, download Chrome, a better browser. Like a lot of people would download

1428
01:14:33,885 --> 01:14:36,725
Speaker 5:  Chrome and they were very afraid that Google was gonna do that if it lost

1429
01:14:36,725 --> 01:14:40,525
Speaker 5:  the search deal. Satya said this like it was a possibility, but not that

1430
01:14:40,525 --> 01:14:44,085
Speaker 5:  he was certain, but the Times Report said that in fact Google was thinking

1431
01:14:44,085 --> 01:14:47,045
Speaker 5:  about doing exactly that and was building things to compete with Spotlight

1432
01:14:47,145 --> 01:14:50,885
Speaker 5:  and was gonna start to get people to use Chrome by using its other tools

1433
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:52,045
Speaker 5:  on iOS. How

1434
01:14:52,045 --> 01:14:55,565
Speaker 6:  Is that any different from right now if I go, if, if one of you send me a

1435
01:14:55,565 --> 01:14:58,605
Speaker 6:  Google doc and I try to open it on my phone on Safari, my phone

1436
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:03,245
Speaker 6:  flips out. Yeah. Unless I go and I download the stupid Google

1437
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:07,365
Speaker 6:  Docs app and log in and and use that. How is that

1438
01:15:07,365 --> 01:15:11,285
Speaker 5:  Any different? Google might be the single worst mobile program.

1439
01:15:11,665 --> 01:15:11,885
Speaker 5:  No,

1440
01:15:11,885 --> 01:15:15,605
Speaker 4:  No, no, no, no. It's slides. Google Slides is the single. Okay.

1441
01:15:15,605 --> 01:15:18,645
Speaker 5:  No, you're right. Mobile program. Google, Google Slides. Sheets and docs

1442
01:15:18,645 --> 01:15:19,365
Speaker 5:  are all Yeah. They're

1443
01:15:19,425 --> 01:15:23,165
Speaker 4:  Bad obsessed. But I'm saying slides is You know how every year the iPhone

1444
01:15:23,165 --> 01:15:26,765
Speaker 4:  comes out or any other phone comes out, we're like, this processor is crazy

1445
01:15:26,765 --> 01:15:29,645
Speaker 4:  fast. Like it's, oh, it's just there for headroom. I'm like, can this run

1446
01:15:29,645 --> 01:15:33,365
Speaker 4:  Google Slides? Because it probably can't. My phone's gonna get hot and it's

1447
01:15:33,365 --> 01:15:35,205
Speaker 4:  gonna slow down and crash. Google Slides

1448
01:15:35,705 --> 01:15:36,725
Speaker 6:  How slides on decks

1449
01:15:38,315 --> 01:15:41,605
Speaker 4:  Didn didn't wanna think about, let me unfold this stupid one. All. right.

1450
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:42,245
Speaker 4:  But keep going.

1451
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,205
Speaker 5:  But Well, so to answer your question though, it would be, it would be kind

1452
01:15:45,205 --> 01:15:48,925
Speaker 5:  of like, this is not a perfect analogy, but if you were to like open

1453
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:52,965
Speaker 5:  a pages document on your phone and Google just threw a popup being

1454
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,565
Speaker 5:  like, wouldn't you rather use Google Docs? Or if it was like,

1455
01:15:55,565 --> 01:15:56,685
Speaker 6:  It does that currently?

1456
01:15:57,225 --> 01:15:59,405
Speaker 5:  No. If you try to open a Google doc, it'll take you to

1457
01:15:59,405 --> 01:16:00,965
Speaker 6:  Google Docs. Okay. But if it does for anything, I'm

1458
01:16:00,965 --> 01:16:04,725
Speaker 5:  Saying if you, if you opened any webpage in Chrome and Chrome was like, wouldn't

1459
01:16:04,725 --> 01:16:05,725
Speaker 5:  you rather use Google Docs?

1460
01:16:05,905 --> 01:16:06,845
Speaker 6:  I'd set it on fire.

1461
01:16:07,035 --> 01:16:07,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Probably

1462
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:11,565
Speaker 6:  That, that like, that's my, that's my villain story. That's that's how you

1463
01:16:11,565 --> 01:16:13,325
Speaker 6:  get me to never wanna use your products again.

1464
01:16:14,545 --> 01:16:17,835
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But also it's how you get a lot of people to download your stuff. This

1465
01:16:17,835 --> 01:16:17,915
Speaker 5:  is

1466
01:16:17,915 --> 01:16:19,195
Speaker 6:  True. And, and Google kind

1467
01:16:19,195 --> 01:16:21,435
Speaker 5:  Of, I bet you also have the Google Docs app on your phone now.

1468
01:16:21,755 --> 01:16:23,795
Speaker 6:  I had to, it bullied me for so many years.

1469
01:16:23,865 --> 01:16:26,355
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is the thing. They're not to, they don't care. I needed to,

1470
01:16:26,435 --> 01:16:29,315
Speaker 6:  I needed to put my notes in for a story on the train.

1471
01:16:29,505 --> 01:16:32,995
Speaker 5:  This is, this is the thing. Right. And if you're Google, if you're Google

1472
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:37,035
Speaker 5:  and you can say, stay logged into YouTube, in the YouTube app by

1473
01:16:37,035 --> 01:16:40,355
Speaker 5:  logging into Chrome. I hate it. They're gonna get people to download Chrome.

1474
01:16:40,785 --> 01:16:43,475
Speaker 6:  It's, it's FTC do something about this. And,

1475
01:16:43,475 --> 01:16:43,595
Speaker 5:  And

1476
01:16:43,595 --> 01:16:45,995
Speaker 4:  Truthfully, well they, they have put Google in John trial.

1477
01:16:46,275 --> 01:16:47,155
Speaker 5:  I think it do

1478
01:16:47,155 --> 01:16:47,315
Speaker 6:  More.

1479
01:16:47,795 --> 01:16:50,795
Speaker 5:  I think it's possible that Google would never have actually done this. But

1480
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,635
Speaker 5:  the threat of doing it, right, at least the DOJ would tell you is

1481
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:57,955
Speaker 5:  enough to keep Apple along with $18 billion

1482
01:16:58,465 --> 01:17:00,195
Speaker 5:  from walking away from Google.

1483
01:17:00,395 --> 01:17:03,635
Speaker 6:  I wanna just talk about that for a second. Google, if you're listening, I

1484
01:17:03,635 --> 01:17:07,395
Speaker 6:  will also make you the default search app on my phone for 18.

1485
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:13,245
Speaker 4:  I'm here for you. Yeah. So it's interesting. The context of this is fascinating.

1486
01:17:13,345 --> 01:17:16,805
Speaker 4:  So in Europe Digital Services Act is in force.

1487
01:17:17,475 --> 01:17:21,325
Speaker 4:  Apple's gonna have to let people pick Chrome. Google will have to

1488
01:17:21,325 --> 01:17:25,085
Speaker 4:  let people switch default browsers in various ways. We'll just see if this

1489
01:17:25,485 --> 01:17:29,405
Speaker 4:  regulatory intervention actually does something. Notably for the past decade

1490
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:33,725
Speaker 4:  it has not. Right? Right. Like there have been browser ballots and search

1491
01:17:33,725 --> 01:17:36,685
Speaker 4:  ballots on Windows PCs and Android phones in Europe,

1492
01:17:37,155 --> 01:17:37,445
Speaker 5:  They

1493
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:38,605
Speaker 4:  Don't do anything. They don't do anything.

1494
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:42,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of evidence that shows that. The, the thing where

1495
01:17:42,285 --> 01:17:45,485
Speaker 5:  you boot up the phone and it says, what search engine do you wanna use? Everybody

1496
01:17:45,485 --> 01:17:46,405
Speaker 5:  picks Google. Right.

1497
01:17:46,425 --> 01:17:47,645
Speaker 4:  Here's what I'm curious about. Everybody

1498
01:17:47,645 --> 01:17:51,365
Speaker 5:  Picks Google in large part, the DOJ would argue because they've never heard

1499
01:17:51,365 --> 01:17:54,365
Speaker 5:  of any other search engine because of the way that Google does it. Yeah.

1500
01:17:54,385 --> 01:17:58,125
Speaker 5:  So people are like, what's kosher and why would I use that? I'm just gonna

1501
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:01,165
Speaker 5:  pick Google. And so, and this is the hard part of the DO j's case is they

1502
01:18:01,165 --> 01:18:05,085
Speaker 5:  have to wind this all the way back and essentially argue that Google has

1503
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:08,205
Speaker 5:  made it so that you've never even tried another search engine because it's

1504
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:11,965
Speaker 5:  impossible. And that is a very hard case to argue

1505
01:18:11,965 --> 01:18:14,765
Speaker 5:  when Google is like, they're just, they're just right there. Like, just go

1506
01:18:14,765 --> 01:18:14,965
Speaker 5:  do it.

1507
01:18:14,965 --> 01:18:17,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Here's what I'm curious about though. The only browser bot I could

1508
01:18:17,925 --> 01:18:21,725
Speaker 4:  see working, you turn on your iPhone and it says you want Chrome or Safari.

1509
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:25,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I think that's a coin flip and that's in this case too that Yep.

1510
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:26,845
Speaker 4:  People think that that's a coin flip.

1511
01:18:26,945 --> 01:18:30,285
Speaker 5:  That's two brands everybody's heard of. Yep. Which, which is, I I agree.

1512
01:18:30,285 --> 01:18:34,245
Speaker 5:  I think it'll be really fascinating and I would bet in somewhere in Apple

1513
01:18:34,245 --> 01:18:37,885
Speaker 5:  Park in Cupertino is Safari for Android. It's just sitting there.

1514
01:18:38,155 --> 01:18:38,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1515
01:18:39,035 --> 01:18:42,205
Speaker 4:  They made Safari for Windows once. Yeah. It didn't, didn't go well.

1516
01:18:42,445 --> 01:18:45,405
Speaker 5:  I think they would pick this fight backwards if they had to. Like they, they

1517
01:18:45,405 --> 01:18:48,045
Speaker 5:  will, they will bring it to Google if Google's gonna bring it to them. Yeah.

1518
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:51,045
Speaker 5:  And they're like, there's this like mutually assured destruction thing that

1519
01:18:51,045 --> 01:18:54,645
Speaker 5:  has worked for everybody for a long time. Again along with 18 billion bucks.

1520
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:59,805
Speaker 5:  And either it's gonna stay that way or it's gonna get all

1521
01:18:59,805 --> 01:19:01,285
Speaker 5:  unwound and I think it's gonna get Yeah.

1522
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:05,285
Speaker 4:  The other piece of this puzzle, which I think is a pretty important wrinkle

1523
01:19:05,285 --> 01:19:09,125
Speaker 4:  right now, is just a bunch of reporting this week that apple's behind an

1524
01:19:09,225 --> 01:19:13,165
Speaker 4:  AI or feels like it's behind an AI or needs to get better at AI and put

1525
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:16,845
Speaker 4:  it in all the products as you would expect. And the Apple's privacy

1526
01:19:17,835 --> 01:19:21,685
Speaker 4:  posture. We'll keep it from going and hoovering up a bunch of data or sharing

1527
01:19:21,765 --> 01:19:25,445
Speaker 4:  a bunch of data. And You know what would be a good source of data for an

1528
01:19:25,505 --> 01:19:29,445
Speaker 4:  AI tool is search queries. Yep. We know this 'cause they're a

1529
01:19:29,445 --> 01:19:33,365
Speaker 4:  great source for Google. And that's how Apple gets a bunch of differential

1530
01:19:33,365 --> 01:19:36,925
Speaker 4:  privacy shielded input. Totally.

1531
01:19:37,145 --> 01:19:38,765
Speaker 4:  For an AI system. It's on

1532
01:19:38,765 --> 01:19:41,925
Speaker 6:  Some little chip just right on the board so you don't have to worry about

1533
01:19:41,925 --> 01:19:42,005
Speaker 6:  it

1534
01:19:42,005 --> 01:19:43,765
Speaker 4:  Getting Yeah. You can see how they would do it. That's my Tim

1535
01:19:43,765 --> 01:19:44,325
Speaker 5:  Cook. That

1536
01:19:44,325 --> 01:19:45,045
Speaker 4:  Was good. Thank you. That's good.

1537
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:48,165
Speaker 4:  He's full vampire. Thanks

1538
01:19:49,825 --> 01:19:53,525
Speaker 4:  Vot. We'll see, I I, the dynamic there is interesting 'cause it might be

1539
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:57,285
Speaker 4:  an Apple's long term interest to not take the

1540
01:19:57,445 --> 01:19:58,005
Speaker 4:  $18 billion

1541
01:19:58,705 --> 01:20:00,525
Speaker 5:  No. Said no one ever.

1542
01:20:01,145 --> 01:20:04,205
Speaker 4:  If there's one company that can look past $18 billion. It's Apple,

1543
01:20:04,355 --> 01:20:07,765
Speaker 5:  It's Maston, Claire. Those are the only two

1544
01:20:08,525 --> 01:20:10,925
Speaker 4:  I really bad Everyone should go listening to Claire. He's a fascinating guy.

1545
01:20:10,985 --> 01:20:11,285
Speaker 4:  It was

1546
01:20:11,285 --> 01:20:11,565
Speaker 5:  A good one.

1547
01:20:11,585 --> 01:20:12,565
Speaker 4:  All, right. Cranz, what's yours?

1548
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:16,645
Speaker 6:  Okay, so mine is, shout out to Mia Sato. She has a really, really great story

1549
01:20:16,665 --> 01:20:20,565
Speaker 6:  up on the site right now called is my coworker, AI Bizarre product

1550
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:24,525
Speaker 6:  reviews leave Gannett staff wondering. It's really, really good story. It's

1551
01:20:24,525 --> 01:20:28,405
Speaker 6:  basically Reviewed, which is one of the, the sites for Gannet Gannett does

1552
01:20:28,405 --> 01:20:32,165
Speaker 6:  like USA today. And a lot of local newspapers reviewed as their kind of wire

1553
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:35,925
Speaker 6:  cutter and a bunch of new reviews appeared on it.

1554
01:20:36,145 --> 01:20:38,885
Speaker 6:  And everybody's like, I didn't write that. And then when they went and they

1555
01:20:38,885 --> 01:20:42,285
Speaker 6:  looked up the people, a lot of 'em didn't seem to exist.

1556
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:46,765
Speaker 6:  Oh boy. And so it seems that this was all per, like

1557
01:20:46,835 --> 01:20:50,645
Speaker 6:  this was stuff that Gant went partnered with another company who's using

1558
01:20:50,985 --> 01:20:54,805
Speaker 6:  AI to just write AI churn and then try to like, oh my God,

1559
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:55,685
Speaker 6:  sell you stuff.

1560
01:20:55,865 --> 01:20:57,045
Speaker 4:  Why don't I have these ideas?

1561
01:20:57,915 --> 01:21:01,685
Speaker 6:  Well, it's, it's not going great. The reviewed staff is, is pretty upset

1562
01:21:01,685 --> 01:21:05,365
Speaker 6:  about it. They just recently went on strike Over Union stuff

1563
01:21:05,435 --> 01:21:09,365
Speaker 6:  with, with Gannet, so with News Guild. So no disclaimer needed You

1564
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:10,805
Speaker 6:  know. Wow.

1565
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:11,925
Speaker 4:  Wow.

1566
01:21:11,925 --> 01:21:15,645
Speaker 6:  Alex you were, I could see you getting ready for it. So yeah, it's the, the

1567
01:21:15,645 --> 01:21:18,325
Speaker 6:  story is really good. It's, it's really, really why there's a bunch of stuff

1568
01:21:18,325 --> 01:21:21,925
Speaker 6:  we still don't know Yeah. About this, the rationale and everything like that,

1569
01:21:22,425 --> 01:21:24,845
Speaker 6:  but sucks for the folks that work there.

1570
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:28,885
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying if you work at a business and any one of your business thinks

1571
01:21:29,225 --> 01:21:32,885
Speaker 4:  we should just get some AI chum to get Google search results to make

1572
01:21:32,885 --> 01:21:34,445
Speaker 4:  pennies, you should leave that business.

1573
01:21:34,595 --> 01:21:38,085
Speaker 6:  There's a product pros and cons and apparently instead of like

1574
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:40,405
Speaker 6:  pros and cons, it's just specs.

1575
01:21:40,995 --> 01:21:44,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Did it just, or I mean on the flip side, if

1576
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:48,725
Speaker 4:  you are the scammer using AI to cheat Google out of pennies, you're You know

1577
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:50,885
Speaker 4:  buy another Lambo You know. Live it up like head. Yeah.

1578
01:21:50,925 --> 01:21:52,685
Speaker 6:  I was like, I was like, it's going great for you. These

1579
01:21:52,685 --> 01:21:56,245
Speaker 4:  Are the last days of Disco Brother. It's just like, but that

1580
01:21:56,525 --> 01:22:00,325
Speaker 4:  Internet's sending and this, this is the force that will end it. Yep. All

1581
01:22:00,325 --> 01:22:03,685
Speaker 4:  right. Here's mine. I'm very excited about this one. It's Humane's ai Pin.

1582
01:22:03,905 --> 01:22:06,165
Speaker 4:  Oh God. It was named Times Gadget of the Year.

1583
01:22:07,115 --> 01:22:07,405
Speaker 6:  Time

1584
01:22:08,025 --> 01:22:09,445
Speaker 5:  One, one of many to be fair.

1585
01:22:09,955 --> 01:22:12,645
Speaker 4:  It's just no one's ever seen it You know, like

1586
01:22:13,365 --> 01:22:17,165
Speaker 6:  I also have named it My Gadget of the Year. It's really serious.

1587
01:22:17,385 --> 01:22:17,605
Speaker 6:  Is

1588
01:22:17,605 --> 01:22:21,205
Speaker 4:  It? Sure. We learned that it has some integration with

1589
01:22:21,285 --> 01:22:25,165
Speaker 4:  GPT somehow in it and it has a light called the Trus

1590
01:22:25,165 --> 01:22:28,285
Speaker 4:  Light that lights up when it's listening. Which I would remind you is apparently

1591
01:22:28,345 --> 01:22:28,885
Speaker 4:  all the time

1592
01:22:29,385 --> 01:22:31,925
Speaker 6:  That's so it's just silly. A little glowing. There's

1593
01:22:31,925 --> 01:22:32,925
Speaker 4:  A little yellow light. You,

1594
01:22:33,155 --> 01:22:35,205
Speaker 5:  It's even a light. It's just a piece of yellow.

1595
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:41,085
Speaker 5:  I will say this time thing is interesting in that it has a couple of new

1596
01:22:41,085 --> 01:22:44,485
Speaker 5:  details like the trust light and the fact that it has a magnetic attachment.

1597
01:22:44,985 --> 01:22:48,925
Speaker 5:  That's something I like that part. That's cool. It also has one of the

1598
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:52,845
Speaker 5:  funniest disclosures in history. So again, you're putting

1599
01:22:53,105 --> 01:22:57,005
Speaker 5:  an unannounced product that really no one knows anything about on your

1600
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:00,925
Speaker 5:  best inventions of 2023 List Bold strategy. And then it's

1601
01:23:00,925 --> 01:23:04,685
Speaker 5:  his at the end. Investors in Humane include Time Co-chairs and owners,

1602
01:23:04,795 --> 01:23:07,885
Speaker 5:  mark and Lynn Benioff. Yep. It's just a tough look

1603
01:23:08,995 --> 01:23:12,885
Speaker 5:  like disclosure is our brand. We love a disclosure. That's

1604
01:23:12,885 --> 01:23:16,445
Speaker 5:  a tough one. This product you've never seen. It's so sick.

1605
01:23:16,595 --> 01:23:18,205
Speaker 5:  It's funded by my boss. You're gonna love

1606
01:23:18,205 --> 01:23:21,925
Speaker 4:  It. Best inventions of 2023. Well, I will say this,

1607
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:25,685
Speaker 4:  the owner of Time Magazine is scheduled to be on Decoder soon. There you

1608
01:23:25,685 --> 01:23:27,765
Speaker 4:  go. I'm gonna ask him about the Pin.

1609
01:23:27,945 --> 01:23:31,205
Speaker 5:  If he brings the AIP I'll I ask him Wear I'll it back. I'm gonna Yeah,

1610
01:23:31,385 --> 01:23:32,125
Speaker 6:  He he better

1611
01:23:32,285 --> 01:23:33,285
Speaker 4:  I ask him. We do. I hope he

1612
01:23:33,285 --> 01:23:33,565
Speaker 5:  Has it.

1613
01:23:33,985 --> 01:23:37,725
Speaker 4:  He won't do it. He's not gonna betray the Ohana. Are you kidding me?

1614
01:23:38,235 --> 01:23:38,685
Speaker 4:  Come on.

1615
01:23:40,865 --> 01:23:43,765
Speaker 5:  I'm fascinated by that thing though. It's, it's supposed to launch November 9th.

1616
01:23:44,115 --> 01:23:47,885
Speaker 5:  There's so much we don't know. They have done this like what,

1617
01:23:47,885 --> 01:23:51,685
Speaker 5:  eight month long hype cycle at this point. Humane, they've been out there

1618
01:23:51,685 --> 01:23:55,445
Speaker 5:  talking about this. I think the, that original TED Talk where he showed

1619
01:23:55,465 --> 01:23:59,005
Speaker 5:  off and or lied about a bunch of demos was in April.

1620
01:23:59,235 --> 01:24:03,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So we've been talking about this for a long time and this thing is

1621
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:06,725
Speaker 5:  either going to be great or it's gonna be a total disaster. And I have a

1622
01:24:06,725 --> 01:24:10,125
Speaker 5:  very hard time imagining anything in between and I have a much easier time

1623
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,405
Speaker 5:  imagining total disaster.

1624
01:24:12,665 --> 01:24:16,325
Speaker 4:  So there was some reporting that, again, open AI

1625
01:24:16,325 --> 01:24:19,845
Speaker 4:  integration. Sam Altman might be an investor in this thing. There's also

1626
01:24:19,845 --> 01:24:22,325
Speaker 4:  some reporting that Sam Altman and Johnny Iiv are working on their own thing,

1627
01:24:22,325 --> 01:24:25,725
Speaker 4:  which is fascinating 'cause Humane is a bunch of ex Apple

1628
01:24:26,085 --> 01:24:26,405
Speaker 4:  designers.

1629
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:31,765
Speaker 4:  That's gotta be be a weird email chain. Yeah. Just

1630
01:24:31,865 --> 01:24:34,565
Speaker 4:  in general, just a weird email chain. A

1631
01:24:34,565 --> 01:24:35,685
Speaker 6:  Lot of ellipses in that

1632
01:24:35,685 --> 01:24:35,805
Speaker 5:  One.

1633
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:39,725
Speaker 4:  Just a lot of thoughtfully considering materials. And then also you

1634
01:24:39,725 --> 01:24:42,845
Speaker 4:  betrayed me. You know, it's like it's all in there. I know, man. I'm, I'm

1635
01:24:42,845 --> 01:24:46,285
Speaker 4:  still stuck on the basics. You you wanna call Bethany? How does it know Bethany's

1636
01:24:46,285 --> 01:24:46,525
Speaker 4:  phone number

1637
01:24:47,065 --> 01:24:48,165
Speaker 5:  And how does it call Bethany?

1638
01:24:48,475 --> 01:24:52,085
Speaker 4:  Does Yeah. Does it have a service plan? How do you configure the, the

1639
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:55,765
Speaker 4:  IMEI magic. Just, just the basics. I just wanna know. Yep. It's

1640
01:24:55,765 --> 01:24:56,165
Speaker 5:  All magic.

1641
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:59,765
Speaker 4:  And it, I'm telling you, if this thing requires an app on your phone to function

1642
01:25:01,245 --> 01:25:01,405
Speaker 4:  disaster.

1643
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:01,845
Speaker 5:  Yep.

1644
01:25:02,585 --> 01:25:04,605
Speaker 4:  And it it ha it definitely does.

1645
01:25:04,825 --> 01:25:08,685
Speaker 5:  I'm so excited for this one. It's, it, it's gonna have to be 15 hours long

1646
01:25:08,685 --> 01:25:11,365
Speaker 5:  and it's just them explaining how it does basic things. I cannot wait.

1647
01:25:11,635 --> 01:25:15,405
Speaker 4:  It's very good. I should disclose that we are also owned

1648
01:25:15,865 --> 01:25:16,725
Speaker 6:  By human. By

1649
01:25:16,725 --> 01:25:16,885
Speaker 5:  Human.

1650
01:25:19,665 --> 01:25:22,085
Speaker 4:  No, that's not true. There was a number of disclosures we could've made on

1651
01:25:22,085 --> 01:25:25,965
Speaker 4:  this episode, but I leave those as an exercise to the viewer. No,

1652
01:25:25,965 --> 01:25:27,205
Speaker 4:  I don't think there were any. No problem.

1653
01:25:27,425 --> 01:25:27,965
Speaker 5:  No, we did good

1654
01:25:27,965 --> 01:25:29,725
Speaker 4:  This time. Yeah, we did. Good. All. right? Yay.

1655
01:25:31,545 --> 01:25:32,845
Speaker 5:  We should end the show Before we scripted this

1656
01:25:32,845 --> 01:25:36,205
Speaker 4:  Up, if you think we missed one, send us a note. You know we we're here for

1657
01:25:36,205 --> 01:25:38,005
Speaker 4:  it. I closed the tab with all that

1658
01:25:38,055 --> 01:25:39,245
Speaker 6:  Quick. Somebody talk about Netflix

1659
01:25:42,065 --> 01:25:44,905
Speaker 6:  FTX trial is, or no shout out is Lurker

1660
01:25:45,525 --> 01:25:49,345
Speaker 4:  All. right. A few things to mention before we close. Sam Bankman Fried

1661
01:25:49,365 --> 01:25:53,025
Speaker 4:  was on the stand in the FTX trial today. Liz Lato has been there

1662
01:25:53,555 --> 01:25:56,865
Speaker 4:  every day. She's having the time of her life covering this trial. Yeah.

1663
01:25:56,955 --> 01:25:59,505
Speaker 5:  Never. We're gonna have her on the show in the next week or so. Yeah. To

1664
01:25:59,505 --> 01:26:00,465
Speaker 5:  come talk about it. David,

1665
01:26:01,025 --> 01:26:04,645
Speaker 4:  I went to the premiere of the Bloomberg doc about FTX yesterday

1666
01:26:04,985 --> 01:26:07,565
Speaker 4:  and people walked up to me and were like, Liz is doing a great job covering

1667
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:10,525
Speaker 4:  the trial. That's incredible. So she's having the time of her life and I'm

1668
01:26:10,525 --> 01:26:13,765
Speaker 4:  eager to see what Sam had to say today. And then we have

1669
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:18,125
Speaker 4:  incredible, I guess you could say a spooky story about

1670
01:26:18,195 --> 01:26:21,645
Speaker 4:  someone who has been tormenting professors

1671
01:26:21,825 --> 01:26:25,445
Speaker 4:  online. And it is one of our best layouts ever. It's very cool.

1672
01:26:26,225 --> 01:26:30,045
Speaker 4:  Go read it. It's, it's great. And then lastly, as you all know,

1673
01:26:30,255 --> 01:26:33,605
Speaker 4:  we've been covering Google obsessively this year. Just the culture Google

1674
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,525
Speaker 4:  made, like I said, the last day's of disco, you gotta put the marker down

1675
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:40,125
Speaker 4:  and see like this is the world we made before we move on. So we've been covering

1676
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:44,085
Speaker 4:  Google and Google's SEO web and

1677
01:26:44,085 --> 01:26:46,845
Speaker 4:  we have a really great one this week from Mia, who's been on a run lately.

1678
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:50,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's called The restaurant. nearest Google. It's about a restaurant

1679
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:54,005
Speaker 4:  called Thai Food Near me in New York City, which is, that's the whole

1680
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:57,645
Speaker 4:  name. The SEO has broken out of the internet people. Yep. And she found a

1681
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,885
Speaker 4:  bunch of other businesses around the country. Notary near me is very popular.

1682
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:04,685
Speaker 4:  Barbershop near me is very popular. And she just went and talked to these

1683
01:27:04,685 --> 01:27:07,805
Speaker 4:  folks about why they named their business as this. And we got a lot of comments

1684
01:27:07,835 --> 01:27:11,565
Speaker 4:  like this is like when people named them the A one Auto Shop. Yep. They're

1685
01:27:11,565 --> 01:27:14,845
Speaker 4:  just trying to beat the discovery algorithm. But this is, this is a new way

1686
01:27:14,845 --> 01:27:18,085
Speaker 4:  of doing it. And then of course, Google's in the story being like, that's

1687
01:27:18,085 --> 01:27:22,045
Speaker 4:  not how It works. Which is a lot of our Google coverage involves that

1688
01:27:22,045 --> 01:27:25,125
Speaker 4:  dynamic. But the story is great. The pictures are incredible. And Mia said

1689
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:28,485
Speaker 4:  the food was good, which is important. So go check that out. It's on the
