00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:06,365
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Undersea Cable

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:10,005
Speaker 2:  Management. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am sitting here

4
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:13,925
Speaker 2:  after a bunch of travel doing what it turns out I do like a few times

5
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:17,805
Speaker 2:  a year, which is basically get bored with all of my gadgets and instead of

6
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:21,605
Speaker 2:  buying new gadgets, I try to just like change everything

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:25,285
Speaker 2:  about the ones that I have to make them more interesting. So like

8
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:29,445
Speaker 2:  I just took the monitor on my computer off of a stand, which I've had

9
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:33,405
Speaker 2:  it on for a while and put it onto a monitor arm. Does that make any

10
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,845
Speaker 2:  difference? No, but it feels new now and that's very exciting. Like I

11
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,725
Speaker 2:  changed the lock screen on my phone and I switched it from dark

12
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:44,685
Speaker 2:  mode to light mode. Suddenly feels like a new phone. The real best version

13
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:48,645
Speaker 2:  of that, by the way, is buy a new case or take the case off. All of a

14
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:51,885
Speaker 2:  sudden it's like you have a completely new device and it only cost you a

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,685
Speaker 2:  few dollars or absolutely nothing at all. I also change the watch face

16
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:59,525
Speaker 2:  on my Apple watch. I tend to like go from one pair of

17
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:03,205
Speaker 2:  headphones to another pair of headphones for a while. I'll change the wallpapers

18
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:06,725
Speaker 2:  on all of my devices. It just kind of makes everything feel new and exciting

19
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:10,405
Speaker 2:  without actually making any meaningful changes because otherwise if I let

20
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:13,765
Speaker 2:  this feeling go on long enough, I end up buying something I

21
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,645
Speaker 2:  absolutely do not need, or like upgrading my perfectly good computer

22
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:21,845
Speaker 2:  just out of sheer, like need to have something new.

23
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:25,685
Speaker 2:  So I figure a wallpaper is probably easier and definitely cheaper.

24
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:29,365
Speaker 2:  Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up for you today. We're gonna do two

25
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:33,245
Speaker 2:  things. First, we're gonna talk to Josh Jeza, who has spent a long time

26
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:37,045
Speaker 2:  reporting a big story for The Verge about undersea cables and

27
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:40,605
Speaker 2:  what that means basically about the infrastructure of the internet, that

28
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:44,325
Speaker 2:  the way that we connect to the world is just a bunch of cables

29
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,245
Speaker 2:  in the ocean that is both more interesting, more important and more

30
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:51,605
Speaker 2:  unstable than you might realize. So we're gonna talk about how all of that

31
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:55,405
Speaker 2:  works and what it takes to keep it working. We're also gonna talk to Tom

32
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:59,365
Speaker 2:  Warren and Joanna Nelius about the Chip race that seems like it's

33
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:03,125
Speaker 2:  coming for us. Pretty soon. Microsoft has been making noise about

34
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:07,125
Speaker 2:  how it thinks this next generation of Qualcomm chips could bring

35
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:11,005
Speaker 2:  Windows computers on par performance wise with the latest

36
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,405
Speaker 2:  max from Apple, which would be a big deal. And if Qualcomm chips are

37
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:19,245
Speaker 2:  finally as good as they've been promised for a really long time, it could

38
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:22,965
Speaker 2:  change the PC landscape in huge ways. We also have a

39
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:26,085
Speaker 2:  Hotline question about e Inc and E-readers because this is The Vergecast,

40
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:29,885
Speaker 2:  of course we do. And lots of other stuff to get to also. It's gonna be super

41
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:33,445
Speaker 2:  fun, really fun episode. All of that is coming up in just a second,

42
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:36,685
Speaker 2:  but I've now been using light mode for like three minutes and I hate it.

43
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:39,645
Speaker 2:  I'm going back to dark mode. Gotta make that switch. This is The Vergecast.

44
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:40,405
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

45
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:31,605
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Over the last few years, one of those ongoing news stories

46
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,365
Speaker 2:  that always makes me stop and think is whenever a company

47
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:39,445
Speaker 2:  usually Google or Meta recently announces that they're starting a

48
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,285
Speaker 2:  project to build a cable between countries or continents or across

49
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:47,165
Speaker 2:  the ocean. Like in 2022, both those companies announced these big

50
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:51,085
Speaker 2:  plans to build cables pretty much all the way around the African

51
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:55,285
Speaker 2:  continent. The diagrams of them alone are mind blowing. Just imagine

52
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:59,445
Speaker 2:  you were sort of loosely tracing your way around Africa three or four

53
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:03,325
Speaker 2:  times all the way around. That's what it looks like. Thousands of miles of

54
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:06,965
Speaker 2:  cable underneath the ocean hitting land at these various points all around

55
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:10,925
Speaker 2:  Africa. And increasingly, this is what the whole world looks like.

56
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,765
Speaker 2:  The whole internet is just right there underneath the ocean all over the

57
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:18,365
Speaker 2:  world. The VIRs, Josh Jeza has been reporting on these cables for months

58
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:22,605
Speaker 2:  and he's found himself inside a whole huge industry that really

59
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:26,405
Speaker 2:  nobody ever knows or talks about, which is the folks tasked with laying

60
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:30,605
Speaker 2:  and just as important, maintaining and fixing these undersea cables.

61
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:34,605
Speaker 2:  If you're hearing this on Tuesday as this podcast goes live, his story

62
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,605
Speaker 2:  just also went up. We might have actually beaten him by a couple of hours,

63
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,685
Speaker 2:  so keep an eye on The Verge dot com. So we figured we'd have him on the show

64
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:44,325
Speaker 2:  to talk about it and explain this whole under the sea world to us.

65
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:48,725
Speaker 2:  Josh Dzieza, welcome back to The Vergecast. Thank you. You have spent

66
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:52,485
Speaker 2:  however many months at sea learning about

67
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:56,685
Speaker 2:  the weird machinations of the internet. Yes. Unfortunately

68
00:05:57,145 --> 00:06:00,485
Speaker 6:  An import, but I guess it's still technically the sea.

69
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:04,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's good enough. So I want to like talk through

70
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:07,525
Speaker 2:  this big story that you've been working on and just publish for us. But I

71
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:11,445
Speaker 2:  also want to kind of explain the infrastructure of the internet in a

72
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:15,045
Speaker 2:  way that I think you're now sort of uniquely set up to do. And

73
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:18,685
Speaker 2:  my sense is what you've discovered, if we're just going to start from the

74
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:22,565
Speaker 2:  very beginning, is that like yes, in fact the internet is just a series

75
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:23,125
Speaker 2:  of tubes?

76
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,565
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. It is a series of tubes. I was surprised at actually how

77
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:32,045
Speaker 6:  tube-like they are. Like you imagine, at least I imagine, I feel

78
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:35,285
Speaker 6:  like a lot of people imagine kind of big pipes at the bottom of the ocean,

79
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:39,205
Speaker 6:  but it's actually just little garden hose with tubes

80
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:42,725
Speaker 6:  running between continents. They have some Fiverr optic cables in the middle,

81
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:47,125
Speaker 6:  basically just strands of glass that's lasers pulsing

82
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,605
Speaker 6:  through in code data and that is how data travels around the world.

83
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:51,285
Speaker 6:  So

84
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,725
Speaker 2:  Give me kind of the big picture way to think about this

85
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:58,565
Speaker 2:  infrastructure. Like I know it's lots of very long cables,

86
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,485
Speaker 2:  but like how, how sort of big and sprawling is the undersea

87
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:03,445
Speaker 2:  cable universe?

88
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:08,205
Speaker 6:  It's huge. It's, there are 500 or

89
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:12,005
Speaker 6:  so cables around the world, around 800,000 miles of

90
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,845
Speaker 6:  cabling. Often going through between sort of big

91
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:19,805
Speaker 6:  population centers. So you have a lot going from uk, Western Europe

92
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:23,925
Speaker 6:  to New York, New Jersey. On the other side you

93
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:27,805
Speaker 6:  have various parts of California going to Japan or

94
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:31,645
Speaker 6:  other locations in Asia. And that is how, you know,

95
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:35,365
Speaker 6:  you think about these big global networks. You are, even if

96
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:39,445
Speaker 6:  you're not always, like, if two people in America in the US

97
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:43,205
Speaker 6:  are emailing, they're probably just on terrestrial cables. But the

98
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:46,765
Speaker 6:  second you're accessing data that's overseas in some capacity, If,

99
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:51,245
Speaker 6:  you are watching YouTube videos that were posted from somewhere overseas.

100
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:55,205
Speaker 6:  It's cached locally at a data center, but it got there using an undersea

101
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:59,005
Speaker 6:  cable from some other data center somewhere. And If, you of course zoom or

102
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,365
Speaker 6:  email or whatever with someone overseas, it's going through one of these

103
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:03,365
Speaker 6:  cables. Right?

104
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:07,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. How would you think about in the sort of day-to-day life of a normal

105
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:10,165
Speaker 2:  person, how important are these cables, do you think?

106
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:14,045
Speaker 6:  I would say they're very important, but they might not be

107
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:18,525
Speaker 6:  directly accessing them every day. If you're on a big continent like North

108
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:22,405
Speaker 6:  America, you're largely traveling over a terrestrial network, but services

109
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:26,005
Speaker 6:  you interact with are dependent on these

110
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:30,045
Speaker 6:  cables. So you have like big global platforms like YouTube and TikTok. That

111
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:33,285
Speaker 6:  content is reaching you. Like the last mile

112
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:37,725
Speaker 6:  is gonna be terrestrial, but it got to North America

113
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:41,685
Speaker 6:  using a subsea cable. A lot of financial data, any

114
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:45,565
Speaker 6:  kind of international transfer is happening on a subsea cable.

115
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,325
Speaker 6:  Anytime you call customer service and you're talking to someone

116
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:53,645
Speaker 6:  overseas that's on the subsea cable and then you have kind of the

117
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:57,285
Speaker 6:  bits of the internet, you have, you know, my own website,

118
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:01,925
Speaker 6:  it might seem like it's local, but you have, you know, software

119
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:05,085
Speaker 6:  libraries and various things that could be stored somewhere else that it's

120
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:08,925
Speaker 6:  calling on and you don't necessarily know where it's coming from.

121
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:13,085
Speaker 6:  So I would say every day you're doing something that

122
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,925
Speaker 6:  maybe on a secondary tertiary level relies on these cables.

123
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:21,165
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. And undersea cables, if, if I understand correctly, are

124
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:24,565
Speaker 2:  not like a new internety idea, right? The idea of

125
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:28,845
Speaker 2:  having a cable that connects the United States to Europe and Europe

126
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:32,965
Speaker 2:  to Africa and Africa to Asia or whatever, we know how to do

127
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:34,045
Speaker 2:  this at this point, right?

128
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:38,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. One of the surprising things to me in doing this story is

129
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,725
Speaker 6:  how little this has changed over the years. And I'm not just talking like

130
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:45,845
Speaker 6:  the decades of the internet, but like a lot of these companies trace their

131
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:49,685
Speaker 6:  lineages back to the telegraph era. And a lot of the practices are, are date

132
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:53,525
Speaker 6:  from the Telegraph era. Like you lay cables, you repair cables pretty much

133
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:56,125
Speaker 6:  how you did in the 19th century.

134
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:59,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. We're talking like mid 18 hundreds, right when the telegraph was starting

135
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:01,805
Speaker 2:  to kind of move around the world. Yeah.

136
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:05,165
Speaker 6:  You read these accounts of the early telegraph people and, and it's quite

137
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:08,245
Speaker 6:  a lot of, it's trial by air. It's quite exciting. It's people, they don't

138
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:10,805
Speaker 6:  really know how electricity works, they don't really know what the bottom

139
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:14,005
Speaker 6:  of the ocean looks like and they're just sort of setting out, being like,

140
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:17,765
Speaker 6:  well, we strung a cable over through the English channel, like

141
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:20,245
Speaker 6:  why not do the ocean? And it's

142
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:20,565
Speaker 2:  Just more

143
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:24,165
Speaker 6:  Water. It goes terribly for, for several decades before they eventually figure

144
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:24,765
Speaker 6:  out how to do it.

145
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:29,125
Speaker 2:  Okay. So today, what does it take to keep all these important

146
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,045
Speaker 2:  garden hoses safe and working?

147
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:35,325
Speaker 6:  So they're breaking all the time. They break 200 times a year.

148
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,485
Speaker 6:  It's like every other day a cable breaks.

149
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:40,965
Speaker 2:  So we have 500 cables and 200 of them break every year. Right?

150
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:44,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Wow. They get 200 breaks. Sometimes they're on the same cable. It's

151
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:47,285
Speaker 6:  complicated. But yeah, basically a good chunk of them are breaking,

152
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:51,525
Speaker 6:  there's enough redundancy in the system that data can be routed

153
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:55,405
Speaker 6:  around on alternate paths. So you don't really notice, but

154
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:58,965
Speaker 6:  you know, if they, if 200 cables were to stay broken, you would notice things,

155
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:03,085
Speaker 6:  very bad things would happen. So yeah, these breaks happen all the time,

156
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:07,445
Speaker 6:  200 times a year. And when one breaks traffic

157
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:11,445
Speaker 6:  is rerouted along alternate paths and while that's happening, one

158
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:15,365
Speaker 6:  of this small band of ships will sail out with some spare cable

159
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:19,325
Speaker 6:  and fix the break. you know, as the internet has become more important there,

160
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:23,045
Speaker 6:  there was a report that was interesting a couple years ago that talks

161
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:27,005
Speaker 6:  about how cables have not become more vulnerable in recent years.

162
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:31,125
Speaker 6:  It's just that our dependence on them has grown exponentially.

163
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:35,365
Speaker 6:  Hmm. So say in the nineties there's an a massive break. Some

164
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:38,325
Speaker 6:  things break it, it's not bad. You might not notice in your day-to-day life

165
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,445
Speaker 6:  now everything breaks, you know, banks stop working,

166
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:46,405
Speaker 6:  companies can't function, supply chains, break websites don't load. We rely

167
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:50,165
Speaker 6:  on it for everything. But the industry that repairs it keeps things

168
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:53,885
Speaker 6:  running is basically the same. It's just sort of handled by private

169
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:58,045
Speaker 6:  companies that have a bunch of contracts with cable

170
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:01,845
Speaker 6:  owners and they have this arrangement that is sort of,

171
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:05,965
Speaker 6:  you know, days back half a century maybe, where everyone kind of

172
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:10,125
Speaker 6:  pays into a organizing body that has a couple

173
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:14,325
Speaker 6:  ships that stand by and repair any cables that break in a

174
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,925
Speaker 6:  big zone. And like the zone is the Atlantic ocean.

175
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:21,445
Speaker 2:  It's a big, big zone. Yeah. So how do these cables break?

176
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:25,485
Speaker 6:  Overwhelmingly, it's people break them, specifically

177
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:28,605
Speaker 6:  fishing vessels break a lot of cables. You have these

178
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:32,525
Speaker 6:  dredging nets, traw fishing, they

179
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:37,085
Speaker 6:  scraped these big hooks across the bottom of the sea with a

180
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:39,885
Speaker 6:  net and they snap cables all the time.

181
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:43,965
Speaker 2:  So it's not like a targeted attack on the cable, it's just sort, this gets

182
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:46,765
Speaker 2:  caught up in the phishing net and snaps kind of thing. Yeah. One

183
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,405
Speaker 6:  Of the interest there, there's been hardly any proven hostile

184
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:54,285
Speaker 6:  attacks on a cable. It's almost all just sort of accidental damage.

185
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:58,405
Speaker 6:  You have a fishing, fishing vessel, you have like a ship drags

186
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:01,765
Speaker 6:  its anchor in the wrong place, things like that. And then you have natural

187
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,685
Speaker 6:  disasters, you have like landslides under the ocean basically earthquakes,

188
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:09,645
Speaker 6:  volcanoes, weird currents, things like that. And then, you

189
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:13,445
Speaker 6:  know, if there have been cable breaks that people suspect could maybe be

190
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:17,285
Speaker 6:  from a malicious actor, but it's never really been proven. The one

191
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:20,805
Speaker 6:  case I've seen cited was like during World War I when

192
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:24,765
Speaker 6:  various the UK and and Germany sort of sent people a

193
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:28,525
Speaker 6:  short of cut telegraph cables with axes. Other than that, there

194
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:31,965
Speaker 6:  hasn't really been any documented cases of a, of attack on a cable

195
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:32,725
Speaker 6:  world

196
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,885
Speaker 2:  War i a lot of fights over TikTok and World War I. Right, right. From, from

197
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:39,725
Speaker 2:  what I remember. So you, you mentioned the, the maintenance industry here.

198
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:44,005
Speaker 2:  What does this industry look like? This feels like this incredibly

199
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:48,045
Speaker 2:  important gigantic job. Like is this, is this a

200
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:51,525
Speaker 2:  huge teaming industry of huge teaming multinational

201
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,205
Speaker 2:  corporations fixing the internet?

202
00:13:53,595 --> 00:13:57,005
Speaker 6:  It's really not. It's actually quite a small industry like

203
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:01,565
Speaker 6:  ballpark, maybe a thousand or so people in the direct sort of maritime

204
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:03,685
Speaker 6:  side of maintenance you have for

205
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:06,005
Speaker 2:  All 800,000 miles of undersea cables.

206
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:10,045
Speaker 6:  That's right. Wow. So you have, there's about 70 cable ships in the world,

207
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:14,325
Speaker 6:  but most of them mostly do installations, which pays better. You have like

208
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:18,245
Speaker 6:  22 or so dedicated maintenance vessels

209
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:23,045
Speaker 6:  and they are stationed around the world, you know, a handful per

210
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:26,525
Speaker 6:  ocean basically. And their job is to,

211
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:30,605
Speaker 6:  you know, like firefighters stand ready 24 hours a day

212
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:35,085
Speaker 6:  to sail out within 24 hours of being notified of a cable fault. So

213
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:38,685
Speaker 6:  they belong to these consortiums. They, you know, maybe a couple different

214
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:42,645
Speaker 6:  minutes providers have a ship in a given ocean

215
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:46,325
Speaker 6:  and they cover the whole area. And if you're a cable owner, you call the

216
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:49,445
Speaker 6:  maintenance provider and say, Hey, I have a cable broken. Send a ship out.

217
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:53,645
Speaker 6:  And they send a ship app to fix the cable is basically how, how

218
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:53,925
Speaker 6:  it works.

219
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:57,405
Speaker 2:  Wow. It's like, it's like an adventure story every time they're like, we

220
00:14:57,405 --> 00:15:01,165
Speaker 2:  have to, we have to go explore the depths of the ocean to find a

221
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:03,325
Speaker 2:  broken garden hose and figure out what to do with it.

222
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:07,285
Speaker 6:  It really is like drop everything. We go to a random

223
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,605
Speaker 6:  place in the middle of the ocean often.

224
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:13,885
Speaker 2:  Wow. 22 ships strikes me as not a lot of ships

225
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:18,285
Speaker 2:  to cover a all of the problems you've described and b, just the

226
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:22,045
Speaker 2:  sheer size and scope of all of this. Can they do it with

227
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:22,645
Speaker 2:  22 ships?

228
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:25,645
Speaker 6:  So they have done it with 22 ships.

229
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,085
Speaker 2:  Okay, fair. I guess Yeah, the internet still works. We're still here. Okay.

230
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,365
Speaker 6:  I think the, the, the concern is that a lot of these ships are getting pretty

231
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,765
Speaker 6:  old. They're like several decades old. There's not a lot of money coming

232
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:40,485
Speaker 6:  into the industry. And if there were to be a big event

233
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:44,325
Speaker 6:  like a big earthquake or a deliberate attack on a cable

234
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:48,125
Speaker 6:  choke point or something like that, then you could have a real disruption.

235
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:52,085
Speaker 6:  So the ships are really this critical component of the

236
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,005
Speaker 6:  internet that so far have been able to

237
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:59,925
Speaker 6:  keep things running, but it's pretty lean if there were a major event that

238
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,045
Speaker 6:  it would be challenging I think in some cases for them to, to do the job.

239
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:03,805
Speaker 6:  Okay.

240
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:07,885
Speaker 2:  And who are these people? Is this like a, is this a sort of manual

241
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:11,925
Speaker 2:  labor kind of job on a ship? Is this like a incredibly

242
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:16,085
Speaker 2:  technically complicated job on a ship? Like who, who are these folks doing

243
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:16,885
Speaker 2:  this work on these ships?

244
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,405
Speaker 6:  It's both manual labor and very technically complicated. You have a mix

245
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:25,165
Speaker 6:  of, you have crew who are sort of seafarers and run the ship and then you

246
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:29,125
Speaker 6:  have cable engineers who kind of come from all the kinds of different

247
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:33,045
Speaker 6:  backgrounds. But the job requires, you have

248
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:36,645
Speaker 6:  to be quite good at geometry and, and

249
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:39,925
Speaker 6:  angles and forces and sort of ocean engineering stuff to

250
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:45,085
Speaker 6:  know how to, you know, pull up a cable from several miles to

251
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:48,165
Speaker 6:  the bottom of the ocean without things snapping. You're dealing with these

252
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:52,165
Speaker 6:  big metal hooks that are used to catch the cables, high tensions. It's like

253
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:56,085
Speaker 6:  quite physically demanding work. And then at its heart

254
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:59,845
Speaker 6:  it's these various technical tasks that involved with

255
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:04,285
Speaker 6:  figurine out where the fault is splicing the fibers, which is

256
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:08,045
Speaker 6:  just ultra precise work that's done. you know, you're

257
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:12,125
Speaker 6:  fusing two strands of glass end to end with as perfect as you

258
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,165
Speaker 6:  can get a connection. And that stuff is, it's, you know, it's like

259
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:18,085
Speaker 6:  neurosurgery. It's, it's extremely delicate

260
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,925
Speaker 2:  And you have to do it on a ship in the middle of the ocean,

261
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:24,925
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. On a, on a rocking ship that is in the middle of the ocean.

262
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:29,005
Speaker 2:  This is like everything possible on incredibly hard mode at all times.

263
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:33,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. It's pretty, as you see the, the workshops and it's just like

264
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:36,965
Speaker 6:  in the belly of a ship sort of surrounded by tarps, it's really not, you

265
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:40,005
Speaker 6:  know, it's not this fa precision factory that you would wanna be doing this

266
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:40,405
Speaker 6:  work in.

267
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:44,565
Speaker 2:  So now I can't help imagining the, the like montage

268
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:48,045
Speaker 2:  action scene of everybody snapping into action. One of these things happening.

269
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:51,885
Speaker 2:  So like, walk me through the process a little bit. I'm in port in some

270
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:56,405
Speaker 2:  centrally located city somewhere waiting for a call. I get a call

271
00:17:56,405 --> 00:18:00,085
Speaker 2:  from, I'm assuming it's like Google and Meta who seem to be the companies

272
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,645
Speaker 2:  that own more and more of these cables over time. They

273
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:05,885
Speaker 6:  Own a lot of the cables. They've, a lot of the newly built cables are coming

274
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,045
Speaker 6:  from the big, big tech companies, Google and Meta

275
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:13,045
Speaker 6:  primarily. And then you have cables that are owned by, you know,

276
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:14,325
Speaker 6:  dozen, sometimes

277
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,525
Speaker 6:  ISPs and telecom companies and things. Got it. Okay. And so

278
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:23,565
Speaker 6:  each cable will have someone who's in charge of maintenance

279
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:27,605
Speaker 6:  and you know, they'll get a message from their

280
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:31,205
Speaker 6:  network operation center saying, Hey, we've got a cable down, here's what

281
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:34,645
Speaker 6:  we know about it. That person will then call someone at the

282
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,365
Speaker 6:  repair organization. They can be public or private, but it's one of these

283
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:39,405
Speaker 6:  consortiums usually.

284
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:42,245
Speaker 2:  I was really hoping there would be like a big red button on somebody's desk

285
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:45,645
Speaker 2:  that's like cable down and the alarms start going off in the ship somewhere.

286
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:49,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It, there are alarms and big red warnings, but then it's a lot of people

287
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:53,685
Speaker 6:  calling people around the world at weird hours. So they call someone

288
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:57,765
Speaker 6:  at the, on the maintenance side, that person then calls the ship and says,

289
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:01,565
Speaker 6:  you know, get ready, we're gonna need X miles of spare

290
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:05,445
Speaker 6:  cable for this cable system. We think it's here, we think this, cut it,

291
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:08,445
Speaker 6:  whatever information they have. And then they, and then they kind of plan

292
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,005
Speaker 6:  out what the repairs gonna look like.

293
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,645
Speaker 2:  Okay. And what, what does a repair normally look like? Like walk me through

294
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,605
Speaker 2:  a little bit of what it would look like actually on the boat trying to do

295
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:16,965
Speaker 2:  the repair.

296
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:21,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so the First thing you do is you need to locate where the fault is

297
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:24,565
Speaker 6:  approximately. And that's done on either end of the cable.

298
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:28,805
Speaker 6:  Basically you have people in the landing station on

299
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:31,765
Speaker 6:  either end of the cable, so you on opposite sides of the ocean,

300
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:36,445
Speaker 6:  shoot a laser down there and it hits, the brake reflects

301
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:40,165
Speaker 6:  back, and the time it takes to come back will tell you pretty much where

302
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,245
Speaker 6:  along the cable the, the brake is.

303
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:45,805
Speaker 2:  So like wherever the signal dies, that's, that's the point you send them

304
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:46,005
Speaker 2:  to?

305
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:50,285
Speaker 6:  Exactly. Okay. And so you sail out to there with a

306
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:53,805
Speaker 6:  certain amount of spare cable in your ship and a bunch of these big hooks

307
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,845
Speaker 6:  that are called grappl mills, which

308
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:59,445
Speaker 2:  I Googled by the way, and they just straight up look like Batman's grappling

309
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:01,165
Speaker 2:  hooks. Like that's just, that's just what they are.

310
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,845
Speaker 6:  That's exactly what they are. And there's a bunch of different kinds. You

311
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:07,485
Speaker 6:  have like multi grapple things. You have ones with giant

312
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:11,565
Speaker 6:  arms and blades, depending on what the ocean bottom looks like, whether

313
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:15,405
Speaker 6:  it's muddy or rocky or what cables are laid with such little slack

314
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:19,325
Speaker 6:  on the seabed that you can't just, you know, hook it and pull it to the surface.

315
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:23,685
Speaker 6:  Ah, it's too hot. So the First thing you need to do is you need to cut the

316
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:27,605
Speaker 6:  cable somewhere near where it's broken using one of these grappl metals,

317
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:31,365
Speaker 6:  but one with a big blade in the middle. So you drag this blade across

318
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:35,205
Speaker 6:  where you think the cable path is, and then you turn

319
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:38,605
Speaker 6:  around with one of these gr mills and catch one end of the cable,

320
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:43,005
Speaker 6:  pull it to the surface, attach it to a buoy, go back to the other

321
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:46,925
Speaker 6:  side, catch the other side of the cable, bring it to the surface, and

322
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:50,365
Speaker 6:  then you do the splicing. So you splice like a piece of spare cable to that

323
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:54,005
Speaker 6:  end, go back to the other side that's attached to the buoy, splice it to

324
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:57,085
Speaker 6:  that end, and then test it. And you should have a working cable that then

325
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:59,165
Speaker 6:  you have to lower back down to the ocean floor.

326
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:03,325
Speaker 2:  So it's basically like you're fishing for cables on the ocean

327
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,125
Speaker 2:  floor, right? Like how do they know if they've caught one?

328
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:10,245
Speaker 6:  That's exactly right. Like fishing based on just the, the

329
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:14,085
Speaker 6:  tug on the line. In this case, you have this enormous

330
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:17,925
Speaker 6:  metal hook that you're dragging along the ocean floor. And as that's

331
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:21,805
Speaker 6:  happening, someone is in the bridge watching this one

332
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:25,965
Speaker 6:  dial called the tension meter and watching it waver back

333
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:29,605
Speaker 6:  and forth. And one of the interesting things about it is it's an analog dial.

334
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:33,125
Speaker 6:  It's not an ultra precise digital readout because

335
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:38,085
Speaker 6:  you want that kind of fuzziness to, to, to be

336
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:41,805
Speaker 6:  able to judge intuitively what's happening is tension rising or falling

337
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:45,445
Speaker 6:  is a rising and falling fast or slow that you can't get from a bunch of numbers

338
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:49,405
Speaker 6:  jumping around. And so you're watching this dial, and if it's moving up

339
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:53,205
Speaker 6:  slowly kind of wavering, maybe you're going through some mud,

340
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:57,725
Speaker 6:  if it jerks up quickly, maybe you hit a rock and you, what

341
00:21:57,725 --> 00:22:01,565
Speaker 6:  you want is this slow increase, slow steady increase in intention

342
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:05,365
Speaker 6:  that shows you've hooked this cable and you're dragging it along the ocean

343
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,845
Speaker 6:  floor. And that's when you know it's time to reel in.

344
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:12,205
Speaker 2:  Interesting man, that's such a inexact science, but it, that's like you

345
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,885
Speaker 2:  just described like an art form more than a piece of sort of data analysis.

346
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:19,245
Speaker 6:  It really is one of the, one of the engineers I was talking to in Japan.

347
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:22,725
Speaker 6:  It's, it really is this act of kind of reading what's happening on the ocean

348
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:26,645
Speaker 6:  floor imagining based on this dial, you know, oh, I'm, I'm going,

349
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,565
Speaker 6:  I am going over a trench. I'm, I've hit a rock. That's

350
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:32,165
Speaker 2:  Wild. And how long does that process take?

351
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:36,645
Speaker 6:  Like days to weeks to to months, even if it's hard to find the cable?

352
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:40,285
Speaker 6:  Everything here is at just a massive scale. So like

353
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,565
Speaker 6:  if you're in deep water, the garden hose is several miles

354
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:48,685
Speaker 6:  down and just the act of like lowering it down to the ocean floor and hauling

355
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:52,325
Speaker 6:  it up can take, you know, nearly a day because it's so deep. And then

356
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:56,285
Speaker 6:  so each step of this process takes several days, splicing

357
00:22:56,305 --> 00:23:00,245
Speaker 6:  the cable takes about a day. It's just incredibly time consuming. And then,

358
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:04,165
Speaker 6:  so it's like If, you don't catch the cable on first try then, you know, several

359
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:08,125
Speaker 6:  more days to try again and it adds up pretty soon. You're like, you're

360
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:08,725
Speaker 6:  outta sea for weeks.

361
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:11,085
Speaker 2:  It just keeps reminding me of one of those movies where there's like, there's

362
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:14,605
Speaker 2:  the one shark that they're trying to catch and they're like, we, we think

363
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:17,125
Speaker 2:  we found it. It's over here. And then they go and they don't get it and it's

364
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,565
Speaker 2:  like, oh, okay, well we, we think we know where it'll be next. And it is

365
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:23,405
Speaker 2:  this like sort of perpetual cat and mouse game that you're playing with this

366
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:26,645
Speaker 2:  thing, trying to get it into your arms and then you can do something with

367
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:26,725
Speaker 2:  it.

368
00:23:26,995 --> 00:23:30,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's, it's remarkable how little visibility, you know, they have onto

369
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:33,365
Speaker 6:  the ocean floor and what's happening down there. Yeah. you know, there are

370
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:37,285
Speaker 6:  times when people are doing, you know, a dozen passes back and

371
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:40,565
Speaker 6:  forth being like, well that wasn't there, maybe it's a mile that way and

372
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:42,525
Speaker 6:  let's try over here. And that's,

373
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:46,085
Speaker 2:  That's nuts. Why don't we know better? This is one of the things I, I found

374
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:49,685
Speaker 2:  myself wondering, reading your story is I feel like I could make

375
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:54,085
Speaker 2:  a solid argument that the location of these cables should be like,

376
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:57,885
Speaker 2:  closely held state secrets that no one knows that

377
00:23:58,155 --> 00:24:00,965
Speaker 2:  because they're so important to the way that the world works that they should

378
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:04,685
Speaker 2:  be, you know, it should be like the, the bunkers where the

379
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:08,165
Speaker 2:  president goes. Like you just, it just should be all classified information

380
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:11,845
Speaker 2:  on the other side. I can imagine a world in which we should do much more

381
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:14,925
Speaker 2:  work to have much better knowledge of how these things work and where they

382
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:17,805
Speaker 2:  are and what's going on with them because they're so important and because

383
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:22,045
Speaker 2:  laying them and fixing them needs to happen so quickly. But it,

384
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:25,405
Speaker 2:  it seems like we're in sort of a weird middle between those two things. We're

385
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:27,565
Speaker 2:  like, we kind of know, but not really.

386
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:31,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a trade off. So you can go and you can see, tell

387
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,525
Speaker 6:  geography tracks, cables. You can see kind of broadly where they are in the

388
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:39,285
Speaker 6:  ocean. If you're like a sea captain, you

389
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:43,285
Speaker 6:  get charts that have cable areas marks, you know, with some degree

390
00:24:43,285 --> 00:24:47,045
Speaker 6:  of precision. And that makes a lot of sense because the biggest

391
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,605
Speaker 6:  actual threat to cables is someone accidentally dropping an anchor on them.

392
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:53,725
Speaker 6:  And so If, you are worried about an in attack and you make the most secret,

393
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:57,085
Speaker 6:  you're probably gonna increase the number of accidental cable breaks. On

394
00:24:57,085 --> 00:25:00,965
Speaker 6:  the other hand, they are vulnerable. It would be fairly,

395
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:04,165
Speaker 6:  you know, you don't need a low tech attack, you can just drag an anchor across

396
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:07,925
Speaker 6:  the ocean floor. In practice the network is redundant enough, you're still

397
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:11,525
Speaker 6:  talking about like a really small thing in a big ocean. So it's not quite

398
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:15,245
Speaker 6:  that easy to attack. It would take a pretty sophisticated antagonist to

399
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:19,845
Speaker 6:  actually cause a catastrophic cable outage. So, so far

400
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:23,485
Speaker 6:  it's been fine, but it is a topic of active debate, I think

401
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:27,005
Speaker 6:  in, in, in governments, what should we do? How should we protect these cables

402
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:28,125
Speaker 6:  that are, are so important

403
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:32,605
Speaker 2:  And for the people whose job it is to actually maintain them over

404
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:35,725
Speaker 2:  time, what is life like? You talk to a bunch of people who are sort of in

405
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:39,045
Speaker 2:  this industry and in some cases have been for a very long time. Right. What's

406
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:41,965
Speaker 2:  it like to be a sort of superhero keeping the internet running?

407
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:46,085
Speaker 6:  It's a very strange job. People, you know, when they join they

408
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:49,565
Speaker 6:  tend to kind of stumble into it. It's not a very well known

409
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:53,605
Speaker 6:  industry. And so you have people who are working as cable engineers in some

410
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:57,485
Speaker 6:  other area or you know, in Merchant Marines or, or something

411
00:25:57,485 --> 00:26:01,165
Speaker 6:  like that. Geologists in optics. And they sort of

412
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:05,045
Speaker 6:  stumble into it and you know, if they, if they stay for a bit,

413
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:08,325
Speaker 6:  they tend to stay for a long time, like decades, a lot of the work is earned

414
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:11,805
Speaker 6:  on, learned on the job. And so people tend to sort of move around between

415
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:15,765
Speaker 6:  different roles. But it's not an easy job. It's

416
00:26:15,765 --> 00:26:19,365
Speaker 6:  a weird lifestyle. You rotate in and off ships, you're often

417
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,725
Speaker 6:  far from home out of contact. you know, this is changing now

418
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,965
Speaker 6:  a bit with starlink, but like when you're on board one of these ships historically

419
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:31,525
Speaker 6:  you're pretty much cut off. You don't have great internet

420
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:35,365
Speaker 6:  connections. You can't stream things or, or FaceTime or anything

421
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:36,085
Speaker 6:  like that. You

422
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:38,885
Speaker 2:  Have the fast internet literally in your hands. You just can't do anything

423
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:39,125
Speaker 2:  with it.

424
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:43,005
Speaker 6:  Right, exactly. It's a difficult job. Just the lifestyle is hard,

425
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:46,685
Speaker 6:  but people come to love it because it takes you to very

426
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:50,765
Speaker 6:  unusual places. It's exciting and a lot of them have like

427
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:54,565
Speaker 6:  a real sense of purpose. They're maintaining this infrastructure that the

428
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:57,805
Speaker 6:  modern world runs on, even if no one actually knows about it or what they

429
00:26:57,805 --> 00:26:58,685
Speaker 6:  do. Knowing

430
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:02,365
Speaker 2:  You as I do, I'm, I'm confident that at some point in reporting this story,

431
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:06,805
Speaker 2:  you tried to live the cable maintenance life yourself and you were like,

432
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:10,125
Speaker 2:  yes, I will live the ship life. How close did you get?

433
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:14,725
Speaker 6:  Not that close. I did try, you know, when I first heard about this

434
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:18,565
Speaker 6:  industry, I was like, well, I should go on board for repair and was basically

435
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:22,205
Speaker 6:  laughed out of the room several times, you know, for various reasons. The

436
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:25,885
Speaker 6:  big one was security. It's a, it's a secretive industry. They just

437
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:29,645
Speaker 6:  can't have a journalist hanging out on a cable ship in most cases. And then

438
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,925
Speaker 6:  the other very compelling reason was that they don't know how long they'll

439
00:27:32,925 --> 00:27:36,565
Speaker 6:  be gone. So like, yeah, you can come along, but maybe we'll be gone for a

440
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:39,765
Speaker 6:  week or two and maybe we'll get called off to another repair and you'll be

441
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:43,725
Speaker 6:  at sea for months. Which is just, you know, hard to really plan around. That's

442
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:47,565
Speaker 2:  Fair. So were you, were you able to get any kind of firsthand glimpse into

443
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,085
Speaker 2:  this life?

444
00:27:48,555 --> 00:27:52,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I ended up going to Japan to talk

445
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:56,285
Speaker 6:  to people who work at KCS and going aboard the

446
00:27:56,285 --> 00:28:00,245
Speaker 6:  ocean link, which was the ship that repaired a lot of the cables

447
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:04,565
Speaker 6:  in Japan after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

448
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:08,965
Speaker 6:  And so it was in port for a period of time and I was able to go there and,

449
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:11,885
Speaker 6:  and visit the crew and, and get a tour of the ship. What

450
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:12,405
Speaker 2:  Was the ship like?

451
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:16,645
Speaker 6:  It was fairly big, like 400 foot long sort

452
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:20,605
Speaker 6:  of tall working ship. It's from the nineties, it's kind of

453
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:23,005
Speaker 6:  old at this point, but, well-maintained,

454
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:27,205
Speaker 2:  I'm imagining sort of a big fishing vessel, but instead of

455
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:31,125
Speaker 2:  like nets and containers, it just has a massive spool of cable

456
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:31,845
Speaker 2:  that's

457
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:35,805
Speaker 6:  Basically right. It essentially is a massive spool of cable. Like the

458
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:39,605
Speaker 6:  middle of it are these, I think three big empty

459
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:43,405
Speaker 6:  tanks that are just kind of spindles of wound spare cable. The interior

460
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:47,245
Speaker 6:  is really empty. It's kind of like a, it's built kind of like an aircraft

461
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:50,405
Speaker 6:  carrier or something where there's no sort of beams or, or struts or anything

462
00:28:50,555 --> 00:28:54,125
Speaker 6:  because it's all just, you have to string cable outta these tanks

463
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:58,165
Speaker 6:  to the workstation and then out to the front where there's kind of a rolling

464
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,645
Speaker 6:  pulley kind of thing where it goes over and into the ocean.

465
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:05,685
Speaker 2:  Got it. So it pulls it up and then you sort of spool from the middle boy.

466
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:07,045
Speaker 2:  It's what a complicated system.

467
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:10,445
Speaker 6:  It's counterintuitive how the, how the ship is put together and how it all

468
00:29:10,445 --> 00:29:13,525
Speaker 6:  works, but then makes sense. So it's, you're working with a material that

469
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:17,045
Speaker 6:  is thousands of miles long and it just creates all these weird logistical

470
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:17,485
Speaker 6:  problems.

471
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:21,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So you mentioned the, the Fukushima incident in 2011 in Japan,

472
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:25,885
Speaker 2:  which was a big part of the story that you wrote, kind of how they repaired

473
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:29,805
Speaker 2:  and the reaction to all of this. What was it about those repairs that was

474
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:33,205
Speaker 2:  sort of different? I feel like you, you found one of the hardest cases you

475
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,165
Speaker 2:  could have to tell this story about what happened in that case.

476
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:40,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so there are a few, there have been a few major, major cable

477
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:44,085
Speaker 6:  events. This was one of them. They tend to be earthquakes that caused the

478
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:47,965
Speaker 6:  most damage. So, so in this case there was this very, very large earthquake

479
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:51,525
Speaker 6:  off the coast of Japan. It sent a large tsunami that caused immense

480
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:55,645
Speaker 6:  devastation and part of that, that tsunami knocked out the

481
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:59,165
Speaker 6:  Fukushima nuclear reactor causing a nuclear meltdown. So you have this disaster

482
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:03,165
Speaker 6:  on top of a disaster and then you have the other disaster, which is not

483
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:07,005
Speaker 6:  really well known but happened at the same time, which is that the earthquake

484
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,885
Speaker 6:  caused all of these summering avalanches that wrecked

485
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:14,645
Speaker 6:  the majority of the cables Japan uses to connect to North America. Oh wow.

486
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:18,365
Speaker 6:  And the rest of the world. And so while the earthquake

487
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:22,285
Speaker 6:  tsunami recovery was happening, while Fukushima was, you know, people were

488
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:26,085
Speaker 6:  trying to bring Fukushima under control, the ship had to set

489
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:29,765
Speaker 6:  out and try to fix these cables as fast as possible while

490
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:32,405
Speaker 6:  contending with the fact that there may or may not be a cloud of radiation

491
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:33,765
Speaker 6:  over them. So

492
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:37,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean again, it just feels like so much of this process is just unknowns

493
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:40,725
Speaker 2:  on top of unknowns on top of unknowns. It's just going out and trying to

494
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:44,365
Speaker 2:  figure out, okay, something happened to these cables, we don't know what

495
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,805
Speaker 2:  or where or what it's gonna take or how we're gonna fix it.

496
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:51,205
Speaker 2:  And just bit by bit they just solve it.

497
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:55,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's really just, it's very methodical. Like you, like you've just

498
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:58,925
Speaker 6:  gotta kind of follow the steps and so they ki they, they looked at the

499
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:02,805
Speaker 6:  cable map, they figured out, okay, based on the timing of these faults, you

500
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:06,165
Speaker 6:  know, interestingly a lot of them happened hours after the tsunami. Like,

501
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:09,725
Speaker 6:  like that night basically you have these big debris flows that

502
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:13,005
Speaker 6:  sort of barrel down these canyons and, and ended up wrecking the cables.

503
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:17,285
Speaker 6:  And from the timing of the brakes, they figure out that's probably

504
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:21,045
Speaker 6:  what happens. The seabed is probably very transformed. They're gonna

505
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,765
Speaker 6:  need a lot of spare cable and typically you figure out,

506
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:27,885
Speaker 6:  you know, it's not usually up to the maintenance provider, which cables they

507
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:31,165
Speaker 6:  fix first. It's usually kind of first come first served from the cable owners,

508
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:35,125
Speaker 6:  whoever calls in their fault first. But in this case the cable owners are

509
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:38,925
Speaker 6:  like, you guys figure it out, like whatever, whatever cable you can

510
00:31:38,945 --> 00:31:42,885
Speaker 6:  fix, fix it. And so they settled on, you know, the one farthest

511
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:46,125
Speaker 6:  from Fukushima. 'cause the other thing is that normally in a big event like

512
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,045
Speaker 6:  this, other ships arrived to help, but there

513
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:53,045
Speaker 6:  was so little known about what was happening with Fukushima and no one felt

514
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:56,005
Speaker 6:  comfortable sending their crews into that. And so they were sort of the only

515
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:59,525
Speaker 6:  ones doing it for the first, the first period of time. So,

516
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:03,285
Speaker 2:  And then there was a moment in the Fukushima

517
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:07,365
Speaker 2:  response where they had pulled the cable up and then couldn't figure out

518
00:32:07,365 --> 00:32:10,925
Speaker 2:  what to do with it. Right. Am I what what happens here? You get the cable

519
00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:13,845
Speaker 2:  up above the ocean and then you have to figure out what to do. What did they

520
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:13,965
Speaker 2:  do?

521
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:18,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so this was the first repair. They hooked this cable and they

522
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:21,565
Speaker 6:  start reeling it in and it's under an unusual amount of tension.

523
00:32:21,945 --> 00:32:24,925
Speaker 6:  And basically what happens, you know, they, they start reeling in very, very

524
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:28,085
Speaker 6:  slowly because every cable has a certain amount of tension. You don't wanna

525
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:31,205
Speaker 6:  exceed it 'cause the cable could snap. And so they're just moving very, very

526
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:35,045
Speaker 6:  slowly and it takes them nearly a day to get it to the surface. Wow. And

527
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:38,925
Speaker 6:  what they learn when it gets there is that it's in just

528
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:42,925
Speaker 6:  been completely mangled. And, and what they think happened is some

529
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:47,085
Speaker 6:  enormous landslide happened. It dragged the cable, it buried it

530
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:50,565
Speaker 6:  under a bunch of debris. And now they've been slowly pulling it tighter and

531
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:54,525
Speaker 6:  tighter and tighter until it reaches the surface. Now they can see it,

532
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:58,125
Speaker 6:  it's on the front of the ship, it's on the, the four deck and it is

533
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:02,165
Speaker 6:  hooked around one bar with the grapnel and totally stripped and mangled

534
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:05,045
Speaker 6:  and under a huge amount of tension. And so you

535
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:08,965
Speaker 2:  Basically at this point have like a thousands of miles long bungee cord like

536
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:09,685
Speaker 2:  sitting on your boat.

537
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:13,565
Speaker 6:  Exactly, yes. Exactly. Attached to a heavy metal hook that if the

538
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:17,245
Speaker 6:  bungee cord snaps, which it's being strained, sort of each

539
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:21,365
Speaker 6:  wave and, and and swell, it will fly across the ship, kill anyone,

540
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:25,005
Speaker 6:  it hits smash into the cable control room, just do immense

541
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:28,685
Speaker 6:  damage. And so, but the priority becomes, you know, you can't repair a cable

542
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:31,565
Speaker 6:  under this kind of tension that's this damaged. They need to get it off the

543
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:34,605
Speaker 6:  ship. And so they do this sort of complicated

544
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:38,645
Speaker 6:  precarious procedure where they, they hook chains around each

545
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:42,565
Speaker 6:  side of the cable, swap the grapnel out for a bladed

546
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:46,765
Speaker 6:  grl, lower it back over the bow of the ship while they've evacuated the area.

547
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,205
Speaker 6:  And then once it's under the water, they release the chains, the cable is

548
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:53,925
Speaker 6:  cut and goes back to the bottom and, and they start over.

549
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:57,725
Speaker 2:  That feels like a really interesting test case. 'cause you know, like you

550
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:01,605
Speaker 2:  said, these cables go back a century, but 2011 is very much

551
00:34:01,715 --> 00:34:04,605
Speaker 2:  like the internet. And as we've learned, you know,

552
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:08,805
Speaker 2:  catastrophes happen, things like this happen all the time in lots of

553
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:11,645
Speaker 2:  places. That was a particularly bad one. But like earthquakes happen, we

554
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:15,365
Speaker 2:  just had one in New York. Like, these are things that happen. Did that, were

555
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:18,605
Speaker 2:  there any sort of lessons learned from that? Like do you, do you feel like

556
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:22,645
Speaker 2:  whatever, 13 years after that we're in a different era of

557
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:23,925
Speaker 2:  how we think about undersea cables?

558
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:27,765
Speaker 6:  Yes and no. I mean, it's interesting to look back on the coverage of 2011.

559
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:31,765
Speaker 6:  Like a lot of the, when the internet was mentioned, it was usually that,

560
00:34:31,865 --> 00:34:35,005
Speaker 6:  you know, this is remarkable. The internet fared remarkably well. It stayed

561
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:35,205
Speaker 6:  up.

562
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:38,565
Speaker 2:  Oh really? So for all the, for all the issues, the internet stayed up in

563
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:38,845
Speaker 2:  Japan.

564
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:42,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And, and so you have these reports and, and people were basically

565
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:46,525
Speaker 6:  just, you could only use the internet to communicate in the immediate aftermath.

566
00:34:46,525 --> 00:34:50,205
Speaker 6:  People were sending emails, they were tweeting, people were posting videos,

567
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:54,125
Speaker 6:  other telecommunications were cut out. Like the, the terrestrial cables were

568
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,085
Speaker 6:  cut, the cell towers were wrecked. And so they were really reliant on the

569
00:34:57,285 --> 00:35:00,845
Speaker 6:  internet. But you talk to the people who were at the operation centers and

570
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:04,965
Speaker 6:  on the ships and it was so much more precarious than people knew.

571
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:09,405
Speaker 6:  Basically they had succeeded in rerouting all the traffic over the

572
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:13,205
Speaker 6:  remaining cables. But if one of those cables had gone down, you

573
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:16,085
Speaker 6:  would've started to see a real degradation in service. You would've, you

574
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:19,085
Speaker 6:  know, things would've started to drop. It would've been difficult to communicate.

575
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:22,925
Speaker 6:  And so it was sort of right on the cusp of being a, a communications

576
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:26,765
Speaker 6:  disaster. And the lesson that the industry learned from that is,

577
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:30,845
Speaker 6:  is largely around redundancy. There's not like a real geographic

578
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:34,725
Speaker 6:  reason unlike the Red Sea or the Luon Strait or something.

579
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:38,765
Speaker 6:  There's not a geographic reason why all the cables were in one

580
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:42,645
Speaker 6:  place there. It was just sort of habit. Like we'd always put cables

581
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:45,205
Speaker 6:  there. Sure. And they always kind of landed at the spot. And so that makes

582
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:48,925
Speaker 6:  sense. And so you had this, these sort of choke points that then when a

583
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:52,485
Speaker 6:  landslide comes through, it wrecks a bunch of them and there's

584
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:56,765
Speaker 6:  more of an awareness that you need multiple landing points. But in practice

585
00:35:57,235 --> 00:36:00,405
Speaker 6:  that doesn't always happen because it's, you know, cheaper to follow known

586
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:01,445
Speaker 6:  routes or, or whatever.

587
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:05,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So where, where does it feel like this industry is right now? Obviously

588
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:09,045
Speaker 2:  it's as critical as ever, if not more so. Like the world relies on this

589
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:12,485
Speaker 2:  stuff more than we ever have. And I feel like purely anecdotally,

590
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:16,365
Speaker 2:  I've heard more about undersea cable projects

591
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:20,525
Speaker 2:  just in the last couple of years I feel like than I ever have. And

592
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:24,045
Speaker 2:  that might just be because I pay attention to companies like Google and Meta

593
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:27,885
Speaker 2:  and they're doing a lot of this stuff. But is there, is there energy in

594
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,645
Speaker 2:  this space to increase from, you know, 500 cables and

595
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:35,485
Speaker 2:  800,000 miles to, are we gonna have more than that or multiples of that

596
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:36,565
Speaker 2:  over time, do you think?

597
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:40,525
Speaker 6:  There we are in a cable boom right now. There's a lot of new cables going

598
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:44,165
Speaker 6:  in. Whether that means the net number of cables goes up is a

599
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:48,045
Speaker 6:  debate debated topic because the cables are also higher

600
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:51,845
Speaker 6:  and higher capacity. So some think maybe there'll be fewer

601
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:55,205
Speaker 6:  of cables, they'll just be really, really, really high bandwidth. But, but

602
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:59,165
Speaker 6:  there are a lot of new cables going in that's driven by the tech companies

603
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:03,125
Speaker 6:  pri primarily, which starting a couple years ago decided,

604
00:37:03,185 --> 00:37:06,845
Speaker 6:  you know, rather than purchase bandwidth on these cables, let's have our

605
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:10,205
Speaker 6:  own cables. And so they started laying their own systems

606
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,925
Speaker 6:  largely between their data centers. And the reason for that is that they

607
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:17,845
Speaker 6:  need a ton of capacity to kind of sync all of their data centers around

608
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:21,125
Speaker 6:  the world to keep these like huge content libraries up to keep their cloud

609
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:24,205
Speaker 6:  services running. And so they want to just kind of that all under their own

610
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:28,605
Speaker 6:  umbrella. But that hasn't really spilled over into the

611
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:31,685
Speaker 6:  maintenance side yet. It's mostly kind of the installation side. I

612
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:33,685
Speaker 2:  Was gonna say, are we still at, we're still at 22 ships.

613
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:38,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Still not a lot of new ships there. And, and you know, while the new

614
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,965
Speaker 6:  cables do provide a lot of redundancy, you also don't want, you know,

615
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:45,885
Speaker 6:  your handful of super high capacity cables to go down. 'cause it, it's

616
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:49,485
Speaker 6:  difficult to, to sort of move that track traffic over onto other routes.

617
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:53,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Did as you were talking to people, did you get a sense that there are

618
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:57,885
Speaker 2:  new kinds of threats to these cables too? Whether it's some of the ones

619
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:00,165
Speaker 2:  that have been there a long time getting old and not getting replaced quickly

620
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:04,125
Speaker 2:  enough or climate change or like the geopolitics of the internet, which

621
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,645
Speaker 2:  are becoming a bigger and bigger deal all the time. I, is there a sense that

622
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:11,765
Speaker 2:  this could get worse rather than better as we fight about

623
00:38:11,765 --> 00:38:12,525
Speaker 2:  undersea cables?

624
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:16,605
Speaker 6:  Geopolitics are the big thing. Climate change will make certain things harder.

625
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:20,605
Speaker 6:  All these cables all land on the coastline, which is eroding and

626
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:23,965
Speaker 6:  and sinking and that will be a problem. But part of the reason you're also

627
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:27,085
Speaker 6:  hearing more about cables is the geopolitics around them have become really

628
00:38:27,445 --> 00:38:30,485
Speaker 6:  sensitive. Largely that has been China

629
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:35,205
Speaker 6:  US conflict. You have the US saying we don't want Chinese

630
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:39,205
Speaker 6:  owned cables landing in the US and China

631
00:38:39,515 --> 00:38:43,405
Speaker 6:  also denying repair permits for the South China Sea or, or

632
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:47,365
Speaker 6:  sort of slowing them down and concerns about

633
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:51,285
Speaker 6:  routing cables through China's waters or into Hong

634
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:55,445
Speaker 6:  Kong has caused this kind of reconfiguration of

635
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:59,085
Speaker 6:  the, the network. You have alternate routes going through the Philippines

636
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:03,205
Speaker 6:  or a lot of cables landing in Singapore or China

637
00:39:03,205 --> 00:39:07,125
Speaker 6:  trying to build up its own cable maritime industry so that

638
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,165
Speaker 6:  it doesn't have to rely on, on, on the west. And these changes

639
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:15,005
Speaker 6:  are making it, it's not necessarily harder but very

640
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:18,285
Speaker 6:  different. It's just a period of change in the industry and and kind of one

641
00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:22,125
Speaker 6:  that is increasing, getting, increasing attention from, from

642
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,245
Speaker 6:  various governments that more governments are saying we need to control this

643
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:26,245
Speaker 6:  infrastructure in some way.

644
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:30,405
Speaker 2:  So, and as you talk to people in this small kind of under

645
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:34,445
Speaker 2:  talked about and under-resourced industry, is the sense that given

646
00:39:34,545 --> 00:39:38,285
Speaker 2:  all of that it is just change and this is stable and this is how we're gonna

647
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:41,685
Speaker 2:  keep doing things? Or did you, do you run into people who are like, screw

648
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:44,045
Speaker 2:  all of this, the answer is satellites and we have to get there as quickly

649
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:46,765
Speaker 2:  as we possibly can or like, is this just what it is and we have to figure

650
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:47,885
Speaker 2:  out how to do it better?

651
00:39:49,195 --> 00:39:52,925
Speaker 6:  There's a fair amount of concern I think about the long-term

652
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:56,805
Speaker 6:  sustainability of the industry. It can't all be satellites. That was the,

653
00:39:56,865 --> 00:40:00,485
Speaker 6:  the other thing that everyone reminded me of. Satellites

654
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:04,245
Speaker 6:  can carry like half a percent of the global traffic. It's, it's gonna be

655
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:07,685
Speaker 6:  cables, they're, they're just way more efficient and cheaper to

656
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:11,605
Speaker 6:  transmit data. There's a sense that they will have to navigate this. I think

657
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:15,205
Speaker 6:  the industry has been pretty stable for

658
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:19,085
Speaker 6:  decades and there's some anxiety about these changes. The

659
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:22,325
Speaker 6:  big tech companies coming in, governments taking a greater interest,

660
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:26,885
Speaker 6:  the sort of geopolitical jockeying around cable,

661
00:40:27,415 --> 00:40:31,165
Speaker 6:  cable routes that are just gonna be tricky. I think

662
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:35,525
Speaker 6:  a lot of the anxiety comes from kind of the market

663
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:39,485
Speaker 6:  forces involved. Like the big tech companies, they have so

664
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:43,205
Speaker 6:  much buying power, they can drive down prices and so they can negotiate lower

665
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:47,045
Speaker 6:  rates. And so well that means maintenance companies can

666
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:50,725
Speaker 6:  operate year to year and maybe it means they don't have enough to invest

667
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:54,485
Speaker 6:  in a new vessel. And so you have this kind of slow degradation, which also

668
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,685
Speaker 6:  means that they have trouble recruiting 'cause no one wants to join this

669
00:40:57,685 --> 00:40:59,325
Speaker 6:  sort of aging fleet. Sure,

670
00:40:59,515 --> 00:41:03,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Having done this whole process of, of reporting and

671
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:07,045
Speaker 2:  sort of understanding how this world works, has it changed the way you think

672
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:10,605
Speaker 2:  about the internet? Like I feel like the more I learn about the actual

673
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:14,085
Speaker 2:  infrastructure of the internet, the more remarkable it seems that any of

674
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:17,885
Speaker 2:  this ever actually works. And, and I feel like I got some of that sense

675
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:21,765
Speaker 2:  from your story that on the one hand this is this incredibly robust, incredibly

676
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:25,765
Speaker 2:  impressive group of people working on this thing that we understand

677
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:29,005
Speaker 2:  and have worked on for a long time. On the other hand, the internet is forever

678
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,645
Speaker 2:  like one wayward anchor away from falling apart.

679
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:35,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's really, it's one of these cases I feel like you hear about everybody

680
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:38,965
Speaker 6:  so often. Like the ways in which the internet is just sort of this

681
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:42,925
Speaker 6:  cobbled together apparatus is way less

682
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:43,605
Speaker 6:  stable

683
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,225
Speaker 1:  Welcome

684
00:45:09,465 --> 00:45:13,105
Speaker 2:  Back. A couple of weeks ago on the show we talked with the VIRs Tom Warren

685
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:17,065
Speaker 2:  about Microsoft's whole AI vision and specifically this idea

686
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:21,105
Speaker 2:  of AI. PCs still not really sure what that means, but Tom

687
00:45:21,105 --> 00:45:24,785
Speaker 2:  mentioned that Microsoft believes that a new generation of chips coming out

688
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:28,585
Speaker 2:  from Qualcomm might bring Windows PCs up to par

689
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:32,225
Speaker 2:  with Apple's latest max at least performance wise and that that might be

690
00:45:32,265 --> 00:45:36,105
Speaker 2:  a really big deal. Since then, Tom has been doing more reporting on all of

691
00:45:36,345 --> 00:45:40,025
Speaker 2:  Microsoft's plans and I haven't been able to stop thinking about what might

692
00:45:40,025 --> 00:45:43,865
Speaker 2:  happen if we really did get that kind of huge junk in

693
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:47,505
Speaker 2:  PC performance. So I asked him to come back on along with the verges laptop

694
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:50,905
Speaker 2:  reviewer, Joanna Nelius to talk about what's coming and what it might mean.

695
00:45:51,565 --> 00:45:52,225
Speaker 2:  Tom, hello.

696
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:53,505
Speaker 9:  Hello again.

697
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:54,905
Speaker 2:  Joanna welcome.

698
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:57,265
Speaker 9:  Hello. Excited to be here.

699
00:45:57,415 --> 00:46:00,865
Speaker 2:  This is gonna be great. Okay, so let's talk about laptop chips, the coolest

700
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:04,945
Speaker 2:  sexiest thing in technology, basically, Tom, you and I a couple weeks ago

701
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:08,545
Speaker 2:  yeah, talked about what Microsoft is up to with AI PCs and this idea that

702
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:12,425
Speaker 2:  like we're about to get this kind of massive uptick in the

703
00:46:12,425 --> 00:46:15,465
Speaker 2:  performance of laptops and everything is gonna be wonderful and solve all

704
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:18,225
Speaker 2:  of our problems forever. I wanna talk about what that actually means. So

705
00:46:18,405 --> 00:46:22,185
Speaker 2:  Joanna, you're a laptop reviewer, Tom, you, you cover all of our Microsoft

706
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:25,185
Speaker 2:  stuff and between us we're gonna figure out The future of Windows laptops.

707
00:46:25,345 --> 00:46:27,625
Speaker 2:  Does that sound good? Does this make sense? But somehow, we'll

708
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:30,065
Speaker 9:  Maybe, yeah, I gotta get my crystal ball. Hold on.

709
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:33,945
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we are once and for all going to decide what an AI PC is and we're

710
00:46:33,945 --> 00:46:36,985
Speaker 2:  gonna do the world a great service. But Joanna, I wanna start with you because

711
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:41,665
Speaker 2:  I feel like we have been talking about this idea of a

712
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:46,185
Speaker 2:  Qualcomm powered PC being sort of a new and different and

713
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:50,105
Speaker 2:  better thing for a long time and that has not really come

714
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:54,305
Speaker 2:  to pass. Is that fair? Like is this, am I the only one who has been dreaming

715
00:46:54,305 --> 00:46:55,345
Speaker 2:  about this for a very long time?

716
00:46:55,825 --> 00:46:59,545
Speaker 9:  I mean, no, I think that's really fair to say.

717
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:03,825
Speaker 9:  Now it kind of looks like it may actually come to pass.

718
00:47:04,205 --> 00:47:07,545
Speaker 9:  The jury is still out on whether or not it's going to

719
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:11,905
Speaker 9:  overtake let's say Apple M chips or anything

720
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:15,345
Speaker 9:  else. But kind of based on like what I've been reading and what I've seen.

721
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:19,585
Speaker 9:  I think it will compete very heavily with

722
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:23,345
Speaker 9:  everything else that is in the space. I don't think it's gonna be

723
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:27,345
Speaker 9:  like, yes, this is not the best thing ever. I think it's nice that we're

724
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,965
Speaker 9:  going to get another viable option and further

725
00:47:31,275 --> 00:47:35,085
Speaker 9:  just kind of differentiate what actual chips are in the

726
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:38,725
Speaker 9:  systems that that we use and perhaps our

727
00:47:38,745 --> 00:47:42,645
Speaker 9:  future purchasing decisions will be based on what we actually

728
00:47:42,645 --> 00:47:46,125
Speaker 9:  need the laptop for and what Chip is in it, rather than just getting like

729
00:47:46,345 --> 00:47:48,605
Speaker 9:  an X 86 chip in everything.

730
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:49,285
Speaker 2:  Right.

731
00:47:49,385 --> 00:47:49,805
Speaker 9:  So yeah,

732
00:47:49,945 --> 00:47:52,605
Speaker 2:  So that's actually a good way to think about this, right? And I think even

733
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:56,005
Speaker 2:  just backing up a few years, like explain sort of the difference in even

734
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:59,165
Speaker 2:  like the promise between the two. 'cause I feel like there's the kind of

735
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:03,125
Speaker 2:  Intel X 86 world and then Qualcomm has been trying to carve out

736
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:07,125
Speaker 2:  a different kind of computer for a while now. Like how

737
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,685
Speaker 2:  would you frame the differences between the two?

738
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:12,925
Speaker 9:  Oh goodness. I think for that, like I think we gotta look

739
00:48:12,945 --> 00:48:16,725
Speaker 9:  at Intel A MD Apple and now Qualcomm because

740
00:48:16,755 --> 00:48:20,605
Speaker 9:  they're all doing different things with X 86 and

741
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:24,805
Speaker 9:  arm architecture. So Intel X 86, but it

742
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:28,365
Speaker 9:  has the big little core difference. The performance cores and

743
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:32,245
Speaker 9:  efficiency cores. Apple does the same thing, but on arm

744
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:35,885
Speaker 9:  A MD it's just traditional X 86, it's, it's fine.

745
00:48:36,285 --> 00:48:40,005
Speaker 9:  Qualcomm is on arm but it doesn't have the big little arc

746
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,525
Speaker 9:  architecture. Right. And I think

747
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:47,325
Speaker 9:  what's really kind of exciting and cool about all those

748
00:48:47,475 --> 00:48:51,365
Speaker 9:  differences is that because we have been able to

749
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:55,125
Speaker 9:  shriek the transistor sizes on the actual ships so

750
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:59,125
Speaker 9:  small, the historical sort of

751
00:48:59,425 --> 00:49:03,045
Speaker 9:  issues that came with either clock

752
00:49:03,135 --> 00:49:06,165
Speaker 9:  based instruction sets or what is it,

753
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:10,245
Speaker 9:  RISC versus C-I-S-C-X

754
00:49:10,245 --> 00:49:13,725
Speaker 9:  86 has always been more hard hardware based. So

755
00:49:14,075 --> 00:49:18,005
Speaker 9:  with the drive into AI and you know, Moore's law kind

756
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:21,285
Speaker 9:  of hanging in the balance, I think like there comes this

757
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:25,645
Speaker 9:  question of, well if we want our chips to handle these AI workloads,

758
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:29,405
Speaker 9:  right, we gotta move into an architecture that's more software based rather

759
00:49:29,555 --> 00:49:33,405
Speaker 9:  than hardware. And also I think it could potentially

760
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:37,085
Speaker 9:  maybe lower prices a little bit. Like you can get,

761
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:41,285
Speaker 9:  you know, like I hate, I hate to use the term but word bang for your

762
00:49:41,285 --> 00:49:45,165
Speaker 9:  buck from like, you know, an arm architecture. But like all these

763
00:49:45,305 --> 00:49:49,085
Speaker 9:  AI models like still needs something that's really, really

764
00:49:49,115 --> 00:49:52,725
Speaker 9:  fast in order to be able to run them. So

765
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:56,925
Speaker 9:  I think Qualcomm's approach is very interesting in that aspect 'cause it

766
00:49:56,925 --> 00:50:00,885
Speaker 9:  has a long history in the mobile space of kind of doing

767
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:04,765
Speaker 9:  the same thing. So maybe it's

768
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:08,485
Speaker 9:  gonna be, you know, great right, right out the gate. But if you're still

769
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:12,325
Speaker 9:  sticking on the X 86 platform, I don't know how much longevity

770
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:16,645
Speaker 9:  that is going to have with Moore's Law and everything else since it's a

771
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:20,205
Speaker 9:  hard, a hard hardware based system. So that's my my very

772
00:50:20,295 --> 00:50:21,525
Speaker 9:  nerdy answer. So

773
00:50:21,705 --> 00:50:25,685
Speaker 2:  No, it's a good one. And Tom, I feel like Microsoft specifically

774
00:50:25,745 --> 00:50:29,675
Speaker 2:  has tried harder to make this work than just about anybody. Yeah, and

775
00:50:29,675 --> 00:50:32,675
Speaker 2:  it's possible I, that might be my own bias. 'cause like I, I find the surface

776
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:36,275
Speaker 2:  line fascinating. So maybe this is a bigger windows push than I'm realizing,

777
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:39,875
Speaker 2:  but I feel like for way too many years now, Microsoft has been like,

778
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:43,995
Speaker 2:  Qualcomm chips in surfaces, it's gonna be sick. You're gonna love it. Yeah,

779
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:44,995
Speaker 2:  everything's gonna be great.

780
00:50:45,435 --> 00:50:46,395
Speaker 10:  I have that turn out and

781
00:50:46,395 --> 00:50:48,875
Speaker 2:  It's just a lie. Like why is Microsoft so invested in this?

782
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:51,835
Speaker 10:  Well because it's the way that the industry's heading, right? Apple has

783
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:55,835
Speaker 10:  pioneered with their own silicon like a, a transition like we haven't

784
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:59,715
Speaker 10:  really seen before and they, they did it without emulation, right? So that

785
00:50:59,715 --> 00:51:03,115
Speaker 10:  they did it by translating those instruction sets. So

786
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:06,835
Speaker 10:  essentially translating the way that app works. So you tell it to do one

787
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:10,315
Speaker 10:  thing and use one piece of hardware and it Rosetta, which is Apple's thing,

788
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:14,315
Speaker 10:  translates that and, and makes it run natively on,

789
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:18,275
Speaker 10:  on that particular CPU. So might as well tried this emulation

790
00:51:18,365 --> 00:51:22,155
Speaker 10:  stuff about a decade ago with Windows RT and Surface

791
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:25,995
Speaker 10:  rt. you know, there's that first, the first iteration of Surface was, oh

792
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:26,755
Speaker 2:  Wow. I remember that one

793
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:30,355
Speaker 10:  Was an arm push, right? That didn't really work out. It was very slow. There

794
00:51:30,355 --> 00:51:33,955
Speaker 10:  wasn't enough apps. There was this confusing desktop interface. It was just

795
00:51:33,975 --> 00:51:37,195
Speaker 10:  all, yeah, it was just a bit of a messy transition really, because they,

796
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:40,995
Speaker 10:  they tried to go this, like Steven Sinofsky was in charge of Windows and

797
00:51:41,095 --> 00:51:44,675
Speaker 10:  he really saw the vision of the iPad, the full screen apps, and really wanted

798
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:48,355
Speaker 10:  to impress that on Windows. That didn't really work out. So then they kind

799
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,075
Speaker 10:  of went to Qualcomm with their tail between their legs essentially and

800
00:51:52,215 --> 00:51:56,195
Speaker 10:  teamed up with them to, as an exclusive partner, to then do Windows 11

801
00:51:56,215 --> 00:52:00,115
Speaker 10:  and Windows 10 sort of on arm stuff. It's better than those,

802
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:03,515
Speaker 10:  the dark days of Windows RT in that, that confusing mess.

803
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:08,395
Speaker 10:  But it's still not quite there because the, the Qualcomm chips just have,

804
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:11,795
Speaker 10:  haven't really delivered the sort of performance and like obviously I wrote

805
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,275
Speaker 10:  about internally at Microsoft, they're thinking these latest chips, these

806
00:52:15,325 --> 00:52:18,995
Speaker 10:  Snapdragon X Elite will sort of bridge that gap of performance.

807
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:23,195
Speaker 10:  But the key thing I think will be the thing that Apple's really nailed is

808
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:26,635
Speaker 10:  the performance per what and the efficiencies there. And that's really important

809
00:52:26,635 --> 00:52:29,795
Speaker 10:  because you, you, you get really good performance, but it's not hitting

810
00:52:29,795 --> 00:52:32,275
Speaker 10:  your battery life. So you don't have like, you know, a five hour battery

811
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:36,155
Speaker 10:  life you'll get all day Battery life is, is what they're saying. But

812
00:52:36,305 --> 00:52:40,195
Speaker 10:  what that translates into, but if they can get close to like the M

813
00:52:40,195 --> 00:52:43,835
Speaker 10:  three battery life and performance, then it's gonna be pretty interesting

814
00:52:44,225 --> 00:52:47,875
Speaker 10:  time for Windows on arm. Especially as there's, there's like rumors of

815
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:52,235
Speaker 10:  cheaper variants of the X Elite. So story loss week, like x

816
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,755
Speaker 10:  plus or something like that. So that could also open it up to

817
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:59,875
Speaker 10:  more and more laptops. 'cause these have been pretty high priced items

818
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:00,475
Speaker 10:  so far.

819
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:04,715
Speaker 2:  It is very important that if you're going to, you know, copy apple's

820
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:07,755
Speaker 2:  silicon strategy, you have to have a series of very confusing names that

821
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:10,795
Speaker 2:  don't actually make any sense to anyone in terms of buying their chips. So

822
00:53:10,795 --> 00:53:13,355
Speaker 2:  I'm glad to hear that Qualcomm is just gonna name everything a bunch of words

823
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:17,315
Speaker 2:  that don't make any sense. But it seems to me like I personally, the

824
00:53:17,315 --> 00:53:20,995
Speaker 2:  reason I have always kind of rooted for the Windows on Arm thing to

825
00:53:21,025 --> 00:53:24,635
Speaker 2:  work is that it feels like there was this dream we were promised,

826
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:28,845
Speaker 2:  maybe not all the way back to the Surface rt, but almost that far back

827
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:32,685
Speaker 2:  of like a very thin Yeah. Always connected with

828
00:53:33,365 --> 00:53:37,325
Speaker 2:  the cellular connection that you get with Qualcomm stuff, right? Laptop slash

829
00:53:37,345 --> 00:53:40,885
Speaker 2:  tablet that is more portable and lasts forever. Like I, I feel like it was

830
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:44,165
Speaker 2:  years ago that they were promising like 24 hours of battery life outta some

831
00:53:44,165 --> 00:53:47,365
Speaker 2:  of these things. And it's like, well sure it lasts forever. It will, it will

832
00:53:47,385 --> 00:53:50,805
Speaker 2:  do one thing in the 24 hours that it lasts because the performance sucks.

833
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:55,045
Speaker 2:  But Joanna like that sort of triumvirate of like power battery

834
00:53:55,075 --> 00:53:58,765
Speaker 2:  life and connectivity feels like it kind of doesn't exist in the Windows

835
00:53:58,855 --> 00:54:02,805
Speaker 2:  world right now. Right? Like, is it, am I giving, am I not

836
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:03,525
Speaker 2:  giving it enough credit?

837
00:54:04,795 --> 00:54:08,645
Speaker 9:  Like it's gotten a lot better. Okay. Like for sure the last maybe

838
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:12,045
Speaker 9:  like five years or so, maybe four,

839
00:54:12,555 --> 00:54:16,285
Speaker 9:  like there's been a greater focus on power efficiency

840
00:54:16,705 --> 00:54:20,405
Speaker 9:  one. I think to Tom's point, like it's very much being driven

841
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:24,565
Speaker 9:  by Apple when they brought the their M chip to market,

842
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:28,605
Speaker 9:  you know, then it was like, oh, now it's game on. Like we really

843
00:54:28,605 --> 00:54:32,405
Speaker 9:  gotta do this. And then there's sort of like the broader scope

844
00:54:32,465 --> 00:54:36,285
Speaker 9:  of like being eco-conscious and conserving energy

845
00:54:36,665 --> 00:54:39,725
Speaker 9:  and everything else. That's kind of also falling into it,

846
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:44,045
Speaker 9:  especially with a lot of news reports that come out and they talk about

847
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:47,325
Speaker 9:  like how much power, like data centers just

848
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,845
Speaker 9:  suck up. Sure. And how much power is needed to run like

849
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:56,405
Speaker 9:  AI processes in the cloud, right? So what

850
00:54:56,405 --> 00:55:00,325
Speaker 9:  we're already kind of seeing is that companies are starting

851
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:04,085
Speaker 9:  to rethink like, okay, well we need to like give people

852
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:08,205
Speaker 9:  the ability to, you know, like run AI models like on their

853
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:11,565
Speaker 9:  local device. Right? 'cause that's what's going

854
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:15,765
Speaker 9:  to give more longevity to what, to what it is

855
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:17,965
Speaker 9:  that they're trying to do.

856
00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:22,245
Speaker 2:  I confess as we've been talking about this, Tom, and in your piece you wrote

857
00:55:22,245 --> 00:55:26,165
Speaker 2:  basically that Microsoft feels very confident that it's new line of devices

858
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:30,445
Speaker 2:  with the Snapdragon stuff is going to match the M three on

859
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:33,365
Speaker 2:  performance. Yeah. Match or exceed, right. That they feel good that it's

860
00:55:33,365 --> 00:55:37,205
Speaker 2:  going to be a real competitor. My immediate reaction is like, cool,

861
00:55:37,545 --> 00:55:41,085
Speaker 2:  that's actually not the thing I care the most about in my laptop.

862
00:55:41,275 --> 00:55:44,685
Speaker 2:  Like If, you could give me something that ran Windows and got

863
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:48,805
Speaker 2:  85% of the m three's performance and 105% of its

864
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:51,085
Speaker 2:  battery life. Like I'd rather have that. Yeah. Personally.

865
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:52,085
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I think we

866
00:55:52,085 --> 00:55:54,845
Speaker 2:  All would. But I also like Joanna, your point is really interesting that

867
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:58,765
Speaker 2:  like maybe what we're actually heading towards is a gigantic

868
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:02,165
Speaker 2:  leap in the performance we ask of our laptops if we're gonna start running

869
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:05,725
Speaker 2:  these local AI models. Yeah. If this idea of an AI PC is going to become

870
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:09,405
Speaker 2:  true, then like I I, I sincerely believe that it's been a

871
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:12,965
Speaker 2:  decade since most people were running up against the performance limits of

872
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:16,605
Speaker 2:  their computer. Yeah. But maybe we're headed back towards that

873
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:20,165
Speaker 2:  and Tom, maybe that's why Microsoft cares so much about this at this particular

874
00:56:20,165 --> 00:56:20,405
Speaker 2:  moment.

875
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:24,845
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Like it is, it's interesting the way that they're, they're thinking

876
00:56:24,845 --> 00:56:28,165
Speaker 10:  about it internally because it, it's, it's, it's a battle between Qualcomm

877
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:32,045
Speaker 10:  and, and and Intel for, for all this sort of AI processing. And Microsoft

878
00:56:32,045 --> 00:56:35,645
Speaker 10:  shipped a laptop last year, the Surface laptop studio

879
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:39,805
Speaker 10:  too. That one had like some really custom NPU from Intel

880
00:56:40,445 --> 00:56:43,925
Speaker 10:  'cause they hadn't obviously put it on the, on the, on the, the main core

881
00:56:43,975 --> 00:56:47,965
Speaker 10:  ultra chips that they've started shipping. But even, even that one is not

882
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:51,765
Speaker 10:  very powerful. Like it can do the sort of basic background noise

883
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:55,605
Speaker 10:  removal stuff that's integrated into Windows. What I found

884
00:56:55,885 --> 00:56:58,325
Speaker 10:  fascinating about that push was that they didn't really explain what the

885
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:02,245
Speaker 10:  NPUs really there for beyond that. And I think that's the key thing that

886
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:06,125
Speaker 10:  I wanna see in May at this Microsoft event is like, what is

887
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:09,805
Speaker 10:  the NPU actually gonna be used for for these local tasks? Like they're obviously

888
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:13,085
Speaker 10:  gonna have their own Windows features, but I'm more curious how devs will

889
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:16,965
Speaker 10:  be able to like leverage this and software and stuff. And speaking to

890
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,925
Speaker 10:  Intel, they, they, they did some, some recent stuff with

891
00:57:20,925 --> 00:57:23,845
Speaker 10:  some software developers where it can scam malware local on your machine

892
00:57:23,845 --> 00:57:26,765
Speaker 10:  so it doesn't take up your CPU, which is, yeah, I mean that that sort of

893
00:57:26,765 --> 00:57:29,805
Speaker 10:  stuff's kind of interesting. If, you can offload that, but then what else

894
00:57:29,805 --> 00:57:33,645
Speaker 10:  do you offload? Like how much is too much and Yeah. Like it's,

895
00:57:33,645 --> 00:57:37,325
Speaker 10:  it's gonna be interesting to see how that that works. Exactly. But I think

896
00:57:37,325 --> 00:57:41,165
Speaker 10:  more interestingly, the way they count this is by T

897
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:45,245
Speaker 10:  ops or tops or however you wanna, you wanna say tops. Yeah. Yeah. And

898
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:49,005
Speaker 10:  I think the Intel one, the Intel core ones that they call themselves

899
00:57:49,025 --> 00:57:53,005
Speaker 10:  as a I PCs are like 10 of that unit. And the ones in

900
00:57:53,005 --> 00:57:56,685
Speaker 10:  the Snapdragon X Elite and stuff are like 40. So a Forex

901
00:57:56,865 --> 00:58:00,605
Speaker 10:  Oh wow. Yeah. Like a, a four times bump on that. And then the next gen ones

902
00:58:00,605 --> 00:58:04,565
Speaker 10:  after that are obviously gonna be even more so, so they're actually Microsoft

903
00:58:04,845 --> 00:58:08,245
Speaker 10:  actually calling the Qualcomm snapdragon ex elite

904
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:11,965
Speaker 10:  laptops that are coming next Gen co-pilot PCs.

905
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:14,965
Speaker 10:  So that's quite a, that's where they're thinking is right? Because they're

906
00:58:14,965 --> 00:58:18,525
Speaker 10:  obviously, they don't wanna come out and say Intel's core ultra ones just

907
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:22,405
Speaker 10:  aren't gonna cut it. But they obviously don't have quite the same performance

908
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:26,485
Speaker 10:  of, of, for the AI tasks as, as the upcoming Qualcomm stuff. Which makes

909
00:58:26,485 --> 00:58:29,685
Speaker 10:  sense. 'cause it's, it's not on native. So, and Qualcomm's been doing the

910
00:58:29,765 --> 00:58:33,645
Speaker 10:  NPU stuff for, well, for, for years, so for quite some time.

911
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:37,085
Speaker 10:  But I think that's gonna be an interesting battle about where do they offload

912
00:58:37,085 --> 00:58:40,885
Speaker 10:  this local AI stuff rather than push the, the copilot cloud

913
00:58:40,895 --> 00:58:44,565
Speaker 10:  stuff. The previous aspects, like we spoke about the AI Explorer stuff,

914
00:58:44,575 --> 00:58:48,445
Speaker 10:  where it's essentially gonna be a timeline feature on your PC where you

915
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:52,205
Speaker 10:  can just say to it, what was I doing last week when I was searching

916
00:58:52,225 --> 00:58:55,805
Speaker 10:  for hotels? Like what tabs did I have? And it'll be like, here's all your

917
00:58:55,835 --> 00:58:59,565
Speaker 10:  tabs. So, and it it, it speaks to sort of like some of the way

918
00:58:59,565 --> 00:59:02,925
Speaker 10:  that we're seeing AI more broadly in devices like you

919
00:59:03,395 --> 00:59:06,885
Speaker 10:  view the humane, the AI pin, right? Like tho those sort of devices that

920
00:59:07,605 --> 00:59:11,445
Speaker 10:  leverage local compute or go to the cloud for queries that

921
00:59:11,445 --> 00:59:15,325
Speaker 10:  hybrid mix or however these companies approach that. And when they get

922
00:59:15,325 --> 00:59:18,605
Speaker 10:  more powerful, it's gonna be super interesting to see how like Windows changes

923
00:59:18,865 --> 00:59:22,325
Speaker 10:  in a, in a world where there's devices that are suddenly doing a bunch of

924
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:25,885
Speaker 10:  stuff that you normally would've picked up a mouse and keyboard to do, but

925
00:59:25,885 --> 00:59:28,685
Speaker 10:  you can just use your voice with and it's always been that promise, right?

926
00:59:28,685 --> 00:59:31,285
Speaker 10:  Right. Like, and it's never, it's never really got there, but it does feel

927
00:59:31,285 --> 00:59:34,165
Speaker 10:  like we're on the, on the edge of that potentially happening.

928
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:38,365
Speaker 2:  Well, but at the same time we're in this like in impossible moment

929
00:59:39,025 --> 00:59:42,805
Speaker 2:  for kind of all computing. But I think Windows hits this maybe harder than

930
00:59:42,805 --> 00:59:46,365
Speaker 2:  anybody is, the Windows challenge has always been that there are a lot of

931
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:49,005
Speaker 2:  people who wanna do new stuff on Windows and you can give people new stuff

932
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:51,965
Speaker 2:  on Windows, but there are a lot of people who do stuff that hasn't been updated

933
00:59:51,975 --> 00:59:55,965
Speaker 2:  since 2001. Yeah. And they need it to work on their computer. And I

934
00:59:55,965 --> 00:59:59,125
Speaker 2:  think this is where you're talking about, you know, the Qualcomm stuff and

935
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:01,485
Speaker 2:  the Windows Unarm stuff that has been challenging over the years is it's,

936
01:00:01,705 --> 01:00:05,245
Speaker 2:  you can make the computer run and even If you make the computer run, making

937
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:09,005
Speaker 2:  the old apps that people need to do their jobs is a whole separate

938
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:12,725
Speaker 2:  problem. Yeah. And I, I feel like now you're gonna

939
01:00:12,965 --> 01:00:16,525
Speaker 2:  tack on all this AI stuff and it's like, okay, if we were to just tear it

940
01:00:16,685 --> 01:00:20,245
Speaker 2:  all down, start over and build PCs made for

941
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:24,525
Speaker 2:  the AI stuff that you're talking about, that's one problem to do that

942
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:28,885
Speaker 2:  that also runs the weird accounting software that no one

943
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,405
Speaker 2:  has thought about in 20 years, but is crucial to how I do my business. Strikes

944
01:00:32,405 --> 01:00:36,045
Speaker 2:  me as a whole nother can of worms. And like

945
01:00:36,585 --> 01:00:39,125
Speaker 2:  Joanna, you, you've been covering this stuff for a long time. Like Yeah.

946
01:00:39,225 --> 01:00:42,725
Speaker 2:  Is that a Bridgeable gap? Like I, I'm sort of, I think the thing we've been

947
01:00:42,725 --> 01:00:46,045
Speaker 2:  burned about with all of this stuff on Windows for years is that it is possible

948
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:48,525
Speaker 2:  to do all of those things at the same time. And I still am skeptical.

949
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,485
Speaker 9:  The issue we're running into is not like

950
01:00:52,475 --> 01:00:55,845
Speaker 9:  necessarily like speed or anything like that,

951
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:59,885
Speaker 9:  it's use cases. Hmm. Right. So if we like

952
01:00:59,985 --> 01:01:03,565
Speaker 9:  go back way in history when Apple was trying to design,

953
01:01:03,755 --> 01:01:07,365
Speaker 9:  it's like first, what was it? The power pc, but

954
01:01:07,565 --> 01:01:11,085
Speaker 9:  they were trying to do an arm PC like decades

955
01:01:11,425 --> 01:01:14,925
Speaker 9:  ago. Right? But the reason why it never caught on then was because

956
01:01:15,815 --> 01:01:19,285
Speaker 9:  developers didn't wanna port their stuff over. Right. And it was so much

957
01:01:19,285 --> 01:01:23,245
Speaker 9:  harder to do that back then because of the speed

958
01:01:23,355 --> 01:01:27,285
Speaker 9:  limitations of both architectures, right. Not to mention

959
01:01:27,905 --> 01:01:31,885
Speaker 9:  ARM with its different instructions set relied on more

960
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:35,805
Speaker 9:  lines of code. And it also relied on a lot more ram

961
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:39,645
Speaker 9:  to be able to do all, all of that stuff. Now

962
01:01:40,025 --> 01:01:44,005
Speaker 9:  the industry is like caught up with itself and hence why Apple

963
01:01:44,005 --> 01:01:47,925
Speaker 9:  came out with its with its MM chips now I feel like we're

964
01:01:47,925 --> 01:01:50,925
Speaker 9:  kind of seeing more of the same, we got these

965
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:55,685
Speaker 9:  AI chips with their neuro processing units in it

966
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:59,485
Speaker 9:  that can do a variety of things at varying

967
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:03,525
Speaker 9:  speeds. Right? But it's like the use cases that, that

968
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:07,205
Speaker 9:  I'm seeing, for instance, like generating music

969
01:02:07,635 --> 01:02:11,205
Speaker 9:  from a text prompt. Like okay, that's cool.

970
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:15,685
Speaker 9:  Like an actual, like musician isn't gonna go and do that most likely.

971
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,805
Speaker 9:  So who's, who's it for? Like, and I think all these

972
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:23,965
Speaker 9:  like generative AI stuff, we're still trying to

973
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:27,725
Speaker 9:  figure that out. So there seems to be a, a mismatch

974
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:31,485
Speaker 9:  between what the tech industry wants to do and

975
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,725
Speaker 9:  what laptop users basically want their laptops to do.

976
01:02:35,905 --> 01:02:36,125
Speaker 9:  So

977
01:02:36,835 --> 01:02:40,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I I do think we are, we are due for a bunch of years of there

978
01:02:40,645 --> 01:02:44,325
Speaker 2:  being all of this really interesting new horsepower

979
01:02:44,425 --> 01:02:47,605
Speaker 2:  on these computers and a lot of people being like, what are we gonna do with

980
01:02:47,605 --> 01:02:50,565
Speaker 2:  this? Yeah. But then, like Tom, to your point about background noise removal,

981
01:02:50,565 --> 01:02:53,565
Speaker 2:  like that is the sort of thing that you can just sort of offload off of your

982
01:02:53,885 --> 01:02:57,205
Speaker 2:  computer onto this other Chip that you never really have to think about it.

983
01:02:57,205 --> 01:03:00,045
Speaker 2:  That just like instantly makes your computing life better. And if we can

984
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:02,685
Speaker 2:  find a bunch of those, like I suddenly get very excited about The future

985
01:03:02,685 --> 01:03:06,565
Speaker 2:  of laptops. Yeah. And I get the sense Microsoft is heading down that

986
01:03:06,715 --> 01:03:09,565
Speaker 2:  road with Windows kind of as fast as it possibly can.

987
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:13,285
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it seems like it. And it, it, it's also interesting the way that they're

988
01:03:13,285 --> 01:03:16,725
Speaker 10:  potentially positioning their arms surface devices

989
01:03:17,225 --> 01:03:21,125
Speaker 10:  for consumers and the Intel ones for, for businesses that kind

990
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:24,565
Speaker 10:  of suggests for the first time that they, they are, they are thinking about

991
01:03:24,565 --> 01:03:27,205
Speaker 10:  like, like you were talking about previously, the the, the legacy of these

992
01:03:27,765 --> 01:03:30,285
Speaker 10:  support, these applications and stuff. They, they're starting to think of

993
01:03:30,285 --> 01:03:33,725
Speaker 10:  that as a consumer versus business thing. 'cause obviously predominantly

994
01:03:33,965 --> 01:03:36,965
Speaker 10:  businesses need that legacy support and it's great, right? You can still

995
01:03:36,965 --> 01:03:40,685
Speaker 10:  run like a, a MS DOS application or a game from like the

996
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:44,565
Speaker 10:  nineties like on your pc. It just opens, it works great. Like

997
01:03:46,025 --> 01:03:49,125
Speaker 10:  of any company that that builds software, Microsoft has always done a very

998
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,565
Speaker 10:  good job of supporting that and that's probably one of their, their greatest

999
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:56,645
Speaker 10:  traits of even on the export side as well. But yeah, like it, it does seem

1000
01:03:56,645 --> 01:04:00,525
Speaker 10:  like they are starting to think how do we split that up? And the

1001
01:04:00,525 --> 01:04:03,205
Speaker 10:  last time they did that was obviously Windows eight. So which

1002
01:04:03,205 --> 01:04:04,445
Speaker 2:  Went super well. No,

1003
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:05,805
Speaker 9:  No. Windows eight

1004
01:04:06,285 --> 01:04:09,565
Speaker 10:  Actually don't think too drastic. But, but are they gonna

1005
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:13,725
Speaker 10:  redesign Windows for an era of ai? Like at the moment they've just

1006
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:17,445
Speaker 10:  shoved a copilot chatbot into Windows 11, which doesn't, not much

1007
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:20,565
Speaker 10:  ambition there, right? Like that's, that's not as ambitious as I'd expect

1008
01:04:20,645 --> 01:04:24,485
Speaker 10:  'em to be. Maybe AI explorer is kind of a more of a hint to okay,

1009
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:27,885
Speaker 10:  how AI could really change how you actually use your pc.

1010
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:32,325
Speaker 10:  'cause you've literally been able to type into a prompt and bringing up

1011
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:36,085
Speaker 10:  your search history or whatever you've used on your PC is kind of wild.

1012
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:39,805
Speaker 10:  If that works in, in reality and that could Yeah, like where,

1013
01:04:39,805 --> 01:04:43,325
Speaker 10:  where they change the design of Windows and apps in The future

1014
01:04:43,735 --> 01:04:46,405
Speaker 10:  would shift pretty big if, if they can leverage it. Well

1015
01:04:46,865 --> 01:04:50,725
Speaker 9:  At least for me in, in an ideal world, I just wanna talk

1016
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:54,085
Speaker 9:  to my AI chat bot. Like I don't wanna type to it, right?

1017
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:58,565
Speaker 9:  And it's an accessibility thing for me

1018
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:02,325
Speaker 9:  because like talking requires so much less brain power

1019
01:05:02,395 --> 01:05:06,365
Speaker 9:  than like writing does. So if I wanna go look up, you

1020
01:05:06,365 --> 01:05:10,085
Speaker 9:  know, my search history, I don't wanna type that in.

1021
01:05:10,485 --> 01:05:14,325
Speaker 9:  I know where to go find it and I just wanna, you know, like, oh here's

1022
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:18,045
Speaker 9:  the little thing in my browser for history that I can see. I can just

1023
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:21,805
Speaker 9:  click on it and then I can like go through it all. Now If, you have

1024
01:05:21,805 --> 01:05:25,285
Speaker 9:  like a long search history and you have like

1025
01:05:25,745 --> 01:05:29,525
Speaker 9:  no idea when you found that thing or what even what that thing

1026
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:33,565
Speaker 9:  was. Yeah, I can definitely see that being useful. If you were, remember

1027
01:05:33,565 --> 01:05:36,965
Speaker 9:  what you're trying to find. So yeah. Yeah,

1028
01:05:37,395 --> 01:05:41,085
Speaker 9:  it's, it seems very similar to

1029
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:45,765
Speaker 9:  going into a search engine and furiously typing, like trying to

1030
01:05:45,765 --> 01:05:49,685
Speaker 9:  find the article that you found. Now

1031
01:05:49,685 --> 01:05:52,965
Speaker 9:  for me, I don't save any of my search history. Like if I need to go find

1032
01:05:52,965 --> 01:05:56,765
Speaker 9:  something, I bookmark it and I have a little folder for it. So I know

1033
01:05:56,795 --> 01:06:00,045
Speaker 9:  like I'm gonna go back and find that. So

1034
01:06:00,345 --> 01:06:03,725
Speaker 9:  philosophically it feels like there's

1035
01:06:04,115 --> 01:06:07,925
Speaker 9:  this organizational method that I use and then

1036
01:06:08,515 --> 01:06:12,125
Speaker 9:  there's tools for people who maybe

1037
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:16,405
Speaker 9:  don't organize the same way like I do. And that's kind of like where

1038
01:06:17,025 --> 01:06:17,605
Speaker 9:  AI is heading.

1039
01:06:18,245 --> 01:06:21,245
Speaker 2:  I as someone whose entire organizational strategy is just to open several

1040
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:24,845
Speaker 2:  thousand tabs and then close them when my computer collapses Your way sounds

1041
01:06:24,845 --> 01:06:28,365
Speaker 2:  better. Alright, before I let you go here, let's, let's just wildly

1042
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:31,885
Speaker 2:  prognosticate for a couple of minutes. So let's assume these

1043
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:35,525
Speaker 2:  Qualcomm chips come out and they are, everything they are promised to be,

1044
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,805
Speaker 2:  the efficiency is unbelievable. The performance is outta control. They are

1045
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:42,725
Speaker 2:  like they, they finally did the thing. Are we gonna get like

1046
01:06:42,805 --> 01:06:46,685
Speaker 2:  a whole new generation of new kinds of PCs as

1047
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:50,525
Speaker 2:  a result? Like if this is what we think, does it stand to sort of

1048
01:06:50,525 --> 01:06:54,485
Speaker 2:  change what our computers are or is this

1049
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:57,605
Speaker 2:  just like bringing windows kind of up to

1050
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:01,925
Speaker 2:  par with some of the best of what you can get from Apple right now?

1051
01:07:02,505 --> 01:07:06,245
Speaker 10:  No, I like, I don't think so. The hardware will still be pretty much the

1052
01:07:06,245 --> 01:07:10,125
Speaker 10:  same. We've already seen the, the limits of what they can do with

1053
01:07:10,145 --> 01:07:13,965
Speaker 10:  the, the chassis anyway. Like the Surface pro X is pretty much as thin as

1054
01:07:13,965 --> 01:07:17,805
Speaker 10:  you're gonna get this sort of hardware at this sort of stage until, until

1055
01:07:17,805 --> 01:07:20,725
Speaker 10:  it really gets shrunk down even further. But, so I don't think it's going

1056
01:07:20,725 --> 01:07:24,005
Speaker 10:  to change much on the hardware side. Yeah you might get some thinner and

1057
01:07:24,005 --> 01:07:27,805
Speaker 10:  lighter designs and all that sort of stuff. It will

1058
01:07:27,805 --> 01:07:31,245
Speaker 10:  change the battery life. Like that sort of situation I think would be greatly

1059
01:07:31,445 --> 01:07:35,205
Speaker 10:  improved. But I think it's really gonna be on the software side of things,

1060
01:07:35,505 --> 01:07:39,165
Speaker 10:  how Windows leverages the NPU, like we've been talking about that that software

1061
01:07:39,165 --> 01:07:42,765
Speaker 10:  side is really gonna be what differentiates these devices versus the

1062
01:07:42,985 --> 01:07:45,085
Speaker 10:  the laptops that you've got to of today. Yeah.

1063
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:49,565
Speaker 2:  My great hope is that you're totally wrong and that actually we're gonna

1064
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,525
Speaker 2:  go back to that phase we were in 10 years ago where everybody was just like,

1065
01:07:52,525 --> 01:07:55,925
Speaker 2:  what if a laptop was different? Yeah, maybe. But I kind of think that went

1066
01:07:56,025 --> 01:07:59,205
Speaker 2:  so badly for everybody that there's going to be real reluctance to do that

1067
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:02,925
Speaker 2:  again. Because like I think, who was it Acer that was just like, what if

1068
01:08:02,925 --> 01:08:06,245
Speaker 2:  we put the track pad above the keyboard and everybody's like, that's the

1069
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:09,685
Speaker 2:  stupidest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. And I think it the road

1070
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:13,565
Speaker 2:  to like wildly try to change what a PC looks and feels like

1071
01:08:13,745 --> 01:08:16,605
Speaker 2:  is probably much longer than it once was. Even if we can do

1072
01:08:16,605 --> 01:08:19,525
Speaker 10:  It. Yeah, that was like the Windows a era where there was a lot of Right

1073
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:21,885
Speaker 10:  experimentation in hardware should we say. Yeah.

1074
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:23,805
Speaker 2:  Which I think no one is eager to repeat.

1075
01:08:24,065 --> 01:08:27,805
Speaker 10:  No. Yeah, no I think, I think it's gonna be, it's gonna be pretty timid

1076
01:08:27,865 --> 01:08:31,765
Speaker 10:  but I do hope we see Ner and lighter, like the surface prox, that

1077
01:08:31,795 --> 01:08:35,725
Speaker 10:  sort of device is, is really nice. If, you can get more of that. That'd

1078
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:35,925
Speaker 10:  be nice.

1079
01:08:36,385 --> 01:08:39,765
Speaker 2:  Joanna, what about you? Any, are you, are you expecting wild experimentation?

1080
01:08:40,485 --> 01:08:43,925
Speaker 9:  Absolutely not. But if we can

1081
01:08:44,355 --> 01:08:47,845
Speaker 9:  make chips just as powerful, but that also run cooler,

1082
01:08:48,265 --> 01:08:52,245
Speaker 9:  we can make even thinner and lighter laptops. The

1083
01:08:52,365 --> 01:08:55,925
Speaker 9:  issue that we're running into now is like thermals, right? And

1084
01:08:56,115 --> 01:08:59,485
Speaker 9:  what happens when the processor gets too hot,

1085
01:09:00,065 --> 01:09:03,925
Speaker 9:  hot are the, the other components get too hot. Like that just means

1086
01:09:03,925 --> 01:09:07,725
Speaker 9:  it's drawing in a lot of power. And what is it doing? It's using more energy.

1087
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:11,565
Speaker 9:  It's depleting the battery life, right? So

1088
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:15,485
Speaker 9:  a lot, there are companies who have figured out like a nice balance

1089
01:09:15,595 --> 01:09:19,085
Speaker 9:  with that. Like I find Lenovo does

1090
01:09:19,485 --> 01:09:23,405
Speaker 9:  a really good job at balancing power and

1091
01:09:23,815 --> 01:09:27,525
Speaker 9:  their battery life. So until we can like make chips that

1092
01:09:27,745 --> 01:09:31,405
Speaker 9:  run cooler, I think that we won't

1093
01:09:31,595 --> 01:09:35,485
Speaker 9:  like one see as many use cases on the software

1094
01:09:35,795 --> 01:09:39,645
Speaker 9:  side of things. And then we also like will be

1095
01:09:39,645 --> 01:09:43,325
Speaker 9:  limited to what sort of like new laptop form factors can come out.

1096
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:47,405
Speaker 9:  Like I would love to see one of these qual

1097
01:09:47,845 --> 01:09:51,525
Speaker 9:  Qualcomm chips in a dual OLED display

1098
01:09:51,745 --> 01:09:55,525
Speaker 9:  laptop. Yeah, like the Zen book or the Lenovo yoga

1099
01:09:55,635 --> 01:09:59,445
Speaker 9:  book. I think that if it goes

1100
01:09:59,515 --> 01:10:00,405
Speaker 9:  like the best way

1101
01:11:14,085 --> 01:11:18,045
Speaker 11:  kidding me? My man and I, we attempted to move out. Yeah, that'll be

1102
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:20,685
Speaker 11:  $1,600 for a studio apartment. Not including Rosie,

1103
01:11:20,785 --> 01:11:24,405
Speaker 12:  Not including last fall, the National Association of Realtors released data

1104
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:27,885
Speaker 12:  showing that housing affordability had fallen to its lowest point since

1105
01:11:27,885 --> 01:11:31,005
Speaker 12:  the 1980s for reasons of economy,

1106
01:11:31,575 --> 01:11:32,645
Speaker 12:  comma American,

1107
01:11:32,815 --> 01:11:36,005
Speaker 13:  There just aren't a lot of home sales going on.

1108
01:11:36,665 --> 01:11:40,285
Speaker 13:  And there's really kind of a standoff right now between buyers and sellers

1109
01:11:40,635 --> 01:11:43,045
Speaker 12:  That standoff leads to another kind of standoff.

1110
01:11:43,355 --> 01:11:46,285
Speaker 14:  It's always fun being 40 something years old and having to live with your

1111
01:11:46,285 --> 01:11:49,445
Speaker 14:  parents again. And I know it's all my fault,

1112
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:54,405
Speaker 12:  Sir, I don't know your life, but on today explained a Tupac series on how

1113
01:11:54,425 --> 01:11:55,845
Speaker 12:  it might not be your fault.

1114
01:12:04,865 --> 01:12:08,085
Speaker 14:  And I'll tell my mom, mom, I'm gonna the bathroom, I'll be back if I'm not

1115
01:12:08,085 --> 01:12:12,045
Speaker 14:  out in like three minutes. Dog. She's like knocking on the door going,

1116
01:12:12,045 --> 01:12:15,485
Speaker 14:  everything okay in there? Yeah, mom, everything's cool, dog.

1117
01:13:16,755 --> 01:13:19,575
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the Hotline as always. The number is

1118
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:23,455
Speaker 2:  8 6 6 Verge one one. The email is Vergecast at The

1119
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:27,055
Speaker 2:  Verge dot com. We love hearing all of your questions and we try to answer

1120
01:13:27,115 --> 01:13:30,375
Speaker 2:  at least one on the show every week. This week we have a question from Tony.

1121
01:13:31,795 --> 01:13:35,575
Speaker 17:  Hi Bridge casters. This is Tony. I'm in the market for a new e-reader.

1122
01:13:35,815 --> 01:13:39,735
Speaker 17:  I have books on Kindle epub formats and p devs. I've been

1123
01:13:39,735 --> 01:13:43,455
Speaker 17:  thinking about getting a books Palmer, but the price and it being kind of

1124
01:13:43,455 --> 01:13:46,975
Speaker 17:  stuck on Android 11 maybe be obsolete too quickly

1125
01:13:47,555 --> 01:13:50,895
Speaker 17:  is holding me back. So I just go the normally route and buy a Kindle.

1126
01:13:51,325 --> 01:13:55,295
Speaker 17:  Also, how's a new Kobo color and why do I feel more complete when

1127
01:13:55,295 --> 01:13:59,135
Speaker 17:  I buy a new gizmo and gadget? Any help you could gimme would be great. So

1128
01:13:59,135 --> 01:13:59,295
Speaker 17:  yeah,

1129
01:14:00,115 --> 01:14:03,575
Speaker 2:  All of the existential questions of To Vergecast rolled into one. There is

1130
01:14:03,575 --> 01:14:07,175
Speaker 2:  only one person on earth who is the most qualified to answer this Alex

1131
01:14:07,275 --> 01:14:08,095
Speaker 2:  Krantz, hello.

1132
01:14:08,635 --> 01:14:10,335
Speaker 12:  Hey. Yeah, I, I know

1133
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:13,885
Speaker 18:  Why I feel better after I buy a gizmo. It's just like

1134
01:14:13,945 --> 01:14:17,325
Speaker 18:  retail therapy's just, it's magic.

1135
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:21,085
Speaker 2:  It's, there's just something where you're like, I have now acquired this

1136
01:14:21,465 --> 01:14:24,925
Speaker 2:  and I'm going to, I'm gonna use it. Well yeah, and it's gonna make me better,

1137
01:14:25,175 --> 01:14:29,165
Speaker 2:  especially with reading gadgets. There is something to like, ah, I've really

1138
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:33,125
Speaker 2:  fallen off on, you know, deep classic fiction and this is the

1139
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:37,045
Speaker 2:  thing that's gonna get me back into it and it never is. But, so I wanna,

1140
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:40,285
Speaker 2:  I wanna answer this question kind of in reverse. Okay. Tell me about the

1141
01:14:40,315 --> 01:14:42,765
Speaker 2:  Kobo. You've now had it for a few days early thoughts.

1142
01:14:43,285 --> 01:14:46,965
Speaker 18:  I like it. It's, so I've got both the Libra and Nico Clara

1143
01:14:47,185 --> 01:14:50,845
Speaker 18:  and I've been using the Libra more. In fact, right after I finished

1144
01:14:50,845 --> 01:14:54,685
Speaker 18:  recording this, running over to the library to update my library card Nice.

1145
01:14:54,785 --> 01:14:57,725
Speaker 18:  So that I can get some books on it because it's got overdrive built in,

1146
01:14:57,725 --> 01:15:01,565
Speaker 18:  which is really exciting. But it's also a Kobo e-reader,

1147
01:15:01,565 --> 01:15:05,365
Speaker 18:  so it's like built for Cobos bookstore and stuff. So it's a little more

1148
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:09,245
Speaker 18:  difficult to use. Like you, you know, it's a little more difficult to

1149
01:15:09,245 --> 01:15:12,925
Speaker 18:  get all your books on it if you're not already in the Kobo ecosystem.

1150
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:16,885
Speaker 18:  Right. But it's still really good and it's super light and it's just

1151
01:15:16,885 --> 01:15:20,765
Speaker 18:  like, it moves fast. It just like, I'm like, Ooh, I had, I make that noise

1152
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:23,685
Speaker 18:  every time. I like turn it on. Just like, oh, it's just, it's just going,

1153
01:15:24,245 --> 01:15:28,165
Speaker 2:  I really just, the one screenshot I keep seeing of the home screen of

1154
01:15:28,265 --> 01:15:32,245
Speaker 2:  the color where you can actually see the color on all the book covers, I'm

1155
01:15:32,245 --> 01:15:33,685
Speaker 2:  just like, ugh, I want that.

1156
01:15:33,955 --> 01:15:36,685
Speaker 18:  It's wonderful. But also it is in no way perfect. Yeah,

1157
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:37,045
Speaker 2:  I believe

1158
01:15:37,045 --> 01:15:40,965
Speaker 18:  It. Kaleido three, the, the technology they're using is, is really

1159
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:44,725
Speaker 18:  good and it is in so much better than previous

1160
01:15:44,725 --> 01:15:48,525
Speaker 18:  iterations of color e Inc, but it's still like the

1161
01:15:48,525 --> 01:15:52,085
Speaker 18:  colors aren't as vibrant as, as you're used to on, on other

1162
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:54,525
Speaker 18:  displays or even just like print magazines.

1163
01:15:55,035 --> 01:15:58,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's fair. And I think to some extent that's fine. Yeah. Right.

1164
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:01,445
Speaker 2:  Like I think, I don't know, I've, I've now used these devices long enough

1165
01:16:01,445 --> 01:16:05,365
Speaker 2:  that I think anybody who is like mad about the pixel density of EIN

1166
01:16:05,425 --> 01:16:08,845
Speaker 2:  is kind of barking up the wrong tree. That's just not the point. I think

1167
01:16:08,845 --> 01:16:12,285
Speaker 2:  it's good enough in most cases. But then it's weird because color does introduce

1168
01:16:12,325 --> 01:16:15,805
Speaker 2:  a thing where like when it's just sort of black on gray,

1169
01:16:16,145 --> 01:16:19,765
Speaker 2:  you don't notice it quite the same way. But I can imagine when you have theoretically

1170
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:23,685
Speaker 2:  lots of colors, you're gonna notice the things that don't look good more.

1171
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:28,125
Speaker 18:  Yeah. And I, you really notice that on like the Android e

1172
01:16:28,145 --> 01:16:31,805
Speaker 18:  Ink tablets that do color like it is really, really noticeable. It's, it's

1173
01:16:31,805 --> 01:16:35,365
Speaker 18:  a lot easier on this one and, and I think for most people, if you're ready

1174
01:16:35,365 --> 01:16:39,325
Speaker 18:  to dip your toes into color ein, I need more time with it.

1175
01:16:39,325 --> 01:16:42,685
Speaker 18:  But I suspect Kobo is the way I'm gonna push people for a little while.

1176
01:16:42,885 --> 01:16:46,285
Speaker 18:  'cause it's just like it's a nice ass reader

1177
01:16:46,905 --> 01:16:50,685
Speaker 18:  so far. Yeah, I'm enjoying it. But yeah, it's not

1178
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,365
Speaker 18:  quite iPad worthy. Okay. So if you're still like, I want it to be an iPad,

1179
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:55,205
Speaker 18:  I'm sorry.

1180
01:16:55,795 --> 01:16:59,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, I do think I've, like the first question I ask people now who

1181
01:16:59,785 --> 01:17:03,725
Speaker 2:  ask what e-reader to buy is, are you sure the correct answer isn't an iPad

1182
01:17:03,725 --> 01:17:06,325
Speaker 2:  mini? Because I think for a lot of people the correct answer is an iPad mini.

1183
01:17:06,635 --> 01:17:09,790
Speaker 2:  It's also like three times the price in a very, very different battery life

1184
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:13,045
Speaker 2:  story and all of that. So yep. Let's just leave that one aside for now. Like

1185
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:16,325
Speaker 2:  Tony, ask yourself the question, is the right thing an iPad mini? And if

1186
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:19,925
Speaker 2:  it's not, let's keep going. So keep going. The question of which

1187
01:17:20,045 --> 01:17:23,405
Speaker 2:  e-reader to buy is, I feel like you and I talk about this every time we talk

1188
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,245
Speaker 2:  about this. It's like weirdly a lifestyle decision because you're like, okay,

1189
01:17:26,245 --> 01:17:30,205
Speaker 2:  if I buy a Kindle, I am in on Amazon because Amazon stuff has

1190
01:17:30,205 --> 01:17:33,485
Speaker 2:  gotten a little more open over time and you can upload PDFs and you can upload

1191
01:17:33,685 --> 01:17:37,605
Speaker 2:  epub stuff and it's a little better, but only a little and it's kind of

1192
01:17:37,605 --> 01:17:40,485
Speaker 2:  a pain in the ass. And If, you want to just like buy or download a book,

1193
01:17:40,665 --> 01:17:44,565
Speaker 2:  you are gonna do it through Amazon and Kobo, which I think used to be

1194
01:17:44,805 --> 01:17:48,085
Speaker 2:  a little more open and I was excited about things like the pocket integration

1195
01:17:48,145 --> 01:17:50,965
Speaker 2:  has lost a little bit of that. So they're coming towards this middle of like,

1196
01:17:51,385 --> 01:17:54,885
Speaker 2:  you're kind of just picking your poison either way, right?

1197
01:17:55,395 --> 01:17:58,645
Speaker 18:  Yeah. It's kinda like, I I think a lot about the Apple

1198
01:17:58,795 --> 01:18:01,405
Speaker 18:  antitrust thing here because it, it's the same thing where you're like,

1199
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:05,165
Speaker 18:  oh no, I have to make this decision of like ecosystem pretty early

1200
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:08,925
Speaker 18:  on because moving to a new ecosystem is hard

1201
01:18:09,425 --> 01:18:13,085
Speaker 18:  and it's EAs it's certainly easier with an e-reader, but you still have

1202
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:17,045
Speaker 18:  to go download Collibra. You still have to go look up a bunch

1203
01:18:17,045 --> 01:18:20,245
Speaker 18:  of tutorials and load it all up and, and, and pull all your books over and

1204
01:18:20,245 --> 01:18:21,765
Speaker 18:  then transfer over. Right?

1205
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:25,765
Speaker 2:  You've just lost 99.5% of people, right? Like just right there. Yeah.

1206
01:18:25,915 --> 01:18:29,285
Speaker 18:  Most people don't wanna do that. So you really do have to say, okay, do

1207
01:18:29,285 --> 01:18:33,045
Speaker 18:  I wanna go Kobo, do I wanna go Amazon? And I think Kobo is doing

1208
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:35,725
Speaker 18:  more interesting stuff in the space right now, right? If you're looking

1209
01:18:35,725 --> 01:18:39,285
Speaker 18:  for just a straight e-reader not thinking about it. But, but that's not

1210
01:18:39,285 --> 01:18:42,485
Speaker 18:  what Tony Tony's thinking about like the books Paulo, which is a Right

1211
01:18:43,235 --> 01:18:46,885
Speaker 18:  just no color. Black and white. I think it's like six inch

1212
01:18:47,335 --> 01:18:47,685
Speaker 18:  phone.

1213
01:18:47,915 --> 01:18:51,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's an, it's an E Ink phone basically, right? Is like, it's a little,

1214
01:18:51,835 --> 01:18:55,325
Speaker 2:  it's a little tiny tablet that does e ink stuff. And actually I have one

1215
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:58,085
Speaker 2:  on its way to me right now and I'm so excited about it because I don't dunno,

1216
01:18:58,085 --> 01:19:02,005
Speaker 2:  If you notice this, but it's like a, a little thing that just is percolating

1217
01:19:02,005 --> 01:19:04,725
Speaker 2:  around the internet as like the internet's favorite gadget. Like Craig Mod,

1218
01:19:04,785 --> 01:19:07,765
Speaker 2:  who is a newsletter writer and author who I love is like obsessed with his

1219
01:19:07,975 --> 01:19:10,885
Speaker 2:  bunch of people are getting it and being like, this is the exact thing that

1220
01:19:10,885 --> 01:19:14,725
Speaker 2:  I need. I'm very enthusiastic about it as a little tiny pocketable

1221
01:19:14,725 --> 01:19:18,405
Speaker 2:  reading device, but it does make me nervous. And part of the reason I wanted

1222
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:21,645
Speaker 2:  to do this with you is to sort of check in on where we're at with books because

1223
01:19:22,055 --> 01:19:25,565
Speaker 2:  we've been, I think, enthusiastic about their potential for a while now,

1224
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:29,765
Speaker 2:  but it doesn't feel like we've gotten kind of the breakthrough device

1225
01:19:29,905 --> 01:19:30,125
Speaker 2:  yet.

1226
01:19:30,645 --> 01:19:34,325
Speaker 18:  I think the, the Palmer feels closest. Right. Okay. And and Tony's concern

1227
01:19:34,345 --> 01:19:37,925
Speaker 18:  was that they, it's on Android 11, it might not get upgraded

1228
01:19:38,175 --> 01:19:41,085
Speaker 18:  books has actually been really good in the last couple of years about upgrading.

1229
01:19:41,105 --> 01:19:44,965
Speaker 18:  Oh, okay. Pretty consistently. Is it always gonna be to the newest, latest

1230
01:19:44,965 --> 01:19:46,165
Speaker 18:  flavor of Android? No,

1231
01:19:46,305 --> 01:19:49,725
Speaker 2:  But also for what you're using these devices for. It's like if, if what you

1232
01:19:49,725 --> 01:19:52,965
Speaker 2:  need is the latest download of the Netflix app, like you're buying the wrong

1233
01:19:52,965 --> 01:19:53,365
Speaker 2:  device,

1234
01:19:53,815 --> 01:19:57,565
Speaker 18:  Don't, don't buy this for that. Right? Yeah. I think like if

1235
01:19:57,565 --> 01:20:01,325
Speaker 18:  you're looking at the Palmer and your only concern is that it's on

1236
01:20:01,325 --> 01:20:04,965
Speaker 18:  Android 11, just go get the Palmer, you're gonna have a great time. It's

1237
01:20:04,965 --> 01:20:07,725
Speaker 18:  gonna get updated at some point. Like you'll be fine.

1238
01:20:08,325 --> 01:20:10,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think that's right. And I mean, I'm just thinking about this as you're

1239
01:20:10,805 --> 01:20:14,685
Speaker 2:  talking that like, this is one case where Android being so

1240
01:20:14,965 --> 01:20:18,765
Speaker 2:  fragmented actually helps you because like on on iOS, I would be much more

1241
01:20:18,765 --> 01:20:21,005
Speaker 2:  worried about sending you to a device that's a few years old because you're

1242
01:20:21,005 --> 01:20:24,845
Speaker 2:  gonna start to get outdated software that won't support old versions of the

1243
01:20:25,005 --> 01:20:28,205
Speaker 2:  software on Android. A lot of these developers don't have a choice but to

1244
01:20:28,205 --> 01:20:32,045
Speaker 2:  support wide swaths of Android. So the odds

1245
01:20:32,045 --> 01:20:35,845
Speaker 2:  of you being able to use even Android 11 with like the

1246
01:20:35,845 --> 01:20:39,685
Speaker 2:  Kindle app and the Barnes and Noble app and your favorite reading app probably

1247
01:20:39,685 --> 01:20:41,245
Speaker 2:  pretty high for a while. Yeah,

1248
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:45,205
Speaker 18:  Yeah. You're you're gonna be using it for a while. Yeah. I bought a books

1249
01:20:45,285 --> 01:20:49,245
Speaker 18:  e-reader back in like 2019. It's still getting system

1250
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:52,485
Speaker 18:  updates, it's still getting software updates, like it's still cruising.

1251
01:20:52,565 --> 01:20:56,285
Speaker 18:  I can still use all the main e reading software on it. So if

1252
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:59,365
Speaker 18:  that's kind of what you're looking at, Tony, just go get it.

1253
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:03,325
Speaker 2:  And books, we should say is more like, it's, it's basically an EIN tablet

1254
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:06,605
Speaker 2:  that runs Android, right? Is that a reasonable explanation? Yeah,

1255
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:10,045
Speaker 18:  It is an, it's, it's an EIN tablet, it's an Android EIN tablet.

1256
01:21:10,515 --> 01:21:14,205
Speaker 18:  They do their own kind of custom launcher and stuff. And you could theoretically

1257
01:21:14,205 --> 01:21:18,085
Speaker 18:  go do it your own launcher but stick with theirs. Yeah. Because

1258
01:21:18,085 --> 01:21:20,965
Speaker 18:  it's, it's built for ein and that's, that's the really big friction you

1259
01:21:21,165 --> 01:21:24,685
Speaker 18:  notice with those Android e Inc tablets is they're using apps that weren't

1260
01:21:24,685 --> 01:21:27,885
Speaker 18:  built for ein and it just, you just run into little hiccups and quirks.

1261
01:21:27,945 --> 01:21:28,165
Speaker 18:  But

1262
01:21:28,165 --> 01:21:31,965
Speaker 2:  The flip side is you get all the apps, right? Like that's, and I, I

1263
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:35,685
Speaker 2:  can't think of any other meaningful e-reader out there.

1264
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:40,165
Speaker 2:  If there is one, people tell us, Vergecast the virgin.com send

1265
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:43,805
Speaker 2:  us links to all of the cool cross platform e-readers that exist. I don't

1266
01:21:43,805 --> 01:21:46,845
Speaker 2:  think we're gonna get very many emails, but that's the pitch right, with

1267
01:21:46,845 --> 01:21:48,485
Speaker 2:  the books is they're just like, you can have all the apps.

1268
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:51,765
Speaker 18:  Yeah, exactly. That, that's the pitch. Because there's, there's a couple

1269
01:21:51,765 --> 01:21:55,285
Speaker 18:  other folks out there who, who are primarily there. They're Chinese based

1270
01:21:55,565 --> 01:21:59,405
Speaker 18:  companies who are doing this as well and everybody's kind of settled on,

1271
01:21:59,405 --> 01:22:03,085
Speaker 18:  okay, I guess we'll go with Android and, and do like a weird custom

1272
01:22:03,175 --> 01:22:06,245
Speaker 18:  build of Android. But then they run into a problem of doing weird custom

1273
01:22:06,245 --> 01:22:08,765
Speaker 18:  builds of Android is hard and, and it's hard to maintain and everything,

1274
01:22:08,765 --> 01:22:11,845
Speaker 18:  which is why books is kind of ahead, because they're a bigger company and

1275
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:15,085
Speaker 18:  they can just maintain it better. But yeah. And then all the other kind

1276
01:22:15,085 --> 01:22:18,885
Speaker 18:  of small e-reader companies, you have to side load and you're just

1277
01:22:18,885 --> 01:22:22,645
Speaker 18:  stuck side loading everything, which is fine. That's what I did to get,

1278
01:22:22,645 --> 01:22:25,525
Speaker 18:  to start reading on the Kobo this weekend. 'cause I need to buy more Kobo

1279
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:28,325
Speaker 18:  books. That's not everybody's bag.

1280
01:22:28,475 --> 01:22:31,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I mean, again, I think the good news is that with a little bit

1281
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:34,845
Speaker 2:  of work, if what you have is a library of

1282
01:22:35,595 --> 01:22:39,565
Speaker 2:  PDFs and stuff, you can get those onto most e-readers now. Like

1283
01:22:39,565 --> 01:22:42,365
Speaker 2:  it is, it's not easy, but it is doable.

1284
01:22:42,585 --> 01:22:46,205
Speaker 18:  If you've got Collibra, you can use any e-reader you want. Yeah. With a

1285
01:22:46,205 --> 01:22:46,965
Speaker 18:  little work. Right?

1286
01:22:47,415 --> 01:22:50,845
Speaker 2:  Right. Has speaking of books has, has books. I feel like they put out a new

1287
01:22:50,975 --> 01:22:54,845
Speaker 2:  thing like every two weeks have they shipped anything cool and

1288
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:55,445
Speaker 2:  new recently?

1289
01:22:56,475 --> 01:22:59,605
Speaker 18:  Nothing Super cool. They, they've been a little quiet. We've seen a lot

1290
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:02,005
Speaker 18:  of, they've just been putting out like color versions of a lot of their,

1291
01:23:02,005 --> 01:23:05,885
Speaker 18:  their products at the moment and a lot of just movement around the

1292
01:23:05,885 --> 01:23:09,405
Speaker 18:  books. Palma, I, I see. Like I'm seeing that thing everywhere and I really

1293
01:23:09,405 --> 01:23:13,125
Speaker 18:  wanna get it, but at the same time I know exactly what it is. And I was

1294
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:16,845
Speaker 18:  like, I have enough books, devices in my house. I was like, do I need another

1295
01:23:16,865 --> 01:23:20,645
Speaker 18:  one that's just a little smaller? I've used smaller a, a readers like that.

1296
01:23:20,805 --> 01:23:22,845
Speaker 18:  I just, it's not my cup of tea personally.

1297
01:23:23,485 --> 01:23:27,245
Speaker 2:  I, I was always the like pocket sized six inch Kindle person

1298
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:30,645
Speaker 2:  and I recently got a Kindle scribe, which is the one with the, the stylist

1299
01:23:30,665 --> 01:23:34,045
Speaker 2:  for taking notes. I love that thing. It's still very light,

1300
01:23:34,545 --> 01:23:37,645
Speaker 2:  so I can like hold it in one hand in bed without dropping it on my face.

1301
01:23:37,905 --> 01:23:41,085
Speaker 2:  But having, having just a little more space, especially for things like

1302
01:23:41,915 --> 01:23:45,725
Speaker 2:  PDFs, which don't often render super well on those smaller

1303
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:48,205
Speaker 2:  screens, way better. Huge fan.

1304
01:23:48,435 --> 01:23:51,285
Speaker 18:  It's nice. Well, that's why I like the Libras because it's got that side

1305
01:23:51,515 --> 01:23:54,685
Speaker 18:  that you can just hold. It's basically got a handle built in and, and I

1306
01:23:54,685 --> 01:23:58,525
Speaker 18:  am all about that. Like I saw that with the original Oasis and was like,

1307
01:23:58,525 --> 01:24:02,405
Speaker 18:  oh, I've now had my platonic ideal form factor for an

1308
01:24:02,405 --> 01:24:06,245
Speaker 18:  e-reader. And I never wanna escape that. If it doesn't have a, like, just

1309
01:24:06,285 --> 01:24:09,805
Speaker 18:  a little handle on the side for me to hold a larger bezel on one side, then

1310
01:24:09,805 --> 01:24:10,365
Speaker 18:  I don't want it.

1311
01:24:10,475 --> 01:24:14,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Give me buttons or give me death is what I always say. I could not

1312
01:24:14,365 --> 01:24:14,565
Speaker 2:  agree

1313
01:24:44,085 --> 01:24:44,525
