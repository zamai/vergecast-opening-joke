00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:06,525
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of whatever the future of

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:10,165
Speaker 2:  the Kindle turns out to be. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am still

4
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:13,965
Speaker 2:  on vacation. This is the second week that I am out right now. If

5
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:17,365
Speaker 2:  you're hearing this on Tuesday, I am probably at,

6
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:21,645
Speaker 2:  with my parents in upstate Connecticut, just hanging out.

7
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:25,685
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm probably on an inner tube in a lake as everyone should be at some

8
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:29,565
Speaker 2:  point this summer. Anyway, while I'm gone, we've been doing this

9
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:33,405
Speaker 2:  little mini pilot season. I hope you enjoyed. Last week we talked about Roku

10
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,965
Speaker 2:  and we talked about car play, trying out some new formats and structures

11
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:40,765
Speaker 2:  for the show, and we're gonna do something similar today. We have two more

12
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:44,405
Speaker 2:  versions of those same shows. We figured instead of just doing one pilot,

13
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:47,605
Speaker 2:  we'd try it twice. We'd get to learn a lot about how it went. Maybe we'd

14
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:50,965
Speaker 2:  be better at it the second time. Maybe you'd be more familiar. We'd love

15
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:53,885
Speaker 2:  to hear your thoughts. We're gonna try it again. This time we're gonna talk

16
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:57,565
Speaker 2:  about Roku and we're gonna talk about eBooks, both super fun, very

17
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:00,965
Speaker 2:  excited for you to hear them both. And as I mentioned before, we really,

18
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:04,365
Speaker 2:  really want to hear your feedback. I wanna know everything you think about

19
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,285
Speaker 2:  these formats, about these shows, about whether you'd like to hear more of

20
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:10,925
Speaker 2:  them, about whether you hope we never, ever do them again. All of it. We've

21
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:13,525
Speaker 2:  been experimenting with this stuff. We always like trying new formats and

22
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:17,325
Speaker 2:  new ideas, but we also love what this show is, and we don't want to

23
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:20,645
Speaker 2:  change it just for the sake of changing it. So tell us everything you think

24
00:01:20,935 --> 00:01:24,445
Speaker 2:  about the show, about the formats, about the stuff that we're covering in

25
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:27,485
Speaker 2:  particular, if you have ideas for what you wanna see us do on either of those

26
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:31,525
Speaker 2:  shows and segments, please let us know. Vergecast at The Verge dot com. Call

27
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:35,365
Speaker 2:  the hotline. Eight six six VERGE one, one. We wanna hear everything. Alright,

28
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,925
Speaker 2:  two more pilots. Let's go. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

29
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:58,485
Speaker 2:  to do that with tech. There's so many old gadgets and so many old apps and

30
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:02,365
Speaker 2:  so many interesting stories baked into these sort of moments in

31
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:05,765
Speaker 2:  tech history. And we've been trying to figure out what is a fun way to go

32
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:09,365
Speaker 2:  back through a lot of that stuff. Talk about where we were, how we got to

33
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:12,965
Speaker 2:  where we are now, what still matters, the legacy of all these things and

34
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:16,845
Speaker 2:  all of that. So we kind of cobbled together a show based

35
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:20,765
Speaker 2:  on all of the different stuff that we liked from all the other rewatch podcasts.

36
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:24,205
Speaker 2:  And like I said, we've been calling it version history. Last week we talked

37
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,885
Speaker 2:  about the Roku Netflix player, which was very fun. And this week we are talking

38
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:31,445
Speaker 2:  about, I would say, a Wilder story

39
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:35,645
Speaker 2:  that either is more important or less important to the world, depending on

40
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:38,965
Speaker 2:  how you look at it. That's right. It's time to talk about Quibi

41
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:46,645
Speaker 6:  Big stories told in six to 10 minute episodes, or

42
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:47,245
Speaker 6:  Quibi

43
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:51,525
Speaker 2:  Neela Patel. Hello. Hello. Alex Krantz. Hello.

44
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:53,125
Speaker 5:  How do y'all coming

45
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,725
Speaker 2:  Off the smashing success of our first version

46
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:59,365
Speaker 2:  history pilot last week? I don't know, people might have hated it. I'm on

47
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,405
Speaker 2:  vacation. We'll figure it out when I get back. We're, we're gonna do this

48
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:06,085
Speaker 2:  again this time with what I would say is everyone's favorite streaming service

49
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:09,485
Speaker 2:  of all time. It's called Quibi. And again, just quick reminder, the, the

50
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:12,685
Speaker 2:  way that we're structuring this, we're gonna do kind of a brief history lesson.

51
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:16,845
Speaker 2:  This one's gonna be fun because it's very recent and we all were journalists

52
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:19,685
Speaker 2:  through the whole run of this. So I think we, we all covered this in different

53
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:23,205
Speaker 2:  ways. Then we're gonna talk about reviews and how it was perceived in both

54
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:26,605
Speaker 2:  as a, as a product and a cultural thing. And then we have some questions

55
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:30,085
Speaker 2:  we're gonna answer about like, what it was and its legacy in the future.

56
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:33,165
Speaker 2:  And then at the end, we're gonna decide if it belongs in the version History

57
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:36,885
Speaker 2:  Hall of Fame, all of the prerequisites for which we have not yet

58
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:40,485
Speaker 2:  decided. It's gonna be great. Alex, I feel like you should

59
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:44,445
Speaker 2:  do the Quibi history. This is near and dear to your heart in a way that I

60
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:47,165
Speaker 2:  find very mysterious and strange. It's true. So can you tell us the story

61
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:48,885
Speaker 2:  of Quibi as we go here? I

62
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:52,525
Speaker 5:  Can. I can. Because once upon a time, there was a man named Jeffrey Katzenberg,

63
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:57,285
Speaker 5:  and, and he was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. He, he still

64
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:00,525
Speaker 5:  is in 20 24, 1 of the most powerful men in Hollywood,

65
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:04,805
Speaker 5:  creator of Dreamworks, which was major studio. And, and he

66
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:08,165
Speaker 5:  wanted to get in on streaming because at this point, this is

67
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:12,285
Speaker 5:  2018, we know that NBC's got something in the works. We know

68
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:16,165
Speaker 5:  Disney's got something in the works. We know HBO Warner Brothers at

69
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,925
Speaker 5:  t whatever that mess is, is planning something,

70
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:23,805
Speaker 5:  Apple's planning something, everybody is planning a streaming service. And,

71
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:27,925
Speaker 5:  and, and Jeff is like, yeah, I wanna do that too. But he, he knows

72
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:31,205
Speaker 5:  that it can't just be any streaming service. He knows that he, he needs to

73
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,525
Speaker 5:  do something different to complete with Netflix, and it's not just make good

74
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:38,485
Speaker 5:  content. So he, he, he thinks of something, he calls it new

75
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:42,245
Speaker 5:  tv originally back in 2018, probably a significantly

76
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:45,765
Speaker 5:  better name than Quibi. He goes, he gets a lot of funding. He

77
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:49,725
Speaker 5:  raises over a billion dollars, $1.75 billion

78
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:53,485
Speaker 5:  just pulling in the money. He starts picking a bad inventory. I mean, he's

79
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:57,085
Speaker 5:  really, he's doing good things, but he still has to make a product and

80
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:57,925
Speaker 5:  release a product.

81
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,765
Speaker 7:  Can I, can I tell a story about this time? Yes, please. So I went to

82
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:06,685
Speaker 7:  a fancy, like dinner at a code conference

83
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:10,525
Speaker 7:  around this time, and I was sitting in just the most unusual group of people.

84
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:14,165
Speaker 7:  It was like the founder of Soylent, another guy, me

85
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:18,925
Speaker 7:  and Katz. And Katz was like, I'm thinking about this thing. And

86
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:22,605
Speaker 7:  he explained what would be become, and I will tell you my reaction was like,

87
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:23,045
Speaker 7:  oh no.

88
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:28,485
Speaker 7:  And I think I might've said, you know, YouTube exists, continue on.

89
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:29,805
Speaker 5:  It's true.

90
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:32,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah. YouTube exists is a useful frame for all of what's about to come.

91
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:37,045
Speaker 5:  But, but you know, YouTube was made by the tech people and, and what what

92
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:40,685
Speaker 5:  Jeff wanted to do was make something for the rest of, for like Hollywood,

93
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:44,245
Speaker 5:  right? Like that was his big deal was he knew Hollywood in a way that Netflix

94
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,765
Speaker 5:  and YouTube and everybody else didn't. And so he goes and he gets someone

95
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:51,005
Speaker 5:  who also knows Hollywood, famous Hollywood

96
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:55,245
Speaker 5:  exec. Sure. Right? Meg Whitman. Everybody knows her as a Hollywood

97
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,805
Speaker 5:  exec, right?

98
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:59,405
Speaker 7:  That's HP and eBay. Really two hollywoody companies.

99
00:06:59,405 --> 00:06:59,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:01,045
Speaker 7:  If I had to name too,

101
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:04,645
Speaker 5:  He goes and gets Meg largely because he does need someone in tech. He needs

102
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:06,965
Speaker 5:  somebody who understands tech. So he goes and he gets Meg and he is like,

103
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:10,765
Speaker 5:  do you wanna be my my CEO with me? We'll do it together. And she's

104
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:14,965
Speaker 5:  like, hell yes. And I wanna be a fly on the wall in that particular coffee

105
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:19,045
Speaker 5:  meeting. Right? Like that, that, that's a dream of mine. Jeff Meg called

106
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:23,005
Speaker 5:  me with the recordings. I I wanna listen to 'em. Anyway, so they come

107
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,005
Speaker 5:  together and they, they decide to release this product. And then we all,

108
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:29,965
Speaker 5:  we're all at CES in 2020 and we know this is coming. We know it's

109
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:33,845
Speaker 5:  called Quibi. We know they are spending a ton, like a billion

110
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:37,605
Speaker 5:  dollars on content. And they've got, they've got what

111
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,125
Speaker 5:  Steven Spielberg, they've got Catherine

112
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,965
Speaker 5:  Hardwick, they've got all these big actors and actresses. Everybody's

113
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,685
Speaker 5:  working on Quibi stuff. And there's, there's some, there's some energy around

114
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:52,325
Speaker 5:  it. I'm just gonna use the word energy because I don't think any adjective

115
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:53,725
Speaker 5:  can describe it.

116
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:57,525
Speaker 7:  Wait, can I also color in the energy for you? Yes. So

117
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:01,165
Speaker 7:  before the CS unveil, which I know Alex will talk about, they had

118
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:05,005
Speaker 7:  briefings. Hollywood, like a normal company comes to version, like, we'd

119
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:07,165
Speaker 7:  like to tell you about our product on our embargo. So You can write about

120
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:10,205
Speaker 7:  it. And we're like, great, here's one reporter. They demanded everyone.

121
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:14,565
Speaker 7:  They're like, all of you come Seriously, like Casey Newton, who was

122
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:18,005
Speaker 7:  writing the interface about platform democracy, democracy

123
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,205
Speaker 7:  was like, I'm going to the Quibi briefing. And I was like,

124
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,325
Speaker 7:  why? And he was like, I'm just excited to see someone

125
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:31,365
Speaker 7:  talk about building a platform with this much ambition and this much money.

126
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:35,565
Speaker 7:  And I, he, I will never forget, he came out of the briefing and he was like,

127
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:39,325
Speaker 7:  the only thing I got was that they are spending more per minute of video

128
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,485
Speaker 7:  by like a thousand than any other platform it's ever thought of.

129
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:47,045
Speaker 7:  They're like, here's what you do. You open this app and you watch video on

130
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:50,445
Speaker 7:  YouTube. They get the videos for free from other people. No, no, no. That's

131
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:53,605
Speaker 7:  not what we're doing. We've taken the fanciest directors from Hollywood and

132
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:57,325
Speaker 7:  paid the millions of dollars per minute of video. And I was like, that and

133
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:59,725
Speaker 7:  how are you gonna on it? And they're like, ads. And they're like the same

134
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:00,685
Speaker 7:  ads and they're like, yes.

135
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:02,725
Speaker 5:  It was a beautiful moment. Yeah.

136
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:06,685
Speaker 2:  They very proudly talked about how they were spending Game of Thrones level

137
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:10,445
Speaker 2:  money on like, everything that they were doing. And it's like, well, no,

138
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,925
Speaker 2:  you, there's a reason. It's Game of Thrones.

139
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:13,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

140
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:14,845
Speaker 7:  And

141
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,405
Speaker 2:  You're making one about like haunted house flippers at Game of Throne Throne's

142
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:20,925
Speaker 7:  Budgets. Oh my God. It was very good. It, the whole thing was incredible.

143
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:24,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But that was before cs, like before C they were getting the feedback

144
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:28,685
Speaker 7:  before CS we're like, so the dollars in are big and then the

145
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,965
Speaker 7:  dollars out are small. What's your plan? And they'd be like, quality.

146
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:35,845
Speaker 5:  And, and I kind of, it makes sense. We'll get into it, but it makes sense.

147
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:39,765
Speaker 5:  Right? YouTube is, is basically cable access tv and

148
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:43,525
Speaker 5:  they're like, what if we put actual, not like actual

149
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:46,765
Speaker 5:  producers and people who know how to make entertainment on this instead of

150
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:48,045
Speaker 5:  everybody just experimenting. Yeah.

151
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:53,645
Speaker 5:  Certainly a thing. Maybe 10 years too late. Anyway, so,

152
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:57,125
Speaker 5:  so they decided to announce Quibi. They, they have this big event at

153
00:09:57,245 --> 00:10:01,205
Speaker 5:  CESI know. We, we all got invited. We all went and did the briefings. I sat

154
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:04,645
Speaker 5:  there with Meg Whitman, had a a, a document in front of her with my name

155
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,205
Speaker 5:  on it, my photo, and a whole bunch of information about me.

156
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:12,485
Speaker 5:  And she just, because I guess they get that right, like their CEO, it's a

157
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:15,885
Speaker 5:  normal way. They get prepped and she just power move, just left it sitting

158
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:19,805
Speaker 5:  right between us. So I could see it. Oh my God, that's

159
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:20,405
Speaker 7:  So good. Good. Jeffrey

160
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:22,045
Speaker 5:  Katzenberg, just pacing in the room.

161
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:23,125
Speaker 7:  You were at GIZ then?

162
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:26,965
Speaker 5:  I was at GIZ and, and came out and, and we had the one

163
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:31,085
Speaker 5:  briefing with, with Jeff and, and Meg. And then we had another briefing with

164
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:34,805
Speaker 5:  the CTO and the CPO, the chief product Officer and the Chief Technology

165
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:38,685
Speaker 5:  officer. And one meeting with like a bunch of the actors and

166
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:42,085
Speaker 5:  filmmakers. Yeah. And Catherine Hardrick was like, I just wanna like, take

167
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:45,965
Speaker 5:  control of people's phones so they can see everything I make. And I

168
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:49,805
Speaker 5:  was like, yeah, me too. I didn't say that, but I thought it real hard.

169
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:54,125
Speaker 7:  We also did this gauntlet. I did it with Ashley Carmen and

170
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:58,405
Speaker 7:  we rewrote our entire, like we had, we thought there was a story

171
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:01,405
Speaker 7:  and we had been like working on it. 'cause we'd already had these briefings

172
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:05,285
Speaker 7:  and we threw the whole thing out after we met with Katzenberg, we were like,

173
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:07,085
Speaker 7:  we gotta start over. Yeah.

174
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,325
Speaker 5:  You just know at that moment it was gonna be a bomb.

175
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I, I don't You can read that story. Yeah. Yes. That the

176
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:17,685
Speaker 7:  answer is yes, we, but like, it was also just the man

177
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,085
Speaker 7:  is very charming. Yes.

178
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,485
Speaker 5:  He was terrifying and, and quiet in my interview with him.

179
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:27,565
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. With, with us. It was a full, I've, I've

180
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:30,645
Speaker 7:  encountered Katzenberg several times. I actually just did an event

181
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:34,885
Speaker 7:  about digital, like digital parenting at one of the companies he's invested

182
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:38,525
Speaker 7:  in and he was there. Yeah. And you know, he's, he's very charming,

183
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:42,725
Speaker 7:  but this was like full sales pitch katzenberg and you

184
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:46,525
Speaker 7:  were like, this man thinks his energy can

185
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:50,685
Speaker 7:  overcome reality. It was just like one of the most that we, we just started

186
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:54,685
Speaker 7:  our whole story over we're like this whole, that actual technology

187
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,645
Speaker 7:  has nothing to do with this product. He,

188
00:11:56,645 --> 00:11:59,685
Speaker 5:  He, he, he definitely approached it differently with the Gizmoto crew.

189
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:04,125
Speaker 2:  I mean, and You can argue that the thesis of his energy can overcome reality

190
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,205
Speaker 2:  is the whole thesis of Quibi. Yeah. Basically. Like, this

191
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:11,885
Speaker 2:  thing is probably too late. It's very

192
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,365
Speaker 2:  specific. It's doing kind of a weird thing that seems to be running against

193
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:18,725
Speaker 2:  everything the culture is doing, but Jeffrey Katzenberg. Yeah. Like that

194
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,685
Speaker 2:  was how this thing was covered at the beginning. Right. It was like Jeffrey

195
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:23,525
Speaker 2:  Katzenberg doesn't screw up. He will, he will do it.

196
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:26,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Don't bet. Against Jeffrey. Yeah. Was the Yeah. Over and over and over.

197
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:26,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

198
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:30,845
Speaker 5:  Everybody assumed he was gonna do it and, and they bring it

199
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:34,525
Speaker 5:  out and they knew they, it was clear that they knew content alone

200
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:38,005
Speaker 5:  wasn't gonna win this. Right. They knew we're late to this. We have a lot

201
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:41,085
Speaker 5:  of content, but that alone isn't gonna win it because eventually there'd

202
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:44,365
Speaker 5:  be the show about the lady with a golden arm. And that was a terrible show

203
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,565
Speaker 5:  anyway, by the

204
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:49,485
Speaker 7:  Way. Our headline was Quibi versus the World. That's where we, we came out,

205
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:51,485
Speaker 7:  we were like, okay, this is actually what we're hearing.

206
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:54,925
Speaker 5:  They did one thing, their, their big thing, the big technological innovation

207
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:58,845
Speaker 5:  here was that it would basically deliver two streams at the same time

208
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:02,925
Speaker 5:  and you'd see, and you'd see a stream depending on how you turned your phone.

209
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:06,805
Speaker 5:  So you'd either see it in, in profile or you'd see it in landscape. Those

210
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:10,365
Speaker 5:  are the only two ways to watch it. and it would change depending on it. And

211
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:13,285
Speaker 5:  some of the filmmakers were really, really excited about this. Other filmmakers

212
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:17,485
Speaker 5:  gave two shits and didn't do anything with the format, but most of

213
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:21,365
Speaker 5:  them did do it. And, and it was like, I wanna say kind of impressive

214
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:25,005
Speaker 5:  technology. The technology itself was impressive. Then they

215
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:29,165
Speaker 5:  finally launched it during COV when everyone was at their

216
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:29,405
Speaker 5:  home.

217
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:33,045
Speaker 7:  Can I just remind everyone that the, the, the rotate your phone technology

218
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:34,725
Speaker 5:  Turntable or what, what was

219
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:35,445
Speaker 2:  It called? Turnstile.

220
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,405
Speaker 7:  It was called Turnstile with a y. Yep. Like wild style

221
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:39,885
Speaker 7:  from the Lego.

222
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:46,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But wait, but Butrans, you just glossed over a thing that's

223
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,085
Speaker 2:  very important. So CES 2020 happens.

224
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:49,525
Speaker 5:  Yes.

225
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:53,525
Speaker 2:  Quibi launches April 6th, 2020. Between those two things,

226
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:57,885
Speaker 2:  what relatively important world event would you say happened?

227
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:00,485
Speaker 2:  Somewhere right in the middle? TikTok

228
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:01,085
Speaker 7:  Launch. Yeah.

229
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:05,045
Speaker 5:  Birds of Prey. The movie came out and it was really,

230
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,885
Speaker 5:  really good. But also, yeah, COVID, which

231
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:13,005
Speaker 5:  probably a lot of us interacted with at that CES then

232
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:16,645
Speaker 5:  started interacting with a whole lot of other people. And, and we had a worldwide

233
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:20,725
Speaker 5:  pandemic. And this device, you know, Quibi was made to be

234
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,405
Speaker 5:  for you on the go. It was the whole pitch was, yeah, you watch a little bit

235
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:27,405
Speaker 5:  on your way to work, you watch a little bit on your lunch break while you're

236
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:31,045
Speaker 5:  at work. You watch a little bit on the train, on the way home from work.

237
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,365
Speaker 5:  The assumption is that you would be doing a lot of traveling in that time

238
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:38,245
Speaker 5:  to and from places that didn't happen because we were

239
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:42,205
Speaker 5:  all at home because of lockdown, because of Covid. And this

240
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:45,965
Speaker 5:  product, which was already late, was charging 4 99 with ads

241
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:49,645
Speaker 5:  7 99 without, unless you were a T-Mobile customer, in which

242
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:53,565
Speaker 5:  case you got it for free for a brief period

243
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:57,405
Speaker 5:  of time, but you had to be a T-Mobile customer. That's a choice

244
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:58,005
Speaker 5:  You can make.

245
00:14:58,745 --> 00:14:59,085
Speaker 7:  It is.

246
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:03,165
Speaker 5:  And it was just like the minute it launched, he was like, well no, this isn't

247
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:05,325
Speaker 5:  gonna succeed. The whole reason this exists

248
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:09,765
Speaker 7:  Katz's argument was that everyone was at home and he'd made a product for

249
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:10,525
Speaker 7:  watching on the train.

250
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And so then he scrambled, he panicked and was like, well, we need to

251
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:17,925
Speaker 5:  now release some sort of like, for the TV version

252
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:22,205
Speaker 5:  of this app that is very dependent on your phone and how you

253
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:26,125
Speaker 5:  rotate your phone to get the scenes. And that was a real challenge. And

254
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,005
Speaker 5:  then he was doing some really wild stuff to get people in

255
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:33,445
Speaker 5:  the office and get people working on it and thinking about it at Quibi itself.

256
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:34,885
Speaker 5:  Do y'all remember that?

257
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:36,685
Speaker 7:  No. What was going on? They

258
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,725
Speaker 5:  Were just really trying to entice people into work. And, and, and he was

259
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:43,725
Speaker 5:  as, as, as Neli said, like he was really just using the force of being Jeffrey

260
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:47,765
Speaker 5:  Katzenberg to get people to try to make this succeed. He was like, no,

261
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:50,565
Speaker 5:  everything is totally fine. Yeah. We're just going through a little blip.

262
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:54,325
Speaker 5:  It'll be okay. We just need to keep going. We've got all this content. We're

263
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:57,885
Speaker 5:  working on an app that we're gonna release so that people can watch it in

264
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:01,365
Speaker 5:  their homes. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. It

265
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:03,085
Speaker 5:  wasn't fine. Spoiler

266
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:07,005
Speaker 7:  Alert. Not fine. Wait, real quick. The, the one I think

267
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,845
Speaker 7:  important piece of Quibi history that you missed so far, Kran? Yes. Is the

268
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,805
Speaker 7:  Super Bowl commercial. This is just like, not even in my brain. Can I play

269
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:17,645
Speaker 7:  you the entirety of the Super Bowl commercial right now? Yes. I would like

270
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:18,165
Speaker 7:  to play it for you.

271
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:27,645
Speaker 9:  Where's the car? Like where are you? I'll be there in a Quibi.

272
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:31,125
Speaker 9:  Good. A Quibi less than 10 minutes.

273
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:39,885
Speaker 9:  Next. Daddy got pun. Thanks Daddy. Got pun.

274
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,565
Speaker 9:  Quick bites, big stories. Quibi.

275
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:52,485
Speaker 7:  That's it. That's the whole Super Bowl commercial. Nowhere in there does

276
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:56,285
Speaker 7:  it say we made a streaming surface. Nowhere in it does it say, here is what

277
00:16:56,285 --> 00:17:00,245
Speaker 7:  we're doing. But you do learn that a Quibi is a quick bite and a quick

278
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:04,085
Speaker 7:  bite is less than 10 minutes. And that is apparently very important.

279
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:07,845
Speaker 7:  That was a Super Bowl commercial. What a time. I

280
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:11,325
Speaker 7:  made the joke about TikTok earlier. But it is also true

281
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:15,205
Speaker 7:  that the thing that happened in the pandemic was people just started opening

282
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:19,205
Speaker 7:  TikTok all day. Yes. All night. Because it was free. You

283
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,645
Speaker 7:  got quick bursts of content. You could just scroll right on by

284
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:27,405
Speaker 7:  A lot of the ideas that were in Quibi that like led to Quibi were

285
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:31,165
Speaker 7:  right there in TikTok. They're the same ideas. People are gonna watch video

286
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:34,125
Speaker 7:  on their phone. We should make it super easy. The videos should ideally be

287
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:34,885
Speaker 7:  as short as possible.

288
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:37,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The difference is Quibi was paying the people,

289
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:42,165
Speaker 7:  I dug up the quote, I have it from just Jeffrey. Katzenberg. Yeah. They're

290
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:46,005
Speaker 7:  making content at a hundred dollars a minute. We are making content at a

291
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:48,805
Speaker 7:  hundred thousand dollars a minute. And he says that like

292
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:49,465
Speaker 2:  It's a, it's a,

293
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:52,865
Speaker 7:  Yeah. This was his winning argument in our briefing.

294
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:57,025
Speaker 5:  The reaction in Hollywood to this was really, really weird at that time because

295
00:17:57,145 --> 00:18:00,625
Speaker 5:  a lot of the filmmakers and stuff felt that this was him trying to get around

296
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:04,425
Speaker 5:  by breaking up the films and all the footage into these short bites. Get

297
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,065
Speaker 5:  around paying the actual rates.

298
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:09,825
Speaker 7:  Right. Get around the union fees. Oh, and then, and then he's like, I'm spending

299
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,825
Speaker 7:  literally $10,000 more than, or like a hundred thousand dollars more

300
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:17,665
Speaker 7:  than everybody else. Weird. Just weird, weird time. So the, I'm just saying

301
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:19,345
Speaker 7:  the money in money Out was like a real,

302
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:23,265
Speaker 5:  The the, the way that Quibi ended is still like the part that really gets

303
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:27,065
Speaker 5:  me because he announces that like Yeah, they're about to be layoffs.

304
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:31,305
Speaker 5:  Tells the employees, did they play a song from the movie

305
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:35,505
Speaker 5:  Trolls? Yes. Called Get Back Up Again. And he's like,

306
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:36,785
Speaker 5:  this will make you all feel better.

307
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:39,065
Speaker 7:  Oh my God. and it and it did.

308
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:42,145
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And now Quibi is the largest streaming service in America.

309
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:43,905
Speaker 7:  Thank you. Trolls.

310
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:50,465
Speaker 7:  No, I just wanna, I, before we get to the actual end, the part where

311
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:54,705
Speaker 7:  their technical ideas and their user interface and

312
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:58,665
Speaker 7:  user behavior ideas were correct is actually stunning. Yeah.

313
00:18:58,695 --> 00:19:02,145
Speaker 7:  They were right about, people are gonna watch a lot of video on their phones

314
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:07,145
Speaker 7:  and we should make it shorter and more vertical. And

315
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:10,185
Speaker 7:  maybe they needed to trick Hollywood into making vertical video by doing

316
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:14,105
Speaker 7:  turnstile. But like, they were correct about what was about to happen to

317
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:17,625
Speaker 7:  video on phones. Yes. They were absolutely wrong about the

318
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,105
Speaker 7:  mathematics of those videos. Yes. And who should make them and why people

319
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:23,105
Speaker 7:  would watch them and all of that stuff.

320
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:26,385
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Wait, can I just quickly read you a line from, so Chris Welch reviewed

321
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:29,945
Speaker 2:  the app for us when it first came out and here's just a, a line from it that

322
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:32,745
Speaker 2:  really jumped out to me. He says, opening Quibi starts you off in the for

323
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:35,865
Speaker 2:  You tab, which uses a vertical card interface. It feels more Instagram and

324
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:39,185
Speaker 2:  less Netflix carousel. You'll see a show's title metadata And. if you stay

325
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,665
Speaker 2:  on one card for a few seconds, video begins Autoplaying. Yeah. That's just,

326
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:46,545
Speaker 2:  it's just TikTok. Yeah. Like it's, it's, it really is kind of amazing

327
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:47,065
Speaker 2:  how

328
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:51,345
Speaker 7:  To be clear. TikTok was out and you know, and it's Tom Conrad

329
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:53,145
Speaker 7:  was our CTO, he's a smart dude.

330
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:56,025
Speaker 2:  And also like Snap had done a lot of this stuff. So like the idea that vertical

331
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:59,985
Speaker 2:  video that auto played was gonna be a thing was like, not surprising, but

332
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,985
Speaker 2:  to its credit. Quibi was like, yeah, this is, this is

333
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:08,225
Speaker 2:  the thing. We're not gonna like go 90 it and tell everybody that the solution

334
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:10,505
Speaker 2:  is to flip your phone over. Like,

335
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:13,665
Speaker 7:  Except they did like they did it. They they did it. They did a

336
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:14,105
Speaker 2:  Little bit. They did

337
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:14,865
Speaker 7:  Do that. They

338
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:15,985
Speaker 2:  Did say that. They did do that a little.

339
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:20,505
Speaker 7:  They have a patent Unturn style, which is just the funniest, but like,

340
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:23,465
Speaker 7:  I just want to it, I mean I've dunked on Quibi more than anybody has ever

341
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:27,105
Speaker 7:  dunked on Quibi. But the thing for a bunch of Hollywood

342
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:30,465
Speaker 7:  executives and Meg Whitman to like correctly identify

343
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:34,345
Speaker 7:  how entertainment would change because of like product

344
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:38,385
Speaker 7:  changes was what? Like they nailed it and then they

345
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:42,105
Speaker 7:  got completely blown up by not only pandemic, but their own sense

346
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:45,745
Speaker 7:  that they could literally increase cost by a thousand

347
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,325
Speaker 7:  and then somehow make it up on the backend, which no one can do.

348
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:53,525
Speaker 5:  To be fair, that's what all of the streaming services were doing at that

349
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:57,245
Speaker 5:  time, right? Like everybody was investing a ton

350
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:01,125
Speaker 5:  of money into, to making their own services. So Quibi was doing the exact

351
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,565
Speaker 5:  same thing as everybody else. How

352
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:03,605
Speaker 7:  Did it work out for all?

353
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:04,645
Speaker 5:  It worked out terribly.

354
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,685
Speaker 5:  The, the only difference is they were part of biggest, like everybody else

355
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:13,285
Speaker 5:  was es established studio. This wasn't like Dreamworks thing, this was

356
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:16,965
Speaker 5:  Katzenberg was like, I'm gonna go make my own new company to be at the start

357
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:20,365
Speaker 5:  of something new and I'll get everybody else involved. And then the pandemic

358
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:24,325
Speaker 5:  just cut 'em off at the knees. Like, I genuinely think

359
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:28,365
Speaker 5:  if it had come out in a different time, it would've lasted at least

360
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:29,125
Speaker 5:  six months longer.

361
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,765
Speaker 7:  Well, okay, so big bet from

362
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:33,365
Speaker 5:  Crz. There we go. Six

363
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:33,885
Speaker 7:  Extra months.

364
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:37,365
Speaker 2:  This is one of the, the big questions I want to, I was gonna get to, but

365
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:40,925
Speaker 2:  let's just do this now. Yeah. The, is there an alternate timeline in which

366
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:45,085
Speaker 2:  this thing was more successful? Feels like the question

367
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:48,365
Speaker 2:  of Quibi, right? Because when Quibi died, Katzenberg just a hundred percent

368
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:50,765
Speaker 2:  blamed the pandemic. Yes. Right. He's like, this would've worked except for

369
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:51,125
Speaker 2:  the pandemic.

370
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:55,125
Speaker 7:  Just, and I just wanna call out. He ended it in maybe the most noble

371
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,765
Speaker 7:  way of ending a thing. Oh, totally. That has raised us. He just gave the

372
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:59,845
Speaker 7:  money back to shareholders. Yeah. She was like, I'm not burning the rest

373
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:02,765
Speaker 7:  of your money. This isn't gonna happen. Here's your money back. Yeah. So

374
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:05,765
Speaker 7:  there's that. But he did fully blame the pandemic. I do feel like opening

375
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:09,245
Speaker 7:  the multiverse door around Covid is,

376
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,125
Speaker 7:  is just a rough, a rough game to play.

377
00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:12,845
Speaker 2:  Fair.

378
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:16,485
Speaker 7:  Many different decisions could have been made during that time.

379
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:20,765
Speaker 2:  Yes. But this is the unusual thing that literally lived and died entirely

380
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:24,245
Speaker 2:  inside of the pandemic, right? Like, it's not just that it's fortune changed,

381
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:28,245
Speaker 2:  it's that it's, its entire story is actually a pandemic story. Yeah.

382
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,885
Speaker 7:  So I, I'll just go back to what leaving the door closed.

383
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:35,845
Speaker 7:  YouTube existed, TikTok existed. The game that they were

384
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:39,765
Speaker 7:  trying to play had already been won by services

385
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:42,325
Speaker 7:  that, you know, You can have a lot. I have a lot of feelings about the fact

386
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:45,525
Speaker 7:  that these services do not pay very high rates. I think a lot of people in

387
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:47,685
Speaker 7:  Hollywood have a lot of feelings about the fact that these services do not

388
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:51,085
Speaker 7:  pay very high rates to their creators. Ka are trying to being like, we're

389
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,765
Speaker 7:  gonna pay much higher rates and then figure out how to get people to pay

390
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:57,405
Speaker 7:  for quality. Very noble. I think no matter what,

391
00:22:57,535 --> 00:23:00,885
Speaker 7:  maybe you get six more months. Like Kranz is saying, they would've run up

392
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:04,565
Speaker 7:  against the fact that YouTube exists. And YouTube is fundamentally what all

393
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:08,045
Speaker 7:  these these companies are competing with. And to some extent TikTok is,

394
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:12,005
Speaker 7:  would TikTok have, has grown as quickly minus the pandemic

395
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:15,645
Speaker 7:  is the multiverse door that is just like hard to figure out,

396
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:18,965
Speaker 7:  but hey, there's an app on your phone that's free full of infinite content

397
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:22,445
Speaker 7:  versus, Hey, there's an app on your phone you have to pay for that's full

398
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:26,205
Speaker 7:  of some content is at the end of the day, it's just like really hard to win

399
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:26,525
Speaker 7:  that game.

400
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:30,485
Speaker 2:  Right? And I think even, even then there was an understanding that they were

401
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:34,205
Speaker 2:  competing against infinite content, but the belief was that like we, we can

402
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:38,085
Speaker 2:  do it better and better will win. And crans, I feel like the thing that we've

403
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,765
Speaker 2:  learned a million times over now is that better doesn't actually always win.

404
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,925
Speaker 2:  Well also, I don't even know if better usually wins.

405
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:47,245
Speaker 5:  Quibb wasn't better. Like, like most of, most of the shows that were on

406
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:50,965
Speaker 5:  Quibi, not all a bunch of 'em were killed. I know Gizmoto had like a documentary.

407
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,205
Speaker 5:  I think VERGE had one, a bunch of us had it. We

408
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:55,845
Speaker 7:  We, no, it

409
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:56,005
Speaker 5:  Didn't happen.

410
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,725
Speaker 2:  Can we, can we pause on that really fast? I went back and was reading a bunch

411
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:01,725
Speaker 2:  of stuff and there were like three disclosures and stories that are like,

412
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:04,885
Speaker 2:  there have been conversations about a VERGE show on Quibi Eli, I need to

413
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:05,365
Speaker 2:  know the story.

414
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:11,405
Speaker 7:  So there was a polygon show on Quibi? Yes. A da you know, Quibi broke

415
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:15,045
Speaker 7:  its content up into three categories. There was the spotlights,

416
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:19,045
Speaker 7:  there were Quibi and then there was something called Daily

417
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:22,525
Speaker 7:  Essentials. And they thought Daily Essentials would be sticky and this all

418
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:25,685
Speaker 7:  made sense. Again, none of this was incorrect. You got your Halo things,

419
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:28,045
Speaker 7:  you got the stuff everybody watches every day that makes your product sticky.

420
00:24:28,305 --> 00:24:32,045
Speaker 7:  And then you got whatever weird garbage in the middle to find. That's how

421
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:35,645
Speaker 7:  you program anything. So Polygon had a new show about games and then they

422
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:38,485
Speaker 7:  wanted to do a tech show obviously. And so we were like in the mix and like

423
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:42,245
Speaker 7:  I had to disclose it constantly that like someone else is having a conversation

424
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:45,445
Speaker 7:  and that thing I keep talking about where I don't live on the business side

425
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:48,365
Speaker 7:  of our company and I don't tell them what to do and they can't tell me what

426
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:52,325
Speaker 7:  to do. Boy were we just like staring at each other through Bulletproof

427
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:56,285
Speaker 7:  Glass. Like, I was like, like I

428
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:59,245
Speaker 7:  don't wanna waste time on this. And that was where that ended basically.

429
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,565
Speaker 2:  Did you ever sit in a meeting about what The Verge Quibi show was

430
00:25:03,565 --> 00:25:03,805
Speaker 2:  gonna be

431
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:07,565
Speaker 7:  Only on the Vox Media side? Never with Quibi. Okay. Where they were like,

432
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:11,365
Speaker 7:  here's our thought. And I was like, weird. You know, like,

433
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:15,205
Speaker 7:  you, like you are gonna, like, we

434
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:19,005
Speaker 7:  give this away for free on our website. Why would anybody watch

435
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:22,285
Speaker 7:  this on Quibi? Who, that was basically where it ended for me.

436
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:26,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Can I read you a just the names of a few shows that did exist?

437
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And these, I actually am lifting directly from the CES presentation.

438
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:32,205
Speaker 2:  So this is not just shows that exist, this is shows that like Quibi was very

439
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:35,405
Speaker 2:  excited about. There was the, now there was

440
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:39,605
Speaker 2:  architecture, nightgowns was just a show, one

441
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:43,445
Speaker 2:  was called Beauty. Sure. There was one called 50 States of Fright

442
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:46,605
Speaker 2:  that was gonna be a whole anthology series that was a horror thing set in

443
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:50,565
Speaker 2:  a different state for each one for reasons. One was called Don't Look Deeper,

444
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:53,765
Speaker 2:  which I always liked. And then there was one just called Action scene.

445
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:57,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Just, it's just called Action Scene. The only one I remember watching

446
00:25:57,845 --> 00:26:01,045
Speaker 2:  was the one with one of the Hemsworth's where he was being hunted by Christophe

447
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:03,685
Speaker 2:  Waltz. That's the only one I remember. I liked that one. Yeah.

448
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:07,645
Speaker 5:  There was, there was a lot of garbage I think is the, is the best way to

449
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:11,445
Speaker 5:  say it. Most of none of it was very good. And, and after Quippy

450
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:14,805
Speaker 5:  kind of started to die, they started selling off a lot of it. Trying to like

451
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:15,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

452
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,685
Speaker 2:  Like Roku bought a bunch of it, right? Yeah.

453
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:20,805
Speaker 5:  Roku bought a bunch of it. And I think it is telling that none of

454
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:23,485
Speaker 5:  those shows survived. I think, I think that is telling. And I, and part of

455
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:26,445
Speaker 5:  that is probably, certainly Quibi a big part of that was the shows just weren't

456
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:27,005
Speaker 5:  very good.

457
00:26:27,515 --> 00:26:31,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Which by the way, we, we've talked about this a a bunch, so I'll just

458
00:26:31,405 --> 00:26:34,685
Speaker 2:  blow through the review stuff. That thing is, is I would say the main criticism

459
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:36,925
Speaker 2:  is basically there are a lot of people who are like, there's some really

460
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:40,085
Speaker 2:  cool technology here for a 1.0 app. It's actually pretty good. A lot of people

461
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:43,565
Speaker 2:  agreed with what Chris said about the, the tab people liked turnstile. Fun

462
00:26:43,565 --> 00:26:44,085
Speaker 2:  fact. Yeah,

463
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:44,565
Speaker 5:  It's

464
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:48,245
Speaker 2:  Neat. But overwhelmingly it's like, there's nothing here that is like particularly

465
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:52,245
Speaker 2:  compelling. It just Quibi didn't have like its thing, it didn't

466
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:56,205
Speaker 2:  have the House of Cards, it didn't have, its like HBO equivalent.

467
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:59,045
Speaker 2:  It just, it needed one winner and it just didn't have it.

468
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:00,685
Speaker 5:  No Mandalorian. Right.

469
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,605
Speaker 7:  And the interesting thing about that, going back to what Kranz was saying

470
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:06,925
Speaker 7:  about Hollywood is everyone wanted Katz's money.

471
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,805
Speaker 7:  No one wanted to bet against Kaz, but then there were all these like

472
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:15,605
Speaker 7:  contracts and labor questions about like, how do you cut a show up like this?

473
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:19,605
Speaker 7:  And so he absolutely bought everyone's like sea list work.

474
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:23,525
Speaker 7:  Yes. Yeah. Like, here what's the, what's the least risky thing that we can

475
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:27,485
Speaker 7:  sell to this thing that might blow up, but we don't want to bet against

476
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:30,805
Speaker 7:  it. Right. So everyone, everyone made a deal and took the money, but just

477
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:34,045
Speaker 7:  like very obviously they were putting up their like

478
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:35,565
Speaker 7:  c content

479
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,325
Speaker 5:  Again, the golden arm. Just go Google Quibi Golden

480
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:42,965
Speaker 5:  Arms, take a minute, Google it and you'll be like, oh, I get it. Yeah.

481
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:47,245
Speaker 2:  Were there any like, underrated winners? Kranz? Like do you have

482
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:49,965
Speaker 2:  any Quibi shows that you hold onto and you're like, actually that was a banger

483
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:50,565
Speaker 2:  and nobody knows.

484
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:54,765
Speaker 5:  I vaguely remember there was Reno 9 1 1, like sequel. Oh

485
00:27:54,765 --> 00:27:58,125
Speaker 5:  yeah. That was like, it was a nice little diversion and, and the, the House

486
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:01,885
Speaker 5:  Flipper show and I don't think the Steven Spielberg one ever came out. That

487
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:05,005
Speaker 5:  was the one that was like, we heard so much about before Quibi was, that

488
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:05,085
Speaker 5:  was

489
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:07,285
Speaker 2:  The one you could only watch at night. Yeah. Right. Wasn't that the thing?

490
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:07,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it was

491
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:11,165
Speaker 5:  Steven Spielberg's idea. He like came to them, was like, I hear you're doing

492
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:14,365
Speaker 5:  this stuff. Here's what I want to do. And that was like, I think the most

493
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:17,445
Speaker 5:  interesting part of this was listening to all these different filmmakers

494
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:21,205
Speaker 5:  actually really engage with tech tech the technology in a way they haven't

495
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:24,445
Speaker 5:  with other streaming platforms. Like even TikTok, they just haven't touched

496
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:28,245
Speaker 5:  like, oh there's an actual product here. I can fuck with the way they did

497
00:28:28,245 --> 00:28:31,485
Speaker 5:  with Quibi. But then none of it was successful and they never tried it again.

498
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:32,285
Speaker 5:  That

499
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:35,285
Speaker 2:  Sounds about right. Alright, before we get outta here, let's, let's roll

500
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:39,245
Speaker 2:  through the, the, the big questions that we do here on version history. What

501
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:40,485
Speaker 2:  was the best thing about this thing?

502
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:44,645
Speaker 5:  Turnstile. Legit. It was, it was, I think it's a fascinating

503
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:46,045
Speaker 5:  technology. I

504
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:49,125
Speaker 2:  Kind of agree. Like I don't, I don't know that it was a good idea, but it

505
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,115
Speaker 2:  was, it was awesome. Yeah.

506
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:54,875
Speaker 5:  It was just cool. You just look at it and you're like, this rips, I don't

507
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,035
Speaker 5:  know if it's gonna work. Yeah.

508
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,875
Speaker 2:  Like did it accomplish anything? I don't know.

509
00:28:58,265 --> 00:29:00,115
Speaker 7:  What are you two talking about?

510
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,395
Speaker 5:  David and I are just having the best time over here. What are you talking

511
00:29:03,395 --> 00:29:07,355
Speaker 5:  about? Turnstile was awesome. That was the only part of it.

512
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:11,715
Speaker 7:  You should You can go read the turnstile patent. They had very complicated

513
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:15,555
Speaker 7:  ideas about Yeah. How you should frame a video so you could turn it

514
00:29:15,615 --> 00:29:19,075
Speaker 7:  inside the viewport. That's cool. In the sense that like, you know, you like,

515
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:21,635
Speaker 7:  you look at a Rube Goldberg machine, you're like, that's a very impressive

516
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:25,395
Speaker 7:  or like a giant, you know those like videos where people have set up a huge

517
00:29:25,395 --> 00:29:28,235
Speaker 7:  amount of dominoes? Yeah. And you're like, I just wanna see 'em fall down.

518
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:31,755
Speaker 7:  Like I don't care about the the millions of hours you spent setting it up.

519
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:31,915
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

520
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:35,715
Speaker 5:  Turnstile is brain A SMR. It's just like, yeah, I just wanna

521
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:37,515
Speaker 5:  like soothingly think about this.

522
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:39,835
Speaker 2:  Nila what do you think was the best thing about Quibi?

523
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:43,785
Speaker 7:  Going back to what I said Casey's reaction was if you just remember that

524
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:47,585
Speaker 7:  period that was like, it was a dark

525
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,465
Speaker 7:  and boring time in tech in, in like a particular way. and it

526
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:55,385
Speaker 7:  like, here's this explosive amount of money and new ideas

527
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:59,465
Speaker 7:  and like we're gonna blow it up in the, we can do it with

528
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:03,105
Speaker 7:  just like confidence and bluster and a, an enormous amount of cash

529
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:07,205
Speaker 7:  was actually great. Like it was a good reminder

530
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:11,565
Speaker 7:  that You can have a new idea. And what contextually,

531
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:15,485
Speaker 7:  especially through the pandemic was like not a choice. And

532
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:19,445
Speaker 7:  so like there's that of it, but at the same time, like, do you,

533
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:22,805
Speaker 7:  I don't even remember this, at that same CES, Samsung

534
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:27,165
Speaker 7:  introduced a TV that rotated and like Katz was like furious

535
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,565
Speaker 7:  at it because he was like, they stole my idea and I was like, no dude. Like

536
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:34,085
Speaker 7:  all the videos are vertical. Yeah. Like they are reacting to

537
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:38,165
Speaker 7:  Instagram and TikTok. Like they didn't steal Quis

538
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:38,525
Speaker 7:  idea.

539
00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:42,445
Speaker 5:  Can you imagine people just getting up and flipping their tv like, oh I wonder

540
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:43,605
Speaker 5:  what this scene will look like this

541
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:46,645
Speaker 7:  Way, way. I mean they still have it. The the Frame TV You can buy a mount

542
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:50,285
Speaker 7:  for a Frame TV that auto rotates it when you play vertical video on it. I

543
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:53,485
Speaker 7:  have not bought such a mount, I've stared at it many, many times

544
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,085
Speaker 7:  and then tried to bring myself to a place where I think the right thing to

545
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:01,725
Speaker 7:  do is cast a vertical video to a TV that's motoring around

546
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:02,125
Speaker 7:  my,

547
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:05,125
Speaker 5:  We're we're staging an intervention. If you ever reached that place, like

548
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:05,605
Speaker 5:  emotionally

549
00:31:05,715 --> 00:31:09,645
Speaker 7:  This, let's do it. But like, we're many generations deep into those products

550
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:12,725
Speaker 7:  now because the companies understand that people are watching vertical video.

551
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:17,245
Speaker 7:  So I, I think the, the thing about it was the, the idea that Hollywood

552
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:21,005
Speaker 7:  would have some bluster here and that would be a counterbalance and it all

553
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:24,485
Speaker 7:  got blown up for all the reasons it got blown up and you just haven't seen

554
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:28,085
Speaker 7:  that. You've just sort of seen Hollywood like, like fall over

555
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:31,845
Speaker 7:  instead. And I, I would like to see some, some energy come

556
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:35,285
Speaker 7:  back. Fair enough. Alright. What was the worst thing about Quibi? I have

557
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:38,205
Speaker 7:  a very strong opinion about this, but I wanna know what you guys think. It's

558
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:40,125
Speaker 7:  the name. Yes. It's gotta be the name. There we go. Yeah. It's the name.

559
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:43,445
Speaker 7:  As I've said many times on this show, one of my strongest held beliefs is

560
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:46,885
Speaker 7:  that you cannot overcome a terrible name. Like I, I honestly it sounds like

561
00:31:46,925 --> 00:31:50,205
Speaker 7:  a bit, I believe it's so sincerely. I don't know man. iPad,

562
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:54,405
Speaker 7:  it's, it's fine. You can turn like a name into a good name.

563
00:31:54,465 --> 00:31:57,285
Speaker 7:  You cannot turn a terrible name. I see what you mean. You can, can't survive

564
00:31:57,355 --> 00:32:01,285
Speaker 7:  like a CAC or higher is fine. I got you. And but if you,

565
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:04,325
Speaker 7:  if you have an F name, you're it's never coming back. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I,

566
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:06,005
Speaker 7:  I agree with you. Quibi is an f name.

567
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:10,205
Speaker 5:  Quibi is one of the worst. I had so much fun

568
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:14,485
Speaker 5:  ripping on that name and everything I wrote about that site, like, like

569
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:18,245
Speaker 5:  just looking for puns, looking for, it's just a horrible, horrible name.

570
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:21,885
Speaker 7:  And the fact that they tried to make it that unit of time in the qui like

571
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:22,085
Speaker 7:  awful.

572
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:25,485
Speaker 5:  Like it was just, you were trying to, they were trying way too hard to make

573
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:26,085
Speaker 5:  Quibi happen.

574
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,005
Speaker 7:  Do you think that, do you think that they're like forever pissed that TikTok

575
00:32:30,145 --> 00:32:32,685
Speaker 7:  won? Like the Kesha spelling of TikTok?

576
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:37,045
Speaker 5:  Yes. I think that, I, like Keisha gets it, they should have gone

577
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,925
Speaker 5:  to her and been like, Hey, help us fix this name. But

578
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:43,125
Speaker 2:  I think if, if TikTok had come out being like, you know, it's like the clock

579
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,885
Speaker 2:  does right guys, it would've been worse. You know what

580
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:48,845
Speaker 5:  I mean? Yeah. If they'd done a Super Bowl ad where they're like, I'll be

581
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:50,485
Speaker 5:  there in a TikTok, like Yeah,

582
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:54,205
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Yeah. Maybe the Super Bowl ad was the worst thing. But yeah.

583
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:58,205
Speaker 5:  Actually could take it back. Super Bowl ad was the worst thing. It, it really

584
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:59,085
Speaker 5:  just put it all together.

585
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:03,525
Speaker 2:  If you could go back in time and make Quibi before somebody else made

586
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:04,685
Speaker 2:  Quibi, what would you do differently?

587
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:06,485
Speaker 5:  Make it before 2020.

588
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:10,205
Speaker 7:  Fair. You know that golden Arm thing is really interesting 'cause it went

589
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:14,125
Speaker 7:  viral. Just not on Quibi if you remember this. They they, they, it was

590
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,285
Speaker 7:  a Hollywood app. It was like heavily D DMed. You couldn't even screenshot

591
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:21,165
Speaker 7:  it. Yeah. And at one point they were like, oh we know people wanna screenshot

592
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:25,325
Speaker 7:  Quibi. We're gonna build this like convoluted system where

593
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:29,245
Speaker 7:  we pre-select screens and clips for you to share in

594
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:32,685
Speaker 7:  the, and it's like no, to just let people do like, let people make memes.

595
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:36,565
Speaker 7:  That's the one thing I would've changed is like, make this thing more social.

596
00:33:37,045 --> 00:33:38,005
Speaker 7:  'cause that was the thing they missed.

597
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:41,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I agree. I think that was gonna be my answer too, is like embrace

598
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:46,205
Speaker 2:  the other parts of TikTok. Right. Which are like, let people, I think

599
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:49,965
Speaker 2:  you, you probably can't like let people stitch and duet stuff like that

600
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:53,645
Speaker 2:  doesn't feel right. But like let people clip stuff and share clips. Let people

601
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:56,525
Speaker 2:  make memes out of it. Like you're talking about let people share screenshots

602
00:33:56,525 --> 00:34:00,285
Speaker 2:  like they had done so many different things. Even just with like the way

603
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:03,845
Speaker 2:  they've licensed content that it's like just blow up the idea of what it

604
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:07,645
Speaker 2:  means to like be a show even further. And I actually think there's like some

605
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,885
Speaker 2:  really interesting stuff you could do there. Also, I would name it not Quibi,

606
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:12,405
Speaker 7:  That's

607
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:14,965
Speaker 5:  Important. I realize Sam Raey directed that The

608
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:17,645
Speaker 2:  Golden arm speaking of C material. Yeah.

609
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:18,645
Speaker 5:  Who he

610
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:21,605
Speaker 7:  Just, I feel that the Golden Arm gets a bad rap. There's some, it's in my

611
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:24,765
Speaker 7:  brain and you know, I don't, I'm not gonna burn the calories to get it out,

612
00:34:24,765 --> 00:34:28,685
Speaker 7:  but it's like it was a joke in some way and it got decontextualized

613
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:32,125
Speaker 7:  as a joke into people believing Quibi thought it was serious and then it

614
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,285
Speaker 7:  became a different kind of joke. The

615
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:36,765
Speaker 5:  Actress was like, this was a joke. We were like making fun of people obsessed

616
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:40,405
Speaker 5:  with like tech and stuff. And instead everybody was like, Nope, you got a

617
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:44,005
Speaker 5:  dumb golden arm. I'm gonna laugh at the golden arm. Dumb. It's dumb.

618
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:48,525
Speaker 7:  I don't, again, it's in there somewhere. Yeah. And I, you know, someone else

619
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,005
Speaker 7:  can Google it and send it to us.

620
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:53,845
Speaker 2:  All right. We have two more Quibi questions. Question number one is could

621
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:57,485
Speaker 2:  you reboot it in 2024? Could Quibi post

622
00:34:57,765 --> 00:35:00,525
Speaker 2:  Pandemic post TikTok? Could we do Quibi now?

623
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:04,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah, but it would just be friends episodes cut up and put on there but

624
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:08,125
Speaker 5:  like paid for instead of Shadow put up on TikTok.

625
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,925
Speaker 2:  So it's just TikTok minus the impending copyright lawsuits basically.

626
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:12,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, exactly.

627
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:13,845
Speaker 2:  Nila, you're very pensive.

628
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:18,245
Speaker 7:  I want to say Yes. Really? Yeah. I'm, I'm trying to make

629
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:22,205
Speaker 7:  the case and it's much harder than I thought it would be. You

630
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:25,645
Speaker 7:  know, you don't wanna be a reflexive No, it would be really hard to raise

631
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:29,605
Speaker 7:  the money now. Quibi was a true Zer zero

632
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:32,805
Speaker 7:  and straight phenomenon. The content would be easier to get 'cause all the

633
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:35,765
Speaker 7:  other streamers are kind of falling apart and they want to sell things. But

634
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:38,965
Speaker 7:  getting people to download an app that isn't TikTok in 2024

635
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,245
Speaker 7:  and pay money for it seems hard.

636
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:45,485
Speaker 2:  Do you think the thesis that somebody at some point

637
00:35:45,555 --> 00:35:49,445
Speaker 2:  will do a really good high-end mostly vertical

638
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:53,165
Speaker 2:  streaming service is real? Like can Holly, will somebody

639
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:56,845
Speaker 2:  eventually make a vertical feature film starring Chris

640
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,725
Speaker 2:  Pratt that is like good and successful

641
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:02,805
Speaker 5:  Not as long as YouTube and, and TikTok and totally free content

642
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:06,845
Speaker 5:  exists, right? Like if there's no real clear path to making money

643
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:09,925
Speaker 5:  back on that, who is gonna invest the money in that?

644
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:13,925
Speaker 7:  You know what I think vertical video, I was reading a, a

645
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:17,965
Speaker 7:  story about fashion brands wanting things

646
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:21,845
Speaker 7:  shot on iPhones for their ad campaigns now 'cause it's more authentic, which

647
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:25,245
Speaker 7:  is fascinating for a million reasons. I think vertical video is

648
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:29,525
Speaker 7:  personal and horizontal is Hollywood. And I don't think You can cross

649
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:33,485
Speaker 7:  that gap. That's that's just my, that's my guess. I I I, I'm switching my

650
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:37,405
Speaker 7:  answer to no You can't do it. I try, I tried, let it be

651
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:40,845
Speaker 7:  said that I really tried and it you did try and it it's still not

652
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,845
Speaker 7:  good a good idea. YouTube still exists.

653
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:47,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, I don't know. Part of me wonders, I mean like YouTube and TikTok

654
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:51,285
Speaker 2:  are forever trying to find ways to get fancy content

655
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:55,445
Speaker 2:  and fancy content is forever trying to find ways to get the engagement

656
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:59,365
Speaker 2:  and excitement and user generated content of those other platforms. and it

657
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:02,685
Speaker 2:  does feel like at some point there might be a middle ground that makes sense

658
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:06,405
Speaker 2:  but maybe it's just the two ends of the spectrum and actually every time

659
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:07,925
Speaker 2:  you try to cross the two it doesn't work.

660
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:12,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The economics are just super weird. 'cause you, okay, you start making

661
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:16,325
Speaker 5:  movies for YouTube then you need contracts with the unions, which means

662
00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:20,045
Speaker 5:  why aren't all the people making stuff already for YouTube not getting

663
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:23,845
Speaker 5:  contracts and then it's like, oh boy, nobody wants to touch that.

664
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:24,365
Speaker 5:  Okay,

665
00:37:24,365 --> 00:37:27,005
Speaker 2:  Well then let me ask the question slightly differently. Will Netflix ever

666
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:30,565
Speaker 2:  make a vertical movie that is just

667
00:37:30,845 --> 00:37:31,005
Speaker 2:  vertical?

668
00:37:31,705 --> 00:37:31,925
Speaker 7:  No.

669
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:33,925
Speaker 2:  No. No way. Why

670
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:36,565
Speaker 7:  Not? Because where are you gonna distribute it? You're gonna distribute it

671
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:40,445
Speaker 7:  on phones only on Netflix, not TVs people. There's no way

672
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:43,805
Speaker 7:  anyone's gonna watch a vertical video on their tv. But what

673
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,045
Speaker 2:  If you have a TV that that turns

674
00:37:46,755 --> 00:37:50,285
Speaker 7:  This is it. Samsung's gonna buy the first vertical Netflix show.

675
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:53,365
Speaker 5:  Wait, what's Samsung's streaming service called that? That's where it's gonna

676
00:37:53,365 --> 00:37:54,245
Speaker 5:  appear. It's gonna,

677
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:55,325
Speaker 7:  It was called Milk Video.

678
00:37:58,395 --> 00:37:58,885
Speaker 5:  Alright.

679
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:03,525
Speaker 2:  Okay, last question. Does Quibi belong in the version history Hall of fame?

680
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:05,925
Speaker 7:  No. No, no, no, no.

681
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:07,445
Speaker 5:  No

682
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:10,525
Speaker 7:  Real strong reaction from you? Absolutely not.

683
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:12,445
Speaker 5:  Like,

684
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:16,445
Speaker 7:  Sorry. So in my, like my personal hall of fame, just 'cause

685
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:20,285
Speaker 7:  it was so nuts. Like it was all of tech and media were conspiring

686
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:22,045
Speaker 7:  to gaslight the American public.

687
00:38:22,345 --> 00:38:26,285
Speaker 2:  It definitely goes in the good content Hall of fame. Not itself,

688
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,765
Speaker 2:  but the content about it was, it was, it was a terrific year.

689
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:33,765
Speaker 5:  When we say Hall of Fame, what do we mean? Because like in a lot of

690
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:37,005
Speaker 5:  respects this is a Hall of Famer, just not like a good product.

691
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,445
Speaker 7:  What in which respects would you say this is Hall of Famer

692
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:43,245
Speaker 5:  Again, from what you said, like the drama The drama was

693
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:45,605
Speaker 7:  Was beautiful. Like the Clown Hall of Fame. Yeah,

694
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:47,525
Speaker 5:  The Trolls Hall of Fame.

695
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:52,685
Speaker 7:  No, there's no no, no. We got a high bar. The Hall of Fame is like an industry

696
00:38:52,715 --> 00:38:56,525
Speaker 7:  shaking there. You can that you remember what life was like before

697
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:57,725
Speaker 7:  and what life was like after.

698
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:59,765
Speaker 5:  So the Juicer Row goes in the Hall of Fame.

699
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:03,885
Speaker 7:  No, your idea of what a Hall of Fame is is very confusing

700
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,885
Speaker 2:  Here. Here's my, here's my early idea for the Hall of Fame. I think it has

701
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:10,245
Speaker 2:  to have either been very good, very important

702
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:14,565
Speaker 2:  or very interesting and you kind of need at least

703
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:18,045
Speaker 2:  two of those three things to be in the Hall of Fame. And I think Quibi was

704
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:21,045
Speaker 2:  just interesting. That's fair. Like it wasn't important and it wasn't good.

705
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,045
Speaker 2:  It was very interesting. But I feel like it doesn't quite like

706
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:29,485
Speaker 2:  move over. Like I, I've just, I don't know. The other failure that comes

707
00:39:29,485 --> 00:39:32,765
Speaker 2:  to mind was like Theranos Theranos I think was very interesting and very

708
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:36,325
Speaker 2:  important in that like what it meant in the bigger world

709
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:37,445
Speaker 2:  was a lot more than

710
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:38,925
Speaker 7:  This Hall of things sucks.

711
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:42,805
Speaker 2:  Theranos will probably never be on this show. Let's be clear.

712
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:45,165
Speaker 5:  We'll put the Game Boy or something in there. Yeah,

713
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:49,245
Speaker 2:  There will be good things someday we'll get to those.

714
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,565
Speaker 5:  The iPhone five is gonna go in there.

715
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:53,365
Speaker 7:  She's a deeply confusing hall of fame.

716
00:39:53,955 --> 00:39:56,525
Speaker 2:  It's gonna be great. I'm excited about it. Listen, these are just pilots.

717
00:39:56,525 --> 00:40:00,405
Speaker 2:  We're just figuring stuff out here. That's all. It's alright. Thank you

718
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:03,685
Speaker 2:  both for doing this with me. This was delightful. If you have an idea for

719
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:07,605
Speaker 2:  a better name than Quibi tell us and we'll bring it back and it'll be amazing.

720
00:40:07,915 --> 00:40:10,965
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take a break then we're gonna go back. We have more pilots,

721
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:11,685
Speaker 2:  we'll be right back.

722
00:42:19,565 --> 00:42:23,245
Speaker 2:  these things we've had teeny, tiny, inconsequential debates about which music

723
00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:26,725
Speaker 2:  app you should listen to. All of this stuff is very fun. And Liam James,

724
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:30,685
Speaker 2:  our producer, has been wanting to find a way to structure this for a while

725
00:42:31,025 --> 00:42:34,285
Speaker 2:  and kind of put us in a room, pit us against each other and have us like

726
00:42:34,295 --> 00:42:37,845
Speaker 2:  fight for real about which thing is better. So

727
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:41,925
Speaker 2:  that's essentially what this show is. Last week we talked about CarPlay versus

728
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:45,525
Speaker 2:  the automakers Neli and I got, I would say, more heated than either of us

729
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:49,205
Speaker 2:  expected. I definitely won, but you know, that's neither here nor there.

730
00:42:49,395 --> 00:42:53,205
Speaker 2:  This week the debate is about books, print books, digital books.

731
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:57,045
Speaker 2:  Who reads in the future and what do they do it with? Let's do it.

732
00:43:00,635 --> 00:43:04,125
Speaker 10:  Good day. I am Liam James, the moderator for today's debate. And my job

733
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,885
Speaker 10:  is to facilitate a debate between today's VERGE cast hosts on the

734
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,685
Speaker 10:  topic of books versus e-readers. First up, we have Alex

735
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:14,805
Speaker 10:  Kranz, deputy editor. Welcome to the debate, Alex.

736
00:43:15,305 --> 00:43:18,165
Speaker 5:  Hi. I am so happy to be here and destroy my competition

737
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:21,685
Speaker 10:  Versus Kranz. We have Kevin Nen, our features editor at The Verge. Welcome

738
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:22,485
Speaker 10:  Kevin. Thanks

739
00:43:22,485 --> 00:43:23,045
Speaker 2:  For having me.

740
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:26,965
Speaker 10:  Before we get started, I'd like to share the rules for our audience. Each

741
00:43:26,965 --> 00:43:30,365
Speaker 10:  person will make their case directly to The Vergecast audience. A virtual

742
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:34,405
Speaker 10:  coin toss will determine who gets to go first following open statements.

743
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:38,165
Speaker 10:  Each host will be given two minutes to answer my questions with an option

744
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:41,485
Speaker 10:  of up to a minute in rebuttal from the opposing host. The questions were

745
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:45,085
Speaker 10:  not shared in advance and our hosts may use the internet to confirm factual

746
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:49,045
Speaker 10:  details, but they use their limited time while doing so. Okay,

747
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:52,565
Speaker 10:  so with the rules outta the way, let's move on to the topic for today. We're

748
00:43:52,565 --> 00:43:55,885
Speaker 10:  gonna talk about eBooks versus printed books. Now,

749
00:43:56,465 --> 00:44:00,045
Speaker 10:  eBooks, as we know them today, have been around for decades,

750
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:03,885
Speaker 10:  believe it or not. In fact, You can go all the way back to the 1970s

751
00:44:03,905 --> 00:44:07,645
Speaker 10:  to get early examples and prototypes of what we now consider to be

752
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:11,685
Speaker 10:  an ebook. But it was in 2007 that Amazon released the first

753
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:15,085
Speaker 10:  Kindle and it kind of revolutionized the whole ebook market.

754
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:19,085
Speaker 10:  Kindle had wireless connectivity that allowed people to download books

755
00:44:19,645 --> 00:44:23,525
Speaker 10:  directly to the device, simplifying the whole process and making

756
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:27,445
Speaker 10:  it something that regular consumers could buy and use and enjoy.

757
00:44:27,985 --> 00:44:31,765
Speaker 10:  Now since then, tons of other companies have come out with similar devices

758
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:35,365
Speaker 10:  to the Kindle, but it's still a relatively small market

759
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:39,325
Speaker 10:  compared to actual printed books. So we ask the question,

760
00:44:39,615 --> 00:44:43,565
Speaker 10:  which is better, an ebook or a printed book. Now we move on

761
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:46,965
Speaker 10:  to our opening statements at virtual coin toss.

762
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:51,725
Speaker 10:  Let's see, Kevin is the visiting person, so he gets to pick

763
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:53,245
Speaker 10:  heads or tails. Kevin, heads

764
00:44:53,245 --> 00:44:54,245
Speaker 5:  Or tails. I see how it is.

765
00:44:55,295 --> 00:44:56,085
Speaker 11:  Let's do tails.

766
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:57,325
Speaker 10:  Tails. Rigged tails. Okay.

767
00:44:58,915 --> 00:45:02,045
Speaker 10:  Okay. It is tails. Kevin, would you like to go first or second?

768
00:45:03,265 --> 00:45:05,245
Speaker 11:  You know, I'm a gentleman. Alex, why don't you go first?

769
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:08,045
Speaker 5:  I see how it is. I see how it's,

770
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:12,245
Speaker 10:  Kevin wants that, that final word at the in the closing arguments. Okay.

771
00:45:12,245 --> 00:45:16,085
Speaker 10:  And with that, we'll go to our opening statements. Alex, you have two minutes.

772
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:20,525
Speaker 5:  Okay. Hey, gentle readers at The Verge. Listeners,

773
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:24,485
Speaker 5:  wonderful human beings. I'm here to talk to you about eBooks and why they

774
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:28,205
Speaker 5:  rule number one, You can put 'em on anything.

775
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:32,325
Speaker 5:  Can't do that with a book. Books you have to like take with you.

776
00:45:32,345 --> 00:45:36,325
Speaker 5:  You can only have one, two at a time, unless you're really strong. eBooks,

777
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:40,205
Speaker 5:  You can have like dozens depending on the storage of your e-reader or

778
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:44,085
Speaker 5:  phone. Also great about eBooks, they can be changed

779
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:48,245
Speaker 5:  at any time. So you know, if, if a company says, Hey, we need to

780
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:52,085
Speaker 5:  release an edit for this book because we, we messed something up,

781
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:55,565
Speaker 5:  they can just push that edit out and then you'll get the the fixed version

782
00:45:55,565 --> 00:45:58,605
Speaker 5:  of that book. And I think that's really great and can never go wrong for

783
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:02,045
Speaker 5:  anyone. Also, eBooks are really, really nice because

784
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:06,165
Speaker 5:  of accessibility. They are very, very easy to read.

785
00:46:06,755 --> 00:46:10,645
Speaker 5:  They are wonderful fonts out there that allow people with dyslexia to

786
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:14,325
Speaker 5:  read a little easier. There are ways to make the fonts bigger so people

787
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:18,325
Speaker 5:  with really bad eyesight can can see the text easier. And you

788
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:21,405
Speaker 5:  just don't have that kind of flexibility from a traditional book where you

789
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:24,765
Speaker 5:  usually have to have some sort of magnifying glass and then you have to walk

790
00:46:24,765 --> 00:46:28,205
Speaker 5:  around carrying a magnifying glass and then everyone judges you because you

791
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:31,565
Speaker 5:  have a magnifying glass. And I think you'd wanna avoid that most of the time.

792
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:35,765
Speaker 5:  And You can with something like the books Palmer or the

793
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:39,845
Speaker 5:  Kindle, you know, any of 'em. Or the Libra from Kobo. A

794
00:46:39,845 --> 00:46:43,765
Speaker 5:  lot of different companies make really, really nice e-readers that have really,

795
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:47,485
Speaker 5:  really nice displays. They have really, really

796
00:46:47,485 --> 00:46:51,325
Speaker 5:  good features in them. And again, they give you that flexibility

797
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:55,685
Speaker 5:  and I think that's what's most important about eBooks, is the

798
00:46:55,685 --> 00:46:59,535
Speaker 5:  flexibility they provide to you. How much longer do

799
00:46:59,575 --> 00:47:01,255
Speaker 5:  I go? I didn't look when I started.

800
00:47:01,715 --> 00:47:04,215
Speaker 10:  You had 11 seconds left, but now it's over. Oh, perfect.

801
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:06,415
Speaker 5:  Oh, and in conclusion,

802
00:47:08,235 --> 00:47:12,095
Speaker 5:  eBooks rule, regular books are fine. Thank you for your time.

803
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:15,415
Speaker 10:  Okay, Kevin, what say you? Well,

804
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:19,695
Speaker 11:  I just wanna start, you know, I feel like I'm being cast as a

805
00:47:19,845 --> 00:47:23,295
Speaker 11:  Luddite by my opponent. And I have to say, I do think eBooks

806
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:27,015
Speaker 11:  are an interesting technology. You know, I own a book's Palmer, like half

807
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:30,645
Speaker 11:  of The Verge staff now, and so I'll start with some concessions. eBooks

808
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:34,365
Speaker 11:  are faster, sometimes they are cheaper. We'll talk about that later.

809
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,165
Speaker 11:  And they are great for accessibility, especially for the visually impaired.

810
00:47:39,195 --> 00:47:43,125
Speaker 11:  That said, the book, the print book is an old and

811
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:46,845
Speaker 11:  near perfect technology. It's inexpensive, it's durable, it's

812
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:50,685
Speaker 11:  shareable, it's also accessible in a very different way. No

813
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:54,205
Speaker 11:  technology, no modern technology needed, no software

814
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:58,165
Speaker 11:  necessary, no updates. And also in a time when we're being not

815
00:47:58,165 --> 00:48:01,605
Speaker 11:  just in books, but across all of the media, we consume video games, tv,

816
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:05,805
Speaker 11:  film, music, a little more skeptical of our platforms and

817
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:09,005
Speaker 11:  what kind of access we'll have to our media in the future.

818
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:13,325
Speaker 11:  Print books give you that access forever. Owning a library of your own

819
00:48:13,565 --> 00:48:17,125
Speaker 11:  physical books means you'll be able to read them in perpetuity to sell them,

820
00:48:17,225 --> 00:48:21,205
Speaker 11:  to share them with friends, to get rid of them if you want. That's a kind

821
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:24,965
Speaker 11:  of freedom that is not offered by most of the ways we read digitally.

822
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:28,445
Speaker 11:  But I think most importantly, I think reading is about being deliberate.

823
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:32,565
Speaker 11:  Reading is not about reading as much or consuming as much as You

824
00:48:32,565 --> 00:48:36,245
Speaker 11:  can as quickly as possible. I think reading, good reading is about

825
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:40,005
Speaker 11:  good habits and discipline. A print book is isolated from the rest of the

826
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:43,085
Speaker 11:  things on your phone, and that's what makes the reading experience so powerful.

827
00:48:43,595 --> 00:48:47,005
Speaker 11:  Meaning that when you read, you'll be more focused and hopefully more patient

828
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:51,085
Speaker 11:  and you'll just take in more ideas. You'll have more enjoyment

829
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:54,765
Speaker 11:  out of what you're consuming. Maybe you'll even think about it outside of

830
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,725
Speaker 11:  consumption itself. You know, art is meant to be experienced. I also

831
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:02,685
Speaker 11:  think books allow you to be very deliberate with your time. The

832
00:49:02,885 --> 00:49:06,045
Speaker 11:  physical presence of a book on your nightstand is a reminder of what you're

833
00:49:06,045 --> 00:49:10,005
Speaker 11:  reading and what you've decided to spend your time with. I also think being

834
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:13,405
Speaker 11:  deliberate about what we choose to spend our time with is important too.

835
00:49:13,905 --> 00:49:17,805
Speaker 11:  We all know that Amazon's monopoly is in eBooks, and

836
00:49:18,285 --> 00:49:22,125
Speaker 11:  I think every publisher and author in bookstore would probably say that

837
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:25,685
Speaker 11:  it's not great for the ecosystem. You know, if you listener don't believe

838
00:49:25,685 --> 00:49:29,365
Speaker 11:  in monopolies, I think you have some skepticism about how much you buy

839
00:49:29,395 --> 00:49:33,365
Speaker 11:  from Amazon. There's also a whole ecosystem of independent bookstores that

840
00:49:33,365 --> 00:49:35,645
Speaker 11:  sell print books that support authors as well.

841
00:49:36,065 --> 00:49:37,165
Speaker 10:  And that is your time.

842
00:49:37,995 --> 00:49:38,485
Speaker 11:  Alright.

843
00:49:38,515 --> 00:49:39,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I'm ready.

844
00:49:39,615 --> 00:49:42,685
Speaker 10:  Kevin, you'll have an opportunity to finish that thought with your first

845
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:46,845
Speaker 10:  question. However, our first question goes to Alex Krantz. Alex,

846
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:50,325
Speaker 10:  in your opening statement you mentioned the ability to carry more books

847
00:49:50,325 --> 00:49:54,005
Speaker 10:  with you than is possible with printed books. This reminds me of the

848
00:49:54,355 --> 00:49:57,725
Speaker 10:  iPod, but in that category, music has very much moved

849
00:49:58,315 --> 00:50:01,685
Speaker 10:  into the digital realm. Why haven't books been able to do the same?

850
00:50:03,065 --> 00:50:07,045
Speaker 5:  You know, that monopoly Kevin mentioned, I, I think that

851
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,805
Speaker 5:  does actually have a lot to do with it. I think eBooks are not consumed at

852
00:50:10,805 --> 00:50:14,725
Speaker 5:  the same way that music is consumed. And so people are much more, as Kevin

853
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:18,445
Speaker 5:  said, deliberate with their choices. And there have been very, very few

854
00:50:18,445 --> 00:50:22,365
Speaker 5:  options for them historically, right? Historically it was Barnes

855
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:26,205
Speaker 5:  and Noble and Amazon and they both kept very, very tight control over their

856
00:50:26,215 --> 00:50:29,845
Speaker 5:  ebook marketplaces. That has become to change in the last few years.

857
00:50:30,275 --> 00:50:34,205
Speaker 5:  Also coinciding with a rise in reading of eBooks and a

858
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:37,965
Speaker 5:  rise in the sales of e reading devices. So I think things

859
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:42,005
Speaker 5:  are changing due to companies like Kobo due to choices like

860
00:50:42,285 --> 00:50:44,805
Speaker 5:  Libby, which allow you to check out eBooks from your library.

861
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:49,165
Speaker 10:  Kevin, you mentioned in your opening statement that books are a near

862
00:50:49,165 --> 00:50:52,965
Speaker 10:  perfect technology, but as we look towards younger generations,

863
00:50:53,265 --> 00:50:57,245
Speaker 10:  it seems like books have fallen off as a form of media

864
00:50:57,425 --> 00:51:01,045
Speaker 10:  and entertainment and pleasure. What does the publishing industry need to

865
00:51:01,045 --> 00:51:02,565
Speaker 10:  do to solve that problem?

866
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:06,765
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I actually don't think there's a lot of evidence to say that, you

867
00:51:06,765 --> 00:51:10,685
Speaker 11:  know, gen Z is AC actually reading less. It's just the

868
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:14,205
Speaker 11:  format that they're reading in. And honestly, you know, with Zoomers, however

869
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:18,045
Speaker 11:  they wanna read, that's great With me, I still think reading's just a greater

870
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:21,765
Speaker 11:  way to access a, a deeper level of idea and thought than, you know, maybe

871
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:26,245
Speaker 11:  consuming a lot of YouTube content. But I think it's, publishers

872
00:51:26,245 --> 00:51:30,085
Speaker 11:  just need to think about what like younger readers actually are interested

873
00:51:30,105 --> 00:51:33,965
Speaker 11:  in. I think the industry itself is run by a lot of like much older

874
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,645
Speaker 11:  people that don't understand the youth. So I think just understanding the

875
00:51:37,645 --> 00:51:41,565
Speaker 11:  trends and what young people are actually interested in publishing

876
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:45,125
Speaker 11:  books around those topic areas is probably the waste place to start. Because

877
00:51:45,245 --> 00:51:49,205
Speaker 11:  I actually don't think the resistance to reading has anything to do

878
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:52,685
Speaker 11:  with books themselves, but what publishers are choosing to put out in the

879
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:53,085
Speaker 11:  landscape

880
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,485
Speaker 10:  Krantz opportunity to respond.

881
00:51:55,915 --> 00:51:59,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think Kevin's wrong and that the youth

882
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:03,685
Speaker 5:  aren't reading as much because they wanna read on their phones.

883
00:52:04,225 --> 00:52:07,805
Speaker 5:  No, that's not true. We're like, you look at TikTok, you look at book talk

884
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:11,525
Speaker 5:  and there is a lot of reading of actual physical books there, but they're

885
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:14,845
Speaker 5:  also really, really pretty. And they'll show you just the paper side. They'll

886
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:18,565
Speaker 5:  never show you the spine, but, but they, they wanna show those books

887
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:22,645
Speaker 5:  off. However, the majority of people are not TikTok creators, they're

888
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:26,325
Speaker 5:  just people living in their home, particularly Gen Z and

889
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:30,645
Speaker 5:  they enjoy reading other ways, right? The phone is the center

890
00:52:30,645 --> 00:52:34,405
Speaker 5:  point of their technological universe and having those opportunities

891
00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:38,325
Speaker 5:  there are really, really important. But I do agree that there has been a

892
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:39,285
Speaker 5:  struggle due

893
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:39,645
Speaker 10:  Time

894
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:43,085
Speaker 5:  To the fact that Amazon, that time, that's, it's all Amazon's fault.

895
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:46,485
Speaker 11:  We're actually gonna end up in agreement here. Yeah, we're

896
00:52:46,485 --> 00:52:48,965
Speaker 5:  Gonna be like, actually both are great. Amazon's the real villain.

897
00:52:49,595 --> 00:52:53,325
Speaker 10:  Okay. Kranz, the next question is for you. I wanna stick on

898
00:52:53,955 --> 00:52:57,485
Speaker 10:  book sales for a moment here. One of the more harsh

899
00:52:57,615 --> 00:53:01,245
Speaker 10:  criticisms that is perennial to eBooks is

900
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:05,605
Speaker 10:  the cost of them that they are oftentimes, if not

901
00:53:06,035 --> 00:53:09,445
Speaker 10:  usually cheaper than their printed counterparts. Apple

902
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:13,325
Speaker 10:  notoriously colluded with other book publishers to try

903
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:17,485
Speaker 10:  to raise the cost of eBooks when they introduced their own

904
00:53:17,555 --> 00:53:21,525
Speaker 10:  digital book platform. Do you think authors are

905
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:25,125
Speaker 10:  getting the short end of the stick when

906
00:53:25,565 --> 00:53:27,285
Speaker 10:  consumers buy eBooks?

907
00:53:27,795 --> 00:53:31,605
Speaker 5:  Depends on their publisher. Honestly, I think authors are, are

908
00:53:31,605 --> 00:53:34,445
Speaker 5:  highly dependent on their publishers and the deals they make with their publishers.

909
00:53:35,195 --> 00:53:38,885
Speaker 5:  Both Kevin and I are published authors, Kevin with his name Meander a

910
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:42,765
Speaker 5:  pseudonym because it was a romance novel. And what you find

911
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:46,685
Speaker 5:  out is that it that You can make a lot of money through digital

912
00:53:46,735 --> 00:53:50,405
Speaker 5:  sales and we've seen really good examples of that usually involving a person

913
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:53,925
Speaker 5:  boning some sort of sentient dinosaur or sign.

914
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:58,205
Speaker 5:  But you know, it happens, it's out there. And the

915
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:02,245
Speaker 5:  worst part of this is that I think the publishers are still getting in the

916
00:54:02,245 --> 00:54:05,565
Speaker 5:  way and taking a significant cut and trying to make sure that the cut that

917
00:54:05,565 --> 00:54:08,965
Speaker 5:  the authors receive via eBooks is the same as via

918
00:54:09,075 --> 00:54:12,325
Speaker 5:  traditional print, despite the fact that traditional print has a much higher

919
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:12,805
Speaker 5:  cost.

920
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,645
Speaker 10:  Kevin, a chance to respond.

921
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:18,525
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I'd like to respond. This is strange because I actually, in some ways

922
00:54:18,605 --> 00:54:22,525
Speaker 11:  I think I'll be siding with crayons on this, but ebook

923
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:26,325
Speaker 11:  royalties are actually by percentage higher for

924
00:54:26,395 --> 00:54:30,045
Speaker 11:  authors than they are in the print book space for hardcover an

925
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:33,525
Speaker 11:  ebook, it usually mets out to about the same, but once he gets a paperback,

926
00:54:33,585 --> 00:54:37,325
Speaker 11:  you know, selling an ebook versus a paperback actually nets a lot more for

927
00:54:37,325 --> 00:54:40,885
Speaker 11:  the author on a per unit level. But I actually don't think

928
00:54:40,885 --> 00:54:44,845
Speaker 11:  publishers are the villain here. They do a lot to protect, I think you

929
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:48,805
Speaker 11:  know, apple and you know, PRH did collude to raise

930
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:52,565
Speaker 11:  the cost of books, but it was like to protect, you know,

931
00:54:52,865 --> 00:54:56,805
Speaker 11:  an existing infrastructure of cost that was being driven down by the digital

932
00:54:56,805 --> 00:55:00,605
Speaker 11:  marketplace by Amazon. So publishers do

933
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:04,285
Speaker 11:  understand that like when they're healthy, authors are healthy too and they

934
00:55:04,285 --> 00:55:07,085
Speaker 11:  do a lot more to protect the interest of authors than Amazon does.

935
00:55:07,825 --> 00:55:08,885
Speaker 5:  So it's Amazon's fault.

936
00:55:09,635 --> 00:55:10,525
Speaker 11:  It's Amazon's fault.

937
00:55:12,115 --> 00:55:15,965
Speaker 10:  Okay. Moving on to the more the technology

938
00:55:16,155 --> 00:55:19,685
Speaker 10:  side of these, of these two technologies, the next question is for you Kevin.

939
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:24,645
Speaker 10:  What do books provide to the reader that eBooks

940
00:55:24,645 --> 00:55:24,845
Speaker 10:  cannot?

941
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:29,125
Speaker 11:  I'm not sure if they provide something that the ebook doesn't, but I do

942
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:32,645
Speaker 11:  think the experience of reading a print book is much richer. I actually

943
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:36,445
Speaker 11:  think, you know, we talked earlier about how young people, but I actually

944
00:55:36,445 --> 00:55:40,085
Speaker 11:  think everyone has struggles with this. Like I think we all wish we read

945
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:43,125
Speaker 11:  more. I think we all wish we had time to read more. I think we all wish

946
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:47,005
Speaker 11:  we had the patience and space to read more and I think the print book

947
00:55:47,015 --> 00:55:50,845
Speaker 11:  gives you that space more so than reading off your phone or

948
00:55:50,925 --> 00:55:54,845
Speaker 11:  a device or something that can do many things. I know we've talked

949
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:58,805
Speaker 11:  a little bit about E ink devices or dedicated digital reading

950
00:55:58,805 --> 00:56:02,765
Speaker 11:  devices. Some of them are very good, but I just think the focus,

951
00:56:02,955 --> 00:56:06,885
Speaker 11:  even to just choose one book and stick with it is a very

952
00:56:07,205 --> 00:56:11,005
Speaker 11:  powerful thing. A print device or a print book does that, a device doesn't

953
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:14,765
Speaker 11:  give you the device just gives you too much choice and

954
00:56:14,765 --> 00:56:17,205
Speaker 11:  it's just kind of, you don't want the same feeling of scrolling Netflix

955
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,245
Speaker 11:  endlessly when you're trying to read a book

956
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:23,005
Speaker 10:  Kranz instead of giving you a chance to respond. I'm gonna ask you a similar

957
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:27,005
Speaker 10:  question. eBooks provide many features on top of the reading

958
00:56:27,055 --> 00:56:30,565
Speaker 10:  experience. Some of these could be criticized as

959
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:34,965
Speaker 10:  distractions, some of them could be described as

960
00:56:35,555 --> 00:56:39,285
Speaker 10:  providing new ways to help readers understand

961
00:56:39,705 --> 00:56:43,085
Speaker 10:  or gain knowledge about what writers are talking about.

962
00:56:43,755 --> 00:56:47,205
Speaker 10:  What is essential to you as an ebook reader

963
00:56:47,865 --> 00:56:51,765
Speaker 10:  in terms of these features? What is the the minimum required?

964
00:56:52,465 --> 00:56:55,365
Speaker 5:  All right, first I'm happy to answer that question, but I'm gonna take five

965
00:56:55,365 --> 00:56:58,765
Speaker 5:  seconds to respond to Kevin. And one thing's books provide that eBooks don't

966
00:56:58,765 --> 00:57:02,725
Speaker 5:  is paper cuts. So take that Kevin. I've never gotten a,

967
00:57:02,725 --> 00:57:03,045
Speaker 5:  is that

968
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:03,765
Speaker 11:  To you often?

969
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:07,725
Speaker 5:  Never gotten a paper cut from my books Palmer that I've had for two days,

970
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:12,085
Speaker 5:  but I have gotten a paper cut from, is a yearbook in my childhood

971
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:15,805
Speaker 5:  bedroom? It sucks. Anyway, that was more than five seconds. But what really

972
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:19,285
Speaker 5:  matters about eBooks is, is the flexibility. I think that flexibility is

973
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:23,245
Speaker 5:  so, so, so, so crucial to e-readers and, and that ability to be able to switch.

974
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:26,765
Speaker 5:  For me it's also, I read really, really quickly and

975
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:30,725
Speaker 5:  I tend to read one book at a time. Like the the focus problem that Kevin

976
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:33,885
Speaker 5:  has discussed. I don't have myself and so I like to read a book and then

977
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:37,725
Speaker 5:  just move on to the next one. And I hate having to wait

978
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:41,645
Speaker 5:  because I want everything now and the fact that I get instant access

979
00:57:41,645 --> 00:57:44,725
Speaker 5:  with an e-reader and I don't have to worry about is somebody gonna deliver

980
00:57:44,725 --> 00:57:48,045
Speaker 5:  it to my doorstep? Do I need to go down to the bookstore to buy it? I can

981
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:51,285
Speaker 5:  just have it. And oftentimes while still paying an independent bookstore

982
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:55,405
Speaker 5:  and making sure they get a cut of the profit is just something really rewarding

983
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:59,565
Speaker 5:  about the ebook and digital books in general. Great. and it doesn't give

984
00:57:59,565 --> 00:58:00,205
Speaker 5:  you paper cuts,

985
00:58:01,695 --> 00:58:03,485
Speaker 10:  Kevin, a chance to respond. I just

986
00:58:03,485 --> 00:58:06,085
Speaker 11:  Wanna say I don't think I've ever gotten a paper cut from reading a book.

987
00:58:06,785 --> 00:58:07,725
Speaker 5:  You're going to now

988
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,845
Speaker 11:  I think you

989
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:13,645
Speaker 5:  Need to be reading more of those like really big like tabletop books.

990
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:17,525
Speaker 5:  You know, with the super thick pages you'll be getting a ton of paper cuts

991
00:58:17,525 --> 00:58:20,845
Speaker 5:  that TaeKwonDo one I had when fifth grade. Oh my god.

992
00:58:21,385 --> 00:58:22,205
Speaker 5:  All over my fingers.

993
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:24,565
Speaker 11:  But yeah, no, no response from me there.

994
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:30,485
Speaker 10:  And our final question for you, Kevin, while

995
00:58:30,485 --> 00:58:34,445
Speaker 10:  doing the research for this episode, one of the things I saw that came up

996
00:58:34,555 --> 00:58:38,285
Speaker 10:  more often than not for the side for

997
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:41,325
Speaker 10:  printed books is the experience of marginalia.

998
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:46,005
Speaker 10:  I know that eBooks have this ability now, but many people

999
00:58:46,355 --> 00:58:50,205
Speaker 10:  that I read opinions of fought that it's

1000
00:58:50,205 --> 00:58:54,165
Speaker 10:  just nothing in the, just not even close.

1001
00:58:54,955 --> 00:58:58,885
Speaker 10:  It's an order of magnitude different to them. Do

1002
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:02,645
Speaker 10:  you think marginality is important? Is that something as a

1003
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:06,525
Speaker 10:  reader you participate in? And do you think that

1004
00:59:06,525 --> 00:59:09,925
Speaker 10:  is part of what makes the book on your perfect technology?

1005
00:59:10,595 --> 00:59:14,485
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I mean the marginalia in an ebook reading experience

1006
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:18,565
Speaker 11:  is one that's just imitated from the print book, right? So I don't

1007
00:59:18,565 --> 00:59:21,765
Speaker 11:  think it surpasses it unless you feel very strongly about your highlights

1008
00:59:21,765 --> 00:59:25,645
Speaker 11:  sinking to the cloud, in which case I would urge you to read digitally

1009
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:29,525
Speaker 11:  then. But no, I think writing in the margins highlighting, I think

1010
00:59:29,655 --> 00:59:33,325
Speaker 11:  those physical acts actually help in terms of helping you

1011
00:59:33,575 --> 00:59:37,485
Speaker 11:  synthesize and remember things that you're experiencing. My issue with

1012
00:59:37,515 --> 00:59:41,445
Speaker 11:  reading on electronic devices is that the advantage of them

1013
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:44,525
Speaker 11:  is that they are frictionless, but I actually think friction is a good thing

1014
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:48,165
Speaker 11:  When you're taking in art, when you're taking in information, when you're

1015
00:59:48,165 --> 00:59:51,325
Speaker 11:  trying to learn, when you're trying to remember things, writing in the margins

1016
00:59:51,385 --> 00:59:55,365
Speaker 11:  is just a great way actually to remember things. It's why you take notes

1017
00:59:55,545 --> 00:59:58,965
Speaker 11:  in school. It's not just so You can refer to them later. It's 'cause it

1018
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:02,365
Speaker 11:  does something to your brain that helps you process it. And I think that

1019
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:06,285
Speaker 11:  experience isn't quite as replicated in e reading as it is

1020
01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:09,445
Speaker 11:  in a print book. That said, I'm someone that writes really stupid things

1021
01:00:09,445 --> 01:00:13,045
Speaker 11:  in the margin. So I'll revisit some of my books and I've just written LOL.

1022
01:00:13,465 --> 01:00:17,365
Speaker 5:  Can I respond? Yes. Okay, my response. Why are

1023
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:20,445
Speaker 5:  you all writing in your books? Get a notebook.

1024
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:24,685
Speaker 5:  Everybody just, just go get a notebook, put the little page number down.

1025
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:29,045
Speaker 5:  Do the librarians and booksellers in your lives a favor. Don't go writing

1026
01:00:29,105 --> 01:00:32,685
Speaker 5:  in your books. That's just that that's I'm, that's not even an argument.

1027
01:00:32,705 --> 01:00:35,805
Speaker 5:  I'm not, I'm just upset everyone's writing in their books to the point that

1028
01:00:35,805 --> 01:00:39,125
Speaker 5:  we have a whole word described for it. It's now a feature on a kindle.

1029
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,805
Speaker 10:  Okay, fascinating. POV from you both. It's time now to move on to

1030
01:00:48,805 --> 01:00:52,045
Speaker 10:  closing statements and at first we have Alex Kranz.

1031
01:00:52,595 --> 01:00:56,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean I could just say eBooks rule and regular books

1032
01:00:56,415 --> 01:00:59,805
Speaker 5:  drool. I think that would be like a really evocative statement here because

1033
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:03,365
Speaker 5:  eBooks do rule and like if a ebook gets read,

1034
01:01:03,795 --> 01:01:07,605
Speaker 5:  it's fine, you just dry it off. Or you buy a new e-reader and you still have

1035
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:11,325
Speaker 5:  all your books. You leave your copy of King Arthur and the Round Knights

1036
01:01:11,325 --> 01:01:15,085
Speaker 5:  of the round table out on the the porch and it gets totally

1037
01:01:15,145 --> 01:01:18,245
Speaker 5:  soaked. And then 20 years later you're like, why are my pages all weird?

1038
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:22,325
Speaker 5:  That sucks. That's why books suck compared to eBooks. But really

1039
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:26,405
Speaker 5:  the truth of it is, is that even though eBooks are, I think substantially

1040
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:30,245
Speaker 5:  better in a market improvement over the reg, the traditional book, what's

1041
01:01:30,245 --> 01:01:34,165
Speaker 5:  really, really nice about them is that they provide for a lot of people,

1042
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:38,405
Speaker 5:  everyone who says that they make you ill or sick or something like that is

1043
01:01:38,405 --> 01:01:41,725
Speaker 5:  generally proven to just be like a normal book nerd.

1044
01:01:42,385 --> 01:01:46,365
Speaker 5:  And You can technically write in the marginalia, is that what it's

1045
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:50,245
Speaker 5:  called? You can write in your books on an ebook, but you shouldn't.

1046
01:01:50,245 --> 01:01:53,765
Speaker 5:  And You can just go get a notebook and You can just write in it like a five

1047
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:57,245
Speaker 5:  star binder. You get yourself a trapper keeper, you write all your notes

1048
01:01:57,245 --> 01:02:00,725
Speaker 5:  in there, You can organize them, it'll look beautiful. You put little stickers

1049
01:02:00,785 --> 01:02:03,725
Speaker 5:  on it. I think that is really, really and crucial. And You can do that with

1050
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:07,405
Speaker 5:  both books and eBooks. But ultimately I just

1051
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:11,645
Speaker 5:  think that eBooks are a really, really powerful new medium that

1052
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:14,925
Speaker 5:  provides opportunities for a lot of people that might not other have otherwise

1053
01:02:14,925 --> 01:02:18,605
Speaker 5:  have the opportunities or access to libraries which are an endangered species

1054
01:02:19,145 --> 01:02:23,125
Speaker 5:  in the United States. So support your Republic library. Go check

1055
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:27,085
Speaker 5:  out some books, eBooks specifically, and that's why eBooks are the

1056
01:02:27,085 --> 01:02:27,245
Speaker 5:  best.

1057
01:02:28,185 --> 01:02:31,885
Speaker 10:  And a note for our listeners that were born in the 21st century, A

1058
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:35,645
Speaker 10:  trapper keeper is a fancy binder from

1059
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:39,605
Speaker 10:  the nine or I believe the early nineties that had a fabric

1060
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:41,645
Speaker 10:  covering and a zipper and there

1061
01:02:41,645 --> 01:02:42,565
Speaker 5:  Was unicorns,

1062
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:46,445
Speaker 10:  Unicorns, pockets, all kinds of things. Alright Kevin,

1063
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:50,245
Speaker 11:  I don't think I'm gonna reach the kind of person who thinks only about efficiency.

1064
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:53,805
Speaker 11:  It's true. The ebook is a more efficient form of a book, whatever that means.

1065
01:02:54,465 --> 01:02:57,445
Speaker 11:  I'm here appeal to the reader who doesn't think of books as merely content.

1066
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:01,125
Speaker 11:  I wanna speak to the person that sees not just the value of books as a medium,

1067
01:03:01,385 --> 01:03:04,645
Speaker 11:  but also wants to see a future where making books as healthy and sustainable

1068
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:07,925
Speaker 11:  because those are the conditions I think we should hope for, for all artists,

1069
01:03:07,995 --> 01:03:11,765
Speaker 11:  writers, and creative people to say otherwise is to wish for future where

1070
01:03:11,885 --> 01:03:15,405
Speaker 11:  a large hydraulic press smushes everything violently into an iPad.

1071
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:19,805
Speaker 11:  I'm an author, Kranz is an author. Many of our friends are authors of

1072
01:03:19,805 --> 01:03:23,765
Speaker 11:  fiction, of non-fiction. And for the friends that are a little crazier of

1073
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:27,565
Speaker 11:  poetry, not one of them would prefer you read their work as an ebook

1074
01:03:27,565 --> 01:03:31,085
Speaker 11:  instead of print. No editor, no publisher would prefer you read the digital

1075
01:03:31,085 --> 01:03:34,965
Speaker 11:  version. Every independent bookstore could use your business and you should

1076
01:03:34,965 --> 01:03:38,925
Speaker 11:  shop there unless you want a future that's just Amazon. And for the folks

1077
01:03:38,925 --> 01:03:41,965
Speaker 11:  out there who wanna save a few bucks because their imagination is that the

1078
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:45,885
Speaker 11:  ebook is less expensive, I think that's the logic of a cheap person. It's

1079
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:48,565
Speaker 11:  the same kind of argument that leads people to leave bad tips at restaurants

1080
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:52,365
Speaker 11:  because the core of that argument is entitlement and a lack of

1081
01:03:52,365 --> 01:03:55,485
Speaker 11:  appreciation of understanding of what goes into making the things you enjoy.

1082
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:59,925
Speaker 11:  In this moment where AI threatens creative industries, I would challenge

1083
01:03:59,925 --> 01:04:03,885
Speaker 11:  us to think about the people who make the art we enjoy to challenge us and

1084
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:05,765
Speaker 11:  make us think differently. Thank you.

1085
01:04:06,705 --> 01:04:10,165
Speaker 5:  You waited until the end to call me out like that.

1086
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:10,885
Speaker 10:  Wow.

1087
01:04:11,725 --> 01:04:14,285
Speaker 5:  I can't, and I don't even have a rebuttal time.

1088
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:15,405
Speaker 11:  I

1089
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:16,525
Speaker 5:  Just think this is outrageous.

1090
01:04:17,195 --> 01:04:20,885
Speaker 10:  Only a minute and 26 seconds too. That was, that was impressive. Oh yeah.

1091
01:04:20,885 --> 01:04:23,285
Speaker 11:  It's like I don't care about winning this debate. I just want people to

1092
01:04:23,285 --> 01:04:24,725
Speaker 11:  think Alex Kranz is a bad tipper,

1093
01:04:27,575 --> 01:04:27,925
Speaker 5:  Which

1094
01:04:27,925 --> 01:04:28,685
Speaker 11:  Isn't even true,

1095
01:04:30,785 --> 01:04:34,725
Speaker 5:  Man. I'm gonna get so much hate now for tipping 5%. It was one time guys,

1096
01:04:35,475 --> 01:04:37,645
Speaker 5:  Alex, it was one time all restaurant. It's an accident.

1097
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,765
Speaker 10:  Okay, Vergecast listeners, what do you think? Did Kranz make

1098
01:04:42,765 --> 01:04:46,525
Speaker 10:  the case for eBooks or was Kevin Wright about the perfect

1099
01:04:46,535 --> 01:04:50,165
Speaker 10:  technology that is printed books? Let us know what you think by calling

1100
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,045
Speaker 10:  8 6 6 VERGE one one

1101
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:12,995
Speaker 12:  there was no camera on it so I could use it where I was working. But the

1102
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:16,875
Speaker 12:  thing that gets me is having music that I can carry around

1103
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:20,075
Speaker 12:  with me and not have some sort of external

1104
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:24,275
Speaker 12:  attachment, whether that be Bluetooth or wifi. And I'm

1105
01:07:24,275 --> 01:07:28,155
Speaker 12:  just wondering, is there any other solution other than buying

1106
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:31,995
Speaker 12:  an old old iPod off of eBay and using

1107
01:07:31,995 --> 01:07:35,315
Speaker 12:  that? Is there no modern solution? Because it seems to be that everything

1108
01:07:35,335 --> 01:07:39,195
Speaker 12:  has Bluetooth or wifi and what I'm looking for is

1109
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:42,955
Speaker 12:  just a strict MP three player that has headphones

1110
01:07:43,015 --> 01:07:46,475
Speaker 12:  out like a three and a half millimeter headphones out, like no Bluetooth,

1111
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:50,555
Speaker 12:  no wifi, something I have to either load on a SD card

1112
01:07:50,575 --> 01:07:54,315
Speaker 12:  or maybe plug it into my computer to add the music. But I was just

1113
01:07:54,315 --> 01:07:57,955
Speaker 12:  wondering, maybe somebody somewhere inside your place of business

1114
01:07:58,415 --> 01:08:02,075
Speaker 12:  has an answer or a fix. If I ever hear from back, hear back from you, I

1115
01:08:02,075 --> 01:08:05,755
Speaker 12:  would be super ecstatic to see what you guys come up with. Thanks, I love

1116
01:08:05,755 --> 01:08:06,035
Speaker 12:  you guys.

1117
01:08:06,745 --> 01:08:10,195
Speaker 2:  Okay, so every once in a while we get a question on The Vergecast hotline

1118
01:08:10,195 --> 01:08:13,875
Speaker 2:  that sends somewhere between one and all of us, just

1119
01:08:14,225 --> 01:08:17,965
Speaker 2:  deep down a rabbit hole. This time that happens to our

1120
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:19,605
Speaker 2:  producer Andrew Marino. Hi Andrew.

1121
01:08:19,985 --> 01:08:20,405
Speaker 13:  Hi David.

1122
01:08:20,905 --> 01:08:21,885
Speaker 2:  So what'd you find this time?

1123
01:08:22,275 --> 01:08:25,405
Speaker 13:  Okay, so yeah, this was actually kind of hard. Like a lot of this stuff

1124
01:08:25,505 --> 01:08:29,285
Speaker 13:  is connected to the internet. You have to use Bluetooth to connect

1125
01:08:29,465 --> 01:08:29,885
Speaker 13:  to it.

1126
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:35,525
Speaker 13:  Sony still makes Walkman's and a lot of them

1127
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:38,725
Speaker 13:  are very high end. They're basically an Android phone.

1128
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:43,005
Speaker 13:  It's like has Android on it, touchscreen, that's all connected to the internet.

1129
01:08:43,265 --> 01:08:47,165
Speaker 13:  But they do make one Walkman for $80.

1130
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,485
Speaker 13:  It looks like an iPod Nano. Yes. Okay.

1131
01:08:49,485 --> 01:08:52,245
Speaker 2:  Wait, can I just quibble with that for just a quick second? So you, you just

1132
01:08:52,325 --> 01:08:54,725
Speaker 2:  held it up to the camera as we're recording and what I would say is like

1133
01:08:54,725 --> 01:08:58,525
Speaker 2:  if you imagine an iPod nano, but like the iPod nano you would

1134
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:02,245
Speaker 2:  find like on Temu or like if you searched on on Alibaba

1135
01:09:02,355 --> 01:09:06,165
Speaker 2:  Express, like you, it's, it's a real, like we have iPod nano at home

1136
01:09:06,195 --> 01:09:08,725
Speaker 2:  kind of situation, at least from what I can tell. Yes,

1137
01:09:08,725 --> 01:09:11,485
Speaker 13:  It's an iPod nano without a scroll wheel. It's,

1138
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:13,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's, that's right.

1139
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:16,725
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Sony still makes it like a Walkman MP three player.

1140
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:21,045
Speaker 13:  What is great about it, it is not connected to the internet. It does not

1141
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:24,725
Speaker 13:  have Bluetooth. It is exactly what this person wants. It has

1142
01:09:24,795 --> 01:09:28,485
Speaker 13:  only eight gigabytes of memory on it. It's not

1143
01:09:28,725 --> 01:09:32,685
Speaker 13:  a lot, but you know, that's enough to swap a bunch of stuff

1144
01:09:32,745 --> 01:09:36,445
Speaker 13:  out. I was easily able to just plug this right into my Mac

1145
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:40,925
Speaker 13:  drop songs into it, like a flash drive and it showed up immediately

1146
01:09:40,945 --> 01:09:44,365
Speaker 13:  on the MP three player. I brought it over to a pc,

1147
01:09:44,475 --> 01:09:48,405
Speaker 13:  plugged it into a pc, same thing. Showed up, showed up, dropped a

1148
01:09:48,405 --> 01:09:52,245
Speaker 13:  song into it, like a thumb drive and it showed up on the player.

1149
01:09:52,585 --> 01:09:54,165
Speaker 13:  It works just, it works great.

1150
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:57,005
Speaker 2:  I feel like there's a catch coming here. What is, what is the catch?

1151
01:09:57,565 --> 01:10:01,525
Speaker 13:  There's, there's actually not a, not a huge catch. It doesn't sound

1152
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:05,165
Speaker 13:  amazing. Okay. I'm actually like surprised how

1153
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:09,845
Speaker 13:  easy it is to get one now it's $80. You can get one on Amazon,

1154
01:10:09,845 --> 01:10:13,125
Speaker 13:  You can get one on Sony's website. It has micro USB, which is

1155
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,405
Speaker 2:  Great. That's a catch. Yeah.

1156
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:19,325
Speaker 13:  I would also like to note that it has an FM radio in it.

1157
01:10:19,585 --> 01:10:23,165
Speaker 13:  So when you plug in your headphones, your headphones act as a little antenna.

1158
01:10:23,745 --> 01:10:27,565
Speaker 13:  You can listen to the radio and I think that's just a beautiful thing.

1159
01:10:28,065 --> 01:10:30,845
Speaker 2:  That's cool. and it has a headphone jack, which seems very important.

1160
01:10:30,845 --> 01:10:31,725
Speaker 13:  It has a headphone jack.

1161
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:35,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. Wait, so what, what is the full name of this thing? Okay, I'm

1162
01:10:35,445 --> 01:10:39,045
Speaker 2:  assuming it's some insane hexa decimal nonsense like Sony likes to do.

1163
01:10:39,345 --> 01:10:39,725
Speaker 2:  It is

1164
01:10:39,725 --> 01:10:43,485
Speaker 13:  The NW E 3 9 4 Walkman, Digital

1165
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:44,245
Speaker 13:  Music Player.

1166
01:10:44,635 --> 01:10:48,365
Speaker 2:  That is the fakest sounding that I've ever heard in my life. Okay, so this

1167
01:10:48,365 --> 01:10:52,205
Speaker 2:  is, this is good news. This thing exists. I was thinking we were

1168
01:10:52,205 --> 01:10:55,885
Speaker 2:  gonna end up down the road of like modding an iPod Classic,

1169
01:10:56,365 --> 01:10:58,685
Speaker 2:  which is a thing I've seen a bunch of people doing recently. You can actually

1170
01:10:58,685 --> 01:11:02,605
Speaker 2:  get it to run sort of one specific app or just get

1171
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:06,205
Speaker 2:  it to connect better to modern computers. I thought that might be the answer,

1172
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:09,005
Speaker 2:  but this is like you're, you're telling me there is at least one half decent

1173
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:13,310
Speaker 2:  dedicated offline music device that exists in the world still?

1174
01:11:13,635 --> 01:11:17,405
Speaker 13:  Yeah, totally. This will, this will do it if other people are looking for

1175
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:20,965
Speaker 13:  something like this but can use Bluetooth. The

1176
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:24,365
Speaker 13:  Mighty player is another good option. Do you remember that one?

1177
01:11:24,675 --> 01:11:28,605
Speaker 2:  That was the one that was meant for Spotify specifically, right? Yeah.

1178
01:11:28,605 --> 01:11:30,605
Speaker 13:  It syncs with your Spotify, like

1179
01:11:30,605 --> 01:11:32,125
Speaker 2:  An iPod shuffle looking thing.

1180
01:11:32,275 --> 01:11:35,805
Speaker 13:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. It uses the internet to sync

1181
01:11:36,245 --> 01:11:39,805
Speaker 13:  in Bluetooth to sync, but it doesn't use the internet while you're actually

1182
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:41,485
Speaker 13:  using it. Disconnect it from your

1183
01:11:41,485 --> 01:11:41,805
Speaker 2:  Phone. I see.

1184
01:11:41,805 --> 01:11:45,725
Speaker 13:  Okay. So that is a fun option if You can do Bluetooth. But yeah,

1185
01:11:45,725 --> 01:11:49,605
Speaker 13:  the Sony one, no Bluetooth, no wifi, you're

1186
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:52,085
Speaker 13:  all set to go. It's like a thumb drive with a screen on it

1187
01:11:52,215 --> 01:11:55,485
Speaker 2:  Isn't know while that, that feels like sort of magical now that You can just

1188
01:11:55,485 --> 01:11:59,125
Speaker 2:  plug a thing in, drag some MP three files and it just like works. What a

1189
01:11:59,125 --> 01:11:59,925
Speaker 2:  concept it is.

1190
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:00,205
Speaker 13:  Yeah.

1191
01:12:00,645 --> 01:12:04,485
Speaker 2:  I will say it is kind of odd that Sony is making this thing as a low

1192
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:07,005
Speaker 2:  end device. 'cause you would think that people who might want something,

1193
01:12:07,085 --> 01:12:10,245
Speaker 2:  I guess are also the people who want the kind of high res,

1194
01:12:10,975 --> 01:12:14,725
Speaker 2:  super high fidelity audio that you're talking about. To make it as kind of

1195
01:12:14,725 --> 01:12:18,005
Speaker 2:  an entry level device is a little surprising. I wonder if Sony imagines this

1196
01:12:18,025 --> 01:12:22,005
Speaker 2:  as like mostly a thing for kids. Yeah. Instead of, you know, super

1197
01:12:22,165 --> 01:12:22,765
Speaker 2:  duper music fans.

1198
01:12:23,025 --> 01:12:26,765
Speaker 13:  That's probably right. Maybe for people who work on military bases,

1199
01:12:27,145 --> 01:12:27,845
Speaker 13:  we don't know.

1200
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:31,725
Speaker 2:  That's fair. I mean listen, there's a lot of 'em out there. Yeah. Alright,

1201
01:12:31,755 --> 01:12:35,125
Speaker 2:  well no reasonable person should be required to remember that bottle name.

1202
01:12:35,145 --> 01:12:38,285
Speaker 2:  So we'll put the, we'll put the link in the show notes, but Andrew, you,

1203
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:41,165
Speaker 2:  you did, this is like the most successfully we've ever answered a hotline

1204
01:12:41,365 --> 01:12:44,445
Speaker 2:  question. This is great. We just found the thing

1205
01:12:44,815 --> 01:12:45,445
Speaker 13:  Happy to help

1206
01:12:45,715 --> 01:12:49,325
Speaker 2:  Anonymous. I hope that helps. Let us know how you feel about the your your

1207
01:12:49,355 --> 01:12:51,605
Speaker 2:  cool new Sony Walkman. Andrew, thank you as always.

1208
01:12:51,935 --> 01:12:52,445
Speaker 13:  Thank you.

1209
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:57,285
Speaker 2:  Alright, that's it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to everybody who came

1210
01:12:57,285 --> 01:13:00,525
Speaker 2:  on the show and thank you as always for listening. There's lots more on everything.

1211
01:13:00,525 --> 01:13:04,165
Speaker 2:  We talked about tons of Quibi coverage. The Virg was alive during

1212
01:13:04,405 --> 01:13:08,125
Speaker 2:  Quibi, unlike the Roku Netflix player a million years ago. So we have coverage

1213
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:11,965
Speaker 2:  of the whole life of that company and it is wild to read in retrospect. Plus

1214
01:13:12,195 --> 01:13:12,765
Speaker 2:  lots of stuff

1215
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:26,165
Speaker 3:  I.
