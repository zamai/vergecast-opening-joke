00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,820
Speaker 3:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of procedurally generated

3
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,980
Speaker 3:  four on the floor. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and this is the second

4
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,980
Speaker 3:  episode in our three-part series about ai. What we're trying to do in these

5
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,820
Speaker 3:  episodes is not just talk about AI as a theory or

6
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,820
Speaker 3:  fast forward a dozen or a hundred years to when AI takes over the world

7
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,740
Speaker 3:  and kills us all, but actually look at what AI is really doing

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,900
Speaker 3:  in our lives right now. This week we're gonna talk about how AI is

9
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,420
Speaker 3:  changing music, and we actually got started down this

10
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,660
Speaker 3:  particular rabbit hole while we were making last week's episode about cloning

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,300
Speaker 3:  your voice because in the making of that episode, we discovered this tool

12
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,180
Speaker 3:  called sify.ai that claims to be able to train a model to

13
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,180
Speaker 3:  sound not like your speaking voice, but your singing voice.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,980
Speaker 3:  As far as I can tell, SIFY isn't really a production

15
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,860
Speaker 3:  tool so much as it is sort of a silly tool to let you make songs using

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,020
Speaker 3:  voices like, I don't know, SpongeBob Squarepants,

17
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:46,940
Speaker 3:  Michael Jackson.

18
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,780
Speaker 1:  But

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,540
Speaker 3:  You can also train it with your own. So obviously I had to test that.

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,660
Speaker 3:  So I got out my mic, put on some headphones, and I spent about an hour

21
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,620
Speaker 3:  singing a few of my favorite songs into a recorder. I'm not going to play

22
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,540
Speaker 3:  those recordings for reasons of my own embarrassment, but also because trust

23
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,180
Speaker 3:  me, literally no one needs to hear that. But the thing is,

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,420
Speaker 3:  you're kind of about to hear my voice anyway,

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,940
Speaker 3:  or@leastwhatsify.ai thinks. I sound like

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,300
Speaker 3:  The process is kind of weird. You upload a bunch of stuff, it processes your

27
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,260
Speaker 3:  voice, and then you just plug in a YouTube U R l, it tries

28
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,220
Speaker 3:  to extract the vocals, then sort of paste yours back in

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,340
Speaker 3:  and then rewrite the song using your voice. It's wonky, but it's

30
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,140
Speaker 3:  super fun and pretty quick. So without further ado, please welcome

31
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,100
Speaker 3:  to the stage AI David Pierce singing. I Wanna Hold Your Hand by the

32
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,580
Speaker 3:  Beatles.

33
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,420
Speaker 3:  It's actually not

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,740
Speaker 5:  Bad.

35
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,600
Speaker 1:  Like

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,640
Speaker 3:  I cannot stand the sound of my own singing voice, but that does kind of

37
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,640
Speaker 3:  sound like me, I think at least until you get a little further into the

38
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,040
Speaker 3:  song and then it all just completely falls apart

39
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,640
Speaker 5:  And when,

40
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,120
Speaker 3:  Okay, I feel happy. Okay, I could do this forever. We made a lot of songs,

41
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,960
Speaker 3:  but I'll only do one more here. This is Suspicious Minds by Elvis

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,760
Speaker 3:  Presley, by ai. David Pierce.

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:29,840
Speaker 5:  We,

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Speaker 5:  I can walk out.

45
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,440
Speaker 1:  Oh, Lori.

46
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,840
Speaker 3:  Okay. Let's just move on. Before this goes any further off the rails, or

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,240
Speaker 3:  everyone stops listening because of my voice, let's bring in a couple of

48
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,200
Speaker 3:  actual musicians to talk about how AI is changing the way we make

49
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,720
Speaker 3:  music. My guests today are Charlie Harding, a songwriter and the co-host

50
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,160
Speaker 3:  of the wonderful podcast Switched on Pop, who has been on this show before.

51
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,920
Speaker 3:  He is responsible for Laser Bong

52
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,320
Speaker 6:  It

53
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,960
Speaker 3:  And Ian Kimmel, a producer and songwriter who has worked with everyone from

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,200
Speaker 3:  B T S to Mary j Blige to Netflix. And the N B A Ian also

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,760
Speaker 3:  runs a company called Biscuit Head Collective, which works with artists of

56
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,600
Speaker 3:  all sizes to make songs. So you could say AI is very important

57
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,560
Speaker 3:  to both of these people and their livelihood going forward, and I wanna

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,640
Speaker 3:  know how they're thinking about it right now and how it fits in

59
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,840
Speaker 3:  Charlie. Harding, welcome back to The Vergecast. Thank you for having me.

60
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,800
Speaker 3:  This is, it's just delightful having you back. It always gets weird when

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,160
Speaker 3:  you're here, which is my favorite thing about having you here. It's gonna

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,680
Speaker 7:  Get weird today.

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
Speaker 3:  Ian Kibble, welcome to the show. Thanks for,

64
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,080
Speaker 5:  Thank you so much for having me as well.

65
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,080
Speaker 3:  Okay. So I wanna do this episode in two parts. Sure. Talking about AI is

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,360
Speaker 3:  very complicated because you end up having to talk about like the cool things

67
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,280
Speaker 3:  it can be and then the terrifying things about it. And then we're all gonna

68
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,640
Speaker 3:  die and it's illegal all at the same time. So we're just gonna split those

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,760
Speaker 3:  things apart. Yeah. So for the first half of the show, I want to talk like

70
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,880
Speaker 3:  super practical, how this stuff actually works, what you can do with it.

71
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaker 3:  You're both professional musicians. I wanna talk about like how this actually

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,160
Speaker 3:  works like in the world. And then we're going to take a break, we're gonna

73
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Speaker 3:  collect ourselves, and then we're gonna talk about our feelings. Yeah. Does

74
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,880
Speaker 3:  that sound good? Sounds great. Go. You guys good with that? Yeah. Okay. So

75
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,960
Speaker 3:  I gave you guys some homework and we're gonna get to it in a minute and it's

76
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
Speaker 3:  very exciting. But I think the first place I wanna start is like, if you're

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,240
Speaker 3:  a working musician today in September of 2023,

78
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaker 3:  are you thinking about AI in your day-to-day, like at all? Right now,

79
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,680
Speaker 7:  I am as a music reporter. Sure. But in terms of making music,

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
Speaker 7:  I think we probably share this. The only tool I've really used to assist

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,440
Speaker 7:  in any part of the creative process, it's been chat pt. But even that is

82
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,840
Speaker 7:  quite limited.

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,160
Speaker 3:  Interesting. That's not at all what I would've guessed. Oh yeah. So how are

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,840
Speaker 3:  you using it right now? Like where would chat g p t fit in? You

85
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,040
Speaker 7:  Can use it as a rhyming dictionary. Ooh, okay. But it hasn't come into my

86
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,080
Speaker 7:  life very much. I mean, I, I wanted to bring Ian into this conversation because

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,520
Speaker 7:  I feel like he kind of has of has, I think he has the most skin in the game.

88
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,560
Speaker 7:  Sure. Because on top of being a record producer, he's got

89
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,440
Speaker 7:  You know Platinum Records, Grammy nominations. He also runs a

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,200
Speaker 7:  business where he will help you take your indie track and make it a like

91
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,120
Speaker 7:  top 40 professional style song. So if there's anyone who probably cares

92
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Speaker 7:  about the world of AI replacing musical things, like, I mean, he's

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,120
Speaker 7:  directly invested in it. So I'm curious. Yeah. Has, how has AI been in your

94
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,280
Speaker 7:  life?

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,400
Speaker 8:  I mean, the number one thing to think about, at least when I'm jumping into

96
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,320
Speaker 8:  it is generally You know we we, we go back a couple decades

97
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,640
Speaker 8:  and we're looking at people like going to tape and that kind of thing. And

98
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,200
Speaker 8:  Then, we have things like vsts, the plugins, replacing all that.

99
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,600
Speaker 8:  So now we're getting into this new era of AI and like all these

100
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,920
Speaker 8:  new technologies coming out that the number one thing I'm paying attention

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,960
Speaker 8:  to is just trying to be current. I'm young, I'm in my twenties. But at the

102
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,720
Speaker 8:  same time, with all this technology we have to do, like it has to, we always

103
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,320
Speaker 8:  have to keep up with the times, otherwise we're gonna get left behind. But

104
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,280
Speaker 8:  there is so many amazing functions going on inside of it. And

105
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,080
Speaker 8:  me being a music professional who is a musician that can play multiple

106
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,360
Speaker 8:  instruments and program drums and all that kind of stuff, it doesn't come

107
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,400
Speaker 8:  into my world as often as like a new music producer would. Okay. Just

108
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Speaker 8:  because there's so many season. So you think

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
Speaker 3:  If you were starting fresh right now trying to get in the game, you think

110
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
Speaker 3:  you would be maybe more invested in figuring out some of the AI stuff?

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,960
Speaker 8:  Definitely. Yeah. Interesting. If I didn't know how to program drums, there's,

112
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,960
Speaker 8:  you can just pull up this one V S T that allows you to program

113
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,960
Speaker 8:  drums with a hit of a button. It automatically reads your tempo. You can

114
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,920
Speaker 8:  set the vibe that you want and then you got drums and then you click the

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,000
Speaker 8:  button again and then you have a variation of that. And it just, there's

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Speaker 8:  so many tools that it's creating to really save time. And also

117
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,040
Speaker 8:  in the learning process, it's a bigger jump, it's a lot quicker. So it's

118
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,000
Speaker 8:  allowing new music producers to be able to jump on way quicker. But that

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,640
Speaker 8:  being said, the thing I only really use in my professional life would be

120
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,440
Speaker 8:  chat G P T

121
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,760
Speaker 3:  For the same reasoning, dictionaries, all that stuff.

122
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,120
Speaker 8:  Not as much for me. Sometimes lyric editing. Okay. To see if

123
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,000
Speaker 8:  I can like pull something better out of it. Not as often, but the most

124
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,360
Speaker 8:  I'm actually using it for is writing well converting business emails.

125
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,440
Speaker 3:  Like

126
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,440
Speaker 8:  That's the top thing I've using Chat for.

127
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,200
Speaker 3:  That's your, your hit album. Well, converting business emails, right?

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,240
Speaker 8:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

129
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,320
Speaker 7:  Sounds like a great vapor wave album. Let's make that.

130
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,400
Speaker 8:  But yeah, that's the top thing I've using it for as this time. It's You know,

131
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,680
Speaker 8:  it's the sidebar of the music industry is the business of the music industry.

132
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,240
Speaker 8:  But it's something that's very important for somebody like me who's trying

133
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
Speaker 8:  to afford to live in New York, You know. Yeah,

134
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,080
Speaker 3:  For sure. So is there, is there anything that feels like you

135
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
Speaker 3:  would love to offload part of the process to ai? Where I feel

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,960
Speaker 3:  like You know everybody in who does sort of normal desk jobs is

137
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,240
Speaker 3:  like loves AI because it can write their emails, right? Yeah. And that feels

138
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,920
Speaker 3:  like the kind of thing that it's like, this isn't really my job, but it's

139
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,040
Speaker 3:  a thing I have to do as part of my job. So like terrific. If I can offload

140
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,600
Speaker 3:  that. Amazing. I mean we were,

141
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,920
Speaker 7:  We were talking about this just yesterday. I'm very jealous of Ian because

142
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,800
Speaker 7:  he has a team of people that work with him to help him do all the prep

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,520
Speaker 7:  work, which is really boring. Mm. Sloppy. So prepping a mix session takes

144
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,600
Speaker 7:  forever. You have to cut out all the silences, you have to get everything

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,880
Speaker 7:  in the right order, you have to color the tracks, tuning vocals,

146
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,880
Speaker 7:  aligning things. A lot of things do have creative choices that happen in

147
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,760
Speaker 7:  them, but there can be just dozens of hours a week of prep work

148
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,760
Speaker 7:  that usually is handled by an assistant or an engineer. And

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,280
Speaker 7:  I don't finish songs often because I'm like, I don't wanna spend my entire

150
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,400
Speaker 7:  day doing all this prep work, which not only slows me down, but

151
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,240
Speaker 7:  it also, it drags me down as well. Like it puts me in a creative

152
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,240
Speaker 7:  hole where what I need to do is just like get right into my creative

153
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,160
Speaker 7:  state, but I have to do that five hours into staring at my computer. So there's

154
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,000
Speaker 7:  a lot of things that I would love for it to automate.

155
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,200
Speaker 8:  And at this point, it's not replacing anything I'm doing or my assistants

156
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,840
Speaker 8:  are doing, but there is technology now coming out that is helping with it.

157
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,640
Speaker 8:  But I think we're just on The Verge of that. I saw one last week that

158
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,960
Speaker 8:  So, we talk about the stems of a song, all the different instruments and

159
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,480
Speaker 8:  vocals and everything. And if someone You know, a lot of times will get it

160
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,520
Speaker 8:  from the producer or the artist and nothing will be labeled So. we have to

161
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,600
Speaker 8:  go through and listen to every single one. Right. And now there's a new technology

162
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,480
Speaker 8:  where you can enter in your stems and it can name exactly what they are and

163
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,040
Speaker 8:  you can choose how they're named and everything like that. So at this point

164
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,720
Speaker 8:  there is new technology coming up that can really save us a lot of time.

165
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,440
Speaker 8:  Save my assistants in particular a lot of time. But it we're just on The

166
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,000
Speaker 8:  Verge of that, which is personally really exciting for me. Yeah.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,760
Speaker 7:  And, and it's important because like if you were to mix the artist, Jacob Collier,

168
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,680
Speaker 7:  who's Grammy winning artist, what is a, a small session of his like 400,

169
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,800
Speaker 7:  500 tracks definitely good Ford. Right? So if those haven't been labeled,

170
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,920
Speaker 7:  you got 400 to 500 tracks, I, apple literally expanded the number of

171
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,880
Speaker 7:  tracks that their d a w logic can have because he was feeling like he

172
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,560
Speaker 7:  was hamstrung by the number of tracks they could have. Yep. So you can have

173
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,280
Speaker 7:  these huge sessions if things are unlabeled. I mean, it could take an entire

174
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,280
Speaker 7:  day just to get things set up properly so you can make it. That

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,800
Speaker 8:  Makes time. Yeah.

176
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
Speaker 3:  Yeah, that's a really good example. I mean it's, it is kind of the, the like

177
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,360
Speaker 3:  the work about the work and that's so much of ai. Like we talk about this

178
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,920
Speaker 3:  even with like what Google and Microsoft are doing, where it's like you can't

179
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,960
Speaker 3:  do your actual sort of meaningful work better, but you

180
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,720
Speaker 3:  can turn an Excel spreadsheet into a PowerPoint deck more quickly.

181
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,880
Speaker 3:  And that's where we are with AI in a lot of places, I think. And that's,

182
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,200
Speaker 3:  that's fine and good. But yeah, it does feel like there's a, there's a leap

183
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,200
Speaker 3:  away before it starts being more than that. Like do you feel like you're

184
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,120
Speaker 3:  in a moment of existential business questions about like, how do I

185
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,400
Speaker 3:  do this job? We're gonna get to much more of that later

186
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,080
Speaker 8:  For sure. Preview it for us now. No, the toes in the water. Yeah. No, it's

187
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,880
Speaker 8:  definitely, I'm, I am not worried at all, nor

188
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,720
Speaker 8:  should anybody in my company be worried about like You know for,

189
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,920
Speaker 8:  it's just minuscule tasks at this point. There is You know, there's things

190
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,520
Speaker 8:  rolling through my head like, okay, we have this STEM technology to read

191
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker 8:  the stems, so that means You know that AI can't hear

192
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,160
Speaker 8:  critically, but it can like read waves and all that kind of stuff to really

193
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,760
Speaker 8:  understand what's going on. So it can tell what different elements are.

194
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,920
Speaker 8:  You can reference things that sound good and then it could like mix your

195
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,800
Speaker 8:  song in a way that sounds good. And You know it's, that is not at a point

196
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,760
Speaker 8:  we are at right now, that technology hasn't been made. But I see it in the

197
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,400
Speaker 8:  future for possibly being able to automate some of the bigger jobs that we

198
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,640
Speaker 8:  have. But just the data set that you would need in order to create that would

199
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,120
Speaker 8:  be incredible. You know. Totally. Yeah.

200
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,240
Speaker 7:  So I mean, music is music creation though. A big business is often

201
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,320
Speaker 7:  a lot of, a lot of the companies that serve the music professionals,

202
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,920
Speaker 7:  they're small businesses. I mean, some of them are multimillion dollar businesses,

203
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,400
Speaker 7:  but You know, if you look at like the synthesizer companies, they're like

204
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,400
Speaker 7:  a dozen people. They're using really old technology from the seventies. Often.

205
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,840
Speaker 7:  There are a handful of You know, certainly music technology companies that

206
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,760
Speaker 7:  are working in ai, but they don't have the resources of Google. Right. In

207
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,360
Speaker 7:  fact, some of the tools that we've used for fun have been created by Google

208
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,040
Speaker 7:  as sort of like side throwaway projects. And so one of the big problems I

209
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
Speaker 7:  think in servicing music professionals is large

210
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,840
Speaker 7:  good data sets that might exist for You know, helping us

211
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Speaker 7:  make PowerPoints 'cause how many PowerPoints exist. Totally. But getting

212
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,360
Speaker 7:  access to good data. I mean, I remember The Verge had an amazing article

213
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,720
Speaker 7:  written by a You, know a former journalist here at Danny Deal who talked

214
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,560
Speaker 7:  about the metadata problem within music. And just like people don't submit

215
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,760
Speaker 7:  the metadata to the streaming services for you

216
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,560
Speaker 7:  to then know how to get paid. So there's just like, the data problem

217
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,600
Speaker 7:  is already such a significant problem throughout the music industry. More

218
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Speaker 7:  broadly making tools that are built off of that training data

219
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,360
Speaker 7:  for our subset, fairly niche industry, I'm You know,

220
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,680
Speaker 7:  skeptical and expect the best tools probably being things that are

221
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,520
Speaker 7:  appropriated from the larger tech companies.

222
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,120
Speaker 3:  Got it. Okay. Alright. So the, the super primitive nature of all of this

223
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,680
Speaker 3:  makes me very excited for what's about to happen, which is

224
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,320
Speaker 3:  that I basically told you I wanted to talk about some of the specific tools

225
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,080
Speaker 3:  that are out there and how they're using 'em. And the two of you went like

226
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,480
Speaker 3:  several orders of magnitude beyond that. And you just made AI music

227
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,920
Speaker 3:  is essentially my understanding of what happened here.

228
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,160
Speaker 7:  We made music, you made using only AI tools.

229
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,640
Speaker 8:  Okay.

230
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,160
Speaker 3:  I wanna walk through this whole process. I wanna hear the thing that you

231
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,600
Speaker 3:  made. I have not heard any of this. I'm very excited. But before you get

232
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,280
Speaker 3:  into it, how was this process? You did this with like very little notice

233
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,000
Speaker 3:  or time. Has this, was this like, was this fun? Was this awful?

234
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,880
Speaker 3:  Was this, did you make the worst thing you've ever made in your lives and

235
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,560
Speaker 3:  you hate it forever? Like how did it feel?

236
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,440
Speaker 7:  I feel like Ian, you make stuff just every single day. How is this different

237
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Speaker 7:  for you? I'm curious. I'm

238
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,440
Speaker 8:  So happy I was doing it with him, first of all, like a lot of other people,

239
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Speaker 8:  this would've been so frustrating, but I felt like I had a broken leg the

240
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,080
Speaker 8:  whole time. It slowed down the process and it's not just like figuring

241
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,640
Speaker 8:  out these tools and how to use them, it's how to, like, we had to restart

242
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,400
Speaker 8:  and manipulate audio in a way after using the AI to

243
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,120
Speaker 8:  actually get it to fit in correctly, which was You know. So time

244
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,840
Speaker 8:  consuming when it's like, one of the tools we used was just to create a simple

245
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,800
Speaker 8:  base, which was just a sine wave. And I could have pulled up a plugin

246
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,600
Speaker 8:  and done it in 30 seconds, but in order to try and create

247
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,680
Speaker 8:  a sine wave using some of these things, it took us 10 minutes. You know.

248
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,960
Speaker 8:  So it was just a slow process just going through the entire

249
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,640
Speaker 8:  thing. And You know, it's really fun getting starter ideas and little things

250
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,400
Speaker 8:  that I personally wouldn't think of and pulling those in, but using it

251
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,440
Speaker 8:  for the entire process was very inhibiting.

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,120
Speaker 7:  I believe that. Yeah, I mean, learning any new tool is always gonna slow

253
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,160
Speaker 7:  you down, like with any studio tool as well. Like if you get new equipment

254
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,880
Speaker 7:  in the studio, you gotta kind of spend an hour learning it. So there definitely,

255
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,960
Speaker 7:  we, we were held back by using new things while trying to be

256
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,600
Speaker 7:  creative at the same time. That said, most of the material that we put together

257
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,840
Speaker 7:  would've been a lot easier if we could have just used the existing tool sets

258
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,480
Speaker 7:  that we already have. So it was a fun exercise, a set of

259
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,080
Speaker 7:  constraints and a fun excuse to hang out and make a song together. Love it.

260
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,560
Speaker 8:  Let's, so

261
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,640
Speaker 3:  Let's, let's do it. Walk me through like, okay, you, you sit down to do this.

262
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,800
Speaker 3:  Where do you even, where do you start?

263
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,680
Speaker 7:  Well, I had done a little bit of research the night before to make sure and

264
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,240
Speaker 7:  You know, I I, I cover music. And so I had a list of things I

265
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,000
Speaker 7:  was curious about exploring and we thought that we should probably begin

266
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,880
Speaker 7:  with an idea, right? Like typically a good song is gonna

267
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,200
Speaker 7:  have some kind of hook, some kind of core idea that's gonna guide it so that

268
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,760
Speaker 7:  we'd know which direction to go in. And we figured we could

269
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,120
Speaker 7:  use chat G P T, which is the You, know that that would be the top of the

270
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,480
Speaker 7:  funnel. Everyone knows it. Let's see if we can love it. Use that for some

271
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,840
Speaker 7:  sort of creative purpose. And so I came into the room and I had been talking

272
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,160
Speaker 7:  about, I've just started a, a teaching position, which I is really fun for

273
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,600
Speaker 7:  me, I'm teaching a, a, a music school and I actually didn't finish my music

274
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,160
Speaker 7:  major. So there's kind of this like imposter syndrome that I have of going

275
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,840
Speaker 7:  into class every day and teaching something where I, I kind of dropped that

276
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,080
Speaker 7:  major. And so I thought, well let's, let's go with that idea. And then I

277
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,320
Speaker 7:  think you went a little further and like, how about, let's, let's take it

278
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,960
Speaker 7:  to like a, just the feeling of like not belonging. And so you

279
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,960
Speaker 7:  made an amma, you have a way of prompting chat, g p t Ian that is

280
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,360
Speaker 7:  sophisticated and re results in some lyrics. I don't

281
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,160
Speaker 8:  Find it sophisticated, but thank you. Yeah. So essentially he had the

282
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,920
Speaker 8:  imposter syndrome idea and I was thinking like, okay, what can we make this

283
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,520
Speaker 8:  more standard song core lyrical content

284
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,960
Speaker 8:  wise? And so what we, what I thought it was like, okay, I have

285
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,000
Speaker 8:  imposter syndrome, but imposter syndrome was somebody else. It'd be really

286
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,760
Speaker 8:  easy to jump into a relationship. So I prompted a little bit of relationship

287
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,880
Speaker 8:  and then I also prompted it with, I have imposter syndrome being in

288
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,760
Speaker 8:  this musical or in any world with ai also there I feel like

289
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,080
Speaker 8:  it's better than me. I feel like it can do better than me. So a lot of You

290
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,840
Speaker 8:  know the nouns and things like that that we're verbs and everything were

291
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,800
Speaker 8:  like electrical techie, stuff like that, which is really

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,360
Speaker 7:  Interesting. Ian basically writes like a multi-paragraph long prompt that

293
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Speaker 7:  is just like, you have this way of just kind of like it's stream vomiting,

294
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,480
Speaker 7:  word consciousness, stream of consciousness. Like maybe that will prompt

295
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,280
Speaker 7:  interesting and creative things. And, and we, we, I think we came to the

296
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,400
Speaker 7:  idea that like, we would like this song to be maybe from the perspective

297
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,320
Speaker 7:  of an AI that has imposter syndrome trying to exist in the world. Ian

298
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,280
Speaker 7:  has this amazing studio in midtown that, that has the, they're on the

299
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,080
Speaker 7:  eighth floor with this giant window that overlooks the Empire State Building.

300
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,720
Speaker 7:  So, we had to make it also set in New York. Sure. So, we sent that prompt

301
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,960
Speaker 7:  in and we got back garbage. Yep.

302
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,880
Speaker 7:  He used chat G P T 3.5. Yeah.

303
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,400
Speaker 8:  He used four. Okay.

304
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,040
Speaker 7:  I used four. I think four is supposed to be the more creative. Yeah. And

305
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,840
Speaker 7:  so this is what we got from our just first verse. After this big prompt

306
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,760
Speaker 7:  woke up today in a world so bright but shadows formed beneath the city lights,

307
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,360
Speaker 7:  you're soaring high. While I remain tied to the ground by invisible

308
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,230
Speaker 7:  chains, starting a song with woke up today has got to be the most

309
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,790
Speaker 7:  cliche way of beginning a song.

310
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,070
Speaker 8:  It's like an off, off, off Broadway show. That,

311
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,950
Speaker 7:  And so the real challenge here is it does write Yeah.

312
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,390
Speaker 7:  The most cliche kind of lyrics, very obvious end rhymes,

313
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,870
Speaker 7:  bright lights, remain chains. Oh, that's kind of nice. It

314
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,790
Speaker 7:  actually made a slant rhyme. Sure. But it's, it's really bad at like multi

315
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,830
Speaker 7:  syllabic rhymes, which is what makes You know a great verse, strange

316
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,110
Speaker 7:  rhyme schemes and things like that. We were also upset that it was kind of

317
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,670
Speaker 7:  vague. Good songs are gonna have some specifics. Like you want the Red scarf

318
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,990
Speaker 7:  and a Taylor Swift song. Sure. That's gonna guide you through the entire

319
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,710
Speaker 7:  narrative. And So, we, we tried a different approach. I I borrowed

320
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,390
Speaker 7:  this songwriting tool from Jeff Tweedy of Wilco

321
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,590
Speaker 7:  and he's got this idea where you wanna hack your brain and put together

322
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,110
Speaker 7:  unlikely pairings of words are often where you find interesting new meaning.

323
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,510
Speaker 7:  So I said, give me, this is one of his exercises. Give me

324
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,790
Speaker 7:  10 verbs that are about imposter syndrome and then

325
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,950
Speaker 7:  give me 10 nouns that are objects in New York City. And it

326
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,910
Speaker 7:  started giving me more interesting Okay. Poetic things, including intruding

327
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,750
Speaker 7:  skyscrapers, shattering street lamps, looting

328
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,630
Speaker 7:  newsstands, tampering, taxis. I said, okay, well take some of those

329
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,190
Speaker 7:  and try to write some lyrics. So it gave me this verse,

330
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,070
Speaker 7:  intruding skyscrapers piercing the night in their looming shadows. We tried

331
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,790
Speaker 7:  to find the light Sneaking subways silent cries. They echo

332
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,270
Speaker 7:  We're in different lanes waiting for the metro. Now

333
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,430
Speaker 8:  Better, not better. Better.

334
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,710
Speaker 7:  We liked Metro, although clearly nobody in New York City calls

335
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,710
Speaker 7:  the subway, the metro

336
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,750
Speaker 8:  Sneaking subways kind of works for me. Yeah. I

337
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,510
Speaker 7:  Like sneaking subways. And then, so then I was like, wait, we need more specific

338
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,350
Speaker 7:  things. So I then prompted it further and was like, but can you give me some

339
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,190
Speaker 7:  specific places in New York City now

340
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,550
Speaker 8:  We go down the rabbit hole and,

341
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:05,710
Speaker 7:  And, and it updated it to intruding skyscrapers. The empires might by the

342
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,190
Speaker 7:  Flat Iron building. We first saw the light Sneaking Subways beneath the Central

343
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,870
Speaker 7:  Park by the Bethesda Terrace. We lost our spark. And you immediately start

344
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,150
Speaker 7:  singing. Do you

345
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,190
Speaker 8:  Remember No, no.

346
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,670
Speaker 7:  The the Alicia Keys song.

347
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,230
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. In New York. It was just so like

348
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,070
Speaker 8:  incredibly specific or like gave You know I i I

349
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,750
Speaker 8:  love an actual place, something tangible. Sure. You know. Like I put the

350
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,350
Speaker 8:  word Bowery in so many of my songs. It's ridiculous. But

351
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,230
Speaker 8:  not every line. Yeah. It's, it's, yeah. So we kept

352
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,910
Speaker 7:  Prompting and kept prompting and trying to get better material out of it

353
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,390
Speaker 7:  and it just wasn't working. And So, we decided to go with sort of the, the,

354
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,350
Speaker 7:  I think what was the second prompt? The one that used that sort of noun verb

355
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,360
Speaker 7:  exercise. Sure. And Ian is really good at reducing

356
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,760
Speaker 7:  bad lyrics that's been submitted to him and make them You know more Singable

357
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,240
Speaker 7:  So. we knew we had something he could work with. I think my favorite

358
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,000
Speaker 7:  AI tool actually that we used the entire time, I'm assuming it's ai, I don't

359
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,560
Speaker 7:  know, was he took a picture of my computer screen

360
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,560
Speaker 7:  with the lyrics on it and Apple automatically can

361
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,200
Speaker 7:  identify the text. Oh sure. And he can copy and paste the text from the picture

362
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,000
Speaker 7:  into an Apple note and edit it. I think most of,

363
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,360
Speaker 3:  I love that that's the best ai

364
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,240
Speaker 7:  That was, that was the best thing that

365
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,000
Speaker 3:  We used. That is so telling

366
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,520
Speaker 7:  And I, I think Mo, the tools that I had the most fun with are the things

367
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,240
Speaker 7:  that often market their AI the least. Interesting.

368
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,480
Speaker 7:  So I don't know if there's some sort of You know machine learning in, in

369
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,160
Speaker 7:  that tool. Yeah, no,

370
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,640
Speaker 3:  That counts. I'm, that's ai. Okay. Yeah, we're good.

371
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,240
Speaker 7:  Okay, great. Great, great. Alright, we got an idea. We've got some rough

372
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,120
Speaker 7:  lyrics. We need a vibe and So, we went hunting for sounds and

373
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,200
Speaker 7:  the first place we went was a, a website called Suno. Suno is kind of like

374
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,720
Speaker 7:  the mid journey for music. They have a Discord server

375
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,160
Speaker 7:  where you can enter a prompt and it's gonna spit out rather than a picture

376
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,080
Speaker 7:  like mid journey. It's gonna, it's gonna spit out music and it's, I believe

377
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,120
Speaker 7:  fully synthesized music including lyrics and and vocals.

378
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,240
Speaker 7:  So can I play you what we got please? Okay. We're just gonna do a smattering

379
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,080
Speaker 7:  of sounds for now. We entered the first verse that intruding skyscrapers

380
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,120
Speaker 7:  verse, and this is what it gave us.

381
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,200
Speaker 9:  Intruding skyscrapers.

382
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,800
Speaker 9:  Try to find the light.

383
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,560
Speaker 7:  I was like, okay, I like the Nokia ringtone. Yep. We're gonna use that. Yep.

384
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,280
Speaker 7:  And we've got some vocals like,

385
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,800
Speaker 3:  So all of that was synthesized. That was also because you fed a text and

386
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,600
Speaker 3:  it came back with that. That's right.

387
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,240
Speaker 8:  Also, this is the full audio quality, like to be told to

388
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,760
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. It's like

389
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,240
Speaker 8:  A this, this isn't being degraded at all through the listening process here.

390
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,480
Speaker 8:  This is the full auto audio qualities

391
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,040
Speaker 3:  It came out. It's basically Nokia ringtone quality. Yeah,

392
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,360
Speaker 7:  Yeah, exactly. Okay. And then actually just like mid journey, it will give

393
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,720
Speaker 7:  you alternatives. So it gave us this other track as well.

394
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,720
Speaker 7:  And this one we thought was kind of trash, but it has this Yeah.

395
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,560
Speaker 3:  Getting like bad country song vibes from this.

396
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,840
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah. But we like this little sort of piano we syn thing.

397
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,920
Speaker 7:  Now we have the problem that we want these individual pieces of material

398
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,400
Speaker 7:  to play with So. we go to a website called Audio

399
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,680
Speaker 7:  shake.ai and they will stem your

400
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,320
Speaker 7:  pre-existing music for you. Right. So, we need it all separated. Audios shape

401
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,120
Speaker 7:  will take that track and it gives us the vocals, the little

402
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,600
Speaker 7:  piano riff we liked from the first one and, and some of like other stuff.

403
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,160
Speaker 7:  And then you can You know, listen to 'em individually. So

404
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,640
Speaker 3:  This seems like the kind of thing that I could see being useful for lots

405
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Speaker 3:  of things in the world, but not really in the music making process. Like

406
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,880
Speaker 3:  are you often pulling stems out of existing things when you're making music?

407
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,400
Speaker 3:  Well, I

408
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,560
Speaker 8:  Mean generally that's against copyright So we can't, well,

409
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,520
Speaker 3:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

410
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,960
Speaker 7:  People use it for remixing so, sure. So especially when, when like it's a

411
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,600
Speaker 7:  really old song and so you do have the rights for it. Big name artists

412
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,960
Speaker 7:  actually using this tool to be able to get the stem spiel to remix. Right.

413
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You also see it all over TikTok and stuff. They're using it to like

414
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,560
Speaker 3:  isolate the vocals and stuff like that. For

415
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,000
Speaker 7:  Sure. Kinda stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. So isolating vocals, shooting

416
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,240
Speaker 9:  Scrapers.

417
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,920
Speaker 7:  We now have isolated vocals. Okay. Right. And we have a little fun riff,

418
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,240
Speaker 7:  this little senty thing.

419
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,640
Speaker 7:  I do like that my, my my noke, my Nokia ringtone. The ringtone is nice. Okay.

420
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,360
Speaker 7:  So that's the first sound we assemble. We've got Suno, we also

421
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:12,920
Speaker 7:  pulled

422
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,640
Speaker 3:  Piano riffs. Yeah.

423
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,200
Speaker 7:  That thing from the Bad Country song. Yeah, we got that as well. Alright.

424
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,000
Speaker 7:  So, we got those sounds. I then just went to like a ton of other,

425
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,920
Speaker 7:  we will make music for you AI sites thinking maybe I can just keep stemming

426
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,880
Speaker 7:  stuff. And a lot of them are really bad. The quality of music that we

427
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,560
Speaker 7:  were getting back would not fit like top 40 pop

428
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,400
Speaker 7:  kind of vibe. They're much more like background advertisement,

429
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,280
Speaker 7:  sort of mood music. But we figured maybe we could You know Get

430
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,480
Speaker 7:  Inspired by One. And So, we went to a place called Sound Full and heard this

431
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,600
Speaker 7:  music, which I think sounds like a pharma ad

432
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,160
Speaker 3:  Side effects include try out. Yeah, yeah,

433
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,080
Speaker 7:  Exactly. And we're like, okay, So, we, we took this to Audio

434
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,960
Speaker 7:  Shake and we got the piano,

435
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,080
Speaker 3:  Which okay,

436
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,280
Speaker 7:  The quality is not great, but

437
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,600
Speaker 7:  this guy's a wizard. I, we knew he could do something with it. When we play

438
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,760
Speaker 7:  with it, we got a few more sounds. We went to

439
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,840
Speaker 7:  Splice is one of the biggest libraries of samples

440
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,320
Speaker 7:  and they have a new tool that will automatically pair different samples together

441
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,760
Speaker 7:  for you as sort of like a starter. Okay. And we went to their

442
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:32,320
Speaker 7:  beta AI tool and they made this sound for us.

443
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:35,920
Speaker 1:  These

444
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,640
Speaker 7:  Are four different samples that splice just kind of randomly put together.

445
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,960
Speaker 7:  And we thought sounded kind of like a really bad phone call again.

446
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:44,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

447
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,000
Speaker 7:  Like you're on waiting. It's like, but we liked the kick drum So.

448
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,520
Speaker 7:  we, we, we got the kick drum. Okay. Full

449
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,480
Speaker 8:  Drums. Yeah. The snare too. You

450
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,400
Speaker 7:  Had a sample of your own. Ian has has a You know

451
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,200
Speaker 7:  professional producer has a bunch of starter sounds that he can bring to

452
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,640
Speaker 7:  any session and just like get things going creatively. But we had to figure

453
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,240
Speaker 7:  out how to process something he'd already made through ai. Sure. And so there

454
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,200
Speaker 7:  was a tool by a company called Output called Arcade that will automatically

455
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,080
Speaker 7:  take your sample and play it back to you with some kind of AI tool

456
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,160
Speaker 7:  that will make some creative choices with that

457
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,520
Speaker 8:  Sample. It's essentially the listening and chopping arcade also does a creative

458
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,960
Speaker 8:  function where you can set the key and it looks at the tempo. Okay. And then

459
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,360
Speaker 8:  it will give you sounds that could work. It's not using any kind of learning

460
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,440
Speaker 8:  technology in this case, but they have a new portion where you can input

461
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,160
Speaker 8:  a sample. It learns that sample, figures out where to chop it and then

462
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,760
Speaker 8:  plays it back to you in creative chops. I see.

463
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,280
Speaker 7:  Okay. So here's the chops that it gave us

464
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,200
Speaker 7:  all. Now we have a selection of sounds like basically we have lyrics, we

465
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,920
Speaker 7:  have collected our paints, we gotta now put something together. Right. And

466
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,280
Speaker 8:  All in different keys, all in different tempos.

467
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,960
Speaker 7:  I think that whole process took us like two and a half hours of getting all

468
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,240
Speaker 7:  that material and just like getting something to work with. And we have

469
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,440
Speaker 3:  A lot of piano tracks, a

470
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,400
Speaker 7:  Lot of piano tracks that we're

471
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,160
Speaker 3:  Keeping track. Yeah. Yeah.

472
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,640
Speaker 7:  I'm

473
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,000
Speaker 3:  Feeling this is gonna be a very moody song.

474
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,920
Speaker 7:  We were thinking moody. Yeah. I mean like, because we actually made a, I

475
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,200
Speaker 7:  didn't say we did make a little reference playlist of, of artists that maybe

476
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,640
Speaker 7:  could inspire the vibe. We, we definitely wanted Moody Piano was on there.

477
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,320
Speaker 7:  We wanted a sort of mid tempo, happy, sad

478
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,400
Speaker 7:  walking through New York in the rain kind of thing at night. Yeah. But it's

479
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,080
Speaker 7:  like neon all around. All right. So that's, that's the vibe. Yeah. And with

480
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Speaker 7:  all of that prompt, we probably could have written a song war two in the

481
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,560
Speaker 7:  amount of time that it took us to collect these sounds, which are very sure

482
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,600
Speaker 7:  lo-fi and need a lot of processes make sound good. So Ian

483
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,680
Speaker 7:  takes first the piano and gives us

484
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,240
Speaker 7:  this riff. The, the piano from Suno,

485
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,240
Speaker 7:  the piano from Sound, actually,

486
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,530
Speaker 7:  which You know sounds a whole lot better than

487
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:04,730
Speaker 1:  Oof.

488
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,490
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That's where we started. Yeah. So that's

489
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,250
Speaker 7:  Where we start. And then I think we had these like interesting, we, we had

490
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,250
Speaker 7:  those like sparkly sound effects

491
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,930
Speaker 8:  That's no. Yeah, yeah.

492
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,210
Speaker 7:  We piled 'em together

493
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,370
Speaker 7:  and Then, we had that kick drum.

494
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,990
Speaker 7:  It took us probably half hour to process the sounds to actually sound better

495
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,910
Speaker 7:  than they initially did. We thought, okay, that's sort of like a

496
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,550
Speaker 7:  pre chorus chorus. Now let's use some of our other sounds. Let's make a verse.

497
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,870
Speaker 7:  And one of the issues is we didn't have a base and we were trying to

498
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,710
Speaker 7:  limit ourselves to only the sounds that we had at our disposal. So. we

499
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,350
Speaker 7:  took this tiny little sample from Suno

500
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,630
Speaker 7:  again, SUNO the sort of mid journey like right app

501
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,350
Speaker 7:  that

502
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,390
Speaker 3:  Just that Okay.

503
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,230
Speaker 7:  That and I turned that into a bass sound

504
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,110
Speaker 3:  That's like a space base space. Okay. By like

505
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,510
Speaker 7:  Staring and fiddling a basically I put that into a sampler. I process it,

506
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,190
Speaker 7:  I do a bunch of different things to it to give us some kind of base something.

507
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,750
Speaker 7:  And I think it, I used the same sample. And to make this as well,

508
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,550
Speaker 8:  It just took so long to long get from that one to another one. We just had

509
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,470
Speaker 8:  to run it through like three plugins and yeah, it was, okay.

510
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,830
Speaker 7:  So, and we have one more sound, which was this,

511
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,230
Speaker 7:  I can't even remember which one this came from. That

512
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,750
Speaker 8:  Was from my loop.

513
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,670
Speaker 7:  That was your, this is your

514
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,150
Speaker 8:  Loop from the arcade. Yeah. Got it. This is the

515
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,120
Speaker 7:  Arcade loop. Okay. And so kind of all those things together, give us a verse

516
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:43,560
Speaker 7:  vibe.

517
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,520
Speaker 7:  And then I think there's just other little chirpy sound

518
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,120
Speaker 10:  As the piano

519
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,360
Speaker 7:  And the sounds are like, they're a little, they're they're, they've got a

520
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,840
Speaker 7:  lot of texture we'll say. I think they sound kind of like the Nokia ringtone

521
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,640
Speaker 7:  is probably the best metaphor, but for me it's like those really bad MP

522
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,840
Speaker 7:  threes that you definitely didn't download off of Kaza or Napster You know

523
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,360
Speaker 7:  20 years ago. That's kind of the quality that they came in. Yeah.

524
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah. There's that one that it kind of makes you wanna like peel your headphone

525
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,280
Speaker 3:  off just to make sure it's like not you didn't blow your speakers. Yep. Yeah.

526
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,960
Speaker 7:  So the next thing is, okay, we have, now we have a vibe, we have some lyrics.

527
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,880
Speaker 7:  We've got to put together some kind of, we'll call top line. We need a melody

528
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,720
Speaker 7:  that's gonna go on top. This is where I think we gave up on

529
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,480
Speaker 7:  trying to use an AI to write a melody. I was just like, Ian get in the booth.

530
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,120
Speaker 7:  Sure.

531
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,960
Speaker 3:  I, I just start riffing and see what

532
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,600
Speaker 7:  Work. And he puts on some autotune. Here's what he gives us

533
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,280
Speaker 11:  Skyscrapers here through the night

534
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,800
Speaker 11:  shadows under the city lights.

535
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,160
Speaker 7:  Now Betty, he, he kind of has massaged the lyrics.

536
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,880
Speaker 7:  I will say that I think intruding skyscrapers is a terrible opener to a song.

537
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,520
Speaker 7:  It's very wordy. Yeah. Intruding skyscrapers.

538
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,760
Speaker 3:  It's a lot of syllables to say at the very beginning. Yeah. Doesn't,

539
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,720
Speaker 7:  Doesn't roll off easily. No. So, we build a whole bunch of melodic ideas,

540
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,520
Speaker 7:  pair them with these lyrics. Ian puts down a whole set of vocals to the entire

541
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,320
Speaker 7:  song. The more interesting thing though is we can't use his voice. We have

542
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,080
Speaker 7:  to use someone else's voice. So, we send this through voice

543
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,160
Speaker 7:  swap.ai. If you wanna release a track with them, they

544
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,200
Speaker 7:  will actually allow you to license their professional singers. This is one

545
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,360
Speaker 7:  of the few tools that has actually made pretty high quality tools specifically

546
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,320
Speaker 7:  for musicians. So

547
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,840
Speaker 3:  They're actually generating models like with specific musicians. That's right.

548
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,160
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And then you can plug your own stuff in and get their generated stuff

549
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,280
Speaker 3:  out.

550
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,000
Speaker 7:  I i if you license it for a couple hundred dollars basically. So this is

551
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,800
Speaker 7:  for journalistic demo purposes only. Of course we're not releasing this

552
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,840
Speaker 7:  song. And So, we, we've

553
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,240
Speaker 3:  Been named for this song, by the way, have we titled it yet at this point

554
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,320
Speaker 3:  in the process? Absolute. I

555
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,000
Speaker 7:  Don't belong probably. Yeah. Okay. You haven't heard the chorus yet? Oh,

556
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Speaker 3:  You're right. I apologize. All right. I don't belong. Parentheses, intruding

557
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,120
Speaker 3:  skyscrapers. Yeah, exactly.

558
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,280
Speaker 7:  That's it. Perfect. Alright. So, we send his

559
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,880
Speaker 7:  voice through the voice model

560
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,000
Speaker 12:  Intruding skyscraper.

561
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,160
Speaker 7:  Now it sounds very process and affected because we intentionally took

562
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,360
Speaker 7:  his auto-tune vocal and sent it through the, the, the, the model. We want

563
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,800
Speaker 7:  this to sound like it might be an AI singing to us, say So.

564
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,240
Speaker 3:  We did not, it sounds more robotic in a good way. Yeah. We

565
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,120
Speaker 7:  Didn't want it to sound natural. That was the goal. I probably voice swap

566
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,680
Speaker 7:  is supposedly the best at doing this. But we tried to hack their thing to

567
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,880
Speaker 7:  give us bad quality Sure. Material back. There were a few other small tools

568
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,800
Speaker 7:  we used at this point. I mentioned that Google Law has a handful of

569
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,440
Speaker 7:  projects, one called Magenta where they will edit midi data.

570
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,920
Speaker 7:  That's basically You know the programming language that musicians use to

571
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,240
Speaker 7:  input music into their, their software. And we had

572
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,520
Speaker 7:  made this little rhythm on our own.

573
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:58,160
Speaker 7:  Just that. And what Magenta would do is it will give

574
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,200
Speaker 7:  you variations on your rhythm. So it gave us this.

575
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:04,680
Speaker 3:  Okay.

576
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,920
Speaker 7:  I mean one of us could have done this, but we just figured all right that

577
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,000
Speaker 7:  there's one nice it ation, it

578
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,360
Speaker 3:  Seems like how many of these tools are doing kind of roughly the same thing

579
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,200
Speaker 3:  where you, it's like, I mean, they're basically all chat g p T, right? Like

580
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,920
Speaker 3:  you say like, here's a thing, give me other versions of this thing. Yeah.

581
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,400
Speaker 3:  And it's, it's able to do that with sort of some level of competence. Yeah.

582
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,640
Speaker 3:  But there's so many moments in this process it seems like, where you've said

583
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,360
Speaker 3:  like, okay, we need to put all these pieces together or we need to

584
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,680
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Start from scratch and get somewhere. And these tools are just, they

585
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,320
Speaker 3:  have nothing to Yeah. I

586
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,200
Speaker 7:  Mean, 'cause like I, like I just need one little percussion idea and I honestly

587
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,480
Speaker 7:  don't, there's probably some tool somewhere, but if you ask me, can you like

588
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,400
Speaker 7:  go interpolate and make me an interesting little top percussion moment,

589
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,120
Speaker 7:  like it would've been faster to program. But anyways, I used Magenta to make

590
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,440
Speaker 7:  this little,

591
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,120
Speaker 7:  It's intentionally buried in the back of the track and there's a

592
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,440
Speaker 7:  artificial tape plugin to sound like, like a tape machine. Sure. That's trained

593
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,720
Speaker 7:  off of a neural net that we put in here to, to process made by baby audio.

594
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,200
Speaker 7:  Finally, I'm gonna play the whole thing in just a second. Love it. We put

595
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
Speaker 7:  the whole song together and there's a company called Isotope that

596
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,920
Speaker 7:  has a mix and master assistant tool.

597
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,440
Speaker 7:  Their mixing tool is called Neutron. And that will go on every single track

598
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,680
Speaker 7:  and you can basically say, Hey, mix this track for me. And at the end on,

599
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,720
Speaker 7:  on the the the full master track, you put ozone. And

600
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,520
Speaker 7:  same thing, rather than mixing and mastering the song ourselves, we just

601
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,440
Speaker 7:  hit the master assist with a license that Ozone gave, that isotope gave

602
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,680
Speaker 7:  us for to make this song. And

603
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,560
Speaker 3:  Isotope specifically is pretty widely used. Right? I don't know how much

604
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,480
Speaker 3:  the AI stuff is, but the isotope thing

605
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,880
Speaker 7:  Is, is pretty well actually, and this is a great example of like the AI marketing

606
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,600
Speaker 7:  around isotope and ozone is just like a tiny little slice of what that's

607
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,400
Speaker 7:  for sure. Being used for. I think, I

608
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,800
Speaker 8:  Think they're mostly chasing after the people who are doing the top of the

609
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,280
Speaker 8:  top work and know the sounds so well and just wanna make a really big help

610
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,760
Speaker 8:  tool in order to jump on. They don't want to necessarily necessarily take

611
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,080
Speaker 8:  someone from like 0% to 10%. It's more for sure. Yeah. Yeah, that makes

612
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,760
Speaker 7:  Sense. So anyway, do wanna hear the track? Yeah. Here's what we got.

613
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,000
Speaker 3:  This is I don't belong parentheses, intruding skyscrapers.

614
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,920
Speaker 12:  Intruding skyscrapers, Pierce through night

615
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,520
Speaker 12:  ing, shadows under the city lights

616
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,480
Speaker 12:  sneaking through the silent.

617
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,240
Speaker 12:  We're in different lanes for

618
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,680
Speaker 12:  dreams.

619
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,760
Speaker 12:  Intertwine t escapes

620
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,320
Speaker 12:  trying to make you mind, but with,

621
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,480
Speaker 3:  All right, we're gonna take a quick break and then we're gonna come back

622
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,440
Speaker 3:  and talk more about this. But we're gonna let this play us out.

623
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,410
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. We brought in Eli Patel. Hi Eli. Hey, what's up? It's

624
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,450
Speaker 3:  time to talk about our feelings, but first I wanna know, you were sitting

625
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,250
Speaker 3:  in the control room listening to the song. What do you think? Is it a song?

626
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,170
Speaker 3:  Do we have a banger on our hands?

627
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,690
Speaker 14:  I think someone needs to go in and move those drums into the pocket.

628
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,130
Speaker 14:  They're, they're early. The snare was early. That's like, I can't hear anything

629
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,730
Speaker 14:  beyond that. And that's just, that's just me. Okay. That's

630
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,290
Speaker 3:  The first thing I listen

631
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,490
Speaker 8:  To. You should have so many more critiques.

632
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,330
Speaker 14:  I I'm confident there are more critiques to be had.

633
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,210
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It it, it's really hard for like my musical representation on this

634
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,730
Speaker 8:  show to be.

635
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,410
Speaker 3:  Sorry.

636
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,210
Speaker 8:  It's very difficult for

637
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:54,130
Speaker 3:  Me. So do you, do you listen to that and think, like, is there anything in

638
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,370
Speaker 3:  that that's interesting to you as a musician?

639
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,690
Speaker 8:  So the, the, the more I've done this, the more I produce music for like so

640
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,890
Speaker 8:  many different people, the more I've realized that I do make bad music and

641
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,810
Speaker 8:  that's okay. And that's gonna go right into the trashcan and that is just

642
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,530
Speaker 8:  fine. I'll make a better one tomorrow. And You know is really fun using

643
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,250
Speaker 8:  all of these tools, but it would take me more time to go into this and try

644
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,010
Speaker 8:  and save stuff from it than it would just be to make a new song.

645
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,890
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Yeah. That's fair. My my old feeling about AI in general is it is

646
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,850
Speaker 14:  a canon of c plus content. Yeah. And if you point a canon of

647
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,890
Speaker 14:  c plus content Yeah. At any business model, something happens. And

648
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,090
Speaker 14:  that song, like it's a, that song is like a canon blast of

649
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,290
Speaker 14:  c plus content. Right.

650
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,770
Speaker 8:  I I I think the biggest problem

651
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,160
Speaker 7:  Was that we used that piano, which came from what sounded like a pharma

652
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,240
Speaker 7:  ad. Yeah. And So, we, we started it from a terrible source material.

653
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,720
Speaker 7:  I remember when we were, when you were working with it, we're like, we're

654
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,960
Speaker 7:  not going in the right direction. What are we gonna do? And I was like, we

655
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,120
Speaker 7:  gotta make the, the verses gotta be minor because it's too happy. And it

656
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,360
Speaker 7:  just like, we ended up making like slightly better remixed pharma music.

657
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:58,040
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So, I don't know. I mean, look, have you

658
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,000
Speaker 3:  Listened to the radio lately? It's, it's not, not what the kids are

659
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,360
Speaker 3:  listening to.

660
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,600
Speaker 3:  Okay. So the piece of this that I think is left to talk about is the, like

661
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,720
Speaker 3:  what this means, like the capital F feelings about

662
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,520
Speaker 3:  all of this. Right. And I think Neli, I, we've spent a lot of time in the

663
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,800
Speaker 3:  show talking about like what AI does to these industries and how we use them.

664
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,640
Speaker 3:  But I'm especially curious like, and we talked a little bit about this at

665
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,280
Speaker 3:  the beginning, but like as people who make PU music professionally, we're

666
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,640
Speaker 3:  in this moment where I think most of these tools are not very good. Many

667
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,920
Speaker 3:  of these tools are useless as we were talking about at the beginning. But

668
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,000
Speaker 3:  like there are a lot of people who would tell you, we are on the road to

669
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,880
Speaker 3:  this stuff becoming a part of life. Right. And I guess the first thing

670
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,400
Speaker 3:  I wonder is like the story of technology helping us make music goes back

671
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,640
Speaker 3:  forever, right? And there's like, there have been these sort of moral panics

672
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,160
Speaker 3:  about autotune and the idea that you can make drums on your computer instead

673
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,120
Speaker 3:  of having to play drums and everybody gets up in arms about that. Like, is

674
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,960
Speaker 3:  AI different from those things or is it just kind of another

675
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,160
Speaker 3:  technology on the spectrum of how we make music, which is a forever changing

676
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,440
Speaker 3:  thing?

677
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,520
Speaker 8:  I don't think this is any bigger of a step than we've had in the past just

678
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,160
Speaker 8:  because a lot of the AI technology that we have is just doing

679
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,440
Speaker 8:  little steps. If you really look into it, So, we have like splice that has

680
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,320
Speaker 8:  every loop under the sun that I can just drop into my song and it can

681
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,280
Speaker 8:  or cannot work. But I instantly have a great quality, let's say drum recording.

682
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,440
Speaker 8:  And then you have programs like Drummon, which uses ai.

683
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,160
Speaker 8:  I'm not actually sure how, because I'm pretty sure it just reads

684
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,240
Speaker 8:  the b p m of the song, which is incredibly easy to do. And then you choose

685
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,120
Speaker 8:  the genre you want and then you hit generate and it gives you a drum

686
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,960
Speaker 8:  sample pattern and you can hit generate again. It'll give you a different

687
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,400
Speaker 8:  drum sample pattern. And to me that's kind of no different than going on

688
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,200
Speaker 8:  splice and going through those sounds and picking one from there. It's automatically

689
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,720
Speaker 8:  syncing up right away so you can hear it quicker. But there isn't a giant

690
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,400
Speaker 8:  step anywhere in music that I have seen at least.

691
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,520
Speaker 7:  I think a great analogy would be like the re release of drum machines in

692
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,600
Speaker 7:  the 1980s. Like originally these things were made to be like demo devices,

693
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:02,160
Speaker 7:  maybe replace a drummer. And a lot of them were completely not, they were

694
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,960
Speaker 7:  failures. The most important sound in contemporary popular

695
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,560
Speaker 7:  music is probably Roland's T R 8 0 8. The drum machine. That was a failure

696
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,520
Speaker 7:  ended up in pawn shops and early hip hop producers start thinking, well

697
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,680
Speaker 7:  that's a cool sound if I, if I misappropriate it and used in these different

698
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,200
Speaker 7:  ways and I mix it in interesting ways. This thing, which sounds kind of like

699
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Speaker 7:  a toy actually sounds amazing. And it took

700
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,600
Speaker 7:  decades for these You know rejected devices then to

701
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,160
Speaker 7:  become the mainstream sound. I think what will be most interesting are the

702
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,920
Speaker 7:  weird sounds that you can get out of these tools. Kids in their basements,

703
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,600
Speaker 7:  figuring out how to misuse them, at least at the state we are today

704
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,120
Speaker 7:  to create new interesting creative material. But this was mostly a really

705
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,720
Speaker 7:  challenging exercise with the exception of isotopes. Tools were very usable,

706
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,040
Speaker 7:  very useful. I mean we use those everyday professionally. Anyways, Apple's

707
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,040
Speaker 7:  iPhone was very useful and chat Chachi PT was mildly useful.

708
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,000
Speaker 14:  You know you brought up autotune and the panic over autotune.

709
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,160
Speaker 14:  It's important to just remember when autotune first hit as an effect,

710
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,480
Speaker 14:  they lied about it because the stigma was so incredible.

711
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,520
Speaker 14:  So believe by Cher, they overdid the autotune.

712
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,520
Speaker 14:  And there are articles upon articles where the producers of that song

713
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:18,080
Speaker 14:  just invented other lies to claim that they had

714
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,880
Speaker 14:  done something that was not used. Autotune, unshare because they were so

715
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,960
Speaker 14:  worried about the stigma of having used the software. And now it's like

716
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,760
Speaker 14:  everyone sees it all the time. And I, I think we're in that moment with

717
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,880
Speaker 14:  AI just like across the board creatively where no one wants to cop to it.

718
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,520
Speaker 14:  But it's just gonna be in the background of all these tools that we're using

719
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,400
Speaker 14:  all the time. And the question is, can you make something that sounds different

720
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,240
Speaker 14:  or great? And I think the worry is that you're gonna type in pop

721
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,440
Speaker 14:  song and get that and that will be all of music. Yep.

722
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,040
Speaker 7:  Okay. Eli, I feel slightly insulted, just to be clear, we didn't

723
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,920
Speaker 7:  'cause you, we didn't prompt that. We actually, we actually worked to make

724
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,400
Speaker 7:  something over about two hours that that was song ish.

725
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,640
Speaker 14:  Song ish. Yeah, yeah. You know

726
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Speaker 7:  And using only AI tools and yeah, it was, it was very challenging to make

727
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,680
Speaker 7:  anything. It just led us in strange directions. But

728
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,680
Speaker 14:  Look, I think that's as big of a hit as believe.

729
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,760
Speaker 7:  Oh my God,

730
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,800
Speaker 14:  Let's get out there.

731
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,280
Speaker 8:  All right, y'all have a good day. How out?

732
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,120
Speaker 14:  Yeah.

733
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,760
Speaker 3:  So Ian, if somebody walks into your studio and is like, I have the beginnings

734
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,720
Speaker 3:  of something, I made it entirely with ai. Are you gonna like roll your

735
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,800
Speaker 3:  eyes and kick them outta the studio?

736
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,240
Speaker 8:  Oh, not at all. No. I take demos from artists all the time. So a lot of times

737
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,360
Speaker 8:  we'll do stuff from scratch, but generally I'm working with stuff who, like

738
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,840
Speaker 8:  they've already had the guitar part and the vocal and that kind of thing.

739
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,400
Speaker 8:  And yeah, there's no stigma behind any of it. You know. There's a bigger

740
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
Speaker 8:  stigma I think right now with using full samples

741
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,320
Speaker 8:  than there is using any kind of AI tool where

742
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,320
Speaker 8:  if all of my drums are from one like drum sample loop, people are

743
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,680
Speaker 8:  like, oh, you could have been more creative than just go on splice and drag

744
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,640
Speaker 8:  that in. That's more of a stigma than like using an AI tool at this pointing.

745
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,760
Speaker 3:  That's really interesting. Yeah. So, and what about the, like I was just

746
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,920
Speaker 3:  thinking, listening to that vocal, that has gotta feel weird for you having

747
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,320
Speaker 3:  uploaded your voice to a piece of software that spit back your

748
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,680
Speaker 3:  singing in somebody else's voice. And I feel like I, I wonder about that

749
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,760
Speaker 3:  creatively with all of this stuff, right? Obviously there's big copyright

750
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,280
Speaker 3:  questions about who owns a voice and can you make a song with fake Drake

751
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,960
Speaker 3:  that counts. But I wonder, like it's gotta feel weird to hear

752
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,520
Speaker 3:  that out in the world, whether you're Drake or you like

753
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,400
Speaker 3:  listening to someone else sing your song that was just your

754
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,560
Speaker 3:  voice 30 seconds ago. Yeah. What does that feel like?

755
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,400
Speaker 8:  I mean, for me, I like my voice. So I would rather just stick with my voice.

756
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,760
Speaker 8:  But coming from, I work with so many vocal producers or

757
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,600
Speaker 8:  producers in general top line writers that do not like their own voice at

758
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,120
Speaker 8:  all. And they have to manipulate it and tune it a lot to get it to the point

759
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,120
Speaker 8:  they would like to get it to. So if you're not a fan of your vocal tone,

760
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,520
Speaker 8:  but you can get your point across in a recording, then you can change out

761
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,120
Speaker 8:  your voice with something like this. And a lot of the work I do is I'll create

762
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,680
Speaker 8:  a full beat, I'll put on the top line myself, the lyrics and melody and everything

763
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,480
Speaker 8:  and then I'll send it to an artist. It's a pitch. And if they like the song,

764
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,680
Speaker 8:  they'll remove my top line and put theirs on and keep everything else. So

765
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,440
Speaker 8:  essentially You know you don't have to keep the AI generated voice, but it

766
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,160
Speaker 8:  gives a reference for a pitch situation. Interesting.

767
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:14,240
Speaker 7:  This is also just like an age old issue. People feel uncomfortable with their

768
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,920
Speaker 7:  voice and there have been hacks that we've used for decades,

769
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,720
Speaker 7:  whether that's reverb and compression or oftentimes, in fact, when you went

770
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,280
Speaker 7:  in the booth, the very common thing to do when you're trying to improvise

771
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,240
Speaker 7:  melodies and top line over a beat is you just put on autotune

772
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,880
Speaker 7:  almost to Max and it lets you be looser and freer.

773
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Speaker 7:  And so I think there's actually something very, yeah there, there's something

774
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,600
Speaker 7:  liberating about being like, ah, I don't feel good about my voice, but I

775
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,440
Speaker 7:  know I can make a song and I can make it sound better if I just You know

776
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,760
Speaker 7:  work. Massage it with these tools. Neil, how

777
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:42,960
Speaker 14:  Do you feel

778
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,840
Speaker 8:  About your singing voice?

779
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:44,480
Speaker 14:  Yeah.

780
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,880
Speaker 8:  2, 3, 4

781
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,720
Speaker 14:  You know, when I was in the punk band in college, I sang with a British

782
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,160
Speaker 14:  accent.

783
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,880
Speaker 8:  That's AI right there.

784
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,400
Speaker 14:  That's just some straight Al Jorgenson did it in ministry and I'm gonna

785
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,280
Speaker 14:  do it too. And that's, that was the road I was in. You know you said there's

786
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,160
Speaker 14:  copyright issues. There aren't though. That's, that's actually the thing,

787
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,400
Speaker 14:  right? That your voice is not protected in that way. There's like a handful

788
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,120
Speaker 14:  of laws at the state level that might protect it, but no, none of has ever

789
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,040
Speaker 14:  been tested. And the real question is not can I sing into

790
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,640
Speaker 14:  a computer and have it sound like whoever so I can send it to someone else

791
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:21,120
Speaker 14:  and they can, it's can I distribute that and tell

792
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,240
Speaker 14:  everyone it was Drake? Right. Or tell everyone that it, it sounded

793
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:25,880
Speaker 14:  alike to Drake.

794
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,640
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I mean I'm pretty sure we can't release any part of what we've made

795
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,080
Speaker 7:  more because of licensing issues rather than copyright issues. Because some

796
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,760
Speaker 7:  of these tools we've used probably have some kind of license that needs purchased

797
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,640
Speaker 7:  to be able to then You know, use some of their sounds. And we did not do

798
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,240
Speaker 7:  all of that perfectly.

799
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,960
Speaker 14:  I promised David that I would bring up the thong song on today's episode

800
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,920
Speaker 14:  of The Verge House. Well, what's fascinating about the music industry right

801
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,520
Speaker 14:  now, and Charla and I have talked about this lots of times, is that the

802
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:53,200
Speaker 14:  norms inside the music industry about sample usage, about interpolation,

803
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,920
Speaker 14:  about all this stuff have almost nothing to do anymore with

804
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,000
Speaker 14:  copyright law. So I know this fact about the thong song

805
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,640
Speaker 14:  now, and I will come back to it over and over again. Cisco does not own

806
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,360
Speaker 14:  the publishing to the thong song because he said live in La Vita Loca

807
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,040
Speaker 14:  in that song one time. Oh wow.

808
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:10,840
Speaker 7:  No way. In

809
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,320
Speaker 14:  The chorus. And Ricky Martin's songwriter came and took it and makes all

810
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,960
Speaker 14:  the money every time that song is played. Wow. That's ridiculous to me.

811
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,320
Speaker 14:  T-Pain, I think that just this week revealed that he owns almost none of

812
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,080
Speaker 14:  the publishing to bayou a drink. 'cause there's all these little quotes

813
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,840
Speaker 14:  in it and all those people came for him and they took his publishing away.

814
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,560
Speaker 14:  Right. Wow. And that's like, they didn't go to court. The norms, they're

815
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,200
Speaker 14:  just lawyering up and Yeah, norms pressuring people, the norm in the music

816
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,480
Speaker 14:  industry are just like, we're gonna, we've built this other system.

817
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,600
Speaker 14:  And it, if you just described that to you, it's like if you just whisper

818
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,480
Speaker 14:  the phrase live in La Vita loca like Ricky Martin appears and like takes

819
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,160
Speaker 14:  your money away is, that's not right. Like it doesn't, it doesn't sit right

820
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,120
Speaker 14:  with me anyway. And I think this AI stuff is gonna lead to like

821
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,200
Speaker 14:  a supercharged version of that where like the

822
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,320
Speaker 14:  computer is automatically giving Ricky Martin money because it's

823
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,280
Speaker 14:  been trained on his, like that seems like it will fall apart.

824
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,720
Speaker 3:  Well it seems, it seems to me like it goes one of two ways where either those

825
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:11,560
Speaker 3:  norms become really, really, really aggressive and

826
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,800
Speaker 3:  careful and everybody becomes very litigious about everything like you're

827
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,600
Speaker 3:  talking about. Or it goes the other way and we end up in this place where

828
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,080
Speaker 3:  it sort of, nobody owns anything. It's just like pure anarchy and chaos.

829
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,400
Speaker 3:  That's, that's not right. 'cause you don't know. But we're gonna get to this

830
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:23,920
Speaker 3:  point now where, I don't

831
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,720
Speaker 14:  Dunno if the music industry, I mean everybody's

832
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,720
Speaker 3:  Gonna get real litigious at the beginning, but like what we're

833
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,240
Speaker 14:  Going through once described as a cruel and shallow money trench,

834
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,520
Speaker 3:  But like we're going through this with chat G P T right now, right? Yeah.

835
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,480
Speaker 3:  Where it's like, they're like, oh, well this sounds like the book that I

836
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,520
Speaker 3:  read or that I wrote and open ai. It's just like, who's to say? And

837
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,280
Speaker 3:  it's just we're we're just like, we're putting so many black boxes between

838
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,160
Speaker 3:  I made something and something else exists that is kind of similar to the

839
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,640
Speaker 3:  thing that I made that I wonder if it's just gonna get harder and harder

840
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,720
Speaker 3:  to understand provenance and where all this stuff came from

841
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,480
Speaker 3:  and what counts as a sample and who's responsible and where, and it's just

842
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,200
Speaker 3:  like, I, I suspect,

843
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,480
Speaker 14:  But this, when you say, how do you about side of this, this is the thing

844
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,240
Speaker 14:  that I, that gives me the most uncomfortable feeling because they're not

845
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,720
Speaker 14:  gonna not try. Right. And they're gonna, they're already trying really hard.

846
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,400
Speaker 14:  Like YouTube has a deal with Universal, which seems very terrifying to me.

847
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,960
Speaker 14:  And they've already built this bizarre system

848
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,280
Speaker 14:  where Charlie came out and we talked about Olivia Rodrigo's public handing

849
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,960
Speaker 14:  out publishing credits on an episode of Decoder, where Olivia Rodrigo's

850
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,440
Speaker 14:  like, fine, Paramore can have a credit, even though probably shouldn't.

851
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,200
Speaker 14:  Right. Or like, they, the Taylor Swift ones are Swift, the Taylor Swift

852
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,840
Speaker 14:  ones even more really shaky. Right. And it's like the industry has decided

853
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,400
Speaker 14:  they don't, inside the family, they're not gonna fight. Right. And the famous

854
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,520
Speaker 14:  people will just like, collect some money from new artists, and you just

855
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,120
Speaker 14:  keep spinning that up with AI and you're like, oh, eventually the rich are

856
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,840
Speaker 14:  just gonna get richer here. And like, ways that I think

857
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,280
Speaker 14:  disincentivizes anyone from trying to make anything new, like you might

858
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,080
Speaker 14:  as well in that case then just try to flip samples as creatively as possible

859
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,920
Speaker 14:  and hand the money back out. Right. And that, that's the feeling

860
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,480
Speaker 14:  here, that it's like the music industry's response to AI

861
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:09,120
Speaker 14:  is to become even more corporate in, in a way

862
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,200
Speaker 14:  that just makes me like, like I'm an old punk rocker. Like, that seems like

863
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,880
Speaker 14:  not what you should do, You know. Like, yeah, you should, like,

864
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:20,160
Speaker 14:  the kids should revolt against all of that. And like, Olivia Rod

865
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
Speaker 14:  should be like, I'm, I'm definitely not paying you.

866
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,640
Speaker 8:  But in the same way, the industry, as I've noticed,

867
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,040
Speaker 3:  Is getting a lot polite in

868
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,840
Speaker 8:  Some ways. And I realize when we think about that, it, it might not look

869
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,120
Speaker 8:  that way, but You know when I have writing sessions with people now that

870
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,720
Speaker 8:  there'll be four people in a room, and let's say three of us do 90%, not

871
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,520
Speaker 8:  99% of the work, and the other person lays one base note down,

872
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,440
Speaker 8:  that's four equal splits on publishing. Yeah. And I, I kind of see it the

873
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,280
Speaker 8:  same way with You know you're anticipating the lawsuit and there's gonna

874
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,480
Speaker 8:  have to be a payout regardless and like all this stuff just to make it go

875
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,840
Speaker 8:  away. Like there's definitely that side of it, that's why you add the credits

876
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:57,800
Speaker 8:  initially. But it's more so just like a, I don't know, a peace

877
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,760
Speaker 8:  offering of kindness to be like, here, take this. And it is cool seeing people

878
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,720
Speaker 8:  like You know a higher up artists that are handing out

879
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,200
Speaker 8:  to like lower level artists, these publishing credits and that kind of thing

880
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,760
Speaker 8:  too. So I don't know. The way I think about it's, it is getting polite, but

881
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,160
Speaker 8:  yeah, when we thinking about AI in the industry, it's, it's

882
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,280
Speaker 8:  corporations Yeah.

883
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,120
Speaker 14:  Which is scary. And, and then it's automated. That's the thing that gets

884
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,920
Speaker 14:  me. It's like, okay, some artists are handing out some credits

885
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,960
Speaker 14:  as they go through a writing session. Okay. Like I, I don't know how

886
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,560
Speaker 14:  you feel about Ricky Martin, but like, yes or no that happened Right? On

887
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,840
Speaker 14:  the flip side, it's like, okay, I made a song using ai, uploaded it to YouTube.

888
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,880
Speaker 14:  YouTube is like, Drake gets a piece of this. Yeah.

889
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,720
Speaker 7:  I mean, I don't make switch dot pop video versions for YouTube

890
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,120
Speaker 7:  because the content ID system is such a pain. Yeah. That I don't wanna deal

891
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,760
Speaker 7:  with it because it will demonetize everything. You have to fight everything.

892
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,960
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Even for journalistic purposes, if you use any copyright material,

893
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:53,600
Speaker 7:  which is absolutely fair use YouTube just is its own government,

894
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,240
Speaker 7:  right? Yeah. With its own set of id. It's, it's not actually a copyright

895
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,200
Speaker 7:  issue. It is a set of private contracts between copyright holders with

896
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:05,160
Speaker 7:  YouTube that has a system that you have to go through that is its own court.

897
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,160
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And it's just such a pain that I don't deal with it and I'd rather

898
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,680
Speaker 7:  just make a podcast.

899
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:09,480
Speaker 8:  Right.

900
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:13,400
Speaker 3:  Charlie, you were mentioning before, like you didn't do this process of

901
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,520
Speaker 3:  making all this stuff in the most sort of like upstanding pay everybody who

902
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,360
Speaker 3:  should weigh, but like you left a trail that every one of these services

903
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:24,960
Speaker 3:  knows about. Right. And and to your point, as they get better at doing things

904
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,720
Speaker 3:  like having deals with record labels and stuff, like, it may be true

905
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,760
Speaker 3:  that that money just like slowly starts to disappear every time you open

906
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,920
Speaker 3:  a new app. Yeah. And right now this stuff is happening like in Discords and

907
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,560
Speaker 3:  like one of the most popular things is like a, it's in a Google drive and

908
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,520
Speaker 3:  you just upload your file to a Google Drive and then download it from a different

909
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,440
Speaker 3:  Google Drive. And it's like, that is fine and gonna be hard

910
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,360
Speaker 3:  for anyone to figure out how to make money off of. Right. But eventually,

911
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,040
Speaker 3:  if this stuff gets better as quickly as people think it's going to, it's

912
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,480
Speaker 3:  going to get corporatized too. They're gonna make these same deals and then

913
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,200
Speaker 3:  all of a sudden as you make music, you're just gonna leave these like

914
00:52:59,250 --> 00:52:59,920
Speaker 3:  bread crumbs,

915
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,240
Speaker 7:  A number of these services claim to have watermarks within them so that they

916
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,480
Speaker 7:  could identify automatically with, with systems if you haven't properly licensed.

917
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,840
Speaker 14:  Do you believe them? Mm. You know how like the B B C used to drive around

918
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,680
Speaker 14:  London with a truck that could detect TV antennas if you didn't pay the

919
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:14,800
Speaker 14:  fee.

920
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,480
Speaker 14:  I'm just saying, man,

921
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,320
Speaker 7:  I think the question is how good do AIS get at tracking those things down

922
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,040
Speaker 7:  for them? Because it's a pain to to to, yeah. To, to enforce. But

923
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,440
Speaker 7:  I think enforcement of copyright will get significantly easier. I mean, there

924
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,520
Speaker 7:  are people making very effective d r M tools that can basically track every

925
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:36,280
Speaker 7:  misuse of copyright on Instagram. People just, 'cause Instagram is basically

926
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,440
Speaker 7:  a one giant copyright cluster, right? Yeah. People are taking people's intellectual

927
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,640
Speaker 7:  property all the time and reposting it without permission and no one's really

928
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,200
Speaker 7:  enforcing it. 'cause it's difficult. But there are companies that can help

929
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,520
Speaker 7:  you do so if you want to. But

930
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,320
Speaker 8:  It's also mind numbing because, so I, I put out a song that was a hundred

931
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,480
Speaker 8:  percent, or I wrote it, I did everything on it. I had a hundred percent of

932
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,400
Speaker 8:  the master, a hundred percent of the publishing. I put a TikTok video out

933
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,680
Speaker 8:  using that audio, and the audio got removed for copyright. No.

934
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,520
Speaker 7:  Wait, what?

935
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,960
Speaker 8:  I own it. Yeah. Yeah.

936
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,360
Speaker 14:  But this is so like all these automated systems have some error rate. Yeah.

937
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,240
Speaker 8:  Right. A hundred percent

938
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,360
Speaker 14:  I can post my own song will just take

939
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,920
Speaker 7:  Did you have any, did they tell you like, what, what did you do wrong?

940
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,680
Speaker 14:  You literally violated your own copyright. Exactly. The estate of Marvin

941
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,200
Speaker 14:  Gaye I to

942
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,920
Speaker 8:  Shame myself, this

943
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,160
Speaker 7:  Is, this is why I actually, when need the, I music was mad. We can't make

944
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,200
Speaker 7:  music anymore because it's so attention

945
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,880
Speaker 14:  Is what I'm, this is what I'm saying. You build these systems with this

946
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,920
Speaker 14:  weird understanding of who gets paid and why inside of it.

947
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,720
Speaker 14:  And the answer is because you exist and you might sue us.

948
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,160
Speaker 14:  And then the error rate in the system makes it so new artists

949
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,640
Speaker 14:  can't upload their own music. And it's like, well, that's not the, that's

950
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,000
Speaker 14:  just definitely the, the wrong outcome you make, I'll give you the,

951
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:46,600
Speaker 14:  the blurred lines example. Like you open an AI drum program and

952
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,760
Speaker 14:  you're like, give me a Marvin Gaye beat. Yeah. And the state of Marvin Gaye

953
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,960
Speaker 14:  is like, that sounds too much like any song. We're

954
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,600
Speaker 8:  You down? Can you not Where you could prove that AI made it and that you

955
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,960
Speaker 8:  could like, like counter Sue and

956
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:02,200
Speaker 14:  Yeah, I just think like that's the thing. Like that's the feeling I

957
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,160
Speaker 14:  get with all this stuff is once you just add this much software to the creative

958
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,000
Speaker 14:  process and the pressure on the software is to do automated

959
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,880
Speaker 14:  enforcement or automated credits or to not do things

960
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,720
Speaker 14:  to protect you, it's like, oh, we've just pushed creativity into

961
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,840
Speaker 14:  one tiny little box.

962
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,960
Speaker 7:  I I honestly, throughout this whole conversation, I'm still wondering like,

963
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,160
Speaker 7:  what is even the point of using any of these tools? Because in music at this

964
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,120
Speaker 7:  point, there's just no scarcity. If you want a sound, it exists. You can

965
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,720
Speaker 7:  get it for free or cheap. If you want professional level tools, you can use

966
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,480
Speaker 7:  them with a decent computer. There are free tools available to make

967
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,840
Speaker 7:  very high quality music. Like if you asked us to go do this process again

968
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,400
Speaker 7:  using only a hundred dollars guitar and plugins that were free off the internet,

969
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,720
Speaker 7:  we would make a much better song.

970
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,400
Speaker 8:  No, just band Lab. So Band Lab. Oh, band Lab. Yeah. Band lab.com entirely

971
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:52,200
Speaker 8:  free. And anyone can use it. I guarantee you, you just, you just pick

972
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:55,440
Speaker 8:  loops and you drop 'em in and it manipulates them and makes 'em all fit together.

973
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:59,120
Speaker 8:  I've taught band lab to eight year old children and they had it like that.

974
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:03,240
Speaker 8:  Wow. And it's so, so easy to use. So, and it's free and everything is

975
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,520
Speaker 8:  yours. It's entirely royalty Freeda.

976
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,640
Speaker 7:  Why? But we don't need these tools to make music for us unless there's there,

977
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,640
Speaker 7:  there's definitely like the amateur who's trying to learn or wants to express

978
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,880
Speaker 7:  something, I think is certainly interesting. But as, as You know, working

979
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,280
Speaker 7:  professional, it's kinda like if you want the high quality sound,

980
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,800
Speaker 7:  you're not getting it from these things. So why even like, deal with the

981
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,200
Speaker 7:  future headache that Neli is discussing. You put yourself in that world.

982
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:25,960
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah.

983
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,560
Speaker 14:  But our, this is just at the bottom of the curve though. I mean, that's

984
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,120
Speaker 14:  kind of Right. This is the, the 8 0 8 example. Like it didn't work for that

985
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,560
Speaker 14:  workflow, and then the stuff got discarded and then people who were not

986
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,840
Speaker 14:  part of the gate cap system were like, we're gonna use it for our own thing.

987
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,760
Speaker 14:  And that became a dominant sound like, right. That's the pro case

988
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:42,120
Speaker 14:  here.

989
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:46,360
Speaker 7:  There's also the, like this idea that culture radically shifts and that

990
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,360
Speaker 7:  all we want is completely individualized art, which doesn't seem very

991
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:54,160
Speaker 7:  human. Yeah. But perhaps that happens. And then like, yeah, we all make our

992
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,920
Speaker 7:  own songs that are in our own perfect little world. The thing is right now,

993
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,720
Speaker 7:  like already there is so much high quality library music,

994
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,720
Speaker 7:  You know, like, like better pharma sounding music that you could go

995
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,680
Speaker 7:  listen to, which is like your own special personalized playlist. And I actually

996
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,760
Speaker 7:  just, that's not what people usually want. They wanna like be in conversation

997
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,080
Speaker 7:  with culture, what other people are doing. And so that, that world doesn't

998
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,000
Speaker 7:  really make sense to

999
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,040
Speaker 3:  Me. Yeah. And it goes back to something you were saying at the very beginning,

1000
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,720
Speaker 3:  which is like, if you, if what you want is an easier way to make

1001
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:25,640
Speaker 3:  like a music bed for your YouTube video Yeah. Tools

1002
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,640
Speaker 3:  abound and they're getting better very quickly. If you want something that

1003
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,560
Speaker 3:  is like good and high quality and will make you feel things and care about

1004

1007
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,440
Speaker 7:  time. Like, like I just, we just did an episode, You know with Jimmy Buffet

00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,880
Speaker 7:  just find Jimmy Buffet esque music? And I couldn't find anything good

1011
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,280
Speaker 7:  on Splice and I went to some AI tools and was like, make me a Jimmy Buffett

00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,200
Speaker 7:  song. And I was just like, screw it. This is so annoying. I brought out my

1013
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,160
Speaker 7:  acoustic guitar and I just strum some chords and it sounded way better than

1014
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,320
