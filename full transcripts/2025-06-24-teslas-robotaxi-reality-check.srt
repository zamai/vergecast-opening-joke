Description: Tesla is famous for throwing caution to the wind in the name of rolling out cool technology, so it was somewhat surprising to see its robotaxi service launch over the weekend in somewhat muted fashion. The Verge's Andy Hawkins joins the show to explain what, exactly, Elon Musk and co. launched, and what it says about the state of the self-driving revolution. After that, The Verge's Allison Johnson takes us through the history of MVNOs, and why they might just be the best deal in wireless carriers. We talk about Trump Mobile, Ryan Reynolds, e-SIMs, and what it would mean to make it easier to switch service. Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline about how to free up storage on your iPhone. It's harder than it should be, but hopefully easier than you think.


2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:07,115
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of being unsupervised.

3
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:10,115
Speaker 1:  I'm m your friend David Pierce. And I'm doing, I think I've talked about

4
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:13,235
Speaker 1:  this on the show before, my annual ish

5
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:17,875
Speaker 1:  full on backup of everything. So over the years, I've, I've basically developed

6
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:22,355
Speaker 1:  a rule about how I think about files and folders and stuff. I

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,395
Speaker 1:  want to have them in three places. And anything that doesn't allow this,

8
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:29,475
Speaker 1:  I try not to use, I want to have all my stuff, like in whatever app I'm using,

9
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:33,515
Speaker 1:  whether it's notes or photos or to-dos or bookmarks or

10
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,515
Speaker 1:  whatever. I want to have it all somewhere. And then I want to have it all

11
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:40,995
Speaker 1:  in a, some other sort of cloud storage thing, Google Drive,

12
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:44,515
Speaker 1:  Dropbox, Microsoft, pick your poison. And then I wanna have it all

13
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:48,235
Speaker 1:  somewhere on a physical drive. And that usually means things like

14
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:52,195
Speaker 1:  text backups and a lot of like HDML and PDF

15
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:55,755
Speaker 1:  downloads. And this is the time of year when I try to make sure that all

16
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:59,395
Speaker 1:  of that is intact. In theory, I should do this a lot more often. I should

17
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:02,635
Speaker 1:  do this like once a month or once a week. There was a time where I did it

18
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:06,465
Speaker 1:  once a week and was like very diligent and proud of myself, not so much

19
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:09,905
Speaker 1:  recently. So now what I'm doing is I'm downloading all of my photos, I'm

20
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:13,305
Speaker 1:  downloading all of my notes as text and markdown files. I'm downloading all

21
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:17,265
Speaker 1:  of the bookmarks and stuff. I have, I'm downloading like browser history,

22
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:20,705
Speaker 1:  which I'm confident is not a thing I'm ever gonna need. But basically anything

23
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:24,625
Speaker 1:  I can turn into some kind of searchable archivable file

24
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:29,105
Speaker 1:  gets downloaded, gets put on a drive like this one, I have a couple of them

25
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,865
Speaker 1:  lying around. And I try to just make sure it all lives

26
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:36,825
Speaker 1:  there. And this is a way of like backing everything up without

27
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:40,105
Speaker 1:  making my life more complicated, which I like. Right? This is just like a

28
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:44,105
Speaker 1:  permanent archive that in theory I never have to touch. I think very

29
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,265
Speaker 1:  rarely have I ever actually had to go onto this drive and find something.

30
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:50,345
Speaker 1:  It's just a fail safe and it works for me. I got inspired to do this, by

31
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:54,185
Speaker 1:  the way, by today's hotline question, which we will come to at the end of

32
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:58,145
Speaker 1:  the show. It's a fun one and an annoying one, and we'll get

33
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:01,985
Speaker 1:  to that. But anyway, before we get to all that, today is not just about storage

34
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:05,225
Speaker 1:  and file backup, though. I could talk about that for hours. We're gonna do

35
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:07,905
Speaker 1:  two things on the show today. First, we're gonna talk to Andy Hawkins about

36
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:11,865
Speaker 1:  the slightly complicated Tesla taxii

37
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,505
Speaker 1:  announcement over the weekend. And we're also gonna just catch up on the

38
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:19,345
Speaker 1:  state of Robotaxis in general because this market continues to be very

39
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:23,145
Speaker 1:  confusing and is moving both slower and faster somehow

40
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:27,225
Speaker 1:  than you might think. I'm also gonna talk to Alison Johnson about MVNOs this

41
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:31,025
Speaker 1:  new type of wireless carrier that suddenly seems to be everywhere

42
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:35,265
Speaker 1:  And I think might be more important than we realize. There's Trump Mobile,

43
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:39,265
Speaker 1:  there's Mint Mobile, there's like Boost, but there's something bigger

44
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:42,905
Speaker 1:  happening here. And Allison And I are gonna try to figure out what it's all

45
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:46,185
Speaker 1:  that is coming up in just a second plus more stuff on storage.

46
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:50,065
Speaker 1:  But first we have to take a break and I have to go and download, let's see,

47
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:53,145
Speaker 1:  11,000 photos for MyCloud Drive.

48
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:56,215
Speaker 1:  Pray for me. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

49
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:49,435
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Andy Hawkins is here. Hi Andy. Hi.

50
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:50,315
Speaker 5:  How's it going?

51
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:55,195
Speaker 1:  You know, I once again have to talk about robo taxis that both do and

52
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,955
Speaker 1:  don't exist. So this is that, that question fills me with a lot of

53
00:04:58,955 --> 00:04:59,955
Speaker 1:  confusing feelings.

54
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:04,915
Speaker 1:  There was a launch this weekend, we would say, is that, is that a fair

55
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,475
Speaker 1:  assessment of what happened? Something

56
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:11,595
Speaker 5:  Happened, a a thing happened. Okay. It was, I

57
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:15,315
Speaker 5:  don't know if you could call it a launch. It still feels very beta to me.

58
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:19,315
Speaker 5:  Okay. In many ways, but we can get into that. But yes, I, I guess one could

59
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:21,075
Speaker 5:  argue a thing was launched.

60
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:24,635
Speaker 1:  Okay, so what, what did happen this weekend? Like what there was a, there

61
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:28,595
Speaker 1:  was a small, I'm, I was very confused by this because Tesla is

62
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,235
Speaker 1:  a company that like does big splashy things

63
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:36,115
Speaker 1:  at the, at headquarters all the time and is like constantly making noise

64
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:39,595
Speaker 1:  about these huge announcements. And then this, what you would think would

65
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:43,555
Speaker 1:  be a big moment in Tesla's history, just kind of sneakily came and

66
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:45,115
Speaker 1:  went on a Sunday. What, what happened here?

67
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:49,195
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it it was very muted. You're you're absolutely

68
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:52,835
Speaker 5:  right in that assessment, which is, which is not normal for Tesla,

69
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:56,635
Speaker 5:  but then again we're, this is Tesla and, and so few things are normal for

70
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:59,965
Speaker 5:  this company. But yes, what happened was on Sunday,

71
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:04,885
Speaker 5:  June 22nd for several hours, a handful

72
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:08,565
Speaker 5:  of Tesla vehicles were operating in the city of Boston,

73
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:12,525
Speaker 5:  Texas with no one in the driver's seat. And they picked up and dropped off

74
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:16,325
Speaker 5:  a bunch of passengers. Many of those people were Tesla

75
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:17,685
Speaker 5:  fans, extremely so

76
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:18,845
Speaker 1:  Sure

77
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:22,805
Speaker 5:  The most vocal of, of Tesla fans one could say.

78
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:27,365
Speaker 5:  And that is why they were allowed to ride in the cars. They were,

79
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:31,325
Speaker 5:  it was an invite only situation. So these invites went

80
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:34,725
Speaker 5:  out to all of Elon Musk's best friends, and

81
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,445
Speaker 5:  they got to ride in these driverless Tesla vehicles. And

82
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:41,725
Speaker 5:  I'm saying driverless because there was no one behind the steering wheel,

83
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:45,405
Speaker 5:  but they were not the unsupervised robotaxis that Musk

84
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,605
Speaker 5:  promised at the beginning of this year because there were Tesla

85
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:53,925
Speaker 5:  employees sitting as safety monitors in the passenger seat.

86
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:57,805
Speaker 5:  They didn't have steering wheels or pedals on their side, but they could

87
00:06:57,805 --> 00:07:01,645
Speaker 5:  effectively hit a kill switch and stop the vehicle from operating if

88
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:05,525
Speaker 5:  they wanted to. As far as I could tell, I watched a lot of live streams

89
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:09,485
Speaker 5:  that that is one thing that Tesla fans online love to do is live stream

90
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:13,285
Speaker 5:  their cars using full self-driving. True. And so when the Robotaxis

91
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:17,005
Speaker 5:  came up, they were ready to live stream. So I watched many, many,

92
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:21,045
Speaker 5:  several hours long videos of these live streams.

93
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:21,525
Speaker 5:  So

94
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,365
Speaker 1:  What, what is the rider experience? As best you can tell? You have, you didn't

95
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,445
Speaker 1:  get to ride in one, you weren't in Austin, but like you said, you, you've

96
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,885
Speaker 1:  seen these, so like walk me through a, a ride in a Tesla

97
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:31,365
Speaker 1:  RoboTaxi is far as we know.

98
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:35,845
Speaker 5:  So from what I could tell, there is a, a separate app that is not the Tesla

99
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:39,885
Speaker 5:  app. It is a standalone robax app. You download that app, it ports over

100
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:43,845
Speaker 5:  your profile from the Tesla app, including all of your

101
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:47,565
Speaker 5:  preferences and all those things. And then you can hail a vehicle using this

102
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:50,725
Speaker 5:  app much in the same way that Uber, Uber works. Yeah. Okay. It's basically

103
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:53,285
Speaker 5:  Uber. Okay. And that was something that a lot of these folks were saying

104
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:57,085
Speaker 5:  that this is a very similar experience to Uber. The vehicles

105
00:07:57,085 --> 00:08:01,045
Speaker 5:  only operated in a very small part of South Austin. It's

106
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:04,645
Speaker 5:  not clear to me how large a size of a geofence this is, but it is

107
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:08,365
Speaker 5:  very small, much smaller than Waymo's geofence in Austin.

108
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:11,565
Speaker 5:  Waymo right now has over a hundred vehicles operating

109
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:16,405
Speaker 5:  across Austin. I think the, the, the, their geofence is around 65 square

110
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:20,325
Speaker 5:  miles. Teslas was much smaller, so you had to initiate a

111
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:24,085
Speaker 5:  ride in the geofence. And, and also the, the destination needed to be

112
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:27,765
Speaker 5:  also within this same geofence. So you were seeing a lot of people

113
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:32,085
Speaker 5:  call rides to their hotels or they would drive into the geofence to

114
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:36,085
Speaker 5:  use, to use the, the roboto taxii service, hail a vehicle and then take

115
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,525
Speaker 5:  a ride to like a fried chicken place or something like that. Sure. And a

116
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:43,405
Speaker 5:  lot of these people, folks were, would take a ride, they would get out at

117
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,325
Speaker 5:  their destination and then they would immediately hail another ride. They

118
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,685
Speaker 5:  were sort of just like in a, a, a, a, a revolving cycle.

119
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:50,485
Speaker 5:  Right?

120
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:54,765
Speaker 1:  So you use the app, you get this car, it comes, you, you

121
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:58,685
Speaker 1:  get in it and there's no one, there's not like a person to drive

122
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:02,605
Speaker 1:  away, but there is a person in the front seat. Yes.

123
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:06,205
Speaker 1:  This is like the, the dynamics of the, like, how do I get in and start the

124
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:10,165
Speaker 1:  ride? Strike me as potentially deeply hilarious in this, in this moment.

125
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,925
Speaker 1:  Like, you have a driver, but they're not driving. Yeah.

126
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,645
Speaker 5:  And I think it is, we should also just be really clear here. Like the idea

127
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:20,485
Speaker 5:  of a safety driver or a safety monitor, extremely common in the autonomous

128
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:24,405
Speaker 5:  vehicle space. Waymo Cruz, everyone basically has

129
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:28,245
Speaker 5:  used a safety driver at some point, either behind the steering wheel

130
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:32,485
Speaker 5:  in the passenger, sometimes both. I've been in self-driving cars where there

131
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,725
Speaker 5:  was two people in the front seat. Their hands were, you know, sort of off

132
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:38,645
Speaker 5:  off all the controls, but they were there to, to take control if something

133
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:42,645
Speaker 5:  happened. Those were during test phases, I think is is the real

134
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:46,205
Speaker 5:  important thing to, to, to make clear here. And what

135
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,805
Speaker 5:  Tesla is doing is, is pretty unique in, in the, in the field. And so far

136
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:53,245
Speaker 5:  as they're using these safety monitors as part of a commercial service.

137
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:57,805
Speaker 5:  Again, not open to the public yet. It'll be interesting to see if they

138
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,325
Speaker 5:  do open it to the public, whether they keep the safety monitors in or whether

139
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:04,805
Speaker 5:  they pull those folks out. But at this stage of the game, these are

140
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:08,765
Speaker 5:  paid rides. Elon Musk has said he's charging a flat rate of $4

141
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:12,965
Speaker 5:  and 20 cents entirely coincidental. I'm sure that price, of course.

142
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:13,765
Speaker 5:  $4 and 20 cents. Yeah.

143
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:17,085
Speaker 1:  I'm sure the accountants went over that one rigorously to figure out

144
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:21,045
Speaker 5:  The exact correct number has no meaning. I'm sure that I could tell. But

145
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:24,005
Speaker 5:  you know, these are paid rides. Got that safety monitor in, in the, in the

146
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,925
Speaker 5:  the passenger seat. I saw a few videos where the rider were,

147
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,605
Speaker 5:  would try to interact and ask questions of the safety monitor.

148
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:35,085
Speaker 5:  That person was not having it. They were, I think it's pretty clear that

149
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:38,605
Speaker 5:  their instructions were Don't talk to the passengers. Sure. Don't touch the

150
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,485
Speaker 5:  controls unless you absolutely have to. And we can get to this,

151
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:46,405
Speaker 5:  but there was one incident that I saw where one of the vehicles

152
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:50,365
Speaker 5:  drove briefly in the opposite lane of traffic on the wrong side of the road.

153
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:53,005
Speaker 5:  Oh dear. And I thought it was super interesting, first of all that it did

154
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:56,925
Speaker 5:  that. Second of all, that the safety monitor made no attempt to grab

155
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:00,685
Speaker 5:  the steering wheel or do anything, even though the vehicle was

156
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:04,005
Speaker 5:  briefly on the wrong side of the road. Wow. Operating

157
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:07,965
Speaker 5:  dangerously. So that's kind of an interesting thing about this whole Tesla

158
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:11,205
Speaker 5:  experience that is unique, I would say across the industry.

159
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:15,525
Speaker 1:  Unique in what sense? Like, I think part of the reason this this moment is

160
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:19,375
Speaker 1:  so interesting to me is it is both the launch of a

161
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:23,015
Speaker 1:  commercial product that real people can use for sure. But it is also very

162
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,695
Speaker 1:  much a testing phase, right? Like they're not making money on

163
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:30,655
Speaker 1:  $4 and 20 cents a ride. They're not doing this

164
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:34,495
Speaker 1:  in any kind of sort of meaningful volume for people that's gonna make

165
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:38,415
Speaker 1:  this make sense as an app to open when I just want to get somewhere. And

166
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:42,135
Speaker 1:  like this is very clearly a beta test. Right? And I think part of the

167
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,695
Speaker 1:  reason it's so interesting to me is that this is a moment

168
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:49,375
Speaker 1:  that Tesla, which has been talking a big game about

169
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:53,405
Speaker 1:  its autonomous abilities for a very long time, has

170
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:56,125
Speaker 1:  to actually show what it can do. Right? Like a thing you And I have talked

171
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,885
Speaker 1:  about before is like, don't listen to what Elon Musk tweets like listen to

172
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,405
Speaker 1:  what he says to investors because that's where you have to, you have to tell

173
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:04,165
Speaker 1:  the truth. And like when you put the car on the road is when you at some

174
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:08,085
Speaker 1:  point have to tell the truth. And this, especially compared to what we've

175
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:11,725
Speaker 1:  seen from Waymo recently, which is just on this like relentless massive

176
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:15,645
Speaker 1:  expansion plan. Like Waymo feels like it's close. And this to me

177
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:19,205
Speaker 1:  did not look like Tesla feels like it's close. This felt very small

178
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,925
Speaker 1:  from Tesla to me. And I think that's not a bad thing, it's just a recognition

179
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:25,925
Speaker 1:  of where Tesla is at this moment. Yeah. And I just found that, yeah, that

180
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,325
Speaker 1:  disparity in dichotomy sort of fascinating. Oh

181
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:32,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's super fascinating And I think it's a reflection of a, a few

182
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:36,045
Speaker 5:  things. I think you're spot on in your analysis so far. I think it, it's

183
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:39,645
Speaker 5:  a, it's, it's absolutely a reflection of where Tesla is at this moment, right?

184
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:43,445
Speaker 5:  Like they were on a tear for a few years, especially

185
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:47,365
Speaker 5:  during those post pandemic years where they were just,

186
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:51,005
Speaker 5:  their, their stock price was, you know, on the upward trajectory. They were

187
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:54,845
Speaker 5:  selling ton of vehicles super profitable. And then

188
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:58,605
Speaker 5:  you saw 2024 happen, the

189
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:02,525
Speaker 5:  Trump endorsement Elon Musk going full tilt on on

190
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:06,605
Speaker 5:  maga, dark maga, sorry. And then things start to to change pretty

191
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:09,885
Speaker 5:  drastically for the company sales started to drop, they ended

192
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:13,725
Speaker 5:  2024 having sold fewer vehicles than they did in 2023.

193
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,805
Speaker 5:  That was the first time in many years that that had happened. And, and then

194
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:20,645
Speaker 5:  as we've seen in the, in the, the, the first months of 2025,

195
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:23,805
Speaker 5:  that's gotten worse and worse as Musk has gotten more and more political

196
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:27,245
Speaker 5:  with Doge and his involvement in the Trump administration. So I think that

197
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:30,245
Speaker 5:  there was a sense at the company that needed to do something to recapture

198
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:34,125
Speaker 5:  the narrative, to justify this enormous valuation that the company's been

199
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:38,005
Speaker 5:  enjoying for such a long time where they are valued exponentially more than

200
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:42,005
Speaker 5:  your average car company. And that was all about robotics. Bus has been

201
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:45,525
Speaker 5:  talking about AI and robotics for such a long time without having

202
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:49,405
Speaker 5:  delivered a product to anybody. And it was just coasting on vibes, right?

203
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:53,245
Speaker 5:  Tesla was your prototypical meme stock. It was just chugging

204
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:57,045
Speaker 5:  along on the vibe train. And So I think as soon as

205
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,445
Speaker 5:  sales started to go down and you started to see sort of chips in the facade,

206
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,845
Speaker 5:  I I think that that's when the company decided, okay, we need to actually

207
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:07,565
Speaker 5:  start delivering on what we've been promising on what Musk has been promising

208
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:10,805
Speaker 5:  for such a long time. I mean, it's been almost a decade that it, since he

209
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:14,645
Speaker 5:  said millions of roboto taxis on the road within the next two

210
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,485
Speaker 5:  years and every year was su successively another two years. We just need

211
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:22,085
Speaker 5:  two more years to make this happen. And now they finally have to deliver

212
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:26,005
Speaker 5:  in order to reverse this trend as it's been going on in their financials.

213
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:29,645
Speaker 5:  And I think that's why this seems so small, so contained,

214
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:33,165
Speaker 5:  so rushed in many ways. I mean, it was just sort of like they needed to meet

215
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,765
Speaker 5:  this June deadline that he put in place at the beginning of this year and,

216
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:41,325
Speaker 5:  and it's just drastically different than what he's been selling to people

217
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:44,725
Speaker 5:  for such a long time. I mean the, the the, the vision of Tesla for, for forever

218
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,965
Speaker 5:  was you buy a Tesla vehicle, that vehicle is gonna be the one that is

219
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:52,285
Speaker 5:  fully driverless, right? We're gonna sell you this, this technology, you're

220
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:56,165
Speaker 5:  gonna be able to add your car to the Tesla network and make money off

221
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:59,965
Speaker 5:  of it. Right? Cars typically lose value as soon as they leave the

222
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,805
Speaker 5:  dealership. That's just the, the state of the game Tesla was, was saying.

223
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:07,005
Speaker 5:  It doesn't have to be that way. You could actually earn money off your vehicle.

224
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:11,045
Speaker 5:  It will become more valuable over time. That is not what is being

225
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,845
Speaker 5:  rolled out this week in Austin. This is a fleet service. It is more

226
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:17,805
Speaker 5:  akin to Uber and Waymo than it is to anything that Musk has been selling.

227
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:21,845
Speaker 5:  And I think that is is sort of why we're, what we're seeing today is, is

228
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:23,925
Speaker 5:  so different than what has been promised for such a long time.

229
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:28,205
Speaker 1:  Do you think anything that we've seen in this launch

230
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:32,445
Speaker 1:  either, either makes you feel more or less confident about some of those

231
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,845
Speaker 1:  bigger visions? I mean, obviously we, we should talk about the cyber cab,

232
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:38,005
Speaker 1:  which is notably not these cars, but that's fine.

233
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,605
Speaker 1:  And, and there have, there like, there is this big grand kind of

234
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:46,685
Speaker 1:  Galaxy brand, Tesla vision around Robotaxis. It's like you're talking

235
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,805
Speaker 1:  about, right? And I think none of this points to

236
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:54,045
Speaker 1:  that, but also none of this makes me feel like it's out of the question.

237
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:56,605
Speaker 1:  Does that make sense? Like, do you, do you feel like we're closer or further

238
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,165
Speaker 1:  away after seeing all this launch?

239
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:03,005
Speaker 5:  I mean, it's only been one day. Sure. And And I think that that's like

240
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,525
Speaker 5:  the thing that kind of makes me concerned. We, we can't, we can't really

241
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:10,125
Speaker 5:  evaluate any service after just the day we haven't tested it ourselves.

242
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:14,645
Speaker 5:  And the fact that it's being filtered through these extremely biased protest

243
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:18,045
Speaker 5:  accounts, I think should give everyone a lot of pause about what we're seeing

244
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:22,365
Speaker 5:  on the ground in Austin that said, you know, I think it's a good idea that

245
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:25,525
Speaker 5:  they have safety monitors in the front seat. You know, I think a lot of folks

246
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,965
Speaker 5:  are are trying to drag Tesla for doing that. But at the same time, I would

247
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:32,565
Speaker 5:  prefer there to be more, more safety, safety nets,

248
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:35,405
Speaker 5:  backups, fallbacks, all these kind of things that you need to have in place.

249
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:39,365
Speaker 5:  Because I think when you look at Tesla's technology versus Waymo or someone

250
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,245
Speaker 5:  else, you can see why there is this concern about

251
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:46,645
Speaker 5:  how this company has been rolling these things out over the years. The fact

252
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:50,125
Speaker 5:  that it's computer vision only system without relying on things like radar

253
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:54,445
Speaker 5:  and lidar as secondary sensor inputs. And

254
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:58,605
Speaker 5:  the fact that, you know, full self-driving as a product has been shown many

255
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:01,485
Speaker 5:  times. A lot of people like it, a lot of people use it. But there have been

256
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:05,245
Speaker 5:  numerous cases of, of crashes that have taken places, injuries

257
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:09,765
Speaker 5:  with Tesla's driver assist products, even deaths there. And the

258
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:13,605
Speaker 5:  government has been investigating Tesla for a number of years now based on

259
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:16,125
Speaker 5:  how they market their products, but also the technology itself and whether

260
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,005
Speaker 5:  or not it is actually safe as they market it

261
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,765
Speaker 5:  to be. And we don't know because Tesla as a company is a black box. We have

262
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:27,725
Speaker 5:  no visibility into the safety of their products. They give us safety

263
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:31,365
Speaker 5:  statistics that are extremely selective and are designed to make the company

264
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:35,045
Speaker 5:  look good and are not actually verifiable in any way or

265
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:39,205
Speaker 5:  peer reviewed in the ways that Waymo has done with their safety data. They

266
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:43,005
Speaker 5:  have published numerous articles in scientific journals, peer reviewed

267
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:46,725
Speaker 5:  scientific journals that they say show that their vehicles cause fewer

268
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:50,685
Speaker 5:  crashes. Cause fewer injuries. Cause fewer deaths. Tesla has not

269
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:54,325
Speaker 5:  done that. And yet they're now on the road in a city without

270
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:58,245
Speaker 5:  drivers behind the wheel. It's been one day I think we need

271
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,085
Speaker 5:  to take a deep breath and, and, and cross our fingers and hope that nothing

272
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:02,445
Speaker 5:  goes wrong.

273
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:05,805
Speaker 1:  That's fair. Yeah. I think, I think that's right And I think it, it seems

274
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,165
Speaker 1:  to me that we're in a position of

275
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:12,805
Speaker 1:  sort of uncharted territory with Tesla, which is that actually reading about

276
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:16,725
Speaker 1:  a lot of this, this is much more careful than I've come to

277
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,645
Speaker 1:  expect from Tesla. Oh yeah, actually, yeah. This is, this is the sort of

278
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:23,405
Speaker 1:  thing that I think 12 months ago Tesla even would've just been like, it's

279
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:27,325
Speaker 1:  out there, pools go see what happens. And this is like, this is

280
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:31,205
Speaker 1:  the kind of like very thought through very small, very cautious

281
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:34,925
Speaker 1:  thing that we actually don't expect from Tesla. And a,

282
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:38,125
Speaker 1:  I think that's terrific, right? Like that is clearly the correct outcome

283
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:42,005
Speaker 1:  given where we are. But it's so unlike Tesla that it, it it almost feels

284
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,485
Speaker 1:  scarier as a result. And,

285
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,365
Speaker 5:  And yet it's still risky. I mean, you're right. Totally. And you're also

286
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:51,005
Speaker 5:  like, it's 'cause it looked, because like yes, we, I think we could very

287
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,885
Speaker 5:  well have assumed that Tesla was just gonna go full tilt and you know,

288
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:58,205
Speaker 5:  a thousand driverless vehicles on the road. They did not do that. Right?

289
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,325
Speaker 5:  It's a small group. It's like, I

290
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:02,165
Speaker 1:  Honestly thought at some point they would just turn it on for every Tesla

291
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,085
Speaker 1:  that exists and then the government would be like, what? And Elon Musk would

292
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:06,245
Speaker 1:  be like, whatcha gonna do about it?

293
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,445
Speaker 5:  That's honestly what

294
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:07,885
Speaker 1:  I knows

295
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:11,805
Speaker 5:  Gonna happen. Did I do that? Yeah. Right. But no, it, it does, it does

296
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:15,965
Speaker 5:  outwardly it looks cautious and they, And I don't want to

297
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:19,885
Speaker 5:  detract from that And I, I do wanna give the company some credit for, for,

298
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:23,605
Speaker 5:  for exhibiting some a modicum amount of caution.

299
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:27,685
Speaker 5:  Sure. That said, it is still lacking in some

300
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:31,445
Speaker 5:  serious safety safeguards that, that I think we've seen a lot of other

301
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:35,245
Speaker 5:  companies do. Waymo, for example, will drive six months with safety drivers

302
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:38,925
Speaker 5:  behind the wheel co wheel, no passengers. Then they'll allow passengers in,

303
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:42,765
Speaker 5:  then they'll take safety drivers out and it'll be for invite only for

304
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:46,565
Speaker 5:  employees only. And they'll test it that way for another six months.

305
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:50,205
Speaker 5:  There's a, there's a, there's a process here that they go through. They don't

306
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:53,405
Speaker 5:  drive on highways, they don't go to airports. Tesla also no highways, no

307
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:57,285
Speaker 5:  airports at the moment, but they decided to go out there and

308
00:19:57,285 --> 00:20:01,165
Speaker 5:  start inviting customers with safety monitors in the passenger seat.

309
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:05,005
Speaker 5:  They didn't go through this sort of process of testing for over

310
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:08,965
Speaker 5:  a year, which is what they do because they, their argument is we have 3

311
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:12,885
Speaker 5:  billion miles of customer driven data on full self-driving. We

312
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:17,005
Speaker 5:  have end-to-end neural nets that are powering these

313
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:21,005
Speaker 5:  vehicles. We have everything that we need. And yet they haven't sort of been

314
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:24,525
Speaker 5:  transparent about how they're testing the vehicles. They're not releasing

315
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,485
Speaker 5:  the statistics that we're seeing. They don't have these additional sensors

316
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,805
Speaker 5:  that other companies use because Musk has long argued that they're too expensive

317
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:33,405
Speaker 5:  and it just doesn't make sense. Even though the costs on those sensors have

318
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:37,285
Speaker 5:  been, has been dropping at pretty steeply over the years. So totally. Again,

319
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:41,205
Speaker 5:  you have to give them some credit, but not entirely too much credit

320
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:44,925
Speaker 5:  because there are still a lot of risks that the company is taking here.

321
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:48,925
Speaker 5:  And as we've seen in the past with full self-driving, when things go wrong,

322
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:52,485
Speaker 5:  Tesla's defenders will come out and say, oh, this, this and this, and this

323
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:56,285
Speaker 5:  is why this happened. You know, they'll make any excuse that they can as

324
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:59,725
Speaker 5:  to why mistakes have happened. We saw it yesterday when this car drove on

325
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,485
Speaker 5:  the wrong side of the road. You saw a lot of people rush into the comments

326
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:06,365
Speaker 5:  and say, oh, my own car on full self-driving will do that. Sometimes it's

327
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,685
Speaker 5:  so annoying. That's a big problem. It shouldn't

328
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:09,725
Speaker 1:  Do that, that

329
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,805
Speaker 5:  Your car should not just decide to drive on the wrong side of the road, you

330
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,725
Speaker 5:  know? And So I know I I wanna give them some credit, but I I don't

331
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:18,685
Speaker 5:  wanna give them too much credit.

332
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,845
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I mean, to be, to be very clear, I think for a long time there are

333
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:25,765
Speaker 1:  going to be better ways to get to the fried chicken restaurant than getting

334
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:29,605
Speaker 1:  in a Tesla robax. You know what I mean? But, So I think it just

335
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:33,645
Speaker 1:  let, let's sort of zoom out a little bit because I think the way I have been

336
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:37,045
Speaker 1:  thinking about the Robax world for a while is that there is,

337
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:40,685
Speaker 1:  there is Waymo kind of in a, in a tear of its own and then there's sort of

338
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:44,565
Speaker 1:  everybody else. But Tesla was this wild card that was like,

339
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:48,765
Speaker 1:  who knows what it's gonna do, who knows how well it's gonna work. Like we

340
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,245
Speaker 1:  just don't know. And we're, we're still, like you said, very early in this,

341
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:54,765
Speaker 1:  but it does seem like we can at least slot Tesla

342
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:59,125
Speaker 1:  in somewhere in terms of where the company thinks it is in self-driving.

343
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:00,085
Speaker 1:  Is it still

344
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,725
Speaker 1:  Waymo and then everybody else?

345
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:06,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I I think in a lot of ways, And I think you also have to talk about

346
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:10,285
Speaker 5:  Uber in some respects too, because Uber has sort of made this move now to

347
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:14,165
Speaker 5:  partner with, you know, dozens of, of self-driving car companies

348
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:18,685
Speaker 5:  in, in North America, but also in Europe and, and in Asia and they're sort

349
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:22,245
Speaker 5:  of tried to become kind of like the platform for any company to come and,

350
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:24,245
Speaker 5:  and deploy vehicles on, which

351
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:27,925
Speaker 1:  Seems smart, right? Like the, the yeah, doing the Uber thing strikes me as

352
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:31,405
Speaker 1:  a much safer bet than trying to do the Tesla thing where it's like we're,

353
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:34,005
Speaker 1:  we're gonna try to own everything, but that requires doing everything at

354
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:37,565
Speaker 1:  giant impossible scale. Yeah. Uber is just like, whoever wins we win, which

355
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,245
Speaker 1:  actually at this moment strikes me as a pretty good call.

356
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:43,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think it is, it is pretty smart. They're working with Waymo, they're

357
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:47,125
Speaker 5:  working with a number of other pretty legit operators. So I

358
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:50,765
Speaker 5:  I do think that there is, and they're also doing it on the, on the delivery

359
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:53,645
Speaker 5:  side, on the Uber Eats side as well, right? With, with the sidewalk robots.

360
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,325
Speaker 5:  So that's a really interesting approach to it. But yes, I, I do think that,

361
00:22:57,325 --> 00:23:00,805
Speaker 5:  like you do have to say that Tesla is part of the conversation. They are

362
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:04,485
Speaker 5:  operating driverless vehicles on the road in a commercial capacity and they

363
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:08,205
Speaker 5:  have said, you know, Musk has said 10 20 vehicles at launch,

364
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:11,725
Speaker 5:  perhaps a thousand vehicles within a few months, and then we're gonna be

365
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:15,685
Speaker 5:  in California, he wants to start operating in Los Angeles, he wants to do

366
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,605
Speaker 5:  it in San Francisco. These are Waymo markets as well. And I think

367
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:22,565
Speaker 5:  that that's a fascinating thing. And then obviously they've said that in

368
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:26,125
Speaker 5:  2026 they're gonna start production on the cyber cab and then we're, we will

369
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,965
Speaker 5:  eventually start, you know, then the ball will really be rolling and, and

370
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:32,205
Speaker 5:  there'll be no turning back at, at that point. Sure. But I, I do think that,

371
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:36,245
Speaker 5:  you know, it will entirely depend on which markets that Tesla

372
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:39,805
Speaker 5:  has operated in and what sort of obstacles they may come across Texas. Zero

373
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:43,165
Speaker 5:  obstacles, right? There's just no, all you have to do is basically show proof

374
00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:47,005
Speaker 5:  of insurance and you can do whatever you want. Yeah. And obviously you're

375
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,765
Speaker 5:  dealing with an extremely musk and Tesla friendly government that

376
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:54,725
Speaker 5:  exists in that state that said they had just passed some regulation that

377
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:58,045
Speaker 5:  says that you need to apply for a permit, perhaps Tesla, you'd like to wait

378
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:01,365
Speaker 5:  until September 1st when these regulations kick in and then apply for a permit.

379
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:05,005
Speaker 5:  That's what a lot of lawmakers in Austin were trying to pressure the company

380
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:08,445
Speaker 5:  into doing. Didn't happen. Tesla just went ahead and, and did the thing anyways.

381
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:12,525
Speaker 5:  California, entirely different situation. There's in a, a very rigid

382
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:15,845
Speaker 5:  permitting process, you need to do, have several months of testing. You need

383
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:19,685
Speaker 5:  to submit, you know, documents to the government to show that their, your

384
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:23,485
Speaker 5:  technology is up to snuff. You know, you have to apply for a driverless

385
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:26,005
Speaker 5:  permit, you have to apply for a commercial roboto taxi permit. You know,

386
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:29,045
Speaker 5:  there's all these sort of a successive number of permits, but that's the

387
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:32,285
Speaker 5:  market, right? California is the big market that, that Tesla wants to get.

388
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,285
Speaker 5:  If they want to compete with the Ubers and the Waymo's and everyone else,

389
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:38,765
Speaker 5:  they're gonna need to be in those markets competing with them as well.

390
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:42,965
Speaker 5:  And I, they, they may run into some problems as the sort of regulatory

391
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:46,645
Speaker 5:  requirements get more and more difficult as they look to spread out.

392
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:50,685
Speaker 1:  Right. Is is the sense in the industry that this stuff is gonna be

393
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:55,085
Speaker 1:  kind of a, a let a thousand flowers bloom market where it'll be sort of like

394
00:24:55,085 --> 00:24:57,085
Speaker 1:  the car market where there's lots of different companies and you can choose

395
00:24:57,085 --> 00:25:00,885
Speaker 1:  your, your own provider and everybody can kind of peacefully coexist on the

396
00:25:00,885 --> 00:25:04,245
Speaker 1:  roads? Or are we running towards some kind of like

397
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:08,645
Speaker 1:  winner take all, or at least winner take most version of

398
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:12,805
Speaker 1:  the, the robo taxii future here? Because if that's where we're going, I

399
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:16,045
Speaker 1:  kind of have a hard time figuring out how anybody catches Waymo at this point,

400
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:20,165
Speaker 1:  at least quickly. But maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe maybe

401
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:24,165
Speaker 1:  Waymo can continue to be Waymo and Tesla or some other company can figure

402
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:27,925
Speaker 1:  out how to be just as successful in just as many places and everybody can

403
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:31,125
Speaker 1:  coexist together. What is the sense of how it shakes out there?

404
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:35,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think it's gonna be entirely dependent on safety.

405
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:39,245
Speaker 5:  Okay. I I, I don't wanna mean to sound like a broken record, but really it,

406
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:43,205
Speaker 5:  it it's the kind of situation where as soon as something bad

407
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:46,845
Speaker 5:  happens, someone gets hit, a crash occurs, the whole

408
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,725
Speaker 5:  industry almost needs to reset at that point. And that's when you start to

409
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:53,125
Speaker 5:  see who's a winner and who's a loser in that situation. Because as we've

410
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:57,005
Speaker 5:  seen in the past when there's some sort of injury or death that

411
00:25:57,005 --> 00:26:00,165
Speaker 5:  that can ruin companies, it happened to Uber, it happened to cruise

412
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:04,565
Speaker 5:  under, under GM's ownership and it could very well

413
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:08,445
Speaker 5:  happen to Tesla, right? Sure. As soon as there have been already injuries

414
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:10,965
Speaker 5:  and crashes, right. But there have been people behind the wheels of those

415
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:14,765
Speaker 5:  vehicles and so Tesla can say, we're not liable. We told you to pay attention

416
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:18,285
Speaker 5:  and you didn't. This is a different situation and Tesla is taking on a lot

417
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,605
Speaker 5:  more risk now than they ever have in the past and a lot more liability.

418
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:26,005
Speaker 5:  That said, I do think Uber's model is really interesting and could be the

419
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:29,925
Speaker 5:  one that we see as the most successful. You get you

420
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:33,725
Speaker 5:  sort of like smaller AV operators, maybe

421
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:37,605
Speaker 5:  more locally based, you know, who are able to deploy their vehicles to a

422
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:41,405
Speaker 5:  small number of, of customers on Uber's platform. And then you have sort

423
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:44,565
Speaker 5:  of like your big operators like your Waymo's and others who

424
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:49,045
Speaker 5:  have more runway, more capital, more financial support and

425
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:52,445
Speaker 5:  therefore are able to grow, acquire more VE vehicles

426
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:57,165
Speaker 5:  and then sort of spread across the country. But, you know, it, it

427
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:00,245
Speaker 5:  will be a very safety guided, I think

428
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:03,965
Speaker 5:  development and it and it should be, right? Yeah. If you can't prove

429
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:07,925
Speaker 5:  that you can operate these vehicles And I think the liability thing is the

430
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,565
Speaker 5:  one that is the biggest hurdle for most of these companies. If you cannot

431
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:13,885
Speaker 5:  put a driverless vehicle on the road and be confident in the fact that that's

432
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:16,725
Speaker 5:  not gonna come back and bite you in the ass and cost you hundreds of millions

433
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:20,245
Speaker 5:  of dollars it liability costs, then you, you should

434
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:23,365
Speaker 5:  feel confident in doing that. But otherwise that's gonna be the thing that

435
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:26,765
Speaker 5:  I think that weeds out sort of the, the major players with the, with the

436
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:29,845
Speaker 5:  confidence and, and those that maybe are a little bit operating with a little

437
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:30,365
Speaker 5:  bit more risk.

438
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:33,045
Speaker 1:  Okay, but you think, I mean it's an interesting way of thinking about it

439
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:36,805
Speaker 1:  'cause there's so much potential for like

440
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:40,605
Speaker 1:  problem and change there that maybe I'm wrong to think that Waymo is in

441
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:44,085
Speaker 1:  any way sort of insurmountable at this point. Like there are still so much

442
00:27:44,505 --> 00:27:44,725
Speaker 1:  Yes.

443
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:45,125
Speaker 5:  Big

444
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,005
Speaker 1:  Huge, massive stuff left to do.

445
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:51,285
Speaker 5:  I mean, Waymo has been able to circumnavigate the

446
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:54,685
Speaker 5:  problems in the past with when, when someone has deployed a vehicle that

447
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:58,645
Speaker 5:  was not ready and someone got hurt or injured, there's been sort of the

448
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,125
Speaker 5:  under, there's an understanding that like that hurts the whole industry,

449
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,885
Speaker 5:  right? People don't tend to separate Waymo from, from Tesla

450
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:06,125
Speaker 5:  or, or what have you. They just,

451
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,005
Speaker 1:  They're just self-driving cars.

452
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:10,405
Speaker 5:  They're just self-driving cars and it's a technology that is not ready for

453
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:13,845
Speaker 5:  prime time because of this, this incident that happened. I feel like Waymo

454
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,645
Speaker 5:  has been able to skirt around that a a few times in ways that other companies

455
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:21,525
Speaker 5:  have not. But that said, you know, I, I do think that if something

456
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:24,885
Speaker 5:  happens in the future and if it's a Tesla vehicle that is responsible for

457
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:28,045
Speaker 5:  something that happens, some sort of incident, it'll, it will be tough because

458
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:31,605
Speaker 5:  it is also a perception game. And if you can't convince

459
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:35,605
Speaker 5:  people at scale to trust this technology, they're

460
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:39,485
Speaker 5:  just not gonna use it. They're gonna rely on human driven, you know, Uber

461
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:43,445
Speaker 5:  vehicles, which is why Uber hedging its bets now saying, oh we got,

462
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:46,805
Speaker 5:  we got human drivers and we got robot cars. You know, that's a way to sort

463
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:50,205
Speaker 5:  of say both can coexist and that's a company that could potentially be well

464
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:54,285
Speaker 5:  positioned for more success in the future. But yeah, I

465
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:58,405
Speaker 5:  I do think that like if it once and, and something will, something will go

466
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,205
Speaker 5:  wrong. I, I don't want to be doom and gloom, but there will be eventually

467
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:04,605
Speaker 5:  an incident that happens, someone will get injured, especially as more of

468
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:08,485
Speaker 5:  these vehicles hit the road and you just reach a certain level of scale where

469
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:11,965
Speaker 5:  it's unavoidable, these types of incidents. Sure. It'll be really interesting

470
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:15,205
Speaker 5:  to see who's responsible and how the rest of the industry responds to that

471
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:19,365
Speaker 5:  incident. And then if the public decides to reject it and say,

472
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:23,205
Speaker 5:  okay, this, that's enough. We've had enough of this, which we saw in

473
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:26,685
Speaker 5:  LA recently with these Waymo's getting completely incinerated during these,

474
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:30,565
Speaker 5:  these anti-ice protests, you know, that's a bad look for

475
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:33,445
Speaker 5:  Waymo. It's a bad look for the, for the whole industry too. And I think it's,

476
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:37,005
Speaker 5:  it's, it goes to show that there's still a bit of a hill to climb in terms

477
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:38,965
Speaker 5:  of public acceptance and trust.

478
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:42,485
Speaker 1:  Totally. Well, speaking of things that have fully climbed that hill, at least

479
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:45,365
Speaker 1:  in my brain, can we talk about the Nissan Leaf just for one second before

480
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:46,925
Speaker 5:  We go? Oh yes. Oh well happy to.

481
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,085
Speaker 1:  The last time you were on, I told you I was irrationally excited about this

482
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:53,845
Speaker 1:  car and then Nissan sort of fully unveiled

483
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:58,125
Speaker 1:  the, the 2026 leaf And I feel so incredibly vindicated

484
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:02,725
Speaker 1:  'cause this car seems awesome. It's great. I'm very into it. Tell

485
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:06,125
Speaker 1:  me, tell me why I should or should not be excited about the, the New Leaf.

486
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:10,365
Speaker 5:  Okay, so you should be excited for it because the specs look great. It's

487
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:14,245
Speaker 5:  like over 300 miles on certain trims. They haven't said what the price

488
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:18,125
Speaker 5:  is, but I'm sure it's gonna be like in the $40,000 range, which is

489
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:22,085
Speaker 5:  where most EVs are these days. I if it's under 40, I I will

490
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:25,845
Speaker 5:  be impressed. But I I'm sure if that's gonna be reliant on some

491
00:30:25,845 --> 00:30:28,805
Speaker 5:  incentives that probably won't exist by the time this, this car comes out

492
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:32,485
Speaker 5:  fair. It's got dual ports on it for both CCS charging,

493
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:35,725
Speaker 5:  fast charging and Tesla Max fast charging.

494
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:40,605
Speaker 5:  I have not seen that before in a, in a production vehicle. Typically

495
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,605
Speaker 5:  you'll, you'll, they'll come out with one or the other and they'll give you

496
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:47,445
Speaker 5:  an adapter for the rest. This 1D Son's just saying, why not just put

497
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,685
Speaker 5:  two ports on this, on this bad boy Love it. So that, that's pretty sick.

498
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:55,045
Speaker 5:  And just the look of it, it's just looks so much better. Right? It's like,

499
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:58,405
Speaker 5:  it's kind of reminded me in some ways of like when the new Prius came out

500
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:01,165
Speaker 5:  a couple years ago Totally. And how much a glow up that was, it just like

501
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:05,125
Speaker 5:  looked sleeker and sexier than the, than the old Prius.

502
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:08,925
Speaker 5:  The same is is with the leap. It just, it it's sort of like cast off its

503
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:12,885
Speaker 5:  frumpiness and it's now a fully grown up crossover. SUV it, it

504
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:16,405
Speaker 5:  just, it just looked great. The downside, it's Nissan, right?

505
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:20,525
Speaker 5:  Nissan not in a, not in a great place right now. Yeah. Struggling

506
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,725
Speaker 5:  a lot. They had a huge round of layoffs a few months ago. Tried to

507
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:28,445
Speaker 5:  merge with Honda, didn't work out, had to, had to break that up.

508
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:32,285
Speaker 5:  But clear that the company is still going through a lot of financial

509
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:35,605
Speaker 5:  difficulties. I don't think that's gonna affect the Leaf at all. I think

510
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:39,445
Speaker 5:  that they're really gung-ho about the leaf and, and are, And I, I

511
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:42,405
Speaker 5:  don't doubt that Nissan, it's not gonna be like a Fisker situation. Nissan's

512
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:46,125
Speaker 5:  not gonna cease to exist or what have you. But I do think that that, that

513
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,885
Speaker 5:  might give some folks pause, but yeah, otherwise I, I do think that the Leaf

514
00:31:48,935 --> 00:31:51,205
Speaker 5:  looks awesome And I can't wait to test that out.

515
00:31:51,515 --> 00:31:55,405
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It just seems like we're we're still so desperate

516
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:59,365
Speaker 1:  for like compelling mainstream EVs And I think

517
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:03,765
Speaker 1:  the, the Leaf tried and failed to be that so many times that

518
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:07,205
Speaker 1:  it was like, it just, it just kept whiffing on like really basic stuff. It

519
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:10,245
Speaker 1:  was like, what if we made a car that was ugly and didn't go very far? And

520
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:13,205
Speaker 1:  I was like, well I don't think that's it Nissan,

521
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,965
Speaker 5:  But it was like, but it was the first, it was the thing, right? Like everyone

522
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:20,405
Speaker 5:  gives Tesla the credit for, you know, inventing the EV market, but it was

523
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,485
Speaker 5:  really Nissan that took the risk, right? Yeah. They were the ones who put

524
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:27,325
Speaker 5:  the, the leaf came out first. That was the first, it wasn't long

525
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:31,205
Speaker 5:  range by any stretch of the imagination, but it was way more than a lot

526
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:35,125
Speaker 5:  of like the very early compliance vehicles that we saw. And it was

527
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:39,045
Speaker 5:  cheap. It was so cheap. It was, you know, 112 miles of

528
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:43,005
Speaker 5:  range, like 30 grand, maybe even like 25 grand. That was

529
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:46,485
Speaker 5:  what this was all supposed to be before like the EV market got kind of hooked

530
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:50,205
Speaker 5:  on luxury goods and Right. You know, fine leather goods and all that kind

531
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:52,685
Speaker 5:  of stuff that you see with like the rivian and the pole stars and whatnot.

532
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:56,285
Speaker 5:  Things just got too fancy and we kind of lost, lost sight of like,

533
00:32:56,555 --> 00:33:00,045
Speaker 5:  what was the point of all of this is to, if you really wanna drive adoption,

534
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:03,325
Speaker 5:  you got to meet people where they are and you especially gotta meet them

535
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:07,165
Speaker 5:  where their finances are and, and so many EVs today. And I think

536
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:09,565
Speaker 5:  that, you know, you could say that Tesla was really responsible for that

537
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:13,045
Speaker 5:  with the model S and then that sort of like, kind of was the model that everyone

538
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:16,485
Speaker 5:  wanted to follow because they were so successful. So Right. Had the Leaf

539
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:20,365
Speaker 5:  been the one that was the success and not the model S It

540
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,485
Speaker 5:  could have been a different story. You could have seen Ford and GM and BMW

541
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:27,005
Speaker 5:  and everyone else like rushing to put $20,000 EVs on the road. Hmm.

542
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:31,245
Speaker 5:  But instead it was Tesla that was the breakout star and thus that's why we

543
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:35,125
Speaker 5:  got 70, 80, $90,000 EVs before we got

544
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,205
Speaker 5:  any, any hint of a 20,001.

545
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:41,185
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I am, I'm rooting for this car for exactly that reason. It feels like

546
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:45,345
Speaker 1:  the thing the Leaf has always wanted to be is a, is a thing we

547
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:49,305
Speaker 1:  need in in the car market right now. And at least from the, the look

548
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:52,985
Speaker 1:  of the thing it feels, it feels like it might have actually gotten there,

549
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:56,025
Speaker 1:  but I agree with you. I think price will end up being everything And I would

550
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:59,705
Speaker 1:  not say I'm terribly optimistic given Yeah. You know, gestures broadly,

551
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:00,625
Speaker 1:  all everything.

552
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:03,865
Speaker 5:  But that's it. You know, we're, we're, we're supposed to be getting cheap

553
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,185
Speaker 5:  EVs from Ford, from Volkswagen supposed to be coming out some really cheap

554
00:34:07,215 --> 00:34:10,865
Speaker 5:  ones. Next year we're gonna get the R two from Rivian. That's supposed to

555
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:14,305
Speaker 5:  be their, their $40,000 ev. I, I do feel

556
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:18,385
Speaker 5:  despite all of these headwinds and, and political machinations that are going

557
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:22,305
Speaker 5:  on, it does seem that the industry is still committed to putting out a, a

558
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:26,265
Speaker 5:  affordable EV that people can actually buy and hopefully the leaf will

559
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:29,345
Speaker 5:  will be sort of like that precursor to a lot of great things to come.

560
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:31,785
Speaker 1:  I'm, I'm you and me both.

561
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:40,945
Speaker 1:  the sort of thing that I feel like in the course of my day-to-day life, I

562
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:44,225
Speaker 1:  have spent almost no time thinking about this. This sort of like

563
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:48,265
Speaker 1:  weird world of network usage and

564
00:37:48,545 --> 00:37:51,985
Speaker 1:  carriers and who you buy your service from. I've just, like, I signed up

565
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:55,865
Speaker 1:  for a Verizon account in 2004 and

566
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:58,945
Speaker 1:  basically have not thought about it since then. And then with all this Trump

567
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:02,545
Speaker 1:  mobile stuff, we, we got to like actually sort of have a bunch of

568
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:05,945
Speaker 1:  conversations about how self service works that I have just not really had

569
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:09,225
Speaker 1:  before And I have found myself deeper down this rabbit hole than I ever expected.

570
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:12,265
Speaker 1:  And it, it is sort of fascinating And I feel like you've had kind of the

571
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:14,025
Speaker 1:  same journey over the last like seven days.

572
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:18,505
Speaker 7:  Yeah, and I've, I I go into the rabbit hole sometimes when I am

573
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:22,425
Speaker 7:  writing about, you know, wireless services and Boost Mobile and all that

574
00:38:23,645 --> 00:38:27,425
Speaker 7:  and it goes deep. Like there are some people out there

575
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:31,465
Speaker 7:  who are like so plugged into their network and like

576
00:38:31,535 --> 00:38:35,325
Speaker 7:  what spectrum they're using and what, you know, like all of the

577
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:39,245
Speaker 7:  kind of things that go on under the hood. There's a lot, but I've,

578
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:43,405
Speaker 7:  I have skimmed the surface and it is fascinating stuff

579
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:47,445
Speaker 1:  I think. Yeah, I agree. So let, let's just start at sort of the very base

580
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:50,965
Speaker 1:  floor here and then build up what is an MVNL?

581
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:55,245
Speaker 7:  So an MVNL is a mobile virtual network

582
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:58,765
Speaker 7:  operator and it is basically like

583
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:03,725
Speaker 7:  a storefront for wireless service. They don't

584
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:07,725
Speaker 7:  own the network in the US we have three wireless

585
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:11,245
Speaker 7:  networks. So they buy the service from one of those three

586
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:14,965
Speaker 7:  providers and they resell it and that it's like

587
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:19,005
Speaker 7:  basically as simple as that. So the MVNO is a little bit

588
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:22,445
Speaker 7:  more of like a, a marketing exercise

589
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:26,845
Speaker 7:  and they feel like they can tap into a different

590
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:30,685
Speaker 7:  market that the big providers are not like addressing

591
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:34,925
Speaker 7:  directly is kind of fascinating. I talked to a

592
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:38,885
Speaker 7:  friend analyst, Avi Greengart, and he was like, they've been around

593
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:42,525
Speaker 7:  for decades actually. Like I feel like I've heard about them

594
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:46,565
Speaker 7:  so much in the last, you know, two or three years. But

595
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:50,485
Speaker 7:  as, as long as there's been like an audience to

596
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:54,285
Speaker 7:  address, there's been like an MVNO for that group

597
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:54,645
Speaker 7:  of people.

598
00:39:55,465 --> 00:39:58,965
Speaker 1:  So why would the big three carriers in the US

599
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:02,965
Speaker 1:  at and t T-Mobile Verizon allow this to happen?

600
00:40:03,155 --> 00:40:07,045
Speaker 1:  Like you're, you're basically saying they're, they're

601
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:11,005
Speaker 1:  taking their network, which these companies spend an enormous amount

602
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:14,565
Speaker 1:  of money on like building and maintaining the infrastructure to have wireless

603
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:15,725
Speaker 1:  coverage all over the United

604
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:21,185
Speaker 1:  States and sell it to a sensibly your competitor. Why would these companies

605
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:21,305
Speaker 1:  do that?

606
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:25,905
Speaker 7:  So they get like a guaranteed return on

607
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:29,425
Speaker 7:  that bit of, you know, their capacity and they might have

608
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,985
Speaker 7:  more capacity than they're always using.

609
00:40:33,885 --> 00:40:37,705
Speaker 7:  So it's a little bit of like a guaranteed payday for them when

610
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:41,465
Speaker 7:  they sell it to the MBNO. You know, they make

611
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:45,265
Speaker 7:  their money. The MBNO then has to go like make their money back by

612
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:49,265
Speaker 7:  reselling it. So it, it helps them in that way. And

613
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:53,345
Speaker 7:  there are just market segments that like a Verizon or an

614
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:57,105
Speaker 7:  at and t is maybe too big to go after or

615
00:40:57,315 --> 00:41:01,185
Speaker 7:  wants to uphold a perception of like it's the best

616
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:05,745
Speaker 7:  fanciest wireless network in the world. So there

617
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:09,625
Speaker 7:  are, there are audiences of like people with poor credit

618
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:13,625
Speaker 7:  or people who don't speak English that like Verizon

619
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:18,145
Speaker 7:  is not going to like, hire a whole team to translate

620
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:21,785
Speaker 7:  all their marketing materials into like a particular language.

621
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:26,425
Speaker 7:  So it's, it's beneficial to them in like a number of

622
00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:26,665
Speaker 7:  ways.

623
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:31,025
Speaker 1:  Okay. And my understanding of the the capacity thing is that that

624
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:35,045
Speaker 1:  has gotten more and more possible over

625
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:38,845
Speaker 1:  time. And I think this is where I start to make very clear how little

626
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:42,805
Speaker 1:  I understand how wireless networks actually work. But my, my sense of it

627
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:46,205
Speaker 1:  is that as these networks have gotten faster as we've, you know, gone up

628
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:49,925
Speaker 1:  the gs, they've also gotten more efficient. So like however,

629
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:54,205
Speaker 1:  whatever a hundred million people on Verizon actually use less of this sort

630
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:58,165
Speaker 1:  of overall capacity than before. So maybe even as it's getting better, Verizon

631
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:02,165
Speaker 1:  and at t and and T-Mobile have actually more empty space

632
00:42:02,165 --> 00:42:03,885
Speaker 1:  to offer. Do I have that basically right.

633
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:08,205
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And someone else I spoke to was pointed

634
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:11,445
Speaker 7:  out that 5G really like

635
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:15,525
Speaker 7:  the genuine 5G like we're in the era of

636
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:19,685
Speaker 7:  all the networks have actual 5G networks now they're not trying to

637
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:23,485
Speaker 7:  rebrand 4G as 5G and that technology

638
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:27,045
Speaker 7:  does allow for more capacity. So

639
00:42:27,675 --> 00:42:31,125
Speaker 7:  that might be partially why we're hearing a little bit more

640
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:34,325
Speaker 7:  over the last like year or two in particular,

641
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:38,725
Speaker 7:  especially T-Mobile, which has had kind of the headstart with all the

642
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:42,885
Speaker 7:  sprint spectrum. So they had just like extra

643
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:47,125
Speaker 7:  capacity lying around, you wanna sell it and definitely get some money

644
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:47,685
Speaker 7:  back for it.

645
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:51,965
Speaker 1:  Okay. So when I think of MVNOs, I think the first one

646
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:56,005
Speaker 1:  I think of is Boost Mobile. And I feel like Boost Mobile's been around

647
00:42:56,005 --> 00:42:59,965
Speaker 1:  forever, since like the, the early aughts and has basically

648
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:02,925
Speaker 1:  been on every imaginable network over time. It's been bought and sold like

649
00:43:02,925 --> 00:43:06,045
Speaker 1:  a half dozen times. It, the company has a crazy story but is like

650
00:43:06,505 --> 00:43:08,605
Speaker 1:  pretty successful and has been for a long time,

651
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:13,325
Speaker 1:  mostly without ever operating its own network. I think that's like a little

652
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:17,285
Speaker 1:  murkier now in a 5G world, but it doesn't matter. Mostly it has been an M-M-V-N-O

653
00:43:17,285 --> 00:43:21,245
Speaker 1:  for most people for a very long time. The thing I think of when I think of

654
00:43:21,245 --> 00:43:25,205
Speaker 1:  Boost and by extension most other MVNOs is just

655
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:28,685
Speaker 1:  that it's cheaper, right? Like it is, it is, there are fewer,

656
00:43:28,985 --> 00:43:32,365
Speaker 1:  you know, perks that come with the account. There aren't as many retail stores

657
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:35,165
Speaker 1:  that you go to to get your phone serviced. You're not gonna get maybe as

658
00:43:35,165 --> 00:43:38,485
Speaker 1:  good a deal on a phone, but the price per month is cheaper. And that I feel

659
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:42,325
Speaker 1:  like is pretty consistently the story with MVNOs. Is it usually

660
00:43:42,515 --> 00:43:45,525
Speaker 1:  just kind of that simple? Like you you trade a few things but you get a cheaper

661
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:46,165
Speaker 1:  price every month?

662
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:50,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah, basically. I think that's, and there's a few

663
00:43:50,485 --> 00:43:54,085
Speaker 7:  other things you could be playing in there. Like

664
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:58,285
Speaker 7:  they may not require a credit check and Verizon will,

665
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:01,725
Speaker 7:  you know, needs a credit check for you to get on one of their plans.

666
00:44:02,945 --> 00:44:06,685
Speaker 7:  So they make that a little bit easier. Yeah, they may be

667
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:10,405
Speaker 7:  okay with, you know, lower credit scores too, or, and

668
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:13,885
Speaker 7:  a lot of MVNOs, I don't know if it's exclusively

669
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:17,365
Speaker 7:  all of them, but they tend to be prepaid.

670
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:22,445
Speaker 7:  So you pay for your service and then you have your month of service and Right.

671
00:44:22,545 --> 00:44:26,325
Speaker 7:  The big unlimited plans from all the bigger carriers

672
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:29,605
Speaker 7:  are postpaid and you kind of sign a contract,

673
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:34,245
Speaker 7:  you know, quote unquote you, they can cut your service off if

674
00:44:34,245 --> 00:44:36,005
Speaker 7:  you stop paying them kind of deal.

675
00:44:36,255 --> 00:44:39,445
Speaker 1:  Right? Yeah. So what, what's your sense of the

676
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:43,525
Speaker 1:  downsides of these? Like if you, you get a cheaper price is it

677
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:46,965
Speaker 1:  should like roughly the same service that these things promise, like this

678
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:50,725
Speaker 1:  has always been my open question is like, yes, you are. You,

679
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:54,725
Speaker 1:  you are, I understand taking T-Mobile network capacity and giving it

680
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:58,405
Speaker 1:  to me for less money than T-Mobile. And I'm like, would I trade

681
00:44:58,585 --> 00:45:02,565
Speaker 1:  retail store access for that? Absolutely. Unequivocally yes. Like maybe

682
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:05,605
Speaker 1:  not everybody would, but I happily would. I will fix my own damn phone. Thank

683
00:45:05,605 --> 00:45:09,525
Speaker 1:  you. Yeah. But then there, there's always, I feel like you, you look at the

684
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:13,245
Speaker 1:  fine print and it's always like weird bandwidth priority

685
00:45:13,495 --> 00:45:16,165
Speaker 1:  stuff going on that I've never been able to, I don't know. And it, it's just

686
00:45:16,165 --> 00:45:19,085
Speaker 1:  always like that's the stuff that makes me squirrely is like in ways I don't

687
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:22,605
Speaker 1:  understand is this actually sneakily less good than T-Mobile, even though

688
00:45:22,605 --> 00:45:23,605
Speaker 1:  it's technically T-Mobile?

689
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:28,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I, I think it yes and

690
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:31,925
Speaker 7:  no. Okay. There's deprioritization, which

691
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:35,845
Speaker 7:  is something that, you know, you can buy a plan from Verizon and

692
00:45:35,845 --> 00:45:39,605
Speaker 7:  still experience deprioritization. That's where you have an allotment

693
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:43,685
Speaker 7:  of a certain amount of premium data and once you hit

694
00:45:43,685 --> 00:45:47,485
Speaker 7:  that threshold, it's usually pretty high. And the other thing that comes

695
00:45:47,485 --> 00:45:51,165
Speaker 7:  into play with the MVM knows is that the networks have these

696
00:45:51,355 --> 00:45:54,965
Speaker 7:  kind of quality of service tiers for

697
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:59,045
Speaker 7:  their, the way they split up traffic. So

698
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:02,965
Speaker 7:  they put things that are really like sensitive to

699
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:06,365
Speaker 7:  latency on the highest priority, like

700
00:46:07,295 --> 00:46:11,085
Speaker 7:  voice calls, first responders, that kind of thing. And then

701
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:15,045
Speaker 7:  like down the ranks is, you know, your

702
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:19,325
Speaker 7:  mobile gaming, your internet of things, all that stuff. And I

703
00:46:19,325 --> 00:46:23,125
Speaker 7:  think MVNOs tend to sit like just

704
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:26,925
Speaker 7:  one tier or so below, like the main

705
00:46:27,925 --> 00:46:31,445
Speaker 7:  wireless brand's own traffic. I see, I see. Does that mean

706
00:46:31,585 --> 00:46:35,405
Speaker 7:  you'll experience that difference in, in a meaningful way?

707
00:46:35,555 --> 00:46:39,525
Speaker 7:  Like it's really hard to say. I, I know a

708
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:43,485
Speaker 7:  bunch of people on MVNOs now who are like thrilled

709
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:47,445
Speaker 7:  with their service And I don't think it's ever bothered them

710
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:48,805
Speaker 7:  if that's a factor.

711
00:46:49,435 --> 00:46:53,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I will say the, the one that I have heard about this is Pure

712
00:46:53,235 --> 00:46:56,885
Speaker 1:  anecdotal, but I, I know a surprising number of people who switched to Mint

713
00:46:56,885 --> 00:47:00,845
Speaker 1:  Mobile over the years and had really good experiences and meant mobile's

714
00:47:00,845 --> 00:47:04,765
Speaker 1:  thing was like, it's, it's T-Mobile, but it's 15 bucks a month. And

715
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:06,925
Speaker 1:  also like Ryan Reynolds is here And I think

716
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:07,845
Speaker 7:  Like right,

717
00:47:08,115 --> 00:47:11,045
Speaker 1:  That was very meaningful for people. But also the idea that you are getting,

718
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:15,765
Speaker 1:  I think even, even 90% as good T-Mobile's coverage

719
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:19,765
Speaker 1:  for $15 a month, I think is a trade most people are perfectly happy

720
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:23,325
Speaker 1:  to make. And I remember a lot of this happening, especially during

721
00:47:23,495 --> 00:47:27,445
Speaker 1:  COVID when people were at home a lot, and you're on wifi a lot And I

722
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:30,245
Speaker 1:  was thinking about this, researching all this stuff. Like the amount of time

723
00:47:30,245 --> 00:47:33,485
Speaker 1:  that I spend off of a wifi network at this point

724
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:35,085
Speaker 1:  is pretty small.

725
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:38,845
Speaker 7:  Can I tell a story real quick? I had my,

726
00:47:39,905 --> 00:47:43,645
Speaker 7:  my Verizon account completely shut down while I was traveling home from

727
00:47:44,345 --> 00:47:48,325
Speaker 7:  ww DC Oh no, it was a whole technical weird

728
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:51,925
Speaker 7:  thing with how I am, I kind of did it to myself, like switching around

729
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,765
Speaker 7:  from EIM to physical sim, we got it sorted out,

730
00:47:56,145 --> 00:48:00,085
Speaker 7:  but I got off the plane And I was like, oh no, I'm dead. Like I have died.

731
00:48:00,605 --> 00:48:04,125
Speaker 7:  I don't have cell service. Like I just live here at the airport now. And

732
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:08,085
Speaker 7:  it was actually like, I was like, no, there's wifi and

733
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,525
Speaker 7:  there was like wifi in the parking garage And I could text on wi, I could

734
00:48:11,525 --> 00:48:15,165
Speaker 7:  call on wifi. I'm like, oh actually, like this is

735
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:19,205
Speaker 7:  fine. Yeah. And I like got my Uber on wifi And

736
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:23,165
Speaker 7:  I survived. But it's a, it's an interesting thing that some of the, so like

737
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:26,925
Speaker 7:  the cable companies also run MVNOs,

738
00:48:26,975 --> 00:48:30,685
Speaker 7:  which is such a weird thing of like, you know,

739
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:34,725
Speaker 7:  you can have Xfinity mobile service and then

740
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:38,325
Speaker 7:  Verizon wants to sell you home internet And I don't know what to make of

741
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:42,245
Speaker 7:  that. But yeah, I think one thing that cable companies are doing is

742
00:48:42,245 --> 00:48:45,805
Speaker 7:  like tapping into that that like, hey, you're on wifi a lot.

743
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:49,765
Speaker 7:  Like we'll just kind of facilitate that when you're out and about if

744
00:48:49,765 --> 00:48:53,685
Speaker 7:  there's an Xfinity wifi network, like you can use that and,

745
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:57,405
Speaker 7:  and it saves us on the data that we're paying for.

746
00:48:57,755 --> 00:49:01,005
Speaker 7:  It's a whole like, weird world out there.

747
00:49:01,265 --> 00:49:04,165
Speaker 1:  It it is a strange thing. And I think, I mean that, that goes back to your

748
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:08,125
Speaker 1:  point about this kind of rise in MVNOs over the last few years that I think

749
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:11,885
Speaker 1:  is real. Like, I went back and was like, okay, is this just a thing that

750
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:14,325
Speaker 1:  we've been hearing about recently? And there have been tons of these before.

751
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:18,365
Speaker 1:  The, the answer is no. Like the, there has been a boom the last several years

752
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:22,125
Speaker 1:  in MVNOs and I've been trying to figure out why

753
00:49:22,705 --> 00:49:25,365
Speaker 1:  and, And I have a couple of theories, but I'm, I'm curious if you, if you

754
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:28,765
Speaker 1:  have a sort of leading theory about the, the boom in MVNOs recently.

755
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:33,645
Speaker 7:  So I talked to my friend Avi and he made the good point that like Ryan

756
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:37,685
Speaker 7:  Reynolds really did like start a lot of this. Wait,

757
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:40,165
Speaker 1:  Really? I've been making that joke all week. I thought I was just kidding.

758
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:43,645
Speaker 7:  No, I thought it was funny too, but he was like, no. Okay. Ryan Reynolds

759
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:47,365
Speaker 7:  is actually to blame here, but it having

760
00:49:47,435 --> 00:49:51,285
Speaker 7:  like a friendly face to an MVNO and like the branding of

761
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:55,005
Speaker 7:  Mint Mobile is so cute and it's a little fox and it's just kind of like

762
00:49:55,845 --> 00:49:59,485
Speaker 7:  friendly and kind of appealing, I think

763
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,645
Speaker 7:  attracted a lot of people and sort of helped like

764
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:07,765
Speaker 7:  shake off the stigma of, you know, a prepaid service or an

765
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:11,885
Speaker 7:  MVNO as like, oh that's just cheap and

766
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:15,925
Speaker 7:  you know, you, you gotta buy from the main carriers

767
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:19,485
Speaker 7:  if you want actual good service. It's kind of like a Costco effect

768
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:23,765
Speaker 7:  where you're like, oh yeah, actually it's kind of cool to

769
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:26,965
Speaker 7:  shop at Costco and like save a bunch of money on like

770
00:50:27,755 --> 00:50:29,485
Speaker 7:  nice stuff I would've bought somewhere else.

771
00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:33,045
Speaker 1:  But So I, I I think that makes sense. And then I mean, you consider the fact

772
00:50:33,045 --> 00:50:36,165
Speaker 1:  that Ryan Reynolds like didn't start but like bought into an MVNO, made a

773
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:39,805
Speaker 1:  bunch of fun ads and then sold that MVNO Mint to T-Mobile,

774
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:43,285
Speaker 1:  which provided the service for Mint already.

775
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:47,245
Speaker 1:  So it essentially sold T-Mobile back to T-Mobile. Yeah. For

776
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:51,005
Speaker 1:  $1.35 billion bananas. Like

777
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:54,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Genuine congratulations to everybody involved. And I think to

778
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:57,605
Speaker 1:  me what that says is like, okay, there, there was a real understanding at

779
00:50:57,605 --> 00:51:01,125
Speaker 1:  the end of that, that the brand matters a lot, right? That like you can

780
00:51:01,745 --> 00:51:04,885
Speaker 1:  have, and this is what you're talking about, you can have network capacity,

781
00:51:04,885 --> 00:51:08,645
Speaker 1:  you can have whatever, but like people want to deal with a company that

782
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:12,365
Speaker 1:  they like and that that's a really meaningful thing. And So I get that from

783
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:16,245
Speaker 1:  the perspective of like, I get why you would start up an MVNO, like I that

784
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:18,965
Speaker 1:  this is why Trump mobile makes sense to me, right? You're like, okay, any

785
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:22,765
Speaker 1:  sort of affinity based thing, it's pretty easy to start a

786
00:51:22,885 --> 00:51:25,325
Speaker 1:  wireless carrier. It's a thing people pay money for, it's a relationship

787
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:29,285
Speaker 1:  they have. It's like, I get it, I get why the smart list guys did it. It's,

788
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:32,085
Speaker 1:  there's gonna be more and more of this over time. The part of it that I struggle

789
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:35,725
Speaker 1:  with is like, I don't know a lot of people with a ton of like Comcast brand

790
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:39,205
Speaker 1:  affinity. I guess this is where we should disclose that Comcast through NBC

791
00:51:39,205 --> 00:51:42,565
Speaker 1:  Universal Investor and V Media, I don't know a lot of people who are like

792
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:46,285
Speaker 1:  psyched about their relationship with Comcast. And so the idea of like, oh

793
00:51:46,285 --> 00:51:49,925
Speaker 1:  sure, I'll sign up for wireless services just seems tricky. But then I guess

794
00:51:50,905 --> 00:51:54,125
Speaker 1:  the other thing this has made me think a lot about is, And I'm sure you and

795
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:57,165
Speaker 1:  I have heard this speech from many different people, many times that like

796
00:51:57,385 --> 00:52:01,285
Speaker 1:  people want to have fewer accounts and fewer bills and just the

797
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:04,725
Speaker 1:  idea of like, okay, I can take your wireless service away from being another

798
00:52:04,725 --> 00:52:07,885
Speaker 1:  account and another bill and another customer service line and just wrap

799
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:11,605
Speaker 1:  it into this thing you already have. And I think if I'm getting like galaxy

800
00:52:11,605 --> 00:52:14,205
Speaker 1:  brained about it, I think that's the theory for like the bank, right? Which

801
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:16,845
Speaker 1:  is a, a very sticky account that you're probably gonna keep for a very long

802
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:19,005
Speaker 1:  time. It's like you're used to dealing with your bank.

803
00:52:19,355 --> 00:52:22,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think so. And there's, there's a little bit of like,

804
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:27,165
Speaker 7:  we are more used to like dealing with things online

805
00:52:27,465 --> 00:52:31,245
Speaker 7:  And I think like five or so years

806
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:34,645
Speaker 7:  ago if I thought about switching wireless service, I'm like, well I gotta

807
00:52:34,915 --> 00:52:38,845
Speaker 7:  walk into a store And I gotta talk to a T-Mobile person

808
00:52:38,985 --> 00:52:40,645
Speaker 7:  and get a SIM card and do the thing

809
00:52:40,905 --> 00:52:44,485
Speaker 1:  And they're gonna spend an hour trying to convince me not to quit. And yeah,

810
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:46,765
Speaker 1:  that's the thing I hate the most about it is when you call and you're like,

811
00:52:46,805 --> 00:52:48,805
Speaker 1:  I would like to cancel. And they're like, would you like a deal? And you're

812
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:50,565
Speaker 1:  like, I would like to cancel. And they're like, you would you like a better

813
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:52,005
Speaker 1:  deal? And you're like, I would like to cancel,

814
00:52:52,415 --> 00:52:52,965
Speaker 7:  Right? And

815
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:56,725
Speaker 1:  They're like, okay, I can offer you a year of service for 99 cents. Yeah.

816
00:52:56,725 --> 00:53:00,285
Speaker 1:  And I like, just let me go. Yeah, I quit. Please let,

817
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:03,365
Speaker 7:  Let me leave. Where, where were you six months ago with this deal? Yeah,

818
00:53:03,865 --> 00:53:07,685
Speaker 7:  no, So I, I know I am not in a hurry to

819
00:53:07,705 --> 00:53:11,525
Speaker 7:  add more accounts to my life, but I think yeah, it,

820
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:14,805
Speaker 7:  having EIM as an option makes it

821
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:18,955
Speaker 7:  easier And I think a little bit of the,

822
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:23,075
Speaker 7:  of the momentum is there with your, I talked to

823
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:26,605
Speaker 7:  my hairstylist and she switched to Mint mobile and she is

824
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:30,845
Speaker 7:  not a tech person and was a little bit terrified about doing all of

825
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:34,485
Speaker 7:  this, but she's like, yeah, it's, you know, they talk you through it. There's

826
00:53:34,485 --> 00:53:37,925
Speaker 7:  cute little graphical interfaces to help you like

827
00:53:38,145 --> 00:53:41,965
Speaker 7:  switch your plan and you do it. I, I think having

828
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,725
Speaker 7:  those things there for people kind of help

829
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:49,645
Speaker 7:  spread the word of like, oh, this isn't as terrifying as it sounds like

830
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:53,445
Speaker 7:  and you don't actually have to go spend half a day at a wireless

831
00:53:53,445 --> 00:53:55,165
Speaker 7:  carrier retail store, right?

832
00:53:55,545 --> 00:53:58,805
Speaker 1:  My sort of Galaxy brain theory about why this could be a very exciting

833
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:02,565
Speaker 1:  trend and I'm curious if you agree with this theory. I talked a little bit

834
00:54:02,565 --> 00:54:04,765
Speaker 1:  about this with Jake on Friday, but I've been thinking about it ever since

835
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:09,005
Speaker 1:  that what we get now is we get like at and

836
00:54:09,085 --> 00:54:12,365
Speaker 1:  t T-Mobile, Verizon have spent tons of money building

837
00:54:13,035 --> 00:54:16,045
Speaker 1:  very impressive infrastructure all over the United States. This stuff is

838
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:18,565
Speaker 1:  gonna get bigger, they're gonna keep working on this and they're going to

839
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:22,365
Speaker 1:  be increasingly happy to like recoup that investment by selling it to MVNOs,

840
00:54:22,365 --> 00:54:26,005
Speaker 1:  right? So we're gonna get this giant proliferation of ways to

841
00:54:26,995 --> 00:54:30,405
Speaker 1:  get more or less identical wireless service,

842
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:34,485
Speaker 1:  like sort of within a, within a small range of quality, pretty good wireless

843
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:37,925
Speaker 1:  service. What that means now is there are going to be a million

844
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:41,885
Speaker 1:  ways to compete on everything else, right? Like the, the, they're gonna

845
00:54:41,885 --> 00:54:44,725
Speaker 1:  compete on billing, they're gonna compete on like how good the app is for

846
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:47,965
Speaker 1:  managing your account. They're gonna compete on different kinds of features

847
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:50,965
Speaker 1:  and different stuff you can do and different perks that you get or they're

848
00:54:50,965 --> 00:54:53,325
Speaker 1:  just gonna compete on price. And all of a sudden that like we've been on

849
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:57,045
Speaker 1:  this constant rise in the cost of wireless service.

850
00:54:57,045 --> 00:55:00,365
Speaker 1:  Like a thing we talk about on the show all the time is that we get pretty

851
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:03,925
Speaker 1:  bad service for a lot more money than almost anywhere else. And it's largely

852
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,925
Speaker 1:  because there are three companies that matter and nothing else. And

853
00:55:07,755 --> 00:55:11,405
Speaker 1:  it's not the same as having like truly competitive networks

854
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:14,205
Speaker 1:  everywhere, but it's, it's, it's the closest to that that we're gonna get

855
00:55:14,405 --> 00:55:18,085
Speaker 1:  I think. And, and so maybe what we're gonna get is this

856
00:55:18,325 --> 00:55:22,245
Speaker 1:  gigantic boom and like if not the network competition then

857
00:55:22,245 --> 00:55:25,885
Speaker 1:  like interface competition on top of that network. Yeah. And that might be

858
00:55:25,885 --> 00:55:28,565
Speaker 1:  very exciting. So like I've, I've been reading about Disney Mobile a bunch.

859
00:55:28,585 --> 00:55:29,965
Speaker 1:  Do you know about Disney Mobile at all?

860
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:30,645
Speaker 7:  No.

861
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:33,645
Speaker 1:  Disney has an MVNO. No. Amazing really,

862
00:55:34,985 --> 00:55:38,845
Speaker 1:  to be honest with you, I could not confirm whether it still exists. Okay.

863
00:55:39,445 --> 00:55:42,725
Speaker 1:  I don't think it's popular, I'll tell you that. Alright. But it launched

864
00:55:42,745 --> 00:55:45,405
Speaker 1:  in 2006. Like to your point, this stuff has been around for a long time.

865
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:49,085
Speaker 1:  It was originally on the Sprint network and this was the thing that really

866
00:55:49,085 --> 00:55:51,885
Speaker 1:  was, I was like, oh, this is why MVNOs could be awesome. So

867
00:55:52,905 --> 00:55:56,515
Speaker 1:  it was basically, it was a like Disney based

868
00:55:56,925 --> 00:56:00,875
Speaker 1:  experience. They were like, we we wanna do for, for families and kids

869
00:56:01,015 --> 00:56:04,915
Speaker 1:  and parents what we think they would want in a

870
00:56:04,915 --> 00:56:07,715
Speaker 1:  phone service. So here's just a list. I'm reading their press release from

871
00:56:07,715 --> 00:56:11,235
Speaker 1:  2006 and they have a bunch of new features that they were

872
00:56:11,475 --> 00:56:15,395
Speaker 1:  launching. One was set spending allowances and track usage for, for

873
00:56:15,395 --> 00:56:18,115
Speaker 1:  voice minutes and all this stuff back when minutes were a thing. Oh yeah.

874
00:56:18,115 --> 00:56:20,635
Speaker 1:  And you would get alerts when the allowances had been reached so parents

875
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:24,220
Speaker 1:  could be like, you know, you get this many text messages and this many minutes

876
00:56:24,605 --> 00:56:26,965
Speaker 1:  and then it'll, it'll let us know when you get to the end of it. That was

877
00:56:27,405 --> 00:56:30,525
Speaker 1:  a big deal back then back when everyone was paying a ton for minutes over.

878
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:33,645
Speaker 1:  It determine the hours of the day and days of the week when kids can use

879
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:37,165
Speaker 1:  their phone. Good idea. Program restricted and always on phone numbers to

880
00:56:37,165 --> 00:56:40,845
Speaker 1:  manage with whom kids may communicate super smart, prioritize

881
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:44,765
Speaker 1:  important family messages and locate kids' phones with GPS capabilities.

882
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:48,205
Speaker 1:  So they took this thing right and they're like, okay this is sprint service,

883
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:52,685
Speaker 1:  but we can actually like change the features you get with your plan

884
00:56:52,745 --> 00:56:56,165
Speaker 1:  and how you use it and how you access it and how we bill it in a way that

885
00:56:56,165 --> 00:57:00,085
Speaker 1:  makes more sense for this group of people. And that to me

886
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,725
Speaker 1:  is like, I'm like, oh you could, there are an infinite number of versions

887
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:07,605
Speaker 1:  of that thing that you could do And I think that is like

888
00:57:08,065 --> 00:57:11,965
Speaker 1:  way more so than just like one fewer bill. That idea I find super,

889
00:57:11,965 --> 00:57:15,045
Speaker 1:  super, super compelling. Am I just totally piped dreaming here? Like is this

890
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:18,365
Speaker 1:  not where we're headed? Could, could I have this world or am I just insane?

891
00:57:19,045 --> 00:57:22,525
Speaker 7:  I hope you're right And I think like some of that will happen,

892
00:57:22,985 --> 00:57:26,685
Speaker 7:  but the thing that makes me a little pessimistic is that it all starts with

893
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:30,445
Speaker 7:  their relationship with the main three carriers and

894
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:34,405
Speaker 7:  they, I don't know what level they're dictating, like what

895
00:57:34,465 --> 00:57:37,605
Speaker 7:  you can and can't do, you know, with the service

896
00:57:38,745 --> 00:57:42,405
Speaker 7:  it certainly in their interest to make sure that like

897
00:57:42,855 --> 00:57:46,845
Speaker 7:  their offering is the shiniest best, you know, coolest.

898
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:51,765
Speaker 7:  I think it has already happened a little bit with like with

899
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:55,165
Speaker 7:  MIT mobile and T-Mobile buying MIT mobile

900
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,525
Speaker 7:  kind of speaks a lot I think about how

901
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,125
Speaker 7:  that is an important piece of business that they wanna bring

902
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:08,085
Speaker 7:  back in-house. So I, I don't know, I'm just a

903
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:11,885
Speaker 7:  little pessimistic from the like capitalism, doing

904
00:58:11,975 --> 00:58:15,845
Speaker 7:  capitalism kind of side of it. But I hope it would

905
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:19,605
Speaker 7:  be cool if there were like actual better ways to

906
00:58:19,845 --> 00:58:23,485
Speaker 7:  interact with a wireless company. I definitely we're gonna see

907
00:58:23,555 --> 00:58:27,525
Speaker 7:  like I think some of the MVNOs are sort of bundling

908
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:31,605
Speaker 7:  services in that way to kind of like differentiate

909
00:58:32,145 --> 00:58:36,125
Speaker 7:  and the Liberty mobile, which is the network that

910
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:40,365
Speaker 7:  the MVNO that Trump mobile is just kind of glomming onto.

911
00:58:41,155 --> 00:58:44,805
Speaker 7:  They had a whole bunch of thing that was like, it was like telehealth and

912
00:58:44,945 --> 00:58:48,125
Speaker 7:  device protection. It would be cool to see

913
00:58:49,045 --> 00:58:52,885
Speaker 7:  a company do that and do it in a

914
00:58:52,885 --> 00:58:56,645
Speaker 7:  good way that doesn't feel like upselling. You know,

915
00:58:57,605 --> 00:59:00,885
Speaker 7:  I don know why this just pops into my head, but I was like, Headspace should

916
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:04,765
Speaker 7:  do an MVNO. What if Headspace did? Oh that's

917
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:08,205
Speaker 7:  interesting. I don't know like built in soothing

918
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:12,205
Speaker 7:  activities that you could do when you're dealing with

919
00:59:12,205 --> 00:59:13,285
Speaker 7:  your wireless carrier.

920
00:59:13,905 --> 00:59:17,485
Speaker 1:  No. See, okay, here's, here's my idea for Headspace. It

921
00:59:17,485 --> 00:59:20,845
Speaker 1:  Headspace dynamically replaces all hold music with

922
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:24,445
Speaker 1:  meditations. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when you're waiting it just, it just replaces

923
00:59:24,445 --> 00:59:26,925
Speaker 1:  it and it gives you just like a five minute meditation. Yeah. While you're

924
00:59:26,925 --> 00:59:29,925
Speaker 1:  waiting on hold to talk to, you know, your bank or whoever.

925
00:59:29,995 --> 00:59:33,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's like we noticed you're on hold with Walgreens for 30 minutes.

926
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:34,925
Speaker 7:  Would you like, would

927
00:59:34,925 --> 00:59:35,565
Speaker 1:  You like to meditate?

928
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,365
Speaker 7:  Do you wanna hear the sound of whales? Yeah,

929
00:59:38,805 --> 00:59:41,525
Speaker 1:  I do. Thank you. Headspace. I would love to hear whale sounds

930
00:59:41,755 --> 00:59:44,525
Speaker 7:  Free idea. I will sign up for Headspace Mobile.

931
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:48,005
Speaker 1:  Headspace, get at us. You, you can have this, but we do have free service.

932
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:49,005
Speaker 1:  That's how this works.

933
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:53,445
Speaker 1:  One other question on this and, and then I'm gonna let you go. The, the other

934
00:59:53,445 --> 00:59:57,405
Speaker 1:  piece of this to me seems like phone unlocking becomes

935
00:59:57,865 --> 01:00:00,845
Speaker 1:  an important part of the equation here, right? Like E SIMs make it easy to

936
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:04,485
Speaker 1:  switch your phone, but we're still in this kind of nebulous,

937
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:08,605
Speaker 1:  is my phone locked to my carrier world here in the United

938
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:11,485
Speaker 1:  States? Again, I should point out that so much of this is gonna seem like

939
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:14,885
Speaker 1:  esoteric and ridiculous to people anywhere else who have long had better,

940
01:00:14,885 --> 01:00:18,445
Speaker 1:  more competitive mobile phone universes that

941
01:00:18,445 --> 01:00:22,205
Speaker 1:  don't require all of the shenanigans that we're talking about here. Yeah.

942
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:26,045
Speaker 1:  But here in America it does feel like if we can get eims and we can get

943
01:00:26,045 --> 01:00:29,965
Speaker 1:  unlocked phones and we can get big vast carrier choice, we are

944
01:00:29,965 --> 01:00:33,845
Speaker 1:  like somewhere cool and exciting. Are we on a good path

945
01:00:33,845 --> 01:00:34,605
Speaker 1:  to unlocked phones?

946
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:38,965
Speaker 7:  I think we're on a like very slow good path. Okay. There's

947
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,965
Speaker 7:  some legislation I think they were trying to tell the

948
01:00:42,965 --> 01:00:46,885
Speaker 7:  carriers like, you cannot lock someone's phone to a network.

949
01:00:47,155 --> 01:00:51,005
Speaker 7:  Like you have to unlock it after a certain amount is it was like six months,

950
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:51,445
Speaker 7:  I think it was

951
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:52,885
Speaker 1:  60 days was the the thing they were

952
01:00:52,895 --> 01:00:56,885
Speaker 7:  Going for 60 days. Okay, yeah. That's even better whether or not

953
01:00:56,995 --> 01:01:00,885
Speaker 7:  like I've paid off my device to Verizon, that's between me and

954
01:01:00,885 --> 01:01:04,565
Speaker 7:  Verizon. But like they can't just be like, you may only

955
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:08,485
Speaker 7:  use this phone on a network. That's good. That's progress

956
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:12,285
Speaker 7:  I think. But I think there is a little bit of just a habit

957
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:16,285
Speaker 7:  with, especially in the US of like, it's time for a new phone.

958
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:20,285
Speaker 7:  Go to Verizon, right? Or go to their website and, and

959
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:23,845
Speaker 7:  undoing that a little bit. I don't know exactly how that starts,

960
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:28,085
Speaker 7:  but like you can just go to Apple's website and

961
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:31,645
Speaker 7:  you can get a device like payment plan. Yeah.

962
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:35,725
Speaker 7:  It doesn't have to come from the wireless carrier but somehow the,

963
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:39,565
Speaker 7:  the good deal always seems to be tied into like, well

964
01:01:39,705 --> 01:01:43,165
Speaker 7:  you know, if you connect to your Verizon account we'll just help pay for

965
01:01:43,165 --> 01:01:43,885
Speaker 7:  this phone for you.

966
01:01:44,505 --> 01:01:47,845
Speaker 1:  All right, for now, go back to your day off. Thank you for doing this. I

967
01:01:47,845 --> 01:01:50,365
Speaker 1:  appreciate it. We are gonna take a break and then we're gonna come back and

968
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:52,485
Speaker 1:  do a question from the hotline. Thank you Allison.

969
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:53,485
Speaker 7:  Thank you.

970
01:01:53,945 --> 01:01:54,405
Speaker 1:  Be right back.

971
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:26,545
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's go to a question from the first cast hotline

972
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:30,225
Speaker 1:  as always. Number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. The

973
01:04:30,385 --> 01:04:33,545
Speaker 1:  email is vergecast at The Verge dot com. You can hit me up directly like

974
01:04:33,545 --> 01:04:36,425
Speaker 1:  we're not hard to find. If you have questions, get at us. We love hearing

975
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:40,225
Speaker 1:  all of your questions. Today's question is something we've talked about on

976
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:44,105
Speaker 1:  the show before but we get a lot and So I want to just tackle

977
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:47,345
Speaker 1:  it again in as aggressive and straightforward way as we

978
01:04:47,895 --> 01:04:49,145
Speaker 1:  possibly can. It's about storage here. It's

979
01:04:50,645 --> 01:04:53,905
Speaker 10:  Hey Vergecast, this is Anthony from Denver.

980
01:04:55,185 --> 01:04:58,945
Speaker 10:  I have a question about the best way to free up space on

981
01:04:59,335 --> 01:05:03,105
Speaker 10:  iPhones. Last week while my mom was visiting with me,

982
01:05:03,585 --> 01:05:07,505
Speaker 10:  she had shared that she had just bought new iPhone 16

983
01:05:07,645 --> 01:05:11,505
Speaker 10:  but it was already kind of running outta space and was very slow. So

984
01:05:11,505 --> 01:05:14,505
Speaker 10:  she wanted to know what she could do to free up space on her phone and,

985
01:05:14,565 --> 01:05:17,805
Speaker 10:  and hopefully speed it up. And specifically she wanted to know if there's

986
01:05:17,925 --> 01:05:21,605
Speaker 10:  anything that she could do to remove photos from her phone and, and back

987
01:05:21,605 --> 01:05:25,525
Speaker 10:  them up and and store them elsewhere. Now my, my wife And I we're both

988
01:05:25,525 --> 01:05:29,285
Speaker 10:  Pixel users so we were both kind of flabbergasted

989
01:05:30,085 --> 01:05:33,245
Speaker 10:  to learn that Apple doesn't have a photo backup solution.

990
01:05:33,885 --> 01:05:37,725
Speaker 10:  It has iCloud, which is ti far, far as you know, we could tell

991
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:41,685
Speaker 10:  is like a syncing service, but Apple doesn't really have any solution for

992
01:05:41,685 --> 01:05:45,405
Speaker 10:  both backing up photos while also removing them

993
01:05:45,555 --> 01:05:49,365
Speaker 10:  from the device. And so after researching for a few

994
01:05:49,365 --> 01:05:52,565
Speaker 10:  hours the, the solution that we ended up like coming to

995
01:05:53,345 --> 01:05:56,565
Speaker 10:  is you could use a service like Google Photos or Amazon photos

996
01:05:57,685 --> 01:06:01,505
Speaker 10:  or you could try downloading them to a computer and moving them to

997
01:06:01,805 --> 01:06:05,425
Speaker 10:  an external hard drive. My wife And I, we ended up deciding to solve this

998
01:06:05,425 --> 01:06:08,545
Speaker 10:  problem with Google Photos and after about two hours or so of backing up

999
01:06:08,545 --> 01:06:12,105
Speaker 10:  most of the photos and deleting some of them, we ended up saving her about

1000
01:06:12,395 --> 01:06:16,345
Speaker 10:  50 gigabytes of space on our iPhone. But we

1001
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:20,065
Speaker 10:  were both kind of left wondering like how has Apple not made

1002
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:24,345
Speaker 10:  a well designed like photo backup solution?

1003
01:06:24,935 --> 01:06:28,905
Speaker 10:  Like why would anyone want to use 50 gigabytes of

1004
01:06:28,905 --> 01:06:32,665
Speaker 10:  space on their device for photos when they don't

1005
01:06:32,665 --> 01:06:36,545
Speaker 10:  have to, when they probably don't even want those photos to be

1006
01:06:36,545 --> 01:06:40,485
Speaker 10:  on their device at all? And is there really, like is there

1007
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:42,285
Speaker 10:  anything else that iPhone users can do?

1008
01:06:43,025 --> 01:06:46,765
Speaker 1:  You, you can see why they sent me down a rabbit hole of thinking about where

1009
01:06:46,765 --> 01:06:50,645
Speaker 1:  all of my stuff is, right? And I have a few

1010
01:06:50,685 --> 01:06:54,485
Speaker 1:  thoughts for our, our friend here and for everyone who is thinking about

1011
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:57,285
Speaker 1:  this switch as far as I can tell is everyone I think like I'm running out

1012
01:06:57,285 --> 01:07:00,645
Speaker 1:  of storage on my phone is as universal a problem

1013
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:04,925
Speaker 1:  as anybody has on technology, right? Like it's, it's everywhere. So

1014
01:07:05,385 --> 01:07:08,765
Speaker 1:  here's what I would say. If you use an iPhone, this is all going to be Apple

1015
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,365
Speaker 1:  specific because frankly Apple does this in the worst possible way and Google

1016
01:07:12,425 --> 01:07:15,405
Speaker 1:  is at least a lot more straightforward. You just dump stuff into Google Photos

1017
01:07:15,425 --> 01:07:19,285
Speaker 1:  and there it's, the thing that I would say is that a, even if

1018
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:22,965
Speaker 1:  you're on iOS, Google Photos is great and you should use it if you, there's

1019
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:26,325
Speaker 1:  a good chance you have lots of storage over there. That's a thing I pay for

1020
01:07:26,645 --> 01:07:29,565
Speaker 1:  separately anyway just because I wanted the drive storage and the more Gmail

1021
01:07:29,665 --> 01:07:32,845
Speaker 1:  and so like there's a solid chance you're already paying for more

1022
01:07:33,385 --> 01:07:36,925
Speaker 1:  Google storage. So use that, use Google Photos, turn on the auto backup,

1023
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:40,525
Speaker 1:  it'll send everything up there. I think Google Photos is a vastly better

1024
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:43,805
Speaker 1:  photo experience than anything Apple is doing. So that's what I tend to use

1025
01:07:43,805 --> 01:07:47,565
Speaker 1:  anyway. I also will say, And I, And I hate so much

1026
01:07:47,565 --> 01:07:51,045
Speaker 1:  that I'm saying this, Apple's 2 99 a month,

1027
01:07:51,085 --> 01:07:54,405
Speaker 1:  200 gigabyte iCloud deal is a pretty good deal. It

1028
01:07:54,705 --> 01:07:58,125
Speaker 1:  is absurd that you don't get that for free. That that's not the base tier,

1029
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:00,725
Speaker 1:  that Apple, the richest company in the world is going to nickel and dime

1030
01:08:00,725 --> 01:08:04,045
Speaker 1:  you $3 a month just to have like an appropriate amount of storage for your

1031
01:08:03,845 --> 01:08:07,805
Speaker 1:  photos. But it's, it's three bucks a month to largely not

1032
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:11,765
Speaker 1:  have to think about this most of the time and frankly that's worth it.

1033
01:08:13,285 --> 01:08:16,565
Speaker 1:  A couple of other things, the the first thing most people should do is go

1034
01:08:16,565 --> 01:08:19,885
Speaker 1:  to settings on their phone and turn on the

1035
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:23,405
Speaker 1:  optimized storage thing in photos. Lemme just do this right now So I have

1036
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:27,245
Speaker 1:  it right. You go, you go to settings and then you tap

1037
01:08:27,245 --> 01:08:31,205
Speaker 1:  on your name at the very top and then you go to iCloud and then you tap

1038
01:08:31,205 --> 01:08:33,965
Speaker 1:  on photos. So this is telling me I have

1039
01:08:34,105 --> 01:08:37,725
Speaker 1:  10,745 photos and 687 videos

1040
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:41,925
Speaker 1:  taking up 102.29 gigabytes of space. That's a lot.

1041
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:45,085
Speaker 1:  I suspect there are a lot of you who have much more than that and you wanna

1042
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:48,965
Speaker 1:  turn on the thing that says optimize iPhone storage. So basically

1043
01:08:48,965 --> 01:08:52,565
Speaker 1:  what that does is instead of leaving the whole kind of

1044
01:08:52,565 --> 01:08:56,525
Speaker 1:  increasingly large file with every new rev of Apple's camera system

1045
01:08:56,985 --> 01:09:00,685
Speaker 1:  on your device, it keeps all of it in iCloud and downloads a smaller

1046
01:09:00,825 --> 01:09:04,325
Speaker 1:  one to your device. What I have found is this is just

1047
01:09:04,675 --> 01:09:08,525
Speaker 1:  rubbish at actually working. Sometimes it loads things way too

1048
01:09:08,525 --> 01:09:11,405
Speaker 1:  slowly. Some it seems to leave things on your device for too long. It is

1049
01:09:11,405 --> 01:09:15,365
Speaker 1:  not actually optimizing space nearly as successfully

1050
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:18,445
Speaker 1:  as it ought to. Again this is where Google photos does it much better. It

1051
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,445
Speaker 1:  just leaves all this stuff in the cloud and then you tap it and it pulls

1052
01:09:20,445 --> 01:09:24,245
Speaker 1:  it down when you need it. Like much better system but that

1053
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:28,045
Speaker 1:  should at least save you a little bit of space. There is also

1054
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:32,405
Speaker 1:  a bunch of tools in here for just deleting things, which I think is

1055
01:09:32,795 --> 01:09:36,485
Speaker 1:  what I would tell most people to do. So again, you go, you go into settings

1056
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:40,685
Speaker 1:  and you go to your face and you go to iCloud and you go to photos and

1057
01:09:40,685 --> 01:09:44,565
Speaker 1:  then you hit manage storage and it loads this thing for you that

1058
01:09:44,675 --> 01:09:48,645
Speaker 1:  basically then gives you actual information about

1059
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:52,845
Speaker 1:  all of this stuff on your phone, right? It, it takes a long time

1060
01:09:53,145 --> 01:09:56,525
Speaker 1:  in my case because it has to look through 10,000 things but it pops up a

1061
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:59,125
Speaker 1:  thing that says review your photos and videos. Mine is telling me I can get

1062
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:03,005
Speaker 1:  50 gigabytes of space back by deleting duplicates, screenshots and videos.

1063
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:07,005
Speaker 1:  In my case almost all of that is videos. And the thing I

1064
01:10:07,005 --> 01:10:10,845
Speaker 1:  like about this is there's this one screen all the way deep down here

1065
01:10:10,845 --> 01:10:14,725
Speaker 1:  in settings that will actually show you in order your largest

1066
01:10:14,725 --> 01:10:18,605
Speaker 1:  videos. And I would bet, and I have confirmed this both on my phone and

1067
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:21,885
Speaker 1:  on some others just as sort of basic, you know, research purposes

1068
01:10:22,395 --> 01:10:26,125
Speaker 1:  that almost everybody has a few like sneakily humongous

1069
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:30,245
Speaker 1:  videos on your device. You accidentally took a seven minute long

1070
01:10:30,245 --> 01:10:34,005
Speaker 1:  video in your pocket without noticing it. You have one that's like six minutes

1071
01:10:34,145 --> 01:10:37,685
Speaker 1:  of ProRes that is taking up half the storage on your phone. Like there's

1072
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:41,445
Speaker 1:  just a bunch of little things here. So for me, like if I delete the nine

1073
01:10:41,595 --> 01:10:45,125
Speaker 1:  biggest videos on my phone, I'm looking at eight

1074
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:49,085
Speaker 1:  gigabytes worth of space just to free up like that. So that's

1075
01:10:49,085 --> 01:10:51,685
Speaker 1:  one thing to do. You can delete all your screenshots, you can delete all

1076
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:55,085
Speaker 1:  of your complicated overly

1077
01:10:55,475 --> 01:10:58,685
Speaker 1:  done edited photos. You can delete your duplicates, you can delete all the

1078
01:10:58,685 --> 01:11:02,445
Speaker 1:  stuff that you don't need and it's much easier to do here in settings than

1079
01:11:02,445 --> 01:11:05,885
Speaker 1:  it is almost anywhere else on your phone. So delete the stuff,

1080
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:10,285
Speaker 1:  put it in iCloud. And then the thing that I would do if

1081
01:11:10,285 --> 01:11:13,565
Speaker 1:  you like really want to invest in this is go to the iCloud photos

1082
01:11:13,955 --> 01:11:17,765
Speaker 1:  website, which is a better way to like mass move

1083
01:11:17,765 --> 01:11:21,405
Speaker 1:  stuff around, open it up, make the use the little

1084
01:11:21,405 --> 01:11:25,045
Speaker 1:  slider at the top to make the photos as small as possible. Scroll all the

1085
01:11:25,045 --> 01:11:28,645
Speaker 1:  way to the top to the very first photos you took, which o

1086
01:11:28,645 --> 01:11:32,405
Speaker 1:  overwhelmingly I suspect are ones you might wanna keep but don't need like

1087
01:11:32,405 --> 01:11:35,925
Speaker 1:  ready access to download all those photos and put them somewhere else,

1088
01:11:36,355 --> 01:11:40,205
Speaker 1:  like delete some of them, download some of them it, it is easy

1089
01:11:40,305 --> 01:11:44,245
Speaker 1:  and quick to do from a web browser in a way that on your phone or an iPad

1090
01:11:44,245 --> 01:11:47,525
Speaker 1:  or even in the Photos app on a Mac is just kind of messy. This is like a

1091
01:11:47,525 --> 01:11:51,165
Speaker 1:  good mass tool for just getting

1092
01:11:51,165 --> 01:11:55,125
Speaker 1:  everything out. And what I'm trying to do in this go round is basically

1093
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:58,765
Speaker 1:  only keep the last couple of years of photos actually in my iCloud. Everything

1094
01:11:58,765 --> 01:12:02,645
Speaker 1:  else goes into this like permanent storage of some kind. And

1095
01:12:02,645 --> 01:12:06,325
Speaker 1:  so the idea is that I have a place to get those and someday when I want to

1096
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:09,525
Speaker 1:  go look at them, I will know where they are but they're not sitting in the

1097
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:12,805
Speaker 1:  cloud storage accessible to me all the time and taking up space because they

1098
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:16,485
Speaker 1:  don't need to be And I don't need them all the time. So those are all my

1099
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:19,525
Speaker 1:  recommendations. You probably have lots of storage space also by the way

1100
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:23,325
Speaker 1:  in places like Amazon and Microsoft and everybody I think has like a

1101
01:12:23,325 --> 01:12:27,205
Speaker 1:  Dropbox account lingering that they're not using. There are places you can

1102
01:12:27,205 --> 01:12:30,885
Speaker 1:  put things other than iCloud And I would encourage you for almost everything

1103
01:12:30,885 --> 01:12:34,205
Speaker 1:  that isn't something you think you're gonna like actively need and use,

1104
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:38,445
Speaker 1:  put it somewhere else because Apple does not do a good job of managing your

1105
01:12:38,445 --> 01:12:42,325
Speaker 1:  storage and desperately wants you to overpay for it. So just don't play

1106
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:46,005
Speaker 1:  Apple's games, delete all your biggest stuff, put it all

1107
01:12:46,005 --> 01:12:49,725
Speaker 1:  somewhere else. And I think life will be okay. And in theory, this is a thing

1108
01:12:49,725 --> 01:12:53,685
Speaker 1:  you should do, I don't know, once a year that'll take you 20 minutes. It's

1109
01:12:53,685 --> 01:12:57,445
Speaker 1:  like not a hard project, but it is a thing you shouldn't have to do. That

1110
01:12:57,445 --> 01:13:00,485
Speaker 1:  is not to excuse Apple. It's annoying that this is the case, but that's what

1111
01:13:00,485 --> 01:13:04,205
Speaker 1:  I do. So I hope any of that helps. And if you have a better tip

1112
01:13:04,325 --> 01:13:07,085
Speaker 1:  for how to manage all of this stuff so that you don't have to go in at the

1113
01:13:07,085 --> 01:13:09,925
Speaker 1:  last minute, every once in a while and just mass delete a bunch of stuff,

1114
01:13:10,565 --> 01:13:14,525
Speaker 1:  I would love to hear it. Tell me all of your tips. Alright, that is

1115
01:13:14,525 --> 01:13:17,325
Speaker 1:  it for the show today. Thank you to everybody who's on the show with me.
