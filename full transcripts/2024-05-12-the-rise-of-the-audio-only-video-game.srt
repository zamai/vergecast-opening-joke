Description: In episode two of our Five Senses of Gaming miniseries, David Pierce dives into the world of hearing with audio-only video games with Paul Bennun, who has been in this space longer than most. Years ago, Bennun and his team at Somethin’ Else made a series of games called Papa Sangre that were among the most innovative and most popular games of their kind. He explains what makes an audio game work, why the iPhone 4 was such a crucial technological achievement for these games, and more.

00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:05,165
Speaker 3:  episode. This week's sense is hearing sound and I

3
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,205
Speaker 3:  wanna start by telling you about a game I've been playing a lot over the

4
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:10,285
Speaker 3:  last few weeks. It's called Blind Drive

5
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:11,765
Speaker 4:  Start driving.

6
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:15,125
Speaker 4:  What the hell wait.

7
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:23,965
Speaker 3:  Here's the story of Blind Drive, which is available for lots of platforms,

8
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:27,245
Speaker 3:  but I've been playing it on my phone. You're the main character. You thought

9
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:30,925
Speaker 3:  you were taking part in a scientific study, but suddenly you find yourself

10
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,845
Speaker 3:  driving a car against traffic with a blindfold on. You

11
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,645
Speaker 3:  can't see anything. The only way to survive is by hearing the cars,

12
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:42,565
Speaker 3:  trucks and cops and bikers and whatever else coming at you and then tapping

13
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,885
Speaker 3:  on the phone screen to steer away from them. The longer you make it, the

14
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:49,765
Speaker 3:  higher your score and the happier you make this scary sounding guy on the

15
00:01:49,765 --> 00:01:49,925
Speaker 3:  phone.

16
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:51,205
Speaker 4:  Okay, good.

17
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:56,765
Speaker 3:  I've never played a game quite like this before. It's really intense and

18
00:01:56,765 --> 00:02:00,605
Speaker 3:  really fun and I find myself way more focused on it because

19
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:04,365
Speaker 3:  it's all based on sound. I'm on edge all the time playing it.

20
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:08,205
Speaker 3:  It's kind of a lot. Honestly, it's been fun to play this too because it

21
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,085
Speaker 3:  feels so different than what I'm used to. We live in such visual

22
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:15,885
Speaker 3:  times right now. We scroll vertical video, we look at our TVs,

23
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:20,045
Speaker 3:  we put on VR headsets, we play these huge gorgeous open world

24
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:24,005
Speaker 3:  games. There's just always so much to look at all the time, but

25
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:27,685
Speaker 3:  there's something really powerful and different about audio. I mean, you

26
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:31,565
Speaker 3:  get it, you listen to podcasts. Podcasts are proof of how cool and

27
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:35,805
Speaker 3:  powerful audio can be, but I'd never really even thought about audio as

28
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:39,605
Speaker 3:  more than just a feature of video games. It's a way to make explosions

29
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:43,365
Speaker 3:  sound more real or at the very most alert you to when someone is

30
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:47,085
Speaker 3:  sneaking up behind you. But there's actually a rich history of audio games,

31
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:51,165
Speaker 3:  video games without the pictures and some reasons to think those games

32
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:54,885
Speaker 3:  might be coming back. One of the people responsible for a big part of that

33
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,125
Speaker 3:  history is this guy.

34
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,725
Speaker 5:  That's right, and to as a baby on A B, BC model. B because

35
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:04,765
Speaker 5:  I'm that old and wrote it was my first game isn't,

36
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,645
Speaker 5:  you know, in quotes, my first video game,

37
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:10,805
Speaker 3:  Paul's route into audio games was a windy one that actually makes

38
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:14,605
Speaker 3:  perfect sense in retrospect. He was really into games as a kid. He was writing

39
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:18,165
Speaker 3:  code on A B, BC model B in the eighties by actually

40
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:22,005
Speaker 3:  copying it out of a magazine. That was how you wrote code back then. Then

41
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:25,645
Speaker 3:  Paul got into the music business and the broadcast radio business and then

42
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:29,205
Speaker 3:  he actually ended up directing a video game version of the Game show. You

43
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:29,885
Speaker 3:  don't know Jack,

44
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:34,205
Speaker 6:  It's time for the show where high culture and pop culture

45
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:38,405
Speaker 6:  collide. Yeah, woo. Alright. We got

46
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:42,365
Speaker 6:  ourselves 1, 2, 3 players on board the flight today. Making

47
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:45,525
Speaker 3:  That game he told me was mostly about making the audio.

48
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:50,125
Speaker 5:  All of the effort of that game sort of went into phenomenal writing, good

49
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:54,005
Speaker 5:  game design and smoking mirrors that would make it seem like you were

50
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:57,965
Speaker 5:  talk that you, the player were inside a live TV

51
00:03:58,075 --> 00:04:01,885
Speaker 5:  game show and doing that kind of reawaken my, my

52
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:05,045
Speaker 5:  love for technology and creative technology and I've, I've really been doing

53
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:05,645
Speaker 5:  that ever since.

54
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:09,605
Speaker 3:  At this point Paul had built lots of different kinds of games, but he had

55
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:13,365
Speaker 3:  always thought it would be cool to make one that was all audio for

56
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,725
Speaker 3:  a couple of reasons. Actually,

57
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:18,565
Speaker 5:  There was a broadcaster in the UK called Channel four. They were

58
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:22,445
Speaker 5:  originally sort of looking for for games that were accessible, the

59
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:25,685
Speaker 5:  games that could be played by communities who were generally excluded from

60
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:29,525
Speaker 5:  from playing games. And so I didn't wanna make a game

61
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:33,685
Speaker 5:  for people with a quote disability. I wanted to make games

62
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:37,805
Speaker 5:  that everyone could play and that everyone would love without any

63
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:38,405
Speaker 5:  compromise.

64
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:42,805
Speaker 3:  Eventually he decides to do just that, build an audio only

65
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,765
Speaker 3:  game. At this point it's about 2010, which is important because

66
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:50,565
Speaker 3:  there was a big technological development that happened in 2010. The

67
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:54,405
Speaker 3:  iPhone four came out, it had a bunch of new features like the retina display

68
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:57,405
Speaker 3:  and the selfie camera and it eventually was the one that went through all

69
00:04:57,405 --> 00:05:00,365
Speaker 3:  that antennagate stuff. Remember that the whole Steve Jobs, you're holding

70
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:03,805
Speaker 3:  it wrong thing. But for Paul there was a significantly less

71
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:07,165
Speaker 3:  publicized new feature that really, really, really mattered.

72
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:11,645
Speaker 5:  IPhone four was the first of Apple's devices that had hardware acceleration

73
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,325
Speaker 5:  for floating point math. Now why is that important? It's important

74
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:18,645
Speaker 5:  because we were doing real time

75
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:23,005
Speaker 5:  binaural synthesis on a mobile device. So let's talk about binaural audio.

76
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:27,405
Speaker 5:  I have two ears, most people have two ears, but not everyone has two ears

77
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,365
Speaker 5:  and you might think that that therefore that we listen in stereo. Well we

78
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:35,085
Speaker 5:  don't. The shape of your, the fleshy bit of your ear, the pinner has got

79
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,565
Speaker 5:  these folds in it, these lumps and folds.

80
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:41,845
Speaker 3:  You probably know the basics of this sound hits your ears at different

81
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:45,325
Speaker 3:  times. Your brain does a huge amount of work to both make all of that

82
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:49,445
Speaker 3:  sound. Makes sense. And also to intuit where that sound is coming from

83
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:52,525
Speaker 3:  based on when it hits all those lumps and folds,

84
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:56,805
Speaker 5:  What it turns out that you can do is that you can get an artificial head

85
00:05:56,995 --> 00:06:00,685
Speaker 5:  with two good microphones where the ears would be and you can

86
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:04,405
Speaker 5:  blaze some white noise at that head from lots and lots of different

87
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,365
Speaker 5:  directions and you can work out how the human head

88
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:12,845
Speaker 5:  hears those sounds from different sources and you can express that in terms

89
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,645
Speaker 5:  of a big table of numbers. Now what I can do is I can take away the white

90
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:20,565
Speaker 5:  noise and I can apply those numbers to an arbitrary bit of

91
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:24,525
Speaker 5:  audio, an arbitrary audio file, and I can get the right bit of the right

92
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:28,245
Speaker 5:  number from where I want this sound to sound like where it's coming from.

93
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:32,685
Speaker 3:  I'm way oversimplifying here. But basically, once you can map sound, the

94
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:36,525
Speaker 3:  way Paul's describing, you can manipulate it, delay sound coming

95
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:40,005
Speaker 3:  from a spot on the right, just a tiny bit and it'll sound like the thing

96
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:43,885
Speaker 3:  over there is further away increase sound in the front and decrease it

97
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:47,605
Speaker 3:  behind and boom, you have something right smack in front of your face. This

98
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:50,965
Speaker 3:  is a simple enough concept, but it's really, really tricky math.

99
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:54,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah, and you're gonna do that by the way, 44,000 times a second

100
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:58,685
Speaker 5:  or 48,000 times a second because that's a typical sampling

101
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:02,605
Speaker 5:  rate for for digital audio. So as you can see, that requires a lot of

102
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:06,405
Speaker 5:  math. Pre iPhone four, there wasn't a device that could do it and

103
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,565
Speaker 5:  Apple helped us out a lot by the way, with with the accelerate framework,

104
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:13,245
Speaker 5:  which which came in at that point, which enabled us to, to do this. So

105
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:17,125
Speaker 5:  it's actually pretty simple to, it's the same as in any video game, right?

106
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,525
Speaker 5:  Imagine there's, you've got an X and y coordinates, you've got a grid in

107
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:23,965
Speaker 5:  front of you, there's X and y, and as objects move relative to the player,

108
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,605
Speaker 5:  you can change the x axis and you can change the yxi and you can calculate

109
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:31,485
Speaker 5:  where the object is. So it's just the same in that regard between

110
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:34,685
Speaker 5:  a video game and an audio game. In a video game you're just saying, well,

111
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:38,245
Speaker 5:  you know that the monster has walked diagonally away from you. So now I can

112
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:42,005
Speaker 5:  change the x axis and the Y axis position and I, I can just render that object

113
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:45,565
Speaker 5:  and you know, I'm watching it on my screen. Everyone's happy. And you can

114
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,845
Speaker 5:  do exactly the same thing with, with audio games. It's just that instead

115
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:52,645
Speaker 5:  of rendering it using whatever technique you are using to, to render an

116
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:56,565
Speaker 5:  object in, in a in video, you are just applying a bit of

117
00:07:56,565 --> 00:08:00,045
Speaker 5:  math to the the frequencies of the audio and now all of a sudden the human

118
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:03,965
Speaker 5:  being hears it, it really hears it. The pictures are better on radio

119
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:05,525
Speaker 5:  as they say, what

120
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:09,125
Speaker 3:  He's describing I should say is super normal. Now it's just

121
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:13,005
Speaker 3:  spatial audio. The idea that you can anchor something in place and then as

122
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:16,765
Speaker 3:  you like turn your head or the object itself moves, the sound moves

123
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:20,605
Speaker 3:  with it, lots of devices have this now and you can use it to all

124
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:24,525
Speaker 3:  kinds of good and dumb effects, but at the time it was revolutionary,

125
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:28,565
Speaker 3:  especially when you also had a mobile phone with you that could accurately

126
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:29,965
Speaker 3:  track your movement in space.

127
00:08:30,465 --> 00:08:34,325
Speaker 5:  We had to have an input scheme, an input control scheme in terms of changing

128
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:38,005
Speaker 5:  the relative position of the player and the audio that was incredibly

129
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:41,525
Speaker 5:  precise. You could do it with a mouse, but there was some drawbacks to that.

130
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:45,645
Speaker 5:  It's far, far better. The human being themselves is doing the turning,

131
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,805
Speaker 5:  like the head is turning itself or the body is turning and

132
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:53,525
Speaker 5:  with Vision Pro and with the current generation of spatial

133
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:57,045
Speaker 5:  AirPods and so on, well we're used to that now we actually understand that

134
00:08:57,105 --> 00:09:00,925
Speaker 5:  now back in the day that didn't exist. So we kind of had to kind of

135
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:04,765
Speaker 5:  create the hardware effect that you get from specialized

136
00:09:05,015 --> 00:09:08,965
Speaker 5:  headphones without the existence of specialized headphones. And the only

137
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,325
Speaker 5:  way that we could really see to do that was with the accelerometer and the

138
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:15,205
Speaker 5:  magnetometer inside iPhones.

139
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:19,805
Speaker 3:  So with all of this suddenly possible Ben and his team at a company

140
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:23,605
Speaker 3:  called something else set out to build an audio only game. They ended up

141
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,965
Speaker 3:  calling it Papa Sangre.

142
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:29,765
Speaker 8:  Now do as I say, or very soon

143
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:34,245
Speaker 8:  you'll forget everything and everyone you've ever known,

144
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:39,125
Speaker 3:  The plot of Papa Sangre is pretty simple. I'd feel bad spoiling it

145
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,805
Speaker 3:  for you, but the game is 13 years old and you literally can't download it

146
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:46,445
Speaker 3:  anymore. So here it goes, you're dead. You're stuck in Papa

147
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:50,725
Speaker 3:  Sangres kingdom and the only way out is by completing a journey through five

148
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:54,525
Speaker 3:  different palaces. All the bad guys and monsters are everywhere

149
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:58,125
Speaker 3:  and they're trying to stop you. All those bad guys and monsters respond to

150
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,965
Speaker 3:  sound. So you have to move as quietly as you can while also

151
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:05,405
Speaker 3:  looking for clues and talking to characters and generally trying to figure

152
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:09,325
Speaker 3:  out what's going on and where to go because you can't see anything,

153
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:10,965
Speaker 3:  there's nothing to see.

154
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:14,445
Speaker 8:  The ice is thin. You need to be careful

155
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:18,925
Speaker 3:  Making a game like this. Work is on one level, not that complicated.

156
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:22,725
Speaker 3:  You can sort of do anything you want in audio. You can make audio

157
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:26,365
Speaker 3:  pong just by using spatial audio to help you understand where the paddle

158
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,445
Speaker 3:  and ball are.

159
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,965
Speaker 3:  You can make audio Tetris Paul also says, which seems wild,

160
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:38,365
Speaker 3:  you can kind of make audio anything In the second version of Papa Sangre,

161
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,165
Speaker 3:  there was even a duck hunt style shooting game where you just followed the

162
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,725
Speaker 3:  sound of the ducks and you turn and shoot the ducks at the right moment.

163
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:52,085
Speaker 3:  Paul and his team built a few of these games over time before deciding

164
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:55,805
Speaker 3:  that wasn't what they wanted to do. It didn't feel right. We gotta take a

165
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:56,925
Speaker 3:  break and then I'll tell you why

166
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:11,945
Speaker 3:  Welcome back. So at this point in our story, it's right around

167
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:15,825
Speaker 3:  2013 after working on Papa Sangre, the team at

168
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:19,505
Speaker 3:  something else made a game called Audio Defense, which is just a

169
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,665
Speaker 3:  straightforward shooter game. This is the kind of thing Paul meant when

170
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:27,625
Speaker 3:  he talked about audio pong and audio Tetris. It's just a normal game with

171
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:31,465
Speaker 3:  normal mechanics but with no pictures. In audio defense

172
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:35,305
Speaker 3:  there are waves of bad guys coming at you, you shoot them, that's the

173
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:37,905
Speaker 3:  whole bit and it's all done just in audio.

174
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:42,305
Speaker 9:  There are zombies, you can hear them but you can't

175
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:46,425
Speaker 9:  see them turn carefully until the zombie sound is in front of you.

176
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:50,945
Speaker 5:  It was a very interesting game in in that regard. It was a, a much more

177
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:54,825
Speaker 5:  sort of casual game sort of pickup put down and it was effective and it

178
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:58,745
Speaker 5:  worked. I think what what we realized after releasing that

179
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:02,625
Speaker 5:  game was that the natural benefits of audio games

180
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:06,665
Speaker 5:  meant that more artistic, more carefully considered

181
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:10,745
Speaker 5:  more complex experiences, certainly for our team with with

182
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:14,665
Speaker 5:  our skills, would probably find a better market fit than that game. You

183
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:18,505
Speaker 5:  would think that that game, if people like the other, the other Papa Sangre

184
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:22,145
Speaker 5:  games, the audio defense would just find a a larger audience. After all,

185
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:25,625
Speaker 5:  it's the same kind of mechanic, but it's much, much more simple and it's

186
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:29,585
Speaker 5:  much easier to understand. Funnily enough, that didn't happen, the game

187
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:31,025
Speaker 5:  didn't do as well as the other games.

188
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:34,785
Speaker 3:  There's something else team really thought audio defense was gonna be huge.

189
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:38,425
Speaker 3:  But in retrospect, Paul seems to think that it kind of makes sense that it

190
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:42,385
Speaker 3:  wasn't because the best audio games aren't just audio versions

191
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:46,145
Speaker 3:  of video games. There are some cool accessibility upsides to that

192
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:49,985
Speaker 3:  for sure, letting more people get access to these kinds of games. But he's

193
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:53,905
Speaker 3:  more intrigued by the idea of what you can only do in an audio

194
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:54,225
Speaker 3:  game.

195
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:58,265
Speaker 5:  It's related to the fact that the earliest way that that humans

196
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:02,025
Speaker 5:  told stories to each other would've course be round, you know, be verbally,

197
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:05,745
Speaker 5:  orally, round, round the campfire and there is a mode and a pacing

198
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,585
Speaker 5:  to that kind of storytelling and a way that

199
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:14,065
Speaker 5:  words can be used to conjure up images and ideas in the

200
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:17,905
Speaker 5:  listener that all of a sudden If you are just purely concentrating on in

201
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:21,425
Speaker 5:  terms of an audio game. You can also use and a

202
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:25,345
Speaker 5:  story told orally is very different to a story

203
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:29,225
Speaker 5:  told graphically. There are reasons of pacing, there are reasons

204
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:33,305
Speaker 5:  of how different ideas are introduced and and worked

205
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:37,145
Speaker 5:  on, but mainly again, it's because there's a complicity between

206
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:41,105
Speaker 5:  the listener and the storyteller that has a different kind of

207
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:44,945
Speaker 5:  suspension of disbelief or a different kind of enactment of belief, a different

208
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:48,705
Speaker 5:  kind of purposeful volition on on the part of the audience. And

209
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:52,645
Speaker 5:  it means that you have a, I'm not gonna say it's better or worse, I personally

210
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:55,645
Speaker 5:  think it's more interesting. You have a broader power of things that you

211
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:59,605
Speaker 5:  can do. Again, I've sort of sort of said it's more like a novel kind

212
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:03,045
Speaker 5:  of the, the subtlety and the complexity of the ideas that that you can introduce

213
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:06,925
Speaker 5:  and develop are just different from what you contend to do in,

214
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:08,085
Speaker 5:  in video games.

215
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:12,325
Speaker 3:  There's this longstanding debate in gaming about the role of storytelling.

216
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:16,165
Speaker 3:  There are those who think it's super important that cut scenes are crucial,

217
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:20,205
Speaker 3:  that you can do as much or more good narrative work in a game as you

218
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:23,805
Speaker 3:  can in a movie. And then there are those who just smash the A button to get

219
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:27,645
Speaker 3:  through cut scenes. I should confess I'm mostly one of those people, but

220
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:31,605
Speaker 3:  in an audio game there seems to just be more space, more freedom

221
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:35,525
Speaker 3:  to just let the story be the whole thing. Really you have no choice

222
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:39,525
Speaker 3:  but to be more thoughtful about it or the whole thing will just devolve into

223
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:39,765
Speaker 3:  chaos.

224
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:43,285
Speaker 5:  So if I'm playing a video game, think about how many different pieces of

225
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:47,005
Speaker 5:  information I can have on that screen at the same time. You know, If, you

226
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:50,925
Speaker 5:  think about something like any modern, highly polished AAA game.

227
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:54,525
Speaker 5:  You've typically got n numbers of different things about the status of you

228
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:57,645
Speaker 5:  as a, as a, let's say it's a first person shooter or a first person game

229
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,485
Speaker 5:  anyway, you've got n number of things that demonstrate the status of your

230
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:05,365
Speaker 5:  avatar of you, of you in the game. Plus you've got the ER position of

231
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:08,765
Speaker 5:  n number of different objects, plus you've got the different choice of weapon

232
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:12,565
Speaker 5:  or object in your, in your hand. There's just hundreds of different pieces

233
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:16,085
Speaker 5:  of information, you know, relative position of your other players and so

234
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:19,205
Speaker 5:  on. And human beings aren't that great when it comes to

235
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:23,045
Speaker 5:  discriminating usefully, discriminating lots of different sound

236
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:26,805
Speaker 5:  sources at the same time. We tend to try and focus on a small amount,

237
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,005
Speaker 5:  one or two sound sources at the same time. And there's an upper limit to

238
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:33,085
Speaker 5:  how many you can really have simultaneously before the human being just gonna

239
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:36,885
Speaker 5:  goes. Well you know, I, it's fine if I'm at a dinner

240
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:40,845
Speaker 5:  party or I'm a in a nightclub or if I'm on the street because I have a

241
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:44,285
Speaker 5:  bunch of other things in terms of situational context knowledge, contextual

242
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:47,765
Speaker 5:  knowledge that help me focus on the different things that are actually important

243
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:51,045
Speaker 5:  at that moment. But if I'm creating an entirely artificial

244
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:55,005
Speaker 5:  experience, then I have to be much, much more directed and much, much more

245
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:58,645
Speaker 5:  careful in terms of what I'm presenting to the player for them to,

246
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:02,685
Speaker 5:  to be able to focus on and get information which is gonna help them

247
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:06,005
Speaker 5:  enjoy the system because it needs to be fun and

248
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:09,765
Speaker 5:  trying to, you know, playing a game of what should I be listening to now

249
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:10,685
Speaker 5:  is is not fun.

250
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:15,645
Speaker 3:  Normally when you get to a big moment in a video game, there is so much going

251
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:19,685
Speaker 3:  on at all times, but here is a climactic moment in Papa

252
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,605
Speaker 3:  Sangre, just listen to how it goes.

253
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:27,405
Speaker 10:  We feed the hogs chicken meat, not your flesh.

254
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,565
Speaker 3:  This all sounds like kind of a niche thing now, but Papa Sangre

255
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:37,245
Speaker 3:  was a big hit and Papa Sangre too, even more so when

256
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:41,125
Speaker 3:  that second game the sequel came out in 2013, it was one of the

257
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:45,005
Speaker 3:  best reviewed games of the year with a 92% score on meta

258
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:45,245
Speaker 3:  critic

259
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:49,360
Speaker 5:  For most of the year. It was literally the best reviewed iPhone game of the

260
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,325
Speaker 5:  year and folks who classified themselves as blind

261
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:57,245
Speaker 5:  lost their shit. Someone had gone out and had tried to

262
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:01,845
Speaker 5:  assemble a, a team of talented people to make an experience

263
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:05,925
Speaker 5:  that had absolutely no compromise in terms of

264
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,165
Speaker 5:  its playability and its enjoyment.

265
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:11,565
Speaker 3:  I just went back and looked by the way, and it was actually tied for number

266
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:15,365
Speaker 3:  one in mobile games that year. The company behind it, Paul's company something

267
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:19,045
Speaker 3:  else, made a couple of other games and ended up selling to Sony and then

268
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:19,965
Speaker 3:  Sony for

269
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:50,965
Speaker 1:  promo code VERGE 20 to receive $20 off your first month for

270
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:51,765
Speaker 1:  listening to this podcast.

271
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:59,215
Speaker 3:  Welcome back. So let's go back to 2010 when the iPhone four

272
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:02,655
Speaker 3:  came out and it was this perfect confluence of technology that made a really

273
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:05,735
Speaker 3:  cool spatial audio game possible for the first time. Remember that moment?

274
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,775
Speaker 3:  Well Paul Benon thinks we're at another one of those moments right now.

275
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,535
Speaker 5:  You know, I've genuinely, I've never been more excited about the possibilities

276
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:16,655
Speaker 5:  for spatial audio and games. I really haven't. There was this alchemy that

277
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,215
Speaker 5:  happened at the beginning of the Papa Sangre. Titles were creative idea and

278
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:24,055
Speaker 5:  technology and just kind of the ecosystem around it sort of came

279
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:26,855
Speaker 5:  together to make those gains happen. And there's another point like that

280
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:30,855
Speaker 5:  right now. Spatial computing, for example, in quotes, VR

281
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:34,335
Speaker 5:  meta has sold more Quest threes than Xboxes in the last couple of years.

282
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:38,335
Speaker 5:  The the hardware is out there for experiences like this. And

283
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:42,575
Speaker 5:  by hardware I also mean things like small headphones that have

284
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,695
Speaker 5:  really good noise canceling.

285
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,535
Speaker 3:  You're the first person I've ever talked to who thinks about the Vision Pro

286
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:50,365
Speaker 3:  as an audio device. Yeah and I love that. But I'm, I'm curious kind of how

287
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:51,885
Speaker 3:  you think about what that could be.

288
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:55,445
Speaker 5:  So I, I think it's interesting If, you look at the difference, like the philosophical

289
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:58,805
Speaker 5:  difference between something like Vision Pro and Meta

290
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:02,685
Speaker 5:  Excellent Hardware, which has, you know, got lots and lots of benefits different

291
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:05,965
Speaker 5:  ways, but the overall difference where Apple has really concentrated

292
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:09,965
Speaker 5:  has been on being able to, to bring virtual

293
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:13,965
Speaker 5:  objects into the space that you are in, that really literally is spatial

294
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:17,405
Speaker 5:  com. You know, spatial computing is their shtick and it's very good at that.

295
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:21,525
Speaker 5:  And those objects don't need to be visual. They can be audible and

296
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:25,005
Speaker 5:  still be in line with Apple's design philosophy and If. you think about what

297
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:28,045
Speaker 5:  the, the early Papa Sangre games were about, that's what they were about.

298
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:32,245
Speaker 5:  They were about objects that you couldn't see in the physical space that

299
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:36,045
Speaker 5:  you were in. You know, that's how those games worked. It's literally

300
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,205
Speaker 5:  how those games worked and that fits very closely

301
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:43,485
Speaker 5:  with Apple's design principles, provision Pro. It doesn't

302
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:46,645
Speaker 5:  exclude it from things like Quest as well. And I'm, I'm sure that if, if

303
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:50,325
Speaker 5:  and when the Quest Pro two comes out or the the new

304
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:54,085
Speaker 5:  hardware that we know that's licensing Horizon os I'm sure that some of that's

305
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:57,645
Speaker 5:  gonna ha gonna be able to compete in terms of low latency, high definition

306
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:01,285
Speaker 5:  pass through video. So we'll see how long that that advantage is

307
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:04,125
Speaker 5:  maintained. But these devices are great for the kind of thing that we're

308
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,445
Speaker 5:  talking about, I would say. I think they're phenomenal. They're a little

309
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:10,925
Speaker 5:  heavier, right? Sure. And you don't, you don't need to have that thing strapped

310
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:14,485
Speaker 5:  to your head. The AirPods Pro that I'm wearing right now, an ideal

311
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:15,725
Speaker 5:  solution for this kind of thing.

312
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:20,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah. What are the kind of specs that matter there? I mean, you know,

313
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:23,925
Speaker 3:  again, as we talk about screens, we're in this incredible GPU

314
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,805
Speaker 3:  race and everybody's trying to make the higher density screens with higher

315
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:30,605
Speaker 3:  refresh rates. I'm sure there are other kind of measurable specs that are

316
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:33,725
Speaker 3:  getting better over time, but what are those things that you would look at

317
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,365
Speaker 3:  as sort of raw technical advancements?

318
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:39,125
Speaker 5:  I think that we've reached a stage where that's no longer an issue. Okay,

319
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:42,765
Speaker 5:  in terms of speakers in your ears, that's no longer an issue. Bluetooth's,

320
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:45,685
Speaker 5:  like I mentioned earlier on, that you need to have an output that's proportional

321
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:49,405
Speaker 5:  to input and latency is very important, but you know, apple

322
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:52,525
Speaker 5:  is targeted, I think it's 1212 milliseconds or it might be eight milliseconds

323
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:56,365
Speaker 5:  or something like that in terms of response to, to input. And

324
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:59,205
Speaker 5:  that is fine, it's fine.

325
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:03,445
Speaker 3:  It's more than just the audio stuff too. Think about what you can do with

326
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:07,085
Speaker 3:  great voice recognition and generative AI that can create a

327
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,805
Speaker 3:  personalized game script on the fly. Or the fact that your phone's

328
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:14,925
Speaker 3:  location services work indoors now. So you can actually move through a game

329
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,805
Speaker 3:  by moving through your living room and think about what's even possible in

330
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:22,525
Speaker 3:  multiplayer gaming when instead of rendering someone's weird avatar

331
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:26,445
Speaker 3:  with no legs or a crazy looking face, you can just bring their

332
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:27,845
Speaker 3:  voice into the space with you

333
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:32,325
Speaker 5:  To stumble across your friend in a space and find out that that they're

334
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:36,245
Speaker 5:  there is the kind of surprise and the kind of magic that would be

335
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:40,125
Speaker 5:  phenomenal in one of these games. And the ability to, to shout to your friend

336
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:43,765
Speaker 5:  that you need some help. And not just like if you're playing Call of Duty,

337
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:48,055
Speaker 5:  but in a way that's weirdly more practical because it's the only

338
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:50,495
Speaker 5:  way that you can communicate. Like if I'm playing Call of Duty, of course

339
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:53,855
Speaker 5:  I can leave some, I can leave some loo for anyone for a random person. But

340
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:57,375
Speaker 5:  if I'm running out of ammunition or something or you have a resource which

341
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:00,455
Speaker 5:  I need to unlock this door in the next five seconds and I have the resource,

342
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:04,175
Speaker 5:  the tension of me throwing that object to you or getting over to you to give

343
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:08,015
Speaker 5:  you that object is a set of really interesting things that are fun to explore

344
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:11,175
Speaker 5:  in, in a playful experience. And they're absolutely on the roadmap.

345
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:15,495
Speaker 3:  One game I think a lot about in this context is Zombies Run, which is sort

346
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:19,455
Speaker 3:  of a hybrid of an exercise app and a video game. The idea is that the

347
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:23,415
Speaker 3:  game tells a story as you run and then when the zombies get

348
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:26,895
Speaker 3:  too close, you have to pick up the pace and run faster and the game actually

349
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:29,735
Speaker 3:  knows and responds to how fast you're moving. Yeah,

350
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:33,615
Speaker 11:  Go raise the gates, please. You know what, just raise the gates.

351
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:34,895
Speaker 11:  All righty

352
00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:38,055
Speaker 3:  There. I love Zombies Run by the way. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

353
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:42,375
Speaker 3:  And now I'm just imagining like an audio ar game that

354
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:46,055
Speaker 3:  follows you around as you go about your day and then every once in a while

355
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,815
Speaker 3:  just adds zombies and makes you hide or run away. I don't know, maybe your

356
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:52,255
Speaker 3:  whole office could play together and it would interrupt all your meetings.

357
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:56,415
Speaker 3:  This sounds awesome to me and it only works in audio. There

358
00:24:56,415 --> 00:25:00,335
Speaker 3:  really haven't been a lot of great audio games in recent years. People

359
00:25:00,395 --> 00:25:04,375
Speaker 3:  in the community still talk a lot about Papa Sangre actually and how sad

360
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:08,095
Speaker 3:  they are that it's gone. There are a few games out there though, as I mentioned

361
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:11,695
Speaker 3:  earlier, blind Drive is pretty fun. And I also played one called Fear,

362
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:15,815
Speaker 3:  FEER. That is another of those endless runner style games

363
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:19,775
Speaker 3:  like Subway surfer or Temple Run where you dodge enemies and obstacles

364
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:23,495
Speaker 3:  and just try to make it as long as you can. But the trick here is of course

365
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:24,695
Speaker 3:  it's all audio.

366
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:30,935
Speaker 3:  These games are really different from what I'm used to, but they're really

367
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:34,815
Speaker 3:  fun and at least If you believe, Paul, the audio game is due for a

368
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:35,215
Speaker 3:  comeback.

369
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:39,095
Speaker 5:  It's a thing which we know about now. It's a thing that we are

370
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:43,055
Speaker 5:  culturally ready for in a way that we weren't. And you've also identified

371
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:46,895
Speaker 5:  the fact that visual culture, visual entertainment on the

372
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:50,575
Speaker 5:  same device that we would be putting this on or similar devices is also much,

373
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:54,415
Speaker 5:  much more addictive and much, much harder to compete with. So all those

374
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:57,935
Speaker 5:  things are true. I think that the scale, the sheer volume

375
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:02,335
Speaker 5:  of devices and hardware that's in the market, but

376
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:06,215
Speaker 5:  we can't compete with TikTok, but we can compete with podcasts, we can compete

377
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:09,895
Speaker 5:  with audio, and we can also be a part of the gaming

378
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:13,815
Speaker 5:  economy, ecology, landscape. So all of that

379
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:17,095
Speaker 5:  makes me think that it absolutely is worthwhile doing.

380
00:26:17,735 --> 00:26:18,855
Speaker 5:  Exciting to explore.

381
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:26,015
Speaker 3:  Alright, that's it for us today. Thanks to Paul for being here. And thank
