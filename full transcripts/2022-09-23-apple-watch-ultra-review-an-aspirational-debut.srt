00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,040
Speaker 2:  the apple watch ultra. And for some reason, we let Alex talk about JPS. Again.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,170
Speaker 2:  It's coming up right after this. That's the Vergecast coming up

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,430

6
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,830
Speaker 2:  Hello and welcome to our chest. The flagship podcast

7
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,810
Speaker 2:  of very large wrist wear.

8
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,490
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

9
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,900
Speaker 2:  It's good. Honestly, I didn't think about it too much beforehand. Anyway,

10
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,620
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend. Eli. David Pierce is here.

11
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,500
Speaker 6:  Hi, I have a small blast and I'm sad about it now, but we're gonna talk

12
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,260
Speaker 6:  about it. I have feelings.

13
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,580
Speaker 2:  Well get ready, Alex. Kranz is

14
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,500
Speaker 5:  Here. I once had a 50 millimeter watch, but I was also in third

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,480
Speaker 5:  grade. So it was just like comical.

16
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,990
Speaker 2:  Did he just look like flavor play?

17
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,170
Speaker 5:  There's a photo somewhere on the internet of me with it. It's incredible

18
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,240
Speaker 5:  little like Bob haircut. It's great.

19
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,920
Speaker 2:  And Victoria song is here. Hey back.

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,700
Speaker 7:  Hey, I am double resting the largest apple watch possible.

21
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,280
Speaker 7:  And the smallest ones simultaneously,

22
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,180
Speaker 2:  Are you like selectively deciding which one to deploy depending

23
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,980
Speaker 2:  on situation like I'm at the bank. Big

24
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,570
Speaker 2:  watch

25
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,920
Speaker 7:  I should, but I haven't. So I will now.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,140
Speaker 2:  All right, well, we'll get into it because V just re reviewed the apple watch

27
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,900
Speaker 2:  ultra of which I spent. I don't know what my

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,860
Speaker 2:  contribution was. They sent me one too, and I also played with it, but V

29
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,380
Speaker 2:  actually reviewed it in the context of an actual review. I just tried to

30
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,980
Speaker 2:  avoid breaking my NDA. As I walked around the world with a giant watch.

31
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,640
Speaker 2:  Marist.

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,620
Speaker 6:  How successful were you? Actually, I actually wanna this about both of you,

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,940
Speaker 6:  because one of the things we heard from apple, like right off the bat, like

34
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,390
Speaker 6:  there was this story that they were telling us that like during the event,

35
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,500
Speaker 6:  as they announced the ultra, all the apple executives had to take off their

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,060
Speaker 6:  watches and put on ultras because otherwise they were so large. You'd be

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,560
Speaker 6:  able to tell. Yeah. Did you guys get caught out for wearing ultras

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,870
Speaker 6:  before you were supposed to

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,400
Speaker 2:  Like constantly?

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,810
Speaker 7:  Not at all?

41
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,160
Speaker 6:  No.

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,720
Speaker 2:  That's so

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,600
Speaker 7:  Funny. No, not at all. Which you would think people would notice it more

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,560
Speaker 7:  on me because I have really petite risks, but you know,

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,960
Speaker 7:  I went grocery shopping. I went to all these places, not a single person

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,840
Speaker 7:  clocked it on me. And when I went hiking with my friends, one of them

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Speaker 7:  was just like, oh, is that the new series eight? And she's a non-techie so

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,600
Speaker 7:  yeah. Yeah. That's that's to be expected. I was like, no, you, he,

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,590
Speaker 7:  then it's an old,

50
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,360
Speaker 2:  Well, I will say so it happened to, and I live in the middle of nowhere at

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,280
Speaker 2:  like 20 yards away at a golf course. A dude came, which I think is

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,920
Speaker 2:  like, where dudes notice watches. Yes. Like that's a target rich

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,800
Speaker 2:  environment for watched dudes once the grocery store. And

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,680
Speaker 2:  then when I was getting my new booster, the pharmacist, like needle and

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
Speaker 2:  hand, right. Like shooting the stuff in the air, I was like, Ooh. And I was

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,120
Speaker 2:  like, let's one step at a time. I'll talk to you

57
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,840
Speaker 2:  about this afterwards. So yeah. I mean, I, maybe it's just like a, like a

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,750
Speaker 2:  dude's noticing, watch this thing, but I just it's so big.

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,000
Speaker 2:  Also what watch face were you using? V

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,760
Speaker 7:  I was switching between a bunch of them, but I was using the Wayfinder one

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,680
Speaker 7:  because that's the one that's exclusive to the ultra. Ah,

62
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,440
Speaker 2:  Well, we should say so, like I said, Victoria reviewed the apple watch. We've

63
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,800
Speaker 2:  got AirPods pro the second gen review to talk about. Although I think Chris

64
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,480
Speaker 2:  Welch is coming on the show to really get into it with that soon.

65
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,120
Speaker 2:  There's a bunch of GPU news. Talk about a little lightning round of gadgets.

66
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,920
Speaker 2:  So started with the apple watch review. So I was using the infograph

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,800
Speaker 2:  modular face, like the straight face I always use, which is

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,760
Speaker 2:  like pretty colorful and full of text. It's got like, I have my

69
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,800
Speaker 2:  calendar in the middle and it's got obviously the rings and whatever. And

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,680
Speaker 2:  that one just seemed like everyone could read it from five miles away.

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,320
Speaker 2:  Cause the screen is really big. Yeah. It it's like the main

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,800
Speaker 2:  thing. If you're not like an extreme sports athlete, what you're getting

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,760
Speaker 2:  out of this is basically infinite battery life and the screen

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,830
Speaker 2:  is gigantic.

75
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,640
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So the, the good baby boomer watch, Hey. Or

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,520
Speaker 7:  if you're like me and you have the world's worst eyesight. So like I go

77
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,920
Speaker 7:  into the accessibility settings and crank the text up to the

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,670
Speaker 7:  largest possible thing and everyone can just read my texts from my wrist.

79
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,420
Speaker 7:  It's bad, but I can read it. So that's great.

80
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,400
Speaker 7:  And yeah, that's all that matters. And texting's easier. No typos when I

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,360
Speaker 7:  use swipe to type on the ultra, whereas it's typo city everywhere else. So

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,280
Speaker 7:  there are benefits.

83
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Speaker 2:  It's big enough that I could just push the letters. I wasn't even swiping.

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,040
Speaker 2:  I was just like, boo, boop. Like, this is just a keyboard that I'm

85
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,790
Speaker 2:  using on my wrist. I think it's in your review. Like this is as close to

86
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,200
Speaker 2:  like an iPhone on your wrist. Yeah. As you can get

87
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,440
Speaker 2:  without actually crossing over to it's a phone on your wrist,

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,500
Speaker 7:  Especially because the screen is flat.

89
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,440
Speaker 6:  The you, I, I know you have tried to do this many times and it's

90
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,400
Speaker 6:  borderline impossible, but like I still cannot wrap my head around how

91
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,080
Speaker 6:  big this thing actually is to wear all day. Because like you see all the

92
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,860
Speaker 6:  pictures everybody's wrists are different. And like, I think you

93
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,800
Speaker 6:  had the same experience I did in mine was much briefer, but like

94
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,960
Speaker 6:  picking it up and putting it on and being like, oh, this is lighter than

95
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,680
Speaker 6:  I expected. It doesn't feel monstrous, but like, it looks

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,560
Speaker 6:  humongous. And I feel like I'm like putting on my coat. I feel like it

97
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,440
Speaker 6:  would catch every single time. I feel like I would like scratch it on doorways

98
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,880
Speaker 6:  as I walk through. Like, I don't know how big is this thing

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 7:  Actually. Well, David, I'm glad you asked because I had such

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,880
Speaker 7:  cognitive dissonance over the past week. I was like, am I getting ultra

101
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,720
Speaker 7:  pilled? Do I not understand what sizes anymore what's going

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,480
Speaker 7:  on? And the thing is is that this is a 49 millimeter

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,960
Speaker 7:  watch, but it's like, I would say it's the equivalent of a 50 to

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,740
Speaker 7:  51 millimeter round watch. But it gets to be small. Like

105
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,400
Speaker 7:  you can tell, I have spent like nights staring at the ceiling

106
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,760
Speaker 7:  thinking about the size because I

107
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,090
Speaker 5:  Was it's just like,

108
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,960
Speaker 7:  So the width is 44 mill. See, I can tell you the measurements off the

109
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,360
Speaker 7:  top of my head. I even bought digital calibers to help me because I was having,

110
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Speaker 7:  like, I was having just such an existential crisis.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,680
Speaker 7:  Cause I don't love big watches. And the, it, it is like

112
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,600
Speaker 7:  44 millimeters in terms of the width, which is the same as the

113
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,360
Speaker 7:  44 to 45 millimeter apple watches. Okay. Which is why, when you

114
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,080
Speaker 7:  look at it, it doesn't seem as humongous as a

115
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,760
Speaker 7:  49 millimeter watch should be. If this was a 49

116
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,160
Speaker 7:  millimeter round watch, it would look like a dinner plate. Yeah. On my wrist.

117
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,050
Speaker 7:  That makes sense. Now it just looks gigantic, but not like, wait,

118
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,230
Speaker 7:  oh my God, what are you doing? Gigantic.

119
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,160
Speaker 2:  I don't think I put this together. You're saying it's it's the same width

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,080
Speaker 2:  is the previous ones. But it's taller. Yes. The software has to have

121
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,560
Speaker 2:  scaled differently

122
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,040
Speaker 7:  Then. Yeah, it does. But when you put the

123
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,360
Speaker 7:  45 millimeter series eight next to the

124
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,260
Speaker 7:  49 millimeter series eight, you're just kind of like, oh, it's not that big.

125
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,080
Speaker 7:  But you know, at the same time, if you put the 40 or 41 millimeter watches

126
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,560
Speaker 7:  next to the 45 ones, you're like, oh, that's not that big. It's when you

127
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,920
Speaker 7:  put the, the smallest watches next to the largest one that you're like, oh,

128
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,440
Speaker 7:  this is honking huge. This is gigantic. This

129
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,550
Speaker 2:  Is

130
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,680
Speaker 7:  What the hell. It's the size of a fig Newton. That's what it is.

131
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,640
Speaker 5:  I was about to say, you, you, you were tweeting with like calibers and like

132
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,450
Speaker 5:  it's the size of a fig Newton, which is heavier a fig Newton

133
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,040
Speaker 5:  or the watch, the

134
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,470
Speaker 7:  Watch.

135
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,070
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

136
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,880
Speaker 7:  A fig Newton is not titanium. It's

137
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,070
Speaker 7:  it's

138
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,270
Speaker 5:  I mean, they're, they're hefty cookies

139
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,200
Speaker 2:  Also extremely limited connectivity on a few

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,300
Speaker 5:  Moon. Yeah, no, yeah. Really bad connectivity

141
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,120
Speaker 2:  Zig. The only,

142
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,500
Speaker 5:  It's almost none.

143
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,110
Speaker 6:  You can only swipe type on the fig Newton. It's a real problem.

144
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,560
Speaker 7:  I was just trying to find something that everyone could like go into their

145
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,760
Speaker 7:  house and be like, oh, this is what it is so that you don't have to like

146
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,750
Speaker 7:  memorize numbers.

147
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,840
Speaker 2:  I I'm excited for the people out there who are gonna put a fig Nuant on the

148
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,270
Speaker 2:  wrist. Just like for a day.

149
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's just to figure it out, like

150
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,350
Speaker 6:  Having a bag of flour to prepare for

151
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,200
Speaker 2:  Like the Palm team walked around with a block of wood to like, see what

152
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,960
Speaker 2:  a Palm pilot would look like. Like I'm just gotta fig Nuant to my wrist.

153
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,400
Speaker 2:  I'm just seeing if this is worth $800. That's the, the size of it is

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Speaker 2:  something it's lighter than you think. I actually, I think it's too big and

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Speaker 2:  I have bigger wrists than V V. It sounds like, like you are all tripled.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,190
Speaker 2:  You're like, this is fine. This is what I'm doing. I

157
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,760
Speaker 7:  Really hate to admit it. But I was talking with Dan over slack and we're

158
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,560
Speaker 7:  like, are we ultra pilled? Are we okay? What's wrong? Because we're both

159
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,760
Speaker 7:  very firmly on the side. That smart watches are getting too big. And I still

160
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,320
Speaker 7:  believe that it's just, you know, I didn't realize how bad my eyesight has

161
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,920
Speaker 7:  gotten over the course of my life because I'm just like, wow, I can read

162
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,120
Speaker 7:  without squinting and putting it right directly in front of my face. And

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,040
Speaker 7:  that's yeah. Been a revelation. So like, there are are reasons to have a

164
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,280
Speaker 7:  bigger watch. Fashion is absolutely not one of them, but there are

165
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,130
Speaker 7:  reasons

166
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,800
Speaker 2:  MI Eli I'm shocked. You're a big watch guy though. I mean, I

167
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,520
Speaker 2:  do wear a larger watch when I, well, I buy the larger

168
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Speaker 2:  apple Watchers, just still not a big watch on me. And then when I wear a

169
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,620
Speaker 2:  regular watch, I tend to buy big washes. But, but you think this is too big,

170
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,080
Speaker 2:  you know, it's inter it's the thing that he's talking about with the

171
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,160
Speaker 2:  screen. So I'm very much appreciate the screen is

172
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,040
Speaker 2:  bigger. I am like paranoid that if I was in an office

173
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,840
Speaker 2:  or out in the world, like everyone could read my texts. Like it's, I don't

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,640
Speaker 2:  need to turn up the font size all the way, but it's already at

175
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,440
Speaker 2:  its default. Just like big enough to, I think you can just comfortably read

176
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,400
Speaker 2:  it from far away. So like, you know, and you can just like change all the

177
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,960
Speaker 2:  settings. I've turned it all off. So it shows you the preview until you hold

178
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,200
Speaker 2:  it up. But there's like a, I think there's a real balance here between

179
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,050
Speaker 2:  how personal, the information that comes through on your wrist is

180
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,840
Speaker 2:  on a thing that's on display versus how big the screen is. And I,

181
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,560
Speaker 2:  you know, I just like have to use it to be comfortable like thinking,

182
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,360
Speaker 2:  oh, maybe one time the text will come through the settings won't work and

183
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,420
Speaker 2:  you'll just be able to read whatever summit. Cause my hand's on the table.

184
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,040
Speaker 5:  I'm just thinking of like celebrities at a basketball game, sitting court

185
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,900
Speaker 5:  side, and they get like a really spicy text from somebody.

186
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,000
Speaker 5:  And it's just photographed by everyone,

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,800
Speaker 2:  Everyone you're thinking of like Adam Levine being

188
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,780
Speaker 5:  Like, yeah, just that spicy text

189
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,320
Speaker 2:  Way with his apple watch

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,680
Speaker 5:  Courtside Lakers. I

191
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,880
Speaker 2:  Don't know. I, I know where your brain went immediately.

192
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,830
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Immediately. Incredible.

193
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,000
Speaker 2:  Well, we won't quote the Adam Levine text. I will tell you that you should

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,200
Speaker 2:  read them cuz they're hilarious. They're

195
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,230
Speaker 5:  Very funny.

196
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,080
Speaker 2:  Flatly hilarious. And it's also not black. Yeah. So for $800, I

197
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,770
Speaker 2:  want a black one.

198
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,040
Speaker 5:  Oh, interesting. The colors part of the problem for

199
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,200
Speaker 2:  You. Yeah. I think it would like look smaller if it was black. Also I like

200
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,960
Speaker 2:  things that are black and it's you only can only get one color. Your choices

201
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,880
Speaker 2:  are what extremely loud color band do you want? And

202
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,800
Speaker 2:  I spent the day wearing the orange one. The that's the trail one, right?

203
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,200
Speaker 7:  That's the Alpine one. Yeah.

204
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I was just walking around being like, I'm already paranoid. Everyone's

205
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,830
Speaker 2:  looking at this thing and now it's bright orange.

206
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,660
Speaker 5:  Like,

207
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,560
Speaker 2:  And I'm just in my house. I mean, but these

208
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,160
Speaker 2:  are like purely aesthetic concerns. I think the other thing for me, and I

209
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,960
Speaker 2:  don't know if you felt this way, that software is so much the

210
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,600
Speaker 2:  same and it really is just scaled up. And it's

211
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
Speaker 2:  surprising to me that I didn't even realize it wasn't scaled like perfectly

212
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,130
Speaker 2:  linearly that the screen is taller than it is wide on the series eight

213
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,040
Speaker 2:  because it it's so similar that unless you are paying attention, you would

214
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Speaker 2:  not see it. That actually the screen is a different aspect ratio and the

215
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,000
Speaker 2:  software has changed its scaling because unless you're using one of the new

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,560
Speaker 2:  modes, the experience of this watch apart from the battery life, which is

217
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,110
Speaker 2:  phenomenal, is exactly the same.

218
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,000
Speaker 7:  That's kind of the story of all three of the apple watches this time

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,920
Speaker 7:  around is that the bulk of what makes them good is in watch a west

220
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,760
Speaker 7:  nine, which is it's a significant update compared to like watch USA. It was

221
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,600
Speaker 7:  just like, Hey, be more Zen. You're all stressed. But watch OS nine is an

222
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,520
Speaker 7:  actual update update. And it's just kind of

223
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,280
Speaker 7:  weird what they decided to include on what watch, but just

224
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,090
Speaker 7:  generally speaking, having used all of them, the software experience

225
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,920
Speaker 7:  is basically the same. So you're really only getting

226
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,690
Speaker 7:  the ultra for either aesthetic or durability

227
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,460
Speaker 7:  or battery reasons. And let's be real. Most, most people don't need

228
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,080
Speaker 7:  the durability, even though, you know, people are screaming that I need the

229
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,660
Speaker 7:  Sapphire crystal, most of you don't you, you just don't like

230
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,550
Speaker 7:  you don't

231
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,360
Speaker 5:  Well, I, I thought there was interesting. There's some stuff that's gate

232
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,320
Speaker 5:  kept to it. That seems really odd to be gate kept to it like the, the night

233
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,200
Speaker 5:  mode where it just goes completely red. Why is that only on

234
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,470
Speaker 5:  that watch and not the other ones. Do we have an answer to that?

235
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,490
Speaker 7:  I guess they're assuming that you're going to be in pitch black conditions

236
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,240
Speaker 7:  outside when you're on a trail and that might help you read more New

237
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,050
Speaker 7:  York city has so much light pollution that I didn't really get to try it

238
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,000
Speaker 7:  in pitch black settings just yet. I will in Iceland, but you know, I did

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,800
Speaker 7:  sit in a closet. I did turn the lights off.

240
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,540
Speaker 5:  Thank you.

241
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,240
Speaker 7:  And I did turn it on night mode and I was like, oh, okay. This is fine. I

242
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,880
Speaker 7:  feel like a gamer. That's cool. I guess it works. I don't know that

243
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Speaker 7:  it's actually easier to read.

244
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,080
Speaker 5:  Somebody was tweeting about how like they were an astronomer and that mode

245
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,240
Speaker 5:  was gonna be really exciting for them because their eyes weren't gonna get,

246
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,520
Speaker 5:  like they wouldn't have to worry about the light change fluctuations. Like

247
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,570
Speaker 5:  they would with a regular watch.

248
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,200
Speaker 2:  Oh, I have an app on my phone called Skyview where you like, hold it up to

249
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,520
Speaker 2:  the sky and it shows you where the stars are and it has that red mode and

250
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,430
Speaker 2:  it rules.

251
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,190
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

252
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,920
Speaker 2:  Also that app is cool. If you can see stars and I

253
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,320
Speaker 7:  Have to try

254
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,280
Speaker 2:  It. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great

255
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,520
Speaker 5:  Idea. That seems dope.

256
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,480
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I'm gonna go chase the Northern lights next week in Iceland. So

257
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,000
Speaker 7:  I'll try it then and report back.

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,480
Speaker 5:  Does it only work with like pitch black

259
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,510
Speaker 5:  conditions?

260
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,470
Speaker 7:  I just don't think like if you're in a closet and you turn the lights off,

261
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,040
Speaker 7:  it's just like, anti-climactic, you're like, oh, it's red. That's

262
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,910
Speaker 7:  fine.

263
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

264
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,920
Speaker 7:  Like I really think it's gonna be for outdoor use that you really see the

265
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,000
Speaker 7:  difference. And I just, you know, there's fricking street lights on every

266
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,580
Speaker 7:  corner in New York. It's not

267
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,560
Speaker 2:  And no apple standard, apple watch owner is ever outside in the dark. No,

268
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,120
Speaker 2:  never

269
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,000
Speaker 5:  Happens. Never. I've never, never been outside in the dark. Like that was

270
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,440
Speaker 5:  the thing that kind of bumped me about about it was like, oh, I would use

271
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,360
Speaker 5:  that constantly because when I'm trying to, like, I wear my watch a

272
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,880
Speaker 5:  lot of times when I'm sleeping and the, the normal

273
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,520
Speaker 5:  modes are all too bright, like I've tried setting up a dark red and it's

274
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,000
Speaker 5:  just, this seems much better.

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,120
Speaker 2:  What's fascinating about this is it's not a feature of the watch. It is a

276
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,870
Speaker 2:  feature of the watch face.

277
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,660
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

278
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,480
Speaker 2:  And you have to like, none of the other watch faces inherit this

279
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,040
Speaker 2:  mode. Right. Which is weird for this watch. You think they could just sort

280
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,680
Speaker 2:  of add it to everything, but it's just this one watch face, which you could

281
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,600
Speaker 2:  theoretically just bring to the other apple watches. Right. But

282
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,560
Speaker 2:  apple actually restricts watch face creation on the

283
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,360
Speaker 2:  apple washer. Some mystifying reason.

284
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,940
Speaker 5:  There's a color that I have the stainless steel gold watch.

285
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,440
Speaker 5:  And so I have a gold color, but I'm only allowed to use it on this

286
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,240
Speaker 5:  watch. Not any of the other watches I might have. And only in certain

287
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,200
Speaker 5:  watch faces other watch faces. It's like, no, you don't get gold. You can

288
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,760
Speaker 5:  get brown or you can get yellow. Yeah.

289
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,160
Speaker 2:  It's

290
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,630
Speaker 5:  Just the restrictions on watch faces is super weird at this point.

291
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then they opened up the Nike watch faces to all the watches this

292
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,280
Speaker 2:  time. Yeah.

293
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,050
Speaker 5:  And the IME ones as well,

294
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,440
Speaker 2:  Looking at the IME, that's the one that like there's ones that I would

295
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
Speaker 2:  understand. Yeah. Like IES one is like, yeah, you gotta

296
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,520
Speaker 2:  buy one. You

297
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,790
Speaker 5:  Gotta spin the money.

298
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,720
Speaker 2:  Like, yeah. I can put a Gucci logo wallpaper on my phone

299
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,560
Speaker 2:  whenever I want. Like, I can be

300
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,280
Speaker 2:  that guy. Yeah. I'm a 40 year old Indian man. I can put a Gucci logo

301
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,240
Speaker 2:  wallpaper on my phone whenever I want it's in character. But

302
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,040
Speaker 2:  I just like, but it doesn't make it a Gucci phone kind of does. Whereas I

303
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,000
Speaker 2:  think like that, that makes sense with the it's weird, like what they allow

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,920
Speaker 2:  and what they, I think it just comes down to how they think about it as a

305
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,800
Speaker 2:  fashion object, as much as a, a tech object and

306
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,440
Speaker 2:  that dynamic is back and forth and it never really, it

307
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,250
Speaker 2:  hasn't really landed on in a thing that you can understand.

308
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,480
Speaker 6:  No, it's in that messy middle of like, they want to give you more stuff to

309
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,960
Speaker 6:  do, but not so much that you can make it ugly. It's like we talked about

310
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,800
Speaker 6:  this with the, the iOS 16 lock screens, to some extent almost right.

311
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,040
Speaker 6:  It's like they're caught between wanting people to customize things so that

312
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,400
Speaker 6:  they like them and doing things that are like aesthetically pleasing to the

313
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,880
Speaker 6:  12 designers at apple who make these things. And those two things turn out

314
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,230
Speaker 6:  to be further apart, I think, than they get credit for sometimes.

315
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,360
Speaker 2:  Yeah. He's just, but there's a spreadsheet somewhere like Tim cook has an

316
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,410
Speaker 2:  Excel spreadsheet. He has mini on files on his iPad

317
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,350
Speaker 5:  Is so many,

318
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,870
Speaker 2:  It's very confusing situation for him.

319
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,800
Speaker 2:  That's like a model of, if we allow everyone

320
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,680
Speaker 2:  to use the Imez apple watch, watch face, this is how many

321
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,240
Speaker 2:  fewer Imez apple watches. We, we will

322
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
Speaker 2:  sell from

323
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,920
Speaker 6:  Two, five.

324
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,570
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Someone has done that. Math

325
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,280
Speaker 5:  To me now only 10 people are buying it. Yeah.

326
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,120
Speaker 2:  Right. And then they've made that decision. And then at the same time they've

327
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,560
Speaker 2:  made a decision. That's like, if we let other people turn their watch faces

328
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,280
Speaker 2:  red, we will not sell apple. Watch ultras. Like apple is an

329
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,780
Speaker 2:  instinctual and you know, somewhat, somewhat, emotionally driven company,

330
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,880
Speaker 2:  but it's also a company that's run by Tim cook. And there's definitely a

331
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,560
Speaker 2:  spreadsheet in files app on an iPad somewhere. Yes. That's like, how do we

332
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,480
Speaker 2:  restrict some features to SEL more watches? And it's weird that the

333
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,400
Speaker 2:  extremely high end luxury watch face is like, screw it. Everyone can

334
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,570
Speaker 2:  have it. And the it's red is like,

335
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,910
Speaker 5:  No, no, you gotta pay for that.

336
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,720
Speaker 6:  I think that probably says a lot about what apple thinks sells

337
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,480
Speaker 6:  apple watches. Like I think, I think you could make a pretty strong case

338
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,040
Speaker 6:  that a lot more people want a red face than want on Herme face and are willing

339
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,720
Speaker 6:  to pay extra money for it at this point in the life of the apple

340
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,000
Speaker 6:  watch. But then the, the Nike one is a good example, right. Where that has

341
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,360
Speaker 6:  become so much like a sort of

342
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,640
Speaker 6:  mainstream piece of what people do with the apple watch that having like

343
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,550
Speaker 6:  a separate thing that is the Nike apple watch, I think stopped making sense

344
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,510
Speaker 6:  a long time ago. So actually bringing that to everybody tracks,

345
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,480
Speaker 7:  I think the, the red face is also just kind of like,

346
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,320
Speaker 7:  not only from like a fashion standpoint, it's to encourage athletes

347
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,230
Speaker 7:  who are like somewhere between middle intermediate, who

348
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,000
Speaker 7:  aspire to be, I don't know, DC Rainmaker are thinking of,

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,960
Speaker 7:  because the compass features like backtrack and Waypoint go all the way back

350
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,750
Speaker 7:  to the series six and you can even get them on the se. So there's like

351
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,480
Speaker 7:  a reason for athletes to actually save some money

352
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,080
Speaker 7:  and not go for the ultra because they have those features. So if you really

353
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,760
Speaker 7:  want people to get the ultra, you have to kind of limit

354
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,590
Speaker 7:  this red mode.

355
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,840
Speaker 5:  You're saying it's for nerds. You're saying it's for gadget

356
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,680
Speaker 5:  nerds who wanna be athletic, but don't really wanna be

357
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,600
Speaker 5:  athletic. Yes. Which is true. Like that's me that's I really want that red

358
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,120
Speaker 5:  face. I want it so bad, but go, I also see you're on

359
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,280
Speaker 2:  This spreadsheet. I know you're

360
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,630
Speaker 5:  One

361
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,160
Speaker 2:  Column of this spreadsheet. Just me things Alex will buy, how do we get

362
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
Speaker 2:  crayons dot XLS? It's

363
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,280
Speaker 6:  A long

364
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,840
Speaker 5:  Column. I'm one of those nerds that like, I, I want it because it seems like

365
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,800
Speaker 5:  a cool gadget feature, but I, I don't necessarily wanna pay $800 for

366
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,240
Speaker 5:  it and also have an iPhone on my wrist. Yeah. Or fig Newton, excuse

367
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,520
Speaker 5:  me.

368
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,560
Speaker 2:  Let's talk about those features. So, I mean, that's like the bulk of what

369
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,600
Speaker 2:  you reviewed. Right? They added all these sort of extreme sport features.

370
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,170
Speaker 2:  Even the you're supposed to pick when you buy it, which of the three bands

371
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,720
Speaker 2:  is the extreme adventure that you are in your soul. Right. Are you an ocean?

372
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,120
Speaker 2:  It's

373
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
Speaker 6:  Literally a choose your character in a video case.

374
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,000
Speaker 2:  Yes. Very much. It's like which Voltron lion are you? Are you the volcano

375
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,520
Speaker 2:  lion? Are you the ocean lion? Are you the forest

376
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,550
Speaker 2:  lion? I dunno their names.

377
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,150
Speaker 5:  You're the Alpine, right?

378
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I I'm. I think I'm the, well, I mean, in my heart, I'm the black

379
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,440
Speaker 2:  lion

380
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,150
Speaker 2:  don't need

381
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,030
Speaker 6:  That any further there.

382
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,840
Speaker 2:  Just

383
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,230
Speaker 6:  Leave that right there.

384
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,100
Speaker 2:  That's great. We can end the show here. No further analysis. So,

385
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,520
Speaker 2:  but I think in terms of the apple watch, apple thinks I'm the green

386
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,190
Speaker 2:  lion. So,

387
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,160
Speaker 7:  Well, it also thinks I'm the green lion, but I'm the runner lion. So I

388
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,640
Speaker 7:  was just kind of like, oh, I wanted the trail loop. Yeah. That's the one

389
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,520
Speaker 7:  I wanted. But you gave me the other two that I didn't want. And I understand

390
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,270
Speaker 7:  why, cuz those two are much more visually engaging, but

391
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Right. But, but that, but you're supposed to like pick like what, who

392
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,680
Speaker 2:  are you? And you like buy one? I, I immediately put my regular apple

393
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
Speaker 2:  watchband on the thing. It

394
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,360
Speaker 6:  Was fine. I just wanna say, I like it much better the other way where it's

395
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,120
Speaker 6:  like the sorting hat in Harry Potter, where like you go into an apple store

396
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,790
Speaker 6:  and you say, I would like an ultra. And like someone at apple decides

397
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,480
Speaker 6:  what kind of adventure you

398
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,160
Speaker 2:  Are. Yeah. Serious, like serious. Like all we're doing some

399
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,080
Speaker 2:  on device processing to figure out who you are. Did

400
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,400
Speaker 2:  you know? You loved the ocean. Yeah. Here you go. Like,

401
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,840
Speaker 6:  I love to run. And it's like, no, you don't. You'll never run

402
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,150
Speaker 6:  again.

403
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,100
Speaker 7:  I gotta say I wanted the trail loop because it is

404
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,070
Speaker 7:  the lightest thing that I have ever picked up as far as like

405
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,840
Speaker 7:  straps go. And in my head, I was like, okay, they're gonna give me the trail

406
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,740
Speaker 7:  loop. All I ever talk about is running. I'm insufferable about running.

407
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,520
Speaker 7:  And this is a big boy watch and I am a small girl. So

408
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Speaker 7:  they're gonna give me the thing. That's gonna trick me into thinking that

409
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,240
Speaker 7:  this is lighter and better than it is. And I opened it up. I was like, I

410
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,720
Speaker 7:  got the orange one. Okay. I'm a

411
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,880
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Cuz you live in the mountains now I'm

412
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,030
Speaker 7:  A bio hazard. That's fine.

413
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,160
Speaker 2:  This is very bright. So let's talk about those modes. So like that's the

414
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,200
Speaker 2:  point of the watch down to like, here's what you can buy it with. It just

415
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,860
Speaker 2:  seems like your review of it was Apple's taking some baby steps,

416
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,540
Speaker 2:  but the garments of the world are safe for now.

417
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,360
Speaker 7:  Yes, absolutely. So I think the biggest emission is

418
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,070
Speaker 7:  the fact that, you know, they're saying explorers, adventurers,

419
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,720
Speaker 7:  this is the watch for you, but we won't give you offline maps or turn by

420
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,560
Speaker 7:  turn navigation. And it's sort of

421
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,100
Speaker 7:  like, Okay,

422
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,960
Speaker 7:  but why? Like I went to a mountain to like test out

423
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,920
Speaker 7:  the compass features over the weekend. And it was very much like me

424
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,680
Speaker 7:  and my buddies had zero cell signal and we had to

425
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Speaker 7:  rely on a combination of the ultras

426
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,560
Speaker 7:  backtrack and the horrible Google maps that wouldn't

427
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,160
Speaker 7:  load and the horrible offline maps that just didn't make sense whatsoever

428
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,080
Speaker 7:  because trail maps never make sense when you look at them. And I was like,

429
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,200
Speaker 7:  oh, you know, if I had a garment, I could just condense all of that into

430
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,160
Speaker 7:  the garment and be fine and have turned by turn navigation. So

431
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,030
Speaker 7:  it would tell me where the F I'm supposed to go. This was just like,

432
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,400
Speaker 7:  I don't know, praying to the gods a little bit. And I was very happy that

433
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,160
Speaker 7:  I had backtrack on because they actually closed one of the gates that you

434
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,000
Speaker 7:  passed through early. So my friends and I were actually kind of stranded

435
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,960
Speaker 7:  and like we have to find an alternate route and we are not good at

436
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,880
Speaker 7:  this. So let's just use a combination of this and

437
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,600
Speaker 7:  look to find a way back to the part where it meets again. So that

438
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,150
Speaker 7:  was, I was really happy to have that. And I write that in my review, but

439
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,960
Speaker 7:  it's just baffling to me that you don't have offline

440
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,760
Speaker 7:  maps or turn by turn navigation, which is basically what puts garment

441
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,200
Speaker 7:  on the map for trail runners and hikers. So that's

442
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,000
Speaker 7:  omission number one that I'm baffled by. Yeah. And then what,

443
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,840
Speaker 6:  And it kind of seems like there's one of those in every category

444
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,600
Speaker 6:  apple is trying to do here. And this is like the thing I kept coming away

445
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,480
Speaker 6:  with from reading your review is basically like apple gets sort

446
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,840
Speaker 6:  of 60% of the way there with a bunch of different things, but never

447
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,000
Speaker 6:  fully completes the job. Like I've talked to a couple of people who are furious

448
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,920
Speaker 6:  that there's no recovery metrics in the, the workout stuff. And that's

449
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,280
Speaker 6:  a huge problem. And it's like for a giant number of people that is an instant

450
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,120
Speaker 6:  deal breaker. And it just feels like the list of those is long enough that

451
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,440
Speaker 6:  you kind of get to the end and it's like, is there anyone for whom this is

452
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,510
Speaker 6:  like actually correctly designed?

453
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I really do think it's for weekend warriors and it's for

454
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,960
Speaker 7:  intermediate people who are making the leap. So like an

455
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,560
Speaker 7:  example, again, running that I would give is someone who is very comfortable

456
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,360
Speaker 7:  running a 10 K probably has a half marathon under their belt and

457
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,880
Speaker 7:  is like looking at the, which we call it the

458
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,560
Speaker 7:  full marathon and going like, Hmm. Like that level

459
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,320
Speaker 7:  of person I think is who this is for, because you

460
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,850
Speaker 7:  don't want necessarily the garment like deluge

461
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,760
Speaker 7:  of clunky interface and 70,000 charts

462
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,160
Speaker 7:  and maps that you have to kind of sit and read what they mean. That type

463
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,920
Speaker 7:  of person, this is gonna be easier for you just because it's,

464
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,760
Speaker 7:  it's just, it just is. And then there are people who really like Excel

465
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,680
Speaker 7:  spreadsheets and tracking all of that stuff on their own. And then on top

466
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,560
Speaker 7:  of that just want, they don't wanna make a compromise between

467
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,480
Speaker 7:  a fitness watch and a smart watch. Right? So they're looking for, like,

468
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,400
Speaker 7:  I have seen readers comment on my reviews. Like God

469
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,160
Speaker 7:  I'm thinking of ditch and garment because I just need something that's smarter

470
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,920
Speaker 7:  because they're not out every single day doing

471
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,760
Speaker 7:  three hours of exercise. They're, they're backpacking on a weekend.

472
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,420
Speaker 7:  Those are the people who this is gonna be really great for.

473
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,080
Speaker 7:  But if you have people who are like, this is my 50th marathon, I

474
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,800
Speaker 7:  take training super seriously. Right. And if I'm a woman, I train

475
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,440
Speaker 7:  based on my cycle, like there are those athletes out there. This is not gonna

476
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,360
Speaker 7:  be enough for you. You need those recovery metrics. You need to understand

477
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,960
Speaker 7:  like where your, your physical strain is at. And you know, like

478
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,680
Speaker 7:  those recovery metrics are kind of, let's just say, take the accuracy with

479
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,600
Speaker 7:  the grain of salt, but those are the people who this is just not

480
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,440
Speaker 7:  gonna do enough for. So it's just a really

481
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,360
Speaker 7:  interesting, it's just interesting. And I, I attribute a lot of that to the

482
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,400
Speaker 7:  fact that this is their first attempt. I really think Darin should be like,

483
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,280
Speaker 7:  Ooh, we're cool for now next year. I think, I think it would be a

484
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,780
Speaker 7:  mistake for them not to see what Apple's doing and start

485
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,160
Speaker 7:  brainstorming. If they're not brainstorming, that's, that's a huge mistake.

486
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,480
Speaker 7:  But right now they're like, we're fine. Like that's how I

487
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,270
Speaker 7:  feel.

488
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,520
Speaker 5:  I just really wanna go back to, you said one of the, kind of the core audience

489
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,200
Speaker 5:  members for this is someone who really

490
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,120
Speaker 5:  loves spreadsheets and also really just

491
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,470
Speaker 5:  wants a watch. That looks nice. So is that just Tim cook?

492
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,000
Speaker 6:  That's literally just Tim cook.

493
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,320
Speaker 2:  That's

494
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,080
Speaker 5:  Just cook. Yeah. That's I love that. I love that. Tim's

495
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,840
Speaker 2:  Like, wait, no, I didn't. You mean people who train with spreadsheets?

496
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,080
Speaker 2:  Maybe

497
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,720
Speaker 5:  He does. He has spreadsheets for everything. I absolutely believe Tim has

498
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,670
Speaker 5:  a spreadsheet for his exercise workout. Like his exercise routine.

499
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,500
Speaker 2:  I tweeted a poll the other day to just because the thought came to me that

500
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,360
Speaker 2:  all the current tech CEOs have to be spreadsheet masterminds. Cuz they're

501
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,240
Speaker 2:  all. I mean just like look at 'em. Yeah. And I was like, who's the best

502
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,120
Speaker 2:  Excel power user. Is it cook Nadella, Piche or

503
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,000
Speaker 2:  Jeff Bezos. Who's no longer the CEO of Amazon, but you gotta put 'em on the

504
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,240
Speaker 2:  list and people like pick Nadella. Cause he runs Microsoft and I'm like,

505
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,310
Speaker 2:  no dude, it's Tim cook.

506
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,200
Speaker 5:  It's Tim cook.

507
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,640
Speaker 7:  It's cook. He's also

508
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,360
Speaker 2:  It's 1000%. He

509
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,720
Speaker 5:  Has never used numbers in his life.

510
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,520
Speaker 2:  He, Tim cook looks at numbers and he is like, get this out my face. He's

511
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:36,600
Speaker 2:  like,

512
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,120
Speaker 5:  How dare

513
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,530
Speaker 2:  He's

514
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,960
Speaker 6:  He like opens Excel and immediately just like pushes his mouse away. And

515
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,630
Speaker 6:  he's like, I will not be needing this.

516
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,520
Speaker 2:  He's got like the external number head on his, his hands go into

517
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,160
Speaker 2:  straight like sideways macro mode. Do you think he, Tim cook like

518
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,520
Speaker 2:  watches the Excel world championships? Yes.

519
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,200
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent.

520
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,800
Speaker 2:  Yeah man. You know when I was a code, I asked him this like big thinky question

521
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,720
Speaker 2:  about like whether the phone is, you know, like partially to blame for

522
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,110
Speaker 2:  social media, you know like philosophical. And he was like, no, we're fine.

523
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,480
Speaker 2:  I should have been like, do you watch the Excel world champ?

524
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,110
Speaker 6:  Who do you thinks gonna win this year, Tim?

525
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,120
Speaker 2:  Like, it's like you and me buddy. I know Johnny's here, but like you and

526
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,980
Speaker 2:  me eye to eye, he's super in it. He's streaming that shit.

527
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,520
Speaker 2:  And the next time I see him, 100% asking if he

528
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,150
Speaker 2:  watches the Excel world champ. I don't care where my career goes after that.

529
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,960
Speaker 2:  I just need to know the answer. But wait, the, you met people who train with

530
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,520
Speaker 2:  spreadsheets, right? Yeah. Like the people who play video games with

531
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,080
Speaker 7:  Spreadsheets. Yes. I, I know several of them. I am sometimes one of them,

532
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,720
Speaker 7:  myself. I go back and forth. It's it's just too. I have a whole

533
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,350
Speaker 7:  notion page with training info on there. It's sad.

534
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,000
Speaker 7:  Like I'm embarrassed for myself right now admitting it, but

535
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,880
Speaker 2:  Right. But then the garment can like send you CSV data. Right?

536
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,930
Speaker 2:  And the apple watch is just not built to do that.

537
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,920
Speaker 7:  So when I do my testing and I do comparisons, I'm old school

538
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,740
Speaker 7:  and I go spreadsheet, but I know there are smarter ways to do that

539
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,640
Speaker 7:  and to like export all your fitness data. So I'm not

540
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,360
Speaker 7:  the person to ask for that just because I like to be really, really hands

541
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,080
Speaker 7:  on with the data when I'm comparing and I'm anal retentive about the

542
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,190
Speaker 7:  columns and how they look, oh God, this is so embarrassing. But yeah,

543
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,010
Speaker 5:  That's

544
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,120
Speaker 2:  Welcome. This is fine. This is, this is normal. This is where you be. Are

545
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,000
Speaker 2:  your people?

546
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,720
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So like I just have a spreadsheet at home and it is psychotic looking

547
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,470
Speaker 7:  just like percent of change accuracy. And it doesn't,

548
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,220
Speaker 7:  I realized a long time ago that no one wants to read that in the review,

549
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,960
Speaker 7:  but for us assured I'm doing it and I've been doing it for

550
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,430
Speaker 7:  years.

551
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,440
Speaker 5:  I mean, people wanna read that there's an audience. You,

552
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,320
Speaker 7:  You don't wanna read like, okay. So on four different runs, it was off by

553
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,830
Speaker 7:  negative 0.2%. Like as these get more accurate, it gets

554
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,720
Speaker 7:  less relevant. That's the thing like six years ago when I was doing

555
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,480
Speaker 7:  it, I was like, the LG watch sport was super accurate.

556
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,200
Speaker 7:  And this LG watch style was off by zero point, like

557
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,920
Speaker 7:  2% and it's awful. And it was color coded and everything is so

558
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,760
Speaker 7:  sad. But yeah, like accuracy, it's

559
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,600
Speaker 7:  really interesting because accuracy and wearables is less relevant than

560
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,480
Speaker 7:  consistency. It it's just a thing that I came to after a long

561
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,280
Speaker 7:  time. You're if you're consistently inaccurate by the same margin, you can

562
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,660
Speaker 7:  still track your progress.

563
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,250
Speaker 2:  And the progress is the thing that matters most presumably. Yeah. Yeah.

564
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,200
Speaker 2:  So it just seems like Garin has this advantage, right? Cuz it right now can

565
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,990
Speaker 2:  do more. It's got more metrics for fitness. It has offline

566
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,880
Speaker 2:  maps. It's built to be worn for the task, right? It's like task

567
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,600
Speaker 2:  specific in a way that wearing a garment is a general purpose. Smartwatch

568
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,560
Speaker 2:  doesn't really make any sense. Apple's bridging the gap. Do they have

569
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,360
Speaker 2:  to do more on the general purpose, smartwatch side? Or is it when you

570
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,080
Speaker 2:  push the button and turn on the I'm hiking mode or the I'm diving

571
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,520
Speaker 2:  the ocean mode, it needs to do more there to compete with those specialized

572
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:50,960
Speaker 2:  devices.

573
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,280
Speaker 7:  It needs to think a little bit harder about design in some, in some ways.

574
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,230
Speaker 7:  So like I love the action button, but the action button was built by

575
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,880
Speaker 7:  a general use company trying to pull in specialized people.

576
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Speaker 7:  But the more I think about the action button, they left out a huge thing

577
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,440
Speaker 7:  with the action button here too, is that a lot of athletes use

578
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,160
Speaker 7:  physical controls to swipe through screens. And you would think that that

579
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,370
Speaker 7:  would be the case with the action button, but it's not, it's all like pause.

580
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,280
Speaker 7:  So like it's great. They thought about really hard about how to make a

581
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,070
Speaker 7:  more intuitive way to pause with physical controls, but they forgot

582
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,400
Speaker 7:  a more intuitive way to use buttons to scroll through

583
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,280
Speaker 7:  menus. Now that's something that, you know, everyone who uses a

584
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,450
Speaker 7:  garment is super used to. It's something they love. It

585
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,160
Speaker 7:  ensures with like, no doubt that if you wear

586
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,920
Speaker 7:  gloves, if your fingers are sweaty, if you're in the elements that you can

587
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,840
Speaker 7:  scroll to the menu that you need. So with apple, they added

588
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,320
Speaker 7:  the workout views, which freaking great. I love the new workout views, but

589
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,900
Speaker 7:  you're still having to scroll with the digital crown in order to view them

590
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,880
Speaker 7:  mid exercise. And that's just, I end up having to take like a

591
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,480
Speaker 7:  short walk break sometimes to, to scroll through it. And the digital crown

592
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,360
Speaker 7:  is bigger. It has grooves. It's more tactile. That's great. But it's not

593
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,880
Speaker 7:  the same thing as being able to press a button and scroll through your menus.

594
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,640
Speaker 7:  And I think that's a, that's a bit of a

595
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,360
Speaker 2:  Whiff. Would you say the digital crown is an input device on par with

596
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,280
Speaker 2:  the mouse and multi touch and

597
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,030
Speaker 2:  the multi-touch display. Yeah.

598
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,880
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Wow. It's just like, don't get me wrong. I

599
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,300
Speaker 7:  don't know

600
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,790
Speaker 8:  You, would you say it's as big a deal as, as the mouse

601
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,410
Speaker 2:  It's revolutionary?

602
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,320
Speaker 7:  No, I misunderstood what you were saying.

603
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,280
Speaker 2:  Cause I'm just saying when apple introduced digital crown, they were like

604
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,890
Speaker 2:  the mouse.

605
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,200
Speaker 7:  Oh no. In multitask. No,

606
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,810
Speaker 2:  No I, and now the digital crown,

607
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,680
Speaker 7:  No, I totally misunderstood. Is the action button there. The action

608
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,080
Speaker 7:  button is not there yet. I actually think the action button should be on

609
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,590
Speaker 7:  every single apple watch it shouldn't just be on the ultra, but

610
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,560
Speaker 7:  it's like David said, it's I wanna say 70% of the way there.

611
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,600
Speaker 7:  I'm super excited that there's a third physical control, which makes things

612
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,480
Speaker 7:  more accessible. But like keeping, it feels

613
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,440
Speaker 7:  like they were saying, you still have to use this digital crown. We made

614
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,020
Speaker 7:  grooves. So it's easier and more tactile for you to use, but really

615
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,600
Speaker 7:  cuz they want it to be the mouse. Cause they want that just the mouse of

616
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,270
Speaker 7:  the watch. But if you really listen to what athletes have been saying

617
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,200
Speaker 7:  online, and I've just been like going through all the comments and questions

618
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,160
Speaker 7:  and opinions, it's just, they wanted a button so that they could scroll

619
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,460
Speaker 7:  through stuff and they don't have it. Aw.

620
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,020
Speaker 2:  I'm shocked that you can't just assign it to open an app on the phone.

621
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,800
Speaker 6:  Yes. This is what I was gonna say. It's so nuts that it's not more customizable.

622
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

623
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,240
Speaker 2:  You can pick like what six things, five things be like the, and it's apples

624
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,910
Speaker 7:  List, apples list.

625
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,640
Speaker 2:  It's like, you can turn on the it's like the stopwatch, the flashlight and

626
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,440
Speaker 2:  the workout app are

627
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,360
Speaker 7:  What you can do and dive and shortcuts, which, you know, shortcuts are so

628
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,280
Speaker 7:  clunky to program. But so you can do things like if

629
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,200
Speaker 7:  you're willing to go through the whole shortcuts app nonsense,

630
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,080
Speaker 7:  you can like press a button and it'll notify people at your next meeting

631
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,690
Speaker 7:  that you're running late. That's cool. Do much work for me.

632
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,360
Speaker 7:  It would be great if you could do other things. And I think that's coming,

633
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,280
Speaker 7:  you know, cuz there, there are certain, like I just wrote a how to on the

634
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,080
Speaker 7:  action button and there are certain settings in there that make me believe

635
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,680
Speaker 7:  that you'll be able to choose which app it triggers eventually. Oh interesting.

636
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,560
Speaker 7:  But I don't think like right now, like you go to the workout app, there's

637
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,920
Speaker 7:  a little button that says app and you press it. And it's the native workout

638
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,800
Speaker 7:  app. Cause none of the other developers have developed for this yet.

639
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,520
Speaker 7:  But I think in the future they will be. And that'll add some

640
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,040
Speaker 7:  customizability, but right now you have your choice between what apple says

641
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,920
Speaker 7:  you can choose. Like why won't you let me start a timer. Yeah. I

642
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,260
Speaker 7:  would love to start a talking with the action button. Right?

643
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,960
Speaker 2:  Why can't I open the home app or the remote app for the apple?

644
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,480
Speaker 2:  This is, you can tell where I used it. Yeah. Like these, like I make

645
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,200
Speaker 2:  spreadsheets down to the per like half a percent on how consistent the watches

646
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,080
Speaker 2:  are. And I'm like, I'd like to pause the TV. It's very important. Give me

647
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,880
Speaker 2:  the button that I can pause the TV with. I use my apple watch for two

648
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,240
Speaker 2:  factor off like important. Maybe anything. Let me just open

649
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,040
Speaker 2:  authenticator app. Like let me just do it. Why not? You know

650
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,960
Speaker 2:  like it's, that's like the one where you can see how you have to build

651
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,520
Speaker 2:  the entire system of APIs and hooks and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. For

652
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,480
Speaker 2:  to fully enable it to be customized, but open arbitrary app.

653
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,840
Speaker 2:  I don't think you need to do much work to do it's baffling that they missed

654
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,360
Speaker 2:  that. But you can get there by writing a shortcut. No,

655
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,520
Speaker 2:  which shortcuts totally back

656
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,440
Speaker 6:  Shortcut is an answer to nothing. And there, there will come a time on this

657
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,000
Speaker 6:  podcast where I'm feeling spicy and give you like a 65 minute long rant

658
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,640
Speaker 2:  About I'm setting up the shortcut that notifies you, that you're doing a

659
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,230
Speaker 2:  bad job. And if I push the she's like text David like

660
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,160
Speaker 2:  work a little, little harder buddy, just

661
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,920
Speaker 6:  Like one second. No it's my overwhelming theory about shortcuts. Is

662
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,670
Speaker 6:  that shortcuts.

663
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,360
Speaker 5:  Please do it. Spa it

664
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,840
Speaker 5:  tearing the podcast is

665
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,310
Speaker 6:  You blew

666
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,300
Speaker 2:  Just like

667
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,080
Speaker 6:  You blew it. Yeah, no I'm I'm that's

668
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,320
Speaker 6:  the only good shortcuts idea I've ever heard in my entire life is my point

669
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,720
Speaker 6:  about shortcuts. Shortcuts is a terrible idea. And apple claims

670
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,240
Speaker 6:  it. Everything you don't like about all of your apple devices,

671
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,680
Speaker 6:  Apple's like, oh shortcuts. And that is not an answer to any of it

672
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,960
Speaker 6:  because it shortcuts is a terrible idea.

673
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,120
Speaker 5:  Either. Like just become a developer, but like not

674
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,150
Speaker 2:  Like a good one,

675
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,520
Speaker 5:  Like not a good developer, but just develop, come

676
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,840
Speaker 2:  On. And then there's like, there's a weird, especially in a watch, shortcuts

677
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,760
Speaker 2:  are particularly slow. So the shortcut you set up to open the app is

678
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,130
Speaker 2:  like, you might as well just open the app.

679
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,840
Speaker 7:  So there's a really funny thing cuz I was trying out every

680
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,520
Speaker 7:  single possible use case for the action button. And so I, I

681
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,440
Speaker 7:  dabbled with the shortcuts and I immediately remembered why I don't

682
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,080
Speaker 7:  normally, but you press shortcuts and you select which shortcuts you want.

683
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,940
Speaker 7:  There is one that says, quote, what is a shortcut? And

684
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,880
Speaker 7:  you can set the action button. Yeah.

685
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,840
Speaker 5:  That's my total one,

686
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,760
Speaker 7:  Something that says what is a shortcut? And then it's like, shortcuts are

687
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,040
Speaker 7:  blah, blah, blah. And here are three that you can try. So like one of them

688
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,600
Speaker 7:  that's

689
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,200
Speaker 6:  Literally Clippy. It's just Clipy

690
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Speaker 7:  There was one of them that was just like, oh turn on theater mode. And I

691
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,560
Speaker 7:  was like, literally, so you want me to press it so that I open something

692
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,460
Speaker 7:  else so I can press something to do theater mode when I can just swipe

693
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,320
Speaker 7:  and hit theater mode. That's that was kind of

694
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,920
Speaker 7:  the, so, but

695
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,760
Speaker 2:  You want the shortcut? That's like, you know, I'm going out to do ocean

696
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,920
Speaker 2:  stuff,

697
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,990
Speaker 5:  Ocean stuff, me up watch.

698
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:29,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And like, I gotta put my boat in

699
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,120
Speaker 2:  like lockdown mode and I've put all these smart home accessories in my

700
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,760
Speaker 2:  boat and right. As I dive elegantly into the

701
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,680
Speaker 2:  water, I reach over and click and then like all the shades and the

702
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,150
Speaker 2:  boat,

703
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,650
Speaker 5:  A very nice boat

704
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,820
Speaker 2:  In my calling music place.

705
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,240
Speaker 5:  See

706
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,280
Speaker 7:  That's the tech nerd side of it

707
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,790
Speaker 5:  Just

708
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,120
Speaker 2:  That's that's like the far expanse of what you want the shortcut for.

709
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,520
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I don't, you know, I don't know. I don't know that that's true. There's

710
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,480
Speaker 7:  a dive. The dive point is a lot more practical where

711
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,090
Speaker 7:  you press it and it starts your dive for you. You know which

712
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,200
Speaker 2:  No, but yeah, we just add that into the shortcut. Yeah. That's just part

713
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,040
Speaker 2:  of it. So you're like mid dive and you're like, shit, I forgot to prepare

714
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,830
Speaker 2:  for this. I'm already in the air. Kenny

715
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,990
Speaker 6:  G isn't playing yet.

716
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I gotta hit the button. It starts dive mode on the

717
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,240
Speaker 2:  watch. It lights up the underwater speakers. It closes all the shades.

718
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,370
Speaker 2:  It probably turns down your thermostat.

719
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,070
Speaker 5:  It sets the timer to contact help. If you don't appear,

720
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,560
Speaker 2:  I don't know why this isn't in the ads. Why are they crashing cars? They

721
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,790
Speaker 2:  could be doing jazz ocean,

722
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,560
Speaker 7:  Zero people from the, the audience that they aspire

723
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,400
Speaker 7:  to buy this watch would buy this. Like, I mean,

724
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,160
Speaker 7:  when you like, you probably like NELA, you know this

725
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,850
Speaker 5:  Victoria's just like, absolutely not ne

726
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,830
Speaker 7:  No,

727
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,150
Speaker 5:  Your boat is not a thing.

728
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,920
Speaker 7:  It's like when you open the ultra box, we both got the hiking

729
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,760
Speaker 7:  version. Yeah. But you, you like open the box and there's pictures of

730
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,360
Speaker 7:  mountains on there and it's like, haha, you are a hiker

731
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,280
Speaker 7:  now. And I, I was looking at it. I was like, wow, this is extra. But

732
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,000
Speaker 7:  the people who are buying this are like, yes, I am a mountain year. No Mountaineer

733
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,870
Speaker 7:  is going, let me press this shortcut that

734
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,800
Speaker 7:  does this nonsense. That's super techy and nerdy. They're like,

735
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,240
Speaker 7:  oh, let me press this. Yeah, well,

736
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,200
Speaker 5:  No, the hiking one would lock your BMW that you've already cared with

737
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,920
Speaker 5:  your watch because it's ridiculous if you own a BMW because that's the hiker

738
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,450
Speaker 5:  that buys this. Yeah,

739
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,120
Speaker 7:  No it

740
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,800
Speaker 6:  Pops the tent on top of your Subaru. Yeah.

741
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,320
Speaker 2:  That one that one's like running a command team.

742
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Speaker 5:  Subaru owners, student will never own an Applera.

743
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,680
Speaker 2:  I what's the connectivity situation on Subarus these days. Real good

744
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,080
Speaker 2:  Vergecast question right there. Real

745
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,830
Speaker 5:  Bad

746
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,720
Speaker 2:  Students have Bluetooth. Here's what

747
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,480
Speaker 5:  I'm saying. They got Bluetooth, but they they're still using their own like

748
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,560
Speaker 5:  custom built entertainment system software.

749
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,600
Speaker 5:  That's terrible.

750
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,960
Speaker 2:  Right? So what you want is like, you want like the middleware at your house,

751
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,720
Speaker 2:  that's connected to the like Rivian. So you run the shortcut and it

752
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,560
Speaker 2:  like locks your Rivian doors. Right. And like puts it into the, no, the

753
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,080
Speaker 2:  Rivian itself of these air suspension rooms. And

754
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,480
Speaker 5:  Like, this is where your hike is started. No, we'll call the cops if you're

755
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,520
Speaker 5:  not

756
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,200
Speaker 2:  Backing. And then the Rivian like auto drives itself to the bottom of the

757
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,040
Speaker 2:  trail. Yeah.

758
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,880
Speaker 5:  That's what I want.

759
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,630
Speaker 7:  Y'all are wild, but that is not,

760
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,360
Speaker 6:  I just can't stop hearing do subies have Bluetooth as the title of a

761
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,270
Speaker 6:  children's book that ne is gonna write

762
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:22,880
Speaker 5:  Here's

763
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,680
Speaker 2:  All the parts with Bluetooth do subies have Bluetooth and you

764
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,560
Speaker 2:  unfold. You open the garage. No. And there's like a cross track and it's

765
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,180
Speaker 2:  like, I do.

766
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,810
Speaker 7:  Wow. Okay.

767
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,720
Speaker 2:  Welcome to our show. But it's like this

768
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,040
Speaker 2:  all the

769
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,360
Speaker 7:  Time. See, you guys are a very specialized case. The majority of people who

770
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,050
Speaker 7:  are gonna buy the ultra are not that nerdy.

771
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,040
Speaker 7:  They're nerdy, but don't want to be, they're like going to a hike and

772
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,000
Speaker 7:  they're pressing the, the action button. And they're like, ah, I am disconnected

773
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,960
Speaker 7:  from the world yet. I have this giant honking computer on my wrist. It's

774
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,290
Speaker 7:  that? Like contradiction for the ultra it's.

775
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,180
Speaker 5:  So it's like people who glamp.

776
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,820
Speaker 7:  Yes. It's well, but they glamp.

777
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,710
Speaker 7:  But one level grungier than glamping. If that makes sense.

778
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,200
Speaker 7:  It's

779
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,520
Speaker 6:  People who buy really fancy looking expensive camping.

780
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,160
Speaker 7:  Yes. They buy

781
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,630
Speaker 6:  It's REI customers is basically what we're talking about. So right. Like

782
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,720
Speaker 2:  I was gonna say Yeti.

783
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,840
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's there. Yeti REI. That's me. Patagonia

784
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,220
Speaker 7:  wears

785
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,120
Speaker 2:  See Alex holding up a Yeti right now. And I know that

786
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,600
Speaker 2:  as she dove into the ocean, she would want to lock down her smartphone.

787
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,000
Speaker 5:  I would, I would want my smart boat to just be like, just quiet

788
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,840
Speaker 5:  down.

789
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,920
Speaker 2:  Although Alex's smart boat would immediately start like pirating movies for

790
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,640
Speaker 2:  her smart boat flex.

791
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,400
Speaker 7:  Oh my God. I

792
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,960
Speaker 5:  Would and have its own server. Yeah.

793
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,790
Speaker 2:  She'd be like start background, ripping DVDs.

794
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,600
Speaker 5:  I need the next episode of she holds

795
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,990
Speaker 6:  Stack the underwater Plex projector turns on.

796
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,840
Speaker 2:  That's very good. I, I wanna say we've exhaustively covered

797
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,720
Speaker 2:  the apple watch ultra

798
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,910
Speaker 7:  Battery. We didn't talk battery

799
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,440
Speaker 2:  With this conversation. Oh,

800
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,120
Speaker 6:  Battery. Okay. We should talk about the battery real quick.

801
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,560
Speaker 7:  It's

802
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,360
Speaker 2:  Good. I was not able to kill it. So I went 56 hours before I

803
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,320
Speaker 2:  went like off the charger. Just line around the house. It's a

804
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,000
Speaker 6:  Lot of apple TV, remote usage in 56 hours. I would

805
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
Speaker 6:  assume

806
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,960
Speaker 2:  Furiously Watch. So like that's a horrible test. I was, I don't think it's

807
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,320
Speaker 2:  a basically not using it. It was on my wrist. Hadn't turned on any of the

808
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,030
Speaker 2:  workout modes. Hadn't used cell service, just some wifi. And then

809
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:26,000
Speaker 2:  I was actually gonna go and play golf where the person spotted me and I knew

810
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,240
Speaker 2:  I was gonna use the workout mode. So I was like, I gotta at least get this

811
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,680
Speaker 2:  thing back up. I had gone 56 hours. I was 14%. And I was like, I, I gotta

812
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,160
Speaker 2:  charge it. Cause I know it'll make it through this VU got to like 60

813
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,960
Speaker 7:  Hours. Yeah. Last night I got to 60 hours with no low power

814
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,480
Speaker 7:  mode on always on display on and several workouts,

815
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,160
Speaker 7:  like, well, several workouts, but a lot of them not GPS

816
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,080
Speaker 7:  related just only one of them was. So, you know, they're saying it

817
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,800
Speaker 7:  can get apple is super conservative with its battery estimate.

818
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,160
Speaker 7:  Cuz you know, they've been saying 18 hours for several watches now and it's

819
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,480
Speaker 7:  more than 18 hours. You're gonna get more than eight, 18 hours. So with the

820
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,040
Speaker 7:  ultra, when they said 36 hours, I was like, mm we're gonna get 48. And

821
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,760
Speaker 7:  generally, if you are working out and using cellular, you're gonna get

822
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,720
Speaker 7:  48 with regular usage. If you have a rest or recovery day or if you just

823
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,360
Speaker 7:  don't work out, which of large portion of people who buy this watch are not

824
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,990
Speaker 7:  people who give a dam about the fitness features whatsoever.

825
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,640
Speaker 7:  They care about the battery. Those people, you can get 60

826
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,260
Speaker 7:  hours without a low power mode enabled without

827
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,000
Speaker 7:  the special, further battery optimization feature that's

828
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,960
Speaker 7:  coming. It's it's insane. The battery life on this. When you

829
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,600
Speaker 7:  think about every other apple watch, that's been, it's the first true multi-day

830
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,820
Speaker 7:  battery that it's just multi-day battery. It's great. Yeah.

831
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,760
Speaker 2:  And I was incredibly impressed with it also, you know, it's interesting.

832
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,560
Speaker 2:  We, the last episode we talked about the iPhone always on display and how

833
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,960
Speaker 2:  much I think it is killing my iPhone. 14 pro battery turned

834
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,790
Speaker 5:  It off immediately is terrible.

835
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,960
Speaker 2:  I turned off now the battery like lasts forever. Yeah. This thing has

836
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,840
Speaker 2:  essentially that same always on display. Yeah. And it's just like just

837
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,440
Speaker 2:  cruising. It's obviously much smaller, but it's just cruising along for

838
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,670
Speaker 2:  hours and hours at a time. It's pretty impressive.

839
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,370
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's it's I don't know. Like I feel like an always on display

840
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,360
Speaker 7:  is essential to a watch, but really unnecessary for a phone. That's just

841
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,120
Speaker 7:  how I feel. It's it's interesting cuz I thought I would like it

842
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,320
Speaker 7:  always on display on my phone and I was like, nah, I put it like face down

843
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,600
Speaker 7:  all the time anyway. So I don't need it. And I have a watch. It just makes

844
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,360
Speaker 7:  more sense than a watch.

845
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,340
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

846
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,640
Speaker 5:  How did they test the battery on the watch? Like did they, because on the,

847
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,120
Speaker 5:  on the phone, on the laptop they usually do like a video rundown. Are they

848
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,690
Speaker 5:  just playing a tiny video on the watch? Is that what they do?

849
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,430
Speaker 7:  No, not at all.

850
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,960
Speaker 5:  I just really like the idea

851
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,580
Speaker 7:  Of that. I mean, I, I, in some cases I would like a benchmark

852
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,360
Speaker 7:  for like some sort of test I could run on the, the, on the

853
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,320
Speaker 7:  watch, but it's really, that's not useful to anyone at all. It's just

854
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,960
Speaker 7:  lifestyle usage that the, when you're testing the battery life, you have

855
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,680
Speaker 7:  to do okay. Daily smartwatch usage. Okay. Heavy GPS

856
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,400
Speaker 7:  usage and then heavy cellular. So

857
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,280
Speaker 5:  They average a bunch of different like use cases together after they

858
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,760
Speaker 7:  Get those. Yeah. So like usually when you get that's

859
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,360
Speaker 5:  Much less funny.

860
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,720
Speaker 7:  Well, duh, but when you get smart watch

861
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,440
Speaker 7:  battery estimates, there's usually a little asterisk in the fine print where

862
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,000
Speaker 7:  it's just like with about one hour of GPS usage

863
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,800
Speaker 7:  per day under these settings. And, and so like, that's

864
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,000
Speaker 7:  just generally the, the case for it. But apple, I think they take that and

865
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,960
Speaker 7:  then they like minus five hours from it just to, to cover

866
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,950
Speaker 7:  their butts, which is the exact opposite of what Samsung does. And

867
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,480
Speaker 7:  yeah. So they gave us a bunch of different battery estimates for

868
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,080
Speaker 7:  regular usage for absolute max usage and

869
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,940
Speaker 7:  then absolute max usage with low, with like it was with

870
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,280
Speaker 7:  LTE. That's what it was the low

871
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,570
Speaker 5:  Power. Yeah.

872
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:52,520
Speaker 7:  So it's like, they're saying, if you put low power boat on, you can get 60

873
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,120
Speaker 7:  hours. Well, I got 60 hours without low power mode, so I'm not

874
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,770
Speaker 7:  sure. I don't think there's enough time in the world within one week

875
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:03,640
Speaker 7:  to meet embargo, to see how long this thing would last with low

876
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,740
Speaker 7:  power battery mode on let alone the additional battery

877
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,680
Speaker 7:  optimization setting that's coming. So I, I, I would like

878
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,320
Speaker 7:  some time to just go, how long can I really

879
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,080
Speaker 7:  make this thing last? But that's different from how long can I make it

880
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,760
Speaker 7:  last within a triathlon. So it's supposed to be able to last

881
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,520
Speaker 7:  with low powered mode on an entire iron man, which is about 14 hours.

882
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,160
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So that's impressive, but still not at the level of a

883
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,480
Speaker 7:  course or a garment. That

884
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,660
Speaker 5:  Seems nice.

885
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,560
Speaker 2:  All right. We have take a break. We spent an hour with

886
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,960
Speaker 2:  really smart thoughts from V thank you on the apple watch and then whatever

887
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,170
Speaker 2:  we did,

888
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,310
Speaker 5:  We were also

889
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,680
Speaker 6:  Here's on his boat on

890
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,440
Speaker 2:  Our boat, also participated. I'm just thinking about my extremely

891
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,920
Speaker 2:  beautiful smart boat. That's great that his power entirely my shortcuts,

892
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,580
Speaker 2:  David, you're gonna have Chris Wal Sean to talk about the AirPods pro

893
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,070
Speaker 2:  gen two in some way. Yes.

894
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,820
Speaker 6:  Yeah. We're gonna do a, a deeper dive on that in the next couple weeks.

895
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,680
Speaker 6:  The short version of it seems to be, they are precisely AirPods pro

896
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,120
Speaker 6:  everything is slightly better. Noise cancellation seems to be potentially

897
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,560
Speaker 6:  substantially better, but not as good as the new bows ones, which seem to

898
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,080
Speaker 6:  be ridiculous, but we'll yeah. We'll, we'll get into that in a big way. In

899
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,390
Speaker 6:  a couple weeks, I think.

900
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The surprise hit of our second episode segment has been

901
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,160
Speaker 2:  putting Chris Welch in noisy environments and headphones. So we're just

902
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,790
Speaker 2:  gonna double down on that.

903
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,040
Speaker 6:  Some people really like it. Some people really

904
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,120
Speaker 2:  Hate it. So stay tuned for that. We'll talk more about the AirPods coming

905
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,800
Speaker 2:  up. We gonna take a break. We'll be right

906
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,290
Speaker 2:  back.

907
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,080
Speaker 9:  we're back V sticking with us. Thanks for hanging around V but

908
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,450
Speaker 9:  welcome to Alex. Crane's dark GPU zone.

909
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:25,110
Speaker 9:  Oh,

910
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,000
Speaker 7:  I've been here before. Yeah, you've been here. I've been here before. You've

911
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,760
Speaker 2:  Been here before. That's true. Alex and Victoria used to work together cuz

912
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,750
Speaker 2:  Meto. So she's, I don't know how Crans managed to recruit you

913
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,020
Speaker 2:  back into this situation, but

914
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,800
Speaker 7:  She was always assigning me stuff that I was like, why, why are you doing

915
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,440
Speaker 7:  this? And then she's like, because I know you're gonna have fun.

916
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,570
Speaker 7:  Sorry in advance.

917
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,630
Speaker 9:  So

918
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,230
Speaker 2:  That's great. That's perfect. That really tracks actually.

919
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,200
Speaker 2:  Okay. The reason I called it, the dark GPU zone is Invidia

920
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,000
Speaker 2:  had an event. They announced the RTX 40 90 and the 40, 80.

921
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,480
Speaker 2:  They're huge, et cetera. There's some metaverse stuff we should talk about.

922
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,760
Speaker 2:  Cause I did some metaverse noise in the middle of this keynote. Yeah, but

923
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,720
Speaker 2:  I just gonna, you, this headline, this RTX 40 90 is so ridiculous. It

924
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,600
Speaker 2:  needs a dark Oli RGB support stick. And

925
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,120
Speaker 2:  I purposefully just did not read the rest of that story so I can ask Alex,

926
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,410
Speaker 2:  what is going on?

927
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,960
Speaker 5:  So Nvidia announced they're 40 90, and they're 40, 80, the first of the new

928
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,640
Speaker 5:  40 series. This is the successor to the 30 series itself, the

929
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,560
Speaker 5:  successor to the 20 series, which is when they introduced rate tracing. So

930
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,480
Speaker 5:  like those two previous generations, the 40, 80, and the 40 90 have

931
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,200
Speaker 5:  rate tracing. Great. Like those two previous generations, they're

932
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,000
Speaker 5:  enormous. One of the companies that's making, one of those GPS is

933
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,280
Speaker 5:  GL and they're the ones that really

934
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,790
Speaker 5:  like RGB did up. They've also got like an anonymous

935
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,760
Speaker 5:  hacker thing going on with the, the box. If you look at the box,

936
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,750
Speaker 5:  there's just like a weird dude, like half a mass. So it's like a, some real,

937
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,700
Speaker 5:  real like fan of the opera situation here.

938
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,080
Speaker 2:  Fan milk. The opera. Yeah. It's fan of the opera across with V for vendetta.

939
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,720
Speaker 2:  That's the only way I can describe this look.

940
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,640
Speaker 6:  That's good actually. Yeah, that tracks.

941
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,100
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

942
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,560
Speaker 5:  And because these things are, they're big, they're honking huge. They put

943
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,440
Speaker 5:  out a lot of heat. A lot of 'em have, are gonna have a 3.5. Like they'll

944
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,880
Speaker 5:  take up 3.5 slots on the back of your computer. Good

945
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,630
Speaker 5:  Lord.

946
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's huge. Like,

947
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,960
Speaker 5:  Ew, my 2080 does two slots and I was like, this is too

948
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,720
Speaker 5:  much. So this one is gonna take up nearly four slots,

949
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,680
Speaker 5:  which is gonna mean a lot less computers are gonna be able to

950
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,720
Speaker 5:  use it, which I personally am bummed about. Cuz I wanted to make a really

951
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,400
Speaker 5:  tiny computer and this will just never fit in it. But this

952
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,980
Speaker 5:  particular one decided that it also needed to have extra fans

953
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,960
Speaker 5:  and this stick and it's just a

954
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,380
Speaker 5:  big

955
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,750
Speaker 2:  And the stick just holds it up. Yes.

956
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,720
Speaker 5:  It's just, this is

957
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,680
Speaker 6:  Some like high tech thing. That's there to like augment the way that it

958
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,840
Speaker 6:  works. It's literally just a thing that holds it up. So it doesn't collapse

959
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,800
Speaker 6:  the rest of your computer

960
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,100
Speaker 5:  Because it's so heavy. Like the way, I mean, I don't know. The last time

961
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,040
Speaker 5:  you guys have built a computer, I love it. But you usually have

962
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,960
Speaker 5:  to like you plug it into the PCI slot. You usually put it pretty far

963
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,520
Speaker 5:  down because it takes up so many slots and you don't wanna like lose a bunch

964
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,120
Speaker 5:  of your other slots. So you have to plug it in pretty far down. And then

965
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,930
Speaker 5:  the only thing holding up a very heavy GPU

966
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,820
Speaker 5:  is the soldering from the P like the PCI slot.

967
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,200
Speaker 5:  And this guy is so heavy that they're like, eh, I don't know if the solderings

968
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,710
Speaker 5:  gonna hold it up. So we need to have a prop.

969
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,360
Speaker 2:  Incredible. So we made a stick and the, the stick itself

970
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,280
Speaker 2:  has RGB

971
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,900
Speaker 5:  Lights. Yeah. And the stick has RGB lights on it. Okay. So,

972
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,880
Speaker 5:  but the other ones, like the founder's edition, which is Invidia's one that

973
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,720
Speaker 5:  it made itself and is releasing does not have the stick. It's only the

974
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,790
Speaker 5:  GL. That's gonna have the big RGB stick.

975
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:54,610
Speaker 2:  Okay. I just wanna read you the caption,

976
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:58,570
Speaker 2:  which I know people think our fonts are hard to read, but this font is so

977
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,220
Speaker 2:  hard to read that I'm not a hundred percent sure what all, what it says.

978
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,570
Speaker 2:  My belief of what it says in the caption for this image

979
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:09,130
Speaker 2:  is 5g exclusive our RGB support

980
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,730
Speaker 2:  stick. And it's the 5g exclusive that really

981
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,410
Speaker 2:  sticks out to me. Oh, no idea what that

982
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:20,240
Speaker 2:  means. It might be SG exclusive. Maybe

983
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,180
Speaker 2:  it's hard. It's just hard to say unclear. It also might be AR

984
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,870
Speaker 2:  GB. What? None of that makes sense though.

985
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This thing is like one Bluetooth speaker away from being like the

986
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,480
Speaker 6:  exact center of all of Eli's interests, just right.

987
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,040
Speaker 5:  Party

988
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,160
Speaker 2:  Speaker. I did Sony put out a new party speaker this week. It's

989
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,920
Speaker 2:  $898. And literally the video opens with now with

990
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,520
Speaker 2:  six tweeters, which is

991
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,280
Speaker 2:  just probably so many

992
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,150
Speaker 2:  tweets.

993
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,880
Speaker 2:  I dunno what to

994
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,040
Speaker 5:  Tell still cheaper than any of these GPS.

995
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,480
Speaker 2:  They're like, I'll stick another one on there and make a video $900

996
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,160
Speaker 6:  As always our offer stands to the Sony party team. We will give you one full

997
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,150
Speaker 6:  hour of the first cast. Please come.

998
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:05,920
Speaker 2:  I Creighton has, has reached out on behalf of Dakota. We will, we will go

999
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,760
Speaker 2:  into it. I want to know how many, $900 party speakers do they sell.

1000
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,520
Speaker 2:  That's how I feel about the RTX 40, 90. Yeah. Who is it

1001
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,090
Speaker 2:  for?

1002
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,960
Speaker 5:  So the 40 80 actually starts at about the same price as the

1003
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,280
Speaker 5:  new Saudi speaker, but the 40 90 is gonna start at

1004
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,670
Speaker 5:  $1,600. Wow.

1005
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,600
Speaker 2:  That's crazy. This picture of theuse one where

1006
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,240
Speaker 2:  it's just holding up an entire motherboard in like a T

1007
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,960
Speaker 2:  shape is incredible. Like this is one of the biggest

1008
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,080
Speaker 2:  graphic scars I've ever seen.

1009
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's

1010
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,760
Speaker 2:  Wild. So what does it do? We, should we have not, we've talked about how

1011
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,000
Speaker 2:  big it is and how silly that RGB lights are and whether or not it's a 5g

1012
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,880
Speaker 2:  exclusive. It's

1013
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,480
Speaker 5:  It's basically just like it's, it's, there's not any of the big, the, the

1014
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,600
Speaker 5:  enormous jumps, like we saw with the, the 20, 80, where they finally introduced

1015
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,480
Speaker 5:  rate tracing. I'm gonna make lots of people mad because I said that, but

1016
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,800
Speaker 5:  it's true. There, there, most of the big jumps here are like, it's gonna

1017
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,580
Speaker 5:  be just a lot faster. It's got better storage. It's using G

1018
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,920
Speaker 5:  DDR six X memory, which is wicked

1019
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,760
Speaker 5:  fast. I've been living in the Northeast too long, but it's just super,

1020
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,800
Speaker 5:  super fast. But

1021
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,480
Speaker 6:  Isn't there this ADA Lovelace thing that in videos, China say it's like a

1022
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,990
Speaker 6:  whole new universe of how everyone thinks about everything.

1023
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,840
Speaker 5:  Well, it's their, it's, it's their new architecture, right? Like they they've,

1024
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,120
Speaker 5:  they've moved one architecture up. So, so they do kind of a talk, right?

1025
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,860
Speaker 5:  Like CPU companies do. And this is, this is their new architecture.

1026
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,640
Speaker 5:  But for most people, the practical experience is just gonna be it real

1027
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,390
Speaker 5:  fast. Like, like for the major, the vast majority of people,

1028
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:36,280
Speaker 5:  it's just gonna be a lot faster. And the

1029
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,760
Speaker 5:  thing that got me really excited is gonna have native AV one support,

1030
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,270
Speaker 5:  which is the big, like there's, HGC,

1031
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:47,200
Speaker 5:  that's what most videos are like your phone, your iPhone will

1032
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,690
Speaker 5:  record an ag VC. Most, most stuff does. AV. One

1033
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,360
Speaker 5:  is an open source video Kodak that's really

1034
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,120
Speaker 5:  popular, but it's kind of resource intensive. So it's not used as often as

1035
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,000
Speaker 5:  maybe it could be. So this is gonna have native support, which we really

1036
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,950
Speaker 5:  helpful for, for streamers and stuff. And anybody who is, for some reason,

1037
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:08,880
Speaker 5:  I don't know, ripping enormous Blueray onto their

1038
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,430
Speaker 5:  computer and wanting good playback. So

1039
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:16,040
Speaker 5:  like that was the part that got me the most excited was the AV one support,

1040
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,960
Speaker 5:  which is a very small part of the puzzle, but pretty exciting. Maybe apple

1041
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,010
Speaker 5:  and other people will start adopting it and using it in their processors.

1042
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,610
Speaker 2:  They're never gonna use an

1043
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,480
Speaker 5:  They're never going to, they're

1044
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,720
Speaker 2:  Never, ever, ever going to happen.

1045
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,000
Speaker 5:  They, they they're like who.

1046
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,560
Speaker 2:  And they said, they're all in, on their own GP Aion now, which does not require

1047
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,270
Speaker 2:  support sticks.

1048
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:37,680
Speaker 5:  Well, no, I think they can still support AV one. Like they can still support

1049
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,440
Speaker 5:  this Kodak, but also apple, like, I don't think ever natively

1050
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,040
Speaker 5:  supported, like they've always been butts about video codex and video

1051
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,680
Speaker 5:  containers and supporting them and just, I'm still very upset

1052
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,800
Speaker 2:  Except for E VC.

1053
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Except for HEC. They're like, we we're

1054
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,360
Speaker 2:  On they're like, what about this one that you hate?

1055
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,800
Speaker 5:  Everybody's gonna use it, send it to

1056
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,720
Speaker 2:  Everyone. Actually protocol today had Inco protocol, had a piece about Google

1057
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,310
Speaker 2:  coming up with its own new open competitor. It's Adobe vision and Atmos.

1058
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:07,200
Speaker 2:  I saw that. And how, because of YouTube, they were able

1059
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,000
Speaker 2:  to just force AV one into the world.

1060
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,470
Speaker 6:  And now they're trying to do the same thing with basically HDR 10, right?

1061
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,150
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1062
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:17,000
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But they're, they're packing it, right. It's fast. Like this is nothing

1063
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,320
Speaker 2:  to this video card. The other thing that was really interesting with the

1064
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,480
Speaker 2:  Nvidia announcement to me, so RT for 90, 48. Great. That's what we covered.

1065
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,760
Speaker 2:  That's like the consumer part, then there was this like hard gear down

1066
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,520
Speaker 2:  shift into metaverse like enterprise metaverse

1067
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,400
Speaker 2:  stuff, which is becoming an arms

1068
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,840
Speaker 2:  race kind of between Nvidia and epic, which makes

1069
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,150
Speaker 2:  unreal, so unreal is pushing really hard

1070
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:43,940
Speaker 2:  into Hollywood. So all those new Disney

1071
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,880
Speaker 2:  I'm assuming I know it was true of the Mandalorian, I'm assuming, and, or

1072
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,750
Speaker 2:  as well shot on huge sound stages with micro L D screens

1073
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:54,560
Speaker 2:  that are showing renders right out of unreal, which is

1074
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,110
Speaker 2:  crazy to think about that's happening all over Hollywood. What was the

1075
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:01,160
Speaker 2:  John F just did a whole movie in PR what movie am I thinking of?

1076
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,040
Speaker 5:  Thinking of lion king. Yes.

1077
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. I'll say that for real, Sean F did like all of the lion king,

1078
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,680
Speaker 2:  like directed it in VR. Yeah. Right. So like, there's this big

1079
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,280
Speaker 2:  push in Hollywood for that. And then there's something called the, I hate

1080
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,720
Speaker 2:  this phrase. There's like enterprise metaverse stuff

1081
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,480
Speaker 2:  where they showed Lowe's and other

1082
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,210
Speaker 2:  companies like building what they call digital twins

1083
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,680
Speaker 2:  of their stores. Yeah. And assembly lines and

1084
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,560
Speaker 2:  factories. And then they're having AI try to optimize

1085
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,440
Speaker 2:  the layouts of the stores or like the, how the factories work. And you can't

1086
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,320
Speaker 2:  do that in real life. You need like an actual 3d model of the thing that

1087
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,960
Speaker 2:  works in the same way. And so the, and video's just like pushing super hard

1088
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,080
Speaker 2:  into the, the keynote's worth watching just for this part, cuz it's, it's

1089
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,680
Speaker 2:  really boring on space. But on the other side you're like, oh, like they

1090
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,400
Speaker 2:  can just go capture a whole video game in 3d. Like they can put their camera

1091
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,800
Speaker 2:  in the middle of any video game and do volumetric capture the video game

1092
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,320
Speaker 2:  and then reconstruct that as like a metaverse situation.

1093
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,400
Speaker 6:  Well, and, and not only that, I mean, one of the things Jensen Wong, the

1094
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,750
Speaker 6:  CEO of in video did a really good interview with Ben Thompson it's trajectory,

1095
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,680
Speaker 6:  I guess like right after the keynote. And one of the things he was talking

1096
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,580
Speaker 6:  about is cuz Ben brought up that, that like gear shift you're talking about.

1097
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,560
Speaker 6:  And basically what Jensen said is like the future of

1098
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,120
Speaker 6:  video games. But also all this other stuff you're talking about, the enterprise

1099
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,350
Speaker 6:  universe, you know, know movie making all this stuff is about like

1100
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:27,170
Speaker 6:  generative graphics and the idea that you can like build

1101
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,840
Speaker 6:  as you go, it's not just about rendering something really fast at a really

1102
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,800
Speaker 6:  high frame rate. You are changing the thing that it is on the fly.

1103
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,560
Speaker 6:  Like that's what Minecraft is and Roblox is. And it's like, if we're gonna

1104
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,230
Speaker 6:  get to the point where we have these like lifelike meta versus

1105
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:44,920
Speaker 6:  like that is like, holy shit, the GPU

1106
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,010
Speaker 6:  power we're gonna need in order to do that in a real way. And that was like,

1107
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:51,520
Speaker 6:  he drew a much sort of straighter line between those two things than

1108
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,960
Speaker 6:  I expected. Rich, I thought was really

1109
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,240
Speaker 5:  Interesting. I mean, he's like very financially incentivized to off of course

1110
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,120
Speaker 5:  that line, right? Like, like we saw NVIDIAs in the toilet. Well not

1111
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,800
Speaker 5:  in the toilet, but it's way, way down stock. It's

1112
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,520
Speaker 6:  Tough times price, right?

1113
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,410
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. And that's because they they've lost. Like they were being

1114
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:11,030
Speaker 5:  propped up to kind of an like

1115
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:14,960
Speaker 5:  absurd degree by cryptocurrency and everybody was

1116
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,760
Speaker 5:  buying their, their GPUs to mine and that's gone and they still have a super

1117
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,640
Speaker 5:  robust server business. They still have their, this consumer GPU business.

1118
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,620
Speaker 5:  They still have their like straight to business GPU business,

1119
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,360
Speaker 5:  but they need, they need people to be pumped about GPUs again.

1120
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,000
Speaker 5:  Totally. And they're, they're specifically, they're big, super powerful,

1121
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,200
Speaker 5:  super hot ones. Cause like these GPS sound really, really great, but they

1122
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,960
Speaker 5:  are so far ahead of what you're getting in a PS five or an Xbox,

1123
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,480
Speaker 5:  which is what most game developers are developing to. They're not game

1124
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,350
Speaker 5:  developers do not develop to Invidia without

1125
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:52,200
Speaker 5:  a lot of stuff going on in the background. Right? Like, like the game developers,

1126
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,600
Speaker 5:  right. Go. And they have conversations with them, video and money sometimes

1127
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,400
Speaker 5:  exchanges, hands it's it's, it's a wow, Alex, you know, they're

1128
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,560
Speaker 5:  working together.

1129
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,090
Speaker 6:  Sometimes there's a boat or fan,

1130
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:06,080
Speaker 2:  No, wait a, we really rescue that. You're like, you

1131
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,960
Speaker 2:  know, yeah. You just pay 'em to protect you a little bit. It's great. It

1132
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,560
Speaker 2:  keeps you safe. It'd be a shame. If something happened to your video

1133
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,750
Speaker 2:  game,

1134
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:18,360
Speaker 5:  It's very telling that they're doing like Invidia has DLSS,

1135
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,080
Speaker 5:  which is their own it's it's basically like a software

1136
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,840
Speaker 5:  that makes the video games look prettier and you have to

1137
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,780
Speaker 5:  work with the developers to make, this is like super over

1138
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,120
Speaker 5:  oversimplification of DLSS. I'm so

1139
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,870
Speaker 5:  sorry. My dog is snoring loudly and asleep. I

1140
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:40,390
Speaker 5:  clue, but DLSS is, is this Invidia

1141
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:44,360
Speaker 5:  software that is like exclusive to Nvidia AMD

1142
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,400
Speaker 5:  has their own version of it. Intel's gonna have their own version of it.

1143
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,280
Speaker 5:  It's using AI to, to basically upscale games and make games look a lot

1144
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,920
Speaker 5:  prettier than they might out of the box, but it still has to be supported

1145
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,180
Speaker 5:  by the game developers. And I think it's really telling that only 35 developers

1146
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:02,040
Speaker 5:  are coming out of the box with the new 40 nineties

1147
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,880
Speaker 5:  in the 40 eighties. So you're only gonna see 35 games have

1148
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,800
Speaker 5:  that support. And that's because the real support, most of the money is

1149
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,560
Speaker 5:  going to AMD and to the PS five and the

1150
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,320
Speaker 5:  Xbox. So they kind of need bigger business.

1151
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,080
Speaker 5:  They need more stuff and yeah. Saying, oh, you wanna

1152
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:25,000
Speaker 5:  go and do like build the metaverse yeah. We're the

1153
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,800
Speaker 5:  guys to come talk to. Yeah. Oh, you wanna, you wanna compete and build

1154
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,760
Speaker 5:  your own giant mini L E D screen to render graphics on the fly

1155
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,600
Speaker 5:  for shooting a movie. Yeah. Come talk to us. Like they need that. If they

1156
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,160
Speaker 5:  wanna continue to advance compared to apple, who's just schooling

1157
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,430
Speaker 5:  everybody in the GPU and CPU space right now.

1158
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:47,160
Speaker 2:  It's also fascinating. Cuz the idea of you having a big GPU on your desk

1159
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,000
Speaker 2:  might be going away is game streaming particularly comes to the foreground.

1160
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1161
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,800
Speaker 5:  Well it, I mean, yeah, that was part of the AV one thing here is that they're

1162
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,600
Speaker 5:  like, you wanna have the best stream. You wanna have the fastest, most efficient

1163
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,000
Speaker 5:  stream and just look the coolest, get a big

1164
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,580
Speaker 5:  3.5 slot thick GPU.

1165
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:09,400
Speaker 5:  And if you can fit it in your computer and it won't break the motherboard,

1166
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,120
Speaker 5:  it's gonna be a great time for you. Like I don't even think my computer could

1167
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:12,620
Speaker 5:  fit it.

1168
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,670
Speaker 2:  All right, David, what were you saying? And then we gotta take a break.

1169
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:18,510
Speaker 6:  I was just gonna say it. I, it is interesting that there's this like huge

1170
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:22,120
Speaker 6:  enterprise pivot for a lot of these companies. And it was, I was just thinking,

1171
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,360
Speaker 6:  as I was reading about all this about, I believe it was a Bloomberg story

1172
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,880
Speaker 6:  today about all the chief metaverse officers who are getting hired at these

1173
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,800
Speaker 6:  companies. Yes. That story rules. It's fantastic. And, and it's

1174
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,040
Speaker 6:  basically, these people are getting hired with these big lofty titles and

1175
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,600
Speaker 6:  it's like figure out the metaverse and it's like, what the hell do these

1176
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,440
Speaker 6:  people do all day? And I think if I'm a company like Invidia, like

1177
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,000
Speaker 6:  all these companies are just throwing money at this in case it's like the

1178
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,560
Speaker 6:  next big thing. And I think Invidia will not be the last company who just

1179
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,400
Speaker 6:  like uses it in a lot of branding things to

1180
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,720
Speaker 6:  try and make some money in the short run.

1181
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,800
Speaker 2:  But I don't think this is just branding. I, they have built some real tech

1182
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,480
Speaker 2:  here. That is fascinating. Yeah.

1183
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,270
Speaker 6:  The omniverse thing is very cool.

1184
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,360
Speaker 5:  Like they've had this tech for a while where, where they can go and, and,

1185
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,080
Speaker 5:  and, and do this because they were originally marketing it to

1186
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,920
Speaker 5:  streamers and to gamers. So you could take like the rats

1187
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,680
Speaker 5:  screenshots of all time, by being able to move the cameras and stuff in the

1188
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,250
Speaker 5:  games,

1189
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,000
Speaker 2:  Someone there is someone in a videos like you have to make this real business.

1190
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,440
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's not just screenshots. And they came up with like hyper

1191
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,590
Speaker 2:  optimizing a Lowe's layout with AI.

1192
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:27,920
Speaker 5:  Like I cannot tell you how many cess that I went to where they're like, do

1193
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,470
Speaker 5:  you wanna see how cool our screenshot camera system is now? And I'm like,

1194
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:32,750
Speaker 5:  okay,

1195
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:36,720
Speaker 2:  Sure. That's great. All we gotta take another break. We got a

1196
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,080
Speaker 2:  little, let end, come in, stick around. We'll right

1197
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:45,900
Speaker 2:  back

1198
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,520
Speaker 2:  bought this immediately. Why? I don't know why I have

1199
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,270
Speaker 2:  an Osmo already that I never use

1200
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:09,480
Speaker 2:  here's. And I was like, oh, you know what? This one feature they added will

1201
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,720
Speaker 2:  make me use it. I'm spending $180 on it.

1202
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,360
Speaker 5:  Is it the telescope?

1203
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,170
Speaker 2:  No, not the selfie stick. It has a magnet.

1204
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,700
Speaker 6:  Oh God.

1205
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,840
Speaker 2:  And so you put the little mat on your phone so you can pull the phone right

1206
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,750
Speaker 2:  off it right away, which is big annoy. But then you clip it back on. It

1207
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:27,380
Speaker 2:  runs a shortcut and it opens the app for you right away.

1208
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,370
Speaker 2:  And I was like, oh, this is it. This is I'm gonna be gimbling for days.

1209
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:33,000
Speaker 6:  If only you could launch that app.

1210
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,520
Speaker 2:  Are you guys ready to see some of this smoothest, Instagram stories of all

1211
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:36,770
Speaker 2:  time?

1212
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:37,520
Speaker 6:  Oh my God.

1213
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,320
Speaker 2:  Cause they're coming and you're gonna think to yourself, God, that boy is

1214
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,870
Speaker 2:  smoothly.

1215
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:46,000
Speaker 5:  It's so smooth. No, the

1216
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,090
Speaker 5:  shortcut automatically doing stuff.

1217
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,920
Speaker 6:  He did not enjoy that. Just now. I just want, I just wanted,

1218
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,920
Speaker 2:  Who's just, its never coming on the

1219
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,510
Speaker 2:  show.

1220
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,560
Speaker 5:  A loud noise. That was a

1221
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,180
Speaker 5:  lot.

1222
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:05,160
Speaker 2:  I'm so sorry. That was mine somewhere else. Feel free to

1223
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:05,280
Speaker 2:  go

1224
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,200
Speaker 5:  Forward. I mean I'm super excited as I have been for a

1225
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,320
Speaker 5:  while about the Logitech G cloud gaming handheld.

1226
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,240
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. It was announced this week.

1227
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,840
Speaker 5:  Not excited about that name though. That name is it's very bad.

1228
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,760
Speaker 5:  That's a bad name or the price. It's $349

1229
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,480
Speaker 5:  and 99 cents, which is the same price as like a budget

1230
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,320
Speaker 5:  phone. But I think this is still better than a budget phone for cloud

1231
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:28,560
Speaker 5:  gaming.

1232
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,030
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But it, it, I mean, it's the same price as a switch.

1233
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,440
Speaker 5:  It's actually more expensive. It's $50, more expensive than a switch and

1234
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,560
Speaker 5:  $50 cheaper than the cheapest steam deck you can get. Wow.

1235
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,880
Speaker 2:  Okay. But you are excited about it. I'm

1236
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,960
Speaker 5:  Still excited about it. I like, I think, I think the phone is a terrible

1237
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,080
Speaker 5:  way to cloud game and if we want cloud gaming to be a real thing, there needs

1238
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:50,030
Speaker 5:  to be real hardware to support it. And this is a great first if expensive,

1239
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,950
Speaker 5:  poorly named step.

1240
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:54,990
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Just the idea that there is like going to be

1241
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:58,580
Speaker 6:  real multi-company multi-platform

1242
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:02,360
Speaker 6:  competition over handheld cloud gaming, I think is

1243
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,960
Speaker 6:  very exciting. Cam Foxton on our team wrote a really good story this week.

1244
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,680
Speaker 6:  About one a like the, I think the headline was the PSV time is now

1245
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,350
Speaker 6:  again,

1246
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,280
Speaker 5:  This time it'll

1247
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,240
Speaker 6:  Work. And it's like on the one hand, like guy needs a hug. Like he's, he's

1248
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,440
Speaker 6:  been through a lot with his PSV, but the other hand, like he's kind of right.

1249
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,510
Speaker 6:  It kind of is

1250
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,760
Speaker 2:  It's this its

1251
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,970
Speaker 6:  Little tiny gaming consoles. Bring back the game. Boy,

1252
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:26,880
Speaker 7:  My husband agree. My husband is such a PS Vita

1253
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,360
Speaker 7:  fan. He like will be having dinner and then he'll just sign and

1254
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,800
Speaker 7:  go. I miss the PS Vita. I don't

1255
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,480
Speaker 7:  understand. I just don't understand. Yeah. He's just like, you don't

1256
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,120
Speaker 7:  understand just

1257
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,680
Speaker 5:  Eating a tomato being like

1258
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,520
Speaker 7:  On a like random road trip. He'll be like, you know, I really miss my PS

1259
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,720
Speaker 7:  Vita and it's just like, I don't understand it. I was, I showed him Cam's

1260
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,440
Speaker 7:  article and he was like, I've written something like that before, too. I

1261
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,720
Speaker 7:  understand.

1262
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,640
Speaker 2:  So wait, the GCloud gaming hand, horrible name three 40 as

1263
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,360
Speaker 2:  much as switch Ola. That's what I was thinking of.

1264
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:02,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, but less, less, you know, it's not an Ola display. It's an led

1265
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,600
Speaker 5:  it's traditional led display. It's got a

1266
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,040
Speaker 5:  Qualcomm snap dragons, seven 20 G

1267
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,560
Speaker 5:  processor, four gigabytes of Ram. It's gonna have

1268
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,140
Speaker 5:  64 gigabytes of storage in it. It's basically a Chromebook,

1269
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,440
Speaker 5:  but for cloud gaming instead of cloud PC.

1270
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,070
Speaker 2:  Right. So here's the line that really caught me. You can launch

1271
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:25,960
Speaker 2:  Xbox cloud gaming, but it's just a progressive web

1272
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,640
Speaker 2:  app. Yeah. I mean that's amazing, but

1273
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,360
Speaker 6:  What yeah. What else do you need it to be? Well,

1274
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,040
Speaker 5:  That's the way it's done on, on the steam deck now. Like I've got, I've got

1275
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:37,000
Speaker 5:  the, I went through the whole process of setting up X cloud

1276
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,840
Speaker 5:  gaming, whatever it's called on my steam deck. And it's just

1277
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,640
Speaker 5:  a, it's just a website, but it works perfectly on,

1278
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,520
Speaker 5:  on my little steam deck. Does it? So like why should they

1279
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,460
Speaker 5:  reinvent the wheel for this as well? When they've got the app built

1280
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,400
Speaker 2:  The web isn't dead, everybody. The

1281
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,950
Speaker 5:  Web's here.

1282
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:57,800
Speaker 2:  Here's the evidence, the verse.com and the

1283
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,740
Speaker 2:  Xbox cloud gaming progressive would app.

1284
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,900
Speaker 2:  The future is bright for the web. All right, David, what's yours.

1285
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,840
Speaker 6:  I'm pretty excited about framework's new Chromebook frameworks.

1286
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Speaker 6:  This company we've covered a bunch that, that their whole thing is like super

1287
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,560
Speaker 6:  upgradeable, super repairable laptops. And they made a, they made an

1288
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,520
Speaker 6:  Intel based windows laptop that I think is like a little too expensive for

1289
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,520
Speaker 6:  what it is, but people really like it. And I think they have like started

1290
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,080
Speaker 6:  to actually deliver on the promise of making these things upgradeable. And

1291
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:28,680
Speaker 6:  that's very cool. And now, now they have a Chromebook. And as we've talked

1292
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,760
Speaker 6:  about, I was sad about the pixel books. So this made me feel a little better.

1293
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,280
Speaker 6:  There's like new people doing interesting stuff with Chromebooks and it's

1294
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,240
Speaker 6:  still super upgradeable. It looks nice. I think it's a thousand bucks,

1295
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,760
Speaker 6:  which feels like a lot of money again, but you can choose all your ports.

1296
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,680
Speaker 6:  You can choose like lots of things about how it works. You can choose the

1297
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:50,480
Speaker 6:  Ram and the storage. And it's just like, I don't know. The tinkerer in me

1298
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,300
Speaker 6:  is very excited about specking to death, a Chromebook,

1299
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,200
Speaker 5:  But you'll still be using Chrome ass, which is I've come. I

1300
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,040
Speaker 5:  like I love, but I think is super ugly and needs an

1301
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,090
Speaker 5:  entire refresh.

1302
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:05,230
Speaker 6:  Oh, I totally agree.

1303
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:08,760
Speaker 2:  Here's what I tell you. Framework tweeted. Google is committed to a minimum

1304
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,310
Speaker 2:  of eight years of updates, framework, laptop, Chromebook condition.

1305
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,520
Speaker 6:  That's a, a long time

1306
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,280
Speaker 2:  Google. Isn't committed to Google search for eight years. Like this is a

1307
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,520
Speaker 2:  huge commitment to that. Look at any moment. They're like, fuck it. We're

1308
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,440
Speaker 2:  shutting down search. Like it's time to sunset search. We're

1309
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,880
Speaker 2:  very sorry that you relied on it. Here's do do YouTube

1310
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,560
Speaker 2:  stories.

1311
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,750
Speaker 6:  We're just maps now.

1312
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:34,430
Speaker 2:  Like, well, I, I just like don't buy it. I

1313
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:37,730
Speaker 2:  it's amazing how Google has like torched its brand in that way.

1314
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:41,640
Speaker 6:  It really is. I mean, to be like eight years is like a ludicrously long time

1315
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,160
Speaker 6:  for Google. But I feel like if you're gonna bet on anything betting on Google

1316
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:48,070
Speaker 6:  Chrome to last a while is a, is a decent bet. I would say

1317
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:52,040
Speaker 2:  I wouldn't, I wouldn't take that bet. Just telling

1318
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,150
Speaker 2:  you, sorry.

1319
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:53,640
Speaker 6:  Fair

1320
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,200
Speaker 2:  Enough. Google's like we don't support Cordy keyboards anymore. We've looked

1321
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,960
Speaker 2:  into it and they're dumb. It's over VI, do you have a lightning round

1322
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,530
Speaker 2:  entry?

1323
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,800
Speaker 7:  Is it a gadget or just a story that I like?

1324
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,280
Speaker 6:  Just anything, something going on this week, you're into

1325
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,590
Speaker 2:  Whatever you want. You've earned. You've earned it by being on the show today.

1326
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:13,520
Speaker 7:  Well, if it's something I'm looking forward to, then it's

1327
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,280
Speaker 7:  probably the pixel watch just because I am dying to know what

1328
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,960
Speaker 7:  this thing is gonna be like. I've just been, it's just been haunting my

1329
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,560
Speaker 7:  nightmares ever since it was announced

1330
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,820
Speaker 2:  Nightmares.

1331
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:27,360
Speaker 7:  Yes. Cuz where OS before where OS three was an absolute

1332
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,190
Speaker 7:  nightmare that every single time a new where OS two watch was announced,

1333
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:35,040
Speaker 7:  I just sat on my bed and cried. It was not, you know, that's an, that's an

1334
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,920
Speaker 7:  exaggeration, but it was just gentle weeping. It was sad. It was

1335
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,280
Speaker 7:  so sad. And you know, like, I don't know. I'm just so

1336
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:46,120
Speaker 7:  curious as to what this thing is gonna be. Cuz Google

1337
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:50,040
Speaker 7:  was at the forefront of wearables back in 2014, like Android wear was

1338
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,920
Speaker 7:  first to the game and then they were like, meh, we

1339
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,580
Speaker 7:  give up. And then they were like, oh no, smartwatches are popular

1340
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,480
Speaker 7:  now. Oh. And then like in 2019 they

1341
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,200
Speaker 7:  just started like building. They like bought a bunch of fossil

1342
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,080
Speaker 7:  stuff. They were bought Fitbit and they were just kind of

1343
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,920
Speaker 7:  like mulling it. And then Rick Olo comes out and I just remember being

1344
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,440
Speaker 7:  there at the made by Google event in 2019, he's like ambient computing. And

1345
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,400
Speaker 7:  I was like, are you gonna fix it? Are you gonna fix it? And then I

1346
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,270
Speaker 7:  had to wait another like two years to get that Samsung. And I was like, you

1347
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:28,020
Speaker 7:  kind of didn't fix. Okay, well I'll wait another year.

1348
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,880
Speaker 7:  And then, and then I was like, oh it's it's it's you know, I

1349
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,400
Speaker 7:  still see the promise kind of, you kind of made some progress. And then I

1350
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,850
Speaker 7:  tested them on Blanc summit three. And I was like, oh no, the fragmentation

1351
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:42,560
Speaker 7:  is still there. So there's just so much, I'm curious about with the

1352
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,520
Speaker 7:  pixel watch. I really wanna get my hands on it and probably break my brain,

1353
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,280
Speaker 7:  testing it, just comparing it to what Samsung's done with it. And

1354
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,790
Speaker 7:  well it's coming soon, right? Yeah. It's haunting my dreams.

1355
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:57,640
Speaker 7:  It's coming soon. October 6th. I'm just so

1356
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,110
Speaker 7:  curious what they're doing with it.

1357
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:02,440
Speaker 2:  I feel like in the abstract you described all of Google hardware. You did.

1358
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,360
Speaker 2:  Yes. Right? Like if you just take out the words watch or like, did they fix

1359
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,200
Speaker 2:  it? And then Rick Olo said some stuff and they bought some stuff and then

1360
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,400
Speaker 2:  you waited a year and then Samsung did a thing and then Google didn't do

1361
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,120
Speaker 2:  a thing. And then, oh my God, the fragmentation. And are I gonna do it? It's

1362
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,910
Speaker 2:  like, I it's, it's all of it. Yeah.

1363
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,940
Speaker 6:  That's Google. Yeah.

1364
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:22,760
Speaker 2:  All right. My last one is Victrola put out an $800 turntable

1365
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,560
Speaker 2:  to stream directly to Sonos, which is cool. They should have done this.

1366
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,920
Speaker 2:  Like Sono should have done this. It's just funny. That's Victrola, which

1367
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:32,560
Speaker 2:  is until recently, like one of those like zombie brands that you buy at target

1368
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,440
Speaker 2:  for $99, like RCA biggest glow up for a zombie

1369
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,240
Speaker 2:  brand that has ever

1370
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,280
Speaker 6:  Occurred. Good for that

1371
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,080
Speaker 2:  Guys. Like the $99. Like, you know those like

1372
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,960
Speaker 2:  blue suitcases that have turntables in them step up to $800

1373
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,720
Speaker 2:  stream clay sentence. Very good. All of us should be so

1374
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,400
