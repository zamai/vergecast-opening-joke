Description: Laura Mae Martin is a big believer in the settings menu. Martin is Google’s Executive Productivity Advisor, and spends much of her time working with other Googlers on improving their productivity and communication systems — and one of the things she often recommends is taking a few minutes to poke through the options. “With your phone, with your email, your Slack, all these things, the features are there but we don’t take the time to dive into them,” she says. She even thinks you should maybe have to look at settings before you can use the app. “Like, you can’t get into the app unless you spend 10 minutes figuring out what it can do.”
On this episode of The Vergecast, the first in our three-part miniseries about all things productivity and work, we talk to Martin about how she sees things changing. Four years after the pandemic forced us all to work from home, are we finally figuring out remote and hybrid work? Are managers realizing that butts-in-seats isn’t, and maybe was never, a good metric for productivity? And is the era of the hard-charging hustle bro finally giving way to a healthier, more holistic way of thinking about being productive? Martin sees all these things from so many perspectives, and has lots of thoughts on everything from communication styles to energy flows.
We also talk about the rise in digital productivity tools like Notion and Slack, and why email is still so important — and still so terrible. One of Martin’s jobs at Google is to consult with the teams building Workspace apps like Docs and Gmail, and she has lots of thoughts on how those product works and how they could be better. We also talk about whether AI stands to change the way we get things done, and whether it’ll help us do more or just give us more to do.
Along the way, Martin offers us lots of practical tips on how to manage our digital lives a little better. Charging your phone outside the bedroom, no-tech Tuesdays, and a couple of prettier email labels might actually go a long way. And if you have too many notes in too many places, it’s time to get a Main List going.

00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:06,165
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the Zettel Cast and System.

3
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:09,765
Speaker 2:  If you don't know what that is, don't worry about it and honestly you're

4
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:13,565
Speaker 2:  probably better off for it. But if you know, you know, I'm your friend

5
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:17,325
Speaker 2:  David Pierce and this is the first in art new three part series

6
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:21,205
Speaker 2:  that we're calling Works Smarter. And the idea is basically to talk about

7
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:24,725
Speaker 2:  productivity. But I mean that in the biggest, broadest

8
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,765
Speaker 2:  loosest way possible. Like I will talk to you four

9
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:32,325
Speaker 2:  hours about calendar apps and task management systems and

10
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:36,325
Speaker 2:  whether notion is better than one note. Like truly, I will talk to you about

11
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:39,565
Speaker 2:  this four hours, but no one needs to hear that.

12
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:43,845
Speaker 2:  I, I just think that these questions about how we should deal

13
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:47,445
Speaker 2:  with all of the stuff that happens in our digital lives

14
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:51,565
Speaker 2:  is really interesting. How should we think about screen time and managing

15
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:55,325
Speaker 2:  our relationships with our devices? Where should we put all of our

16
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:59,445
Speaker 2:  stuff? We have all this stuff online, from photos to sensitive

17
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,525
Speaker 2:  documents to emails to like just the random things that you

18
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:06,965
Speaker 2:  accumulate as you go about your life day to day. How should we manage all

19
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:10,365
Speaker 2:  of that? Does it matter? Do you need to manage all of that? These are the

20
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:13,605
Speaker 2:  questions I think are really interesting and we're in a minute right now

21
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:17,645
Speaker 2:  where a, there are a lot of new tools being built to make sense of

22
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:21,605
Speaker 2:  all of your digital stuff and we're starting to rethink

23
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:25,765
Speaker 2:  what it means to be productive. What it means to be a person

24
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:29,205
Speaker 2:  online is changing and I think that's really interesting. And so we're gonna

25
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:32,965
Speaker 2:  spend the next three Sundays talking about all of that. We're gonna talk

26
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:36,205
Speaker 2:  to people who make products, people who use products, people who talk to

27
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:40,005
Speaker 2:  people about using those products and try to make sense of all of it

28
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:43,645
Speaker 2:  and maybe come up with some like cool practical tips. Along the way

29
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:47,845
Speaker 2:  for the first one we're gonna talk to Laura Mae Martin who works at Google,

30
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:51,685
Speaker 2:  helping other people at Google be more productive. She coaches,

31
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:55,445
Speaker 2:  executives, she teaches courses. She has a newsletter that You can subscribe

32
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:59,245
Speaker 2:  to. She just wrote a book called Uptime that's really good and the

33
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:03,005
Speaker 2:  thrust of her work is to help people get more done but to also

34
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:06,965
Speaker 2:  redefine what that looks like. She thinks a lot about how you should use

35
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:10,925
Speaker 2:  downtime and how you should structure your days and how you should think

36
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:14,685
Speaker 2:  about your own energy flows and communication styles and really what it means

37
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:18,645
Speaker 2:  to just kind of be more deliberate about everything that you

38
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:22,365
Speaker 2:  do and not just professionally. One of her big ideas that I really like and

39
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:26,125
Speaker 2:  we talk about a bit is this collapse of the idea of there's a professional

40
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,885
Speaker 2:  you and a personal you. I think that's wrong. There's just you. You have

41
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:33,325
Speaker 2:  to do all this stuff and increasingly all this stuff is meshed together and

42
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:37,165
Speaker 2:  happening on screens. So we talked about all that and

43
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:40,365
Speaker 2:  much more. It was a really interesting conversation and I learned a ton so

44
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:43,965
Speaker 2:  let's just get into it. All of that is coming in just a second but I have

45
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:47,045
Speaker 2:  to check my notes to make sure I got to everything. So hold on, we'll be

46
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:47,525
Speaker 2:  right back.

47
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:10,465
Speaker 2:  And all of that she says is just wrong. It's

48
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:13,785
Speaker 2:  unhealthy, it leads to burnout, it doesn't actually help you accomplish more

49
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:17,625
Speaker 2:  over time, it's just unproductive. So we started just

50
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,585
Speaker 2:  by talking about that and I asked her basically yes, okay you

51
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:25,345
Speaker 2:  want this more holistic, more sane, less hustle

52
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:29,575
Speaker 2:  culturey way of thinking about productivity but is that

53
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:32,855
Speaker 2:  realistic? Are we actually going to get that in a time where

54
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:37,255
Speaker 2:  still maybe the best way we have to measure productivity is how many hours

55
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,495
Speaker 2:  are you in the office and how many things do you produce?

56
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:44,495
Speaker 2:  Even if everybody intellectually agrees those are bad measures. Those are

57
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:48,375
Speaker 2:  kind of still the measures we have. So I asked her what she's seeing. Is

58
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:52,335
Speaker 2:  there a real cultural shift happening in the way that we

59
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:56,055
Speaker 2:  talk about productivity or is this just kind of a woo woo

60
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:59,535
Speaker 2:  thing that we like to tell ourselves before we get back to yelling at people

61
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:00,535
Speaker 2:  about not working enough?

62
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:04,815
Speaker 4:  What I would ask of you too is all these people you've talked to that kind

63
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:08,775
Speaker 4:  of had that mentality for maybe 10 or 15 years, what happened is then is

64
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,735
Speaker 4:  that sustainable or are those people now totally stepped back from

65
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:16,375
Speaker 4:  the workforce and started a farm because that was their only way of kind

66
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:20,295
Speaker 4:  of pulling out of it. And so I think that one thing the pandemic did is

67
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:23,615
Speaker 4:  kind of shift our mindset to, okay, we have to think of ourselves as whole

68
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:27,255
Speaker 4:  people and everything we have going on, it's work,

69
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:31,335
Speaker 4:  it's home, and how do we look at how to keep employees happy and

70
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:35,255
Speaker 4:  productive long term? And so the, even the word productivity, I didn't really

71
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:38,175
Speaker 4:  want it in the title of the book 'cause I just feel like it brings up this

72
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,855
Speaker 4:  sense of like, ugh, I gotta churn more out. Kind of that sense of dread.

73
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:45,575
Speaker 4:  But I think when we think about wellbeing and people ask about the

74
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:49,335
Speaker 4:  balance of the two, it makes it seem like they're the

75
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:52,535
Speaker 4:  opposite and they're two ends of the stick that you're trying to go back

76
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:55,935
Speaker 4:  and forth on. But when you think about the fact that when you

77
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:59,845
Speaker 4:  prioritize your wellbeing, you end up more productive, which

78
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:03,085
Speaker 4:  gives you more time for your wellbeing, which makes you more productive.

79
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:06,285
Speaker 4:  And so it ends up being actually this holistic view and

80
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:10,365
Speaker 4:  sustainable view of getting things done. I think the hustle culture

81
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:14,405
Speaker 4:  is still having its moment in the sense of, you know, you hear a

82
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:18,205
Speaker 4:  lot of, ugh, I'm back to back, I'm crazy, you know how

83
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:22,085
Speaker 4:  it is, fire drills this, this language around it. And so I

84
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:25,805
Speaker 4:  try to be aggressively the opposite and say awkward things like, oh I'm actually

85
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:29,045
Speaker 4:  the perfect level of balance or I have the right exactly the right amount

86
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:32,245
Speaker 4:  of commitments or you know, I, I have breaks in my day and it, it makes people

87
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:35,885
Speaker 4:  feel weird because you know, that's what we're supposed to do but nobody

88
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:39,605
Speaker 4:  talks like that. So I think we're the, the language is dragging a bit but

89
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:41,725
Speaker 4:  I think the mindset is there, which is great.

90
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,445
Speaker 2:  It's so funny you bring up the word productivity 'cause this is the thing

91
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,125
Speaker 2:  I've been thinking a lot about too. And like we talk about productivity,

92
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,125
Speaker 2:  going back to like the industrial revolution is like literally how many things

93
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:53,525
Speaker 2:  are you making intellectually if you ask anyone,

94
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,765
Speaker 2:  it's a terrible measure, right? Like all of our measures of productivity

95
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:00,845
Speaker 2:  in life now are bad. The like how long were you sitting in your

96
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:04,205
Speaker 2:  chair is not a good measure of productivity? How many things did you make

97
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:08,045
Speaker 2:  as like a knowledge worker is not even a thing and yet it, it

98
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:11,845
Speaker 2:  feels like in aggregate nothing has changed. And I, I think

99
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,605
Speaker 2:  in a certain way, like I talk to folks at companies like Microsoft and Google

100
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,685
Speaker 2:  who are like looking for new ways to track people with the idea that maybe

101
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:22,365
Speaker 2:  if we attach more numbers to this we'll suddenly figure it out and everything

102
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:25,365
Speaker 2:  will be great. What I wonder is whether

103
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:30,045
Speaker 2:  like we're gonna look back 50 years from now and realize that like the pandemic

104
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:34,125
Speaker 2:  was a real sort of cultural inflection point or

105
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:37,565
Speaker 2:  if we're gonna be stuck in these problems forever even though everybody knows

106
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:40,245
Speaker 2:  the solutions we've been talking about for decades are not the right ones.

107
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think even the like how long are you sitting at your desk that you

108
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,885
Speaker 4:  mentioned? You know that nine to five, I feel like even with the pandemic

109
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:50,965
Speaker 4:  we saw a little bit of a shift to and and some companies like Google are

110
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:54,885
Speaker 4:  already thinking this way, but oh if somebody feels like they work

111
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:58,645
Speaker 4:  better from 10 to six, is that something we can honor? And and we

112
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:01,325
Speaker 4:  only would've figured that out about ourselves when we were given that little

113
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:04,445
Speaker 4:  bit of breathing room and flexibility to decide our schedules and without

114
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:08,405
Speaker 4:  commutes and working from home. And so I think the goal when I talk

115
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,245
Speaker 4:  to managers and and people who are thinking how do I judge if

116
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:15,925
Speaker 4:  it's not number of calls per day, if it's not, you know, how much did I get

117
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:19,605
Speaker 4:  done that day? What should I be really judging? And I think it goes back

118
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:23,285
Speaker 4:  to that longevity piece. Do you have happy, successful,

119
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:27,965
Speaker 4:  inspired creative employees that want to stay and that are performing

120
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,765
Speaker 4:  well? And when we look at the macro level, so instead of hey, what did you

121
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,485
Speaker 4:  get done this week? How long were you sitting in your chair today? Knowing

122
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:38,725
Speaker 4:  that there will be ebbs and flows and giving people that flexibility instead

123
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:41,885
Speaker 4:  saying, what did you accomplish this quarter? Or Hey we're gonna look at

124
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:45,845
Speaker 4:  this you know, half year project and you do it in the way that feels best

125
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:49,805
Speaker 4:  to you and it gives more of that chance for you to figure out what

126
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:53,445
Speaker 4:  is the best way to do this, that breathing room instead of the micromanage

127
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:54,245
Speaker 4:  mentality.

128
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:58,245
Speaker 2:  I'm curious how you think about this even in like the coaching you're doing

129
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:01,005
Speaker 2:  with folks at Google. 'cause I, I would assume most of the people you're

130
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:04,885
Speaker 2:  working with are managers and other sort of high ranking people, people

131
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:08,325
Speaker 2:  who oversee people generally speaking, right? Yes. And like those are the

132
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:12,085
Speaker 2:  people who set the rules for the other people, many of whom are, are gonna

133
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,045
Speaker 2:  read a book like yours in order to figure out how to escape the meeting hell

134
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:18,885
Speaker 2:  that their managers have put them in. And so like I think I,

135
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:22,965
Speaker 2:  this idea of starting at the top to make some of this change makes

136
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:26,325
Speaker 2:  a lot of sense to me. But it also seems like the last few years have been

137
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:28,845
Speaker 2:  a lot of people raising their hands being like, I get way more work done

138
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:31,565
Speaker 2:  at home. Can I stay at home? And a lot of managers being like absolutely

139
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:34,565
Speaker 2:  not come into the office because that's how I tell if you're working. What

140
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:37,045
Speaker 2:  are you seeing from the manager side of thing? Like are they just slowly

141
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:40,325
Speaker 2:  like learning how to let go a little bit on some of that stuff?

142
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:44,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think, you know, there's a lot of flexibility in the sense that okay,

143
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,085
Speaker 4:  if you're gonna spend three days at home, then I'm gonna be okay with whatever

144
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:50,885
Speaker 4:  you're choosing to do on those two days. If you wanna switch the days that

145
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,485
Speaker 4:  you're here or let's think about our team meeting schedule. And so you're

146
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:57,885
Speaker 4:  right, I always encourage even from the wellbeing perspective, we were just

147
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:01,805
Speaker 4:  talking about, you know, I tell managers if you're gonna say, oh don't

148
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:04,805
Speaker 4:  worry about working on the weekends, but I'm sending emails on the weekends

149
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:08,725
Speaker 4:  or take your vacation off. But you know, you'll see me emailing on vacation

150
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,925
Speaker 4:  that doesn't set the example. So it really does have to start at the top

151
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:15,725
Speaker 4:  where you might create, you know, one thing I do with a lot of executives

152
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:19,525
Speaker 4:  is create a user manual meaning a a description of how they

153
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:23,205
Speaker 4:  work. And I think it's important to showcase there, hey, I've really thought

154
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,645
Speaker 4:  about where I work best and I've thought about the fact that I have my power

155
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:30,325
Speaker 4:  hours or my best work time when I'm at home in the morning. And so I'm gonna

156
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,845
Speaker 4:  do my best to keep those free and communicate that and encourage people on

157
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:37,445
Speaker 4:  your team to do the same and have that empowerment to say, I'm really

158
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:41,125
Speaker 4:  thinking about when I get my best work done. And then as a manager both

159
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,485
Speaker 4:  living that and communicating it. Because the more that you talk about those

160
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:48,445
Speaker 4:  things, the more it says, oh you know, our VP does this so I

161
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:51,485
Speaker 4:  feel like I can do that. And they're showing how they get more done and I

162
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,085
Speaker 4:  can do the same.

163
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:55,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Do you have a strong thesis on hybrid work? It feels like

164
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:58,965
Speaker 2:  we're in a moment right now where I suspect everyone you talk to is asking

165
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:02,725
Speaker 2:  you like, how do I set up my team to succeed in a hybrid

166
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:06,125
Speaker 2:  universe? And at some point maybe the answer is lots of answers, but that's

167
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,725
Speaker 2:  no fun. So do you have a sort of strong idea about how to kind of do this

168
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:10,125
Speaker 2:  correctly?

169
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:14,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think that some level of flexibility is ideal.

170
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:18,565
Speaker 4:  So saying, you know, everyone has to be in the office every day at this time.

171
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:22,525
Speaker 4:  I don't think you're gonna get your best results at that point. You

172
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:26,245
Speaker 4:  might not even get the best people with that schedule. And so I think figuring

173
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:30,405
Speaker 4:  out what is that right mix of saying, hey, we as a team need to connect

174
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:34,205
Speaker 4:  and that needs to be on this day. And setting those things from the beginning

175
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:37,605
Speaker 4:  so that people can then work around it. But at the same time, you know, I

176
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:40,725
Speaker 4:  know a lot of successful companies that have only remote employees, but they're

177
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,525
Speaker 4:  really thinking about, okay then we need to have these connection points

178
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:47,085
Speaker 4:  throughout the year. Maybe more in-person offsites or you know, if you're

179
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:50,365
Speaker 4:  working globally, you need to have more of a structure of saying, okay, when

180
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:53,885
Speaker 4:  we have APEC US meetings, they're always on Tuesday night, Wednesday morning.

181
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,885
Speaker 4:  'cause that's respecting, you know, culturally and everybody's not just working

182
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:01,205
Speaker 4:  at all different times. And so I think it's looking at the makeup of your

183
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:04,085
Speaker 4:  team. 'cause hybrid can mean lots of different things. It can mean, you know,

184
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:07,805
Speaker 4:  in the office and in work it can mean some of your team is in the office

185
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:10,725
Speaker 4:  and some of your team is remote, which says you know a lot about how you're

186
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:14,005
Speaker 4:  conducting meetings and making sure that people feel included and things

187
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:17,245
Speaker 4:  like that. So I think it's really about intention. I mean so many things

188
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:20,005
Speaker 4:  are about intention, but sitting down and saying, what does this actually

189
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,765
Speaker 4:  look like and how can I make it work? And then the other thing I always encourage

190
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:27,325
Speaker 4:  is, you know, don't just set it and forget it. If you have a team who's hybrid

191
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:30,885
Speaker 4:  and you're saying, Hey, let's test out this three, two model, let's test

192
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:33,725
Speaker 4:  out all of us being here Wednesday, and then you choose these other days

193
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:37,565
Speaker 4:  and our meetings fall these days, go back in a quarter half year

194
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:40,925
Speaker 4:  and take a survey and ask how it's working. Because a lot of times you won't

195
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:44,805
Speaker 4:  flush that out unless you ask. And so that's the best way to make sure it's,

196
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,765
Speaker 4:  it's working for everyone.

197
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:49,645
Speaker 2:  Totally. Yeah. One of the things I really liked about your book is you, you

198
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,165
Speaker 2:  keep coming back to the idea that you just kind of have to do this stuff

199
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:56,125
Speaker 2:  on purpose. And I never, I never, I hadn't really thought about it

200
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,925
Speaker 2:  until I was reading it, but I think it's really true how much of work, and

201
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:03,645
Speaker 2:  frankly like digital life in general just happens to us,

202
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:07,085
Speaker 2:  right? Like things appear in your inbox, stuff happens in your calendar,

203
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:11,085
Speaker 2:  like Slack is always going, there's just, there's just things always happening.

204
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:14,085
Speaker 2:  And I think like the, all the examples you gave of executives you talked

205
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,485
Speaker 2:  to where you're like, where are you spending time and they just don't know

206
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:21,325
Speaker 2:  was both very, made me feel a lot better about my own habits,

207
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:24,925
Speaker 2:  but was also really interesting and, and I think we're in a moment right

208
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:29,005
Speaker 2:  now where so much has changed about how we work and

209
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:32,365
Speaker 2:  like the tools that we use and the kinds of work that gets done. and it feels

210
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:36,165
Speaker 2:  like we just haven't developed the muscles in so many

211
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:40,085
Speaker 2:  ways to actually both like measure this stuff with

212
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:43,725
Speaker 2:  numbers and tools and stuff, but also to just say like, okay, how is any

213
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:47,485
Speaker 2:  of this supposed to work? What am I actually doing? What am I getting out

214
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:50,765
Speaker 2:  of this? And I feel like it was, it was such a simple piece of advice to

215
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:54,525
Speaker 2:  take out of like a, in in a lot of ways a very sort of practical technical

216
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:56,605
Speaker 2:  book. But it was just like, just pay attention. Like yeah,

217
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:57,645
Speaker 4:  Just, just, yeah,

218
00:13:57,645 --> 00:13:58,925
Speaker 2:  Just look at this as you're doing it.

219
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:02,845
Speaker 4:  Well I think it was one of Cal Newport's books, maybe Digital Minimalism

220
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:06,765
Speaker 4:  that talks about Amish culture and how they don't reject all

221
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:10,685
Speaker 4:  technology. They actually look at each individual technology and really

222
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:14,485
Speaker 4:  analyze is this technology, what is it gonna do for us? What is it gonna

223
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:18,045
Speaker 4:  take from us? Is it worth adopting? They like really think through it. And

224
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:21,605
Speaker 4:  I feel like it's the opposite where like you said, it's like, all right,

225
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:24,485
Speaker 4:  slack's on the scene, now we're all in Slack. Okay now we have our phone,

226
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:27,485
Speaker 4:  now we sign up for this newsletter. It's just like we default into these

227
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:31,405
Speaker 4:  things and then we spend a lot of time kind of backtracking

228
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:34,885
Speaker 4:  and say like, okay, do we really need this email in our inbox? Do I actually

229
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:38,205
Speaker 4:  want to be on my phone for this many hours every night? You know, so it's

230
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:42,125
Speaker 4:  that reverse mentality. But you know, I joke with people, my phone

231
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:45,845
Speaker 4:  has a bedtime, like the alarm goes off, I put it to bed, I put it to bed

232
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:49,205
Speaker 4:  in its own bedroom. But that requires a lot of intention 'cause it's much

233
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:53,085
Speaker 4:  easier for me to just sit with it all night on my couch doing things that

234
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:56,485
Speaker 4:  I actually don't wanna do. So it does kind of require that thoughtfulness

235
00:14:56,665 --> 00:15:00,085
Speaker 4:  of what time do I wanna be done with my phone at night? And then how do I

236
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,365
Speaker 4:  make that happen with a routine?

237
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:05,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. And I think there's an interesting tension

238
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:08,405
Speaker 2:  in that that I, I find really fascinating about this whole space. Like I

239
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:12,005
Speaker 2:  really like the productivity subreddit because half the posts on there are

240
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:15,445
Speaker 2:  just somebody being like, I I, why can't I get anything done? I'm super burned

241
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:18,525
Speaker 2:  out. And half the comments are always like trying to be helpful and give

242
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:21,525
Speaker 2:  them tips and sort of build them up and say, take a break, you know, here

243
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,485
Speaker 2:  are some things that work for me. And then the other half are just people

244
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:26,165
Speaker 2:  being like, just be disciplined. Shut up. Like just if you've stuff to do,

245
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:28,885
Speaker 2:  just do the stuff. Why I don't understand what the problem is. And I think

246
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,885
Speaker 2:  it's, it's such an interesting dichotomy because on the one hand,

247
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:36,885
Speaker 2:  like if you want use your phone less, just use your phone less,

248
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:40,445
Speaker 2:  right? Is, is not, I think is, is not a particularly helpful piece of advice,

249
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:44,085
Speaker 2:  but is not a wrong piece of advice and like charge your phone in the other

250
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:47,925
Speaker 2:  room is a thing You can just do, right? But I also

251
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:51,085
Speaker 2:  think we're in a moment right now where all of the questions are being asked

252
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:55,005
Speaker 2:  about like, okay, how can I sort of use technology to help me

253
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,925
Speaker 2:  manage my technology? And we're talking about, you know, focus modes and

254
00:15:58,145 --> 00:16:01,685
Speaker 2:  all these different apps that build trees when you're not using them and

255
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:05,325
Speaker 2:  all this different stuff. So I, I'm curious like how you feel

256
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:09,605
Speaker 2:  about just kind of being a thoughtful person and being

257
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:13,285
Speaker 2:  proactive and thinking this stuff through versus like, can you build systems

258
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:16,685
Speaker 2:  to protect you from your own worst instincts? Because I feel like a lot of

259
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,965
Speaker 2:  technology is trying to take advantage of your worst instincts

260
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:23,645
Speaker 2:  and you're very much trying to keep people out of those holes.

261
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:28,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think I equate it always to just, if you were saying, hey I want

262
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,805
Speaker 4:  to eat healthier, you know, that's like a lofty, it's just kind of a

263
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:35,685
Speaker 4:  big goal. And so I, if you have years of having those

264
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:39,925
Speaker 4:  practices and recipes and it may, it's easier, but if you're getting started

265
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,965
Speaker 4:  you really wanna drill down to what does that actually look like? So all

266
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:47,005
Speaker 4:  the way down to like a grocery list, like this week I wanna eat healthy,

267
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:50,525
Speaker 4:  what am I actually gonna buy at the store and what am I gonna clear out of

268
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:53,885
Speaker 4:  my cabinet? And so that's why in the book I didn't just want these like

269
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:57,485
Speaker 4:  delegate more, you know, I feel like those are just like too big I think.

270
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:59,925
Speaker 4:  And those, those are the people on Reddit you're talking about that are like,

271
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:03,885
Speaker 4:  just put your phone away. It's like, well we almost need to trick our brain

272
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:07,885
Speaker 4:  into these like little small, you know, routines. Even with

273
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:10,965
Speaker 4:  myself, I see, you know, when I can't get something done, I talk about in

274
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:14,925
Speaker 4:  the book, that's been a really popular idea of like splitting up the task

275
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,645
Speaker 4:  into the preparation of the task and the doing of it because for some reason

276
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:22,725
Speaker 4:  I like that. Yeah. You know, setting out anything I need to do and then walking

277
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:26,645
Speaker 4:  away and then stumbling upon it the next day and saying, oh this is

278
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,565
Speaker 4:  already set out. It's like, that's such a simple thing. And so you could

279
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:33,525
Speaker 4:  just say, just do it, just bake the muffins. But you know, instead of that

280
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:36,485
Speaker 4:  I can say, okay, no I have actually a recipe something to do, I'm just gonna

281
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:40,165
Speaker 4:  set that ingredients out. And so I think it's a mix of, you know,

282
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:44,085
Speaker 4:  having the understanding why these things are important,

283
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:48,445
Speaker 4:  but then also giving yourself a break and saying yes it's very hard

284
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:52,165
Speaker 4:  to just say, put your phone away. So maybe I will take advantage of

285
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:56,245
Speaker 4:  something on my phone that turns off certain apps at a certain time just

286
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:59,325
Speaker 4:  to remind myself and maybe in three months that could be turned off and I

287
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:03,085
Speaker 4:  would have the good habits to just put my phone away. But if you never start

288
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,365
Speaker 4:  with some of those things and, and I do think the technology itself

289
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:10,245
Speaker 4:  has a lot of those features that we just don't go into, which I talk about

290
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:13,605
Speaker 4:  in the tools chapters, you know, like You can choose, here are the 10 people

291
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,645
Speaker 4:  I wanna get email notifications from after hours and that

292
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:20,805
Speaker 4:  can be a setting and no one takes the time to set that up again. We default

293
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:24,685
Speaker 4:  into, oh you know, there was a office wide email about the

294
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:28,365
Speaker 4:  carnival going on and I open my phone at nine to see it. You know, so it's,

295
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:32,485
Speaker 4:  we really just have to either take the time to set up rules

296
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:36,045
Speaker 4:  for ourself, set up the rules and the technology itself, but then knowing

297
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:39,885
Speaker 4:  that with time we'll see the benefits of those things and say, wow, I

298
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,725
Speaker 4:  really see when I do this, it makes a big difference. And now I have that

299
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,525
Speaker 4:  as a habit in, in general.

300
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:49,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. One of the reasons I knew I wanted to have you on the show was because

301
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,805
Speaker 2:  you have a whole chapter in your book in which you just yell at people to

302
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,165
Speaker 2:  use the settings of their apps. And it's like, that's, that's a vergecast

303
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,285
Speaker 2:  thing if I've ever heard it in my entire life.

304
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:02,285
Speaker 4:  It's simple, but it's underlooked. I think, you know, I even talk about the

305
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:05,965
Speaker 4:  dishwasher thing in the book about how my father-in-law, just

306
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:10,005
Speaker 4:  it's his dishwasher is a piece of art. It's so perfectly

307
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:14,005
Speaker 4:  stacked and everything comes out clean. He gets so much in there. And when

308
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:17,005
Speaker 4:  I asked how did you learn how to do this? Like, he's like, no, the curved

309
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,965
Speaker 4:  bowls go over here. Just like, how did you know that? He's like, well I read

310
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:23,405
Speaker 4:  the manual for 10 minutes when I got the dishwasher. And it's like, how many

311
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:27,325
Speaker 4:  of us do that? No one. And, and if we run the dishwasher every single day,

312
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:30,965
Speaker 4:  imagine how much that 10 minutes of just really understanding the settings

313
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:35,205
Speaker 4:  would benefit us every single time we run the dishwasher. So, you know, With

314
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:39,045
Speaker 4:  your phone with your email, your Slack, like all these things,

315
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:43,005
Speaker 4:  the features are there, but we don't take the time to

316
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:46,245
Speaker 4:  dive into, you know, there should be like a limit. Like you can't get into

317
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:50,125
Speaker 4:  the app unless you spend 10 minutes figuring out what it

318
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:50,885
Speaker 4:  can do basically.

319
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:54,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I've spent a lot of time in recent years trying to figure out

320
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,085
Speaker 2:  whose responsibility it is to do that stuff. 'cause on the one hand,

321
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:03,165
Speaker 2:  like there are a lot of tools out there that are vastly more powerful than

322
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:07,045
Speaker 2:  almost anybody knows, right? And sometimes, like Excel is the perfect example,

323
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:10,925
Speaker 2:  right? Like if you really know how to use Excel, You can run the damn world

324
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:14,325
Speaker 2:  out of Excel. But if you don't and you just need to type a bunch of numbers

325
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:17,645
Speaker 2:  in and get the sum of those numbers, like that's fine. You don't actually

326
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:21,325
Speaker 2:  need to know how to use the tool. And so I think to force you to learn how

327
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:24,685
Speaker 2:  to do everything before you do anything is actually the wrong outcome.

328
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:29,245
Speaker 2:  But then is it excel's job to teach me as I go or

329
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,725
Speaker 2:  is that gonna be annoying? Because you get all those little pop-up tool tips

330
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:35,005
Speaker 2:  that everybody just ignores and closes anyway. So I I I don't know, part

331
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:37,845
Speaker 2:  of me wonders if this is just sort of an impossible problem to solve that

332
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:41,725
Speaker 2:  it's like how do you help me along without getting in the way

333
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:44,765
Speaker 2:  as I do the stuff that I actually need to do? 'cause I think to your point,

334
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,340
Speaker 2:  the, the other thing that's happening is like you get Slack for the first

335
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,165
Speaker 2:  time and you open Slack and there's already stuff happening. Like the,

336
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:55,205
Speaker 2:  the minute you get Slack, you are already behind and and that's

337
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:58,045
Speaker 2:  stressful, right? And so, and I think it's true with a lot of work. It's

338
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,605
Speaker 2:  like you don't download PowerPoint to learn how to use PowerPoint. You download

339
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:03,885
Speaker 2:  PowerPoint because you owe somebody a deck, right? And so I think the, this

340
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:07,725
Speaker 2:  thing of like building the work about work into

341
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,565
Speaker 2:  the work is just really hard. And I agree with you that it's really valuable

342
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:15,205
Speaker 2:  and, and sort of whose responsibility it is to make that easier has always

343
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:18,405
Speaker 2:  been a challenge. And I think I talk to a lot of product people who can't

344
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,205
Speaker 2:  figure out how to do it. 'cause like we don't wanna get in your way. Oh,

345
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:20,285
Speaker 2:  I

346
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:23,885
Speaker 4:  Was gonna say, yeah, I work a lot with our product people and I think it's

347
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:27,125
Speaker 4:  a finding that right balance of like Google Calendar for example,

348
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,605
Speaker 4:  can tell you how much time you're spending in each type of event and give

349
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:35,165
Speaker 4:  you all this data and it's like, but if you're my mom

350
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:38,365
Speaker 4:  who's just kind of scheduling a couple one-off things on her Google calendar,

351
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,405
Speaker 4:  you know, she doesn't care about that. So I think it's, and she, it would

352
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:45,525
Speaker 4:  actually probably waste her time to see a whole tutorial of how I'm

353
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:49,405
Speaker 4:  using Google Calendar. But I think the right point to hit is maybe

354
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:53,285
Speaker 4:  if I'm changing the color of an event, you know, then they say,

355
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:57,285
Speaker 4:  okay, this person is now customizing, you know, all of their

356
00:21:57,285 --> 00:22:01,165
Speaker 4:  events and maybe they care about did you know, you can see how much time

357
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:04,685
Speaker 4:  you spend in each calendar color. You know, so that, and then, oh, and by

358
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:07,325
Speaker 4:  the way, You can click this little tutorial. So it's kind of like, where

359
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:10,525
Speaker 4:  is the right hook? You know? Or if you see somebody add one

360
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:14,325
Speaker 4:  multiple time zones, now you know, okay you're working across time zones,

361
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:17,485
Speaker 4:  did you know You can add world clock? And so you know, just finding that

362
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:21,445
Speaker 4:  right, what is the profile of the user? Where are they looking

363
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,205
Speaker 4:  for more information? And then how can you make it easy from there? Because

364
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:27,365
Speaker 4:  I totally agree, people are using the tools in so many different ways. You

365
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:31,245
Speaker 4:  don't wanna overwhelm the getting the sum in the sales person

366
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:35,365
Speaker 4:  with right, every single formula available. So I think it's, it's trying

367
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:39,125
Speaker 4:  to find that profile person and and give them the right things they need.

368
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:42,685
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break, but then we're gonna come back and we're

369
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:46,605
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about digital tools because I have too many of them on my computer

370
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:49,685
Speaker 2:  and it's time to figure out which ones to use. We'll be right back.

371
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,885
Speaker 2:  stuff that you're talking about?

372
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:50,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's a great question. I think the first thing I like to

373
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:08,325
Speaker 4:  for tools just to solve their problems, but it's really the intention

374
00:25:08,385 --> 00:25:12,085
Speaker 4:  behind the tools, it's how you're using the tools that makes the biggest

375
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:15,485
Speaker 4:  difference. And so it's thinking through that first before, again, before

376
00:25:15,485 --> 00:25:16,565
Speaker 4:  you just dive into the tool.

377
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:20,445
Speaker 2:  Okay, well as someone who uses every tool and expects them all to solve my

378
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:24,405
Speaker 2:  problems, I feel personally attacked by that. But, but I think

379
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:27,365
Speaker 2:  that makes sense to me. And I think the idea of

380
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:31,765
Speaker 2:  having one thing that you treat as sort of your main

381
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:35,645
Speaker 2:  communication system is, is really smart, right?

382
00:25:35,645 --> 00:25:39,325
Speaker 4:  It telling people is the next step. So if people chat me or

383
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:42,885
Speaker 4:  say, Hey, can I grab time on your calendar? I usually say, Hey, do you mind

384
00:25:43,485 --> 00:25:46,765
Speaker 4:  starting with email and then we'll go from there. And so it's just a gentle

385
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:50,205
Speaker 4:  nudge putting it, you know, and of course I still meet and chat with people,

386
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:54,045
Speaker 4:  but it's just, hey, this is where I prefer communication and it just makes

387
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:57,805
Speaker 4:  it a lot easier on you. 'cause I always say if you have like 12 places

388
00:25:57,945 --> 00:26:01,125
Speaker 4:  to check for things you need to do, think about if you went out to your street

389
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:04,805
Speaker 4:  and you had like 12 mailboxes, it's like you'd have to go to every single

390
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:08,685
Speaker 4:  one and be like, is there a bill in here? Is this all advertisement? So by

391
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:12,445
Speaker 4:  having less places to check, it gives our brain a little bit

392
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:16,285
Speaker 4:  less stress. So if yours is Slack, then you've funneled people there and

393
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:19,925
Speaker 4:  your brain thinks, okay, if I check here, I'm pretty much good, you know,

394
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:23,125
Speaker 4:  I gotta look other places, but people know, look for me here. And that can

395
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:23,605
Speaker 4:  help a lot.

396
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:28,125
Speaker 2:  What do you tell people who are like, I wanna do chat

397
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:31,685
Speaker 2:  or I want to do email, or I really believe in meetings but my

398
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:35,965
Speaker 2:  boss is different and that's not up to

399
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:39,565
Speaker 2:  me. Like Yeah, I, I do think the, the one thing I hear a lot from people

400
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:43,300
Speaker 2:  who are sort of mad at productivity culture is they're like this, this all

401
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,805
Speaker 2:  sounds great for people who are completely in charge of their own life and

402
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:48,285
Speaker 2:  schedule. Yeah. And that's just not most people, right? Yeah. Like most people

403
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:52,205
Speaker 2:  have a job where someone else tells them more or

404
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:55,805
Speaker 2:  less where to be and what to do and how to communicate all the time. And

405
00:26:56,485 --> 00:26:59,005
Speaker 2:  I, I think it's, it's easy in that moment to just kind of throw your hands

406
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:02,245
Speaker 2:  up and be like, well I'm not in charge, there's nothing I can do about it.

407
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:04,885
Speaker 2:  But I'm curious, I mean most of the people you talk to I think are are fairly

408
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:08,285
Speaker 2:  senior, but like they have bosses. What do you tell those people? Is the

409
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:09,645
Speaker 2:  job just to kind of adapt?

410
00:27:10,235 --> 00:27:14,205
Speaker 4:  Well I think now I coach executives, but I mean in my 14 years

411
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:18,005
Speaker 4:  at Google I've coached, you know, all levels and I've also been all

412
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:21,365
Speaker 4:  levels, I've been what I call the sandwich level, which is I have people

413
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:25,125
Speaker 4:  reporting to me, I'm reporting to people, you know, I'm not the executive

414
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:29,005
Speaker 4:  who's making all the decisions. And so I, I try to include in the

415
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:32,965
Speaker 4:  book those things that I still teach in my scalable learnings that are

416
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:37,365
Speaker 4:  more directed at what you're talking about. And I think when I had that,

417
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:41,845
Speaker 4:  I prefer email since I also had a manager who

418
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:46,125
Speaker 4:  exclusively chatted. You know, that was the only way he was gonna communicate

419
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,975
Speaker 4:  with me. And so I think that what I talk about the whole book is

420
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:54,415
Speaker 4:  even 80 20 is gonna make a huge difference. Like if everybody who's coming

421
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:58,375
Speaker 4:  to me and says, Hey, can you do a coffee chat? And I say, Hey, can you

422
00:27:58,535 --> 00:28:01,775
Speaker 4:  actually send an email first? But then I say, you know, I always pick three

423
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:05,295
Speaker 4:  people that can chat me no matter what. And it's usually like my boss, my

424
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:08,215
Speaker 4:  boss's boss, and maybe like a cross-functional partner that I'm working with.

425
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:12,135
Speaker 4:  Sure. If they chat me, I'm not going to say, well I prefer email. But

426
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:15,655
Speaker 4:  if I've done that with everybody on my team,

427
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:20,135
Speaker 4:  then now I've still shifted, you know, most of my energy into the

428
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:23,055
Speaker 4:  right place. So same thing, you know, if you make this perfect schedule that

429
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:26,495
Speaker 4:  you wanted to fall this way, you know, you can't tell your manager, Hey,

430
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,855
Speaker 4:  I can't meet during this time, that's my power hours. But you know,

431
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:31,535
Speaker 4:  if you've set aside, that's

432
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:32,415
Speaker 2:  My designated walk time.

433
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:36,575
Speaker 4:  Exactly right. But if you've done that with everyone else, you

434
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:40,335
Speaker 4:  know, if you have no plan then it'll never fall a plan. But if you have some

435
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:44,055
Speaker 4:  plan, it'll at least fall some and you feel a difference with

436
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:47,535
Speaker 4:  some, you know, you feel a big difference with saying, so I think sometimes

437
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:50,495
Speaker 4:  people just throw up their arms and say, well I don't have control over my

438
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,855
Speaker 4:  meetings and I don't have control over this. But no matter what your level,

439
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:57,855
Speaker 4:  there still is something you have control over. You know, and,

440
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,935
Speaker 4:  and that's the only lever You can really pull.

441
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:04,095
Speaker 2:  Where is the science right now on kind of energy

442
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:08,175
Speaker 2:  flows and how we're starting to understand when people are and are not

443
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:12,015
Speaker 2:  productive? Because again, I think it's, it's pretty obviously a

444
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:15,455
Speaker 2:  personal thing, but also it seems like there's an increasing body of research

445
00:29:15,455 --> 00:29:19,415
Speaker 2:  that says everyone has that kind of cycle

446
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:23,255
Speaker 2:  that you're describing and we can attack those cycles with different

447
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:26,455
Speaker 2:  systems in different places. Like how well do we kind of understand

448
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,375
Speaker 2:  what peak productivity looks like for people?

449
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:33,055
Speaker 4:  Yeah, weirdly, I feel like a lot of the studies that have been happening,

450
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:36,535
Speaker 4:  like almost started with sleep. So like those natural

451
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:40,575
Speaker 4:  circadian rhythms of like how are we sleeping, when are we resting? And

452
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:44,325
Speaker 4:  then one of my favorite books is by Daniel Pink called When. And I feel like

453
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:48,125
Speaker 4:  he really started talking about, okay, but how does that

454
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:51,845
Speaker 4:  apply to productivity? You know? And so how do we take those rhythms that

455
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:55,805
Speaker 4:  we know about ourselves and say I'm just somebody who sits down at

456
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:59,645
Speaker 4:  eight in the morning and does not feel like jumping into the day or

457
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:02,925
Speaker 4:  you know, I'm a person who naturally gets an afternoon lull. And of course

458
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:06,725
Speaker 4:  it's very personal and I would say that if you talk to the a hundred last

459
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:10,725
Speaker 4:  people that I coached, I would say this would be the top answer of the

460
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:14,645
Speaker 4:  one thing they took away and, and immediately applied and made the

461
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:18,525
Speaker 4:  biggest difference. Because not all time slots are created equally. And

462
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,365
Speaker 4:  I think that we look at our schedule and we say, okay, I need 30 minutes

463
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:25,165
Speaker 4:  tomorrow. I need an hour to work on something. So for me,

464
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:29,205
Speaker 4:  blocking nine to 10 is so different than blocking four to five.

465
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:32,645
Speaker 4:  It's totally different. I'm gonna feel different in that moment. I'm gonna

466
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:36,125
Speaker 4:  produce different work, you know, and so I, I'm gonna be in different

467
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:40,565
Speaker 4:  energies. And so just knowing that small thing about myself can help me shift

468
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:44,565
Speaker 4:  just a couple things so that I can do it where it feels right, but it

469
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:48,125
Speaker 4:  doesn't just mean, hey, I'm focused two or three hours of the day. That's,

470
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,005
Speaker 4:  that's my day.

471
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:52,885
Speaker 2:  Is your experience that most people, when you ask them about that,

472
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,685
Speaker 2:  can self-assess pretty quickly?

473
00:30:56,465 --> 00:31:00,325
Speaker 4:  No. Okay. I think they can say things like, I'm not

474
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,685
Speaker 4:  really a morning person or I'm a bit of a night owl, or

475
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:08,285
Speaker 4:  I like to do, I find myself not wanting to do this work

476
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:11,685
Speaker 4:  at this time. You know, it's kind of these like little snippets. But if I

477
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,685
Speaker 4:  say, Hey, what are two or three hours a day that you do your best heads down,

478
00:31:14,685 --> 00:31:18,365
Speaker 4:  focus strategic work. Not a lot of people have like that exact

479
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:22,245
Speaker 4:  answer. So, but it's so fun to uncover it with people because

480
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:25,245
Speaker 4:  you know, it can be as simple as, okay, just keep a little post-it and when

481
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:28,405
Speaker 4:  you're feeling your best, write down what time it is. Some of the conditions,

482
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:31,405
Speaker 4:  you know, this goes back to working from home, working in the office kind

483
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:34,285
Speaker 4:  of thing. Just what are some of those patterns you're noticing? Well, oh,

484
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:38,005
Speaker 4:  every time I'm working from home and it's, you know, one woman I loved, she

485
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:41,005
Speaker 4:  noticed it was like 10 to one every day she would write down, I'm feeling

486
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:43,965
Speaker 4:  really focused. Well then when she was in the office, she was taking a break

487
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:47,885
Speaker 4:  every day at noon to eat lunch and she was like, you know what, I actually,

488
00:31:47,885 --> 00:31:51,565
Speaker 4:  that's like one of my best hours of the day and I'm just eating lunch, so

489
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:55,365
Speaker 4:  what if I shift some of my lunches to 1:00 PM and squeeze that extra hour

490
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:59,165
Speaker 4:  out of my best time? And that's just such a small change and such a small

491
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:02,005
Speaker 4:  thing she noticed. But now she's getting back like three hours of the week

492
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:05,565
Speaker 4:  of focus time just from shifting lunch and knowing that about herself. So

493
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:08,405
Speaker 4:  I think that people have those general

494
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:13,485
Speaker 4:  nuggets, but they haven't actually thought through what is my

495
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:17,365
Speaker 4:  ideal two to three hours. And you know, it can be from sometimes getting

496
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,685
Speaker 4:  yourself thinking about it can say, Hey, if you had these things to do tomorrow,

497
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:23,965
Speaker 4:  some focus things that just require you like build a new presentation or

498
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:27,925
Speaker 4:  write something and you had no meetings, no commitment, no

499
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:31,885
Speaker 4:  structure to your day at all, how would you set it up for tomorrow?

500
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:35,805
Speaker 4:  So that's when You can get the sense if they're like, well I'd wake up kind

501
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:39,645
Speaker 4:  of late and you know, then I'd do this for a while and

502
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:43,525
Speaker 4:  then I might take a break and work out. And then now, okay, now I can

503
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:46,085
Speaker 4:  tell you're kind of more of an afternoon person. 'cause you haven't ever

504
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:49,005
Speaker 4:  said, you know, then you have people who are like, well I wake up at five

505
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:52,965
Speaker 4:  and I'd start right away. And you know, so it's like those little nuggets

506
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:56,725
Speaker 4:  can help you figure out, okay, they're airing on this side or this side and,

507
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,205
Speaker 4:  and figure it out for,

508
00:32:59,265 --> 00:33:02,485
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

509
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:05,765
Speaker 2:  we have a few more things to talk about. Some apps, some ai, we'll be right

510
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:05,965
Speaker 2:  back.

511
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:42,375
Speaker 2:  will make everything easy forever. And not actually just doing the thing

512
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:45,655
Speaker 2:  that would've taken me less time to go get done. And there's tons of tools

513
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:48,535
Speaker 2:  out there being built for this stuff, right? You can build an incredibly

514
00:34:48,765 --> 00:34:52,695
Speaker 2:  complex web of notes and personal knowledge management is a thing. And

515
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:56,295
Speaker 2:  we can talk about Zeel Caston for hours, but I wonder if at the end of the

516
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:59,455
Speaker 2:  day you're spending a lot of time with these people being like, just write

517
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:03,455
Speaker 2:  a list. Like is that where we need to land? So much of what you're talking

518
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:03,695
Speaker 2:  about

519
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:54,125
Speaker 4:  thinking about your dryer, like your inbox and you know, you have all these

520
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:58,045
Speaker 4:  laundry baskets of things you need to do. So that's my system

521
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:03,045
Speaker 4:  that can actually be then applied to any email program. I

522
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:06,965
Speaker 4:  happen to think Gmail does it best because I worked on that. But I think

523
00:36:07,115 --> 00:36:11,005
Speaker 4:  it's then saying, okay, I have this system for email

524
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:14,805
Speaker 4:  or I have this system for capturing things I'm thinking about and getting

525
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,565
Speaker 4:  them to a, to-do list. Now that I open the tool instead of looking at the

526
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:22,445
Speaker 4:  tool to solve all of those things of the system, how can

527
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:26,125
Speaker 4:  the tool support the system that I've created in my head and then

528
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:30,085
Speaker 4:  sometimes enhance it like, like things like my ability to add things to my,

529
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:34,045
Speaker 4:  to-do list using my voice on Google Keep. It's like

530
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:37,965
Speaker 4:  that is a tool-based feature that's amazing and helps me keep up

531
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:41,325
Speaker 4:  with the system that I started on paper, you know, and I used to have to

532
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:44,645
Speaker 4:  run to my paper and write something down, which is inefficient. But instead

533
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:47,405
Speaker 4:  of kind of logging into the tool and saying, what are you gonna do for me?

534
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:51,525
Speaker 4:  Having that behind the scenes, like this is how I wanna think about email,

535
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:54,565
Speaker 4:  this is how I wanna capture. So that's why I try to make those

536
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:55,765
Speaker 4:  systems

537
00:36:57,525 --> 00:37:00,985
Speaker 4:  for people so that they can say like, Hey, this is how an idea, when you

538
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,745
Speaker 4:  get an idea, this is how it should travel until it's actually executed. You

539
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:08,465
Speaker 4:  know, you're on a run, you think of something, you know what tool can get

540
00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:12,065
Speaker 4:  it outta your head, what tool are you looking at to put it in a group of

541
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:15,385
Speaker 4:  things to do when you're at your computer, when are you actually scheduling

542
00:37:15,385 --> 00:37:19,185
Speaker 4:  the time to do that in a calendar and then executing. And so

543
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:23,505
Speaker 4:  I think everyone's different, but the way that you're talking does make

544
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:27,185
Speaker 4:  me feel like you have a lot of focus on tools. Whereas some people,

545
00:37:27,465 --> 00:37:31,185
Speaker 4:  I feel the opposite where it's like, hey, you know, some of the stuff you're

546
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:34,745
Speaker 4:  doing with paper and pencil can really be enhanced with some of these tools.

547
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:38,545
Speaker 4:  So let's see if we can just shift, you know, I work with a lot of teams that

548
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:41,985
Speaker 4:  are global and you know, they're trying to do asynchronous

549
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:45,105
Speaker 4:  communication about priorities and there is a lot of benefit and things like

550
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:48,265
Speaker 4:  Google Docs and you know, we're all working on the same time in the middle

551
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:51,065
Speaker 4:  of the night you're here, I'm adding priorities. So, you know, that would

552
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:54,825
Speaker 4:  be impossible if you're not using a tool like that. So I think

553
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:58,705
Speaker 4:  in some ways you can go too far one direction,

554
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:03,145
Speaker 4:  but it does feel really nice to always have that sense of,

555
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:07,385
Speaker 4:  hey, if this tool was ripped from me right now, I'd be able

556
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,985
Speaker 4:  to replicate this system because it's mine, it's not the tools, you know?

557
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:12,705
Speaker 4:  So I think that's a good place to start.

558
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:16,225
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I I am curious about the voice thing because

559
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:20,105
Speaker 2:  I was all prepared to have a fight with you about pen and paper versus digital

560
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:21,785
Speaker 2:  tools. Where

561
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:22,865
Speaker 4:  Do you stand? Let's go.

562
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:27,145
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm fully digital tools. Okay. But only

563
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:31,625
Speaker 2:  I, I was, I, I'm less mad at your approach because I

564
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:34,825
Speaker 2:  love the idea of making a list and then taking a picture of it on your phone.

565
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:39,005
Speaker 2:  I think that is like a, an extremely clever middle ground of

566
00:38:39,435 --> 00:38:42,925
Speaker 2:  like the, the science on when you write by hand you remember it better seems

567
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:47,405
Speaker 2:  just unshakeable. Like that just is true. My handwriting is trash and

568
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,605
Speaker 2:  I mostly can't read it, which is a bit of a problem. But, but I think that

569
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:53,725
Speaker 2:  there is something too that, but for me it's always been just like the, the

570
00:38:53,725 --> 00:38:57,325
Speaker 2:  availability of my phone in particular is just untouchable

571
00:38:57,515 --> 00:39:01,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Compared to everything else. But I'm, I'm really curious particularly

572
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:04,045
Speaker 2:  because you're, you're an advocate for pen and paper, but you're also an

573
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:07,765
Speaker 2:  advocate for voice dictation and I'm curious about both of those things and

574
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:10,245
Speaker 2:  how you can push them together. Yes.

575
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:13,365
Speaker 4:  That's a great question. I think it's just an advocate for whatever gets

576
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:16,485
Speaker 4:  you excited because you're only gonna stick with a system that you like and

577
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:20,445
Speaker 4:  use, which kind of goes back to your customizable question. So I like pen

578
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:24,165
Speaker 4:  and paper because I like writing in pretty colored

579
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:28,405
Speaker 4:  pens and I have good handwriting, you know, that I like to, to decorate

580
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:32,325
Speaker 4:  August and make it, you know, all fun. So it's like,

581
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:33,085
Speaker 4:  that's more fun to me.

582
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,445
Speaker 2:  So you're the one I see like all over Instagram showing the beautiful bullet

583
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:37,285
Speaker 2:  journals and that kind of stuff?

584
00:39:37,285 --> 00:39:40,325
Speaker 4:  No, no. Like that's, no, I don't have time for that. Just, that's, that's

585
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:43,965
Speaker 4:  why I kind of pick a lane where it's like I'm gonna have one thing that I,

586
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,645
Speaker 4:  that I keep going back to. That's my list, my what I call my main list. and

587
00:39:47,645 --> 00:39:50,685
Speaker 4:  it's just, you know, if you came to me and you're like, what's everything

588
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:54,605
Speaker 4:  that you not personal you and work you, you Laura have to do?

589
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:57,645
Speaker 4:  I would have a list, okay, these are all the returns I need to do, these

590
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,365
Speaker 4:  are all the things for my kids' summer camp, this is everything I have to

591
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,805
Speaker 4:  do at work. These are all things I need to buy. Like, those are all in one

592
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:07,365
Speaker 4:  place. And, and I like having that kind of one touch point where I write

593
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:11,285
Speaker 4:  everything like that out. Could this just as easily be a, a digital list?

594
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:15,805
Speaker 4:  Yes. But it's not as fun for my brain. So, you know, I think it's just a

595
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:19,565
Speaker 4:  personal thing, but it's more important to have something that you're

596
00:40:19,565 --> 00:40:23,085
Speaker 4:  consistently using. And the capture thing, I talked to one productivity

597
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:27,285
Speaker 4:  expert on his podcast and he said he has a little, he has like 20

598
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:31,245
Speaker 4:  little journals that he brings everywhere and instead of

599
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:34,565
Speaker 4:  using voice dictation, he just always has a little journal in any pocket

600
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:37,925
Speaker 4:  of any pants. And he writes down all these things that come to him. So it's

601
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:38,685
Speaker 4:  just so funny because

602
00:40:38,705 --> 00:40:42,285
Speaker 2:  He, that's my nightmare. I would never get anything, I would never remember

603
00:40:42,505 --> 00:40:43,605
Speaker 2:  one thing. Me too.

604
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:47,165
Speaker 4:  Then every day at the end of the day he takes 20 little journals and deposits

605
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:51,045
Speaker 4:  them into like a bank box and then he goes through each little journal.

606
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:55,085
Speaker 4:  So, but the point is the little journals give him joy, they work for him.

607
00:40:55,155 --> 00:40:58,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You know, that's, so for me, the dictation, I think a lot of times

608
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:02,845
Speaker 4:  I get those ideas in the shower on a drive, on a walk, you

609
00:41:02,845 --> 00:41:06,445
Speaker 4:  know, when I don't wanna pick up my device. So the dictation helps with that.

610
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:10,525
Speaker 4:  But him and I essentially have the same system if you

611
00:41:10,525 --> 00:41:13,285
Speaker 4:  think about it. It's just, we're doing it in different ways, so.

612
00:41:13,795 --> 00:41:17,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, and it feels like spiritually the process there is is not that

613
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:19,965
Speaker 2:  different from the way you were talking about communication, right? Where

614
00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:21,965
Speaker 2:  it's, it's less about having

615
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:27,245
Speaker 2:  this sort of one specific thing work one specific way and more about

616
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,485
Speaker 2:  having things that work for you. But like most importantly, not having very

617
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:35,365
Speaker 2:  many of them. Right. Which is a, a thing I had not really thought about

618
00:41:35,395 --> 00:41:38,765
Speaker 2:  that. Like the, the problem with living the way that I live, which is

619
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:42,605
Speaker 2:  between a thousand different productivity apps, is that universe running

620
00:41:42,745 --> 00:41:46,725
Speaker 2:  is. And so I spent an enormous amount of time collating all the stuff in

621
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:49,605
Speaker 2:  all the places to try and make sense out of everything. And there's something

622
00:41:50,245 --> 00:41:53,685
Speaker 2:  e even in your case where you're like, you, you have, you, you get stuff

623
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:57,165
Speaker 2:  on the one list that then goes onto the other list that's still only two

624
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:01,045
Speaker 2:  places. And that's that I feel like, and I would expect for a lot of the

625
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:03,445
Speaker 2:  folks that you're meeting with, like they have so many things in so many

626
00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:07,285
Speaker 2:  places and just the act of having all of your things in fewer places seems

627
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:08,485
Speaker 2:  like it goes a really long way.

628
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:12,285
Speaker 4:  Yes. If you're like, I'm so overwhelmed, I can only do one thing, what should

629
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:16,165
Speaker 4:  it be? I always recommend just making this main list from all your

630
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:19,965
Speaker 4:  lists, from all the 12. It sounds like you have 12 mailboxes. So just saying,

631
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:23,645
Speaker 4:  okay, I got all the mail out, I've, I've taken my brain and said, no, these

632
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:26,765
Speaker 4:  are in these categories things I need to buy, things I need to do, things

633
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:30,565
Speaker 4:  I need to put on my website. You know, whatever those are. Even if you haven't

634
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:34,685
Speaker 4:  actually done any of them, it feels like, ah, okay, I've

635
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:38,605
Speaker 4:  got a dashboard because then I can make decisions based on

636
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:42,325
Speaker 4:  that. I know, wow. I, my main list is blowing up right now. I,

637
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:45,965
Speaker 4:  I've gotta make more time for these personal things. 'cause it's the beginning

638
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:49,205
Speaker 4:  of the school, you know, like, I need more than Sunday night to do some of

639
00:42:49,205 --> 00:42:52,765
Speaker 4:  these personal computer things or I have a lot going on at work, I'm gonna

640
00:42:52,765 --> 00:42:55,925
Speaker 4:  need to start saying no to things personally because I really need to make

641
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:59,885
Speaker 4:  more time for this. So it just gives you that constant gauge of what's

642
00:42:59,885 --> 00:43:03,805
Speaker 4:  going on, you know, instead of trying to do the math on each of your

643
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:07,725
Speaker 4:  tools and say, you know, the tools, but sometimes the tools work for

644
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:11,605
Speaker 4:  people. So I think it's just, you know, how are you feeling using them

645
00:43:11,745 --> 00:43:12,685
Speaker 4:  is the biggest question.

646
00:43:13,235 --> 00:43:16,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that makes sense. So real quick, I'm gonna let you go here in a minute,

647
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:18,605
Speaker 2:  but I, I wanna talk about downtime and we've talked a little bit about this,

648
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:22,005
Speaker 2:  the, the sort of needing downtime in order for Uptime to be a thing

649
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:26,565
Speaker 2:  and to be successful. And I think right now

650
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:31,045
Speaker 2:  we think of downtime so much as like, you know, the joke is I go from

651
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:34,365
Speaker 2:  the big screen to the small screen while I watch the biggest screen and that's,

652
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:38,285
Speaker 2:  that's how I relax now. And and I think part of what you

653
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:40,805
Speaker 2:  advocate for is like finding more

654
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:45,705
Speaker 2:  pockets of like space, right? And you talk a lot about focus and,

655
00:43:45,845 --> 00:43:49,545
Speaker 2:  and kind of disconnecting and pulling back. And I, I would assume

656
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:52,425
Speaker 2:  again for a lot of the people that you coach at Google and a lot of the people

657
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:55,985
Speaker 2:  who've read your book and things like that, the idea of like when my

658
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:59,025
Speaker 2:  downtime is I sit and scroll TikTok for an hour, which is a certain kind

659
00:43:59,025 --> 00:44:02,025
Speaker 2:  of downtime, but it's not solving the problem that you're talking about.

660
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:06,305
Speaker 2:  It's like how do you coach people through how to not scroll

661
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:09,825
Speaker 2:  TikTok for an hour? And again, it goes back a little bit to that discipline

662
00:44:09,825 --> 00:44:12,505
Speaker 2:  of just like, don't just, just don't scroll TikTok for an hour. But yeah,

663
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:15,345
Speaker 2:  I think one of the theories I have is that one of the reasons walks have

664
00:44:15,345 --> 00:44:18,465
Speaker 2:  become so popular is that it is, it is a thing to do, right? and it's like,

665
00:44:18,895 --> 00:44:22,665
Speaker 2:  it's not just don't look at a screen, it's go do something else.

666
00:44:22,665 --> 00:44:25,705
Speaker 2:  Right. And so like is that, is that the kind of advice you give folks is

667
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:29,305
Speaker 2:  sort of redirect that focus to something better? Or like how do you talk

668
00:44:29,305 --> 00:44:29,785
Speaker 2:  people through that?

669
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:32,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, like what you're talking about is kind of the crowding out method.

670
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:36,525
Speaker 4:  Like You can't scroll TikTok if you're doing something else. So I even do

671
00:44:36,525 --> 00:44:40,405
Speaker 4:  that, you know, with my kids. It's like if you want screen time first you

672
00:44:40,405 --> 00:44:43,485
Speaker 4:  need to play outside for an hour. And it's like by the time they're outside

673
00:44:43,485 --> 00:44:45,965
Speaker 4:  for an hour, they're having so much fun and playing and then, you know, so

674
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:49,845
Speaker 4:  redirecting the focus. But I think it's starting small

675
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:54,405
Speaker 4:  realistic ways before you're diving

676
00:44:54,555 --> 00:44:58,165
Speaker 4:  into some big, every night I'm doing this or I'm never scrolling.

677
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:02,045
Speaker 4:  TikTok. And like you said, I think there are some benefits

678
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:04,965
Speaker 4:  of scrolling TikTok. Maybe you enjoy the content, maybe you're getting something

679
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:08,525
Speaker 4:  out of that. But you know, I made a rule for myself that

680
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:12,845
Speaker 4:  I am not going to scroll on my phone and watch

681
00:45:12,905 --> 00:45:16,605
Speaker 4:  TV at the same time. And so if there's a show I wanna watch or something

682
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:20,245
Speaker 4:  or you know, something, I wanna go watch or look at it, it kind of makes

683
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:24,125
Speaker 4:  me have to decide again the attention piece. Well, do I wanna sit here and

684
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:27,725
Speaker 4:  scroll or do I wanna watch this show? You know, I have to now

685
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,285
Speaker 4:  decide, sometimes I'm like, no, I wanted to look for new recipes today, so

686
00:45:31,305 --> 00:45:35,165
Speaker 4:  I'm actually am gonna look on here. But then I'm kind of done. And I think

687
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,965
Speaker 4:  that having some structure, so one challenge I started,

688
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:41,965
Speaker 4:  which I talked about the, in the book, which has been so popular, is the

689
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:45,405
Speaker 4:  No Tech Tuesday Night Challenge. So again, it was a small thing.

690
00:45:46,065 --> 00:45:49,205
Speaker 4:  Not everyone wants to give up technology every night, but let's just say

691
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:53,405
Speaker 4:  one night a week from dinner to bedtime, could you give

692
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:56,805
Speaker 4:  up technology? You know, one night for five weeks, six weeks.

693
00:45:57,225 --> 00:46:00,565
Speaker 4:  And so thousands of people started signing up for it. I really did it to

694
00:46:00,565 --> 00:46:04,005
Speaker 4:  keep myself accountable. 'cause I was like, if I tell all these people I'm

695
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:07,925
Speaker 4:  doing this and I don't, I'll be so embarrassed. So let's make it kind

696
00:46:07,925 --> 00:46:11,885
Speaker 4:  of a big challenge. So, but what now has gone on

697
00:46:11,885 --> 00:46:15,725
Speaker 4:  for five years and, and it's been this huge success. But what's so interesting

698
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:19,565
Speaker 4:  is looking at the feedback, you kind of think it's gonna be, oh, I,

699
00:46:19,685 --> 00:46:23,445
Speaker 4:  I felt so good during that downtime. You know, so like

700
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:27,005
Speaker 4:  I was, you know, really relaxed off my phone. But it ends up being these

701
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:30,925
Speaker 4:  longer term things like I slept so much better. Like

702
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:34,005
Speaker 4:  I, I have a, you know, watch that keeps track of my sleep cycles and it was

703
00:46:34,005 --> 00:46:37,805
Speaker 4:  the best night of sleep I get all week is Tuesday night. So then the biggest

704
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:41,245
Speaker 4:  piece of feedback that I thought was so interesting, which just kind of proves

705
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:44,845
Speaker 4:  my point of the whole book is I am so much

706
00:46:44,995 --> 00:46:48,285
Speaker 4:  more focused and productive on Wednesday

707
00:46:48,955 --> 00:46:52,885
Speaker 4:  because I took Tuesday night off. And so I think that that's

708
00:46:52,885 --> 00:46:55,885
Speaker 4:  where people have that aha moment and then they stick with it every Tuesday

709
00:46:56,025 --> 00:46:59,965
Speaker 4:  all year, or they start doing two or three nights a week, or they start

710
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:02,925
Speaker 4:  doing little more adjustments saying Now I'm gonna start doing this at eight

711
00:47:02,925 --> 00:47:06,445
Speaker 4:  o'clock every night because it made such a difference in my sleep. But if

712
00:47:06,445 --> 00:47:09,805
Speaker 4:  I had said Do it at eight o'clock every night from the start, no one would've

713
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:13,285
Speaker 4:  started. So it's about, you know, even with people I'm coaching, I just say,

714
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:17,205
Speaker 4:  Hey, if even if it's just like on my commute, I'm just gonna have silence

715
00:47:17,345 --> 00:47:21,205
Speaker 4:  for 15 minutes, you know, or I see people walk to the bathroom in the

716
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:24,685
Speaker 4:  office and still have their phone. I'm just like, that is the shortest walk.

717
00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:28,605
Speaker 4:  Like could we just use that time to decompress? And as someone

718
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:28,805
Speaker 4:  who

719
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:32,685
Speaker 2:  Is very guilty of both watching TikTok while I make

720
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:36,165
Speaker 2:  coffee in the morning and taking my phone to the bathroom, I feel like I'm

721
00:47:36,205 --> 00:47:36,805
Speaker 2:  learning a lot right now.

722
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:40,885
Speaker 4:  Well see, for someone like you, it's just about like, I was really bad about

723
00:47:40,885 --> 00:47:43,965
Speaker 4:  waking up and looking at my phone right away and then I just realized unless

724
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:47,605
Speaker 4:  I'm sending emails at six 30 in the morning, like why am I going to do this?

725
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:51,445
Speaker 4:  Nothing's gonna happen between six 30 and seven. And so I

726
00:47:51,545 --> 00:47:55,325
Speaker 4:  had to start putting my phone outside my room and then it was like,

727
00:47:55,385 --> 00:47:58,485
Speaker 4:  now if my phone's in my room, I still don't look at it 'cause it's such a

728
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:02,005
Speaker 4:  habit. But it's, you know, it's hard to trust yourself that you're gonna

729
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:05,805
Speaker 4:  wanna do that or do that. And so having little tiny habits

730
00:48:06,115 --> 00:48:10,045
Speaker 4:  like No Tech Tuesday or like just setting your phone and then you start

731
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:14,245
Speaker 4:  sitting there and making your coffee and realize, wow, this is actually relaxing.

732
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:18,365
Speaker 4:  Makes you want to scroll less. You know? So I think it's just gradual and

733
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:22,405
Speaker 4:  any amount of change is helpful, but an overhaul is unrealistic. I think

734
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:23,965
Speaker 4:  that's where people go wrong sometimes.

735
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:28,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I agree. All right, I've kept you too long. I have one more thing I

736
00:48:28,445 --> 00:48:30,285
Speaker 2:  wanna talk about. Do you have, do you have five more minutes? Yeah, yeah.

737
00:48:30,315 --> 00:48:34,205
Speaker 2:  Okay. I wanna talk about AI before we go. Yes. Which we can do very quickly

738
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:38,365
Speaker 2:  'cause it's a super small topic. Yeah, it's fine. I, I do think

739
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:42,485
Speaker 2:  the, the like bull case for AI says

740
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:45,685
Speaker 2:  that it can do a lot for a lot of the stuff you're talking about, right?

741
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:49,445
Speaker 2:  Not just like write emails and help you do some of that stuff more quickly.

742
00:48:49,545 --> 00:48:53,205
Speaker 2:  But like you talk a lot about sort of bridging different ideas and pulling

743
00:48:53,205 --> 00:48:56,205
Speaker 2:  stuff together and part of the work is like

744
00:48:56,595 --> 00:48:59,685
Speaker 2:  collating all the information going on inside of your head and part of the

745
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:03,245
Speaker 2:  promise of AI is that it can start to do some of that stuff for you, right?

746
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:05,925
Speaker 2:  That it, it can teach you how to use these tools so you don't have to muck

747
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:09,685
Speaker 2:  around in settings so much. It can make sense of all of your ideas for you.

748
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:13,965
Speaker 2:  Like do you think of AI as kind of a key part of what you're

749
00:49:13,965 --> 00:49:16,605
Speaker 2:  gonna be working on and coaching people on in the next few years?

750
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:20,325
Speaker 4:  Yes, it already is. Definitely is really, I think I, I'm glad you brought

751
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:23,205
Speaker 4:  it up 'cause I meant to mention it when you were talking about some of that

752
00:49:23,205 --> 00:49:26,885
Speaker 4:  automation of tools and I think that the first

753
00:49:27,035 --> 00:49:30,685
Speaker 4:  tool that's really come around that I think can replicate some of these or

754
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:34,605
Speaker 4:  create some of these backend systems that I'm talking about is

755
00:49:34,825 --> 00:49:38,805
Speaker 4:  ai. I think that AI right now is at that level of,

756
00:49:39,115 --> 00:49:42,405
Speaker 4:  okay, these are the tasks that I know I need for my system and then I'm gonna

757
00:49:42,405 --> 00:49:46,365
Speaker 4:  get AI to help with those tasks. I think where

758
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:50,355
Speaker 4:  we're going is AI knows what tasks I need for my

759
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:53,675
Speaker 4:  system and AI helps with those tasks. Or for example,

760
00:49:54,515 --> 00:49:58,355
Speaker 4:  I have an idea and I put it on my capture list

761
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:02,315
Speaker 4:  and by the time I get back to my desk it's already on my part of

762
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:05,675
Speaker 4:  my main list that I want it to be. You know, so kind of that next level of

763
00:50:05,975 --> 00:50:09,755
Speaker 4:  taking the systems and making it totally easier for me

764
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,955
Speaker 4:  and just questions about, you know, maybe AI will be able to tell us

765
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:18,395
Speaker 4:  what are my power hours? You know, can you tell how many times I'm switching

766
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:22,435
Speaker 4:  tabs or when my output is best or when I'm, you know, going to TikTok

767
00:50:22,495 --> 00:50:26,315
Speaker 4:  too many times, you know, how it, it might be able to give us some of that

768
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,670
Speaker 4:  information about our own productivity, whether it's hours and meetings,

769
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,445
Speaker 4:  who we're meeting with, which platform do I prefer? Am I responding to emails

770
00:50:33,445 --> 00:50:36,685
Speaker 4:  faster than I'm accepting meeting invites, you know, whatever that is. So

771
00:50:36,725 --> 00:50:40,325
Speaker 4:  I think that it's just getting more and more exciting right now. It's kind

772
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:44,205
Speaker 4:  of that helpful tool, but I think it's gonna be one step ahead of us

773
00:50:44,425 --> 00:50:48,085
Speaker 4:  in figuring out our own productivity and kind of bringing it all together.

774
00:50:48,785 --> 00:50:52,605
Speaker 4:  And it's a fun time to be in productivity I would say, because it's just,

775
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:56,605
Speaker 4:  it's cool to see what a difference it's already made and I feel like we're

776
00:50:56,605 --> 00:51:00,325
Speaker 4:  just at the tip of where it's going and I work super closely with

777
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:04,525
Speaker 4:  our Gemini product managers on just like what is the

778
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:08,805
Speaker 4:  ultimate productivity things that this tool could do and how can we get

779
00:51:08,805 --> 00:51:09,525
Speaker 4:  there? Yeah.

780
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,685
Speaker 2:  So talk me through kind of the the North Star you're thinking about because

781
00:51:12,725 --> 00:51:15,405
Speaker 2:  I think, yeah, you just brought up a couple of different versions of it that

782
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,965
Speaker 2:  I think are interesting. The one is like I say something to

783
00:51:19,305 --> 00:51:23,045
Speaker 2:  my device, it recognizes it as a to-do and it puts it on my list, right?

784
00:51:23,365 --> 00:51:27,045
Speaker 2:  That's very useful and very accomplishable, right? Like I think it

785
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:30,645
Speaker 2:  most tools will do that pretty soon and we're already like every meeting

786
00:51:30,705 --> 00:51:34,525
Speaker 2:  now is like, there's some app that will take your action items and

787
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:37,445
Speaker 2:  shove it into your to-do list. I actually, I think that's great. But then

788
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:41,285
Speaker 2:  there are all these tools out there that are like the, the sort of AI

789
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:45,285
Speaker 2:  calendars where you, you put a bunch of stuff in and it'll try to organize

790
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:49,165
Speaker 2:  your days for you based on all of the stuff that you need to get done and

791
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:52,565
Speaker 2:  kind of the optimal flow like you're talking about. I'm skeptical of that

792
00:51:52,565 --> 00:51:55,805
Speaker 2:  stuff now because my experience has just been that it doesn't seem to actually

793
00:51:55,805 --> 00:51:59,605
Speaker 2:  work all that well. But that is the sort of thing that might get better

794
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:03,285
Speaker 2:  as technology gets better. But I'm, I'm curious like as you think about fast

795
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:06,365
Speaker 2:  forward a few years and this tech keeps getting better and like, do you think

796
00:52:06,365 --> 00:52:10,245
Speaker 2:  of AI as kind of, I just sort of yell at my

797
00:52:10,245 --> 00:52:13,045
Speaker 2:  system all day and then it kind of goes and accomplishes everything on my

798
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:16,525
Speaker 2:  behalf? Or is it like you're talking about kind of the, the great engine

799
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:20,285
Speaker 2:  of like insights and summarization and then I'm still on the hook to actually

800
00:52:20,285 --> 00:52:23,125
Speaker 2:  like make the most out of that stuff? Like where does this sort of land in

801
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:23,365
Speaker 2:  the process?

802
00:52:23,795 --> 00:52:26,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's a good question. I think it's always gonna be

803
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:32,225
Speaker 4:  how am I powering some of these things that

804
00:52:32,405 --> 00:52:36,225
Speaker 4:  AI is doing for me? And so to your point about the calendar piece, it's like

805
00:52:37,165 --> 00:52:40,745
Speaker 4:  unless I tell the calendar I'm very

806
00:52:40,745 --> 00:52:44,145
Speaker 4:  productive between nine and 11 and that's when I like to do focus time,

807
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:48,825
Speaker 4:  how is it really gonna optimize for that? So I feel like that personal

808
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:51,945
Speaker 4:  knowledge of your own patterns and things like that still starts with you

809
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,745
Speaker 4:  now I think of it kind of like an intern, like what things

810
00:52:55,885 --> 00:52:59,785
Speaker 4:  can I assign? But I think ultimately it will become more of that like

811
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:03,505
Speaker 4:  assistant business partner, you know, with me

812
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:07,545
Speaker 4:  where it's like we're both thinking on the same level and bouncing off of

813
00:53:07,545 --> 00:53:11,385
Speaker 4:  each other to make these great results. Whereas I think currently

814
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:15,345
Speaker 4:  we're in more of the what can, what am I doing that I can assign, which that's

815
00:53:15,345 --> 00:53:18,305
Speaker 4:  what I always tell people if you're kind of like, where do I start with ai,

816
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:21,865
Speaker 4:  take a look at your to-do list and just circle three things that

817
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:26,245
Speaker 4:  you might be able to delegate to AI and just try it. Because I think a lot

818
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:30,045
Speaker 4:  of people get that like blank screen nervousness for sure. Just like

819
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:33,405
Speaker 4:  what do I put in here? But you know, I talk about summarizing,

820
00:53:33,435 --> 00:53:37,325
Speaker 4:  brainstorming, planning, you know, those are kind of like the key buckets.

821
00:53:37,565 --> 00:53:41,245
Speaker 4:  Researching And, if you can just start with those and then

822
00:53:41,725 --> 00:53:44,765
Speaker 4:  I think it will become that next level

823
00:53:45,595 --> 00:53:48,925
Speaker 4:  partnership with us. You know, not, not solving

824
00:53:49,255 --> 00:53:52,885
Speaker 4:  everything we have to do and not us yelling at it, but just like

825
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:57,125
Speaker 4:  this understands what I'm thinking, how I'm doing it

826
00:53:57,185 --> 00:54:00,525
Speaker 4:  and give, gives me, most importantly the time, the downtime

827
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:05,005
Speaker 4:  to come up with the next level things because I'm not spending

828
00:54:05,005 --> 00:54:08,005
Speaker 4:  hours sorting through comments. And so I think that's, that's the coolest

829
00:54:08,035 --> 00:54:08,725
Speaker 4:  part about it.

830
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:13,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I have to say from intern to assistant to business partner

831
00:54:13,145 --> 00:54:17,085
Speaker 2:  is one of the best summations of the path of AI that I think I've ever

832
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:19,245
Speaker 2:  heard. That's very good. That's very

833
00:54:19,245 --> 00:54:22,885
