Description: This week on The Vergecast, guest host Mia Sato talks to YouTube fitness pioneer Cassey Ho (better known as Blogilates) about the well-oiled machine that is the dupe economy. Ho shares her experience creating her own line of athletic wear that sooner or later gets ripped off by countless copycats — and how she tries to fight back. 

Then, Mia brings an audio diary from a visit to Fabscrap, a textile recycling facility in Brooklyn, that is working to save fabric and other materials from the landfill. Fashion is a wasteful industry, not unlike tech — luckily, there are people like Fabscrap staff and volunteers who are working towards solutions.

Finally, Victoria Song swings by to help answer a hotline question about how to make the high-tech Clueless closet a reality. If you have a question for us, call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com.

00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:06,955
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of knocking off other

3
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:10,755
Speaker 2:  people's work and selling it for $2. I'm your host, Mia Sato.

4
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:14,755
Speaker 2:  And today we're talking about knockoffs and waste. Two big

5
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:18,315
Speaker 2:  problems in the fashion industry. Whenever a design goes viral, the

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,395
Speaker 2:  copycats are close behind. Today I'm going to talk with an

7
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:26,075
Speaker 2:  OG fitness YouTuber, Cassie Ho, better known as tis

8
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:30,315
Speaker 2:  about how she fights the ES of her products. Another result

9
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:34,235
Speaker 2:  of the ultra fast fashion cycle is a lot of textile waste.

10
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:38,435
Speaker 2:  I visited a textile recycling plant in Brooklyn, New York

11
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:42,595
Speaker 2:  to find out how they save textiles from the landfill. And finally,

12
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:46,675
Speaker 2:  if you're into fashion like me, you probably wish you had the clueless

13
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:50,635
Speaker 2:  closet. We'll have Vong to take a listener question about how to make

14
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:54,155
Speaker 2:  that a reality. All that is coming up. But first I have to go

15
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:57,595
Speaker 2:  maximize shareholder value in an ad break. We'll be right back.

16
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:45,425
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. The internet is built on repetition and

17
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:48,985
Speaker 2:  copying, and now that same dynamic has

18
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:52,385
Speaker 2:  permeated our real lives as well. A photo will go viral

19
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:56,585
Speaker 2:  and thousands of lookalike products will follow, often sold

20
00:02:56,695 --> 00:03:00,605
Speaker 2:  from faceless, nameless companies. Cassie Ho built a fitness

21
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:04,645
Speaker 2:  empire on YouTube. She now has her own line of athletic wear

22
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:08,795
Speaker 2:  that's prime material for dupes. Cassie, you've

23
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:12,355
Speaker 2:  been online a long time, so tell us who you are and what you do.

24
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,905
Speaker 6:  All right. My name is Cassie Ho, but I may be better

25
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,785
Speaker 6:  known as Blogilates. I started my YouTube channel in

26
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:24,585
Speaker 6:  2009 teaching free fitness workouts and it's been a

27
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:28,225
Speaker 6:  long time. I can't believe it's 2025 now, but I am still

28
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:31,905
Speaker 6:  online. But my content has changed a little bit. You know, it

29
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:35,745
Speaker 6:  transformed from free fitness, horizontal long form videos

30
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,985
Speaker 6:  to now vertical short form where I'm teaching people about

31
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:43,425
Speaker 6:  the why behind my designs. I run

32
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:47,825
Speaker 6:  a very rapidly growing active wear and

33
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:51,585
Speaker 6:  apparel company called Pop Flex and we just

34
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:55,585
Speaker 6:  started our second brand, launched our second brand blog, a lotti at Target

35
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:59,025
Speaker 6:  earlier this year. So my life is all about

36
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:03,065
Speaker 6:  innovation design and it's just been really, really fun

37
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:03,985
Speaker 6:  to build this company.

38
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,985
Speaker 2:  And I just wanna like clarify for anyone who doesn't know that Cassie is

39
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:11,265
Speaker 2:  like an OG blueprint fitness

40
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:15,385
Speaker 2:  blogger, like I remember watching Cassie's videos when I was

41
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:18,785
Speaker 2:  a teenager. So it was kind of surreal to talk with you about something that

42
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:22,425
Speaker 2:  is kind of, you know, related but different. So you've been building Pop

43
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:26,425
Speaker 2:  Flex Active, you have this blog lots deal with Target, and obviously

44
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:29,705
Speaker 2:  you share a lot of like behind the scenes stuff and development with your

45
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:33,745
Speaker 2:  fans online, on, on social. Do you remember the

46
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:37,425
Speaker 2:  first time that you saw something, whether that was online or in store and

47
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:40,345
Speaker 2:  you were like, wait a minute, I, I designed this.

48
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:44,945
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean I designed this very

49
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:49,145
Speaker 6:  specific score called the Pirouette score in 2021. And I remember as I

50
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:53,025
Speaker 6:  was designing it, I told my husband who's also my business partner, I

51
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:56,825
Speaker 6:  said, she's gonna take this one. I just knew it. I had a feeling. We

52
00:04:57,065 --> 00:05:00,625
Speaker 6:  released the design, it goes viral and three months later,

53
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:04,505
Speaker 6:  guess who takes it? It's she. And so that was a whole

54
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:08,865
Speaker 6:  situation. I made a big post about it. The us she and president reached out

55
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:12,905
Speaker 6:  to me and wanted to speak because his daughter was a fan of tis and

56
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:16,025
Speaker 6:  came into his room yelling, being like, oh my God, what did you do Cassie?

57
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:20,345
Speaker 6:  And I'm very grateful for her because we ended up talking and

58
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:24,265
Speaker 6:  even though he and she and promised that this wasn't going to

59
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:27,585
Speaker 6:  happen again, surely enough in another three months

60
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:31,745
Speaker 6:  another dupe of the pirouette squirt shows up. And since

61
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:35,345
Speaker 6:  then there's been multiples over a dozen

62
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:39,145
Speaker 6:  different designs from Pop Flex stolen by Sheen. But also since

63
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:42,505
Speaker 6:  then I've been granted the U-S-P-T-O design patent for

64
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:46,665
Speaker 6:  that specific squirt, which has helped protect it in some ways.

65
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:50,665
Speaker 6:  But at the same time it's been extremely frustrating because the lack

66
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:54,705
Speaker 6:  of enforcement from the government to help innovators and

67
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:58,445
Speaker 6:  inventors, designers protect their creative work

68
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:02,365
Speaker 6:  makes it almost impossible sometimes to go up against these

69
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:07,125
Speaker 6:  Goliaths when I'm this small David. But you know, I

70
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,725
Speaker 6:  keep speaking up because it is unfair to be taken

71
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:14,645
Speaker 6:  advantage of and at least I have a platform from which to speak, whereas

72
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:18,565
Speaker 6:  a lot of independent designers may not. So when I do this, I speak

73
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,325
Speaker 6:  for all of us.

74
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:24,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, And I want like to just sort of describe the skirt a

75
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:27,605
Speaker 2:  little bit. I have a skirt in the other room that I bought for the story

76
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:31,485
Speaker 2:  that I was working on, but it's like a unique type of active wear. It's like

77
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,645
Speaker 2:  kind of lilac, well the one I have is lilac, but it comes in a bunch of colors.

78
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:39,765
Speaker 2:  It has several tears of mesh skirting shorts

79
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:43,005
Speaker 2:  underneath. But what else makes a design special where you were like, I know

80
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,445
Speaker 2:  that this is so special that someone will knock it off.

81
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:49,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so the thing with Pop Flex with me and all of my designs is

82
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:53,165
Speaker 6:  I had this element of just like romance

83
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:57,605
Speaker 6:  to every design because that's who I am. And so I love when

84
00:06:57,605 --> 00:07:01,365
Speaker 6:  there's this intersection of fashion and functionality and innovation

85
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:05,325
Speaker 6:  altogether in one. So you get this beautiful twirl little

86
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,525
Speaker 6:  mesh score with tears and then you also get the

87
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,485
Speaker 6:  functionality of a drawstring, the cinch in your waist a little bit. Of course

88
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:16,605
Speaker 6:  no front seam for no camel toe pockets on the side so that you don't have

89
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:20,485
Speaker 6:  to carry a purse if you don't want to. Which I, I don't really. And so

90
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:24,805
Speaker 6:  this score was so unique. I had never seen anything like it on the

91
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:28,685
Speaker 6:  market before, which is also why the U-S-P-T-O granted me the patent for

92
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:32,565
Speaker 6:  it, which is extremely hard to get, but like so exciting that I was able

93
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:35,885
Speaker 6:  to get it. And then wildly enough,

94
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:39,725
Speaker 6:  a couple years after the shehan incident,

95
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:43,285
Speaker 6:  Taylor Swift ends up wearing it in 2024

96
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,965
Speaker 6:  and then the court goes crazy viral. So viral

97
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:51,925
Speaker 6:  that you know, our, our sales go up insanely, but at the same time the

98
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:55,965
Speaker 6:  dupes get out of control because now everyone has

99
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:59,445
Speaker 6:  seen it. And since then it's been so wild.

100
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:03,205
Speaker 6:  There's been over 2065 different

101
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:06,405
Speaker 6:  infringements on my designs since the Sheen one.

102
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:10,205
Speaker 6:  It's insane. And it is game of Whack-a-Mole.

103
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:14,165
Speaker 2:  And is that just a drop in the bucket? Do you feel like you're getting a

104
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,805
Speaker 2:  lot of these dupes that are floating around?

105
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:20,045
Speaker 6:  I mean I think we're getting some of them. I don't think I'm getting all

106
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,805
Speaker 6:  of them. It's nearly impossible. You know, I have

107
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:27,005
Speaker 6:  almost two full-time people constantly

108
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:32,125
Speaker 6:  typing in these forms to take down these infringing listings.

109
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:36,245
Speaker 6:  And it's so frustrating because it takes so much time to take down a

110
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:40,125
Speaker 6:  listing that's if the platform even like decides to believe in you that day.

111
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:43,085
Speaker 6:  I feel like sometimes the rules are just changing all the time depending

112
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:47,045
Speaker 6:  on who's reading these forms. That's with, with the platform, they have

113
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:50,365
Speaker 6:  a place for you at least to type in the form, right? But then when it comes

114
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:54,045
Speaker 6:  to these larger multi-billion dollar

115
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,925
Speaker 6:  companies, which is something that just recently happened within the past

116
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:00,925
Speaker 6:  few months, and I'm talking about the Nordstrom's, the Kohls,

117
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:04,725
Speaker 6:  the JC Penney's, the Macy's, the Victoria's Secrets, the TJ Max's and Marshalls,

118
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:09,165
Speaker 6:  now they all have dupes of either this court or other

119
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:12,605
Speaker 6:  patented products. And with them it becomes a game of

120
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,485
Speaker 6:  money, right? Who can pay their lawyers more to

121
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:20,805
Speaker 6:  shut the other person down to overwhelm the entire out the other person.

122
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:25,285
Speaker 6:  And so when I talk about being a David versus a Goliath, this is

123
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:28,525
Speaker 6:  exactly what it is except I'm one David against

124
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:32,685
Speaker 6:  several Goliaths now. And it's just so frustrating that these are

125
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:37,245
Speaker 6:  American corporations, we're all supposed to be abiding by the same

126
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:41,085
Speaker 6:  law, but there's no governmental enforcement to

127
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:45,125
Speaker 6:  help me enforce the law. So it's just been

128
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,685
Speaker 6:  so frustrating and that's why I keep speaking up about it because there is

129
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:51,845
Speaker 6:  also the court of public opinion and social media,

130
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:56,445
Speaker 6:  but when it comes to money, they obviously have the billions that I do not.

131
00:09:57,115 --> 00:10:00,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I wanted to ask like where are these dupes popping up? Are there certain

132
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,805
Speaker 2:  sites that like every single day you know there's going to be another

133
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:08,285
Speaker 2:  lookalike product from as yours? Or are there some sites where like it's

134
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:11,485
Speaker 2:  shown up once and then you kind of knocked it out and then they didn't try

135
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,365
Speaker 2:  it again, but like where are you seeing the dupes?

136
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:17,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah, the biggest culprits are TikTok shop, Amazon

137
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:21,605
Speaker 6:  Temu, Ali Express, Alibaba, and

138
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:26,085
Speaker 6:  she, and of course, but I feel like everything is coming from

139
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:31,405
Speaker 6:  probably these third party sellers buying from Ali Express or Alibaba

140
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:35,125
Speaker 6:  because some of these, they look exactly the same, but they're under different

141
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,085
Speaker 6:  vendor names. So trying to attack the ALI sources is

142
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:42,445
Speaker 6:  the best, but it is a constant game of whack-a-mole. It's insane.

143
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:46,445
Speaker 6:  And I also see do influencer as a whole

144
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:50,085
Speaker 6:  category, especially with the affiliate links that they have. Like

145
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:54,485
Speaker 6:  it's multiplying like a virus. It's really bad right now.

146
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:59,125
Speaker 6:  We will actually gift influencers, the real pople

147
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:02,885
Speaker 6:  obviously. But there was an incident where we noticed that this

148
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:06,205
Speaker 6:  particular influencer was then promoting the dupe

149
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:10,565
Speaker 6:  and linking to it with an affiliate link. And so, you know, the internal

150
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:13,325
Speaker 6:  team was like talking about it like how do we deal with this? This is so

151
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:17,285
Speaker 6:  weird. And so we crafted a response that was very much like,

152
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:19,925
Speaker 6:  hey, I don't know if you've like seen Cassie's stories and stuff. It was

153
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:23,885
Speaker 6:  very much like an educational response and like we, we hoped that

154
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:27,365
Speaker 6:  you can continue to wear the real one. And so that particular influencer

155
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:30,605
Speaker 6:  was very sorry. She didn't realize what was going on. And so she was fine.

156
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:34,245
Speaker 6:  We've had other influencers where they'll promote a dupe, we'll reach out

157
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:38,125
Speaker 6:  and offer to send them a free one of the real one and some have

158
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,285
Speaker 6:  been gracious and accept it and some will just straight up ignore us

159
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,245
Speaker 6:  because they know that they can sell the do, but maybe they can't sell the

160
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:49,085
Speaker 6:  original version. So it's a tough place out there. But all I can say is that

161
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,725
Speaker 6:  I can lead with love and education, but what people

162
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:55,685
Speaker 6:  decide to do is what they decide to do. And I don't have control over that.

163
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:59,685
Speaker 2:  That's absolutely wild. Like I have to say. That is

164
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:03,805
Speaker 2:  really, really wild. It feels like, you know, because the

165
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:07,645
Speaker 2:  dupes are constantly popping up on platform after platform, like

166
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:11,565
Speaker 2:  there's always that affiliate money theoretically, right? Like

167
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:15,205
Speaker 2:  dangling in front of them. Even if one Amazon listing gets removed, you can

168
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:18,445
Speaker 2:  just link to a new one. So it, it really feels like, I think you used the

169
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,325
Speaker 2:  term Whack-a-Mole.

170
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:23,685
Speaker 6:  Whack-a-Mole. It is absolutely whack-a-mole. And like we also have affiliate

171
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:26,965
Speaker 6:  links to pop flags, but I understand that there is that

172
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:28,885
Speaker 6:  dupe customer.

173
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:34,645
Speaker 2:  How many dupes does your team go after in like a month? Let's say

174
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:39,085
Speaker 6:  Just this year it's been an average of 600 a month. Wow. So

175
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,765
Speaker 6:  it's gone insane in 2025.

176
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:46,365
Speaker 2:  And when these are showing up on these platforms, are they using your

177
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:50,085
Speaker 2:  photos? Are they taking their own product photos? Like what do the listings

178
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:50,685
Speaker 2:  actually look like?

179
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:55,125
Speaker 6:  It's a mixture of everything. So in the beginning it was a lot of

180
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:59,045
Speaker 6:  just taking photos from our website and then because

181
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:02,925
Speaker 6:  we were able to take down listings based on copyright infringement, they

182
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:06,605
Speaker 6:  then used AI to change the model's faces even though it was

183
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:10,605
Speaker 6:  still obviously the same photo. So that made it

184
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:14,285
Speaker 6:  really hard for straight up like copyright infringement. So we had to prove

185
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:17,645
Speaker 6:  in different ways that no, this is actually our photo, but manipulated. Then

186
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:21,725
Speaker 6:  it turned into them stealing my content and posting it, for

187
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:25,645
Speaker 6:  example, as a TikTok commercial, which would then link over to a drop

188
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:29,605
Speaker 6:  shipping website, which also had the photos stolen from our website. So what

189
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:33,285
Speaker 6:  ends up happening is that a fan or a

190
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:36,685
Speaker 6:  potential customer will think it's me because clearly it's my content

191
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:40,365
Speaker 6:  linking to a place with our photos, they buy it, they get something that's

192
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:43,925
Speaker 6:  really bad quality because obviously, and then they end

193
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:48,045
Speaker 6:  up coming back to my page and blaming me for bad quality, slow

194
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:52,085
Speaker 6:  shipping and all this stuff that is not my product. So when it comes to duping,

195
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:56,125
Speaker 6:  oftentimes people are like, oh well but you should be grateful for the free

196
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,365
Speaker 6:  marketing or whatever. And it's like, no, actually they have duped the customer

197
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:03,365
Speaker 6:  so hard that not only do they blame me for bad product, in

198
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:06,925
Speaker 6:  some cases fans have dmd me and said like, oh is ha

199
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:11,165
Speaker 6:  your sub-brand because they've copied the marketing not

200
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:14,925
Speaker 6:  just of me, right? But the marketing of them hiring

201
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:18,725
Speaker 6:  a model with my body type shooting in a bedroom that looks like mine

202
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,005
Speaker 6:  to the point where people think it is my company because they're,

203
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:26,925
Speaker 6:  they like, I have such a way of doing my marketing. So the

204
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:30,725
Speaker 6:  duping has gone so insane and so deep that

205
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:35,205
Speaker 6:  it's not beneficial at all for anyone who's trying to say that it's absolutely

206
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:39,165
Speaker 6:  harmful and tarnishing the brand. The other thing is once you start

207
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:42,405
Speaker 6:  seeing all these dupes everywhere that aren't mine,

208
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:47,085
Speaker 6:  it kind of saturates the market. People become tired or

209
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:51,005
Speaker 6:  sick of seeing this thing. But the thing is it wasn't the original thing,

210
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:54,965
Speaker 6:  it's everywhere because it's also the fake thing. So it also devalues the

211
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:58,725
Speaker 6:  novelty and the specialness of the original design and that's extremely

212
00:14:59,005 --> 00:14:59,285
Speaker 6:  frustrating.

213
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:03,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah, there are so many weird levels of like lookalikes

214
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,125
Speaker 2:  happening in that example you gave, there's like obviously the lookalike

215
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:10,085
Speaker 2:  product, there's the lookalike model, there's the lookalike house, there's

216
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,245
Speaker 2:  a look of like photo shoot, like I'm, it's like breaking my brain just thinking

217
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,365
Speaker 2:  about like how deep this goes.

218
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,605
Speaker 6:  It goes really deep and people don't know. And even when I try to explain

219
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:21,365
Speaker 6:  to them that they can't really understand and you don't really understand

220
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:25,165
Speaker 6:  until you've gone through it yourself. But yeah, it goes too deep and, and

221
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:28,765
Speaker 6:  the consumer, I mean I don't even blame them for not knowing

222
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:32,885
Speaker 6:  if someone's duping you this hard, how are you supposed to even get out of

223
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:33,045
Speaker 6:  that?

224
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:37,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I know if you've posted about one really wild example where like your

225
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:41,085
Speaker 2:  face was sort of like face swapped in some way and it was your

226
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:44,165
Speaker 2:  video, but your, the face was different. Can you talk about that a little

227
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:44,285
Speaker 2:  bit?

228
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:48,965
Speaker 6:  This one just brought chills throughout my body when

229
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,085
Speaker 6:  I found this video I was like, wait,

230
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:56,925
Speaker 6:  that's literally my house, my body.

231
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:01,365
Speaker 6:  But now the face is a face of a Caucasian woman. And I was like,

232
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:05,325
Speaker 6:  what? And for everyone listening who's not watching this? I am Vietnamese

233
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:09,125
Speaker 6:  and Chinese. So that was very unsettling to see. And

234
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,685
Speaker 6:  again, because if the platform is using an AI

235
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:16,325
Speaker 6:  tool, right, to check if this is copyright infringement, they're gonna be

236
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:19,965
Speaker 6:  like, no, the face is different. But it's obviously the, it's taken from

237
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:23,485
Speaker 6:  a source, which is mine. And in so many ways,

238
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:27,965
Speaker 6:  just duping in general has been so dangerous for, you know, small

239
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:32,045
Speaker 6:  business owners, creatives, but women as well. And I've seen

240
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:35,485
Speaker 6:  a lot of influencers have their faces taken mouths

241
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:39,605
Speaker 6:  manipulated to sell something that they never even spoke about. And it gets

242
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:43,365
Speaker 6:  even dirtier and deeper than that when it comes to certain

243
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,565
Speaker 6:  websites that, you know, certain people are visiting for

244
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:50,525
Speaker 6:  certain types of videos. I think you know what I'm talking about and it's

245
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:54,485
Speaker 6:  a, it's a lot of ai, I don't know, violence I suppose,

246
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:56,525
Speaker 6:  against women too. And that, that's just a whole nother topic.

247
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:02,085
Speaker 2:  I'm curious if you've ever purchased a dupe of one of your products and what

248
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:03,125
Speaker 2:  was that dupe like?

249
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:07,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I have purchased the sheen dupe

250
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:10,645
Speaker 6:  'cause I just wanted to see what it looked like. It was horrendous quality.

251
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,645
Speaker 6:  The mesh was kind of rough. I believe that one had a front seam still.

252
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:18,685
Speaker 6:  I don't even know if it had pockets, I'm not sure. But I just needed to have

253
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:22,325
Speaker 6:  one in my hand so I knew. But more recently I

254
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:26,245
Speaker 6:  got a dupe from TJ Maxx and Marshall's because

255
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:30,285
Speaker 6:  a fan had gone shopping and alerted me that there were

256
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:34,365
Speaker 6:  racks full of pure, we score dupes. And when I compared it side by

257
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:37,805
Speaker 6:  side, I knew for sure that they had

258
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:41,645
Speaker 6:  my score, my original score in hand because there were details on that score

259
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:45,645
Speaker 6:  that you can't see from the online photos. You can only see it if you, you

260
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:49,405
Speaker 6:  have it in hand. For example, we have this specific bar tack tack in the

261
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:52,965
Speaker 6:  back of her waistband to ensure that the, the drawstring doesn't fall out

262
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:56,845
Speaker 6:  in the wash. You can't see that on the photo that was there. Even

263
00:17:56,865 --> 00:18:00,845
Speaker 6:  the shape of the end cap at the end of the drawstring was exactly

264
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:01,525
Speaker 6:  the same.

265
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:06,365
Speaker 2:  I wanna switch gears a little bit and talk about like, you know, a lot of

266
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:10,325
Speaker 2:  the discourse around dupes ends up actually kind of

267
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:14,285
Speaker 2:  maybe spiraling in other directions into sometimes a discussion of class

268
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:17,765
Speaker 2:  or what people can afford and you know, there are a lot of shoppers who say,

269
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:21,005
Speaker 2:  well we deserve a cheaper alternative because it's not our fault. We can't

270
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:24,125
Speaker 2:  afford the original or we don't want to pay for the original. What do you

271
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,485
Speaker 2:  make of that kind of like discussion?

272
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:31,085
Speaker 6:  Look, I understand because I grew up shopping at

273
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:35,365
Speaker 6:  the Ross's and buying everything on clearance. We never

274
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,565
Speaker 6:  bought anything full price. Okay. However,

275
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:43,205
Speaker 6:  in this day and age, you know, you also have so many

276
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,805
Speaker 6:  different ways to get clothing. There's

277
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:50,405
Speaker 6:  thrifting, of course there's clearance racks, there's also sample sales.

278
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:54,165
Speaker 6:  Like we just had our sample sale where you can get the original score,

279
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,445
Speaker 6:  the original pople, anything at a literal

280
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:01,605
Speaker 6:  fraction of the price. And we had people lining up around the block to

281
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:06,045
Speaker 6:  go purchase this. And so there are different ways

282
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:10,085
Speaker 6:  to do this without supporting

283
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:14,125
Speaker 6:  thievery because that's what it is. And like I, I understand like not being

284
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,565
Speaker 6:  able to afford something and that's why I came out with the blog Pilates

285
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:21,365
Speaker 6:  line at Target, which is a more affordable price point for

286
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,645
Speaker 6:  something still designed by me, still designed by Cassie Ho. And

287
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:29,885
Speaker 6:  so I feel like with those like alternatives, why do we have to

288
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:33,845
Speaker 6:  go and buy the dupe? Why do we need to do that? Because you're only

289
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:38,125
Speaker 6:  hurting someone. And I just feel like that's a, like I can

290
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,725
Speaker 6:  understand where that argument comes from, but there's also alternatives

291
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:44,965
Speaker 6:  and I've tried to offer solutions so that you don't have to.

292
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:49,085
Speaker 2:  Mm. And I'm curious like how you feel as someone

293
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:53,005
Speaker 2:  whose creative work went into this product. Like when you see

294
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:56,285
Speaker 2:  a dupe, I guess you feel like your creative work is being

295
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:57,365
Speaker 2:  devalued.

296
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:02,245
Speaker 6:  When I see a dupe, I feel like it's my stolen property. I feel like someone

297
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:06,165
Speaker 6:  went into my house and stole something from my closet. Like that

298
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:10,045
Speaker 6:  is literally what it feels like. Except multiply that and see it

299
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:13,805
Speaker 6:  also morphed into something uglier. Like that's really, really weird. And

300
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,805
Speaker 6:  because I spend anywhere between one and a half to

301
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:21,485
Speaker 6:  three years on one design, these are my

302
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:25,325
Speaker 6:  babies. It's not just like a thing that I'm throwing out

303
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:29,125
Speaker 6:  there. There's love and passion and soul in every single

304
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,965
Speaker 6:  one of these And look like if somebody can't spend

305
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,885
Speaker 6:  the time to design their own creation, then maybe

306
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:40,965
Speaker 6:  do we talk about a royalty situation? Like it's like I'm not trying to

307
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:43,965
Speaker 6:  keep this away from anyone, it's, but it's just like, but don't steal it

308
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:47,765
Speaker 6:  from me either. This has to be done in a

309
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:51,925
Speaker 6:  business partnership type way. You can't just steal, that's not

310
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:52,085
Speaker 6:  fair.

311
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:57,325
Speaker 2:  Fashion obviously is a pretty wasteful industry

312
00:20:57,585 --> 00:21:01,285
Speaker 2:  and humans are buying more clothes than maybe ever before

313
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:05,005
Speaker 2:  in the history of humanity. How do you as like a designer

314
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:09,085
Speaker 2:  and a business owner make sure that what you sell will last a really

315
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:12,645
Speaker 2:  long time? That people will love it. How do you convince shoppers that,

316
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:16,085
Speaker 2:  you know, spending a little bit more to buy the original is worth it for

317
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:16,165
Speaker 2:  them?

318
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so look, the quality of an item

319
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:24,685
Speaker 6:  is going to be how long does this last? Right? That's the sustainability

320
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:27,845
Speaker 6:  of an item. Now I will say at the beginning of this conversation right here

321
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:31,885
Speaker 6:  about sustainability, that the best way to be sustainable is to

322
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:35,645
Speaker 6:  not buy anything. Okay. To be like our dads who are still wearing shirts

323
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:38,765
Speaker 6:  from the eighties. Like that's the most sustainable. Now I am in the apparel

324
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,725
Speaker 6:  industry and I'm, I am creating product, but I am

325
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:46,645
Speaker 6:  choosing the best fabrics that don't break down. The

326
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:50,085
Speaker 6:  fibers don't break down in the wash after like the first one. Like it's gonna

327
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:54,045
Speaker 6:  last you like several years or more. And what we do is we

328
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:57,845
Speaker 6:  do wear testing on all different sizes. We're checking everything. It

329
00:21:57,845 --> 00:22:01,485
Speaker 6:  goes through a third party testing to ensure that this

330
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:05,085
Speaker 6:  product is really good. And here's the thing, I'm not charging

331
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:09,765
Speaker 6:  Lululemon or aloe prices, I'm also not charging sheen prices.

332
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:13,845
Speaker 6:  I'm somewhere right in the middle, but I'm giving you that same quality And

333
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:17,605
Speaker 6:  I, I'm just gonna say it like as a Lulu. So I think it's a great deal

334
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:21,805
Speaker 6:  if you're willing, I guess for certain price point people, if you're willing

335
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:25,405
Speaker 6:  to save up a little bit and buy this like one good legging instead of like

336
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:29,085
Speaker 6:  seven bad leggings, it's gonna feel so good and a lot more

337
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:30,165
Speaker 6:  sustainable when you can do that.

338
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:34,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You mentioned that you know, sometimes you spend years designing and

339
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:38,205
Speaker 2:  developing products. I wonder if you can talk about like how that compares

340
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:42,045
Speaker 2:  to the speed with which dupes kind of just are churned out.

341
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,405
Speaker 2:  Like those happen what? Like overnight?

342
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,805
Speaker 6:  Oh my god, it's insane. Okay. So like I said, I spend between one

343
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:52,605
Speaker 6:  and a half to three years designing and developing one style.

344
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:56,525
Speaker 6:  Okay. The she and Dupe came out three

345
00:22:56,645 --> 00:23:00,045
Speaker 6:  months later. That's when I found it. I don't even know

346
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:04,965
Speaker 6:  when it actually came up, but I would not be surprised.

347
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:08,725
Speaker 6:  And I've like read it in different places that sometimes dupes can come out

348
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:12,805
Speaker 6:  in as little as like three to seven days, like based on whoever

349
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:16,725
Speaker 6:  this manufacturer is because they might just have stock mesh on hand,

350
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:20,645
Speaker 6:  they may have stock whatever on hand and they just, I don't even know

351
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:23,965
Speaker 6:  how the supply chain works for fast fashion. I, I, I can't even comprehend

352
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:27,845
Speaker 6:  it because for me it's like every time we develop something

353
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:31,765
Speaker 6:  we're actually like weaving the actual fabric. We we're ding the fabric that

354
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:34,685
Speaker 6:  we cut in. So, and then like there's like so much stuff that goes into it.

355
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,725
Speaker 6:  I do not know how these fast fashion companies do it. They have to have on

356
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:42,685
Speaker 6:  hand stock or something so that they can just like go. And it's funny

357
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:45,810
Speaker 6:  'cause sometimes I'll like watch these tiktoks from girls who are buying

358
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,765
Speaker 6:  from these fast fashion websites and they're getting things that don't look

359
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:51,925
Speaker 6:  like the picture. Which no doubt if you're buying a dress for $5, it's not

360
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:55,165
Speaker 6:  gonna look like this dress that you know, I saw somewhere else for 250. And

361
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:59,085
Speaker 6:  you can so tell that whoever, I don't even wanna call it a

362
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:02,685
Speaker 6:  pattern maker, but let's just say the sower was forced to copy this thing

363
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:06,165
Speaker 6:  from a photo. You can so tell that they had no idea what they were doing

364
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:09,845
Speaker 6:  because there was no time for like pattern making and developing.

365
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,805
Speaker 6:  It's just sew it, get it out. I honestly, I mean I think

366
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:16,565
Speaker 6:  you'd have to talk to someone in fast fashion to truly know because I don't

367
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:17,125
Speaker 6:  even know how that works.

368
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:21,165
Speaker 2:  Cassie, you and your team encounter dupe listings constantly.

369
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:24,445
Speaker 2:  So have you found any like tips for how

370
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:27,245
Speaker 2:  consumers can spot whether something is a dupe?

371
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:31,725
Speaker 6:  Yes. These are the things that I look out for as a consumer myself when I'm

372
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,205
Speaker 6:  shopping online. Okay. So one, if you see a listing

373
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:39,165
Speaker 6:  where the angle stays the same the whole time and as you're clicking different

374
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:42,845
Speaker 6:  colors, only the color is photoshopped and changing super red flag.

375
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:46,885
Speaker 6:  If you see a listing where all the model's heads are cut off

376
00:24:47,495 --> 00:24:51,085
Speaker 6:  super red flag, if you see that

377
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:54,605
Speaker 6:  all the photos in the listing kind of look like they're from different photo

378
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:58,365
Speaker 6:  shoots, that is also a red flag. There's just

379
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:01,925
Speaker 6:  so much you can tell from the listing

380
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:06,405
Speaker 6:  specifically the photo shoot that definitely gives me like this is a dupe

381
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:10,285
Speaker 6:  vibes and of course the price, like if the price just seems

382
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:13,445
Speaker 6:  too low to be true, likely it is.

383
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:17,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Sometimes I also will take an image that I see from

384
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:21,565
Speaker 2:  like Amazon and just throw it in Google reverse image search

385
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:25,205
Speaker 2:  to see what site it's actually from. And that's actually a really good way

386
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:28,205
Speaker 2:  to figure out like, oh this is definitely a copy of something.

387
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:32,685
Speaker 6:  Oh 100% I, I will also do that spec, like specifically if

388
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:36,325
Speaker 6:  I just can't find it And I know like this is definitely from

389
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:40,085
Speaker 6:  somewhere else. Oh, something else to check too is go

390
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:44,125
Speaker 6:  to like the returns like FAQs page and

391
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,285
Speaker 6:  if it's starting to get a little dicey, like you can't find an address or

392
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:50,485
Speaker 6:  it's from overseas or they don't allow returns or exchanges like

393
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:54,885
Speaker 6:  super duper red flag. 'cause you wanna be able to try something on

394
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:56,165
Speaker 6:  and return it if it doesn't fit.

395
00:25:56,835 --> 00:26:00,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I actually wanted to ask if you like do a lot of online shopping. Like

396
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:04,645
Speaker 2:  I am also kind of paranoid about buying stuff, especially from like new brands

397
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:08,045
Speaker 2:  that I've never tried. So do you shop online a lot?

398
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:12,285
Speaker 6:  Yes, I shop online a lot and because

399
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:16,405
Speaker 6:  women's sizing is all over the place and sometimes brands don't even pay

400
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:20,005
Speaker 6:  attention to their own size chart. What I do sometimes is I have to buy

401
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:24,085
Speaker 6:  two of everything 'cause I'm never sure I'm happy to pay the return

402
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:26,005
Speaker 6:  fee. I'll pay it. Yeah.

403
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:29,845
Speaker 2:  Have you ever gotten got by any listings where you were like, oh, I think

404
00:26:30,045 --> 00:26:33,085
Speaker 2:  I like this, I think I want this, and then it came and you were like, I was

405
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:34,565
Speaker 2:  definitely catfished.

406
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:38,125
Speaker 6:  Oh, gotten got le. Yeah,

407
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:43,045
Speaker 6:  TikTok shock. Some of my friends have been like, oh,

408
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,725
Speaker 6:  oh my God, I love TikTok shop and coupons and stuff. I'm like, ugh, I don't

409
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:50,125
Speaker 6:  know, I feel weird about this, but I kept getting an ad or like

410
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:53,805
Speaker 6:  influencers or creators talking about this, like one jumpsuit with a scrunch,

411
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:57,485
Speaker 6:  But that just make the butt look so good. And I was like, ugh, okay, fine.

412
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:01,245
Speaker 6:  It was like really late at night And I like decided to just buy it,

413
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:04,565
Speaker 6:  whatever. And you know, it came back and

414
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,765
Speaker 6:  when they sent me, I bought two things. One, they

415
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:13,445
Speaker 6:  sent the wrong thing, which was bad. And then secondly, the other thing,

416
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:18,445
Speaker 6:  the scrunch bot wasn't doing anything. And so, you know, I just, I

417
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:21,965
Speaker 6:  don't trust TikTok shop for clothing. I'm very

418
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:25,925
Speaker 6:  scared and so I'll stick to like my, my main brands that I

419
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:29,445
Speaker 6:  buy from, that I, that I know my size in. It's just too scary out there.

420
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:33,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I'm so curious if the jumpsuit with a scrunched butt, was it In

421
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:37,245
Speaker 2:  fact maybe a dupe of something else? Like a, a poorly executed dupe?

422
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:41,525
Speaker 6:  You know what, I'm not sure because that scrunch butt jumpsuit, I

423
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:45,325
Speaker 6:  see it all over Amazon. I see it on TikTok shop, I also see it with the head

424
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:49,125
Speaker 6:  cut off in certain places and then I see it on like AI models, but

425
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:52,805
Speaker 6:  I actually don't know where did that come from? Yeah,

426
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:56,045
Speaker 6:  there should be a website. I feel like someone needs to make a website called

427
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:59,965
Speaker 6:  like dupes exposed.com or something and then you could

428
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:03,085
Speaker 6:  like put a picture of the thing that you're looking at and they can show

429
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:06,205
Speaker 6:  you where the original came from. Like that would be a really, really good

430
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,125
Speaker 6:  idea for somebody out there.

431
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:11,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean I think it's really hard to just like get to the bottom of things,

432
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:14,965
Speaker 2:  right? And like track down where it started because these things

433
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:19,085
Speaker 2:  pop up in so many different corners of the internet and it's, I'm sure

434
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,245
Speaker 2:  like you can attest to this, it's impossible to track them all down. It's

435
00:28:22,245 --> 00:28:25,925
Speaker 2:  impossible to get to every customer and be like, no, no, no, this is actually

436
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:30,205
Speaker 2:  a lookalike of this other thing, right? Like there's just like, there's endless

437
00:28:30,215 --> 00:28:32,725
Speaker 2:  shelf space on the internet and someone's gotta fill it.

438
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:37,085
Speaker 6:  No, that's very true and that's why I am so vocal about

439
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:41,005
Speaker 6:  telling my story and calling out these thieves that are

440
00:28:41,005 --> 00:28:44,525
Speaker 6:  doing this because what ends up happening is that if you are able to educate

441
00:28:44,645 --> 00:28:48,445
Speaker 6:  a larger audience, then they'll also wanna help fight for you. And it's been

442
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:52,205
Speaker 6:  really cool to see us all rally together because by telling

443
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:55,565
Speaker 6:  my story, I've connected with other independent designers who are going through

444
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:59,005
Speaker 6:  the same thing. So new friendships have been brought forth there

445
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:02,765
Speaker 6:  and then, you know, I'll meet fans on the street and they'll just be like,

446
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:06,765
Speaker 6:  keep fighting, like never give up. And so it's been really, really cool because

447
00:29:06,765 --> 00:29:10,725
Speaker 6:  nobody wants a big corporate Goliath to take advantage of them.

448
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:14,005
Speaker 6:  And so I feel like we're all just helping each other and also seeing the

449
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:18,045
Speaker 6:  comments online too, underneath someone selling a dupe. Some of my

450
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:21,805
Speaker 6:  fans will call it out and like I love that and I'm just so

451
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:25,885
Speaker 6:  grateful for it because me as a singular human, I, there's no way I

452
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:26,605
Speaker 6:  could do this alone.

453
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:31,725
Speaker 2:  You have been online through many different iterations of

454
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:35,205
Speaker 2:  the internet. You've seen platforms come and go, you've seen formats come

455
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:38,485
Speaker 2:  and go, you've seen businesses come and go. You've seen creators come and

456
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,085
Speaker 2:  go. I'm sure And I keep having this experience

457
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:46,285
Speaker 2:  recently and it's really why I wanted to write about dupes where I just feel

458
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:50,245
Speaker 2:  like I'm seeing the same thing online over and over and over again.

459
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:54,405
Speaker 2:  Like it does not stop. I scroll my feed, I get like four of the same videos,

460
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:58,565
Speaker 2:  I go on Amazon or I go on other shopping platforms and

461
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:02,685
Speaker 2:  like item after item. It's just the same thing. Do you

462
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:06,605
Speaker 2:  feel, well one, I guess does that feel familiar to you? Is this your

463
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,765
Speaker 2:  experience right now of parts of the internet?

464
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:13,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean TikTok when it first started for a lot

465
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:16,485
Speaker 6:  of us in the pandemic was such a pure

466
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:20,445
Speaker 6:  and innocent, fun, quirky plays, right? Like as

467
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:24,925
Speaker 6:  any website or social media platform, when it begins, it's very much

468
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:28,125
Speaker 6:  like that, right? And now it's turned into

469
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:32,925
Speaker 6:  what feels like a vertical video, QBC, like

470
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:37,445
Speaker 6:  everyone is selling at you. It's a lot of affiliates. And when

471
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:41,165
Speaker 6:  affiliates can make their little chunk of change from their

472
00:30:41,235 --> 00:30:45,125
Speaker 6:  link and it becomes a very viable business for them, then that

473
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:48,365
Speaker 6:  ends up becoming the feed because it also helps TikTok end up making money.

474
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:51,605
Speaker 6:  And at the end of the day, like we talked about with the big corporations,

475
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:55,165
Speaker 6:  like continuing to sell my product even though they're infringing my patent,

476
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:59,245
Speaker 6:  like it's about the money. So my experience is the same

477
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:02,885
Speaker 6:  as yours. And it is frustrating to have product

478
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,525
Speaker 6:  being pushed in my face all the time when sometimes I'm, I'm just trying

479
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:09,365
Speaker 6:  to, I don't know, see a recipe, a look at the

480
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:12,205
Speaker 6:  different fish in the ocean or just like a new trend.

481
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:16,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of the same thing. But

482
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,285
Speaker 6:  yeah, it's, it's a lot of creators also

483
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:25,325
Speaker 6:  kind of mimicking other creators because they've seen what works.

484
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:29,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's starting to get really tiring online.

485
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:34,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And you know, obviously you've had your designs, your

486
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:38,405
Speaker 2:  physical goods copied. Have you had content copied

487
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:38,965
Speaker 2:  in the past?

488
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:43,005
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. When I first came out with my format

489
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:47,285
Speaker 6:  for a design video, which really tells you the why behind a design, I'll

490
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:51,165
Speaker 6:  put like, you know, I'll tug on the front seam or the lack of a front seam

491
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:54,725
Speaker 6:  and show that there's no camel to, I'll put a very specifically, I put a

492
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:58,525
Speaker 6:  water bottle in my pocket. I remember just a few months

493
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:02,445
Speaker 6:  after me doing that, I started to see that type of

494
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:06,285
Speaker 6:  video almost frame by frame with the same phrasing that I would

495
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:09,925
Speaker 6:  use like anti camel to like who says that

496
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,525
Speaker 6:  used in videos across the internet. And it made me really upset, but

497
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:18,325
Speaker 6:  of course like I don't own a video format, whatever, right? Everyone

498
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:21,725
Speaker 6:  says like, oh, imitation is the best form of lottery. Okay fine, whatever.

499
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:25,725
Speaker 6:  And it happened until it actually stopped happening because what ended up

500
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:29,045
Speaker 6:  happening that was a lot of happening in one sentence is that

501
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:33,605
Speaker 6:  I continue to innovate so I can continue to do that type of video, not just

502
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:36,405
Speaker 6:  for a legging or a biker short, but I have

503
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:40,965
Speaker 6:  rompers cargo pants, I have dresses, you know, things that

504
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:44,805
Speaker 6:  these other brands, they can only copy me on the legging because

505
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:48,725
Speaker 6:  they've only innovated so far. And so for me that actually

506
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:52,365
Speaker 6:  stopped happening, which is really great. I'm very happy. And I remember

507
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:55,965
Speaker 6:  during that time I was so upset and so sad about just being

508
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,805
Speaker 6:  copied everywhere, just like design wise, content-wise, marketing wise, like

509
00:32:59,805 --> 00:33:03,605
Speaker 6:  everything right? But my friend told me, Cassie, you have to

510
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:06,725
Speaker 6:  keep innovating, keep thinking about the future because

511
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:10,605
Speaker 6:  even though they're gonna copy you, like don't think they're gonna stop,

512
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:13,325
Speaker 6:  they're gonna keep copy you, but at least you'll always be a few steps ahead.

513
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:17,325
Speaker 6:  So never stop focusing on the innovation. And because

514
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:21,405
Speaker 6:  I've done that, I guess the copycat video is like kind of like, at

515
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:25,045
Speaker 6:  least to me now is a smaller part of my frustrations

516
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:26,285
Speaker 6:  than it was before.

517
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,845
Speaker 2:  And do you spend that time instead just like designing new products or

518
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:34,965
Speaker 2:  interacting with fans? Like what is your, what is like I guess the antidote

519
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:38,325
Speaker 2:  as someone who sees their work all over

520
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:39,725
Speaker 2:  done by someone else?

521
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:43,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean I have to pour my energy into creation, into innovation,

522
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:47,845
Speaker 6:  into design, but in this very moment, even though I don't

523
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:51,205
Speaker 6:  want to be, I am also pouring a lot of my energy

524
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:55,485
Speaker 6:  into fighting the Goliaths and getting the story out there.

525
00:33:56,325 --> 00:34:00,165
Speaker 6:  I hope one day that I won't have to do that, but

526
00:34:00,295 --> 00:34:04,085
Speaker 6:  maybe this is a part of my journey as a designer and an

527
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,805
Speaker 6:  innovator. But I think the best use of my time, And I know this

528
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:11,845
Speaker 6:  is to keep designing, but there's just a fire

529
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:15,845
Speaker 6:  inside of me And I just like can't, I won't, I won't be silenced if

530
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:20,125
Speaker 6:  someone is doing the wrong thing, not just to me, but

531
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,365
Speaker 6:  to a lot of other independent designers without a voice. And so

532
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:27,125
Speaker 6:  right now my energy is split between that and innovation.

533
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:31,125
Speaker 2:  That's Cassie Ho from Blog ATI's and Pop Flex.

534
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:36,005
Speaker 2:  After the break I have an audio diary from my trip to a Brooklyn fabric

535
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:39,885
Speaker 2:  recycling facility. This is The Vergecast, we'll see you on the other side.

536
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:40,485
Speaker 2:  landfills just like our old tech. I love fashion and

537
00:37:40,485 --> 00:37:44,045
Speaker 2:  clothes, but I wanted to know what's being done about the tremendous amount

538
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:47,765
Speaker 2:  of waste in the industry and what technological challenges

539
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:51,645
Speaker 2:  still exist for the people doing this work. Luckily, a small

540
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:55,325
Speaker 2:  fashion nonprofit has saved millions of pounds of textiles from

541
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:59,325
Speaker 2:  landfills and it's doing it in Brooklyn, New York. I went over there with

542
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:02,965
Speaker 2:  my producer Owen Grove. We made an audio diary for The Vergecast and you

543
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:05,285
Speaker 2:  can also check out video from our visit on social.

544
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:12,405
Speaker 2:  When I visit the fab Scrap warehouse in an industrial part of Brooklyn,

545
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:16,805
Speaker 2:  the first thing I notice is an enormous pile of black trash bags

546
00:38:17,315 --> 00:38:20,805
Speaker 2:  stacked up to the ceiling and taking up an entire area of the

547
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:24,725
Speaker 2:  warehouse's main room. The Fab scrap staff call this Mount

548
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:28,645
Speaker 2:  Everest. All of these bags are filled with pre-consumer

549
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:32,485
Speaker 2:  textiles, stuff like leftover fabric that never got made into clothing

550
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:35,445
Speaker 2:  or scraps of sample fabric that brands were testing out.

551
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:39,965
Speaker 12:  So all of these bags, again, are from our

552
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:40,685
Speaker 12:  brand partners.

553
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:44,885
Speaker 2:  That's Camille Tegel, co-founder and interim executive director at Fab

554
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:48,765
Speaker 2:  Scrap who's showing me around today. Fab Scrap works with brands of

555
00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:52,725
Speaker 2:  all sizes. Everyone from household names like J Crew and

556
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:56,405
Speaker 2:  Macy's, as well as more niche brands like Streetwear Company, Noah,

557
00:38:56,755 --> 00:39:00,405
Speaker 12:  They get Renumbered so that we are able

558
00:39:00,545 --> 00:39:04,405
Speaker 12:  to collect data and assign it to that number and then it's an

559
00:39:04,405 --> 00:39:07,765
Speaker 12:  easy way for us to provide data back to our brand partners.

560
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,725
Speaker 12:  So that's the biggest thing about what we do is

561
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:16,085
Speaker 12:  encouraging and educating brands to actually track their

562
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:19,765
Speaker 12:  impact and to easily analyze the numbers.

563
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:23,885
Speaker 12:  And so the types of data points we give them are total pounds that they've

564
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:27,405
Speaker 12:  saved from landfill by recycling with Fab Scrap, what percentage of their

565
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:31,525
Speaker 12:  total pounds were reused, what percentage was

566
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:35,365
Speaker 12:  recycled down cycles. And then you know, some simple

567
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:38,725
Speaker 12:  conversion metrics like the equation of

568
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:43,285
Speaker 12:  CO2, you know, saved the like

569
00:39:43,285 --> 00:39:44,285
Speaker 12:  equivalent to trees, planted

570
00:39:45,205 --> 00:39:49,045
Speaker 2:  Hundreds of fashion brands, big and small, send leftover textiles

571
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,805
Speaker 2:  to Fab. Scrap Tegel says the nonprofit receives six to

572
00:39:52,805 --> 00:39:55,485
Speaker 2:  7,000 pounds of material every week.

573
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:59,965
Speaker 12:  We actually just hit 2 million pounds. Wow. Of fabric

574
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:03,685
Speaker 12:  saved. Oh my gosh. Which is such a crazy amount. Yeah, I think a really

575
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:07,205
Speaker 12:  good visual is if you were to fill every single seat

576
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:11,325
Speaker 12:  at Madison Square Garden with a hundred pounds of fabric, that would be

577
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:14,685
Speaker 12:  2 million pounds. Oh my god. Of fabric. That's crazy. Yeah.

578
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:19,005
Speaker 2:  Fab Scraps work is limited to materials that are coming directly from their

579
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:22,525
Speaker 2:  brand partners. The millions of pounds they've saved from landfills

580
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:26,845
Speaker 2:  represents just a tiny portion of overall textile waste. They

581
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:30,205
Speaker 2:  don't take used clothing donations from individuals, for example,

582
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:34,045
Speaker 2:  and Fab Scraps operation is focused on New York based

583
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:38,245
Speaker 2:  designers and brands. Just think of all the other textile

584
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:42,045
Speaker 2:  waste happening across the world. Still 7,000 pounds

585
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:46,005
Speaker 2:  of material a week is a huge undertaking. And how does

586
00:40:46,025 --> 00:40:49,925
Speaker 2:  Fab Scrap do it? An army of volunteers on

587
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:53,565
Speaker 2:  the day we visit the place is buzzing with people who've come to help

588
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:57,485
Speaker 2:  fab scrap sort through thousands of pounds of textiles at

589
00:40:57,485 --> 00:41:01,405
Speaker 2:  workstations organized in rows. Volunteers dig through black trash

590
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:04,445
Speaker 2:  bags to divide fabric into different categories.

591
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:08,885
Speaker 2:  Pieces of fabric larger than the workstation table will be

592
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:13,045
Speaker 2:  resold to the public at Fab Scraps thrift store. The more complicated process

593
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:15,165
Speaker 2:  comes with smaller scraps of fabric.

594
00:41:15,715 --> 00:41:18,885
Speaker 12:  Most typically, if something is not

595
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:22,365
Speaker 12:  sequin leather, plastic

596
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:27,725
Speaker 12:  has no like really hard components to it. If it's

597
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:31,045
Speaker 12:  really just fabric, even if it's a mixed like mixed composition,

598
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:34,805
Speaker 12:  even if it's a hundred percent of a certain fiber,

599
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:37,845
Speaker 12:  we can downcycle or shred this.

600
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:43,205
Speaker 2:  All of these smaller pieces of fabric get mixed together and shredded into

601
00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:47,125
Speaker 2:  tiny pieces and made into something called shoddy. Shoddy takes

602
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,885
Speaker 2:  on a bluish color with straight pieces of different fabric mixed in a

603
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:54,765
Speaker 2:  streak of yellow or smudges of black and brown. Think of it like

604
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:57,885
Speaker 2:  a fabric trail mix that can be molded for different uses.

605
00:41:58,545 --> 00:42:00,965
Speaker 2:  Shoddy often becomes different types of insulation,

606
00:42:01,545 --> 00:42:05,045
Speaker 12:  So you could have them be pretty like

607
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,045
Speaker 12:  dense,

608
00:42:06,105 --> 00:42:06,325
Speaker 2:  Oh

609
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:06,885
Speaker 12:  My gosh, and

610
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:07,005
Speaker 2:  Heavy

611
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:11,005
Speaker 12:  Like this. A lot of times they're used for the automotive

612
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:15,165
Speaker 12:  industry, so like car doors require so much insulation, like really, really

613
00:42:15,175 --> 00:42:19,125
Speaker 12:  dense, hard compact and installation. Or you could have it be really

614
00:42:19,795 --> 00:42:23,285
Speaker 12:  thin and lightweight like a lot of times they're now being used for

615
00:42:23,285 --> 00:42:26,885
Speaker 12:  packaging. You could have it for flooring for

616
00:42:27,815 --> 00:42:28,805
Speaker 12:  walls and homes.

617
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:33,285
Speaker 2:  Another bin for sorting is reserved for denim. Denim fabric

618
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:37,365
Speaker 2:  also gets shredded into pulp, but it gets its own process because it's great

619
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:41,165
Speaker 2:  for fiber to fiber recycling, using textile waste to create

620
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:44,845
Speaker 2:  new fabric. Tegel says that there's been a lot of technological

621
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:48,365
Speaker 2:  advancement for 100% cotton and 100%

622
00:42:48,395 --> 00:42:52,245
Speaker 2:  polyester recycling. Most of our clothing is made from these

623
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:55,605
Speaker 2:  two compositions, so recycling 100% cotton

624
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:59,925
Speaker 2:  and 100% polyester fabric is a way to get the biggest impact

625
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:03,525
Speaker 2:  in the industry. Denim is the least varied fabric when it comes to

626
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:07,045
Speaker 2:  composition and it's an easily recognizable fabric for

627
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:10,925
Speaker 2:  volunteers. From one of the black trash bags, Camille pulls out a

628
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:14,405
Speaker 2:  piece of cardboard with little pieces of fabric stapled onto it.

629
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:18,565
Speaker 2:  Each piece is just a few inches big. These are called headers.

630
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:22,325
Speaker 12:  Headers are swatches or essentially sales

631
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:26,605
Speaker 12:  tools that mills will use to market their fabric

632
00:43:26,665 --> 00:43:30,445
Speaker 12:  out to designers and it's how designers are shopping for their fabric. So

633
00:43:30,605 --> 00:43:34,565
Speaker 12:  a lot of times it, there is a lot of information that's really helpful for

634
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:38,525
Speaker 12:  placing an order. So it'll say the fiber content, it might give a range

635
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:42,085
Speaker 12:  of colors that that fabric's available. It'll say like maybe the

636
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:46,325
Speaker 12:  minimums required to purchase that order. So it's really a

637
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:50,365
Speaker 12:  tool for purchasing, for sourcing, but after

638
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:53,925
Speaker 12:  they've placed the order for that fabric, these swatches

639
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:56,525
Speaker 12:  become a little useless to designers.

640
00:43:56,905 --> 00:44:00,365
Speaker 2:  In order to downcycle or recycle the fabric on headers,

641
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:03,885
Speaker 2:  you have to separate out all the stuff that's not fabric,

642
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:08,445
Speaker 2:  the cardboard, the staples, the tape. The problem is that

643
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:12,365
Speaker 2:  every header looks a little different. Some fabric has stickers

644
00:44:12,365 --> 00:44:15,405
Speaker 2:  on it, some doesn't, and headers are all different sizes,

645
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:19,325
Speaker 12:  So that does make the sorting a bit tedious. And one of the reasons

646
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:23,485
Speaker 12:  why this can't be easily mechanized is because all the

647
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:26,685
Speaker 12:  formats of headers are completely different. Like

648
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:30,165
Speaker 2:  There is, it's one of the reasons that all of this human labor is involved

649
00:44:30,165 --> 00:44:33,565
Speaker 2:  in the sorting process. There's no standardization of headers,

650
00:44:34,115 --> 00:44:38,045
Speaker 2:  it's just a tiny piece of the fashion industry, but shows how

651
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:39,845
Speaker 2:  wasteful or inefficient it can be.

652
00:44:42,825 --> 00:44:45,805
Speaker 2:  All of those small cuts of fabric that were sorted by volunteers

653
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:49,605
Speaker 2:  eventually get compressed into a giant cube

654
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:53,845
Speaker 2:  using fab scraps baler machine. The baler kind of resembles an

655
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:57,925
Speaker 2:  elevator. There's an open area inside that is loaded up with

656
00:44:57,925 --> 00:45:01,805
Speaker 2:  fabric by a fab scrap staffer. Close the front of the baler,

657
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:04,885
Speaker 2:  hit the button and the machine compresses the fabric down.

658
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:14,125
Speaker 2:  The Baylor creates giant blocks of mixed fabric weighing

659
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:17,245
Speaker 2:  between 350 and 380 pounds

660
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:21,325
Speaker 2:  and they kind of look like a closet threw up all over. I'm just like

661
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:25,245
Speaker 15:  Fascinated to see what's in each of these like it's like kind of fun like

662
00:45:25,245 --> 00:45:26,725
Speaker 15:  this looks like maybe like a sweater.

663
00:45:28,065 --> 00:45:31,925
Speaker 2:  You can examine the bales and find hints of what kind of fabrics were being

664
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:35,645
Speaker 2:  don cycled. In one cube I found part of a knit sweater

665
00:45:35,795 --> 00:45:39,645
Speaker 2:  with a slashed Ralph Lauren tag. Elsewhere there were

666
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:43,485
Speaker 2:  chunks of a puffer coat and soft fleece like fabrics.

667
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:48,005
Speaker 2:  These 350 pound bales will get sent to South Carolina

668
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:52,125
Speaker 2:  where they'll be shredded by a fab scrap partner. That's how you get

669
00:45:52,225 --> 00:45:55,885
Speaker 2:  shoddy, that fluffy fabric trail mix that's used to make

670
00:45:55,885 --> 00:45:56,485
Speaker 2:  insulation.

671
00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:06,045
Speaker 2:  One of the most exciting things about Fab Scrap, at least for me, is a thrift

672
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:09,765
Speaker 2:  store. This is where the pieces of fabric too big to shred

673
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:13,205
Speaker 2:  end up tucked in a corner of the warehouse is a room

674
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:17,485
Speaker 2:  filled with reams of fabric, big cones of yarn

675
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:21,405
Speaker 2:  of every color, buckets full of zippers and so much more.

676
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:24,045
Speaker 2:  And all of it is for sale to the public.

677
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:28,285
Speaker 16:  The amount of things are so random, like these are bag straps. Okay, this

678
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,165
Speaker 16:  is interesting. Unfair and Klein

679
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,725
Speaker 16:  clearly came from that brand. There's a bunch of them in here actually.

680
00:46:36,975 --> 00:46:40,565
Speaker 16:  These look like maybe Elastic or like undergarments,

681
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,765
Speaker 16:  more elastic metal like

682
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:50,285
Speaker 16:  I don't know what, these are actually some buttons in here.

683
00:46:51,305 --> 00:46:54,245
Speaker 16:  Oh, these are like zipper pulls,

684
00:46:56,895 --> 00:46:58,685
Speaker 16:  belts maybe, or buckles like

685
00:46:59,035 --> 00:47:03,005
Speaker 2:  Some of the thrift store offerings. VERGE on the absurd. There's a bucket

686
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:07,205
Speaker 2:  filled with mutant swimsuit pieces, some of which are only half constructed.

687
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:10,965
Speaker 2:  Another bin has jeans in various states of completion.

688
00:47:11,515 --> 00:47:15,045
Speaker 2:  They might be missing chunks that were cut out by designers perhaps in the

689
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:18,925
Speaker 2:  development process. In another area we find fringed

690
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:22,645
Speaker 2:  leather jacket sleeves detached from the rest of the garment. It's a

691
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:26,605
Speaker 2:  crafty person's paradise. If you sew at all or if you've been to a

692
00:47:26,605 --> 00:47:30,005
Speaker 2:  fabric store, this is exactly what a, a normal store looks like. This is

693
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:33,765
Speaker 2:  how they sell fabric. And it is

694
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:37,245
Speaker 2:  kind of wild to imagine that all of this otherwise would just be thrown out

695
00:47:37,515 --> 00:47:40,325
Speaker 2:  because there's, I mean like look how beautiful this is.

696
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:45,425
Speaker 2:  The team at Fab Scrap is fewer than 15 people standing in

697
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:49,265
Speaker 2:  the thrift store and talking to Camille, I'm moved by

698
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:53,145
Speaker 2:  how much Fab Scrap has been able to do without Fab Scrap. Where would

699
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:53,985
Speaker 2:  all of this stuff be?

700
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:55,305
Speaker 12:  Oh my gosh.

701
00:47:57,265 --> 00:48:01,185
Speaker 12:  I mean that's kind of the, the hard thing to understand when you walk

702
00:48:01,185 --> 00:48:04,865
Speaker 12:  into this room specifically is that when you look around the room and see

703
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:08,825
Speaker 12:  how many things are so easy to work with, realizing that before Fab

704
00:48:08,825 --> 00:48:12,545
Speaker 12:  Scrap existed, all of it went to landfill. I think that's where

705
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:16,345
Speaker 12:  that realization of, oh my gosh, like this, like

706
00:48:16,455 --> 00:48:19,785
Speaker 12:  Fabs Scrap was able to help divert this material. But

707
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:24,065
Speaker 2:  Fab Scrap doesn't exist in a vacuum. The textiles that come to Fab Scrap

708
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:28,265
Speaker 2:  are upstream from the things we buy in stores during the height

709
00:48:28,265 --> 00:48:32,185
Speaker 2:  of the pandemic. For example, Camille says they saw less evening wear

710
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:35,025
Speaker 2:  textiles and lots of athleisure and knits.

711
00:48:36,295 --> 00:48:39,905
Speaker 2:  Fast fashion has no doubt contributed to waste in the industry.

712
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:44,345
Speaker 2:  But Camille points out that those problems exist at smaller brands

713
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:48,145
Speaker 2:  and other companies that people might not consider quote unquote fast fashion.

714
00:48:48,735 --> 00:48:52,225
Speaker 2:  It's not just companies like Sheen or Zara that might throw away

715
00:48:52,615 --> 00:48:56,105
Speaker 2:  bags and bags of materials through its recycling program,

716
00:48:56,795 --> 00:49:00,705
Speaker 2:  brand education efforts and community thrift store Fab Scrap

717
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:04,505
Speaker 2:  to me embodies what change in the fashion industry might

718
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:08,315
Speaker 2:  look like. Camille and the Fab Scrap team challenge us all

719
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:12,315
Speaker 2:  to reset our relationship with the clothing we buy and wear.

720
00:49:12,695 --> 00:49:16,395
Speaker 12:  And I think that's what's kind of amazing is that it's all built around

721
00:49:16,395 --> 00:49:20,115
Speaker 12:  this passion for textiles and understanding that fabric is

722
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:24,315
Speaker 12:  such a valuable resource and it's only because of fast

723
00:49:24,315 --> 00:49:28,195
Speaker 12:  fashion and all of these really absurd like

724
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:32,315
Speaker 12:  societal things that like our perspective has changed on fabric and it's

725
00:49:32,575 --> 00:49:36,355
Speaker 12:  become less recognizable as something to protect. And

726
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:40,275
Speaker 12:  instead there's been this twisted perspective of it being really

727
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:41,235
Speaker 12:  easy to discard

728
00:49:42,865 --> 00:49:46,675
Speaker 2:  From consumers to big fashion companies. Everyone has a role to

729
00:49:46,675 --> 00:49:50,315
Speaker 2:  play. When I buy something, I want it to be made out of

730
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:54,395
Speaker 2:  materials that are kinder to the environment. I want the craftspeople making

731
00:49:54,395 --> 00:49:57,875
Speaker 2:  my clothing. I be paid fairly and treated with dignity.

732
00:49:58,555 --> 00:50:02,475
Speaker 2:  I want my clothes to last And I want the ability to repair them. And I

733
00:50:02,475 --> 00:50:06,395
Speaker 2:  believe the fashion companies have a responsibility to strive for excellence

734
00:50:06,695 --> 00:50:10,035
Speaker 2:  in all these areas, even if it means producing less.

735
00:50:11,215 --> 00:50:15,195
Speaker 2:  Fab Scrap is small but unbelievably scrappy, no pun intended. And

736
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:18,195
Speaker 2:  I really and truly did not mean to make that joke.

737
00:50:18,825 --> 00:50:22,635
Speaker 2:  Camille hopes the organization will continue to grow and expand.

738
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:26,875
Speaker 12:  The next 10 years hopefully looks like a bit more robust in

739
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:30,765
Speaker 12:  terms of like having more team members, being able to reach other

740
00:50:30,765 --> 00:50:34,525
Speaker 12:  cities, maybe calling more people to the cause and

741
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:38,245
Speaker 12:  having them either, you know, do that work through

742
00:50:38,305 --> 00:50:41,765
Speaker 12:  Fab Scrap or as a volunteer or as a shopper. I think just really building

743
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:45,965
Speaker 12:  this community and really establishing ourselves more

744
00:50:45,985 --> 00:50:47,365
Speaker 12:  in other cities would be amazing.

745
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:54,245
Speaker 2:  We're going to one more break and when I come back, I'll be here with V Song

746
00:50:54,245 --> 00:50:57,165
Speaker 2:  to talk about the clueless closet. It's The Vergecast

747
00:53:50,305 --> 00:53:54,135
Speaker 2:  Hello, we are back and let's get to the hotline as always.

748
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:57,935
Speaker 2:  The number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one and the email is

749
00:53:58,055 --> 00:54:01,135
Speaker 2:  vergecast at The Verge dot com. We love hearing your questions and we try

750
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:04,975
Speaker 2:  to answer at least one on the show every week. And today I

751
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:08,815
Speaker 2:  have Victoria Song to help me answer a very fun question from James.

752
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:13,255
Speaker 2:  James says, in the last episode, the clueless closet was

753
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:16,855
Speaker 2:  mentioned and Mia talked about their spreadsheet system. That's me.

754
00:54:18,165 --> 00:54:21,775
Speaker 2:  I've been looking for a solution to the same issue since I can never make

755
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:25,655
Speaker 2:  up my mind, I'd love a deeper dive in the system used or an app,

756
00:54:25,785 --> 00:54:29,775
Speaker 2:  maybe the AI ones if they're good. Sincerely, James. James,

757
00:54:29,775 --> 00:54:33,735
Speaker 2:  thank you for this question to catch people up if they didn't hear

758
00:54:33,755 --> 00:54:37,175
Speaker 2:  the last one. We were talking about all the fake movie and TV tech Yes. That

759
00:54:37,175 --> 00:54:40,695
Speaker 2:  we would love to steal. And I mentioned the clueless closet,

760
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:45,015
Speaker 2:  which is sort of like a computer system that inventories

761
00:54:45,395 --> 00:54:49,255
Speaker 2:  all of the characters clothing pieces. And then she will like match it and

762
00:54:49,255 --> 00:54:52,655
Speaker 2:  the computer will say if it's a good match, if it's a good outfit or not.

763
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:56,415
Speaker 2:  And I mentioned that I have something that's like kind of halfway there where

764
00:54:56,895 --> 00:55:00,295
Speaker 2:  I basically have this giant Excel spreadsheet that I have

765
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,495
Speaker 2:  logged every single article of clothing. I love that. I love that I own,

766
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:08,055
Speaker 2:  I love how meticulous that is it. So if you knew

767
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:11,535
Speaker 2:  my closet and my living situation, you would understand why it's essential

768
00:55:11,915 --> 00:55:14,735
Speaker 2:  for context. I think there are probably about like 300

769
00:55:15,865 --> 00:55:19,735
Speaker 2:  lines rows on the spreadsheet each containing an item. Oh

770
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:23,615
Speaker 2:  my god. And I will say like it, it doesn't include shoes, bags, belts,

771
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:27,735
Speaker 2:  hats, a lot of outerwear. But in my spreadsheet I have like

772
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:31,695
Speaker 2:  what the item is, descriptions, what season it's good for, whether it's short

773
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:35,655
Speaker 2:  sleeve, long sleeves, sleeveless tube top, whatever. If it's a

774
00:55:35,655 --> 00:55:39,015
Speaker 2:  dress, if it's like long, short, somewhere in the middle, oh my god.

775
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:43,095
Speaker 2:  Colors like predominant colors. Whether it's vintage, whether I, it was a

776
00:55:43,095 --> 00:55:46,935
Speaker 2:  hand me down from my mom or a family member. And I

777
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:51,055
Speaker 2:  also mark where in my apartment I've stored it because I have like crucial

778
00:55:51,195 --> 00:55:55,175
Speaker 2:  that's crucial marking where it is. Yeah. I have boxes under my bed

779
00:55:55,235 --> 00:55:58,855
Speaker 2:  in my closet, in my bureau, in the like front hallway

780
00:55:58,915 --> 00:56:02,095
Speaker 2:  closet. So like I need to know where things are. If I need to pull something

781
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:06,135
Speaker 2:  that's like out of season or whatever. This is amazing. Yeah, this is dedication.

782
00:56:06,365 --> 00:56:10,255
Speaker 2:  It's no clueless closet, but it gets the job done and I'd be

783
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:14,135
Speaker 2:  happy to include like screenshots or image of like what the spreadsheet

784
00:56:14,135 --> 00:56:17,095
Speaker 2:  looks like. But yeah, it's partially just like

785
00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:21,295
Speaker 2:  practical, you know, like I, I live in New York, I live in a small apartment

786
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:24,205
Speaker 2:  and if you know anything about New York apartments, you know that they never

787
00:56:24,205 --> 00:56:26,525
Speaker 2:  come with enough closet space. No. VI know. You

788
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:30,045
Speaker 20:  Know, like I know that they never come with enough. You know, I, I moved

789
00:56:30,105 --> 00:56:33,085
Speaker 20:  to Jersey for a house. That place still doesn't have enough closet space.

790
00:56:33,085 --> 00:56:36,245
Speaker 20:  Yeah. For all the, the, And I, like, I finally have a dream walk-in closet

791
00:56:36,595 --> 00:56:40,365
Speaker 20:  that I have to share, but it's still not enough space And I still

792
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:43,165
Speaker 20:  don't know where all the clothes are. I still have to have a different dresser.

793
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:47,365
Speaker 20:  So I, I get the impulse behind this, but oh my God,

794
00:56:47,385 --> 00:56:49,565
Speaker 20:  it seems like a lot of manual work as well.

795
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:53,765
Speaker 2:  It's, it's so manual and so like what I do basically is

796
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:57,925
Speaker 2:  twice a year I rotate my wardrobe. So I put away

797
00:56:57,925 --> 00:57:01,645
Speaker 2:  winter things and take out summer things. So right now all my winter stuff

798
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:05,925
Speaker 2:  is in the spreadsheet logged where I've stored it, but it's like

799
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:09,645
Speaker 2:  inaccessible to me unless I go digging for it. And I was just sick of having

800
00:57:09,665 --> 00:57:13,285
Speaker 2:  to try to find where I put things. And so that's like a big reason

801
00:57:13,465 --> 00:57:17,005
Speaker 2:  for the spreadsheet. But you know, it doesn't do a lot of the things that

802
00:57:17,005 --> 00:57:20,965
Speaker 2:  the Clueless closet does like Right. Combine outfits or give me

803
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:25,005
Speaker 2:  feedback, which honestly like, I don't want feedback, but

804
00:57:25,005 --> 00:57:28,925
Speaker 2:  there are a lot of apps and things that people have built that kind of mimic

805
00:57:29,225 --> 00:57:32,965
Speaker 2:  the clueless closet. So there's one version of this that is very

806
00:57:33,365 --> 00:57:37,285
Speaker 2:  DIY kind of crafty that is like basically a

807
00:57:37,285 --> 00:57:40,925
Speaker 2:  flip book where someone has copy, you know, printed

808
00:57:41,055 --> 00:57:44,525
Speaker 2:  every article of clothing they have and put it in a little three ring binder.

809
00:57:44,745 --> 00:57:47,205
Speaker 2:  So this seems like a lot of work. I don't know how you

810
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:50,485
Speaker 20:  Feel. It's, it's, it's a lot of work. Like I love journaling. I have all

811
00:57:50,485 --> 00:57:53,965
Speaker 20:  the tools necessary to make that And I feel like I need to lie down

812
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:57,925
Speaker 20:  because that, that is a lot of dedication, a lot of work. And I kind of

813
00:57:57,985 --> 00:58:01,805
Speaker 20:  do a capsule closet because I, if you don't know what a capsule

814
00:58:01,805 --> 00:58:05,325
Speaker 20:  closet is, it's you kind of have a bunch of basics that you've figured out

815
00:58:05,325 --> 00:58:09,285
Speaker 20:  how to mix and match so you maximize the stuff and reduce closet

816
00:58:09,295 --> 00:58:13,205
Speaker 20:  space. I said try because you can try And I

817
00:58:13,205 --> 00:58:16,685
Speaker 20:  don't know anyone who's successfully done forever. I don't know anyone who's

818
00:58:16,685 --> 00:58:20,525
Speaker 20:  successfully done a capsule closet. Yeah. But yeah, I think, I think I sent

819
00:58:20,675 --> 00:58:23,845
Speaker 20:  also another TikTok to you over the weekend. I went, oh my god is this?

820
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:24,525
Speaker 20:  Yeah, let's

821
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:25,685
Speaker 2:  Look ATS Closets.

822
00:58:25,685 --> 00:58:28,365
Speaker 21:  Look at Power Digital Wardrobe. You upload photos of your clothes, the background

823
00:58:28,365 --> 00:58:31,125
Speaker 21:  gets removed. Be real. When was the last time you wore the t-shirt that's

824
00:58:31,285 --> 00:58:34,445
Speaker 21:  crumpled up in the bottom of your dresser right now? I know for me the shirts

825
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:37,245
Speaker 21:  that are down here have not been worn in a very long time. And some of those

826
00:58:37,245 --> 00:58:39,965
Speaker 21:  are shirts I used to wear every single day. I just forgot that I own them.

827
00:58:40,205 --> 00:58:44,005
Speaker 21:  I was tired of this. So I created the solution for it. And this is the solution.

828
00:58:44,155 --> 00:58:47,045
Speaker 21:  It's an app I made called Fitted and it's an AI powered digital wardrobe.

829
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,125
Speaker 21:  You upload photos of your clothes, the background gets removed and then

830
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,205
Speaker 21:  they get tagged using AI immediately right here in the pieces tab. I can

831
00:58:52,205 --> 00:58:55,525
Speaker 21:  see every item of clothing that I own, whether I wear it or not. And I can

832
00:58:55,525 --> 00:58:59,165
Speaker 21:  go to the fits tab And I can start creating outfits with all of those clothes.

833
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:02,445
Speaker 21:  So this is integrating everything in my entire closet and making outfits

834
00:59:02,445 --> 00:59:05,045
Speaker 21:  with them. Especially these pants, they the only pants that fit me. This

835
00:59:05,045 --> 00:59:07,365
Speaker 21:  right here is the key to wearing the clothes that you don't normally wear

836
00:59:07,385 --> 00:59:10,205
Speaker 21:  or wearing the clothes you forgot you own. Of course you find an outfit

837
00:59:10,205 --> 00:59:13,165
Speaker 21:  you like, you can save it. It shows up in your safe fits with all the rest

838
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:15,885
Speaker 21:  of them. Absolute game changer. It does take some time to actually upload

839
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,445
Speaker 21:  your clothes to the app, but I promise you once you have them up there,

840
00:59:18,445 --> 00:59:20,765
Speaker 21:  it is the best feeling in the world. Go download Fitted

841
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:24,725
Speaker 2:  Now. Wow. Interesting. I mean it's built an app. Yeah. I will say that

842
00:59:24,725 --> 00:59:28,045
Speaker 2:  this type of app has existed for a while. Yeah. Where you basically like

843
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:31,525
Speaker 2:  digitally log all of your clothing. I find

844
00:59:31,865 --> 00:59:35,525
Speaker 2:  the, like taking a photo of it cropping the background, like all of that

845
00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:39,605
Speaker 2:  work to be very tedious. It's extremely, and they usually lose me there.

846
00:59:39,835 --> 00:59:43,525
Speaker 20:  That I think the, the problem that we're coming up against is the

847
00:59:43,985 --> 00:59:47,685
Speaker 20:  actual logging of the, the items that you have.

848
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:51,485
Speaker 20:  'cause there's no way AI is getting around that either. You have to manually

849
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:54,205
Speaker 20:  take a picture of all of this sort of stuff. And

850
00:59:55,235 --> 00:59:58,605
Speaker 20:  like, I don't know if they still do this, but like look books I think might

851
00:59:58,605 --> 00:59:59,165
Speaker 20:  be kind of

852
00:59:59,325 --> 01:00:00,285
Speaker 2:  Polyvore. Do you remember

853
01:00:00,325 --> 01:00:03,045
Speaker 20:  Polyvore? Oh my god, that's a name I haven't heard in

854
01:00:03,045 --> 01:00:04,405
Speaker 2:  85 years. I know, I know.

855
01:00:04,585 --> 01:00:08,565
Speaker 20:  But yeah, so I think maybe one way around it for those of us who

856
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:12,525
Speaker 20:  are not particularly adept is to do a lookbook,

857
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:16,525
Speaker 20:  which is you just create a little, I, I started in

858
01:00:16,685 --> 01:00:20,605
Speaker 20:  my, my camera roll of going like, this outfit is fire. Let me Yeah.

859
01:00:20,605 --> 01:00:24,125
Speaker 20:  Take a picture of it and add it to an album called Lookbook. Yeah.

860
01:00:24,365 --> 01:00:26,445
Speaker 2:  I also have an outfits album. Yeah. So

861
01:00:26,545 --> 01:00:26,765
Speaker 20:  Of

862
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:28,205
Speaker 2:  Just photos and there's like

863
01:00:28,205 --> 01:00:30,205
Speaker 20:  Three in there, right. Because I'm so lazy.

864
01:00:30,915 --> 01:00:34,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean it's pretty, in terms of like logging things, the easiest

865
01:00:34,895 --> 01:00:38,605
Speaker 2:  thing is like you snap a photo of your outfit before you leave. And actually

866
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:42,605
Speaker 2:  I did do something that I can share a screenshot of or just

867
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:46,485
Speaker 2:  a quick clip of what I did. But if you have an iPhone, which I guess I shouldn't

868
01:00:46,485 --> 01:00:50,325
Speaker 2:  assume, but if you have an iPhone, you can take a photo of your outfit,

869
01:00:50,955 --> 01:00:54,285
Speaker 2:  open a notes document in the notes app and then like

870
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:58,565
Speaker 2:  long press on your body in the photo and copy it

871
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:02,005
Speaker 2:  and then just plop it into the notes app and it's like a little sticker of

872
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:04,845
Speaker 2:  yourself. Oh my God, that's so smart. And its the background. It, it does

873
01:01:04,845 --> 01:01:08,725
Speaker 2:  everything. And so I have a notes app full of just like little

874
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:11,605
Speaker 2:  miniature stickers of my outfits of myself.

875
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:16,325
Speaker 2:  And it kind of needs to be cleaned up a little bit. But I have

876
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:20,245
Speaker 2:  just like a general feed of all of them. You can also click into them

877
01:01:20,265 --> 01:01:23,885
Speaker 2:  to see it bigger and then like swipe through it like a photo album. But

878
01:01:23,995 --> 01:01:27,805
Speaker 2:  crucially, what I use this for is outfits that I have worn to

879
01:01:27,835 --> 01:01:30,965
Speaker 2:  work things because that is like, I don't know about you, but

880
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:35,485
Speaker 2:  women's professional wear is so, it's a curse.

881
01:01:35,755 --> 01:01:39,445
Speaker 20:  It's a absolute, it's just so one, it's either not fun

882
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:43,285
Speaker 20:  or it's not comfortable. Yeah. Or it's just like people

883
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:47,205
Speaker 20:  notice if you wear the same thing. Too many times I've, I've had some VERGE

884
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:50,605
Speaker 20:  commenters and other commenters when I was at Gizmoto. They're like, does

885
01:01:50,605 --> 01:01:52,285
Speaker 20:  she have another shirt? And I was like, oh my God,

886
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:55,165
Speaker 2:  That's so rude. First of all, that's so rude. But also,

887
01:01:55,265 --> 01:01:57,005
Speaker 20:  But also point taken. Yeah. Well

888
01:01:57,115 --> 01:02:00,965
Speaker 2:  It's really hard, it hard to like calibrate your personal style to

889
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:04,845
Speaker 2:  the setting and like the tyranny of

890
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:09,125
Speaker 2:  women's workwear is something that I just will never, ever, ever

891
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:09,965
Speaker 2:  surrender to.

892
01:02:10,385 --> 01:02:10,925
Speaker 20:  And Taylor,

893
01:02:11,105 --> 01:02:14,565
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm not wearing that. I'm sorry I'm not wearing the like little

894
01:02:14,845 --> 01:02:18,765
Speaker 2:  blazer and pencil skirt vibe. I need to feel comfortable

895
01:02:19,325 --> 01:02:23,245
Speaker 2:  also, like this video, this podcast, I need to find something that

896
01:02:23,245 --> 01:02:27,005
Speaker 2:  like looks kind of normal on screen that also I'm not having to go buy

897
01:02:27,005 --> 01:02:30,885
Speaker 2:  like a new wardrobe. Nice. Yeah. So yeah, I have a section in my notes

898
01:02:30,905 --> 01:02:34,485
Speaker 2:  app that says work outfits and when I don't know what I'm doing when it's

899
01:02:34,485 --> 01:02:36,725
Speaker 2:  a night before and I'm freaking out because I have nothing to wear to this

900
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:40,365
Speaker 2:  conference or whatever, I will just like pick a little mia

901
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:43,445
Speaker 2:  sticker outfit to just recreate.

902
01:02:43,445 --> 01:02:44,925
Speaker 20:  That's genius. That's genius. Highly

903
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:45,205
Speaker 2:  Recommend.

904
01:02:45,765 --> 01:02:49,645
Speaker 20:  I I am going to do that because like to your point, anytime there's

905
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:51,565
Speaker 20:  like, you're gonna be on camera, you need to take a photo And I was like,

906
01:02:51,565 --> 01:02:55,525
Speaker 20:  oh God, what do I have? What do I wear that is solid. That is not white.

907
01:02:55,795 --> 01:02:58,765
Speaker 20:  That is not, there's just like so many considerations that you have to think

908
01:02:58,765 --> 01:02:59,085
Speaker 20:  of because

909
01:02:59,305 --> 01:03:00,365
Speaker 2:  Not green. Right.

910
01:03:00,515 --> 01:03:03,525
Speaker 20:  That how you'll come up on camera. Yeah. Yeah. Green you might just be a

911
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:07,565
Speaker 20:  floating head. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, if you see us wear repeat

912
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:08,165
Speaker 20:  outfits,

913
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:09,525
Speaker 2:  Don't say anything. Don't

914
01:03:09,525 --> 01:03:13,445
Speaker 20:  Say anything. But that's the reason. It's because that's, it's we,

915
01:03:13,505 --> 01:03:16,885
Speaker 20:  we don't have an infinite budget. Yeah. We don't have, we don't actually

916
01:03:16,885 --> 01:03:18,525
Speaker 20:  have shares closet, which

917
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:19,245
Speaker 2:  Is I wish, which

918
01:03:19,565 --> 01:03:19,725
Speaker 20:  Gigantic

919
01:03:20,285 --> 01:03:20,565
Speaker 2:  I wish,

920
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:24,405
Speaker 20:  Do we look like we're wearing the same outfits? It's because we pre-taped

921
01:03:24,405 --> 01:03:27,765
Speaker 20:  some of these things. So what are we gonna do? Bring half of our closet

922
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:31,405
Speaker 20:  in and switch out and all of that. No, that's just,

923
01:03:32,085 --> 01:03:35,245
Speaker 20:  although I have done that on certain occasions. Yeah. For certain videos.

924
01:03:35,465 --> 01:03:37,165
Speaker 20:  So that's just dedication. Yeah. But

925
01:03:37,345 --> 01:03:41,245
Speaker 2:  If The Verge wants to create a closet for me in the Vox Media office, I will

926
01:03:41,245 --> 01:03:43,285
Speaker 2:  not say No Jim, Jim Benoff,

927
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:47,205
Speaker 20:  NELI, NELI, NELI, NELI. Can we, can we have a sheriff's closet?

928
01:03:47,425 --> 01:03:50,045
Speaker 2:  Can we take what? Share over your office while you're on leave and make it

929
01:03:50,075 --> 01:03:50,765
Speaker 2:  into a closet.

930
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:54,485
Speaker 20:  Yeah. What if we have a sheriff's closet that we can all share

931
01:03:56,605 --> 01:04:00,405
Speaker 2:  A I like it. I like it too. The the last point I'll make too is like the

932
01:04:00,785 --> 01:04:04,525
Speaker 2:  AI ification of this type of feature

933
01:04:04,785 --> 01:04:08,525
Speaker 2:  or tool. For me it probably wouldn't work

934
01:04:08,755 --> 01:04:12,565
Speaker 2:  because so much of clothing is like tactile

935
01:04:13,285 --> 01:04:17,165
Speaker 2:  and sensory and even though things like a shirt and

936
01:04:17,165 --> 01:04:21,045
Speaker 2:  then pants separately, like when you slide them next to each other on top

937
01:04:21,045 --> 01:04:24,805
Speaker 2:  of each other, it looks normal. There are so many like nuances to how

938
01:04:25,005 --> 01:04:27,965
Speaker 2:  clothing falls on the body that Yeah. Doesn't mean it will work. That's why

939
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:30,485
Speaker 2:  you need to like try on outfits to

940
01:04:30,485 --> 01:04:33,765
Speaker 20:  See that's, that's the thing I have about that one guy in the TikTok, the

941
01:04:33,765 --> 01:04:37,485
Speaker 20:  fitted app. It's like you're taking pictures of the clothes but not on you.

942
01:04:37,595 --> 01:04:40,885
Speaker 20:  Yeah. There's just certain ways that it's like, oh theoretically this crop

943
01:04:40,905 --> 01:04:44,765
Speaker 20:  top and this pair of jeans would look good. But actually that's not

944
01:04:44,925 --> 01:04:48,605
Speaker 20:  a high enough rise jeans for me. So when I put it on, I don't like the way

945
01:04:48,605 --> 01:04:52,365
Speaker 20:  it looks. That sort of stuff. So you know, AI is not always

946
01:04:52,495 --> 01:04:56,245
Speaker 20:  gonna be able to distill what you like and what your personal style

947
01:04:56,505 --> 01:04:59,365
Speaker 20:  is, so eh, yeah. I don't know.

948
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,405
Speaker 2:  I think kind of diminishing returns on something

949
01:06:09,645 --> 01:06:13,445
Speaker 2:  Efford, Travis Ick, and Andrew Marino. The Vergecast is The

950
01:06:13,565 --> 01:06:17,325
Speaker 2:  Verge production and part of the Vox Media podcast network. Jake will be

951
01:06:17,325 --> 01:06:20,725
Speaker 2:  back on Friday to discuss all the news from the week. And thank you as always

952
01:06:20,785 --> 01:06:22,205
