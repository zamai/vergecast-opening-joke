Speaker 4:  You're a podcaster now. Last time we did this you had like ear pods on. Now

10
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:35,595
Speaker 4:  you have a light, you have a mic. Like this is a whole thing.

11
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:40,395
Speaker 5:  I know. I have the Vox Media setup. Shout out to

12
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:44,315
Speaker 5:  the producers that sent me all this gear. I have the official mic.

13
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:47,315
Speaker 4:  Is there just like a box that they sent you that's like Welcome To podcast?

14
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:48,035
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

15
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:51,715
Speaker 5:  It was a box. They sent someone over to put up a lights in my kitchen, which

16
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:52,235
Speaker 5:  is where I am.

17
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:56,355
Speaker 4:  So you just launched a podcast. It's called Power User. Tell the people about

18
00:01:56,355 --> 00:01:56,675
Speaker 4:  your podcast.

19
00:01:57,265 --> 00:02:01,195
Speaker 5:  It's a weekly tech news show, but it focuses more on

20
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:04,835
Speaker 5:  the things that I cover, which is, is the user side of tech. A lot of

21
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:08,675
Speaker 5:  internet culture, media, landscape stuff, you know, some

22
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:12,435
Speaker 5:  creator industry stuff. Mr. Beast. Also touching on things like

23
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:15,995
Speaker 5:  Netflix, you know, Disney's some entertainment media

24
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:20,515
Speaker 5:  business and just wild, weird internet stories and trends. This week we're

25
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:24,475
Speaker 5:  talking about kindness influencers, which are a plague on TikTok. I don't

26
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:28,355
Speaker 5:  know, If. you see those? The guys that exploit unhoused people for

27
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:31,875
Speaker 5:  content basically. Yeah. And there's this feud between two big kindness

28
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,755
Speaker 5:  influencers over who's essentially helping this one family in West Virginia

29
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:39,515
Speaker 5:  more. you know, we're talking about the Andrew Huberman expose as well.

30
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:43,355
Speaker 5:  And so yeah, it's, I think that's a good, listen, we just launched it last

31
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:43,515
Speaker 5:  week.

32
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,915
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you picked an interesting time to do this. There is like not a shortage

33
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,155
Speaker 4:  of weird stuff happening on the internet at this moment.

34
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,435
Speaker 5:  No, and I want people to better understand it. I think we talk so much about

35
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:57,195
Speaker 5:  big tech and sort of the traditional Silicon Valley side of tech and there's

36
00:02:57,195 --> 00:03:00,485
Speaker 5:  not as many, I think tech podcasts focused on the tech world outside Silicon

37
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:04,045
Speaker 5:  Valley and just more of the cultural side of things. So

38
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,445
Speaker 5:  that's what I'm hoping to get into.

39
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:08,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, this is actually one of the things I was thinking about as, as you

40
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:10,645
Speaker 4:  were, you know, we talked a little bit as you were getting ready to launch

41
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:13,565
Speaker 4:  the podcast and it seems like we're in this weird space where there are a

42
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:17,565
Speaker 4:  ton of creators who have podcasts, right? Like it's, I feel like it's the

43
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:20,165
Speaker 4:  same way in like the sports world, right? Where there used to be lots of

44
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:23,565
Speaker 4:  people who talked about athletes and now the athletes are just doing the

45
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:27,405
Speaker 4:  talking. But I feel like they're in this sort of space of like

46
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:31,005
Speaker 4:  people talking about this business. It's either the people who are in it

47
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:34,085
Speaker 4:  every day living it or nobody really talks about it. It's very weird. And

48
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:36,645
Speaker 4:  I feel like this has been like the needle, you've been threading for a really

49
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:40,565
Speaker 4:  long time where you're like, no, this matters. But also if it's just

50
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:43,365
Speaker 4:  a creator talking about their own life, that's not the quite, not quite the

51
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:46,085
Speaker 4:  same thing as like doing journalism about it. Exactly.

52
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:49,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I think also, I mean, I have a big content creator on

53
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:53,885
Speaker 5:  this week. Yeah. So, you know, I've, I've love creators and I wanna talk

54
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:57,325
Speaker 5:  to them, but I, I think it's worth giving a little bit more critical thought.

55
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,405
Speaker 5:  I think a lot of times when you're in an industry one, you can't speak as

56
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,325
Speaker 5:  freely about it sometimes. 'cause you're actually in this industry, you know,

57
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:06,485
Speaker 5:  a lot of their podcasts focus more on sort of like interpersonal drama, like

58
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:10,325
Speaker 5:  drama sort of stuff. Or they do culture. I mean, there's a lot of internet

59
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,005
Speaker 5:  culture YouTuber podcasts that I listen to all the time. I think I'm coming

60
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:18,005
Speaker 5:  at it more from like a business and cultural and journalistic angle. But

61
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:21,205
Speaker 5:  I love those YouTubers and I hope to have them on. And I'm a big commentary

62
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:22,725
Speaker 5:  channel fan, so,

63
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,165
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, it, there's lots of good stuff out there, don't get me wrong. There's

64
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,725
Speaker 4:  lots of different ways to come at this. So the episode we're gonna play here

65
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:32,445
Speaker 4:  is about the TikTok band. We picked this one because we talked a bunch about

66
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:36,365
Speaker 4:  the TikTok ban on The Vergecast two weeks ago. And everyone got

67
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:40,165
Speaker 4:  very mad at us. We, we disagreed vehemently about what should happen

68
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:43,325
Speaker 4:  here. Everybody got very upset. We got a lot of emails. I'm being accused

69
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:47,045
Speaker 4:  of being a a Chinese communist basically. And a lot of people think Mila

70
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:50,645
Speaker 4:  hates free speech and that think Alex is also

71
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:54,245
Speaker 4:  mad at everybody. It's really good times. I'm just curious how you feel about

72
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:56,685
Speaker 4:  where we are with the TikTok ban right now. We're gonna hear a bunch about

73
00:04:56,685 --> 00:05:00,125
Speaker 4:  this in the episode, but where is your head with what you're thinking about

74
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,685
Speaker 4:  the TikTok ban kind of right in this moment?

75
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,565
Speaker 5:  Oh gosh. I said very earnestly to a friend the other day. I was like, we're

76
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:09,445
Speaker 5:  living in an era of mass censorship. And she was like, okay, you're starting

77
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:10,765
Speaker 5:  to sound like Elon Musk,

78
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:16,325
Speaker 5:  But as a journalist, and I would imagine you guys feel the same way, but

79
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:19,125
Speaker 5:  it, you know, I care a lot about civil liberties. I've always cared a lot

80
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,965
Speaker 5:  about civil liberties. I've spent a enormous time reporting on TikTok, and

81
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,845
Speaker 5:  not just TikTok, but musically. And I remember when there

82
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:29,645
Speaker 5:  was this fight when Facebook was driving musically into the ground

83
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:33,805
Speaker 5:  and they had to sell. And Viacom, you know, there was a minute that

84
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:37,325
Speaker 5:  we thought Viacom might buy, ance came in and sort of bought it and, and

85
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:40,965
Speaker 5:  just the la you know, of course no one cared back then that the fast

86
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:43,725
Speaker 5:  one of the, I would've called it one of the most relevant, fast growing video

87
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:47,565
Speaker 5:  social networks on the planet was being bought by Ance. And then now there's

88
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,885
Speaker 5:  this panic five years later. It's a little hard for me to take it quite as

89
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:54,685
Speaker 5:  seriously. Not that I'm like, where was this energy when you allowed

90
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:58,405
Speaker 5:  this deal to happen five years ago? But also I write a lot

91
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:01,245
Speaker 5:  about a lot of other up and coming apps and there's just Chinese influence

92
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:05,205
Speaker 5:  in so many things, gaming particularly. And you know, so I find a lot

93
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:08,485
Speaker 5:  of these arguments that these lawmakers are making, it doesn't seem like

94
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:12,125
Speaker 5:  the ban as it currently stands, the current bill would address any of these

95
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,205
Speaker 5:  issues, right. Doesn't address, address any of the problems with data brokers.

96
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,605
Speaker 5:  Doesn't address a lot of the civil liberties free speech stuff. And as I've

97
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,965
Speaker 5:  said before, and I was also accused of being a communist and I understand

98
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:25,045
Speaker 5:  making this comment, but even if TikTok was a Chinese propaganda app,

99
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:28,205
Speaker 5:  we're supposed to have a free and open internet. What if I am a communist

100
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:32,005
Speaker 5:  and I wanna consume Chinese propaganda all day, it's this is America. I should

101
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,285
Speaker 5:  be allowed to do that. Yeah.

102
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,965
Speaker 4:  We got a lot of emails from people after the episode a couple of weeks ago

103
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,165
Speaker 4:  that were basically like, well, China bans it.

104
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:41,765
Speaker 5:  Oh, so we should mimic an authoritarian state. Oh, well this

105
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:44,325
Speaker 5:  authoritarian should more like China State over there. China, yeah. What?

106
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,765
Speaker 5:  No, I actually don't want the government to control our app store. It's so

107
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:52,165
Speaker 5:  funny the way this is split around political lines, and I think, I mean,

108
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:55,405
Speaker 5:  I'm planning a future episode about this, so I really hope people tune in.

109
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:59,165
Speaker 5:  I don't know if anyone's been following the Jonathan Haight Anti phone

110
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:03,245
Speaker 5:  press tour recently. A little bit, yeah. But there's just this, you can push

111
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:07,365
Speaker 5:  a lot of bad legislation and dangerous things through and sell people

112
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:10,965
Speaker 5:  on things when you tell them it's protecting children and you know, here's

113
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:13,925
Speaker 5:  what your children are up to and they're being brainwashed, you know, by

114
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:17,765
Speaker 5:  this Chinese communist app or whatever. And it's just

115
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:21,125
Speaker 5:  not true. I, I mean, I'm very skeptical of all of the, the Save the Children

116
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:25,045
Speaker 5:  type messaging around phones generally, and especially around TikTok because

117
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,925
Speaker 5:  TikTok is quite, you know, liberating for a lot of kids. It's not like Instagram

118
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:31,925
Speaker 5:  and a lot of other apps which have actually done the things that they're

119
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:35,645
Speaker 5:  accusing TikTok of doing, like manipulate, you know, affecting our elections,

120
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,885
Speaker 5:  causing a lot of self harm, eating disorders, whatever. Not to say,

121
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:42,485
Speaker 5:  you know, TikTok is a very different TikTok iss much more akin to YouTube.

122
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:45,645
Speaker 5:  I always call say it's a, it's a combination of Twitter and YouTube.

123
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:49,805
Speaker 4:  I think that's right. All right, well before we get into the episode, how

Speaker 5:  down the biggest stories in tech and online culture. And this week the big

142
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:42,425
Speaker 5:  story is definitely TikTok. Recently the House of

143
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:45,585
Speaker 5:  Representatives moved a bill forward that would effectively ban the app and

144
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:49,465
Speaker 5:  The future of the platform is looking dicey. So I'm bringing in Evan Greer,

145
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:53,185
Speaker 5:  the director of Fight for The future, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization

146
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:56,965
Speaker 5:  that fights for civil liberties online. We're gonna break down the concerns

147
00:11:56,965 --> 00:12:00,485
Speaker 5:  around TikTok, what lawmakers are hoping to achieve by banning it, and whether

148
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:04,045
Speaker 5:  this app is really something we should all be worried about. Hi Evan, thank

149
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:06,445
Speaker 5:  you so much for joining me on the first episode of Power User.

150
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:09,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah, for sure. Taylor, thanks so much for having me on. You've

151
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:12,925
Speaker 5:  Been super critical of this legislation, so I wanna talk about some of the

152
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:15,765
Speaker 5:  concerns with this bill and what you feel like Congress could actually be

153
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:19,405
Speaker 5:  doing to make our lives better online. First of all, a lot of lawmakers are

154
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,965
Speaker 5:  trying to claim that this is not a real ban, it's a forced sale, and there's

155
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:26,405
Speaker 5:  some sort of big distinction between the two things. Is it fair to characterize

156
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:30,005
Speaker 5:  this legislation as a forced sale or is this an effective ban?

157
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:33,725
Speaker 8:  This bill is a ban by any other name.

158
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:38,605
Speaker 8:  I'm not a a business lawyer. I've never tried to buy or

159
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:42,565
Speaker 8:  sell a multi-billion dollar company, but it doesn't take an

160
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:45,685
Speaker 8:  expert to understand that. Like those types of things don't tend to happen

161
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:49,845
Speaker 8:  overnight. And all of the experts that I've talked to have

162
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:53,765
Speaker 8:  suggested that the six month timeline that's laid out

163
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:57,685
Speaker 8:  in this bill that would attempt to force TikTok to effectively sell

164
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:01,085
Speaker 8:  itself or get banned is just completely

165
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:02,805
Speaker 8:  impractical and ridiculous.

166
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:06,765
Speaker 5:  Well, yeah, it's actually 180 days, right? Within that six

167
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:10,605
Speaker 5:  month timeline, they have to sell within 180 days, which as my

168
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:14,125
Speaker 5:  colleague Drew reported, would be one of the thorniest and most complicated

169
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:18,085
Speaker 5:  transactions in all of corporate history. And it would almost

170
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:21,845
Speaker 5:  certainly pose insurmountable financial, technical and geopolitical challenges

171
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,285
Speaker 5:  making this sale basically untenable.

172
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:28,515
Speaker 8:  That's exactly right. That's what I've heard from every expert that I've

173
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:32,395
Speaker 8:  talked to about it as well, which is why the A CLU and many other

174
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:36,355
Speaker 8:  civil liberties organizations have said clearly that this does amount

175
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:39,315
Speaker 8:  to a ban. And because of that, it's clearly

176
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:43,755
Speaker 8:  unconstitutional. In the United States, we have the first amendment, it

177
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:48,035
Speaker 8:  prohibits the government from engaging in acts of censorship unless

178
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,755
Speaker 8:  they can prove they have no other option, no other way to

179
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:55,675
Speaker 8:  address the concerns that they're raising. And you know, we'll get

180
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:58,915
Speaker 8:  into it a little bit more later, but they have many options, many ways that

181
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:02,635
Speaker 8:  they could address legitimate concerns with TikTok and other big tech

182
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:05,475
Speaker 8:  companies short of actually banning them outright.

183
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:09,275
Speaker 5:  Yeah, and also, I mean you mentioned these lawmakers themselves have been

184
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:12,675
Speaker 5:  referring to it as ban. I just wanna read a couple quotes from some of those

185
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:16,035
Speaker 5:  lawmakers. These are the people that championed the bill and ushered it through

186
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:19,635
Speaker 5:  Representative Elise Deon says quote, I'm proud to join Chairman

187
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:23,035
Speaker 5:  Mike Gallagher to finally ban TikTok in the United States.

188
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:27,595
Speaker 5:  And then representative Bob Lata says, I'm proud to help lead the bipartisan

189
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:31,915
Speaker 5:  act, which will ban the app from the United States. Representative Chip

190
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:35,195
Speaker 5:  Roy says, I'm proud to partner with the representatives on this bipartisan

191
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:39,155
Speaker 5:  bill to ban the distribution of TikTok in the us. These lawmakers might

192
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:43,115
Speaker 5:  try to sort of spin it in the media like, oh, it's not a real ban, but this

193
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,835
Speaker 5:  is an effective ban and that is how they themselves are

194
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:47,235
Speaker 5:  promoting it.

195
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,675
Speaker 8:  That's exactly right. And I think in their minds, you know, I don't know

196
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:54,165
Speaker 8:  that they've actually like gamed this out until the end, right? They may

197
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:58,085
Speaker 8:  very much end up as the dogs who caught the car because I think they

198
00:14:58,155 --> 00:15:02,085
Speaker 8:  perhaps really are hoping to bully TikTok into selling themselves to a US

199
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:05,005
Speaker 8:  company or something like that. But the timeline that they've laid out is

200
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,845
Speaker 8:  so ridiculous that they might end up sort of accidentally banning TikTok

201
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:13,045
Speaker 8:  and then dealing with the political consequences of that since we

202
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,845
Speaker 8:  know it is an app that is wildly popular, especially with young

203
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:20,725
Speaker 8:  people, which both parties are struggling to speak to in

204
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:24,485
Speaker 8:  terms of what the issues that they care about. So I think unfortunately this

205
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:28,445
Speaker 8:  is a lot of like tech policy made for tv and I think it's bad politics

206
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,645
Speaker 8:  on both sides all around.

207
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,965
Speaker 5:  Not to mention that musically, which is what TikTok was named before they

208
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,685
Speaker 5:  rebranded it as TikTok was sold to Bite Dance in 2017.

209
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:40,325
Speaker 5:  None of these lawmakers had any issue with that sale at the time, of course.

210
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:43,645
Speaker 5:  But the reason that Musically sale went through and bite dance was the one

211
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:47,045
Speaker 5:  to buy it as well is because there were no viable

212
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:51,165
Speaker 5:  US purchasers. Google and Meta were essentially written out

213
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:55,005
Speaker 5:  because of antitrust concerns. So I just think

214
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:58,245
Speaker 5:  it's very telling that like who is this app gonna sell to? you know, if this

215
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:02,005
Speaker 5:  alleged forced sale is supposed to happen, any major

216
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,725
Speaker 5:  company that it would sell to, I think there would be serious antitrust concerns.

217
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:06,925
Speaker 5:  So it's just totally unfeasible.

218
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:08,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah, that's exactly right.

219
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:12,405
Speaker 5:  Alright Evan, so let's get into some of the civil liberties concerns with

220
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,485
Speaker 5:  the ban. How is this a free speech and First Amendment issue?

221
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:19,845
Speaker 8:  So what this really comes down to is do you believe that your government

222
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,725
Speaker 8:  should be able to tell you where you can get news from and where

223
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:27,405
Speaker 8:  you can express yourself? In the United States, we have the First Amendment.

224
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:31,525
Speaker 8:  The First Amendment prohibits the government from telling me I can't give

225
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:35,285
Speaker 8:  an interview to Al Jazeera, even though Al Jazeera is not

226
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:39,045
Speaker 8:  owned by a US company. Just like the government can't stop me from writing

227
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:42,325
Speaker 8:  an op-ed, or a letter to the editor to a newspaper,

228
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:46,765
Speaker 8:  TikTok is a platform that millions of Americans use to express themselves.

229
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:50,765
Speaker 8:  So banning it would amount to silencing the voices of

230
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:54,365
Speaker 8:  millions of people. The First Amendment requires that if the US

231
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:58,285
Speaker 8:  government is going to engage in that type of act of restricting speech,

232
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:02,365
Speaker 8:  they have to prove that they have no other way to

233
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:06,205
Speaker 8:  address their concerns. Now, the concerns the US government has stated in

234
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:09,805
Speaker 8:  this case, as they say, TikTok is collecting your data. It could be shared

235
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:13,365
Speaker 8:  with the Chinese government and or the Chinese government could be manipulating

236
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:17,445
Speaker 8:  tiktoks algorithm to spread propaganda. Let's take both of those concerns

237
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:18,805
Speaker 8:  at face value. Let's say it's true.

238
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:23,325
Speaker 5:  I mean, my feeling is even if it was a Chinese propaganda app say

239
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:27,045
Speaker 5:  it was, don't we have the right to consume that if we want? Isn't that supposed

240
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,525
Speaker 5:  to be a freedom that we're allowed?

241
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:33,485
Speaker 8:  Absolutely. you know, there's nothing that says we shouldn't be able to read

242
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:37,445
Speaker 8:  lies. And you know, unfortunately there's more

243
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:40,925
Speaker 8:  of them floating around on the internet than any of us would perhaps like.

244
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:44,925
Speaker 8:  But yes, absolutely. Even if we take the government's concerns completely

245
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:48,885
Speaker 8:  at face value and they believe the Chinese Communist Party is literally has

246
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:52,565
Speaker 8:  their their hand on the lever and is like controlling tiktoks algorithm at

247
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:56,205
Speaker 8:  a granular level. And let's be clear, there's no actual evidence

248
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,765
Speaker 8:  to suggest that that is happening. But it's a valid concern.

249
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:03,725
Speaker 8:  Governments do things, the Chinese government certainly does engage in

250
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:07,445
Speaker 8:  authoritarian acts, you know, worth asking. That

251
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:11,565
Speaker 8:  said, there's absolutely ways to address that. We could pass algorithmic

252
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:14,965
Speaker 8:  transparency legislation and require that companies like TikTok

253
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:18,845
Speaker 8:  open up their algorithms to third party auditors that would

254
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:22,765
Speaker 8:  catch a government that was engaging in that kind of manipulation. We could

255
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:26,445
Speaker 8:  pass privacy legislation to prevent them from collecting so much data about

256
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:30,005
Speaker 8:  all of us in the first place and using that data to recommend us content.

257
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,805
Speaker 8:  Those are meaningful ways that we could address the types of concerns that

258
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:37,405
Speaker 8:  the government is raising without banning an app that millions of people

259
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:40,685
Speaker 8:  use to express themselves. That's why banning TikTok is blatantly

260
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:45,005
Speaker 8:  unconstitutional and frankly a huge distraction from the types

261
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:48,925
Speaker 8:  of real measures that would actually lead to a better internet with more

262
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,885
Speaker 8:  free expression and more human rights for everyone.

263
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:55,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean, I just think it's so telling that while these lawmakers claim,

264
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:58,685
Speaker 5:  you know, concerns around national security and everything, and we'll definitely

265
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:01,605
Speaker 5:  get into that. When you listen to what they said at the hearing,

266
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:06,365
Speaker 5:  you realize that repeatedly they express issue with the

267
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:08,205
Speaker 5:  content they believe to be on the app

268
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:11,365
Speaker 9:  From the data it collects to the content it controls.

269
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:16,165
Speaker 9:  TikTok is a grave threat of foreign influence

270
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:20,005
Speaker 9:  in American life. It's been said, it's like allowing the Soviet Union the

271
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:23,445
Speaker 9:  power to produce Saturday morning cartoons during the Cold War,

272
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,925
Speaker 9:  but much more powerful and much more dangerous.

273
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:31,155
Speaker 9:  Banning your platform will address the immediate threats.

274
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:36,195
Speaker 5:  And that to me is really scary and dystopian because once we have these lawmakers

275
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:40,235
Speaker 5:  starting to sort of legislate around the content that they

276
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:43,955
Speaker 5:  think is okay, you know, to expose people to online or the news and information,

277
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:47,115
Speaker 5:  you know, that young people have access to through apps like TikTok or other

278
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:51,075
Speaker 5:  social media platforms, it just feels scary. Like that feels very

279
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:55,035
Speaker 5:  much like an infringement on our ability to freely

280
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:56,795
Speaker 5:  consume information and express ideas.

281
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:01,645
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And unfortunately that kind of authoritarian

282
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:05,485
Speaker 8:  impulse of going after online speech and content is

283
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:09,245
Speaker 8:  not just limited to TikTok and it's unfortunately very bipartisan in

284
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:12,885
Speaker 8:  DC right now. Both Democrats and Republicans have really leaned into this

285
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:16,845
Speaker 8:  idea that it's like online content and

286
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:20,645
Speaker 8:  speech that is driving these harms in our society rather than

287
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:24,605
Speaker 8:  the underlying business practices of these companies that we can actually

288
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:28,525
Speaker 8:  regulate. And so what you see is Republicans sort of being like, look at

289
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:31,565
Speaker 8:  all this content that our kids are consuming and they're talking about like

290
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:35,485
Speaker 8:  RuPaul's Drag race videos or whatever. But then you see Democrats leading

291
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,605
Speaker 8:  into it and saying, look at these Andrew Tate videos and like they're being

292
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:42,045
Speaker 8:  recommended to kids and like, that's terrible. And like they're right. That's

293
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:45,605
Speaker 8:  terrible. The way that we address that is by addressing

294
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:49,525
Speaker 8:  patriarchy in our society, by attacking the underlying business

295
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:53,205
Speaker 8:  model that makes it profitable for companies to artificially amplify

296
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:57,125
Speaker 8:  the most extreme content. We cannot address this issue

297
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,965
Speaker 8:  through government censorship that just leads to more harm, particularly

298
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:01,605
Speaker 8:  for young people.

299
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:05,485
Speaker 5:  And say China did wanna interfere with America through, you know,

300
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:09,445
Speaker 5:  programming social media. Is there anything that TikTok

301
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:13,725
Speaker 5:  specifically allows that other American owned apps like Facebook and

302
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:15,325
Speaker 5:  Twitter and YouTube don't allow?

303
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:20,265
Speaker 8:  No, these companies operate in almost the exact same manner. They

304
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:24,105
Speaker 8:  all employ the same basic surveillance capitalist business

305
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:28,025
Speaker 8:  model, which is about collecting your data, monitoring what you do

306
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:31,905
Speaker 8:  on the app, and then using that information to recommend you content in order

307
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:35,825
Speaker 8:  to keep you clicking and scrolling and generating advertising revenue. They're

308
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:39,025
Speaker 8:  all basically the same app and they all sort of increasingly become more

309
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:41,705
Speaker 8:  and more like the same app as they just sort of copy each other.

310
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:46,225
Speaker 5:  Although one thing I'll say about that is that there has been this

311
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,825
Speaker 5:  refrain from a lot of people of, oh well because these are just the same

312
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:53,545
Speaker 5:  apps. If we delete TikTok, everybody can just go use, you know,

313
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:57,545
Speaker 5:  Instagram or Twitter or whatever. And I do think that there's

314
00:21:57,545 --> 00:22:00,425
Speaker 5:  something that's different about TikTok, which is that it's not owned by

315
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:03,865
Speaker 5:  an American company. And also these other platforms have made very

316
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:07,905
Speaker 5:  aggressive moves to censor speech. I mean, I'm just thinking of

317
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:11,585
Speaker 5:  meta Instagram's recent policies saying that any content that touches on

318
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:14,945
Speaker 5:  political issues or social issues will be down ranked. And that is the type

319
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:17,905
Speaker 5:  of stuff that they're trying to deprioritize on Instagram, Facebook, and

320
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:21,385
Speaker 5:  threads. So it's really hard to talk about things like

321
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:25,385
Speaker 5:  revenge porn or the election or just these really critical issues that we

322
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,265
Speaker 5:  should be talking about in society on meta owned apps. Look at Twitter, right?

323
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:33,185
Speaker 5:  Elon Musk has spent the past week banning any journalists that reported on

324
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,905
Speaker 5:  this Nazi comic book writer. And YouTube is much more of an

325
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:39,505
Speaker 5:  entertainment platform in the sense that I don't think a lot of average users

326
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:42,825
Speaker 5:  post on there. It's also not a great place for politics. So

327
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:46,945
Speaker 5:  I do think that TikTok allowed a certain group of people, especially young

328
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:50,825
Speaker 5:  progressives, a space to really have these urgent political conversations

329
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:54,305
Speaker 5:  about things like the war on Gaza or climate change and things like that.

330
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:58,105
Speaker 5:  And it seems that seems to have really irked these lawmakers.

331
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:02,545
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think that's definitely a part of the picture here. Although I think

332
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:06,065
Speaker 8:  in the long run we just have to recognize that like TikTok may be a

333
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:09,705
Speaker 8:  friendlier space for some of the politics that we care about right now,

334
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:14,025
Speaker 8:  but in the end, as long as we're reliant on a very small handful

335
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:17,985
Speaker 8:  of privately owned companies, whether they're owned by US

336
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:22,305
Speaker 8:  companies or companies based in other countries to be

337
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:26,025
Speaker 8:  the kind of digital public square, we're always going to be sort of at the

338
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:29,905
Speaker 8:  whim of whoever our digital landlord is, whether it's Elon Musk or Mark

339
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:33,705
Speaker 8:  Zuckerberg or by dance. And so I think again, that's why

340
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:37,865
Speaker 8:  we need more thoughtful and comprehensive policies that get us past the current

341
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:40,865
Speaker 8:  era that we're in and toward The future where we have meaningful choices

342
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:44,985
Speaker 8:  so that If, you are concerned about TikTok or Instagram or any

343
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,965
Speaker 8:  other company and their business practices, you can actually go find somewhere

344
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:52,005
Speaker 8:  else. And just to your other point of this idea that like, oh, well if we

345
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:56,045
Speaker 8:  ban TikTok, everyone can just immediately switch. Big tech companies have

346
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:59,885
Speaker 8:  intentionally made it as difficult as possible to switch

347
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:03,165
Speaker 8:  from one platform to another to bring your followers with you.

348
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:07,325
Speaker 8:  And you know, that really affects marginalized people the most. Maybe if

349
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:11,165
Speaker 8:  you're a big celebrity and you, you know, the app you're on gets banned,

350
00:24:11,165 --> 00:24:14,005
Speaker 8:  you can switch to a different app, everyone's gonna follow you there. If

351
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:17,965
Speaker 8:  you're an L-G-B-T-Q content creator or a musician or someone

352
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:21,805
Speaker 8:  who's spent a lot of time building an audience on one platform and then

353
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:25,485
Speaker 8:  that platform gets ripped out from underneath you, that can have a profound

354
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:28,565
Speaker 8:  impact on your ability to make living your ability to make rent that month,

355
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:32,605
Speaker 8:  your ability to express yourself and connect with your community and your

356
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:36,845
Speaker 8:  audience. So I think we shouldn't dismiss or ignore the real

357
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:40,605
Speaker 8:  human impacts of, you know, these types of measures or

358
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:44,325
Speaker 8:  thinking about banning an entire app or the impact it has on people when

359
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:48,285
Speaker 8:  an app gets bought or sold. I mean, you know it, it personally impacted

360
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:51,725
Speaker 8:  me when Elon Musk bought Twitter, it was someplace I spent a fair amount

361
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:55,325
Speaker 8:  of time building an audience and speaking particularly to other L-G-B-T-Q

362
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:59,245
Speaker 8:  people and then it became a much less friendly place for my community.

363
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:02,525
Speaker 8:  That's a reality that you know, many people have had to deal with and we

364
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:03,405
Speaker 8:  should take it seriously.

365
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:07,045
Speaker 5:  And I think a lot of people also misunderstand the ownership structure of

366
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:11,005
Speaker 5:  TikTok. TikTok is not majority owned by dance, okay? This is

367
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:14,565
Speaker 5:  not how TikTok is owned. TikTok was in a company that was incorporated in

368
00:25:14,565 --> 00:25:18,125
Speaker 5:  America, and it is based in Los Angeles

369
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:22,325
Speaker 5:  and Singapore. It does not operate in China. It is owned

370
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:26,165
Speaker 5:  60% by foreign investors, including many Americans,

371
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:29,965
Speaker 5:  20% owned by employees, including over 7,000 American

372
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:33,125
Speaker 5:  employees and 20% owned by the company's founders. So

373
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:37,965
Speaker 5:  does Bite Dance have a stake in TikTok? Yes, but this is

374
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:41,925
Speaker 5:  not an app that is solely owned by a Chinese corporation. So back in

375
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:45,725
Speaker 5:  2019, the US government forced another Chinese company to give

376
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:49,245
Speaker 5:  up a 60% stake in Grindr, a gay dating app.

377
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:52,445
Speaker 5:  It's bothers me a little bit when people try to make these comparisons because

378
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:56,005
Speaker 5:  Grindr is not a media platform, it is not a social media platform. It's a

379
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:59,445
Speaker 5:  completely different product. Also, the ownership structure is

380
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:03,205
Speaker 5:  completely different. In that case, a Chinese company had majority

381
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:07,005
Speaker 5:  ownership. I it's truly apples to oranges and it is

382
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:09,965
Speaker 5:  very frustrating to sort of debunk all the different ways. This is different.

383
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:13,245
Speaker 5:  Grinder had a completely different corporate ownership structure.

384
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:17,825
Speaker 8:  Well and even more absurdly when the US

385
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:21,785
Speaker 8:  government forced Grindr to sell itself to US company, which they did,

386
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:25,625
Speaker 8:  it wasn't that long ago that data brokers were caught

387
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:29,585
Speaker 8:  collecting and selling information from Grindr to a right wing

388
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:32,905
Speaker 8:  religious group that was using it to track down priests that they thought

389
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:36,665
Speaker 8:  might be gay. So here's an example of where if what we're really

390
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:40,465
Speaker 8:  concerned about is like bad actors might get this data from

391
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,645
Speaker 8:  TikTok, then we need to regulate the

392
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:48,085
Speaker 8:  industry of collecting and selling people's data because the Chinese government,

393
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:51,725
Speaker 8:  if you're concerned about them, could just go buy a lot of the same data

394
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:55,565
Speaker 8:  from data brokers in the US that they could get from TikTok if that's even

395
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:58,125
Speaker 8:  happening, which again, there's no evidence to suggest that it actually is.

396
00:26:58,185 --> 00:26:58,405
Speaker 8:  So

397
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,645
Speaker 5:  Let's dig into some of the national security concerns because I think a lot

398
00:27:01,645 --> 00:27:05,205
Speaker 5:  of people are scared about the data privacy. TikTok has said

399
00:27:05,485 --> 00:27:09,005
Speaker 5:  repeatedly that US user data is stored in Texas on Oracle

400
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:12,645
Speaker 5:  controlled servers. So in order for TikTok to make changes

401
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,925
Speaker 5:  or access that data or the Chinese government was gonna try to access this

402
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,485
Speaker 5:  data, it would have to go through Oracle, which is a US based company to

403
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:23,085
Speaker 5:  access that data, which again is housed in the us. There is no evidence that

404
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:27,605
Speaker 5:  any Chinese entity has even tried to gain access to that data.

405
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:31,725
Speaker 5:  Meanwhile, we know that back in 2016 and many other times,

406
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:35,805
Speaker 5:  foreign governments actually were able to manipulate our social media landscape

407
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:39,845
Speaker 5:  not through any sort of secret data obtaining but

408
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:43,805
Speaker 5:  through buying things like public Facebook ads or buying data publicly.

409
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:47,565
Speaker 5:  So tell me a little bit about these concerns about data privacy and

410
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,245
Speaker 5:  TikTok and whether you think that any of this is warranted.

411
00:27:52,365 --> 00:27:56,335
Speaker 8:  Sure. So people are right to be concerned about TikTok collecting their

412
00:27:56,365 --> 00:28:00,215
Speaker 8:  data. They should just also be as concerned about

413
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:04,775
Speaker 8:  companies like Instagram and Uber and Postmates and your

414
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:08,615
Speaker 8:  dog walking app and almost every other free online

415
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:12,575
Speaker 8:  service that you use collecting your data. And what we know is that

416
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:16,255
Speaker 8:  once a company collects your data, it doesn't necessarily

417
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:20,455
Speaker 8:  stay with that company. There is a massive unregulated data

418
00:28:20,455 --> 00:28:24,415
Speaker 8:  broker industry in the us. Companies collect your data and then sell it

419
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:28,095
Speaker 8:  to other companies who will then sell it to the highest bidder. It's a

420
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:32,135
Speaker 8:  national embarrassment that we do not have basic data privacy laws

421
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:35,935
Speaker 8:  here in the us. So it's almost sort of a funny talking point for TikTok I

422
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:39,815
Speaker 8:  would say to be like, our data is housed in Texas where there's basically

423
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:43,775
Speaker 8:  no privacy protections or laws to protect your data. And we

424
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:47,415
Speaker 8:  have like the Attorney General of Texas, Ken Paxton is like making lists

425
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:51,255
Speaker 8:  of trans people. So it doesn't make me feel particularly safer that my

426
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:55,215
Speaker 8:  data is stored there than if it restored anywhere else. In the end, what

427
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:58,975
Speaker 8:  we need is policies that protect everyone's data, which would start

428
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:02,695
Speaker 8:  with a strong national privacy law here in the US and ideally

429
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,375
Speaker 8:  laws like that all around the world.

430
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:08,205
Speaker 5:  Why hasn't a law like that been passed? Because it seems like such a no-brainer.

431
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,925
Speaker 5:  This is something that consumers have repeatedly asked for.

432
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:15,825
Speaker 8:  It is, and it's where there's so much consensus between human

433
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:19,465
Speaker 8:  rights experts and the business community and others. Like

434
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:23,865
Speaker 8:  everyone agrees a privacy law would be a good idea. The reason it hasn't

435
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:27,505
Speaker 8:  moved forward is basically the same reasons that a lot of other

436
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:31,265
Speaker 8:  legislation doesn't move. It's about corruption, corporate

437
00:29:31,265 --> 00:29:35,065
Speaker 8:  influence, and congressional dysfunction. So the corporate

438
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,745
Speaker 8:  influence part is probably the biggest factor here. Certainly big tech

439
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:42,645
Speaker 8:  companies have been very active in lobbying against strong privacy

440
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:46,685
Speaker 8:  legislation, but it's not just the like Metas and Instagrams

441
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:50,485
Speaker 8:  and YouTubes of the world that care about this, it's Bank of America and

442
00:29:50,485 --> 00:29:54,205
Speaker 8:  Walmart and Target and effectively every other large

443
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:58,285
Speaker 8:  US company that at this point has some interest in being able

444
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:02,165
Speaker 8:  to conduct the type of commercial surveillance that allows them

445
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:05,965
Speaker 8:  to gain a competitive edge. So unfortunately, because of a

446
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:09,725
Speaker 8:  lack of regulation, almost every big company in the US has sort of

447
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,485
Speaker 8:  become a surveillance capitalist company in some capacity

448
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:17,245
Speaker 8:  or other. And that's a big reason why privacy legislation

449
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:20,725
Speaker 8:  hasn't moved forward because it's not just opposed by the tech industry,

450
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:24,365
Speaker 8:  it's sort of posed by Wall Street and the broader

451
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:28,365
Speaker 8:  behemoths of the American economy. And that's what needs to be overcome

452
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:32,605
Speaker 8:  to get something done on this, even though it's overwhelmingly supported

453
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:36,405
Speaker 8:  people from across the political spectrum. Overwhelmingly agree, we

454
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:40,485
Speaker 8:  don't want companies to be able to collect so much of our private information

455
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:44,605
Speaker 8:  and use it to enrich themselves at the cost of our basic rights

456
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:44,965
Speaker 8:  and safety.

457
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:48,725
Speaker 5:  I'm curious what you think about Biden's reversal and all this. you know,

458
00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:52,645
Speaker 5:  back in 2020 it was Trump pushing this ban. Trump has now recognized correctly

459
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:56,605
Speaker 5:  that a ban would actually embolden Facebook, which I

460
00:30:56,605 --> 00:31:00,085
Speaker 5:  guess is his enemy now. And now we have Biden saying that he would sign a

461
00:31:00,085 --> 00:31:03,285
Speaker 5:  bill into law. What do you think led to that flip flop?

462
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:08,005
Speaker 8:  I think it just shows that, again, this is really all about politics, right?

463
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:11,565
Speaker 8:  More than it's about the substance, more than it's about any specific business

464
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:15,725
Speaker 8:  practice. and more than it's about any legitimate concerns, TikTok

465
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:19,485
Speaker 8:  has become a bit of a political football that's being kicked back and forth

466
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:23,605
Speaker 8:  between two parties that are sort of trying to outcompete each other on who

467
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:27,445
Speaker 8:  can be the toughest on China. And all of us in our basic

468
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:30,845
Speaker 8:  rights and free expression are sort of caught in the middle of this

469
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:34,685
Speaker 8:  political football game. But I think, you know, just to say it like, look,

470
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:38,525
Speaker 8:  I am an advocate. I run a nonpartisan nonprofit. We focus

471
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,165
Speaker 8:  on advocating for people's rights. So I don't get involved in

472
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:45,925
Speaker 8:  electoral politics, but just it doesn't take an expert to sit back and be

473
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:49,285
Speaker 8:  like, it would be bad politics for any lawmaker

474
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:53,245
Speaker 8:  or certainly any sitting president or presidential hopeful

475
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,445
Speaker 8:  to get on board with the idea of banning an app that is disproportionately

476
00:31:57,475 --> 00:32:01,405
Speaker 8:  used by young people who are the voters that both parties are desperately

477
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:05,125
Speaker 8:  trying to court. And so it just strikes me as like deeply

478
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:09,205
Speaker 8:  silly and absurd, and especially now that Trump has come out and

479
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:12,845
Speaker 8:  said that he's against a TikTok ban, Biden would just be walking into the

480
00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:16,485
Speaker 8:  most obvious trap ever. If he were to sign a bill banning

481
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:20,285
Speaker 8:  TikTok and hand Trump this talking point to beat him over the head with,

482
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:24,205
Speaker 8:  especially with the young voters that he is really struggling to

483
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,205
Speaker 8:  keep support from, especially given his ongoing support of

484
00:32:28,505 --> 00:32:31,965
Speaker 8:  the violence in Gaza and a lot of other issues that young people

485
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:36,285
Speaker 8:  are concerned about and talking about on TikTok primarily.

486
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:40,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you know, speaking of playing politics, TikTok was also accused of

487
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:44,125
Speaker 5:  playing politics by quote unquote forcing users to contact their

488
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,925
Speaker 5:  representatives and express their opinion on the van. Just to be clear,

489
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:51,405
Speaker 5:  TikTok didn't force users to do anything despite what Congress people are

490
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:55,045
Speaker 5:  claiming. How do you think that push alert that they sent helped or hurt

491
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:56,045
Speaker 5:  them? Yeah,

492
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:59,685
Speaker 8:  You know, I mean I think it's hard to say, right? Certainly many members

493
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:03,085
Speaker 8:  of Congress have leaned into that talking point and said like, see, look,

494
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:06,965
Speaker 8:  here's the proof that they have all this power to manipulate people. I

495
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:10,885
Speaker 8:  mean, I'm old enough to remember the SOPA blackout when Wikipedia and

496
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:15,085
Speaker 8:  thousands of other websites blacked out their homepage to protest internet

497
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:18,725
Speaker 8:  censorship legislation that could have led to widespread harm

498
00:33:18,785 --> 00:33:22,765
Speaker 8:  online. So this is not a brand new thing that said,

499
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:25,965
Speaker 8:  you know, I couldn't tell you whether it was, you know, helpful or hurtful

500
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:29,645
Speaker 8:  to their case in Washington DC because in the end, I think this does come

501
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:33,445
Speaker 8:  down to politics and sort of what lawmakers think is gonna help or

502
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,885
Speaker 8:  hurt them in the election. I should have mentioned this earlier, but just

503
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:40,765
Speaker 8:  like the timeline that has been laid out in this bill of when a

504
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:44,485
Speaker 8:  sale would have to be forced is suspiciously timed to be

505
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:47,925
Speaker 8:  before the election, right? And so I think again, that does show us that

506
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,845
Speaker 8:  like more than this is about China and more than this is about data

507
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:55,565
Speaker 8:  more than this is about speech, this is about 2024,

508
00:33:56,065 --> 00:34:00,005
Speaker 8:  and politicians sort of jockeying for position with TikTok as

509
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,405
Speaker 8:  a ball that they're kicking back and forth.

510
00:34:01,985 --> 00:34:05,685
Speaker 5:  I'm so glad you brought up SOPA and that blackout because there's been so

511
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:09,565
Speaker 5:  many efforts over the years from tech companies and startups

512
00:34:09,745 --> 00:34:13,405
Speaker 5:  to push certain pieces of legislation through Congress and otherwise. I'm

513
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:16,525
Speaker 5:  also thinking of all of the work that companies did around net neutrality.

514
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:19,325
Speaker 5:  I mean, for a while you couldn't log onto Tumblr back in the day without

515
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:23,085
Speaker 5:  being hit with this big message about this net neutrality legislation that

516
00:34:23,285 --> 00:34:27,045
Speaker 5:  Congress wanted to pass. More recently, other tech companies have pushed

517
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:30,525
Speaker 5:  messaging to users about legislation they felt would threaten their businesses

518
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:34,725
Speaker 5:  directly. Instacart, Uber, Lyft, Postmates, DoorDash have all engaged in

519
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:38,765
Speaker 5:  this type of behavior. In 2020, Uber users in California had to confirm

520
00:34:38,765 --> 00:34:42,125
Speaker 5:  that they'd seen a message before calling the ride, which told them that

521
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:45,965
Speaker 5:  wait times and prices would rise if this legislation called Prop

522
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:49,765
Speaker 5:  22 wasn't passed. And Uber actually sent repeated push

523
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:52,885
Speaker 5:  notifications to users warning them about Prop 22.

524
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:57,285
Speaker 5:  Instacart workers were also even instructed to insert stickers and flyers

525
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:01,245
Speaker 5:  endorsing a pretty controversial California ballot measure into

526
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:05,045
Speaker 5:  customers shopping bags at grocery stores. I really agreed with The Verge

527
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:08,565
Speaker 5:  as Miato who said, you know, it's really weird to act like this type of behavior

528
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:12,645
Speaker 5:  isn't standard. And I think that these lawmakers trying to spin it as like

529
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:16,685
Speaker 5:  China pushing its agenda on the American public are ignoring a

530
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:20,445
Speaker 5:  long history of tech companies and startups doing exactly this.

531
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:24,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah, absolutely. And look like this is how companies operate

532
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:28,805
Speaker 8:  in a capitalist system. We should reckon with that and then

533
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:33,005
Speaker 8:  decide what we want to do as a society and what sorts of rules should be

534
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,725
Speaker 8:  governing technology and recognize that companies are gonna

535
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:40,685
Speaker 8:  try to influence that. And it's up to us as a society to push

536
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,165
Speaker 8:  back on that influence and do what actually needs to be done.

537
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, and I certainly would never argue, well Uber did something, therefore

538
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:51,045
Speaker 5:  it's totally fine that TikTok is to it. I think it's pretty dark that it

539
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:54,485
Speaker 5:  is so common. But to sort of ignore that history to me is

540
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:58,765
Speaker 5:  disingenuous. What should average users do who are against

541
00:35:58,795 --> 00:35:59,805
Speaker 5:  this type of bill?

542
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:04,255
Speaker 8:  You know, I actually think it's still really important that people do

543
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:07,935
Speaker 8:  call and email their members of Congress about this. And I would even encourage

544
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:11,855
Speaker 8:  you to call and say, I am not calling from that TikTok push notification.

545
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:16,335
Speaker 8:  I really care about this because I care about free speech

546
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:20,335
Speaker 8:  and human rights. I want you to pass privacy legislation instead of

547
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:24,335
Speaker 8:  banning TikTok. We have a campaign, my organization fight for The future

548
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:28,655
Speaker 8:  at don't ban TikTok dot com that has that exact messaging. So it's not just

549
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:32,495
Speaker 8:  saying, Hey, Congress, don't do anything. It's saying pass

550
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:36,295
Speaker 8:  privacy laws if you're concerned about this, rather than banning TikTok.

551
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:39,695
Speaker 8:  And I think that that is really important because again, there's some of

552
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:43,575
Speaker 8:  this that is just about political posturing and stoking

553
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:47,575
Speaker 8:  xenophobia and you know, kind of saying whatever politicians think

554
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:51,335
Speaker 8:  is gonna sound good on Fox News and M-S-N-B-C. But there's some

555
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:55,335
Speaker 8:  amount of it that is like lawmakers having genuine concerns. And to the

556
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:58,815
Speaker 8:  extent there are lawmakers with genuine concerns, it's important that we

557
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:02,455
Speaker 8:  tell them that there are alternatives, that there are things that they can

558
00:37:02,455 --> 00:37:06,295
Speaker 8:  do to address those concerns, but that banning TikTok is not one of them.

559
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:10,215
Speaker 8:  So I would encourage everyone to write an email their senators since

560
00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:13,935
Speaker 8:  this is now really a Senate issue, and tell them to

561
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,655
Speaker 8:  pass a privacy law instead of banning TikTok. The more they hear from people,

562
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:21,575
Speaker 8:  it does matter. I know sometimes it sounds, it feels like they're just ignoring

563
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:25,335
Speaker 8:  you, they never listen. But I can tell you that congressional staffers,

564
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:29,015
Speaker 8:  when their phone starts ringing off the hook, it does make a difference.

565
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:33,015
Speaker 8:  It does give them pause. It may not always translate into what their boss

566
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:37,095
Speaker 8:  says on tv, but it does have an impact on how they end up voting or

567
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:40,855
Speaker 8:  whether the legislation even goes to the floor. The more that

568
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:44,735
Speaker 8:  particularly Chuck Schumer Senate majority leader gets the sense that this

569
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:48,215
Speaker 8:  is controversial and would be a bad look, the less likely

570
00:37:48,555 --> 00:37:52,015
Speaker 8:  he is to move it forward. I could very much see a scenario where they just

571
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:55,375
Speaker 8:  to kind of decide, yeah, we'll keep talking about this TikTok thing, but

572
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,255
Speaker 8:  we're just gonna kind of like hope that people forget about it and never

573
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:01,895
Speaker 8:  bring it to the floor. I wouldn't be surprised if that happens, but

574
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:06,215
Speaker 8:  if people don't speak out, we could end up in a really dangerous

575
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:10,295
Speaker 8:  situation here and I could see an environment where they sort of accidentally

576
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,535
Speaker 8:  actually succeed in banning TikTok and the political consequences of that

577
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:15,495
Speaker 8:  could be really dire.

578
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:18,935
Speaker 5:  I think a lot of the conversations around this app and the way that people

579
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:22,495
Speaker 5:  have talked about China, and I'm thinking of when Tiktoks

580
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:26,255
Speaker 5:  CEO was hauled in front of Congress and was repeatedly asked if he was an

581
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:29,575
Speaker 5:  agent of the Chinese Communist Party, despite the fact that he's Singaporean

582
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:31,895
Speaker 5:  and served in the Singaporean military.

583
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:33,495
Speaker 8:  Have you ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party?

584
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,405
Speaker 10:  Senator? I'm Singaporean, no.

585
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:39,005
Speaker 11:  Have you ever been associated or affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party?

586
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:41,005
Speaker 10:  No. Senator, again, I'm Singaporean.

587
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:44,685
Speaker 5:  It just makes it seem like a lot of this stuff is motivated by

588
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:48,525
Speaker 5:  xenophobia. How much of a role do you think that's playing in the way that

589
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:49,645
Speaker 5:  these conversations are happening?

590
00:38:50,405 --> 00:38:54,205
Speaker 8:  I think it plays a huge role and I think it's unserious

591
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:58,205
Speaker 8:  to pretend that it doesn't, right? Like there are legitimate

592
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,685
Speaker 8:  concerns and they can be separated from this kind of

593
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:04,925
Speaker 8:  generalized xenophobia and anti-Chinese

594
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:09,005
Speaker 8:  anti-Asian sentiment. But it's just foolish and ridiculous to

595
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:12,405
Speaker 8:  pretend that that's not a huge factor that is

596
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:16,685
Speaker 8:  animating this attack on TikTok. And let's be real that it's not

597
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:20,125
Speaker 8:  just Republicans. There are unfortunately many

598
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:24,405
Speaker 8:  Democrats that are happy to lean into those types of xenophobic

599
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:28,525
Speaker 8:  and anti-Asian narratives so that they can again kind of be one-upping

600
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:31,965
Speaker 8:  their Republican opponents on who's tougher on China.

601
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:36,485
Speaker 8:  And look, you know, I'm an anti-authoritarian. I care a

602
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:39,725
Speaker 8:  lot about civil liberties and civil rights. I have a lot of concerns about

603
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:43,325
Speaker 8:  the Chinese government and their policies. Just like I have a lot of concerns

604
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:47,205
Speaker 8:  about most other governments and their policies. So this doesn't

605
00:39:47,205 --> 00:39:50,645
Speaker 8:  mean you can't criticize the Chinese government or that you can't raise

606
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:54,365
Speaker 8:  concerns about the Chinese government's very small stake

607
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:58,405
Speaker 8:  in by dance, which has a stake in TikTok. But there are ways to

608
00:39:58,405 --> 00:40:01,485
Speaker 8:  do that without leaning into these xenophobic and anti-Asian

609
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,605
Speaker 8:  narratives. But unfortunately that's not what lawmakers have been doing.

610
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:08,325
Speaker 8:  They're very much pouring gasoline on those types of flames.

611
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:11,765
Speaker 8:  And we should be honest about the fact that that has deadly consequences.

612
00:40:12,265 --> 00:40:16,245
Speaker 8:  We know there has been a massive uptick in anti-Asian hate crimes

613
00:40:16,885 --> 00:40:20,645
Speaker 8:  here in the United States over the last number of years as more and more

614
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,765
Speaker 8:  lawmakers have leaned into this type of rhetoric. And we should be honest

615
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:28,565
Speaker 8:  about the fact that folks that are kind of jumping on this bandwagon of

616
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:32,365
Speaker 8:  let's ban TikTok because China are either knowingly

617
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:36,285
Speaker 8:  or or unwittingly helping pour gasoline on those flames.

618
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:40,365
Speaker 8:  And it could really have terrible consequences for some really

619
00:40:40,365 --> 00:40:42,605
Speaker 8:  vulnerable communities here in the US and around the world.

620
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:47,205
Speaker 5:  We were talking about corporate lobbying, and I just think back to

621
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:51,045
Speaker 5:  the story my colleague Drew Harwell and I did a year or two ago about meta

622
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:55,165
Speaker 5:  hiring this Republican political firm to go out and smear

623
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:58,925
Speaker 5:  TikTok in local news across the country, which they were able to do quite

624
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:02,485
Speaker 5:  successfully. We know that they are one of the biggest lobbyists in

625
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:06,525
Speaker 5:  DC political reported that they had outspent many other companies, most

626
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:10,325
Speaker 5:  other tech companies in terms of lobbying dollars. What role

627
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:13,285
Speaker 5:  is meta playing in all of this? Because they love to say, well, we haven't

628
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:17,525
Speaker 5:  actually asked for an outright ban, but I can't imagine what else this

629
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:18,885
Speaker 5:  type of lobbying would lead to.

630
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:23,325
Speaker 8:  Absolutely. I mean, meta has been incredibly aggressive at

631
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:27,085
Speaker 8:  trying to attain total monopoly status. Their

632
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:30,805
Speaker 8:  MO has been, they either buy or try to kill off

633
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:35,005
Speaker 8:  any competitor that comes along that poses a meaningful challenge to their

634
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:38,525
Speaker 8:  dominance. And they have absolutely been behind some of this

635
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:42,485
Speaker 8:  sentiment and attacks on TikTok. I just saw on TV the other day,

636
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:46,245
Speaker 8:  the head of the Chamber of Progress, which is one of the sort of lobbying

637
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:49,965
Speaker 8:  front groups that works for Meta and other big tech companies coming

638
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:53,965
Speaker 8:  out in support of this bill that would ban TikTok even though they push

639
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:57,725
Speaker 8:  back against basically every other type of regulation that

640
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:01,605
Speaker 8:  could actually meaningfully address this issue like antitrust laws for

641
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:05,285
Speaker 8:  example. And so again, that really just exposes the fact that

642
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:09,125
Speaker 8:  this is not really about addressing concerns, it's about

643
00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:13,445
Speaker 8:  entrenching US dominance. And frankly, it could lead to a world where

644
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:17,725
Speaker 8:  we have an even more concentrated tech market in the us which would

645
00:42:17,725 --> 00:42:21,685
Speaker 8:  be insane. And again, exposes some of the hypocrisy here. Joe Biden

646
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:25,605
Speaker 8:  has been very outspoken about how there's too much power in the

647
00:42:25,605 --> 00:42:29,045
Speaker 8:  hands of these big corporations and we should break them up and you know,

648
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:32,965
Speaker 8:  pass antitrust reforms and take on big tech. And in the meantime, he's

649
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:36,725
Speaker 8:  basically saying he's gonna sign a bill that would kill off

650
00:42:36,745 --> 00:42:40,485
Speaker 8:  one of Facebook's biggest competitors and lead to even less

651
00:42:41,085 --> 00:42:44,725
Speaker 8:  choice and less options for us consumers who wanna find a place

652
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:46,365
Speaker 8:  online to express themselves.

653
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:51,005
Speaker 5:  And a huge reason why musically was forced to sell to Bite Dance in

654
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:54,925
Speaker 5:  2017 is because it was having an increasingly difficult time going up

655
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:58,845
Speaker 5:  against Meta and Instagram musically was being run dry

656
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:02,685
Speaker 5:  by Instagram, who was poaching all of music, Lee's top talent, cloning a

657
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:06,405
Speaker 5:  lot of their video features, and musically at that time

658
00:43:06,665 --> 00:43:09,605
Speaker 5:  did not have the resources to compete with Meta part. That is part of the

659
00:43:09,605 --> 00:43:13,405
Speaker 5:  reason it sold to such a big company. And you know, as the Wall Street Journal

660
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:17,485
Speaker 5:  reported, TikTok spent a billion dollars in app download marketing just to

661
00:43:17,485 --> 00:43:20,885
Speaker 5:  sort of get that initial traction and boost after the rebranded 2018.

662
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:25,485
Speaker 5:  So that is the level of resources that you have to have

663
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:29,205
Speaker 5:  to go up against these tech giants. And I think it's quite telling that

664
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:33,685
Speaker 5:  the only app that can even remotely give meta and Google a

665
00:43:33,685 --> 00:43:36,965
Speaker 5:  run for their money has to be backed by another giant

666
00:43:37,195 --> 00:43:40,245
Speaker 5:  multi-billion dollar tech conglomerate because that's the level of resources

667
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:42,005
Speaker 5:  that you need to compete with this duopoly.

668
00:43:42,805 --> 00:43:46,735
Speaker 8:  Well, what's even funnier too is that, you know, tiktoks format of

669
00:43:46,735 --> 00:43:50,655
Speaker 8:  these short form videos is not actually brand new. That some of

670
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:54,575
Speaker 8:  you may be old enough to remember Vine, right, which was

671
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:58,135
Speaker 8:  basically killed off by meta when they revoked their

672
00:43:58,295 --> 00:44:02,055
Speaker 8:  API access to intentionally crush a

673
00:44:02,055 --> 00:44:06,015
Speaker 8:  competitor, right? And so we could have had a American owned

674
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,895
Speaker 8:  version of TikTok as apparently lawmakers say they want,

675
00:44:10,195 --> 00:44:14,095
Speaker 8:  but because we have no meaningful anti-monopoly protections here in the

676
00:44:14,115 --> 00:44:18,015
Speaker 8:  us, we allowed meta to kill off what could have become the US version of

677
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,775
Speaker 8:  TikTok. And so I think again, that just exposes that like these

678
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:25,455
Speaker 8:  discussions are not very serious right now, that there are real

679
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,655
Speaker 8:  measures we could take to address the concerns we have about the current

680
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:32,485
Speaker 8:  social media ecosystem. That's not what's being talked about in Washington

681
00:44:32,745 --> 00:44:34,325
Speaker 8:  DC right now, unfortunately.

682
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:39,025
Speaker 5:  I think that is such a good point about Vine and I did a lot of reporting

683
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:42,785
Speaker 5:  on Instagram's aggressive moves to crush Vine

684
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:46,265
Speaker 5:  Court, their talent steal all of their video features. That was wild.

685
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:50,625
Speaker 5:  All right, Evan, well thank you so much for chatting with us today. I really

686
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:54,305
Speaker 5:  appreciate you taking your time. Where can people follow the work that you're

687
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:54,465
Speaker 5:  doing?

688
00:44:55,045 --> 00:44:57,985
Speaker 8:  You can follow me on Twitter, blue sky

689
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:02,985
Speaker 8:  mastodon, Instagram, just find my name, Evan

690
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,985
Speaker 8:  Greer, E-V-A-N-G-R-E-E-R, and then go to fight for The

691
00:45:06,985 --> 00:45:10,265
Speaker 8:  future dot org, which is the organization I help run. And you can learn about

692
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:13,825
Speaker 8:  our various campaigns protecting people's basic rights in the digital age.

693
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,425
Speaker 5:  Thanks Evan. Thank

694
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:15,545
Speaker 8:  You.

695
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:23,465
Speaker 5:  When we come back, we are gonna find out why Shrimp Jesus has taken over

696
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:24,625
Speaker 5:  Facebook and more

697
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:42,885
Speaker 5:  and we're gonna run through some stories from the week.

698
00:47:43,265 --> 00:47:45,525
Speaker 15:  All right, hey, let's, let's do it. I put

699
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:49,445
Speaker 17:  100 people inside of a giant circle and whoever leaves the

700
00:47:49,445 --> 00:47:53,405
Speaker 17:  circle last wins $500,000. But If, you touch the red line,

701
00:47:54,395 --> 00:47:54,885
Speaker 17:  it's game

702
00:47:54,885 --> 00:47:58,485
Speaker 5:  Over. I wrote a story about this this week, but Mr. Beast struck a deal with

703
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:02,045
Speaker 5:  Amazon MGM to produce a massive reality TV competition show.

704
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:06,485
Speaker 5:  This is pretty big news because it's Jimmy Donaldson's first foray into

705
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:10,205
Speaker 5:  traditional entertainment. The show is gonna be called Beast Games and it'll

706
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:14,045
Speaker 5:  feature a thousand contestants competing for a $5 million cash payout,

707
00:48:14,095 --> 00:48:17,325
Speaker 5:  which is actually the biggest prize offered in TV history.

708
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:21,645
Speaker 5:  The Hollywood reporter said that Amazon outbid at least one other major streaming

709
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:25,325
Speaker 5:  service to land this deal. Mr. Beast has become the most subscribed to

710
00:48:25,325 --> 00:48:28,765
Speaker 5:  individual on YouTube in recent years, and he has a massive audience of children.

711
00:48:29,395 --> 00:48:32,765
Speaker 5:  He's really known for these outrageous stunts like burying himself alive

712
00:48:33,065 --> 00:48:37,045
Speaker 5:  or recreating the show Squid Game as this reality TV style competition.

713
00:48:37,605 --> 00:48:40,085
Speaker 5:  I think this is a really notable moment for the entertainment industry because

714
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,885
Speaker 5:  it shows how these streaming platforms are willing to pay a lot of money

715
00:48:43,025 --> 00:48:47,005
Speaker 5:  to court these big online content creators in an effort to absorb some

716
00:48:47,005 --> 00:48:50,645
Speaker 5:  of their audience. I think what remains to be seen is whether Jimmy

717
00:48:50,645 --> 00:48:54,205
Speaker 5:  Donaldson's audience will actually hop over and watch this show on Amazon.

718
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:58,405
Speaker 5:  There's been a lot of other efforts to take internet talent and move them

719
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:01,925
Speaker 5:  into more traditional forms of entertainment, mostly linear TV or

720
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:05,365
Speaker 5:  traditional movies. And that has always flopped. He set his channel between

721
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:08,685
Speaker 5:  makes between 600 million and $700 million a year, and he

722
00:49:08,965 --> 00:49:12,845
Speaker 5:  reinvests most of that back into his stunts, building

723
00:49:13,145 --> 00:49:16,645
Speaker 5:  his channel and his media empire even more. So, who knows? I doubt that Amazon

724
00:49:16,645 --> 00:49:19,965
Speaker 5:  will give him exactly the same production budget as he usually has, but maybe,

725
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:23,005
Speaker 5:  you know, they're, they're investing quite a lot in him and I'm sure they

726
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,085
Speaker 5:  want the show to be successful.

727
00:49:24,825 --> 00:49:28,205
Speaker 15:  Amazon famously spends a lot of money on their shows

728
00:49:28,785 --> 00:49:32,645
Speaker 15:  and really does a poor job of promoting them. I

729
00:49:32,645 --> 00:49:36,205
Speaker 15:  haven't seen them with any like breakout reality or game shows.

730
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:40,245
Speaker 15:  A lot of their scripted stuff has, has just not done that well. They've,

731
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:44,115
Speaker 15:  they spent like a billion dollars on Lord of the Rings and it just

732
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:47,355
Speaker 15:  didn't really make a, make a splash. So I think a lot of stuff tends to

733
00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:51,195
Speaker 15:  get buried on Amazon. Netflix has had quite a bit of success with

734
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:53,835
Speaker 15:  reality shows, game shows, stuff like that, that that seems like it probably

735
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:57,595
Speaker 15:  would've been a better fit for him audience wise. I'm sure Amazon

736
00:49:57,735 --> 00:50:01,675
Speaker 15:  outbid whoever they were up against. But you know, the thing

737
00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:05,235
Speaker 15:  that happens over and over again is when your audience is in one place,

738
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:07,395
Speaker 15:  it's really hard to get them to another place.

739
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:11,355
Speaker 5:  Well, he's also not stopping production on YouTube, right? So he's gonna

740
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:15,435
Speaker 5:  continue to post on YouTube throughout this deal. And

741
00:50:15,435 --> 00:50:19,275
Speaker 5:  so yeah, it just remains to be seen whether the audience will hop over

742
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:23,065
Speaker 5:  and also watch on Amazon. That said, I mean, other, other

743
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:26,785
Speaker 5:  children's shows have had success. Coco Mellon jumped over.

744
00:50:27,035 --> 00:50:29,885
Speaker 5:  It's more of a sort of cartoon children's

745
00:50:30,785 --> 00:50:34,485
Speaker 5:  series and Mr. Beast audience is also children. So, you know, If, you can

746
00:50:34,485 --> 00:50:38,445
Speaker 5:  plop your child down in front of the TV and turn on the Mr. Beast game show

747
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:41,445
Speaker 5:  for an hour and distract them. I, you know, maybe,

748
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:45,725
Speaker 15:  And I, I do feel like every parent I know has Amazon, like If. you have

749
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:49,485
Speaker 15:  kids, you probably have an Amazon subscription, so it,

750
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:51,765
Speaker 15:  it's, it's all right there for you potentially.

751
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:56,445
Speaker 5:  If you've been on Facebook at all recently, you might have noticed that more

752
00:50:56,445 --> 00:51:00,285
Speaker 5:  and more AI generated images are creeping into your feed. These images can

753
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:03,605
Speaker 5:  be strange, bizarre sometimes they're very beautiful and they're usually

754
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:07,645
Speaker 5:  posted by anonymously run pages. But since last week, one

755
00:51:07,885 --> 00:51:11,645
Speaker 5:  specific type of image has become pervasive and that is AI generated

756
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:15,605
Speaker 5:  portrayals of Jesus Christ made out of live shrimp. These pictures

757
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:19,085
Speaker 5:  are really crazy and slightly grotesque, and they've been generating a massive

758
00:51:19,085 --> 00:51:22,685
Speaker 5:  amount of likes and shares every single time they're posted shrimp. Jesus

759
00:51:22,985 --> 00:51:26,925
Speaker 5:  is actually just the latest engagement hack by these spammy types of pages,

760
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:30,805
Speaker 5:  doing what's called engagement farming. Basically they're posting something

761
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:34,645
Speaker 5:  so bad and crazy and absurd that it makes people stop, comment, or

762
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:38,605
Speaker 5:  share. This then pushes that page's reach up and allows them

763
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:42,525
Speaker 5:  to get other content more easily into your feed. After they

764
00:51:42,525 --> 00:51:45,805
Speaker 5:  boost their reach with shrimp Jesus, they start pushing other low quality

765
00:51:45,805 --> 00:51:49,725
Speaker 5:  content into your feed, like fake news websites full of Google ads, or

766
00:51:49,725 --> 00:51:53,605
Speaker 5:  they try to sell you low quality products. This is how they effectively monetize.

767
00:51:53,745 --> 00:51:57,605
Speaker 5:  So when you see these really weird AI generated images all over, you might

768
00:51:57,605 --> 00:52:01,005
Speaker 5:  just think that they're fun or weird or being shared all in good fun.

769
00:52:01,435 --> 00:52:05,125
Speaker 5:  This is all actually part of a big moneymaking scheme that's increasingly

770
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,205
Speaker 5:  common on Facebook.

771
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:10,525
Speaker 15:  Honestly, I get the rubber necker approach to this. Like, you're, you're

772
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:14,125
Speaker 15:  cruising through Facebook and then you just halt and you, you share or you

773
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:17,925
Speaker 15:  comment. What the fuck is going on? Seeing Jesus as a shrimp, is

774
00:52:18,425 --> 00:52:21,005
Speaker 15:  it, it is uncomfortable to look at this image.

775
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:25,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's quite terrifying. I think scammers are always ahead of the game

776
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:29,165
Speaker 5:  when it comes to what performs online. I've seen a lot of other AI

777
00:52:29,165 --> 00:52:32,405
Speaker 5:  character driven pages as well on Facebook, which are essentially

778
00:52:32,795 --> 00:52:36,765
Speaker 5:  anonymously run pages that purport to be a specific person. I saw

779
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:40,365
Speaker 5:  one woman saying, I'm 120 1-year-old baker

780
00:52:40,705 --> 00:52:44,405
Speaker 5:  and I love to bake these peachy confections, and it's just

781
00:52:44,705 --> 00:52:48,165
Speaker 5:  AI generated images of this old woman

782
00:52:48,505 --> 00:52:52,365
Speaker 5:  and various types of cakes. Yeah. And this whole Facebook page

783
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:55,645
Speaker 5:  is ostensibly supposed to be run by this

784
00:52:55,785 --> 00:52:59,005
Speaker 5:  120 1-year-old woman, which I think would make her the oldest woman in the

785
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:02,925
Speaker 5:  world. Yeah, and it's, it looks so obviously fake, but the comments

786
00:53:03,025 --> 00:53:05,845
Speaker 5:  on the post make it seem like, I don't even think people really care.

787
00:53:07,345 --> 00:53:10,805
Speaker 5:  I'm currently reporting on a similar phenomenon on Instagram, so my story

788
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:13,685
Speaker 5:  will be out soon. But I really do think that we're just seeing more and more

789
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:16,405
Speaker 5:  of this AI engagement bait all over the internet.

790
00:53:16,675 --> 00:53:17,725
Speaker 15:  Yeah. Boomer bait

791
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:22,525
Speaker 5:  Also happening on Facebook. Meta redesigned aspects of the app to

792
00:53:22,525 --> 00:53:26,285
Speaker 5:  emphasize the poke button, again, for people that don't remember Poke was

793
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:29,085
Speaker 5:  this really popular feature back in the aughts where you could really just

794
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:31,925
Speaker 5:  send little pokes to people, which just, you'd just get a little message

795
00:53:31,945 --> 00:53:35,685
Speaker 5:  saying, I poked you. Or, so-and-so poked you. This redesign

796
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:39,845
Speaker 5:  apparently works 'cause there's been a 13 x jump in use of the feature. I

797
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:43,725
Speaker 5:  think this is just Facebook trying to bait people into engaging on the

798
00:53:43,725 --> 00:53:47,405
Speaker 5:  app in any way that they can. I think there's tons of nostalgia

799
00:53:47,585 --> 00:53:51,525
Speaker 5:  for the aughts, especially among millennials. Nostalgia stuff plays really

800
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:55,445
Speaker 5:  well. This is a feature that a lot of millennials associate with their

801
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:59,045
Speaker 5:  youth back when we had Facebook in college and would poke each other and

802
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:02,605
Speaker 5:  things in our dorm, and so I think this is kind of a, a naked

803
00:54:02,915 --> 00:54:06,765
Speaker 5:  play for engagement. Zuckerberg posted after they announced the uptick

804
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:08,925
Speaker 5:  in the feature that quote, nature is healing.

805
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:13,605
Speaker 15:  I don't know why we need this. I, I don't use Facebook anymore, so

806
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:17,365
Speaker 15:  it's not for me, but I don't know why we need this. And it, it just feels

807
00:54:17,365 --> 00:54:21,085
Speaker 15:  like an excuse for more notifications and I'm just like

808
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:23,725
Speaker 15:  pretty Anti notification at these at this point.

809
00:54:23,905 --> 00:54:25,805
Speaker 5:  Me too. I have all my notifications turned off.

810
00:54:26,235 --> 00:54:26,525
Speaker 15:  Same

811
00:54:28,245 --> 00:54:31,845
Speaker 5:  LinkedIn, which recently surpassed a billion users and is primarily known

812
00:54:31,845 --> 00:54:35,205
Speaker 5:  as a place to find your next job, is now trying to court gamers in an effort

813
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:39,165
Speaker 5:  to boost time on the platform. They're rolling out in-app games. The company

814
00:54:39,265 --> 00:54:43,125
Speaker 5:  is testing three puzzle type games so far, and I think this

815
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:46,245
Speaker 5:  move is really smart because it taps into the puzzle mania that helped other

816
00:54:46,485 --> 00:54:49,725
Speaker 5:  platforms like the New York Times Boost engagement with things like Wordle

817
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:53,525
Speaker 5:  and Connections. I know people that play every day. Facebook also launched

818
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:57,085
Speaker 5:  Farmville back in 2009, and time spent on the platform skyrocketed.

819
00:54:57,565 --> 00:55:00,845
Speaker 5:  I think a lot of these social media companies have integrated gaming aspects

820
00:55:00,845 --> 00:55:04,765
Speaker 5:  over the years with quite positive results. It's also worth noting

821
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:07,925
Speaker 5:  that the company is owned by Microsoft, a gaming giant that made over

822
00:55:07,925 --> 00:55:11,885
Speaker 5:  $7 billion last quarter in gaming alone. So this just

823
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:15,245
Speaker 5:  seems like smart synergy and if people can spend a little bit more time on

824
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:19,125
Speaker 5:  LinkedIn playing Word games or whatever, that's good for the company.

825
00:55:19,955 --> 00:55:23,765
Speaker 15:  Yeah. I totally get why LinkedIn would wanna do this

826
00:55:23,785 --> 00:55:27,285
Speaker 15:  and why it makes business sense, but if you're spending a ton of time

827
00:55:28,065 --> 00:55:31,445
Speaker 15:  on LinkedIn playing games, I don't think you're using LinkedIn correctly.

828
00:55:31,505 --> 00:55:35,005
Speaker 15:  You're probably not finding that new job you're after, you know?

829
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:38,165
Speaker 5:  But that's not really what LinkedIn is anymore. I mean, LinkedIn is a pretty

830
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:42,045
Speaker 5:  robust social network. People spend a lot of time on their

831
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:45,845
Speaker 5:  learning and yeah, talking with people and sharing news.

832
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:50,125
Speaker 5:  Since Twitter declined, LinkedIn has become a huge hub for news and

833
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:53,245
Speaker 5:  information. People go there in the morning, you check in on your LinkedIn,

834
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:57,325
Speaker 5:  see what your connections are up to. It's not only looking for work, obviously

835
00:55:57,325 --> 00:56:00,925
Speaker 5:  that's sort of was the initial point of the platform, but I do think

836
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:04,885
Speaker 5:  it's sort of just this robust professional networking platform

837
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:05,165
Speaker 5:  now.

838
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:09,805
Speaker 15:  Yeah, I, I've had LinkedIn probably 12 years. I don't think I've

839
00:56:09,805 --> 00:56:13,685
Speaker 15:  ever had a shred of fun on that platform, and I think

840
00:56:13,685 --> 00:56:17,525
Speaker 15:  it's useful. I think it's like super useful and yeah, I wouldn't

841
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:18,285
Speaker 15:  associate it with games.

842
00:56:18,645 --> 00:56:22,445
Speaker 5:  I mean, I think it's smart because it keeps people engaged. Yeah. You might

843
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:26,365
Speaker 5:  be on LinkedIn, networking, chatting, sending some

844
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:30,325
Speaker 5:  messages, waiting for some messages to come through and wanna play a

845
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:33,805
Speaker 5:  crossword or puzzle or something, you know? Yeah. I think it makes sense.

846
00:56:33,945 --> 00:56:37,925
Speaker 5:  As you mentioned, it's not always the most entertaining platform. Microsoft

847
00:56:38,225 --> 00:56:41,645
Speaker 5:  has a lot of staking in gaming and this makes sense.

848
00:56:42,155 --> 00:56:45,645
Speaker 15:  Yeah. This reminds me of a tweet I saw that was like the New York Times.

849
00:56:46,145 --> 00:56:50,045
Speaker 15:  You mean that place where I play my little games? It's like maybe that's

850
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:50,685
Speaker 15:  LinkedIn's future.

851
