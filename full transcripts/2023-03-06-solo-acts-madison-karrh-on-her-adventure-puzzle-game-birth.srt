19
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,500
Speaker 4:  Ashley.

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,420
Speaker 5:  Hi.

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,100
Speaker 4:  You've been working on a really cool episode. It sounds like

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,460
Speaker 4:  all about video games. All about a video

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,260
Speaker 5:  Game. A video game. Well, a video game developer. Okay. I

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,620
Speaker 5:  love video games and I love indie games.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,940
Speaker 5:  The joy, the thrill of discovering a cool indie game

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,060
Speaker 5:  is just, there's nothing else like it. And so I am talking today

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,660
Speaker 5:  to solo game developer Madison Carr.

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,020
Speaker 4:  Well, why Madison?

29
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,500
Speaker 5:  I first met her last year at Summer Game Fest in June. I

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,100
Speaker 5:  was immediately drawn to her game, which is called Birth.

31
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,940
Speaker 4:  What's birth about?

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,260
Speaker 5:  Birth is a point and click adventure puzzle game. You gotta

33
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,180
Speaker 5:  make a friend basically out of spare bones and organs you

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,860
Speaker 5:  find around this very strange city because you're lonely.

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,740
Speaker 5:  It's a game about loneliness. Okay. And it's all hand drawn. Madison

36
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,340
Speaker 5:  Draw, she draws everything, draws everything herself. She does everything

37
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,900
Speaker 5:  herself. And it has this very kind of organic dream-like

38
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,620
Speaker 5:  quality to it. And to me it is just so creepy and so

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,860
Speaker 5:  beautiful. Like it's a, it's a Frankenstein's monster thing, but in a good

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,060
Speaker 5:  way.

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,980
Speaker 4:  Well, I personally am very much looking forward to hearing more of your conversation

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,380
Speaker 4:  with Madison.

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,380
Speaker 5:  Hi Madison. Thank you for coming on the show.

44
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,100
Speaker 6:  Hi Ashley. Thank you so much for having me.

45
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,140
Speaker 5:  I've given a very broad description of birth, but Madison,

46
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,020
Speaker 5:  do you mind explaining to the listeners in a little more detail

47
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,220
Speaker 5:  what kind of game birth is?

48
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,860
Speaker 6:  Sure, yes. Birth is a puzzle game about

49
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,500
Speaker 6:  living alone in a large city. It was inspired by my

50
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,620
Speaker 6:  move to Chicago at the very beginning of the pandemic and

51
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,620
Speaker 6:  living alone in a tiny studio apartment. And in order to

52
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,400
Speaker 6:  call your loneliness in birth, you have decided to construct a creature from

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,360
Speaker 6:  spare bones and organs that you find while traversing the new city that

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,040
Speaker 6:  you've moved to.

55
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,480
Speaker 5:  I am very curious about your journey as a solo game developer

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,000
Speaker 5:  because it's a, it's a very interesting path that many people

57
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,120
Speaker 5:  like to think that they could attempt or that they are

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,040
Speaker 5:  interested in attempting. And I wanna hear a little bit about how that got

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,560
Speaker 5:  started for you. So when did you start making games and

60
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,280
Speaker 5:  why did you start making games?

61
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,200
Speaker 6:  I got into games via playing the Rusty Light games and

62
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,200
Speaker 6:  realizing that I think seeing something that's just art that you're clicking

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,160
Speaker 6:  around on that felt very accessible and I just

64
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,960
Speaker 6:  had a very strong desire to try to make something similar. I'm a

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,920
Speaker 6:  programmer by trade and so that part came easy learning.

66
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,880
Speaker 6:  The C sharp, it's the art that I did not have a ton of experience in.

67
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,600
Speaker 6:  And so I had just made it my New Year's resolution one year to draw every

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,520
Speaker 6:  day and try to get better. My first game is very rough

69
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,680
Speaker 6:  in terms of, I definitely was, was learning as I made

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,480
Speaker 6:  stuff. And there's a beauty in not knowing how little,

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,200
Speaker 6:  you know, therefore you're okay with releasing something. So my first game

72
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,960
Speaker 6:  that I ever made definitely just came from blissful ignorance of thinking

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,560
Speaker 6:  that something was, was better than it was, I think, and not being embarrassed

74
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Speaker 6:  to show off what you made. Yeah. So that was in

75
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,480
Speaker 6:  2018 that I started maybe late

76
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,360
Speaker 6:  2017 and I was working a full-time job at a

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
Speaker 6:  financial software, which was very boring. And so it was a,

78
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,600
Speaker 6:  a lot of early mornings and late nights and I think it was just really the

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,920
Speaker 6:  obsession of starting making something and seeing something on the screen

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,720
Speaker 6:  that wasn't there before and you made it. And that was just a

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,320
Speaker 6:  very addictive thing I think. And that like kept me coming back

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,680
Speaker 6:  every day, every morning wanting to work on it. And so that was through

83
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,920
Speaker 6:  2020, early 2021, I got funding from

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,560
Speaker 6:  Wings and then was able to quit my full-time job. And so now I work on

85
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,360
Speaker 6:  my stuff full-time, which is amazing.

86
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah, this is, you're a full-time solo game developer,

87
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,360
Speaker 5:  this is your day job now. You made it your day job, which is the, that's

88
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,960
Speaker 5:  the dream, right? You're living the dream.

89
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,200
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. It feels like a dream for

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,960
Speaker 5:  Sure. So to be clear to everybody, you mentioned

91
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,800
Speaker 5:  the art, your programmer by trade, everything in this game

92
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,760
Speaker 5:  is made by you.

93
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,720
Speaker 6:  Yes. Yes, that is true.

94
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,120
Speaker 5:  So what tools, you mentioned C Sharp, what other tools do you

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,640
Speaker 5:  use? What, what are your preferred tools of your trade?

96
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,840
Speaker 6:  Yes. So I use Unity as a game engine program in C

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,800
Speaker 6:  Sharp and then I use Clip Studio, clip studio Paint for drawing.

98
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,560
Speaker 6:  And that's only because I bought a Waycom tablet and it

99
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,440
Speaker 6:  came with a subscription to Clip Studio and it's just what I learned on and

100
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,080
Speaker 6:  I'm afraid of change. So I haven't switched yet, but I've looked into procreate

101
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,640
Speaker 6:  a little bit cuz it seems really fun. And then just notebooks in terms of

102
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,880
Speaker 6:  like idea, making sure that I have something to write, to write down

103
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Speaker 5:  Sketching things out. How long did it take you to make birth from start

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,200
Speaker 5:  to finish?

105
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,120
Speaker 6:  Birth took 18 months, I think a year and a half.

106
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,240
Speaker 6:  And that was the longest I'd worked on something. And that I think most of

107
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,080
Speaker 6:  that time was a surprise just because I ended up pushing the release date.

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,480
Speaker 6:  It was supposed to come out a few months ago. But doing the events, going

109
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,400
Speaker 6:  to summer Games Fest where we met, and then Gamescom and other

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,840
Speaker 6:  events throughout the year, that takes a lot of, it takes a lot of time to

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,720
Speaker 6:  do the PR part of making a game. So there's the

112
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,480
Speaker 6:  Making the Game, which is fun cuz you get to sit at your desk, you get to

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,360
Speaker 6:  be quiet. And then there's the PR and like showing people the game and hoping

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Speaker 6:  that they like it.

115
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,880
Speaker 5:  Now is that something that required you to step out of your comfort zone?

116
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,760
Speaker 5:  Are you more of an introvert? Do you, were you excited to get out there and

117
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,320
Speaker 5:  really, I mean obviously you wanna show off the thing you made.

118
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I definitely fall towards the more introverted side of

119
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,720
Speaker 6:  the spectrum. I think that's the only way that you can make a game on your

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,200
Speaker 6:  own is if you're comfortable living a lot of your life by yourself. If you're

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,800
Speaker 6:  comfortable sitting your desk in silence, which I think could be said for

122
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,760
Speaker 6:  a lot of creative crafts, there's two parts. There's going out and

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,720
Speaker 6:  talking and being social and that can be draining as an introvert. There's

124
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,920
Speaker 6:  also the fact that birth is so extremely personal and

125
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,200
Speaker 6:  close to me that it feels a little embarrassing to talk

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,680
Speaker 6:  about in that way. And I am so thankful that so many people

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,440
Speaker 6:  resonated with the premise of Birth of Living alone in a tiny

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,240
Speaker 6:  studio, especially after The Pandemic. Not that I want anyone to feel lonely

129
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,480
Speaker 6:  and I would love for everyone to have their person, but yeah, there, I think

130
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,040
Speaker 6:  that part was a little weird to talk about just because it was basically

131
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,960
Speaker 6:  like me being like, hi, I was so lonely that I had to make a game

132
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,720
Speaker 6:  about it, which is like, wow, you really care about it. You

133
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,760
Speaker 6:  really, really care. You really were lonely. So I think that's part of it

134
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,480
Speaker 6:  too, is the vulnerability of saying like, hi, I put my whole heart

135
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,040
Speaker 6:  into this and I hope that's enough. I hope that's enough for you. Also, really

136
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,000
Speaker 6:  just like a very humbling experience to having people play it

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,640
Speaker 6:  and give you compliments about it and and tell you that it

138
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,680
Speaker 6:  resonates with you is just like, I don't know, it just made me feel like

139
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,840
Speaker 6:  my heart was gonna explode the, the whole time

140
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,200
Speaker 5:  I, I would imagine there is something cathartic or

141
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,200
Speaker 5:  validating about hearing the interpretation

142
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,480
Speaker 5:  of yes, the gameplay from people who did not build it

143
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,400
Speaker 5:  and did not have that very close connection because the idea of

144
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,920
Speaker 5:  loneliness is very universal, right? Or the feeling

145
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,880
Speaker 5:  of not having those resources, those friendship

146
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,680
Speaker 5:  circles and everybody collectively. It's very interesting that

147
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,520
Speaker 5:  you were working on this game and then the pandemic hit

148
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,040
Speaker 5:  and it's very much a reflection of everybody got that

149
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,240
Speaker 5:  experience really to some extent. And so it's, it's interesting that there

150
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,120
Speaker 5:  is that shared loneliness. There's an understanding there

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,400
Speaker 5:  that maybe, I don't know, was there before for a lot of people.

152
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,440
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. I do think birth is coming out at a good time in

153
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,720
Speaker 6:  terms of, of course there's never a good time for everyone to be spending

154
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,160
Speaker 6:  so much time in their apartments, but I do think that that did

155
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,280
Speaker 6:  form a more universal or or a greater percentage of humans

156
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,240
Speaker 6:  that had had experience with that where before, I don't know, it was a

157
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,880
Speaker 6:  lot easier to mask loneliness and a lot easier to go out and spend time with

158
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,080
Speaker 6:  people in order to cover that up. So I think you're right that I think the

159
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,520
Speaker 6:  pandemic made it a little bit more relevant.

160
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I, I would argue a lot more relevant. I so much more relevant.

161
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,240
Speaker 5:  So walk me through what it is like on a typical

162
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,280
Speaker 5:  day for you as a solo game Dove. Do you impose crunch on yourself?

163
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,960
Speaker 5:  Like what is, what is your process?

164
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,720
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's kind of weird because crunch seems so negative when

165
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Speaker 6:  someone's working on someone else's game, when someone's making a game for

166
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,680
Speaker 6:  a different studio. But when you're working on your own thing, it feels more

167
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,360
Speaker 6:  like an obsession and there's more of a, I don't know, romanticized vision

168
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,840
Speaker 6:  of it I guess. I don't think French should ever be romanticized, but I, I

169
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,000
Speaker 6:  am just so obsessed with making things that I do spend. I would say majority

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Speaker 6:  of my weekdays are spent sitting at my desk and it does not

171
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,640
Speaker 6:  feel like work. So my typical schedule is I wake up between six

172
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,800
Speaker 6:  to eight depending on how I'm feeling I guess. And

173
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,920
Speaker 5:  How late you were coding the night before.

174
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah, make copies, sit down at my desk. And for the most part,

175
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,560
Speaker 6:  when you're working on your own, I think there's this beauty of being able

176
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,560
Speaker 6:  to come up with an idea and then implement it then in that moment.

177
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,200
Speaker 6:  And so there's like a lot of, each day feels like there's this chance for

178
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Speaker 6:  amazing things to happen because you don't have to have permission from someone

179
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,960
Speaker 6:  else. There's no red tape in terms of like getting someone's opinion or getting

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,200
Speaker 6:  someone's approval to put something in the game. And so a lot of times I'm

181
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,960
Speaker 6:  thinking of things that day and can implement them within like hours. And

182
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,200
Speaker 6:  so it typically depends, but usually I am drawing and programming in the

183
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,920
Speaker 6:  same day. The way that I work is I know that there's advice that

184
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,160
Speaker 6:  you should prototype an ugly version of your game first to know if the

185
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,880
Speaker 6:  gameplay is fun. But I struggle with having ugly things on my screen.

186
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,840
Speaker 6:  And so I typically draw final art from the start. I

187
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,520
Speaker 6:  will draw like a very rough draft and then for the most part it is like final

188
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,080
Speaker 6:  art. So that is just the most joyful way for me to work, I think as if I

189
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,920
Speaker 6:  can make something that looks really good the first time and be able to

190
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,360
Speaker 6:  see, so that way when I set up the physics or the programming for that object,

191
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,560
Speaker 6:  it feels finished in that moment. Any day that I have to do audio, any

192
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,480
Speaker 6:  day that I have to record any amount of music is not tho those are not my

193
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,640
Speaker 6:  best days. But usually I chunk those into like, okay, these will be my audio

194
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,920
Speaker 6:  days and then I will be done with it for the time. So usually programming

195
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,800
Speaker 6:  and art are my, my happy spaces and those are the two that I work on every

196
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,000
Speaker 6:  day.

197
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,240
Speaker 5:  I would imagine having close to final art as you're working is very

198
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,160
Speaker 5:  motivating to be able to Yes. To keep going. It's sort of like the, it's

199
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,400
Speaker 5:  the carrot that keeps you kind of going f moving forward.

200
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,600
Speaker 6:  Yes, absolutely. I, I agree with you.

201
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,880
Speaker 5:  Okay, we're gonna take a break, but when we come back we'll talk about the

202
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,680
Speaker 5:  logistics of making your way as a solo game developer.

203
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,240
Speaker 1:  This episode is sponsored by Toyota Crown Crown's available hybrid,

204
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,120
Speaker 1:  max powertrain and standard all-wheel drive makes this sedan a leader in

205
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,480
Speaker 1:  the field from the premium driver focused interior that says you're always

206
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,240
Speaker 1:  comfortable in the spotlight to the stylish exterior that says Trendsetter

207
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,080
Speaker 1:  Toyota says, wherever you go in the all new Toyota crown, you make a statement,

208
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,960
Speaker 1:  the car that says so much, visit toyota.com/crown

209
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,800
Speaker 1:  to learn more. Toyota, let's go places.

210
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,700
Speaker 5:  Okay, we're back. And I have Alex crayons with me.

211
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,740
Speaker 4:  I have to butt in because I have one question, how the money happened.

212
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,020
Speaker 5:  The eternal question. The eternal question. Well, Madison

213
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,140
Speaker 5:  has a publisher as an indie game developer. She is given

214
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,820
Speaker 5:  an advance, much like a book deal, she's given an advance

215
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,780
Speaker 5:  to make a game that she either has a working prototype of or

216
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,660
Speaker 5:  if she has a working relationship with a publisher or any other solo game

217
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,860
Speaker 5:  developer has a working relationship, a lot of times there's an understanding

218
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,620
Speaker 5:  that she's making her next project. This is kind of the top

219
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,260
Speaker 5:  line idea, go forth, make game. And then once that

220
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,020
Speaker 5:  advance is set in stone, it's doled out in

221
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,620
Speaker 5:  pieces as the project meets milestones. So you can't just

222
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,540
Speaker 5:  wallow in concept art land for 10 years and you gotta ship something.

223
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,340
Speaker 5:  Well you gotta just show some progress, right? Yeah. It's like you gotta,

224
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,860
Speaker 5:  you gotta show 'em something. And then when the game comes out, publisher

225
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,220
Speaker 5:  usually usually sets the pricing and then the

226
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,060
Speaker 5:  publisher usually wants to recoup that advance, they

227
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,700
Speaker 5:  wanna get back some of that money or all of it. And that

228
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,500
Speaker 5:  amount of percentage when the game launches depends on the agreement between

229
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,420
Speaker 5:  the game developer and the publisher. So it could be a hundred percent of

230
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,220
Speaker 5:  an advance has to be recouped before the developer makes anything. Or it

231
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,140
Speaker 5:  could be a percentage, a split in there and then the developer

232
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,580
Speaker 5:  keeps the ip, it doesn't ever belong to the publisher. Okay. So that's nice.

233
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,740
Speaker 5:  And then there's a publishing agreement. So there's a set period of time

234
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,380
Speaker 5:  where the publisher is collecting on profits.

235
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,420
Speaker 4:  Okay. So given kind of the economics of it in,

236
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,140
Speaker 4:  in a lot of those challenges, why, why does Madison go down this route rather

237
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,980
Speaker 4:  than going towards a more stable kind of consistently

238
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,180
Speaker 4:  lucrative thing? Like as a AAA game developer?

239
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,260
Speaker 5:  That is a great question and one she answered. So let's take a listen.

240
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,610
Speaker 6:  So I think there obviously is a lot of safety in having a

241
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,090
Speaker 6:  corporate job and making the decision to quit. My job in

242
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,770
Speaker 6:  2021 was very scary and it was not like something that

243
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,730
Speaker 6:  that was easy at all. And, and I feel like for the first few months I was

244
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,530
Speaker 6:  just terrified all the time of like, have I made a terrible

245
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,650
Speaker 6:  financial decision? Because then you're also in charge of taxes. There's

246
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,530
Speaker 6:  a lot more than just like, how big can the number be? You know, what is the

247
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,410
Speaker 6:  number I need per month? I had no idea how hard it was gonna be to do your

248
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,090
Speaker 6:  taxes when you are not having a w2.

249
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,250
Speaker 5:  Yes, it is hard,

250
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,690
Speaker 6:  It's terrible, it's terrible. And then health insurance, you have to figure

251
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,600
Speaker 6:  that out. There's a lot more than just choosing salary, you know, based

252
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,200
Speaker 6:  on, on that number. And also just from a mental health perspective of

253
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,040
Speaker 6:  having that safety net. But I think in terms of, and not to be so

254
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
Speaker 6:  extremely philosophical, but the way that I will measure my life

255
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,080
Speaker 6:  at the end of it is how well did I love my partner

256
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,520
Speaker 6:  and how many works have I

257
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,120
Speaker 6:  created that I'm proud of? And working at a studio, making someone

258
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,800
Speaker 6:  else's games, obviously that's a much easier and safer feeling

259
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,600
Speaker 6:  life to have, but there is a direct limitation on

260
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,960
Speaker 6:  how many of your own things you get to make. So it's definitely scarier

261
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,040
Speaker 6:  to be on your own, but I think it's worth it if you have that obsession with

262
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,240
Speaker 6:  your own creative work and getting better. But I definitely see how people

263
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,720
Speaker 6:  could want to just stay at a, at a job cuz it's safe and that's good. And

264
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,360
Speaker 6:  I, my best friend, she will work corporate forever and she, she lives a very

265
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,280
Speaker 6:  nice, a nice, safe, easy life and I'm happy for her, but that

266
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Speaker 6:  is just not what I, what I want. It's hard to, hard to live a creative life,

267
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,600
Speaker 6:  I think.

268
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,120
Speaker 5:  So birth is a game about loneliness and a pandemic

269
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
Speaker 5:  happened in the middle of it. And one of the biggest parts

270
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,000
Speaker 5:  of the indie game dev community is those connections

271
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,880
Speaker 5:  between other indie game devs and obviously,

272
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,360
Speaker 5:  you know, conventions and other networking opportunities were not available

273
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,000
Speaker 5:  for a big chunk of births development. How did

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,800
Speaker 5:  you personally pivot during the pandemic and did you find

275
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,760
Speaker 5:  that your choices were different or the same as the rest of the game Dove

276
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,480
Speaker 5:  community? Were there still, you know, masked up outdoor game

277
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,320
Speaker 5:  jams going on? Like what did you find happened in the community

278
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,520
Speaker 5:  at large and then what was your individual response to the pandemic?

279
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I think mine might be a little bit different because I feel like

280
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,600
Speaker 6:  my first two games were so small and I did not go to any shows.

281
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,240
Speaker 6:  So birth is the first game that I'm showing and taking out

282
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,920
Speaker 6:  into the world. And so to me it felt like as the

283
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,040
Speaker 6:  pandemic was, as restrictions were being lifted, it was like right when

284
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,360
Speaker 6:  I was like ready to show birth. And so Summer Games Fest, that was like a

285
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,240
Speaker 6:  lot of the, a lot of people's first events back after the Pandemic and

286
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,240
Speaker 6:  that was my first time ever showing a game ever. And it just so

287
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,520
Speaker 6:  happened to be birth and luckily it was like really good timing. And so for

288
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,320
Speaker 6:  me it almost felt like the pandemic kind of, maybe I would've shown my

289
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,120
Speaker 6:  second game somewhere, but I'm kind of glad that I didn't because I'm like

290
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,800
Speaker 6:  very happy that Birth was my first one that is kind of getting any amount

291
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,720
Speaker 6:  of recognition just because of, I think as creators we are most proud of

292
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,360
Speaker 6:  our latest work. And you can look at something you made a year ago

293
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,280
Speaker 6:  and think, oh no, that's terrible. I would've done so many things differently

294
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,080
Speaker 6:  if I was making it now. So for me there wasn't a huge difference. I

295
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,040
Speaker 6:  did love coming into showcases that is a,

296
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,680
Speaker 6:  a brand new thing for me. So that was like very, very fun and I'm glad that

297
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,080
Speaker 6:  it lined up with everyone's excitement to kind of get back into things.

298
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,480
Speaker 6:  So I do think we are moving more towards having more online

299
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,320
Speaker 6:  stuff. I hope that's something that happens throughout, you know, even, even

300
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,200
Speaker 6:  as restrictions get lifted. I do hope that that stays, because I think that's

301
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,040
Speaker 6:  a very accessible way for humans to be involved in things when they can't

302
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,880
Speaker 6:  afford to go to shows because they're expensive and or

303
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,680
Speaker 5:  Physically can't.

304
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,760
Speaker 6:  Yes, right.

305
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,600
Speaker 5:  The indie game space, it has never been harder to

306
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,440
Speaker 5:  discover certain indie games like Discoverability

307
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,000
Speaker 5:  because of the, the proliferation, just the absolute

308
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,960
Speaker 5:  mountain of games that are available

309
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,440
Speaker 5:  on many different platforms and storefronts.

310
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,520
Speaker 5:  It makes it hard for any indie game developer, whether you're

311
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,720
Speaker 5:  a solo game developer or studio to be discovered.

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,320
Speaker 5:  Hopefully products like the Steam Deck seem to be helping.

313
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,880
Speaker 5:  I am really curious about how you have seen

314
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,960
Speaker 5:  discoverability within the space change since you started Game Dev.

315
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I think that when I started, I also didn't realize how

316
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,640
Speaker 6:  small the industry felt. And so it feels really big

317
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,200
Speaker 6:  from the outside, but there's, it seems like there's so many tie-ins

318
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,040
Speaker 6:  between most of the, the bigger games for sure. I think your

319
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,520
Speaker 6:  point about the Steam deck helping discoverability is really important

320
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,440
Speaker 6:  because porting is hard and so you don't get

321
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
Speaker 6:  to see a lot of those niche indie games on consoles that maybe do have

322
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,160
Speaker 6:  a little bit more curation. And so I'm glad that people are able to

323
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,120
Speaker 6:  play weird, unfinished things on Steam on their couch now that

324
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,080
Speaker 6:  is like, I think the barrier to, at least for me to playing a lot

325
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,440
Speaker 6:  more steam games is that I don't wanna sit at my desk after I've been sitting

326
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,400
Speaker 6:  at my desk for so long. And so having a steam deck has helped me play

327
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,360
Speaker 6:  a lot more just like smaller, smaller games. I do think you're

328
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,920
Speaker 6:  right though that, especially with Steam, and I know this has been discussed

329
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,280
Speaker 6:  a lot, but there's so many games that come out on Steam

330
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,440
Speaker 6:  and I know that I have missed so many games that I would

331
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,000
Speaker 6:  love to play. I know I'm missing out and I know it's, I think about when

332
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,840
Speaker 6:  I started, I didn't know how to tell people about my thing and I would

333
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,760
Speaker 6:  just put it on steam and not, I didn't have a Twitter, I wouldn't tweet about

334
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,400
Speaker 6:  it. I would just put it on steam and hope that people found it. And that's

335
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,840
Speaker 6:  just, it just doesn't work like that. And I didn't know at the time, of course

336
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,600
Speaker 6:  I was ignorant. And so I do think there's a lot more, I'm seeing a lot more

337
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,480
Speaker 6:  smaller showcases pop up, which is nice. I think Day of the Devs is a great

338
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,320
Speaker 6:  one. And that's not a small showcase by any means of course, but I'm seeing

339
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,240
Speaker 6:  a lot more indie is the, I guess the word you would use for it. It's

340
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,920
Speaker 6:  almost like indie showcases independently run showcases.

341
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So I think just hopefully they're, you're finding things from your

342
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,400
Speaker 6:  community, but you definitely can't just, there's just so much chance involved

343
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,360
Speaker 6:  with putting something on steam and hoping that someone finds it. So

344
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Speaker 6:  I think it's really just about like following curators that you like that

345
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,640
Speaker 6:  hopefully will hype up other indies. But it really takes people

346
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,280
Speaker 6:  caring about indies in the indie space to like make sure that that as many

347
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,360
Speaker 6:  of them get the attention that they deserve, but there's no way that they

348
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,520
Speaker 6:  can, you know, there's so many people creating things and as indie, indie

349
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,040
Speaker 6:  development gets more accessible, which is amazing and we're getting way

350
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,080
Speaker 6:  more diverse stories than we've we've ever had, there's not enough people

351
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,640
Speaker 6:  that can afford to talk about them and write about them.

352
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,000
Speaker 5:  All right, let's take one more break then I'll be back with Alex Kranz and

353
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,200
Speaker 5:  more of my interview with Madison.

354
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,050
Speaker 1:  This podcast is sponsored by Toyota Crown. The all new Toyota

355
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,810
Speaker 1:  crown is breaking new ground when it comes to the premium sedan with an

356
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,530
Speaker 1:  available hybrid max powertrain. The Toyota Crown is the perfect combination

357
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,410
Speaker 1:  of power, style, and elegance, making it the car to glide in

358
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,530
Speaker 1:  from a driver focused interior that says you're always comfortable in the

359
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,450
Speaker 1:  spotlight to the stylish exterior that says I have arrived.

360
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,250
Speaker 1:  Toyota says, wherever you go in the all new Toyota crown, you make a

361
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,570
Speaker 1:  statement, the car that says so much. Visit

362
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,770
Speaker 1:  toyota.com/crown to learn more. Toyota,

363
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,090
Speaker 1:  let's go places.

364
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,770
Speaker 5:  Okay, we're back. Alex is here too. Hi Alex.

365
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,850
Speaker 4:  Okay, Ashley, so typically on, on this last act

366
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,890
Speaker 4:  of the Solo Acts podcast, we get a little nerdy, we get pretty

367
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,370
Speaker 4:  in depth. Where are you taking us in this last act?

368
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,490
Speaker 5:  The only place we can go, which is the future, I love it. The future

369
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,410
Speaker 5:  specifically of the solo game dev space. I think 15

370
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,290
Speaker 5:  years ago you could make a moderately successful breakout hit as a

371
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,650
Speaker 5:  solo or a really small game dev, right? And

372
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,490
Speaker 5:  now, you know, if you do that, the opportunity to

373
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,210
Speaker 5:  parlay it into a mid to senior level role at a

374
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,050
Speaker 5:  mid-size studio is not as prevalent as it used to be because

375
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,210
Speaker 5:  all of these mid-size studios have been snapped up by first party

376
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,330
Speaker 5:  developers. We've seen Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, I mean, they're all

377
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,010
Speaker 5:  just, they're just buying up studios, they're hoovering them like

378
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,610
Speaker 5:  Kirby. And I wanted to know

379
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,570
Speaker 5:  what Madison's thoughts were on the current and future landscape

380
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,450
Speaker 5:  of small and indie game development, because it's a weird place to be

381
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,410
Speaker 5:  right now. And I was dying to get that first person perspective

382
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:55,890
Speaker 5:  from her.

383
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,020
Speaker 6:  So I've seen the, I'm not sure exactly who had posted

384
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,140
Speaker 6:  this, maybe Romi Ismail about the amount of money that it

385
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,940
Speaker 6:  takes to acquire a mid-size studio or a larger studio and how

386
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,780
Speaker 6:  that could fund so many indies. You know, so many indies just need 60

387
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,660
Speaker 6:  or $70,000 to make their game. And you know, there's,

388
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,220
Speaker 6:  there's billions going around and I think that speaks to how much money there

389
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,780
Speaker 6:  is just in gaming in general, in terms of where

390
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,700
Speaker 6:  it's going. What I would love to see is more people and

391
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,140
Speaker 6:  you know, hopefully this is just the world in general, that more tasks, more

392
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,580
Speaker 6:  general tasks are automated, therefore more humans have more time

393
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,860
Speaker 6:  for enjoyment. You know, hopefully the, the general populations

394
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,700
Speaker 6:  amount of free time goes up and with that comes more time to enjoy games

395
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,520
Speaker 6:  and also more time to make games. And so hopefully as our world becomes more

396
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,040
Speaker 6:  automated, we have more time and more games that are getting made.

397
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,120
Speaker 6:  But I don't have a good prediction on what's gonna happen to indies.

398
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,080
Speaker 6:  I hope that, I hope that self-publishing is stays as accessible

399
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,480
Speaker 6:  as it is and that there's enough people that care about indie games.

400
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,280
Speaker 6:  I've been shocked at how many people just care about

401
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,120
Speaker 6:  indies since becoming one. IT people really care and people

402
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,000
Speaker 6:  want indies to exist. I want indies to exist and so hopefully

403
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,840
Speaker 6:  there's enough people. You know what I, I like to think about indies doing

404
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,680
Speaker 6:  well. So solo developers doing well and feeding back into another solo developer

405
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,400
Speaker 6:  doing well. So hopefully there's like enough indie devs wanting other indies

406
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,200
Speaker 6:  to survive that we all find funding somehow, but that is

407
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,160
Speaker 6:  hard to, hard to imagine happening. But that's what I hope, that's my hopeful

408
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,720
Speaker 6:  prediction.

409
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,760
Speaker 5:  I wanna hook back to something you mentioned, which is automation. And

410
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,640
Speaker 5:  we've seen so much in the news about chat, G B T and OpenAI

411
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,440
Speaker 5:  and all of these other artificial intelligence apps and

412
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,560
Speaker 5:  you know, platforms. How do you think

413
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,440
Speaker 5:  automation might help you as a solo game developer

414
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,120
Speaker 5:  specifically?

415
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,560
Speaker 6:  Hmm. If it could automate any amount of the

416
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,640
Speaker 6:  admin task that I have to do, the biz dev stuff brings me no

417
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,800
Speaker 6:  joy. Other than that, I do think I value the human

418
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,760
Speaker 6:  aspect of work and I know that is a big argument

419
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,720
Speaker 6:  for or against AI art and I value that in

420
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,560
Speaker 6:  my work just because I love, for the most part, everything I get to do,

421
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,280
Speaker 6:  everything that goes into making a game. I love that part. Maybe localization,

422
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,120
Speaker 6:  maybe if it could, if it could localize into every single language for me,

423
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,760
Speaker 6:  that would be amazing.

424
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,880
Speaker 5:  That's a good one. Yeah. I hadn't thought of localization, but that

425
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,600
Speaker 5:  does seem seem at least a good starting point, right? Yeah. And then you,

426
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,000
Speaker 5:  you can spend maybe a little less having a translator

427
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,800
Speaker 5:  refine a translation as opposed to Right. Doing it from

428
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,480
Speaker 5:  scratch, right?

429
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,240
Speaker 6:  Absolutely.

430
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,440
Speaker 5:  You mentioned your sort of, again, not to be macab,

431
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,920
Speaker 5:  but we are talking about birth here. You did mention you're like, at the

432
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,640
Speaker 5:  end of my life, these are the things that I, I will feel good about. Yes.

433
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,680
Speaker 5:  How do you measure success when you launch an indie game? Because obviously

434
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,200
Speaker 5:  it is a very different metric. So when you launch birth

435
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
Speaker 5:  birthed out, how do you measure the success of this game?

436
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think if we were in it for money, we would be in

437
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,160
Speaker 6:  a, there are way more efficient ways to make money for sure.

438
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,440
Speaker 5:  You'd be programming for a hedge fund or something?

439
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,160
Speaker 6:  Yes, absolutely right. I would be having a much more boring life for sure.

440
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,080
Speaker 6:  Obviously numbers matter, because numbers indicate whether you

441
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,720
Speaker 6:  can make the next game or not, or what you need to be asking for from funding

442
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,400
Speaker 6:  or publisher next time. So numbers do matter a little bit. Those numbers

443
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,080
Speaker 6:  are important. The same way wishlist numbers are important before you launch,

444
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,960
Speaker 6:  even if there's no guarantee. But for me, I think what

445
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,840
Speaker 6:  has brought me joy and what makes me feel like I did

446
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,520
Speaker 6:  the job that I set out to do is, is watching people play it

447
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,480
Speaker 6:  specifically. I love watching streams of it and seeing

448
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,200
Speaker 6:  small interactions because it's taken so many thousands of

449
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,120
Speaker 6:  hours to make birth. And so if someone has a really good time

450
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,960
Speaker 6:  for two hours of their life, I have to make up those thousands of hours that

451
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,760
Speaker 6:  I've spent. So I need so many people to play it and know that you're

452
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,360
Speaker 6:  improving someone's life, at least a tiny, tiny bit for it to be worth it.

453
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,040
Speaker 6:  And so positive reviews help, but I really think it's seeing someone

454
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,000
Speaker 6:  play, play through it and enjoy it and other people can

455
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,760
Speaker 6:  like vocalize what it makes them feel. And you in

456
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,080
Speaker 6:  return are learning more about yourself or what you've created through that.

457
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I think it's how much joy it brings other people. That sounds really

458
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,720
Speaker 6:  cliche and naive almost, but as long as the numbers

459
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,880
Speaker 6:  are good and as long as it's not a flop,

460
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,520
Speaker 6:  yeah, it is important how much joy it brings people.

461
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,920
Speaker 5:  My last question is, what is your best advice

462
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,920
Speaker 5:  for anybody who feels like they have a great game in them? Like

463
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,520
Speaker 5:  what is, what is your best advice there?

464
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,640
Speaker 6:  Make it, start making stuff. It will be so bad at

465
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,880
Speaker 6:  first. Everything that I made at the beginning was so bad and still things

466
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,800
Speaker 6:  that I make sometimes I'm like, oh my God, that's atrocious that I made that

467
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,640
Speaker 6:  and I feel like I'm, I'm getting better every day at things. And so you just

468
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,400
Speaker 6:  have to start. The scariest part is having total creative freedom and having

469
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,160
Speaker 6:  no restraints whatsoever and having a blank canvas that is really scary.

470
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,920
Speaker 6:  What is not so scary is having a little bit of something on a canvas that

471
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,720
Speaker 6:  you're editing a little bit. So yeah, start now. You'll wish that, I wish

472
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,880
Speaker 6:  that I started way earlier. I wish I had found Game dev when I was like four

473
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,960
Speaker 6:  or something. I don't know.

474
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,440
Speaker 5:  My son's about to turn four, so I'm gonna get him started.

475
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,320
Speaker 6:  Oh my gosh, you should,

476
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,480
Speaker 5:  This year started immediately

477
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,680
Speaker 6:  A new indie game Dev

478
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,960
Speaker 5:  A new one right now. Yes.

479
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,800
Speaker 4:  Okay. That is it for the Verge Cast. Thank you so much, Ashley.

480
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,320
Speaker 5:  Ugh, it's my pleasure.

481
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,400
Speaker 4:  I've been having so much fun on this series with you and we've got even more

482
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,280
Speaker 4:  episodes of the Solo Act series coming. This was episode three, we have two

483
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,800
Speaker 4:  more, so you gotta tune in next Monday to hear even more about it.

484
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,560
Speaker 4:  Ashley, what's going on next week though?

485
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,040
Speaker 5:  I have heard that mechanical keyboards are very

486
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,320
Speaker 5:  popular.

487
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,840
Speaker 4:  Oh my God, are they? I am

488
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,640
Speaker 5:  Shocked. I received a telegram and I've heard

489
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,160
Speaker 5:  that the technology community loves mechanical keyboards, so I decided

490
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:06,120
Speaker 5:  to talk to Tiny Makes Things Tiny is

491
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,480
Speaker 5:  a mechanical keyboard custom key cap

492
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,000
Speaker 5:  creator. Yes. Yeah, she makes custom key caps,

493
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,400
Speaker 4:  Like the cute little ones that always like look like food or like little

494
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,040
Speaker 4:  characters and

495
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,000
Speaker 5:  Stuff. Yes. And she also even makes accessories for them, so talk to her.

496
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,960
Speaker 5:  And she is a very interesting person with a

497
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,560
Speaker 5:  lot of really cool things to talk about in the, in the mechanical keyboard

498
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,120
Speaker 5:  space. I think if you are a longtime enthusiast of mechanical

499
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,640
Speaker 5:  keyboards, you will enjoy it. But also if you're new to mechanical keyboards

500
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,000
Speaker 5:  or just thinking about it, you may find her her talk. Interesting. All

501

Speaker 1:  To Toyota Crown for supporting this episode. The all new Toyota Crown lets

512
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,560
Speaker 1:  you separate from the crowd as soon as you step inside the car. It's equipped

513
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,120
Speaker 1:  with a cutting edge design with an available hybrid max powertrain that generates

514
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,560
Speaker 1:  an exceptional 340 combined net horsepower. The dynamic

515
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,160
Speaker 1:  placement of the electric motor between the engine and the transmission allows

516
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,960
Speaker 1:  for power to be transferred without any lack. The result, zero
