00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,150
Speaker 1:  Who very good. Well, explain that reference in a bit. Alex cranes is here

45
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,170
Speaker 1:  again. Yeah.

46
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,980
Speaker 3:  I am also here and I'm more a fan of a Lunchable. So I don't

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,860
Speaker 3:  know.

48
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,140
Speaker 1:  Amazing that America took a hard look at the bento box and it's like

49
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,000
Speaker 1:  Lunchables.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,630
Speaker 3:  We got it. Crackers and cheese go. Crystal else is

51
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,000
Speaker 3:  here. Good to be back as always.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,900
Speaker 1:  There's a lot going on in this episode. There's WWDC. I feel like

53
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,680
Speaker 1:  Chris and I could just do an, a full hour on spacial audio. Cause that got

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,370
Speaker 1:  rolled out this week. We could do a full hour of Dieter, just sighing

55
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,050
Speaker 1:  about the multitasking situation and the iPad. So

56
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,890
Speaker 1:  mad it's this one's going to be a ride,

57
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,610
Speaker 1:  but I want to start where we always start. COVID it's not over. It feels

58
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,420
Speaker 1:  over. I will tell you this, where I live here in upstate New York,

59
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,510
Speaker 1:  no one gives a shit anymore. Like that's just where we're at. There's no

60
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,230
Speaker 1:  mass like everyone's inside. It's great. I had dinner inside the other day.

61
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,560
Speaker 1:  It was amazing, but it's still happening. It's still raging around the world.

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,280
Speaker 1:  The United States is it's not the only place in the world as much as

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Speaker 1:  Americans like to feel that way. And even inside the United States, things

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,030
Speaker 1:  are all over the place. So we have a bunch of stories this week. COVID-19

65
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,450
Speaker 1:  hospitalization rates actually went up for adolescents in March and April,

66
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,440
Speaker 1:  which is not a great sign. So please keep those vaccinations up. By

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,800
Speaker 1:  the way, I want to call this out because it just makes me laugh so

68
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,070
Speaker 1:  hard. The byte administration set a vaccination target

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,970
Speaker 1:  goal for July 4th, we met, we might not hit it. It's like a

70
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,480
Speaker 1:  real thing. Bud light announced this week that they would buy everyone in

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,870
Speaker 1:  America beer. If we hit the,

72
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,480
Speaker 4:  Which is like the most American,

73
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,610
Speaker 5:  Just that last push we really needed to get.

74
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,570
Speaker 1:  It's like world. It's like, I've

75
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,180
Speaker 1:  been on the fence, but can't turn on free beer

76
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,450
Speaker 3:  Free bud light. Like not even a good beer.

77
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,990
Speaker 1:  I applaud them. It just made me laugh so hard. Anyhow, it's

78
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,620
Speaker 1:  still happening, please. If you're not vaccinated, we have a lot of

79
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,530
Speaker 1:  information on the site. There's a lot of other sites, please get it done.

80
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,340
Speaker 1:  I want this to be over badly. Speaking of reasons, people are

81
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,000
Speaker 1:  hesitant to get vaccinated. We have a deep dive into where the COVID

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,900
Speaker 1:  vaccine and microchip conspiracy came from and it

83
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,800
Speaker 1:  is just a ride. It started with a Reddit post spun

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,220
Speaker 1:  out of control. It got picked up and mutated. It is one of

85
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,210
Speaker 1:  those very verge stories about just a little piece

86
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,690
Speaker 1:  of information spiraling into a big thing. It

87
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,600
Speaker 1:  is it's really, it's really great. You should just read it. It's on the site

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,290
Speaker 1:  now. And lastly, if you're ever a chest listener, you know, we cover the

89
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,130
Speaker 1:  digital divide a lot, which is everything from the broadband gap to the devices.

90
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,400
Speaker 1:  People use to who gets the message to the

91
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,090
Speaker 1:  pandemic, lots and lots of second order effects as we've discussed. One of

92
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,990
Speaker 1:  them is e-waste might be going down. The other one is the digital

93
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,980
Speaker 1:  divide, my beginning wider. So one of those things to re it's just,

94
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,920
Speaker 1:  I think there's a lot of policy initiatives happening in the world that we

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,400
Speaker 1:  always talk about, but broad brand and infrastructure spending the digital

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,300
Speaker 1:  divide is one that cuts across both parties. It is staggeringly

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,780
Speaker 1:  bi-partisan people thinking about how to get broadband places, how to get

98
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,650
Speaker 1:  students everywhere, better devices, go check it out because I think

99
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,110
Speaker 1:  there's gonna be a lot of action about this stuff in the, in the years to

100
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,100
Speaker 1:  come. Okay. But speaking of the far end of the digital divide, apple

101
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,060
Speaker 1:  Inc, they're the fancy ones. That's

102
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,930
Speaker 1:  how I think of that. I mean, WTC, we talked about it a lot last

103
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,990
Speaker 1:  week, Alex, in her first episode with us, we just like went for an hour and

104
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,980
Speaker 1:  40. It was great deep dives and that old notification

105
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,400
Speaker 1:  systems we did, but then it happened. I'm just going to say it

106
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,150
Speaker 1:  directly. Wow. Was that

107
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,020
Speaker 1:  underwhelming? I mean, like, I

108
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,710
Speaker 1:  think this is a lot of people had this response to it. First of

109
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,700
Speaker 1:  all, we were all hoping for a new MacBook pro it didn't arrive. Shawn

110
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,630
Speaker 1:  Hollister did a great post. I think he just needed to get it out

111
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,200
Speaker 1:  of, get it out of his brain. Look emotionally processed the lack of a MacBook

112
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,100
Speaker 1:  pro, but apple tagged its YouTube stream with

113
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,910
Speaker 1:  M one X mix. Like people like

114
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,870
Speaker 1:  over-thought it to the point where like, oh, they, they they've

115
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,650
Speaker 1:  kind of acknowledged it. And I, I don't know about that. I like, I

116
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,640
Speaker 1:  understand why Sean did the story. Like sometimes you just

117
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,480
Speaker 1:  have to be like, I had all these feelings and I need to write them down so

118
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,570
Speaker 1:  that, but that's, it happened. There was no hardware of any kind really.

119
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,570
Speaker 1:  And then, you know, we went through what they could do to the various platforms.

120
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,350
Speaker 1:  We'll talk about what they announce. Everything is very iterative, except

121
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,710
Speaker 1:  for some of the privacy stuff they've added, which is kind of a big step

122
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,340
Speaker 1:  forward, but also very complicated and how it works. So I just like, I don't

123
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,410
Speaker 1:  know, Dieter what'd you think?

124
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,890
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think iterative is fair. The thing that struck me is it was really,

125
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,880
Speaker 2:  really hard to suss out when they were announcing features, where

126
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,660
Speaker 2:  they would go and what platform they were for the, like, it was like every

127
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,440
Speaker 2:  single feature is kind of for everything. The privacy stuff kind of

128
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,130
Speaker 2:  works everywhere. The health stuff has kind of between the

129
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,030
Speaker 2:  iPhone and the watch. The, just all, all of the features are

130
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,960
Speaker 2:  kind of fuzzy between platforms, which to me is a real metaphor

131
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,690
Speaker 2:  for how all of the apps now are fuzzy between

132
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,530
Speaker 2:  platforms. There are Mac apps and iPad apps and iPhone

133
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,160
Speaker 2:  apps, and they're all different, but they're increasingly the same, but

134
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,520
Speaker 2:  not. And that's how I felt like most of these announcements with,

135
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,580
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's kind of a function of all the apps are really just front ends

136
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,540
Speaker 1:  for services now. Yeah. A lot of services, but it's like in the background

137
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,570
Speaker 1:  of everything. So like if you announce an update to the iPhone health app

138
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,260
Speaker 1:  where you are really announcing as an update to health, a service provided

139
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,860
Speaker 1:  from apple that is exposed across all of your devices. Right. And the other

140
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,430
Speaker 1:  thing I'll say is I think apple just, they've gotten very good at making

141
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,240
Speaker 1:  these hour and a half long infomercials that take the

142
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,570
Speaker 1:  place of their events, but here they didn't, they didn't follow like the

143
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,840
Speaker 1:  rules of great public speaking. They didn't tell you what they were going

144
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,750
Speaker 1:  to tell you and then tell you, and then tell you again, it was just like,

145
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,230
Speaker 1:  you were just off to the races. You had no idea what would happen next, which

146
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,590
Speaker 1:  I think for a developer event, I think that feedback, we talked about the

147
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,190
Speaker 1:  context of this event and the unhappiness and the developer community a

148
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,460
Speaker 1:  lot. They didn't feel the pressure to like address the elephant in the

149
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,300
Speaker 1:  room. They waited quite a long time before they got to any developer

150
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,140
Speaker 1:  stuff. And I, I just think it was an odd event.

151
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,100
Speaker 1:  Hopefully it's the last infomercial event that we have.

152
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,550
Speaker 1:  Like I would really like to start going back to live events and like seeing

153
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,300
Speaker 1:  people. And there's something really important that you get from these

154
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,930
Speaker 1:  events in person. But I think here it was just a flood of

155
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,470
Speaker 1:  stuff and Dieter you're very good at, at calling out. Apple's great at writing

156
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,450
Speaker 1:  narratives about itself. And I didn't catch narrative. There was very little

157
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,750
Speaker 2:  Narrative at all. Like the story coming out of this thing

158
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,080
Speaker 2:  is they announced a bunch of stuff.

159
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,350
Speaker 4:  And like there

160
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,370
Speaker 2:  Were, there were so many missed opportunities. Like they could have just

161
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,880
Speaker 2:  done an entire narrative that they've done it before, around

162
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,700
Speaker 2:  like privacy and AI. Right. There's a bunch of new Siri

163
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,900
Speaker 2:  updates that are actually really interesting. It's a little bit of catch

164
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,890
Speaker 2:  up to Google assistant, honestly, because, so it can do like reading texts,

165
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,760
Speaker 2:  which has sort of like Google lens. It can do on-device Siri stuff, which

166
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,940
Speaker 2:  is actually a huge deal because that's been forever that you haven't been

167
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,810
Speaker 2:  able to just use Siri when you are offline and it's way faster. And they

168
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,620
Speaker 2:  could have just connected that to privacy. And they can just like

169
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,490
Speaker 2:  run through, run that thread through almost half or more of the

170
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,450
Speaker 2:  things they announced. And people would have been able to like understand

171
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,320
Speaker 2:  where things were going. But instead it was just a bunch of

172
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,160
Speaker 2:  sort of disparate things. I don't know. I'm excited by

173
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,060
Speaker 2:  about a bunch of the stuff that got announced and I'm really excited to

174
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,050
Speaker 2:  try a bunch of the stuff that got announced, but I don't see a

175
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,580
Speaker 2:  vision for what Apple's stuff is for the next year here. I

176
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,480
Speaker 3:  Kind of do actually I think, I think it was everything they

177
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,110
Speaker 3:  weren't saying. I think it, I think like just the very structure of this

178
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,920
Speaker 3:  WWDC, like it was so weird and

179
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,730
Speaker 3:  all over the place. And I think this is part of them trying to like part

180
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,480
Speaker 3:  of apple, trying to do this, this, you know, it's moving from this company

181
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,260
Speaker 3:  that sells software, this company that sells services. And we were, this

182
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,860
Speaker 3:  was the transition dub dub for that, like where we were really seeing that,

183
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,460
Speaker 3:  like we shouldn't have had an iOS and a Macko S and an

184
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,760
Speaker 3:  iPad iOS. It should have been Siri home,

185
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,510
Speaker 3:  TV, health. Yeah. I think it's just the growing

186
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,020
Speaker 3:  pains of this transition we're seeing from apple.

187
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,560
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

188
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,500
Speaker 1:  Let's talk about, let's talk about iOS. They did announce a bunch of new

189
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,430
Speaker 1:  features. Some of like Steve was saying, some of them are just features

190
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,830
Speaker 1:  for everything, but you know, they're like very

191
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,760
Speaker 1:  specific they're extending digital identity

192
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,420
Speaker 1:  cards, ease to be able to put credit cards in your wallet, put your driver's

193
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,110
Speaker 1:  license and apple

194
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,870
Speaker 3:  Wallet. I don't want to do that. I

195
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,620
Speaker 1:  Am not going to do that. But like, they're extending the

196
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,430
Speaker 1:  capabilities in the places you might use your phone, the

197
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,270
Speaker 1:  on-device series stuff. Right. That was a really good Siri demo of just

198
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,200
Speaker 1:  like it working really fast in a way that Siri doesn't work really fast.

199
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,720
Speaker 1:  Right.

200
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,140
Speaker 4:  I don't know.

201
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,140
Speaker 1:  What's what's that to you, Alex? I liked

202
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,040
Speaker 3:  All of the stuff I got to say. I downloaded the, the I've got my

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,030
Speaker 3:  developer account that, that I pay for, even though I have not even

204
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,660
Speaker 3:  attempted to develop an app in like 10 years and I

205
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,530
Speaker 3:  downloaded it. I've been playing with it. And, and so far it's

206
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,280
Speaker 3:  all the tiny things. There's no, like I didn't download it and just go, wow.

207
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,060
Speaker 3:  Yes, I'm here. This is the future. I need to go actually put this on

208
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,590
Speaker 3:  my regular daily driver phone. It was just like, okay.

209
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,370
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I've, I've, I've got iOS now. And it's slightly

210
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,300
Speaker 3:  taped in lots of little tiny ways. Like, I love that they've improved

211
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,450
Speaker 3:  the print dialogue. I love that we've gone from, you could never print on

212
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,840
Speaker 3:  an iPhone. You enter the print dialogue. You can

213
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,180
Speaker 3:  like the print dialogue has improved.

214
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,020
Speaker 3:  Like that. Wasn't one of my first things. That was one of those

215
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,600
Speaker 3:  things where I saw it online and I was like, Ooh, I'm going to go check that

216
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,990
Speaker 3:  out. Yeah. They also

217
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,980
Speaker 2:  Fixed the fix. They, so with

218
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,610
Speaker 2:  iOS 14, they broke the time thing where you like enter a time, the time

219
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,030
Speaker 2:  picker, where it like loses focus and you can't tab between them. And I like

220
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,570
Speaker 2:  tap on this tiny little box and like enter in a number and sometimes it just

221
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,230
Speaker 2:  gets lost. And so they, they didn't, they kept that. But then they brought

222
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,530
Speaker 2:  back the giant dials. So like now it's both of those

223
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,500
Speaker 2:  things. So like, I'm glad, I'm glad they brought back the dials. Cause that's

224
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,280
Speaker 2:  easier to use, but there's just a bunch of like, oh, we tried some

225
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,120
Speaker 2:  stuff in an hour. We're just going to keep trying some stuff. Like it

226
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,750
Speaker 2:  was very, very Android in that way. There's a bunch of

227
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,520
Speaker 2:  UI stuff that like, really, you just you're going to go that way. Okay.

228
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:58,830
Speaker 2:  It

229
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,190
Speaker 3:  Feels cleaner. It does feel like slightly

230
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,120
Speaker 3:  cleaner. Like when it booted up, I was like, no iOS, heck yeah. Look

231
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,210
Speaker 3:  at this. It's like the bubbles have a little bit more shape to them

232
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,990
Speaker 3:  and they're losing a little like the shadow and

233
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,500
Speaker 3:  okay. We're transitioning in our, in our, in our design language. But

234
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,860
Speaker 3:  like, it was very, is so, so tiny the

235
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,210
Speaker 3:  changes. Okay. But

236
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,170
Speaker 1:  Some of the features are like huge underneath this like little,

237
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,590
Speaker 1:  yeah.

238
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,800
Speaker 3:  Yeah. There's a lot of like stuff lurking under the surface. Like I don't

239
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,610
Speaker 3:  know, ex the, the SIF data data thing is, is one that I was

240
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,330
Speaker 3:  like, oh, that's awesome. Like that's a very

241
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,130
Speaker 3:  under talked about things,

242
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,910
Speaker 1:  Such a apple move, right? Like for years,

243
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,000
Speaker 1:  people have been like, I'd like to see all of the info about my photos and

244
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,810
Speaker 1:  the photos app and apples. And like, no. And then there's

245
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,410
Speaker 1:  like an, our, like there's an entire economy of

246
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,400
Speaker 1:  apps to do this very simple thing. And

247
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,670
Speaker 1:  now they've added it. And everyone's like, amazing. And it's like, no, dude,

248
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,540
Speaker 1:  they, you just got some water. You were just so thirsty and they

249
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,760
Speaker 1:  just gave you some water. I was absolutely

250
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,540
Speaker 3:  Parched. And now I can delete all of these apps. I never use to

251
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,320
Speaker 3:  begin with that. Like I had on my phone just to like, be like,

252
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,380
Speaker 3:  that'll show apple. I do want this.

253
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,900
Speaker 1:  That's one of the highlight. Some of the highlight features, I think we should,

254
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,530
Speaker 1:  we should start with FaceTime. And that in a context of everything is the

255
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,280
Speaker 1:  same across all of its platforms. And there's, they're just kind of exposing

256
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,210
Speaker 1:  services. FaceTime took a gigantic step

257
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,660
Speaker 1:  into being a competitor, to zoom in many

258
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,690
Speaker 1:  ways and into a cross-platform

259
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,380
Speaker 1:  service in the sense that Android and windows, people can

260
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,250
Speaker 1:  now participate in FaceTime calls. They can not start them.

261
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,610
Speaker 1:  They cannot write one, but they can join one, which is very

262
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,820
Speaker 1:  strange. I think I said this in the live, well, apple runs on WebEx and they

263
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,770
Speaker 1:  like have, if listeners have used, WebEx is for

264
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,700
Speaker 1:  software. There's a part of me that says that Tim cook was like, I can't

265
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,510
Speaker 1:  use this anymore. Like we got to do something in on the

266
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,640
Speaker 1:  FaceTime team was like, oh, crappy means

267
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,570
Speaker 1:  us just started like developing

268
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,810
Speaker 1:  FaceTime. But so FaceTime, they've added some of the basics that you would

269
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,350
Speaker 1:  expect. They went away from there. Their weird bubbles view. There's just

270
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,880
Speaker 1:  a straight up grid view in FaceTime. They needed to do that a long time ago.

271
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,570
Speaker 3:  Well, no, it's an option now. Yeah. Yeah. Because, because there's, there's

272
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,290
Speaker 3:  the bubbles and the bubbles will now have spatial audio and you'll be able

273
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,220
Speaker 3:  to be like, oh, he's over there. Oh, she's over there. And, or you can

274
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,640
Speaker 3:  just do a grid and I guess they'll all just hit you in the face with their

275
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,030
Speaker 3:  voices. I'm not sure how that part's worked. I have not done the FaceTime

276
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,630
Speaker 3:  yet.

277
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,270
Speaker 1:  Well, it's interesting on the microphone side, if they're going to be able

278
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,230
Speaker 1:  to capture that kind of depth right.

279
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,040
Speaker 1:  From the people in the room with you. So we'll see, like, there's a lot of

280
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,490
Speaker 1:  questions about how spatial audio work with FaceTime, but they have built

281
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,180
Speaker 1:  it out into a more full featured zoom competitor. I think fairly their

282
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,750
Speaker 1:  assumption is, and this is true in my family. I'm not

283
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,650
Speaker 1:  sending zoom links when I want the grandparents to see my kid, right?

284
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,610
Speaker 1:  Like we're just like FaceTiming them. And if you can make that better than

285
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,760
Speaker 1:  you're going to eliminate an entire consumer use case for zoom that people

286
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,570
Speaker 1:  have started doing in the pandemic. Great. Then there's

287
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,500
Speaker 1:  this send a link and it'll work on the web, which Peter, I know you

288
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,380
Speaker 1:  have just a litany of thoughts about,

289
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,710
Speaker 2:  Well, I mean, it's, so what you can't FaceTime call somebody on Android or

290
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,920
Speaker 2:  windows or whatever you can, you can create the link. And then that link

291
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,850
Speaker 2:  allows other people to join. And I believe there's like

292
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,180
Speaker 2:  some moderation stuff built into that. I mean, there would need to be, yeah.

293
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,390
Speaker 1:  There's like the, it's like the waiting room. Like you can join the link

294
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,660
Speaker 1:  and whoever owns the call can invite, let you in or not.

295
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,510
Speaker 2:  You have to get approved to get in. And then they, I think they can boot

296
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,410
Speaker 2:  you. And you know, I'm sure it's just using web RTC,

297
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,800
Speaker 2:  which is how pretty much every video conference on the web works these

298
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,790
Speaker 2:  days, which is great. You know, we've been dunking on Steve

299
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,430
Speaker 2:  jobs said FaceTime would be an open protocol for what a

300
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,220
Speaker 2:  decade.

301
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,970
Speaker 4:  And

302
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,960
Speaker 2:  You know, it would, it would be nice if this were, I dunno, I

303
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,680
Speaker 2:  feel like FaceTime links and having

304
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Speaker 2:  Android and windows users join them is going to be the video equivalent of

305
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,400
Speaker 2:  green bubbles. Right. You can't call them, you got to like hit an extra button

306
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,830
Speaker 2:  to bring up the link. And then you got to figure out how to text the link

307
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,740
Speaker 2:  and it's going to take them over green bubbles and blah, blah, blah, blah,

308
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,490
Speaker 2:  blah, blah, blah. It is going to be another sort of

309
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,360
Speaker 2:  subtle incentive for people to be like, oh, can you just get on an iPhone?

310
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,320
Speaker 2:  This'll be easier. That's like, I feel like it's great that they're opening

311
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,220
Speaker 2:  up to other platforms, but I feel like they did it in the way that would

312
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,400
Speaker 2:  be most likely to get people back onto their platform.

313
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,820
Speaker 1:  Yeah. There's a part of it. That's fair. Right? Set windows

314
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,660
Speaker 1:  aside like apple making a full on FaceTime windows app. Okay.

315
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,910
Speaker 1:  That's like a, that's a high bar. They're not going

316
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,410
Speaker 1:  to apple making a FaceTime Android

317
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,260
Speaker 1:  app bank sense. I think it seems like an eminently reasonable thing. They

318
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,040
Speaker 1:  obviously make apple music for Android. If you make a FaceTime

319
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,970
Speaker 1:  app, then you might as well just put a message on it. Like you're so

320
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,150
Speaker 1:  close to having that message an Android and you can't do

321
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,020
Speaker 1:  it. That's the end of that conversation

322
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,060
Speaker 1:  because just a standalone app that only does video calling to

323
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,270
Speaker 1:  iPhones. It's nuts.

324
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,230
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So I think there's a reason they went with a

325
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,190
Speaker 1:  web ID. We don't know how it works yet on the web. I

326
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,550
Speaker 1:  think there's a lot of question marks around like what set of web technologies

327
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,090
Speaker 1:  is apple using to make this work? Because if it is the standards that we

328
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,050
Speaker 1:  kind of suspect they might be using that opens the door to a lot of

329
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,010
Speaker 1:  other things happening. Yeah. But I will say that Dieter's, Dieter's

330
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,700
Speaker 1:  making a face at

331
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,970
Speaker 2:  Me. I think, I don't know what it's going to open the door to honestly, like

332
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,130
Speaker 2:  they're going to use like the standard that everyone's using, their he's

333
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,120
Speaker 2:  whatever RTC there'll be some moderation stuff. Hopefully they've thought

334
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,600
Speaker 2:  through that. Yeah. I actually am like, I'm less enthused and think this

335
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,150
Speaker 2:  is less big deal than I think everybody else.

336
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,240
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's like, again, it's, you're so thirsty. It's like apple did something

337
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,780
Speaker 1:  cross-platform and you're like, oh, the world will reorder it. And it's like,

338
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,630
Speaker 1:  nah, we'll see. We'll see how it goes. I don't

339
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,500
Speaker 2:  Think that Android and windows users get to participate in share play. Alex,

340
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,660
Speaker 2:  can you talk like, what's your perspective on this, this

341
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,810
Speaker 2:  feature,

342
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,470
Speaker 3:  The share play the way that you can now watch movies with your, your

343
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,890
Speaker 3:  friends. I mean, like, I think it's, I think it's a really

344
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,820
Speaker 3:  interesting idea. And I also think it's mainly so apple, like it's for apple.

345
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,510
Speaker 3:  I think it's less for the services because the services have all had this.

346
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,500
Speaker 3:  They've all been able to do it. And now it's like, Apple's the first, you

347
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,040
Speaker 3:  know, big phone operating system maker

348
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,430
Speaker 3:  too, to kind of glom onto this and make an actual API that everybody could

349
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,360
Speaker 3:  use. And, and Google and, and windows are probably both like Microsoft, both

350
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,260
Speaker 3:  kicking themselves that they didn't think of this first. And so I think

351
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,590
Speaker 3:  it's, I think it's really smart. And I'll be curious to see who

352
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,490
Speaker 3:  actually uses it because I've done the whole

353
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,030
Speaker 3:  watching movies with a friend over the phone. Like you both have your phones

354
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,900
Speaker 3:  and you started at the same time or whatever. And it's awful. It's just a

355
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,680
Speaker 3:  really boring way. Like it is not the it's like a zoom call. It is

356
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,370
Speaker 3:  not the same as being in the same room as somebody and like watching it on

357
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,620
Speaker 3:  the couch together, put back in you

358
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,220
Speaker 1:  Is the mayor of east hand finale happened the other

359
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,180
Speaker 1:  day. My wife wanted to watch it with her mom and I fell down

360
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,960
Speaker 1:  just an insane rabbit hole of making a new

361
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,680
Speaker 1:  HBO max account on my wife's 18 T phone

362
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,430
Speaker 1:  number, not ours. Cause we didn't want to like, cause we both get it for

363
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,420
Speaker 1:  free with our plans. So we're not technically cheating.

364
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,300
Speaker 1:  And like, I don't know if you've ever tried to walk your mother-in-law

365
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,930
Speaker 1:  through. I need you to log in first I needed Becky to change

366
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,860
Speaker 1:  her 18 T password so she could share it with her mom. Oh my God. And

367
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,790
Speaker 1:  then her mom could log into her 18 T account and HBO max, like if I

368
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,740
Speaker 1:  could just like, I need you to push this button. Yeah. Watch this

369
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,190
Speaker 1:  show together. That would have been much better.

370
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,130
Speaker 3:  And my mom's had an apple TV for three years now and I think she's turned

371
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,000
Speaker 3:  it on twice. So I've not really, really pumped for her

372
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,540
Speaker 3:  to, to, to fully embrace it. But I think it's, I think it is super, super

373
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,630
Speaker 3:  easy. I think we're going to see more like younger people using it than us

374
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,590
Speaker 3:  old. I could be wrong about that, but I think it's

375
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,650
Speaker 3:  just brilliant of them to do it.

376
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,470
Speaker 1:  We have a list of partner to save announce at launch Disney plus Hulu HBO

377
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,070
Speaker 1:  max makes sense. Twitch super interesting

378
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,640
Speaker 1:  because everyone's already watching Twitch. It's like, it's strange to think

379
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,850
Speaker 1:  about watching more Twitch more together than you are already watching Twitch

380
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,780
Speaker 1:  together. Take talk, which is a deeply

381
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,840
Speaker 1:  fascinating psychological experiment into other people's Tik TOK

382
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,800
Speaker 1:  algo. I'm not sure I want to open that door. I don't want to open it

383
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,400
Speaker 1:  close master class, which just

384
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,980
Speaker 1:  like, you're very hopeful, very

385
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,940
Speaker 1:  hopeful idea that I'm going to sit down and watch like Robert DeNiro

386
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,480
Speaker 1:  teach us the act together, NBA and ESPN plus that makes sense. Paramount

387
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,750
Speaker 1:  plus make sense players. He didn't make sense. Chris was not on the list,

388
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,920
Speaker 1:  man.

389
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,580
Speaker 5:  The streaming company that now thinks it's too big to deal with any of these

390
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,730
Speaker 5:  features from other companies that will be Netflix.

391
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,570
Speaker 1:  I mean just like a fascinating emission, right? Like they, as I was saying,

392
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,960
Speaker 1:  they do have, Netflix has its own version of doing this it's cross platform.

393
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,900
Speaker 1:  It works everywhere. If you're that big, you just don't need to use the system

394
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,860
Speaker 1:  feature. And so we're just gonna like, see how that works. We do

395
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,820
Speaker 1:  have some information on like how Champlain operates. So the demo that

396
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,730
Speaker 1:  they gave to developers was not a streaming video app. It was a whiteboard

397
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,540
Speaker 1:  app. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. So there's an element of

398
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,690
Speaker 1:  this where, you know, for the video apps, what they're really doing is they're

399
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,600
Speaker 1:  just sinking video players. So if I try to

400
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,690
Speaker 1:  share, let's assume HBO max is

401
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,560
Speaker 1:  operating. It's a 50, 50 proposition most days, but

402
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,220
Speaker 1:  yeah, we're going to watch HBO max together. I hit share play it.

403
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,160
Speaker 1:  Doesn't I'm not like rebroadcasting the stream to you over

404
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,880
Speaker 1:  FaceTime. Right? It's just sending a deep link into the HBO

405
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,330
Speaker 1:  max app. That app opens on your phone. You have to be

406
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,930
Speaker 1:  authenticated to it. And then the video players are sinked

407
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,620
Speaker 1:  up. So there's like, there's something very simple underneath all of this

408
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,890
Speaker 1:  that enables you to do a whole bunch of other stuff with apps, which I think

409
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,730
Speaker 1:  is super interesting. But that means everybody has to

410
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,660
Speaker 1:  have a Hulu account or whatever. And it's kind of unclear. Like you can have

411
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,110
Speaker 1:  all these different tiers of these various things. Like what if Chris

412
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,980
Speaker 1:  has Pula without ads? And I have Hulu with ads

413
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,970
Speaker 1:  Chris after just like, stop, watch some horrible

414
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,800
Speaker 3:  Chris, it's just like potty break every 10

415
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,590
Speaker 3:  minutes.

416
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,380
Speaker 1:  I'm like, oh no, I'm watching the same commercial again. Chris, would you

417
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,340
Speaker 1:  like me to tell you that? So I

418
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,210
Speaker 1:  think there's like some stuff in here that is like fascinating to

419
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,020
Speaker 1:  see how it plays out and have the services implement it because the API

420
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,700
Speaker 1:  itself is kind of very simple, but it is very cool. I think a lot of people

421
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,540
Speaker 1:  are gonna try to use it. I think one of the big questions I have is how discoverable

422
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,810
Speaker 1:  is this UI? Like there's a lot of floating iOS

423
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,360
Speaker 1:  boxes that just like show up on your screen. You've got to move them around.

424
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,710
Speaker 1:  You can like swipe to pull them down. We'll see. I might, I'm excited to

425
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,950
Speaker 1:  use it just because I did have this HBO max experience the other day. And

426
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,940
Speaker 1:  I was like, oh man, if only I could have just pushed this button for that,

427
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,910
Speaker 1:  I left the room. I was like, I'm, I've done my part. You're both watching

428
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,330
Speaker 1:  the show.

429
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,910
Speaker 3:  One of you is five seconds ahead. Deal with it. I

430
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:19,090
Speaker 3:  believe

431
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,540
Speaker 1:  I've gotten as close as I can get. Oh, that's super cool. I

432
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,290
Speaker 1:  just we'll see how it, how it plays out. Chris, anything stand

433
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,070
Speaker 1:  out.

434
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,550
Speaker 5:  I think the map stuff seems pretty cool. It seems like they are really, really

435
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,030
Speaker 5:  focused on making maps really, really good. I mean they did a lot of like

436
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,090
Speaker 5:  visual stuff. It looks really pretty. They're like overpasses and stuff and

437
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,600
Speaker 5:  maps. They stole that feature from a Google where you point your phone at

438
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,700
Speaker 5:  like a building to see which way you're facing. And so that's great. And

439
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,020
Speaker 5:  just seems like there's sort of like <inaudible> kind of stuff in there so

440
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,960
Speaker 5:  you can see where that's kind of starting to come together. But yeah, I think

441
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,690
Speaker 5:  that they've got a pretty huge focus on that this year too.

442
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,650
Speaker 1:  The power of apple is that I've forgotten. Google has that feature.

443
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,640
Speaker 1:  So like the next day I was like in New York city and I came up out of

444
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,790
Speaker 1:  the subway and I was like work super well. And I was like, I'm gonna use

445
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,800
Speaker 1:  this Google feature. I forgot about

446
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,670
Speaker 5:  Why my phone compass can tell which way I'm pacing in the year 2021.

447
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,260
Speaker 5:  But sometimes it still happens.

448
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,890
Speaker 3:  So there's a little circle over and over and over again. And you just

449
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,700
Speaker 3:  like, you go with it. If you walk four blocks the wrong way, it's just a

450
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,500
Speaker 3:  little exercise.

451
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,490
Speaker 1:  What do you think of the new look in maps? It's they, you know,

452
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,700
Speaker 1:  Google kind of tends towards realism or very

453
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,540
Speaker 1:  sparse like outlines of buildings. Like

454
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,410
Speaker 1:  Google is either like full on street view or it's like, here's some lightly

455
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,860
Speaker 1:  rendered buildings to give you a suggestion. Apple's like, it's a

456
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,880
Speaker 1:  cartoon.

457
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,270
Speaker 5:  You can zoom in and like, see inside the apple store, as you assume it, you

458
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,370
Speaker 5:  mean close enough.

459
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,190
Speaker 1:  I think people really responded to it. How do you feel about it?

460
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,700
Speaker 5:  I like it personally quite a bit, just because like you're saying Google

461
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,760
Speaker 5:  is kind of like basic and plain and it's like very efficient, but like Apple's

462
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,720
Speaker 5:  clearly going for some more visual flash and flourishes. And as long

463
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,240
Speaker 5:  as like the data is there and that part's gotten a lot better too, over the

464
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,170
Speaker 5:  last few years, I think it's going to be pretty nice. And especially the

465
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,560
Speaker 5:  turn by turn directions, look a lot better now from what I saw. So

466
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,110
Speaker 1:  Dieter, you called this out in the lifeline, right? They said, okay, here's

467
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,980
Speaker 1:  the new turn by turn. They're very cool. They're like swoopy

468
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,880
Speaker 1:  overhead. They show you the roads, do all this zooming. And they're like,

469
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,870
Speaker 1:  we'll be on CarPlay in the next few months. Yeah. And I, that, I don't

470
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,080
Speaker 1:  understand it all because CarPlay fundamentally is just a second monitor

471
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,380
Speaker 1:  for your phone. Well, there's not like a lot happening. Well, there's

472
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,980
Speaker 2:  A lot happening graphically with some of these animations and some car

473
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,380
Speaker 2:  plates rendered on your phone, right. Maybe

474
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,260
Speaker 5:  It's too visually intensive now, like for a phone screen.

475
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,130
Speaker 2:  Right. But if you've got CarPlay wireless, maybe there,

476
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,660
Speaker 2:  you know, they did this stuff, knowing that how to do it on a phone with

477
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,120
Speaker 2:  direct pipe, but they haven't thought through how are they going to do it

478
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,720
Speaker 2:  to make sure it works on a bunch of different car displays. I think

479
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,650
Speaker 2:  that for all of Apple's strengths, one of its weaknesses is that it is,

480
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,160
Speaker 2:  does, does, does not have the muscle of working with a huge open ecosystem

481
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,000
Speaker 2:  of manufacturers. And so it might just take them a minute to

482
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,640
Speaker 2:  get this for carpet.

483
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,180
Speaker 1:  I feel like sometimes I know how CarPlay works. And

484
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,020
Speaker 1:  then in moments like this, it's like, oh, I have no idea.

485
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,920
Speaker 1:  My impression of CarPlay is that it's just sending, it's just a

486
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,850
Speaker 1:  monitor. It's just sending a 60 frames per second video screen to your card

487
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,720
Speaker 1:  display. That's essentially all that processing is happening on your phone.

488
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,140
Speaker 1:  And you're just saying the sizes and shapes of other displays in the world

489
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,590
Speaker 1:  have confounded apple, which seems ridiculous.

490
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,430
Speaker 2:  I mean, remember like the iPhone was made you hard code to

491
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:38,240
Speaker 2:  pixel dimensions for like almost a decade before they're like, oh wait, we

492
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,910
Speaker 2:  might want to do different screen sizes. We should think about this a little

493
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,900
Speaker 2:  bit more. Yeah. So, okay. I'm going to, I want to change subjects.

494
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,500
Speaker 2:  Can we talk about focus modes for like three hours, maybe

495
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,460
Speaker 2:  four, because that's how many emotions I have about it. Create a

496
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:52,910
Speaker 2:  focus

497
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,160
Speaker 4:  Now to talk about focus modes.

498
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,730
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I'm going to hit the button. All notifications of pause. Oh dear.

499
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,630
Speaker 2:  Okay. So they've created profiles the way that you had profiles on

500
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,540
Speaker 2:  your Nokia phone in 1997, you can now do them

501
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,490
Speaker 2:  on your iPhone. So you basically can choose like

502
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,240
Speaker 2:  do not disturb or sleep or driving or

503
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,230
Speaker 2:  personal or work, or you can make your own like fitness exercise,

504
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,980
Speaker 2:  whatever podcasting, podcasting. Yeah. When you turn on one of these

505
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,040
Speaker 2:  modes, it changes all your notification settings. You can have custom settings

506
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,880
Speaker 2:  for who and who is not allowed to contact you. You can have custom notification

507
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,840
Speaker 2:  settings for which apps are and are not allowed to show up here.

508
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,780
Speaker 2:  You can have custom home screens that appear disappear depending on what

509
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,130
Speaker 2:  focus mode that you're in.

510
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,970
Speaker 1:  By the way, I just want to cry to you. Apple's official terminology

511
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,900
Speaker 1:  is that you're in a focus. No. Which is right next

512
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,860
Speaker 1:  to like do a blog in terms of just like, I

513
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,470
Speaker 1:  know what you're saying, but I need you to not say it anymore. Oh God sponsored.

514
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,770
Speaker 1:  But yes, go ahead. When you're in a focus when you're in a

515
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,230
Speaker 4:  Focus, oh my God.

516
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,860
Speaker 1:  That's what they keep saying. It was this just kind of saying it. I was

517
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,400
Speaker 1:  like, I want to ask you about it, but I really don't want to know the

518
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,240
Speaker 1:  answer. So you

519
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,960
Speaker 2:  Can already like show and hide different home. So different photo

520
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,860
Speaker 2:  PSI focuses can show and hide different home screens. And

521
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,950
Speaker 2:  that means by the way, that you can have more than one app app icon on your

522
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,440
Speaker 2:  different home screen. So you can have Twitter in like four different places

523
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,890
Speaker 2:  and they can appear and disappear. So the number of calls that I'm gonna

524
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,760
Speaker 2:  have to deal with my relatives who aren't super tech savvy with, like

525
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,630
Speaker 2:  where'd my icons go, is going to be off the charts. Now I will say

526
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,380
Speaker 2:  that there is, there is one thing I want to give apple credit for. With

527
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,370
Speaker 2:  focus. Focus modes is all a bunch of these were already there in

528
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,670
Speaker 2:  iOS 14, we already had drive mode, do not disturb mode and

529
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,530
Speaker 2:  sleep. What they've done is they've actually just put a proper UI

530
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,520
Speaker 2:  on it. And they subsumed all of those modes that were sort of weird before

531
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,420
Speaker 2:  into this feature. So there's something smart about that,

532
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,390
Speaker 2:  but I'd be very curious to see if anybody actually uses this. If anybody

533
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,570
Speaker 2:  can actually figure out how to configure it. And if Apple's AI, which is

534
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,990
Speaker 2:  going to automatically, pre-configure the different focus modes. When you

535
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,680
Speaker 2:  turn them on, we'll actually do what you want it to do. So many

536
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,640
Speaker 2:  feelings.

537
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,380
Speaker 1:  I feel like these are all connected to, I don't even, it's just like, all

538
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,740
Speaker 1:  of this is also connected to how they're handling notifications. Yeah. Which

539
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,460
Speaker 1:  seems extremely complicated. And this is all

540
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,390
Speaker 1:  stuff that works really well. When I reviewed the home pod

541
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,170
Speaker 1:  I had in the back of my mind, like the apple man,

542
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,010
Speaker 1:  right? Like dress in all black wire-frame glasses

543
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,400
Speaker 1:  that has a design job. Yeah. You know, lives

544
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,820
Speaker 1:  alone only uses apple services and is very

545
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,060
Speaker 1:  demanding. And there is not a one straight icon on their

546
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,120
Speaker 1:  desktop. Yeah. And it's like, they made the home pod for that

547
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,070
Speaker 1:  person. That market was small and they discontinued the whole

548
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,810
Speaker 1:  pot. Right. Then there's like me and like the

549
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,530
Speaker 1:  icons everywhere, just screenshots for, from five years ago or so littering

550
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,920
Speaker 1:  my screen. Yeah. And I'm not, I'm never going to sit here and

551
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,850
Speaker 1:  like beat my way through all the settings sort of focus Smiths. But

552
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,720
Speaker 1:  yeah. AI is supposed to like somehow bridge that gap. Right. And I

553
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,680
Speaker 1:  that's like the, the big question mark is whether you can

554
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,400
Speaker 1:  deduce from my chaotic phone usage, some

555
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,270
Speaker 1:  set of order in rules about how I might

556
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,080
Speaker 1:  use my phone at any moment in the answers like, oh, just

557
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,920
Speaker 1:  take Instagram off that thing and just, just get rid of

558
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,430
Speaker 1:  that. And I will be more productive at work.

559
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,820
Speaker 2:  So we should talk about the ecosystem for half a second too, because focus

560
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,540
Speaker 2:  modes can automatically sync across all your apple devices, Mac

561
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,530
Speaker 2:  watch, phone, iPad, whatever. And if you so choose,

562
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,340
Speaker 2:  you can make your focus modes available to other iPhone Mac

563
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,790
Speaker 2:  iOS, apple users. So they can see your focus mode. They can see that you're

564
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,000
Speaker 2:  on a, do not disturb or whatever. And the time

565
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,180
Speaker 2:  from this is a cool feature. That's sort of like an away message. I don't

566
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,510
Speaker 2:  know, but it's not quite the thing, but maybe I'll use it to

567
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,320
Speaker 2:  teenagers harassing each other by setting focus modes, explicitly designed

568
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,130
Speaker 2:  to tease their friends or enemies is going to be so short.

569
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,530
Speaker 2:  That's. I mean, I mean, I'm doing it tonight

570
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,080
Speaker 1:  On the scale of I've enabled malicious teens. I

571
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,910
Speaker 1:  yeah. Focus mode billing is okay. Yeah. Okay. Can't

572
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,360
Speaker 1:  hurt people too badly. They got to learn it somewhere. One of the things

573
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,960
Speaker 1:  that's really interesting about needing to be an ecosystem in several of

574
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,290
Speaker 1:  the focus modes, they're like, we'll let notifications from certain people

575
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,680
Speaker 1:  through, right. Which is like conceptually

576
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,490
Speaker 1:  great. There are many situations in which you'd like, I just want my

577
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,300
Speaker 1:  family to get to me, but I need to focus otherwise unclear

578
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,290
Speaker 1:  how they're detecting, who is who inside of apps. So if I want,

579
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:41,060
Speaker 1:  if, if I want to turn everything off, but Dieter can slack me. I have no

580
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,450
Speaker 1:  idea if that's possible, because I don't think slack is exposing

581
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,320
Speaker 1:  who messages are from to the notification system. It's

582
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,950
Speaker 1:  just sending notifications. There's like another layer of data that has to

583
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,880
Speaker 1:  happen here. And then another layer of app vendors, not just lying

584
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,910
Speaker 1:  because they will like the New York times where like Dieter needs you to

585
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,630
Speaker 1:  know about this breaking news.

586
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,110
Speaker 2:  And also a third-party apps can also read those focus

587
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,740
Speaker 2:  statuses if they want. So in theory, if slack wanted

588
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,550
Speaker 2:  to, it could display your focus mode, notification haven't

589
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:16,390
Speaker 2:  changed your slack status, which I guess when you think about it,

590
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,900
Speaker 2:  you want your fundamental status to be handled by the

591
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,890
Speaker 2:  platform, I guess. But there is sort of a potential future tussle

592
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,730
Speaker 2:  for who's in charge of what status I'm telling other people I'm

593
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,540
Speaker 1:  In. Yeah. I mean, we've written about the desire to have a

594
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,630
Speaker 1:  universal living. It's basically an away message, but I can set a system-wide

595
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,410
Speaker 1:  away message and have a bunch of messaging apps, respect it, and

596
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,310
Speaker 1:  like use it a, we would have brought back away messages.

597
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:46,240
Speaker 1:  We should be great and be like, it would be tremendously useful. Now, do

598
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,110
Speaker 1:  I want my slack away message to be a bunch of emails,

599
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,410
Speaker 1:  song lyrics the way that I want my iMessage away message to be that. I mean,

600
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,220
Speaker 1:  that's, I don't know. I mean, that's how I ran with it in

601
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,140
Speaker 1:  aim

602
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,760
Speaker 4:  In college. I

603
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,300
Speaker 3:  Really want my mom to get a different away message than, than

604
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,690
Speaker 3:  work because she won't get that. She won't get the emo lyrics. She'll just

605
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,360
Speaker 3:  be very confused and continue to like text or call.

606
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,140
Speaker 1:  I continue to be successful in my career please. Yeah.

607
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,170
Speaker 1:  That's that's all I want for my mom. That's

608
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,100
Speaker 4:  All she needs

609
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,370
Speaker 3:  Doing fine. Can't talk.

610
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,860
Speaker 1:  I mean, this is the reason they announced the suffer early after developers

611
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,760
Speaker 1:  have to build towards it. They have to use it. What it

612
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,850
Speaker 1:  actually comes out and those apps are ready and they'll get updated. That

613
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,240
Speaker 1:  is when we know how well it works. The ideas are there. I

614
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,510
Speaker 1:  just, that one of like, I want to turn off all my

615
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,410
Speaker 1:  notifications, even now when I do that, I end up

616
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:45,130
Speaker 1:  enabling slack, which is the most distracting one of all right. And it's

617
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,670
Speaker 1:  like, I have to, because some of the people that need to be able to break

618
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,510
Speaker 1:  through the wall, messaged me on slack, or I have to go to all of them individually

619
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,290
Speaker 1:  and say, please text me for the next two hours, which makes no sense. We'll

620
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,020
Speaker 1:  see. I'm very curious how this works. There's a lot of messaging apps. I

621
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,840
Speaker 1:  think they're going to try to find ways around it or through it, but we'll

622
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,990
Speaker 1:  see. Do you want to talk about the privacy stuff real quick?

623
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,320
Speaker 2:  Ah, so there's a bunch, there's an ancillary thing, which we should maybe

624
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,920
Speaker 2:  circle back to, which is putting your ID on your phone. They're adding a,

625
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,880
Speaker 2:  sort of a, they changed the name from the pavers of iCloud icon plus, but

626
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,570
Speaker 2:  it's just iCloud that you pay for it. Now has this sort of double

627
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,530
Speaker 2:  proxy. That's not quite a VPN, but serves similarly the same sort

628
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,920
Speaker 2:  of functions as a VPN, kind of makes it harder for people to track what you're

629
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,790
Speaker 2:  doing on the web. They're finally doing something

630
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,360
Speaker 2:  to try and stop tracking pixels and mail unclear

631
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,250
Speaker 2:  how effective that will be. And similar it is to the thing that's

632
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,180
Speaker 2:  been on like Gmail for years upon years. And

633
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,050
Speaker 2:  then the other thing they're doing is they're creating an app privacy report

634
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,470
Speaker 2:  and they've also got an app privacy dashboard. So you can see when various

635
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,070
Speaker 2:  apps are using various sensors, this is similar to what just got announced

636
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,730
Speaker 2:  for Android 12. The app privacy report is sort of like the safari

637
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,420
Speaker 2:  report that like tells you how many trackers are on a webpage. I think with

638
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,390
Speaker 2:  app, with the app privacy report, that might be a little bit more actionable

639
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,290
Speaker 2:  than the safari one, but I don't know. We

640
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,130
Speaker 2:  shall see, but that's the big stuff is they're doing a

641
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,640
Speaker 2:  little bit better. Like obviously skating your activity online and they're

642
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,580
Speaker 2:  doing a little bit better showing you what other apps are

643
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,240
Speaker 2:  doing and they're not making

644
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,130
Speaker 1:  Some of this stuff available in China. Yeah. So the, the relay thing is

645
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:29,090
Speaker 1:  super interesting because there's actually two realized involved. One is

646
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,630
Speaker 1:  controlled by apple and the other by a third-party the third-party

647
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,870
Speaker 1:  might change in different countries from what we

648
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,080
Speaker 1:  understand so far as people have been using it, I think it's been

649
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,980
Speaker 1:  CloudFlare. Yeah. The, basically the first hop is through

650
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,970
Speaker 1:  apple, which obscures who you are.

651
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,720
Speaker 1:  And the second hop is to the third party provider, which obscures where,

652
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,140
Speaker 1:  where you're trying to go. Right. That's a lot of hops, right? So

653
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,890
Speaker 1:  like, I'm curious, will it be fast? Like, will

654
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,760
Speaker 1:  it interrupt anything? Will it break anything like, you know, Apple's

655
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,600
Speaker 1:  position is like, of course we tested it, but yet we have to see

656
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,930
Speaker 1:  then on the male side, I think Casey read about this on the, on the verge

657
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,770
Speaker 1:  suite cases, businesses running a newsletter. He's very interested

658
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:16,710
Speaker 1:  in how email analytics might be changed by this.

659
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,520
Speaker 1:  He published this stat, which he sourced from Neiman lab, which source it

660
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,510
Speaker 1:  from a third party analytics company, 93% of mobile

661
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,870
Speaker 1:  mail opens or in the mail app, which seems completely wrong to me. It can't

662
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,950
Speaker 1:  be right.

663
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,760
Speaker 2:  I mean on iPhone maybe, but it's yeah,

664
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,630
Speaker 2:  it's definitely higher than I think I'm willing to admit to myself because

665
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,380
Speaker 2:  I never used the mail app and I do not enjoy it. And I haven't for many

666
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,240
Speaker 2:  years, but I can't believe it's that

667
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,080
Speaker 1:  High. Yeah. If, if there's anybody out there in email marketing is panicking,

668
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,950
Speaker 1:  please tweet us your, your apple mail number or email us. I'm

669
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,160
Speaker 1:  very curious. It's one of the stats that we just don't ever think

670
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,120
Speaker 1:  about. And here it might have this like downstream impact. Yeah. The other

671
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,110
Speaker 1:  thing that all this privacy stuff, why is apple doing

672
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,290
Speaker 1:  all this privacy stuff? Yes. They want to protect your identity.

673
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,130
Speaker 1:  But the mechanism of like wanting to track you is all because of

674
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,000
Speaker 1:  advertising, right? Like the reason that your privacy is under risk is because

675
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,780
Speaker 1:  there's a gigantic advertising business model, the internet. Yeah. The advertising

676
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,810
Speaker 1:  ecosystem really wants to know who you are so they can target ads at you

677
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:21,740
Speaker 1:  and sell your things on Instagram. It works. People trust me, it's a

678
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,700
Speaker 1:  real problem for me. But the other side of it is, is

679
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,820
Speaker 1:  apple closes the funnel of advertising. It makes advertising businesses really

680
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,720
Speaker 1:  hard. They're they're ready and waiting to take

681
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,490
Speaker 1:  30% from any other purchases you might make on the phone

682
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,210
Speaker 1:  for things like newsletters or paid podcasts or anything like

683
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,720
Speaker 1:  that. So there's, I think Apple's in a complicated situation

684
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,680
Speaker 1:  here. Most of the media ecosystem, us included. I'm sure there's going

685
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,130
Speaker 1:  to be some to read on this podcast shortly,

686
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,850
Speaker 1:  but most of the media ecosystem runs on ads. The ads run on targeting. We

687
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,780
Speaker 1:  just know how this works. If you want to change that, the

688
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,930
Speaker 1:  burgeoning way of changing that is direct payments, right? That

689
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,470
Speaker 1:  is going and paying Casey for platform or directly. That

690
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,430
Speaker 1:  is tipping people in apps like Twitch and

691
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,210
Speaker 1:  Twitter with super follows and all that stuff that is

692
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,050
Speaker 1:  platforms like only fans and Patriot and all this stuff. And if you

693
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,630
Speaker 1:  think of those as digital products, because it's all just digital products,

694
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,480
Speaker 1:  right? You can't buy a Kindle book. What does it mean to buy a newsletter

695
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,380
Speaker 1:  on the iPhone apps and services that produce that stuff are

696
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,220
Speaker 1:  going to run into 30% tax. And so I think there's a little bit of a dilemma

697
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,730
Speaker 1:  here for apple, just in terms of they're shutting down, they're

698
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,720
Speaker 1:  closing down a bunch of advertising stuff and rightfully so. I

699
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,090
Speaker 1:  think people think that stuff is invasive and I think they have a great moral

700
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:44,080
Speaker 1:  case for it. They're also the absolute tollbooth

701
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,440
Speaker 1:  for the creator economy, unless the entire creator economy happens on the

702
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,160
Speaker 1:  web, which should be cool. I just didn't seem right. Well

703
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,730
Speaker 1:  also, I don't

704
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,420
Speaker 2:  Know if you notice, but they sure didn't announce any big improvements to

705
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,350
Speaker 2:  progressive web apps at the WWDC conference.

706
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,220
Speaker 2:  So that's, that's a thing didn't happen now.

707
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,180
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And like their improvements to safari or like now it'll be

708
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,780
Speaker 1:  harder to use because the address bar is going to

709
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,530
Speaker 1:  float around all over the place. I mean, like they didn't do any core web

710
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,600
Speaker 1:  stuff. They made safari like look better.

711
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,170
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They put the address bar on the bottom and like, hooray. That's great.

712
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,030
Speaker 2:  That's a better place for it on a phone

713
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,840
Speaker 1:  Because the phones are huge. Yeah. They moved, they moved a

714
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,130
Speaker 1:  bunch of UI to the bottom of the phone. So you can use it with one hand.

715
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:29,400
Speaker 1:  I can

716
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,940
Speaker 3:  Actually like use it with one hand now cause I have very, very small

717
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,480
Speaker 3:  hands. And so before I, if I wanted to like use the top, I'd have to like

718
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,380
Speaker 3:  get both hands out. And I'm very excited to just use it all with

719
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,500
Speaker 3:  one thumb. It's going to be great whole,

720
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,160
Speaker 5:  But back to the privacy thing for a second, there was one new feature

721
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,060
Speaker 5:  that not to get a little morbid, but I, with iOS 15, there'll be a new

722
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,570
Speaker 5:  feature that lets your family access your data and your photos should you

723
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:58,220
Speaker 5:  die? And they were super casual about this at the keynote, which came off

724
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,570
Speaker 5:  a little strange, but they were like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

725
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,410
Speaker 5:  So when you're gone, as you know, to, without any kind of

726
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:08,310
Speaker 5:  like, but yeah, it's kind of surprising that like this did not, was not

727
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,400
Speaker 5:  there before and now it will be now, which is good. I think,

728
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,270
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I'd say then it's actually a big policy change for apple because before

729
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,230
Speaker 1:  that was it, if nobody had your password, like all your stuff was gone.

730
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,560
Speaker 1:  So they've like made this change. I think Joanna wrote a big piece and had

731
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,460
Speaker 1:  a video about this. So like be you're right. It was

732
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,280
Speaker 1:  very casual. It was like, and now on the spatial audio and I was like, wait,

733
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,140
Speaker 1:  hold on. I'm still grappling with

734
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,140
Speaker 1:  inevitable mortality. Cause we just pumped the brakes for one

735
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,980
Speaker 1:  second. We should take a break actually and come back and talk about spatial

736
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,180
Speaker 1:  audio. We'll be right

737
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,320
Speaker 1:  back.

777
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,860
Speaker 1:  Okay. We're back. Yeah. There's a, there's more to talk about, but Chris,

778
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,820
Speaker 1:  you've been living in a spatial audio universe for these

779
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,390
Speaker 1:  past few days. Tell us what's going on here. Cause there's like a lot of

780
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:17,110
Speaker 1:  spatial audio news. It was took, it was tucked into every nook and

781
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,440
Speaker 1:  cranny of this announcement and it's actually really hard to unpack

782
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,100
Speaker 5:  It. Yeah, because now there are two kinds of spatial audio from apple, which

783
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,950
Speaker 5:  isn't confusing at all. There's a head

784
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,790
Speaker 5:  tracking kind of special audio, which came out last year

785
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,620
Speaker 5:  for and TV shows. So if you watch through certain apps and you have air pods,

786
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 5:  you can turn your head and the sound will stay like planted or fixed, like

787
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,890
Speaker 5:  on your source device, like your iPad or Europe or your iPhone, which is

788
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,610
Speaker 5:  cool. That works super well. But this past week they

789
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,450
Speaker 5:  launched special audio for apple music and that works with

790
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,110
Speaker 5:  all headphones. So that's cool. But this whole thing about like surround

791
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:55,590
Speaker 5:  sound music is not a new concept. I don't know how many people listening

792
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,370
Speaker 5:  to the shove, her like a super audio CD, but the music industry has been

793
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,730
Speaker 5:  pushing this kind of thing for years and years and years. And so this is

794
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,420
Speaker 5:  like the latest take on that. And that's all done through Atmos and

795
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,290
Speaker 5:  a certain tracks sound really special, but I'd say

796
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,040
Speaker 5:  70%, you're just kind of sitting there wondering what happened to the song

797
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,300
Speaker 5:  that you knew before

798
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,160
Speaker 1:  70% really? Oh, it's so hit and miss dude.

799
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,000
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So, so there's like a lot to unpack here. So the

800
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,480
Speaker 1:  spatial audio with the video, the reason that it does head tracking makes

801
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,960
Speaker 1:  a lot of sense because, but it's basically just taking

802
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,770
Speaker 1:  surround sound for a movie. We've got a center channel and the

803
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,710
Speaker 1:  voices are always coming out of the center channel. Right. And kind of recreating

804
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:40,370
Speaker 1:  it in a 3d sound field around you. So if you

805
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,640
Speaker 1:  turn your head, it still seems like the voices are coming out of the people

806
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,630
Speaker 1:  on the screen. I totally buy it. It is

807
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,500
Speaker 1:  one of the cooler sort of like AirPods demos you can

808
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,130
Speaker 1:  do with someone, which is very impressive. It has a

809
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,000
Speaker 1:  utility to it. Like I, there's a part of me. That's like, I, it's more fun

810
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,370
Speaker 1:  to watch movies this way. Cause it's like, everything's all moving around.

811
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:05,180
Speaker 1:  Right. And then I'm like, wait, I own several televisions. What am I

812
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,990
Speaker 1:  doing? The music stuff is different. Like

813
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,740
Speaker 1:  it's different from like a business way. It's different from a

814
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,830
Speaker 1:  experience way. And then it's different as Chris was saying and

815
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:19,450
Speaker 1:  like, nobody knows how to use this stuff yet. It is just a mess. Like

816
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,180
Speaker 1:  it, some of these tracks are really impressive and cool. And some of them,

817
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,390
Speaker 1:  I think the joke I made is I listened to a simple man by Leonard Skinner

818
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:30,380
Speaker 1:  yesterday. And it just feels like it's hardest. It's like creepy

819
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,370
Speaker 1:  Ben up behind

820
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,660
Speaker 1:  you.

821
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,660
Speaker 1:  Why are you over there, dude? Like the rest of the band is on

822
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,600
Speaker 1:  stage, get to work, man.

823
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,990
Speaker 2:  Is it like a Looney tunes? Like your bugs buddy and the

824
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,780
Speaker 2:  guitarist is over FID and he's just getting closer and

825
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,780
Speaker 2:  closer. It's like, are we just

826
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,630
Speaker 2:  late?

827
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,990
Speaker 5:  Seems like a newer albums are better because like now producers actually

828
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,410
Speaker 5:  do mix like for Atmos, since like newer, newer albums, like the St. Vincent

829
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,560
Speaker 5:  one that people have been talking about. I think with some other stuff that's

830
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,550
Speaker 5:  been out recently is all mixed for Atmos. So it sounds good. But if you go

831
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,210
Speaker 5:  back to like, you know, old stuff, it's mostly like remasters and that really

832
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,420
Speaker 5:  comes down to like how much people care about like making it sound good on

833
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,630
Speaker 5:  Atmos. And it seems like if you're a fan of blink 180 2, you're going to

834
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,910
Speaker 5:  be disappointed.

835
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,580
Speaker 2:  That's really an evergreen state. But there

836
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,880
Speaker 2:  Chris,

837
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,430
Speaker 5:  They were the songs that are like the ones that check out to hear it bad.

838
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,170
Speaker 5:  And so I wasn't a Papa wrote yesterday for the first time in like 20 years,

839
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,660
Speaker 5:  because it was like a particularly bad

840
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,350
Speaker 5:  example, spatial audio. So I had to

841
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,060
Speaker 5:  experience

842
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,750
Speaker 1:  Well. So it's really interesting with that. Right? All those like big rock

843
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:46,740
Speaker 1:  songs, pop punk songs, they're all mixed for two channels and they're all

844
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,400
Speaker 1:  mixed to be pretty loud. Like all those sounds

845
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,180
Speaker 1:  or they're mixed, like in the studio that they caught frequencies. They

846
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,450
Speaker 1:  stack them to layer those sounds and make those songs sound

847
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,110
Speaker 1:  huge and like, right. They're just big sounding

848
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,950
Speaker 1:  songs. If you like disassemble them and move all the

849
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,800
Speaker 1:  instruments into corners of the sound field, like their

850
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,910
Speaker 1:  songs start to sound really empty. Right. And there's like the, I think that's

851
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:15,630
Speaker 1:  what most people have described as like, they feel really echo-y and empty

852
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:19,620
Speaker 1:  because you're not supposed to be able to pick out every little instrument.

853
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,460
Speaker 1:  It's supposed to be like a big wall of noise that like, right. We're just

854
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,450
Speaker 1:  going to learn how it works. And just like with stereo, like really, really

855
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:31,410
Speaker 1:  early stereo records, like the producers were overexcited and were just like

856
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:35,160
Speaker 1:  hard pan the guitars all over the place and they don't do it anymore. Like

857
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,000
Speaker 1:  they figured out how to use it. So we'll see. But there's just a

858
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,690
Speaker 1:  part of this where apple Eddie cue gave an

859
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:45,810
Speaker 1:  interview to Michael Singleton at billboard. Like he used to work at the

860
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,590
Speaker 1:  verge. It was

861
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,380
Speaker 5:  So mean about lossless my heart was broken.

862
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,280
Speaker 1:  It's like, no one can hear it. Your ears aren't good enough. Like, but he's

863
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,180
Speaker 1:  like, spacial is like HD. It's like, it's the jump to HD. Everyone can hear

864
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,450
Speaker 1:  it. And it's true. Everyone can hear it. Cause it sounds so different, but

865
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:04,110
Speaker 1:  it's not like you're getting more necessarily. It's just a different kind

866
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:04,860
Speaker 1:  of tool.

867
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,290
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He had tried to sell it quite a bit by saying it sounded like you're

868
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,770
Speaker 5:  like in the room with the band, which it's not that great. Even like I'm

869
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:14,490
Speaker 5:  seeking, listen, listen to it through headphones. But if you have like a

870
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,640
Speaker 5:  fallen Atmos system, you can play it from the apple TV 4k. And there, it

871
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,430
Speaker 5:  sounds really, really nice. But I think like the both of people, how they

872
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:23,130
Speaker 5:  hear this'll be through the AirPods most likely

873
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,550
Speaker 1:  Or any headphones, because you only need two channels. And all they're really

874
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,540
Speaker 1:  doing is playing weird phasing and delayed tricks. So you can do

875
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,450
Speaker 1:  it with any headphones. Cause you're just sending the signal out. What's

876
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:37,080
Speaker 1:  really interesting to me is that I think apple is making a big deal out of

877
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,410
Speaker 1:  it. They're like kind of owning it, right? Like this, it feels like apple

878
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:44,220
Speaker 1:  announced spatial audio. Correct. But like it's actually Warner

879
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,770
Speaker 1:  brothers and Dolby and universal.

880
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,230
Speaker 5:  They're just giving you these mixes. They already have

881
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:53,010
Speaker 1:  Three years ago. They're like, this is the, this is the thing. And I think

882
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,790
Speaker 1:  their hope was that everyone would charge more money for it and then pay

883
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,210
Speaker 1:  them more money because that's how the music industry works. They're

884
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:03,960
Speaker 1:  like, would you like to pay us for dark side of the moon again? We know you

885
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,860
Speaker 1:  would. And then like off they're off to the races, but like

886
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,670
Speaker 1:  these Atmos files are the same files that Amazon music

887
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:15,560
Speaker 1:  has. The title has that. Right. They're not getting special apple remasters.

888
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,470
Speaker 1:  So it's, I'm very curious to see if these things sound different across different

889
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:23,370
Speaker 1:  services, or if apple is doing some system level spatial

890
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:26,580
Speaker 1:  audio stuff, like there's just a lot of parts of the sort of

891
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,500
Speaker 1:  signal where I'm not sure what who's doing, what

892
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,090
Speaker 1:  when

893
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,940
Speaker 5:  Right. And they said this fall, they are going to bring the head tracking

894
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,420
Speaker 5:  stuff to apple music too. And so I think that's going to be pretty strange.

895
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,420
Speaker 5:  I'm not sure why.

896
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,050
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So you can like back up to the guitarist and get

897
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,090
Speaker 3:  closer.

898
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,130
Speaker 5:  You can turn around to that Skinner to guitarist.

899
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,760
Speaker 1:  I really want everyone. I'm sure you haven't listened to Skinner in a long

900
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,750
Speaker 1:  time. It's just feels like a fair bet. But apple made a

901
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,680
Speaker 1:  bunch of playlists right. Called like for apple music

902
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,440
Speaker 1:  in special audio. And it's, there's a rock one and a hip hop one. So like

903
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,560
Speaker 1:  just dive through them. They're fun to listen to, and like, just go into

904
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,800
Speaker 1:  the Rocklin and like, just listen to this dude.

905
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,700
Speaker 3:  I'm so excited. Like I'm honestly going to do it after, after we finish this

906
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,350
Speaker 3:  podcast. And it's only in those, like the spatial audio stuffs

907
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:17,200
Speaker 3:  only in those specific playlist. Right? Like you, can't just, it's not

908
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,980
Speaker 3:  like if you already had that song on a playlist, it's suddenly going to convert

909
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,380
Speaker 3:  it dependence.

910
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,070
Speaker 1:  I have it downloaded. You have to delete it and re download it. Obviously.

911
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:30,520
Speaker 1:  That makes sense. If it's just in a playlist and streaming, it'll just

912
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,790
Speaker 1:  play one thing. That's I, Chris and I were talking about this

913
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,850
Speaker 1:  yesterday. You can't turn it on and off in the

914
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:40,570
Speaker 1:  app per song, which I would really like to be able to

915
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:44,380
Speaker 1:  do. It's either on for apple music or it's

916
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,370
Speaker 1:  off. And like there's one setting in the middle called

917
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:52,270
Speaker 1:  automatic, which I don't quite understand, like the credits. Maybe you

918
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:56,260
Speaker 1:  can explain it better, but either way you're like enabling it

919
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,140
Speaker 1:  all the time or you're disabling it. And like, there are some songs

920
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,000
Speaker 1:  like, oh, this sounds great. Like classical music in spatial audio is

921
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,720
Speaker 1:  like very cool sounding jazz too. But any rock

922
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,420
Speaker 1:  song just sounds empty and like, I should just be able to turn it on and

923
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,260
Speaker 1:  off. Yeah, you

924
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,860
Speaker 5:  Should. I think so. Yeah. That's the auto mode. I think that does actually

925
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,250
Speaker 5:  look for Apple's own devices like the AirPods or certain beats and phones.

926
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,460
Speaker 5:  And so it'll just play those by default, which is kind of wild. Like millions

927
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,220
Speaker 5:  of people are now just going to hear this by default for their music. So

928
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,830
Speaker 5:  I guess that kind of shows how excited apple is about it. We'll have to see

929
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,460
Speaker 5:  where it goes. I mean, I have left it on and off to hear the difference.

930
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,090
Speaker 5:  And there's one shortcut where you can like use the control center and like

931
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,150
Speaker 5:  turn off spatial audio real fast. And that'll like switch the mics back to

932
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,600
Speaker 5:  the stereo version. And so that's the fastest way I've found to go back and

933
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,660
Speaker 5:  forth. And that's in the control center of the phone. So you can just pull

934
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,730
Speaker 5:  that down and do that, but there should just be like a button to press to

935
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,380
Speaker 5:  like switch between the two. I don't know as

936
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,250
Speaker 3:  Much about music as you guys do, because Neil, I started

937
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,740
Speaker 3:  talking about like all the bandwidth and stuff and I was like, oh, wow. I

938
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,250
Speaker 3:  didn't know any of that. This is new information. I was just listening. Isn't

939
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:01,150
Speaker 3:  really like HD for, for video. Or is it more like when they started

940
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:05,050
Speaker 3:  color like colorizing black and white films, whereas like these things were

941
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,320
Speaker 3:  never meant for this. And we're like, you know what? We're gonna, we're going

942
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,250
Speaker 3:  to put a bit of splash of color on here to get people excited about

943
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,380
Speaker 3:  it's a wonderful night.

944
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:18,280
Speaker 1:  That's I think this is like a very Vergecast question. What's is

945
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,270
Speaker 1:  like HD for video implies so many things.

946
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,100
Speaker 1:  It implies higher resolution. Obviously it also,

947
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,010
Speaker 1:  for most people imply to dis different aspect

948
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:32,910
Speaker 1:  ratio and then further implied a different form

949
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,780
Speaker 1:  factor of a TV that got everyone to buy a new TV. Yeah. There were some very

950
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,270
Speaker 1:  strange like HD

951
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,110
Speaker 1:  CRTs and they like were owned. They roamed the

952
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,320
Speaker 1:  earth like a dinosaur. And I was like, but for most people, when you say

953
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,100
Speaker 1:  HD, it's like, you might not have been seen the extra resolution. You might've

954
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,940
Speaker 1:  just been seeing that it was 16 by nine. Now you might not have been

955
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,690
Speaker 1:  perceiving 16 by nine. And I promise you most people, when you

956
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,750
Speaker 1:  start trying to explain aspect gracious to them, they very quickly stopped

957
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:00,990
Speaker 1:  dating

958
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:06,320
Speaker 1:  you

959
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,040
Speaker 1:  to a first Leicester. You might've just been perceiving that the TV was thinner

960
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,940
Speaker 1:  and on the wall. Right. So there's like a lot to unpack from HD and like

961
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,780
Speaker 1:  what people really meant and why you want that because it drove this

962
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,490
Speaker 1:  big buying cycle, isn't it

963
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:23,390
Speaker 2:  Better analog, just 3d, 3d TV. It was a desperate attempt to get

964
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:26,630
Speaker 2:  people to buy stuff and remaster stuff.

965
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,110
Speaker 5:  She had to buy stuff for 3d TV. Like here it's just there and

966
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:33,710
Speaker 5:  works. And where your little glasses. Yeah. So there are no glasses to buy

967
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,290
Speaker 5:  or like TVs to buy it, which was the worst part of the whole equation in

968
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:37,340
Speaker 5:  that case.

969
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,300
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But like so higher resolution is the reason Eddie Q is donking lossless

970
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,170
Speaker 1:  audio or the reason that, you know, it's fun to laugh at

971
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:49,040
Speaker 1:  audio files, you buy a $5,000 cables is because they Sue

972
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,160
Speaker 1:  people swear. They can hear it. And most people can't hear anything

973
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,610
Speaker 5:  Quote, from a Steve jobs. I think it was like one of the, all things D appearances

974
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,400
Speaker 5:  where he said like music is one of the first cases where people just settled

975
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,640
Speaker 5:  and stopped caring about quality. Like, whereas film, you just want like

976
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,000
Speaker 5:  4k and HD and it's gotten higher and higher, but for music, we just kind

977
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,990
Speaker 5:  of settled on like MP3 and AAC. So I guess that the question is now is

978
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:12,740
Speaker 5:  special audio. The thing that'll like send us to a new new

979
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,430
Speaker 5:  era.

980
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:17,270
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But the thing is like what you perceive when you see something

981
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,840
Speaker 1:  like the Delta between you seeing that it's different is like pretty

982
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,680
Speaker 1:  small compared to music. Right? Most people are like, I'm very happy

983
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,550
Speaker 1:  listening to the song. I like on a very tiny AirPods

984
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:32,360
Speaker 1:  AirPods sound like garbage people love them. What are you going to do? Right.

985
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,260
Speaker 1:  Like they like them. They're happy. They're moving on with their lives.

986
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:40,010
Speaker 1:  That's the job. That's the job. So you have to make it sound

987
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:43,790
Speaker 1:  really different for people to notice it in. This sounds really

988
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,690
Speaker 1:  different. And I think in some places is Chris and I have

989
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:51,020
Speaker 1:  both experienced. It sounds really cool. And some places that just like,

990
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,830
Speaker 1:  yo Gary Rossington was late to the concert today and

991
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:58,820
Speaker 1:  he just soloing his way up to the stage. And in some

992
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,390
Speaker 1:  places it sounds I've, I've seen this on Twitter a few times now, like you're

993
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:06,320
Speaker 1:  pushing the hall button or the concert button or the stadium button on

994
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,960
Speaker 1:  an old receiver, you know, and you're doing that kind of crazy DSP effect.

995
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,670
Speaker 1:  And you just like adding a bunch of echo and it's like, why did they build

996
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,390
Speaker 1:  these features? Like who, if you are out there and your primary listing

997
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:21,110
Speaker 1:  mode is like, stadium, I just want, I want to know who you

998
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,880
Speaker 1:  are. Like, I'm so curious, like, let's hang

999
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,690
Speaker 1:  out, I'll buy you a beer. We can listen to some echo-y

1000
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:32,500
Speaker 1:  music at your house together. But like, it does feel like one of those

1001
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,340
Speaker 1:  gigantic permanent DSP effects. And I think maybe the industry

1002
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,120
Speaker 1:  has to like catch up to it. But it's also fascinating to me that

1003
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,110
Speaker 1:  apple is like really grabbed it. It's a Marvin Gaye song. Right. It's like

1004
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,650
Speaker 1:  their big demo was Zane Lowe. Yeah. In one of the playlist.

1005
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,930
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They're like, here's the mono version. Here's the stereo version. Now

1006
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,470
Speaker 5:  here's spatial audio

1007
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,700
Speaker 1:  And it's cool demo in Zillow is very exciting. Like he's

1008
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,540
Speaker 1:  just with Zane, Lowe's excited. You're on that rollercoaster was though,

1009
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,050
Speaker 1:  like he's a compelling figure. It is also the

1010
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,040
Speaker 1:  exact same demo that Adobe does on its website with a less exciting person.

1011
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,860
Speaker 1:  Right? Like this is happening somewhere else in the industry and apple is

1012
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,430
Speaker 1:  just sort of grabbing it. So we'll see. I told you, we get on one spatial

1013
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,490
Speaker 1:  audio for an hour. Deidre. Do you want to do iPad multitasking for the next

1014
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,380
Speaker 1:  hour? I do.

1015
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:20,310
Speaker 2:  You actually, I want to, I want to think about that a long time. I

1016
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,880
Speaker 2:  want to talk about Monterey before we get there. So here's, what's new in

1017
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,870
Speaker 2:  Monterrey, all the stuff that we talked about for the iPhone. So

1018
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:31,380
Speaker 2:  FaceTime stuff, the share stuff and

1019
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,920
Speaker 2:  FaceTime. Oh, by the way, whenever anybody sends you a link to

1020
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,880
Speaker 2:  anything. Now, if it exists in an apple service, apples, all of

1021
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,840
Speaker 2:  Apple's news and video and whatever services will not have an extra tab saying,

1022
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,680
Speaker 2:  here's stuff that people shared with you. This is the social update to

1023
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,550
Speaker 2:  iMessage. I don't, I don't think that's going to work, but

1024
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,790
Speaker 2:  it's there. They have focus

1025
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,300
Speaker 2:  mode. They have the new quick notes thing, all that

1026
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,080
Speaker 2:  stuff. And then the coolest demo is universal control. Oh

1027
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,530
Speaker 2:  yeah. And there's a bunch of other stuff you can airplay to a Mac

1028
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:08,310
Speaker 2:  now, but don't try and use it as a monitor. Cause airplay is not that good.

1029
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,610
Speaker 2:  I could talk about shortcuts for a long time, but like universal control

1030
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:15,600
Speaker 2:  is you start it from a Mac and then you slide your mouse over

1031
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,020
Speaker 2:  to the left or right. Edge of the screen. And when you do that, the Mac has,

1032
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,080
Speaker 2:  like I mentioned, there's an iPad over there. And then it tries to put the

1033
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,230
Speaker 2:  cursor onto the iPad and then you keep sliding and then it gets accepted

1034
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,620
Speaker 2:  by the iPad. And now your cursor's on an iPad and your keyboard and mouse

1035
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,770
Speaker 2:  in your Mac control the iPad. And then once you've made that

1036
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:35,130
Speaker 2:  connection, you know, they're just together. You can actually use the iPads,

1037
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:38,130
Speaker 2:  keyboard and mouse to control your Mac. If you want. It just becomes like

1038
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:42,030
Speaker 2:  a mouse that you can move around with any of the attached,

1039
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,930
Speaker 2:  you know, mice controllers and whatever, where, whatever screen the mouse

1040
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:49,320
Speaker 2:  is on. It's controlling that screen and your keyboard works on that

1041
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,310
Speaker 2:  screen. It's a very cool demo. And I made a

1042
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:56,580
Speaker 2:  video about it based on basically technologies that Apple's had for like

1043
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,640
Speaker 2:  three or four years. They just finally like put them together in the right

1044
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,660
Speaker 2:  way. I love

1045
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,990
Speaker 1:  The fact that they're just sort of assuming that if you add a third screen,

1046
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:07,110
Speaker 1:  it's on the other side, like yeah. You know that they tried to whiteboard

1047
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,900
Speaker 1:  some extremely complicated technical

1048
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,230
Speaker 1:  solution. And then the one person in the back of the room was like, well,

1049
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,490
Speaker 1:  there's already one on the right. Isn't it probably just on the left. Yeah.

1050
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,020
Speaker 1:  And that was just like the end of that conversation.

1051
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,550
Speaker 2:  Here's the question for Vergecast everywhere. If you are one of the

1052
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,180
Speaker 2:  people and I, I respect you, I believe

1053
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,630
Speaker 2:  in your right to make this choice. Even though I

1054
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:33,560
Speaker 2:  fundamentally disagree with it, having tried it myself for many years. But

1055
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,460
Speaker 2:  what if you are one of these people that puts your dock on a left to right

1056
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,450
Speaker 2:  at the screen? Ooh, what happens then? Ooh,

1057
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:44,230
Speaker 3:  You're still around. I didn't know. They existed still. Oh yeah.

1058
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:48,130
Speaker 3:  Don't don't I, again, I think I used to do it when I had, when I

1059
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:52,090
Speaker 3:  had two monitors when I just had like two monitors. That, that was

1060
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,570
Speaker 3:  that it made sense then. Cause you would put it on one monitor to one

1061
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,380
Speaker 3:  side and you'd be like, this is my big boy monitor. This is my, my main

1062
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,290
Speaker 3:  monitor. And then there'd be the other monitor. And that's just where you

1063
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:04,420
Speaker 3:  played all the anime that you got off, like bit tore

1064
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,480
Speaker 3:  it. If, if you're

1065
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,170
Speaker 2:  A, if you're a doc on the side user Alex's Twitter account is Alex H

1066
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:14,200
Speaker 2:  Kranz and you should let her know.

1067
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,650
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Just, just let me ask, what anime are you watching and

1068
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:21,310
Speaker 3:  what like site did you use?

1069
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:25,060
Speaker 1:  Amazing. I used to be a doc on the side person. Then I got a

1070
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,060
Speaker 1:  bigger laptop.

1071
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,940
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. You get a bigger screen. You get like, like the last time I

1072
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:34,390
Speaker 3:  did it, I think we all, we were still in like full screen mode. You know,

1073
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,330
Speaker 3:  we were still doing that, like the, the little terrible squares. And so I'm

1074
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:41,860
Speaker 3:  like, cool. I guess there are people still using those, I guess. It's it

1075
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:45,850
Speaker 3:  makes sense. But I do, I am really like curious. Who's still doing

1076
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:49,720
Speaker 3:  it now. Cause it just, oh, we're going to hear from, yeah, I like

1077
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,900
Speaker 3:  my DMS. I should probably close them

1078
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,780
Speaker 1:  Where it's going to be like a 500 to one ratio of people who

1079
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,960
Speaker 1:  have the dock on the side to people who listen to everything in stadium

1080
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,120
Speaker 1:  mode. That's my current feedback ratio.

1081
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,300
Speaker 1:  Guests

1082
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,110
Speaker 2:  Shortcuts is going to sync between iPad and Mac

1083
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:11,890
Speaker 2:  and iPhone, which means that all the shortcuts you've set up on your iPhone

1084
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:15,040
Speaker 2:  will appear on your Mac. And then if you try and run them, they'll just air

1085
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,860
Speaker 2:  out if they don't work because they don't have the appropriate

1086
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,670
Speaker 2:  app, they're keeping automator around. But the future is

1087
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:25,630
Speaker 2:  shortcuts. So who knows how long automator is going to stick around?

1088
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,620
Speaker 2:  Hopefully a while. Probably awhile. A multi-year process.

1089
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:33,370
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited for circuits on the Mac. I I'm, I'm excited for apple

1090
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:36,400
Speaker 2:  to actually actively develop some sort of automation system on the Mac instead

1091
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,670
Speaker 2:  of, you know, ignore it, which is what they did with automater for the past

1092
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:41,770
Speaker 2:  five years. So that'd be good. Yeah.

1093
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:45,130
Speaker 1:  I think what's, I've seen people do amazing things with shortcuts on the

1094
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:49,030
Speaker 1:  iPhone. I think I am sort of excited about the idea that

1095
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:52,840
Speaker 1:  apple is committed to an automation platform that works across devices because

1096
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,320
Speaker 1:  that means they might commit to it working in home kit

1097
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,130
Speaker 1:  better. Because right now that is a mess. Yes,

1098
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:03,970
Speaker 1:  please do it apple. So this is just like a baby step

1099
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,960
Speaker 1:  towards acknowledging that sometimes you just want shortcuts in your

1100
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,860
Speaker 1:  house and then maybe they should run on a home kit hub. And that should

1101
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:15,790
Speaker 1:  not explode in your face every time. Try to do it. That would be very cool.

1102
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:19,440
Speaker 1:  Also being able to edit that stuff, those kinds of short cuts on a Mac

1103
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,310
Speaker 1:  way easier than doing it on a phone or iPad. So for sure, I

1104
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:27,180
Speaker 1:  do think that's pretty exciting. Okay. Let's take a break and then

1105
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,690
Speaker 1:  we can talk about this iPad situation. How's that feel

1106
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,300
Speaker 1:  great. We're going to take a break. Dieter is going to emotionally prepare

1107
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,170
Speaker 1:  himself. We'll be right

1108
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:38,060

Speaker ?:  one.

1146
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:52,820
Speaker 1:  Okay. We're back Dieter. Here's

1147
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:56,750
Speaker 1:  wait before it, before we get all emo, one way to think about the iPad.

1148
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:00,560
Speaker 1:  Multitasking reboot is that you won. Yeah. Have you

1149
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:04,100
Speaker 1:  thought about considering this as a victory? Yes I

1150
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,370
Speaker 1:  have. Okay. Gotta go. It's a Pyrrhic

1151
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:11,030
Speaker 1:  victory.

1152
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:14,900
Speaker 2:  So two years ago, when they first unveiled the new way

1153
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,640
Speaker 2:  to move windows around on the iPad, I made a video

1154
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,300
Speaker 2:  suggesting that it was not discoverable or

1155
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,930
Speaker 2:  intuitive, that it's very powerful once you learn it, but you have to

1156
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:29,830
Speaker 2:  watch a bunch of how to videos in order to figure it out. And then

1157
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:33,520
Speaker 2:  once you do, it's great. And two years later, apple like, yep,

1158
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,390
Speaker 2:  that that is true. And so they kept everything basically the

1159
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:41,380
Speaker 2:  same, but they added hamburger menus to the top

1160
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,250
Speaker 2:  of every single window on an iPad that you can now tap to

1161
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:48,720
Speaker 2:  bring up little window options to either move it left

1162
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,030
Speaker 2:  screen on left or right. Or turn it into a slide over or

1163
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,810
Speaker 2:  whatever. That's fine. It's great. People will find it that way more

1164
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:59,530
Speaker 2:  easily. I just can't help point out that this is the system that

1165
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:03,520
Speaker 2:  Samsung has used for years.

1166
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,150
Speaker 1:  Like

1167
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,330
Speaker 2:  If you've, if you've given up and copied Samsung's windowing

1168
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:11,110
Speaker 2:  system, you definitely failed. You've definitely

1169
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:13,000
Speaker 2:  given up. Yeah.

1170
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,370
Speaker 1:  There's only so many ways for them to go though. Right?

1171
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:19,120
Speaker 2:  Well, here's, here's a way windows. Just, just, just let

1172
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,810
Speaker 2:  me, let me, let me just like pop it out. You can have a, like a

1173
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:26,740
Speaker 2:  floating window for certain things inside certain apps,

1174
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:30,550
Speaker 2:  but it floats over the app itself.

1175
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,790
Speaker 2:  It's like, you can, it only exists in like,

1176
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:37,270
Speaker 2:  like three or four different modes and there's a new center mode for a window

1177
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:41,110
Speaker 2:  to existed. So that's fine. I feel bad that they had to

1178
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,770
Speaker 2:  like make a button that you can see in tap, but I make sense. I get

1179
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:48,130
Speaker 2:  it. I accept it in my heart. The thing that drives me batty is the

1180
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,280
Speaker 2:  shelf. So apps on the iPad can have multiple

1181
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,270
Speaker 2:  windows. And before, if you wanted to get to one of

1182
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:58,270
Speaker 2:  them, you have to open the app. You wouldn't know which window would open.

1183
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:00,670
Speaker 2:  It would be the last word you use, but maybe you remembered. And then you'd

1184
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,160
Speaker 2:  have like long press on the icon on the dock. And then it would show all

1185
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,250
Speaker 2:  the windows and then you'd pick another window and you'd go. Now what they've

1186
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:10,090
Speaker 2:  done is as soon as you open the app, it shows the shelf, which has

1187
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:14,020
Speaker 2:  all of the open windows for that app. Now this is an app

1188
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,920
Speaker 2:  by app thing. So the shelf only exists for windows

1189
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,790
Speaker 2:  from a certain app. And it only shows up inside that app, unless

1190
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:25,000
Speaker 2:  you're in split-screen, then the shelf will show the windows from the two

1191
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,900
Speaker 2:  apps that are in split-screen wait. Yes. See exactly

1192
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,830
Speaker 2:  that. I just, I just explained it as succinctly and clearly as possible to

1193
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:35,770
Speaker 2:  explain it. And all of you were just like, wait.

1194
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:39,750
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Well, where they took away was a bunch of hidden UI, right?

1195
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,470
Speaker 1:  They just like made a bunch of UI visible, a bunch of windowing

1196
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:47,130
Speaker 1:  controls. Basically they have made

1197
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:50,490
Speaker 1:  it, I think a little bit easier for this multi window

1198
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:53,910
Speaker 1:  situation. Although the, one of the things

1199
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:56,640
Speaker 1:  that I was just like, I've never really been able to share an iPad. Maybe

1200
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,450
Speaker 1:  this will make it simpler is like, I don't know which apps support multiple

1201
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:01,670
Speaker 1:  windows going. That's

1202
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:05,370
Speaker 2:  I got that. Yeah. You know, you just got a long press on some stuff in the

1203
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:08,550
Speaker 2:  app and see what happens. That's how you, that's how you pop out a new window

1204
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:12,510
Speaker 2:  from an app. You long press or LA or dragon something. And you just

1205
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,530
Speaker 2:  see like you just grab a safari tab and you just go.

1206
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:19,310
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So I can do make sense. Like safari is like, has like windows,

1207
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,310
Speaker 1:  like that has always made sense to me the other apps. And like, I don't even

1208
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:25,940
Speaker 1:  know. I'm not going to try. What if I'm disappointed? I don't wish to be

1209
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,540
Speaker 1:  disappointed today. Yeah. But like that's like that, that turn you're describing

1210
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:33,230
Speaker 1:  where like, and then you enter a split screen mode and these behaviors start

1211
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:36,230
Speaker 1:  to change. That's the one where I don't think they added any more

1212
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:39,460
Speaker 1:  visible UI to like guide you through it.

1213
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:43,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah. No, it's, it's tough to figure out how that works. And

1214
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,080
Speaker 2:  it's a real pro user thing. And I think that popping open multiple windows

1215
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,890
Speaker 2:  from a single app on an iPad is genuinely a pro user thing. And

1216
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:54,790
Speaker 2:  so I am basically okay with it being a little bit complicated

1217
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:58,750
Speaker 2:  or hidden in some ways, because I mean, it's

1218
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:02,260
Speaker 2:  so rare that anyone actually uses that stuff that it's fine. Like the people

1219
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,780
Speaker 2:  that know that, that know it and need it. They can grab it. I've

1220
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:08,530
Speaker 3:  Only ever used it on accident. I have opened do windows on

1221
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:12,220
Speaker 3:  safaris so many times. And then I'm like, I just want you to go. I don't,

1222
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:16,210
Speaker 3:  I don't want you here. And like, when you were telling us how to get to

1223
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:20,050
Speaker 3:  the shelf, I was taking notes so that I can actually go close some

1224
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:23,980
Speaker 3:  windows on my iPad after this. I

1225
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,720
Speaker 3:  had no idea. One

1226
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,410
Speaker 1:  Thing I would really like, and I don't think they've added, this

1227
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:33,340
Speaker 1:  is like presets presets once upon a time when

1228
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,030
Speaker 1:  I would like, go on airplanes, remember those

1229
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:40,690
Speaker 1:  iPads are great on airplanes. Did they use a lot of power loss on that? And

1230
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:44,650
Speaker 1:  like, I'd be like, okay, here's what I want right now. I want slack. I want

1231
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:48,610
Speaker 1:  a safari window. And I want messages. Right. And like having

1232
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:52,270
Speaker 1:  to configure that every time always just seemed bonkers to me. Like, yeah,

1233
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:55,360
Speaker 1:  let that just be a button I can push. It's like, here's this app layout I

1234
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,690
Speaker 1:  want, that's gonna make me like, productive, like right

1235
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,810
Speaker 1:  away. And I don't think they've solved that problem. In some ways it actually

1236
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:05,140
Speaker 1:  made it more complicated because I have all these like, like split-screen

1237
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:09,100
Speaker 1:  app instances all over the place. Let's see, I'm willing to give it a shot.

1238
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,440
Speaker 1:  But like, that's actually, the thing I want is like, here are the three things

1239
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,210
Speaker 1:  I want to use. Just let me use them. Couldn't you do a shortcut, I guess,

1240
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:18,250
Speaker 1:  to find out, can you do a shortcut that moves windows around

1241
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:22,180
Speaker 2:  And I've had that. I don't know. I haven't tried that yet. I'm sure.

1242
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,510
Speaker 2:  Frederico. The TICI would be a failure answer to that

1243
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:26,650
Speaker 2:  question. Someone

1244
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:30,340
Speaker 1:  Should start like a shortcut consultancy. Yeah.

1245
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:33,790
Speaker 2:  That's actually a really good idea. I didn't pay, but I'd go to them. Yeah.

1246
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,410
Speaker 2:  So

1247
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,180
Speaker 1:  You're just like, wait outside the door

1248
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:40,150
Speaker 3:  Please. Yeah. And tried to get some, some help from them when they're

1249
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:42,430
Speaker 3:  leaving. Yeah. I saved

1250
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:45,760
Speaker 2:  By other emotion for the iPad section, even though it could have gone to

1251
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,700
Speaker 2:  the Monterey section, what the hell have they done to

1252
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:52,510
Speaker 2:  safari? I think it looks cute. So

1253
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:54,820
Speaker 2:  what they, if you don't know what they've done is they've introduced tab

1254
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:58,750
Speaker 2:  groups on the left, which is great. And then they have taken the entire toolbar

1255
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:02,620
Speaker 2:  and collapsed it into a single line. So on the

1256
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:04,810
Speaker 2:  iPhone, it's at the bottom and you have to hit extra buttons to get to share.

1257
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:08,650
Speaker 2:  That's fine on the iPad and on the Mac, all the tabs

1258
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:12,640
Speaker 2:  are at the top and the URL bar has been integrated into the

1259
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,200
Speaker 2:  tab. And so if you want to go click on the URL

1260
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,560
Speaker 2:  bar, you have to find where it is on the left or the

1261
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,100
Speaker 2:  right. The tabs are also floating and they're not actually attached to the

1262
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,370
Speaker 2:  page. That's open anymore. They're just sort of up there in a different

1263
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:30,330
Speaker 2:  color. And so if you're on like fourth tab

1264
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,600
Speaker 2:  from the right and you want to go to the URL, you either gotta remember the

1265
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,470
Speaker 2:  keyboard shortcut. Or if you'd go up to click, you gotta like, I don't

1266
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:40,500
Speaker 2:  know, like, no, it's the fourth tab from the right or happy to see a suddenly

1267
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,230
Speaker 2:  different color. Cause that's the only visual indication that that is the

1268
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:46,980
Speaker 2:  tab URL that you're on. And then on top of all of that,

1269
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,010
Speaker 2:  because the URL has been integrated into the tabs

1270
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:53,940
Speaker 2:  themselves, the ability for you to like do stuff with

1271
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,810
Speaker 2:  the URL has diminished even further. I fundamentally

1272
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:01,230
Speaker 2:  believe that apple hates URLs and does not want anybody to ever see them.

1273
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:04,500
Speaker 2:  And it is trying to get there as quickly as it can, but it doesn't want anybody

1274
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,340
Speaker 2:  to like notice. So it's just doing it in baby steps

1275
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,820
Speaker 1:  Did that. But the entire web, just trying to

1276
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:13,160
Speaker 3:  AOL the entire internet.

1277
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:17,150
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I, the, the part where the tab, so really

1278
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:21,140
Speaker 1:  what's the rule fits his rule fits his law fits law. Yeah. Right. We're

1279
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,860
Speaker 1:  like fixed points on the screen are the easiest to get to and like require

1280
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,130
Speaker 1:  the least cognitive load. The Wikipedia.

1281
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:30,590
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's it's the edges of the screen that's fits law, but I get where

1282
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:32,600
Speaker 2:  you're going. Yeah. Right.

1283
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:36,530
Speaker 1:  So like right now in Chrome or even the current version of safari, the

1284
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:40,460
Speaker 1:  top of your browser is like pretty fixed in space. Like things aren't

1285
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:44,450
Speaker 1:  moving around so much. And so like, you know where things are, you

1286
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:48,230
Speaker 1:  know, where tabs are, whatever, and you have this kind of

1287
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:52,010
Speaker 1:  like spatial relationship to them. And then the guitarists from Leonard Skinner

1288
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:55,850
Speaker 1:  and sneaks up the browser, the new version of safari,

1289
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:58,940
Speaker 1:  all that stuff is always moving. So when you switch a

1290
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:02,840
Speaker 1:  tab, like the address bar opens up and all of the other tabs

1291
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,800
Speaker 1:  like scoot over. So you have, you don't have this like fixed

1292
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,670
Speaker 1:  like physical reference to where your things are. And I just

1293
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:14,540
Speaker 1:  don't know like, apple is better at UI design than most

1294
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:18,440
Speaker 1:  companies, most of the time. And this one feels like they,

1295
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,400
Speaker 1:  they missed the basics of just let people know where things are

1296
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,780
Speaker 1:  in a predictable way. Right.

1297
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:27,470
Speaker 3:  Can you imagine trying to walk someone who doesn't use their computer a

1298
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:30,710
Speaker 3:  lot through opening multiple tabs now and

1299
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:34,640
Speaker 3:  like jumping between them? Can you imagine, like, I, I'm

1300
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,540
Speaker 3:  just not going to take phone support calls from family members for a

1301
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:42,230
Speaker 3:  while after this happens. Cause it's just going to be brutal. I think people

1302
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:45,260
Speaker 3:  are going to get lost, but I also think it's, I still think it's

1303
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:49,190
Speaker 3:  cute. It does look nice. It looks really nice.

1304
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:52,070
Speaker 1:  And like the, you know, they're doing some sinking stuff. They are part of

1305
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:55,580
Speaker 1:  a, a new industry-wide consortium with Google and Microsoft and

1306
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,570
Speaker 1:  others Missoula to do standardized web extensions, which I think

1307
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,880
Speaker 1:  is really cool and like a big move for apple.

1308
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,910
Speaker 2:  It's very good that apple did this. Let's not give apple credit for it in

1309
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:08,870
Speaker 2:  the way that like they like, oh matter like apple, everyone's basically

1310
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:12,190
Speaker 2:  adopting some HomeKit standards for the low-level for smart home stuff. That's

1311
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,150
Speaker 2:  like an apple driven thing because they had to fix home kit, apple

1312
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:19,600
Speaker 2:  adopting web extensions for safari is like, oh, everyone else is doing this.

1313
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,990
Speaker 2:  And no one's making stuff for our stuff anymore. We should probably get on

1314
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:24,330
Speaker 2:  board finally.

1315
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:28,260
Speaker 1:  No, I just think like, we'll see. It's it's another one of

1316
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,040
Speaker 1:  those. I don't know that like really basic

1317
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,550
Speaker 1:  computer users even use tabs or another exist or care about tab

1318
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:39,400
Speaker 1:  groups. Right. And then like, yeah, we are, we exist in a

1319
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,230
Speaker 1:  community, a very online people who are like, I have 500 tabs open today.

1320
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:46,920
Speaker 1:  One of my favorite newsletters is literally called today in tabs. Like, yeah.

1321
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,920
Speaker 1:  There's just a huge yawning, chasm of

1322
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,790
Speaker 1:  expectations from computers here. So we'll

1323
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:57,660
Speaker 1:  see. I just, the fact that all the stuff is moving around seems like

1324
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:01,320
Speaker 1:  the it's the, that's the basics. Right? It's like leave the UI

1325
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,310
Speaker 1:  alone and then let the, the content change. Don't

1326
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:08,820
Speaker 1:  have the content just like completely move itself around all the time. Yeah.

1327
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,030
Speaker 1:  All right. That's the iPad. And that's also happening by the way on the Mac

1328
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:15,990
Speaker 1:  version of safari too. Whereas I think it's going to be even yet

1329
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:19,710
Speaker 1:  another reason for me to not use safari too often, you want to run

1330
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:23,490
Speaker 1:  through the watch real quick. It's like not a lot

1331
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:25,170
Speaker 1:  happening with the wall a lot.

1332
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:28,950
Speaker 2:  I like the most interesting watch stuff is actually not watch stuff. So you

1333
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:32,940
Speaker 2:  can share health data with trusted family members. And so you

1334
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:36,870
Speaker 2:  could theoretically set up your parents or your grandparents watch to like

1335
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:40,770
Speaker 2:  send you alerts when they have a fall or something else. There's a lot of

1336
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:44,460
Speaker 2:  privacy stuff related to that. They've added workout types for

1337
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:48,210
Speaker 2:  Tai-Chi and Pilates. Okay. They

1338
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,050
Speaker 2:  also on the watch, they have new photo stuff. So you can

1339
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:55,800
Speaker 2:  like browse through photos more nicely. And then there's a new photo watch

1340
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,790
Speaker 2:  face that like pops out the face and puts it over the clock.

1341
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:03,630
Speaker 2:  And it's like, zoom, you can scroll the digital crown to like make the face

1342
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:07,560
Speaker 2:  zoom. If that's the thing that you want to do. And then of

1343
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,130
Speaker 2:  course the most important feature that is only available in watch

1344
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,500
Speaker 2:  OOS and nowhere else is you can set multiple

1345
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:17,690
Speaker 2:  timers.

1346
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:20,460
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Oh my God. Finally,

1347
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:24,330
Speaker 2:  finally, but of course the iPhone, I don't think could do it just,

1348
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:28,230
Speaker 2:  just the watch. So once again, the clock app on the iPhone continues

1349
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:31,530
Speaker 2:  to be hot, garbage that apple refuses to touch and the clock up on the watch

1350
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:35,520
Speaker 2:  is good. Oh, we should also mention iPhone and watch are also getting

1351
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,390
Speaker 2:  a bunch of key stuff. BMW. Once again, promises that you'll be able to

1352
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:42,180
Speaker 2:  unlock your car with your phone six months in the future. It feels like that's

1353
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,510
Speaker 2:  been going on for a while now, but they're adding NFC keys. And

1354
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:48,570
Speaker 2:  so they've got, they've got, I think they've got slake

1355
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:52,500
Speaker 2:  and another like Yale on board and a Hyatt

1356
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,980
Speaker 2:  to riot. There'll be a bunch of hotels as well. So

1357
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:57,930
Speaker 1:  Hotels, office buildings, all that stuff.

1358
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:01,770
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's we're long overdue for just, just use NFC

1359
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:05,670
Speaker 2:  all. It's fine. And yeah. So hopefully that gets out there really

1360
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:06,450
Speaker 2:  fast.

1361
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:09,830
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We have not really talked about the, the ID card

1362
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:13,610
Speaker 1:  thing. I'm just going to, I'm going to say this very directly. If I'm

1363
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:17,510
Speaker 1:  pulled over and the cop wants my driver's license. Yeah. The chance that

1364
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:21,470
Speaker 1:  I am going to hand them, my smartphone is zero and it should

1365
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,980
Speaker 1:  be zero for you to get, right. Like that is

1366
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,910
Speaker 1:  just, it's just not acceptable. And so like maybe there's

1367
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:32,900
Speaker 1:  going to be this huge infrastructure of, I don't know, police

1368
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:36,440
Speaker 1:  technology that lets you like beep a smartphone to get your ID off it. And

1369
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,310
Speaker 1:  onto there, like maybe that will exist. You tap their phone.

1370
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:43,580
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I don't, it's not that doesn't seem

1371
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:47,360
Speaker 1:  likely also these phones unlock with your

1372
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,290
Speaker 1:  face. So even if you hand them a phone that's locked in, like

1373
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:54,980
Speaker 1:  in that ID mode, their opportunity to unlock,

1374
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:58,970
Speaker 1:  it just requires a clear view of your face and they're

1375
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:02,930
Speaker 1:  the police. And they can definitely get you to give you a clear view of

1376
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:05,930
Speaker 1:  your face. So like, I just, this is one of those features

1377
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:09,410
Speaker 1:  where the tech industry is just moving down the track, right? They want to

1378
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:13,070
Speaker 1:  replace your wallet, all the cards in it. I get it. I

1379
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:16,940
Speaker 1:  understand there's a bunch of state by state level initiatives to

1380
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:20,720
Speaker 1:  do this work. Completely understand it. But down here on the ground, it's

1381
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,590
Speaker 1:  like, I am never ever going to use this feature.

1382
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:27,920
Speaker 1:  I will always want a piece of plastic that I can handle a police officer

1383
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,520
Speaker 1:  or a TSA agent or something because my life is on my smartphone. And I am

1384
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,270
Speaker 1:  not handing that over. Like, there's a nice, like that little fourth

1385
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:39,230
Speaker 1:  amendment vignette in 99 problems is like just in my head all of the

1386
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:42,860
Speaker 1:  time. Right? So you're just not going to legally search my shit.

1387
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:45,770
Speaker 1:  Like that's it. That's like, that's where your head should be at all the

1388
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:49,610
Speaker 1:  time. And your phone is like the gateway to illegally searching you.

1389
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:53,300
Speaker 1:  So I don't know. I don't want to be on too much of horse. I'm certain we're

1390
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,510
Speaker 1:  going to hear a lot about this. The chances of me ever using this feature

1391
01:18:56,510 --> 01:19:00,260
Speaker 1:  are zero. And it's a very high bar to get me off a

1392
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:03,950
Speaker 1:  zero. Yep. Okay. See, we needed to end with a

1393
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:07,910
Speaker 1:  lecture. It's not just web standards all the time here on

1394
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:11,480
Speaker 1:  the verge has sometimes there's stride and lectures about privacy. There

1395
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:15,320
Speaker 1:  is a bunch of other news. We should just mention it very quickly, Microsoft

1396
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,250
Speaker 1:  today and now inst X-Box TV app. Actually Phil Spencer

1397
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:22,970
Speaker 1:  was on decoder and he hinted at this stuff pretty clearly a few months

1398
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:26,930
Speaker 1:  ago. So X thought has come basically going everywhere. So they're

1399
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:30,770
Speaker 1:  going to do apps for smart TVs, at least stream X-Box games.

1400
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:34,550
Speaker 1:  They're going to make their own streaming stick, which seems

1401
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:38,480
Speaker 1:  dangerous. See like, well, why is that dangerous? What operating

1402
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,630
Speaker 1:  systems that stricken around, right? It's going to be Android. It's going

1403
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:44,540
Speaker 1:  to be Andrew. It's like, they're going to make a weird fire TV that runs

1404
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:46,660
Speaker 1:  X cloud. Yeah, of course they are. Yeah. It's

1405
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:49,690
Speaker 3:  It's going to be your little like $50

1406
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,850
Speaker 3:  X-Box on a stick. What's

1407
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:54,160
Speaker 2:  Dangerous about this. This is great. I love

1408
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,140
Speaker 2:  it.

1409
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:59,320
Speaker 1:  Like these devices are Chris reviews. A lot of

1410
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,250
Speaker 1:  them, little tiny, cheap streaming devices are harder

1411
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:06,900
Speaker 1:  to execute than you think Microsoft we're making yet.

1412
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,860
Speaker 1:  Another fork of Android is like, what are we doing? Or

1413
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,930
Speaker 1:  they're going to do an official, like, they're going to do like a Chrome

1414
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:16,830
Speaker 1:  cast one, which is less dangerous, but like, or they're gonna,

1415
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:20,370
Speaker 1:  it's going to run windows, which would be incredible if Microsoft went to

1416
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,540
Speaker 1:  like Disney and Netflix and it's like, we need to make a window

1417
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:24,800
Speaker 1:  streaming,

1418
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,770
Speaker 2:  But you used to be able to buy a windows, computer and a stick like Intel

1419
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:30,770
Speaker 2:  soul to Knuck. That was literally a stick that you could stick in the back

1420
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:32,810
Speaker 2:  of a TV. Yeah. Back in the day,

1421
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:36,500
Speaker 1:  The marketing genius of calling that a Knuck

1422
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:40,450
Speaker 1:  anyway, really bold stuff for Microsoft. And it's the middle of eateries

1423
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:43,610
Speaker 1:  this weekend. So it was just like gaming announcements everywhere. Google

1424
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:47,120
Speaker 1:  is doing a deal with at and T to get stadia out in the world, which is

1425
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,060
Speaker 1:  sure. Ooh.

1426
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:52,310
Speaker 3:  When quippy did partnered with T mobile

1427
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:55,910
Speaker 2:  Or when, when H T and T partner with magic leap, like come

1428
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:56,750
Speaker 2:  on.

1429
01:20:56,750 --> 01:21:00,620
Speaker 1:  Yeah, no, that's great. When at and T does things, it always works out and

1430
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:04,370
Speaker 1:  no one ever loses their job. And it really builds up for Microsoft. This

1431
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:08,210
Speaker 1:  is what stadia like, this is what Google wanted to be first too. And they

1432
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:11,720
Speaker 1:  didn't execute well. And Microsoft is just showing up. And I think they're,

1433
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,120
Speaker 1:  I think they're this stuff is gonna be really compelling, especially the

1434
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,990
Speaker 1:  apps on TV, other TV platforms, Alex Heath, new

1435
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:21,620
Speaker 1:  Virginia reporter scoop machine scoop that

1436
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,440
Speaker 1:  Facebook is playing a smartwatch for next summer with two cameras and a heart

1437
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:28,430
Speaker 1:  rate monitor. One of the cameras appears to like, be like constantly

1438
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,050
Speaker 1:  taking. It's like very Facebook.

1439
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,600
Speaker 3:  You can like detach one of the cameras. Right?

1440
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,230
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Facebook's goal is to make a piece of hardware that is so compelling.

1441
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,920
Speaker 1:  You will not use your phone to get around apple. The Facebook,

1442
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,910
Speaker 1:  apple war is like building to a head.

1443
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:47,540
Speaker 1:  And so there's some, some of this hardware stuff, then there's like

1444
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:51,440
Speaker 1:  Facebook, it's going to start telling creators and Instagram and other

1445
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:55,370
Speaker 1:  platforms, how much apple is taking out of their digital services when they

1446
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:59,180
Speaker 1:  sell things like ticketed events and like they're gearing up.

1447
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,720
Speaker 1:  But I don't know about Facebook smartwatch. I dunno. I don't know,

1448
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:06,320
Speaker 1:  man. Chris, you reviewed the new Sony. Yeah.

1449
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,650
Speaker 5:  It's been a busy June for earbuds. Last week was the Google pixel buds day

1450
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:13,490
Speaker 5:  series, which were a nice set of $99. Earbuds, Sony just put

1451
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:16,150
Speaker 5:  out these WF thousand XM, 40

1452
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:20,030
Speaker 5:  earbuds. And they're much better than the first pair where

1453
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:22,700
Speaker 5:  these are now the best noise canceling earbuds you can get. So that's all

1454
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:26,660
Speaker 5:  you care about is music quality and a noise cancellation. This is, this

1455
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:30,410
Speaker 5:  is the one they cost $279. It's circle. They're not

1456
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:34,400
Speaker 5:  cheap, but they sound amazing. And, and the battery life is great.

1457
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,390
Speaker 5:  And hint, hint, we're not quite done with earbud news.

1458
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:41,660
Speaker 5:  So maybe check out the verge early next week and see what

1459
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,260
Speaker 5:  else I tell you. It's just ended there.

1460
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:48,680
Speaker 1:  I want to, but we think there's a falling pixel coming this year right

1461
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,370
Speaker 1:  here.

1462
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:53,090
Speaker 2:  I dunno about coming this year. The, the news is that the Samsung is

1463
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:56,690
Speaker 2:  like ramping up supply to provide to Google this year.

1464
01:22:56,690 --> 01:23:00,680
Speaker 2:  That to me suggests that it's more likely next year we

1465
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:04,460
Speaker 2:  know they're working on it. So that's true. Whether or not they're going

1466
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:08,320
Speaker 2:  to have guts or the ability to announce one

1467
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,190
Speaker 2:  this year, TBD also it's Google. And so it would have

1468
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:15,880
Speaker 2:  leaked for real, like a visible thing this year. Just, you know,

1469
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,780
Speaker 2:  like, but it's definitely coming. I just, I am iffy on

1470
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,840
Speaker 2:  whether or not they're actually gonna be able to announce it this year. And

1471
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,680
Speaker 1:  Then lastly, president Biden revoked the Trump ban on tech

1472
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,310
Speaker 1:  talk and we chat, which I have to pay attention. It never actually banned

1473
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:33,300
Speaker 1:  anything. It was like one of, one of the extreme,

1474
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,510
Speaker 1:  low lights of like pandemic year

1475
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:40,410
Speaker 1:  was the Trump rally. And then, you know, the tick-tock

1476
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:43,860
Speaker 1:  teens, a credit for making no one come to it, which by the way, has never

1477
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:47,760
Speaker 1:  like been conclusively proven or disproven. We all like a lot of people

1478
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,120
Speaker 1:  want to believe it's correct. Right? Like it's a great story. I think the

1479
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,750
Speaker 1:  people on Tik TOK want to believe they disrupted this route. We just, I'm

1480
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:58,170
Speaker 1:  just telling you it's there's the causal link has never really been conclusively

1481
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:01,950
Speaker 1:  proven. It feels right. And like, I'm not going to tell you how to feel.

1482
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:04,710
Speaker 1:  I'm just going to tell you that there's never been conclusive

1483
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:08,310
Speaker 1:  anyhow, but that spiraling into

1484
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:12,240
Speaker 1:  Trump potentially believing it. And then a bunch of China Hawks convincing

1485
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:16,230
Speaker 1:  Trump to ban Tik TOK and then takes out getting scared. And then

1486
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:20,160
Speaker 1:  Trump requesting a finder's fee for Microsoft because he was going to sell

1487
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:24,120
Speaker 1:  tech, talk to Microsoft, like, yeah,

1488
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,270
Speaker 1:  I'm saying this. It doesn't seem like it happened, but it

1489
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:30,930
Speaker 1:  absolutely happened. And we had to fucking take it seriously every

1490
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:34,770
Speaker 1:  day. And I just remember the look of pain. I'm like Russell and

1491
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:38,670
Speaker 1:  McKenna's face because every morning we'd wake up and like

1492
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:42,120
Speaker 1:  another random company would be in the mix to buy tick

1493
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:46,080
Speaker 1:  talk, remember? And then Julia was on the show every couple of weeks.

1494
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,710
Speaker 1:  And she'd be like another Disney executive is like been forced out and works

1495
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:53,700
Speaker 1:  for tick-tock now. But he quit anyway, Biden rescinded this order

1496
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,420
Speaker 1:  that never took any effect. Tik TOK was actually suing and kind of winning,

1497
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:01,290
Speaker 1:  but there's a new framework for evaluating how Chinese tech companies

1498
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:04,200
Speaker 1:  can work. United States. The byte administration does not want to seem soft

1499
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:08,160
Speaker 1:  on China, so that will continue. But I just was remembering how

1500
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:11,490
Speaker 1:  much I had to think about Tik TOK and Oracle at the same

1501
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:15,330
Speaker 3:  Time, Oracle. That was, that almost happened.

1502
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:19,080
Speaker 1:  We came maybe, maybe, but it's just like two great tastes that do not

1503
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,980
Speaker 1:  taste great together. Talking to Oracle, like what were

1504
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:26,130
Speaker 1:  you doing? Anyhow, all that needs on the

1505
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:30,060
Speaker 1:  site. As much as other WWC analysis on the site, a

1506
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,990
Speaker 1:  bunch of features we didn't have time to talk about in depth plus all kinds

1507
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:37,080
Speaker 1:  of other stuff. Also, if you're listening to this Friday, this one's out

1508
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:40,950
Speaker 1:  on Friday this morning, as you listened to this, Ashley Carmen has a feature

1509
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:44,250
Speaker 1:  that she's been working on for months about a podcasting hype

1510
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:47,910
Speaker 1:  house from the depths of hell. It is one of the

1511
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:51,600
Speaker 1:  wildest stories we've ever published. Like I read that. Okay. You can tweet

1516
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:09,230
Speaker 1:  tractors? Tractors

1517
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:13,130
Speaker 1:  are crazy. Some of the wildest tech you could ever think. Do you know? There's

1518
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:17,030
Speaker 1:  like, like Invidia GPU's and modern John Deere tractors that can identify

1519
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:20,960
Speaker 1:  individual plants it's oh, that's amazing. Okay. Yeah, it was a good

1520
