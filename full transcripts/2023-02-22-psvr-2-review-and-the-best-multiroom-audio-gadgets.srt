00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,200
Speaker 2:  Hello and welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,640
Speaker 2:  of not yet announced Sono Speakers. That's right. We've got a bunch of

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,320
Speaker 2:  stuff on the side about it. You should go read it. I'm your friend Alex Kranz

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,320
Speaker 2:  and I just realized I haven't used my Oculus Quest two in like

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,080
Speaker 2:  four months. I'm probably gonna blame the Steam deck for that lack of playing

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,320
Speaker 2:  time because Boulder Skate three is really, really good. But I also think

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,200
Speaker 2:  it's because I'm getting tired of that form of VR and all the the

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,120
Speaker 2:  Metaverse junk and I want something different, which is why I have selfishly

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,040
Speaker 2:  brought Addie and Sean onto the show to talk about the psvr too, because

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,960
Speaker 2:  it feels more like what I want, which is, you know, to play games in

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
Speaker 2:  vr. Also, to carry on that theme of things I want, the other thing we're

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,840
Speaker 2:  gonna be talking about on the show today is the state of Multiroom audio.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,880
Speaker 2:  It's not just Sonos anymore and I've got two Chrises and a gin

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,760
Speaker 2:  tui coming on to explain things. So stay tuned. Moore's coming up right after

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:55,960
Speaker 2:  this.

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,220
Speaker 2:  Okay, welcome back. Sony's new VR headset. It's out.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,380
Speaker 2:  The PSVR two is available right now, almost anywhere. I

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,020
Speaker 2:  think you can buy Sony game stuff and my good friends and yours, Addie

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,060
Speaker 2:  Robertson and Sean Hollister have been playing with this thing for a while.

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,940
Speaker 2:  So we sat down to talk with them about what's working, what's not working,

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,060
Speaker 2:  and why it's not backwards compatible with the games from the original

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,660
Speaker 2:  psvr. Let's go straight to the conversation because it is a lot of fun.

24
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,580
Speaker 2:  Okay, Addie, Sean, what's it like being back in the real world?

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,940
Speaker 3:  Very high fidelity,

26
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,140
Speaker 4:  Better field of view?

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:35,940
Speaker 4:  And

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,900
Speaker 2:  You, you guys were using the Sony PlayStation VR too, that's the

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,220
Speaker 2:  name, right?

30
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,340
Speaker 3:  Yeah, we've had it for over a week now. We had myself,

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,140
Speaker 3:  Addie and Tom Warren all got to spend lots of time in this thing

32
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,220
Speaker 3:  shooting bows and flailing around with our octopus tentacles. It was

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,980
Speaker 2:  Great. You guys had both used the original psvr too,

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,500
Speaker 2:  and I, I know that both of you used a lot of vr Addie, I think you've been

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,620
Speaker 2:  photographed with almost every VR headset the VER has ever used.

36
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,020
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think that's right.

37
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,820
Speaker 2:  So you guys did this awesome, awesome video. You did this great review about

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,540
Speaker 2:  the product and I was kind of surprised because I found

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,140
Speaker 2:  myself, even though I have a Quest two and I love my Quest two and I

40
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,060
Speaker 2:  occasionally use my Quest two for things like supernatural and games and

41
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,940
Speaker 2:  stuff. I kind of wanted this one. Can you explain to me why I suddenly want

42
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,900
Speaker 2:  this, even though you made it very clear, it is very expensive, it only

43
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,460
Speaker 2:  does games and there were a lot of drawbacks.

44
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,620
Speaker 3:  I think it's kind of this perfect middle point between

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,340
Speaker 3:  something like an Oculus quest and spending ridiculous

46
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,060
Speaker 3:  amounts of money on a Windows computer to get your thing running. Now if

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,660
Speaker 3:  you've already got a ridiculous Windows gaming computer, sure, maybe you

48
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,820
Speaker 3:  wanna take a look at the valve index, but even then, Addie, I think you were

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,660
Speaker 3:  telling me that you think that this is a better piece of

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,300
Speaker 3:  kit in many ways than like the highest N PC headsets we've seen. Right?

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,480
Speaker 4:  For one thing, the highest N PC headsets are like four years old now. Like

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,040
Speaker 4:  the FinTech came out in 2019. So just super

53
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,120
Speaker 4:  high res, like fancy panels were not as ubiquitous. Eye tracking was

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,920
Speaker 4:  not as common at this point. I, I don't know, it's partly the headset,

55
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,960
Speaker 4:  but it's also, it's just that it's easy. Like I've done so much PC v

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,360
Speaker 4:  r and so much steam vr, like fiddling around with settings and trying to

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,760
Speaker 4:  make sure that I have the right cables for the right things. And it is just

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,720
Speaker 4:  kind of a joy to be able to grab a single cable and plug it into

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,480
Speaker 4:  a thing and enter a code or buy a game and be like,

60
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,200
Speaker 4:  I understand that this is going to work.

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,520
Speaker 3:  I was blown away, blown away by the ease of use. Like even even with an Oculus

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,880
Speaker 3:  quest, you're like, okay, this is self-contained. It does everything. It's

63
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,400
Speaker 3:  this lightweight wireless headset that, you know, meta will sell me. Even

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
Speaker 3:  with the Quest, you still have to sign up for your account, log

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
Speaker 3:  into the thing, make sure it's charged up and has enough battery life.

66
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,560
Speaker 3:  And with this, it just you, you plug it into the front of the PS five, you

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,240
Speaker 3:  already own. There are no updates to download. It already happened

68
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,080
Speaker 3:  that it's completely compatible with the thing. You get these instructions

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,040
Speaker 3:  on your TV screen, how to put it on your head, make sure your controllers

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,920
Speaker 3:  are paired and then you're in. Yeah,

71
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,800
Speaker 2:  Like I think that was what kind of really was compelling to me. Listen, watching

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,360
Speaker 2:  the video, reading the review from you guys was that my quest,

73
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,080
Speaker 2:  if I don't use it for a couple of weeks and I go and I turn it on one,

74
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,640
Speaker 2:  will it have enough battery life or as my battery like discharged over

75
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,440
Speaker 3:  The last, the answer is no, it will, it will not.

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,960
Speaker 2:  It will not have enough battery. And then two, I will almost certainly have

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,920
Speaker 2:  to do at least like an update to the the OS and an update

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,360
Speaker 2:  to whatever game I want to play. And so what it should be like takes me two

79
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
Speaker 2:  minutes to get into the game. I'm now looking at 10 to 15

80
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,320
Speaker 2:  if the battery happens to be charged, if the battery doesn't have to be charged,

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,880
Speaker 2:  I'm looking at, I'm putting this away and going attempt it another day.

82
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,160
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And, and a properly set up PS five, we'll do all of that in the background.

83
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,880
Speaker 4:  I also just think that Meta has put so much emphasis on social lately

84
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,480
Speaker 4:  that like every time you try to get in at this point, if you're not using

85
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,400
Speaker 4:  it constantly, like they're just constantly trying to add new social stuff.

86
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,800
Speaker 4:  Like now you create a, you don't have to have a Facebook account, but you

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,560
Speaker 4:  need a meta account. You need to like make your avatar. Hello, would you

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,520
Speaker 4:  like to see things with your avatar? Would you like to be in social? No,

89
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
Speaker 4:  I, I wouldn't. I just wanna play games.

90
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And the vr, the killer app for VR

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,240
Speaker 2:  continues to be games and this thing is just games.

92
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,600
Speaker 3:  I don't know when it's not gonna be just games, but we haven't found

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,440
Speaker 3:  any metaverse experiences that are particularly compelling yet.

94
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,360
Speaker 3:  We've discussed this on previous podcasts, but games have have always been

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,280
Speaker 3:  this, you know, I want to be inside this world that I

96
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,920
Speaker 3:  already enjoyed with my 2D flat screen, you know? Yeah. And

97
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,640
Speaker 3:  this does that in a variety of ways. But

98
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,320
Speaker 3:  the game catalog, it was kind of the weak spot in our review too.

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,920
Speaker 3:  There are some really interesting experiences in here, but almost

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,280
Speaker 3:  everything for the headset is being poured from somewhere else.

101
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,360
Speaker 4:  I'm impressed by how little Sony cared about

102
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,920
Speaker 4:  whether we cared about its launch lineup. They gave us like three games

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,680
Speaker 4:  and then we got some codes from other like developers.

104
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,720
Speaker 4:  But we really, it's not just that the launch line was is sort of limited,

105
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,680
Speaker 4:  it's that we got access to just a tiny fraction of the launch line. The

106
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,640
Speaker 4:  game codes are like now rolling in

107
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,560
Speaker 3:  Like every morning, every morning at a Tom and I would be

108
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,520
Speaker 3:  in Slack, Fran frantically big. Like, are we gonna have any games today?

109
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,320
Speaker 3:  Are we actually going to know whether this PlayStation VR two headset

110
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,280
Speaker 3:  has enough games or we just going to have to say we get to try enough of

111
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,120
Speaker 3:  the games. And so the reality is there is one really

112
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,040
Speaker 3:  good interesting title that is maybe I, I think Eddie

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,960
Speaker 3:  said it's like 85% of a full game called Horizon Call of the

114
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,840
Speaker 3:  Mountain. And then there's a whole bunch of ports from other VR headsets,

115
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,720
Speaker 3:  decent, maybe even good ports like Star Wars Tales from the

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,640
Speaker 3:  Galaxy's Edge is definitely higher fidelity and smoother

117
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,120
Speaker 3:  on psvr two. Even though it's originally from

118
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,840
Speaker 3:  Oculus Quest, it was designed to run on a mobile headset. Not a lot of brand

119
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,520
Speaker 3:  new stuff. But then there's a handful of stuff that we haven't gotten to

120
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,400
Speaker 3:  try yet that we know players are gonna be very interested in. On

121
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,040
Speaker 3:  Launch day there will be an update to Grand Charisma seven that will let

122
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,720
Speaker 3:  you play almost the entire game in vr. There will be an update to Resident

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,120
Speaker 3:  Evil Village that will let you play at the entire game in vr. No thank you.

124
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
Speaker 3:  As well as one for No Man's Sky. And, and yeah, I don't know if we're gonna

125
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,240
Speaker 3:  love that, but as of today we can't tell you

126
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,280
Speaker 4:  Re an evil four in VR rule

127
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,040
Speaker 3:  Re Evil four, the Game Cube Game so good in vr,

128
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,760
Speaker 2:  But no Man Sky is coming to it. The Horizon zero

129
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,600
Speaker 2:  dawn kind of spinoff game seems to be gorgeous. Like

130
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,960
Speaker 2:  every, every piece of footage I've seen from it, I'm like, oh, that looks

131
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,640
Speaker 2:  like a regular game. Not a VR game, which tend to be like

132
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,760
Speaker 2:  flat, like kind of ugly most VR games.

133
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,520
Speaker 3:  Yeah, this is the first like AAA made for VR

134
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,480
Speaker 3:  game in a while. Like we talk about it in the same breadth as Halflife Alex.

135
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,040
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Which was the flagship title for the the Valve

136
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,600
Speaker 3:  index VR headset for PCs. And now you're getting that kind of PC

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,440
Speaker 3:  graphics without having to buy a pc because the PlayStation five is

138
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
Speaker 3:  basically a pc, right? It's, it's huge. It's powerful. It

139
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,640
Speaker 3:  does those things. But I don't think, we think it's

140
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,760
Speaker 3:  quite on the level of half-life, Alex, right?

141
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,880
Speaker 4:  I think that Alex was a game, Alex was a thing that they designed and they

142
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,680
Speaker 4:  were like, this will be challenging, this will be fully featured. This is

143
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,800
Speaker 4:  has a bunch of mechanics that we are willing to put into a thing that

144
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
Speaker 4:  maybe people will fail in. This just felt like a game where they were really

145
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,120
Speaker 4:  scared that people might have to restart a segment or something. And so there's

146
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,720
Speaker 4:  all these climbing sections that could be really amazing if they were like

147
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,640
Speaker 4:  the thing they are very clearly lifting from, which is crytech the climb.

148
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,520
Speaker 4:  But you just, you don't have any of the mechanics that make them hard.

149
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,320
Speaker 4:  And then there's combat. That's a bow and arrow combat that I really love,

150
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,240
Speaker 4:  I think is great, but you get it a couple times a level. It makes me

151
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,200
Speaker 4:  so mad cuz it's so good when it's good. But unlike Alex,

152
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,760
Speaker 4:  it just, it doesn't feel like they were willing to quite commit to be being

153
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,640
Speaker 4:  a game game instead of like a VR game.

154
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,520
Speaker 3:  I was really impressed by Horizon, I think probably because it set me up

155
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,480
Speaker 3:  to be disappointed. I started the game and I'm like, okay, I'm definitely

156
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,800
Speaker 3:  not Aloy and I'm sitting in this boat going on this awesome

157
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,400
Speaker 3:  dinosaur safari just going down this creek seeing all these

158
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,280
Speaker 3:  giant dinosaur robot things, step over me. It was great.

159
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,080
Speaker 3:  And then I'm like, okay, this is just me a Disneyland ride ride, right? And

160
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,840
Speaker 3:  then all of a sudden you can like walk and you can pull out a

161
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,800
Speaker 3:  bow and you can climb things and it feels very immersive

162
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,240
Speaker 3:  and everything looks beautiful and at some point you realize that all the

163
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,240
Speaker 3:  climbing and shooting is very easy and and like, like Eddie says, in her

164
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,720
Speaker 3:  review of the game, they've kind of sanded off all the edges because they're

165
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,560
Speaker 3:  scared and probably the same reason they're not letting you play as Aloy,

166
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,640
Speaker 3:  but it's very impressive. I do think that anybody who picks up this

167
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,280
Speaker 3:  headset should get the game. And so if anybody's reading this planning to

168
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,040
Speaker 3:  buy the headset, you should probably get the bundle that comes with the game

169
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,800
Speaker 3:  for $10 less then you would pay if you bought it separately. But it's not

170
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,520
Speaker 3:  quite like as much of a game as half-life Alex.

171
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,720
Speaker 2:  Okay. So this is one of our first headsets where we're getting eye tracking

172
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,160
Speaker 2:  and I think in climbing games oftentimes I get a little nauseous playing

173
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,120
Speaker 2:  those partly because it's not tracking my eyes usually, right? And so I'm

174
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,640
Speaker 2:  having to like crane my head and stuff. Do you have that? Like not a lot

175
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,920
Speaker 2:  of nausea with this game? Not a lot of moments where you're like, oh I don't

176
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,480
Speaker 2:  feel good. It felt pretty like the movements and stuff felt pretty real.

177
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,000
Speaker 3:  I get sick in VR if the VR is bad. I have,

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Speaker 3:  I have what's known as simulator sickness. Many people will get simulator

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Speaker 3:  sickness. It's just simply if I am being pointed in a

180
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,920
Speaker 3:  direction in the game that I have not turned to pointed in the real world,

181
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,800
Speaker 3:  I can get kind of sick cuz my vestibular system doesn't match up. There are

182
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,600
Speaker 3:  other kinds of ar sickness you can get as well. But this one, this game,

183
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,560
Speaker 3:  all of the walking, all of the climbing, all of the turning around,

184
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,840
Speaker 3:  I was able to do, I can turn with my real body, I can move my real head and

185
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,560
Speaker 3:  the directions that I wanna move and the game respects all that. It doesn't

186
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,000
Speaker 3:  force me to use joysticks to turn around or anything like that.

187
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,120
Speaker 3:  And so it was comfortable. The only exception was there were a few times

188
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,760
Speaker 3:  I would get into a part of the game where it takes control

189
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,640
Speaker 3:  from you because it wants to do a katini like thing. Like hey,

190
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,520
Speaker 3:  you are sneaking down into these bushes to ambush a robot dinosaur

191
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,880
Speaker 3:  and now you're going to point you in a certain direction. And I would

192
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
Speaker 3:  come outta that cut scene and I would suddenly not be facing the same way

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,960
Speaker 3:  that I thought I would be facing. And that's a little weird, but it didn't

194
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,640
Speaker 3:  happen often enough. I played multiple hours and didn't really get sick.

195
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,200
Speaker 4:  I tend to get sim sick and I was actually really surprised at how well the

196
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Speaker 4:  free motion worked. I usually end up doing teleportation just cause I find

197
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Speaker 4:  it more comfortable. But yeah, you do this sort of, you're swinging your

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,560
Speaker 4:  arms to move and you look very, very, very silly I imagine.

199
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,080
Speaker 4:  But it totally worked.

200
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,760
Speaker 2:  It does. So you're like swinging your arms in real life. It's

201
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,280
Speaker 3:  Hilarious. It looks hilarious.

202
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,480
Speaker 2:  I love it. Looks like you're both running in place.

203
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,680
Speaker 3:  No, I, I would, I would do this with old VR games too, like this. This is

204
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,920
Speaker 3:  a known technique that like VR developers and, and folks who

205
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,320
Speaker 3:  researchers have studied for a while, if you get your body moving, it helps

206
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,200
Speaker 3:  your vestibular system calm down or, or whatever. I'm totally butchering

207
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,080
Speaker 3:  the medical terminology anyhow. I would raise and lower my feet to

208
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,000
Speaker 3:  like fake walk when I was playing early VR games and it would

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,920
Speaker 3:  help me. And so it's cool to me to see that they have internalized

210
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,760
Speaker 3:  that and made that like the actual games intentional locomotion. I

211
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,120
Speaker 3:  like it.

212
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,120
Speaker 2:  It sounds like this is a very polished experience. And that was one of the

213
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,160
Speaker 2:  things, like you guys, I reviewed the, the psvr, the original one back in

214
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,120
Speaker 2:  the day. And one of the things I really liked about it was there was like

215
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,520
Speaker 2:  a good amount of games and it was clearly intended for the general masses,

216
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,760
Speaker 2:  not just for like us nerds who, who wanna be at the cutting

217
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,960
Speaker 2:  edge. And we were like, yeah, sometimes we'll feel like we wanna throw up

218
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,640
Speaker 2:  and that's fine because we're, we're at the cutting edge and most people

219
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,360
Speaker 2:  don't actually want to do that, which is shocking to me. And it sounds like

220
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
Speaker 2:  this is for those people,

221
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,920
Speaker 3:  A lot of the VR fair is very simple and many

222
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,760
Speaker 3:  of them, if not all of them, but definitely many of the ones we tried would

223
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,960
Speaker 3:  ask you at the beginning, do you want to be seated? Do you want to be standing?

224
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,760
Speaker 3:  One of the my favorite games so far in the system other than

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,560
Speaker 3:  Horizon is what the bat, which is a game where you

226
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,200
Speaker 3:  are a girl whose arms have been turned into baseball bats, but that doesn't

227
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
Speaker 3:  really matter. The plot doesn't matter. What matters is that you have baseball

228
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,640
Speaker 3:  bats and you have to do all kinds of in name tasks, like pick up

229
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,440
Speaker 3:  a piece of toast and drop it into a toaster or smack

230
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,440
Speaker 3:  baseballs into your neighbor's windows and break them. Yes, I got turned

231
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,400
Speaker 3:  into a tiny baby with, with bats for arms and I needed to splash my

232
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,960
Speaker 3:  rubber ducky out of the tub with my, with my bat hands. And you could do

233
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,440
Speaker 3:  all of that like pointed one direction without moving the rest of your body

234
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Speaker 3:  at all and just swinging your arms. And it is hilarious fun.

235
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,600
Speaker 4:  What did you call this genre? You called it the, the things for arms genre.

236
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,480
Speaker 4:  It's that tentacular,

237
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,240
Speaker 3:  There are a number of games it it VR historically that will be like, we're

238
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,840
Speaker 3:  just going to turn your arms into something else and you're gonna love it.

239
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,920
Speaker 3:  And it works very well that in the, the diorama genre where

240
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,960
Speaker 3:  it's like, yeah, you are going to be interacting with something that is very

241
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,680
Speaker 3:  miniature and cool looking like Moss where you,

242
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,400
Speaker 3:  where you're controlling this mouse that's running through the forest and

243
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,120
Speaker 3:  you can look up and there's these, you know, giant trees all around you.

244
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,240
Speaker 3:  But what you're looking at is the tiny nature scene unfolding beneath you

245
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Speaker 3:  in the bottom of the forest. So it's like this, you know, you're looking

246
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,120
Speaker 3:  into this little world. I like that kind of genre too.

247
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,360
Speaker 2:  The, those kind of games are meant to get around that locomotion problem

248
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,640
Speaker 2:  we were talking about, right? Like if you're looking down at the diorama,

249
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,600
Speaker 2:  that's just like how you would look down playing a board game or something

250
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,720
Speaker 2:  rather than being in the board game.

251
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it was one of the, the early games, like the first Rift games

252
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,480
Speaker 4:  did it, it was the remnant from the Ashes team. Kronos

253
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,440
Speaker 3:  Kronos. And there was, which Blade Wild Back was, was a great

254
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,400
Speaker 3:  side scrolling rift game that was like, everything is this, you know,

255
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,640
Speaker 3:  you're looking into this diorama. It was, it was a lot of fun. A bunch of

256
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,480
Speaker 3:  games like that exist for VR and, and Moss are the flagship

257
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,320
Speaker 3:  ones for the PlayStation VR two funny thing is that they are are

258
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,600
Speaker 3:  original PlayStation VR games that I believe you'll have to buy

259
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,560
Speaker 3:  again. In some cases a number of original VR PlayStation VR

260
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,000
Speaker 3:  games are coming back to the PlayStation VR two. But the PlayStation VR two

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,840
Speaker 3:  is not natively compatible with a P S VR titles. So their

262
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,760
Speaker 3:  developers have to remake remaster everything to use the different

263
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,720
Speaker 3:  controllers upscale to the graphics that are available with PSVR two,

264
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,560
Speaker 3:  all of that. So we are seeing a few games we'll have

265
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,320
Speaker 3:  you get the PS five copy for free with your old PS4 copy.

266
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,560
Speaker 3:  We're seeing somewhere like Thumper, which is a, a lovely

267
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,200
Speaker 3:  rhythm game.

268
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's one of those non VR games that's really great in

269
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,320
Speaker 3:  Vr. That one's a $5 upgrade. Res infinite is like a $10

270
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,360
Speaker 3:  upgrade if you want the PS five PSVR two version.

271
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,120
Speaker 4:  Sean, what's your take on why they didn't try to make any of it backwards

272
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,360
Speaker 4:  compatible? Because it's not like Sony hasn't done that. Like they've actually

273
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,880
Speaker 4:  historically been quite good at it. Often

274
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,760
Speaker 3:  I am a little bit torn here. Like I I kind of buy their

275
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,600
Speaker 3:  explanation, which is that, you know, the control system is totally

276
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,520
Speaker 3:  different in that like the original PlayStation vr, if you wanted to

277
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,320
Speaker 3:  do anything with it, you basically had to hook up a webcam, right?

278
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,560
Speaker 3:  You had to plug the PlayStation VR two camera, that camera was tracking your

279
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,480
Speaker 3:  head movements and your controller movements and, and Ken had to see

280
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,720
Speaker 3:  all these things and then it would translate that into movement. Whereas

281
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,960
Speaker 3:  this is inside out cameras and tracking where the headset is, the cameras.

282
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,400
Speaker 3:  And so it is telling the system where it is in

283
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,360
Speaker 3:  3D space by mapping the world routed and saying, okay, I moved this much

284
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
Speaker 3:  to the laughter, this much to the right. That's how much I turned, that's

285
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,360
Speaker 3:  how much I moved. So that's where I am. Okay.

286
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,920
Speaker 4:  But Oculus made that same transition between the Rift and the Rift and they

287
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,400
Speaker 4:  still maintain compatibility. They didn't, it was like never even a question

288
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,480
Speaker 4:  that they were gonna break all their games because they suddenly switched

289
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,720
Speaker 4:  from outside into inside out.

290
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,920
Speaker 3:  Right. And I would think that whatever game engines these are running

291
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,120
Speaker 3:  on, you could just feed whatever that real time position of your head is

292
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,360
Speaker 3:  and and just have the system correspond to that. I don't understand why not.

293
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,280
Speaker 3:  I guess some of these games are trying to like

294
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,760
Speaker 3:  have representations of your controllers in there. A few of them, but I,

295
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,520
Speaker 3:  I don't think that would be a big deal to swap out like iconography and

296
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,120
Speaker 3:  shit like that.

297
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,600
Speaker 4:  Honestly, my conspiracy theory, which is, is that they had a bunch of games

298
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,400
Speaker 4:  in their original catalog that were not particularly good because they were

299
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,280
Speaker 4:  techs, they were, this was like kind of just a flyer for them and that

300
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,600
Speaker 4:  they didn't want to have to deal with people going back to them. Could

301
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,400
Speaker 3:  Be, could be rights issues.

302
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,640
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It feels like we don't wanna have to pay to get all of these games

303
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,560
Speaker 2:  working on this new system and they weren't that good anyway. So we're not

304
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,680
Speaker 2:  gonna waste the time. But if you wanna do, if you wanna go and take your

305
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Speaker 2:  game and and redo it for our system, great. And if you want to charge people

306
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,200
Speaker 2:  because we're not gonna pay you more power to you, that feels

307
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,080
Speaker 2:  kind of like probably what the conversation was behind the scenes. Right.

308
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,800
Speaker 4:  It doesn't mean we're gonna lose the out the only from software VR game ever

309
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,960
Speaker 4:  made as far as I can tell.

310
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,120
Speaker 3:  Dere scene,

311
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,360
Speaker 4:  Yes, dere scene.

312
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,080
Speaker 3:  I'm hoping some developers will tell us what it was like to port the games

313
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,280
Speaker 3:  from PSVR to PSVR two. Cause I imagine in some cases it's gonna be really

314
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,040
Speaker 3:  easy for them, particularly if if they're, if they're using like a standard

315
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,240
Speaker 3:  engine that allows you to output games to vr like an

316
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,720
Speaker 3:  unreal engine or a Unity, I, I would think that those just have selectors,

317
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,640
Speaker 3:  hey now make the PSVR two version of my game now make the ocul

318
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,840
Speaker 3:  version of my game. I've definitely heard that from, from developers in the

319
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,720
Speaker 3:  somewhat distant past. That would be relatively easy

320
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
Speaker 2:  Like that. And this system also is allowing you

321
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,040
Speaker 2:  to just play regular games on it too, like in a theater mode, right?

322
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,520
Speaker 2:  Yes.

323
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it, the cinematic mode. When you put on the headset,

324
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,800
Speaker 3:  what you see is you see a flat virtual

325
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,520
Speaker 3:  television in front of you that's, that's the interface it, it looks exactly

326
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,440
Speaker 3:  like the PlayStation five interface when you put it on. The only difference

327
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,360
Speaker 3:  is you're not looking at a real tv, you're looking at the fake virtual TV

328
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,280
Speaker 3:  inside your headset. Two, that TV can get bigger or smaller if you

329
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,240
Speaker 3:  want it to. You can stretch it out to a giant like movie theater

330
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,960
Speaker 3:  experience. Like you're sitting five or six rows away from

331
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,760
Speaker 3:  a movie theater screen or you can get it as small as like

332
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,720
Speaker 3:  the 55 inch TV on your wall from your couch. You're seeing

333
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,400
Speaker 3:  the regular PlayStation five interface. You pick the games like any other

334
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,560
Speaker 3:  game, it's got the same settings, menu, all that kind of stuff. When you

335
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,080
Speaker 3:  launch a VR game of course then you transition into the

336
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,600
Speaker 3:  360 degree stereo 3D view of whatever your game is.

337
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,040
Speaker 3:  But you don't have to, you can do those 2D games if you are playing a normal

338
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,520
Speaker 3:  PlayStation five game or a normal PlayStation four game on there,

339
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,360
Speaker 3:  what you're looking at is you're looking at a 10 80 p image on that screen

340
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,480
Speaker 3:  so it's not as sharp as 4k. And also you're getting

341
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,120
Speaker 3:  a little bit of screen door effect because you're looking at magnified

342
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,880
Speaker 3:  pixels of the PlayStation VRS screen that's inside. That's, you know, that's

343
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,760
Speaker 3:  how it VR works. And so it's a little bit grainier than

344
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,200
Speaker 3:  it would be on your regular tv, particularly if you got a 4K TV

345
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,680
Speaker 3:  with games like the original Horizon zero dawn on PlayStation

346
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,600
Speaker 3:  four. I found that it was like very granny and very muddy and I

347
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,080
Speaker 3:  didn't like it and I wouldn't have wanted to do more of that. But with PlayStation

348
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,000
Speaker 3:  five games I played, I played a bunch of eternal in there.

349
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,720
Speaker 3:  I was like this is great, this is fine. Maybe it's not as crisp as my regular

350
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,600
Speaker 3:  tv but totally playable and now it's on this giant screen

351
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,400
Speaker 3:  and I've got this movie theater experience. And you can do that for movies

352
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
Speaker 3:  too. And you can do that for Netflix shows and you can do that for whatever

353
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,880
Speaker 3:  other streaming apps are available in the PlayStation five. They don't have

354
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,600
Speaker 3:  any limits there.

355
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,800
Speaker 4:  I've played Outer worlds on it, which I was surprised at how well it worked

356
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,240
Speaker 4:  because it's a very texty game.

357
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,800
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Text and VR games can sometimes not be super

358
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,800
Speaker 3:  sharp in the 360 degree stereo 3D

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,640
Speaker 3:  environment. But on the 2D theater screen it's seemed pretty legible.

360
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,760
Speaker 2:  And that's because this is one of like the higher resolution

361
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,000
Speaker 2:  screens we've had on a VR headset in a while, right? I think

362
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,720
Speaker 4:  It's a bit over average. It's F two K

363
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,360
Speaker 4:  per eye roughly. It's not a billion times

364
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,480
Speaker 4:  higher than average, but it's a really vivid panel.

365
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,400
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's not at much higher resolution than the Oculus quest too, which

366
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,320
Speaker 3:  is like closer to like 1800 per eye versus 2000 per eye. But like, like

367
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,120
Speaker 3:  Eddie's saying, like the panel is oad like the original PlayStation

368
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,960
Speaker 3:  vr mind you but oh let's come a long way since then. The colors

369
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,640
Speaker 3:  are really deep. The blacks, you can get

370
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,440
Speaker 3:  nearly perfect black in this headset, which is not true of most

371
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,040
Speaker 3:  headsets, including headsets that were previously using OD

372
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,280
Speaker 3:  because you'd also get something with, with OD screens called

373
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,560
Speaker 3:  God rays, where you've got these, like these shafts of light that are kind

374
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,400
Speaker 3:  of like coming into your eyes because of the lenses. A lot of

375
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,720
Speaker 3:  headsets would use fornell lenses which have

376
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,000
Speaker 3:  ridges in them. They've got a whole like array of different prisms inside

377
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,400
Speaker 3:  to make them lighter weight. They don't use as much glass as inside so they

378
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Speaker 3:  can be lighter weight, not as heavy as other headsets, but the tradeoff is

379
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,760
Speaker 3:  that each of those ridges can catch some light. And Sony actually

380
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,400
Speaker 3:  has a patent on the custom fornell lenses that they put in the

381
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,280
Speaker 3:  PlayStation to VR two where they've kind of like cushioned each

382
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,640
Speaker 3:  of the ridges. You'd have to take a look at the patent to see what I mean.

383
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,320
Speaker 3:  But they've kind of like cushioned each of the ridges so that the beams

384
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,120
Speaker 3:  don't come at those angles that they hit your eye as much. The black

385
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,680
Speaker 3:  mixer, deeper blacks. Oh

386
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,280
Speaker 2:  That's fascinating. Yeah, I think that's one of the things that kind of keeps

387
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,760
Speaker 2:  me from wanting to watch movies and stuff in VR is I'm very conscious of

388
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,520
Speaker 2:  the fact that my iPad's gonna be a better visual experience nine,

389
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,040
Speaker 2:  nine times outta 10, right? Even on a plane with the person sitting next

390
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,800
Speaker 2:  to me clearly able to watch my iPad, I'm usually more okay with that than

391
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,680
Speaker 2:  having to sit there and be like, I'm consciously looking at like a small

392
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,480
Speaker 2:  screen that's getting the hell magnified out of it with the God raises.

393
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,040
Speaker 2:  Literally. So this one, it seems like they've, they've kind of done that

394
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,160
Speaker 2:  work there. They've kind of fixed, they've done the work to make it not quite

395
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,960
Speaker 2:  as obvious to your brain that you're just looking through magnifying lenses

396
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,000
Speaker 2:  at screens.

397
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,920
Speaker 3:  I wish that was a hundred percent but

398
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,360
Speaker 4:  You're still gonna get the screened do door effect and you're still gonna

399
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,320
Speaker 4:  get the kind of slightly goly your field of view is about on average.

400
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:53,880
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

401
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,280
Speaker 2:  But

402
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,560
Speaker 4:  It just, the, the colors are great. I just, I love them

403
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,880
Speaker 3:  Les God raises deeper, blacks better colors. But also there's this

404
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,720
Speaker 3:  other thing about the lads and all of us, Adam you saw this, Tom saw

405
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,560
Speaker 3:  this, I saw this. The sweet spot is really small.

406
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,760
Speaker 3:  There's a tiny circle at the center of those fornell lenses where

407
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,600
Speaker 3:  you see brilliant, you know 4K resolution

408
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,560
Speaker 3:  through that two, two 2000 per eye and it's super crisp. And then

409
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,400
Speaker 3:  if you turn your eyes or if the headset you know, settles a little bit on

410
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,640
Speaker 3:  your head and pulls it down a tiny amount, you get knocked out of that sweet

411
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,600
Speaker 3:  spot very easily. It has one of the smaller spots, sweet

412
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,480
Speaker 3:  spots among the VR headsets we've tried and so we were, all

413
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,200
Speaker 3:  of us were like regularly adjusting the headsets on our heads so that we

414
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,640
Speaker 3:  could get the sharpest image. I would probably do it maybe every five to

415
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,680
Speaker 3:  10 minutes while I was playing.

416
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,080
Speaker 4:  That seems right. Yeah, it's

417
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,520
Speaker 3:  Not terrible. I got used to it but like it's a lot, you

418
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,760
Speaker 2:  Know? Yeah, that's a lot. And none of you guys wear, were wearing glasses

419
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Speaker 2:  while doing it, right? Like

420
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,800
Speaker 3:  Yeah, none of us were wearing glasses.

421
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,440
Speaker 2:  The glasses is one of those things that we still run into with vr. I'm wearing

422
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,960
Speaker 2:  glasses right now and sometimes I'm like okay my glasses are getting fogged

423
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,920
Speaker 2:  cuz I'm playing supernatural and it's all sweaty but also it's hard to fit

424
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,760
Speaker 2:  'em in there and then it does affect that sweet spot with the glasses cuz

425
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,120
Speaker 2:  you're suddenly having to do a lot more magnification

426
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,000
Speaker 3:  And stuff. I imagine there'd be some knock on effects there while none of

427
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,840
Speaker 3:  us used glasses. Scott Stein at CNET has some of the

428
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,160
Speaker 3:  thickest glasses I have ever seen. I used to work with him there, I've seen

429
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,200
Speaker 3:  'em in person and they are, they are big honking glasses and he says

430
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,200
Speaker 3:  this is the best headset for glasses that he's tried.

431
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,400
Speaker 2:  Oh that's a, that's

432
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,160
Speaker 3:  Wonderful. There's a lot of room in the iBox. Unlike, unlike, you know,

433
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,840
Speaker 3:  Alex, you reviewed the original PlayStation vr. This is one of the very few

434
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,520
Speaker 3:  headsets that allows you to slide the whole iBox in and out on

435
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,040
Speaker 3:  rails.

436
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

437
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,400
Speaker 3:  The closer you get it to your eyes, the more field of view you get, the further

438
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,280
Speaker 3:  away the less, but you can still see through it no matter how far in or out

439
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,880
Speaker 3:  it is. And that means that you can have room to fit your glasses in there

440
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,040
Speaker 3:  and between that and the lenses, it does a pretty decent job for him. So

441
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,480
Speaker 3:  I, I was really happy that he managed to test it because he, he would know

442
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,560
Speaker 3:  more than almost anyone else.

443
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,560
Speaker 2:  Okay. It sounds like it's much more comfortable for glasses wearers,

444
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,080
Speaker 2:  but I do know that Eddie, you kind of knocked on its comfort. Part of that

445
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,600
Speaker 2:  was because it sounds like the headset wasn't just physically as comfortable

446
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,640
Speaker 2:  as the original PSVR headset and part of that was because you had a big old

447
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,200
Speaker 2:  honking cord.

448
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,160
Speaker 4:  So the headset weighs less than the original psvr

449
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,560
Speaker 4:  but it also, it just feels balanced differently because this

450
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,480
Speaker 4:  one has a bunch of front facing cameras, which is just a generational thing.

451
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,840
Speaker 4:  I think we have an entire generation of VR headsets that just kind of pull

452
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,240
Speaker 4:  down the front of your face. Inevitably it was still like

453
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,000
Speaker 4:  definitely on the higher end of things that are comfortable. I could wear

454
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
Speaker 4:  it for just really long stretches at a time after the last headset I reviewed

455
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,440
Speaker 4:  was the pro which the meta quests pro, which was just misery, like

456
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,200
Speaker 4:  the original psvr. You would put it on someone and they'd be like, wow, I

457
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,920
Speaker 4:  didn't know VR could be this comfortable. This wasn't quite like that. This

458
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,560
Speaker 4:  was more, it was good, it was above average and then yes that Heather, I

459
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,360
Speaker 4:  hadn't realized how much I had gotten used to wireless headsets. This is,

460
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,320
Speaker 4:  I, I'm disappointed that the rumors that it was gonna be wireless didn't

461
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,640
Speaker 4:  pan out.

462
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,760
Speaker 3:  All of us got tangled in the court like none of us tripped and fell on our

463
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,640
Speaker 3:  faces or anything. But like every one of us had to get, would turn

464
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,000
Speaker 3:  one direction, be like, oh there's something wrapping around my legs and

465
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,400
Speaker 3:  have to turn the other direction to get out of it. Which is not something

466
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,960
Speaker 3:  you want to happen in the middle of an intensive game. Not that we played

467
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,680
Speaker 3:  so many intensive games, but like when I, when I start playing pistol whip

468
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,560
Speaker 3:  with this and we just got the codes today, I'm wondering whether I'm

469
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,480
Speaker 3:  going to get tangled in this thing and pull my PS five off the shelf because

470
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,400
Speaker 3:  there is no strain relief or like quick detach feature

471
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,760
Speaker 3:  at the end with the PS five. Like if you yank on that thing, it will

472
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,640
Speaker 3:  pull your PS five.

473
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Speaker 4:  Fortunately the court is quite long long. Yeah,

474
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,520
Speaker 3:  It's 14, 14.7 feet long. So it's, you know, this room

475
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,200
Speaker 3:  that I'm in now I can walk anywhere in this, this medium sized room

476
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,040
Speaker 3:  and be connected fairly well and not have to worry about it too much unless

477
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,680
Speaker 3:  I'm like turning around and around. But it's something worry about

478
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,800
Speaker 2:  As an owner of a large dog, I would be probably a little worried about

479
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,600
Speaker 2:  using it because large dogs love to be, they do not see courts.

480
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,400
Speaker 2:  I've had like a PS three and an Xbox 360 get just ripped

481
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,320
Speaker 2:  off of a shelf because of dogs in courts. So this seems like

482
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,480
Speaker 2:  potential disaster.

483
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,200
Speaker 3:  The PSVR two has a really cool pass through system. You know, if you walk

484
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,120
Speaker 3:  outside of your guardian boundary, just like with an Oculus quest with

485
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,920
Speaker 3:  a meta quests, it'll, it'll like show you, oh you're outside, here's what

486
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,240
Speaker 3:  your real world looks like again. But it does not

487
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,520
Speaker 3:  have any feature that shows you when someone

488
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,960
Speaker 3:  has come into your bubble, if a pet or a person

489
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,840
Speaker 3:  walks into your space, the cameras do not see that. They do not look for

490
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,080
Speaker 3:  that. They do not like, oh hey you should stop. There's something going on.

491
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,240
Speaker 3:  You just keep on playing until they smack into you or vice versa.

492
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,200
Speaker 4:  You gotta play defensively. Be ready to punch someone in the face at all

493
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,120
Speaker 4:  times. Fortunately with the cable, no force on earth could move the

494
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,520
Speaker 4:  PlayStation five. I actually, I had to borrow one with the kit because I

495
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,280
Speaker 4:  didn't own one. I didn't realize how big they were.

496
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,480
Speaker 3:  I really hope they do wireless for the headset and they do have a way to

497
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,400
Speaker 3:  do it. So Sony did this teardown their own teardown

498
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,240
Speaker 3:  of the PlayStation VR two and they showed that the entire headband

499
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,480
Speaker 3:  is easily detachable from the I box section up front. It has

500
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,280
Speaker 3:  a detachable cable, the whole rail system that slides the headband out, it's

501
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,240
Speaker 3:  detachable and the headband is where the USB cord plugs

502
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,040
Speaker 3:  into. So theoretically they could take the screen and all

503
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,640
Speaker 3:  the, the, the components of the PSVR two and plug them into a new different

504
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,640
Speaker 3:  headband that could have a battery inside and wireless. They could do it.

505
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,480
Speaker 3:  They have the technology.

506
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,120
Speaker 2:  How much would they charge us for that? Because the head, the headset itself

507
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,520
Speaker 2:  costs what,

508
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,400
Speaker 3:  550 for the headset, 500 for your PS five and probably

509
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,720
Speaker 3:  another 500 for the band. Right?

510
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,000
Speaker 3:  150.

511
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,760
Speaker 2:  How does, how does the price feel on this? Because one of the super

512
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,240
Speaker 2:  compelling things about the Quest too, and I think one of the reasons it

513
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,800
Speaker 2:  was adopted so quickly was because of the price, but the PSVR was also

514
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,840
Speaker 2:  for years it was like the best selling VR headset because it

515
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,800
Speaker 2:  was easy to use. Are they kind of gambling on the people are

516
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,640
Speaker 2:  gonna find that that ease of use to be good enough that they'll pay

517
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,280
Speaker 2:  that extra money?

518
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,680
Speaker 4:  I can't tell cause it's, look, it's cheaper than PC v r headsets were for

519
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,560
Speaker 4:  years before inflation. Like the original Oculus

520
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,440
Speaker 4:  Rift was I think more expensive than this at the time. The problem is

521
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,120
Speaker 4:  nothing can compete with the Quest because the Quest has been subsidized

522
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,920
Speaker 4:  so heavily for so long. Like HTC

523
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,200
Speaker 4:  would, would like for a while just kind of get mad at you if you asked them

524
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,880
Speaker 4:  because they'd be like, it is ridiculous. They are subsidizing this thing

525
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,440
Speaker 4:  through advertising. You are the product here. That is why this is affordable.

526
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,080
Speaker 4:  I don't know that it's sustainable for anybody else to go as low as the quest

527
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,200
Speaker 4:  too. But it also, yeah, the fact remains, this thing is a chunk

528
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,560
Speaker 4:  of change.

529
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,880
Speaker 3:  I think this would look really, really damn expensive compared to

530
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,640
Speaker 3:  the Quest. If the Quest was still $300 to start but they

531
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,200
Speaker 3:  raised their price by a hundred bucks and so now

532
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,680
Speaker 3:  $400 a starting price for request. And so if you

533
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,360
Speaker 3:  want to get into VR and you have nothing, no pc,

534
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,280
Speaker 3:  no PS five, maybe you look at the Quest and you're like okay this is most

535
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,800
Speaker 3:  of the same games, most of the games I wanna play are here. It's, you know,

536
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,520
Speaker 3:  I don't have to buy all this other hardware, it's wireless great, but if

537
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,440
Speaker 3:  you already have a PS five sitting around and this is

538
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,840
Speaker 3:  one of the best selling look, it's on track to be one of the best selling

539
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,520
Speaker 3:  consoles of all time. Certainly with the fastest selling consoles of all

540
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,320
Speaker 3:  time, then it's a lot easier to say 150 bucks more than a

541
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,280
Speaker 3:  Quest. And I get way better graphics and I get, you know, I

542
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,800
Speaker 3:  tracking and I get this beautiful screen and I do not

543
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,920
Speaker 3:  get meta trying to sell ads against my eyeballs

544
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,480
Speaker 3:  and whatever else. You know, you worry that meta might do and if you don't

545
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,360
Speaker 3:  have a PS five and you got a pc, well we really wish that this could

546
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,040
Speaker 3:  plug into a PC too because it, it can electrically,

547
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,240
Speaker 3:  you plug this thing into a pc, it'll show up as a 10 80 p panel for your

548
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,680
Speaker 3:  pc. It'll show that you've got some unrecognized USB

549
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,600
Speaker 3:  devices. The controllers show up at speakers. Don't ask me why my PC

550
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,560
Speaker 3:  thinks the sense controllers aren't speakers, but it does. That's

551
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,240
Speaker 4:  Basically what happened with the psvr, right? That you could end up adapting

552
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,120
Speaker 4:  it to be a PC headset.

553
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,320
Speaker 3:  Tom looked into this. Yeah, it didn't take long within the first

554
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,600
Speaker 3:  three, four months I wanna say at the PlayStation vr it was already

555
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,520
Speaker 3:  a, a Windows headset but they had apparently a lot of

556
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,880
Speaker 3:  issues with controller tracking and maybe still do.

557
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,120
Speaker 3:  So it does require like some thought

558
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,880
Speaker 2:  Because the move controllers

559
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,720
Speaker 4:  Sucked. I mean the move controllers were miserable. Speaking of the

560
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,400
Speaker 4:  controllers, I I just, I have to say I really like the plastic of these.

561
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,520
Speaker 4:  I like how solid they feel.

562
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,920
Speaker 2:  I think we're gonna use the Quest two as our comparison here cuz that's the

563
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,480
Speaker 2:  controller. A lot of people have probably used. How do they shape up? How

564
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,120
Speaker 2:  do you compare the

565
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,720
Speaker 4:  Two? See actually I feel like they're just really solid plastic. I also,

566
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,640
Speaker 4:  I think that face buttons are way tighter. That is the main thing I've noticed.

567
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,720
Speaker 4:  They're also a little hard to put on though because I'm not used to the fact

568
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,440
Speaker 4:  that you, they feel upside down because you have to put this ring around

569
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,640
Speaker 4:  the bottom of your wrist instead of over your knuckles.

570
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,200
Speaker 2:  Do you like put your hand through the ring to grab

571
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,640
Speaker 4:  It? Yes. You put your hands through the ring. It's very sci-fi. Oh

572
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,480
Speaker 3:  Boy. The one thing I don't like is the grip buttons. So

573
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,200
Speaker 3:  it's got the grip buttons under your middle fingers, just like the oculus

574
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,560
Speaker 3:  quest too. But the Oculus quest too, it's like, it's like a rest for your

575
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,320
Speaker 3:  entire middle finger. That gently pillow like

576
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,960
Speaker 3:  depresses into the grip and once it's held down there's

577
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,720
Speaker 3:  basically no spring pressure on your finger. It's such a tiny amount

578
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,800
Speaker 3:  that you feel like you could hold it that way indefinitely with the

579
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,840
Speaker 3:  PlayStation it's like a firm button and see I'm holding down this firm button

580
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,760
Speaker 3:  but I wanna let it go fairly quickly. So any game that requires me to hold

581
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,240
Speaker 3:  an object for a long time or any game where I get really, really

582
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,080
Speaker 3:  greedy and just wanna hold like five guns at once cause

583
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,960
Speaker 3:  that's a thing we do. I feel like I wanna let go. It's, it's annoying. How

584
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,680
Speaker 2:  About the, the space this takes up in your cabinet, like the PS five takes

585
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,160
Speaker 2:  up already a lot of space in the cabinet. Were you really hunting for a place

586
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,120
Speaker 2:  to put this thing when not in use bold of You would assume that I

587
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,920
Speaker 2:  ever store things.

588
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,960
Speaker 3:  That's basically where I'm coming from too. I have no idea where this thing

589
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,000
Speaker 3:  goes. It's just lying in a pile on a shelf every time I put it away.

590
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,800
Speaker 2:  Well good luck Sean and and thank you guys both for taking the time to chat

591
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,720
Speaker 2:  about the psvr. Everybody who's listening, you gotta go read

592
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,520
Speaker 2:  the review, go watch the video. That was like the best way to start my morning

593
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,320
Speaker 2:  the other day was watching that video. So thank you guys so much.

594
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,240
Speaker 2:  We're gonna take a quick break and when we're back we're gonna get really,

595
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,520
Speaker 2:  really nerdy and talk for a really, really long time about multi-room audio.

596
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,080
Speaker 5:  Hey there, I'm Josh Mucci, host of the Pitch, A show where

597
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,760
Speaker 5:  real entrepreneurs pitch real tech investors for real money

598
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,480
Speaker 5:  and this season gets a little saucy.

599
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,920
Speaker 7:  We knew that we were not going to join the same old sauce

600
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,680
Speaker 7:  game. We were gonna disrupt 130 billion industry

601
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,200
Speaker 7:  we're coming after Hines.

602
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,520
Speaker 5:  We meet founders pitching everything from a better ketchup

603
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,240
Speaker 5:  to a solution for one of the biggest problems today,

604
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,400
Speaker 5:  energy

605
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,440
Speaker 8:  In the future, the vehicles and garage. It's gonna be like a giant

606
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,360
Speaker 8:  power plant that could be used to reinforce a power grid, substitute

607
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,480
Speaker 8:  fossil fuel power plants and allow more renewable energy on the network.

608
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,120
Speaker 5:  This season 14 founders with 12 ideas

609
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,160
Speaker 5:  big enough to change the world. If the investors invest,

610
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,040
Speaker 5:  I would like to invest in this round $300,000 new episodes

611
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,520
Speaker 5:  every Wednesday. See you in the pitch room.

612
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,780
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're back. I'm very, very excited because we went really long on this

613
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,340
Speaker 2:  one and it is a lot of fun cuz Chris Welch, he's been like a scoop

614
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,060
Speaker 2:  machine lately and he's reporting on all those new Sonos speakers that are

615
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,740
Speaker 2:  supposed to come out like in the next month or so. But Sonos isn't the only

616
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,700
Speaker 2:  multi-room audio speaker out there right now. While it's still

617
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,460
Speaker 2:  the gold standard, there are a lot of competitors. So I've

618
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,260
Speaker 2:  gathered Chris who knows everything about Sonos even when they don't want

619
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,700
Speaker 2:  him to know everything about Sonos. I do

620
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,740
Speaker 9:  Enjoy the products but I also enjoy scooping

621
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,380
Speaker 2:  Them. Jen Tuey, who is our expert on smart speakers from Amazon,

622
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,820
Speaker 2:  apple, and Google,

623
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,420
Speaker 10:  I'm definitely gonna help you out here with how they work on a daily basis

624
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,780
Speaker 10:  because I use them all

625
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,780
Speaker 2:  In Chris person who recently wrote about his love of a new audio

626
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,500
Speaker 2:  device on the scene, the whim, which is like this little puck

627
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,440
Speaker 2:  that gives your old speakers multi-room audio superpowers, it's

628
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:39,560
Speaker 2:  cool,

629
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,280
Speaker 11:  It's a puck. You get on Amazon for

630
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,680
Speaker 2:  $80. Each of them have their own opinions and I'm gonna make them fight it

631
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
Speaker 2:  out and this is gonna be really, really fun.

632
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,520
Speaker 2:  So I think the first question I wanna ask

633
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:57,520
Speaker 2:  is why Sonos? Why Whim? And then

634
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,720
Speaker 2:  Jen you go first. Me, Wyatt, apple,

635
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,560
Speaker 2:  Alexa and Google.

636
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,120
Speaker 10:  So I do use all three of the voice assistants in

637
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,720
Speaker 10:  my home and, and a couple others. So we have Alexa with its Multiroom music,

638
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,880
Speaker 10:  Google Assistant with its multi-room music and then

639
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,040
Speaker 10:  Apple's Siri over Airplay. So Airplay is

640
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,880
Speaker 10:  their multi-room music and you can control it with Siri. I think the most

641
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,440
Speaker 10:  important thing to start out with when you're talking about multi-room music

642
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,120
Speaker 10:  is this is a proprietary mess. There is no

643
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,880
Speaker 10:  simple solution. As crisp person found out

644
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,000
Speaker 10:  there's ecosystem lock in hard in this space. A few of the

645
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,200
Speaker 10:  companies have tried to expand and provide much

646
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,760
Speaker 10:  more sort of flexibility, but ultimately you end up

647
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,600
Speaker 10:  with the best experience if you stick with the hardware of the

648
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,400
Speaker 10:  manufacturer. For example with Amazon's multi moon music,

649
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,360
Speaker 10:  if you have all echo devices. And to be fair to them, and this is

650
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,440
Speaker 10:  probably the biggest selling point, there are so many variations and so

651
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,720
Speaker 10:  many different ways you can play through an echo speaker. You've got the

652
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,080
Speaker 10:  small speakers, you've got the little echo dots, you've got the Echo big

653
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,000
Speaker 10:  round echo, fourth gen, you've got fire TVs. There are so many

654
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,800
Speaker 10:  that work great. And when you set up Multiroom music you can look in your

655
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,480
Speaker 10:  app and it's like, oh look at this. I have like 10 speakers in my house.

656
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,360
Speaker 10:  I can have this great multi room music experience. They do work

657
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,080
Speaker 10:  with a few, with quite a few third party speakers as well. I've actually

658
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,280
Speaker 10:  managed to get my multi-room music playing through my smoke alarm, which

659
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,720
Speaker 10:  is really exciting. Ooh. And my thermostat.

660
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,400
Speaker 10:  So it works with the OneLink smoke alarm and it could be thermostat if you

661
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
Speaker 10:  enable Alexa. So you know there's a lot of options there. The problem I

662
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Speaker 10:  have always found with Amazon's, I'm trying not to say the name, to set

663
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,960
Speaker 10:  off everyone's devices with Amazon's multi-room music using voice

664
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,960
Speaker 10:  is there are issues with mesh networks. It seems like when you have a

665
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,880
Speaker 10:  mesh wifi network and you use multi-room music, it's very hard to

666
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,680
Speaker 10:  get all of your devices working together. This is something that Amazon

667
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,000
Speaker 10:  can't really control although, and this is even using like their own Arrow

668
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,960
Speaker 10:  network. I've had the I Mesh network and I will set up multi room music

669
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,680
Speaker 10:  with multiple speakers but only like three will show up and then

670
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,160
Speaker 10:  you select another one and the other three show up.

671
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,160
Speaker 10:  You can't get them all on one because they're on different nodes. I may

672
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,640
Speaker 10:  be going in the weeds a bit here, but that's basically one of the biggest

673
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,600
Speaker 10:  issues I've had using Amazon's multimillion music. But when it

674
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,000
Speaker 10:  does work it's probably one of the easiest to use. It's the easiest

675
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Speaker 10:  nomenclature to get it going. You can say, hey Amazon's assistant

676
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,720
Speaker 10:  play me the latest Taylor Swift album and away it

677
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,600
Speaker 10:  will go with Google. That is not the case. Oh, so Google

678
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,840
Speaker 10:  has the same sort of basic setup. So you can use any

679
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,800
Speaker 10:  Google speaker. So you've got the Nest hub, the Nest max,

680
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,520
Speaker 10:  the next Nest Mini, the Nest audio and then some of the older

681
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,480
Speaker 10:  Google Home speakers, any Chromecast enabled speakers. So third party

682
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,240
Speaker 10:  speakers from like Lenovo, if you still have Chromecast

683
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,040
Speaker 10:  audio, all of those devices, they'll all work with multi-room music.

684
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,760
Speaker 10:  The problem I have with using the Google system with voice

685
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,960
Speaker 10:  is if I ask, say for the same thing, say play me

686
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,800
Speaker 10:  some Taylor Swift, I just this morning tested it out on one of my Nest

687
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,520
Speaker 10:  hub maxes and instead of playing the music everywhere as I asked it to,

688
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,040
Speaker 10:  it showed me a YouTube video of Taylor Swift. So

689
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,080
Speaker 10:  the nomenclature is the issue there, you know, and there's different ways

690
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,680
Speaker 10:  of using multi room music. If the voice isn't your preferred option, of

691
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,320
Speaker 10:  course you can do it through an app and this is where the sort of ecosystem

692
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,160
Speaker 10:  locking comes in. Spotify lets you play to any of these speakers

693
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,040
Speaker 10:  so you, if you have a Spotify account you can use Alexa multi room music,

694
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,000
Speaker 10:  you can use Google's multi room music, you can use Sonos and that works

695
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,880
Speaker 10:  fine but you're locked into Spotify. It's just a bit of a mess

696
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,680
Speaker 10:  right now. I think people like flexibility, especially in their

697
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,680
Speaker 10:  home, especially if you have more than one person in your home, you might

698
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,440
Speaker 10:  want a different speaker in your room or you might want different speaker

699
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,360
Speaker 10:  in your kitchen. And right now it's so hard to find a simple

700
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,640
Speaker 10:  solution that works reliably with multi room music. That's been

701
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,320
Speaker 10:  my experience and this is why I was so excited about Chris Person's article.

702
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,800
Speaker 10:  In fact, when it came out I tweeted it to my followers and I was like, I

703
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,240
Speaker 10:  think some of you might have been looking for this. And there were a lot

704
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,560
Speaker 10:  of positive responses because it's just a frustrating space.

705
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,480
Speaker 10:  And just to wrap up the, the smart home side, and I know

706
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,040
Speaker 10:  Chris Welch will will help weigh in on this too cuz we just finished testing

707
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,840
Speaker 10:  the home pods together. Obviously Apple has its airplay

708
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,600
Speaker 10:  system and that is one of the systems that actually works the most

709
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,360
Speaker 10:  reliably across speaker platforms. So you can use a number of

710
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,160
Speaker 10:  different speakers without problems. So you can have your

711
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,960
Speaker 10:  Sonos, you can have bows, you can have your Apple Home Pods

712
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,560
Speaker 10:  and Apple TV so your TV speakers can kind of get in on the game

713
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,880
Speaker 10:  but it's less intuitive to control and you really relies on your

714
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,280
Speaker 10:  iPhone. You can use the voice assistant but it is not as

715
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,400
Speaker 10:  intuitive in terms of you know, commands to get it

716
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,720
Speaker 10:  working.

717
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,040
Speaker 2:  It can get real dumb when when I asked it to play music sometimes

718
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,920
Speaker 2:  it's like no you don't wanna listen to Pippen. And I'm like, I do, I'm the

719
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,680
Speaker 2:  one person that wants to listen to Pippen and it's like we're gonna play

720
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,240
Speaker 2:  you some rock. And I was like that's that's cool I guess. No,

721
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,240
Speaker 10:  I know it's, it's, it's quite funny what each of the smart assistants will

722
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,000
Speaker 10:  come up with when you ask for a specific audio.

723
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,040
Speaker 2:  They all have opinions and they're not good.

724
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,960
Speaker 10:  And then the final piece of the puzzle of course is you can use Sonos with

725
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,720
Speaker 10:  Amazon's assistant but only Sonos speakers.

726
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,760
Speaker 10:  So you can set up a Sonos group in your Amazon Alexa app

727
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:37,080
Speaker 10:  and play music using one of your Echo speakers but

728
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,680
Speaker 10:  only to sono speakers. So you can't, I'm almost a hundred percent certain,

729
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,400
Speaker 10:  correct me if I'm wrong, but my experience you can only group

730
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,320
Speaker 10:  sono speakers together using Alexa. You can't also add in like

731
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,440
Speaker 10:  your Echo studio if you have one with your Sonos Beam.

732
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,760
Speaker 10:  So that's kind of again that kind of frustrating like ah I've got these

733
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,600
Speaker 10:  speakers and I wanna be able to do this but it's hard and I don't know,

734
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,560
Speaker 10:  I mean technically whether this is difficult thing to fix to make or whether

735
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,160
Speaker 10:  it's just the different companies are like locking in

736
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,120
Speaker 10:  their proprietary systems and making it impossible to share.

737
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,000
Speaker 10:  And I'm sure Chris Welch could probably fill us in on

738
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,120
Speaker 10:  that.

739
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,240
Speaker 2:  We need to go to Chris Welch because that's the beauty of Sonos, right? It

740
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,120
Speaker 2:  is super proprietary. It is all one thing but when it works,

741
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,160
Speaker 9:  When it works, it works really well. And I'm not a big voice service person

742
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,880
Speaker 9:  so I don't like use like their own voice service. I don't use Alexa and Sonos

743
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,640
Speaker 9:  devices, I just use Sonos as its own thing. It's for music, it's for entertainment,

744
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,520
Speaker 9:  it supports like all the services under the sun and they have speakers

745
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,720
Speaker 9:  for like so many use cases how Jen was saying Amazon has a ton of like different

746
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,840
Speaker 9:  price points and sizes, but Sonos has like different use cases, right? Like

747
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,960
Speaker 9:  I've got the Sonos Roam for the shower, which you can't really do with any

748
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,760
Speaker 9:  home pod or any kind of other gadget. I've got the Sonos arc for my

749
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,920
Speaker 9:  living room, which sounds great, playing music as well. And I've got the

750
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,480
Speaker 9:  Sonos play five on my desk for you know like proper sitting and listening

751
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,080
Speaker 9:  to music and enjoying it and I've got the move if I wanna like go outside

752
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,680
Speaker 9:  and and play mu music there. So like that kind of versatility of Sonos like

753
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,480
Speaker 9:  it doesn't work great. Some people hate the app. I don't really mind it after

754
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,360
Speaker 9:  all these years I've gotten used to it. But yeah when it works it's just

755
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,440
Speaker 9:  like, it just feels boundless in terms of like what you can do with it and

756
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,240
Speaker 9:  I think that's been the main draw to me.

757
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,000
Speaker 2:  But when it breaks,

758
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:20,640
Speaker 12:  Yes

759
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,640
Speaker 2:  I just watched Chris person like yes it does rise up but

760
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,800
Speaker 2:  Welch first to you then we'll go to person.

761
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:32,520
Speaker 9:  So I'd say for me it's been like 85% not consistent, which is

762
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,880
Speaker 9:  good average, but when you do have like let's say cutouts or kind of issues,

763
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,840
Speaker 9:  some people swear by plugging one of your Sonos speakers into ethernet

764
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,120
Speaker 9:  directly and that creates like a small little private network for all of

765
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,440
Speaker 9:  your Sonos gear. And so they do tend to talk to each other a lot better when

766
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,200
Speaker 9:  you do that. So if you're having cutouts, try plugging in. If that doesn't

767
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,960
Speaker 9:  fix it then I guess it's time to pursue something else. I

768
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,680
Speaker 2:  Know a lot of people were really challenged when Sonos moved from S one to

769
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,640
Speaker 2:  S two. They had two versions of the app and originally they were like if

770
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,280
Speaker 2:  you are using the old app, all of the speakers on it will only work with

771
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,840
Speaker 2:  the old app and will be dead to the new app. Then everybody was like Sonos,

772
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,560
Speaker 2:  do you know how much we spent? Absolutely not. And so they said okay, if

773
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,400
Speaker 2:  you've got the S two, your old stuff will work with it, it might be a little

774
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,480
Speaker 2:  different. And most people I think have migrated to S two are

775
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,320
Speaker 2:  using it. I've used it. I honestly, I use Airplay with my Sonos

776
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,600
Speaker 2:  speakers more than I used the Sonos app at this point. Yeah. Which is why

777
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,320
Speaker 2:  I was also very interested in Chris's story

778
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,360
Speaker 2:  where cuz that's what you're doing doing with the whim.

779
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,440
Speaker 11:  So yeah like I dunno, my attitude towards Sonos is that I don't doubt that

780
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,400
Speaker 11:  they're good devices and I've seen them around and they seem nice but it's

781
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,480
Speaker 11:  kind of like, do you remember the episode of the Simpsons when Kirk Van

782
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,960
Speaker 11:  Howden gets divorced and he's like, I sleep in a race car bed and I'm like,

783
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,280
Speaker 11:  I sleep in a big bed with my wife. It's like

784
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,560
Speaker 11:  okay this is our generation's bows wave, which was a great sounding

785
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,720
Speaker 11:  device but if you talk to audio files at the time they were like, I'm not

786
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,160
Speaker 11:  using that cuz that's for children, you know what I mean? Like and like

787
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,800
Speaker 11:  here's the thing and I don't wanna be come off as like too condescending

788
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,440
Speaker 11:  or something like that. It's just that I have a very specific thing where

789
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,720
Speaker 11:  like I actually do have a couple of HomePod minis. I think they're pretty

790
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,520
Speaker 11:  good if, if you want to get whatever today's equivalent of a clock radio

791
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,360
Speaker 11:  that you put in your kitchen is they, they're great. You know what I mean?

792
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,720
Speaker 11:  They're great. Airplay two works, it also works really well cuz they broke

793
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,320
Speaker 11:  it, nerds hacked it, so now you can use it with everything. If Apple

794
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,240
Speaker 11:  was, I don't wanna say smart, but like cool they would do what

795
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,080
Speaker 11:  they've been doing with MagSafe devices and just say okay everybody gets

796
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,040
Speaker 11:  airplay too. You know what I mean? Because that would just solve a lot of

797
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,640
Speaker 11:  this so too would fixing it with Matter. I have a bunch of

798
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,960
Speaker 11:  speakers already. I don't need to buy new speakers, I don't need to buy

799
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,680
Speaker 11:  new speakers that have a thing in them that might not work in six years

800
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:47,600
Speaker 11:  that has like a wifi chip that sucks in five years. I don't need that

801
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,600
Speaker 11:  powered speakers are even like me kind of cheating. The

802
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,480
Speaker 11:  idea should be that like you create something that just

803
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,280
Speaker 11:  gets audio to go to different places and it should be something that we

804
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,040
Speaker 11:  all agree works with each other and the fact that none of these

805
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,000
Speaker 11:  companies could do this is indicative of what they want to sell

806
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,640
Speaker 11:  you, which is their own little gated community, their own little

807
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,440
Speaker 11:  tiny weird castle town that they live in.

808
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,200
Speaker 11:  And and I, and I hate that crap. I'm sorry I, it's it, it makes me, it drives

809
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,600
Speaker 11:  me up the wall. So basically, yeah I started off like, okay, how do I do

810
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,920
Speaker 11:  this? Okay. Chromecast used to be good. I knew people who used to like hoard

811
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,760
Speaker 11:  airplay express twos because those actually got updated to Airplay two for

812
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,560
Speaker 11:  a really long time. So people were using like an Apple router

813
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,840
Speaker 11:  that like had an ox out

814
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,160
Speaker 2:  That nobody's used in

815
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,080
Speaker 11:  Years that nobody's used in years because it was the only thing

816
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,520
Speaker 11:  that they had for a really long time that just was like Airplay two plus

817
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,040
Speaker 11:  optical audio app. That's all people wanted. And like Chromecast audio was

818
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,520
Speaker 11:  pretty good for a while and then they're like, we're not going to use this

819
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,320
Speaker 11:  anymore. And I wondered if that was like because Sonos got

820
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:57,560
Speaker 11:  lawy with them or if that had anything to do with it at all. But like, this

821
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,320
Speaker 11:  is the thing is like I think Sonos, the use case for Sonos long term

822
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,200
Speaker 11:  isn't terribly strong. People are figuring this stuff out. What

823
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,000
Speaker 11:  do they have that is special? And the answer is nothing. The way that Bose

824
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,760
Speaker 11:  didn't have anything particularly special with its with its thing other

825
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,840
Speaker 11:  than the fact that it made kind of nice speakers that were good for most

826
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,240
Speaker 11:  people because they were simple and like that. That's it.

827
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,200
Speaker 2:  Now Welch fight him

828
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:21,760
Speaker 13:  Dinging.

829
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,880
Speaker 9:  I mean, I think the simple option goes a long way. Like it always hasn't.

830
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,920
Speaker 9:  It always will. Bo still sends a ton of products. You know, Sonos is doing

831
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,720
Speaker 9:  very well. They're very defensive of their ip. I will admit that they've

832
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,080
Speaker 9:  had a lot of settlements over the years and there's another child with Google

833
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,840
Speaker 9:  starts in May.

834
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Cuz they were supposed to have the Google assistant.

835
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,400
Speaker 9:  They do still have the assistant, but it's kind of like a, it's just a tense

836
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,800
Speaker 9:  relationship and like you can use their voice thing and you can use Alexa

837
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,000
Speaker 9:  at the same time. You can't do that with Google Assistant because Google

838
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,000
Speaker 9:  apparently will not let anybody build like a multi kind of voice system with

839
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,480
Speaker 9:  assistant. But yeah, Sonos can be kinda lawy because I think they see this

840
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,160
Speaker 9:  as like their whole thing.

841
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,880
Speaker 2:  You know, Chris, you said it kind of sucks. You kind of feel like it's for

842
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,760
Speaker 2:  the bows. I think in both cases though, I knew a lot of people who use

843
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,920
Speaker 2:  the bows. I, I own the Sonos now and I own the Sonos because I was like,

844
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,680
Speaker 2:  oh, I wanna do all this big stuff. Oh, I don't have the time and energy

845
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,560
Speaker 2:  to figure out all of the big stuff. Sure. And so I went Sonos because it

846
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,880
Speaker 2:  just works. Like it just works. That's it. Will I one day

847
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:23,800
Speaker 2:  replace my, my Sonos play base and my two ones with like

848
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,760
Speaker 2:  actual towers and an amplifier that cost three times as much, but sound

849
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,720
Speaker 2:  three times better. A hundred percent. If anybody has suggestions,

850
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,640
Speaker 2:  please email me. But it also just worked. I plugged it in and it like

851
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,560
Speaker 2:  went. But it sounds like you, like it took you a very long time to kind of

852
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,640
Speaker 2:  settle on on this system that you, you have now. Did it

853
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,840
Speaker 2:  take you a long time to set up that system?

854
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,120
Speaker 11:  The whims? No, it takes like two seconds. It, it works really

855
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,680
Speaker 2:  Well. Oh no, Sonos.

856
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:54,720
Speaker 11:  No, no. That's the funny part is that it works really well. It takes two

857
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,440
Speaker 11:  seconds to like set up, it's like a little glitchy but it never does the,

858
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:02,120
Speaker 11:  like I was at a party with someone and they were

859
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,840
Speaker 11:  DJing and the, the Sonos was involved and something bad

860
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,880
Speaker 11:  happened and man it was not fun. It like

861
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,800
Speaker 11:  kind of stopped the party for like 15 minutes while he had

862
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,200
Speaker 11:  to like dig through cables and shit. You know, like plug it in and plug

863
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,520
Speaker 11:  it out like a router. The wind just works. I mean like that's the funny

864
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,200
Speaker 11:  thing is that like part of the weight through this path was me

865
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,480
Speaker 11:  being like, all right, I can currently buy a raspberry pie,

866
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,840
Speaker 11:  which is not something you can do right now. Just walk

867
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,760
Speaker 11:  into a Microcenter and buy Raspberry Pie. Let me see if somebody has hacked

868
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,000
Speaker 11:  something together. Cuz I know Nerds, I've been on GitHub like today

869
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,160
Speaker 11:  they, they, they figured this stuff out and the answer is like they're in

870
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,440
Speaker 11:  as much of a pickle as I think us. Like there's a, there's one like called

871
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,880
Speaker 11:  Snap cast that sorta worked. It was this like long thing where I had to

872
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,360
Speaker 11:  like follow what was functionally an Instructables page to be like all right,

873
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,280
Speaker 11:  first you're gonna do this and then you're gonna get this hat for it. And

874
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,600
Speaker 11:  like it sort of worked and then that eventually I moved on to doing,

875
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,560
Speaker 11:  somebody actually hacked Airplay two to work with these things and that

876
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,840
Speaker 11:  kind of worked, it got me sort of where I needed to go, you know what I

877
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,520
Speaker 11:  mean? And then like a year goes by, I'm kind of okay with this.

878
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,120
Speaker 11:  Also airplane two is not like ideal because it's, it's not

879
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,360
Speaker 11:  audio file quality in terms of what it's doing. It caps at

880
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,880
Speaker 11:  44 1 I think, which most people won't hear that's CD quality,

881
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,120
Speaker 11:  whatever. But like for me, I have very specific reasons why I don't want

882
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,680
Speaker 11:  that that involve like toss link timing and crap like that.

883
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,960
Speaker 11:  But like, you know, it, it does the thing you're talking about And like

884
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,920
Speaker 11:  that's the thing is like I'm more amenable to the HomePod Mini because it

885
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,760
Speaker 11:  knows what it is. It's pretty straightforward, it's simple to use. It integrates

886
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,600
Speaker 11:  with the system that I have, including the weem. Like you're saying Airplay

887
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,240
Speaker 11:  two is very, even though it's like still proprietary kind of compatible

888
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,880
Speaker 11:  with other things, it plays well with other things. And that's the thing

889
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,200
Speaker 11:  that I think people are sort of moving to and I like hope we see with like

890
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,880
Speaker 11:  Matter and stuff like that. Like Matter TV we've pointed out is like a video

891
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,680
Speaker 11:  codec but it doesn't look like anybody's like aching to like make and

892
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,800
Speaker 11:  matter audio. But that would solve this

893
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,560
Speaker 10:  Amazon's aching too. No one else is though

894
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,880
Speaker 11:  By the way. I did look it up. The WEEM has the like Amazon Ultra

895
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,920
Speaker 11:  HD audio, you know that stuff works with it. Like the other thing is like,

896
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,200
Speaker 11:  yeah Spotify Connect, the only thing it doesn't have I think is like Chromecast

897
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,040
Speaker 11:  in the WEEM Mini doesn't work but it doesn't the pro and then like,

898
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,800
Speaker 11:  I don't know Apple ar Apple music is just like proprietary. Although they

899
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,960
Speaker 11:  would be smart to put it on other devices, you know what I mean? But like

900
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,360
Speaker 11:  that's the thing is like this thing can play music for my server. It can

901
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,960
Speaker 11:  play at like 1 92 kilohertz, 24 bit like

902
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,720
Speaker 11:  streaming flax. Like if you want that real pervert stuff,

903
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,560
Speaker 11:  multiroom, you can do it with an $80 device.

904
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,760
Speaker 2:  Silver wifi.

905
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,240
Speaker 11:  Well no the pro has a, has ethernet connection so you can do it through

906
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,840
Speaker 11:  that way too. You know what I mean? Although I, my wifi is strong enough

907
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,920
Speaker 11:  to support this, you know, I've made it, I have made it so

908
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,560
Speaker 2:  I love

909
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,480
Speaker 11:  This. And the other option is roone, which is like for guys on audio

910
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,200
Speaker 11:  science review. Like literally for guys that post on audio forms and Roone

911
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,480
Speaker 11:  is really good but they, you are paying money.

912
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,560
Speaker 2:  Roone is an app, right? It's

913
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,440
Speaker 11:  A service. It is a service you pay money for and it, they are really

914
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,360
Speaker 11:  good. Like that's the thing people wouldn't pay money for this guys on audio

915
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,120
Speaker 11:  forms wouldn't pay money for this if it, if it wasn't as good as they thought

916
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,000
Speaker 11:  it was. Which is like 3 86 kilohertz, you know, completely

917
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,800
Speaker 11:  uncomplex. Like Lossless, they have their own thing called Rat, R A A

918
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,640
Speaker 11:  T, which is a, their own audio transport. Kodak, that's like

919
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,560
Speaker 11:  peerless, you know what I mean? And like does the job, it works with Chromecast

920
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,080
Speaker 11:  weirdly, like they got it to work with the Chromecast audios and works with

921
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,040
Speaker 11:  raspberry pies, but it does metadata cataloging cloud

922
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,840
Speaker 11:  stuff and then like multi-room audio and it does it really

923
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,800
Speaker 11:  well And that's why guys that own really fancy high-end speaker

924
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,360
Speaker 11:  systems pay money for it because it's like if Plex samples good.

925
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,640
Speaker 9:  Yeah that sounds like the service for movies where you can like pay to watch

926
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,760
Speaker 9:  movies that are in theaters that like uncompressed

927
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,240
Speaker 11:  Quality. Yeah.

928
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah we are like pucks they're they're pucks and you plug them into your

929
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:56,920
Speaker 2:  speakers.

930
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,960
Speaker 11:  Yeah there's a puck and then there's a big box and the box is 150.

931
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:04,080
Speaker 2:  So Roone, you go and you get a raspberry pie, you put a software on it, you

932
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,520
Speaker 2:  plug that into speakers, you pay roone a lot of money and it gives you like

933
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,600
Speaker 2:  almost that Sonos experience. If it just works

934
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,880
Speaker 11:  It, it's like if Sonos was good. Yeah and

935
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,400
Speaker 9:  Sonos subreddit is gonna be very

936
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,160
Speaker 11:  Upset. I'm sorry man. They're like, you go, you go, you go defend ru

937
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,120
Speaker 11:  go defend Sonos on like an audio forum and see where that gets you. I mean

938
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,760
Speaker 11:  like there's a couple of people, these people are sick. They, they love

939
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,280
Speaker 11:  Logitech media server, they love like all of like d n la

940
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,520
Speaker 2:  This is like when I go on the, the headphones servers with the

941
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,440
Speaker 2:  AirPods. Yeah I'm happy with my AirPods. I like

942
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,840
Speaker 11:  AirPods. But that's the thing, that's the weird thing. It's this middle

943
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,520
Speaker 11:  ground that I don't like. So like Apple I'm fine with cuz they're experiencing

944
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,280
Speaker 11:  a pretty good hardware renaissance. They like, you know, it's fine. Your

945
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,600
Speaker 11:  mom asks straight, I get there like yeah sure it's fine. It's not, it's

946
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,840
Speaker 11:  not like a fire device or a Google device. It's like the, the one smart

947
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,880
Speaker 11:  home speaker I kind of think is okay and you can get 'em on sale at Costco

948
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:00,160
Speaker 11:  or like the really perverted stuff where you get the thing you're supposed

949
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,960
Speaker 11:  to get. But the middle ground where you pay a lot of money for something

950
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,600
Speaker 11:  that isn't the thing you want is the thing that I have objections to.

951
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,920
Speaker 11:  Especially if it only plays with itself.

952
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,360
Speaker 10:  Well and that's the main space. Yeah, that's the main space right now, isn't

953
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,800
Speaker 10:  it? And that's, and we were talking about this on the last time I was on

954
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,640
Speaker 10:  the Verge cast with with Neli because the problem is these speakers do so

955
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,240
Speaker 10:  many different things and they have all these different radios in them and

956
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,880
Speaker 10:  that obviously is not an ideal environment for audio. But ultimately

957
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:28,960
Speaker 10:  things like the E Echo speakers and the Nest audios and the

958
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,280
Speaker 10:  minis, the HomePod minis, they're really designed for the person that just

959
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,640
Speaker 10:  wants to be able to get their music quickly and you know, in their kitchen

960
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,560
Speaker 10:  or in their bathroom or and played around the house. They're not really

961
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,400
Speaker 10:  designed for the audio file. But we have been given this

962
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,280
Speaker 10:  great experience like Amazon came out with with the

963
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,720
Speaker 10:  multi-room audio with its speakers really early on and

964
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,000
Speaker 10:  everyone was like, this is great and these are cheap compared to what we

965
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,920
Speaker 10:  had to do with Sonos. And so we were offered this great experience but the

966
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,560
Speaker 10:  follow through has not really been there. So now we are stuck with what's

967
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,200
Speaker 10:  kind of a messy complicated situation and

968
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,920
Speaker 10:  we need simple solutions and Chris's solution

969
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,720
Speaker 10:  sounds actually really simple but I don't think it's the type of thing that

970
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,000
Speaker 10:  most people are gonna go out and buy just because it's an extra step. People

971
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,960
Speaker 10:  want the simple, like I have my speaker, why doesn't it do exactly what

972
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,160
Speaker 10:  I want? I mean not saying that multi-room audio never works cuz it does.

973
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,200
Speaker 10:  But there are many, I said in my experience with Amazon's,

974
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,040
Speaker 10:  like I was just testing it all out before we came on just to kind of refresh

975
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,520
Speaker 10:  my memory on things. And I had it play music throughout the house, couldn't

976
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,400
Speaker 10:  get it to work on every speaker within three minutes. It had just stopped

977
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,600
Speaker 10:  for no particular reason. And that happens all the time. I

978
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,520
Speaker 10:  think it may be wifi based because it's mesh, I don't know, I'm not

979
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,120
Speaker 10:  an network engineer but neither are the people that this is marketed to.

980
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,000
Speaker 10:  It needs to just work and Chris person mentioned matter at least

981
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,400
Speaker 10:  three times. So I need to jump on the matter bandwagon again here

982
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,560
Speaker 10:  because this, and I've spoken to both Chrises about this. This is

983
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,480
Speaker 10:  something that potentially could be solved with matter. There is

984
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:09,200
Speaker 10:  a casting in the matter spec casting

985
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,320
Speaker 10:  protocol. Amazon has jumped on it. We wrote about it a while ago. In fact

986
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,160
Speaker 10:  very recently there's actually a certified device

987
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:21,360
Speaker 10:  from Amazon that uses this matter spec, but they won't tell me

988
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,960
Speaker 10:  what it is. But we assume it's something to do with fire TV

989
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,920
Speaker 10:  because there's two parts of this to casting. It can, it can be casting

990
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,080
Speaker 10:  your video to your TV or your audio

991
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:36,240
Speaker 10:  to your speakers and obviously Amazon needs a video casting

992
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,360
Speaker 10:  solution because it doesn't have one and its competitors do. But it could,

993
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,000
Speaker 10:  in the same vein, this casting spec could work across

994
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,920
Speaker 10:  all of the speakers that you have that are matter enabled and all,

995
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,520
Speaker 10:  you know what the one common thread is of every major tech

996
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,440
Speaker 10:  manufacturer's hubs that are in matter right now, they are

997
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,240
Speaker 10:  also smart speakers. So it seems like, you know, we, we already

998
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,120
Speaker 10:  have the infrastructure there, but there are two major roadblocks. The first

999
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,960
Speaker 10:  is that smart speakers are not a matter device and the second is there

1000
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,920
Speaker 10:  is a smart speaker working group in the matter system in

1001
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,840
Speaker 10:  the CSA and it involves Sonos and Bose

1002
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,680
Speaker 10:  and a few other big audio names. And I'm assuming also Apple

1003
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,440
Speaker 10:  and Amazon and Google are involved in that because they're very much sort

1004
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,480
Speaker 10:  of running matter.

1005
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,120
Speaker 2:  They love

1006
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,560
Speaker 10:  Matter apparently according to an unnamed source.

1007
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,680
Speaker 10:  That group has yet to actually do anything.

1008
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,480
Speaker 10:  They're just a group in name. There has been no impetus

1009
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,880
Speaker 10:  behind this group to, to actually move forward and

1010
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,560
Speaker 10:  theorizing. Having spoken to the Chris's about this, is that for

1011
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,120
Speaker 10:  what's the benefit right now for Sonos or Bose to

1012
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,920
Speaker 10:  give away any of their proprietary tech? I mean Apple did

1013
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,560
Speaker 10:  contribute home kit to matter, right? That's one of the basic

1014
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,240
Speaker 10:  foundations of the new matter spec. So you know, in theory

1015
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,800
Speaker 10:  maybe they could also contribute Airplay or Sonos could contribute

1016
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,640
Speaker 10:  its proprietary tech. But again this, there's a lot more money

1017
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,520
Speaker 10:  involved when it comes to speakers and music streaming services than there

1018
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,800
Speaker 10:  is smart plugs. Yeah. And the person I spoke to said

1019
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,560
Speaker 10:  ultimately what's gonna shift Sonos and bows is consumer

1020
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,560
Speaker 10:  pressure. So the more people complain about, you know, not being able to

1021
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,480
Speaker 10:  use their other speakers with their fancy Sonos speakers, the more

1022
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,120
Speaker 10:  consumer pressure there is, the more likely these companies are to sort

1023
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,840
Speaker 10:  of have to start coming along playing the game. But you know, whether it

1024
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,560
Speaker 10:  ever, ever happens, I think, you know, matter's got a lot of other things

1025
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,440
Speaker 10:  to sort out first.

1026
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:39,080
Speaker 2:  Okay. I've gotta interrupt the multi room audio discourse because we've gotta

1027
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,120
Speaker 2:  take a break and then we'll be back to talk more about the matter situation

1028
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,360
Speaker 2:  and dive even deeper on Sonos.

1029
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:57,100
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're back. Chris Welch, you, you have a, a

1030
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,660
Speaker 2:  keen inside knowledge over there at Sonos. You, you, you have an ability

1031
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,540
Speaker 2:  to just kind of figure out what they're working on. Are they thinking about

1032
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,300
Speaker 2:  matter or you, are you seeing anything from them that suggests that they

1033
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,740
Speaker 2:  have any interest in kind of changing their, their business model?

1034
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,180
Speaker 9:  I think they last, they were taking a look at it. I think they're on the

1035
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,860
Speaker 9:  group or in the group, right? You know, they're, they're they're present.

1036
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,340
Speaker 9:  They haven't really just made any promises about you know, what's coming

1037
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,960
Speaker 9:  or, or any of that. I think like we're also seeing talking about pressure

1038
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,040
Speaker 9:  that like might not really exist cuz like how many people own like several

1039
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,440
Speaker 9:  different platforms of these speakers, right? If you buy a Sonos, you're

1040
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,080
Speaker 9:  gonna, that you're gonna lean Sonos when you want a soundbar, when you want

1041
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,760
Speaker 9:  a portable speaker, you're gonna buy the room. And so like once you commit

1042
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,440
Speaker 9:  to one, like the odds of you straying from that and starting on like a

1043
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,520
Speaker 9:  home pod is kind of strange. Yeah

1044
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,840
Speaker 2:  It kind of feels like Sonos is in this space where Apple was for a very long

1045
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,280
Speaker 2:  time where Apple was very, very expensive versus everybody else. So you,

1046
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,880
Speaker 2:  right, you had to have enough money to actually afford it and but then when

1047
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,880
Speaker 2:  you did it, it just worked. And so you're like, okay, well it just works

1048
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,520
Speaker 2:  so I'm gonna, I've got enough money to afford it so I'm gonna stay in this

1049
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,120
Speaker 2:  ecosystem and, and Sonos seems super

1050
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,920
Speaker 2:  comfortable doing the same thing. Being like, look we, we've really, we did

1051
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,880
Speaker 2:  one that is Atmos now there's a rumor that they might be doing more

1052
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,520
Speaker 2:  speakers that fire upwards, more Atmos enabled speakers. Like

1053
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:16,000
Speaker 2:  they recognize there's the demand and they're gonna meet it

1054
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:19,680
Speaker 2:  but at their pace and with their app,

1055
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,720
Speaker 9:  Right? Like I would argue for the last few years, last year at least they

1056
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,800
Speaker 9:  were focused on like the lower end with the Sonos Ray and the Rome. Over

1057
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,480
Speaker 9:  the past couple years they've been trying to like slide downward and now

1058
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,120
Speaker 9:  this year they're going back upward toward the high end. So we're gonna see

1059
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,600
Speaker 9:  some new speakers in the next few months and I'm sure we're gonna have the

1060
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,200
Speaker 9:  audio file conversation all over again. Like is this audio file quality?

1061
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,840
Speaker 9:  Who knows? I think the Sonos five is like the best sounding speaker among

1062
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,760
Speaker 9:  all the tech players at least. Like it's better than a home pod. It's better

1063
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,600
Speaker 9:  than any studio from Amazon, the Echo Studio. So like in terms of like

1064
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,720
Speaker 9:  they're a pretty small company to like do that and to like have that footing

1065
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,680
Speaker 9:  is pretty decent.

1066
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,840
Speaker 11:  Honestly the smartest thing they've done to me was other stuff with Ikea.

1067
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,120
Speaker 11:  Like they have a bunch of really solid Ikea smart home stuff and being

1068
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,800
Speaker 11:  like, hey we want a foothold in what is very clearly an

1069
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,760
Speaker 11:  affordable ecosystem that, that you are selling at like bulk

1070
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,840
Speaker 11:  for pretty, you know what I mean? Like

1071
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,080
Speaker 9:  Start young as college students and get 'em book on Sonos right away.

1072
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,960
Speaker 11:  That's a smart move. But it also traps you into that ecosystem. And I think

1073
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,400
Speaker 11:  a lot of those are probably two devices too, which is also nice, you know

1074
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Speaker 11:  what I mean? I don't necessarily want to own an IKEA speakers but they're

1075
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,480
Speaker 11:  like apparently pretty okay. You know what I mean? Like they're not bad.

1076
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:28,360
Speaker 11:  I do think the question of like, you know, consumer pressure

1077
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:32,240
Speaker 11:  is one of like how frustrated is your mom gonna be when she, when one of

1078
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,760
Speaker 11:  these breaks and then she has to buy another one Or like, you know, I think

1079
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,840
Speaker 11:  it's like the smart bulb thing. I mean that's the reason why you're seeing

1080
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,400
Speaker 11:  matter is cuz it's like you have like people who don't pay enough attention

1081
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,280
Speaker 11:  to this who get something like home and then they're like, oh but

1082
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,640
Speaker 11:  this is a wifi bulb, shouldn't it work? And then they're like, no, you have

1083
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,080
Speaker 11:  to get this other one. And it's like, that's more frustrating to me.

1084
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:55,280
Speaker 11:  Like that is an actual point of pain for like normal consumers and

1085
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,000
Speaker 11:  it goes against the whole, it's just easy. It's like, yeah, it's just easy

1086
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,600
Speaker 11:  but you have to get a thing that you use all the time and like it, it's

1087
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,560
Speaker 11:  that that's, I'm sorry, I I'm done with that. I'm re I really, and

1088
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,760
Speaker 11:  I do think that like the very fact that that it took this long to get this

1089
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,600
Speaker 11:  little puck says a lot that it does this a lot cuz it's something that like

1090
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,560
Speaker 11:  upwards of decades that it was just like, I just want a thing that you plug

1091
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,880
Speaker 11:  into a speaker and it works and it's, and it works over wifi has been like

1092
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:22,440
Speaker 11:  upwards of a decade of just people being like, oh you can get that, but

1093
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,240
Speaker 11:  it's like you gotta get this like blue node amp and like it's expensive

1094
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,760
Speaker 11:  but it works. And it's like, it's just more niche

1095
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,520
Speaker 11:  versions of that. And then like somebody was like, oh okay here's a Texas

1096
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,040
Speaker 11:  instrument stack we put with in like a Nordic instruments within an Nordic

1097
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,720
Speaker 11:  instruments chip or whatever. It's like it's very, it wasn't that hard and

1098
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,960
Speaker 11:  the fact, and it's like clown carve stuff to me it's like all these people

1099
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:47,360
Speaker 11:  trying to like do solve all these problems when there was this one demand

1100
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,160
Speaker 11:  that people wanted. And when I posted that article, somebody responded with,

1101
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:53,960
Speaker 11:  I just did my system entirely Sonos and now I am regretting it

1102
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,520
Speaker 11:  because this is what I wanted because they were funneled into it.

1103
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,600
Speaker 10:  Yeah, that's exactly why I think, I mean, Chris, you're right people now

1104
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,480
Speaker 10:  when they buy Sonos, they go Sonos. But because you kind of have to, I

1105
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,160
Speaker 10:  think Sonos would actually open itself up to a wider market, which is what's

1106
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,920
Speaker 10:  happened with Matter. That's why everyone got together with Matter because

1107
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,600
Speaker 10:  they're like, I think this is gonna bring the smart home to a wider market.

1108
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,440
Speaker 10:  But if you could, if you already have five decent

1109
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,120
Speaker 10:  speakers around your home, like a few echo dots and maybe an Echo studio

1110
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:27,280
Speaker 10:  and you want a soundbar, you're not gonna go buy a Sonos because

1111
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,800
Speaker 10:  it's not gonna you, you're not gonna able to connect it with your other

1112
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,440
Speaker 10:  speakers in the same way in this multi room audio way. But if Sonos worked

1113
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,800
Speaker 10:  with those other speakers, you might go buy it. So, you know, I feel like,

1114
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:41,200
Speaker 10:  I mean, right, it works great for people that are happy to either do an

1115
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,080
Speaker 10:  entire system in Sonos or swap out what they already have and get Sonos.

1116
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,800
Speaker 10:  But if you wanna add to what you have or if you wanna start small and

1117
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,440
Speaker 10:  build but wanna have options, you can't really do that. I mean you can to

1118
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,040
Speaker 10:  some extent, but it's not easy as we've illustrated. We, we know the technology's

1119
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,000
Speaker 10:  there and we just, I feel like the companies, I understand

1120
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,400
Speaker 10:  that they've got their proprietary technology or their, you know, they want

1121
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,280
Speaker 10:  to kind of keep you in their system but giving consumers choice is never

1122
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,280
Speaker 10:  gonna be a bad thing in the long run. I think if you've got a good enough

1123
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,720
Speaker 10:  product, they will come to you if you give them that flexibility.

1124
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:17,480
Speaker 10:  You know, at the end of all this, I have probably 20

1125
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,360
Speaker 10:  smarts because in my house and I've, and paid for an

1126
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,720
Speaker 10:  entire Sono system because my husband loves it

1127
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,600
Speaker 10:  and because it just works and he gets so frustrated with stuff that doesn't

1128
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,000
Speaker 10:  work and he, I remember when I first started working at The Verge, he's

1129
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,880
Speaker 10:  like, does that mean you're not gonna get to test any cool audio equipment

1130
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,680
Speaker 10:  anymore? I'm like, no. I said, if you want that, you're just gonna have

1131
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,560
Speaker 10:  to move in with Chris

1132
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:40,600
Speaker 10:  because,

1133
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:46,360
Speaker 10:  And so, you know, for Christmas I got him the beam and then this Christmas

1134
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,120
Speaker 10:  I got him the big sub thing and he loves it and it just

1135
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:50,400
Speaker 10:  works.

1136
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,400
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna say this like, you know, we can rag on on Sonos audio

1137
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:58,200
Speaker 2:  quality compared to like similarly price dumb

1138
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,000
Speaker 2:  speakers, but that sub is mighty good.

1139
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,040
Speaker 11:  Put a sub in two play fives together.

1140
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:06,240
Speaker 10:  A whole house shakes

1141
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:10,560
Speaker 2:  So much money on that sub. Well it's good because like a lot of times subs

1142
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,040
Speaker 2:  could be kind of, I guess the word it's floppy, right? Like the base is there,

1143
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,920
Speaker 2:  but it, it overwhelms and it's a good tight, like it's, it's a, it it really

1144
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,640
Speaker 2:  controls its base really, really nicely. So it never overwhelms

1145
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,160
Speaker 2:  but it still gives you that kind of like in your chest rumble when

1146
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,600
Speaker 2:  whatever's happening in Dune is happening.

1147
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:30,520
Speaker 9:  So we covered the S one and S two stuff. I think they handled that poorly.

1148
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:33,240
Speaker 9:  They could've handled that better, but like they still have the S one app

1149
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:37,200
Speaker 9:  available. Like, so think of Apple or Amazon maintaining the old version

1150
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,680
Speaker 9:  of their service, like just to keep old hardware running. It's kind of

1151
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,480
Speaker 9:  unthinkable, right? So like, I think like they only cut off actually one

1152
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,440
Speaker 9:  or two like ancient speakers. Like even the play three, I just died outta

1153
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,640
Speaker 9:  the office yesterday. That's on S two that's got, you know, like all the

1154
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,360
Speaker 9:  current stuff.

1155
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:55,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah, the, the play base was kind of their first weird

1156
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:59,200
Speaker 2:  attempt at at a, at a speaker, right? A flop, different kinda

1157
01:05:59,200 --> 01:05:59,800
Speaker 2:  soundbar. I know

1158
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,880
Speaker 9:  That's still fully supported

1159
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,880
Speaker 2:  And it's fully supported and that was one of those things that like has kept

1160
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,480
Speaker 2:  me on Sonos as long as it has is because it, that is supported. I, I'm not

1161
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:11,400
Speaker 2:  having to look the minute that stops working because of

1162
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,120
Speaker 2:  of, you know, something happens at Sonos, I'm out of that ecosystem cuz it's

1163
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:19,000
Speaker 2:  like right, I I now know that the whim exists and if I go and

1164
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,040
Speaker 2:  I get my own speakers and I plug them into the whim, I can have that same

1165
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,240
Speaker 2:  experience that with Sonos I would have to go and get all my own speakers

1166
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,400
Speaker 2:  and then plug it into, is it the

1167
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,640
Speaker 9:  Connect and the amp too?

1168
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,520
Speaker 2:  Yep. Yeah and the amp you can add all of your audio stuff but it's

1169
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,880
Speaker 2:  cost like four or $500 and the whim cost. How much Chris?

1170
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,640
Speaker 11:  It's 80 or 90 I think. I think they may have, they it was

1171
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,560
Speaker 11:  on sale and then they like uns sailed it while I bought the article. So

1172
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,320
Speaker 11:  it's like eight or 90.

1173
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,000
Speaker 10:  I bet they did.

1174
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:46,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah, they're like, excuse

1175
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:50,640
Speaker 11:  Us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry but like, yeah, no, it's, it's cheap, you

1176
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,480
Speaker 11:  know what I mean? And if it, it's cool because like even though it has like

1177
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,800
Speaker 11:  it has an okay d you know what I mean? It's like, it's like just a ti chip

1178
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,840
Speaker 11:  it Carly costs like five bucks or something like that. Yeah. But like, because

1179
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,160
Speaker 11:  it has optical audio, if you have, if you're the kind of person who wants

1180
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,840
Speaker 11:  their own deck, you just put the optical into whatever

1181
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,120
Speaker 11:  good deck you have and then it will do the conversion there. Which is part

1182
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,560
Speaker 11:  of the reason why guys on forms like it's cuz it's bit perfect and it

1183
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,520
Speaker 11:  transfers it without recoding it just straight up like this is the

1184
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,760
Speaker 11:  file here, you go to whatever DAK digital to

1185
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,080
Speaker 11:  audio converter you have and like yeah, it's, it's a component. It's a part,

1186
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,920
Speaker 11:  you know what I mean? Like I guess this is also like, I don't like sound

1187
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,280
Speaker 11:  bars. Like I'm, I'm, I'm anti soundbar for the same

1188
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,320
Speaker 2:  Reason. I'm shocked that you don't like sound bars

1189
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:36,280
Speaker 11:  But it's the same thing. Yeah, of course. But like, but it's the

1190
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,400
Speaker 11:  same thing where it's this like too clever by half thing, right? Where it's

1191
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,320
Speaker 11:  like either I'm going to listen to my TV with the speakers that are inside

1192
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,120
Speaker 11:  of it or I'm going to get real speakers, you know? Yeah. Like

1193
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,280
Speaker 11:  it's it's it's one or the other even though I understand the form factor.

1194
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:54,320
Speaker 10:  No, I mean and Sonos does have a, like you point out though, they do have

1195
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,240
Speaker 10:  a good ecosystem. Like I bought the original Is it s what

1196
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,520
Speaker 10:  what's the original little small speaker that's now the sl?

1197
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,280
Speaker 2:  It's the one

1198
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,640
Speaker 10:  Yeah, just the one originally. Yeah. Yeah. So I have two of those that are,

1199
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:09,240
Speaker 10:  they're my rear and then I bought the, is it the Beam is the most expensive

1200
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:10,240
Speaker 10:  or is the arc

1201
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,160
Speaker 9:  Dark? The

1202
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,880
Speaker 10:  Arc. So we have the arc samba and then we added the, the big boom boom

1203
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,880
Speaker 10:  boom. But those two ones I've had since like they

1204
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,600
Speaker 10:  came out what like in the early two thousands. I mean how long have they

1205
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,520
Speaker 10:  been around? So that is great. You are able to use all those parts

1206
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,600
Speaker 10:  together and that they haven't deprecated them. But as you say, if that,

1207
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,400
Speaker 10:  that time comes, which is the problem with all of these

1208
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,000
Speaker 10:  speakers though, I mean we hit hard on this in the version we should, but

1209
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,960
Speaker 10:  you know, we need to know the lifespan of our technology. Like when you

1210
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,440
Speaker 10:  buy it, there should be like an expiration date you, so you can be aware

1211
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,320
Speaker 10:  of how long you're gonna have this product in your house. So that helps

1212
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,920
Speaker 10:  you figure out whether it's actually worth spending, you know, $800 on a,

1213
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:53,760
Speaker 10:  on an arc. Because there's been too many instances recently of companies

1214
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,720
Speaker 10:  coming up saying, oh well we've decided that's just gonna last for another

1215
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:00,080
Speaker 10:  year and then you're out of luck. And, and that's another one of the consumer

1216
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,920
Speaker 10:  frustrations and this is another area where Matter could help because

1217
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,520
Speaker 10:  you know, you could more easily replace a device, not have to spend the

1218
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,280
Speaker 10:  same amount of money and still have the same experience. So

1219
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:15,160
Speaker 10:  it, it's a tricky situation and there is no, unfortunately right now

1220
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,320
Speaker 10:  I don't feel like there is the perfect solution.

1221
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:18,720
Speaker 11:  I think we've got it

1222
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,440
Speaker 10:  Though. Yeah. But I just don't honestly see a lot of regular people going

1223
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,000
Speaker 10:  out and spending 80 or $90 on this. I can't see my parents

1224
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,760
Speaker 10:  buying this and figuring out how to use it even if it is really easy.

1225
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,080
Speaker 11:  But that's, this is the thing, it's like it's, it's, I've used it, it has

1226
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,280
Speaker 11:  a really nice app. It's not that more more difficult. It's just the idea

1227
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,160
Speaker 11:  of like we, I'm, I'm sorry this is just baked into the concept of the

1228
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,720
Speaker 11:  all-in-one. Like I don't know, I go on gov deals a lot, which is like

1229
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,520
Speaker 11:  government auction sites and I just see all the technology waste going like

1230
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,320
Speaker 11:  you know like I walked into an e e-waste recycling center recently and it

1231
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,040
Speaker 11:  was just racks and racks of Apple TVs and like you know these

1232
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,800
Speaker 11:  things that like people like buy and then they're like oh

1233
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,040
Speaker 11:  it's broken, what do I do with it? And like the more all in one you make

1234
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,360
Speaker 11:  it the more waste you're gonna make. That's just how it works. You know

1235
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,560
Speaker 11:  what I mean? Because we don't live in a culture anymore where these things

1236
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,080
Speaker 11:  can be discreet and we don't live in, in a thing where it's prioritized

1237
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,440
Speaker 11:  that like you know, you're gonna have a speaker and if the speaker breaks

1238
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,720
Speaker 11:  well you go and get it fixed. You know, or you fix it yourself ideally,

1239
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,120
Speaker 11:  which is what I would love is just people learning how to fix their own

1240
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,960
Speaker 11:  stuff. Like the more all in one you make something, the worse

1241
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,960
Speaker 11:  it's gonna be for the environment. Just generally speaking, the worse it's

1242
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,280
Speaker 11:  gonna be for people because they're gonna throw shit away and they're gonna

1243
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,080
Speaker 11:  like no, just just get back to like having a thing that does a thing and

1244
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,360
Speaker 11:  then a thing you can add to a little system and simplify it for people.

1245
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,800
Speaker 11:  And I think that there is a use case for that. Don't make it so that like

1246
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,040
Speaker 11:  there are these virtual things like even if you accept the all in one element

1247
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,200
Speaker 11:  of it, don't make it so that you also have to make it so that people throw

1248
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,960
Speaker 11:  stuff away cuz it doesn't work with their other stuff. Cuz that's a thing

1249
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,600
Speaker 11:  that a mom will do is just throw it away cuz it doesn't work with their

1250
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,920
Speaker 11:  thing and they're like, well what's this then I'll give it to Goodwill or

1251
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,120
Speaker 11:  something.

1252
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,880
Speaker 10:  Chris Welch, what do you, what is your ultimate system? What do you use

1253
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,400
Speaker 10:  for multi room music? Like when you aren't testing stuff?

1254
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:05,520
Speaker 9:  I mean I've got a pretty small apartment here in Brooklyn so I've got the

1255
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,000
Speaker 9:  Sonos five on my desk play five. I bought that several years ago. It still

1256
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,480
Speaker 9:  sounds amazing. I've got the arc for my soundbar. I think so many people

1257
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,160
Speaker 9:  just want pretty good, like Chris said, there's like a low end and a super

1258
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:19,040
Speaker 9:  high end at the middle. I think Sonos also shoots for the pretty to very

1259
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,800
Speaker 9:  good range with the arc. Like there would be no market for a $900 Sonos arc

1260
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,640
Speaker 9:  if it didn't sound pretty good, there would be no market for a $1,400

1261
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,760
Speaker 9:  Sennheiser soundbar that I'm, that I'm testing right now if they didn't like

1262
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,920
Speaker 9:  actually blow people away in some sense. So I think, yeah so

1263
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,800
Speaker 9:  I've got that and I've got the room for the shower and so I like my

1264
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,960
Speaker 9:  shower tunes and the move, if I go work in the backyard on a nice day,

1265
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:43,240
Speaker 10:  I feel like no one's really cracked the shower.

1266
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,680
Speaker 9:  Sonos has said they're gonna be in four new product categories over the next

1267
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,240
Speaker 9:  few years so maybe a shower, shower head speaker.

1268
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:54,920
Speaker 11:  I do agree though that like that that is probably the most compelling app.

1269
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,440
Speaker 11:  The the, the room is actually probably the, the thing that like works the

1270
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,120
Speaker 11:  best cuz like the HomePod minis don't you have to plug into a wall

1271
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,400
Speaker 11:  and like some people just like have one plugged into the wall in their bathroom

1272
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,680
Speaker 11:  or something. Like they have little mounts for them and stuff which is

1273
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,520
Speaker 10:  Yeah I've seen there's like mounts in the ceiling.

1274
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,080
Speaker 11:  Yeah or like you can just do weird stuff like that. But like I do agree

1275
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,080
Speaker 11:  that like airplane two devices that work

1276
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,000
Speaker 11:  well that are battery powered is a, a thing that

1277
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,600
Speaker 11:  I'm surprised Apple has not tackled yet but in part because it probably

1278
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,760
Speaker 11:  messes with their HomePod demographic but like and also like there's plenty

1279
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,080
Speaker 11:  of Bluetooth speakers, they don't need to like make another one unless it

1280
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,400
Speaker 11:  has like a really strong use case but they are making that weird mirror

1281
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:35,600
Speaker 11:  and that weird or that weird. What is it like iPads that are

1282
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,880
Speaker 11:  like for the kitchen? I think they were, that was reported on.

1283
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,920
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah, that's the, that's the rumor I think is that there's gonna be like

1284
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,800
Speaker 2:  a HomePod with an iPad attached to it and we're all gonna

1285
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,680
Speaker 2:  have 'em in our kitchen to make the best pies ever Apple presumably.

1286
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:52,400
Speaker 10:  I do think the battery power is an interesting, like Amazon got out of the

1287
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,120
Speaker 10:  battery powered speaker space. They had the tap which was, I love that thing

1288
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:00,080
Speaker 10:  and the Bowes portable speaker is very good but very

1289
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:00,760
Speaker 10:  expensive

1290
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:04,480
Speaker 9:  So, but the Sonos move like you can buy a battery pack and swap it out

1291
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:07,720
Speaker 9:  so when that battery builtin dies you can like keep it going so that's kind

1292
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,600
Speaker 9:  of nice. Not something you see very often. So I think they do a

1293
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,160
Speaker 9:  pretty decent job of like guaranteeing a pretty long lifespan for most of

1294
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,480
Speaker 9:  their products. I dunno how the room's gonna be doing in like two years after

1295
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,400
Speaker 9:  the battery's been charged a hundred times. But

1296
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,440
Speaker 2:  Yeah I think that'll be a really interesting one for Sonos to deal with.

1297
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,800
Speaker 2:  That's cuz it's their first battery based product, right?

1298
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,960
Speaker 9:  Yeah that and the move, but you can swap out that battery. But yeah, I'm

1299
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,320
Speaker 9:  pretty excited for what's gonna be coming up cause they just bought a company

1300
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:33,640
Speaker 9:  in 2020 called Matt or Mate that makes like super small

1301
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,880
Speaker 9:  transducers that put out big sound in a really small design

1302
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,680
Speaker 9:  and we haven't seen the fruits of that purchase yet but maybe this

1303
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:41,880
Speaker 9:  year.

1304
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,400
Speaker 2:  Okay, well it sounds like we've kind of, we've kind of gotten gotten a lay

1305
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,240
Speaker 2:  of the land. We know there's all this stuff like they're the smart speakers

1306
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,560
Speaker 2:  and, and they're all doing their thing and they're doing it pretty well.

1307
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,360
Speaker 2:  There is Sonos who does it really, really well if you are willing to spend

1308
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:59,320
Speaker 2:  a lot of money. And then there is the whim and Roone audio, which

1309
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,360
Speaker 2:  honestly sounds like Sonos. But for me, I am gonna go be basic and spend

1310
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,400
Speaker 2:  money on it maybe. But it sounds like there's a lot of solutions out there.

1311
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,160
Speaker 2:  Nothing's perfect. Please go fix matter,

1312
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:14,160
Speaker 2:  Sonos and, and Bose if you hear this, get your guys in the room

1313
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:18,040
Speaker 2:  with the other matter folks, let's, let's get on this, let's fix this.

1314
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,920
Speaker 11:  Give airplay two away Apple cuz what are you doing with it? Yes,

1315
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,760
Speaker 11:  that would be the other solution. It would literally only benefit you to

1316
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,520
Speaker 11:  open that ecosystem up. I'm not joking.

1317
