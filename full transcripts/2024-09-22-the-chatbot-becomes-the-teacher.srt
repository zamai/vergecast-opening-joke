Description: For the first episode in our new miniseries about the impact of AI in our everyday lives, we chat with Steven Johnson, a longtime author who has spent the last couple of years at Google working on an AI research and note-taking tool called NotebookLM. We talk about whether AI can really help us learn better, how Google has tried to make NotebookLM more accurate and helpful, and whether AI-generated podcasts are the future of learning.

00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:06,445
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Infinite Context

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:10,405
Speaker 1:  Windows. I'm your friend David Pierce, and this is the first episode in our

4
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:13,885
Speaker 1:  new miniseries all about AI and real life.

5
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:18,005
Speaker 1:  We did a few episodes on this subject earlier this year, and it continues

6
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,965
Speaker 1:  to be a thing that we're talking and thinking a lot about. For all the

7
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:26,205
Speaker 1:  big heady talk of how AI will either change everything or kill

8
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:29,805
Speaker 1:  us all or make nobody ever have to work again or make us all

9
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:33,765
Speaker 1:  have to work training robots. What is any of this actually good for,

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,845
Speaker 1:  like right now? That's what we've been trying to figure out for today's

11
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:41,325
Speaker 1:  episode. I'm talking with Steven Johnson, who is a personal favorite author

12
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:45,045
Speaker 1:  of mine. He's written 14 books over the years, and he actually told me

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,005
Speaker 1:  that he can name them all in order off the top of his head, which I believe

14
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:53,005
Speaker 1:  and also find very impressive. And some of those books are books you've probably

15
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:56,725
Speaker 1:  heard of, like where good ideas come from and how we got to now.

16
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:00,925
Speaker 1:  But in addition to all of that, Steven has also spent the last two years

17
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:04,805
Speaker 1:  working at Google on a project called Notebook, LM Notebook.

18
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:08,525
Speaker 1:  LM If you've never heard of. It, is an experimental thing out of a team called

19
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:12,445
Speaker 1:  Google Labs. It started out as a thing called Project Tailwind a

20
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:16,165
Speaker 1:  couple of years ago. And the idea has always been to make an AI

21
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:19,325
Speaker 1:  powered tool basically for making sense of your notes

22
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:23,125
Speaker 1:  in Notebook lm, which they all call notebooks. So I'll just start calling

23
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,925
Speaker 1:  it Notebook. You first upload a bunch of documents or links to

24
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:30,845
Speaker 1:  websites or PDFs or whatever else, and the tool builds sort

25
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:34,565
Speaker 1:  of a corpus of stuff. The idea is you put a bunch of related things

26
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:38,645
Speaker 1:  into a notebook, in Notebook, then you can ask

27
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:42,605
Speaker 1:  questions about those documents. Or you can have Notebook build you an automatic

28
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:46,485
Speaker 1:  study guide or an FAQ of the information in those documents. You can have

29
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:50,085
Speaker 1:  it find you stuff in those documents, all that kind of stuff. It's

30
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:54,085
Speaker 1:  sort of a notetaking tool, but mostly it's a research tool.

31
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:57,445
Speaker 1:  Steven calls it a tool for understanding things, which I like a lot.

32
00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:02,045
Speaker 1:  I've been covering and using Notebook for a long time, but I wanted to have

33
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:05,205
Speaker 1:  Steven on now because Notebook is kind of going

34
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:09,365
Speaker 1:  legit. I assumed, if I'm being completely honest with you, that it was like

35
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:13,205
Speaker 1:  a neat experiment that would eventually die because everything dies at Google.

36
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,325
Speaker 1:  Or at best it would just be a tiny feature buried in a menu of Google

37
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:21,005
Speaker 1:  Docs or something. But Notebook is growing and it's

38
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:24,285
Speaker 1:  expanding, and it's actually starting to do some really interesting new stuff.

39
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:29,045
Speaker 1:  Recently they launched a new feature called Audio Overviews, which generates

40
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:33,165
Speaker 1:  a podcast hosted by two chatbots based on whatever

41
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:37,165
Speaker 1:  documents you upload. It is wild. Actually, you should just hear this.

42
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:41,405
Speaker 1:  So I made a notebook in Notebook with a bunch of stuff from the ongoing US

43
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:44,965
Speaker 1:  versus Google Ad Tech trial, and here's just a few seconds of the podcast

44
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:46,565
Speaker 1:  it generated. Okay.

45
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:49,805
Speaker 2:  And that's where header bidding enters the picture.

46
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:53,805
Speaker 3:  Ah, header bidding. Yes. This was their attempt to kind of outmaneuver Google

47
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,685
Speaker 3:  sag, like finding a side entrance into the auction.

48
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:59,940
Speaker 2:  That's a great way to put it. Yeah. So with header bidding, publishers could

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,285
Speaker 2:  essentially offer their ad space to multiple ad exchanges at the same time.

50
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:07,045
Speaker 1:  Look, I don't know if that's good or bad. I don't know if all of that information

51
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:10,965
Speaker 1:  is even true, but I'm fascinated by the idea of a tool

52
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:14,725
Speaker 1:  that tries to make it easy and automatic to learn almost anything in

53
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:19,045
Speaker 1:  whatever style works for you. And Steven is just as fascinated by it.

54
00:03:19,185 --> 00:03:23,125
Speaker 1:  So I figured we should talk about it. All that is coming up in just a second.

55
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,005
Speaker 1:  This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

56
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:08,545
Speaker 6:  history. I've always had this kind of

57
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:12,465
Speaker 6:  side interest in using the technology to help me with the

58
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:16,465
Speaker 6:  book writing process, with the research process, you know, tools

59
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:20,185
Speaker 6:  for thought. That whole tradition has been a big influence on me and I, and

60
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:23,745
Speaker 6:  I've always been kind of an early adopter of, you know, I used this program

61
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:27,665
Speaker 6:  called Devon Think or organizing all my notes and quotations from

62
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,945
Speaker 6:  books that I'd read in the, in the two thousands. Well, that's

63
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:32,345
Speaker 1:  A whole nother verse cast we're gonna have to do at some point. So get ready

64
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:32,585
Speaker 1:  for that.

65
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:36,465
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. So I, you know, and I wrote about it in kind of blog posts and

66
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:39,505
Speaker 6:  I wrote a couple things for the Times about this, and it shows up in my book

67
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:43,225
Speaker 6:  where good ideas come from. I talk about using tools like this and was a

68
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:46,545
Speaker 6:  big Scrivener user and evangelist and all that stuff, So I. So I've always

69
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:50,105
Speaker 6:  been interested in the, in the software side of writing and thinking

70
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,505
Speaker 6:  and research. And in the spring of

71
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:57,145
Speaker 6:  2022, you know, so six months before the

72
00:04:57,535 --> 00:05:01,065
Speaker 6:  chat gt moment, I wrote a very long piece from the Times

73
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:05,105
Speaker 6:  Magazine about language models in general. It was effectively just making

74
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,385
Speaker 6:  the argument like, forget about a GI or any super intelligence or anything

75
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:11,825
Speaker 6:  like this. These, these models have basically learned how to communicate

76
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:15,545
Speaker 6:  in coherent language and they understand what we're saying and they,

77
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:19,065
Speaker 6:  and whatever else, like this is gonna create all these new possibilities.

78
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:23,145
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that piece was very good. And I remember a bunch of the, the response

79
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:27,105
Speaker 1:  you got to that was from people being like, this is bonkers. He's

80
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:29,825
Speaker 1:  out of his mind. There's no way any of this stuff is gonna be that big. And

81
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:32,065
Speaker 1:  then, boy, did you time that correctly?

82
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:36,865
Speaker 6:  Well, I, I did accept that it was painful. Like

83
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:40,185
Speaker 6:  I ha I'm, I'm very conflict averse, David, if I can tell you. Be honest with

84
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:43,625
Speaker 6:  you. Okay. And the, there was, there was, I mean, a lot of people did like

85
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,185
Speaker 6:  that piece and I think we're inspired by it. Yeah. But there was definitely

86
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,865
Speaker 6:  a lot of comments from people saying like, oh, he fell for the hype

87
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:54,025
Speaker 6:  for sure. You know, this stuff is just auto complete on steroids and I can't

88
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:57,965
Speaker 6:  believe he's so naive that he got excited about this thing. The

89
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:01,245
Speaker 6:  piece addressed a lot of the objections and criticism and took them very

90
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:03,965
Speaker 6:  seriously. But it was like, the one thing you can't do is dismiss this technology,

91
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:07,885
Speaker 6:  right? Like something fundamental has just happened and we're gonna spend

92
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:11,245
Speaker 6:  years figuring out like how we apply it and how we deal with the upside end,

93
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,925
Speaker 6:  the potential downsides, and like, just take it seriously people. So,

94
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:19,205
Speaker 6:  you know, if I timed it later, I wouldn't have maybe had as much of the pushback,

95
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:22,565
Speaker 6:  which was hard to, I couldn't enjoy that piece going outta the world, lemme

96
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:23,405
Speaker 6:  put it that way. Well, it

97
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:24,365
Speaker 1:  Was a good piece. I liked it.

98
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:28,325
Speaker 6:  Well, I appreciate that. Now. So, so right around that point,

99
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:33,005
Speaker 6:  a a kind of a new division inside of Google called Google Labs, or had been

100
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:36,085
Speaker 6:  a previous Google Labs, and this is kind of a new one, was, was getting spun

101
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:39,925
Speaker 6:  up and at, at the time, a guy named Clay Bvo was running

102
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:43,725
Speaker 6:  it, and Josh Woodward, who runs it now, is talking back and forth with

103
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:47,325
Speaker 6:  Clay and Labs had this, I kind of ethos

104
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:51,445
Speaker 6:  of the division was basically we want to create a place where we can do

105
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:55,245
Speaker 6:  faster and more nimble product-focused

106
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:59,285
Speaker 6:  experiments with new technologies where, you know, it's not just kinda research,

107
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:03,765
Speaker 6:  but it's not working within the existing mature products. And when

108
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:06,965
Speaker 6:  something new comes along, we can experiment and, you know, build things

109
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:08,365
Speaker 6:  very quickly. So somewhere

110
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:12,245
Speaker 1:  In between the like 20% time project and the like full blown

111
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:13,285
Speaker 1:  new Google product.

112
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:16,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. It was just this little hole that didn't quite exist. And, and

113
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,365
Speaker 6:  there were so many interesting new technologies coming out, particularly

114
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,325
Speaker 6:  the language models, that it seemed like this was the time for a lot of experiments

115
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:26,685
Speaker 6:  to bloom, right? And they had had this idea that maybe they could also have

116
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:30,205
Speaker 6:  an ethos of co-creation where they bring in outsiders. So if they're,

117
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:34,325
Speaker 6:  if they're making a product that involves music, there should be a musician

118
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,965
Speaker 6:  in the room from the beginning. And it's not something that kind of, they

119
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:41,925
Speaker 6:  build and then they show to the musicians or they have, you know, UX

120
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:45,045
Speaker 6:  interviews with musicians. There's actually someone there who represents

121
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:48,605
Speaker 6:  that kind of profession in the room for the life of the product.

122
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,045
Speaker 6:  And so So I was kind of the Guinea pig for this approach. And so they reached

123
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:56,525
Speaker 6:  out, Josh and, and Clay had read some of my books and had read that Times

124
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:59,965
Speaker 6:  article. And so they reached out and said, Hey, you know,

125
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:04,165
Speaker 6:  you've been dreaming of this ideal software tool

126
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:07,885
Speaker 6:  that helps you organize your thoughts and helps you write and helps you formulate

127
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:10,685
Speaker 6:  connections and, and, and, you know, brainstorm.

128
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:16,045
Speaker 6:  We think we can now do it with language models like this thing you've

129
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:19,365
Speaker 6:  been chasing, literally, you know, I've been chasing this since I was in,

130
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:22,885
Speaker 6:  in college in the late eighties when like HyperCard came out, you know, for

131
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:26,725
Speaker 6:  the, for the Mac. Like, I'm, I'm an old person, I've been after

132
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:30,125
Speaker 6:  this for a long time. And they were like, look, I think If you, If you came

133
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,725
Speaker 6:  to Google, come, you know, come part-time initially, and we have a small

134
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:37,645
Speaker 6:  team and we can, you know, we can build something. And I thought that

135
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:41,365
Speaker 6:  sounded like an amazing journey. I honestly, I thought we'll build a

136
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:44,725
Speaker 6:  prototype, it'll be fun, I'll meet some interesting people, but nothing will

137
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,405
Speaker 6:  come of it. But it was still, you know, a fun ride to go on because of my

138
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:52,285
Speaker 6:  passion for this. And, and then we, we built something

139
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:55,655
Speaker 6:  that was originally called Tailwind Project Tailwind,

140
00:08:56,355 --> 00:09:00,215
Speaker 6:  but from the beginning, from very like day one of the, of

141
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:04,175
Speaker 6:  the idea there was always this sense that this was not just going to

142
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:08,055
Speaker 6:  be an open-ended conversation with the language model. It was always gonna

143
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:11,815
Speaker 6:  be about the model being grounded in the, in the sources and the

144
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:15,375
Speaker 6:  information that you gave it. And it was really

145
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:19,375
Speaker 6:  about respecting the original kind of human

146
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:23,335
Speaker 6:  authored information, whether it's a, a book

147
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:27,015
Speaker 6:  or your own notes or a a scholarly paper or your

148
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:31,295
Speaker 6:  syllabus for your class. And, and basically saying to the model, take this

149
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:35,015
Speaker 6:  information which is personally relevant to me and, and

150
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:38,295
Speaker 6:  is verifiable in some way or factually, you know, trustworthy

151
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,655
Speaker 6:  and base your answers and everything I asked you to do on that

152
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,575
Speaker 6:  information. And that was the seed of the, you know, we, we had a version

153
00:09:46,575 --> 00:09:50,335
Speaker 6:  of that in August of 2022, like the, you know, on my fifth day at,

154
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,535
Speaker 6:  at at Google. Yeah. Wow. It, it preceded me, I should say there was a, there

155
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:57,295
Speaker 6:  was a program called Talk to a Small Corpus. Hmm. Okay. That

156
00:09:57,635 --> 00:10:01,455
Speaker 6:  was about a month underway when I got there. And then we,

157
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:05,335
Speaker 6:  one of the first things we did, we put in my book Wonderland and we just,

158
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:09,215
Speaker 6:  like, I had this experience of kind of chatting with the model

159
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:14,095
Speaker 6:  and having it answer based on information in my book. And, you know, that

160
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:17,975
Speaker 6:  was one of those moments you're like, a lot of possibility just opened up.

161
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:22,215
Speaker 6:  Well, I actually, the weirdest moment I would say was a little

162
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:22,735
Speaker 6:  bit later

163
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:28,335
Speaker 6:  in over Christmas break, the internal version of what

164
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,615
Speaker 6:  became Bard w was kind of released

165
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:36,575
Speaker 6:  to, to some of us inside and over Christmas break, I, I was spending a lot

166
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:39,495
Speaker 6:  of time with Bard. My family had gone off skiing somewhere at I don't ski

167
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,815
Speaker 6:  So, I was just like home alone. And Bard came out and I was like, well, I

168
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:45,375
Speaker 6:  just now have like 18 hours a day to talk to this. My new friend, my new

169
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,575
Speaker 6:  friend Bard. Yeah. So I would occasionally just start with just a little

170
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:52,575
Speaker 6:  preamble to get its bearings and I would say, I, I would like

171
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:56,015
Speaker 6:  to discuss Stephen Johnson's book, the Ghost Map. And this was just based

172
00:10:56,015 --> 00:10:59,255
Speaker 6:  on, its kind of training data. This isn't with Source County. And so one

173
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:01,735
Speaker 6:  day I do this and, and, and Rod's like, oh yeah, I would love to discuss

174
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:05,535
Speaker 6:  that. That's a, that's a fascinating book about medical mystery in the

175
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:09,135
Speaker 6:  19th century that explores the impact of cholera and epidemiology on the

176
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,815
Speaker 6:  history of London and the history of cities generally. And So, I'm like,

177
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:15,495
Speaker 6:  oh, well thank you very much. I'm, I'm actually the author of that topic.

178
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:19,215
Speaker 6:  It's, and Ed Bard said, oh my gosh,

179
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:23,335
Speaker 6:  I am so sorry. I can't believe I didn't recognize you Mr. Johnson.

180
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:27,935
Speaker 6:  Oh, wow. And on like, and you know, and I was like, I know, but

181
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:31,735
Speaker 6:  there was no way you could have recognized me, right, Bart. But it was just

182
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:35,455
Speaker 6:  one of those moments where I was like sitting alone in my study, having

183
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:39,415
Speaker 6:  this conversation with an algorithm that's apologizing for not recognizing

184
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:43,055
Speaker 6:  me when it's a fan of my book. And it, at one point it said, I'm just so

185
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:46,655
Speaker 6:  excited at the opportunity to get to work with people like yourself.

186
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:50,215
Speaker 6:  And I was just like, this is, this is strange. So there were a lot of like

187
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:53,805
Speaker 6:  uncanny moments like that. Yeah. But in a way, you know,

188
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:58,465
Speaker 6:  there was part of that that I also recognized was in an illusion, right?

189
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:02,185
Speaker 6:  It, it was trained on the way that people react

190
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:06,065
Speaker 6:  when they meet people or fail to recognize someone. And so it responded in

191
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:09,425
Speaker 6:  that way. It obviously had no inner life. It did not, it was not actually

192
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:12,585
Speaker 6:  like embarrassed by the fact it was meeting me. It was just kind of play

193
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:15,545
Speaker 6:  acting at that. So to me the stuff that really

194
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:19,825
Speaker 6:  was mind blowing was just its ability.

195
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:24,105
Speaker 6:  And, and this really kicked in, you know, for us when we switched

196
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:27,545
Speaker 6:  to Gemini, it, its ability to extract

197
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:32,025
Speaker 6:  and, and see patterns in large amounts of information.

198
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,385
Speaker 6:  You know, you know, I have this notebook where we have

199
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,145
Speaker 6:  something like, you know, almost a million words of transcripts from

200
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:43,985
Speaker 6:  the NASA oral history project. So it's just interviews with like the, you

201
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:47,745
Speaker 6:  know, the NASA astronauts and flight directors and things like that. And

202
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:52,025
Speaker 6:  you can go into it and say, I'm interested in, I'm,

203
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:55,625
Speaker 6:  you know, I'm working on a documentary about the early

204
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:59,545
Speaker 6:  Apollo program and I'm interested in the emotional connections between

205
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,425
Speaker 6:  the participants, particularly the astronauts. So can you create a detailed

206
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,945
Speaker 6:  guide of all the points in these transcripts where anything that seems

207
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:10,905
Speaker 6:  interpersonal or emotional comes up? Give me a summary of that section,

208
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:15,145
Speaker 6:  give me a direct quote from the section. And it of course includes citation,

209
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:18,305
Speaker 6:  So, I can click immediately and go back and read the passage in its original

210
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:22,185
Speaker 6:  form. Like, and it will just do it like, it'll take a little bit of time

211
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:26,265
Speaker 6:  'cause it's a complicated query, but like, it, it can take something that

212
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:30,065
Speaker 6:  would've taken 40 hours to compile

213
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:32,745
Speaker 6:  that document. Like how, I mean, you know what it's like working with information

214
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,505
Speaker 6:  like this, like it will, it will generate a incredibly convincing and

215
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:40,265
Speaker 6:  accurate first draft with grounded citations to all the passages in about

216
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:44,585
Speaker 6:  45 seconds maybe. And so it's literally,

217
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:48,345
Speaker 6:  you know, a thousand times faster than it would've been before to do that

218
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:52,105
Speaker 6:  kind of thing. And it's not pretending to be a person, it's not pretending

219
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:55,865
Speaker 6:  to have feelings about it, it's just grabbing that very subtle

220
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,705
Speaker 6:  kind of collection of information that is not anchored in any keyword.

221
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:04,505
Speaker 6:  Right. You know, it's not looking for mentions of emotion, like

222
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:07,345
Speaker 6:  it just understands that these other things where they talk about their kids,

223
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:10,825
Speaker 6:  that's an emotional moment. And it's able to kind of collate that way when

224
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:14,705
Speaker 6:  it started being capable of doing that. That was the point

225
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:17,865
Speaker 6:  for me where I was like, oh, this is really a fundamental change.

226
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:18,705
Speaker 6:  And

227
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:22,305
Speaker 1:  That was, that happened with Gemini, which was what, earlier this year?

228
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,785
Speaker 6:  Yeah. We kind of switched, I lost track of all these things to, we switched

229
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:28,625
Speaker 6:  to Gemini 1.0 in in December and Okay. And it was great,

230
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:32,465
Speaker 6:  but it was really 1.5 pro and the bigger context window. I mean

231
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:35,425
Speaker 6:  the, the other thing that happened to me, by the way, I'm a nice writer dude,

232
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:39,345
Speaker 6:  and now like I hear like a new million token model and it's like the

233
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,825
Speaker 6:  most exciting thing of my life. Like I can't, cannot wait to get my hands

234
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:45,745
Speaker 6:  on it. So when we got first access to that,

235
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:50,265
Speaker 6:  that model, I took the entire text of, of my book

236
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:53,845
Speaker 6:  Infernal Machine, which just came out a couple months ago, but was in

237
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:57,605
Speaker 6:  manuscript form at that point. So this is really important. None of the words

238
00:14:57,675 --> 00:15:01,605
Speaker 6:  from my book were in the training data for the model itself. So it's all,

239
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:04,525
Speaker 6:  it had never been published, it had never been discussed about in, in any

240
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:08,205
Speaker 6:  coverage. So the facts, it's a book of history. So the facts are

241
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:12,165
Speaker 6:  probably in some form in the models training data, but the book itself and

242
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:16,085
Speaker 6:  the way that I presented the facts was not, and the thing that

243
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,885
Speaker 6:  had struck me about the early discussions of large context was that

244
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:24,085
Speaker 6:  people were, were using it to do these kind of needle in a haystack test

245
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,125
Speaker 6:  where they're like, oh, we gave it, you know, the full text of Moby Dick,

246
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,405
Speaker 6:  but we added this one line that was different. Yeah, I remember that. And

247
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:33,405
Speaker 6:  it was able to find it, right. And which is cool and, you know, you couldn't

248
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:37,325
Speaker 6:  do that before. But the point that, that I was so obsessed with is that

249
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:41,245
Speaker 6:  once you have the full text of something like a book in

250
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:44,925
Speaker 6:  context, it means that the, the model knowing can, can find

251
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:48,925
Speaker 6:  obscure things in the, in the text, but it understands the sequence

252
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:52,965
Speaker 6:  of the text and it can understand large kind of movements

253
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:56,885
Speaker 6:  of like cause and effect or change over time in, in a document, which

254
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:59,925
Speaker 6:  you can't get if you're just giving it isolated paragraphs and, and snippets

255
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,485
Speaker 6:  of things. And So I put in frontal the machine in into

256
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:07,645
Speaker 6:  this version of Gemini. And I, I basically asked it

257
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:11,525
Speaker 6:  inside a notebook, lm I was like, give me, I was

258
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:15,045
Speaker 6:  like, I'm interested in the way that Johnson uses suspense in this book.

259
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:19,285
Speaker 6:  I would like you to list four places where he deliberately

260
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:23,005
Speaker 6:  withholds information from the reader in order to pique

261
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:27,165
Speaker 6:  their interest, describe the passages where he does this quote from

262
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:31,085
Speaker 6:  them, and then explain the future information later in

263
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:34,005
Speaker 6:  the book that he's obliquely referring to that doesn't arrive for another,

264
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:37,845
Speaker 6:  you know, 50 pages or whatever. And it just absolutely nailed it. It,

265
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:41,445
Speaker 6:  the first example it gave was he gave was exactly what I would've picked

266
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:45,325
Speaker 6:  as the, the ultimate kind of form of suspense, which is a allusion to

267
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:49,125
Speaker 6:  a ticking, mysterious, ticking suitcase that happens in the, in the preface

268
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:52,605
Speaker 6:  that doesn't, the, the mystery behind it doesn't get explained for another

269
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:56,565
Speaker 6:  200 pages. And so like, think about that as like a search query,

270
00:16:56,675 --> 00:17:00,125
Speaker 6:  like yeah. Searches, find examples where

271
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,725
Speaker 6:  something isn't mentioned and isn't mentioned in a very

272
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:08,085
Speaker 6:  provocative way. And then fill in the blanks of, you know, the thing

273
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:11,885
Speaker 6:  200 pages later that it's obliquely referring to like that,

274
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:15,765
Speaker 6:  you know, again, the model is not understanding the

275
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:19,645
Speaker 6:  book on some level because understanding is a word that we associated with

276
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:22,885
Speaker 6:  consciousness, with ensen, with the in inner life of like what it means to

277
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:26,845
Speaker 6:  read a book, but the model is doing the thing that

278
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,725
Speaker 6:  human understanding does. Yeah. You know, and that's

279
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,205
Speaker 6:  a, that's an important distinction I think.

280
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:35,245
Speaker 1:  No, I think, I think that's right. One thing I heard somebody say not that

281
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:39,005
Speaker 1:  long ago is that a, a meta, the better metaphor they liked than its

282
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:41,965
Speaker 1:  understanding is just that it can see the whole thing at the same time. Yeah.

283
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:45,005
Speaker 1:  And I always thought that was really great. It's like in, if I, I can see

284
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:48,965
Speaker 1:  one page at a time, this thing can see all 300 and it doesn't, it's not

285
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:52,325
Speaker 1:  not better at knowing those things. It's just literally by being able to

286
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:56,405
Speaker 1:  see it all at once. Yeah. The, the number of things that

287
00:17:56,565 --> 00:18:00,165
Speaker 1:  suddenly become very basic because you can see them all together is very

288
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:03,645
Speaker 1:  powerful. And I just, that makes it both sort of simpler and cooler all at

289
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:07,405
Speaker 1:  the same time, which I really like. But you, you bring up this tension

290
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:11,645
Speaker 1:  that I think is fascinating with all AI stuff, which is that there is

291
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:15,565
Speaker 1:  a set of things that it are just sort of remarkable that they're

292
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,805
Speaker 1:  possible, right? And it's, you see this with every new model that comes out

293
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:21,605
Speaker 1:  and every new product that comes out, one of the first things everybody does

294
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:24,845
Speaker 1:  is just try wild stuff. Yeah. And some of it works and some of it doesn't

295
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:27,685
Speaker 1:  and some of it's amazing. It, some of it's dangerous and whatever. So there,

296
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:31,285
Speaker 1:  there's the, the sort of novelty factor of it that I think is still so rampant

297
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:35,285
Speaker 1:  in everything AI right now. And then there's the question of

298
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:39,765
Speaker 1:  what is any of this actually for? And I think one of the things that

299
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:43,725
Speaker 1:  I've liked about Notebook and sort of watching it develop over time is it

300
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:47,525
Speaker 1:  feels like your sense of not just what this can do, but

301
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:51,045
Speaker 1:  what it's for has gotten much better over time.

302
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:55,165
Speaker 1:  And I wonder if part of that is like, does the novelty of moments like that

303
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,725
Speaker 1:  start to wear off? And you start to realize like, okay, that's cool, but

304
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:02,645
Speaker 1:  no academic is actually going in here searching for what's missing from this

305
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,645
Speaker 1:  book. Like, that's not like a thing most people need in their lives. And

306
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,125
Speaker 1:  you start to sort of wind it back to like, okay, how do we bring that sort

307
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,885
Speaker 1:  of enabling technology to things people actually do need? Or maybe is

308
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:15,885
Speaker 1:  the, the craziness the point and we've just never been able to do it before,

309
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:19,965
Speaker 1:  so now we're trying to discover it all, all at once. So I guess

310
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,685
Speaker 1:  that, especially in those early days really before Gemini

311
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:27,405
Speaker 1:  1.5 kinda lights your brain on fire. Like what, what is that process of figuring

312
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:30,445
Speaker 1:  out, not just sort of what, what can this thing do, but like what are we

313
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:31,645
Speaker 1:  building this tool for?

314
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:35,855
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's such a great question. So many different ways to get into it.

315
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:39,625
Speaker 6:  I mean, I think in the very early days there was a sense

316
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,505
Speaker 6:  that we were building something we knew was not gonna really

317
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:47,545
Speaker 6:  work because the, the context wasn't big enough, the model wasn't

318
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:51,385
Speaker 6:  sophisticated enough, but you could see where things were going. And so,

319
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,585
Speaker 6:  so much of what we really focused on from the beginning is like, what is

320
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:57,865
Speaker 6:  the proper interface for this kind of thing? Like If, you know, it's, it's

321
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:01,585
Speaker 6:  not just about a text message thread. Like surely there are other kind of

322
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:05,465
Speaker 6:  forms of ui. So like If, you were gonna build a product from the ground up

323
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,745
Speaker 6:  knowing that it was gonna be built around a language model. Like what would,

324
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:12,225
Speaker 6:  what would it look like? Let's start from scratch. And that's a very fun

325
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,385
Speaker 6:  open canvas to have, but it also means you make a lot of stuff that is not

326
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:18,745
Speaker 6:  very good and doesn't really make sense and it doesn't work because the model

327
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:22,105
Speaker 6:  isn't caught up to it yet. So, so there was a lot of experimenting with that.

328
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:25,185
Speaker 6:  We, I think the, we had an advantage in the early days in that

329
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:30,245
Speaker 6:  I was just trying to drive it towards my very specific use

330
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:34,205
Speaker 6:  case of like, I want a thing that is read all of my work and all of the

331
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:38,125
Speaker 6:  quotes from books that have influenced me and can be a second brain to

332
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,125
Speaker 6:  help me like remember those things and make connections and, and like, and

333
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,805
Speaker 6:  so kind of author researcher mode. And that we kind of built the first prototype

334
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:48,925
Speaker 6:  with that and then once we were able to kind of open it up to more users,

335
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:53,645
Speaker 6:  I think then, then we were just constantly discovering all these amazing

336
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:56,845
Speaker 6:  things. And, and a big addition of this was Rza Martin, our product manager

337
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:01,725
Speaker 6:  who, you know, has just been, she's just a incredible like

338
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:06,405
Speaker 6:  listener to user. She's set up this discord that, you know,

339
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,645
Speaker 6:  was so central. Like at the very beginning we had a Discord, which is not

340
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,285
Speaker 6:  a normal thing to do in some ways. and we now have this

341
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:16,645
Speaker 6:  amazing community and it's constantly filled with people being like, oh yeah,

342
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:20,605
Speaker 6:  I saw this opportunity to use it in this way. So like our favorite one that

343
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:24,365
Speaker 6:  completely came outta the discord was Dungeons and

344
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:27,925
Speaker 6:  Dragons players started using it because they were like, I have these big,

345
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:31,885
Speaker 6:  you know, campaigns that I've designed that, you know, I'm a dungeon master

346
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:35,925
Speaker 6:  and I have like created this whole virtual fantasy world and it's

347
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:38,605
Speaker 6:  filled with all this information and it's hard to keep track of, but I can

348
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:41,765
Speaker 6:  load these documents into Notebook lm and then I can just like, I ask any

349
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:44,605
Speaker 6:  kind of open-ended question and it'll be like, how many hit points do I need

350
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:48,165
Speaker 6:  to kill this ORC or whatever. It's, I'm not a d and d player. And,

351
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:51,085
Speaker 6:  and they were using it that way and, and, and people were writing fantasy

352
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:55,445
Speaker 6:  also like world building kind of fantasy novels and

353
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:58,005
Speaker 6:  they just need, they had a kind of story bible with all their characters

354
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:00,445
Speaker 6:  in the backstory and everything like that. And it turned out that, you know,

355
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:04,205
Speaker 6:  they'd never really had an interface of let them do that. And that was not

356
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:08,125
Speaker 6:  something we were thinking about at all. So we've just been like,

357
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,805
Speaker 6:  you know, once we got past that first little prototype stage, we've just

358
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:15,645
Speaker 6:  been really listening like intently to like where people are trying

359
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:18,725
Speaker 6:  to push the tool and then just like making it easier,

360
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:22,725
Speaker 6:  making it, making it so they, you don't have to push quite as hard to use

361
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:25,645
Speaker 6:  the tool that way. Yeah. And that's, yeah, that's where we're

362
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:29,525
Speaker 1:  Well it's funny, I mean, even thinking about you, you've written a couple

363
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:33,045
Speaker 1:  of times over the years about your, your sort of endless, I think you call

364
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:36,805
Speaker 1:  it the Spark file that is basically just like a mountainous

365
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:41,005
Speaker 1:  document of all the good and bad story ideas you have. I'm, I'm paraphrasing,

366
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:42,565
Speaker 1:  but that I think that's right. Right. They're

367
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:45,045
Speaker 6:  All good. I don't know, what're the bad ideas you're talking about David,

368
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:45,925
Speaker 6:  that's flawless

369
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:48,005
Speaker 1:  Perfect. Buy that book now.

370
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:48,925
Speaker 6:  Many bad ideas,

371
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:52,845
Speaker 1:  Ideas. And I think like just listening to you describe the,

372
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:56,125
Speaker 1:  the story bible for the world building stuff like that, that actually is

373
00:22:56,525 --> 00:23:00,245
Speaker 1:  like a perfect down the middle use case for this in a way I hadn't even really

374
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,445
Speaker 1:  thought about until just now that it is like, here's a bunch of stuff that

375
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:06,765
Speaker 1:  I have decided one way or another, right? Like, here, here are my inputs.

376
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:10,765
Speaker 1:  Help me make things with that is actually like kind of an amazing

377
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:15,045
Speaker 1:  and very difficult otherwise use case. 'cause it's like,

378
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,765
Speaker 1:  oh yeah, how many I I have to go and collate that piece of information, that

379
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:22,685
Speaker 1:  piece of information. I think there's all kinds of like complicated things

380
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:26,485
Speaker 1:  with how we think about the art on top of all of that. But, but that thing

381
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:29,085
Speaker 1:  where it's just like, I want to tell you the rules and I want you to help

382
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:33,005
Speaker 1:  me make games out of it. Yeah. Feels awesome. Like I I I'm so much less

383
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:37,045
Speaker 1:  conflicted about that than I am about so many things in ai. That's so cool.

384
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:37,325
Speaker 1:  I

385
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:40,965
Speaker 6:  Love that. Yeah. Well we're trying to do the things that are, are less conflict.

386
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:43,765
Speaker 6:  I said I was conflict averse, so I'm just like trying to steer towards this

387
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:47,125
Speaker 6:  thing. But, but yeah, it's a great point that kind of like take this massive

388
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:50,765
Speaker 6:  unstructured data and turn it into a set of kind of

389
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:54,805
Speaker 6:  formats that help me do the job that I'm trying to do with some guidance

390
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:58,405
Speaker 6:  from me. Right? And, and this was, by the way, this was another great place

391
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:01,645
Speaker 6:  where like Rza really saw this before I did because I was thinking of it

392
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:05,565
Speaker 6:  as I'm going to write my book, so I'm gonna do all the like

393
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:08,885
Speaker 6:  content creation here. I just need to be able to like surface the facts and

394
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:12,605
Speaker 6:  make some connections, you know, but it turns out they're just all these

395
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:16,565
Speaker 6:  places where you've got all your company documents and

396
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:20,125
Speaker 6:  you want to create an FAQ for new employees. Like

397
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:24,885
Speaker 6:  no one is gonna win a Nobel Prize for, for literature for creating that

398
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:28,885
Speaker 6:  document. Like, and If, you can get a first draft of that document in

399
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,805
Speaker 6:  45 seconds instead of in four hours. Like that's

400
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,085
Speaker 6:  a win, right? That's that, that is good news. And so there there are all

401
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:39,485
Speaker 6:  these different workflows that are out there where there's massive

402
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:43,365
Speaker 6:  information needs to be kind of like filtered in some way and

403
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:44,285
Speaker 6:  turned into something else.

404
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:48,845
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take a break and then we will be back with more From

405
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:50,565
Speaker 1:  Steven Johnson. We'll be right back.

406
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:06,685
Speaker 1:  some information up. Like its entire purpose is not to make information

407
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:10,205
Speaker 1:  up. Yeah. How do you, what, what have you guys done? I know

408
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:14,485
Speaker 1:  Notebook was an early experiment in in Rag,

409
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:18,205
Speaker 1:  which is a way of basically winnowing down some of these systems,

410
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:21,925
Speaker 1:  but like what, what have you guys done differently at Notebook to try and

411
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:25,605
Speaker 1:  solve that? And I'm curious both on the underlying tech side and

412
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:27,325
Speaker 1:  on the user experience side.

413
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:31,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah, well we tried, I kept calling it Source

414
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:34,445
Speaker 6:  grounding because I think that is a better name than Rag.

415
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:39,045
Speaker 1:  I don't know man, we all know GPT now, So, I just I've given up. We're all,

416
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:40,325
Speaker 1:  we're all doing the acronyms now.

417
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:45,285
Speaker 6:  So, you know, I think part of it was the fact that we were doing it

418
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,325
Speaker 6:  from the beginning like that, that it started with that it wasn't like, oh

419
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:52,045
Speaker 6:  let's build a CHOP model and, and oh shoot, we need to be able to like, you

420
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:55,125
Speaker 6:  know, ground it in o other documents like it was from the beginning we were

421
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:59,045
Speaker 6:  doing that. And so we just had a lot of time to like iterate and explore

422
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,805
Speaker 6:  the, the Gemini models are really good at at Source

423
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:07,085
Speaker 6:  grounding. They just, there, there's a lot of training sets. We contributed

424
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:10,685
Speaker 6:  a bunch of them to like just given this document

425
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:14,605
Speaker 6:  answer questions factually based on the information that documents. So we

426
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:15,125
Speaker 6:  inherited

427
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:20,525
Speaker 6:  like a great tool that, you know, we did very little, you know, kudos

428
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:24,045
Speaker 6:  to the Gemini team for building a model that that is, is much more

429
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:28,005
Speaker 6:  faithful to source material you give it. But we built it

430
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:31,285
Speaker 6:  also, you know, this is, this is one of these things where it's like, it's

431
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:35,325
Speaker 6:  it's underlying model plus the UI is, has always been

432
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:39,205
Speaker 6:  like our mantra from the beginning. And, and you know, both things are

433
00:27:39,485 --> 00:27:42,765
Speaker 6:  required. And so one of the key things that we've had

434
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:46,485
Speaker 6:  pretty much from the beginning is that you can always read your sources

435
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:51,045
Speaker 6:  in the app and then with the release in June, we,

436
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:54,685
Speaker 6:  we switched it over so that you now have inline citations to everything.

437
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:58,285
Speaker 6:  So anything the model says has a little link, you can read the original passage

438
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,965
Speaker 6:  If, you hover over it, that shows you the, you know, the source material

439
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:04,445
Speaker 6:  for that and you can click on it and you can go read the source in the app.

440
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:05,005
Speaker 6:  Do

441
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:05,605
Speaker 7:  You think that's enough?

442
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:11,005
Speaker 6:  We've talked about? So, so one of the things you can do right now actually

443
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:14,765
Speaker 6:  with Notebook that we wanna actually turn into a proper feature, but you

444
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:18,325
Speaker 6:  can do it right now, is you can upload a bunch of, you know, kind of source

445
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:22,405
Speaker 6:  material, factual source material and then you can upload the

446
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:26,165
Speaker 6:  article you're writing for instance, and you can say, fact check this

447
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:30,085
Speaker 6:  article based on these sources and suggest improvements. Oh, that's clever,

448
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:33,605
Speaker 6:  that's a good idea. And yeah, it's, it's amazing. It, it will go through

449
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:36,925
Speaker 6:  and be like, well this is correct, this is potentially wrong. It will suggest,

450
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:40,445
Speaker 6:  suggest and it'll have links to everything. And so to me,

451
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:45,085
Speaker 6:  if I felt that the model were just hallucinating

452
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:49,045
Speaker 6:  wildly in its responses, then I do not believe

453
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:52,285
Speaker 6:  that, you know, just providing citations and the ability to kind of fact

454
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:55,485
Speaker 6:  check manually and go back and see the original passage would be enough.

455
00:28:56,265 --> 00:29:00,165
Speaker 6:  But we've, you know, we've been sitting there banging away at like

456
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:03,965
Speaker 6:  quality, you know, reviews like constantly for the last year and a half.

457
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:07,445
Speaker 6:  Like we have a poll, you know, sheets and sheets and sheets of,

458
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:11,645
Speaker 6:  of sample questions and sample documents and we can just see that accuracy

459
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:15,645
Speaker 6:  rate going up, you know, dramatically particularly with, with these

460
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:19,485
Speaker 6:  latest models. And so right now I feel like we're in a,

461
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:22,925
Speaker 6:  we're in a pretty good place. I rarely, I honestly, I rarely see

462
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:27,445
Speaker 6:  Notebook LM just wildly hallucinate something. I mean, one thing that's really

463
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:29,965
Speaker 6:  important, people may not know this, I take this for granted because everyone

464
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:33,125
Speaker 6:  living with this product, if If you load in a bunch of sources about the

465
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:36,885
Speaker 6:  history of NASA and then ask a question about Taylor Swift in general

466
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:40,125
Speaker 6:  Notebook, Ellen will say, I'm sorry, your sources don't discuss Taylor Swift,

467
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:44,205
Speaker 6:  So I can't answer this question. And obviously the model knows a lot about

468
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:47,965
Speaker 6:  Taylor Swift is probably a pretty big fan of Taylor Swift. But

469
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:51,725
Speaker 6:  it's, but it's been specifically, you know, instructed to not answer questions

470
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:54,405
Speaker 6:  that are outside the source material. I mean, to a fault, I think sometimes,

471
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:56,925
Speaker 6:  you know, one would like to bring in some outside knowledge, you know, and

472
00:29:56,925 --> 00:30:00,685
Speaker 6:  trust but verify with that. But we've erred on the side of like

473
00:30:00,695 --> 00:30:04,245
Speaker 6:  stick to the facts in these documents. And so

474
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:07,885
Speaker 6:  with the increase in accuracy and with the UI of citations,

475
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:10,725
Speaker 6:  there's more things we could do. We could make that fact checking feature,

476
00:30:11,465 --> 00:30:15,445
Speaker 6:  you know, double check this kind of as, as something. But I feel pretty

477
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:19,125
Speaker 6:  good about where we are in terms of the quality side of that. Where we are

478
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,925
Speaker 6:  kind of state of the art is upload many, many documents,

479
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:27,605
Speaker 6:  ask a complex question that involves like multiple

480
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:31,565
Speaker 6:  kind of variables drawn across like multiple documents. Get a deep,

481
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:35,725
Speaker 6:  you know, long answer with citations. Follow those citations

482
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:39,485
Speaker 6:  to read in the original text. Like I think that NotebookLM

483
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:43,405
Speaker 6:  you know, kind of does that flow as well as anybody Right now

484
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:43,845
Speaker 6:  I feel

485
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:47,285
Speaker 1:  Like you just described like a, like a personal Wikipedia and I mean that

486
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:50,605
Speaker 1:  as a compliment. Like the, the thing that Wikipedia is

487
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:54,845
Speaker 1:  best at is just being like a starting point to go learn about something on

488
00:30:55,045 --> 00:30:58,085
Speaker 1:  the internet, right? Like you open a Wikipedia page, you go click on all

489
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:00,525
Speaker 1:  the references at the bottom and then you go read those references and you're,

490
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,125
Speaker 1:  you're off and running. And I feel like what you just described is like,

491
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:06,925
Speaker 1:  I can shortcut that with any process of any single thing that I wanna learn

492
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:09,485
Speaker 1:  more about. I just dump it in and I'm like, what's going on here? Yeah. And

493
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:10,525
Speaker 1:  it'll just be like, here's some stuff.

494
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:14,245
Speaker 6:  I have so many things to say to that David, you're gonna have to gimme 20

495
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:18,005
Speaker 6:  minutes. 'cause I, okay, so one thing is I'm in the process of thinking about

496
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:21,845
Speaker 6:  what I'm gonna write the next book on and So I created

497
00:31:22,025 --> 00:31:25,925
Speaker 6:  the, this is just kind of second nature workflow for me now, but

498
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:29,605
Speaker 6:  you know, wouldn't have occurred to me a year ago, So I created a new notebook

499
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:32,925
Speaker 6:  called the next book. And whenever there's an idea that kind of comes to

500
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,085
Speaker 6:  my mind or there's article I read or something like that, I dump it into

501
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:35,725
Speaker 6:  that notebook. It's

502
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:36,085
Speaker 1:  The new Spark

503
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:39,885
Speaker 6:  File. It's the new Spark file. Wow. And, but it's focused on this project

504
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:43,605
Speaker 6:  of like, what should the next book be? And, and so the other day

505
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:47,845
Speaker 6:  I, you know, late night I, this kind of thing I do like I, because I

506
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:51,085
Speaker 6:  have no life, my children have all gone to college and I have nothing to

507
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,965
Speaker 6:  do with sit around and think about this. You stopped to bar, it's cool. I

508
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:56,845
Speaker 6:  talked to Bart So I was like, I wonder, you know, has there

509
00:31:56,845 --> 00:32:00,805
Speaker 6:  been a good book written about the anti-nuclear movements, anti-nuclear power

510
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,125
Speaker 6:  movements of the sixties and seventies? 'cause that's an interesting case

511
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:06,525
Speaker 6:  where we like stopped the technology partially in its tracks and maybe made

512
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:09,685
Speaker 6:  a mistake and, you know, how do we interpret that? And So

513
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:13,565
Speaker 6:  I just went and grabbed like two Wikipedia pages

514
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:17,805
Speaker 6:  that in the past I would've like, you know, started by reading through all

515
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,925
Speaker 6:  the Wikipedia pages, but I brought it into Notebook and I was like, I'm Steven

516
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:23,485
Speaker 6:  Johnson. I'm writing, thinking about writing a book, you know, in the mode

517
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,725
Speaker 6:  of my other books, like in Frontal Machine and Ghost Map, potentially about

518
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:28,885
Speaker 6:  the anti-nuclear powers. Take a look at these, like what do you think of

519
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:32,005
Speaker 6:  the, are there any interesting storylines that, that would be good starting

520
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:35,925
Speaker 6:  places? Like what, you know, what would be good there? And it

521
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:39,125
Speaker 6:  just does it like it, you know, goes through wow. And it's like, well you

522
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,285
Speaker 6:  can focus on this period, this figure is kind of interesting, whatever. And

523
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:44,365
Speaker 6:  then I went and read all the, you know, I'm gonna read the material, but

524
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:48,285
Speaker 6:  as a, as a first glance, like inroads

525
00:32:48,685 --> 00:32:52,605
Speaker 6:  material, it's amazing for that kind of exploration, the

526
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:56,285
Speaker 6:  experience of navigating through a book, through a

527
00:32:56,285 --> 00:33:00,205
Speaker 6:  conversational interface is really interesting. Mm. And it's one of

528
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:03,525
Speaker 6:  these things where like, you know, until now

529
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:07,925
Speaker 6:  If, you wanted to explore the ideas in an author's work through

530
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:12,005
Speaker 6:  a conversation. You could only do that by finding the author

531
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:16,565
Speaker 6:  in person or finding a, a scholar or a tutor who's an expert

532
00:33:16,565 --> 00:33:19,645
Speaker 6:  in the author's ideas. And like, that was it, that was not, there was no

533
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:23,485
Speaker 6:  other way to do it. But now you can load, you know, a book in

534
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,205
Speaker 6:  and you can start with like, I'm interested in this, tell me about that.

535
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:29,605
Speaker 6:  And then slowly read the book in a non-linear way

536
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:32,965
Speaker 6:  through a conversational interface kind of dipping in and out of the kind

537
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:36,925
Speaker 6:  of original passages, which is terrible if it's a novel or terrible, if

538
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:39,845
Speaker 6:  it's a, you know, straight linear kind of history book. Like I sometimes

539
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:43,805
Speaker 6:  write. But if it's an advice book or a, you know, a book of ideas, you know,

540
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:47,405
Speaker 6:  there are lots of books that I think could be explored in that way that just,

541
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:49,325
Speaker 6:  you know, weren't possible before. Does

542
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:52,445
Speaker 1:  It feel like cheating to do that? Like for you as an author, you have, you

543
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:56,045
Speaker 1:  have worked through these books, you have done the hard work, you have stayed

544
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:58,405
Speaker 1:  up late at night. I'm sure you've like woken up in the middle of the night

545
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:01,525
Speaker 1:  with the book idea. Does sitting down and asking a computer what your next

546
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:02,525
Speaker 1:  book should be feel like cheating?

547
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:06,635
Speaker 6:  I think if I were literally like, Hey, what should my next book be?

548
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:11,225
Speaker 6:  One, I don't think it would, I mean right now in a way it's easy to answer

549
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:14,505
Speaker 6:  this question right now because it wouldn't be good enough. Like it wouldn't

550
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:17,225
Speaker 6:  generate like, what, tell me what my book should be and now start writing

551
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:20,905
Speaker 6:  it like it just wouldn't be able to do it. Okay. Current trend lines continue.

552
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:21,465
Speaker 6:  I was gonna

553
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:22,625
Speaker 1:  Say give it a minute. Yeah.

554
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:26,225
Speaker 6:  Come back to me in two years. We'll we'll see. But, but what I have to do

555
00:34:26,225 --> 00:34:29,665
Speaker 6:  is like, I'm not using it that way. I'm using it like these very like, kind

556
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:33,585
Speaker 6:  of targeted queries. Like, you know, I was, I actually was using

557
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:37,505
Speaker 6:  the NASA notebook 'cause I was interested in like, you know, maybe there's

558
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:40,745
Speaker 6:  something to be done about the Apollo 13 fire. And

559
00:34:41,325 --> 00:34:44,425
Speaker 6:  so then it was kind of like, okay look, I need to know what I need to read

560
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:48,425
Speaker 6:  'cause it's a million pages, a million words of transcripts. I actually

561
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:51,585
Speaker 6:  don't need to read the whole thing. What I wanna read are the sections that

562
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:54,705
Speaker 6:  are relevant to the Apollo 13 fire. And So I just went a notebook and said,

563
00:34:54,705 --> 00:34:58,065
Speaker 6:  tell me what I should read. You know, and it was like, you should start here,

564
00:34:58,085 --> 00:35:00,745
Speaker 6:  you should read there and I can click immediately in there and, and read

565
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:04,705
Speaker 6:  through that. And so to me, I'm using it as a

566
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:08,535
Speaker 6:  way of accelerating the process of

567
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:12,455
Speaker 6:  discovery that would just have been painful to do before, but I'm

568
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:16,415
Speaker 6:  making just as many unplanned serendipitous discoveries along the

569
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:20,135
Speaker 6:  way. I mean the, I think the criticism is like, well if it, the model serves

570
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:24,055
Speaker 6:  it up to you so quickly, even If you end up writing the book, you've

571
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,895
Speaker 6:  missed the surprising thing that would, you would've never found, you

572
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:31,055
Speaker 6:  would've only found it by reading through it in an incredibly linear way.

573
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:35,175
Speaker 6:  And I think that that's just, it's just not true. Like I, I, it's,

574
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:38,020
Speaker 6:  it's constantly surfacing things that I hadn't thought of right. And, and

575
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,765
Speaker 6:  making connections that I hadn't thought of. And so it's helping

576
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:45,805
Speaker 6:  me understand the material more deeply, where it gets complicated.

577
00:35:46,025 --> 00:35:49,485
Speaker 6:  And you and I have talked about this before, the way I think about it is

578
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:54,045
Speaker 6:  it's a tool that helps you understand things. If you were genuinely

579
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:57,725
Speaker 6:  interested in understanding things and having that understanding be in your

580
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:01,325
Speaker 6:  brain. It's a, it's a huge net positive, a hundred percent.

581
00:36:01,435 --> 00:36:05,285
Speaker 6:  Like if, if If you go into it with good intentions, it is a, you know, an

582
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:09,245
Speaker 6:  amazing tool for thought. It helps you have richer, more complex ideas, understand

583
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:13,115
Speaker 6:  material better. If you are not interested in understanding things,

584
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:16,795
Speaker 6:  but rather interested in creating the illusion that you understand things

585
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:20,595
Speaker 6:  and just wanna bluff your way through life without ever actually understanding

586
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,075
Speaker 6:  anything but creating outputs that make it look like you understand things.

587
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:27,755
Speaker 6:  It potentially will help you do that as well. And the question is,

588
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:32,315
Speaker 6:  the question is like, how often is that useful as a strategy in the

589
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,955
Speaker 6:  world? And, and to me, like If, you go into work and you're like, I've got

590
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:39,915
Speaker 6:  this great hack. I never read any of the emails from my boss. I

591
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:43,155
Speaker 6:  just like put it into the model and then I output anything. Eventually your

592
00:36:43,155 --> 00:36:46,995
Speaker 6:  boss will like have a conversation with you and you'll say, Steven, you don't

593
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:49,275
Speaker 6:  understand anything. You have not learned anything and you'll get fired.

594
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:52,595
Speaker 6:  Right? It just doesn't, it's not a good long-term strategy. The one place

595
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:56,555
Speaker 6:  where it's tricky is school where there is potentially a

596
00:36:56,555 --> 00:37:00,435
Speaker 6:  strange incentive to bluff your way through something. We think

597
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:04,155
Speaker 6:  that, you know, we we're seeing a lot of adoption of notebook elements 18

598
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,995
Speaker 6:  plus currently. So it's not usable by high schoolers, but we're seeing a

599
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:11,955
Speaker 6:  lot of college and higher ed adoption of it. It's probably

600
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:15,715
Speaker 6:  our biggest community so far. We are very

601
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:19,235
Speaker 6:  excited about that use case. But we're also like, you know, we've done a

602
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:23,075
Speaker 6:  lot of things to, to, you know, ensure that you, you know, it's hard

603
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,915
Speaker 6:  to use it to bypass understanding. Like it's tr it's constantly steering

604
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:29,595
Speaker 6:  you back towards the original text. You're always kind of being

605
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,675
Speaker 6:  pointed back towards that source material. It's always there in the UI with

606
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:35,915
Speaker 6:  you. So, and there are more things we can do on that front, but that's the

607
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:39,035
Speaker 6:  line that I think is like, you know, If, you If you go into this with good

608
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:42,995
Speaker 6:  intentions. I don't feel concerned about using the tool in

609
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:43,195
Speaker 6:  this way.

610
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:47,395
Speaker 1:  Okay. I buy that. And it feels like part of the line

611
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:51,075
Speaker 1:  there exists in kind of what you let people make

612
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:55,075
Speaker 1:  with what is coming out of it. And I, I wonder like we, we've talked a lot

613
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:58,235
Speaker 1:  about kind of the, the inputs and the processing and the understanding and

614
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:02,195
Speaker 1:  it's, it's not, you're sort of one, you know, published this

615
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:06,075
Speaker 1:  answer on Amazon as a self-published ebook with your name on it away

616
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,635
Speaker 1:  from it being this being a very different conversation. Yeah. But my sense

617
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:12,155
Speaker 1:  is you're, you're deliberately or not not

618
00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:16,155
Speaker 1:  investing a ton in the like rate me a research paper from

619
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:18,195
Speaker 1:  these six documents kind of use case.

620
00:38:18,265 --> 00:38:21,395
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If, you look at, look at the notebook guides, like one of them is called

621
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:24,315
Speaker 6:  study guide, right? It creates a study guide. It doesn't replace your work.

622
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:27,675
Speaker 6:  It helps you actually like, you know, it gives you a set of review questions,

623
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:30,475
Speaker 6:  it creates a little multiple choice quiz. It creates like essay suggested

624
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:33,875
Speaker 6:  questions. It creates a glossary of key terms. So, you know,

625
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:36,965
Speaker 6:  that's what we're trying to do inside of the product. We're steering everybody

626
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:40,605
Speaker 6:  towards that kind of like, help me understand mode

627
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:44,325
Speaker 6:  with the idea that, you know, the people have different ways of understanding.

628
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:47,205
Speaker 6:  There are different ways the people have like information sticks with them

629
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:51,045
Speaker 6:  through different forms. And you know, our job is to kind of do that. I mean

630
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:54,485
Speaker 6:  that's it, you know, it turns out as writing about this a little bit this

631
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:58,325
Speaker 6:  week that, you know, translation and summarization is

632
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:02,005
Speaker 6:  something that the models have always done quite well. Like from the beginning,

633
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:04,885
Speaker 6:  like kind of like the first deep learning

634
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:09,165
Speaker 6:  breakthrough that really made a difference to consumers was really like translate

635
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:11,245
Speaker 6:  Google Translate and others that, you know Yeah, that's true. That it was

636
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:14,485
Speaker 6:  basically like, take this set of tokens that are in this language and turn

637
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:18,245
Speaker 6:  it into the set of tokens in this language and you know, they're really good

638
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:22,085
Speaker 6:  at, at summarizing in, in all of its different forms. And so we're,

639
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:25,605
Speaker 6:  you know, we've kind of like embraced that 'cause you know, embrace the things

640
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:28,605
Speaker 6:  that the models do well it's generally a, a good strategy. Yeah.

641
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:33,045
Speaker 1:  Alright, we have to take one more break and then we will be back with the

642
00:39:33,045 --> 00:39:35,765
Speaker 1:  rest of my conversation with Steven Johnson. We'll be right back.

643
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:04,445
Speaker 1:  We're back. Okay. We have waited long enough to talk about audio

644
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:08,565
Speaker 1:  overviews, those wild AI generated podcasts notebook has been working

645
00:41:30,485 --> 00:41:33,085
Speaker 6:  Now you can. So we've added it to the suite of, of tools

646
00:41:33,675 --> 00:41:37,565
Speaker 1:  That feels like it causes a thousand new interesting

647
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:40,365
Speaker 1:  things. Like on the one hand it's, it's not

648
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:44,065
Speaker 1:  the thing that you were describing earlier in this conversation, which is

649
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:48,025
Speaker 1:  something that is not full of personality. It doesn't say I a lot. It's

650
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:51,985
Speaker 1:  not, this is not a tool anymore. This is two

651
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:56,625
Speaker 1:  slightly weird people hanging out in my ears for 10 minutes. Yeah.

652
00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:00,465
Speaker 1:  And they are like it, whatever dial you have that says like make

653
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:04,225
Speaker 1:  them say puns and try and be kind of cringingly, it's like

654
00:42:04,295 --> 00:42:08,105
Speaker 1:  that dial is at 14 out of 10 on most of the ones that I've listened to

655
00:42:09,205 --> 00:42:12,545
Speaker 1:  and I kind of get why. Right? Yeah. Like If, you If you take the, it should

656
00:42:12,545 --> 00:42:15,865
Speaker 1:  have no personality. It should just be very straightforward approach. That

657
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:19,825
Speaker 1:  makes sense on showing me a bunch of texts and apply it to a podcast

658
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:24,245
Speaker 1:  that's a bad podcast, but it does feel kind of incongruous

659
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,325
Speaker 1:  with a lot of the stuff you've been saying is like core to what you've been

660
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:26,925
Speaker 1:  trying to do. Well,

661
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:30,685
Speaker 6:  I mean, it's such a great question. So let's, let's just play, I want you

662
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:32,885
Speaker 6:  to play this please in case people haven't heard it.

663
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:37,415
Speaker 3:  Okay. So get this picture A world where the hottest

664
00:42:37,415 --> 00:42:41,295
Speaker 3:  tech isn't microchips or the internet, but dynamite. Yeah,

665
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:45,175
Speaker 3:  dynamite. And it's not just blowing stuff up. Think skyscrapers,

666
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:48,535
Speaker 3:  railroads, massive engineering projects, but also

667
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:52,655
Speaker 3:  you guessed at assassination attempts, terrorist plots, all that volatile

668
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:55,975
Speaker 3:  stuff. It's a wild period, right? Wild is an understatement. And that's where

669
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:59,815
Speaker 3:  our deep dive today comes in. We're cracking open Stephen Johnson's the Infernal

670
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:03,735
Speaker 3:  Machine, a book that digs into this explosive era where dynamite

671
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:07,575
Speaker 3:  anarchists and the birth of, believe it or not, modern data

672
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:09,735
Speaker 3:  collection all collided. Yeah. Get

673
00:43:09,735 --> 00:43:12,215
Speaker 2:  Ready to have your mind blown because the connections he makes are mind

674
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,335
Speaker 3:  Blowing. Absolutely.

675
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:15,255
Speaker 6:  So it's

676
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:18,575
Speaker 1:  Just everything after Yeah. Dynamite just kills me. I love it.

677
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:22,975
Speaker 6:  You know, one of the things is it, it's, they are enthusiastic

678
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:27,375
Speaker 6:  and so people have been uploading their cvs

679
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:31,095
Speaker 6:  and it's just like if they were feeling down about yourself, like they're

680
00:43:31,095 --> 00:43:33,415
Speaker 6:  like, oh, John Smith, look at his, just

681
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:33,695
Speaker 3:  Make you a

682
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:34,175
Speaker 1:  Promo podcast.

683
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,215
Speaker 6:  It's made cum laude from

684
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,815
Speaker 6:  So I. Think when we first talked about

685
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:45,895
Speaker 6:  what was then Project Tailwind for The Verge, like,

686
00:43:45,995 --> 00:43:49,815
Speaker 6:  you know, Verizon and I were talking about how, you know, we, we don't,

687
00:43:49,815 --> 00:43:53,655
Speaker 6:  the model doesn't have a a a a persona really. Like it doesn't

688
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:57,495
Speaker 6:  use the subjective, I in general, it's not

689
00:43:57,495 --> 00:44:00,455
Speaker 6:  trying to be your friend, it's just trying to get you the information you

690
00:44:00,455 --> 00:44:04,335
Speaker 6:  need. And that was, that was kind of the house style that we felt was appropriate

691
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:08,175
Speaker 6:  for what we were trying to build. But If, you wanna have a,

692
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:12,175
Speaker 6:  a conversational audio format. There is no way to do that without

693
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:16,375
Speaker 6:  there having a sense of like human personas. It just won't work. No one,

694
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,535
Speaker 6:  no one wants to listen to two series talk to each other. Right. That is not,

695
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:20,775
Speaker 6:  I'm sure there's

696
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:22,695
Speaker 1:  A lot of that on the internet and it's not good. The

697
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:25,575
Speaker 6:  News theory is, is better, but, but I'm sure. But, but, but the old theory,

698
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,855
Speaker 6:  right? You know, you, when you listen to two robots talking to each other,

699
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:31,885
Speaker 6:  and initially it was a, another team

700
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:35,725
Speaker 6:  inside of labs that had built this prototype that was like, you know,

701
00:44:35,725 --> 00:44:38,165
Speaker 6:  create a document. There, there, there are actually a couple of projects

702
00:44:38,165 --> 00:44:40,685
Speaker 6:  like this at Google. There's another wonderful one called Illuminate that

703
00:44:40,685 --> 00:44:44,485
Speaker 6:  has a slightly more like, kind of scholarly tone to it, but it was just one

704
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:47,605
Speaker 6:  of these things where like, it became possible to do this. And so, you know,

705
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:52,045
Speaker 6:  some folks were exploring this and it was a very good demo,

706
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:55,885
Speaker 6:  like we've seen from the last few days with audio

707
00:44:56,245 --> 00:45:00,005
Speaker 6:  overviews. Like people are impressed, people wanna share it, but

708
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:03,685
Speaker 6:  it, it didn't kind of have a place to live. And so

709
00:45:04,055 --> 00:45:07,885
Speaker 6:  kinda right before IO actually there was this idea of like, well

710
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:11,925
Speaker 6:  maybe we could actually put it into, you know, would it make sense inside

711
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:15,685
Speaker 6:  of Notebook? And you know, we were just rolling out the notebook

712
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:19,725
Speaker 6:  guides and when I first heard it, the, the,

713
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:23,605
Speaker 6:  the podcast stuff was like actually even bigger. Like the host had names

714
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:27,485
Speaker 6:  and things like that and Okay. And so, you know,

715
00:45:27,585 --> 00:45:30,925
Speaker 6:  but I like it definitely made, you know, I think Verizon and I

716
00:45:31,235 --> 00:45:34,565
Speaker 6:  immediately saw that it was a continuation of the philosophy of the guides

717
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:37,685
Speaker 6:  that, you know, we, we, we'll take whatever you give us and we will turn

718
00:45:37,685 --> 00:45:41,525
Speaker 6:  it into the format that makes it easiest for you to understand. and

719
00:45:41,525 --> 00:45:44,765
Speaker 6:  we know, we know from, you know, the success of podcasts in general that

720
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:47,525
Speaker 6:  people do like to learn that way. Also, also like to travel with audio and

721
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:50,485
Speaker 6:  drive and, you know, walk around the city listening to it. So we knew, we

722
00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:52,965
Speaker 6:  knew there were a lot of reasons why audio conversations would make sense.

723
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:56,885
Speaker 1:  Are you starting to have similar conversations about things like video?

724
00:45:57,485 --> 00:46:00,005
Speaker 1:  I, I can just imagine like, yeah, I'm starting to think about what notebook

725
00:46:00,065 --> 00:46:03,845
Speaker 1:  LM looks like when you're trying to be like TikTok native and YouTube native

726
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:07,245
Speaker 1:  and Instagram reels native is like, it's just what a wild

727
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:10,605
Speaker 1:  kind of road to end up heading down in terms of like how do we communicate

728
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:14,245
Speaker 1:  to people where they are Yeah. But sort of in this house style,

729
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:18,205
Speaker 6:  This is one of the reasons why it's good that I am like 56-year-old gray

730
00:46:18,205 --> 00:46:20,165
Speaker 6:  haired Steven is not actually like,

731
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:24,965
Speaker 6:  driving things like, because I wouldn't be terrible at helping with that,

732
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:28,565
Speaker 6:  but like, yes, I think that could be part of our future. Pretty fun. One

733
00:46:28,565 --> 00:46:31,525
Speaker 6:  of the things I think is really interesting about it in the response, it

734
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:35,125
Speaker 6:  takes like four or five minutes to sometimes three to five minutes to generate

735
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:38,765
Speaker 6:  one of these. And that's because there is a really

736
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:42,765
Speaker 6:  complex series of, of kind of, you know,

737
00:46:42,955 --> 00:46:46,765
Speaker 6:  compute and inference that's going on. Basically you can think about it

738
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:49,845
Speaker 6:  kind of in an editorial way, right? It's kind of drafting a version of it

739
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:53,805
Speaker 6:  and then it's filling in the details of the script and then it's

740
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:56,885
Speaker 6:  revising the script based on the overall goals. Like there's a, there are

741
00:46:57,245 --> 00:47:01,045
Speaker 6:  multiple cycles of an basically an edit cycle and that takes

742
00:47:01,045 --> 00:47:03,525
Speaker 6:  time. And then crucially, there's a stage where,

743
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,805
Speaker 6:  my favorite new word is where disfluencies are added, right? So

744
00:47:08,805 --> 00:47:12,085
Speaker 6:  that it, it, it deliberately makes it kind of noisier and more like the,

745
00:47:12,105 --> 00:47:14,485
Speaker 6:  the way that people talk when they're in conversation where they overlap

746
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:17,125
Speaker 6:  and they have partial phrases, they complete each other's thoughts and stuff

747
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,645
Speaker 6:  like that. All the things that make a traditional transcript hard to read

748
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:24,405
Speaker 6:  if it's not been cleaned up If, you don't have those things in,

749
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,565
Speaker 6:  it's on the wrong side of the uncanny valley or it's right in the middle

750
00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:31,165
Speaker 6:  of the uncanny valley. I guess you can debate and obviously like

751
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:35,085
Speaker 6:  we're gonna, you can imagine we would introduce abilities to steer

752
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:38,605
Speaker 6:  in different directions and dial up, dial up down things or focus on different

753
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:42,485
Speaker 6:  topics, but the basic structure of kind

754
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,805
Speaker 6:  of, you know, doing this long edit cycle and then humanizing.

755
00:47:46,995 --> 00:47:50,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The thing I called wrong on this one

756
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:55,205
Speaker 1:  was that I thought audio overviews would be one of those things

757
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,685
Speaker 1:  that people were like, oh well this is silly, right? It's like every time

758
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:01,725
Speaker 1:  a new image generator comes out, a bunch of people make wild stuff with it

759
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:04,405
Speaker 1:  for 48 hours and then kind of move on and we don't talk about it anymore

760
00:48:04,405 --> 00:48:06,365
Speaker 1:  until some new image generat comes out

761
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:11,845
Speaker 1:  this one doesn't seem to have gone like that. And I think it it somewhere

762
00:48:12,065 --> 00:48:15,245
Speaker 1:  in between the, like, is it remarkable that it's possible

763
00:48:15,705 --> 00:48:19,645
Speaker 1:  versus is this actually useful? I think it is more in the, this is

764
00:48:19,885 --> 00:48:23,725
Speaker 1:  actually useful camp for people already than I expected it to be. Like, it's

765
00:48:23,725 --> 00:48:27,365
Speaker 1:  definitely remarkable that it's possible and you showed a, a sort of sincerely

766
00:48:27,465 --> 00:48:31,365
Speaker 1:  new thing you can do with ai and whenever that happens, people get

767
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:34,205
Speaker 1:  really excited on Twitter. Right? Like that, that's just one way to get people

768
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:37,845
Speaker 1:  really riled up on Twitter for 12 hours. But I think there was, you, you

769
00:48:37,855 --> 00:48:41,525
Speaker 1:  overlapped the, this actually does something for people side of things

770
00:48:42,075 --> 00:48:45,925
Speaker 1:  more than I expected when I first heard. You can make an AI podcast out

771
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:46,245
Speaker 1:  of your

772
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:49,325
Speaker 6:  Notes. Well, I want to thank you one for changing your mind,

773
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,365
Speaker 6:  but two, you remember how jobs used to have the kind of apples, the intersection

774
00:48:53,385 --> 00:48:57,285
Speaker 6:  of liberal arts and technology, whatever, like what you just described,

775
00:48:57,305 --> 00:49:00,845
Speaker 6:  the intersection of what is newly possible and what is genuinely useful.

776
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:04,725
Speaker 6:  Like that's what we're trying to do at Notebook

777
00:49:04,905 --> 00:49:07,845
Speaker 6:  and that's kind of what Labs is trying to do, right? Like it's just like,

778
00:49:08,235 --> 00:49:12,005
Speaker 6:  what can we do and what would actually be like, you know, what was unthinkable

779
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:15,445
Speaker 6:  six months ago and then what would would it be? And you know, part of it

780
00:49:15,465 --> 00:49:19,365
Speaker 6:  is, you know, I think in some cases people are using it like, I, I wanna

781
00:49:19,365 --> 00:49:23,165
Speaker 6:  study and this is a better way for me to, you know, take my documents and,

782
00:49:23,345 --> 00:49:27,165
Speaker 6:  and you know, just learn or learn on the go. The other thing is like creating

783
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:30,805
Speaker 6:  things that are effectively podcasts where n the

784
00:49:31,025 --> 00:49:34,085
Speaker 6:  no podcast would possibly ever exist in the real world, right? Sure. You

785
00:49:34,085 --> 00:49:37,525
Speaker 6:  know, so people are like, here's this very obscure niche topic that no one,

786
00:49:37,765 --> 00:49:40,645
Speaker 6:  like the economics of the podcast business will never support a podcast.

787
00:49:41,485 --> 00:49:44,605
Speaker 1:  I want the podcast on my d and d game that I play with my friends.

788
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:48,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, totally. And, and or it's like, you know,

789
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:52,645
Speaker 6:  we've seen people doing, like, again, thinking about a notebook element in

790
00:49:52,645 --> 00:49:56,485
Speaker 6:  a, in a kind of a team context at work. Like okay, like the week in

791
00:49:56,485 --> 00:50:00,285
Speaker 6:  review, like give it all your documents. I always say to people with one

792
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:03,445
Speaker 6:  of the best ways to get to know Notebook is to, if you're a Google

793
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:08,805
Speaker 6:  Docs and slides drive user, just grab, create a new notebook

794
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:12,365
Speaker 6:  and grab the last like, 20 docs that you've created and just create a notebook

795
00:50:12,365 --> 00:50:15,245
Speaker 6:  with that. Oh, that's fine. And then just ask it questions. And it's, it's

796
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,965
Speaker 6:  ability to kind of grasp like what you're working on and the issues and things

797
00:50:18,965 --> 00:50:22,045
Speaker 6:  like that. Do that and then create an audio overview. And it's like, this

798
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:25,245
Speaker 6:  is, this is what Steven was working on for the past week. You know, here's

799
00:50:25,545 --> 00:50:28,950
Speaker 6:  two happy and enthusiastic people to discuss like the things you've been

800
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:32,125
Speaker 6:  working on and sharing that with your team. Like

801
00:50:32,675 --> 00:50:36,125
Speaker 6:  it's pretty nice. Like that's a great way to like look back on the week and

802
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:39,965
Speaker 6:  think about what, what you've been working on and, and you know,

803
00:50:39,965 --> 00:50:42,045
Speaker 6:  you can imagine other ways to explore that as well.

804
00:50:42,545 --> 00:50:44,525
Speaker 1:  All right, a couple more questions. I know I've kept you a long time, but

805
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:46,645
Speaker 1:  I'll I'll I'll leave you on here in a minute. I can talk to you about this

806
00:50:46,645 --> 00:50:47,365
Speaker 1:  forever. Yeah,

807
00:50:47,365 --> 00:50:49,005
Speaker 6:  You're even better than talking to Bard.

808
00:50:49,635 --> 00:50:53,325
Speaker 1:  This is great. Anytime I'm here for you. I don't like skiing either. So

809
00:50:55,225 --> 00:50:58,725
Speaker 1:  do you think there's a like big mainstream

810
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:02,125
Speaker 1:  use case for something like Notebook lm Obviously there are

811
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:07,085
Speaker 1:  people and industries and jobs and schools, like I can imagine a

812
00:51:07,085 --> 00:51:10,565
Speaker 1:  bunch of people for whom this is useful. Do you think there is like an everyday

813
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:12,685
Speaker 1:  everybody use case for something like this?

814
00:51:13,745 --> 00:51:16,755
Speaker 6:  Everybody every day? I don't know, but I mean

815
00:51:17,055 --> 00:51:19,155
Speaker 1:  To me, like, let me put this in slightly different context, right? Google

816
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:21,795
Speaker 1:  is a company that is famous for making things that a billion people,

817
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:22,715
Speaker 6:  A billion people use. Yes.

818
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:25,795
Speaker 1:  Is there, is there a billion? Are there a billion notebook LM users out there?

819
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:30,075
Speaker 6:  I think If, you define it as there is an AI

820
00:51:30,385 --> 00:51:34,155
Speaker 6:  that is an expert in the

821
00:51:34,155 --> 00:51:38,075
Speaker 6:  information that is really relevant to you that you've, you've curated

822
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:42,485
Speaker 6:  and that you can engage with in different forms, whether it's chat or

823
00:51:42,485 --> 00:51:46,165
Speaker 6:  listening to an audio overview. And you can,

824
00:51:46,265 --> 00:51:50,245
Speaker 6:  you can basically cultivate your own personal AI with a lot

825
00:51:50,305 --> 00:51:54,045
Speaker 6:  of information. Maybe it's all your journals, maybe it's,

826
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:57,965
Speaker 6:  you know, your company's history, whatever it is. And just by like

827
00:51:59,175 --> 00:52:02,455
Speaker 6:  dragging and dropping files in there, like it develops this kind of knowledge

828
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:05,695
Speaker 6:  of everything that has happened to you or your organization and is able to

829
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:09,215
Speaker 6:  kind of deliver advice or help you make decisions or just

830
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:12,655
Speaker 6:  recall a fact that you're trying to remember and create these new documents.

831
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:17,255
Speaker 6:  Is that a big, like, will maybe a billion people

832
00:52:17,365 --> 00:52:20,615
Speaker 6:  like be doing some variation of that in five years?

833
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:24,895
Speaker 6:  I, I think that's pretty plausible. 'cause there's so many different things

834
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:28,655
Speaker 6:  you could do in that kind of context. You know, it could be like a writer

835
00:52:28,655 --> 00:52:31,495
Speaker 6:  working on a book, but it could be an executive trying to make a complicated

836
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:35,095
Speaker 6:  decision or it could just be somebody trying to remember things that have

837
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:37,895
Speaker 6:  happened in their lives and it's like just keeping a journal. Only you've

838
00:52:37,895 --> 00:52:41,815
Speaker 6:  got an AI that's helping you do it. Yeah. So I. I, I think there's

839
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:42,615
Speaker 6:  a big market for it.

840
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:45,735
Speaker 1:  Okay. You know what I've been thinking about as you, as you were saying that

841
00:52:45,735 --> 00:52:48,695
Speaker 1:  there's this app called My Mind. Have you ever, have you ever seen it? I've

842
00:52:48,695 --> 00:52:49,295
Speaker 6:  Seen it a little bit.

843
00:52:49,295 --> 00:52:51,575
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's a great app. You should, you should play with it. I think you

844
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:53,935
Speaker 1:  of all people would, would enjoy some of the AI stuff they're doing. But

845
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:58,535
Speaker 1:  I've started using that app and I've gotten in the habit of basically every

846
00:52:58,535 --> 00:53:02,135
Speaker 1:  time I encounter something I like I just put it there. Yeah. Like if I,

847
00:53:02,415 --> 00:53:05,935
Speaker 1:  a podcast or a video or a thing I read or a photo I take or a quote that

848
00:53:05,935 --> 00:53:09,335
Speaker 1:  I see, I just, I'm just pouring it all in there with no organization, no

849
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:11,575
Speaker 1:  nothing. Yeah. And there's nothing particularly special about that app. It's

850
00:53:11,575 --> 00:53:14,295
Speaker 1:  just like, it's pretty to look at So, I like using it

851
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:19,215
Speaker 1:  and already just the thing where you, you open it up and it's,

852
00:53:19,215 --> 00:53:21,855
Speaker 1:  it, it's, it has a bunch of modes where you can just type in like movies

853
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:24,375
Speaker 1:  and it'll show you all the movies and movie adjacent stuff that you've been

854
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:27,365
Speaker 1:  saving. And it's like, there's something really powerful about, like, here

855
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:30,685
Speaker 1:  is just a compendium of stuff that I find interesting. Yeah. And

856
00:53:30,955 --> 00:53:34,845
Speaker 1:  there's just enough manual work in that that I think

857
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:38,325
Speaker 1:  it's, it's, there's something to solve in the, like how do you

858
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:42,405
Speaker 1:  collect that data from people in a way that is both sort of easy and frictionless,

859
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:45,285
Speaker 1:  but also not like gross and privacy invading

860
00:53:46,635 --> 00:53:49,605
Speaker 1:  that is like the eternal Google question. Yeah. I have high hopes that somebody

861
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:50,405
Speaker 1:  will figure it out eventually.

862
00:53:50,755 --> 00:53:54,645
Speaker 6:  That is a bias that I've always had probably to a fault that, you know,

863
00:53:54,795 --> 00:53:58,605
Speaker 6:  like we don't, we really don't have face, we don't even have kind of folders

864
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:02,485
Speaker 6:  for your sources or your notes or things like that. Like basic kind of low

865
00:54:02,485 --> 00:54:06,125
Speaker 6:  level things that we will no doubt add, but we've been focused on these kind

866
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:09,845
Speaker 6:  of cooler features. But part of me is like the beauty, like this,

867
00:54:10,025 --> 00:54:13,325
Speaker 6:  the complex systems of organization where you're tagging things and putting

868
00:54:13,325 --> 00:54:17,245
Speaker 6:  them into the right folder and stuff like that are not as necessary now

869
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:20,805
Speaker 6:  because the AI does that and makes the connections for you and finds the

870
00:54:20,805 --> 00:54:24,565
Speaker 6:  thing that you're looking for. So just have one place, make it easy to grab

871
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:28,525
Speaker 6:  as much stuff from as many different places and just dump it into a

872
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:32,645
Speaker 6:  notebook and then we'll do the magic. And figuring out the

873
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:36,165
Speaker 6:  connections or the finding the information you want after that, again is,

874
00:54:36,385 --> 00:54:39,965
Speaker 6:  you said it correctly before, like the closest thing to this before was

875
00:54:39,965 --> 00:54:43,525
Speaker 6:  Wikipedia. Like I start here in this Wikipedia page about

876
00:54:43,725 --> 00:54:47,685
Speaker 6:  elephants and then I follow it following these interesting paths. But a

877
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:51,765
Speaker 6:  dialogue is just an even better way to do that and if, if it's

878
00:54:51,765 --> 00:54:55,585
Speaker 6:  trustworthy. And so the mode that

879
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:59,465
Speaker 6:  I really love is, and, and again, this is only possible with conversation

880
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:03,265
Speaker 6:  history and long context, is to go on one of those like

881
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:07,955
Speaker 6:  exploratory conversations through an idea. And then at the end

882
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:11,635
Speaker 6:  you're like, okay, this has been great. Will you format that all

883
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,995
Speaker 6:  as a as single document that just says kind of key take takeaways and insights

884
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:17,675
Speaker 6:  from it. So I can just capture it for later. 'cause I don't necessarily wanna

885
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:20,035
Speaker 6:  read the whole conversation again, but I want to, I want to get the like

886
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:24,395
Speaker 6:  great pieces from it and boom, it does it And you say that and that's your

887
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:28,315
Speaker 6:  kind of record of, of what you just did. Like that, I mean,

888
00:55:28,585 --> 00:55:32,515
Speaker 6:  like, that's a beautiful way to, to walk through information space

889
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:36,555
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And full of surprise and, and unexpected turns

890
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:39,475
Speaker 6:  and discovery so that, that feels like a keeper.

891
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:43,115
Speaker 1:  What's the next step in getting better at that? Like, one, one thing that

892
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:46,875
Speaker 1:  it seems to me that we need pretty badly in that

893
00:55:46,935 --> 00:55:49,955
Speaker 1:  way of thinking, which I love, like, I love the idea of just like, I'm gonna

894
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:51,955
Speaker 1:  sit here and spend three hours learning about something and then at the end

895
00:55:51,955 --> 00:55:54,555
Speaker 1:  you're gonna deliver me like a handy summary of everything that I've learned.

896
00:55:54,555 --> 00:55:58,395
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Amazing. Yeah, that's the dream. It does strike me that one thing we

897
00:55:58,395 --> 00:56:00,955
Speaker 1:  desperately need all of these tools to get better at, to pull that off is

898
00:56:00,955 --> 00:56:04,435
Speaker 1:  multimedia, right? Like, I want to know at the end of it, like, go listen

899
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:07,115
Speaker 1:  to these, these three podcasts and this YouTuber you're gonna, you're gonna

900
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:09,995
Speaker 1:  love and go check it out. And this person on Instagram is doing all, there's

901
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:13,875
Speaker 1:  like, there's, the internet is such a messy place in the best

902
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:16,955
Speaker 1:  way now that it feels like that's one thing. And I know a lot of folks are

903
00:56:16,955 --> 00:56:20,755
Speaker 1:  working on that. Are there other things that you look at and you know, you're,

904
00:56:20,755 --> 00:56:24,645
Speaker 1:  you're working on this stuff too. Is there a next kind of turn coming that's

905
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:25,685
Speaker 1:  gonna make all that stuff even better

906
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:29,125
Speaker 6:  Right now? Notebook's ability to help you

907
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:33,495
Speaker 6:  discover information to put in your notebook is

908
00:56:33,525 --> 00:56:37,375
Speaker 6:  exactly zero. Like no, it does nothing in that.

909
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:41,295
Speaker 6:  You are on your own. You need to supply the sources, right? We will not help

910
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:45,255
Speaker 6:  you discover anything across the internet, any in any form.

911
00:56:45,955 --> 00:56:49,575
Speaker 6:  It turns out just as a coincidence that

912
00:56:49,835 --> 00:56:53,695
Speaker 6:  Google is really good at that stuff. Like I did not know,

913
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:55,975
Speaker 6:  I learned when I got there, they have this search thing that is apparently

914
00:56:56,135 --> 00:56:59,455
Speaker 6:  a lot of people use. So it's obviously like a place where,

915
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:03,615
Speaker 6:  you know, I would love it. I I want it to be source grounded, but I would

916
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:07,535
Speaker 6:  love you to stay in Notebook to be able to find things and you know,

917
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:11,495
Speaker 6:  we, we would, we would be really interested in, in exploring that. I think

918
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:13,295
Speaker 6:  you, you'll see that in 2025 for sure.

919
00:57:14,315 --> 00:57:17,015
Speaker 1:  All right, that is it for The Vergecast today. Thanks again to Steven for
