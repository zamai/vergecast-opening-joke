Description: It's a slowish news week ahead of some very busy news weeks, so of course Nilay and David start the show with a long discussion about party speakers. Eventually, they get into the news, beginning with some of the huge Apple redesigns planned for WWDC in June. For the first time in a long time, the stakes for Apple's software teams feel really high. After that, the hosts talk about Nilay's recent interview with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and what the AI-ification of everything means for the future of the web. Finally, in the lightning round, it's time for another Brendan Carr is a Dummy, plus some talk about the Nintendo Switch 2, a bit of confusing tariff news, and more.


2
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:21,165
Speaker 4:  Hello and welcome to broadcast the flagship podcast of the

3
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,605
Speaker 4:  United States Party Speaker industry.

4
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:23,805
Speaker 6:  Only the US

5
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:26,565
Speaker 4:  I don't know that there is a US party speaker industry.

6
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:29,805
Speaker 6:  It's a global marketplace, Eli.

7
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:32,965
Speaker 4:  It's happening everywhere. I, I don't know where they're manufactured, I

8
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:36,485
Speaker 4:  don't know who designs them. I've been begging one of these companies to

9
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,805
Speaker 4:  let me into the room with their designers where they plan the next year's

10
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:42,715
Speaker 4:  party speaker lineup. Imagine that meeting.

11
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:47,425
Speaker 4:  Someone's like, make it put more lights on it and another person's like,

12
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,105
Speaker 4:  no, we can't afford it. You've gone too far.

13
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:53,385
Speaker 6:  I like to think of it as like a, there's like a price to lights

14
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:57,545
Speaker 6:  to size continuum and they're just like sort of sliding the thing

15
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:01,465
Speaker 6:  along the scale. And if you get too many lights, it's too expensive. But

16
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:05,265
Speaker 6:  if you get too big, you can have more lights. And so it's, they're just,

17
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:08,265
Speaker 6:  it's there. It's a lot of triangulation. But this is what product work is.

18
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:11,465
Speaker 4:  That's what I'm saying. There's a spreadsheet, there's a model. Someone's

19
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,545
Speaker 4:  got a slider. McKinsey's in there, you know.

20
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,225
Speaker 4:  Hi, I'm your friend Neli. That's David Pierce.

21
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:17,785
Speaker 6:  Hello.

22
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:22,265
Speaker 4:  It's just the two of us today. We're doing a concentrated dose of Neli and

23
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:25,185
Speaker 4:  David because you know, eventually we're both gonna have children and leave,

24
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:25,625
Speaker 6:  Right?

25
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,465
Speaker 4:  So you gotta get it all while you can.

26
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,465
Speaker 6:  Yeah, this is going to be 19 hours of just us yelling at each other

27
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,505
Speaker 6:  about the internet.

28
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:36,265
Speaker 4:  It's also a slow week, which actually usually means the show goes longer

29
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:40,225
Speaker 4:  than ever. Yeah, I, I don know why that is, but when we have

30
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:43,705
Speaker 4:  nothing to talk about, it's like a three hour show. So buckle up. It's gonna

31
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,665
Speaker 4:  be wild. A little housekeeping before we start. We've got a survey going

32
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:49,705
Speaker 4:  on, we just want feedback from the audience. It's fox

33
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:53,385
Speaker 4:  media.com/survey. Go take that. Let us know what you think and how we're

34
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:57,305
Speaker 4:  doing. And then I should remind you that no one can tell us what to do,

35
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:01,645
Speaker 4:  which is important. We don't do the ad reads, we don't do brand

36
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:05,525
Speaker 4:  sponsorships. I'm not out here trying to sell flavored water. Although

37
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:08,485
Speaker 4:  I have been thinking about selling a vodka for a number of years. That might

38
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:12,085
Speaker 4:  be the one exception to, it's a long story. Some people know.

39
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:15,325
Speaker 4:  But the reason that we are able to have total editorial independence and

40
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:18,725
Speaker 4:  we don't talk to our sales team and we don't do the brand sponsorships that

41
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:21,885
Speaker 4:  everyone else has to do is 'cause we are, we get support from all of you.

42
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:25,765
Speaker 4:  So right now VERGE subscriptions are on sale. They're 40% off.

43
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:29,445
Speaker 4:  We're kind of running 'em through developer season. So through the end of

44
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:33,525
Speaker 4:  wwc, basically you can go to The Verge dot com slash subscribe. They're

45
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:37,325
Speaker 4:  40% off. It's like $35 for the year cheap. And you get to support our whole

46
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:40,565
Speaker 4:  newsroom. And most importantly, what you are buying

47
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:45,225
Speaker 4:  is our editorial independence. No one gets to tell us what

48
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,265
Speaker 4:  to do. It's very powerful. It's a very powerful tool in our arsenal. We've,

49
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:52,025
Speaker 4:  we've relied on it for a long time and it's because you all

50
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:55,205
Speaker 4:  have supported us. There's this thing, we always say that

51
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:59,325
Speaker 4:  like anyone can get traffic, but it's really hard to have an audience. You

52
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:02,125
Speaker 4:  are the audience. That's you. Thank you. We appreciate you. Now give us your

53
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,645
Speaker 4:  money. I'm still learning how to be a salesperson.

54
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:08,645
Speaker 6:  Step one, editorial independence. Step two, Neela gets less awkward

55
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:11,965
Speaker 6:  asking you for money. Step three, everybody gets boats. That's, that's the

56
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:12,965
Speaker 6:  move here. That's what we're doing.

57
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:16,325
Speaker 4:  It's not a yachts industry. We're gonna come to what's going on on the web,

58
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:18,045
Speaker 4:  in the media in, in the second segment.

59
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:23,805
Speaker 4:  But I wanna start actually 'cause it's a slow week. I wanna start with

60
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,765
Speaker 4:  an actual party speaker update. We've been getting a lot of photos of party

61
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:31,365
Speaker 4:  speakers from all of you. As you probably know. I

62
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:35,125
Speaker 4:  believe party speakers are undercovered. They're a

63
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:39,085
Speaker 4:  massive market. They're many, many, many companies have

64
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:42,605
Speaker 4:  made giant Bluetooth speaker, like giant speakers

65
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:46,705
Speaker 4:  that have LED lights around the speakers, around the speaker drivers.

66
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:50,465
Speaker 4:  Some of them have handles that we've covered them that have literal beer

67
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,025
Speaker 4:  can holders. Sony made one with beer can holders.

68
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:57,305
Speaker 6:  It's the rare industry I think that knows exactly what It is it like,

69
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,705
Speaker 6:  which I have come to really appreciate.

70
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:01,865
Speaker 4:  These are a huge success story. Yeah. And they're undercovered 'cause everyone

71
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:05,305
Speaker 4:  wants to talk about Sam Altman writing a pony or whatever he did today. But

72
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,785
Speaker 4:  like the, the consumer electronics industry is doing

73
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:12,065
Speaker 4:  something right 'cause they've been making these and iterating on them for

74
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:15,945
Speaker 4:  decades and they are everywhere. Once you see them you realize like, oh

75
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:19,345
Speaker 4:  this is as big as the iPhone. Okay. Maybe not as big as the iPhone, but you

76
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:22,225
Speaker 4:  understand what I'm saying. Like everyone has them. They're all over the

77
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:22,345
Speaker 4:  place.

78
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:24,505
Speaker 6:  Physically. Much larger than the iPhone. Physically

79
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:28,465
Speaker 4:  Much larger. Yeah. But it's a cultural phenomenon. Yeah.

80
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:31,825
Speaker 4:  They're just part of the fabric. They're just everywhere. And no one talks

81
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:32,105
Speaker 4:  about them.

82
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:36,025
Speaker 6:  They're so entrenched that I think the, the great service

83
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:39,105
Speaker 6:  that you in particular have done for people is you have opened their eyes

84
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,705
Speaker 6:  to the party speakers that are everywhere. They're everywhere. Because like,

85
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:46,385
Speaker 6:  this has been my experience is that I have started noticing in places

86
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:49,385
Speaker 6:  that a party speaker has no business being,

87
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:53,945
Speaker 6:  there's almost always a party speaker. Like wherever you are, you

88
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:56,865
Speaker 6:  are within a hundred yards of a party speaker. I really have come to believe

89
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:57,220
Speaker 6:  that, that

90
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:57,765
Speaker 4:  That's true.

91
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:01,965
Speaker 6:  And and they're just so, they're so ubiquitous that we just don't even notice

92
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:02,525
Speaker 6:  them anymore.

93
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,325
Speaker 4:  They're so big you can't see 'em.

94
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:05,125
Speaker 6:  Exactly.

95
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,805
Speaker 4:  It's crazy. So people have sent us lots of pictures of party speakers. We

96
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:12,565
Speaker 4:  had pictures of party speakers, literally next to fa eighteens being

97
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:15,885
Speaker 4:  repaired. The maybe the high point of the entire birch cast to date.

98
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:18,085
Speaker 4:  But we've got some new ones

99
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:23,165
Speaker 4:  and I gotta say there's some wild stuff going on in the world.

100
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,965
Speaker 4:  So here's our first one. It's from Alan. It's it's graduation season out

101
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:31,335
Speaker 4:  there. We're getting a lot of photos of party speakers at

102
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,575
Speaker 4:  proms. Yes.

103
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:33,375
Speaker 6:  Getting

104
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,815
Speaker 4:  Ready at proms back pro prom. It makes sense.

105
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,695
Speaker 4:  I understand teenagers want light up speakers while they're all dressed up

106
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:43,975
Speaker 6:  Anywhere. There is like a school official and a stage. There is a party speaker

107
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:47,255
Speaker 4:  Somewhere. Yep. And tons, tons and tons and tons of commence commencement

108
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:50,255
Speaker 4:  addresses being delivered through party speakers in the little karaoke mics.

109
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:54,215
Speaker 4:  Yes, but here's this picture from Alan who sent it in. This is a

110
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:58,175
Speaker 4:  graduation procession of some kind. And I replied and said, is that on

111
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:01,135
Speaker 4:  her head? And the answer is it's on her head.

112
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:05,755
Speaker 4:  And so she's leading a graduation procession and she's

113
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:08,555
Speaker 4:  carrying the party speaker on her head. No,

114
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:11,955
Speaker 6:  No, no, no. But if you're watching this on video, Nila just put both hands

115
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:15,195
Speaker 6:  up. This woman does not have both hands up. Yes. It's

116
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,315
Speaker 4:  One, it's one huge bazooka party speaker.

117
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:20,955
Speaker 6:  This woman is in like a light dress and a red hat and is carrying a party

118
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:24,715
Speaker 6:  speaker on her head with one hand. Which is so

119
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:25,595
Speaker 4:  It's a lot

120
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,755
Speaker 6:  Spectacularly. Physically impressive. There's so much

121
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,875
Speaker 6:  about this. I have questions about like the, the graduation parade is an

122
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,435
Speaker 6:  incredible idea that every school should do. Yeah. There's a

123
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:40,075
Speaker 6:  surprisingly large like police and ambulance presence for this, which I have

124
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:43,555
Speaker 6:  questions about. But it's, it's this, it's this woman in a flowy dress just

125
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:47,475
Speaker 6:  like sauntering down the street. One arm party speaker on the head. Baz

126
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:50,635
Speaker 4:  Like Baz, unbelievable size party speaker. So this is incredible.

127
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:54,395
Speaker 4:  This is, this is among the best graduation photos we've gotten.

128
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,835
Speaker 4:  Keep keep 'em coming. 'cause if you notice them at, at graduations and proms,

129
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:02,475
Speaker 4:  they're, they're everywhere. I would, I would go so far as to say our nation's

130
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:05,115
Speaker 4:  high schools are powered entirely by party speakers at this point.

131
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:06,035
Speaker 6:  It seems like it.

132
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:10,275
Speaker 4:  We've gotten an infinite number of photos of baseball and

133
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:13,355
Speaker 4:  softball games. It's baseball and softball season for the kids. My daughter's

134
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:16,555
Speaker 4:  playing softball. There's party speakers there. Yep. Lots and lots of that

135
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:20,395
Speaker 4:  going on. Very cool market for party speakers. Very curious.

136
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:24,535
Speaker 4:  Who gets playlist control dying to know how that works and

137
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:28,055
Speaker 4:  the politics of playlist control for walk-on music at softball games? Do

138
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:32,055
Speaker 4:  each of the teams have different party speakers? Or if the coaches coordinated?

139
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:32,295
Speaker 4:  I

140
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,775
Speaker 6:  Don't know. Is it like a Spotify jam situation where

141
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,735
Speaker 4:  Everybody, you see what I, you see what I'm saying? Does

142
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:37,695
Speaker 6:  Max have a walkup song?

143
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:40,535
Speaker 4:  Max does not yet have a walkup song and if she did it would be one of the

144
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:44,415
Speaker 4:  songs from Frozen. So I think or Frozen two rather. That would

145
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:45,135
Speaker 4:  be just

146
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:49,175
Speaker 6:  Like metal. Do you want to build a snowman and up comes max to bat. It's

147
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:49,335
Speaker 6:  a lot.

148
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:54,495
Speaker 4:  It's or Taylor Swift And so, but it would be Wildest Dreams, which is

149
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:57,285
Speaker 4:  her favorite Taylor Swift song. And I don't know that that's a great softball

150
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:57,965
Speaker 4:  walk rock

151
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:01,165
Speaker 6:  On song. I think the 10 minute all too well is is the one and just stand

152
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,885
Speaker 6:  in the battered box all 10 minutes. Really? Psych up the

153
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:05,165
Speaker 6:  pitcher.

154
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:08,845
Speaker 4:  Okay. Lots and lots and lots of party seekers at kids softball.

155
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:12,305
Speaker 4:  But Luis sent us a, a tip

156
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:15,695
Speaker 4:  that the Yankees put up an Instagram post.

157
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:20,395
Speaker 4:  You gotta see this picture you got if you're in your car, just like stop

158
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,315
Speaker 4:  and pull over and we'll put the click on the link in the show notes. The

159
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:27,155
Speaker 4:  Instagram post or watch the video on YouTube. It's Jason Dominguez. It's

160
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:30,995
Speaker 4:  Jason with two S's and he is getting on a plane. This is very important.

161
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:34,555
Speaker 4:  The caption of this carousel is airplane mode 'cause they're obviously traveling

162
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:37,635
Speaker 4:  to a game and he's carrying a massive

163
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,995
Speaker 4:  white JBL party speaker onto this plane. Like it's the size of a

164
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:45,875
Speaker 4:  carry-on suitcase. It looks hot as shit by the way. Like I was

165
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,435
Speaker 4:  like I should buy the speaker. It's the JBL party stage three 20. It retails

166
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:53,195
Speaker 4:  for 5 99. It's sometimes on sale for 5 49. Good lord.

167
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:57,075
Speaker 4:  It has not one but two handles. There's one handle on the back with Jason

168
00:09:57,335 --> 00:10:01,075
Speaker 4:  in the photo. He is carrying it by the back handle. But he also has the

169
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,115
Speaker 4:  pop-up handle that you can wheel it around

170
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:06,425
Speaker 4:  I am in a workplace where we're not allowed to wear headphones. A lot of

171
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:10,385
Speaker 4:  machine shops, right? Airplane technicians, all kinds of places where safety

172
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:13,425
Speaker 4:  requires that you need open ears that you'll be able to hear. And so we've

173
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,625
Speaker 4:  heard a lot of stories about competing party speakers.

174
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:20,255
Speaker 4:  So I'm just, are the Yankees in a similar situation on their plane?

175
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:24,895
Speaker 4:  But I'm telling you, party speakers have infected the sport of baseball.

176
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:28,015
Speaker 4:  They're everywhere in baseball. Yes. They're part of the fabric now of baseball.

177
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:31,695
Speaker 4:  So this picture's incredible. Jason, if you wanna come on the show and talk

178
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:35,055
Speaker 4:  about the JBL stage three 20. I don't know if you're sponsored. I was

179
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:38,775
Speaker 6:  Gonna say my great hope for this is that JBL sponsors Jason

180
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:09,925
Speaker 4:  office with a massive JBL party speaker

181
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:13,845
Speaker 4:  in a what appears to be like a reasonably small waiting room. But it's it's,

182
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:17,205
Speaker 4:  it's huge. Like it's for, it's like the PA for a small concert.

183
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:20,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Look at this thing. If you walked into your dentist's office and you

184
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:23,845
Speaker 4:  saw this thing, you'd be like, kick out the jams brother, let's go. It's

185
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:27,535
Speaker 4:  incredible. Love it. This is what I mean. They're everywhere people like

186
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:31,055
Speaker 4:  there's not even etiquette around them anymore. The dentist was like, screw

187
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:31,695
Speaker 4:  it, light it up.

188
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:36,055
Speaker 6:  What's weird about this one to me is like there are smaller Bluetooth

189
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,935
Speaker 6:  speakers out there that are very good. Like I tell a lot of people to buy

190
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:43,695
Speaker 6:  like the the UE booms. There's a lot of those. And if all you're doing is

191
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:47,695
Speaker 6:  pumping music into your waiting room, 99 bucks will get you as

192
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:51,655
Speaker 6:  much speaker as you need to do the job here. No. And they're like, no, I

193
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:54,055
Speaker 6:  need a speaker the size of a third grader.

194
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:57,855
Speaker 4:  We're gonna rattle your teeth loose man. Let's, let's get this done.

195
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,415
Speaker 4:  This one is so big it has feet so it can go horizontally and serve as a bench.

196
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:07,855
Speaker 4:  It's very good. Everywhere you look man, they're everywhere. And I'm telling

197
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,895
Speaker 4:  you, the etiquette is at the window. Right. That

198
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:14,375
Speaker 4:  normal people would not have thought to put a speaker of the size and a dentist

199
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,215
Speaker 4:  office his waiting room.

200
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,335
Speaker 6:  It's true. This is innovation.

201
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:21,645
Speaker 4:  All right. And then the last one, my favorite one, our old

202
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:24,765
Speaker 4:  producer Creighton, he worked on The Vergecast before he worked on decoder

203
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:29,045
Speaker 4:  part of The Verge story for years and years. Creighton sends in,

204
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:33,045
Speaker 4:  he, he texted me actually from Rome. He was in what

205
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,005
Speaker 4:  appears to be like a soccer store, a football store. It's

206
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:40,005
Speaker 4:  Rome. And he is like, there's a party speaker here. The owner told me he

207
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,365
Speaker 4:  wanted one of the CD player 'cause the audio quality is better. So it has

208
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:46,045
Speaker 4:  a CD player at the top. The owner also told him Sony was the best

209
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:49,845
Speaker 4:  branded party speaker, which is a hot take. I think Sony was a progenitor

210
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:53,805
Speaker 4:  of the space, but in many cases JBL is doing better brand

211
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:57,425
Speaker 4:  integrations. You can see it. And then Ion is fast

212
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,105
Speaker 4:  approaching from the rear. I don't know what ion

213
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,225
Speaker 6:  Is ion the company. We still don't understand. If

214
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:05,085
Speaker 4:  You work at Ion, lemme know. I don't, I I think you might be like

215
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,965
Speaker 4:  a ghost company anyway. This is an ancient Sony party speaker CD player in

216
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:12,445
Speaker 4:  the top. It's kicking out the jams in a, in a store in in, in Rome.

217
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:16,565
Speaker 4:  And I, the only reason I wanna bring it up is 'cause if you zoom in on the

218
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,765
Speaker 4:  picture on the top here and you look for the mega base button,

219
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:24,085
Speaker 4:  you can see that it has been pushed so many times

220
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:28,285
Speaker 4:  that the letters are starting to wear off. None of the other buttons

221
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:32,055
Speaker 4:  have this problem. Right. The w party chain

222
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:35,375
Speaker 4:  has not been pushed so many times. The word sound field has not been pushed

223
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,775
Speaker 4:  so many times. The letters mega base has been pushed so many times

224
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:43,535
Speaker 4:  the the letters are wearing off. Which implies to me

225
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:49,215
Speaker 4:  that whoever owns this party speaker has determined there is a time for megabase.

226
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:51,805
Speaker 4:  And there is a time when you should not have mega base.

227
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:54,845
Speaker 6:  Well right. Because you have to turn it both on and off. It is, this is not

228
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:55,565
Speaker 6:  a permanent state.

229
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:59,045
Speaker 4:  You're turning it on and off all the time. Yeah. And I would just like to

230
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:02,965
Speaker 4:  know what times are mega base times and what times are definitively not

231
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:03,725
Speaker 4:  mega based times.

232
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:05,605
Speaker 6:  I think it's pretty easy because

233
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,925
Speaker 4:  This button is not one you should push. You should push it once and be like

234
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:09,925
Speaker 4:  the mega base is on.

235
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:13,965
Speaker 6:  But if you go mega base all the time, is it mega base anymore? Do you know

236
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:16,685
Speaker 6:  what I mean? Don't you like you need to live without in order to appreciate

237
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:17,965
Speaker 6:  what you have. Right.

238
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,485
Speaker 4:  You can't have lab parts on this. Have quiet parts. It's like a core Exactly.

239
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:23,525
Speaker 4:  Conceit of ver storytelling. Exactly. I'm with you. Exactly. I'm just saying

240
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:26,805
Speaker 4:  it's rare that you see a mega base button that has been pushed this many

241
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:30,245
Speaker 4:  times. I'm dying to know, as you know, we're no longer in the mega base era.

242
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:34,485
Speaker 4:  I think the Megabase era really that was the height of American

243
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:38,085
Speaker 4:  like soft power around the world. The eighties and nineties, the mega base

244
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:41,885
Speaker 4:  era we were doing it. We, I mean that's when people look back fondly. That's

245
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:45,725
Speaker 4:  when America was great that Sony moved on to ultra base. And I think

246
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:49,125
Speaker 4:  things really, really started falling down a cliff. And now we're in the

247
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,085
Speaker 4:  ULT Power Sound era and fully just off the rails. I couldn't even tell

248
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,765
Speaker 4:  you what's going on. Bring it back. Sony executive order, 1012

249
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:59,285
Speaker 4:  mega base shell return to American soil

250
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:03,165
Speaker 6:  Mega base told you the truth about what it was we need, we need more of that

251
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:03,845
Speaker 6:  ULT

252
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:06,885
Speaker 4:  Power sound. Get outta here. All right. Yeah. That's the party speaker update.

253
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:10,485
Speaker 4:  Thank you to everyone who sent them in. Let me know what you think the times

254
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:14,365
Speaker 4:  for Megabase are and are not. I'm dying to let me know what you think the

255
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:18,355
Speaker 4:  etiquette of these speakers are. 'cause they're everywhere man. And as always,

256
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:22,555
Speaker 4:  I thank you all for thinking of me. When you see

257
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:26,065
Speaker 4:  a giant speaker in the wild, like you have, you have, I have, I don't have

258
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:30,025
Speaker 4:  like massive ambitions to fame. You know, it, it's not, it's not what

259
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:30,665
Speaker 4:  motivates me,

260
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,875
Speaker 4:  but when people see a giant stupid speaker, there's a flicker of

261
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,195
Speaker 4:  recognition that these should tell me. That's pretty good.

262
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:40,875
Speaker 6:  It is good. I'll I'll take it. It's, you've accomplished something. I

263
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,355
Speaker 4:  Don't, I don't need much more than that. It's pretty good. All right. We

264
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:46,435
Speaker 4:  should get to some actual tech news for the people who are mad that we spend

265
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:49,475
Speaker 4:  so much time on party speakers every so often. I'm sorry, but that's what

266
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,635
Speaker 4:  the mo that's why you pay us the money.

267
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:54,835
Speaker 6:  Get a party speaker and play it loudly next to whatever you're listening

268
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,995
Speaker 6:  to The Verge cast on. And you don't have to hear us talk about it. It's

269
00:16:58,065 --> 00:17:01,875
Speaker 4:  Very hit that mega base button, man. Let's live this life. All right.

270
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:05,635
Speaker 4:  There's some actual techniques in the world. It feels like we're in the

271
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:08,355
Speaker 4:  runup to the runup to ww DC,

272
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:13,875
Speaker 4:  A lot of weird vibes around Apple in this wwc, right? Yes. Google just

273
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,315
Speaker 4:  came off io which we'll we'll talk about in a little bit. There's some reactions

274
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:19,795
Speaker 4:  to Google's confidence and the products it might be building.

275
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:23,915
Speaker 4:  Obviously OpenAI announced its deal with Johnny

276
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:27,795
Speaker 4:  Ive and love from, they're in a moment. And then Apple's,

277
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:31,395
Speaker 4:  you know, they're, they're gonna have wwc, they will project confidence.

278
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:35,195
Speaker 4:  They're good at it. A lot of question marks around what Apple might be doing.

279
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:38,595
Speaker 4:  What its fives are. I got a weird open letter from a group of Apple fans

280
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:42,515
Speaker 4:  today demanding that the company do better at ai. And

281
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,675
Speaker 4:  at the bottom of the open letter it said, this letter was generated by chat

282
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:48,195
Speaker 4:  GBT. And I was like, well this is, I'm throwing this out the window so don't

283
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:48,515
Speaker 4:  do this to me,

284
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:54,125
Speaker 4:  but like that's the level of weirdness. Yeah, right. Like

285
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,765
Speaker 4:  open letters to Apple to reclaim the mantle of innovation.

286
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:01,605
Speaker 4:  That's some like late nineties, early 2000 stuff. That's not,

287
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:06,085
Speaker 4:  that's not been how anyone has felt about Apple for years now. And like

288
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,565
Speaker 4:  here we are.

289
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:11,085
Speaker 6:  I do think you could argue this, apple is sort of

290
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:13,645
Speaker 6:  at its weakest position

291
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:18,365
Speaker 6:  perception wise in a very, very, very long time because right, there's

292
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,565
Speaker 6:  all the AI stuff, there's all of the regulatory stuff, which it just continues

293
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:26,525
Speaker 6:  to lose in increasingly spectacular ways while

294
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:30,325
Speaker 6:  continuing also to alienate developers. Like everything that I'm hearing

295
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:34,285
Speaker 6:  about Apple and all these changes from developers, they understand

296
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:37,765
Speaker 6:  that Apple is being like bullied into making these changes that are obviously

297
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:41,165
Speaker 6:  good for developers and users. And It is not making anybody feel better about

298
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:45,045
Speaker 6:  Apple. Then there's also this thing that has gone around where

299
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:48,525
Speaker 6:  Tim Cook has lost his influence with the Trump administration. And so this

300
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:52,325
Speaker 6:  idea that he was like the, the all powerful whisperer of

301
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:54,965
Speaker 6:  the government who could get everything done and save tariffs and everything

302
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:58,245
Speaker 6:  was gonna be fine. That has waned. Like there's, there's this real sense

303
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:02,085
Speaker 6:  that the, the sort of overall bloom is off the rose at Apple.

304
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:05,845
Speaker 6:  And whether that's deserved or not or whether that something matters or not,

305
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:09,925
Speaker 6:  we'll see. But It is fascinating how much that

306
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:13,885
Speaker 6:  perception has changed. Like all of the things that Apple could sort of

307
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:17,805
Speaker 6:  clinging to for a long time seem to be degrading

308
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:21,285
Speaker 6:  all at once, which I think means the stakes for this WWDC and then the

309
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:25,125
Speaker 6:  iPhone launched in September are maybe as

310
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:29,165
Speaker 6:  high or higher than any I can remember before, like right

311
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,805
Speaker 6:  after Steve's jobs died, there was that big transition where it was like,

312
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:35,445
Speaker 6:  okay, what is Apple now and, and what is, what is going to be

313
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:38,765
Speaker 6:  kind of, how is this company gonna project itself going forward? That's the

314
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:42,165
Speaker 6:  last time I can remember coming into something like this being like, oh,

315
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:45,845
Speaker 6:  it actually really matters what Apple does here and how it talks about itself.

316
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:49,925
Speaker 4:  I have a slightly different view. I don't, I don't disagree about that moment.

317
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:54,245
Speaker 4:  Right. Apple needed to change its conception of itself. I think Tim Cook

318
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:58,165
Speaker 4:  made the company at Financial Juggernaut on the back

319
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:02,085
Speaker 4:  of it's basically distribution monopoly of

320
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:05,685
Speaker 4:  applications, right? Like in the smartphone era,

321
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,045
Speaker 4:  the only way you could get an app to someone was through Apple

322
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:13,405
Speaker 4:  Store or Google Store. Yeah. And people are not gonna like that. I'm saying

323
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:17,085
Speaker 4:  this, but the iOS store had richer people

324
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:19,045
Speaker 4:  using it and those people spent more money.

325
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,045
Speaker 6:  And also Google Store works the way it does in large part because of the

326
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:25,965
Speaker 6:  way that Apple architected its store in the first place.

327
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:29,245
Speaker 4:  Right. But like the Android app store, the play store,

328
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:33,865
Speaker 4:  yes, there's some Android apps, like lots and lots of Android apps, but all

329
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:36,465
Speaker 4:  the new stuff, I mean we got complaints about this career. All the new apps

330
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:39,905
Speaker 4:  would start on iOS first. Yep. And it was because Apple had the wealthier

331
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,545
Speaker 4:  customer base that spent more money and they were really good at pushing

332
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:46,305
Speaker 4:  people to the app subscriptions. And so like Apple,

333
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:51,405
Speaker 4:  I don't think that's diminished right now. Like

334
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:55,285
Speaker 4:  if people want to use chat GBT, they're primarily doing it through an app

335
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:59,125
Speaker 4:  on Apple's App store on their platforms. And if you wanna subscribe,

336
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:01,765
Speaker 4:  the easiest way to do It is to push the button in the app and Apple gets

337
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:05,625
Speaker 4:  its money. And that might be at risk, but we'll like

338
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:09,505
Speaker 4:  see what happens. Like Apple has ways to compete there that are within

339
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,145
Speaker 4:  its controls. I think the big risk Apple is all the stuff that's out of its

340
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:16,385
Speaker 4:  control, can they solve the regulatory problems around the world

341
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:21,665
Speaker 4:  In Texas, they just passed an age verification law that says the

342
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:25,145
Speaker 4:  smartphone makers have to verify the age of their users and keep kids out

343
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:27,385
Speaker 4:  of certain apps like that are educated, which

344
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,145
Speaker 6:  Reportedly Tim Cook personally tried to quash.

345
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:33,625
Speaker 4:  Yep. And, and they have been like all over this in every state around the

346
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,585
Speaker 4:  country. Like ev the top lobbyists in every state in every

347
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:41,385
Speaker 4:  like state capital a Apple has bought them all to try to crush these bills

348
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:42,785
Speaker 4:  and they, they just lost one in Texas.

349
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:48,225
Speaker 4:  That's, you know, is is that a flicker of diminishing? I, I don't know, but

350
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:51,345
Speaker 4:  it's out of their control right now. They just have to do it.

351
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:56,915
Speaker 4:  The big one is whether or not AI is

352
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:00,155
Speaker 4:  a new user interface that creates a new generation of hardware that

353
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:04,375
Speaker 4:  ends the smartphone application distribution monopoly. Like

354
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:07,575
Speaker 4:  that's the thing, that's the thing everyone's like staring at saying that's

355
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:11,135
Speaker 4:  the weakness. And for years Apple's strength has been like, well we have

356
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:13,335
Speaker 4:  the iPhone, we'll just like add these features. Yeah, we'll just Sherlock

357
00:22:13,335 --> 00:22:17,135
Speaker 4:  the hell out of OpenAI and then it they'll die. Like

358
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,935
Speaker 4:  that's what they do and they haven't seemed to be able to do it. Right. They

359
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:23,895
Speaker 4:  announced Apple Intelligence and it went away and it's delayed. I it from

360
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:27,295
Speaker 4:  every indication we have if they talk about it at

361
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:31,015
Speaker 4:  WWC will not be the point. Right? Right. We should not expect the big sir

362
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:34,495
Speaker 4:  at WWC or whatever. So they've, they've got some catching up to you there

363
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,735
Speaker 4:  and then it's can Apple disrupt the iPhone with the next

364
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:42,655
Speaker 4:  generation advice that has AI as a user interface if that is indeed the

365
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:46,255
Speaker 4:  user interface of the future. Right. I don't know the answers to these questions.

366
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:50,635
Speaker 4:  Like, and that's weird. I think, I think Apple has traditionally been like,

367
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,435
Speaker 4:  we'll just wait for Apple to do it and it'll be great. And you know, that's

368
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:55,955
Speaker 4:  been how it's playing out because Apple has announced every feature that

369
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:59,915
Speaker 4:  Android has had for years, years after Android announced it and gotten credit

370
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:03,355
Speaker 4:  for it. And I don't think they can do that this time. No, I

371
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:07,075
Speaker 6:  And that's, that's, yeah, I think I, I I agree with that and I think there's

372
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:11,035
Speaker 6:  also, apple has gotten away with so much over

373
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:14,795
Speaker 6:  the years because it makes the best stuff and appears

374
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:18,155
Speaker 6:  to be the company that cares the most about making the best stuff.

375
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:22,505
Speaker 6:  And that's, once you lose that, it's really hard to get it

376
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:25,785
Speaker 6:  back. And I think again, all of that is so tied up in like, what are they

377
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:29,225
Speaker 6:  gonna show us at WDC and is It, is it gonna look like

378
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,545
Speaker 6:  Apple is, you know, putting new coats of paint on old things while everybody

379
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,385
Speaker 6:  is lapping it, building the next

380
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:40,705
Speaker 6:  thing? Or is there a, like is Apple going to be able to make a

381
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:44,025
Speaker 6:  compelling case that actually no, this is still the thing and I think it's,

382
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:47,005
Speaker 6:  it's like no one thinks we're getting rid of smartphones, right? Like Johnny,

383
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:50,965
Speaker 6:  ive and Sam Altman made their weird video in San Francisco. Even they are

384
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:54,045
Speaker 6:  like, smartphones are going to continue to exist. But like,

385
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:59,225
Speaker 6:  is it, I we're on how many years now of the iPhone being

386
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:02,945
Speaker 6:  basically the exact same thing and everything else getting weirder and

387
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:06,625
Speaker 6:  stranger and like, I think you could make a pretty strong case that the device

388
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:10,145
Speaker 6:  at Apple that has gotten the most improvement over the last several years

389
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:14,265
Speaker 6:  is the MacBook, which is a weird state of affairs for Apple. So it's just,

390
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:18,185
Speaker 6:  we're at this moment of like, I think people are less impressed with Apple

391
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:22,185
Speaker 6:  in every facet than they have been in a long time. And if you

392
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:25,825
Speaker 6:  lose that suddenly all the other like kind of gross

393
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:29,465
Speaker 6:  shenanigans you used to get away with because you made great stuff becomes

394
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:30,465
Speaker 6:  a lot harder to get away with.

395
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:34,665
Speaker 4:  So speaking of new coats of paint, the leaks we've gotten so far, we

396
00:24:34,665 --> 00:24:37,105
Speaker 4:  don't know what's gonna happen. We don't know what's gonna happen. Well,

397
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:38,825
Speaker 6:  Apple's gonna announce some software apple's,

398
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:42,745
Speaker 4:  We know what happens at WDC broadly, right? Like they rev all their

399
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:45,785
Speaker 4:  operating systems every year at WWC to get developers ready for the next

400
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:49,145
Speaker 4:  turn. Sometimes they, you know, surprise announce a Mac Pro.

401
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:53,345
Speaker 4:  So we don't know, maybe they'll, they'll surprise all of us. We don't know

402
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:53,865
Speaker 4:  what's going to happen.

403
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:59,275
Speaker 4:  But my sense is that this will be very software focused and my sense

404
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:02,355
Speaker 4:  is that they're gonna announce a bunch of new coats of paint because we have

405
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:06,395
Speaker 4:  a bunch of leaks already. One of which is that Apple's

406
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:08,835
Speaker 4:  gonna rename all of its operating systems and that will be part of the big

407
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:09,075
Speaker 4:  news.

408
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:13,115
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So the, the sort of stack of announcements here is that

409
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:18,385
Speaker 6:  a Apple is going to rev basically every piece of

410
00:25:18,665 --> 00:25:22,225
Speaker 6:  software that it has in a meaningful way, which is not often the case

411
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:25,705
Speaker 6:  most of the time. There's sort of like, some get huge changes, some get medium

412
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:29,145
Speaker 6:  changes, and then they're just like, and TVOS exists and then they move on.

413
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,705
Speaker 6:  So, but this year there is, and we should say most of this reporting comes

414
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:37,225
Speaker 6:  from Mark Kerman at Bloomberg who is usually right about this stuff.

415
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:39,465
Speaker 6:  Not always, but usually.

416
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:44,745
Speaker 6:  And so yeah, the, the top line is basically huge

417
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:48,705
Speaker 6:  changes to every single surface of operating system

418
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:52,345
Speaker 6:  that Apple makes. Thing number two is the thing that all of those are gonna

419
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:55,745
Speaker 6:  have in common it appears, is that they're going to be

420
00:25:56,575 --> 00:26:00,265
Speaker 6:  changed to look a more like each other and B, more like the vision pro.

421
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:04,145
Speaker 6:  That there is this like layered sort of spacey

422
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:08,065
Speaker 6:  3D interface thing that Apple is going deep on.

423
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:12,825
Speaker 6:  I have feelings about that. But then thing number three is to do that, they're

424
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:16,745
Speaker 6:  going to rename all of them to have numbering

425
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:20,505
Speaker 6:  schemes that are the same. I was gonna say numbering schemes that make sense.

426
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:24,305
Speaker 6:  But they don't, they're just the same now and that's something

427
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:27,425
Speaker 4:  Well no, they, they, they're tied to years, right, like cars.

428
00:26:28,015 --> 00:26:28,305
Speaker 6:  Sure.

429
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:31,625
Speaker 4:  So this year they're gonna announce iOS 26 this

430
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,305
Speaker 6:  Year they're going Yeah, they're gonna announce, they're gonna announce presumably

431
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:38,145
Speaker 6:  the iPhone 17 this year right about as iOS 26 comes out.

432
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:41,465
Speaker 6:  And if you can explain to me how that makes sense, I really, really, really

433
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:42,305
Speaker 6:  look forward to hearing it.

434
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:43,725
Speaker 4:  Well,

435
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:49,525
Speaker 4:  all right, gimme a second because the, the OS is not tied to

436
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:49,885
Speaker 4:  the phone.

437
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:50,965
Speaker 6:  No it's not.

438
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:54,085
Speaker 4:  So you, you got the old phone running in the us that's what you want. And

439
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:57,885
Speaker 4:  it's this year's os you know it 'cause It is named after the, the year that's

440
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:58,205
Speaker 4:  to come.

441
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,725
Speaker 6:  What? I don't understand, but

442
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:02,765
Speaker 4:  That makes sense. Wait, wait, I got it. I got it.

443
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:03,205
Speaker 6:  Okay. Hit

444
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,645
Speaker 4:  Me. I'm ready. The wheels are turning over here. It's 'cause everyone gets

445
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:09,485
Speaker 4:  in the OS in like September and October, so you're already onto the next

446
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:09,685
Speaker 4:  year,

447
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:12,825
Speaker 6:  But September and October or this year.

448
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:16,825
Speaker 4:  But you don't wanna get iOS 25 in like September.

449
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:21,645
Speaker 4:  Right? Because they, it'll come out in like mid to late September. Usually

450
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:22,805
Speaker 4:  that's when the iPhone hits. So

451
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:26,725
Speaker 6:  Do you, do you actually, I've always wondered this, do you know the car logic

452
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:30,205
Speaker 6:  for this? Like is there a an official reason that cars do

453
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:31,885
Speaker 6:  next year model?

454
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:32,845
Speaker 4:  Oh it's just a straight arms race.

455
00:27:33,505 --> 00:27:34,035
Speaker 6:  What do you mean

456
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:38,075
Speaker 4:  It So they cars did not initially have model years associated

457
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:41,115
Speaker 4:  with them. This is like a big innovation in the fifties and sixties and then

458
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:44,235
Speaker 4:  it was an arms race. He wanted the newest model so they started releasing

459
00:27:44,235 --> 00:27:47,355
Speaker 4:  the newer models earlier in the year. Oh. And then everyone kind of like

460
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:51,675
Speaker 4:  standardized and then a bunch of stuff like the insurance industry

461
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:55,475
Speaker 4:  and car values got tied to Molly years and perceived age. So everyone kind

462
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:59,295
Speaker 4:  of landed in the same spot. But even right now there's an arms

463
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:03,025
Speaker 4:  race like the new the new Cadillac SUV the vista

464
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:07,305
Speaker 4:  is, it's out now. You can go buy one and It is a 2026.

465
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:08,875
Speaker 6:  That's so stupid.

466
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:12,235
Speaker 4:  And that usually doesn't happen. It usually happens around the fall where

467
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:13,235
Speaker 4:  they switch the model numbers over.

468
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:17,235
Speaker 6:  It's may it, it's closer to 2024 than 2026.

469
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:21,395
Speaker 4:  But that's what they're, but so their arms race persists. Yeah. But usually

470
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:25,075
Speaker 4:  cars, they rev the model years towards the end of the year.

471
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:29,555
Speaker 4:  'cause no one wants to buy last year's model in December. Right. So

472
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:32,435
Speaker 4:  you in January and you save a 2024, like nobody wants this. So like they've

473
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:35,795
Speaker 4:  landed in this sweet spot, but then every now and again a company like GM

474
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:38,475
Speaker 4:  will show up. You're like, screw it in 2026. And like that's, we're just

475
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:39,155
Speaker 4:  gonna have to deal with it.

476
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:42,955
Speaker 6:  And that is just like pure psychology. Like all that is is just a, a trick

477
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,315
Speaker 6:  to make you think it's the future when you're buying your car.

478
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:46,515
Speaker 4:  A hundred percent. And and

479
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:48,755
Speaker 6:  That's what we're doing here too. But, okay, here's what I don't understand.

480
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:52,675
Speaker 6:  So you, for forever, I don't know how long this lasted, but you

481
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:56,515
Speaker 6:  had a MacBook that ran Snow Leopard

482
00:28:56,975 --> 00:28:59,755
Speaker 6:  and you were very proud of the fact that it ran Snow Leopard and you

483
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:01,595
Speaker 4:  Were like it wasn't Snow leopard. It was, wasn't

484
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:01,835
Speaker 6:  It Snow

485
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:05,755
Speaker 4:  Leopard? No. Snow Leopard was 10.4. I ran Snow Leopard when

486
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:06,275
Speaker 4:  I was in college.

487
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:07,115
Speaker 6:  Oh okay.

488
00:29:07,575 --> 00:29:10,875
Speaker 4:  It was like El Capitan or something. It was like one of those. Okay. Mountain

489
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,235
Speaker 4:  Lion, that's what it was. Oh,

490
00:29:12,235 --> 00:29:15,795
Speaker 6:  Okay. Fair enough. But you were very proud of this one

491
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,635
Speaker 6:  particular version of, of OS 10, whatever it was. And what I

492
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:22,475
Speaker 6:  don't understand is Apple has continued this

493
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:27,435
Speaker 6:  sort of delightful sort of weed infused, according to Craig

494
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:30,835
Speaker 6:  Federici naming scheme for Mac Os where they just named the operating system

495
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:34,435
Speaker 6:  something. And what I don't understand is why they wouldn't just do that,

496
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:38,675
Speaker 6:  just name it all something that's a, it's a much more aply way to do

497
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:42,445
Speaker 6:  it. Like tvOS 26 doesn't mean

498
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:43,445
Speaker 6:  anything to anybody. But

499
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:45,325
Speaker 4:  I don't think TV os means anything to anyone.

500
00:29:46,195 --> 00:29:46,415
Speaker 6:  No,

501
00:29:46,675 --> 00:29:50,095
Speaker 4:  It doesn't os means nothing to anyone. So then the only one that mean anything

502
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:53,135
Speaker 4:  to anyone are are Mac Os in iOS. So then why name it anything

503
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:53,415
Speaker 6:  At all?

504
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,295
Speaker 4:  Because they need version numbers. I think all they're doing is they revving

505
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,535
Speaker 4:  immersion numbers. The fact that we are having this conversation, first of

506
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:02,375
Speaker 4:  all I'm confident is driving some people bananas because It is of no consequence

507
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,575
Speaker 4:  to anyone. And there's probably other tech you used to talk about, but It

508
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:07,785
Speaker 4:  is also the point. Yeah. Right? Like they don't,

509
00:30:08,895 --> 00:30:12,785
Speaker 4:  what they're not announcing is natural language Siri. Right.

510
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:16,065
Speaker 4:  What they're gonna announce is it looks different now, which always gets

511
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:19,945
Speaker 4:  a ton of attention and we've rubbed all these operating system numbers

512
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:23,995
Speaker 4:  and then It is certain that we will write

513
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:27,795
Speaker 4:  something about how the operating system numbers work. Well. But, and I will

514
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:30,595
Speaker 4:  just write like 10,000 words on why they should have stopped at Snow Leopard

515
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,715
Speaker 4:  and that was the greatest time the computers ever had in history.

516
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:36,515
Speaker 6:  That's what I was thinking of. You love Snow leopards. That's

517
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,075
Speaker 4:  Snow Leopard was the greatest operating system. You were

518
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:40,035
Speaker 6:  Running Mountain Lion, but you love Snow Leo. Yeah.

519
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:44,435
Speaker 4:  And that was my attempt to just like, stop it. It didn't work. I

520
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:45,715
Speaker 4:  got a new computer. But I

521
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:49,155
Speaker 6:  Do wonder like your your point that these are just version numbers. I think

522
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:52,475
Speaker 6:  I, I wonder if that's telling, like we were talking about this last week

523
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,355
Speaker 6:  with all the Android stuff that Google has sort of hit a point where

524
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,915
Speaker 6:  Android version numbers don't really matter. Not at all. It used to be sort

525
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:02,995
Speaker 6:  of an event release that the new version of Android would come out and it

526
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:04,995
Speaker 6:  would have a dessert name and it would've a bunch of new features and they

527
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:08,515
Speaker 6:  would do a whole thing about it. And now your phone just kind of periodically

528
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:12,475
Speaker 6:  updates and you don't think that much about it. And I wonder if this is Apple

529
00:31:13,245 --> 00:31:16,945
Speaker 6:  moving towards the same thing where actually this,

530
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:20,905
Speaker 6:  this annual rev of all the operating systems, which you could argue for a

531
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:24,425
Speaker 6:  long time has not made sense to, you know, hold features six months just

532
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,785
Speaker 6:  to put them in a release every May.

533
00:31:28,925 --> 00:31:32,755
Speaker 6:  Maybe maybe this is the end of that way of thinking that Apple is like,

534
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,595
Speaker 6:  okay, well actually expecting us to have a wholesale new

535
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:40,515
Speaker 6:  thing every year is not what we're after. And instead we just call it

536
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:42,875
Speaker 6:  the year it shipped and it's a version number and that's it.

537
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:47,115
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I again, I I think this is like of little consequence

538
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:50,995
Speaker 4:  outside of the one we get to like make some news.

539
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:54,755
Speaker 4:  We get to harmonize all the numbers across all the things. Yeah. But I,

540
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:59,315
Speaker 4:  what people want out of Apple right now is to be able to talk to Siri and

541
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:02,995
Speaker 4:  have Siri do things right. Like, and maybe you hate AI and you don't actually

542
00:32:02,995 --> 00:32:06,955
Speaker 4:  want this, but the broader ecosystem of like the

543
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:10,435
Speaker 4:  Market Watchers and regular people who are using chat

544
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,275
Speaker 4:  GPT every day are like, why isn't Siri It Chat

545
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:18,155
Speaker 4:  GPT Advanced Voice mode. Why, why haven't these things just connected together

546
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:21,555
Speaker 4:  in a real way? Like I don't wanna just use the action button. I think honestly

547
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:25,195
Speaker 4:  you could level the same criticism of Google. Like Google Assistant is not

548
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:29,195
Speaker 4:  Gemini. They're gonna get there on some timeline,

549
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:33,115
Speaker 4:  but it's still weird. That hasn't happened. It appears some people,

550
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:36,755
Speaker 4:  including our friend Parker or Alani have gotten Alexa plus

551
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:42,475
Speaker 4:  I, he's the only one I know. If you have it, let us know. We'd love to talk

552
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:45,875
Speaker 4:  to you about it. 'cause none of us have it yet. But I I think like these

553
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:49,835
Speaker 4:  assistant interfaces, that that's what a lot of people

554
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:53,715
Speaker 4:  believe the next turn to be. And Apple doesn't have a

555
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:57,035
Speaker 4:  move there. So version numbers are just like, that's what I mean by it's

556
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:57,755
Speaker 4:  a coat of paint.

557
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:01,155
Speaker 6:  Well, and in that world, if that is in fact the interface of the future

558
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,785
Speaker 6:  version numbers sort of cease to mean anything altogether. I mean I I think

559
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:09,625
Speaker 6:  back to like when, when Sam Altman said, and this is, I don't know, a

560
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:13,585
Speaker 6:  year ago now, that he was like, we, we set up the GPT

561
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:16,945
Speaker 6:  numbers all wrong. That now every time we release a new model, people expect

562
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:20,905
Speaker 6:  it to be like the leap from GPT three to GPD four and like blow their minds

563
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:22,745
Speaker 6:  and it's gonna be a whole new thing. And actually what It is, is all this

564
00:33:22,745 --> 00:33:26,065
Speaker 6:  stuff just sort of consistently incrementally gets better and

565
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:30,065
Speaker 6:  there's no point in having, so they just like made the numbers not make any

566
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:33,505
Speaker 6:  sense anymore. And like maybe if you're Apple

567
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:37,505
Speaker 6:  launching Siri two, Siri three and series four doesn't make any sense. No.

568
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:40,945
Speaker 6:  And so you're just, they're just gonna pull back on all of this

569
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:43,025
Speaker 4:  First they have to launch Siri. Well,

570
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:45,745
Speaker 6:  Yeah, but it, but I mean, it, it makes me wonder like if all of that comes

571
00:33:45,745 --> 00:33:49,625
Speaker 6:  true, is this one of the last WWDC that feels this

572
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:50,505
Speaker 6:  big? I

573
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:54,425
Speaker 4:  Don know, I think they will always have to rev the, you they

574
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:58,345
Speaker 4:  have so many devices in the world that I don't think they can do the

575
00:33:58,905 --> 00:34:02,875
Speaker 4:  constant phased approach. Right. I it's like, it would almost

576
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,795
Speaker 4:  be too taxing. Too many things would like kind of always be going wrong.

577
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:07,475
Speaker 4:  Right. Do you know what I mean?

578
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:10,395
Speaker 6:  Like drop all the bugs at once instead of like one a week all year.

579
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:14,755
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right. Like I, I think they can, they can be prepared for something

580
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:17,635
Speaker 4:  and like, I think that cadence is really important to them. I think it's

581
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:21,155
Speaker 4:  part of Apple's DNA to be like, we have a roadmap. We ship all the things

582
00:34:21,155 --> 00:34:24,195
Speaker 4:  on the roadmap, we move on to the next part of the roadmap. And they've gotten

583
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,555
Speaker 4:  better at some Delta updates. Like they announce a bunch of features of wwc

584
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:31,475
Speaker 4:  and then they like things come out months later almost till the next year.

585
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:34,595
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So they, they have started breaking things apart more, but I think

586
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:37,955
Speaker 4:  they're, they're organized around one big drop in one big announcement cycle.

587
00:34:38,455 --> 00:34:41,755
Speaker 4:  And importantly this is what developers are for, right? Like you need all

588
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:44,155
Speaker 4:  your developers to support your new features. So when the operating system

589
00:34:44,155 --> 00:34:47,515
Speaker 4:  arrives in September with new iPhone, the apps are ready for it. And that

590
00:34:47,575 --> 00:34:51,315
Speaker 4:  to me is the, like the other big weakness in Apple's

591
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:55,515
Speaker 4:  universe of weaknesses right now that the developers are mad at the company,

592
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:58,635
Speaker 4:  they're gonna put out a new design language. This has been the rumor. It

593
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:02,515
Speaker 4:  will look more like the Vision Pro interface, you know, sheets of

594
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:05,835
Speaker 4:  glass, I keep calling it Aero Glass, which is the name of the design language

595
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:06,755
Speaker 4:  and Windows Vista.

596
00:35:08,615 --> 00:35:10,875
Speaker 4:  But like that's what everybody wants. It's it's got a lot of those moves,

597
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,355
Speaker 4:  right? Like transparent glass and layers. And what's fascinating about this

598
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:18,725
Speaker 4:  is it that design language is not where the rest of the

599
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:22,095
Speaker 4:  industry is going right now. And Apple traditionally leads, right? They,

600
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,895
Speaker 4:  they take the Boulder steps, they push everyone forward. A lot of people

601
00:35:24,895 --> 00:35:28,735
Speaker 4:  just copy whatever Apple does. And I don't think that's happening right now.

602
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:33,615
Speaker 4:  No. I I I think there's a generation of designers who came up independently

603
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:36,655
Speaker 4:  of the iPhone. Like the iPhone was just the thing that existed and they have

604
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:40,205
Speaker 4:  their own ideas and you can kind of see it like, you know, the new

605
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:44,445
Speaker 4:  Airbnb icons are like 3D dimensional. Johnny I've

606
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:48,005
Speaker 4:  helped with that. You see it like opening eyes

607
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:52,045
Speaker 4:  design language is different than apple's. Google just did Material

608
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:53,885
Speaker 4:  U Extreme or whatever it's called. It's,

609
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:57,445
Speaker 6:  I think expressive was the word, but it was

610
00:35:57,445 --> 00:36:00,645
Speaker 4:  Basically extreme. There are a lot of ideas about software design in this

611
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:04,565
Speaker 4:  new universe and it's not a guarantee that Apple's ideas will win and it's

612
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:08,165
Speaker 4:  certainly not a guarantee that their developers will exert the effort to

613
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:09,965
Speaker 4:  redesign their apps to mash apple's design right now.

614
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:13,565
Speaker 6:  Right. Yeah. I mean, and in fact I think actually Airbnb is an interesting

615
00:36:13,565 --> 00:36:17,085
Speaker 6:  example. 'cause if you look at Airbnb's new design,

616
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:20,965
Speaker 6:  it's, it's not quite skew morphic, but it's very

617
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:24,365
Speaker 6:  physical, right? Yeah. Like, and and that's a huge trend in design right

618
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:28,125
Speaker 6:  now is is making everything feel sort of earthy and

619
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:32,285
Speaker 6:  tactile and like that's a lot of what is even happening in the new Android

620
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:36,365
Speaker 6:  stuff is it's designed to like move and bounce and morph and

621
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:40,045
Speaker 6:  it's like everything wants to sort of feel alive and three dimensional

622
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:44,115
Speaker 6:  and Apple is just like panes of glass and it's like,

623
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:47,395
Speaker 6:  I'm I'm sure it will be lovely. And there are a lot of really smart things

624
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:51,355
Speaker 6:  about the Vision Pro, right? Like the, the sort of big idea behind

625
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,795
Speaker 6:  a lot of the design is that it's, instead of being a bunch of different screens,

626
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:58,675
Speaker 6:  like a menu lives inside the button and when you tap the button, the menu

627
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,515
Speaker 6:  sort of appears out of it over top of what you're doing instead of launching

628
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:03,795
Speaker 6:  you into a whole new experience. There's a bunch of that that actually like,

629
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:06,835
Speaker 6:  makes sense in terms of like helping people know where they are on their

630
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:09,955
Speaker 6:  device. Sure. But It is a completely

631
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:14,675
Speaker 6:  different way of thinking about what your technology

632
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:18,555
Speaker 6:  means to you than this idea of like, we want the

633
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:22,275
Speaker 6:  physical world and the digital world to look and feel more like each other.

634
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,915
Speaker 6:  And as we're like, especially as everybody is doing augmented reality and

635
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:29,035
Speaker 6:  thinking about smart glasses, like, it, it makes a lot of sense to me to

636
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:32,635
Speaker 6:  start thinking about like, how do I make the digital world blend into the

637
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:35,355
Speaker 6:  physical world a little more? And Apple is like completely the other way.

638
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:37,515
Speaker 6:  They're like spaceships. It's all spaceships.

639
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:42,235
Speaker 4:  I, you know, I the Vision Pro, who knows Three, we're gonna talk about the

640
00:37:42,235 --> 00:37:45,595
Speaker 4:  Vision Pro also be very funny if they rev the Vision Pro

641
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:49,555
Speaker 4:  operating system to 26, like

642
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:50,675
Speaker 4:  two years in from

643
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:51,555
Speaker 6:  Two to 26.

644
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:57,515
Speaker 4:  Like, like Vision os 26. Like here we go. A lot

645
00:37:57,515 --> 00:38:01,235
Speaker 4:  of, and a lot of, a lot of spaces left on the, on the feature chart between

646
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:01,995
Speaker 4:  here and 26.

647
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:07,775
Speaker 4:  But you know, if you view the Vision Pro as a simulator and you're like,

648
00:38:07,775 --> 00:38:11,215
Speaker 4:  this is how we will overlay digital information on the real world Pans a

649
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:14,795
Speaker 4:  glass kinda makes sense. But like we're not, we're nowhere close to this.

650
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:18,995
Speaker 4:  Right. Like nowhere close. And I think it'd be, it's gonna be

651
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:23,075
Speaker 4:  interesting to see how that maps to like an iPad, which

652
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:26,755
Speaker 4:  is like not anywhere close to an augmented reality device, right? Like

653
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,075
Speaker 4:  it's like a big physical device you hold in your hand. Like It is the most

654
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:34,035
Speaker 4:  screen that can screen in your hand and like how is that

655
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:37,645
Speaker 4:  gonna play? So there's just like things here about Apple's design language

656
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:41,165
Speaker 4:  right now where I'm, I'm curious to see what the Rev looks like. I'm curious

657
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:44,765
Speaker 4:  to see how it plays with their other ambitions. But all of these other,

658
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:48,725
Speaker 4:  like the digital world is getting more physical. It is like, it's a, it's

659
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:51,845
Speaker 4:  an interesting trend. You kind of see everywhere. But it, it's a reflection

660
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:54,325
Speaker 4:  of the fact that that is still happening on screens.

661
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:56,275
Speaker 6:  Yes. And

662
00:38:56,855 --> 00:38:59,835
Speaker 4:  The Apple's new design language at least is expressed on the Vision Pro is

663
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:03,795
Speaker 4:  like very much like it's happening in reality and we're not there

664
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:03,995
Speaker 4:  yet.

665
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:08,075
Speaker 6:  Sort of, but it's kind of like, it's like what if there was an iPad floating

666
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:11,835
Speaker 6:  in the air? Not what if this thing were in the world. Like I kind of,

667
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:15,435
Speaker 6:  I think Apple has pushed like halfway down that road,

668
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,535
Speaker 6:  not all the way down that road. And then again, there's to your point there

669
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:21,895
Speaker 6:  is the question of like, is that what I want when I'm aware that I'm looking

670
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:25,655
Speaker 6:  at a screen, right? Like, is that, does that construct make any sense

671
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,815
Speaker 6:  on the screen that I'm holding in my hand? Yeah.

672
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,575
Speaker 4:  You know what's gonna happen? Is there gonna play a video of like a a button

673
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:35,855
Speaker 4:  and Craig Feder is like this button and everyone, the crowd's gonna go wild.

674
00:39:36,195 --> 00:39:36,415
Speaker 6:  Yes.

675
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,815
Speaker 4:  And the developers gonna make the button anyway. That's wwc. Like the leaks

676
00:39:39,815 --> 00:39:42,935
Speaker 4:  are coming. I think what Dave and I are both pointing out, It is like Apple

677
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:46,775
Speaker 4:  has stakes here in a way. They have not really needed to address the stakes

678
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:50,415
Speaker 4:  in a long time. Yes. And I don't think they can just paper over it and like

679
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:54,455
Speaker 4:  muscle through it and be like, we're Apple. Like take it or leave it. I think

680
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:58,175
Speaker 4:  a lot of people are aware that there is another

681
00:39:58,525 --> 00:40:02,455
Speaker 4:  kind of application model being developed and

682
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:05,895
Speaker 4:  you might hate it. I know we have listeners who hate ai, but I'm

683
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:10,175
Speaker 4:  watching people every day build new applications

684
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:14,175
Speaker 4:  using tools like NAN and Cursor. We get the

685
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:17,575
Speaker 4:  pitches, we see the investment, there's something

686
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:21,375
Speaker 4:  meaningful happening there and I, you

687
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,815
Speaker 4:  can't just ignore it. So if Apple participates in that,

688
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:28,215
Speaker 4:  that's one thing. If they don't, I think there's gonna be a lot of pressure

689
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:31,655
Speaker 4:  on the company to have an answer as to why. And right now the answer is 'cause

690
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:33,975
Speaker 4:  we were late. And I I don't think that's great for that.

691
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:37,975
Speaker 6:  Right. Well and I think it, It is, it's Apple's move always

692
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:42,055
Speaker 6:  to pretend that nothing else exists and just

693
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:46,255
Speaker 6:  like live in its own universe where it doesn't acknowledge other companies

694
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:49,935
Speaker 6:  or other products or other ideas. And I think this time rather than

695
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:53,855
Speaker 6:  projecting strength, that's gonna look like weakness. We'll see because there

696
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:56,935
Speaker 6:  is this perception that Apple is way behind and it's either going to have

697
00:40:56,935 --> 00:41:00,455
Speaker 6:  to acknowledge it or it's gonna look like it's just

698
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:01,895
Speaker 6:  got its head up. Its ass.

699
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:06,015
Speaker 4:  I'm dying to know. I honestly I too, it's gonna, we there's another week

700
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:09,455
Speaker 4:  of weeks to come. We'll find out. But that fe it feels like this.

701
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:13,215
Speaker 4:  That's the frame we're in. 'cause it, they're the last of the developer conferences

702
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:16,775
Speaker 4:  and we kind of know what everyone else's moves are gonna be. Alright, we

703
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,895
Speaker 4:  should take a break. We'll come back. I want to, I wanna actually pick up

704
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:22,655
Speaker 4:  the thread from Google and it's confidence when we come back. 'cause it,

705
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:24,855
Speaker 4:  it's a really interesting contrast. We'll be right back.

706
00:44:36,085 --> 00:44:36,565
Speaker 6:  decoder?

707
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:40,365
Speaker 4:  It's true. That's all I've tried and I know this has

708
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:43,845
Speaker 4:  disappointed a lot of people over the years. I have done my best and I have

709
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:47,765
Speaker 4:  consistently failed to arrest the CEOs of major tech

710
00:44:48,005 --> 00:44:49,365
Speaker 4:  companies When they appear on decoder

711
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:55,265
Speaker 4:  I, there there's some segment of people that is visibly

712
00:44:55,545 --> 00:44:59,465
Speaker 4:  frustrated with me when every decoder interview does not end with an

713
00:44:59,465 --> 00:45:03,375
Speaker 4:  arrest in jail time. I'm doing my best. I have

714
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,695
Speaker 4:  said you're under arrest at the end of many decoders.

715
00:45:06,095 --> 00:45:09,975
Speaker 6:  I do like the idea that every episode ends with like an animation of just

716
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:11,575
Speaker 6:  bars coming down in front of their face,

717
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:16,415
Speaker 4:  Decoder jail. Yeah, you're right. Some people have come close,

718
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:20,655
Speaker 4:  some CEOs have certainly self emulated on that show. That's true in

719
00:45:20,655 --> 00:45:24,015
Speaker 4:  spectacular ways. And I'm saying this because I I've interviewed Sundar a

720
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:27,975
Speaker 4:  lot. He is very calm, he's very

721
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:31,735
Speaker 4:  practiced. He's he is excellent at answering exactly the question he wants

722
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:35,495
Speaker 4:  to answer exactly when he wants to answer it and not answering the question

723
00:45:35,495 --> 00:45:38,575
Speaker 4:  if he doesn't want to. Yes. And so decoder for me is always a dance, it's

724
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:42,375
Speaker 4:  always a race against the clock. And there's just a part of it where I know

725
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:46,175
Speaker 4:  I've hit the wall like it's just not gonna happen. And it's time to

726
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:48,975
Speaker 4:  try a new wall. Like let's see if I can get through a different wall. And

727
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:52,215
Speaker 4:  in particular in conversations with sdo, I think you can see me do that faster

728
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:56,145
Speaker 4:  than ever just 'cause I know him and I, I know when I'm wa I'm just

729
00:45:56,145 --> 00:45:59,745
Speaker 4:  wasting time and I need to find a way to make that clearer. I, I think there's,

730
00:46:00,345 --> 00:46:04,005
Speaker 4:  I don't think it comes through that the way I experience an

731
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:07,945
Speaker 4:  interview like that is as a clock. Like I'm just running outta

732
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:10,865
Speaker 4:  time, right. Like from the second the conversation starts, the thing that's

733
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:12,385
Speaker 4:  happening in my head is that I'm running out of time.

734
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:17,105
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's a tricky balance. The balance between this is the question I

735
00:46:17,105 --> 00:46:20,585
Speaker 6:  want you to answer and so I'm going to keep asking it versus at some point

736
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:24,545
Speaker 6:  we have to make the rest of this podcast is a, is a, it's a hard balance

737
00:46:24,605 --> 00:46:25,025
Speaker 6:  to strike.

738
00:46:25,335 --> 00:46:28,065
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And there was, there's always a lot of stuff to talk about. And so

739
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:32,025
Speaker 4:  like Sure. But I think the thing that people are really reacting to in that,

740
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:35,785
Speaker 4:  and I felt it, I feel it this week and there's a reason I wanna talk about

741
00:46:35,785 --> 00:46:39,665
Speaker 4:  this, is I asked Sundar, as I've asked for many years

742
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:43,465
Speaker 4:  about Google's relationship to the web and he

743
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:46,665
Speaker 4:  keeps saying this thing, he said it now for many years that Google is sending

744
00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:49,265
Speaker 4:  more traffic out to the web than ever. That they're committed to the web,

745
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,105
Speaker 4:  they want the web to be healthy, they're the only company that cares about

746
00:46:52,105 --> 00:46:56,025
Speaker 4:  the web. He, you know, he always brings up competitors like, you know, Instagram

747
00:46:56,025 --> 00:46:59,345
Speaker 4:  doesn't allow links and captions. Like I think this still bothers him that

748
00:46:59,445 --> 00:47:03,225
Speaker 4:  Google gets all of this pressure to make sure the web ecosystem is,

749
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:07,825
Speaker 4:  is thriving. And you know, many other platforms send no links out at all.

750
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:12,185
Speaker 4:  Okay, well Google runs Chrome. Google runs search. Like that is their ecosystem,

751
00:47:12,185 --> 00:47:14,945
Speaker 4:  their creator base, if you wanna think about that way is the web. And the

752
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:18,145
Speaker 4:  same way that Instagram creators or TikTok creators are always mad at Instagram

753
00:47:18,145 --> 00:47:20,825
Speaker 4:  or TikTok or YouTube creators always mad at YouTube.

754
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:26,145
Speaker 4:  Website owners are always mad at Google. Like that's just the nature of the

755
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:29,925
Speaker 4:  relationship. But the economics are different because it's an open

756
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:33,525
Speaker 4:  ecosystem, not a closed one. Right? So TikTok creators are mad at TikTok.

757
00:47:33,915 --> 00:47:37,725
Speaker 4:  There's a natural connection there. Like TikTok

758
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:41,645
Speaker 4:  can just make changes and change the lives of TikTok creators. There's an

759
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:45,525
Speaker 4:  out for Google, which is like, I don't know, do some other stuff. Like why

760
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:49,365
Speaker 4:  are you so addicted to Google search? Right? So you hear Sendar

761
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:52,765
Speaker 4:  say we're sending more traffic out to the web and then

762
00:47:53,425 --> 00:47:57,165
Speaker 4:  within minutes a site like Business Insider announces

763
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,485
Speaker 4:  layoffs of 21% of its staff. They announce it just before we went on air.

764
00:48:00,865 --> 00:48:04,405
Speaker 4:  And the memo says, we need to get outta businesses that have traffic

765
00:48:04,405 --> 00:48:08,125
Speaker 4:  dependencies. We cannot control that. We need to, we need to avoid these

766
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:10,965
Speaker 4:  steep traffic drops we're seeing and what they are talking about is search

767
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:14,305
Speaker 4:  traffic, right? They're getting out of the commerce business where you know

768
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:17,865
Speaker 4:  that you list the 10 best mattresses and collect affiliate revenue for clicks

769
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:21,585
Speaker 4:  because that style of running a commerce business is search

770
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:25,665
Speaker 4:  arbitrage, right? People search for best mattress, they land on the

771
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:29,185
Speaker 4:  business insider page, they buy a mattress, and business insider gets some

772
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:33,025
Speaker 4:  pennies. And if you can wor warm your way

773
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:35,785
Speaker 4:  up the rankings, you can make more pennies and then you can make pennies

774
00:48:35,785 --> 00:48:39,345
Speaker 4:  at scale. And now you've made money. And we know lots of competitors

775
00:48:39,815 --> 00:48:42,945
Speaker 4:  that basically just do search arbitrage in this way. And the bottom has fallen

776
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,025
Speaker 4:  out of all of those businesses. I

777
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:48,345
Speaker 6:  Mean, we do some search arbitrage, like we, we can just call that what It

778
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:51,105
Speaker 6:  is. Everybody does some search arbitrage. It's part of being a business on

779
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:52,785
Speaker 6:  the internet that is part of the job. Yeah.

780
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:56,505
Speaker 4:  But we don't do it as ruthlessly as like the slop No buying guys

781
00:48:56,655 --> 00:48:57,025
Speaker 4:  much to

782
00:48:57,025 --> 00:48:59,265
Speaker 6:  The screen of some of the people at Vox Media. It's true. We,

783
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:02,385
Speaker 4:  There are people who'd love for us to do ruthlessly also. We run like a formal

784
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:05,865
Speaker 4:  reviews program. Like yeah, we do. It is true. We make some pages for search

785
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:09,065
Speaker 4:  and we see the demand and we, we try to get that audience. But if you're

786
00:49:09,915 --> 00:49:13,485
Speaker 4:  running one of those verticals that is purely search

787
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:17,005
Speaker 4:  arbitrage, right? The content farms that do it, their businesses are going

788
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:20,045
Speaker 4:  away. And some of those content farms are attached to things like Business

789
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:23,925
Speaker 4:  Insider, which does real journalism, right? And like you see

790
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:27,375
Speaker 4:  the bottom falling out there. And I, there's a real

791
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:31,215
Speaker 4:  disconnect and I, I think I felt it on this interview more than ever, where

792
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:33,455
Speaker 4:  you're saying we're, we're committed to the web, we're gonna keep building

793
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:37,055
Speaker 4:  on the web, we're gonna keep sending traffic out on the web, and then all

794
00:49:37,055 --> 00:49:41,025
Speaker 4:  of the people building on the web are like, we're dying. And I, I

795
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:44,585
Speaker 4:  don't think that disconnect is getting smaller. I think It is getting bigger

796
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:48,505
Speaker 4:  and bigger and bigger by the day. And it, it, you know,

797
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:50,865
Speaker 4:  I'm not gonna like go all the way out there and say like, the web is dying.

798
00:49:50,865 --> 00:49:54,505
Speaker 4:  Like I think the web is a place where apps are developed the best it's ever

799
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:58,185
Speaker 4:  been every single day. There's like a hot new web

800
00:49:58,285 --> 00:50:01,665
Speaker 4:  app basically that is doing something that couldn't be done before,

801
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:06,225
Speaker 4:  or an app like Figma is getting capabilities that never had

802
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:09,905
Speaker 4:  before. That's an incredible story of application development. Yeah. Like

803
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:14,105
Speaker 4:  I keep saying this, like It is a giant interlinked, interconnected,

804
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:17,625
Speaker 4:  worldwide application platform. The web is a miracle.

805
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,495
Speaker 4:  Like it's just, you would never be able to predict that it, something like

806
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:25,175
Speaker 4:  that could exist. And it does it's scale and everyone just sort of

807
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:29,405
Speaker 4:  like takes it for granted as a media platform. It it's dying and

808
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:32,765
Speaker 4:  it's one of the reasons it's dying is 'cause there's no way to get move traffic

809
00:50:32,765 --> 00:50:36,445
Speaker 4:  around it and Google is the last way to move it. And they,

810
00:50:36,725 --> 00:50:40,285
Speaker 4:  I would just say, I don't think they care. Like I, I really have come to

811
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:44,245
Speaker 4:  the conclusion that they know this is happening. They can see, obviously

812
00:50:44,265 --> 00:50:48,165
Speaker 4:  see it happening and they've just, they, it's just,

813
00:50:48,165 --> 00:50:51,125
Speaker 4:  they're over it. Like I don't think they want the pressure. I don't think

814
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:54,645
Speaker 4:  they care. There's also a bunch of lawsuits we should talk about, but we're

815
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:58,445
Speaker 4:  just in a place where I, I think the web

816
00:50:58,445 --> 00:51:02,245
Speaker 4:  we knew is coming to a close in another web

817
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:05,405
Speaker 4:  that's primarily application based or platform based or whatever It is, is

818
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:09,365
Speaker 4:  is on the rise. And it might be masking the fact that an old web

819
00:51:09,425 --> 00:51:10,845
Speaker 4:  is is is maybe over.

820
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:15,125
Speaker 6:  I think that's true. I mean, and I think I, I put this next to the work

821
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:18,685
Speaker 6:  Google has been doing on its ranking stuff over the last couple of years,

822
00:51:18,915 --> 00:51:22,885
Speaker 6:  including a couple of pretty big ranking changes that like all at

823
00:51:22,885 --> 00:51:25,685
Speaker 6:  once tanked a bunch of publishers. And this is the thing we've covered a

824
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:29,485
Speaker 6:  lot. The, the, the, you know, small like home

825
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:32,965
Speaker 6:  goods review site that got absolutely destroyed by

826
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,605
Speaker 6:  some sort of unknowable change in the algorithm that just down ranked a bunch

827
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:40,485
Speaker 6:  of new stuff. And Google's line and I, I, at a

828
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:43,685
Speaker 6:  very top level, I believe them that, that this is the goal

829
00:51:44,305 --> 00:51:48,125
Speaker 6:  is the goal is to stop sending traffic to bad websites, right? And so

830
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:52,045
Speaker 6:  like Google is actively trying to kill bad websites. Like let's

831
00:51:52,045 --> 00:51:55,205
Speaker 6:  let's not be unclear about that, right? Like all the stuff you're describing,

832
00:51:55,205 --> 00:51:59,085
Speaker 6:  all the content farming stuff, Google not only doesn't care if

833
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:02,565
Speaker 6:  that goes away, it would like that to go away because again, like

834
00:52:03,105 --> 00:52:06,565
Speaker 6:  Google understands as well as anybody that if if all of that stuff gets worse

835
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:10,405
Speaker 6:  on the web, Google search becomes less useful and it

836
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:13,885
Speaker 6:  all just like falls apart, right? And this is, this is a thing we've seen

837
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:17,805
Speaker 6:  happen. Search results get worse because websites are getting worse because

838
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:20,845
Speaker 6:  they're trying to game Google and it's this like horrible death spiral of

839
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:24,765
Speaker 6:  search arbitrage. Google is very happy to kill all of that stuff. Like

840
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:27,925
Speaker 6:  I think all of the things where there's no more money in mattress reviews

841
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:30,805
Speaker 6:  because they don't rank on Google anymore. I I think inside of Google, they

842
00:52:30,805 --> 00:52:34,635
Speaker 6:  are going to call that a resounding success feel about that however

843
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:38,355
Speaker 6:  you want. But I I, I don't think Google's stance on that is at all unclear.

844
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:42,715
Speaker 6:  I think to me the question is like Google is in an

845
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:46,555
Speaker 6:  unusually active position right now of trying to

846
00:52:46,555 --> 00:52:50,035
Speaker 6:  decide what a good and bad webpage is. And Google has always,

847
00:52:50,215 --> 00:52:53,275
Speaker 6:  always, always, always, always gone way out of its way to say that it doesn't

848
00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:56,835
Speaker 6:  do that. And to say that actually we, we are not remotely

849
00:52:56,835 --> 00:52:59,675
Speaker 6:  interested in trying to decide what's good and bad on the internet. We're

850
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:02,955
Speaker 6:  just, we're just sending traffic to where people want to go. And then there

851
00:53:02,955 --> 00:53:06,555
Speaker 6:  was this big SEO leak a year ago that made very clear that Google puts its

852
00:53:06,555 --> 00:53:09,315
Speaker 6:  thumbs on the scale in like innumerable ways to decide what it likes and

853
00:53:09,315 --> 00:53:11,635
Speaker 6:  what it doesn't. And now increasingly it's like, okay,

854
00:53:13,135 --> 00:53:16,955
Speaker 6:  in order to take all the shitty stuff that has been created

855
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:20,035
Speaker 6:  on the web to game the way the system worked, we're gonna build a new system

856
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:23,715
Speaker 6:  because it's better than that old system. And if all that stuff dies that

857
00:53:23,715 --> 00:53:26,885
Speaker 6:  was trying to game our old system, so be it. And then the question is, and

858
00:53:26,905 --> 00:53:30,445
Speaker 6:  no one will answer this, including Sundar, is what happens when you also

859
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:34,285
Speaker 6:  kill the good websites? They won't, they won't say that. They will not answer

860
00:53:34,285 --> 00:53:38,205
Speaker 6:  that question. And there is this like big structural belief, and

861
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:41,805
Speaker 6:  I think it was de that said this, that like we're gonna

862
00:53:41,805 --> 00:53:45,525
Speaker 6:  eventually have a, a web that is mostly for AI agents and

863
00:53:45,665 --> 00:53:49,245
Speaker 6:  may not even need like a front end for people to look at at all most of the

864
00:53:49,245 --> 00:53:53,005
Speaker 6:  time. But what about the good websites? It's like, it's just a question they

865
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:56,365
Speaker 6:  won't answer. And, and we're in such a like baby being thrown out with the

866
00:53:56,365 --> 00:54:00,325
Speaker 6:  bath water situation where like in a sort of ruthless way, like sure,

867
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:03,285
Speaker 6:  let all the bad websites die, let 'em all die, whatever.

868
00:54:04,515 --> 00:54:07,745
Speaker 6:  There are a lot of good websites out there that will die as you kill the

869
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,745
Speaker 6:  bad websites in order to make it easier for people to find what mattress

870
00:54:10,745 --> 00:54:14,505
Speaker 6:  to buy. And like Google at least publicly will not reckon with

871
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:14,745
Speaker 6:  that.

872
00:54:15,245 --> 00:54:18,865
Speaker 4:  So I think one of the ways they are reckoning with It is by saying,

873
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:24,245
Speaker 4:  well the audience doesn't want this. And I, I don't know how to contend with

874
00:54:24,245 --> 00:54:27,965
Speaker 4:  that, right? Their, their point is like, people are getting media from

875
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:31,405
Speaker 4:  YouTube and TikTok and whatever else and like

876
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:34,525
Speaker 4:  podcasts and that's all fine and that's like where the audience is going.

877
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:38,485
Speaker 4:  And like, if you wanna run a website, great. Get

878
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:41,845
Speaker 4:  your own audience. Like don't be relying on Google search to get your audience.

879
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:46,325
Speaker 4:  And I, I mean if anyone has listened to for like the past five years, you

880
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:50,085
Speaker 4:  know that I, I believe this in my bones, like the the deepest level that

881
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:53,845
Speaker 4:  being addicted to Google is like bad for the media industry, but

882
00:54:53,845 --> 00:54:57,005
Speaker 4:  it's, the media industry is addicted to Google and there's no like transition

883
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,325
Speaker 4:  plan. It's like, oh, you're, we're just gonna kill you. Yeah. And they're

884
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:03,125
Speaker 4:  fine with it. And I don't think the

885
00:55:04,165 --> 00:55:06,645
Speaker 4:  audience understands what's happening to the information environment that

886
00:55:06,645 --> 00:55:10,445
Speaker 4:  they're in. Like I, that, that to me is like the hardest part of this. That

887
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:14,645
Speaker 4:  suddenly Google is full of summaries of things that might be garbage or

888
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:18,685
Speaker 4:  the AI itself is hallucinating or the good sources of

889
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:22,405
Speaker 4:  information are now at war with Google and you're not even getting them

890
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:26,365
Speaker 4:  'cause they're in a fight. So another piece of this is all just

891
00:55:26,485 --> 00:55:29,885
Speaker 4:  a swirl of what is gonna happen to the web, The New York Times

892
00:55:30,215 --> 00:55:34,085
Speaker 4:  today, this morning before we started recording announced they

893
00:55:34,145 --> 00:55:38,135
Speaker 4:  are, they've inked a generative AI deal with Amazon and it broadly

894
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:41,815
Speaker 4:  tracks the deals that like everyone has made with open ai, Vox Media has

895
00:55:41,815 --> 00:55:45,335
Speaker 4:  a deal with, with open ad. It's like this that Amazon's gonna train on New York

896
00:55:45,335 --> 00:55:48,695
Speaker 4:  Times content, New York Times stuff will appear at Alexa and other Amazon

897
00:55:48,935 --> 00:55:52,695
Speaker 4:  services. It's a licensing deal. Yeah. And a lot of media companies are setting

898
00:55:53,545 --> 00:55:57,095
Speaker 4:  these deals 'cause they wanna set a market for what the license looks like.

899
00:55:57,555 --> 00:56:01,055
Speaker 4:  So again, disclosure, Vox Media is one of the deals with OpenAI. I have no

900
00:56:01,055 --> 00:56:04,815
Speaker 4:  idea what the terms are, but you know, Nick Thompson, the CEO of the Atlantic

901
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:08,575
Speaker 4:  was on here, was on the coder. And he was like, we need to set a market,

902
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:11,655
Speaker 4:  like some payments need to be made. So there are some numbers

903
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,255
Speaker 4:  for the inevitable court cases to come to some conclusion about.

904
00:56:15,475 --> 00:56:18,895
Speaker 6:  And Amazon is a very useful rich company to sign one of those deals with

905
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:19,535
Speaker 6:  in that case,

906
00:56:19,535 --> 00:56:22,935
Speaker 4:  Right? So The New York Times can't sign a deal with Open 'cause they're suing

907
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:26,885
Speaker 4:  them in Microsoft for copyright infringement. It's in a fight

908
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:30,765
Speaker 4:  with Google that times executives are on the board of the

909
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:33,485
Speaker 4:  News Media Alliance disclosure. Our executives are on the board of the News

910
00:56:33,485 --> 00:56:36,485
Speaker 4:  Media Alliance. They're furious with Google about all the changes to search

911
00:56:36,485 --> 00:56:40,445
Speaker 4:  and these traffic drops. They're, you know, a part of the publisher, ad tech

912
00:56:40,445 --> 00:56:44,245
Speaker 4:  lawsuits, all that stuff. So they're in a fight with Google. So who's left,

913
00:56:44,825 --> 00:56:48,365
Speaker 4:  who has big pockets that can set you a rate for a fight? It's Amazon, right?

914
00:56:48,495 --> 00:56:51,765
Speaker 6:  Which also by the way, would like very much to make it more expensive for

915
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:53,325
Speaker 6:  all the other companies to do this job too.

916
00:56:53,555 --> 00:56:57,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Amazon wins. If they just set enormous rates for Google and open

917
00:56:57,425 --> 00:57:01,325
Speaker 4:  ai, yeah, it's fine. But like, oh, this is a weird 'cause Amazon

918
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:05,245
Speaker 4:  doesn't give a shit at the web. They want Alexa to summarize times articles

919
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:08,365
Speaker 4:  for you every morning proactively or like whatever they think Alexa's gonna

920
00:57:08,365 --> 00:57:11,325
Speaker 4:  do. They're not out here like, what's their browser called

921
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,845
Speaker 4:  on fire devices? Silk. They're not whatever. Like,

922
00:57:16,465 --> 00:57:18,565
Speaker 4:  you know what I mean? Like their thing is like they need the training data

923
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:21,245
Speaker 4:  for their AI systems. They need to distribute it to their customers in new

924
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:25,045
Speaker 4:  and interesting ways because they're not gonna win as a web browser company.

925
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:27,885
Speaker 4:  Right. Which brings me to like the last little piece of the puzzle, which

926
00:57:27,885 --> 00:57:31,805
Speaker 4:  is the browser company, which David, you have talked about

927
00:57:31,805 --> 00:57:35,485
Speaker 4:  and profiled and covered at length. They stopped making their

928
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,595
Speaker 4:  browser, like they stopped making arc

929
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:41,675
Speaker 4:  because it's, there's no win there for them,

930
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:45,755
Speaker 6:  Right? They're in the middle of trying to figure out what the next bet is.

931
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:49,585
Speaker 6:  They have this new browser called dia, which is very much like so

932
00:57:49,585 --> 00:57:52,745
Speaker 6:  far I got into the beta. I was not supposed to get into the beta, but I got

933
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:56,385
Speaker 6:  out into the beta and like, holy God, is it just chrome with a chatbot?

934
00:57:57,605 --> 00:58:01,025
Speaker 6:  And the thing that's happening is, do you know what's also becoming Chrome

935
00:58:01,025 --> 00:58:04,825
Speaker 6:  with a chatbot is Chrome and also every other browser that

936
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:08,625
Speaker 6:  exists. And So I think like for, for the browser

937
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:11,985
Speaker 6:  company, the big bet was like, okay, I if, if we can mix

938
00:58:12,845 --> 00:58:16,785
Speaker 6:  AI with browsing data with like a, a device that you spend a lot

939
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:20,505
Speaker 6:  of time on, that can be very powerful. Agreed, great call browser company.

940
00:58:20,505 --> 00:58:24,345
Speaker 6:  It turns out everybody else had that idea too. And this is just what's coming.

941
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:28,345
Speaker 6:  And then the flip side is like that stuff is being, that stuff

942
00:58:28,345 --> 00:58:32,145
Speaker 6:  is being eaten up by the chat GPT app and the Claude app and

943
00:58:32,365 --> 00:58:36,225
Speaker 6:  people using Siri badly and Gemini and

944
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:40,505
Speaker 6:  all this stuff. And so there is this like, again, it's, it's just what,

945
00:58:40,535 --> 00:58:44,305
Speaker 6:  what is a webpage for anymore? And if, if I'm not

946
00:58:44,365 --> 00:58:48,065
Speaker 6:  in the business of showing you webpages, what am I building?

947
00:58:48,935 --> 00:58:52,875
Speaker 6:  And I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. And I think it's certainly

948
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:56,675
Speaker 6:  true that you can build a cool browser that a bunch of power users

949
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:59,875
Speaker 6:  like me will like, I like Arc a lot. I use it all day every day.

950
00:59:01,185 --> 00:59:04,635
Speaker 6:  That doesn't appear to be the next thing. But no one knows quite what that

951
00:59:04,635 --> 00:59:07,955
Speaker 6:  thing is yet because it's, it, it might not be showing you webpages.

952
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:11,755
Speaker 4:  I don't think It is that de comment at IO

953
00:59:12,285 --> 00:59:15,995
Speaker 4:  about what kind of web do you build for agents first? It's the whole game.

954
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:17,535
Speaker 4:  It's the whole game.

955
00:59:18,005 --> 00:59:18,295
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

956
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:22,245
Speaker 4:  So whatever you think Google search did to, to Google the web as a media

957
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:26,525
Speaker 4:  platform and it did a lot of things. It first it created

958
00:59:26,705 --> 00:59:30,325
Speaker 4:  an entire economy for the web as a media platform, right? People search for

959
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:34,005
Speaker 4:  things. They went to webpages just like revolutionized the internet. Like

960
00:59:34,005 --> 00:59:37,085
Speaker 4:  it created the internet as we know it in like meaningful ways. Yeah.

961
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:42,055
Speaker 4:  Then it created SEO, which was less good then it created

962
00:59:42,055 --> 00:59:45,895
Speaker 4:  the SEO industry and SEO slop and all this stuff. And it made

963
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:49,775
Speaker 4:  a whole ecosystem that worked and didn't work in whatever ways it worked.

964
00:59:50,115 --> 00:59:53,975
Speaker 4:  And then even before AI showed up, Google started displaying

965
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:57,785
Speaker 4:  more and more of the content natively, right? What time is the Super Bowl

966
00:59:57,785 --> 01:00:00,585
Speaker 4:  went from being a thing that people fought for to a thing that Google would

967
01:00:00,585 --> 01:00:04,385
Speaker 4:  just tell you. And zero click searches, which is what they were called, were

968
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:08,105
Speaker 4:  an increasing part of Google's product for just a long time.

969
01:00:08,445 --> 01:00:12,065
Speaker 4:  And the only searches that they would definitely send people to

970
01:00:12,065 --> 01:00:15,785
Speaker 4:  websites for were commercial searches. Stuff where you bought

971
01:00:15,785 --> 01:00:19,695
Speaker 4:  stuff and they were every, if you look at Google IO over the

972
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:23,615
Speaker 4:  years, every demo has always ended with a transaction because once you're

973
01:00:23,615 --> 01:00:27,255
Speaker 4:  doing commercial searches, you get to charge for advertising. And so you

974
01:00:27,255 --> 01:00:31,095
Speaker 4:  can buy yourself to the top of a commercial search, the top result,

975
01:00:31,555 --> 01:00:35,495
Speaker 4:  you're the winner. You, you bought the AdWords auction for shoes, you

976
01:00:35,495 --> 01:00:39,095
Speaker 4:  get the shoes click, you bought some shoes, right? Everyone's happy in

977
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:42,535
Speaker 4:  Google's ecosystem. And that has led to other weird outcomes, right? Where

978
01:00:42,535 --> 01:00:45,695
Speaker 4:  you, you search for the name of a product, you get the competitor first because

979
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,975
Speaker 4:  they bought the ad for the name of the product. Weird outcome made Google

980
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:52,725
Speaker 4:  really rich. That's the web we knew. And then you see what, what

981
01:00:52,825 --> 01:00:56,365
Speaker 4:  AI is doing to that web, right? It it we're, we're just reading the entire

982
01:00:56,425 --> 01:00:59,845
Speaker 4:  web. Maybe that's copyright infringement, maybe it's not. Then we're just

983
01:00:59,845 --> 01:01:02,645
Speaker 4:  gonna summarize it for you and give it to you and businesses will die.

984
01:01:03,725 --> 01:01:07,615
Speaker 4:  Okay? We are gonna run that whole cycle, that 20 year cycle

985
01:01:08,155 --> 01:01:11,095
Speaker 4:  in two minutes with web apps and agents. Yeah.

986
01:01:11,865 --> 01:01:15,115
Speaker 4:  It's gonna run so fast because

987
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:19,275
Speaker 4:  the first wave of agents were not programmatic,

988
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:23,285
Speaker 4:  right? It was like, we're gonna go click around on the website for you

989
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:27,805
Speaker 4:  and Google has these projects, what's it? Mariner projects.

990
01:01:27,805 --> 01:01:31,565
Speaker 4:  Mariner is Google runs Chrome for you in its data center and

991
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:35,725
Speaker 4:  a robot clicks around on a website for you and does the work.

992
01:01:36,635 --> 01:01:40,415
Speaker 4:  And what Demis is saying is why are we doing this? Like this is

993
01:01:40,415 --> 01:01:43,855
Speaker 4:  stupid. We should use these new AI first

994
01:01:44,215 --> 01:01:47,815
Speaker 4:  protocols, which are basically just APIs but made for AI agents like

995
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:51,895
Speaker 4:  MCPA two A, there's, there's a whole alphabet

996
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:55,855
Speaker 4:  soup of these new protocols that are really interesting. And then the

997
01:01:55,855 --> 01:01:59,175
Speaker 4:  agents are gonna go to a website which will just appear like a text prompt

998
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:02,175
Speaker 4:  database. They'll collect information outta the database and bring 'em back

999
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:05,695
Speaker 4:  to you. And once you have that web, okay, now you really do have the giant

1000
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:08,175
Speaker 4:  worldwide interlinked application platform,

1001
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:13,685
Speaker 4:  but you don't have websites, right? You just have a bunch of smart databases

1002
01:02:13,685 --> 01:02:16,805
Speaker 4:  talking to each other. Right? You're making me think of when I was talking

1003
01:02:16,805 --> 01:02:18,565
Speaker 4:  to the Google search team ahead of io,

1004
01:02:18,825 --> 01:02:22,725
Speaker 6:  Liz Reed, who runs the search team, basically made the argument

1005
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:26,605
Speaker 6:  to me that the, the Google search ecosystem that we know now was

1006
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:29,405
Speaker 6:  just a construct of the technology that we had.

1007
01:02:30,755 --> 01:02:34,565
Speaker 6:  That basically all, all we had the technology to do was

1008
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:38,645
Speaker 6:  look forward words in a place. And it was something else. Had

1009
01:02:38,645 --> 01:02:42,445
Speaker 6:  to put them in a place in an order that made sense. And all Google's technology

1010
01:02:42,465 --> 01:02:46,325
Speaker 6:  was able to do was look for it, right? It was somebody else's job to

1011
01:02:46,325 --> 01:02:50,245
Speaker 6:  make it something human possible. And now we have technology

1012
01:02:50,245 --> 01:02:53,485
Speaker 6:  that can make this stuff human possible that maybe we don't need the middleman

1013
01:02:53,745 --> 01:02:57,565
Speaker 6:  of somebody building a thing around it that I can look at. And I think

1014
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:01,405
Speaker 6:  that is like, I, I don't think she meant it to seem like a

1015
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:04,245
Speaker 6:  as huge a statement as she did, but to say

1016
01:03:04,245 --> 01:03:05,285
Speaker 4:  Like the, and I think

1017
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,125
Speaker 6:  It, it reminds me of the thing you always say about Twitter, right? Which

1018
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:11,715
Speaker 6:  is that like criticism of the current Twitter does not

1019
01:03:11,785 --> 01:03:15,595
Speaker 6:  absolve past versions of the company from

1020
01:03:15,595 --> 01:03:16,155
Speaker 6:  being terrible.

1021
01:03:16,345 --> 01:03:18,795
Speaker 4:  Jack Dorsey was also bad. The Neli Patel story,

1022
01:03:18,845 --> 01:03:22,515
Speaker 6:  Right? Like I think the, the argument I think Google is, is

1023
01:03:22,695 --> 01:03:26,555
Speaker 6:  making, but doesn't quite wanna say out loud is that the way

1024
01:03:26,555 --> 01:03:30,315
Speaker 6:  that we've done it for the last 25 years wasn't the right answer. It was

1025
01:03:30,315 --> 01:03:33,355
Speaker 6:  just the one that Google came up with and now they think they have a better

1026
01:03:33,415 --> 01:03:37,155
Speaker 6:  one. And so they're like, well we, we, we sort of reoriented

1027
01:03:37,155 --> 01:03:40,195
Speaker 6:  around one thing and now we have a better thing. Why wouldn't we reorient

1028
01:03:40,205 --> 01:03:43,795
Speaker 6:  again? And I think in a, in a vacuum

1029
01:03:43,975 --> 01:03:47,715
Speaker 6:  that's like a reasonable thing to say, right? Like, we built a better thing,

1030
01:03:47,715 --> 01:03:50,915
Speaker 6:  we're gonna do the thing. But then they're doing the thing that every tech

1031
01:03:50,915 --> 01:03:54,155
Speaker 6:  company does, which is just utterly fail to think about the downstream effects

1032
01:03:54,155 --> 01:03:54,835
Speaker 6:  of their decisions.

1033
01:03:55,055 --> 01:03:57,435
Speaker 4:  Oh, I think they've thought about those effects. You

1034
01:03:57,435 --> 01:03:57,635
Speaker 6:  Think,

1035
01:03:57,895 --> 01:04:00,995
Speaker 4:  And I think they've come to the conclusion after getting beat up for three

1036
01:04:00,995 --> 01:04:04,635
Speaker 4:  years at IO about AI and the downstream effects on the web and

1037
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:09,795
Speaker 4:  being in lawsuits. Like they're like, we don't care. Like if we

1038
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:13,155
Speaker 4:  don't get here, someone else will get here first. And it would be better,

1039
01:04:13,295 --> 01:04:17,195
Speaker 4:  it will be better to take the hits and survive than

1040
01:04:17,415 --> 01:04:18,555
Speaker 4:  to try to play nice and lose.

1041
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:21,635
Speaker 6:  That's the Mark Zuckerberg joker story. Like that's what happens. Yeah. You

1042
01:04:21,635 --> 01:04:24,595
Speaker 6:  get beat up enough times that you, you turn into the joker. And that is,

1043
01:04:24,655 --> 01:04:26,835
Speaker 6:  that's what Mark Zuckerberg did. And

1044
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:30,315
Speaker 4:  I think they're also not for nothing. They're looking at the information

1045
01:04:30,315 --> 01:04:32,795
Speaker 4:  environment they operate in and be like, well, YouTube is bigger than ever.

1046
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:35,275
Speaker 4:  The information is on YouTube. I

1047
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:38,195
Speaker 6:  Mean, It is probably true that if all the websites went away, Google would

1048
01:04:38,195 --> 01:04:40,695
Speaker 6:  be fine. And I think Google kind of knows that.

1049
01:04:41,495 --> 01:04:44,975
Speaker 4:  I, I don't know. I I I think that is more of an open question than not.

1050
01:04:46,135 --> 01:04:49,335
Speaker 4:  'cause all it's gonna be left is slop like the last domino to fall here.

1051
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:53,415
Speaker 4:  Like really the last domino is some scaled media

1052
01:04:53,415 --> 01:04:56,215
Speaker 4:  company opting out of being ranked,

1053
01:04:57,305 --> 01:05:00,615
Speaker 4:  right? So The New York Times says to Google, look, we've just had enough

1054
01:05:01,795 --> 01:05:05,045
Speaker 4:  stop, stop crawling us, stop ranking us, stop serving our news.

1055
01:05:05,825 --> 01:05:09,245
Speaker 4:  And that no one has the leverage against Google yet

1056
01:05:09,915 --> 01:05:13,055
Speaker 4:  at some point they will stop sending enough traffic that someone will make

1057
01:05:13,055 --> 01:05:16,925
Speaker 4:  that call. And, and, and I don't think they've thought that through, like

1058
01:05:17,235 --> 01:05:20,565
Speaker 4:  what happens when the web stops being universally available to Google? Right?

1059
01:05:21,065 --> 01:05:22,965
Speaker 4:  And who knows? Who knows, who knows. To answer to that

1060
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,565
Speaker 6:  Question, even honestly, like my, my immediate reaction to that was to say

1061
01:05:27,505 --> 01:05:30,325
Speaker 6:  the that'll never happen because The New York Times needs Google a lot more

1062
01:05:30,325 --> 01:05:33,005
Speaker 6:  than Google needs The New York Times. But like the, the pure

1063
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:37,845
Speaker 6:  perception hit that Google would take as a place that no longer

1064
01:05:37,955 --> 01:05:41,865
Speaker 6:  sees the whole internet might change it. Like there's

1065
01:05:41,865 --> 01:05:43,025
Speaker 6:  something would happen there.

1066
01:05:43,175 --> 01:05:46,825
Speaker 4:  There's some fine grain controls that are like very political here. So like

1067
01:05:46,965 --> 01:05:50,185
Speaker 4:  you can opt into Google search but not Google AI training, but there are

1068
01:05:50,425 --> 01:05:54,065
Speaker 4:  documents from the various trials. It's, you can see Google executives working

1069
01:05:54,145 --> 01:05:58,105
Speaker 4:  through those options, right? And even creating those options and saying,

1070
01:05:58,105 --> 01:06:01,625
Speaker 4:  well maybe one day we're gonna get to, if you wanna be searched,

1071
01:06:02,205 --> 01:06:05,705
Speaker 4:  you wanna be crawled for the search engine, you have to opt into AI training

1072
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:11,535
Speaker 4:  again, if things continue the way they're going, some

1073
01:06:11,715 --> 01:06:14,895
Speaker 4:  big media company is gonna say, take we're out. Yeah, take us out of this.

1074
01:06:15,415 --> 01:06:18,695
Speaker 4:  I I don dunno when that's gonna be, but like that's the trend line. And that's

1075
01:06:18,695 --> 01:06:22,095
Speaker 4:  when I'm like, the web is a media platform is just under enormous amounts

1076
01:06:22,095 --> 01:06:26,015
Speaker 4:  of pressure. It's, it's hard to, it's hard to see the through line, but

1077
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:30,015
Speaker 4:  I, I know when things are changing, you know, like I can't see the

1078
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,895
Speaker 4:  finish line. I can't see what it looks like at the end, but I know we're

1079
01:06:32,895 --> 01:06:35,935
Speaker 4:  at the beginning of a new phase without any question at all.

1080
01:06:36,355 --> 01:06:36,575
Speaker 6:  Yes.

1081
01:06:36,685 --> 01:06:40,415
Speaker 4:  Something massive is happening here as, yeah, Google is adding a

1082
01:06:40,435 --> 01:06:42,775
Speaker 4:  agents to Chrome. Like that's just a thing that they're trying to do.

1083
01:06:44,555 --> 01:06:47,085
Speaker 4:  More and more people are talking about using the web as basically a series

1084
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:50,125
Speaker 4:  of database like sooner than interview. It is like, what is the web at a

1085
01:06:50,325 --> 01:06:51,405
Speaker 4:  series of databases? Like

1086
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:54,885
Speaker 6:  I also think you, like you, you said to him a thing you, you say a lot, which

1087
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:58,245
Speaker 6:  is that if you, if we were starting The Verge again today, you wouldn't start

1088
01:06:58,245 --> 01:07:01,485
Speaker 6:  a website, you'd start a TikTok channel and he sort of pushed back.

1089
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:06,205
Speaker 6:  But what he said was pretty much in, in as many words he

1090
01:07:06,205 --> 01:07:09,885
Speaker 6:  said, sure you'd start a TikTok channel, but it's only like 2%

1091
01:07:09,915 --> 01:07:13,485
Speaker 6:  more work to have a web presence. So you'd probably do that too. And it's

1092
01:07:13,485 --> 01:07:17,245
Speaker 6:  like, even if that's true, that is such a, I

1093
01:07:17,245 --> 01:07:20,285
Speaker 6:  don't think he realized the extent to which he was telling on himself by

1094
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:23,875
Speaker 6:  saying that. Yeah. And I just, I've been thinking about that ever since.

1095
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:24,355
Speaker 6:  Yeah. When

1096
01:07:24,355 --> 01:07:27,435
Speaker 4:  We started The Verge, a hundred percent of our effort was the website.

1097
01:07:27,915 --> 01:07:31,635
Speaker 6:  Right? But like, oh, but sure you'll, you'll like, you know, do a WordPress

1098
01:07:31,955 --> 01:07:34,475
Speaker 6:  template and put it on the internet. Just why not?

1099
01:07:35,455 --> 01:07:39,195
Speaker 4:  No, I think his answer is much more like it's 2% more work. 'cause you'll

1100
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:43,155
Speaker 4:  prompt Gemini to read your TikTok channel and stand up a website. Like

1101
01:07:43,155 --> 01:07:46,715
Speaker 4:  that's what he meant by 2% more work. And by the way, what I, when I keep

1102
01:07:46,715 --> 01:07:50,155
Speaker 4:  saying there's no way we would start a website today, what I mean is that

1103
01:07:50,155 --> 01:07:53,675
Speaker 4:  we started the Virgin 2011 when cell phones still had three inch

1104
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:57,515
Speaker 4:  screens. Like we, we launched The Verge as basically a

1105
01:07:57,515 --> 01:07:58,075
Speaker 4:  desktop app.

1106
01:07:58,125 --> 01:07:58,875
Speaker 6:  Those are the days.

1107
01:07:59,505 --> 01:08:02,435
Speaker 4:  Like that's what the venture capital money was for. It was, it was just a

1108
01:08:02,435 --> 01:08:05,995
Speaker 4:  very different time. We would just never do that today. Like

1109
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,675
Speaker 4:  you would go address an audience in a different way. And that's what every

1110
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:13,635
Speaker 4:  new media company is trying to do, essentially. I don know. I

1111
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:16,605
Speaker 4:  would just say go listen to that, that conversation again. You'll hear more

1112
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:19,165
Speaker 4:  pushback than you think. And a lot of It is

1113
01:08:20,755 --> 01:08:22,005
Speaker 4:  kind of predicated around,

1114
01:08:23,525 --> 01:08:27,495
Speaker 4:  well it's, it's fine if these things die right? It because other things

1115
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:30,735
Speaker 4:  are growing, which makes sense, like on, on the broadest scale that it's

1116
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:34,705
Speaker 4:  true. That's just life. But you, you see, there's

1117
01:08:34,705 --> 01:08:37,425
Speaker 4:  no longer a defense of like, the things are dying. It's, look at all the

1118
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:41,145
Speaker 4:  stuff that's growing. The one thing that could complicate this, and by the

1119
01:08:41,145 --> 01:08:44,825
Speaker 4:  time you're listening to this, it'll, it will have probably happened,

1120
01:08:45,245 --> 01:08:48,265
Speaker 4:  is that it's closing arguments in the Google search

1121
01:08:48,775 --> 01:08:51,345
Speaker 4:  antitrust remedies phase on Friday. Tomorrow

1122
01:08:52,785 --> 01:08:55,765
Speaker 4:  as you're listening to this has already happened, that's the case where the

1123
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:59,685
Speaker 4:  government is asking for Google to be forced to sell Chrome. And

1124
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:02,165
Speaker 4:  I asked Sudar about this, I said, can you do all the stuff you can you wanna

1125
01:09:02,165 --> 01:09:05,885
Speaker 4:  do if you have to sell Chrome? And he just didn't answer. And his final version

1126
01:09:05,885 --> 01:09:09,165
Speaker 4:  of this, when I knew I'd hit the brick wall, he said, that's not even what

1127
01:09:09,165 --> 01:09:13,005
Speaker 4:  we're looking at. And I was like, well you should, 'cause it might happen

1128
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:13,365
Speaker 4:  to you.

1129
01:09:14,045 --> 01:09:17,965
Speaker 6:  I mean, to be clear, like two things. A, that's clearly a

1130
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:21,765
Speaker 6:  lie and B, he can't tell you anything because it's like ongoing

1131
01:09:21,765 --> 01:09:24,485
Speaker 6:  litigation, right? Like that's a, that's a thing a lawyer looks him in the

1132
01:09:24,485 --> 01:09:28,285
Speaker 6:  eyes and says, Hey Sundar, you cannot say words about this or

1133
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:32,965
Speaker 6:  everyone goes to jail. But like that's, you're

1134
01:09:32,965 --> 01:09:36,765
Speaker 6:  right that that is, that is the question. And I think whether

1135
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:42,025
Speaker 6:  this ends up being good for the web though, is hard to know.

1136
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:45,225
Speaker 6:  It's clearly bad for Google. Whatever's gonna happen is gonna be bad for

1137
01:09:45,225 --> 01:09:48,945
Speaker 6:  Google. But does this just give

1138
01:09:49,055 --> 01:09:52,785
Speaker 6:  open AI new distribution for chat GPT to do the same kind of stuff?

1139
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:57,265
Speaker 6:  Or is there a version of this that actually accrues back to the idea

1140
01:09:57,855 --> 01:10:01,785
Speaker 6:  that the web as a place full of web pages that people go to is a

1141
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:05,275
Speaker 6:  good and valuable idea? 100%.

1142
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:09,425
Speaker 6:  TBD Like genuinely unknown. And I think it's part of what everyone

1143
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:12,225
Speaker 6:  has tried to reckon with in this trial is like, what happens if we do this?

1144
01:10:12,515 --> 01:10:16,385
Speaker 6:  There is a sense that like, we're gonna make it possible for

1145
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:19,425
Speaker 6:  a bunch of other companies to build search engines. But if you believe Google,

1146
01:10:20,325 --> 01:10:23,545
Speaker 6:  the whole premise of a search engine is going away and all anyone will do

1147
01:10:23,545 --> 01:10:27,345
Speaker 6:  is take that search index and build AI products. And if that's what's

1148
01:10:27,345 --> 01:10:30,945
Speaker 6:  happening, then we've, we've solved one kind of Google problem,

1149
01:10:31,485 --> 01:10:34,065
Speaker 6:  but we've just sped up the killing of the web.

1150
01:10:34,935 --> 01:10:38,555
Speaker 4:  We so believing Google there and you know, you have to believe them when

1151
01:10:38,555 --> 01:10:41,715
Speaker 4:  they say like, AI overviews are our most used product ever. And it's like,

1152
01:10:41,755 --> 01:10:45,435
Speaker 4:  'cause you put them in all the pages. I know no one's picking

1153
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:47,875
Speaker 4:  like they're just doing what's in front of them. So I

1154
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:51,355
Speaker 6:  Punched you in the face, you've been punched like you loved it. I dunno.

1155
01:10:52,805 --> 01:10:56,795
Speaker 4:  We'll see, I like, there's a lot here. The reason I

1156
01:10:56,795 --> 01:11:00,625
Speaker 4:  wanted to add all these things up together is you can see the change,

1157
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:05,375
Speaker 4:  like, You know, a year from now The New York

1158
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:07,535
Speaker 4:  Times will run a story about how the web changed and I'll be like, yeah,

1159
01:11:07,815 --> 01:11:11,775
Speaker 4:  I listened to the, I caught that a year ago. 'cause this is the moment,

1160
01:11:12,465 --> 01:11:15,795
Speaker 4:  right? Apple's weird weaknesses, Google's

1161
01:11:16,675 --> 01:11:20,475
Speaker 4:  apparent strength all kind of built around. Like where do the apps

1162
01:11:20,475 --> 01:11:24,235
Speaker 4:  come from? How do you use them? How is the user interface

1163
01:11:24,235 --> 01:11:28,075
Speaker 4:  just gonna be a bunch of natural language? Are the, you know, Google's vision

1164
01:11:28,135 --> 01:11:31,355
Speaker 4:  is that you'll search for something, it will build you an app on the fly

1165
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:35,195
Speaker 4:  and make a new interface to data for you, which is pretty cool.

1166
01:11:35,385 --> 01:11:39,235
Speaker 4:  Like, that's a cool way to think about interacting with the search

1167
01:11:39,235 --> 01:11:42,515
Speaker 4:  engine. Yeah. Many things have to die for that to happen. Like

1168
01:11:43,055 --> 01:11:46,515
Speaker 4:  the dinosaurs were cool, mammals were cooler. Like, sorry bro. Like it's

1169
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:50,375
Speaker 4:  over like the asteroids gonna hit you. That's where I

1170
01:11:50,495 --> 01:11:53,855
Speaker 4:  I I perceive that as clearly as I can now. Like

1171
01:11:54,315 --> 01:11:57,455
Speaker 4:  that's the change that's coming. Yeah. The application models are changing

1172
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:01,815
Speaker 4:  and Apple's weakness is, are they ready for it? And Google's perceived

1173
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:05,175
Speaker 4:  strength is, they're ahead of it, but Google has big questions to answer

1174
01:12:05,175 --> 01:12:09,015
Speaker 4:  to and the downstream effects are like pretty huge this time. Yeah.

1175
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,895
Speaker 6:  And if you're wondering by the way, what is the best possible outcome here?

1176
01:12:12,155 --> 01:12:16,135
Speaker 6:  The answer is the fedi verse. Like if you walk this back all the way to the

1177
01:12:16,135 --> 01:12:19,695
Speaker 6:  beginning of you and I talking about all of this stuff and like how do we,

1178
01:12:19,755 --> 01:12:23,095
Speaker 6:  how do we take the things that are good about this and make it the size of

1179
01:12:23,095 --> 01:12:26,895
Speaker 6:  the web and part of the web. That's how you do it. Yeah. That's the stuff.

1180
01:12:26,895 --> 01:12:30,775
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like big interoperability, which we have to

1181
01:12:30,775 --> 01:12:33,775
Speaker 4:  demand as consumers this time. Yeah. Like the, I don't think the federal

1182
01:12:33,775 --> 01:12:37,135
Speaker 4:  government is gonna demand interoperability although they are in court. You

1183
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:40,935
Speaker 4:  never know. Some settlement could happen. Alright, we gotta take a break.

1184
01:12:40,935 --> 01:12:44,495
Speaker 4:  We're gonna come back with a lightning round, which I have been told, I don't

1185
01:12:44,495 --> 01:12:47,135
Speaker 4:  know, but I have been told It is sponsored. We'll be right back.

1186
01:14:28,355 --> 01:14:32,095
Speaker 4:  we don't do the ads. We refuse to do the ads that we're precious about it.

1187
01:14:32,095 --> 01:14:35,815
Speaker 4:  That's our editorial independence coming through loud and clear. But

1188
01:14:36,995 --> 01:14:40,855
Speaker 4:  the lightning round is sponsored this week, so someone

1189
01:14:40,955 --> 01:14:44,855
Speaker 4:  has to say it. So Eric, our producer, Eric's gonna say it.

1190
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:45,455
Speaker 4:  Eric, go ahead.

1191
01:14:51,725 --> 01:14:54,375
Speaker 6:  That was great Eric. Really good job. Well done. I'm really proud of you.

1192
01:14:54,835 --> 01:14:57,655
Speaker 4:  So there are gonna be so many reactions to that based on what you're said.

1193
01:14:58,525 --> 01:15:02,205
Speaker 4:  Very good. Don't worry though. Still full flavor. 'cause you can't tell

1194
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,365
Speaker 6:  What's the flavor rating now, how do you feel?

1195
01:15:05,245 --> 01:15:09,125
Speaker 4:  I, I'm gonna, I'm I'll drink through this later. All that's fine.

1196
01:15:10,535 --> 01:15:14,445
Speaker 4:  Great. You, you two can sponsor the wedding, right? The

1197
01:15:14,445 --> 01:15:17,245
Speaker 4:  problem is when you cover for not getting the sponsors by insisting that

1198
01:15:17,245 --> 01:15:18,325
Speaker 4:  the sponsors are bad.

1199
01:15:19,965 --> 01:15:22,165
Speaker 4:  I did this to myself, but anyway, still full flavor. 'cause you can't tell

1200
01:15:22,165 --> 01:15:24,045
Speaker 4:  us what to do. The Verge subscriptions are on sale.

1201
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:29,315
Speaker 4:  You see what I'm saying? I'm gonna get better at this, David. All right,

1202
01:15:29,385 --> 01:15:29,835
Speaker 4:  it's time.

1203
01:15:30,435 --> 01:15:34,195
Speaker 6:  Speaking of people who would like to tell us what to do, it's time once again

1204
01:15:34,855 --> 01:15:38,395
Speaker 6:  for America's favorite podcast. Within a podcast. A thing I can just say,

1205
01:15:38,395 --> 01:15:41,395
Speaker 6:  because you can just say things in America in 2025,

1206
01:15:42,145 --> 01:15:46,075
Speaker 6:  Brendan Carr is a dummy neli according to the links I'm seeing here.

1207
01:15:46,385 --> 01:15:47,995
Speaker 6:  Kind of a busy week for our man. Brendan,

1208
01:15:48,705 --> 01:15:51,275
Speaker 4:  Like busy in, in inconsequential ways.

1209
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:52,835
Speaker 6:  Oh, Brendan's favorite.

1210
01:15:53,455 --> 01:15:57,315
Speaker 4:  You know what I mean? Like he, a lot of people had reactions to Brendan this

1211
01:15:57,315 --> 01:15:57,475
Speaker 4:  week.

1212
01:15:58,025 --> 01:15:58,315
Speaker 6:  Okay.

1213
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:00,995
Speaker 4:  And, you know, Brendan continued to just like break stuff in the way that

1214
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:04,795
Speaker 4:  Brendan breaks stuff. But the, the chair of our nation's Federal Communications

1215
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:08,635
Speaker 4:  Commission, It is sort of busy just breaking stuff. So we

1216
01:16:08,695 --> 01:16:12,435
Speaker 4:  ran a big story this week about the bead program. It's the Biden

1217
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:16,235
Speaker 4:  administration's broadband rollout. Lots of criticism of the

1218
01:16:16,235 --> 01:16:18,755
Speaker 4:  bead program, which is supposed to bring broadband to many, many more people,

1219
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:22,635
Speaker 4:  especially in rural areas across the country. We have long talked about how

1220
01:16:22,635 --> 01:16:26,435
Speaker 4:  rural internet is like a disaster. And so Biden passes this big bill,

1221
01:16:27,295 --> 01:16:29,995
Speaker 4:  the bead money is supposed to go out, we're supposed to get internet connections.

1222
01:16:30,195 --> 01:16:33,235
Speaker 4:  Everyone's like, where's the money? We didn't connect one person. Ezra Klein

1223
01:16:33,295 --> 01:16:36,555
Speaker 4:  has sold millions of copies of his book pointing out that bead didn't sell

1224
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:39,715
Speaker 4:  make one in internet connection. That's, it's fine. It's a, it's a meaningful

1225
01:16:39,715 --> 01:16:43,595
Speaker 4:  criticism of this program. The Trump administration is basically shutting

1226
01:16:43,595 --> 01:16:47,115
Speaker 4:  this program down on the cusp of it actually starting to do the things it

1227
01:16:47,115 --> 01:16:50,915
Speaker 4:  wants to do. So West Davis, his last big piece for us as a reporter

1228
01:16:50,915 --> 01:16:54,795
Speaker 4:  here at The Verge, is a deep look at bead where it stands and what's happening

1229
01:16:54,795 --> 01:16:58,635
Speaker 4:  to it. And what is fundamentally happening to It is that the

1230
01:16:58,635 --> 01:17:02,435
Speaker 4:  money was starting to go out to build fiber connections across

1231
01:17:02,455 --> 01:17:06,355
Speaker 4:  the country. And everyone showed up, including our boy, Brendan

1232
01:17:06,415 --> 01:17:09,645
Speaker 4:  and Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, looked at this and said, no,

1233
01:17:09,645 --> 01:17:13,295
Speaker 4:  no, no, no, we want to give the money to

1234
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:16,455
Speaker 4:  Starlink to satellite internet. 'cause when they say satellite internet,

1235
01:17:16,455 --> 01:17:19,175
Speaker 4:  they, they only mean one thing. They don't mean Hughes net.

1236
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:22,295
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You're not giving it to Kuper. Like, what are, what are we doing here?

1237
01:17:22,365 --> 01:17:26,335
Speaker 4:  They mean Starlink. Yeah. So I, we've all this reporting, all these

1238
01:17:26,335 --> 01:17:30,015
Speaker 4:  quotes, we did a great job of this story. You know,

1239
01:17:30,015 --> 01:17:33,695
Speaker 4:  basically saying they were very close to rolling

1240
01:17:33,795 --> 01:17:37,295
Speaker 4:  out like full fiber connections to every single person in West Virginia.

1241
01:17:38,005 --> 01:17:41,935
Speaker 4:  Like that's, that was the plan for the bead money. They were

1242
01:17:41,935 --> 01:17:45,535
Speaker 4:  gonna be able to do it with $150 million to spare and ahead of its deadline.

1243
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,615
Speaker 4:  And now it's gonna shift a bunch of that investment to satellite.

1244
01:17:50,475 --> 01:17:53,895
Speaker 4:  And that's fine. Maybe you love Starlink. But the reality is, and I will

1245
01:17:54,095 --> 01:17:57,935
Speaker 4:  disclose Comcast through its NBC Universal Arm is an investor parenting

1246
01:17:57,935 --> 01:18:01,735
Speaker 4:  company of Vox Media, but they hate me. So that's fine. I, I've not a friend

1247
01:18:01,735 --> 01:18:05,215
Speaker 4:  to the ice piece here, but I'm just gonna point out that wired connections

1248
01:18:05,235 --> 01:18:07,175
Speaker 4:  are generally superior to wireless ones,

1249
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:10,215
Speaker 6:  Especially when they've already been built and exists.

1250
01:18:10,345 --> 01:18:13,095
Speaker 4:  Especially when there's already the infrastructure, especially when the wired

1251
01:18:13,095 --> 01:18:16,615
Speaker 4:  connections are so much faster than the satellite connections and do not

1252
01:18:16,615 --> 01:18:19,575
Speaker 4:  require line of sight, which Starlink still requires line of sight.

1253
01:18:20,955 --> 01:18:24,415
Speaker 4:  So we're just at this place where this program, which

1254
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:28,615
Speaker 4:  there are many, many realistic criticisms of It, is now running into

1255
01:18:29,045 --> 01:18:33,015
Speaker 4:  political expediency. And in particular, Brendan loves to talk about

1256
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:36,455
Speaker 4:  Sterling satellite 'cause he loves Elon Musk and he, he's captured

1257
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:38,175
Speaker 4:  moron. So that's one for Brendan.

1258
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:42,495
Speaker 6:  $20 billion by the way, is is the, the number

1259
01:18:42,505 --> 01:18:45,335
Speaker 6:  we've seen floating around that this is the bead is a

1260
01:18:45,335 --> 01:18:49,295
Speaker 6:  42.6, I think billion dollar program. And

1261
01:18:50,195 --> 01:18:54,095
Speaker 6:  the, the reporting is that as much as 20 billion of that could

1262
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:57,055
Speaker 6:  just get thrown directly at Starlink to do

1263
01:18:57,485 --> 01:18:58,095
Speaker 6:  something.

1264
01:18:58,355 --> 01:19:01,655
Speaker 4:  And it's fine. Look, Wes did a great job of this story. I encourage you to

1265
01:19:01,655 --> 01:19:05,575
Speaker 4:  read it. It'll be in the show notes. The, there are lots of

1266
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:08,775
Speaker 4:  people in the story who say, look, fiber is not practical for a hundred percent

1267
01:19:08,775 --> 01:19:12,415
Speaker 4:  of population. Of course, we were gonna also do Starlink in satellite and

1268
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:15,975
Speaker 4:  other fixed wireless solutions for a lot of people, there's a

1269
01:19:15,975 --> 01:19:19,135
Speaker 4:  administrator in the state of Nevada who says, we, we, this is what we were

1270
01:19:19,135 --> 01:19:22,535
Speaker 4:  gonna do there. But the ratios are being flipped to favor strong. It's just

1271
01:19:22,535 --> 01:19:23,135
Speaker 4:  like naked correction.

1272
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:26,015
Speaker 6:  We're just gonna put little ultra wideband 5G things

1273
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:29,605
Speaker 6:  everywhere around America. It's gonna solve all our problems. Yeah.

1274
01:19:30,225 --> 01:19:33,885
Speaker 4:  As 5G does. Speaking of 5G you'll recall,

1275
01:19:34,205 --> 01:19:36,605
Speaker 4:  I think it was last week, a couple weeks ago, we, we had basically a moral

1276
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:40,205
Speaker 4:  dilemma because of Brendan where we couldn't tell who the villain was in

1277
01:19:40,205 --> 01:19:41,565
Speaker 4:  a particular Brendan story. Didn't

1278
01:19:41,565 --> 01:19:42,165
Speaker 6:  Like that. So

1279
01:19:42,165 --> 01:19:46,005
Speaker 4:  Brendan sent a letter to Dish Network saying, Hey,

1280
01:19:46,025 --> 01:19:49,365
Speaker 4:  you were supposed to build a nationwide 5G network

1281
01:19:50,105 --> 01:19:53,365
Speaker 4:  to compete with T-Mobile at and t and Verizon. And you're supposed to do

1282
01:19:53,365 --> 01:19:57,205
Speaker 4:  that because we allowed T-Mobile to buy Sprint and to preserve

1283
01:19:57,205 --> 01:20:00,965
Speaker 4:  competition in America. We gave you Boost Mobile and a bunch of

1284
01:20:01,085 --> 01:20:04,245
Speaker 4:  spectrum and a bunch of money. And they're supposed to be network and there's

1285
01:20:04,245 --> 01:20:07,325
Speaker 4:  no network. And I'm Brendan Carr and I love being angry at stuff. And now

1286
01:20:07,325 --> 01:20:10,485
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna yell at you Charlie Ergen, CEO of Dish Network. And it's hard to

1287
01:20:10,485 --> 01:20:13,965
Speaker 4:  tell who the villain in that story is, but truly hard. Like you're making

1288
01:20:13,965 --> 01:20:16,685
Speaker 4:  the right criticisms for the wrong totally politically motivated reasons.

1289
01:20:16,705 --> 01:20:20,645
Speaker 4:  That's Brendan Carr on a good day. Like that's the best we can hope for

1290
01:20:20,645 --> 01:20:23,525
Speaker 4:  him. Yes. So Dish Network has chosen to fight back

1291
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:28,285
Speaker 4:  a bunch of partners of EchoStar. A bunch of its vendors

1292
01:20:29,145 --> 01:20:33,085
Speaker 4:  are saying that Dish is actually building a network.

1293
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:38,805
Speaker 4:  They say that they have 7 million customers, the majority of

1294
01:20:38,805 --> 01:20:42,285
Speaker 4:  whom are still basically roaming on at and t and T-Mobile,

1295
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:46,405
Speaker 4:  but they're their own network is serving 1.3 million people.

1296
01:20:46,905 --> 01:20:50,845
Speaker 4:  Oh. Remind either America has somewhere over 300 million people. So

1297
01:20:51,265 --> 01:20:54,645
Speaker 4:  as a nationwide competitor to the Bigs not doing great,

1298
01:20:54,645 --> 01:20:58,085
Speaker 6:  What's wild is I still that even that number still seems too high to me.

1299
01:20:58,085 --> 01:20:59,405
Speaker 6:  Like that 1.3 million

1300
01:20:59,405 --> 01:21:02,765
Speaker 4:  Is like, if you are one of the 1.3 million people in America

1301
01:21:03,185 --> 01:21:07,005
Speaker 4:  who are getting native 5G service from Dish Network,

1302
01:21:07,235 --> 01:21:09,685
Speaker 4:  call me. Yeah, I don't believe you

1303
01:21:09,695 --> 01:21:11,805
Speaker 6:  Exist. Call me from your Echo Star phone.

1304
01:21:12,665 --> 01:21:16,445
Speaker 4:  That's like a huge 90 satellite. And they're saying they,

1305
01:21:16,445 --> 01:21:18,885
Speaker 4:  they gained 88,000 wireless subscribers in April.

1306
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:24,125
Speaker 4:  So that means 88,000 people in April signed up for Dish Network's

1307
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:27,845
Speaker 4:  5G Service. You tell me who you are.

1308
01:21:29,245 --> 01:21:32,925
Speaker 4:  I am guessing they mean Boost Mobile, which is their owned and operated

1309
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:36,765
Speaker 4:  prepaid service, right? Sure. Great. That's the

1310
01:21:36,765 --> 01:21:40,365
Speaker 4:  state of play Dish is fighting back by claiming it has 1.3 million

1311
01:21:40,365 --> 01:21:44,285
Speaker 4:  5G customers running on its network and everyone else is effectively by

1312
01:21:44,285 --> 01:21:47,125
Speaker 4:  at t and T-Mobile service reselling on its own name.

1313
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:51,565
Speaker 4:  All that sucks. Like that is not what was supposed to happen. By the way,

1314
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:54,845
Speaker 4:  a deal that Ajit Pie made that Brendan is, and Brendan, you know, he's part

1315
01:21:54,845 --> 01:21:58,285
Speaker 4:  of, he was part of that chain and now he's trying to unwind it by yelling

1316
01:21:58,285 --> 01:22:01,085
Speaker 4:  at Charlie. So I know what's going on there. I do know that

1317
01:22:02,075 --> 01:22:04,925
Speaker 4:  Brendan, what does he wanna do with the spectrum that he wants to reclaim

1318
01:22:04,925 --> 01:22:08,565
Speaker 4:  from Dish? He wants to give it to Starlink. Yep. Other

1319
01:22:08,845 --> 01:22:12,085
Speaker 4:  satellite companies have also started acting for the spectrum. This is just

1320
01:22:12,315 --> 01:22:16,165
Speaker 4:  dumb naked corruption that started with a dumb, naked corrupt deal that

1321
01:22:16,235 --> 01:22:20,015
Speaker 4:  Ajit Pie made that Brendan is carrying on. That's life

1322
01:22:21,045 --> 01:22:24,575
Speaker 4:  Last, last two little bits of Brendan, like I said, he is just like carrying

1323
01:22:24,575 --> 01:22:25,335
Speaker 4:  on breaking stuff.

1324
01:22:26,955 --> 01:22:30,725
Speaker 4:  Anna Gomez, who's the last Democratic commissioner on the

1325
01:22:30,725 --> 01:22:34,285
Speaker 4:  FCC, they're supposed to, you know, have five and it's supposed to be three

1326
01:22:34,285 --> 01:22:38,125
Speaker 4:  two depending on who whose party has the presidency. Right now they're,

1327
01:22:38,315 --> 01:22:40,325
Speaker 4:  it's three one. So we're doing great.

1328
01:22:42,575 --> 01:22:46,165
Speaker 4:  She's on tour. She's doing this like First Amendment tour pointing out

1329
01:22:46,435 --> 01:22:50,045
Speaker 4:  that Brendan is a threat to free speech. So she's like going to college

1330
01:22:50,325 --> 01:22:52,325
Speaker 4:  campuses. We've talked about her before. I'm gonna, we're I'm gonna try to

1331
01:22:52,325 --> 01:22:53,125
Speaker 4:  get her on one of these shows.

1332
01:22:53,345 --> 01:22:56,845
Speaker 6:  Do you think she's our competition in the Brendan Carr as the dummy podcast

1333
01:22:56,975 --> 01:23:00,365
Speaker 6:  space? Like I, I hear she's going on tour and I'm like, maybe we need to

1334
01:23:00,365 --> 01:23:00,725
Speaker 6:  go on our own

1335
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:04,165
Speaker 4:  Tour. We should go on our own tour. We should combine forces. I mean, she's

1336
01:23:04,165 --> 01:23:07,525
Speaker 4:  also a politician and I have a number of questions for why the FCC is totally

1337
01:23:07,725 --> 01:23:10,445
Speaker 4:  ineffective and weak that I could direct at her as well. And so I've done

1338
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:12,565
Speaker 4:  to every FCC person that has ever appeared on,

1339
01:23:12,745 --> 01:23:16,125
Speaker 6:  All right, so we're gonna go on a tour that exactly matches her tour and

1340
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:19,565
Speaker 6:  we're just gonna be like one building away. Yep.

1341
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:23,725
Speaker 4:  It's gonna be like, you know, they, they all suck anyhow.

1342
01:23:23,815 --> 01:23:24,685
Speaker 4:  She's on tour. She's the

1343
01:23:24,685 --> 01:23:27,525
Speaker 6:  Us with the party speaker and microphones just yelling at Anna Gomez.

1344
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:30,765
Speaker 4:  We'll get a bigger party speaker. We'll get that JBL man that thing's hot.

1345
01:23:32,115 --> 01:23:35,965
Speaker 4:  Anna is saying that it's an administration Wide Effort to chill speech and

1346
01:23:35,965 --> 01:23:39,885
Speaker 4:  stifle dissenting voices. And she says it, Brendan is

1347
01:23:39,885 --> 01:23:41,885
Speaker 4:  leading a clear effort to quash descent.

1348
01:23:43,495 --> 01:23:45,845
Speaker 4:  She's basically picking the fight. She's like trying to get fired. Yeah.

1349
01:23:45,845 --> 01:23:49,685
Speaker 4:  She's even saying, I will probably get fired for doing this. And so far Trump

1350
01:23:49,685 --> 01:23:52,765
Speaker 4:  hasn't fired her. I don't think that he knows that she exists, but it's coming.

1351
01:23:53,155 --> 01:23:56,885
Speaker 4:  This is the next turn. She's gonna make enough noise and get fired. And she's,

1352
01:23:58,005 --> 01:24:01,565
Speaker 6:  I mean, you don't do this unless that's the outcome you're assuming is happening.

1353
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:05,205
Speaker 4:  Her quote, she says, I don't know why I'm still in my job.

1354
01:24:05,865 --> 01:24:08,965
Speaker 4:  And then she says, if I get fired, it isn't because I didn't do my job, it's

1355
01:24:08,965 --> 01:24:11,485
Speaker 4:  because I insisted upon doing it by what she means, protecting

1356
01:24:11,605 --> 01:24:13,645
Speaker 6:  Research. So I feel every time you and I record The Verge cast,

1357
01:24:14,345 --> 01:24:17,925
Speaker 4:  That's very good. All of this has ended in maybe the most

1358
01:24:18,515 --> 01:24:22,485
Speaker 4:  pretzel like logic of all in the pages of the Wall Street Journal

1359
01:24:22,485 --> 01:24:26,285
Speaker 4:  opinion section where they have attacked Brendan this week

1360
01:24:27,025 --> 01:24:30,885
Speaker 4:  for being an authoritarian censorship machine.

1361
01:24:32,425 --> 01:24:35,845
Speaker 4:  And their response because of the Wall Street Journal is that the entire

1362
01:24:36,085 --> 01:24:39,205
Speaker 4:  FCC should be shut down and turned over to the private market.

1363
01:24:41,155 --> 01:24:43,155
Speaker 6:  Give it to Starlink. He's just like,

1364
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:47,435
Speaker 4:  Just like full horseshoe theory of politics. Like

1365
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:50,635
Speaker 4:  even the most libertarian opinion section that you can get in the Wall Street

1366
01:24:50,635 --> 01:24:54,155
Speaker 4:  Journal is like, yeah, that dude sucks. Like he's misusing government power.

1367
01:24:55,065 --> 01:24:55,835
Speaker 4:  Shut it all down.

1368
01:24:59,075 --> 01:25:02,395
Speaker 6:  I do like the idea of a privatized FCC, what could possibly go wrong?

1369
01:25:03,295 --> 01:25:07,155
Speaker 4:  You know, it's not like the, there's not like there's scarce wireless spectrum

1370
01:25:07,655 --> 01:25:11,315
Speaker 4:  and you want to protect things like the FAA from people's cell phone emissions.

1371
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:14,715
Speaker 4:  Like whatever. Why would you ever wanna do that? Yeah. But it's great. I

1372
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:18,515
Speaker 4:  love it. I I do love the fact that Brendan has United left and right

1373
01:25:19,055 --> 01:25:22,955
Speaker 4:  in just pure hatred of his moronic censor censorship machine that

1374
01:25:22,955 --> 01:25:26,835
Speaker 4:  he's building. He's a dummy and it's, it's rare that I'm like,

1375
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:30,795
Speaker 4:  you should read this Wall Street Journal opinion page piece. As

1376
01:25:30,795 --> 01:25:34,315
Speaker 4:  always, I remind you the only politics we can we consistently express in

1377
01:25:34,315 --> 01:25:38,115
Speaker 4:  the show are that free markets are pretty good competition makes better products

1378
01:25:38,215 --> 01:25:41,355
Speaker 4:  and you should be a little bit less racist than Brendan Carr. If you think

1379
01:25:41,355 --> 01:25:44,675
Speaker 4:  that's wildly leftist, you are free to believe that. But that's what you

1380
01:25:44,675 --> 01:25:48,355
Speaker 4:  get from us. And also now I'm telling you, I agree with the Wall Street

1381
01:25:48,355 --> 01:25:49,475
Speaker 4:  Journal subpoena pages

1382
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:52,275
Speaker 6:  Telling you man, strange bedfellows these days.

1383
01:25:52,505 --> 01:25:55,675
Speaker 4:  It's weird times here in America. Yeah. As ever, Brendan, you're welcome

1384
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:59,115
Speaker 4:  to come on the show and defend any of this stuff. You can appear via Starlink

1385
01:25:59,115 --> 01:26:03,045
Speaker 4:  if you want. You, you too can be sponsored by your buddy Elon, but

1386
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:05,325
Speaker 4:  I don't think you we'll ever do it. 'cause I think you're a coward and a

1387
01:26:05,325 --> 01:26:09,285
Speaker 4:  dummy. So if you want to prove me wrong, all of our, all of our platforms

1388
01:26:09,285 --> 01:26:11,685
Speaker 4:  are available to you. I will say that David are both having children soon,

1389
01:26:11,745 --> 01:26:15,165
Speaker 4:  so the clock is ticking my man. Yeah, yeah. You gotta get, you gotta get

1390
01:26:15,165 --> 01:26:15,445
Speaker 4:  on here,

1391
01:26:15,555 --> 01:26:18,525
Speaker 6:  Brendan. If you wanna host The Vergecast this summer, get at us. We can talk

1392
01:26:18,525 --> 01:26:18,805
Speaker 6:  about it.

1393
01:26:19,655 --> 01:26:21,705
Speaker 4:  That door shockingly open

1394
01:26:25,915 --> 01:26:26,985
Speaker 4:  dying to know what Brendan

1395
01:26:26,985 --> 01:26:29,185
Speaker 6:  Thinks, but you do have to do Brendan Carr a dummy every week.

1396
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:33,145
Speaker 4:  I love it. All right. We need a pallet cleanser. What do you got?

1397
01:26:33,815 --> 01:26:37,025
Speaker 6:  It's almost switch time. Are you, are you, did you buy a switch?

1398
01:26:37,785 --> 01:26:41,465
Speaker 4:  I did not. Okay. I did not. So I play one video game, Madden and I at

1399
01:26:41,665 --> 01:26:45,625
Speaker 4:  the point now where I've, I've mastered last year's Madden just in time

1400
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:46,345
Speaker 4:  for the new one to come out.

1401
01:26:46,365 --> 01:26:48,945
Speaker 6:  Oh, that's, I mean, that's, that's the ideal Madden scenario.

1402
01:26:49,175 --> 01:26:52,945
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm also waiting for metal gear, solid snake eater delta force

1403
01:26:52,965 --> 01:26:55,905
Speaker 4:  or whatever it's called to come out pins and needles for that one. But that's

1404
01:26:55,905 --> 01:26:56,505
Speaker 4:  not switch stuff.

1405
01:26:56,655 --> 01:26:59,825
Speaker 6:  Okay. No, but the switch to is coming next week,

1406
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:00,785
Speaker 6:  June 5th,

1407
01:27:03,815 --> 01:27:07,475
Speaker 6:  easily to me, the gadget of the year, like not knowing everything we know

1408
01:27:07,475 --> 01:27:11,115
Speaker 6:  about the rest of the year. I can't imagine what would have to happen for

1409
01:27:11,115 --> 01:27:14,195
Speaker 6:  the switch two to not be the most consequential piece of hardware that's

1410
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:14,515
Speaker 6:  coming out.

1411
01:27:16,325 --> 01:27:20,275
Speaker 6:  We're learning a bunch of stuff about it already. As far as I can tell.

1412
01:27:20,395 --> 01:27:24,155
Speaker 6:  Nintendo seems to have been pretty tight with like, who's getting, it's not

1413
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:27,955
Speaker 6:  like there's been like a, you know, Casey Nys stat hands-on

1414
01:27:27,955 --> 01:27:30,995
Speaker 6:  or like a bunch of like lifestyle influencers getting to use the thing like

1415
01:27:31,695 --> 01:27:34,315
Speaker 6:  not that many people seem to have switched to yet, but stuff is starting

1416
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:38,235
Speaker 6:  to trickle out somebody. There was an unboxing video that somebody did that

1417
01:27:38,235 --> 01:27:42,155
Speaker 6:  got immediately yanked offline. We've been covering kind of

1418
01:27:42,155 --> 01:27:45,155
Speaker 6:  the run up to it a bunch. J Peters wrote a really good story basically being

1419
01:27:45,155 --> 01:27:48,875
Speaker 6:  like the switch to is the we you done correctly,

1420
01:27:49,195 --> 01:27:52,715
Speaker 6:  which is both like a good point and kind of a sick burn on all of Nintendo's

1421
01:27:52,715 --> 01:27:53,155
Speaker 6:  history.

1422
01:27:54,735 --> 01:27:58,395
Speaker 6:  But I just think this is like, it's a really interesting gadget moment

1423
01:27:58,655 --> 01:28:01,635
Speaker 6:  in that I think if the switch to is everything we think it might be,

1424
01:28:02,795 --> 01:28:06,715
Speaker 6:  I kind of think it's a big deal just as a piece of hardware. Like if we

1425
01:28:06,715 --> 01:28:10,595
Speaker 6:  have this thing that really makes portable gaming that is

1426
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:14,115
Speaker 6:  high end and long lasting and like the, the fact that the Mario Kart game

1427
01:28:14,115 --> 01:28:17,235
Speaker 6:  is like an open world Mario Kart game that you can play anywhere

1428
01:28:17,745 --> 01:28:21,435
Speaker 6:  demands a lot of the hardware, it demands a lot of the wireless. Like if

1429
01:28:21,435 --> 01:28:24,475
Speaker 6:  this stuff works, I think we're, we get to the point where like

1430
01:28:25,065 --> 01:28:28,595
Speaker 6:  there's just a lot of things that suddenly start to feel possible in gadget

1431
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:32,535
Speaker 6:  design that I'm very excited about, which is a lot to say

1432
01:28:32,535 --> 01:28:35,735
Speaker 6:  about a slightly bigger switch, but like, it's really how I feel.

1433
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:38,415
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean, you're all the way in on Gadget of the Year.

1434
01:28:38,995 --> 01:28:42,975
Speaker 6:  Oh, hands down. Like, I, I what else could, like, I I, I

1435
01:28:42,975 --> 01:28:45,975
Speaker 6:  have such a hard time imagining something be more

1436
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:49,775
Speaker 6:  important than the switch too. Like, if this thing sucks, it's gonna be

1437
01:28:50,215 --> 01:28:54,095
Speaker 6:  devastating. But also again, like I think if, if Nintendo

1438
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:57,615
Speaker 6:  just takes all these ideas that it had about the sort of

1439
01:28:57,705 --> 01:29:00,815
Speaker 6:  modularity and the portability and this idea that you can have a thing that

1440
01:29:00,815 --> 01:29:04,205
Speaker 6:  connects to all of your screens and all of your devices all at once and actually

1441
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:08,005
Speaker 6:  makes that like another tick better in every respect,

1442
01:29:09,405 --> 01:29:12,375
Speaker 6:  it's just gonna be amazing. And there's so many ideas that if you just broaden

1443
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:15,215
Speaker 6:  it out slightly starts to change. Like, oh, how do we think about our other

1444
01:29:15,215 --> 01:29:19,005
Speaker 6:  gadgets? And like what if Nintendo is doing all the

1445
01:29:19,005 --> 01:29:22,885
Speaker 6:  like, handoff stuff that Apple has never successfully done with

1446
01:29:22,905 --> 01:29:26,525
Speaker 6:  its devices. Like why can't I dock my iPhone into my television Neli?

1447
01:29:26,705 --> 01:29:26,925
Speaker 6:  Why

1448
01:29:28,525 --> 01:29:29,685
Speaker 6:  Nintendo figured it out.

1449
01:29:29,835 --> 01:29:33,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's funny, apple, one of the other coats of paint rumors about Apple

1450
01:29:33,645 --> 01:29:36,565
Speaker 4:  is, so we're gonna redo Game Center to make it more like Xbox Live.

1451
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:39,045
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. There's like a, it's, it's a whole app.

1452
01:29:39,305 --> 01:29:42,885
Speaker 4:  You can see the convergence here. Yeah. Look, I I think it's possible to

1453
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:46,645
Speaker 4:  switch to is the, the device of the year. I, I think certainly it will be

1454
01:29:46,645 --> 01:29:49,165
Speaker 4:  the gaming device of the year and it's the one that people are the most excited

1455
01:29:49,165 --> 01:29:51,445
Speaker 4:  about. Certainly the games look great from the coverage we've done and that

1456
01:29:51,445 --> 01:29:54,765
Speaker 4:  our reporters have gotten to, to try out, but Cash of the Year is a big one.

1457
01:29:56,095 --> 01:30:00,055
Speaker 6:  I I could, I, I mean, as somebody who covers gadgets, I hope

1458
01:30:00,075 --> 01:30:04,015
Speaker 6:  I'm wrong. It's fun if I'm wrong, but I just think, I mean, this

1459
01:30:04,015 --> 01:30:07,535
Speaker 6:  one's really interesting because the first switch when it came out was like

1460
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:10,935
Speaker 6:  cool and exciting, but it was a, it was a breath of the Wild machine, right?

1461
01:30:10,935 --> 01:30:14,535
Speaker 6:  Like that's fundamentally what it was. And this one is making much

1462
01:30:14,685 --> 01:30:18,615
Speaker 6:  more of a hardware first play. Like there are lots of new

1463
01:30:18,615 --> 01:30:21,895
Speaker 6:  games, but some of the new games are also gonna play in the old Switch and

1464
01:30:21,895 --> 01:30:25,255
Speaker 6:  there's nothing as sort of immediately

1465
01:30:26,265 --> 01:30:29,855
Speaker 6:  earth shattering as there was with Breath of the Wild. And So I think

1466
01:30:30,115 --> 01:30:34,095
Speaker 6:  the idea that this thing is gonna have to sell itself as hardware A

1467
01:30:34,105 --> 01:30:37,855
Speaker 6:  seems to be a thing. Nintendo knows and b is going to be super fascinating

1468
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:40,215
Speaker 6:  and they're trying to do all this interesting ecosystem software. They're

1469
01:30:40,215 --> 01:30:43,335
Speaker 6:  like, what if we, you know, sell you a third party camera that connects to

1470
01:30:43,335 --> 01:30:46,695
Speaker 6:  the thing I'm telling you? Like, I have been wanting modular gadgets for

1471
01:30:46,695 --> 01:30:50,455
Speaker 6:  as long as I have known you, and this is the closest thing to properly

1472
01:30:50,455 --> 01:30:54,295
Speaker 6:  pulling that off if it pulls it off that I think we've ever seen.

1473
01:30:54,845 --> 01:30:56,575
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All right. Maybe I'll buy one.

1474
01:30:58,055 --> 01:31:01,975
Speaker 6:  I So here's my question for you is should I go stand in

1475
01:31:01,975 --> 01:31:04,655
Speaker 6:  line at a GameStop at midnight to try and buy this thing? Yes. Like, am I

1476
01:31:04,965 --> 01:31:06,415
Speaker 4:  Just for the content, do it for the Gram?

1477
01:31:08,205 --> 01:31:08,495
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1478
01:31:08,525 --> 01:31:11,935
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think I'm going to, obviously I'm dying to know, have you read any

1479
01:31:12,135 --> 01:31:15,775
Speaker 4:  of this new Apple in China book, by the way? No, there's just long,

1480
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:19,535
Speaker 4:  it's, it's really interesting. There's a lot of reporting in there, but a

1481
01:31:19,535 --> 01:31:23,255
Speaker 4:  lot of It is about how the Apple we know is more shaped

1482
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:27,215
Speaker 4:  by like Chinese resellers standing in line than, than anyone can

1483
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:28,135
Speaker 4:  possibly see. Oh,

1484
01:31:28,295 --> 01:31:28,495
Speaker 6:  Interesting.

1485
01:31:28,755 --> 01:31:31,415
Speaker 4:  And that's, that's really the story of gadget lines now. Like we've all but

1486
01:31:31,415 --> 01:31:33,935
Speaker 4:  stopped covering them because it's basically a bunch of resellers standing

1487
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:37,255
Speaker 4:  in line. Yes. And it's like, it's not like a joyous community. It's,

1488
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:40,935
Speaker 4:  It is kind of gross and, and in a lot of ways. But I think you should go

1489
01:31:41,355 --> 01:31:42,975
Speaker 4:  and be like, I'm here for joyous community

1490
01:31:44,385 --> 01:31:46,965
Speaker 6:  And then just interview a bunch of resellers, see what happens,

1491
01:31:47,385 --> 01:31:50,805
Speaker 4:  See what they're like. I like it. Be like So you're flipping the switch,

1492
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:51,405
Speaker 4:  huh? How much?

1493
01:31:51,905 --> 01:31:54,605
Speaker 6:  All right. Well, I will, I will report back next week, but I think, I think

1494
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:57,165
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to GameStop and see what kind of trouble I

1495
01:31:57,165 --> 01:31:58,045
Speaker 6:  can get into. Yeah.

1496
01:31:58,425 --> 01:32:01,845
Speaker 4:  All right. We should end with breaking news. The tariffs have been paused,

1497
01:32:01,845 --> 01:32:02,045
Speaker 4:  David,

1498
01:32:05,115 --> 01:32:09,105
Speaker 4:  while we, while we were talking, the tariffs are back on the pause of the,

1499
01:32:09,475 --> 01:32:12,745
Speaker 4:  while the pause of the tariffs was paused. Do you understand what

1500
01:32:12,745 --> 01:32:14,705
Speaker 6:  I'm saying? We've, we've unpaused by, by

1501
01:32:14,705 --> 01:32:17,185
Speaker 4:  Pause the Court of Appeals has blocked the pausing of the tariffs.

1502
01:32:18,925 --> 01:32:20,125
Speaker 6:  I don't care. I'm

1503
01:32:20,205 --> 01:32:22,405
Speaker 4:  Over it. That's, that's what I'm saying. Elon Musk is outta the White House,

1504
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:26,125
Speaker 4:  by the way. Elon Musk, you know, he, they, it's clear that he got himself.

1505
01:32:26,305 --> 01:32:29,125
Speaker 4:  No one likes him anymore. So he is been off boarded officially from Doge.

1506
01:32:30,635 --> 01:32:34,485
Speaker 4:  He's on a to interview circuit right now. Yeah. He spoke to Ars

1507
01:32:34,485 --> 01:32:37,765
Speaker 4:  Technica with CBS news, I think with the Washington Post. He's, he's trying

1508
01:32:37,765 --> 01:32:41,205
Speaker 4:  to make a big show of being back at Tesla. Tesla sales are tanking around

1509
01:32:41,205 --> 01:32:44,805
Speaker 4:  the world, but like in ways that are like hard to cover,

1510
01:32:45,355 --> 01:32:49,045
Speaker 4:  like in, in Europe in one quarter they're down. Right?

1511
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:53,005
Speaker 4:  They're, they've cratered in Quebec. It's like you gotta,

1512
01:32:53,765 --> 01:32:57,325
Speaker 4:  whatever, there's a bunch of data that says a story in like weird

1513
01:32:58,115 --> 01:33:02,045
Speaker 4:  independent ways and then they're supposed to launch the roboto taxis like

1514
01:33:02,435 --> 01:33:02,725
Speaker 4:  soon.

1515
01:33:03,155 --> 01:33:05,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Tweet. He, he's been saying they're like out on the road doing stuff,

1516
01:33:05,565 --> 01:33:06,045
Speaker 6:  right? Yeah.

1517
01:33:06,045 --> 01:33:10,005
Speaker 4:  There's driverless cars in Austin. So if you're in Austin and you see

1518
01:33:10,045 --> 01:33:13,525
Speaker 4:  a party speaker or a robo taxi, let, let me know. If you see

1519
01:33:13,565 --> 01:33:16,725
Speaker 6:  A party speaker and a robo in one photo,

1520
01:33:17,585 --> 01:33:20,485
Speaker 6:  we will send you VERGE merch. I can't, I don't know what it'll be, but I'll

1521
01:33:20,485 --> 01:33:21,045
Speaker 6:  send you something.

1522
01:33:21,325 --> 01:33:22,885
Speaker 4:  I will send you a party speaker. That'd

1523
01:33:22,885 --> 01:33:25,005
Speaker 6:  Be great. Yeah. But I think the, just the, the one thing I've been thinking

1524
01:33:25,005 --> 01:33:28,485
Speaker 6:  a lot about with the, the Musk stuff is the, the thing he keeps saying in

1525
01:33:28,485 --> 01:33:31,085
Speaker 6:  all these interviews is that he's like back to sleeping on factory floors

1526
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:34,805
Speaker 6:  and in conference rooms at Tesla. And it's like, it's very much a show

1527
01:33:34,945 --> 01:33:38,445
Speaker 6:  of I am back paying attention to my company designed

1528
01:33:39,135 --> 01:33:42,925
Speaker 6:  especially to like, you know, appease investors

1529
01:33:43,025 --> 01:33:46,845
Speaker 6:  who have been worried about Tesla being completely ignored by its

1530
01:33:46,845 --> 01:33:50,505
Speaker 6:  CEO for a long time. I'm very curious to see how

1531
01:33:51,575 --> 01:33:54,605
Speaker 6:  that helps Tesla's case

1532
01:33:55,185 --> 01:33:58,565
Speaker 6:  versus again, like with, with these sales changes, this ongoing

1533
01:33:59,655 --> 01:34:03,365
Speaker 6:  disastrous branding that the company has gone through because of Elon Musk

1534
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:07,525
Speaker 6:  that is like, he is the, the company's greatest asset and

1535
01:34:07,525 --> 01:34:11,165
Speaker 6:  worst problem. And that's been true for a long time, but for a long time

1536
01:34:12,065 --> 01:34:15,445
Speaker 6:  at least financially asset outweighed problem pretty aggressively.

1537
01:34:15,905 --> 01:34:19,845
Speaker 6:  And it really feels like that has flipped. And I, I'm just curious to see

1538
01:34:20,665 --> 01:34:24,405
Speaker 6:  if he can change that perception just by being back at

1539
01:34:24,405 --> 01:34:27,165
Speaker 6:  Tesla more. But I don't, I don't see it.

1540
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:30,365
Speaker 4:  I don't either. I don don't see it. There's, there's nothing to be done in

1541
01:34:30,365 --> 01:34:31,085
Speaker 4:  the factory for him.

1542
01:34:32,175 --> 01:34:32,395
Speaker 6:  No.

1543
01:34:32,495 --> 01:34:35,755
Speaker 4:  What's he like? He's not, he can't invent a new car to fix it right now.

1544
01:34:35,865 --> 01:34:36,635
Speaker 4:  Like Yeah.

1545
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:40,755
Speaker 6:  I think that's also increasingly clear to a lot of people is that the, the

1546
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:44,395
Speaker 6:  sleeping at the factory might have been a bit and maybe not part of my man's

1547
01:34:44,395 --> 01:34:44,795
Speaker 6:  day-to-day job.

1548
01:34:46,225 --> 01:34:48,155
Speaker 4:  Well, he's gotten more children than father

1549
01:34:50,175 --> 01:34:54,155
Speaker 4:  anyhow. The tariffs are are paused. You let me

1550
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:57,180
Speaker 4:  know. There's a lot of updates. If you're out in the world, you let me, me

1551
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:58,140
Speaker 4:  know what the tariffs are doing.

1552
01:35:00,235 --> 01:35:03,125
Speaker 4:  It's gonna be a weird iPhone season. iPhone prices are gonna be crazy. It

1553
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:06,845
Speaker 4:  is because of these things. Yeah. All right. That's it. We've, we covered

1554
01:35:06,985 --> 01:35:10,605
Speaker 4:  as always. We went long. 'cause there it was a slow news week. This is what

1555
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:14,405
Speaker 4:  always happens to us. It's this fun. It was a good one. We're back next week

1556
01:35:14,405 --> 01:35:18,285
Speaker 4:  with much more WDC preview. Lots, lots of

1557
01:35:18,285 --> 01:35:20,205
Speaker 4:  stuff. It's The Verge everybody. It's gonna be great. Pay us
