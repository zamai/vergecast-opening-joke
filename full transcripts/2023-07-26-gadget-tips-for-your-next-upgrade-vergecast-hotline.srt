00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,200
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of answering machines.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,400
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I'm on vacation as you're listening to this.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,200
Speaker 2:  I'm probably in an Airbnb in the woods of

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,040
Speaker 2:  Pennsylvania pretending to read all of those books that I bought. But ultimately,

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,280
Speaker 2:  probably just scrolling through TikTok, watching videos of outtakes from

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,960
Speaker 2:  the office because that's what I end up doing on most of my vacation. And

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,720
Speaker 2:  honestly, no complaints. It's not a bad life vacation or no vacation, though

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,440
Speaker 2:  we still have a great show for you today. We've been really enjoying getting

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,880
Speaker 2:  to answer a question from the Vergecast hotline every week. But the truth

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,560
Speaker 2:  is we get so many good voicemails to just do one a week.

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,320
Speaker 2:  So today we're gonna do a whole bunch right in a row. We're gonna answer

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,800
Speaker 2:  your questions about iPhones and pixels and Threads and Instagram

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,240
Speaker 2:  Max and Windows Security cameras, and lots more. Turns out a lot of

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,440
Speaker 2:  people have buying questions, so we're gonna just tell you some stuff to

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,240
Speaker 2:  buy. As always, the Hotline number is 8 6 6 Verge one one,

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,680
Speaker 2:  my absolute favorite thing. And doing the Hotline is frankly my favorite

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,400
Speaker 2:  part of the show. Lots of Hotline coming up in just a second, but first I

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,720
Speaker 2:  gotta go watch more office bloopers. Have you seen the ones about the plasma

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,760
Speaker 2:  TV from the dinner party episodes where he's just pushing it into the wall?

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,440
Speaker 2:  It never ever fails to make me laugh. It's the greatest thing.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,920
Speaker 3:  I guess what surround sound means is that right over here. Tim,

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,560
Speaker 3:  check this out. Falls folds

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:37,960
Speaker 3:  the wall.

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,880
Speaker 2:  This is The Verge Cast. We'll see you in a sec.

28
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,310
Speaker 4:  Barbie has been around for almost 65 years, but Barbie's

29
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,150
Speaker 4:  aesthetic, you could argue it's been around even longer

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,670
Speaker 5:  When you kind of put up like a timeline of the history

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,470
Speaker 5:  of fashion Barbie. Coy has always kind of been there, we just

32
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,150
Speaker 5:  didn't call it that. Mm, And I. Think by the time you hit

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,070
Speaker 5:  like clueless superstars like Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,670
Speaker 5:  it, it became more of a a, a present

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,150
Speaker 4:  The enduring appeal of Barbie fashion. This week on

46
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,120
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the Hotline. Our first question might

47
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,800
Speaker 2:  be the wonkiest question we've gotten in a while. And. I. Love it. For that,

48
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,600
Speaker 2:  it comes from Clay in Cincinnati.

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,560
Speaker 7:  Hey Vergecast, this is Clay from Cincinnati. Last week I bought a pair of

50
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,880
Speaker 7:  Sony WF 1000 XM four headphones and

51
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,240
Speaker 7:  today I figured out that their LDAC audio codec is not enabled

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,800
Speaker 7:  by default. So I turned that on And I think there's an incredible difference.

53
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,560
Speaker 7:  So my question is, what's your all's favorite audio codec or

54
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,560
Speaker 7:  do you think that worrying about Codex is more? Hi-fi snake oil stuff.

55
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,960
Speaker 7:  Thanks a lot. Bye.

56
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,960
Speaker 2:  Okay, I brought in Chris Welch to answer this question. Chris, I assume you

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,720
Speaker 2:  know why you're here.

58
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,760
Speaker 8:  Yeah, love to talk audio codex. Oh man, there's a lot to unpack

59
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,000
Speaker 8:  there.

60
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,440
Speaker 2:  Okay, hit me with it.

61
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,000
Speaker 8:  Well, timing is everything. Clay, I hope you held onto your receipt because

62
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,360
Speaker 8:  by the time you hear this, Sony will have announced the new wf thousand x

63
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,440
Speaker 8:  m fives and you can read my review on the site. They're great.

64
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,800
Speaker 8:  They're not that different. They're a bit smaller, a bit lighter in your

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Speaker 8:  ears sounds a bit better. So if you can do an exchange, it's gonna be

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Speaker 8:  worth it. As far as the codex go, it's not snake oil, but people

67
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,280
Speaker 8:  spend way too much time worrying about this stuff. you know, like how your

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,960
Speaker 8:  headphones are tuned and like designed factors in just as much as like what

69
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,000
Speaker 8:  codex they have. But I do like Leck if you can turn it on so it can

70
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,040
Speaker 8:  hit 990 kilobits a second in theory, but most phones don't ever

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
Speaker 8:  do that. Like when you pair Sony headphones or earbuds with your phone, by

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,040
Speaker 8:  default it usually goes for like six 60 kilobits per second, which is still

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,600
Speaker 8:  better than like, you know, Spotify or whatever else. So if you've got

74
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,760
Speaker 8:  Apple Music or Amazon Music or Title or QO Buzz,

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
Speaker 8:  I never know how to pronounce that one.

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,880
Speaker 2:  That's not a real thing. I refuse to believe that's a real name you just

77
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,000
Speaker 2:  said.

78
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,040
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I swear it is. There's a very passionate community, they all serve

79
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,880
Speaker 8:  very high resolution audio. So if you pair that with an leck capable earbud,

80
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,560
Speaker 8:  there's aptex hd, same kind of thing, they can hit similar

81
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,240
Speaker 8:  bit rate and you can hear it different. Some people, not everybody, again,

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,080
Speaker 8:  it just kind of comes down to your ears. But if you had those earbuds, you

83
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,760
Speaker 8:  might as well use the feature and enjoy it and get the most from your purchase.

84
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,840
Speaker 8:  But yeah, I think we spend a lot of time just kind of worrying about the

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,480
Speaker 8:  ins and outs of, of these codecs too much these days.

86
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,560
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. So one thing I've always wondered is kind of where

87
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,640
Speaker 2:  on the ranking of important things the codec is, right? Because

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,240
Speaker 2:  obviously if you're gonna spend a lot of time worrying about your codec,

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,040
Speaker 2:  but you're gonna wear like AirPods that only halfway fit in your ear, like

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,920
Speaker 2:  you're, you're worrying about the wrong problem, right? Yeah. And if you're

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,800
Speaker 2:  buying a $15 pair of headphones at C V s and

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,080
Speaker 2:  you're worried about like the quality of the stuff coming from your streaming

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,760
Speaker 2:  service, you're also worried about the wrong problem. So kind of where along

94
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,240
Speaker 2:  the line should I start to worry about the codec? Like the very first thing

95
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,600
Speaker 2:  is the headphone quality, right? Like seems like worry about that before

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,080
Speaker 2:  you worry about anything else. The second thing would be basically like

97
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,080
Speaker 2:  quality of what your streaming service can theoretically provide,

98
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,920
Speaker 8:  Right? And if you have a Spotify, all this is still for N 'cause they still

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,680
Speaker 8:  don't even do lossless. We hear it's happening finally sometime soon. It'll

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,720
Speaker 8:  probably cost more money than it does now. So if you have Spotify, I wouldn't

101
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,400
Speaker 8:  worry about it period. But if you've got say Apple Music or Amazon Music,

102
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,320
Speaker 8:  then you can start to kind of factor that into your buying decision.

103
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,280
Speaker 8:  Okay, And I. Think it's also like budget. If you're spending below a hundred

104
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,920
Speaker 8:  dollars, I can't imagine like that it really matters that much Codex

105
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,840
Speaker 8:  versus if you spend like 200, $300 on a set of earbuds, you want to

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,720
Speaker 8:  know it checks all the boxes just because you're spending that amount of

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Speaker 8:  money. So why not?

108
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,880
Speaker 2:  That's fair. But at least in my experience, these Sonys are good enough that

109
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,640
Speaker 2:  our friend, I don't think this is pure placebo. I think to some extent you

110
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,560
Speaker 2:  turn on, like you flip the switch that says make the audio fancy and

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,360
Speaker 2:  you're definitely like primed to hear the fancy audio, right? Yeah. But I

112
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,320
Speaker 2:  think we have enough quality in those Sony headphones that they will do

113
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,200
Speaker 2:  enough of a different thing on the better codec that you might actually

114
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,760
Speaker 2:  notice it, right? This is not pure nonsense. Yeah.

115
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,120
Speaker 8:  No. Okay. Not at all. If you've got the ear for it, go for it.

116
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,880
Speaker 2:  What is the verdict on the m fives by the way? How do you feel about them?

117
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,520
Speaker 2:  Good.

118
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,640
Speaker 8:  They're not that different from the m fours, which I'm sure Clay will be

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,000
Speaker 8:  happy about if he's stuck with m fours. But they're lighter, smaller sounds

120
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,760
Speaker 8:  a bit nicer, slightly better at some noise cancellation on streets and like

121
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,480
Speaker 8:  voices and things like that. But there's no like new tent pole feature. They're

122
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,440
Speaker 8:  just a much sleeker version of the m fours. Alright

123
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,440
Speaker 2:  Clay, I hope that helps. Welch, before you go, I got an email this morning

124
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,920
Speaker 2:  that I did not tell you about, but I wanna read to you And. I want you to

125
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,560
Speaker 2:  respond to it because it makes me very happy. Okay. This email comes from

126
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,480
Speaker 2:  Matt in Switzerland. And, I'm, I'm gonna paraphrase because this is a very

127
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,320
Speaker 2:  long and very lovely email, but it takes a while. Basically our friend Matt

128
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,200
Speaker 2:  says this week I had to say goodbye to my great OLED four K tv. I it's,

129
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,120
Speaker 2:  it was one year old, I spent hours comparing and analyzing and

130
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Speaker 2:  then the cat jumped into the TV and destroyed it. So Matt says we are on

131
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,560
Speaker 2:  the market for a new tv. My boyfriend wants to prove to me he can do it.

132
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,200
Speaker 2:  It scares the hell out of me. I've heard him say Samsung several times. We

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,080
Speaker 2:  are already using Samsung for phones and watches, but dot Samsung

134
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,120
Speaker 2:  TV. Question mark And I would like to know your thoughts. Samsung TV question

135
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,360
Speaker 2:  mark.

136
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,600
Speaker 8:  Yeah, there are two ways to go with Samsung. I think people love the frame.

137
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,440
Speaker 8:  That's obviously this huge hit these days 'cause people don't like how headiest

138
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,520
Speaker 8:  TVs are most of the time. So if that's a concern, the frame is great. It's

139
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
Speaker 8:  gotten a lot better over the last few years. It's got a matte screen now

140
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,640
Speaker 8:  it looks like artwork on your wall. And then Samsung also makes some nice

141
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,680
Speaker 8:  ole TVs over the past couple years if you wanna spend a lot more money. Yeah,

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,920
Speaker 8:  in some ways they're better than lgs. Very sorry to hear about the fate of

143
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,840
Speaker 8:  your one year old ole. That's rough. Yeah.

144
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,760
Speaker 2:  What losing your one year old four K lead is a tough, tough

145
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,120
Speaker 2:  beat.

146
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,920
Speaker 8:  You buy it, you think I'm gonna have this for the next like decade at least.

147
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,160
Speaker 8:  And then oof Cats,

148
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,280
Speaker 2:  Do you have any tips on cat resistance for televisions?

149
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,560
Speaker 8:  Mount it? I guess I mean that's, yeah though cats are pretty nimble

150
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,600
Speaker 8:  so who knows? There's no there's no shore fire solution.

151
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. Just don't have cats. That's, that's my answer.

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think the Samsung answer seems to be, Samsung makes good TVs but

153
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,680
Speaker 2:  you probably are going to pay too much for them is kind of my, my read on

154
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,840
Speaker 2:  Samsung TVs most of the time

155
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,680
Speaker 8:  Cost a lot of money in the softwares, eh? So just plug in your

156
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
Speaker 8:  preferred streaming box and pay no mind to it.

157
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,360
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. All right Chris, thank you as always.

158
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,520
Speaker 8:  It's been a pleasure.

159
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,960
Speaker 2:  Next up, because I think every time we do this we have to talk about the

160
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,440
Speaker 2:  Apple watch at least somewhat. We have a question about the Apple watch from

161
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,280
Speaker 2:  Ben. Let's hear it.

162
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,040
Speaker 9:  Hi, my name is Ben and this is a question for V I'm training for my first

163
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,200
Speaker 9:  marathon and my five-year-old Garmin watch is getting long in the tooth.

164
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,680
Speaker 9:  I'm tempted to switch to an Apple watch but I'm concerned about battery life.

165
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,960
Speaker 9:  Can I get away with an Apple Watch series eight or would I need to go with

166
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,640
Speaker 9:  the ultra to go that route? Am I going to need to baby the battery life and

167
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,680
Speaker 9:  turn off useful features to get through a long run? Thank you very much.

168
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,160
Speaker 9:  Hope to hear from you soon. Bye.

169
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,440
Speaker 2:  Alright V song, our expert is here to answer this question. V i I assume

170
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
Speaker 2:  you're wearing all of these watches right now as we talk about this.

171
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,360
Speaker 10:  I I am wearing a Garmin And I am wearing the Apple Watch ultra. So I feel

172
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,200
Speaker 10:  qualified to answer this question but also congrats then

173
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,720
Speaker 10:  on training for your first marathon. Yeah, that is a huge

174
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,600
Speaker 10:  accomplishment You can get away with using the

175
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,440
Speaker 10:  series eight battery wise for an entire marathon.

176
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,520
Speaker 10:  You just are going to have to be a lot more mindful about charging

177
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,160
Speaker 10:  and charging schedule. So you are gonna have to go like oh before you go

178
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,760
Speaker 10:  on a run, make sure that's topped off and it has fast charging so that's

179
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,640
Speaker 10:  not bad for that. But it is a little annoying because

180
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,240
Speaker 10:  you do have to be more conscious of the battery if you do go for the eight

181
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,680
Speaker 10:  than you would be if you went for the Ultra. Do

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,320
Speaker 2:  You think it makes you run faster? Like is it, is this like a useful motivational

183
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,000
Speaker 2:  tactic where like I have to finish this race before my battery dies.

184
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,800
Speaker 2:  You get to mile 22, it's like got 15% left. Like it's go time

185
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,960
Speaker 10:  I think. I think if you're at mile 22 and you're bonking, you're just not

186
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,880
Speaker 10:  gonna give a crap about your watches battery. Like it, it might

187
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,880
Speaker 10:  actually be better if it does die on you because then you can be like, well

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,440
Speaker 10:  I have no idea how much time is left. I'm not gonna be just speaking from

189
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,280
Speaker 10:  personal experience. You're not gonna be going like, oh my God I only went

190
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,200
Speaker 10:  0.5 miles. Are you kidding me? Like oh my

191
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,400
Speaker 2:  God, I think the rule is you finish the marathon when your battery dies,

192
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,880
Speaker 2:  that's whatever, whatever the time was then that's your marathon time.

193
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,080
Speaker 2:  Congratulations. Yeah,

194
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,360
Speaker 10:  It also, I'm gonna say it depends on what carbon then is coming from.

195
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,240
Speaker 10:  Because if you are coming from a Phoenix or

196
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600
Speaker 10:  if you're coming from one of the really higher end forerunners,

197
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,960
Speaker 10:  I just think you're gonna have a more analogous experience if you do go

198
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,640
Speaker 10:  with the Ultra because the Ultra has, it just has more,

199
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,560
Speaker 10:  it's bulkier too, so you might just have that same comforting weight.

200
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,560
Speaker 10:  But in terms of just like the actual metrics you're gonna be getting, you

201
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,640
Speaker 10:  know the health and fitness app are basically the same for either watch.

202
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,640
Speaker 10:  It's just mostly that with the Ultra you are going to get better G

203
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,520
Speaker 10:  P s so if that matters to you then yeah you, you are gonna want that

204
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,360
Speaker 10:  because you have multi-band G P s which you know, all the higher end

205
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,120
Speaker 10:  garments are doing at the same time now. So yay great.

206
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,080
Speaker 10:  But the other thing I'm going to say is that there is a low power

207
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,160
Speaker 10:  mode and then there's an ultra ultra low power mode and so

208
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,480
Speaker 10:  you're not really gonna have to give things up if you decide to use low

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,440
Speaker 10:  power mode with the series eight just because it's all it's gonna

210
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,320
Speaker 10:  do is turn off your notifications, turn off all that stuff and

211
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,160
Speaker 10:  you don't want notifications in the middle of training anyway so it's fine,

212
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,360
Speaker 10:  it's just kind of gonna be a little more annoying 'cause it's not gonna

213
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,720
Speaker 10:  wake up quite as quickly and all of that stuff. But you are still going

214
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,360
Speaker 10:  to be getting continuous G P s and heart rate unless you go into the super

215
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,360
Speaker 10:  low power mode, in which case it's gonna take it less frequently. So that's

216
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,040
Speaker 10:  totally up to you. That's really more for ultra

217
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,280
Speaker 10:  marathoners, you know the super DC rainmakers of the world who are

218
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,080
Speaker 10:  just like make you feel real bad about yourself. You see their training

219
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,080
Speaker 10:  regimens, any Apple watch like base level Apple watch, it's gonna last you

220
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,880
Speaker 10:  a marathon provided that you're earning this marathon in like the six hour

221
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,920
Speaker 10:  range, six hour or less, which is most people like a fast marathon. A

222
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,760
Speaker 10:  fast marathon runner is gonna do sub four, which I think good, good

223
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,640
Speaker 10:  for you guys. I don't have that long capacity but yeah like my marathon

224
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,960
Speaker 10:  time, I haven't run one but my projected one according to Garmin is

225
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,480
Speaker 10:  like five hours, 45 or something like that.

226
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,200
Speaker 10:  Something obscene, And I have you know, friends who have run marathons with

227
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,160
Speaker 10:  Apple watches been totally fine. You just have to be more conscious of the

228
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,520
Speaker 10:  battery. So if that's not you, if you don't wanna baby it, if You don't

229
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,160
Speaker 10:  wanna think, don't wanna think too hard about the battery, go for the Ultra

230
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,040
Speaker 10:  I I I use the Ultra as my daily driver and in

231
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,360
Speaker 10:  running And I am, I'm a big fan of it so There you go.

232
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
Speaker 2:  I like it. I do think the low power mode thing is a good hack because

233
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,680
Speaker 2:  a, for the exact reasons you described it actually turns off a lot of things

234
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,920
Speaker 2:  you're gonna want off when you're running anyway. Yeah like this is true

235
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,440
Speaker 2:  on the iPhone as well. It's actually a pretty good sort of quick

236
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,920
Speaker 2:  make my phone bother me less button 'cause it just turns down a lot

237
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,960
Speaker 2:  of background processing. It doesn't pull for notifications as often. It

238
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,920
Speaker 2:  doesn't ping your email as often. It just sort of calms your device down

239
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,640
Speaker 2:  a little bit and that's useful both on the phone and the watch And it at

240
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,320
Speaker 2:  least in my experience purely anecdotally does a ton for battery life.

241
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,720
Speaker 2:  So that's a big win.

242
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,800
Speaker 10:  And you know like how EVs have range anxiety, Smartwatches marathons

243
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,720
Speaker 10:  have battery anxiety when you are doing continuous G P s

244
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,320
Speaker 10:  exercise. So if that really is a concern, I am gonna say the Ultra's gonna

245
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,200
Speaker 10:  give you a good time. 'cause I ran a half marathon in

246
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,360
Speaker 10:  very slow three hours it was, it was not my best half

247
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,800
Speaker 10:  marathon time but I only lost

248
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,880
Speaker 10:  15% battery. Not on low power mode. Nothing,

249
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,680
Speaker 10:  nothing done. So wow I only lost 15%. It was the whole 13

250
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,600
Speaker 10:  miles. So take what you will from that. You just won't have to

251
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Speaker 10:  think about it, you won't have to worry. So if it's quote unquote just

252
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,760
Speaker 10:  a marathon either will be fine but the Ultra will

253
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,000
Speaker 10:  alleviate that concern for you a lot more confidently.

254
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,400
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. And the, the other thing I'm wondering is the, this switch

255
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,000
Speaker 2:  from, I've been using Garmin for a while, I'm make thinking about making

256
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,320
Speaker 2:  the switch to Apple Watch. What do we think about this idea? Good idea, bad

257
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,040
Speaker 2:  idea. I feel like if our friend Ben was calling and saying I run marathons

258
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,400
Speaker 2:  every weekend, I'm thinking about making the switch. I feel like I would

259
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,400
Speaker 2:  actually try to talk him out of switching to the Apple Watch.

260
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,520
Speaker 10:  I, I would like, so the main question I have for Ben

261
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,920
Speaker 10:  to think about is how much do you want the smart features because

262
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,360
Speaker 10:  Garmin, it has a better training platform. It's

263
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,760
Speaker 10:  very information dense. Do you need all that information? No. Even the professionals

264
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,720
Speaker 10:  don't need everything that garment is going to get you. But it is

265
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,880
Speaker 10:  a lot more comprehensive. I find that the daily suggestive workouts

266
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,080
Speaker 10:  on the garments that I test, they, I find them really helpful 'cause I'm

267
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,840
Speaker 10:  like, oh crap, I don't know what to train for. Oh you're telling me to do,

268
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,960
Speaker 10:  you're telling me to do 31 minutes at a slower pace base. Base pace,

269
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,720
Speaker 10:  cool, great. And it helps you kind of track your recovery a lot more

270
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,960
Speaker 10:  effectively than an Apple Watch will an Apple watch. You have to be more

271
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,200
Speaker 10:  hands on with your training, which may be something that you want. The data

272
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,520
Speaker 10:  is gonna be a lot more streamlined, which I find helpful.

273
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,240
Speaker 10:  Like what's not helpful is me saying that I think the best of both worlds

274
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,600
Speaker 10:  is to use both and string with both of them at the same time.

275
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,640
Speaker 10:  But yeah, if you are super hardcore into the data, the Garmin is gonna be

276
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,280
Speaker 10:  better for you. But if you want apps that work, if you want

277
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,480
Speaker 10:  better connectivity with your phone, if you want greater control over what

278
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,040
Speaker 10:  notifications are going to annoy you all day, then the Apple Watch does

279
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,040
Speaker 10:  make a lot of sense and is the smarter choice because the, the number of

280
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,800
Speaker 10:  notifications I get on this Garmin that do not matter, it's

281
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,920
Speaker 10:  it's very high. It's very high. Do you want a smart experience then yes

282
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,600
Speaker 10:  this makes sense. But if you want the fitness first experience, the Ultra

283
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,000
Speaker 10:  is great. It's just not gonna be as who raw

284
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,880
Speaker 10:  as the Garmin And I know people who are making the switch in both directions

285
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,200
Speaker 10:  going from Apple to Garmin super happy and then going from Garmin to Apple

286
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,480
Speaker 10:  super happy. So it's just a matter of what your priority is.

287
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah, they do, they do land in surprisingly different places.

288
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,720
Speaker 2:  It's like the, the Garmin is better for the things that it does, but the

289
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,440
Speaker 2:  Apple Watch does more things. Yeah, right. Like it's, it's a pretty, and

290
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,840
Speaker 2:  the thing is it seems to be mostly self-selecting. So I feel like Ben, if

291
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,680
Speaker 2:  you know you want an Apple watch, totally cool lean in. But

292
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,760
Speaker 2:  also garments are very good also. V before we go, I just want you to know

293
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,480
Speaker 2:  that Buzz Aldrin tweeted a picture of himself the other day on the

294
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,600
Speaker 2:  54th I think anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch day. And

295
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,160
Speaker 2:  he's sitting there eating a plate of steak and eggs and he has three watches

296
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,920
Speaker 2:  on. Oh and all I could think literally my first

297
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,880
Speaker 2:  immediate thought upon looking at this picture was v's probably wearing four

298
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,560
Speaker 2:  watches. I just want you to know this is, this is your legacy V congratulations.

299
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:34,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

300
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,400
Speaker 10:  Double wristing, double watch hands. That's how you know I'm, I'm the real

301
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
Speaker 10:  deal. Double watch stands year round. There we go.

302
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,960
Speaker 2:  It's, it's a life. All right, well Ben, let us know how the marathon goes.

303
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,160
Speaker 2:  Good luck with the training V. Thank you.

304
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,840
Speaker 10:  Thank you. Bye.

305
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,720
Speaker 2:  Next up we have a question that has actually made me think a

306
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,360
Speaker 2:  lot of things and feel a lot of feelings over the last few days. It's from

307
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,240
Speaker 2:  Dave, who I promise is not me throwing my voice. Let's hear it.

308
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,000
Speaker 11:  Hey, so I'm a dad now you can call me Dave. My

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,840
Speaker 11:  family budget's pretty tight. Food has gotten very expensive. I've always

310
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,720
Speaker 11:  wanted the latest and greatest but I've been rocking an iPhone 12 pro

311
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,760
Speaker 11:  for a couple years now and it's great the

312
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,640
Speaker 11:  battery needs to be replaced. But anyway, I'm debating about whether to

313
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,600
Speaker 11:  just get like a free iPhone 14 and get the 15

314
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,440
Speaker 11:  and have payments and all of that. And I'm really feeling like

315
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,120
Speaker 11:  there's a pretty significant argument to be made for getting a free iPhone

316
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,840
Speaker 11:  14 except you know, the 36 months of waiting

317
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,080
Speaker 11:  and what happens after that. So I don't know, I would love

318
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,920
Speaker 11:  the for to spend.

319
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,880
Speaker 2:  All right Alison Johnson, welcome to the show. Thank you. You can

320
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,960
Speaker 2:  just feel what, what Dave is going through here, right? Yes. Like there's

321
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
Speaker 2:  a lot of emotions wrapped up in this decision. I've been thinking a lot about

322
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,080
Speaker 2:  this And I have come to, I have a pretty strong opinion on the right answer

323
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,040
Speaker 2:  here, but before I rant and rave about what I think Dave should do,

324
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,200
Speaker 2:  I want to know what you think is the right answer here.

325
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,200
Speaker 12:  Yeah, this is a tough one. I do see the argument for the

326
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,760
Speaker 12:  free 14, especially a 14 pro.

327
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,040
Speaker 12:  The way I see the 15 and the 15 pro is kind of,

328
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,200
Speaker 12:  you know, based on the rumors, like the regular 15 is just kind of

329
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,040
Speaker 12:  getting in line with what the 14 pro offers. What it

330
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,920
Speaker 12:  sounds like we're gonna get the higher resolution camera dynamic

331
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,640
Speaker 12:  island. You're not gonna get like a nicer screen, but that's Apple. And

332
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,240
Speaker 12:  then the 15 pro it sounds like is gonna be more fancy things.

333
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,280
Speaker 12:  Telephoto Periscope camera,

334
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,760
Speaker 2:  Potentially U S B C

335
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,080
Speaker 12:  U S B C. That is the big exciting one. Dave already

336
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,320
Speaker 12:  has some lightning cables around so you know,

337
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,040
Speaker 12:  probably that's a, a wash. But yeah, I, I kind of went back and

338
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,880
Speaker 12:  forth. I think a free 14 pro would be

339
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,000
Speaker 12:  a smart move. It all just depends on what carrier deal

340
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,240
Speaker 12:  you can find. You are gonna sell your soul to your carrier either way.

341
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,800
Speaker 12:  So yes, I'm curious what, what your answer is.

342
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,800
Speaker 2:  So my stock phone buying advice is

343
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,360
Speaker 2:  buy the best phone you can possibly afford and keep it as long as you possibly

344
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,280
Speaker 2:  can. Right. So by that advice the answer is wait for

345
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,120
Speaker 2:  the 15, right? We've hit the point of the year where anyone who's like, what

346
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,720
Speaker 2:  phone should I buy? I say none wait until September. Right? Because there

347
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,120
Speaker 2:  will be, there will be new Samsung phones, there will be new iPhones. You

348
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,840
Speaker 2:  can make a much more rational and informed decision

349
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,800
Speaker 2:  at like the end of October about the whole phone landscape. If you know you

350
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,480
Speaker 2:  want an iPhone wait until mid-September they'll come out, there'll be a new

351
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,800
Speaker 2:  iPhone by that one. And especially now I feel like the normal

352
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,920
Speaker 2:  age I would expect a phone to be is probably like four years. I think if

353
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,440
Speaker 2:  you've had a phone for four years, years, you can consider that phone to

354
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,960
Speaker 2:  have like lived its best life time to upgrade by the best phone you can and

355
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,160
Speaker 2:  plan to have it for four more years. That said, I believe

356
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,560
Speaker 2:  firmly and strongly that the correct thing to do is get a free iPhone 14.

357
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah A because it clearly sounds like money is an object and a free

358
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
Speaker 2:  iPhone 14 is going to be a terrific phone that probably will still last you

359
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
Speaker 2:  four years. But B, I think this U S B C

360
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,360
Speaker 2:  transition is gonna take a while. I think back to when we all went away from

361
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,200
Speaker 2:  like the 30 pin ports in the iPhone that took a while, everybody

362
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,000
Speaker 2:  had docks. There was all this stuff in like the hotels going to

363
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,320
Speaker 2:  Lightning was annoying for a couple of years and you had to have dongles

364
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,040
Speaker 2:  and you had to buy all kinds of new stuff and eventually the world transitions

365
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,960
Speaker 2:  and it works. I kind of don't want to be at the very front of

366
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,760
Speaker 2:  that change if I don't have to be you. And I will be because this is

367
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,080
Speaker 2:  what we do for a living and we're like phone sickos. But for most people,

368
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,120
Speaker 2:  like you have cables, you might have a doc like your phone probably

369
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,080
Speaker 2:  connects via a certain cable to your car and lots of

370
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,640
Speaker 2:  other things. And I think actually the next phone

371
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,640
Speaker 2:  a after this one that you buy this year is gonna be the one you wanna try

372
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,760
Speaker 2:  a bunch of new stuff with. And granted there might be things in the iPhone

373
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,120
Speaker 2:  15 that we don't know about that are amazing and cool and blow everybody's

374
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,040
Speaker 2:  minds. But rumors that I've seen about the pro are basically like new chip

375
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,120
Speaker 2:  titanium frame, which could look cool. There might be an action button

376
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,960
Speaker 2:  like on the Watch Ultra, which I'm very excited about. But the U S B C port

377
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,920
Speaker 2:  is the thing, right? Like that's gonna be the big shift and that strikes

378
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,440
Speaker 2:  me as something to actually be a couple of years late on instead of being

379
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,440
Speaker 2:  super early. So I've come down really aggressively on the get the

380
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,760
Speaker 2:  free iPhone 14 and be very happy with it for a while inside of this.

381
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,240
Speaker 12:  I like that. Yeah. And you may have the right cables for

382
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,040
Speaker 12:  your phone, but like what are you gonna encounter in the rest of the world?

383
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,920
Speaker 12:  So yeah, let the dust settle on U S P C for a little bit,

384
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,280
Speaker 12:  you know, get that good carrier deal for the 14 pro I

385
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,440
Speaker 12:  traded in my iPhone 11 for a 13 mini this year. so

386
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,400
Speaker 12:  like I'm all for getting an an older iPhone and just like

387
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,440
Speaker 12:  coasting as long as you can get your money towards it.

388
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,600
Speaker 2:  Just my, my only real advice is don't buy an iPhone mini. That's like whatever

389
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,560
Speaker 2:  you do, do not buy an iPhone mini,

390
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,680
Speaker 12:  Don't be a sicko like me for small phones. R i p

391
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,360
Speaker 12:  Battery life.

392
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,720
Speaker 2:  If you want a phone that's gonna last a few years, don't buy the one with

393
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,320
Speaker 2:  the tiniest battery and worst processor of the punch.

394
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,440
Speaker 12:  But it's so wonderful.

395
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,680
Speaker 2:  I know it does. It just fits, it fits nicely in your hands. It's

396
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,600
Speaker 12:  In my, it fits in my pocket, but yeah, it's settled. Get a free

397
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,040
Speaker 12:  14.

398
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,200
Speaker 2:  There we go. Done. And it is true, I will say if you want a 15

399
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,000
Speaker 2:  wait until like, what would you say early

400
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,520
Speaker 2:  20, 24 and all this stuff starts going on crazy sales anyway. Yeah. And

401
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,480
Speaker 2:  there's a decent chance that whatever free offer you're getting

402
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Speaker 2:  now for the 14, you'll probably get for the 15 at some point. Yeah. So if

403
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,560
Speaker 2:  you can, if you can hold off and really want the 15, but price is the question,

404
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,400
Speaker 2:  would he say wait nine months if you can and you'll probably get it.

405
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Speaker 12:  Yeah. Yeah. I would say hold off, like if the battery's holding up, just

406
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,160
Speaker 12:  keep an eye out for the deals. Hold onto it as long as you can.

407
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,400
Speaker 12:  I think the, the deal I got on the 13 through Verizon

408
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,240
Speaker 12:  was like halfway through this year they just sort of were like,

409
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,680
Speaker 12:  wow, we have these phones. You might, you guys might as well have a free

410
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,240
Speaker 12:  one, so hold on.

411
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I like it. All right Allison, thank you. Let's take a break

412
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,880
Speaker 2:  and then we're get get some more questions.

413
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,390
Speaker 13:  Hi everyone, this is Kara Swisher. And I. Just interviewed Fran Drescher,

414
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,670
Speaker 13:  a K a, the nanny or more Pertinently the president of SAG

415
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,470
Speaker 13:  aftra, which is the actor's union that's on strike. I think you'll wanna

416
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,870
Speaker 13:  hear it. She's got a lot to say. Here's a taste.

417
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,390
Speaker 14:  We stand at a time when

418
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,830
Speaker 14:  big business feels like it's

419
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,110
Speaker 14:  okay to marginalized

420
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,950
Speaker 14:  people and systematically squeeze them

421
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,070
Speaker 14:  out of their livelihood while those at the

444
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,370
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back more Hotline questions. We have a couple on

445
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,810
Speaker 2:  Threads because everyone wants to talk about Threads. Neli Patel is here

446
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,890
Speaker 2:  to talk about Threads. Hi Neli. Hey, I love talking about Threads. You're

447
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,410
Speaker 2:  my, you're my Threads guy. This is, this is what we do. So we, we got two

448
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,210
Speaker 2:  emails that are both about Threads, And, I, wanna talk about 'em. So the

449
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,050
Speaker 2:  first one is from Steven. It says the honeymoon phase of Threads will be

450
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,970
Speaker 2:  over soon enough and ads are inevitable. So I ask do you think Threads would

451
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,370
Speaker 2:  do a plus subscription where we pay two to $3 a month to go ad free

452
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,680
Speaker 2:  to sweeten the deal? Threads Plus could also give us extended time to edit

453
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,080
Speaker 2:  more pins and the ability to schedule Threads and masterly slash archive

454
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,320
Speaker 2:  them. Your thoughts please. Basically the question here is like Threads blue

455
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,160
Speaker 2:  question mark

456
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,240
Speaker 15:  Twitter Blue has ads, right? I

457
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:54,800
Speaker 2:  True.

458
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,280
Speaker 15:  A huge part of the problem for all these companies is they make so much

459
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,160
Speaker 15:  money on ads that paying money to go ad free almost never

460
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Speaker 15:  makes economic sense. But paying money to see slightly fewer ads makes a

461
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,080
Speaker 15:  lot of sense, right?

462
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,200
Speaker 2:  I do think you'd have to pay more than you think, generally speaking to not

463
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,240
Speaker 2:  see ads on the internet.

464
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,040
Speaker 15:  Well it's a weird problem. So the answer to your question Steven,

465
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,720
Speaker 15:  is yes, but not ad free. Yeah, meta is already doing paid

466
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,560
Speaker 15:  verification on Instagram. You can see how they might just extend it

467
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,600
Speaker 15:  and put some features behind a paywall. And I think all these companies

468
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,360
Speaker 15:  are interested in revenue and if they can actually make thread successful,

469
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,200
Speaker 15:  I think Meta is better at saying, Hey, pay us money for features than Elon

470
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,880
Speaker 15:  Musk and Twitter are at this moment in time. But there's just a weird

471
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,680
Speaker 15:  problem in the business model where ad targeting works If you can target

472
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,160
Speaker 15:  someone who's likely to buy something and they're hard to reach, right?

473
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,440
Speaker 15:  That's what sets your ad price. So if you have ads for everybody,

474
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,760
Speaker 15:  that's great. You have a lot of people you're, you're likely to hit who

475
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,240
Speaker 15:  you wanna reach. If you let some people turn off ads, you're letting the

476
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,680
Speaker 15:  people with the most money turn off ads 'cause that's who's gonna pay the

477
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,600
Speaker 15:  money. So you, you like reduce the pool of your ads if you let the people

478
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,600
Speaker 15:  pay money to see slightly fewer ads, you've reduced supply and the price

479
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,560
Speaker 15:  of those ads goes up. So there's just a weird problem in the

480
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,880
Speaker 15:  pricing curve where getting to add free doesn't make any sense, but getting

481
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,440
Speaker 15:  to add light makes a lot of sense. And I bet one of these social networks

482
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,280
Speaker 15:  is gonna figure that out soon.

483
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,160
Speaker 2:  That's really interesting. It also seems like, I feel like there's a weird

484
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,000
Speaker 2:  thing that happens when you get rid of ads or let people pay to get rid of

485
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,920
Speaker 2:  ads where you're sort of tacitly acknowledging that ads are worse than no

486
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,960
Speaker 2:  ads And, I think Meta in particular goes way out of its

487
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,840
Speaker 2:  way to never acknowledge that ads are bad, right? Like it is, it is a foundational

488
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,320
Speaker 2:  belief of that company that ads are good. Yeah. And so I think even the idea

489
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,120
Speaker 2:  of letting you do that and sort of pay for the privilege sends

490
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,360
Speaker 2:  messages that company does not wanna send.

491
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,560
Speaker 15:  Also truly given how Threads is right now, what is an ad free Threads, even

492
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,520
Speaker 15:  me, it's like the brands are there, man. That's true.

493
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,920
Speaker 15:  The commercial messaging is happening there. It's like it's down to whether

494
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,400
Speaker 15:  it can be, you can pay money to target it. Better not right? Whether it's

495
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,760
Speaker 15:  there at all.

496
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,360
Speaker 2:  Can the Nugget account pay money to have even more posts in my feed?

497
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Speaker 15:  Yeah, exactly. Alright,

498
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,560
Speaker 2:  Next one. This email is from Dewey. Dewey says, I find it endlessly

499
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,800
Speaker 2:  fascinating that Threads is a project helmed by a subsection of the Instagram

500
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,480
Speaker 2:  team. Moser, rather than having it be overseen by any other team at Meta

501
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,840
Speaker 2:  or their own product team. Any ideas why it's a product overseen by Instagram

502
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,120
Speaker 2:  and not Facebook or Messenger? I assume it can't be its own team yet because

503
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,200
Speaker 2:  it's still unproven. Do you think that would change if it actually does become

504
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Speaker 2:  a Twitter killer or will it always be under threat of being absorbed in Instagram?

505
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,680
Speaker 15:  That's a lot. That's a, that's like a good decoder question just from a

506
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,800
Speaker 15:  jump. It's just an org chart question. Yeah. You can also ask why isn't

507
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,880
Speaker 15:  it part of Facebook, the combination of Instagram and Threads right now,

508
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,080
Speaker 15:  now is the Facebook newsfeed.

509
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it really is

510
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,880
Speaker 15:  And and it is just like kind of funny that they've, they've split it apart

511
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
Speaker 15:  and made two products instead of Instagram that recapitulates the original

512
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,400
Speaker 15:  product. Yeah, here's what I'll say I, it's part of Instagram because the

513
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,120
Speaker 15:  code base of Threads itself is Instagram, right? So if you look at the version

514
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,760
Speaker 15:  number of the Threads app, I think it's like 2 91 or something and

515
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,720
Speaker 15:  Instagram is at 290. Hmm. It's some number like that don't, the exact number

516
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,040
Speaker 15:  might be wrong, but it's, it's some increment of the Instagram version number

517
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,120
Speaker 15:  because the all underlying code base is Instagram then I think it's a

518
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,760
Speaker 15:  small team inside of Instagram because that's where you can insulate it.

519
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,920
Speaker 15:  If you made it its own team, it would have to sync or swim without

520
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,880
Speaker 15:  the resources of the larger thing. And I think Instagram is where

521
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
Speaker 15:  the kids are. Instagram doesn't already have it text posting

522
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,560
Speaker 15:  feature in this way. If you made it part of Facebook, people will be like,

523
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,880
Speaker 15:  I can already post a Facebook. You make it part of Instagram, you get the

524
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,680
Speaker 15:  cooler younger brand and you're adding what feels like a new

525
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,160
Speaker 15:  feature to celebrities who are already using that product in that way.

526
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,400
Speaker 15:  And, I think fundamentally you want, you want that team to be as focused

527
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,280
Speaker 15:  on the product itself and not is this a business? Do we have to

528
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,840
Speaker 15:  add all these other features to make it a business? You're just take what

529
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,800
Speaker 15:  you need from Instagram and and start from there is a much smarter decision.

530
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,360
Speaker 15:  I

531
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,880
Speaker 2:  Also think if you're gonna pick a meta social graph to start with,

532
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,880
Speaker 2:  Instagram is the right one. And we've talked about this on the show, right?

533
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,240
Speaker 2:  But I think my Facebook account is just like a

534
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,000
Speaker 2:  morass of people I haven't talked to in a decade because that's kind of when

535
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,800
Speaker 2:  I stopped using Facebook. But people still sort of actively

536
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,520
Speaker 2:  engage with their Instagram graph in a way that I think a lot of people don't

537
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,200
Speaker 2:  on Facebook, And I don't have data to back this up. But it certainly feels

538
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,760
Speaker 2:  true that if you just wanted to pick a list of people

539
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,880
Speaker 2:  and things and brands, I'm likely to find interesting betting on Instagram

540
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,360
Speaker 2:  as that sort of startup moment is much smarter than betting on Facebook.

541
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,280
Speaker 2:  And I suspect that's true for most of the people. Instagram and Meta would

542
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,960
Speaker 2:  like to have on Threads at this moment.

543
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,920
Speaker 15:  Yeah, Instagram and Twitter for that matter are one to many

544
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,840
Speaker 15:  broadcast, right? You are LeBron James, right. And people follow

545
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,320
Speaker 15:  you. That's true. Yeah. And that's it. Like there's no

546
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,600
Speaker 15:  reciprocal following and Facebook is all supposed to be all about your friends,

547
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,120
Speaker 15:  right? And so you, yeah, you already have that graph and you already have

548
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,960
Speaker 15:  that user behavior that's like, here is where celebrities and brands will

549
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,400
Speaker 15:  talk to me, which is what happens on Instagram.

550
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,720
Speaker 2:  I will say if it hits you know, a billion users, this team will get much

551
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,680
Speaker 2:  bigger and it will probably separate from Instagram in some meaningful way.

552
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,640
Speaker 2:  But I, I suspect that's an org chart thing more than anything. Like most

553
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,760
Speaker 2:  people will notice over time.

554
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,600
Speaker 15:  Yeah I don't know. you know, it's their first from the ground up social

555
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,040
Speaker 15:  network that is successful in quite some time. Yeah. And I since

556
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:23,800
Speaker 2:  Facebook

557
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,240
Speaker 15:  And I think the fact that it's part of Instagram

558
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,120
Speaker 15:  means that Instagram stays relevant, which is a very important to Facebook.

559
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,920
Speaker 15:  Like what, what, what you don't wanna do is like let billion user social

560
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,520
Speaker 15:  networks quietly die over time. Right? You wanna keep them them alive and

561
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,560
Speaker 15:  keep them relevant and Instagram is the one that has been the most relevant

562
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,680
Speaker 15:  for the longest time next to YouTube.

563
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,280
Speaker 2:  So reels are coming to Threads sometime soon.

564
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,600
Speaker 15:  There's gonna be, I think there, I think they'll get closer together rather

565
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,280
Speaker 15:  than farther apart.

566
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah, fair enough. Alright Neli, thank you. Let's get some more questions.

567
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,680
Speaker 2:  Our next question is an email and it comes from, I

568
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,960
Speaker 2:  believe it's pronounced Ade, I'm sorry if I get this wrong. Jen Tui back

569
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,880
Speaker 2:  from vacation. Welcome back to The Vergecast.

570
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,440
Speaker 16:  Hello. Always happy to be here. Best way to restart my working week.

571
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,200
Speaker 2:  There you go. Let me read you this email because I actually think this is

572
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,120
Speaker 2:  a really interesting one and matches a question you And I have talked

573
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,520
Speaker 2:  a little bit about on this show before, but let's just get into it. So the

574
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,040
Speaker 2:  email says I'm in the process of buying a few indoor Security cameras for

575
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,360
Speaker 2:  my home. Nothing too fancy, mostly just for when I'm on holiday or have the

576
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Speaker 2:  cleaning lady come by, which I actually argued by the way is like the perfect

577
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,960
Speaker 2:  way to describe what an in-home security camera should before anyway.

578
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,200
Speaker 2:  As you can imagine this feels a lot like inviting someone into your home.

579
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,920
Speaker 2:  So choosing a brand can be difficult. I have to mention I'm from Europe,

580
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,640
Speaker 2:  so some of the US brands, albeit with seemingly good offers, sadly lack the

581
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,320
Speaker 2:  app support here. Do you have any clear suggestions? I'm mostly concerned

582
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,040
Speaker 2:  on the privacy slash security front then Tai has a bunch more

583
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,480
Speaker 2:  questions about UFI and Xmi in particular. But

584
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,800
Speaker 2:  I think the big question here is like if I'm coming at the camera question

585
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,600
Speaker 2:  from security first, what should I do? What do you think?

586
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,000
Speaker 16:  Yeah, well And I can relate to this question because having just come back

587
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,600
Speaker 16:  from vacation, I did set up a few cameras before I left because

588
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,360
Speaker 16:  normally my recommendation is not to put Security cameras

589
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,280
Speaker 16:  inside your house. Personally, I feel like they're great on the outside,

590
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,320
Speaker 16:  but inside can get a bit dubious unless you follow a

591
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,240
Speaker 16:  few practices and be concerned here about privacy and security.

592
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,480
Speaker 16:  So that the good thing is there are a lot of solutions to this particular

593
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,720
Speaker 16:  problem. The straightforward answer about security and remember, so there's

594
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,960
Speaker 16:  two sides here. There's the privacy and there's the security. Now the security

595
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,320
Speaker 16:  very much focused on which company you buy from. Do you trust

596
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,560
Speaker 16:  their security practices, you know, high profile, well-known

597
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,320
Speaker 16:  companies. Ones that are going are the ones that are under a lot of SEC

598
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,080
Speaker 16:  secure scrutiny. So generally I think you can feel quite

599
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,240
Speaker 16:  comfortable buying from a well-known company.

600
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,320
Speaker 2:  So are you talking about like the, the Apples and Rings and

601
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,120
Speaker 2:  Googles of the world, like the simply safe kind of folks, right?

602
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,240
Speaker 16:  You know, and for Europe in particular, you've got, I think most it's,

603
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,320
Speaker 16:  it's interesting that he said that there were a few that he couldn't go

604
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,240
Speaker 16:  for from America because he's in Europe. A lot of the big security

605
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,400
Speaker 16:  companies, camera companies do come, you can get in both countries. So rings

606
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,040
Speaker 16:  available in both TP links, brands, TAPO and Cassa

607
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,240
Speaker 16:  are available in both Arlo, Google Nest. So you've got a

608
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,040
Speaker 16:  pretty broad option and then you've got UFI and there's also a Cara

609
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,880
Speaker 16:  which is one of the Xmi brands. So there are a lot of good options

610
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,840
Speaker 16:  here. And I would say any of these you know that are from well-known companies,

611
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,800
Speaker 16:  do not go and buy a no-name brand of Amazon for $20 or

612
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,760
Speaker 16:  20 pounds or 20 euros and stick it in your house. That's just not a

613
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,000
Speaker 16:  good idea. But you know, there's a few key things you should look for. You

614
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,560
Speaker 16:  want to always look for a a camera that has two factor of authentication

615
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,000
Speaker 16:  so that if there is any social engineering or hacking or anything

616
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,640
Speaker 16:  going on that you know someone's trying to get into your camera feed, you're

617
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,160
Speaker 16:  getting, you're gonna get an alert or a warning. So that's you know, key.

618
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,360
Speaker 16:  But then the other thing is end-to-end encryption. Especially if you are

619
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,080
Speaker 16:  concerned about the potential for a company to

620
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,640
Speaker 16:  view your videos. Obviously this is one of the big issues that has been

621
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,640
Speaker 16:  around Ring and also Google with the police

622
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,440
Speaker 16:  partnerships and the potential for you know, your footage to be

623
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,280
Speaker 16:  subpoenaed. If that's something that concerns you, end-to-end encryption

624
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,280
Speaker 16:  is something else. You definitely wanna look for security as a whole

625
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,240
Speaker 16:  though. I mean These big companies have security researchers, you know,

626
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,560
Speaker 16:  banging on their doors trying to figure out holes and they should, you know,

627
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,520
Speaker 16:  and fix and patch and that's why if you do get a security camera, always

628
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,000
Speaker 16:  update your firmware, you know whenever there's an option. And most cameras

629
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,920
Speaker 16:  nowadays will have the option to turn on automatic updates so you don't

630
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,720
Speaker 16:  even have to worry about it, it'll just keep updating in the background.

631
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,200
Speaker 16:  But from from a European perspective. And if you want a smart security

632
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,960
Speaker 16:  camera that is entirely private and you know local

633
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,560
Speaker 16:  doesn't go to the cloud 'cause that's kind of the cloud is where you start

634
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,920
Speaker 16:  to enter that attack vector because your data is being streamed

635
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,040
Speaker 16:  outside of your home. There is one really good company that

636
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,720
Speaker 16:  I would recommend, which is Netatmo. Their kind of focus is

637
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,000
Speaker 16:  entirely on privacy and security. There is no cloud involved

638
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,600
Speaker 16:  whatsoever. It's all done locally. It's all processed locally on the device.

639
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,920
Speaker 16:  It is not, does not have as many of the bells and whistles as some of the

640
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,360
Speaker 16:  other cameras might have and it's not as high resolution, it's a slightly

641
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,640
Speaker 16:  older camera. But if all you're interested in is checking on your cleaning

642
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,240
Speaker 16:  lady and the potential of someone coming into your house when you are not

643
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,520
Speaker 16:  there, it's a great, it's got a great feature, it has facial

644
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,440
Speaker 16:  recognition and you can set it so that it will only record if it's

645
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,360
Speaker 16:  sees someone it doesn't know. So it's on all the time, but it will only

646
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,800
Speaker 16:  record when it sees someone it doesn't know or you can set it to only record

647
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,880
Speaker 16:  if it sees your cleaning lady so that it does record your cleaning lady

648
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,480
Speaker 16:  though if you want to record your cleaning lady, you might need to have

649
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,160
Speaker 16:  a conversation with her.

650
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,640
Speaker 2:  Yes, tell your cleaning lady. Yes.

651
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,840
Speaker 16:  So I mean I, and you can also use your own, you can use cloud with

652
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,760
Speaker 16:  an attack mode but it's your own cloud so you can upload to Dropbox or

653
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,720
Speaker 16:  an F T P server or iCloud. It does support HomeKit

654
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,640
Speaker 16:  secure video which would be my next suggestion here. HomeKit

655
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,440
Speaker 16:  Secure video is one option that gives you a cloud, gives you

656
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,600
Speaker 16:  some of the features of cloud video recording but is

657
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,760
Speaker 16:  end-to-end encrypted because all of the device, all of the data that

658
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,520
Speaker 16:  needs to be processed in the cloud, that's why a lot of camera companies

659
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,400
Speaker 16:  send their data to the cloud. So for people recognition or to

660
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,240
Speaker 16:  tell you whether it's a dog or a plastic bag that's caused a

661
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,840
Speaker 16:  emotion alert on your camera with Apple Home Kit secure video that's all

662
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,760
Speaker 16:  processed on your Apple Home Hub. So it's all processed in your home, not

663
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,280
Speaker 16:  in the cloud but you need an iPhone for that. So if You don't have an iPhone

664
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,200
Speaker 16:  home kit, secure video's not not gonna work for you. But Home Kit Secure

665
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,600
Speaker 16:  video does work with a number of different manufacturers including

666
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,280
Speaker 16:  Logitech has a camera, UFI has some cameras that a HomeKit secure

667
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,760
Speaker 16:  video and also a car which is the z AMI brand

668
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,240
Speaker 16:  Eve and Netatmo. So there's quite a few options there.

669
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,720
Speaker 16:  Overall though I think if you are really concerned about

670
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,520
Speaker 16:  security and privacy you want to record locally, that's the thing to look

671
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,200
Speaker 16:  for. So if none of those brands kind of float your boat, there are a lot

672
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,400
Speaker 16:  of brands that you can just record to a micro SSD card on the camera

673
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,920
Speaker 16:  and a Cara is one that has that option. Tapo and Ca Casa

674
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,080
Speaker 16:  also you can do that Google Nest and Ring. There is some local

675
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,560
Speaker 16:  element to those but not as straightforward as just a little micro

676
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,720
Speaker 16:  SSD card wise has that option. Not sure you can, I don't think you can get

677
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,560
Speaker 16:  wise cameras in Europe though. But in terms of a smart home security

678
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,120
Speaker 16:  camera for indoor, as I mentioned, I'm not a big fan of them but one thing

679
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,880
Speaker 16:  I would recommend strongly if you are going to do that is get

680
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,080
Speaker 16:  one, he mentioned getting lots. I feel like that's, you know, it's

681
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,960
Speaker 16:  a little weird just to have cameras all around your house. A good

682
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,280
Speaker 16:  solution is a pan and tilt cam so that you know, you put it in a central

683
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,600
Speaker 16:  place and it can pan and tilt around.

684
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,040
Speaker 16:  So a Kara again has a, a good option there. UFI has

685
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,880
Speaker 16:  one too, a Kara one is really cute, it looks like a little cat and you have

686
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,200
Speaker 16:  the option in the app and there's a number of cameras that have this option

687
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,120
Speaker 16:  to just turn off the camera remotely and it just is little

688
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,120
Speaker 16:  eyes close and the camera rolls away. So that's

689
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,840
Speaker 16:  another good option to look for if for an indoor camera one that you can

690
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,640
Speaker 16:  shut off remotely and automatically have it turn off

691
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,640
Speaker 16:  say when you come home and then turn on when you leave so that

692
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,320
Speaker 16:  way you're not gonna end up with random pictures of you walking around in

693
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,680
Speaker 16:  your underwear. So if there was the concern about security,

694
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,720
Speaker 16:  if there was, you know, you may have bought from a brand that you trust

695
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,240
Speaker 16:  but then they have a major security breach or a data breach, you don't have

696
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,080
Speaker 16:  to worry that your private footage that you care about is

697
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,280
Speaker 16:  likely to be exposed. You've got, you know, hopefully only recorded

698
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,200
Speaker 16:  when you weren't home. So, and most good Security cameras these days have

699
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,120
Speaker 16:  some feature like that that will turn off when you come home, turn on

700
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,440
Speaker 16:  when you leave. The downside of that is if you're at home

701
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,240
Speaker 16:  asleep and someone comes into your house, your camera's not recording.

702
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,920
Speaker 16:  So this is why I like that tap mode one that I mentioned at the beginning

703
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,720
Speaker 16:  because it's always recording it, sorry, it's always scanning, it's always

704
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,600
Speaker 16:  looking but it only records when it sees someone. So, which is

705
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,400
Speaker 16:  a really neat feature.

706
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,160
Speaker 2:  You answered all of my questions. I think the one other thing I was thinking

707
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,080
Speaker 2:  is does it make sense if you're gonna do an indoor camera to

708
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,600
Speaker 2:  have it sort of disconnected from the rest of your smart home system? Because

709
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,720
Speaker 2:  I'm just thinking that is like the most high stakes thing that would be in

710
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,600
Speaker 2:  your smart home. So I almost don't want to connect it to anything

711
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,560
Speaker 2:  else in my smart home just as an another sort of way of walling it

712
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,120
Speaker 2:  off from everything else that if you're gonna have a whole bunch of stuff

713
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,120
Speaker 2:  on a Nest system, I'm like screw that. Buy a ring for this and

714
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,920
Speaker 2:  just run it on a completely separate version of your smart home

715
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,520
Speaker 2:  just to kind of air gap it as much as you can from everything else. Does

716
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,800
Speaker 2:  that make any sense?

717
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:09,200
Speaker 16:  Well I'm not sure that it would necessarily that your, the camera

718
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,240
Speaker 16:  itself is going to do something to the rest of your smart home I mean, I

719
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,360
Speaker 16:  think the biggest concern about the camera really would be the footage,

720
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,040
Speaker 16:  right? So that's what you don't want people seeing. One thing I have seen

721
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,960
Speaker 16:  people do, especially when you use HomeKit Secure video is so

722
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,520
Speaker 16:  the way HomeKit Secure video works with Apple is you can just put your camera

723
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:31,680
Speaker 16:  into your Apple Home app and in some cases not use

724
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,440
Speaker 16:  the company's app at all that it came from. But in the case of

725
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,360
Speaker 16:  UFI and the Cara, I believe you have to or at least get most

726
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,280
Speaker 16:  better benefit from using their app as well. But people, a lot of people

727
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,800
Speaker 16:  don't wanna do that, they just want it all processed locally. So what you

728
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,920
Speaker 16:  can do in go into your router and turn off the wifi

729
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:55,040
Speaker 16:  access for the camera so that it can only go through Apple's

730
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,840
Speaker 16:  servers and there's no chance of it using a separate server.

731
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,160
Speaker 16:  And so that's e especially if you're using local recording or some kind

732
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,920
Speaker 16:  of NAS device or something and you want to know that it's only

733
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,320
Speaker 16:  in your home and it's not being sent off somewhere into to someone's

734
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,920
Speaker 16:  servers, you can, you know, disable its wifi access.

735
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,600
Speaker 16:  That's a pretty, you know, that is somewhat requires a little bit of technical

736
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,080
Speaker 16:  expertise but not a lot. Especially if you have a, a mesh router that gives

737
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,000
Speaker 16:  you the option to pause internet to certain devices. You

738
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,800
Speaker 16:  can also get devices that monitor traffic from your smart

739
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,640
Speaker 16:  home so you could see if a camera was talking to

740
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,920
Speaker 16:  its cloud. So that, that's a good option.

741
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,800
Speaker 2:  Okay, we need to take one more break and then I think we can do a few more

742
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,840
Speaker 2:  questions before we get outta here. We'll

743
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,160
Speaker 17:  Be right back.

744
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,480
Speaker 18:  You are the man who gave them the power to destroy themselves

745
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,200
Speaker 18:  and the world is not prepared.

746
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,000
Speaker 17:  Oppenheimer opens in theaters today. Christopher Nolan's feverishly

747
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:02,840
Speaker 17:  anticipated film about the brilliant but troubled father of the

748
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,120
Speaker 17:  atomic bomb. Do you guys ever think about dying?

749
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,560
Speaker 17:  Yeah, no I don't wanna talk about Oppenheimer today. You can go back to

750
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,720
Speaker 17:  your regular life or you can know the truth about the universe.

751
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,520
Speaker 17:  The choice is now yours. The first one. Okay ladies,

752
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,080
Speaker 17:  let's do this. And I like the, let's do this

753
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,520
Speaker 17:  flip on those heels fall off your roof. We're having a giant blowout party

754
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,400
Speaker 17:  with planned choreography and a bespoke song and we're gonna sleep over

755
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,320
Speaker 17:  tonight because, because we're girlfriend, boyfriend, it's today. Explain

756
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,520
Speaker 17:  and it's the best day ever and so is yesterday and so is tomorrow. And

757
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,960
Speaker 17:  every weekday at 2:00 PM when we drop a new episode of Today Explained.

758
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,370
Speaker 2:  All right, next up we have a laptop question. Monica Chin is here to answer

759
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,410
Speaker 2:  laptop questions. Hi Monica.

760
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,130
Speaker 20:  Hey

761
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,170
Speaker 2:  I feel bad for just dragging you in here constantly to help people buy laptops

762
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,930
Speaker 2:  but the people need to buy laptops so we're, we're gonna keep doing this.

763
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,130
Speaker 2:  This person did not give us their name I don't think. But let's, let's hear

764
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:04,810
Speaker 2:  the question real fast.

765
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:10,050
Speaker 7:  Hey David. Hey rest of The Vergecast. My question, and you

766
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:14,050
Speaker 7:  probably get a lot of these is, so I have a 2019 MacBook

767
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,010
Speaker 7:  Air, it's got a I five processor, I got the base model, which

768
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,290
Speaker 7:  I think was a terrible idea four years in. So I'm

769
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,130
Speaker 7:  trying to figure out where I'm gonna upgrade computer wise. I have

770
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:29,970
Speaker 7:  a basic like pc but I'm, I'm on the fence. I like Mac

771
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,850
Speaker 7:  but I just feel like for my money I want something to where it has more

772
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,610
Speaker 7:  processing power. So as a person that's trying to like possibly

773
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:41,530
Speaker 7:  go back to school, And, I need a little bit more computer with computational

774
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:45,410
Speaker 7:  capabilities, what MacBook is it that I should go

775
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,850
Speaker 7:  for? And my budget's probably around like I think the Max I could probably

776
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,650
Speaker 7:  do is like three grand. And then PC wise, what

777
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,810
Speaker 7:  options do I have? Like I know you can get a lot of PC for under

778
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,810
Speaker 7:  $2,000, so like in your guys' perspective, what's a good

779
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,650
Speaker 7:  like laptop to go for? 'cause I, I like all the bells and

780
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,610
Speaker 7:  whistles. I do like the damn rainbow keyboards, they're so cool. But

781
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,770
Speaker 7:  I want something to where it works with my lifestyle to where I can do casual

782
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,810
Speaker 7:  stuff. And, I can take it on the go but it also has like good battery

783
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,170
Speaker 7:  life as well. And if I need to do some stuff at Excel, it's full

784
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,090
Speaker 7:  transparency. I am in accountant, it can actually do what

785
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,970
Speaker 7:  I needed to do Anyways. That's a mouthful. I hope you guys are able to

786
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:29,490
Speaker 7:  answer my question. Thanks and have a great one.

787
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,930
Speaker 2:  This question is a lot And I love it for being a lot but I

788
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,210
Speaker 2:  feel like what this boils down to is kind of like everybody's computer question,

789
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,370
Speaker 2:  which is basically like I need a computer that's like as good at everything

790
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,610
Speaker 2:  is possible. $3,000 is a pretty big budget actually.

791
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,490
Speaker 2:  So I'm curious like let's start on the PC side 'cause I think that's probably

792
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:52,010
Speaker 2:  the trickier question to answer. Where would you send our friend here?

793
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:52,770
Speaker 17:  Well

794
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,730
Speaker 20:  What I would actually say is, this is a little bit of a tough question to

795
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,130
Speaker 20:  answer because I don't actually have a great sense of what you're doing

796
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:01,210
Speaker 20:  with it. And so if I had you in front of me, I'd be asking you like what

797
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:05,170
Speaker 20:  exactly are you doing? What I get from what you want is Excel. That

798
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:08,890
Speaker 20:  was like the main thing that you mentioned that you would need like

799
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,650
Speaker 20:  quote unquote computational power for. And for that I would honestly say

800
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,770
Speaker 20:  I mean if you're already using a MacBook Air and you wanna stick with,

801
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,930
Speaker 20:  you wanna be under 2000. If you're, if you're trying to go back to school,

802
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,290
Speaker 20:  you probably want something portable. You're gonna be carrying that to and

803
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:25,890
Speaker 20:  from school. You want battery life as you mentioned that it's really hard

804
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,760
Speaker 20:  to find on the C PC side. We can into that shortly. But my honest

805
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Speaker 20:  recommendation with the, the only info I have about your, your lifestyle

806
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,200
Speaker 20:  being you need it for spreadsheets. I think you stick with what you know,

807
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,840
Speaker 20:  I think you get the air, I think the M two air like that can do your

808
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,040
Speaker 20:  spreadsheets. Like I had a actually a very similar conversation with my

809
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,160
Speaker 20:  dad about this a couple a couple months ago. 'cause he was like, he's in

810
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,680
Speaker 20:  a similar reason. He's like I need to do spreadsheets. you know, I just

811
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,080
Speaker 20:  dunno if the MacBook Air can do my spreadsheets. And I was like, dad get

812
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,520
Speaker 20:  the MacBook Air, it can do your spreadsheets. He got it, it can do his spreadsheets.

813
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,840
Speaker 20:  He loves it. He has no issue.

814
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,040
Speaker 2:  That is true. And especially if you're coming from a 2019 I five, the

815
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,080
Speaker 2:  jump to the M two is gonna like blow your mind. Yes.

816
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,080
Speaker 20:  That is really slow. If you like have tried, had

817
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,000
Speaker 20:  tried the M two before and like found that it was a limitation. And

818
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,280
Speaker 20:  you, and you were wondering like that might be a case where I'd say,

819
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,760
Speaker 20:  okay, you might wanna think about going up to the M two PRO or M two Max,

820
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,840
Speaker 20:  but that is such a jump in price and it's such a loss of

821
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,480
Speaker 20:  portability. I mean if you're, again, if you're going to school like back

822
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,240
Speaker 20:  and forth, you're going to classes, you're like sitting around the cafeteria.

823
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,080
Speaker 20:  Do you really wanna be carrying that like 16 inch or I mean that's just,

824
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,280
Speaker 20:  it's so much heavier. It's really not that much fun to lug around.

825
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,240
Speaker 20:  I really don't see a reason not to get the air that is sort of what your

826
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
Speaker 20:  answer is, is screaming at me

827
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,440
Speaker 2:  That tracks. But let's say in theory we want to go windows

828
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:47,920
Speaker 2:  here.

829
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,280
Speaker 20:  So if you wanna go windows, it is hard to find battery life on Windows these

830
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,960
Speaker 20:  days. Especially if you're looking for what you call computing power.

831
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,560
Speaker 20:  Like if you, if by that you mean you want something with a discreet G P

832
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,480
Speaker 20:  U for under 2000, my best recommendation is

833
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,320
Speaker 20:  gonna be the Zephyrus G 14. That's a gaming laptop. I know you didn't say

834
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,120
Speaker 20:  you wanna play games, but in all honesty, if you're looking for battery

835
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,800
Speaker 20:  life like that is some of the best you're gonna get. It's like really

836
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,000
Speaker 20:  ironic that's a gaming laptop, but that's just how it is in the current

837
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:22,800
Speaker 20:  landscape. The Zephyrs D 14 is some of the best, is is one of the

838
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,080
Speaker 20:  few devices that has like real G P U power

839
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,360
Speaker 20:  that also has all day battery life. So that is what I would be looking at.

840
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,520
Speaker 20:  It does not have an R G B keyboard, but it does have a backlit keyboard

841
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:37,440
Speaker 20:  that you can do some like fun effects with. And you probably can't

842
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,320
Speaker 20:  get this for under $2,000, but if you end up going above that, you

843
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,000
Speaker 20:  can get a lid that has some fun little lights on it that can do kind of

844
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,840
Speaker 20:  cool stuff. So if you're looking for bells and whistles, it does have that

845
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,200
Speaker 20:  option. It is gonna be a little pricier.

846
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,160
Speaker 2:  It did say they like the funny, the fun colors. So get some fun colors.

847
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:53,720
Speaker 2:  There

848
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,440
Speaker 20:  Are a few laptops as fun as Zephyrs G 14. But again, that model is

849
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,560
Speaker 20:  really, is gonna be a little over the budget that you gave us. But even

850
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,080
Speaker 20:  under that budget, you know, the keyboard is still, it's a fun keyboard.

851
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:07,040
Speaker 20:  you know, it's got, it's got a fun little font, it's got some fun keys on

852
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,960
Speaker 20:  it. You can get G fourteens that come in different little designs.

853
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,600
Speaker 20:  There's like an Allen Walker model that comes with a DJ deck. There's some,

854
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:18,320
Speaker 20:  there's some fun special additions that you can, you can look at.

855
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,600
Speaker 20:  They're gonna be a little more expensive. But I think 'cause they're, you

856
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,320
Speaker 20:  might be able to get some for under two grand if you do a little bit of

857
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,440
Speaker 20:  digging on Best Buy.

858
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,680
Speaker 2:  So yeah, I think the more we talk, the more I think you're right that the,

859
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,600
Speaker 2:  the M two air is the safest choice. And I agree that there

860
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,720
Speaker 2:  are, we've definitely reached the point of like, I'd like to be able to ask

861
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,640
Speaker 2:  some follow-up questions because it's like, if you want extra power, it's

862
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,080
Speaker 2:  like, okay, well are you more likely to want that or to want the thing to

863
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,960
Speaker 2:  last, you know, eight or 12 hours. But here is my last question.

864
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,520
Speaker 2:  And I think this, this is important. And I forgot until just now when I was

865
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,000
Speaker 2:  trying to spec this thing out that this matters 13 inch or 15 inch air because

866
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,720
Speaker 2:  now you get to choose.

867
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:57,160
Speaker 20:  Yeah, that's a, that's a good question. Honestly, the difference in power

868
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,120
Speaker 20:  between them is not huge. Like it's a, there's a, the 15 is

869
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,080
Speaker 20:  like a little than a little better or benchmarks. I don't know if the kind

870
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,280
Speaker 20:  of spreadsheet you're doing is gonna make a huge difference. I think that's

871
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,160
Speaker 20:  honestly, it's gonna come down to how big of a screen do you want for your

872
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,640
Speaker 20:  spreadsheet fair. And you know, there's, there's, there's a

873
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,000
Speaker 20:  non-negligible weight difference between the two as well. So you may wanna

874
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,160
Speaker 20:  factor in, you know, how much are you gonna be carrying this around, you

875
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,040
Speaker 20:  know, on campus or to other places that you go during the

876
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,880
Speaker 20:  day. The 13 inch is certainly more portable

877
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,800
Speaker 20:  if you're gonna be on the move. The 15 inch is not

878
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,840
Speaker 20:  like, it's not not portable, but it is heavier. I'm a little less happy

879
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,360
Speaker 20:  when I have to put in my backpack. There's a little bit of a difference.

880
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,120
Speaker 20:  And so though there's some trade-offs that are ultimately up to your preference.

881
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,800
Speaker 20:  The one other thing, if you're looking at Windows and You don't want, if

882
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,600
Speaker 20:  the ze D 14 is like too clunky for you and you want something a little bit

883
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,360
Speaker 20:  thinner, the other thing to look at would be the Dell X P S 13

884
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:56,840
Speaker 20:  that is much more on the portability side. That's a very thin, very light

885
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,800
Speaker 20:  one. you know, you have like a backpack full of all your school books and

886
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,240
Speaker 20:  whatever. It's really easy to slide that in. That's gonna be much closer

887
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,320
Speaker 20:  to carrying around a MacBook Air than it is to be carrying around a Zephyr,

888
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,840
Speaker 20:  which is gonna be a little bit thicker. That battery life

889
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,240
Speaker 20:  for me is like close to all day, but not quite all day. For you, it might

890
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,480
Speaker 20:  be different depends on your workload, but that is some of the better battery

891
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,840
Speaker 20:  life you can get as well. It is not close to the battery life they'll get

892
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,720
Speaker 20:  from the MacBook Air, but if you're looking for like a MacBook Air

893
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,160
Speaker 20:  size, but with Windows, that is what I would point you to.

894
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:32,480
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah, I just went in while we were talking. And I specked out a 13

895
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,320
Speaker 2:  inch M two MacBook air with 16 gigs of Ram

896
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,200
Speaker 2:  and a one terabyte s s d 1800 bucks way under

897
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,760
Speaker 2:  your budget. I suspect you will be thrilled with that computer coming from

898
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,640
Speaker 2:  an I 5 20 19 air. Yeah, I think that's the one,

899
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,000
Speaker 20:  Especially if battery life is your priority, that it's, it's gonna be really

900
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,880
Speaker 20:  difficult to beat that combination of like portability and battery

901
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,440
Speaker 20:  life and pretty much any other line for the, with the budget that you have

902
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,920
Speaker 2:  And it will crush your spreadsheets. Don't even worry about it.

903
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,080
Speaker 20:  Like I, I have a MacBook, I use it for spreadsheets all the time. I wouldn't

904
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,200
Speaker 20:  worry too much about it, but you, if you, if you're worried you could add

905
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,960
Speaker 20:  in some extra ram extra extra stuff to make sure that that can

906
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,080
Speaker 20:  handle it. Totally

907
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,840
Speaker 2:  Awesome, Monica, thank you. Appreciate it as always. Thank

908
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:14,960
Speaker 20:  You.

909
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,650
Speaker 2:  All right, let's get to our next question. Alison, welcome back. Thank you.

910
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,930
Speaker 2:  It's good to be back. We got so many more questions. The people keep having

911
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,690
Speaker 2:  questions about phones. Alison, I love

912
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:24,610
Speaker 20:  It. I'm here.

913
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,040
Speaker 12:  I'm literally here for it.

914
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,880
Speaker 2:  I love it. All right. You have not heard either of these Uhuh, so let me

915
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,080
Speaker 2:  play you the first one and then we'll go from there. Okay.

916
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:38,120
Speaker 21:  Hello, this is Trani from India. I just do want to know that I am

917
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,840
Speaker 21:  using a Pixel six A. So is it auto upgrading to Pixel

918
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:45,440
Speaker 21:  seven A or I will wait for Pixel eight A

919
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,640
Speaker 21:  or nine something. Thank you.

920
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,800
Speaker 2:  We love an upgrade question here on The. Vergecast. Oh,

921
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,400
Speaker 12:  I love it.

922
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:55,040
Speaker 2:  This is a good one, right? 'cause we just spent a bunch of time saying like,

923
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,320
Speaker 2:  if you have an old phone, here's when you should get a new phone. But this

924
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,080
Speaker 2:  is, this is last year's phone and this year's phone worth the upgrade.

925
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,600
Speaker 12:  I, I say hold onto to the six A unless you are like

926
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,000
Speaker 12:  a wireless charging stand. Hmm. Because that's in my mind, that's

927
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,320
Speaker 12:  the big upgrade with the seven A. Like there's a lot of other stuff,

928
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,560
Speaker 12:  but no, I think that six A is gonna be solid for like

929
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,960
Speaker 12:  a couple more years at least that's my hot take. Don't buy a new phone.

930
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,880
Speaker 2:  I like it. And, I think Google has done a pretty good job of

931
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:28,960
Speaker 2:  keeping these phones updated for a while. So I think you've, you've got at

932
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,880
Speaker 2:  least another couple of years of solid updates and the thing will

933
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,480
Speaker 2:  continue to work and Google's so invested in the software anyway that it

934
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,360
Speaker 2:  feels like the pixels have been kind of the rare phones that do a good job

935
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,200
Speaker 2:  of getting appreciably better over time. Yeah. And so I I I

936
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,560
Speaker 2:  feel good I'm kind of with you. Yeah, that is good. Stick with the six A,

937
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,160
Speaker 2:  I think it's the right call. Here's hoping Google Caress about the Pixel

938
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:53,160
Speaker 2:  long enough to make an eight A please. All right, let's get

939
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,400
Speaker 2:  to our next one, which is substantially more philosophical than the other

940
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,560
Speaker 2:  one.

941
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,000
Speaker 22:  Hey guys, this is Mark from Houston. Some comment that David

942
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:06,040
Speaker 22:  made a, it was like a week ago on Vergecast and he talked about how

943
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,360
Speaker 22:  he felt that the nothing phones too sort of represented

944
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,680
Speaker 22:  a sort of shift back into maybe like the old days of Android where there's

945
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,520
Speaker 22:  a lot of different competition in a lot of different interesting

946
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,200
Speaker 22:  phones. And, I was wondering, I feel like a really big part

947
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,240
Speaker 22:  of what made phones interesting in the mid 2010s were

948
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,800
Speaker 22:  really the fact that we had a ton of like, you know, Chinese phones

949
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:33,200
Speaker 22:  and even Indian phones. And so I assumed that with a change

950
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,120
Speaker 22:  of administration that we'd maybe see, you know, some sort

951
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,880
Speaker 22:  of movement on that front. But I was wondering are we ever gonna get

952
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,040
Speaker 22:  any phones from Huawei or Xiaomi or APO back here

953
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:48,840
Speaker 22:  in the US or is that sort of just doomed to never come back?

954
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,400
Speaker 22:  Because I really do feel like with providing an interesting sort of

955
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:57,320
Speaker 22:  competition here. So anyways, I was just wondering if you guys

956
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,960
Speaker 22:  have any updates or if you guys could maybe show us or talk to us about

957
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,160
Speaker 22:  that.

958
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,040
Speaker 2:  So I like this question in part because it references things that I said

959
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,000
Speaker 2:  on The Vergecast, so congratulations to me. But I think this is really

960
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,480
Speaker 2:  interesting. What I don't wanna do is like make political predictions, right?

961
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,880
Speaker 2:  Because so much of this is wrapped up in, in politics and things change really

962
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,520
Speaker 2:  fast. I would say if you like forced me to guess, I would say the

963
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,400
Speaker 2:  relationships with China are not going to get immediately better. Better.

964
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:23,880
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

965
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:24,280
Speaker 12:  But

966
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,920
Speaker 2:  The world changes quickly. Who knows? But I do think one of the things we

967
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,720
Speaker 2:  talk about, I think not enough on this show is the

968
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,120
Speaker 2:  fact that the US as a phone market is so much less

969
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,760
Speaker 2:  interesting in a lot of ways than all of the rest of the markets in the world

970
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,760
Speaker 2:  for exactly the reason that they're describing And. I. Do wonder if

971
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,720
Speaker 2:  you think about it that way, like is it, is it a bummer that we

972
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,680
Speaker 2:  don't get kind of the full breadth of what's out there and is available to

973
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,480
Speaker 2:  us and is there a chance that like more American companies might try to

974
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,160
Speaker 2:  do in this market? What is happening in other markets around the world?

975
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,040
Speaker 12:  I have so many feelings about this. Yeah. Like it is a

976
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,480
Speaker 12:  bummer. There are so many, especially in foldables,

977
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:09,640
Speaker 12:  like there's so many more options. Thinner, you know,

978
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,280
Speaker 12:  cheaper that we basically have two foldables here and they're

979
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:17,000
Speaker 12:  expensive is all hell. Yeah. So I think there's a few things

980
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,960
Speaker 12:  going on. Like obviously the relationships with China, And

981
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,880
Speaker 12:  I, I don't see that changing anytime soon either. The,

982
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,600
Speaker 12:  it's also the carriers I think have, yeah, have the

983
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,400
Speaker 12:  manufacturers kind of under their thumb and it's really

984
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,520
Speaker 12:  a bummer. I feel like it just has resulted in like

985
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,240
Speaker 12:  we get the kind of phones that Verizon and T-Mobile and at

986
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,320
Speaker 12:  t think they can sell, you know, at every price point. And

987
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,000
Speaker 12:  that's kind of all there's room for, and you've seen things like even when

988
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,280
Speaker 12:  LG left the mobile space and they didn't have like massive market share,

989
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,600
Speaker 12:  we were kind of like, oh, now's their chanting. Maybe APA will come in here

990
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,200
Speaker 12:  and Samsung just like shut that shit right down.

991
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,600
Speaker 12:  And we are exactly where we were before, but with

992
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:07,480
Speaker 12:  less lg.

993
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:11,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, I do think it's, I forget about the carrier things sometimes just

994
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,680
Speaker 2:  'cause like I live in the US and I'm sort of used to the way that it is.

995
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,840
Speaker 2:  But it is so unlike the rest of the world in that basically like the

996
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,800
Speaker 2:  way most people buy phones is they walk into their carrier store and they

997
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,640
Speaker 2:  trade in their existing phone and they get a new phone and they leave. And

998
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,320
Speaker 2:  that's, that's why people by and large don't switch ecosystems. It's why

999
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,000
Speaker 2:  people mostly don't change brands. And it's why a couple of companies, namely

1000
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,880
Speaker 2:  Apple and Samsung have been able to essentially just corner off

1001
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,520
Speaker 2:  the market for themselves. Whereas other places you can just like walk into

1002
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,880
Speaker 2:  a store, stick your sim card in and poof you have a new phone.

1003
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,800
Speaker 2:  I wish the world worked more like that in the United States, but it really

1004
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,000
Speaker 2:  doesn't seem like there's any chance of that getting better. And we even

1005
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,760
Speaker 2:  talked about this with Carl Pay, like these companies are

1006
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,560
Speaker 2:  desperate to find a way to make like unlocked phones work in the

1007
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:59,600
Speaker 2:  US And I just don't see any way that's gonna happen anytime soon, do

1008
00:58:59,600 --> 00:58:59,720
Speaker 2:  you?

1009
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:04,280
Speaker 12:  No, I I think it's a mess for them. And, I sympathize,

1010
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,400
Speaker 12:  you know, when coming into the US and trying to like

1011
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:11,960
Speaker 12:  sell an unlocked phone, you know, without the benefit of those

1012
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,840
Speaker 12:  carrier deals, the trade-ins that they can do the marketing.

1013
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:19,520
Speaker 12:  Like it is just such an uphill battle and yeah, I'm,

1014
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,280
Speaker 12:  I'm rooting for more options in the us And

1015
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,760
Speaker 12:  I think the carriers could do better. Like going to a Verizon store is

1016
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,640
Speaker 12:  literally like here's the iPhones, here's the Samsung phones, there's

1017
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,600
Speaker 12:  a few other phones like over here and ah, it stinks.

1018
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,600
Speaker 2:  I agree. Are there any, as you, as you look out across sort of the rest

1019
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,280
Speaker 2:  of the world, if you could hand pick a couple of phones to bring to the us

1020
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,640
Speaker 2:  does anything come to mind? Is there anything you like lust after as an

1021
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,680
Speaker 2:  American that you can't have?

1022
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,240
Speaker 12:  Yes. The X Me kind of Flagship phones. I think like

1023
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,960
Speaker 12:  the 13 Ultras, the latest one, they have that one inch camera

1024
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,720
Speaker 12:  sensor and just fully embrace the

1025
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,600
Speaker 12:  like camera ness of the phone. I have this photography kit that

1026
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:10,600
Speaker 12:  you like attach all the stuff to it, like a shutter button. It's, it's

1027
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,320
Speaker 12:  fun. I mean, is it the best idea? Is it something a lot of people are gonna

1028
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,160
Speaker 12:  buy? No. Right. I would call out Xiaomi, but

1029
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,440
Speaker 12:  there's a ton of stuff out there.

1030
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah, well and that, that exact thing is kind of the thing that I think

1031
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:27,120
Speaker 2:  the US market is missing the most, which is different ideas about phones,

1032
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:31,000
Speaker 2:  right? Like At this point, it's pixels, it's galaxies and it's iPhones and

1033
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:34,520
Speaker 2:  basically those are all the same thing, right? They have slightly different

1034
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,280
Speaker 2:  ideas, but they are functionally the same devices, doing the same things

1035
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:42,120
Speaker 2:  the same ways. At this point, And I kind of wish there was somebody

1036
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:45,640
Speaker 2:  out there doing what like Nokia did a bunch of years ago being like, what

1037
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,480
Speaker 2:  if we just made an enormous way too big camera and that was your phone.

1038
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,000
Speaker 2:  Like is that anything? Or if somebody was like, what if we put a TV antenna

1039
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,680
Speaker 2:  on your phone? Is that anything? And then lgs like what if it had wings?

1040
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,680
Speaker 2:  Is that anything? And? I. Just so much of that still happens in

1041
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,240
Speaker 2:  the rest of the world and we don't get any of it here because everybody is

1042
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,160
Speaker 2:  just making these kind of like lowest common denominator. How can we sell

1043
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:10,960
Speaker 2:  three phones to 300 million people kinds of decisions. And

1044
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,200
Speaker 2:  the smartphone market is much weirder than us people would

1045
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,800
Speaker 2:  know and that kinda makes me sad.

1046
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,640
Speaker 12:  Yeah, we're missing out.

1047
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,720
Speaker 2:  So let's just all move to Europe. Yeah, we won't get to have Threads, but

1048
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,680
Speaker 2:  we'll get to have cool phones.

1049
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:28,320
Speaker 12:  Well that works for me. No one's talking to me on Threads anyway.

1050
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,240
Speaker 2:  All right Allison, thank you again, appreciate you coming back.
