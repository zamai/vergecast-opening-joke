00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,830
Speaker 4:  Never. What time is in England Tom? It

27
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,870
Speaker 7:  Is core past nine.

28
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,550
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you're hammered. Let's be honest,

29
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,860
Speaker 7:  Like a couple of teas past dinner time,

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,390
Speaker 4:  Here's what I know about British people. It's 3:00 PM they're drinking, especially

31
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,440
Speaker 4:  lately is my understanding of the state

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,060
Speaker 7:  We drinking. If it's 3:00 AM we're just in bed drinking.

33
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,950
Speaker 4:  Like wake up, open the paper. Who's, Who's the monarch? Who's

34
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,470
Speaker 4:  the prime minister different today? Throw a couple back. Let's see what

35
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,060
Speaker 4:  happens.

36
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,110
Speaker 7:  Yeah, you have to be careful. You have to be nice to all of us now all British

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,590
Speaker 7:  people. Cause you never know when one of us is to become Prime

38
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,740
Speaker 7:  Minister.

39
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,680
Speaker 4:  I saw that video of Rishi Sak partying and I was like, this

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,330
Speaker 4:  shouldn't be a scandal. More world leaders should be forced

41
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,060
Speaker 4:  to rage on video before they become world leaders. So they

42
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,880
Speaker 4:  are reminded that at any point they can be taken down by their own

43
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,760
Speaker 4:  actions. That's true. It was good. It was a good video. It reminded me of

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,320
Speaker 4:  a thing that Casey Newton has said to me for years on unknown. We are quickly

45
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,160
Speaker 4:  approaching the day when world leaders will have just commonly have sexted

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,010
Speaker 4:  in their, in their teens. Oh yeah. And like we're just, we're just coming

47
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,320
Speaker 4:  to that moment and he's like, that's the singularity of all politics and

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,520
Speaker 4:  culture.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,400
Speaker 7:  It's definitely coming.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,080
Speaker 4:  It's the default expectation, not a scandal. Well about Casey on to unpack

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,650
Speaker 4:  that in great detail. Instead what we're gonna talk about in the show is

52
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,040
Speaker 4:  GA gadgets, tech companies, products. They make the

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Speaker 3:  Things you use to sex to other people. Yeah. Devices for

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,760
Speaker 4:  Sexting Surface pro nine with the arm ship. Good for sexting. Yay or

55
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,370
Speaker 4:  nay. The Verge cast,

56
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,600
Speaker 7:  It has port chip blurs. So maybe that's

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,480
Speaker 4:  True. All right, so we got Surface Pro reviews. They hit Tom, you wrote about

58
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,040
Speaker 4:  10 years of Surface. You talked to Pans Panay, Microsoft Head

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,720
Speaker 4:  earnings. Facebook had earnings. Apple is gonna have earnings while we record.

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,210
Speaker 4:  You'll hear us live. React to Apple either making billions of dollars

61
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,600
Speaker 4:  or slightly less billions of dollars depending on how the economy went this

62
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,200
Speaker 4:  quarter. Google had earnings. There's lots of earnings, lots of economic

63
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Speaker 4:  shakiness meta in a free fall cuz they're spending a lot of money in the

64
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,240
Speaker 4:  metaverse and we got some gadgets. And then here's the thing I want to tell

65
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,000
Speaker 4:  you. We're recording this the day before Elon closes the deal

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,360
Speaker 4:  to buy Twitter. So we're not gonna talk about that on this episode of the

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,640
Speaker 4:  Verest tomorrow when he closes the

68
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,240
Speaker 4:  deal, assuming he does, which we all think he's gonna

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,200
Speaker 3:  Do. I was just about to say that's a lot of confidence Eli. Like given what

70
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,120
Speaker 3:  we know so far with 24 hours notice to say you know what's gonna happen.

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,320
Speaker 3:  It's like a truly, truly bold clamp to

72
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,000
Speaker 7:  Make. You've just gotta let it sink in that he, he's got Twitter now. He's

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,400
Speaker 7:  the, the TWI chief or whatever he calls himself,

74
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,330
Speaker 4:  Assuming that happens, will have another episode tomorrow with Liz

75
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,280
Speaker 4:  to just unpack the Twitter situation. The thing I wanna say about

76
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,880
Speaker 4:  the sync, the number of people who

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,800
Speaker 4:  willfully did not get the joke, the dumbest

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
Speaker 4:  joke in the world of Elon tweeting. I just,

79
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,480
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna close Twitter, Let that sink in. And him walking in Twitter headquarters

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,140
Speaker 4:  with a sink I e letting the sink in. See what I'm saying?

81
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,690
Speaker 4:  The dumbest joke in the world. I have fully appreciate this joke.

82
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,480
Speaker 5:  He like doubled down on the dad joke by also bringing one of

83
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,320
Speaker 5:  his children with him just to be like, if you didn't know this was a

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,820
Speaker 5:  dad joke, there's my kid.

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,160
Speaker 4:  But it's like CNN's like Elon Musk shows up at Twitter headquarters with

86
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,650
Speaker 4:  the sink and it's like, yeah he tweeted, let that sink in. And the joke

87
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,840
Speaker 4:  is he let the sink in. It's not a

88
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,680
Speaker 4:  complicated idea. The word sync has two

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,140
Speaker 4:  meanings. That's the whole joke.

90
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,420
Speaker 3:  And now it's in

91
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,240
Speaker 4:  And now it's in. And I'm just like, it's like

92
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,880
Speaker 4:  you guys, this is he's, he's just being a clown. Like

93
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,640
Speaker 4:  it's pretty funny actually. Like he's a billionaire. He

94
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,320
Speaker 4:  showed up in an office with a sink so that he could tweet, let that sink

95
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,040
Speaker 4:  in and none of you got it.

96
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,370
Speaker 5:  Where is the sink now though?

97
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,960
Speaker 4:  We just like dropped it on Praga girl's desk. She's like

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,840
Speaker 4:  dropped it through the desk. All right. That's enough Twitter for this

99
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,640
Speaker 4:  episode. Like I said, when the deal closes, assuming it closes tomorrow,

100
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,920
Speaker 4:  we'll have another whole episode with Liz

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,160
Speaker 4:  Emergency episode. We'll put it in the feed. It'll be right there for you

102
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Speaker 4:  if you want Twitter stuff. But you know, other things are happening in the

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,320
Speaker 4:  world and the deal hasn't even closed yet. Who knows It's gonna happen. Let's

104
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,810
Speaker 4:  talk Microsoft. So Tom, you wrote a great piece about 10 years of

105
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,640
Speaker 4:  surface. It has been 10 years. You and I have talked about this many

106
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,360
Speaker 4:  times. The surface line effectively rescued the Windows

107
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,240
Speaker 4:  market. Yeah, it's one of the only examples I can think of, of the OS vendor

108
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,560
Speaker 4:  making the hardware and competition with its partners where everyone actually

109
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,440
Speaker 4:  became a success and now we're in this moment where it's like they made some

110
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,480
Speaker 4:  more surfaces and they're right back where they started with like an arm

111
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Speaker 4:  surface and it's just as crappy as it was 10 years ago. It's like weirdly

112
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,910
Speaker 4:  full circle.

113
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,560
Speaker 7:  Yeah and it's, it's at the point where it's where does it go next? I think

114
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,300
Speaker 7:  that's, that's the big question because obviously they had before the pandemic

115
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,120
Speaker 7:  and I think this is the most important bit of the surface history is that

116
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
Speaker 7:  they were really pushing for this jewel screen. Yep. Future, you know, they,

117
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,640
Speaker 7:  they, they show that stuff super early, which is kind of unusual for Surface

118
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,160
Speaker 7:  as well. And then obviously the pandemic hit and they, you know, they completely

119
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,310
Speaker 7:  just went the opposite way cause everyone was wanting to work from home.

120
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,160
Speaker 7:  They were focused on laptops so they kind of scrapped that idea. But it's

121
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,970
Speaker 7:  like, does that come back at some point? Like who knows? I don't know. Like

122
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,920
Speaker 7:  so I visited the, the headquarters spoke to P Pernet and the whole

123
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,520
Speaker 7:  Surface team and we were in this like room, which is like their roadmap room,

124
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,480
Speaker 7:  which is essentially a room with Windows but they're all blanked out.

125
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,110
Speaker 7:  They have like essentially free sort of rows of

126
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,520
Speaker 7:  tables where they'd have products. So it's like the current, the next version

127
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,560
Speaker 7:  and then the next version after that. Now obviously they didn't have those

128
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,520
Speaker 7:  laid out when I went in cuz you know, they thought they'd, they'd get rid

129
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,840
Speaker 7:  of those but that's essentially what that room is for. But I thought it was

130
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,360
Speaker 7:  kind of interesting that the Neo was still in the room when I visited. So

131
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,160
Speaker 7:  it was like obviously they had shown off some of the history, some of those

132
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,280
Speaker 7:  devices and all that sort of stuff. But I feel like that's Dell will come

133
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,100
Speaker 7:  back at some point.

134
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,840
Speaker 5:  Why did they stop? Like why did it go away?

135
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,440
Speaker 5:  Because all their partners were working on it too. I remember Dell and Lenova

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,230
Speaker 5:  were both like, wanna see this? Yeah And they would like always kind of like

137
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,720
Speaker 5:  pull you into a room and show it to you and be like cool. And then everybody

138
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,230
Speaker 5:  was like, No we don't do that anymore.

139
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,840
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think it was partly because it just wasn't really ready the software

140
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,430
Speaker 7:  and then it was like a big demand for, for Windows

141
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,320
Speaker 7:  itself to be better. So then they were like, okay, let's just

142
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,000
Speaker 7:  take the stuff that we were doing, the simplification, all the design

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,650
Speaker 7:  work and this, roll this into a new version. Windows will try and capitalize

144
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,440
Speaker 7:  on that for our OEMs. And let's be honest, look at some of the specifications

145
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Speaker 7:  for Windows 11. They, they pushed the CPU stuff up. So it's trying to

146
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,640
Speaker 7:  be a bit of a moment to have that old glory of windows where they would,

147
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,480
Speaker 7:  you know, a cycle of new hardware and and that sort of moment.

148
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,040
Speaker 7:  So I think there's, there's a so many different factors into why, why they

149
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,720
Speaker 7:  kind of paused that or cancel it, whatever you wanna call it.

150
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,390
Speaker 3:  Well I think one of them also is just there was this massive

151
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,840
Speaker 3:  leap in the number of people who suddenly wanted and

152
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,720
Speaker 3:  needed very straightforward, very functional pieces and the idea of

153
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,040
Speaker 3:  like sell me something new and insane, like goes out the window when it's

154
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,780
Speaker 3:  like I have to go to school tomorrow. Like I need a thing that works. Yeah.

155
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,720
Speaker 3:  And Microsoft was I think correctly also dealing with, there's like

156
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
Speaker 3:  a chip shortage and the stuff guitar to make and there's supply chain issues.

157
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,040
Speaker 3:  So it seems, it seems like Microsoft, like a lot of other companies was like,

158
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,000
Speaker 3:  okay we, we make this lineup of very good products and then this

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,920
Speaker 3:  lineup of like bonkers experimental, we think the future but

160
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,160
Speaker 3:  definitely not ready products. And I think like probably correctly made the

161
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,720
Speaker 3:  choice to like center back on some of that stuff. But now the question

162
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,640
Speaker 3:  is when do you get back to it? Cause like Tom, you

163
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,600
Speaker 3:  and I both have been talking that Panos about folding in dual screen devices

164
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,440
Speaker 3:  for like a decade now. Like that dude is in on this idea. Like I don't know

165
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,320
Speaker 3:  if he's right but he will, he that man will spend every dime Microsoft

166
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,080
Speaker 3:  has trying to make dual and folding screens a thing if they let him do

167
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,480
Speaker 3:  so.

168
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah, he, he always pretty much comes back to the idea of the device like

169
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,240
Speaker 7:  will mold to you, you know, like the different mode switching and, but like

170
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,520
Speaker 7:  that's his, that's his big thing. It's whenever the hardware's right for

171
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,080
Speaker 7:  that I guess. But the piece that I wrote was like obviously the history there

172
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,920
Speaker 7:  but then the, whether they can really nail what's next or or whether

173
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
Speaker 7:  like in 10 years we're still on the Surface Pro like, cause it's kind of

174
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,080
Speaker 7:  become their sort of MacBook Air like devices very

175
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,680
Speaker 7:  similar to what it started at. It's, it's got a form factor that's kind of,

176
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,440
Speaker 7:  you know, everyone's familiar with and they refine it every year essentially.

177
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,280
Speaker 7:  So like this year's one isn't really that different. The thing that's very

178
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,520
Speaker 7:  different is that they've got an intel or an arm chip that you can pick between,

179
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,360
Speaker 7:  which is I think that whole arm stuff is still not, is still

180
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,600
Speaker 7:  not there you know like it is still very early on and whether you wanna blame

181
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,570
Speaker 7:  Microsoft for that or Qualcom or developers or whatever

182
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,370
Speaker 7:  or the whole, the whole lot I think, I think you probably blame both but

183
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,280
Speaker 7:  if you do run Windows on an M one on M two it runs quite

184
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,590
Speaker 7:  well. So

185
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,520
Speaker 4:  Wait, how do you run Windows on an

186
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,180
Speaker 7:  M two? Some people have been able to to hack it and get it running.

187
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,080
Speaker 7:  The problem with the Qualcomm stuff is they just don't have the performance.

188
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,760
Speaker 7:  Like Yeah even in the single, single Freddie performance is pretty bad.

189
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,600
Speaker 7:  They're like basically offering up I five chips from like two, three years

190
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,520
Speaker 7:  ago in terms of performance And then on the operating system side you don't

191
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,120
Speaker 7:  quite have the apps that are obviously they're all emulated

192
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,760
Speaker 7:  essentially if you wanna run run Chrome. Although you could Google cause

193
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,250
Speaker 7:  they don't let anyone who uses chromium compile it for Arm.

194
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,880
Speaker 7:  So there's another, there's another aspect to that as well. Obviously Microsoft

195
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,040
Speaker 7:  does cause they've put in all the work and and they, they can go and do that

196
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,520
Speaker 7:  but like brave only just put out a preview build because they went and put

197
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,280
Speaker 7:  in all the work that Google for some reason is refusing to do. So

198
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,200
Speaker 7:  there's, there's a whole lot of things that that go into making that a a

199
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Speaker 7:  thing. But I mean Mike's was trying, been trying to do this for a decade

200
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,920
Speaker 7:  now. Yeah,

201
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,840
Speaker 4:  This is what I mean if you recall the Surface line launched

202
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,800
Speaker 4:  with the Surface and the Surface rt. Yeah. And they have

203
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,910
Speaker 4:  been trying to make Windows Onar a viable

204
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,730
Speaker 4:  competitor in so many ways for

205
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,440
Speaker 4:  so long and we, it's 10 years later and they're like

206
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,240
Speaker 4:  here's a surface with an arm chip in it and God bless them. They

207
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,210
Speaker 4:  didn't put Windows RT on it. Like the most ill-fated version of Windows

208
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,880
Speaker 4:  to ever exist still has a start button still looks like Windows theoretically

209
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,570
Speaker 4:  seems like run whatever app, but it's just as limited it feels like as Windows

210
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,960
Speaker 4:  rt, right? It can't run every app. The apps runs an emulation are slow and

211
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
Speaker 4:  the underlying arm chip is

212
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,920
Speaker 7:  Slow. I wouldn't say it's just as limited as RT but like, cuz it's basically

213
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,730
Speaker 7:  just Windows 11. The main problem is the non arm apps are slow.

214
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,400
Speaker 7:  So you really do need developers to actually port those apps across. And

215
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,040
Speaker 7:  if you're using stuff like, you know, Slack, all those sort of apps that

216
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,400
Speaker 7:  haven't been compiled in arm, then you're gonna notice it hugely. But then

217
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,360
Speaker 7:  if you think about it as just being a, a really expensive, like really expensive

218
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,200
Speaker 7:  Chromebook, then it's like if you start using most of the stuff out the

219
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,040
Speaker 7:  actual browser out of edge, which which is arm then it's not so bad. And

220
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,320
Speaker 7:  then you get the battery life improvements, all that sort of stuff so you

221
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,200
Speaker 7:  can see where the future is. It's just, they're not there yet at all because

222
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Speaker 7:  they need those developers to really buy into Arm. And to be honest, there's

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,560
Speaker 7:  not enough OEMs that are really buying into it and and putting these devices

224
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,020
Speaker 7:  out at a reasonable price.

225
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,360
Speaker 5:  But do they actually need those developers? Cuz that was one of the things

226
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,200
Speaker 5:  that was really good about when Apple did it, is they had that emulator to

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,040
Speaker 5:  just do it, to just speed it up for these people. Cuz they're like,

228
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah we want everybody to do this and it'll be way better if you do, but

229
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,720
Speaker 5:  we're just gonna do this other thing for most of you because we

230
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,440
Speaker 7:  Can't. Yeah. I do wonder what the performance would be like on the Windows

231
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,200
Speaker 7:  simulator if the chips were better. Yeah. If they were at the sort

232
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,760
Speaker 7:  of M one, M two level. I don't know. It's hard to say really. Yeah, like

233
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,360
Speaker 7:  I, I dunno for sure. I think there's, there's a mixture of it,

234
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,040
Speaker 3:  Right? That's the thing I keep coming back to too is like all of these things

235
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,560
Speaker 3:  and I think you're right that there's a lot of blame to go around and Microsoft

236
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,440
Speaker 3:  is clearly doing more now to try and get developers interested

237
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,640
Speaker 3:  in building these things. They're putting out nicer dev kits that run arm,

238
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,000
Speaker 3:  like there are good signs and instruction. It took them way too long to like

239
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,640
Speaker 3:  make any real moves in this way. But it, it does seem like Apple's move was

240
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,990
Speaker 3:  like, oh your app is not perfectly optimized. Here is infinity

241
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,960
Speaker 3:  processing power. We will solve all of your problems with just

242
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,400
Speaker 3:  brute force and like reading your story and then reading

243
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,960
Speaker 3:  Monica's reviews of the Surface Pro nine and the Surface laptop. Like all

244
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,440
Speaker 3:  I could think the whole time is like if Microsoft is not deep down the road

245
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,840
Speaker 3:  of making its own chips to solve some of this problem for itself, like what

246
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,320
Speaker 3:  in the hell are they doing? But it

247
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,120
Speaker 4:  Did like that's the SQ three. It's a qual Qualcomm chip

248
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,310
Speaker 4:  that Microsoft says it helped design.

249
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,430
Speaker 5:  It's like a souped up Qualcomm chip.

250
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,960
Speaker 7:  Yeah. All they do is they take, they take the chip with an extra

251
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,800
Speaker 7:  call and then they do some driver work with Qualcomm and then that's

252
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,250
Speaker 3:  It. They go to San Diego and they say, can you make it faster? And, and Qualcomm

253
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,530
Speaker 3:  says no and Microsoft says okay and then they leave.

254
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But like who makes faster arm chips? Apple.

255
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,450
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And soon probably Microsoft, like the rumors of Microsoft

256
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,970
Speaker 7:  building arm chips have been around for like the last couple of years for,

257
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,410
Speaker 7:  for servers and surface. So I think we'll be talking

258
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,370
Speaker 7:  about surface devices in five years and then we've let Jim, when they were

259
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,140
Speaker 7:  so crappy, like the Surface Pro nine and then

260
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,490
Speaker 7:  they'll all be on Microsoft chips and then hopefully they would've actually

261
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,370
Speaker 7:  nailed the actual chip work there. Because I think Microsoft has proven

262
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,970
Speaker 7:  that relying on like Invidia in the early days of Tegra and relying on

263
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,890
Speaker 7:  Qualcomm has just not really got them anywhere of Windows and on, even though

264
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,830
Speaker 7:  they have done a lot of the operating system work.

265
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,730
Speaker 5:  How would that work with their OEM partners though? Because if they start

266
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,610
Speaker 5:  making their own chips Yeah, then that just makes it really,

267
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,420
Speaker 5:  really messy with those OEMs.

268
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,200
Speaker 7:  It does, yeah. I mean who knows who they partner with to do it, but

269
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,690
Speaker 7:  I feel like it's the next phase of it though, isn't it? Like maybe they license

270
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,370
Speaker 7:  those chips out a lot of the, the stuff that Surface does,

271
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,650
Speaker 7:  like they license the pen technology out but they don't actually charge for

272
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,450
Speaker 7:  it. Yeah. And then they share the, the whole, you know, the kickstand design,

273
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,050
Speaker 7:  all that sort of stuff with Intel and, and all the OEMs. So they've all benefited

274
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,810
Speaker 7:  from it in one way or another. That's why basically every device looks like

275
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,910
Speaker 7:  a surface because they've shared those designs

276
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,460
Speaker 4:  And once took a very memorable walk around CES with

277
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,410
Speaker 4:  ps. We just looked at all the OEM tcs and he was like, this is all

278
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,370
Speaker 4:  the stuff, like this is why this is successful. Like when I give them credit

279
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,130
Speaker 4:  and I want to give them a lot of credit, they took a more abundant PC

280
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,550
Speaker 4:  industry that could not compete above $700

281
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,530
Speaker 4:  and and created one out of thin air with the

282
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,210
Speaker 4:  surface. Like that's legitimately exciting and legitimately no

283
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,190
Speaker 4:  other OS vendor has ever managed to compete with its licensees.

284
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,530
Speaker 4:  And the way they made it work is they just gave, they did the innovation,

285
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,090
Speaker 4:  they spent the money. I've been in the room with all the prototypes and sty

286
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,690
Speaker 4:  like we did that story every year for like five years. Like

287
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,450
Speaker 4:  we're gonna go to the surface styrofoam room. Then they gave it away, right?

288
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,370
Speaker 4:  They did not keep the engineering benefits to themselves. They, they

289
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,750
Speaker 4:  accelerated the ecosystem by giving away

290
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,610
Speaker 4:  the engineering the OEMs themselves were not doing or could not afford

291
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,450
Speaker 4:  to do. That's cool. Like there's real business strategy

292
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,280
Speaker 4:  and model innovation that went into all of that. And now there's at the hard

293
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,250
Speaker 4:  wall that they've been at for years of, they cannot go

294
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,760
Speaker 4:  on, they cannot go beyond the form factor of the surface

295
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,100
Speaker 4:  into folding screens, into thinner designs, into whatever else

296
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,830
Speaker 4:  because you have to get away from Intel to do it. And Arm and windows

297
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,650
Speaker 4:  are just, they just hate each other. It's like when you're watching your

298
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,810
Speaker 4:  favorite show and the writers are like, All right, now these two characters

299
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,890
Speaker 4:  are gonna get together. And you're like, no, they, they don't belong together.

300
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,250
Speaker 4:  That's Windows and Arm. I don't know how else to

301
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,680
Speaker 5:  Describe it. It's Joey and Rachel.

302
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,560
Speaker 4:  That's what I was thinking but I didn't wanna say it out loud.

303
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,630
Speaker 5:  I'll say it out loud. It's Joey and Rachel.

304
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,360
Speaker 7:  I'm curious if there's a world where Microsoft makes its own arm

305
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,280
Speaker 7:  chips licenses them out for some, you know, nominal fee

306
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,040
Speaker 7:  to to OEMs and Intel builds them.

307
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's a future that like Intel will be super happy about.

308
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,800
Speaker 3:  That seems like a gigantic win for Microsoft too. Like even if, if it

309
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,040
Speaker 3:  can like kick off this next flywheel of like that's how you compete with

310
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,240
Speaker 3:  the iPad in a meaningful way in terms of like battery life and connectivity

311
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,890
Speaker 3:  that tell you compete with the New Max. That's like, that's how you win

312
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,670
Speaker 3:  as an ecosystem. And as long as they keep caring about Windows

313
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,760
Speaker 3:  more than they care about making money from Surface, which continues to be

314
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,520
Speaker 3:  the case as far as I can tell. That's just a huge win. Like I I I assume

315
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,640
Speaker 3:  that's where Microsoft's going. The intel part of it I hadn't thought about

316
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,920
Speaker 3:  which would be sort of fascinating and they'd make a lot of like America

317
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,880
Speaker 3:  First Noise in a way that would be really interesting. That seems to me

318
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,720
Speaker 3:  like where Microsoft ought to be going if they're

319
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,880
Speaker 4:  Not No we look, we had, we had Pat on the other show that I'm not allowed

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,370
Speaker 4:  to mention,

321
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,440
Speaker 3:  We don't have another podcast. Nobody listened to Eli. There is no other

322
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,390
Speaker 3:  podcast.

323
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,190
Speaker 4:  I'll happily put an AMD logo on the side of a chip fab in Ohio.

324
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,040
Speaker 4:  I'll happily put another logo. Right. And like he knows that

325
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,670
Speaker 4:  he's gotta make his foundry business real. If he's making

326
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,360
Speaker 4:  five nanometer arm chips, 18 Angstrom arm

327
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,320
Speaker 4:  chips or whatever, whatever they're

328
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,080
Speaker 5:  And like lower than five nanometer, lower than five nanometers, you're

329
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Speaker 4:  Gonna make a look. If he's making them for Microsoft and there's a Microsoft

330
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,400
Speaker 4:  logo in an ARM logo, he doesn't care cuz he's, he's just getting the volume

331
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,200
Speaker 4:  and the foundry that he needs to like save the business. Yeah. While

332
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,600
Speaker 4:  they desperately try to catch up on the, on the processor design side. All

333
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,320
Speaker 4:  of that is three years away. Like they just broke ground on this

334
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Speaker 4:  foundry, you know, like they're not even close to it right now.

335
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,040
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But if, if they time it right, it could be the perfect time for Intel

336
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,590
Speaker 7:  with like the geopolitical tensions trying to compete with

337
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,270
Speaker 7:  tsmc. Like if they get it at the right time, you know,

338
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,530
Speaker 7:  they should build for, for anything really.

339
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,000
Speaker 4:  Do you think that the surface line, you know the, the new Surface

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,960
Speaker 4:  laptop, the Pro nine is just like an evolutionary step. Are these

341
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,880
Speaker 4:  like upgrade worthy devices? Are they just there? Like have you

342
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,400
Speaker 4:  gotta buy one? You buy one? Yeah.

343
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,690
Speaker 7:  I don't think like, this year's a bit weird because it's 10 years you thought,

344
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,440
Speaker 7:  oh they're gonna do some crazy device, you know, but they, they kind of weren't

345
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,200
Speaker 7:  thinking in that way from when I was talking to them and it wasn't really

346
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 7:  like a big fanfare for them. It was like, you know, a point to sort of reflect.

347
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,720
Speaker 7:  But in terms of the actual devices, yeah they're just, they're very incremental.

348
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,920
Speaker 7:  Right. The Surface Studio two plus the Fuller

349
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,720
Speaker 7:  $4,300 or 4 5 4 4,500

350
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,600
Speaker 7:  if you get the keyboard as well and the mouse and the sign. It's

351
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,430
Speaker 5:  Got a 30 60 in it.

352
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,540
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's got 30, 60 and an 11th Jen Chip

353
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,630
Speaker 3:  Wwa.

354
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,320
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And we're on, we're on 13th Jen at the moment. Well not those mobile

355
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,260
Speaker 7:  chips, but they're about to drop. The interesting part of

356
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,980
Speaker 7:  about, of the whole of these surface devices this year is the pronoun

357
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,740
Speaker 7:  with the, the arm and the internships that we've just been talking about.

358
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,420
Speaker 7:  But they are very incremental. But I think more interesting is that

359
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,940
Speaker 7:  these three devices a decade from when they first started

360
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,560
Speaker 7:  releasing the, the Surface RT tablet on, on, on Arm,

361
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,360
Speaker 7:  on Invi Tera back in the day it's come,

362
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,960
Speaker 7:  it's come full circle because Panos actually told me that

363
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,670
Speaker 7:  they originally were planning to actually release a pc,

364
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,440
Speaker 7:  a laptop and a tablet for, for Windows eight for Surface,

365
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,840
Speaker 7:  which is something he hasn't really talked about before. And he said those,

366
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,200
Speaker 7:  those other two devices dropped off cuz they, you know, they bit off more

367
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,840
Speaker 7:  than they could chew so they, they weren't quite ready to launch

368
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,760
Speaker 4:  Them well. So like Michael Dell showed up and was like I'll kill you if

369
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,360
Speaker 4:  you put out a desktop. Yeah, that's my whole business. They wouldn't do a

370
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,680
Speaker 4:  laptop for years, right?

371
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,880
Speaker 7:  Well yeah but apparently they were always planning to,

372
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,540
Speaker 4:  John Lenovo was like outside with a knife.

373
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,230
Speaker 5:  Old John

374
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,590
Speaker 5:  Lenovo,

375
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,800
Speaker 4:  It's Michael Dell, John Lenovo, Steve hp

376
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,550
Speaker 7:  But the, the OEMs famously didn't know until, I think

377
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,960
Speaker 7:  Bulmer called them like a couple of days before or something that, so I feel

378
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,680
Speaker 7:  like they were probably still planning to do the laptop early on

379
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,640
Speaker 7:  and maybe there was a bit of om pressure so it probably pushed it out

380
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,920
Speaker 7:  even further than maybe they were expecting. But then they were obviously,

381
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,640
Speaker 7:  obviously Surface RT landed a bit rough Surface Pro was,

382
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,240
Speaker 7:  you know, the form factor was there, but it wasn't quite until the Pro Free

383
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,310
Speaker 7:  came when everyone was like, okay this makes sense.

384
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,320
Speaker 4:  That was the one where they, they really got the the kickstand right?

385
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,010
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah the kickstand, it went free two

386
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,760
Speaker 7:  as bit ratio biggest display. It was really feeling light.

387
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,700
Speaker 7:  It was, it was like a bunch of different hardware things came together

388
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,040
Speaker 7:  and it kind of made sense for everyone. So, and I think probably after that

389
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Speaker 7:  device and they were like okay we can go ahead and do the laptop now. Cause

390
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,630
Speaker 7:  they were probably focused on getting that pro free. Right.

391
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,560
Speaker 4:  They had given away enough Hinge Engineering to be

392
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,200
Speaker 4:  like, all right, can we do a regular laptop now? And they were like, yes

393
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,510
Speaker 4:  we've we've taken enough hinges from you.

394
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,630
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say it's while that the laptop has been kind of like

395
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,910
Speaker 5:  boring it's entire ti this entire time

396
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,280
Speaker 3:  I would but like in the best possible way, I'm totally convinced that the

397
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,200
Speaker 3:  Surface laptop is the like most underrated surface by a million

398
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Speaker 3:  miles because it's just like they do such cool stuff on the Surface

399
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Speaker 3:  Studio and the Surface Pro three has like a great form factor but like if

400
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,960
Speaker 3:  you just want a laptop, the Surface laptop is a great laptop and it

401
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,660
Speaker 3:  has been for a while now. It was, it was kind of

402
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,800
Speaker 3:  has its fits and starts at first but like the last couple have been very

403
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,760
Speaker 3:  good and I feel like it doesn't get nearly the shine I guess Alex, because

404
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
Speaker 3:  I think you're right. It's like they're not breaking any new ground there.

405
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,980
Speaker 3:  They're just like, would you like a good laptop? We made one of those

406
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,280
Speaker 7:  But do you, do you remember the early days though, like putting Fabric,

407
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,000
Speaker 5:  Loved that

408
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,520
Speaker 4:  Fabric, right? Again that's, they did that at Knife point. John

409
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,000
Speaker 4:  Lenova was like, here's what I want you to do. Upholster the

410
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,590
Speaker 4:  laptop, right.

411
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,920
Speaker 5:  Make sure it's stains really nicely.

412
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,760
Speaker 7:  But act actually that reminds me of, of an anecdote that I didn't actually

413
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,600
Speaker 7:  include in the story but like Ralph Groan who's like

414
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,680
Speaker 7:  their, I can't remember his exact title but he's, he's basically Windows

415
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,480
Speaker 7:  and Devices does a lot of the design work. He recounted

416
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,320
Speaker 7:  like that idea of like trying to put the fabric on the

417
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,360
Speaker 7:  laptop and and how difficult it was cause they thought oh we're just gonna

418
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,240
Speaker 7:  slap the Surface Pro keyboard on top of a laptop and glue it and it'll be

419
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,120
Speaker 7:  fine. But it wasn't. And he said that it greatly reduced

420
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,040
Speaker 7:  the repairability, which is why I fixed it, gave it like a zero when they

421
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,440
Speaker 7:  first tore it down. And he said that if they were gonna make that trade off

422
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,190
Speaker 7:  again he probably wouldn't make it.

423
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,070
Speaker 4:  I think that makes sense. That is, you know, that was before Microsoft

424
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,040
Speaker 4:  went to Repairability as a virtue. I think right after that I

425
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,720
Speaker 4:  think they woke them up in some way cuz they started making a lot of noise

426
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,430
Speaker 4:  about it right after that happened.

427
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,050
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And last year they partnered up with iix it

428
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,800
Speaker 7:  to, to do some like kits for technicians and stuff to be able to repair

429
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,840
Speaker 7:  surface devices and their schools have obviously creeped up as well, especially

430
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,120
Speaker 7:  on the laptop side. And then they did the, I can't remember the name of it

431
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,960
Speaker 7:  now. It's the, the laptop go. They have so many

432
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,560
Speaker 7:  different names. The really cheap one, that's what I say and that thing is

433
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,040
Speaker 7:  like super repairable for technicians. Like you can pull the display off

434
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,920
Speaker 7:  and change the ram and everything is essentially repairable in it.

435
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,200
Speaker 7:  So that's, I think that's the kind of hint of where they might go with surface

436
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,560
Speaker 7:  devices as well. But on on the arm side, the stuff that they've done with

437
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,400
Speaker 7:  like the new processing chip on there and the AI stuff, I think

438
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,120
Speaker 7:  that's kind of a hint of where they really want to go or they see how

439
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,080
Speaker 7:  computing's changing. Especially like, you know like on Discord

440
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,000
Speaker 7:  or on on Zoom or Teams, it does like the background removal, like

441
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,760
Speaker 7:  if your dog barks and that sort of stuff. The difference with what they're

442
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,400
Speaker 7:  doing is they're actually using this separate chip so that it doesn't even

443
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,080
Speaker 7:  use your CPU or gpu. So that's, that's kind of interesting if we're gonna

444
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,480
Speaker 7:  offload productivity tasks and all that sort of stuff to a separate

445
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,440
Speaker 7:  chip in the future. Kind of like what's what Apple's doing.

446
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,260
Speaker 4:  That's, so back to the future man I had a, I had a Mac in like

447
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,920
Speaker 4:  the nineties that had a separate DSP chip in it for things like that.

448
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,720
Speaker 4:  Like everything old is new again like all the time. By the way I, the Mac,

449
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,530
Speaker 4:  I had the shortest lived Mac in history. It was called the Centra six 60

450
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,520
Speaker 4:  av. It was on sale for like 68 days and somehow I

451
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,000
Speaker 4:  had one but it had a DSP in it.

452
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,750
Speaker 7:  That's what we call a British Prime Minister sort of time.

453
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,350
Speaker 4:  That's one Liz Trusts. It was, it was the macro

454
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,320
Speaker 4:  head of lettuce and somehow the lettuce was a much more reliable school

455
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,240
Speaker 4:  computer. Microsoft also had earnings this week. It seems like

456
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,880
Speaker 4:  things are fine for Microsoft

457
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,030
Speaker 4:  ish.

458
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,640
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I mean like so their revenue was okay, their profits weren't and

459
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,840
Speaker 7:  everything else, but I think it's more their outlook that's quite surprising.

460
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,760
Speaker 7:  So when does OEM revenue drop by like 15%, which you know, PC sales

461
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,440
Speaker 7:  have dropped by 15% so it all kind of like lines up but then they're

462
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,240
Speaker 7:  saying OEM revenue next quarter is gonna drop the high

463
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,900
Speaker 7:  thirties percent. Wow. And devices revenue, which includes Surface

464
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,840
Speaker 7:  and HO HoloLens and PCE accessories now is gonna drop by

465
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,560
Speaker 7:  30%. So like that's, that's some big heavy drops that they're

466
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,170
Speaker 7:  forecasting and alongside that zero growth has slowed down.

467
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,960
Speaker 7:  So they're getting hit sort of like three times with

468
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,640
Speaker 7:  some of the market stuff. So I think next quarter is gonna be very difficult

469
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,320
Speaker 7:  for them and probably met and Amazon and everyone else who's, whose profits

470
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,120
Speaker 7:  are, are hurting at the moment. So it's their forecast that have really got

471
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,970
Speaker 7:  their stock wobbling at the moment. So

472
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,560
Speaker 3:  It seems like cloud gaming though is starting to

473
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,480
Speaker 3:  tick up and win in in a pretty interesting way. Like it's, what was

474
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,720
Speaker 3:  the number that like 20 million people have tried it at some point, which

475
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,560
Speaker 3:  is one of those like meaningless numbers. It seems big but like what has

476
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,000
Speaker 3:  used it mean? I don't know. Yeah but it does seem like they're, they're pretty

477
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,390
Speaker 3:  optimistic about where this is headed I feel like.

478
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,280
Speaker 7:  Yeah, like they shared 10 million earlier this year and that was just

479
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,840
Speaker 7:  before they signed that deal with Epic Games to bring Fortnight to exports

480
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,490
Speaker 7:  cloud gaming. So that's clearly made the the numbers double.

481
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,880
Speaker 3:  Oh that's right and that you don't even have to pay for it, right? You can

482
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,720
Speaker 3:  just do it. Yeah.

483
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,640
Speaker 7:  Okay. Exactly. That's the only game. Yeah you could play for free. So I think

484
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,600
Speaker 7:  that's like their experiment to see what if they let free to play titles

485
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,280
Speaker 7:  on there, how much revenue they're gonna donate from in game purchases and

486
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,160
Speaker 7:  stuff. But yeah, like I, it's still really early though Cloud and

487
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,960
Speaker 7:  he was, he was kind of interested listening to Phil Spencer speak at the

488
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,720
Speaker 7:  Wall Street Journal live last night. He was talking about how game

489
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,680
Speaker 7:  past is 15% of the exports content and services revenue and that how

490
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,480
Speaker 7:  he thinks that's gonna remain the same. So obviously the revenue will grow

491
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,400
Speaker 7:  overall, but he thinks that it's, it's gonna account for that 10

492
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,200
Speaker 7:  to 15%. So and it sounds like Gain

493
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,120
Speaker 7:  pass is is kind of hitting some slow down in growth in, in

494
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,560
Speaker 7:  terms of the console side. I think their long bet is that Apple and Google

495
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,760
Speaker 7:  will be both be forced to make changes on mobile and that's their, their

496
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,720
Speaker 7:  like sort of in in the future. But that's a long, that's a long big bet

497
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,120
Speaker 7:  and they're spending billions of dollars on that. So it's still the growth

498
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,520
Speaker 7:  that they really need for for Game Pass is isn't quite there yet. And I think

499
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,920
Speaker 7:  there was, there was a report today from Axios where

500
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,840
Speaker 7:  Satin the benefits he gets for his salary and all that sort of

501
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,560
Speaker 7:  stuff, he gets them based partly on you know, game pass growth and

502
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,320
Speaker 7:  they were supposed to hit 75% and they hit 20 something

503
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,960
Speaker 7:  percent instead. So you can see that they were clearly expecting a lot more

504
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,520
Speaker 7:  growth in Game Pass this year and it wasn't quite there. So it's just

505
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,480
Speaker 7:  some interesting dynamics going on with Game Pass and they're bet on

506
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,960
Speaker 7:  gaming then it's definitely a clear case that it's slowed down a little bit

507
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,170
Speaker 7:  more than they were expecting.

508
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,960
Speaker 3:  It seems like to some extent Microsoft's bet there is like

509
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,560
Speaker 3:  a bet on Congress getting something done and changing things cuz it seems

510
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,200
Speaker 3:  very unlikely to me that they're like Apple is just going to suddenly change

511
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,900
Speaker 3:  its mind and be like nevermind Microsoft, welcome back to the app store

512
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,520
Speaker 3:  and betting on Congress to get things done so that Satya and can make more

513
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,510
Speaker 3:  money is a dangerous game to be playing right now.

514
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,230
Speaker 5:  Well it's not just Apple and Google that needs to change like it is

515
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,360
Speaker 5:  also the ISPs in the United States need to actually

516
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,320
Speaker 5:  deliver internet that can support this product. Like part of me

517
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,600
Speaker 5:  is thinking that's one of the reasons that they did Fortnite is that's got

518
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,520
Speaker 5:  a huge audience, a wide variety of people are using that. It's not

519
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,320
Speaker 5:  just those people who can afford an Xbox Series X and live in a house

520
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,800
Speaker 5:  with like 200 megabits down so they can test it and see how it's running

521
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,400
Speaker 5:  on these other things and probably not as great as they would

522
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,880
Speaker 7:  Like. Yeah, they get, they probably get some some really good data out of

523
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,520
Speaker 7:  that. Also, Phil said last night, you know, the Keystone device, their

524
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,480
Speaker 7:  export streaming console that appeared on his shelf that you tweeted a

525
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,330
Speaker 7:  couple of weeks ago, he now says that that is not coming for like a few years.

526
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,320
Speaker 7:  So you could tell that that that cloud stuff is still a little bit early

527
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,550
Speaker 7:  and and they're not quite sure where they're gonna go with it. So yeah,

528
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,240
Speaker 4:  Wait, hold on. There's like a lot to unpack with this whole thing. First

529
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,080
Speaker 4:  of all, like betting on Congress is one idea and to some extent,

530
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,040
Speaker 4:  you know the, they did a bunch of stuff recently. Did they do all

531
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,800
Speaker 4:  the things? They did not do all the things. Had they confirmed Gigi Stone

532
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,680
Speaker 4:  to the fcc? No, I don't know what they're doing. Got a whole episode

533
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,640
Speaker 4:  of that other podcast coming with that. Have they passed the antitrust films?

534
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,080
Speaker 4:  They have not. Is there whatever, I dunno what they're doing. Apple, we'll

535
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,720
Speaker 4:  talk about this later, but Apple just this week was like, guess how in charge

536
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,480
Speaker 4:  we are of the iPhone the most in charge.

537
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,280
Speaker 4:  Here's all these new app store rules, here's new ads in the app store. Like

538
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,120
Speaker 4:  yeah, we're just in charge of this product and no one stopped us yet. There

539
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,880
Speaker 4:  was all this noise last summer and we don't care. Here's

540
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,460
Speaker 4:  here's the new app store rules by the way, we're gonna, the 30%

541
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,400
Speaker 4:  fee now extends even more things like Apple's the most in

542
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,080
Speaker 4:  charge there unless Microsoft can figure out how to get over that wall and

543
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,840
Speaker 4:  deliver a game streaming app on iOS, which they have not done and

544
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,680
Speaker 4:  we've heard about at various hearings and trials and whatnot. Like they

545
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,480
Speaker 4:  can't do it. The other piece it's fascinating to me is

546
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,280
Speaker 4:  Microsoft was so close to announcing that

547
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,080
Speaker 4:  game streaming product. Like Phil Spencer was on decoder

548
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,560
Speaker 4:  and told me it was coming. He said it out loud, It's coming

549
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,240
Speaker 4:  soon. Tom, you and I both were like ready for

550
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,360
Speaker 4:  the announcement. Like

551
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,030
Speaker 7:  Yeah that was like a last second switch.

552
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah, like we, we just like heard the rumbles like we were like, all right,

553
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,760
Speaker 4:  this is gonna happen. Like we're ready. And then like it went away and now

554
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,280
Speaker 4:  he's like, it's years away. We've decided to partner with Samsung, by the

555
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,600
Speaker 4:  way Wall Street Journal Tech live that conference perhaps to Joanna. She

556
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,560
Speaker 4:  got good stuff out of Phil Spencer. She got good stuff out of Jaws and Credit

557
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,520
Speaker 4:  Figure 80. We'll talk about that stuff too. But Joanna's a co-founder. You

558
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,560
Speaker 4:  gotta throw it out to her. That's just the Verge family. It's really what

559
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,400
Speaker 4:  is the Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference but an extension of the first

560
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,280
Speaker 4:  time. That's how I feel about our alumni network. We reverse colonized

561
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,000
Speaker 4:  Bloomberg. Let's just take it over. It's, it's mine now. So like

562
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,560
Speaker 4:  it's just weird. Like that whole product was their future and the brick wall

563
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,340
Speaker 4:  still exists and the idea that they're just gonna like put apps on Samsung

564
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,760
Speaker 4:  TVs is not gonna grow that market. I'm like pretty

565
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,520
Speaker 4:  confused about all because they were like, they were rip Roar and ready to

566
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,430
Speaker 4:  go and now they're in neutral.

567
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,510
Speaker 5:  I fundamentally do not think it's Apple or Google. That's the hold back here.

568
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,440
Speaker 5:  I I like Spencer has repeatedly talked about this, Microsoft as

569
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,080
Speaker 5:  a whole has talked about the internet is the barrier here. Like Microsoft

570
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,000
Speaker 5:  has been doing these internet reports for years now being like, the FCC

571
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,720
Speaker 5:  is failing on this. Everybody is failing on this, the internet is bad in

572
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,120
Speaker 5:  this country and they're financially incentivized to do that both because

573
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,920
Speaker 5:  of cloud gaming and Azure and like that's what's holding

574
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,480
Speaker 5:  them back. Like I don't think it's a coincidence that they open up cloud

575
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,240
Speaker 5:  gaming to Fortnite. They get a ton of new users and then they're like whoa,

576
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,960
Speaker 5:  whoa, whoa, let's hold back on the next big cloud

577
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,880
Speaker 5:  push. Because they're seeing probably over and over and over again that

578
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,550
Speaker 5:  the internet just can't support it as everyone who tries cloud gaming

579
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,530
Speaker 5:  sees, despite the mini Stadia fans insistence

580
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,350
Speaker 5:  on their Reddit to this day.

581
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,160
Speaker 7:  I also think a lot of it those that they went pretty quick with experts cloud

582
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,050
Speaker 7:  gaming. Like they weren't intending to launch it when they did.

583
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,880
Speaker 7:  As far as I'm aware, Google came out with, it was the Assassin Creek game

584
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,330
Speaker 7:  in the, in the browser. They had that working in people in press hands

585
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,320
Speaker 7:  playing with it. Microsoft announced like the day after that or

586
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,040
Speaker 7:  two days after it we're doing X Cloud, but we weren't have public trials

587
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,760
Speaker 7:  until a year later. So they, they, I think Google really

588
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,680
Speaker 7:  spooked them in many different ways and so they, they pushed

589
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,440
Speaker 7:  ahead with this, but they made it an optional thing. They put actual Xbox

590
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,400
Speaker 7:  consoles in the cloud rather than, you know, PCs or infrastructure like

591
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Speaker 7:  that. And they're kind of held up by that in a way because

592
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,720
Speaker 7:  they're streaming architecture isn't quite as good. It's, it never was quite

593
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,040
Speaker 7:  as good as Stadia. Definitely not as good as G Force. Now they're still at

594
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,600
Speaker 7:  10 80 p 60 frames second they can't, they can't do 4K

595
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,110
Speaker 7:  streaming at the moment. So if you're gonna go to TVs and you're gonna launch

596
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,760
Speaker 7:  a streaming stick or device or whatever you wanna call it, you kind of need

597
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Speaker 7:  that 4k I think. I think you do now I think, I think there's an expectation

598
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,790
Speaker 7:  for that even though it's cloud, I think it's still an expectation.

599
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,520
Speaker 4:  I have a much, much more cynical read of this vastly more

600
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,280
Speaker 4:  cynical read of this.

601
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,720
Speaker 5:  Give it

602
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,360
Speaker 4:  To us. The game stream market is unproven. No one knows how the economics

603
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,280
Speaker 4:  work. The Xbox console market super proven and they have

604
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,030
Speaker 4:  the chips now and it's the holiday quarter and they can just sell a lot of

605
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,880
Speaker 4:  Xboxes. And that is a, that is a safer

606
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,520
Speaker 4:  economic bet in the current climate with the rocky waters ahead

607
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,880
Speaker 4:  for Microsoft to just be like, you know what, pump the brakes in your weird

608
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,610
Speaker 4:  experiment sell a lot of Xboxes this quarter. Gaming

609
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,960
Speaker 4:  is quote unquote recession proof. That's what people always say. There's

610
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,920
Speaker 4:  still all this pent up demand cuz we weren't able to sell them for the past

611
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,560
Speaker 4:  year and a half. Just flood the market with Xboxes. People will buy

612
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,480
Speaker 4:  games. We know how that money works and I, I have to imagine some

613
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,200
Speaker 4:  combination of don't take the risk on the future, like

614
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,240
Speaker 4:  just extract the money from the present for as long as we can.

615
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,080
Speaker 5:  Well, especially with, I was gonna say with the economy, with the fact that

616
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,280
Speaker 5:  they're seeing these like, look our, our outlook's not so great for the next

617
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,160
Speaker 5:  couple of quarters. Like yeah, let's just huddle up, let's do

618
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,080
Speaker 5:  what we know how to do best and make, make money consistently

619
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,540
Speaker 5:  rather than get really big and experimental.

620
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,120
Speaker 4:  All right, so we're gonna go to break, but we come back, we're gonna talk

621
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,320
Speaker 4:  about a company doing the exact opposite of that

622
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,800
Speaker 5:  Idea,

623
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Speaker 4:  Which is meta. We'll be right

624
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,710
Speaker 4:  back.

625
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,370
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. So let's talk about meta real

626
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,290
Speaker 4:  quick. There's a lot going on with this company. We

627
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,900
Speaker 4:  started the show by saying it was flagship podcast on tv. What I'm referencing

628
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,850
Speaker 4:  is Jim Kramer CBC Anchor who told people, I guess last

629
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,450
Speaker 4:  quarter, quarter before you should invest in meta. And then this quarter

630
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:45,030
Speaker 4:  the stock has tanked. Meta's business is like falling apart

631
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,650
Speaker 4:  and they're throwing money at the Metaverse. And today he apologized to everyone

632
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,270
Speaker 4:  for that this be he said he trusted management too much and it was pure hubris

633
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,170
Speaker 4:  the metaverse. And he said it's almost a rogue situation, which is an incredible

634
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,700
Speaker 4:  thing to say about Meta, which I will remind everybody

635
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,690
Speaker 4:  is fully controlled by Mark Zuckerberg. He can just do whatever. You can't

636
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,410
Speaker 4:  fire him. He owns the whole company. He has super voting share

637
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,400
Speaker 4:  every year. This is a true story. Every year the stockholders of meta

638
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,370
Speaker 4:  vote to somehow limit Mark Zuckerberg's power. But

639
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,210
Speaker 4:  because he has super voting share, he just votes no and wins. This happens

640
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,860
Speaker 4:  every year. It's crazy.

641
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,290
Speaker 4:  So I don't know, but meta's in like a really tough

642
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:29,970
Speaker 4:  spot. They had horrible earnings. The Apple ad

643
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,650
Speaker 4:  tracking transparency prompt ruined their ability to track it hurt

644
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,420
Speaker 4:  the advertising market. They've tanked there, they're losing, shared a TikTok

645
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,600
Speaker 4:  and then they are just blowing money on reality

646
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,200
Speaker 4:  labs. Just 10 billion gone

647
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,280
Speaker 4:  against the metaverse. And I would say effectively no one's

648
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,300
Speaker 4:  happy.

649
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,000
Speaker 3:  You could say that. I mean the numbers are really insane. Like I'm just looking

650
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,960
Speaker 3:  at these now. Like just the, my favorite part is, so Meta's

651
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,400
Speaker 3:  reality Labs division, which is the one overseeing all the Metaverse stuff,

652
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,280
Speaker 3:  all the o all the, the artists formerly known as Oculus stuff, all the Quest

653
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,707
Speaker 3:  stuff, The Quest Pro, it made 285 million

654
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,960
Speaker 3:  in revenue for the quarter, which was down 50%, which

655
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,920
Speaker 3:  they're saying mostly is due to lowering sales of the Quest

656
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,270
Speaker 3:  two, which makes sense. It's relatively old, it's got a big price hike.

657
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,990
Speaker 3:  That division which remember $285 million in revenue

658
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,800
Speaker 3:  lost 3.7 billion this quarter and

659
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,480
Speaker 3:  9.4 billion for the year so far. So this company is going to

660
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Speaker 3:  spend what looks like 13 or $14 billion

661
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,310
Speaker 3:  on the Metaverse this year. Meanwhile

662
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,880
Speaker 3:  it's hemorrhaging money because of Apple and some of the ad tracking

663
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,750
Speaker 3:  stuff and some of it's like core revenue drivers

664
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,720
Speaker 3:  like Facebook are not the sort of unstoppable

665
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,080
Speaker 3:  juggernauts that they once were. And so it's like, it, it just seems like

666
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,090
Speaker 3:  all at once this week everybody looked at this and was like, Hey Mark,

667
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,660
Speaker 3:  no,

668
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,690
Speaker 4:  But

669
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,940
Speaker 3:  We are not interested in this company doing this thing anymore.

670
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,920
Speaker 5:  But David, you you gotta spend money to make money. That's,

671
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,300
Speaker 5:  that's, that's, that's what's sucks out there saying

672
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,510
Speaker 3:  You have to spend all your money,

673
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,360
Speaker 5:  You'll make money, it's gonna be fine

674
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,720
Speaker 7:  While your lunch is being stolen by TikTok.

675
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,640
Speaker 3:  Exactly

676
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,960
Speaker 4:  Right. So this is the thing. So they, they did report some of their user

677
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,800
Speaker 4:  numbers. So all these numbers are crazy. They all just

678
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,470
Speaker 4:  have crazy names and they just make people on Facebook seem

679
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,800
Speaker 4:  like robots. Like Facebook doesn't know you as a person. It only knows you

680
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,710
Speaker 4:  as something called a daily active people.

681
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,330
Speaker 3:  That's

682
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,040
Speaker 4:  Me. It's, I refuse to be a daily active person.

683
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,500
Speaker 4:  Never.

684
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,240
Speaker 5:  How dare

685
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,680
Speaker 7:  You? I haven't been daily active since the pandemic.

686
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,490
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I'm more of a three times weekly active person.

687
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:44,160
Speaker 4:  So daily active people up 4% monthly active

688
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,000
Speaker 4:  people, right? Daily active users. The difference between a

689
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,960
Speaker 4:  family daily active person and a daily active user, who knows, they're

690
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,720
Speaker 4:  saying these numbers are up and, but they're up like 2%,

691
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,600
Speaker 4:  3%. And this is after they were like,

692
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,580
Speaker 4:  turn on the jets, compete with TikTok, everything's real now

693
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,400
Speaker 4:  and this is the best they've been able to do. And then here's the main

694
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,920
Speaker 4:  piece of the puzzle. They've delivered

695
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,400
Speaker 4:  17% more ad impressions here over year. But because the

696
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,200
Speaker 4:  tracking isn't as effective because Apple refuses to let

697
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,640
Speaker 4:  them track. Like when you say tracking, there's like lots of tracking.

698
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,680
Speaker 4:  There's whatever scary tracking you're thinking of your head. But very

699
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,080
Speaker 4:  specifically what Facebook has long promised

700
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,010
Speaker 4:  people is we can show people an ad on Facebook,

701
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,840
Speaker 4:  we can target their interests so precisely. And then later on

702
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,740
Speaker 4:  when they buy something from you, we can attribute it to that ad.

703
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,080
Speaker 4:  Cuz we can track people from the app onto the web onto wherever else they

704
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,720
Speaker 4:  are. All the stuff we can do. Apple's ad tracking, transparency broke

705
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,400
Speaker 4:  those links. So Facebook can't track you outside of its app anymore. It can't,

706
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,400
Speaker 4:  when you buy something on the web, it can't attribute, Hey, you saw this

707
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,800
Speaker 4:  ad a bunch of times how you bought something outta the

708
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,000
Speaker 5:  Web just on iPhones

709
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,520
Speaker 4:  Stuff. Just on iPhones. But you know,

710
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,480
Speaker 5:  There's like 12 people who are using their little Chromebook and being like,

711
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,100
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna see what, what Dottie's doing today on Facebook.

712
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,320
Speaker 4:  The money, the money is on the phone. And the, the, the people who spend

713
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,680
Speaker 4:  money, famously there's a lot of data about this. People on iPhones spend

714
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,400
Speaker 4:  more money. So add impressions went up

715
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,160
Speaker 4:  17% year over year. The price per ad, because Facebook

716
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,720
Speaker 4:  can no longer guarantee success went down

717
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,510
Speaker 4:  18% year over year. So delivering more ads that are cheaper,

718
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,430
Speaker 4:  that means their revenue went down 4%. And that's like,

719
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,400
Speaker 4:  that's a death spiral. Like, I don't know how else to describe that. The

720
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,280
Speaker 4:  value of the product they sell for money is going lower even

721
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,840
Speaker 4:  as they deliver more of them. And it's like as like whatever ads are free,

722
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,760
Speaker 4:  like digital advertising is your, like there's not someone in

723
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,360
Speaker 4:  like the Facebook ads factory like hammering out bespoke ads

724
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,300
Speaker 4:  like it's software, but you're making more of a thing

725
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,180
Speaker 4:  for tiny user increases that you're selling for cheaper.

726
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,080
Speaker 4:  Wow. Over here Mark Zuckerberg is just the lighting cash

727
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,630
Speaker 4:  on fire to give people legs in the metaverse. Like

728
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,480
Speaker 4:  it's just a bad situation all around.

729
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,360
Speaker 3:  Well, and and I think that the like macro thing going on here for me

730
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,320
Speaker 3:  is that it's super, super clear that everybody's

731
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,960
Speaker 3:  out on the metaverse. Like there there was that moment where everybody was

732
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,040
Speaker 3:  all in on the metaverse and there was like a Metaverse ETF and all these

733
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,920
Speaker 3:  companies went public and it was a whole big thing. And now what's very

734
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,560
Speaker 3:  clear, like this big meta investor, Ter Capital, their ceo

735
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,440
Speaker 3:  whose name currently escapes me, Brad Gertner wrote this whole thing

736
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,160
Speaker 3:  basically being like, we still think Facebook is a strong business and

737
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,920
Speaker 3:  Instagram is a strong business and WhatsApp is a strong business and we wish

738
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,620
Speaker 3:  you'd stop paying attention to this stupid thing where nobody has legs

739
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,840
Speaker 3:  and focus on the thing where you actually know how to make money. And that

740
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,040
Speaker 3:  was really fascinating to me cuz like there's, there's this one line of thinking,

741
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,840
Speaker 3:  like you're saying that like all of that stuff is sort of has peaked

742
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,520
Speaker 3:  and is now just going to be sort of slowly managed to climb for a long time.

743
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,460
Speaker 3:  And thus what meta needs to do is find this next thing.

744
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,840
Speaker 3:  But that I thought was really interesting that it's like, no, there's still

745
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,720
Speaker 3:  a good successful company in here. You just won't pay attention to it because

746
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,960
Speaker 3:  you're so obsessed with this idea of the metaverse because you'd rather not

747
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,640
Speaker 3:  talk about content moderation anymore. And so you're, you're like running

748
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,480
Speaker 3:  away from the company that works towards one that increasingly people think

749
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,680
Speaker 3:  just doesn't, If that has really flipped in people's minds, it's gonna be

750
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,150
Speaker 3:  really hard for meta to pull out of any of this.

751
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,870
Speaker 7:  I thought it was interesting that Phil Spencer last night called it the metaverse

752
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,600
Speaker 7:  poorly, poorly coded or poorly created video games, something like that.

753
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,560
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah. When when Microsoft like there teaming up with meta to do that,

754
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,110
Speaker 7:  it works.

755
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:36,040
Speaker 4:  I was like, Yes, Phil Spencer go nuts man.

756
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,400
Speaker 4:  But

757
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,640
Speaker 7:  He's being honest, right? Like he's he's telling you how it

758
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,400
Speaker 4:  Is. So Yeah, he's like, I make kick ass video games. Do you make a good video

759
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,920
Speaker 4:  game? Yeah, chances are we'll just buy your shit.

760
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,740
Speaker 8:  I'm Phil Spencer.

761
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,640
Speaker 4:  And then he's like looking at, at these avatars in the metaverse seems like

762
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,040
Speaker 4:  what are you doing? Or are these polygon counts

763
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,880
Speaker 4:  five by Xbox series X? Like do

764
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,480
Speaker 4:  it like there's like a whole thing there that is like worth thinking about

765
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,990
Speaker 4:  because Microsoft has all but abandoned tolerance.

766
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,830
Speaker 4:  Like it's

767
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,600
Speaker 7:  Dead. Yeah, pretty

768
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,120
Speaker 4:  Much. Right? And they're like, screw it, me can take all this risk and we'll

769
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,910
Speaker 4:  just deliver Outlook to their headset when it's time.

770
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I think that's like perfectly smart for Microsoft in

771
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,240
Speaker 4:  like the current economic conditions they're in. Whereas Zuckerberg is like,

772
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,120
Speaker 4:  we're sticking with it. Well he has a quote. The first part is, I get

773
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,280
Speaker 4:  that a lot of people might disagree with this investment, but from what I

774
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,120
Speaker 4:  can tell, I think this is going to be a very important thing. There's

775
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,320
Speaker 4:  the confidence you want, it's like what?

776
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,090
Speaker 8:  But a fake,

777
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,920
Speaker 4:  So a backdrop of all this should note we have Quest

778
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,080
Speaker 4:  Pro review units. I have one, Alex Heath has one. Eddie Robertson has

779
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,040
Speaker 4:  one. The embargo time in this review was incredibly short.

780
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,880
Speaker 4:  It was like four days, whatever. So people have them in there out in the

781
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,520
Speaker 4:  world. I'm sure you've seen other reviews. We are just taking our time. I

782
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,450
Speaker 4:  think it is impossible to know whether the Metaverse is going

783
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,280
Speaker 4:  to work or Zuckerberg from what he can tell, this is gonna be an important

784
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,040
Speaker 4:  thing without a thorough review of this product. Like

785
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,840
Speaker 4:  this product is the payoff right now. It's the state of the

786
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,650
Speaker 4:  art. Yeah. That meta can deliver against this vision.

787
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,000
Speaker 4:  So we were like, we're not gonna rush this out in four days. We've taken

788
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,920
Speaker 4:  a couple meetings in Horizon Worlds. We we're doing the stuff my here's my

789
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,520
Speaker 4:  preview. I think you all know that I was a big fan of the Quest two, I remain

790
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,080
Speaker 4:  a big fan of the Quest two. The Quest two is an excellent consumer product.

791
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,720
Speaker 4:  Agree it under promises and over delivers. And

792
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,400
Speaker 4:  so, and it, and for a while there it was cheap. So you like bought

793
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,920
Speaker 4:  this thing that you didn't feel like you were blowing a lot of money on,

794
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,720
Speaker 4:  you had put it on. You're like, this is cool. Grandma's in the

795
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,320
Speaker 4:  metaverse, she's freaking out. There's stuff to do in there. It's like a,

796
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,540
Speaker 4:  it's a game console. It's a cheap game console that can do a lot of things.

797
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,440
Speaker 4:  And it, like I said, under promises over delivers. My preview

798
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,200
Speaker 4:  of the Quest Pro is this thing promises a

799
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,790
Speaker 4:  lot.

800
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,600
Speaker 8:  Tune in next time. Our review of the Quest

801
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,220
Speaker 8:  Pro

802
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,860
Speaker 4:  Boy that's a lot of promises at $1,500.

803
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,960
Speaker 5:  And they also announced that they were gonna like, they

804
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,640
Speaker 5:  confirmed the Quest three is coming next holiday

805
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,460
Speaker 5:  season.

806
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,560
Speaker 4:  But the Quest three is more game console. That's fine. I don't think that

807
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:17,830
Speaker 4:  like,

808
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:21,640
Speaker 5:  Well that's gonna, like anybody who is like anybody who is like, maybe I'll

809
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,960
Speaker 5:  get a Quest two this holidays. Like why, why, why am I gonna go spend more

810
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,400
Speaker 5:  money for the Quest two with a Quest three is next

811
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,000
Speaker 4:  Year? Well they've already, from these earnings, we can tell they have, people

812
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Speaker 4:  have stopped buying a question, like they raised the price and everyone's

813
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,630
Speaker 4:  like, well I'm done with this idea. Because again, it's a toy. Like

814
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,320
Speaker 4:  I, it was competitively priced like the Nintendo Switch,

815
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,920
Speaker 4:  right? Right. And you now it's, it's 3 99, it's

816
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,840
Speaker 4:  competitively priced with the PS five. Like it's just

817
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,520
Speaker 4:  in a different zone and you just get way more out of it.

818
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,640
Speaker 4:  You get way more out of its competitors. So I just don't, I don't think the

819
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,960
Speaker 4:  1500 Quest Pro, which is marketed at business use

820
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,520
Speaker 4:  cases, right. Like it's like do Zoom is a

821
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,360
Speaker 4:  cartoon. It has nothing to do with whether you're gonna like play games in

822
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,280
Speaker 4:  it. Like the Quest two. It Yeah, I just, they're just in a weird spot. So

823
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,840
Speaker 4:  we've got that review. We're working on it. Addie's writing it. Keith and

824
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,600
Speaker 4:  I are just helping. I don't knows. Cause the idea is that you're doing

825
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,240
Speaker 4:  it together, the point of this product is not to be alone, it's to be together.

826
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,920
Speaker 4:  So we're, we're trying to like hang out together. The metaverse,

827
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,890
Speaker 5:  Right? It's trying to answer for like Slack and Zoom

828
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:32,130
Speaker 5:  in everything. It's just trying to be like the office is done,

829
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,970
Speaker 5:  $1,500 instead of a real office.

830
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:38,760
Speaker 4:  Go. Yeah. The the, the one thing I will say without trying to give too much

831
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,640
Speaker 4:  away, the first time we all met in Horizon with

832
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,520
Speaker 4:  the face tracking was just one of the funniest 15

833
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,000
Speaker 4:  minutes of my entire life. Cuz it was just us making

834
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,840
Speaker 4:  faces at each other as cartoons. Like I was like, I'm making a kissy

835
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,040
Speaker 4:  face. Can you see the kissy face? And a is like, yes. And then she's just

836
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,880
Speaker 4:  waving her cartoon hands around and that was legitimately some of the

837
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,510
Speaker 4:  funnest, funniest moments with a computer

838
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,890
Speaker 4:  I've ever had.

839
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:09,450
Speaker 3:  Is it an HR violation to make a face tracking kissy face

840
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,090
Speaker 3:  at,

841
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:10,720
Speaker 4:  In a, in

842
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,730
Speaker 5:  A meeting?

843
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:15,000
Speaker 3:  Is that, I dunno.

844
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,120
Speaker 4:  Fish face. I was wearing a fish face. Many cops are on this. It was a fish

845
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,000
Speaker 4:  face. We gotta take a break. We'll be back. Apple earnings are out. We

846
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,960
Speaker 4:  gotta get into that. We'll be right

847
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,220
Speaker 4:  back.

848
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,790
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're back. Bunch of Apple News to talk about.

849
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:00,650
Speaker 4:  Mac West 13 Ventura hit iPad review, iPad Pro

850
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,420
Speaker 4:  Review. Apple confirm the iPhone's getting usbc.

851
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:08,250
Speaker 4:  There's a rumor of a 16 inch iPad, which is deeply

852
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,930
Speaker 4:  hilarious. But we should start with earnings. Cause earnings literally hit

853
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:15,490
Speaker 4:  while we were doing the last segment, right? Apple made a bunch of money

854
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,370
Speaker 4:  in a way that other tech giants are not making a bunch of money right now.

855
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,250
Speaker 4:  Alex was threat.

856
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,770
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no. So services are up are like 5%.

857
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,450
Speaker 5:  Tom's been helping me do the math off screen. You guys can't hear him do

858
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,330
Speaker 5:  it all. I think the big surprise here is that Max are

859
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,170
Speaker 5:  up what, 20%? Which is

860
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,210
Speaker 7:  Just 25. Yeah,

861
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:36,400
Speaker 5:  25%. Which is just a big number.

862
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,370
Speaker 4:  That's a new MacBook error. That's that number.

863
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:40,650
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's just that that that MacBook Air jump

864
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:44,530
Speaker 3:  Counter that to what just happened to Microsoft and Microsoft's

865
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,810
Speaker 3:  guidance. And it's like we, we've seen this like tank in the PC industry

866
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,610
Speaker 3:  over the LA and Chromebooks have been collapsing over the last

867
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,600
Speaker 3:  few quarters and Apple is just like, here, would you like a

868
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,850
Speaker 3:  very fingerprint heavy MacBook Air? And people are like, Yes I do.

869
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,570
Speaker 4:  Thank you. Well, so they they won't tell us we don't know that it's the MacBook,

870
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,250
Speaker 4:  it could be the Mac studio. Like we don't know. You

871
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,090
Speaker 3:  Only have to sell 12 of them and it it that that's all your

872
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,420
Speaker 3:  revenue.

873
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,800
Speaker 7:  So these, these max sales are more than what Apple for. Cuz they,

874
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,743
Speaker 7:  they forecast 9.3 billion and it was actually 11.5

875
00:52:18,183 --> 00:52:21,850
Speaker 7:  billion and they forecast 20.1 billion for

876
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,770
Speaker 7:  services and it was actually 19.2 billion. So like their forecast

877
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,690
Speaker 7:  seemed to be a little bit all over the place at this time. But the, the max

878
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,420
Speaker 7:  sales are super surprising, especially in the light of like

879
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,110
Speaker 7:  15% down PC market overall at the moment.

880
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:37,530
Speaker 7:  The Mac is like wow

881
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,170
Speaker 5:  Above. I think what we're seeing here is that

882
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,210
Speaker 5:  everybody went out and they rushed out. They bought a computer cuz everybody

883
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,970
Speaker 5:  needed a computer because of the pandemic. And now everybody's like, Wait,

884
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,210
Speaker 5:  but I want a computer that just works. And so they're going a bite

885
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,170
Speaker 5:  back.

886
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,890
Speaker 4:  Sorry, I don't, I think they, I think this was

887
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:58,770
Speaker 4:  the first year that a bunch of kids like physically

888
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:01,770
Speaker 4:  went back to school and they already had their Chromebooks but then they,

889
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:05,010
Speaker 4:  there was a new MacBook error and it was available to buy for a bunch of

890
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:08,330
Speaker 4:  college kids. Went back to school. Like there's just a thing

891
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:12,130
Speaker 4:  happening in the market for laptops where Yep, people

892
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,930
Speaker 4:  bought sort of what they needed to get by for work from home. But then

893
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:19,170
Speaker 4:  we're kind of just like back to the laptop market as it

894
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,970
Speaker 4:  was. So it's just normalizing down. And whenever Apple releases

895
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:26,750
Speaker 4:  a new mainstream model like sales go up except

896
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:30,720
Speaker 4:  this quarter when they release new iPhones and everyone

897
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,680
Speaker 4:  was like, yes, iPhone sales are up quarter over quarter. It's

898
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,600
Speaker 4:  beneath estimates but there's just all this chatter that

899
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,130
Speaker 4:  people don't care. And like that's the weird part to me

900
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:46,120
Speaker 4:  because all of that services, I think the reason Apple bets so heavily on

901
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,800
Speaker 4:  services and then constantly forecast services is cuz they're just trying

902
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,520
Speaker 4:  to squeeze more money out of existing iPhone owners because they

903
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,800
Speaker 4:  can't, they've sort of lost the ability to tell what will be hits and what

904
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,780
Speaker 4:  won't be hits.

905
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,760
Speaker 7:  I'm one of the suckers that bought an iPhone full team pro and I had a 13

906
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,340
Speaker 7:  pro and I was like, as soon as I got it, I was like, why,

907
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,360
Speaker 7:  why did I buy this? Yeah. Like it's

908
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,160
Speaker 7:  just, it's just like, it's not that radically different

909
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,630
Speaker 7:  and

910
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,520
Speaker 5:  I think more people are like me. I bought an 11 pro year when it came

911
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,400
Speaker 5:  out years ago and I bought the 14 pro this year and I was like, oh wow, this

912
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,600
Speaker 5:  is a big, this is a big change for me. But these, these

913
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,560
Speaker 5:  changes are so incremental that most people are like, Do I wanna spend

914
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,810
Speaker 5:  the money on that? Do I wanna spend the money on my ever increasing rent?

915
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,720
Speaker 5:  Do I wanna buy a MacBook Air to replace this Chromebook? I panic bought

916
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,170
Speaker 5:  at Best Buy in March, 2020. Like

917
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:41,280
Speaker 5:  where's my money gonna, I have finite money. Where does it go when

918
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,040
Speaker 3:  You factor in the fact that the pros are the only exciting phones in the

919
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,200
Speaker 3:  lineup? And like even the, the earnings seemed to confirm that, that the,

920
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,840
Speaker 3:  the 14 and 14 plus didn't do anything for anybody. Which I think was

921
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,690
Speaker 3:  more or less the correct response to the 14 and 14 plus.

922
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,600
Speaker 4:  No, no, the 14 plus wasn't in there man.

923
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,800
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But there have been, there have been reports that the demand is not

924
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,720
Speaker 3:  what Apple hoped for. Like, I don't know, I don't see a lot of 14 pluses

925
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,860
Speaker 3:  floating around. I'll just say you that

926
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,350
Speaker 4:  How could you even tell they all look the same

927
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:12,200
Speaker 4:  like this. David's like walking up to people like you've got a big phone.

928
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,440
Speaker 4:  Can I see how many cameras he got on the back of that thing? Cause I, I've

929
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,510
Speaker 4:  been collecting some data.

930
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:20,280
Speaker 7:  He's been using these Quest Pro to scan their phone, find

931
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,380
Speaker 7:  out

932
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,320
Speaker 4:  Big, cheap, big cheap screens always works. I'm just holding onto this in

933
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:24,750
Speaker 4:  my heart.

934
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,240
Speaker 3:  Well, we'll see, I I believe in you when I believe in big cheap screens.

935
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,520
Speaker 3:  But I do think like it as the price of these things gets more

936
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,320
Speaker 3:  expensive. Like one, one thing I have sort of held

937
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,200
Speaker 3:  onto for a long time is that Apple believes its users are not at

938
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,860
Speaker 3:  all price sensitive and that it can raise the prices of everything into Infinity

939
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,500
Speaker 3:  and that will always work. And until now it has always worked.

940
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,040
Speaker 3:  But it does make me wonder like if the only interesting phone is the

941
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,960
Speaker 3:  $1,100 one, are people going to wait one

942
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,080
Speaker 3:  extra year now to upgrade because now the good phone is

943
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,020
Speaker 3:  $1,100.

944
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,480
Speaker 4:  Yes. Yeah. And the thing that's interesting about it by the way, is the dynamic

945
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,240
Speaker 4:  island, which Tom, I don't know you feel about it, but I've had this thing

946
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,080
Speaker 4:  now I feel the same way about it when I did the review, which is, and

947
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,880
Speaker 4:  iOS sixteen.one came out this week with live activities.

948
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,260
Speaker 4:  There's a bunch of apps.

949
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,080
Speaker 7:  But, but I tell you what, it's one of those things that although it doesn't

950
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,240
Speaker 7:  feel like it's fully complete, I feel like if I went back to an iPhone without

951
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,080
Speaker 7:  it, I'd miss it. It's, it's one of those, those things you get, you get

952
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,600
Speaker 7:  used to and you sort of, I love the time of

953
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,140
Speaker 3:  It. The timer's great. I use it for playback controls. I like that a lot.

954
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,880
Speaker 5:  The confirmation of face ID is just like so

955
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,480
Speaker 5:  soothing and satisfying. I'm like ooh, that's a nice

956
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,190
Speaker 5:  feeling.

957
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,920
Speaker 4:  I just wanna point out, and I'm just gonna say this, think about how

958
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,570
Speaker 4:  many like major technologies have come out

959
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:49,520
Speaker 4:  in the past five years where at the end of it we're

960
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,240
Speaker 4:  like, boy that was really useful for timers, right?

961
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:53,560
Speaker 4:  Like

962
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,620
Speaker 7:  Alexa,

963
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,160
Speaker 4:  All of Alexa, all of Google assistant, all of

964
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,720
Speaker 3:  Siri, not Siri sir. Sucks at timers. Siri does not get credit for

965
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,800
Speaker 3:  timers.

966
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,560
Speaker 7:  Seriously. Pardon?

967
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,350
Speaker 4:  Seriously, I can't do two things at once. The entire dynamic,

968
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,220
Speaker 4:  like great for timers

969
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,320
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna be happy. The dynamic on and once it tells me the A score,

970
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,800
Speaker 4:  There you go. Right? So the, the API for live activities just hit like this

971
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,640
Speaker 4:  week in 16.1, you know the flighty app, which is the

972
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,600
Speaker 4:  number one app they were showing off. It has been released, it uses the thing.

973
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,560
Speaker 4:  There's some really interesting cooking apps that are doing like the

974
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,520
Speaker 4:  recipe steps on the lock screen with the live

975
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,980
Speaker 4:  activities api. That's cool.

976
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,670
Speaker 5:  The best Reddit app has a little puppy dog

977
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:40,350
Speaker 5:  that runs around the dynamic island.

978
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,800
Speaker 3:  It's pointless but it's very charming.

979
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,600
Speaker 5:  And for a while it was destroying the battery life. It

980
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,680
Speaker 4:  Was great. But none of this makes you buy a phone. It's like all I'm saying

981
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,600
Speaker 4:  no it's, it's none of it is enough to upgrade. And there's

982
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,280
Speaker 4:  probably another year of iteration innovation before it becomes a must

983
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,140
Speaker 4:  have. Whereas I think for a lot of people with the iPhone 11

984
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,440
Speaker 4:  big cheap screen, that's the, that's the thing that will make them upgrade

985
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,320
Speaker 4:  if they have the money to upgrade. Which is I think a lot of people are like,

986
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,160
Speaker 4:  I don't need to spend this money right now. My phone works just fine. And

987
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,840
Speaker 4:  so what Apple's betting on is they can shove ads in everyone's

988
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,530
Speaker 4:  faces or squeeze more money out of more companies

989
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,200
Speaker 4:  by adding fees to more things and increase their money that

990
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,070
Speaker 4:  way. And that's just like, I don't know man,

991
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,320
Speaker 5:  This is kinda like the thing that happened with Meta where these companies

992
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,280
Speaker 5:  both have known this is coming. MEA knew that it was gonna get

993
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,240
Speaker 5:  absolutely bodied when it tossed all of its money into the

994
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,200
Speaker 5:  metaverse and it was trying to prep people for it and it did a terrible job

995
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,790
Speaker 5:  clearly by evidence of Jim Kramer crying on

996
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:44,720
Speaker 5:  television. But Apple knew has known for a

997
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,160
Speaker 5:  while now that that upgrade cycle is getting longer and

998
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,880
Speaker 5:  longer with its customers. People don't wanna do a one year

999
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,360
Speaker 5:  upgrade, they don't wanna do a two year upgrade. They're doing three years,

1000
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,920
Speaker 5:  they're doing four years, they're doing five years and they're getting really,

1001
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,290
Speaker 5:  really comfortable doing that because these devices are no longer like

1002
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:06,200
Speaker 5:  gadgets that are having these huge amazing technological

1003
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,960
Speaker 5:  advancements every year. They're pretty iterative. It's, I think it's the

1004
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,420
Speaker 5:  same thing we've seen with laptops. It's the same thing we've seen with TVs

1005
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,550
Speaker 5:  and honestly appliances.

1006
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,340
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Do you know what's gonna make you upgrade next year?

1007
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,600
Speaker 4:  Say it. That's what I was gonna say. The eu. The eu,

1008
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,440
Speaker 4:  yeah. European bureaucrats are gonna drive the greatest

1009
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,520
Speaker 4:  iPhone upgrade cycle of all time.

1010
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,690
Speaker 7:  They will.

1011
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,350
Speaker 4:  So

1012
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:32,990
Speaker 7:  Unless Apple just makes like what they did in the US this time

1013
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,840
Speaker 7:  with the EIM stuff, unless Apple does, you know, a

1014
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,800
Speaker 7:  sim train Europe plus years we see and enlightening in

1015
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,550
Speaker 7:  America. I don't know like

1016
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:46,520
Speaker 4:  I hope they do that. So let's explain what we're talking about. Notable

1017
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,460
Speaker 4:  Verge trader, Joanna Stern again at the Wall Street Journal Tech live conference

1018
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,920
Speaker 4:  had Greg Jos cred pedigree on stage like half an hour you should go watch

1019
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,040
Speaker 4:  it. Great interview. She, great job. She asked them straight up what's she

1020
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,660
Speaker 4:  gonna do about the eu, her new rap single,

1021
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,600
Speaker 3:  You know she's gonna make a video where she raps about the eu. Now this is

1022
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,920
Speaker 3:  your fault, you just spoke this into

1023
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,400
Speaker 4:  Existence. So she said the EU is gonna mandate usc, what are you gonna do

1024
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,120
Speaker 4:  about it? Jaws react. And actually John Gruber pointed us out. Craig

1025
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,440
Speaker 4:  Fe looks at Jaws and just starts laughing cuz he doesn't, he's the software

1026
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,360
Speaker 4:  guy. He have to answer that question. Jaws react has to answer that question.

1027
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,040
Speaker 4:  So Jas Rack, a friend of the Verge and friend of the VER has Greg

1028
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,880
Speaker 4:  Jaak says obviously we have to comply, we have no

1029
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,720
Speaker 4:  choice. Which is incredible.

1030
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,600
Speaker 4:  He looks super pissed about it, just so salty. Janet ask

1031
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,280
Speaker 4:  when and Ja says the Europeans are the ones dictating timing for

1032
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,240
Speaker 4:  European customers. And then she says, Well you do it everywhere. He says,

1033
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,680
Speaker 4:  I'm not gonna talk about future products. Which is of course what he would

1034
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,620
Speaker 4:  say. So it's true app laws to comply with all local laws,

1035
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:51,280
Speaker 4:  but it's gonna happen. Like they're saying it has to happen and they're not

1036
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,480
Speaker 4:  happy about it. And he gave some examples of things they're not happy about.

1037
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,350
Speaker 4:  He was like, our solution was the power bricks would have removable cords.

1038
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:02,040
Speaker 4:  Sure. It's just so not the right answer. But like that seems

1039
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,760
Speaker 4:  like that's what we wanted. He's like the government tried to mandate all

1040
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,320
Speaker 4:  this hearing aid stuff and it was a disaster and we finally just did it our

1041
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,540
Speaker 4:  way and we gave the government what they wanted with all these pesky regulations.

1042
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:15,480
Speaker 4:  And these are all the arguments that we've heard every time. And it is

1043
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,320
Speaker 4:  also true. I would point out that Apple invented us

1044
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,240
Speaker 4:  bbc, everyone forgets about this. U

1045
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,000
Speaker 4:  BC was a standard effectively developed and pushed by

1046
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,910
Speaker 4:  Apple because they wanted a single port on that first MacBook

1047
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:34,560
Speaker 4:  ages ago. And now their argument is, what if we invent something that's better

1048
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,280
Speaker 4:  than usbc? And it's like, well you could have put USBC on the phones

1049
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,320
Speaker 4:  the whole time and then you could invented a new thing and then we could

1050
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,720
Speaker 4:  have all just move to that but you won't. So we're just like stuck with

1051
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,240
Speaker 4:  lightning. I don't know, it was a, it was a good exchange. You watch the

1052
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,120
Speaker 4:  interview, Joanna did a, like I said, a great job pushing on

1053
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,920
Speaker 4:  it. But Tom, I agree with you. That's the thing that drives the huge upgrade

1054
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,190
Speaker 4:  cycle is this thing got way more convenient to charge.

1055
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:02,920
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I, I think Apple's annoyed at the fact, I don't

1056
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,560
Speaker 7:  think they're annoyed at the fact that they have to do USBC cause that that

1057
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,800
Speaker 7:  was probably in the plans at some point. But they're probably just annoyed

1058
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,600
Speaker 7:  that they're getting dictated on the timing of it. So cuz cuz

1059
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,620
Speaker 7:  they probably could have gone another couple of years with, with Lightning,

1060
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:19,330
Speaker 7:  but now now they're like, we kind of probably have to do this next year year

1061
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:23,120
Speaker 7:  because the legislation comes in for 2024. We don't know exactly

1062
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,080
Speaker 7:  when it, when it sort of cuts in, but yeah, like they kind of need to get

1063
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,960
Speaker 7:  something rolling probably next year on, on the iPhone 15 or

1064
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,280
Speaker 7:  whatever it'll be. So I I don't think that they, they're very happy that

1065
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,520
Speaker 7:  they had to do it then. I mean that's, that's the thing. Like it's not the

1066
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,840
Speaker 7:  fact that they're being, that they have to do PBC cause they probably were

1067
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,720
Speaker 7:  planning to do that. It's it's more being forced to do it at their inconvenience

1068
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,600
Speaker 7:  essentially.

1069
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,560
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I think if, if you're like reading applet leaves here, there was a,

1070
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,390
Speaker 3:  there was a moment where Joss could have made a case about

1071
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:57,240
Speaker 3:  connectors and what people want and instead he picked a fight about

1072
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,480
Speaker 3:  timing. Right. So like, I I think you're exactly right Tom, that like this,

1073
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,200
Speaker 3:  this is less about Apple not wanting to do usbc, which is

1074
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,080
Speaker 3:  like basically every other device Apple makes charges via USBC

1075
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,800
Speaker 3:  now, which is super irritating when I'm in the car or on a plane. That's

1076
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,600
Speaker 3:  a whole different story. But yeah, Apple just does not like being told when

1077
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,200
Speaker 3:  and how to do things. It seems to be like in the, in the

1078
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,320
Speaker 3:  bylaws of going to work at Apple that if anybody tells you to do something

1079
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,200
Speaker 3:  you have to be mad about it for two or

1080
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,760
Speaker 7:  Three years. Yeah. And and I can appreciate some of their arguments where

1081
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,560
Speaker 7:  it's like, you know, let's not forget Lightning was a good connector for

1082
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,200
Speaker 7:  its, its time. Like they sold a lot of the problems that obviously USBC came

1083
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,640
Speaker 7:  along to solve like reversible a lot smaller, all that sort of stuff.

1084
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,360
Speaker 7:  So if they hadn't have done that, if they weren't free to do that, which

1085
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,400
Speaker 7:  is kind of like what they're saying, you know, if there's, there's regulation

1086
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,480
Speaker 7:  around this, it's gonna prevent them from doing this in the future. And I

1087
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:51,360
Speaker 7:  think that's necessarily a hundred percent true, but I could see where they

1088
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,120
Speaker 7:  wouldn't want governments to step in and say you have to have this on this

1089
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,600
Speaker 7:  device, you know, for five years or whatever. Cuz it

1090
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,160
Speaker 7:  does kind of hold that back if they do wanna do that. But

1091
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,640
Speaker 7:  again, it's proprietary

1092
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,960
Speaker 4:  That what Apple's really mad about is the EU did this again and they closed

1093
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,580
Speaker 4:  the loophole. So the EU mandated micro usb

1094
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,210
Speaker 4:  but then Apple just shipped a micro USB to lightning

1095
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:17,860
Speaker 4:  adapter. It was like this little thing they shipped in the box

1096
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:21,800
Speaker 4:  and that got them out of it because technically you could use all your

1097
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,670
Speaker 4:  micro USB accessories and now so the EU said okay we're updating the

1098
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:28,920
Speaker 4:  usbc. Every other manufacturer is like, great, we were already there. Like

1099
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,880
Speaker 4:  who gives shit? And the EU also said you can't ship your stupid

1100
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,450
Speaker 4:  little adapter and Apple is furious

1101
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:37,790
Speaker 3:  Apple's. Like have you seen how many Dons we have?

1102
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,980
Speaker 4:  Like our entire business is $29 doggles. I don't

1103
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,590
Speaker 7:  The wearable accessories revenue

1104
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,080
Speaker 4:  Just

1105
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,930
Speaker 7:  Just gonna plummet.

1106
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:50,880
Speaker 4:  So I, they closed the loophole. I I just think fundamentally I agree

1107
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,600
Speaker 4:  with you David, they just hate being told what to do but they're so behind

1108
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,800
Speaker 4:  on this. Like they invented this connector. It is they

1109
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,600
Speaker 4:  connector they should, they should A done this a long time ago and B,

1110
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,160
Speaker 4:  that next thing you're gonna do is take all the ports off the phone.

1111
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,040
Speaker 4:  Which is, I don't like, I really like MagSafe, I just bought it yet

1112
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,960
Speaker 4:  another MagSafe charger for my car. I'm like addicted to this

1113
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,840
Speaker 4:  thing every time anyone makes it like 5% smaller.

1114
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,480
Speaker 4:  I'm like I'm there for you. But the idea that I'm gonna get a really long

1115
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,070
Speaker 4:  meg safe puck to like use at my house is just ridiculous. Like

1116
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:26,960
Speaker 4:  that part of it is absolutely not ready and cannot charge

1117
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,040
Speaker 3:  Fast enough. Wireless charging is like self-driving cars in that it's been

1118
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,760
Speaker 3:  like 90% done for a really long time and it's gonna be 50 more years before

1119
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,430
Speaker 3:  it actually works the way that it's supposed to.

1120
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:40,200
Speaker 5:  Well it's also like wireless earbuds. Like the AirPods are

1121
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,800
Speaker 5:  great. They are not, they, they don't compare to wired

1122
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,630
Speaker 5:  headphones.

1123
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:48,340
Speaker 4:  I know you guys talked about the new iPad review on Wednesday.

1124
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,800
Speaker 4:  The thing that kills me about it is they took the headphones jack out of

1125
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,280
Speaker 4:  the thing. Yep. Like again, it's just like they don't even make the

1126
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,120
Speaker 4:  product. Like if you these humans greed, it's like

1127
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:03,040
Speaker 4:  well then make kid headphones make AirPods for kids that

1128
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,240
Speaker 4:  work seamlessly instead of being like, now your children will

1129
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,940
Speaker 4:  get insecure Bluetooth headphones that suck

1130
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,160
Speaker 4:  cuz that's what people are gonna buy. They're gonna buy $30 Bluetooth headphones

1131
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,040
Speaker 4:  so kids it suck. And it's like well just be greedy all the

1132
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:21,000
Speaker 4:  way, like all the way greedy Tim just make the kid headphones

1133
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,880
Speaker 4:  you own beats. What are they doing Beats for kids. That's, that's

1134
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,680
Speaker 4:  have at it. What does Dr. Dre think kids' headphones should look like? I'll

1135
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,520
Speaker 4:  buy him as long as they pair seamlessly. And I, I think

1136
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,360
Speaker 4:  there's just, there's a little bit of, I mean they look, they just made a

1137
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,000
Speaker 4:  lot of money. They're selling everything all the time. But doesn't it feel

1138
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,040
Speaker 4:  like they just like lost the plot just like a tiny little bit. Yes. Like

1139
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,920
Speaker 4:  with the, by the way iPad sales are down, I'm guessing cuz people

1140
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,640
Speaker 4:  like look at the iPad lineup, they're like, I don't know what the hell is

1141
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,790
Speaker 4:  going on here. Can I have a MacBook error? And they leave the store.

1142
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:56,490
Speaker 5:  Well the iPad was also their first product where they saw,

1143
01:06:56,490 --> 01:07:00,400
Speaker 5:  oh wait, we can't force people to buy a new one every year. Like

1144
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,960
Speaker 5:  that was the very first one where everybody was like, I have one, I'm gonna

1145
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,310
Speaker 5:  hold onto it for a decade.

1146
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:06,230
Speaker 4:  I mean I think Mac have been like that for a long time.

1147
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:09,350
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's cause they never upgraded the processors on the Mac.

1148
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:09,960
Speaker 4:  That's

1149
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,840
Speaker 3:  True. Well the Mac has recaptured the plot is the funniest thing

1150
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,100
Speaker 3:  about all of this. To me it's like the line is relatively straightforward.

1151
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,880
Speaker 3:  The like Mac Pro's existence continues to be weird, but I think

1152
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,660
Speaker 3:  we'll eventually figure that one out. Like the products kick ass, like

1153
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,200
Speaker 3:  the MacBook error is like, it's very easy for me now to tell people what

1154
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,840
Speaker 3:  computers buy. I just tell people to buy MacBook errors, which was true for

1155
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,800
Speaker 3:  a long time and then not true and now it's true again. And as Apple has really

1156
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,560
Speaker 3:  figured out how to do this again, it like surprised surprise

1157
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,360
Speaker 3:  it's growing really fast and is massively successful again. But then in every

1158
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,760
Speaker 3:  other lineup, especially with the iPad, they're just like, here's some

1159
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,530
Speaker 3:  things. It's just like we, we, we had some parts so we

1160
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:52,760
Speaker 3:  we like closed our eyes and threw them all at the wall and whatever stuck

1161
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,520
Speaker 3:  together, we gave it a name and now you can have it if you want for $500

1162
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,480
Speaker 3:  more than you spent and here's a dongle. Yeah and here's some

1163
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,920
Speaker 5:  Dons. So how many years are we gonna see like the a

1164
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,840
Speaker 5:  15 just recycled over and over again in these things?

1165
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,950
Speaker 5:  Like those, those, those Haswell chips were for a while there.

1166
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:13,720
Speaker 3:  I forever apparently. Yeah. And great news. It's more expensive.

1167
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Oh, so the the other piece of the puzzle, which we have not talked

1168
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,680
Speaker 4:  about a lot and we don't have to dwell on too much, right? The Mac

1169
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,160
Speaker 4:  is doing really well. It's Apple's most open platform in its way.

1170
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:28,080
Speaker 4:  There's so I'm sure people can quibble about it, but the Mac is like, you

1171
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,560
Speaker 4:  usually run an app on it, right? It's like the most open platform you can

1172
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,360
Speaker 4:  do anything you want on it. The idea that apple's there to stand over your

1173
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,440
Speaker 4:  shoulder and just like take 30 cents out of every dollar you spend, like

1174
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,160
Speaker 4:  doesn't exist on the Mac, right? Super exists on iOS

1175
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,760
Speaker 4:  and iPad os, right? It's totally closed platforms. Everyone knows about the

1176
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,480
Speaker 4:  app store this week with iOS 16.1, Apple

1177
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,960
Speaker 4:  updated it's app developer guidelines. The app store

1178
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,720
Speaker 4:  rules Spotify head earnings this week too. Basically Spotify's on the

1179
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,680
Speaker 4:  warpath. They're like, Look, we thought we were gonna do an audiobooks vertical.

1180
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,640
Speaker 4:  We would sell audio books directly in Spotify. We had lawyers on

1181
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,360
Speaker 4:  the product team reading Apple's rules as the product team

1182
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,800
Speaker 4:  developed this, we thought we were in compliance with these rules. Apple

1183
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,580
Speaker 4:  rejected our app like three times and then this week they just pulled

1184
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:17,110
Speaker 4:  the feature and the thing that they pulled was

1185
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:20,800
Speaker 4:  merely telling people that you could buy audiobooks

1186
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,470
Speaker 4:  somewhere else.

1187
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:24,680
Speaker 5:  Well they were sending a link, they were sending an email link,

1188
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,640
Speaker 4:  Right? So you'd push the button and you're like, I want this audiobook. And

1189
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,640
Speaker 4:  Spotify would send you an email with a link to where you could buy it,

1190
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,400
Speaker 3:  Which is itself like a ludicrous solution to this problem. Like that

1191
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,480
Speaker 3:  the fact that that's what Spotify had to do to comply with the rules is

1192
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,460
Speaker 3:  ridiculous.

1193
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,280
Speaker 4:  Yes. This is the, this is like the lead story in a miniseries called When

1194
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:46,160
Speaker 4:  Lawyers Develop Products, Right? Like great, but they had to do it whatever.

1195
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,200
Speaker 4:  And so Apple boots 'em outta the store and they say you can't do it. Then

1196
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,000
Speaker 4:  this week Apple says if you have an app where you

1197
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,720
Speaker 4:  can boost your social media posts, that's an an app purchase.

1198
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,360
Speaker 4:  We wanna piece that pay up beyond 30% of that. This is like a direct

1199
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,120
Speaker 4:  targeted meta because people boost Instagram posts and Facebook posts. You

1200
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,040
Speaker 4:  just like do it right in the app. Apple's like this has always been our rule.

1201
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,880
Speaker 4:  They gave a quote to Heath, he followed up and said,

1202
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,250
Speaker 4:  why'd you have to clarify it then if it was always the rule,

1203
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:17,480
Speaker 4:  No response. Meta is like they're directly taking a shot at your business.

1204
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,080
Speaker 4:  Like Apple is building its own weird ads business and they're trying to undercut

1205
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,520
Speaker 4:  hours by doing this. They already took be with app tracking hints, like this

1206
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,640
Speaker 4:  is just a direct shot at me. Like Apple wants to knife meta, which

1207
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,320
Speaker 5:  We saw that ad business grow this week. And then kind of like

1208
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,640
Speaker 5:  immediately be like, Oh our bad, our bad. Because they started saying, okay,

1209
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,120
Speaker 5:  now you can advertise your app alongside

1210
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,960
Speaker 5:  other apps in the app store. And so there's like, here's my app to

1211
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,940
Speaker 5:  stop gambling addiction next to would you like to gamble a whole lot

1212
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:49,250
Speaker 5:  advertisements? And it's like, oh, that's how bad move Apple.

1213
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,760
Speaker 4:  By the way, this is what happens when you aren't good at tracking. Like if

1214
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,560
Speaker 4:  you don't build the ad business with some amount of

1215
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,200
Speaker 4:  tracking and sophistication, what you do is you do

1216
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,040
Speaker 4:  blunt force keyword targeting. And so

1217
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,560
Speaker 4:  people type in gambling and you get the gambling

1218
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,360
Speaker 4:  addiction recovery app and the gambling app and it's like

1219
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,640
Speaker 4:  this is what makes, makes internet advertising hard, right? You you want

1220
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,000
Speaker 4:  these like fine grain controls, they're required know more about people on,

1221
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,720
Speaker 4:  on and on,

1222
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,480
Speaker 3:  Whatever. Marco Armand was tweeting about how basically the targeting does

1223
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,320
Speaker 3:  work. And the idea is that you can advertise your app in three

1224
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,120
Speaker 3:  ways. You can do similar categories, which is basically like show people

1225
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,840
Speaker 3:  who like things like my app, my app, you can do all

1226
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,400
Speaker 3:  ca at all categories, which is all relevant app categories, which is how

1227
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,990
Speaker 3:  you get the like gambling addiction equals gambling

1228
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:44,360
Speaker 3:  mess. And then you can do other categories, which is just like show some

1229
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:48,120
Speaker 3:  people my app. Like I just, it is just not a good system.

1230
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,200
Speaker 3:  Like it's, it's this is suddenly you understand why

1231
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,050
Speaker 3:  targeting advertising is like a useful and good thing that people

1232
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,540
Speaker 3:  do to make money.

1233
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:00,400
Speaker 5:  And it's like there's two very good ways of doing advertising.

1234
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,320
Speaker 5:  There's have people curate it and that's a lovely usually nice

1235
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,080
Speaker 5:  way of advertising. And then there's invade people's

1236
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,420
Speaker 5:  lives so much that you know what they want before they do

1237
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:15,270
Speaker 5:  and advertise that. And Apple was like, we're gonna do a

1238
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:18,830
Speaker 5:  half-ass middle road, which is very un apple.

1239
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:22,440
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Apple was like all of our playlists are made by humans, but our ads,

1240
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,000
Speaker 3:  we don't really know, we just kind of make it up as we go along.

1241
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,440
Speaker 7:  But they, but they've been gradually creeping towards this sort of scenario

1242
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,140
Speaker 7:  for, for a couple of years. Like right, the ads that they actually put into

1243
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,800
Speaker 7:  iOS that so, you know, get Apple Arcade or get Apple Music,

1244
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,840
Speaker 7:  they're, they're kind of gross as it is. They're terrible. But then they,

1245
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,640
Speaker 7:  they also have started allowing developers to push their notifications as

1246
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,440
Speaker 7:  as basically as marketing ads. Some of them you can't even disable.

1247
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,240
Speaker 7:  So like, like Uber does it a lot. Uber Eats and Uber. You have to dig into

1248
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,790
Speaker 7:  the settings and disable their, their crappy marketing notifications.

1249
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,120
Speaker 5:  Uber keeps telling me that I have 250

1250
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,800
Speaker 5:  Taiwanese dollars credit that I can use at any

1251
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,990
Speaker 5:  point. Never gonna use it.

1252
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:06,880
Speaker 4:  I will say the ads in the setting screen, they

1253
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,520
Speaker 4:  have somewhat improved them and made them a little less grish in I was

1254
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,380
Speaker 4:  16. There's still a red bubble that says too when you open settings

1255
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:18,320
Speaker 4:  but it's, it is now inside of a line that says

1256
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,000
Speaker 4:  services included with a purchase instead of just the straight up tout that's

1257
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,690
Speaker 4:  like you can play games on your iPhone four ninety nine.

1258
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:29,040
Speaker 5:  They're just kind of undercutting their own arguments over and over and over

1259
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,400
Speaker 5:  again on advertising because they've been going after meta for a long time

1260
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,200
Speaker 5:  being like, we don't do what they do, we're better. We don't

1261
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,590
Speaker 5:  track you. We are honest and ethical.

1262
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:43,480
Speaker 5:  Ignore all these kind of scummy, borderline unethical things we're doing

1263
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:47,350
Speaker 5:  to get you to like buy Apple Arcade. That's different.

1264
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,720
Speaker 5:  That's us. We just care.

1265
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think the app store, there's like a lot of fine arguments in

1266
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,280
Speaker 4:  like the notification like in the marketing, the

1267
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,200
Speaker 4:  services and the platform they own. Yeah, okay. Like very fine grain, very

1268
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:03,160
Speaker 4:  nuanced arguments. We rolled out an ad platform in the app

1269
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,920
Speaker 4:  store that we totally control where your only point of contact with your

1270
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,800
Speaker 4:  customer is your app page on the app store and now

1271
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,720
Speaker 4:  we're gonna sell parts of that page to other people to try to get

1272
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,200
Speaker 4:  them away from your thing into their thing. That's just

1273
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,960
Speaker 4:  rude, right? Like that's just like straight up. Like

1274
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,800
Speaker 4:  there are very few other retailers who will just openly undercut

1275
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,640
Speaker 4:  you to make a little bit more money. But Apple's now at the

1276
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,840
Speaker 4:  scale where that's the choice they have to make. This is like meta is like

1277
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,400
Speaker 4:  meta is like way out over at skis. I'm not saying Apple's anywhere close

1278
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,160
Speaker 4:  to this. They're just at the point of I'll put Google

1279
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,710
Speaker 4:  search in this category. There's just a handful of these companies

1280
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:46,560
Speaker 4:  that are so big that they don't really have to

1281
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,560
Speaker 4:  care about the user experience. And I'm not saying that's everywhere with

1282
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,160
Speaker 4:  Apple. I think that's true. Like the Max are really good in a

1283
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,600
Speaker 4:  max super competitive environment all the time. The phone

1284
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,120
Speaker 4:  generally is very good in a super competitive environment all the

1285
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,080
Speaker 4:  time. But when Apple has to market apps who, there's nothing

1286
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,800
Speaker 4:  there, they can just be whatever kind of rude Goliath they want. When

1287
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,640
Speaker 4:  Google is like, what should the search page look like? Yeah, it's whatever

1288
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,600
Speaker 4:  useless garbage Google wants to put there, right?

1289
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,560
Speaker 4:  Facebook is feeling it. Like the products got so big they

1290
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,200
Speaker 4:  took them for granted, TikTok showed up with a better user

1291
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,640
Speaker 4:  experience for the stuff and now everyone's like, yeah I'm just gonna use,

1292
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,400
Speaker 4:  it's like more fun than whatever garbage is happening on Facebook. And I

1293
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,880
Speaker 4:  that that is like, you know, this is the argument against antitrust laws

1294
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,560
Speaker 4:  is eventually the Giants will just collapse on their own because they're

1295
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,000
Speaker 4:  monopolies and people will be like, screw this, the products are bad. But

1296
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,600
Speaker 4:  it's also like you could just make them compete. You could just do a little

1297
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,560
Speaker 4:  work to make them compete a little bit more. And Apple, right now at the

1298
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,910
Speaker 4:  app store, I hope they see like the danger is

1299
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:54,400
Speaker 4:  they did another one, another one of their apps

1300
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,230
Speaker 4:  rules updates was they clarified this rule

1301
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:02,120
Speaker 4:  that NFTs or digital purchases, which like, I

1302
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,920
Speaker 4:  don't whatever, but like, but if you just like do the math on that,

1303
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,490
Speaker 4:  right? So let's say you're playing a game and the whole promise of an NFT

1304
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:13,240
Speaker 4:  is that you would like buy a skin in the game, right? You would buy a skin

1305
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,720
Speaker 4:  in, in Fortnite, not iOS, but use Fortnite example, you're gonna buy a Fortnite

1306
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:20,520
Speaker 4:  skin and now you own it and you can sell it, right?

1307
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,360
Speaker 4:  This is the whole promise of the NFT marketplace is that you would just like

1308
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,920
Speaker 4:  buy a digital item and then you own it and you could like sell it. So let's

1309
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,680
Speaker 4:  say you buy it from Fortnite, you B you buy a Fortnite skin from Epic

1310
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:35,600
Speaker 4:  for $10 and now you own it and you wanna sell it on

1311
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,920
Speaker 4:  another marketplace. Well you've automatically lost

1312
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,840
Speaker 4:  30% of the value of the thing, even if you sell it for $10

1313
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,280
Speaker 4:  back to someone else. Because Apple is now saying in their

1314
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,760
Speaker 4:  rules, and if t sales are in at purchases, you gotta give them

1315
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,390
Speaker 4:  30% so that apple's just like flatly,

1316
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:57,320
Speaker 4:  just like effectively removed this from existing on iOS.

1317
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,310
Speaker 3:  Well what's crazy is like the math on that particular transaction means

1318
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:04,910
Speaker 3:  Epic would've made $7, you would've

1319
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:08,680
Speaker 3:  lost $3 and Apple would've made $6 in

1320
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,440
Speaker 3:  that transaction. Like Apple. It's insane.

1321
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,960
Speaker 3:  Like the the and all all of the like, you know, Web

1322
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,520
Speaker 3:  three nft people I follow on Twitter and stuff are like up in arms about

1323
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,800
Speaker 3:  this because they're, they're like, you just basically just like

1324
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,640
Speaker 3:  obliterated the liquidity of this market because now buying and selling is

1325
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,480
Speaker 3:  now dangerous because you've just devalued everything by at

1326
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,920
Speaker 3:  least 30%. It

1327
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,240
Speaker 4:  Will definitely not happen on the phone. The very least they've guaranteed

1328
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,600
Speaker 4:  that whatever innovation happens in this area, assuming the innovation happens

1329
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,320
Speaker 4:  where it's good or useful, whatever. Right. They've

1330
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,360
Speaker 4:  guaranteed it will not occur on the phone. Yeah, right. It's just like what

1331
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,760
Speaker 4:  happened there. The same way they've guaranteed that whatever innovation

1332
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,730
Speaker 4:  happens in game streaming will not happen on their phone. And that's,

1333
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:55,600
Speaker 4:  to me these are like, these are the ideas whether you love them

1334
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,520
Speaker 4:  or hate them, These are ideas that people are very excited

1335
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,360
Speaker 5:  About. I was gonna say, I wanna know what like what Apple and Google, but

1336
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,880
Speaker 5:  especially Apple knows about Congress that the rest of us don't. That they

1337
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,840
Speaker 5:  can be so confident this week with all of these deeply, deeply

1338
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,760
Speaker 5:  unpopular rules that they were like scaling back on last year when they thought

1339
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,720
Speaker 5:  they were gonna get regulated into oblivion and now they're like, Nope, we're

1340
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,830
Speaker 5:  firing both barrels. We're going balls to the wall.

1341
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:23,560
Speaker 3:  It's just scoreboard, right? Like it's you, you, it's what it is.

1342
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,520
Speaker 3:  Like he walks in and it's like the, the sort of overarching assumption

1343
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,040
Speaker 3:  is that like Congress is gonna be taken by the Republicans, which means there's

1344
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,320
Speaker 3:  probably gonna be less energy focused in this direction. Like any, like Tim

1345
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,760
Speaker 3:  Cook just walks in and he's like, What do you have to show me from the last

1346
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,440
Speaker 3:  four years of energy around this? Like, let's just keep pushing. I, I feel

1347
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,520
Speaker 3:  like it's just the, it's like the pragmatic decision to make at some point.

1348
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,360
Speaker 7:  What do you guys think about TikTok getting games? Cause that's,

1349
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,480
Speaker 7:  that's apparently that's gonna be announced next week.

1350
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,470
Speaker 3:  TikTok is like edged into this space for a while now and I feel like

1351
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:58,140
Speaker 3:  it's one of those things that TikTok is either going to

1352
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:01,990
Speaker 3:  try to do so much stuff. It like breaks the thing up that makes the app fun.

1353
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:05,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Or it's going to win in a big, huge way. And I feel the

1354
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,120
Speaker 3:  same way about Netflix getting into gaming. It's like there's an adjacency

1355
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,680
Speaker 3:  there that makes total sense to me. And there's also a thing that's like

1356
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,600
Speaker 3:  maybe you fundamentally misunderstand why people are coming to your app and

1357
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,600
Speaker 3:  I don't know which one of those it is and I think it's gonna be fascinating

1358
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,120
Speaker 3:  to find out, but TikTok is like, it's another one that it's like, oh remember

1359
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,000
Speaker 3:  how you were gonna ban us over and over and over and over every single day

1360
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,840
Speaker 3:  for like four years? Remember how we're still kicking all y'all's asses?

1361
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,720
Speaker 3:  Like, come at me bro. Here comes games. That's

1362
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,150
Speaker 3:  like, that's how I imagine TikTok

1363
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:36,810
Speaker 7:  Tick's fascinating for the future of wherever there's mobile innovation.

1364
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:40,640
Speaker 7:  Because obviously Apple doesn't want rival app stores, which is

1365
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,960
Speaker 7:  exactly why cloud streaming isn't there. Cause they don't, they don't want

1366
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,730
Speaker 7:  those, those stores of stores cuz it frightens them obviously, but

1367
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:51,120
Speaker 7:  is like a platform within itself. And it is, it's

1368
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,720
Speaker 7:  basically everyone's just using it. Like people use it to search their

1369
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,240
Speaker 7:  recipes. You know, like he kids aren't going to Google search,

1370
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,460
Speaker 7:  they're staying within the Ward gardens of TikTok.

1371
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:04,240
Speaker 3:  You know, who can cut all that stuff off at the knees? Is Apple like's gonna

1372
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:08,200
Speaker 3:  do, music's gonna do games and Apple time it feels like can just

1373
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,560
Speaker 3:  be like, No, no, we'll take 30% of that. Thank

1374
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,480
Speaker 4:  You. So at the code conference, you know, Tim Cook was on stage with

1375
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,440
Speaker 4:  Lauren Powell jobs and Johnny Ivan, it was Kara's last code and the

1376
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,960
Speaker 4:  vibe was not be mean to tick Tim Cook. Like they were all there to talk about

1377
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,920
Speaker 4:  Steve Jobs, but I'm still me. You know, So like ask him like what do

1378
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,600
Speaker 4:  you think about TikTok? Like the Chinese app TikTok by the way is burning

1379
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,440
Speaker 4:  cash. Like this is not a public company. We have no idea how much

1380
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:36,320
Speaker 4:  money bite dance is spending to make TikTok the winner. How much money the

1381
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,000
Speaker 4:  Chinese government is spending to make TikTok the winner. Like there's an

1382
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,080
Speaker 4:  element of this whole competition is deeply unfair cuz we can't, we can't

1383
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,440
Speaker 4:  see if TikTok is profitable or if the Chinese government just thinks it's

1384
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:50,040
Speaker 4:  a good investment to have every American teen in their algorithm or

1385
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,150
Speaker 7:  How accurate those view counts are.

1386
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:56,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We just dunno. But whatever. It's popular, it's growing. There's

1387
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,440
Speaker 4:  all this noise about bite dance. So I asked Tim Cook like, what do you think

1388
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,190
Speaker 4:  about TikTok? And he is like, I'm not an expert on TikTok. And

1389
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:06,680
Speaker 4:  I have been thinking about that answer ever since. Like, I

1390
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:10,600
Speaker 4:  regret not immediately following up and saying, you have not

1391
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,400
Speaker 4:  used the most popular app on your platform because it's wild to

1392
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,480
Speaker 4:  me that that was his answer. That he was like, I don't know what's going

1393
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,400
Speaker 4:  on with this app. It seems fine because it is closer to

1394
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,680
Speaker 4:  the everything app that like Elon Musk wants to build Twitter

1395
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,080
Speaker 4:  into. It does have all these like weird data

1396
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,840
Speaker 4:  concerns. I have heard, this is completely unsourced, don't take this

1397
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,080
Speaker 4:  for real, but like yeah, I've definitely heard about TikTok employees who

1398
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:38,110
Speaker 4:  put their phones in airplane mode when they like leave the office. Like,

1399
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:42,040
Speaker 4:  like there's like a thing with TikTok, like there's a weirdness about

1400
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:45,520
Speaker 4:  it. I can't source that. I don't know if that's real, but it's under

1401
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,510
Speaker 4:  scrutinized and Apple has the, the power to

1402
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:52,880
Speaker 4:  scrutinize it and they like won't take it. That's weird, right?

1403
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,080
Speaker 4:  Meanwhile they're like, meta let's kill it.

1404
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Just destroy it. Well I think they, they are obligated to

1405
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,660
Speaker 5:  work with China and China has made it very clear every single time.

1406
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:07,360
Speaker 5:  And I've spoken with like experts on, on on how, how

1407
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,960
Speaker 5:  China works on this. When I was doing a story about Huawei before Huawei

1408
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,620
Speaker 5:  got bodied by the American government,

1409
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:18,600
Speaker 5:  and if you are operating in China and your business is based in China and

1410
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,480
Speaker 5:  China wants you to do something about your business, you do it. It's not

1411
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,800
Speaker 5:  like, let me think about it. It's like you do it or you get fond, bing

1412
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,760
Speaker 5:  binged away for a couple of months until you, you come back

1413
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,720
Speaker 5:  and you do it like authoritarian regime. You just,

1414
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:37,520
Speaker 5:  you do what they say and TikTok existing there is

1415
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,320
Speaker 5:  a little like unnerving and Apple just being like, Yeah, whatever is,

1416
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,310
Speaker 5:  because Apple needs China. Yeah. Desperately.

1417
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, and this is a, every time we do earnings, we have to go look

1418
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,520
Speaker 4:  at their exposure to China, how well the cells are doing in China. So like

1419
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:54,480
Speaker 4:  there's just all this stuff throwing around Apple. But I again, I would just

1420
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,480
Speaker 4:  put some of this iOS stuff, these rule changes, these unhappy

1421
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,440
Speaker 4:  developers Google search getting sort of like increased. You know

1422
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,250
Speaker 4:  why people use TikTok search instead of Google search? Cause you get just

1423
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:08,720
Speaker 4:  faster results on a TikTok. David, you did it for a while, right?

1424
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:12,290
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's, it's just more fun. Like it's,

1425
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:16,170
Speaker 3:  which is, which is half of what searching is, right? You're like, I don't,

1426
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:18,090
Speaker 3:  I'm not trying to figure out like, but

1427
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:21,090
Speaker 5:  How many of the recipes end in an air fryer?

1428
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:24,660
Speaker 3:  Oh, like three quarters of them. And, and the other quarter is terrible

1429
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:28,530
Speaker 3:  recipes that other people are telling you not to make, but making

1430
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:31,570
Speaker 3:  funny jokes about like it's, it's just wins all the way around. And it's

1431
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:35,290
Speaker 3:  like, if I just wanna like watch some videos about a band I like,

1432
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:38,730
Speaker 3:  TikTok is infinitely better at that than Google. But still, like Apple is

1433
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:42,250
Speaker 3:  in this place where it, it is so in charge of how this stuff works on its

1434
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:46,090
Speaker 3:  own platform that I don't know. It it, and it is coming from such a place

1435
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:50,050
Speaker 3:  of confidence that it kind of feels like Apple is just going to

1436
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:53,410
Speaker 3:  keep tightening and tightening and tightening the ropes until somebody makes

1437
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:56,280
Speaker 3:  it stop. And it sure doesn't seem to think anybody's gonna make it stop.

1438
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,170
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Or it's like we gotta squeeze as hard as we can so when someone

1439
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,120
Speaker 4:  makes it stop, we've collected all the money we can.

1440
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,450
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's it's probably both of those, right? Like it's, it's a win-win

1441
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:06,600
Speaker 3:  for Apple at the moment.

1442
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,490
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All right. We have gone way over also, I will just point

1443
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:13,850
Speaker 4:  this out as we've been recording, apparently Twitter sent an email to all

1444
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:17,660
Speaker 4:  staff saying there's an all staff meeting at 7:35 PM tonight West Coast.

1445
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:21,450
Speaker 4:  So all you East Coast Twitter employees, you're gonna find out what's going

1446
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:25,060
Speaker 4:  on at 11:00 PM tonight. We've got an entire emergency

1447
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,810
Speaker 4:  episode of The Verge has coming. When that deal closes or doesn't

1448
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:32,210
Speaker 4:  close, we'll do that tomorrow. We wanted to get this one out. Thank you for

1449
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:35,930
Speaker 4:  listening Tom, thank you for joining us. No worries. We have forgotten to

1450
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:39,530
Speaker 4:  talk about the EIN display with a 16 megapixel rear camera. That's

1451
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:40,450
Speaker 5:  For next week. That's

1452
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,530
Speaker 3:  For next week. Yeah. This is why we have two verge casts a week. We have

1453
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:43,650
Speaker 3:  plenty of time to talk about

1454
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:47,580
Speaker 5:  That. 5 99. It's the Onyx books. Don't get it. That's a bad idea.

1455
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:51,410
Speaker 4:  Amazing. Josh Jeza, who many of you will

1457
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:59,130
Speaker 4:  about the fight in Puerto Rico to turn the power back on. It

1458
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:02,650
Speaker 4:  is a complicated adventure of a tale through the

1459
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:06,450
Speaker 4:  bureaucracy with real stakes. Go read that. It's just excellent

1460
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:10,250
Speaker 4:  work that's on the site. We'll be back on Wednesday and then,
