00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,540

Speaker 3:  Hello, I'm welcome to Vergecast. The flagship podcast of the

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,380
Speaker 3:  studio kind of smelled like weed.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,220
Speaker 3:  You

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,500
Speaker 6:  What? You guys do it in there?

26
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,500
Speaker 3:  We weren't doing anything. What I said to David as we walked in

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,180
Speaker 3:  was bet that Kara Swisher was in here with her new V Media

28

00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,100
Speaker 3:  That's, that's what happens. Y'all want me to plug the show? I'm gonna mention

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,900
Speaker 3:  that it smells like weed. Yeah, go subscribe to on with Kara

00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,700
Speaker 3:  Don't mention the weed thing to anyone that I report to.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,060
Speaker 1:  Yes, Dear listener, There's no evidence to back up Eli's claim.

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,140
Speaker 3:  Thanks Liam.

36
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,220

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,220
Speaker 3:  or Liam, We

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,540
Speaker 6:  Haven't even finished the intro. We've already done the disclaimer.

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,500
Speaker 3:  That's great. That's great. Hi everybody. I'm your friend Eli. David Pierce

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,620
Speaker 3:  is here. Hi. I'm sitting right next to you. Yeah, we're, This is very exciting.

41
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,500
Speaker 3:  We're together in New York City, which hasn't happened in quite some time.

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,180
Speaker 3:  No, and it smells like weed. I dunno if we've talked about that yet. I think

43
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,060
Speaker 3:  that might just be New York City. It's very possible. There's a

44
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,940
Speaker 3:  real chance. It's just the city wafting into the office. Alex Kranz

45
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,820
Speaker 3:  also New York City, but, But at her home,

46
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,020
Speaker 6:  I am at my home smoking weed just furiously in the middle of

47
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,940
Speaker 6:  this podcast so I can feel like I'm there in the office with you. Yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,760
Speaker 3:  That's great. That's good. She's got her Plex server. She's, Do you use the

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,440
Speaker 3:  Plex server to heat the weed? Are you like a, Is that a multi, multi-functional

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,240
Speaker 3:  vape situation?

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah, you know, it gets hot enough.

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,600
Speaker 3:  It's it possible that like firing up the Plex server is like a euphemism

53
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,880
Speaker 3:  for Alex smoking food and every time she talks about the Plex server, that's

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,040
Speaker 3:  actually the time thing. Yeah,

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Speaker 6:  It's actually a bong. It's

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,280
Speaker 3:  Great. It's good. No, you gotta, you gotta heat it so you heat the crystals.

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,440
Speaker 3:  It's, it vaporizes the weed. It doesn't burn. It clicks

58
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,400
Speaker 3:  streamer in the future. All right. There's been a quite a lot

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,320
Speaker 3:  going on this week in Tech news in addition to whatever happened in

60
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,120
Speaker 3:  the studio earlier today, which was very chill. It's been a big week for

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
Speaker 3:  everybody. It's been a big week for everybody. Yeah.

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,240
Speaker 6:  Everybody's having a great time

63
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,280
Speaker 3:  On with Kara Swisher. Now part of the V podcast network MediConnect was this

64
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,880
Speaker 3:  week we, you all did a whole episode about Medic Connect. We should talk

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,560
Speaker 3:  about it just a little bit. There's the VR people have Legs now. The new

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,280
Speaker 3:  Quest Pro is out. We Google reviews hit, so the Pixel Watch

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,920
Speaker 3:  review Pixel seven, Pixel seven Pro and then Microsoft

68
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,120
Speaker 3:  just announced everything that it had. It just was like, Is anybody

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,760
Speaker 3:  at Microsoft have something to announce? Today's the day. And they did it

70
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,760
Speaker 3:  like all at once. So you got new Surface Studio two

71
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,840
Speaker 3:  plus Surface Pro Nine. It's 10 years of Surface by

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,920
Speaker 6:  The way, crucial Microsoft Teams news. Crucial

73
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,360
Speaker 3:  Teams news. They rebranded Office to Microsoft 365,

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,760
Speaker 3:  which something. But Tom sat down with Panas Pane, talked about

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,400
Speaker 3:  10 years of Surface, Surface laptop, five, I mean just everything you can

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,480
Speaker 3:  think of. Sasha just walked around Redman saying, Does anybody have anything

77
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,080
Speaker 3:  to announce? And then Microsoft Teams came out and they said, We have

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,080
Speaker 3:  Microsoft Teams to announce

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,960
Speaker 6:  Somebody walked behind him and took notes.

80
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,920
Speaker 3:  That second step is very important. Sasha walks around and says, What do

81
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,560
Speaker 3:  you have to announce? And then they tell him and he says, How does teams

82
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,240
Speaker 3:  figure into this? And then they tell him and then they get to announce it.

83
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Speaker 3:  Microsoft announced so much stuff. They announced stuff at Facebook's event.

84
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

85
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,000
Speaker 3:  It just spilled over. They're like, This is our event too.

86
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,680
Speaker 3:  So let's, let's quickly start with Meta Connect. We, y'all did a whole

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,240
Speaker 3:  episode on it already so we don't have to overdo it. But Quest Pro two kind

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,200
Speaker 3:  of looks incredible, also kind of looks like an expensive boondoggle.

89
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,240
Speaker 3:  Like I can't tell. Yeah, both of those things are true at the same time,

90
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,440
Speaker 3:  Right? Like it is by all accounts, very impressive. The facial expression

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,800
Speaker 3:  tracking seems to be pretty good. The pass through video seems to be pretty

92
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,040
Speaker 3:  good. The overwhelming question is like, what is this for? And who's going

93
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,320
Speaker 3:  to buy it? And there are a bunch of people on Twitter who are like, How dare

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,280
Speaker 3:  you not love the future? I can't wait to spend $1,500 on the Quest Pro.

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,760
Speaker 3:  And then it's like, what are you gonna do with it? And they're like, Well,

96
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,960
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna have it. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's how I, I almost pre-ordered

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,840
Speaker 3:  one. I came so close to pre-ordering one yesterday

98
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,320
Speaker 3:  just

99
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,040
Speaker 6:  To have, So you could just play like Supernatural and, and beat Saber, but

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,840
Speaker 6:  in slightly higher resolution. But

101
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,560
Speaker 3:  So there's that. So we, we use our Quest two like almost

102
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Speaker 3:  every day to do Supernatural. It's great. Love it. Yeah. Almost nothing

103
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,400
Speaker 3:  else happens in the VR headset so that whatever. But then you know,

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,960
Speaker 3:  you look at the white boardy thing that they did. So that controllers are

105
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Speaker 3:  really cool. They have, the controllers now have their own sensors. So the

106
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,200
Speaker 3:  controllers have their own sense of where they are in a room. They do their

107
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,680
Speaker 3:  own inside out tracking and they have all these haptics. So Add and

108
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,320
Speaker 3:  Alex Heath who both got to use the thing were like, it actually feels like

109
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,200
Speaker 3:  you're pushing the controller against something when you write. Yeah. And

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Speaker 3:  the bottoms you can screw in Little Stylist tips. You gotta love this

111
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,240
Speaker 3:  virtual e ink drawing tablets.

112
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,680
Speaker 6:  Come on. Yeah, I mean it brings me a lot of joy. Like I, I think, I think

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,240
Speaker 6:  the Quest Pro is very, very cool. But I was

114
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
Speaker 6:  thinking about this earlier this week. You know, we're coming up on the,

115
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,560
Speaker 6:  what was it, the 30th anniversary of the Lisa

116
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,480
Speaker 6:  No, 40th. Yeah,

117
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,120
Speaker 3:  It's

118
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,080
Speaker 6:  Old. The Apple Lisa, which like the Quest Pro

119
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,840
Speaker 6:  was super, super cool and did a lot of really cool stuff that hadn't really

120
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,400
Speaker 6:  been done before. And like the Quest Pro was super, super

121
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,240
Speaker 6:  expensive and unlike the Quest Pro ended up being buried in

122
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,120
Speaker 6:  like a landfill somewhere in Utah. Yeah. But I think like,

123
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,960
Speaker 6:  I just keep thinking about that and like how, how expensive this thing

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,520
Speaker 6:  is and how cutting edge it is and how it's probably a little too cutting

125
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,000
Speaker 6:  edge. It's probably not quite ready. Like the audience doesn't quite exist,

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,240
Speaker 6:  but,

127
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,200
Speaker 3:  But, but the, Lisa was supposed to be like a real product for Apple,

128
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,160
Speaker 3:  right? This was like Steve Jobs thing before the Mac and then back and forth.

129
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,040
Speaker 3:  And then he cruelly abandoned the Lisa took

130
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,560
Speaker 6:  So long on to do the Mac that he had to like get kicked off to do the Mac.

131
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,960
Speaker 6:  They were like, Stop, stop messing with Lisa. You suck at it. Yeah. Go do

132
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,480
Speaker 6:  the Mac. And you just took all the best ideas and was like, here's the Mac.

133
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,680
Speaker 3:  Yeah. They made it and we all smaller, cheaper one. Notably the Mac also

134
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,520
Speaker 3:  came from Apple. So like the lease is a disaster, but it's a disaster. It's

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,560
Speaker 3:  sort of like almost thank Apple cuz they were betting too much on it, but

136
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,040
Speaker 3:  then they refactored everything into the cheaper Mac and they did it right?

137
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,720
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Z is not positioning the Quest Pro is the

138
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,680
Speaker 3:  future of meta. He's like, I've taken yet another

139
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,480
Speaker 3:  small step to my dream of permanently surveilling you in virtual

140
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,360
Speaker 3:  reality. And here's the most advanced headset.

141
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,200
Speaker 3:  And he has given a version of the speech now several times. He gave it to

142
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,600
Speaker 3:  Joe Rogan, he gave it to Alex Heath. He's, I've heard him say this thing.

143
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,680
Speaker 3:  He's coming at it from two directions. Yeah. So one,

144
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,120
Speaker 3:  they are coming at sort of ar or mixed reality

145
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,960
Speaker 3:  from we're gonna pack all the technology into the biggest headset we can

146
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,920
Speaker 3:  design and build, but it'll have all the tech in it. Yeah. And that's the

147
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,400
Speaker 3:  Quest Pro. And then we're gonna make glasses that can actually fit your head

148
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,320
Speaker 3:  and shove as much into that form factor. And over time those things will

149
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,320
Speaker 3:  converge. So he is basically got like Ray bands or the camera over here and

150
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,000
Speaker 3:  he is got the Quest Pro over here that can actually do mixed reality.

151
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,720
Speaker 3:  And his plan is they'll meet in the middle. I don't know why he

152
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,880
Speaker 3:  thinks that's the right approach. Like you should just say, you know, like,

153
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,960
Speaker 3:  so I kind of think it is. I mean the, the reality is if you're,

154
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,880
Speaker 3:  if you're doing it from one side, you're also doing the other side. You

155
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,520
Speaker 3:  just don't ship it. Right? You just, that's the stuff that like lives in

156
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,560
Speaker 3:  the labs that you make for a long time and it's a, it's a big prototype and

157
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,600
Speaker 3:  then you make it a smaller prototype and then eventually you can ship it

158
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,160
Speaker 3:  inside of the thing. But the other thing Meta is trying to do is make all

159
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,000
Speaker 3:  of the rest of this stuff happen. So like they need stuff to be out there,

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,880
Speaker 3:  there for developers to play with. They need people to be like dreaming up

161
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,760
Speaker 3:  cool new apps. They need all of this stuff to happen all at once. So if they're

162
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,400
Speaker 3:  to sit there inside until they can fit all of this tech into RayBan

163
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,640
Speaker 3:  glasses, they're gonna be way too early because they won't have given anybody

164
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,800
Speaker 3:  anything to do or anything to work with. So I kind of feel like, but why

165
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,320
Speaker 3:  ship the RayBan glasses? That I think is a more fair question,

166
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,960
Speaker 3:  but I That's what I mean. It's like

167
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,680
Speaker 6:  I think the RayBan glasses make sense though because that was part of their

168
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120
Speaker 6:  attempt to normalize

169
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,520
Speaker 3:  Cameras on your face.

170
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,360
Speaker 6:  The surveillance. Yeah. Like, right. Like that's the entire point of it

171
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,920
Speaker 6:  is like, let's normalize cameras on your face because if we want ar to work

172
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Speaker 6:  in the future, people have to be comfortable being constantly surveilled

173
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,360
Speaker 6:  by everyone around them at all times.

174
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

175
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,240
Speaker 6:  And like I, I mean I do kind of think that that that idea of

176
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,200
Speaker 6:  everything meet in the middle makes sense. But also why do

177
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,960
Speaker 6:  I wanna spend $1,500 to be a beta tester if I'm a developer

178
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,760
Speaker 6:  who's, who's really excited about the future of vr that Quest Pro makes sense.

179
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,120
Speaker 6:  Are there enough of those developers to make the Quest Pro a

180
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,440
Speaker 6:  success?

181
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,720
Speaker 3:  No. And that's why you sign up Microsoft Yep. To throw the

182
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,960
Speaker 3:  HoloLens out the window and put Microsoft Teams

183
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,120
Speaker 3:  on the Quest Pro and then you sign up Accenture. Yeah. And you have the CEO

184
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,680
Speaker 3:  of Accenture in hologram at your event being like,

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,240
Speaker 3:  we're gonna do corporate training in the metaverse using Quest. Like

186
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,520
Speaker 3:  they are making a full on enterprise play Yeah. With

187
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,960
Speaker 3:  this product. But not which fine. Because this is the thing that has driven

188
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,280
Speaker 3:  me the most crazy about all these announcements is everybody has come out

189
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,760
Speaker 3:  and said, you know, Microsoft and meta believe VR is the future of work.

190
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,600
Speaker 3:  Like no, they don't, They absolutely do not think that Sahi Nadella

191
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,480
Speaker 3:  even said to Ben Thompson that like, this might be a thing that you own,

192
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,960
Speaker 3:  but this is not going to be like your primary device. You'll also have a

193
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,520
Speaker 3:  laptop, you'll also have a phone. What this is is like a pretty naked attempt

194
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,360
Speaker 3:  to make a thing that someone will pay for, Right? Like yeah, Google made

195
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,120
Speaker 3:  glass and it failed. And so Google went Google Glass Enterprise

196
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,960
Speaker 3:  and then they sold some people. And that's just like, that's a, that's a

197
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,200
Speaker 3:  thing you do when you can't get consumers to buy your device. You come up

198
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,640
Speaker 3:  with this really narrow work thing and try to sell it that way. And it turns

199
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,360
Speaker 3:  out that companies love to burn money on fancy cool new technology

200
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,560
Speaker 3:  that gets them in press releases from companies like Netta and Microsoft.

201
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,560
Speaker 3:  And so this is, this is like a, a stepping stone to get from

202
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,080
Speaker 3:  here to there. And I think anyone who is like, everybody thinks the

203
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,400
Speaker 3:  first killer app for VR is work. No.

204
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,000
Speaker 3:  It just isn't. And none of the companies building this think that they just

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,120
Speaker 3:  think this is a way for them to make some money while they continue to build

206
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,760
Speaker 3:  deeply imperfect products into ones that actually work for people. So I will

207
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,480
Speaker 3:  say that expensive technology happens in corporate America first is a

208
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,400
Speaker 3:  real pattern. Yeah. PCs happen in corporate America. Max actually

209
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,280
Speaker 3:  the first, they were so expensive, they were four or $5,000 a piece. Graphic

210
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,120
Speaker 3:  design shops are the thing that like blew the Mac up with desktop publishing.

211
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,720
Speaker 3:  This is like ancient history now, but it was enterprise product. There's

212
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
Speaker 3:  wrong with that. It works. My mom had, I mean

213
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,600
Speaker 6:  Even the Blackberry. Yeah

214
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,880
Speaker 3:  The Blackberry. I was saying my mom had a one of those giant Motorola bag

215
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,800
Speaker 3:  phones that our hospital gave her. Yes.

216
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,320
Speaker 6:  Those are the best.

217
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,160
Speaker 3:  So like there's, yeah, somewhere on the adoption curve, there's the business

218
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,560
Speaker 3:  has a business need and I can solve it using this tool. It's just really

219
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,360
Speaker 3:  unclear what beaming a Windows desktop into the

220
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,200
Speaker 3:  Metaverse does for you at work, which is more or less what

221
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,040
Speaker 3:  they have promised. And then there's this, you know, they, they, they did

222
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,520
Speaker 3:  the more realistic avatars which aren't yet coming to teams. Like

223
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,280
Speaker 3:  there's like all these bits and bobs that aren't yet connected, but

224
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,040
Speaker 3:  you can see Microsoft was like, screw it, we don't wanna pay for the HoloLens.

225
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,920
Speaker 3:  Also we fired that guy, right? Alex

226
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,360
Speaker 6:  Kitman.

227
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,920
Speaker 3:  Alex Kitman is gone for Microsoft I first series of pretty devastating reports

228
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,840
Speaker 3:  about his behavior and they have this like, it just didn't work, it just

229
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,960
Speaker 3:  didn't happen for them. And they can just divest themselves with that hardware

230
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,680
Speaker 3:  investment, let meta take all of the pain and get to work building

231
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,520
Speaker 3:  software experiences that potentially, you know, they'll put on Apple's headset

232
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,160
Speaker 3:  or whoever's headset once somebody wins, which is more modern Microsoft

233
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,720
Speaker 3:  anyway. Yeah. Like that basically tracks with who Microsoft wants to be as

234
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,200
Speaker 3:  a company and like they might make a surface headset someday, but like there's

235
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,920
Speaker 3:  no reason for Microsoft to really try super hard to be way ahead of the game

236
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,760
Speaker 3:  here. They're much better off being on everybody else's stuff right now than

237
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,960
Speaker 3:  trying to build it their own. Yeah. Yeah. Which is funny cuz the flip side

238
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,880
Speaker 3:  the next day they're like surface the computers that we make. Right.

239
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,840
Speaker 3:  Fair. What were you saying Alex?

240
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,000
Speaker 6:  No, I was gonna say I am putting my, my inbox at risk for

241
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,160
Speaker 6:  saying this, but I do think Microsoft Teams

242
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,320
Speaker 6:  is actually like sneakily a killer app for vr.

243
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,760
Speaker 3:  Oh boy. All right.

244
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,360
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, again, my inbox just pr just

245
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,080
Speaker 6:  flooded it as soon as I said that. Just a hundred.

246
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,640
Speaker 3:  Alex Crans willing to accept future of work pitches.

247
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,040
Speaker 3:  alex@theverge.net.

248
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,960
Speaker 6:  I'm so sorry.

249
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,800
Speaker 3:  How will you collaborate in the metaverse ai predicts

250
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,120
Speaker 3:  workplace collaboration? Alex dot crans@theverge.com. Yeah, she's ready.

251
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,600
Speaker 3:  But

252
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,560
Speaker 6:  I think that, I think there is a very small potential for VR to

253
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,880
Speaker 6:  solve, like a lot of the problems we're seeing in remote work, right? Like

254
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,120
Speaker 6:  remote work is, is I think about this a lot because working at the Verge,

255
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
Speaker 6:  we're a fully remote company. We have a lot of people and work has just changed

256
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,440
Speaker 6:  and how we communicate with each other and how we can like just turn and

257
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,080
Speaker 6:  talk to somebody has changed. And there is some desire to have that connectivity

258
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,000
Speaker 6:  again. And teams could, could

259
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,640
Speaker 6:  do that if they nail it. But currently it's all super creepy and weird.

260
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,600
Speaker 6:  And also like nobody wants to have a meeting with their boss and get fired

261
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,560
Speaker 6:  by like a cartoon avatar that's just like a hell scape that we're

262
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,280
Speaker 6:  all trying to avoid.

263
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,200
Speaker 3:  Yes, that's

264
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,920
Speaker 6:  Fine. But if Tes like figures out a way to be like a good

265
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,800
Speaker 6:  VR app, then maybe that could be a thing that,

266
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,640
Speaker 3:  Okay. I just, the the, the logical leap that you just did in

267
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,600
Speaker 3:  this sentence, if teams can figure out how to be a good VR app is just

268
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 3:  enormous. Here's, I just want to just, here's a little, here's a little slice.

269
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,160
Speaker 6:  They're not putting any resources towards HoloLens. They got, they can put

270
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,680
Speaker 6:  it towards that

271
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,720
Speaker 3:  Now and they love teams. No, no. Let me just offer everybody a little slice

272
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,160
Speaker 3:  of corporate life. So sometimes we're all talking and I sense,

273
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,240
Speaker 3:  boy Slack makes everybody a jerk. It's happening again. It happens

274
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,960
Speaker 3:  every day. Slack makes you a jerk. So you should stop doing that. Yeah, you

275
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,480
Speaker 3:  should talk to each other like adults with your voice. And so I say something

276
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,320
Speaker 3:  like, let's get on a Slack call or let's hop on a Zoom or just

277
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,280
Speaker 3:  call me and I can hear the devastating size

278
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,240
Speaker 3:  from 200 miles away of people just being like, Ugh.

279
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,760
Speaker 3:  And all I'm asking them to do is push one button

280
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,920
Speaker 3:  in the app in which they are already pushing buttons and

281
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,680
Speaker 3:  talk with their voice instead of their fingers. And people are like,

282
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,640
Speaker 3:  Ugh. Every day. This happens every day. And it doesn't matter what

283
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,160
Speaker 3:  company you work in, it doesn't like The Verge is a great culture. People

284
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,120
Speaker 3:  love each other. Ugh. Right? Like I assume if you

285
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,040
Speaker 3:  work at a place where people like each other left, it's even a more devastating

286
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,000
Speaker 3:  si. Now imagine being like, all right coworker and Microsoft teams,

287
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,720
Speaker 3:  what I'd like to do is for you to put on your headset

288
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,920
Speaker 3:  so you can look at me as a cartoon so we can more

289
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,520
Speaker 3:  intimately connect on an emotional level. I just

290
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,280
Speaker 3:  don't think that's gonna go well.

291
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,160
Speaker 6:  I feel like there's a lot of things they have to do.

292
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,520
Speaker 6:  Like there's at least three steps they have to clear. But no,

293
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,440
Speaker 6:  at least three,

294
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,840
Speaker 3:  At least three seems, I cannot wait for you to get one of these headsets.

295
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,880
Speaker 3:  I'm getting one of these headsets. We are only meeting in VR from no one.

296
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,800
Speaker 3:  I love it. I will say we got a note, I can't remember if it was ADD or Alex

297
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,760
Speaker 3:  who got a note from a reader. It was like, the thing I miss most in my

298
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,640
Speaker 3:  life is a designer is whiteboards. Whiteboards are now

299
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,520
Speaker 3:  have always been and always will be the future of collaboration. I

300
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,480
Speaker 3:  am so excited about the virtual whiteboards. And I was like, yeah, I am too.

301
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,960
Speaker 3:  We we trash talk boards a lot and we were put soundly in

302
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,680
Speaker 3:  our place by that dm that that I think it was add who got that? Yeah, it

303
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,760
Speaker 3:  was rough times. Right. Here's the last thing I wanna talk about with Meta.

304
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,680
Speaker 3:  It's what you know, and we, again, whole episode with Addie, with Chris Grant

305
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,080
Speaker 3:  I believe Go listen to that. But here's the thing I wanna talk about on this.

306
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,400
Speaker 3:  Is it legs not

307
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,080
Speaker 6:  Like none of us on a call have legs,

308
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,120
Speaker 3:  Although the way that Meta has co-opted the legs from being a joke to like

309
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,280
Speaker 3:  being like a joke they're in on is like it's, you're not in on it yet.

310
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,320
Speaker 3:  I hate to tell this to you, I just, it's still a joke. This sentence that

311
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,040
Speaker 3:  Mark Zuckerberg said out loud that legs are probably the most requested feature

312
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,760
Speaker 3:  on our roadmap is just, it's not true. Beautiful. It's not true.

313
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,320
Speaker 3:  Like it's just the most requested feature on the roadmap is like, don't make

314
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,760
Speaker 3:  me nauseous better vr, it's like

315
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,080
Speaker 3:  cool things. Okay, well wait, keep going. What did you wanna talk about?

316
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,000
Speaker 3:  Okay, so what I wanna talk about is a Zuck took this shot in the keynote

317
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,960
Speaker 3:  at Apple and again you can tell he is got these, like these, these

318
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,760
Speaker 3:  speeches, these fragments of speeches that he's been rehearsing. So he did

319
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
Speaker 3:  it in the keynote, he did it with Alex. I've heard him say this stuff like

320
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,000
Speaker 3:  this before or he is like in the history of computing that I'm aware of,

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,440
Speaker 3:  sometimes the open system wins and sometimes the closed system wins. And

322
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,600
Speaker 3:  the only history of computing that he's talking about is mobile and PCs,

323
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,520
Speaker 3:  which to be fair are the only errors of computing that we have all lived

324
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,680
Speaker 3:  through sometimes I remember the Uck is about my agent terrifies me

325
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,160
Speaker 3:  and what he means is in PCs quote, Open one

326
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,360
Speaker 3:  Microsoft one and there are lots of PC vendors. And then in mobile,

327
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,960
Speaker 3:  and this is wildly up for debate, he means a closed one because Apple's a

328
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,600
Speaker 3:  closed ecosystem. We don't apparently mention Android in this

329
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,160
Speaker 3:  conversation. The world's most dominant operating system

330
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,960
Speaker 3:  does not count. And Z's interpretation of open V closed, right? Because

331
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,560
Speaker 6:  We use iPhones in America. Yeah,

332
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,400
Speaker 3:  Sure. But it's like the Android is more popular. I don't, I don't know

333
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,640
Speaker 3:  what he means by winning and losing whatever I, I just like

334
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,640
Speaker 3:  the Quest is an iPhone, right? Like at best it

335
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,800
Speaker 3:  allows some sideline,

336
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,880
Speaker 6:  Well technically it's an Android phone. Well

337
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,840
Speaker 3:  Right, It runs Android and it allows side loading. You put other stores on

338
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,760
Speaker 3:  it. Yeah. But like the operating system is made by Meta. The hardware

339
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,640
Speaker 3:  is made by meta. Most of the applications are made by companies that

340
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,160
Speaker 3:  have been bought by Meta. What do you, what are you talking about? Yeah,

341
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,000
Speaker 3:  so Add wrote a great piece that was like, what do you mean by open? And what

342
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,840
Speaker 3:  he basically means by Open is like many app developers participate in our

343
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,040
Speaker 3:  platform and I just, I'm I'm curious what you two think about it cuz a,

344
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,560
Speaker 3:  I don't even know that Open has lost in this generation of mobile

345
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,520
Speaker 3:  cuz Android exists and there are lots of, there are lots of

346
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,680
Speaker 3:  forks of Android out in the world running on phones in China, for example,

347
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,520
Speaker 3:  forked Android with no Google involved running all over the place. There

348
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,160
Speaker 3:  are lots of hardware vendors. Samsung obviously dominates and it's the most

349
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,080
Speaker 3:  popular operating system in the world. And in the previous era it's like

350
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
Speaker 3:  sure there are lots of PC makers but I mean they called it Wintel

351
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,400
Speaker 3:  and the government sued them for being a monopoly. Yeah. It's a bull strategy

352
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,200
Speaker 3:  to hold up the nineties arrow Microsoft as like your bastion of openness.

353
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,360
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's, it's, I just kind of don't get what the argument is. I

354
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,280
Speaker 3:  forgot. And like I said, he's been saying it in different forms around the

355
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,840
Speaker 3:  same shape for a while now. He,

356
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,640
Speaker 6:  I think he's trying to like hope nobody notices that they,

357
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,240
Speaker 6:  that Facebook, excuse me, Meta still makes the hardware

358
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,360
Speaker 6:  meta is still in control regardless of the software,

359
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,320
Speaker 6:  regardless of the developers. They're still in control. It's not like

360
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,240
Speaker 6:  when when Microsoft did its VR attempt what in 20 17, 20 18

361
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,240
Speaker 6:  and they're like, everybody can do headsets and everybody made that. There

362
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,720
Speaker 6:  was the Ace or headset and the HP headset and then we never talked about

363
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,440
Speaker 6:  it again. Yeah. Like that's not happening at meta. Meta is making the

364
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,800
Speaker 6:  headsets. That's it. And if they control, if you control the hardware

365
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,040
Speaker 6:  and you control the primary app store, how can you call yourself an

366
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,920
Speaker 6:  open ecosystem?

367
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,040
Speaker 3:  I don't think it's, it's the primary app stores been like Microsoft would

368
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,400
Speaker 3:  love to control the primary app store on Windows. Yeah. Like it's there.

369
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,280
Speaker 3:  They can, no one uses it. You know, like Apple would love to control the

370
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,200
Speaker 3:  Mac app store. No one uses it. Like I, it's to

371
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,240
Speaker 3:  me it's is the operating system and the hardware are the independent of each

372
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,800
Speaker 3:  other. Then you can, you start to begin to claim that things are open,

373
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,470
Speaker 3:  right? Anyone can come build some hardware that runs this software. You can

374
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,430
Speaker 3:  compete as a great hardware vendor or you can on the flip side, anybody can

375
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,150
Speaker 3:  build an operating system that runs on any piece of hardware, which is less

376
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,590
Speaker 3:  likely. But you know, I think in the Windows ecosystem you can just run Linux.

377
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,790
Speaker 3:  I think in so many ways, listening to Mark Zuckerberg talk about

378
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,270
Speaker 3:  a lot of this stuff is like you have to assume his entire brain is in like

379
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,950
Speaker 3:  2035 and is in a world where like the metaverse is

380
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,710
Speaker 3:  everything he imagined. And I think he does genuinely imagine a

381
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,550
Speaker 3:  like broad sort of standards based thing that works more like

382
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,590
Speaker 3:  the open web than like the app store, right? Cause I think when he talks

383
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,510
Speaker 3:  about open versus clothes, like very specifically where that has bit him

384
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,150
Speaker 3:  is like Apple on. I think the, the way adding phrase it, which I really liked

385
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,870
Speaker 3:  was basically like the, the extent to which they dictate the rules of the

386
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,910
Speaker 3:  platform. And to the extent that there are lots of developers all over

387
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,510
Speaker 3:  the world building stuff for Apple platforms. It's wildly open in that way.

388
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,350
Speaker 3:  But Apple is like extremely in control of absolutely everything

389
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,070
Speaker 3:  about the platform and can do whatever it wants to you for basically any

390
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,630
Speaker 3:  reason at any time. And even if you don't run afoul of those rules, you know

391
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,190
Speaker 3:  they exist and you know that they can come crashing down upon you at any

392
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,030
Speaker 3:  time. So here's what he said specifically. I strongly believe that an open

393
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,790
Speaker 3:  interoperable metaverse built by many different developers and companies

394
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,430
Speaker 3:  is going to be better for everyone. Sure. I believe him when he says that.

395
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:02,750
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

396
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,270
Speaker 6:  But I don't believe that he's doing

397
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,630
Speaker 3:  That. I would say there's nothing in his company's history that would lead

398
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,550
Speaker 3:  me to believe he'll do that. But I think I believe him when he says that.

399
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:10,870
Speaker 3:  Sure.

400
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,670
Speaker 6:  Like isn't he going around and buying up every single super successful

401
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,510
Speaker 6:  VR company right now?

402
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,390
Speaker 3:  And also Facebook exists. Like if you believe this stuff, Facebook

403
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,390
Speaker 3:  would be different. Like

404
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,030
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And open ecosystem will do it, but he's not doing that. He's

405
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,190
Speaker 6:  aggressively against it.

406
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,230
Speaker 3:  I'm just deeply confused. I think like what he means is

407
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,950
Speaker 3:  the only competition he sees on the horizon is Apple, which is also making

408
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,590
Speaker 3:  a headset very much like the Quest press. Yes. Right. We're

409
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,590
Speaker 3:  anticipating that. We'll see it next year.

410
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,270
Speaker 6:  Same pricing

411
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,510
Speaker 3:  VR headset with cameras on the outside. It'll do mixed reality with video

412
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,550
Speaker 3:  passer. Alex Heath has reported on that at the information and at the Verge

413
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,950
Speaker 3:  many times. Great. So then he's gonna have a competitor and what Apple is

414
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,790
Speaker 3:  gonna sell to you is Apple. Apple, Right. A tightly

415
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,990
Speaker 3:  defined experience that other people can participate in in Apple's terms.

416
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,710
Speaker 3:  Right. So Z is obviously just trying to differentiate that. I'm just saying

417
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,670
Speaker 3:  I don't, nothing about what he has today is actually differentiated from

418
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,550
Speaker 3:  that. Agreed. Agreed. And that's what I mean by you. Like, you have to assume

419
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,430
Speaker 3:  Mark lives in 2035. Cause like I really think when he looks at the metaverse,

420
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,590
Speaker 3:  he sees a totally different thing than actually exists in the world. And

421
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,990
Speaker 3:  it's like, it's why he talks about everything in these like crazy 10 year

422
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,550
Speaker 3:  things. It's why when you say like, who are you gonna sell this to? He's

423
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,590
Speaker 3:  basically like, ah, I don't give a shit. Yeah. Like we're gonna, he really

424
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,670
Speaker 3:  is at this point. Like we just gotta keep doing it. You know, like Yeah.

425
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,470
Speaker 3:  He's just like, I'm gonna burn so much money and that it's gonna be amazing.

426
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,670
Speaker 3:  And I, I like, I think he is, he is already at the end of that road

427
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,150
Speaker 3:  when he talks about some of this stuff and like, but I agree. I mean the,

428
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,110
Speaker 3:  the quest as it exists is price is precisely

429
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,440
Speaker 3:  the Apple model of how this stuff should work. Is Apple bought all of the

430
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,640
Speaker 3:  best developers. It's an iPhone with like a medium amount of side boating.

431
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,400
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Right? Like, not even like a lot of like a medium amount of side boating.

432
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The thing that kills me, and I've was thinking about this because you

433
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,960
Speaker 3:  know, this was like another prerecorded keynote and we, we've done, we just

434
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,120
Speaker 3:  had the Google event which was in person and the Apple event is like this

435
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,880
Speaker 3:  hybrid where you like, David watched the video and like whatever,

436
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,880
Speaker 3:  You know, it's like, it's kind of like fine with phones. I don't even think

437
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,160
Speaker 3:  it's fine with phones to like see the stuff on video. I think you have to

438
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,120
Speaker 3:  hold and perceive these objects. But like we've been reviewing a lot of phones

439
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,720
Speaker 3:  lately and we're like trying to tell people about 120 hertz variable refresh

440
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,040
Speaker 3:  rate displays. And no one can tell you what that looks like. Right. You can't

441
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,520
Speaker 3:  even watch a video about it. It's even harder with this VR stuff.

442
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,080
Speaker 3:  Like to have the experience of whatever the Quest Pro is

443
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,680
Speaker 3:  compressed and I sent over the internet and displayed on somebody's like

444
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,400
Speaker 3:  crappy uncalibrated 30 hertz display. Like

445
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,200
Speaker 3:  there's something about these, this generation of products that's coming

446
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,160
Speaker 3:  up where people, this, this cynicism is amplified

447
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,400
Speaker 3:  by how we perceive them, right? It's like the internet, like looking at

448
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,280
Speaker 3:  pictures, JPEGs on the web do not actually communicate anything about these

449
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,240
Speaker 3:  products. Right. And like I, that's like, I think gonna be the hardest turn

450
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,280
Speaker 3:  for everyone. It's gonna be the hardest turn when we review it. It's gonna

451
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,400
Speaker 3:  be the hardest turn we write about it. It's gonna be the hardest turn is

452
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,880
Speaker 3:  more and more companies launch the stuff because there's just nothing.

453
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,520
Speaker 6:  Unless we're already wearing our VR

454
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,720
Speaker 6:  and watching the keynotes.

455
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,720
Speaker 3:  Most we're watching brilliant Pixelated four ADP display

456
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,560
Speaker 3:  of our Quest two, I think it's seven 20 with legs.

457
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,520
Speaker 3:  With legs could there's a a go find it in the video.

458
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,360
Speaker 3:  We didn't like whatever. There's a moment where they're saying they're in

459
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,600
Speaker 3:  the metaverse, right? And it's like Zuck and it's like PM and he is like,

460
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,520
Speaker 3:  we've done legs. And they have hosted this in like a

461
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,160
Speaker 3:  virtual, it looks like a basketball court. It was like really hard to understand

462
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,440
Speaker 3:  what kind of thing they were in cuz it had bleachers.

463
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,280
Speaker 3:  Did you see the bleachers? I missed the bleachers. So they were like talking

464
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,520
Speaker 3:  to each other like in Horizon and they were like, here's all the stuff we're

465
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:46,560
Speaker 3:  doing.

466
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,360
Speaker 6:  And there's like people sitting around in bleachers watching them

467
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,880
Speaker 3:  And they, they clearly, it's like who knows if they were live or if they

468
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,120
Speaker 3:  were programmed, whatever. But the little avatars had the ability to like

469
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Speaker 3:  throw confetti and they were all jumping and throwing the conf. And so like,

470
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,520
Speaker 3:  Mark is there, but they didn't have legs. They didn't have legs. So Mark,

471
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,240
Speaker 3:  the ceo, the billionaire god king CEO of MEA

472
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,480
Speaker 3:  is like, look at my legs. And then everyone in the crowd is like throwing

473
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,400
Speaker 3:  confetti and jumping and their avatars are cut off and then there's just

474
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,160
Speaker 3:  like a black space in a bar underneath it. And the whole thing is just like

475
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,400
Speaker 3:  vertically jumping like an old Atari game. What if this is the Metaverse

476
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,120
Speaker 3:  business model, you get to pay for legs. And they keep throwing this

477
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,920
Speaker 3:  confetti and I was like, everyone's just go watch this moment. It is

478
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,560
Speaker 3:  truly one of the most bizarre tech keynote moments

479
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,160
Speaker 3:  you have ever seen Mark Virtual, Mark Zuckerberg

480
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,000
Speaker 3:  trying out his new legs while an audience of cartoons

481
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,800
Speaker 3:  just vertically moves up and down throwing confetti on him.

482
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,680
Speaker 3:  It's great. It's, I was like, I like all my meetings to have that

483
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,440
Speaker 3:  and like, you know, we're all remote. So like, I literally was at home watching

484
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,120
Speaker 3:  this Zoom by myself or watching this on the TV by myself and I was like,

485
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,520
Speaker 3:  is anybody else seeing this? Like no one,

486
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,600
Speaker 3:  like you're just like, this is the loneliest I've ever felt

487
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,040
Speaker 6:  Again, you could have been in VR and slowly turned your

488
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,440
Speaker 6:  cartoon

489
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,280
Speaker 3:  We're doing the next Verge Cast. In in the, in the

490
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,040
Speaker 3:  Metaverse we're the whole time. This was supposed to be a quick

491
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,840
Speaker 3:  conversation about the Metaverse and look at what happened to us. This is

492
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,000
Speaker 3:  what the weed smell it does to you. We're gonna take a quick break. We come

493
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,880
Speaker 3:  back, we had talk about the Pixel stuff. We went back.

494
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,260
Speaker 7:  Any job at Amazon can turn into a high paying career for

495
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,140
Speaker 7:  employees looking for security. Today Amazon offers good pay and healthcare

496
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,860
Speaker 7:  on day one. New parents also get up to 20 weeks of fully paid

497
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,740
Speaker 7:  leave. So they have the flexibility to spend time with family while making

498
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,220
Speaker 7:  a living for opportunity. Tomorrow Amazon is investing

499
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,980
Speaker 7:  1.2 billion into free technical training that's available to over

500
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,780
Speaker 7:  750,000 associates across the country. With

501
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,260
Speaker 7:  these programs, hourly employees have the opportunity to move into higher

502
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,860
Speaker 7:  paying highly skilled jobs in fields like software engineering and

503

Speaker 7:  robotics. Learn more@aboutamazon.com

504
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,120
Speaker 8:  One day. The Metaverse will help students learn about the rings of Saturn,

505
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,360
Speaker 8:  allowing them to get up close to the planets and gain a deeper understanding

506
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,240
Speaker 8:  of how our solar system works. The Metaverse may be virtual but the impact

507
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,400
Speaker 8:  will be real. Learn more at meta.com/metaverse impact.

508
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,550
Speaker 3:  Okay, we're back. It's review season. This is great. So we reviewed the

509
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,510
Speaker 3:  Pixel watch, we reviewed the Pixel seven and the Pixel seven Pro. What do

510
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,310
Speaker 3:  you think? I, Well let's start with the watch because I think as our reviews

511
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,910
Speaker 3:  confirmed, the watches substantially more interesting than the phones this

512
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,470
Speaker 3:  year. Just in terms of like new stuff happening. My takeaway, these

513
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,950
Speaker 3:  reviews really great and everyone should read it, but indeed I was kind of

514
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,390
Speaker 3:  unimpressed in a way that was a little bit of a bummer. Like Google

515
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,150
Speaker 3:  first ever smart watch, they like, they made a nice thing, which I think

516
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:06,070
Speaker 3:  was a big win. Yeah. And by all accounts it is a nice thing. It's

517
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,590
Speaker 3:  a little small. The, the bezels are a little big but my experience has been

518
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,470
Speaker 3:  the same as vs. Where like in actual use you don't really notice the Bezzle.

519
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,630
Speaker 3:  They did a good job with the ui, the band thing is nifty, but it's like I

520
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,510
Speaker 3:  wanted Google to like really get one piece of this.

521
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,990
Speaker 3:  Right. Right. And it was like there was a, this is their first one. It was

522
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,910
Speaker 3:  clearly not gonna you mean

523
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,470
Speaker 6:  Right? Or like just nail it like,

524
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,510
Speaker 3:  Like crush it. Yeah. Like I, I think what what Google really needed to do

525
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,310
Speaker 3:  was like have one thing that it was like a plus job Google

526
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,030
Speaker 3:  and I assumed that would be the health stuff because they have Fitbit. Yeah.

527
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,390
Speaker 3:  They like talked to be game about all the sensors they were putting into

528
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,550
Speaker 3:  this and it was like, okay, if this thing was a kick ass fitness tracker

529
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,880
Speaker 3:  and a pretty good everything else, that's like an awesome start from Google.

530
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,880
Speaker 3:  They're gonna be in this for real. Yeah. And instead it seems like Google

531
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,800
Speaker 3:  did pretty well on everything without nailing

532
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,800
Speaker 3:  anything. Yeah. And that kind of left me cold. Yeah. They didn't push the

533
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,400
Speaker 3:  on it felt

534
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,200
Speaker 6:  Very Pixel. It

535
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,760
Speaker 3:  Was very Pixel. That's fair. Well no, but the Pixel, you know,

536
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,840
Speaker 3:  pushes the envelope at least on photography every other year or so. Right.

537
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's that's true. That's true.

538
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,800
Speaker 3:  And Pixel drama aside, like the, the thing of the

539
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,760
Speaker 3:  Pixel is not designed to win. You know, it's like it's a hedge against Samsung

540
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,720
Speaker 3:  and it's like a showcase for Google to be googley. Yeah. You know, every

541
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,400
Speaker 3:  30 days the pixel just kills one feature automatically.

542
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,360
Speaker 3:  It just takes one thing away. That's horrible.

543
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,720
Speaker 6:  If you want 'em to live, you have to start buying pixels.

544
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,920
Speaker 3:  Exactly. But but I see what you're saying about the watch. Like they made

545
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,160
Speaker 3:  an Apple watch for Android users but like an Apple watch

546
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,040
Speaker 3:  for for Android users. Yeah. Yes. And like the Google

547
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,880
Speaker 3:  assistant thing is a big win. My overwhelming experience is the Google assistant

548
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,840
Speaker 3:  is better than Siri at absolutely everything. Yeah. I, I dunno if this has

549
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,600
Speaker 3:  been your experience recently, but Siri is worse than ever for me. All of

550
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,040
Speaker 3:  a sudden like it's so bad,

551
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,680
Speaker 6:  So stupid.

552
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,400
Speaker 3:  It's crazy. And I get the thing where I'm just like,

553
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,560
Speaker 6:  Just

554
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,280
Speaker 3:  Thunderously done. I do like a basic reminder and it does the thing where

555
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,600
Speaker 3:  it's like one moment still thinking, Yeah, I'm sorry please try again. And

556
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,120
Speaker 3:  I'm like, I'm on wifi dude. Like what's the problem here? But anyway,

557
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,680
Speaker 3:  Google assistant is way better than Siri at all of the things you would wanted

558
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,520
Speaker 3:  to do on a smart watch. And that seemed to be v's experience too. Like the

559
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,800
Speaker 3:  mic is pretty good, the speakers are pretty good. Outside of that it just

560
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,680
Speaker 3:  doesn't feel like Google nailed anything here. Like the Fitbit stuff is good,

561
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,680
Speaker 3:  but missing some of the best Fitbit things like it doesn't have automatic

562
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,160
Speaker 3:  workout detection and at the very least this thing should have been like

563
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,760
Speaker 3:  the mega Fitbit. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Like it's more expensive, it's more impressive.

564
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,640
Speaker 3:  It's clearly where Fitbit is headed is this device which

565
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,680
Speaker 3:  V wrote, I think she reviewed the sense too and was basically like Google

566
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,040
Speaker 3:  is going to eat this thing to death with devices called Pixel. Yeah. And

567
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,840
Speaker 3:  I think that's right. But in order to do that, this needed to be, if nothing

568
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,760
Speaker 3:  else, like a truly, truly kick ass Fitbit and it gets, it gets

569
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,480
Speaker 3:  almost there and it does all the things it does pretty well. But there were

570
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,400
Speaker 3:  just a bunch of like little places it fell down. It like ended a couple of

571
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,560
Speaker 3:  her workouts early and it didn't do the workout detection and just little

572
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,480
Speaker 3:  things that it's like they knew they had to get this right. Like Rick Olo

573
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,640
Speaker 3:  told me, he was like, we know the thing we have to do if we want to get to

574
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,200
Speaker 3:  this like magical wrist computer smartwatch future, we have to get fitness.

575
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,680
Speaker 3:  Right. And that's why people will buy it today. And they'd like almost but

576
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,440
Speaker 3:  not quite. Got there. The thing that got me in, in vis review and about the

577
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,800
Speaker 3:  Pixel watch in general is it doesn't know when you're washing your hands,

578
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,440
Speaker 3:  which is not a useful feature of the Apple watch at this point. Like they

579
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,360
Speaker 3:  rolled out hand washing detection when it was useful in

580
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,000
Speaker 3:  early 2020. Yeah. When everyone was still like afraid to

581
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,960
Speaker 6:  Remind them already not to be

582
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,200
Speaker 3:  Disgusting. Yeah. People are like windexing their cardboard boxes. Do you

583
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,880
Speaker 3:  guys still wash your hands specifically by the way? Cause that is one I do

584
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,480
Speaker 3:  wash my hands. I'm not doing it for 20 seconds. Are you kidding me? That's

585
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,760
Speaker 3:  who has, you're still singing Happy Birthday twice. Like what are you doing?

586
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,200
Speaker 3:  You you sing the chorus of Mr. Brightside. That's what it's chorus of Mr.

587
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,040
Speaker 3:  Brightside. David's still like, and David's like, I'm a

588
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,800
Speaker 3:  sophomore in college and I'm gonna sing with, it's perpetually

589
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,480
Speaker 3:  3m. David has come home from the bar every time he washes his hand.

590
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,400
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Man. Like, you know, I'm like wearing, I'm trying to be careful all

591
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Speaker 3:  this stuff, but like, I'm like, you know what, like a little bit of soap

592
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,760
Speaker 3:  we're good, right? Like Yeah. But like at least the Apple

593
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,600
Speaker 3:  Watch is like, you know, 75%. It's like I I think

594
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,520
Speaker 3:  you're washing your hands. Yeah. Like yeah the Pixel watch, you have to

595
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,640
Speaker 3:  tell it that you're washing your hands and I'm like, this guarantees that

596
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,480
Speaker 3:  no one will ever use this feature. Correct. And Google is like the

597
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,440
Speaker 3:  most powerful AI company on planet Earth and it hasn't figured out are

598
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Speaker 3:  is this watch on a wrist connected to hands that are being watched.

599
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,040
Speaker 3:  And that to me is just like a, it's just a miss. They didn't finish the feature

600
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,400
Speaker 3:  all the way. Yeah. And I that well

601
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,280
Speaker 6:  How would they have known? Like I don't wanna give picks,

602
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,120
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna give Google any credit here because they're one of the largest

603
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,200
Speaker 6:  richest companies in the world. They should be able to do this and figure

604
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,600
Speaker 6:  it out and nail it on the first try. But this is also like the first try.

605
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,880
Speaker 6:  And they're not, they're used to a lot of ways that humans interact with

606
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,960
Speaker 6:  computers, but computer risk computers is, is a totally new

607
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,400
Speaker 6:  thing for them. As evidenced by where os one and two,

608
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,400
Speaker 6:  like they've sucked at it for a long time and they've made no effort. Now

609
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,960
Speaker 6:  they're like, okay, we've gotta make our effort.

610
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,760
Speaker 3:  Well no, they've been chasing after this for like five or six years. They

611
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,640
Speaker 3:  would so peace about it. This is why you buy Fitbit. Like the, the, the answer

612
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,400
Speaker 3:  to your question is they screwed it up. So they had to spend billions of

613
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,720
Speaker 3:  dollars on Fitbit. Right. And to be fair, it does seem like, like the, the

614
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,440
Speaker 3:  leap from what you get with Google fit to what you get with Fitbit, thus

615
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,200
Speaker 3:  the Pixel watch is massive. So like in that sense, Yeah, kudos

616
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,160
Speaker 3:  that did the thing. But I mean I, and I take your point Alex,

617
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,600
Speaker 3:  that like a year of people wearing these things will give Google a lot of

618
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,400
Speaker 3:  data about when they're doing things like washing their hands that might

619
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,160
Speaker 3:  turn out to be useful for V2 of this. But again, the hand washing thing to

620
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,000
Speaker 3:  me is not important because no robot is gonna tell me to wash my hands

621
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,600
Speaker 3:  for 20 seconds. Like again, I'm in and outta there like I believe the soap

622
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,760
Speaker 3:  works. You know what I'm saying? You

623
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,120
Speaker 6:  Just like run your hand under it real fast.

624
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,800
Speaker 3:  I'm like a little kid, I go in there, I turn on the water and make sure my

625
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,760
Speaker 3:  wife heard it. I turn off the water, I'm out. You know, like

626
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,960
Speaker 3:  you should wash your hands correctly.

627
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,080
Speaker 6:  No one shaked you.

628
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,280
Speaker 3:  It's how little kids do it. You know, I don't care what they ask. Siri

629
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,120
Speaker 3:  can't force me to do anything, but they know this is the

630
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,040
Speaker 3:  bar. That's what I mean. If you're gonna have this feature and you know your

631
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,560
Speaker 3:  competition is Apple and it's not even just Apple. This is the thing where

632
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,520
Speaker 3:  if it's good enough, people might leave the iPhone. Right? You make you

633
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,200
Speaker 3:  make a risk computer that's for the,

634
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,360
Speaker 6:  It's not for the hand wash.

635
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,560
Speaker 3:  Right. And so then you gotta, you gotta look at every feature of this thing

636
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,240
Speaker 3:  and say, is it that much better than the only

637
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,160
Speaker 3:  competition? That's real. Cuz they're not trying to take market share away

638
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,120
Speaker 3:  from Samsung. They're trying to build a compelling wearable that lots

639
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,760
Speaker 3:  of people will wear because they think this is the future of ambient computing

640
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,880
Speaker 3:  is to have a compute on your body. And then you take share away from Apple

641
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,920
Speaker 3:  all, all these things and they're like, okay, ship the hand washing

642
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,800
Speaker 3:  feature that you have to tell it count to 20. So it's not even a hand

643
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,560
Speaker 3:  washing feature, it's just a 22nd timer that you can enable with a tap. Right?

644
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,240
Speaker 3:  And it's like, that's obviously not good enough. Like it obviously

645
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,680
Speaker 3:  isn't a complete idea. Like just don't like take it out. Actually

646
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,640
Speaker 3:  don't ship halfway ideas, ship only the things that are so much

647
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,600
Speaker 3:  better that people are like, Maybe I should give up my iPhone because

648
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,240
Speaker 3:  this thing looks so cool and I don't think anybody's looking at this thing

649
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,320
Speaker 3:  and thinking that looks so cool. I wanna give up my iPhone. Especially not

650
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,160
Speaker 3:  in a world where the Apple Watch ultra exists.

651
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like where where's the disconnect coming at at Google though? Because

652
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,720
Speaker 6:  Rick O was like, Yes, this is the future, we're doing this and then like

653
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,360
Speaker 6:  apparently the the PM or whoever was in charge was like, we're doing what,

654
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,600
Speaker 6:  like we're do, we're doing a nice Apple Watch

655
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,520
Speaker 6:  knockoff, we're doing the Android version of an Apple Watch series for So

656
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,880
Speaker 6:  like why did it, like why

657
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,720
Speaker 3:  It took a long time, right? I mean this thing was basically delayed. Yeah.

658
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,360
Speaker 6:  It took a long

659
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,080
Speaker 3:  Months year at least. Yeah. I mean yeah it, it is an interesting counterfactual

660
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,080
Speaker 3:  to know like what would've happened if the Fitbit acquisition had gone through

661
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,480
Speaker 3:  much quicker. Because at least the story Google has told me is basically

662
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,520
Speaker 3:  like we wanted do this thing. We knew we couldn't do it properly until we

663
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,040
Speaker 3:  got Fitbit and then the Fitbit thing took forever. And I think Google correctly

664
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,840
Speaker 3:  surmised that every day they didn't launch a smart watch was a problem. So

665
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Speaker 3:  I think I definitely got the sense that this was like not a rush job, but

666
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,720
Speaker 3:  like there was a, there was a day circled on the calendar a long time ago

667
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,000
Speaker 3:  that it was like, if we miss this, it's a problem. And that day was probably

668
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,680
Speaker 3:  in like 2020 and now here we are. But I think, I mean

669
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,240
Speaker 3:  to me it's like the, the question of what is Google trying to do with this,

670
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,920
Speaker 3:  I think is part of what's super interesting. Cuz on the one hand it's, I

671
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,840
Speaker 3:  think they are trying to take away from Samsung. I I I think Rick Oslo's

672
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,720
Speaker 3:  remit is to get market share in the phone space. And the easiest

673
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,520
Speaker 3:  way for them to do that is to steal share from Samsung. Like, I don't know

674
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,160
Speaker 3:  that Sundar Percha is that worried about it, but like Rick Olo definitely

675
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,960
Speaker 3:  is. Yeah. They also wanna take away from the iPhone. They

676
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,880
Speaker 3:  also wanna do the like big broad ambient computing vision, which means

677
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,000
Speaker 3:  plugging into everything else that Google does. And they want to make sure

678
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,520
Speaker 3:  that they have a thing that will keep people who currently use Android phones

679
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,120
Speaker 3:  from switching to an iPhone in order to get an Apple watch. And so they're,

680
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,400
Speaker 3:  they're playing with all these things in the bar for each one of them is

681
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,200
Speaker 3:  very different. And it just feels like trying to do that, trying to satisfy

682
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,120
Speaker 3:  all of those things on your first try was just always gonna be very

683
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,920
Speaker 3:  hard. Yeah. So for that reason I'm sympathetic, the stuff I'm less sympathetic

684
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,880
Speaker 3:  to is like not getting the Fitbit stuff right. Because they knew they needed

685
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,440
Speaker 3:  to and they got it fine but not good enough. The battery life is the one

686
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,520
Speaker 3:  that really kills me. Yeah. Like if you wanna come out and instantly have

687
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,560
Speaker 3:  a move in the smart watch market, it's the battery. Yeah. Like that's just

688
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,120
Speaker 3:  it. And Fitbit has done good battery stuff over time and if I'm Google I

689
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,520
Speaker 3:  would've stripped the thing way down and basically been like, it's a Fitbit

690
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,040
Speaker 3:  and it's Google assistant, it does nothing else and it lasts for three days.

691
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,320
Speaker 3:  Like what's up? And I think I genuinely think that would've done something

692
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,200
Speaker 3:  and said instead it like barely lasts a day.

693
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:34,000
Speaker 3:  If you like Visa takeaway was basically if you really, really baby it, it'll

694
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,960
Speaker 3:  last a day. But that's if you don't use it very much and you don't have

695
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,720
Speaker 3:  the always on display on, and I mean that matches the first

696
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,400
Speaker 3:  gen I, the first gen Apple watch. Yeah. That was seven years ago. Yeah. Yeah.

697
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,080
Speaker 3:  You don't get to do like, you don't get to play by 2015 rules and 2022. Even

698
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,800
Speaker 3:  if this is your first smartwatch what like it is and it

699
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah. She lost like what, 25% of her battery in an hour

700
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,480
Speaker 6:  long run. Yeah. With just GPS on it. That's, that's it. I mean GPS does suck

701
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,400
Speaker 6:  a lot of battery, but that should not be a thing in 2022 for

702
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,800
Speaker 6:  a big Apple competitor. You shouldn't have to worry about losing a quarter

703
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,280
Speaker 6:  of your battery just because you are making the awful choice to run.

704
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Kudos to all people who run

705
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,440
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Runnings. Exactly. I love you. You. But I like the, I think it was

706
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,800
Speaker 3:  v who told me that like one of her theories is like the marathon test. Like

707
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,920
Speaker 3:  could I run a marathon with this and it wouldn't die and this would die.

708
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,440
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And it fails the marathon test. Yeah. I don't know how fast v runs

709
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,920
Speaker 3:  marathons, but I I would not make it with with this thing through a marathon.

710
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,720
Speaker 3:  One of my favorite to trends is the people who are trying to run a marathon

711
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,920
Speaker 3:  at the pace of the world record that was just set, which is you have to basically

712
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,560
Speaker 3:  run it 13 or 14 miles an hour. Dead dead sprint. Yeah. And like they're like,

713
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,720
Speaker 3:  you did it for two hours and people are like 30 seconds of falling down.

714
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,160
Speaker 3:  Like they treadmill ramps all the way up and they fall down. It's great.

715
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,360
Speaker 3:  That's my, that's my marathon test. Talk about the Pixel seven. Pixel seven

716
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,160
Speaker 3:  pro. They are very iterative. I mean they

717
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,360
Speaker 3:  fix some things. It seems like they don't get as hot. The cameras are ever

718
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,920
Speaker 3:  so slightly improved. The fingerprint seems to work better, which is a win.

719
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,880
Speaker 3:  She, Alison said it was a beat faster in the review. I'll take it so

720
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,520
Speaker 3:  it's not slow, but it's a beat faster. And they added face on lock

721
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:13,520
Speaker 3:  on to you. Right? I mean I, I'm looking into photo, I mean obviously what

722
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,480
Speaker 3:  do I look at? I look at the photos and I'm just blown away by how

723
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,680
Speaker 3:  much Google is doing with these cameras now. Especially the, the Zoom stuff

724
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,520
Speaker 3:  they're doing, which is not as good as Samsung and some of our sample shots.

725
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,280
Speaker 3:  But Samsung is a dedicated lens. This is like Google's adding

726
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,880
Speaker 3:  the ultra wide, the main camera, the Zoom, and they're getting a really

727
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,720
Speaker 3:  passable super zoom, but it, I still just scares me. Yeah.

728
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,680
Speaker 3:  She has Allison put a shot in here comparing the pixel seven pros

729
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,480
Speaker 3:  10 x crop mode to the 10 x dedicated zoom on the

730
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,480
Speaker 3:  S 22 Ultra. And the S 22 ultra, like you said is, is definitely better. It's

731
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,600
Speaker 3:  a, it's dedicated glass. And Allison even says in the review like there's

732
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,760
Speaker 3:  only so much you can do by cropping pixels. Like that just is true. It looks

733
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,120
Speaker 3:  so much better than I expected it to. Oh yeah. On like it's really,

734
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,880
Speaker 3:  really, this wasn't an image slider and you weren't directly comparing the

735
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,480
Speaker 3:  two. You'd be like, Oh that's great. Yeah. It's a smidge dark. Which actually

736
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,400
Speaker 3:  makes sense given Yeah. What it is. But it looks really good and 10

737
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Speaker 3:  x I mean I'm used to like the five x pictures coming outta phones looking

738
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,200
Speaker 3:  borderline unusable and this is like a perfectly functional photo.

739
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,280
Speaker 3:  It's really impressed. It does bring up fascinating philosophical. It's

740
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,160
Speaker 6:  Like a photo you could send to your friends and family Yeah. And not get

741
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,560
Speaker 6:  jumped. Totally.

742
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But again, it's like they're merging three cameras into one

743
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,480
Speaker 3:  multiple frames at some point you're just holding your phone up to reality

744
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,280
Speaker 3:  like in AI prompt and being like, tell me what you think the sign

745
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,960
Speaker 3:  looks like. I'm just like fascinated by this. Like it Google

746
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,760
Speaker 3:  has pushed so far beyond the what is a photo debate

747
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,800
Speaker 3:  with, with particularly the Zoom stuff and some of the video stuff they're

748
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,440
Speaker 3:  doing that. Yeah. I don't know. Like I, we probably just need to call Google

749
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,920
Speaker 3:  and be like, give us the pixel team again. Let's, let's smoke some weed in

750
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,320
Speaker 3:  the studio and really get into it. Yeah, we should do that cuz it's not you're,

751
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,920
Speaker 3:  you're right. They're way beyond like what kinds of nifty stuff can we do

752
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,400
Speaker 3:  with your pixels? And they've gone into, we're gonna take all these pixels,

753
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,040
Speaker 3:  we're gonna feed them into our neural network and it's gonna spit out

754
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,280
Speaker 3:  what it thinks it's seeing. And it's like, there there is a, there is a black

755
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,120
Speaker 3:  box step in there. Yeah. That even like, even pixel binning is like

756
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,080
Speaker 3:  a little bit of black magic, but it's at least it is math with pixels.

757
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah. This is like math with pixels, underpants. No, Step two,

758
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,880
Speaker 3:  step three photo. Yeah. It's nuts, right? You're taking multiple exposures

759
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,280
Speaker 3:  off on camera, you're taking multiple exposures off another camera and a

760
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,240
Speaker 3:  different focal length and then you're producing a assume image at yet

761
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,520
Speaker 3:  in third and it's like, I don't know what's going on. Yeah. I don't know

762
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,400
Speaker 3:  what's going on. That's good though. It looks amazing. But

763
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,280
Speaker 3:  I'm dying to have some more detail on how this works. Just cuz you

764
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,400
Speaker 3:  know, they say when companies claim they're gonna do this kind of stuff.

765
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,920
Speaker 3:  There's a part of me when Mark Zuckerberg shows off is ultra

766
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,560
Speaker 3:  realistic and extremely well moisturized,

767
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:57,160
Speaker 3:  high resolution avatar. That shit's Dewey.

768
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You're like, that's great. This is a demo. Like whatever. Like, and

769
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,000
Speaker 3:  he tells you how complicated Google announces this stuff and they say they're

770
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,200
Speaker 3:  gonna do all this stuff when you see the photo, then that's when all the,

771
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,800
Speaker 3:  what is a photo? Like they, we actually, they shipped the phone.

772
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,720
Speaker 3:  Allison has it, we've taken a lot of pictures with it. Oh, it works.

773
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,800
Speaker 3:  And there's a step in there where they are recreating whatever

774
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,720
Speaker 3:  the image is that is just utterly fascinating to me. Well, and the,

775
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,640
Speaker 3:  the photo and blur feature is, is an even more like direct version

776
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,440
Speaker 3:  of tape. Right? You're like, it, I took a photo and it's like, oh, here's

777
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,240
Speaker 3:  a different photo here. I mean, it's literally enhanced button.

778
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:34,840
Speaker 3:  Right.

779
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,040
Speaker 6:  It's like, so it's my favorite part of the review on a

780
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,680
Speaker 3:  Slide that photo ular slider. Yeah.

781
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,480
Speaker 6:  I just, I spent, I'm, I'm like, I just scroll down to look at it again and

782
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,360
Speaker 6:  I'm just like, we look at this guy, he's so unfocused. His hair is

783
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,320
Speaker 6:  so detailed blur. It's great.

784
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But like the computer just made up the detail.

785
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like, and I think we, we've seen that sometimes with Adobe

786
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:56,640
Speaker 6:  too.

787
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,840
Speaker 3:  Oh, David zoomed way in on this thing. I'm watching, I'm watching him do

788
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,760
Speaker 3:  the slider pixel by pixel. There's just something about his

789
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,720
Speaker 3:  eye that doesn't look human. Yeah. Because a computer

790
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,880
Speaker 3:  made it up, right? Yeah. That's the thing, right? It looks drawn like a,

791
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,640
Speaker 3:  it looks better. Like it clearly improves the photo in terms of like, it

792
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,960
Speaker 3:  looks more like what a photo should look like. But as I look at this, he

793
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,800
Speaker 3:  looks less like a person in the processed photo. This is a

794
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,400
Speaker 3:  shot of basically, I think it's Novakovic from a bunch of years ago right

795
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,080
Speaker 3:  after he hit a tennis shot and it's like a profile shot and it's, it's blurry

796
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,480
Speaker 3:  in the like person who is slightly, slightly moving blurry. Yeah. Right.

797
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Speaker 3:  And then you, you go over and it's like, it looks a little like if you just

798
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,360
Speaker 3:  open like the photos app and just crank sharpness up to a thousand in

799
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,560
Speaker 3:  that it, it kind of looks like it just drew edges around it. But then there's

800
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,880
Speaker 3:  like something in his eyes that it just, it he looks less human

801
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,320
Speaker 3:  afterwards. Yeah. And it's a little creepy. Well

802
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,200
Speaker 6:  Like it gives him these highlights that just feel that again, feel like that

803
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,560
Speaker 6:  that the sharpening thing in Photoshop where you're just like, Oh that's

804
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,360
Speaker 6:  a little unpleasant. He's got like highlights on his face. There's like a

805
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,120
Speaker 6:  guy in the background wearing a, a striped shirt and his shirt just gets

806
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,440
Speaker 6:  gross looking when when it goes to

807
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,920
Speaker 3:  The computer is like, your shirt's a little uglier than before. Now this

808
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,720
Speaker 3:  is how I perceive reality. That guy, his shirt sucks.

809
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:16,200
Speaker 3:  He sucks. I That's fine. Look, go read the reviews. Allison

810
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,680
Speaker 3:  Sway is, they're slightly better versions of last year's phone. They're competitive

811
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,720
Speaker 3:  with Apple and Samsung. What more can you ask for? And I think that ties

812
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,040
Speaker 3:  well into a piece of Dan wrote today that's like all the action this year's

813
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,000
Speaker 3:  in the watches. Yep. Like Apple Watch, Ultra Pixel watch, Samsung's

814
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,800
Speaker 3:  latest watches, even Garmin's latest watches far more interesting products

815
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,600
Speaker 3:  than the iPhone 14 or the S 22 or

816
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,680
Speaker 3:  whatever like Right. The pixel set. Like they're all just like extremely

817
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,600
Speaker 3:  iterative phone updates and the watches are where all the heat is. So there's

818
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,000
Speaker 3:  just more to do in watches at this point. Yeah. Like more like work to be

819
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,720
Speaker 3:  done. Phones are just phones. There's little rectangles of

820
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,760
Speaker 3:  despair. Yeah. And it's like you can go in and slightly fix the things that

821
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,600
Speaker 3:  are broken and if you try to do new things, people freak out. Yeah.

822
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:04,160
Speaker 3:  I will say, and I'm just pointing this at to all the YouTube commenters like

823
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,920
Speaker 3:  out there who are like, you had never, did I do this last week? Yeah. You

824
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,240
Speaker 3:  did this last week. You can do it again if we'll make you feel better. No,

825
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,000
Speaker 3:  I don't remember what I did last week. I also did a version that's supposed

826
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,560
Speaker 3:  on YouTube shorts and Ven didn't post it, so I don't remember.

827
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:20,480
Speaker 3:  I was like, I'm too short about it. And Ven was like, Don't do this. Oh wait.

828
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,120
Speaker 3:  Speaking of things that have not changed about phones, I got an iPhone 14

829
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,080
Speaker 3:  pro. It has a dynamic island. Ooh. Do you know how many times I

830
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,040
Speaker 3:  have remembered to do something with a dynamic island? Zero times

831
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,240
Speaker 3:  as spoiler alert, the dynamic island instantly ceases to exist in

832
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,360
Speaker 3:  my brain. As soon as I got the phone, I turned off the always on display

833
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,320
Speaker 3:  because I hate it. Does not, It's awful, awful implementation of

834
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,320
Speaker 3:  that feature. And the dynamic island is like, fine. I don't notice it. I

835
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,840
Speaker 3:  do like the thing where there's like a little bit of a wave form and it shows

836
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,280
Speaker 3:  the podcast that I'm listening to, but like as a, as a place for interaction,

837
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,720
Speaker 3:  I have gotten nothing out of it so far. So if you make a cool app that uses

838
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,480
Speaker 3:  that dynamic island, please send it to me. Otherwise I'm just sad about it.

839
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,360
Speaker 3:  You're waiting on live activities man. I guess so. Like there it

840
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:03,840
Speaker 3:  doesn't, it's

841
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,520
Speaker 6:  Gonna be a game changer.

842
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,280
Speaker 3:  It's not gonna be tell you it's huge,

843
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:09,840
Speaker 3:  huge move around. It's

844
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,280
Speaker 6:  A huge moment in

845
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,880
Speaker 3:  Your life. Have you noticed it? Like now that you've got it and you're using

846
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,360
Speaker 3:  it, it's like, oh, it's like, oh it's, it's still computer stuff. Like sometimes

847
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,200
Speaker 3:  it does, doesn't do what it's supposed to do. I like it. My thing that I've

848
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,080
Speaker 3:  really noticed is there's something about the phone stand on my desk that

849
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,320
Speaker 3:  the sun hits it at the exact angle where you can see all the parts underneath.

850
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,960
Speaker 3:  Oh wow. So it just doesn't look like I have a, a dynamic island. It's just,

851
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,600
Speaker 3:  it's just like here's some sensors. Enjoy. I'm like, it's fine.

852
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,680
Speaker 3:  Richard Baller by the way, Vir has superstar Richard Baller that

853
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,240
Speaker 3:  the loved the audience clamoring to get this man back on the show, which

854
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,760
Speaker 3:  maybe you will do. We can't do it again. It was, was too much. Aren't ready

855
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,520
Speaker 3:  too good. The people aren't ready. He showed up. He dunked on crypto for

856
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,520
Speaker 3:  45 minutes. You left. That's it. That's the full Richard experience. There's

857
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,120
Speaker 3:  a Android version of Dynamic Island and Richard is,

858
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,000
Speaker 3:  he keeps posting it on the site cuz we had quick posts. He keeps pointing

859
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,760
Speaker 3:  out. It's better than the dynamic. It's very good. It's very good. Okay,

860
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,000
Speaker 3:  we gotta take a break. We still have like 9,000 Microsoft announcements to

861
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,440
Speaker 3:  get through, so we'll take a break while, be right back.

862
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,500
Speaker 9:  Kara Switcher here. You may know me as the person who made Mark Zuckerberg's

863
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,300
Speaker 9:  sweat pushed Kim Kardashian to talk dollars or got Secretary

864
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,220
Speaker 9:  Mayor Pete Buttigieg to eat a juicy strawberry live on stage.

865
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,980
Speaker 9:  Okay. That one was awkward, but that's what I like to do. Make

866
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,140
Speaker 9:  powerful people comfortable with being uncomfortable. Now I'll be doing that

867
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,540
Speaker 9:  on my new show from New York Magazine on with Kara Swisher.

868
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,460
Speaker 9:  We'll bring you news and the newsmakers I'm paying attention to and

869
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:43,060
Speaker 9:  we'll do it twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. Go check it out

870
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,140
Speaker 9:  on with Kara Swisher wherever you get your podcasts.

871
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:57,250
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. I don't even know how to get through

872
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,770
Speaker 3:  the amount of Microsoft News. There is. Alex, do you wanna try?

873
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,410
Speaker 6:  We start with teams. Start with

874
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,610
Speaker 3:  Work. Our here here's, there's only one piece of important Microsoft News.

875
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,170
Speaker 3:  Microsoft Office is being rebranded to Microsoft 365

876
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:10,610
Speaker 2:  Woo.

877
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:11,770
Speaker 6:  Which

878
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,690
Speaker 3:  Is just, I don't like it. It's weird. I like it. I hate it.

879
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,730
Speaker 6:  I'm saying that, I know David hates

880
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:19,210
Speaker 3:  It. Yeah, you go first. I'd like to hear your case so I can pick it apart

881
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:19,730
Speaker 3:  piece by piece.

882
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,890
Speaker 6:  I, I like it. Not necessarily like for me as a person,

883
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:27,570
Speaker 6:  but I like it for Microsoft attempting to get away from the fact that they're

884
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,650
Speaker 6:  known as the boring office company by being like, what if we just get rid

885
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,530
Speaker 6:  of that word because work is now 365 days a year

886
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,730
Speaker 6:  and so will we. Yeah. Like and in that way I'm like, yes,

887
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,650
Speaker 6:  this makes a lot of sense. This is what a great branding exercise. But that,

888
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,490
Speaker 6:  that's as far as I get. I'm just like neat.

889
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,650
Speaker 3:  It sounds like the store brand at the grocery store. That's what I have to

890
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,210
Speaker 3:  offer you. Yeah, it absolutely does.

891
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,410
Speaker 6:  Okay. It's Whole Foods.

892
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,490
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I have two thoughts on this. One. 365

893
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,290
Speaker 3:  is a bad brand that no one is allowed to have because the Earth

894
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,170
Speaker 3:  has it. Like the, Our Planet has a

895
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:06,050
Speaker 3:  trademark on 365 as a brand. So you, no one else

896
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,970
Speaker 3:  gets to have that. Also, do you know what everyone on Earth

897
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:13,570
Speaker 3:  knows about Microsoft Office? It is like

898
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,090
Speaker 3:  honestly on in the scheme of like brand recognition, there are probably

899
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:21,930
Speaker 3:  not that many things that have more of it than Microsoft Office. So now this

900
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,650
Speaker 3:  is not like Google trying to rebrand G Suite into Google Workspace

901
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,370
Speaker 3:  and look how messy that's been. This is Microsoft taking like one of

902
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:33,170
Speaker 3:  its oldest most successful and best known products and giving it

903
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,090
Speaker 3:  a stupid name for no reason. This like, this just, I can imagine

904
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:40,050
Speaker 3:  the meeting here, which is my favorite part of this. It's a bunch of executives

905
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,530
Speaker 3:  sitting in a meeting saying, Okay, we have a lot of office users but they're

906
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,490
Speaker 3:  older and like the Gen Z doesn't vibe with Office in the

907
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:50,610
Speaker 3:  same way. And we want, we want people to think of this as something new and

908
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,930
Speaker 3:  cool and no one raised their hand and said, well as long as they're called

909
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,690
Speaker 3:  Word and Excel, we're not accomplishing anything. Yeah. But they,

910
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,330
Speaker 3:  So then they decide like, we need an edgy, cool, new brand. It's called Microsoft

911
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:04,490
Speaker 3:  365. Yeah, no it's good. But

912
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:09,090
Speaker 6:  Somebody skateboarded in with their backwards baseball cab. It

913
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,370
Speaker 6:  was like 365 and skateboarded out.

914
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:15,050
Speaker 3:  We had Office 365. Yeah. Cause everyone's, everyone knows that

915
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,930
Speaker 3:  that went great. Well that's how you pay for it 365 days a

916
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:22,370
Speaker 3:  year. Yeah. The SA Smile in Office is

917
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:26,130
Speaker 3:  365. It does seem like a huge miss.

918
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,530
Speaker 3:  And I buy that. They were like, the kids hate work. Right. You get a bunch

919
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:34,410
Speaker 3:  of cranky holds and you're like, these kids today don't wanna work. You

920
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,810
Speaker 3:  can't tell 'em to go back to the office. Yeah. So we're gonna call it like

921
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,570
Speaker 3:  Microsoft Kick ass fun time. Yeah. Microsoft work from home.

922
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:46,130
Speaker 3:  Microsoft Vacation Days. That's

923
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,890
Speaker 6:  What they did. They absolutely were like, Oh no, we, we, The kids don't like

924
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,850
Speaker 6:  the office. The Gen Z, they're 12 and they hate the office because

925
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:54,290
Speaker 6:  they're 12.

926
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:57,890
Speaker 3:  But we are Microsoft and we are unavoidable. Yeah.

927
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,290
Speaker 3:  It is one of the most baffling brand decisions all the time. One of the

928
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:06,050
Speaker 3:  strongest brands in all of tech is Microsoft Office. Next they're gonna call

929
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,850
Speaker 3:  Windows Computer Time and it's not gonna work. Yeah.

930
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:13,730
Speaker 3:  Windows 24 7. Windows 24 7. So

931
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,250
Speaker 3:  what they're allowed to do, because they got rid of this year's, the art

932
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,490
Speaker 3:  version 10, they got rid of the office brand name. They can roll more products

933
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:23,370
Speaker 3:  into it. Right. So Office was tightly defined. The bundles getting too big.

934
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:27,610
Speaker 3:  Microsoft 365 is like anything, I can't even think

935
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,730
Speaker 3:  like at some point they'd be like, Xbox, that part of the Microsoft

936
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:32,890
Speaker 3:  365 family,

937
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,290
Speaker 6:  It's coming. That's

938
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:38,210
Speaker 3:  Absolutely Just get Ready. They did it. Yeah. They were like, well Microsoft

939
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,650
Speaker 3:  Designer isn't an office product. And somebody goes, Well we gotta change

940
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,930
Speaker 3:  that then. Yeah, at some point they're gonna bring back the office branding

941
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:48,890
Speaker 3:  just for the word Excel and PowerPoint and one, One Drive,

942
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:52,370
Speaker 3:  one note, whatever it's called. It's just, if you have a good brand that

943
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,090
Speaker 3:  everybody knows that has been very successful you for, for you for decades,

944
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,690
Speaker 3:  don't change it. Yeah. There's my free business advice for you for the day.

945
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:02,330
Speaker 3:  Just change the logo. I be mad about the logo. Trust me. You gotta

946
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:06,210
Speaker 3:  believe me. Coca-Cola we're now Soda America. Like it's nothing. It's nothing.

947
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,450
Speaker 3:  F 365 again sounds like the store brand. Yeah.

948
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,570
Speaker 3:  All right. So that's the big Microsoft News. That's it. That's the first

949
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:17,370
Speaker 3:  cast. No, they announced like 500 other things. I would drink fizzy 365.

950
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,090
Speaker 3:  I just want, I just, it's that's, it'll be cheaper. That's,

951
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,450
Speaker 3:  that's carbonated soil. No,

952
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:25,250
Speaker 6:  You'll get, you'll get Mr. Or Doctor Fizzy

953
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,960
Speaker 3:  5 365 Pit Bulls luster known

954
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,000
Speaker 3:  Alter Ego, Mr. Fizzy 365.

955
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:37,160
Speaker 3:  Dr. Fizzy is my father. That's horrible.

956
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,400
Speaker 3:  Oh my god. Pit Bulls got a son 360

957
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,640
Speaker 3:  can't for him to hit.

958
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,560
Speaker 6:  But they did announce a lot of

959
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,360
Speaker 3:  Stuff. They did.

960
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:49,600
Speaker 3:  Or

961
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:49,840
Speaker 6:  This week

962
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,960
Speaker 3:  I They did and they didn't, They, they announced a lot of products but did

963
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,680
Speaker 3:  they announce much? Okay, so let's start. Let's start with the thing that

964
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,040
Speaker 3:  I'm always the most fascinated by, which is the Surface studio too, because

965
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,040
Speaker 3:  I desperately wanna Surface Studio. I love this product. Love the Hinge.

966
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,720
Speaker 6:  I believe you mean the Surface Studio to

967
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:09,000
Speaker 3:  Plus Plus in the streaming service. It's very clear

968
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,720
Speaker 3:  why they named it the Surface Studio two plus because they changed virtually

969
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,160
Speaker 3:  nothing including the CPUs stuck with

970
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,080
Speaker 3:  11th gen until CPUs in there. But they added a laptop

971
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,760
Speaker 3:  grade 30 60 as a gpu, which is the knock on the service

972
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,400
Speaker 3:  studio as it always had a week gpu. So they're like, Do you want this gpu?

973
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:31,200
Speaker 3:  It's from last year and we are running it. Laptop speeds fine.

974
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:35,000
Speaker 3:  It seems great. It's also $4,300.

975
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,160
Speaker 3:  Which is been who Biased? Yeah. I want

976
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,400
Speaker 3:  one very badly. I've always wanted one and one day they're gonna make one.

977
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,320
Speaker 6:  The hinges cool.

978
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,120
Speaker 3:  The hinges cool. I I just make

979
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,800
Speaker 6:  A monitor. Why don't they just make a monitor? The Office 365 monitor,

980
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,800
Speaker 3:  Monitor 365 every day.

981
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,720
Speaker 3:  I've got this dream. Again, most of my life is Zoom meetings. So

982
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,920
Speaker 3:  I'll be in a Zoom meeting and it particularly tense and I'll stand and I'll

983
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,480
Speaker 3:  like roll the monitor down and then point down at people and be like,

984
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,080
Speaker 3:  we're making this decision. I don't, I have

985
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,280
Speaker 3:  weird ideas about work

986
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:15,600
Speaker 3:  ever been like suddenly is towering above me. I've not moved.

987
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,640
Speaker 6:  But you could do that in VR too.

988
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,640
Speaker 3:  Teams vr, every, every part of this.

989
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:28,080
Speaker 3:  It's just me being it more tyrannical boss at work, you

990
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,760
Speaker 6:  Move everybody else's legs, you loo over.

991
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,560
Speaker 3:  So the Studio two plus they added the 30 60, which is a

992
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,360
Speaker 3:  reasonable good GPU for that device. Yeah. To me

993
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,840
Speaker 3:  honestly it's so expensive. That's the main problem. Like I still think it's

994
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,200
Speaker 3:  a cool thing and the one they shipped two years ago is like relatively powerful.

995
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,160
Speaker 3:  Like it's weird that they didn't update it, but it's still probably a very

996
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,520
Speaker 3:  good machine. It's just twice the price. It should be. Yeah. It's crazy.

997
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:54,560
Speaker 3:  Then they did the Service Pro Nine kind of a lot going on with

998
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,240
Speaker 3:  the service Pro nine. Yes. The

999
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,920
Speaker 6:  The CPU stuff there interests me a lot cuz they did, They did

1000
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,880
Speaker 6:  Intel. They got rid of AMD or no, they never had AMD on the surface. Pro

1001
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,600
Speaker 6:  Nine. Yeah, that was just

1002
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,200
Speaker 3:  The laptop. Okay.

1003
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,120
Speaker 6:  So it's, it's kind of interesting to me because they did Intel and then they've

1004
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,960
Speaker 6:  also just gotten rid of the Surface Pro X and put the arm chip

1005
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:16,960
Speaker 6:  into this and that's very clearly like Apple's running circles around

1006
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,800
Speaker 6:  both Qualcomm and Microsoft for years. I mean two

1007
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,680
Speaker 6:  years but still that's years and now they're gonna try to compete.

1008
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,760
Speaker 6:  They've been trying for years. But this could

1009
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,560
Speaker 3:  Be good. This chip is a, it's a Microsoft Qualcomm co jam, right? Like I

1010
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,160
Speaker 3:  don't actually know anything about this chip. Yeah.

1011
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,240
Speaker 6:  What you know. Yeah, so, so this is like the next, in that generation they

1012
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,040
Speaker 6:  did the Surface Pro nine that had the last generation of this chip. This

1013
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,920
Speaker 6:  is the new S Q three, it's gonna have 5G support. This is the

1014
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,840
Speaker 6:  only way to get 5G on the surface Pro Nine. And it's like,

1015
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,120
Speaker 6:  it's, it's interesting but we haven't seen it yet. We haven't gotten to play

1016
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,440
Speaker 6:  with it. Tom played with it and he was like, well it seems fast enough, it

1017
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,400
Speaker 6:  seems to do the stuff. And that's always been the complaint about the Surface

1018
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,240
Speaker 6:  Pro Nine is it's this really cool super tiny, super thin device and it's

1019
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,000
Speaker 6:  awesome. But then you go and and try to do anything besides

1020
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:08,360
Speaker 6:  some little Office 360 fiveing and then you're, you're done.

1021
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,040
Speaker 3:  It's actually called Microsoft 360, excuse

1022
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,240
Speaker 6:  Me, Microsoft 360 fiveing. Sorry

1023
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,120
Speaker 3:  It's Dr. Fizzy to you Alex. Well I mean so it's interesting

1024
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,600
Speaker 3:  that you can pick between Intel and Arm. You know the surface line

1025
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,640
Speaker 3:  is kind of like an odd one cuz it caught totally blown up by the pandemic

1026
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,680
Speaker 3:  in a way that I don't think Microsoft is still reckoning with. Like the last

1027
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,520
Speaker 3:  time we talked to Panos in depth, he was here in the office pre

1028
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,600
Speaker 3:  pandemic. He had the surface was the Neo, the dual screen, the Surface

1029
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,640
Speaker 3:  duo. Yeah. They were pushing and the surface, what

1030
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,960
Speaker 3:  was it, the Surface prox that was their ARM device at the time

1031
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,320
Speaker 3:  and they were pushing towards this dual screen future. They're pushing towards

1032
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,880
Speaker 3:  ARM and then the pandemic hit and all of those plants evaporated.

1033
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:52,800
Speaker 3:  Like they just went away. So this is kind of like just a re just a

1034
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,640
Speaker 3:  refocusing of what they're doing with Surface in a real way. But like Windows

1035
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,520
Speaker 3:  on arm, like we're still trade off city and now it's like what you get for

1036
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,200
Speaker 3:  that trade off is 5G probably better battery life, unclear what the performance

1037
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,400
Speaker 3:  will be and then your other choice is Intel where you get all your apps but

1038
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,800
Speaker 3:  it's still an Intel chip in this form factor, which means it's gonna run

1039
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,520
Speaker 3:  hot in the battery. That'll be low. Yeah. The thing for me with

1040
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,440
Speaker 3:  the ARM stuff has always been that you're fighting a bunch of battles simultaneously.

1041
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,200
Speaker 3:  It's like there are performance questions, there are battery life questions

1042
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,680
Speaker 3:  and I would argue continually, most of all it's it's an app compatibility

1043
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,480
Speaker 3:  thing, right? Like you, you buy these devices and they just don't run

1044
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,320
Speaker 3:  most things because Microsoft has not either done enough or been able to

1045
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,240
Speaker 3:  get its developers to do enough to be part of this. And Alex, you and I were

1046
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,640
Speaker 3:  talking about this earlier this week. Like Microsoft is clearly committed

1047
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,560
Speaker 3:  to this. Like it, it has these developer kit out there, it's made it easier,

1048
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,000
Speaker 3:  it's issuing all kinds of new stuff. It seems to be mercifully done with

1049
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,160
Speaker 3:  the idea of trying to make a whole new windows just for Arm and it's like

1050
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,040
Speaker 3:  we just need to make actual Windows work. Yep. Yep. But I, I

1051
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,920
Speaker 3:  am suspicious of the idea that this is gonna be the one

1052
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,240
Speaker 3:  like I think Microsoft is right to keep trying on this because it has to

1053
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,960
Speaker 3:  and it has to keep convincing developers to play along and

1054
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,680
Speaker 3:  convince them that it's the future and it's worth, you know, rearchitecting

1055
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,280
Speaker 3:  their apps to make it work. I just, I have a hard time imagining that this

1056
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,120
Speaker 3:  is gonna be the one that like magically makes Windows work well on Arm. Yeah,

1057
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,720
Speaker 3:  I hope that's true.

1058
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,560
Speaker 6:  What I have to figure out like the secret sauce of, of the Mac of

1059
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,120
Speaker 6:  Mac o s is that they, they now just emulate

1060
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,240
Speaker 6:  everything on Arm, right? They were like, okay, we know a lot of people are

1061
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,040
Speaker 6:  gonna switch over, but also we're just gonna do really, really, really good

1062
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,240
Speaker 6:  emulation so it doesn't even matter so you can play your games or whatever

1063
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,080
Speaker 6:  and go And Microsoft just hasn't done that. And

1064
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,360
Speaker 6:  I'm not really clear why they haven't, I

1065
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,200
Speaker 3:  Mean part of it is the chips, right? Like the, the max just has so much

1066
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,800
Speaker 3:  performance to spare that it can, it can do a lot of that

1067
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,720
Speaker 3:  emulation pretty successfully in a way that, you know, these, these deeply

1068
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,360
Speaker 3:  subpar Qualcomm chips just have not been able to hack so far.

1069
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,480
Speaker 3:  I would also say right catalyst on the Mac is like all over the place In

1070
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,720
Speaker 3:  my experience, I've had some apps that work really well. Really I've had

1071
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,400
Speaker 3:  some apps that suck and I don't know if that's just my own experience but

1072
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,760
Speaker 3:  that's, that's certainly what I've seen sometimes. But I think Microsoft,

1073
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,840
Speaker 3:  again, it's, it's like back to that same thing, right? You kinda have to

1074
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,680
Speaker 3:  get all these things right simultaneously before it's gonna really work.

1075
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,960
Speaker 3:  And it's a weird sort of chicken and egg problem where it's like without

1076
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,720
Speaker 3:  the right chip you're not gonna get the apps to work and without the apps

1077
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,080
Speaker 3:  the chip isn't gonna get you there because the apps don't matter. So it's

1078
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,240
Speaker 3:  like they, they have to, they have to pull a lot of things all together at

1079
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,880
Speaker 3:  the same time and have not successfully done that so far.

1080
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,720
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean I'll be real, I'm not super, super confident in the

1081
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,800
Speaker 6:  s q three. Like Apple has a ton of resources behind it to make really, really

1082
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,760
Speaker 6:  good chips and Microsoft just does not prove that

1083
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,840
Speaker 6:  out as evidenced by the studio two plus

1084
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,560
Speaker 6:  existing out in the world with super old chips in it like that,

1085
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,400
Speaker 6:  that kind of hardware stuff. There's some of that that they just are failing

1086
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:51,240
Speaker 6:  on repeatedly. So I'm not like, I wanna be excited about this. I,

1087
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,200
Speaker 6:  I wanna be really enthusiastic. I can't wait to try it out and see how

1088
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,160
Speaker 6:  fast it is but ooh I'm not confident that they're gonna

1089
01:00:59,160 --> 01:00:59,960
Speaker 6:  nail it this time.

1090
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:03,400
Speaker 3:  I will say if they have gotten closer

1091
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,930
Speaker 3:  than the thin and light long battery life reasonable

1092
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,570
Speaker 3:  performance, but it's Windows, it's a whole ass operating

1093
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,890
Speaker 3:  system that's actually represents the, the

1094
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:17,850
Speaker 3:  competitive break with Apple that Microsoft's been chasing for. Oh absolutely.

1095
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:21,330
Speaker 3:  Right. Hundred percent. Instead of like, here's here's everything you've

1096
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:25,290
Speaker 3:  ever wanted but we are gonna treat you like a baby versus Yeah it's not

1097
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:28,330
Speaker 3:  quite everything you ever wanted but we treat you like an adult to get a

1098
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:32,090
Speaker 3:  virus on their computer. Yeah. Like those your choices and like Microsoft

1099
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:34,930
Speaker 3:  might have a product that actually make that case in a way that no until

1100
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,530
Speaker 3:  tablet has ever really made that case. Two things I want to ask though. One,

1101
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:42,930
Speaker 3:  well two things related ideas. One, there's no headphone jack

1102
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:46,250
Speaker 3:  on this thing, which is just brutal for a tablet of this size. Yeah.

1103
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,650
Speaker 3:  Especially cuz the design is the same as last year basically. And last iPhone

1104
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:52,850
Speaker 3:  Jack what are you doing? You can't just don't,

1105
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:56,410
Speaker 6:  Well they have to make room for the neural processing unit on the new

1106
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,370
Speaker 6:  Qualcomm chip. You know, you gotta, you gotta, sometimes you have to sacrifice

1107
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,290
Speaker 6:  for stuff that may or may not actually make the product

1108
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:07,010
Speaker 3:  Better. Okay, so that's one. Yeah. Two. How well do you think this will take

1109
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,050
Speaker 3:  Tom Brady just absolutely ripping this thing down the field?

1110
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,690
Speaker 3:  Cause it's gonna just break it in in half. It's the first thing it's gonna

1111
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:17,370
Speaker 3:  happen. You know the NFL had to be like a directive to the teams

1112
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:20,800
Speaker 3:  being like stop destroying the tablets. Please. I hope that's Tom Brady's

1113
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,200
Speaker 3:  true legacy.

1114
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:24,680
Speaker 6:  Do they all use the Surface Pro Eight or do they give them like really old

1115
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,120
Speaker 6:  surface Cuz they know they're just kind flee.

1116
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:29,920
Speaker 3:  I like to imagine they're like surface rts. Yeah and they just barely work.

1117
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:35,080
Speaker 3:  That's why they're, yeah that's pretty good. Last piece of

1118
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,000
Speaker 3:  Microsoft hardware really is the Surface laptop five. This is basically

1119
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,560
Speaker 3:  another chip story. So last year Microsoft hedged some

1120
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,320
Speaker 3:  bets added some AMD into the mix AMD price,

1121
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,240
Speaker 3:  performance, heat kind of better than Intel for the past couple

1122
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,240
Speaker 3:  generations. You could see why they went with it in the laptop this year

1123
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,760
Speaker 3:  where back to Intel 12th generation. Can I run a conspiracy theory by you?

1124
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,560
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I'm curious if there's any chance that I'm right. So you just talked

1125
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,280
Speaker 3:  to Pat er on the other podcast that we don't talk about. Yeah, it was actually

1126
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,920
Speaker 3:  very good. It was a good episode of Decco. Unlike all the rest of it. That

1127
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,800
Speaker 3:  dude's a huge name. Oh my god. The acronyms. Good lord. Okay.

1128
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,640
Speaker 3:  But anyway, one thing all of these announcements made me wonder is

1129
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,440
Speaker 3:  like is Microsoft aware of the Intel roadmap and slowing

1130
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,240
Speaker 3:  its role to meet Intel at a point at which everyone is doing good things

1131
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,040
Speaker 3:  again. And so at this point it's like why are we gonna reinvent the wheel

1132
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,400
Speaker 3:  for continually crappy intel chips when something real and good is coming

1133
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:31,360
Speaker 3:  in 1, 2, 3 years And all we need to do is actually just match that and then

1134
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,440
Speaker 3:  we can run together. Why

1135
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,800
Speaker 6:  Would anyone wait? Yeah.

1136
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,120
Speaker 3:  What's her

1137
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:38,080
Speaker 6:  Intel screwed it up so badly. Why would anybody trust Intel

1138
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,640
Speaker 6:  again? Because what

1139
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,480
Speaker 3:  Other choice do they have?

1140
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:40,680
Speaker 6:  AMD

1141
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:44,760
Speaker 3:  But then they chose not to do it. This is what I'm saying. So is that

1142
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,640
Speaker 3:  why they chose, like is that why you keep throwing your light in? Cause otherwise

1143
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,480
Speaker 3:  I'm with you. I agree like you're nuts to not continue to

1144
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,280
Speaker 3:  pit intel and AMD against each other unless there is a like moment

1145
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,680
Speaker 3:  in the future that you're betting on in a big way. I just can't see any other

1146
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:58,800
Speaker 3:  reason.

1147
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:03,000
Speaker 6:  I wouldn't be surprised if external pressures like

1148
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,440
Speaker 6:  Monica and I were talking about this in the office earlier this week after

1149
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,200
Speaker 6:  the event and we were both like, she was super, super bummed that that AMD

1150
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:12,240
Speaker 6:  wasn't on this thing. We're like, well why isn't it there? And

1151
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,040
Speaker 6:  sometimes in the laptop world somebody says, Hey

1152
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,840
Speaker 6:  how about you just use our chips in your devices?

1153
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,960
Speaker 6:  And I wouldn't be surprised if that was part of what happened here

1154
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:27,480
Speaker 3:  But in like a, I feel like you need to say that again in like a much scarier

1155
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:27,720
Speaker 3:  way.

1156
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:28,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah like, like

1157
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,360
Speaker 3:  Can't nice computers you have there Tim, look what it's computers. Microsoft

1158
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,000
Speaker 3:  can just issue that threat right? Back to Intel being like, yes this is,

1159
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,400
Speaker 3:  Yeah it would be a shame if Windows didn't run on your chips Pat.

1160
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:39,120
Speaker 3:  Well

1161
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,800
Speaker 6:  I mean I don't necessarily think like also there's just money. Money

1162
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,520
Speaker 6:  gets, people just give people money and are like hey I wanna be exclusive

1163
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,480
Speaker 6:  here. Yeah. I don't know if that's legal or illegal. I'm hoping I'm

1164
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,640
Speaker 6:  not accusing two companies of breaking the law.

1165
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I mean they're allowed to. You're allowed to. You're allowed to spend

1166
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,240
Speaker 3:  some money.

1167
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:56,440
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

1168
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,840
Speaker 3:  It's a little cash walk around money. Yeah.

1169
01:04:58,990 --> 01:04:59,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1170
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:04,040
Speaker 3:  It's just fascinating. Like Microsoft's chip choices here are fascinating

1171
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:07,880
Speaker 3:  across the board. I agree everyone's waiting for Intel to take this turn

1172
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:11,520
Speaker 3:  but it's also Microsoft. The stack of things Microsoft has to accomplish

1173
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,560
Speaker 3:  with Surface is just as complicated as Google's pixel watch stack, right?

1174
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,480
Speaker 3:  They have to set the bar for all their OEMs. They have to keep

1175
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,960
Speaker 3:  both chip makers happy and participating. They have to not over compete with

1176
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,560
Speaker 3:  the Lenovos and Dells of the world. They have to compete with Apple a thousand

1177
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,280
Speaker 3:  dollars and above, which is where the Lenovos and the Dells don't really

1178
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,360
Speaker 3:  compete anymore. On and on and on. And he kind of just like the thing is

1179
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,240
Speaker 3:  inherently political like the laptop more than anything the laptop

1180
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:39,040
Speaker 3:  is inherently political because the OEMs have basically stopped making

1181
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,920
Speaker 3:  surface shaped things. Or they do but they're like very enterprise

1182
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,800
Speaker 3:  focused. So like, and no like Lenovo's not out there with a Surface

1183
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,720
Speaker 3:  Studio two plus like that's just like the Hinge engineers at Microsoft

1184
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,240
Speaker 3:  got They they got one. You know like PS was like yeah that's fine.

1185
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:58,120
Speaker 3:  This is the most complicated hinge in America and you should ship it. So

1186
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,960
Speaker 3:  like I think the laptop is in, it's where the politics really come to play

1187
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:05,640
Speaker 3:  most directly with this. But we'll see. I mean there's just like,

1188
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,960
Speaker 3:  there's so much Microsoft stuff going on and it service is 10 years. Like

1189
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,600
Speaker 3:  we should say this service is a huge success.

1190
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:16,720
Speaker 3:  It is accomplished. Every single thing Microsoft ever wanted it to accomplish,

1191
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,800
Speaker 3:  it really did. Reinvigorate Windows laptops. Panos has done an amazing job

1192
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,760
Speaker 3:  like running this program in the face of all these politics, there are

1193
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,680
Speaker 3:  effectively no companies that have ever managed to be the the

1194
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:32,440
Speaker 3:  OS vendor and the premium hardware vendor and make everything

1195
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,320
Speaker 3:  work. Like Google has not done it Pixel. No. Cuz Apple doesn't have

1196
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,680
Speaker 3:  OEMs. They're not a vendor of software. That's true. Way true, right? That's

1197
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,480
Speaker 3:  true. The Google hasn't accomplished it with a Pixel. Right? They're a successful

1198
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:47,320
Speaker 3:  OS vendor in Samsung is their primary. It's interesting. Blackberry and Qix.

1199
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:51,160
Speaker 3:  Yeah, Blackberry failed. Palm famously failed.

1200
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,280
Speaker 3:  We've gone through that. We have a whole documentary about that that you

1201
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,240
Speaker 3:  can watch. It's called Springboards. Very good. Basically no companies ever

1202
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,720
Speaker 3:  managed to pull this off, but Microsoft did it with the surface. Yeah it's,

1203
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,720
Speaker 3:  it's kind of remarkable. They pulled it off for the past decade, like people

1204
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:07,560
Speaker 3:  doubted them very much and they thought the OEMs would run and it kind of

1205
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,680
Speaker 3:  turns out there's nowhere to run too. Like it has never been the year of

1206
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,440
Speaker 3:  Linux on the desktop Sadly. So they, they were in a little bit of a stronger

1207
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,360
Speaker 3:  position. But I've talked to p I've walked around CS with P pane and like

1208
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,200
Speaker 3:  she's been like, look, we invent hardware and we

1209
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,080
Speaker 3:  license it back out to the OEMs and like that's our hinge and that's our

1210
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:29,480
Speaker 3:  thing and that's our design. And like you can see them pushing the Windows

1211
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,240
Speaker 3:  hardware innovation ecosystem ahead because they knew that Apple would just

1212
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,080
Speaker 3:  kill them and Dell and everybody else would focus on the high

1213
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,640
Speaker 3:  margin sheep computers for business and never sell the thousand dollar consumer

1214
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,280
Speaker 3:  laptop. And so like we're just gonna do it. Huge success. Very

1215
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,840
Speaker 3:  complicated politics that express themselves and things like the Qualcomm

1216
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,800
Speaker 3:  s Q3 and this like weird lack of arm but, or weird lack of amd

1217
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,040
Speaker 3:  but pretty rad. But you should watch the video with Tom and Panos cause it's

1218
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,920
Speaker 3:  great. Okay, let's do a lightning. Well the other Windows

1219
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,960
Speaker 3:  thing we should talk about before we switch is this Apple

1220
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:07,280
Speaker 3:  partnership to some extent I guess with Windows where

1221
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,160
Speaker 3:  I think, what is it you're gonna get music and TV apps both on

1222
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,000
Speaker 3:  Windows and on the Xbox, which is like, it's one of those things that

1223
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,600
Speaker 3:  both seems insane to me that that's a thing that's happening. And also like

1224
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:22,400
Speaker 3:  oh, an iCloud photos windows. Oh right. An iCloud photos. Everybody's favorite

1225
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,840
Speaker 3:  photos app. That is a thing that I care about that definitely What's the

1226
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,960
Speaker 3:  default? It's the default iPhone photo app. It's just there so that when

1227
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,080
Speaker 3:  I search phones it, it still works. I don't care about it on any other platform

1228
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,560
Speaker 3:  anyway. You get all your photos in your laptop, that's a big win. That is

1229
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,280
Speaker 3:  true. No, I'll give you that. Yeah. iCloud photos is legit. Yeah I think

1230
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:42,160
Speaker 3:  it was just, it's one of those things that it's, it's representative of the

1231
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:45,800
Speaker 3:  thing that Apple is desperately trying to do, which is like BA services business

1232
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,560
Speaker 3:  and like speaking of, you know, the politics between companies, Apple and

1233
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,640
Speaker 3:  Microsoft are not like famous for being best friends. And so it says a lot

1234
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,960
Speaker 3:  about what Apple is trying to do that it's willing to put music and TV

1235
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:01,400
Speaker 3:  and photos into all of these different Windows products like that

1236
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,520
Speaker 3:  is Steve Jobs would never in a million years have done that. And even five

1237
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,560
Speaker 3:  years ago, I don't think Tim Cook would've known that well put iTunes on

1238
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,160
Speaker 3:  Windows to iPods. But that's like that, that's actually probably a good example,

1239
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,240
Speaker 3:  right? Cause you get to a point where it's like, okay, this is, this is our

1240
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,960
Speaker 3:  move, this is how we reach a lot of people. And that's clearly where music

1241
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,480
Speaker 3:  and TV are next. Like a lot of people who have Windows wanna watch Ted Lasso.

1242
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,360
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And that's a way to get a lot of people to do so. And so it makes sense.

1243
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,920
Speaker 3:  It was just slightly surprising to me to see Apple and Windows be like, we

1244
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,680
Speaker 3:  make apps together. So my, my theory here is very cynical. So the

1245
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,440
Speaker 3:  game consoles are underappreciated as streaming devices.

1246
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:38,000
Speaker 3:  Tons and tons of people Yep. Run streaming apps on their game consoles all

1247
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,320
Speaker 3:  the time. And so if you're Apple, you gotta get the Apple TV app on the game

1248
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:45,000
Speaker 3:  console just to compete. Yep. Yeah. That's life. So

1249
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,920
Speaker 3:  they're like, we wanna go on this game console and Microsoft is like, haha,

1250
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:52,160
Speaker 3:  we tightly control the economics of the Xbox and there are no, it's not

1251
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,960
Speaker 3:  an open app store to get on this game console. You gotta come through

1252
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,720
Speaker 3:  us. Interesting. And they were just like, Sasha just walked around campus

1253
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,320
Speaker 3:  and was like, what do you want? We got one chip with Apple. They want, they

1254
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,200
Speaker 3:  want Apple TV app on the Xbox, like who's got something that we

1255
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,760
Speaker 3:  want. And the, the team that runs the photos tab in

1256
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:14,440
Speaker 3:  like explorer Was like, can we just

1257
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:18,320
Speaker 3:  get the high iCloud photos integration like every other photo

1258
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,120
Speaker 3:  service supports this tab. Please can you just get them to give us the

1259
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,920
Speaker 3:  API hooks? And Saha was like, Yeah, we could probably get that out them so

1260
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,280
Speaker 3:  that that was the trade. They were like, we want fast pairing AirPods. And

1261
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,520
Speaker 3:  Tim Hook was like, No. Yeah,

1262
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:36,600
Speaker 3:  you this was a straight up just tit for ta. You want be in the Xbox,

1263
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,800
Speaker 3:  what are you gonna do for me? Yeah. Sounds right. And they landed at iCloud

1264
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,560
Speaker 3:  photos on Windows. And that's just everybody listen,

1265
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,360
Speaker 3:  I'm for fast pairing. I want an iMessage client for Windows

1266
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:53,320
Speaker 3:  like death first. Yeah. That's when Craig Frederiki hangs up.

1267
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:56,480
Speaker 3:  He's like, here's, here's a got iCloud photos.

1268
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:04,360
Speaker 1:  Wait, I can't help myself. I I have to ask, do you

1269
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,880
Speaker 1:  think that they tried to get the Xbox, I forget what it's,

1270
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,280
Speaker 1:  it's called, but the service that has to run Safari on iOS.

1271
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,360
Speaker 3:  Oh do you try to like a game streaming app on iOS? That's where I thought

1272
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,000
Speaker 3:  you were going. Yeah. Yeah. And they ended up at iCloud photos. They're like,

1273
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,840
Speaker 3:  can we get the Apple TV app in the Xbox? And Microsoft was like,

1274
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah, if you let us do cloud gaming on the iPhone and Apple is like death

1275
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,360
Speaker 3:  first. No, absolutely. Here's our counter offer iCloud photos,

1276
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,640
Speaker 3:  which you can already access in a web browser and any computer on Planet

1277
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,240
Speaker 3:  Earth Fair. But now it's in the start menu.

1278
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:37,800
Speaker 6:  That's all that matters.

1279
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:41,960
Speaker 3:  It's a high stakes negotiation. Had teams in two separate conference rooms.

1280
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:45,640
Speaker 3:  There's one person had to walk back and forth. It's PTOs for sure.

1281
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:51,400
Speaker 3:  It's just like someone is gonna write the inside the deal that

1282
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,440
Speaker 3:  iCloud photos to Windows. It's like, you know, it's like a 600 page

1283
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,280
Speaker 3:  novel with barbarians at the gate. Yeah. I like imagining it.

1284
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,320
Speaker 3:  Right? It's, it's more like a, like a wheel you spin and it just landed on

1285
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,920
Speaker 3:  iCloud photos. It's like, cause like right past

1286
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,800
Speaker 3:  Mac integration for Xbox goes right past

1287
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:13,560
Speaker 3:  all of the iMessage stuff and it just lands on iCloud, FedEx and the one

1288
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,480
Speaker 3:  right next to it is bankrupt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. iCloud photos

1289
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:21,000
Speaker 3:  is like the 5 cents on the prices Right Wheel. And it's like well least we

1290
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,800
Speaker 3:  get zero. It's actually bad news. I the wheel

1291
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,680
Speaker 3:  spinning goes are great. All One last

1292
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:32,360
Speaker 3:  thing we should mention before we get outta here. Netflix disclosure.

1293
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:36,280
Speaker 3:  We made a Netflix show Box Media makes, Netflix shows Comcast investor in

1294
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,280
Speaker 3:  box media. Everyone has, everyone here owns a television. Everyone hears

1295
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,360
Speaker 3:  a Netflix subscriber theory disclosures for day. All right, what are we but

1296
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,040
Speaker 3:  Paws and the Great Game of Capitalism and Netflix is adding ads,

1297
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:49,840
Speaker 3:  it's gonna cost 6 99 a month ads by the way, run by Microsoft.

1298
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,360
Speaker 3:  Microsoft shown up and everyone's announcements this week. Seriously? Do

1299
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,240
Speaker 3:  you have something you're not syntax. Microsoft will be there and they will

1300
01:12:56,450 --> 01:13:00,240
Speaker 3:  rebrand off. This is probably involved. It's called Netflix 365.

1301
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,240
Speaker 3:  Now all the Netflix ads are just for teams. Well

1302
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,160
Speaker 6:  No that's how you do group watch. Now it's through teams.

1303
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,640
Speaker 3:  Like all the Amazon ads on football are just for Amazon.

1304
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:12,920
Speaker 3:  Last week the ads were for Hero and I was like, you guys like just let's

1305
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,880
Speaker 3:  someone else buy adss. Like if you're watching football

1306
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,880
Speaker 3:  Thursday night football streaming on Amazon Prime, it seems likely you've

1307
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,120
Speaker 3:  got your wifi situation sorted out. So that's definitely the best case scenario

1308
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:28,080
Speaker 3:  for this Netflix thing, right? Is that it's, it's, what is it, four, four

1309
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,840
Speaker 3:  to five minutes of ads per hour. If that four to five minutes is just trailers

1310
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,120
Speaker 3:  for other Netflix shows like I'm down me. So let's do this.

1311
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:38,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah. $7 a month Nielsen is gonna start offering data about

1312
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,760
Speaker 3:  Netflix audience for the ad business only. Which is

1313
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:46,640
Speaker 3:  fascinating. But ad buyers want a standard source of data

1314
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,320
Speaker 3:  to know who their ads are hitting. So letting Nielsen into the ad side but

1315
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,920
Speaker 3:  not the paid side. So Reed can still do fake numbers whenever he wants.

1316
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,280
Speaker 3:  It was the most watch show on Netflix.

1317
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:58,040
Speaker 6:  Sure, sure.

1318
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,440
Speaker 3:  We that means something to somebody. Believe you. And then they're gonna

1319
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,840
Speaker 3:  do less ads than competitors. Here you go.

1320
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,800
Speaker 6:  When do you think they start standardizing their, the lengths of shows

1321
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,640
Speaker 6:  like Network TV does Because right now they're all over the place.

1322
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,880
Speaker 3:  I don't think they're ever gonna do that. Cause it just like

1323
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,880
Speaker 6:  Too much. You end up seeing a lot of ads for like an hour and five minute

1324
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,440
Speaker 6:  show and you're like, okay, I guess I'm into my next set of ads.

1325
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,680
Speaker 3:  Yeah, well that's, I think that's why they're doing four to five. They're

1326
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,040
Speaker 3:  giving themselves a little buffer. You know, that's why this whole thing

1327
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,680
Speaker 3:  is like you're gonna watch the next one. Right. So like they're, I don't

1328
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,520
Speaker 3:  think they're worried about whether shows are 20 minutes or 22 minutes or

1329
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,720
Speaker 3:  35 minutes or whatever. They're just like, what we'd like from you is four

1330
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,040
Speaker 3:  uninterrupted hours. Well and I'm assuming, and correct me if I'm wrong,

1331
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,760
Speaker 3:  I don't think Netflix has said anything about like compensating content

1332
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,520
Speaker 3:  makers differently because of ads. Right. Because

1333
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,760
Speaker 6:  That that heavens that is a big, that would change argument right now in

1334
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,480
Speaker 6:  the unions. Oh interesting. The unions are all getting upset about this because

1335
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,840
Speaker 6:  right now when they sell the rights to these shows, they end up basically

1336
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,560
Speaker 6:  being like you own it forever. And then it's like, wait, I only get

1337
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,520
Speaker 6:  $5 for the hours of blood, sweat and tears I put into this.

1338
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,360
Speaker 6:  Right. I used to be able to live on my residuals with other shows. So that's

1339
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,920
Speaker 6:  actually like I think we're gonna be seeing a lot of that in the next rounds

1340
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,480
Speaker 6:  of union negotiations across the industry cuz they get mad

1341
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,320
Speaker 6:  about

1342
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,320
Speaker 3:  It. Yeah. And, and if, if that comes it's gonna be fun back the

1343
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:20,240
Speaker 3:  gamesmanship on how long should my content be then becomes really

1344
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,520
Speaker 3:  interesting Cuz even if Netflix doesn't standardize it, like you see YouTubers

1345
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,880
Speaker 3:  who have like vastly changed the stuff that they make in order to maximize

1346
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,560
Speaker 3:  the ad load in the videos that you see And like, But the YouTubers did that

1347
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,040
Speaker 3:  because YouTube told them to, YouTube was like 10 minutes. Yeah. And

1348
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,880
Speaker 3:  YouTubers like fine 10 minutes. But if Netflix says, you know, we're gonna

1349
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,840
Speaker 3:  show you two ads over a 20 minute show or four ads over a 30

1350
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,640
Speaker 3:  minute show, like tell you confidently what's gonna happen. But that only

1351
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,560
Speaker 3:  matters if the compensation changes. So I guess for now it doesn't necessarily

1352
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,440
Speaker 3:  matter, I'm not an expert on TV deals, but those residuals are paid by licensing

1353
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,440
Speaker 3:  to other people who broadcast the shows. Netflix isn't doing that. Right?

1354
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,080
Speaker 3:  Right. They're just adding ads. Yep. Yeah. And they're lowering the price.

1355
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,880
Speaker 3:  So yeah, I think they're how those deals get done.

1356
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:01,240
Speaker 3:  I

1357
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,560
Speaker 6:  Think those deals are gonna start changing. Yeah. And and we're already seeing

1358
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,440
Speaker 6:  that that that those discussions in those union channels and at networks

1359
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:12,040
Speaker 6:  of like, okay we need to start changing how we're doing this because we're

1360
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,840
Speaker 6:  getting screwed Because there's infinite content and not infinite dollars

1361
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:19,560
Speaker 6:  and dollars there are going straight to the streamers and bypassing all the

1362
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:19,960
Speaker 6:  creatives.

1363
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Well it's funny cuz none of the streamers make enough money. It's like

1364
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,760
Speaker 3:  it, at no point did we actually make this better. But the streaming awards

1365
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,040
Speaker 3:  are here

1366
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,640
Speaker 6:  Just a pyramid scheme. Disney's at the top and everybody else is just like,

1367
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,960
Speaker 6:  I guess we're also here making stuff. We're not Disney

1368
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,440
Speaker 3:  Subscribe. That's coming. It's launching in November. The other plan there

1369
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,080
Speaker 3:  was big Bloomberg piece, Lucas shot big Bloomberg piece in the future of

1370
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,920
Speaker 3:  Netflix today. So the ads are one part of the plan. The other one cracking

1371
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,600
Speaker 3:  down on password sharing. And they were like, not enough people are paying

1372
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,520
Speaker 3:  for Netflix. And these are the two things they're doing. Like the CFO of

1373
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,280
Speaker 3:  Netflix said to Lucas, here's the two things. It's

1374
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,240
Speaker 3:  ads and it's password sharing. Yeah. Haven't they said there's like a hundred

1375
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,920
Speaker 3:  million users they think are getting Netflix through shared passwords.

1376
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:04,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And so they're trying to reframe it. They know it's hard. They've like

1377
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,160
Speaker 3:  launched a bunch of trials in South America and they're trying to reframe

1378
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:11,040
Speaker 3:  it as not cracking down on it. But wouldn't you like

1379
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,880
Speaker 3:  to pay for your ex-girlfriend? What if you paid a little bit more

1380
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,640
Speaker 3:  money? Huh? That'd be nice. We're, We'll just see how this goes.

1381
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:22,520
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Sorry. All my old roommates. I'm definitely gonna start VPNing to wherever

1382
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,120
Speaker 3:  your house is

1383
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:28,160
Speaker 3:  just so it looks like I'm around. That's the, the password

1384
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,120
Speaker 3:  changes gonna get more complicated. People are just gonna VPN into one apartment

1385
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,320
Speaker 3:  at the start. You could do it. Yeah. I'm

1386
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,840
Speaker 6:  Excited for everybody to know what a VPN is. That's gonna be great.

1387
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:40,920
Speaker 3:  I feel like any, like the kids all know what VPNs are cuz VPN companies advertised

1388
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,960
Speaker 3:  so heavily on like YouTube and TikTok. That's true. And podcast. All right.

1389
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,520
Speaker 3:  We've gone over, it's been amazing to be in the studio with my friend David Pierce.

1390
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,320
Speaker 3:  It's an amazing to just send digital weed to you, Alex

1391
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:52,080

1399
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:18,200
Speaker 3:  should just say if you do read all the Microsoft stuff, send Tom Warren nice

1400

1403
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,920
Speaker 3:  that's good. It's really good. But yeah, Tom came to America, had to go back
