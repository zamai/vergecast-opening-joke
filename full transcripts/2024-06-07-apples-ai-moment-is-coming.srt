Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, Alex Cranz, and David Pierce discuss what they expect to see next week at Apple's WWDC, or "dub dub" as it's more affectionately known. But first, we take you through all the gadgets previewed at Computex.

2
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,665
Speaker 4:  the flagship podcast of a

3
00:01:56,775 --> 00:02:00,385
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Just thrilled to learn more about defense contractors who also

4
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:01,585
Speaker 5:  moonlight as game designers.

5
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:05,065
Speaker 4:  We, this is a real thing and I promise you're gonna talk. If you can already

6
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:08,585
Speaker 4:  guess what it is, God bless you because you are spending too much time on

7
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:11,505
Speaker 4:  the internet, which means you're our people. David Pierce is here.

8
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:11,985
Speaker 6:  Hi.

9
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:13,545
Speaker 4:  How's it going buddy?

10
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:14,625
Speaker 6:  It's good to be here.

11
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:18,025
Speaker 4:  Are you excited to manage multiple devices in an enterprise environment?

12
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:22,745
Speaker 6:  Listen, I did choose one of the stories in here that

13
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:25,945
Speaker 6:  is about Windows app virtualization, and I am surprisingly excited to talk

14
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,985
Speaker 6:  about it. So I'm gonna say I'm a hard yes on that front today.

15
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:31,945
Speaker 4:  All right, so we're opening with a lightning round. Yeah. The gadget lightning

16
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:35,905
Speaker 4:  round. I have proposed that we do it a

17
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,345
Speaker 4:  little differently than normal. Usually when you have a lightning round,

18
00:02:39,345 --> 00:02:43,145
Speaker 4:  we have a bunch of stuff and then we all pick one. Yep. Rest assured

19
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:45,465
Speaker 4:  that's how we're doing The third lightning round, the third

20
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:47,305
Speaker 5:  Second, I got my name next to my little thing. And

21
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:52,025
Speaker 4:  I feel like that is not how lightning runs work.

22
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:56,265
Speaker 4:  Like we have just made up an alternative to lightning runs. Really what we're

23
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,345
Speaker 4:  supposed to do is look at all the headlines and go through them as fast as

24
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,045
Speaker 4:  we can, and I suggest we do this. And then David,

25
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,445
Speaker 4:  David Poo-pooed me.

26
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:07,765
Speaker 6:  It's not so much that, it's just that you have many skills

27
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:11,925
Speaker 6:  in life and one of them is not doing several

28
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,485
Speaker 6:  things in a row quickly. And, and so

29
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:19,405
Speaker 6:  we have, we have, I would say, I don't know, probably 10 headlines here.

30
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:22,525
Speaker 6:  This is going to take us four and a half hours. We're gonna do it and everybody

31
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:23,565
Speaker 6:  should just buckle up for this.

32
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:25,165
Speaker 4:  People love buckling

33
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:28,805
Speaker 6:  Up. I'm not mad at it. I'm just, I just You claim to have a train to catch.

34
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:30,725
Speaker 4:  It's true. I do. You're

35
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:31,085
Speaker 6:  Supposed to

36
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:34,765
Speaker 4:  That train today. I'm just saying, I'm gonna quote our transportation

37
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:38,885
Speaker 4:  editor, Andy Hawkins, who every time he puts the phrase buckle up in a headline,

38
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:42,085
Speaker 4:  the story goes viral. That's true. And then he says, people love buckling

39
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:45,925
Speaker 4:  up. So buckle up. Buckle up. That's what I got for you.

40
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,605
Speaker 4:  Flaming round time. Alright, we're gonna go through this as fast as we can.

41
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:49,045
Speaker 4:  Okay.

42
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,765
Speaker 5:  Like speed. Run

43
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:55,165
Speaker 4:  'em. Yeah. It's compex week. This week Intel showed up

44
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:59,285
Speaker 4:  after Nvidia announced all of its new chips and announced something called

45
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:03,205
Speaker 4:  Lunar Lake. And the thing that I understand it from this Kranz is that

46
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:07,085
Speaker 4:  they're trying real hard, but they've also gotten rid of upgradable memory.

47
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:11,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So, so they, their, their typical way of building

48
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:15,165
Speaker 5:  chips wasn't working for 'em. So they, they've gone a whole new route. And

49
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:18,805
Speaker 5:  This is Lunar Lake. It is just for mobile devices. It's not gonna be in big

50
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:19,805
Speaker 5:  desktops and stuff like that.

51
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,805
Speaker 4:  Wait, wait. Laptop, mobile devices? Yes. Or phone mobile devices.

52
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,285
Speaker 5:  Laptops. LA Okay. Laptops.

53
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,285
Speaker 4:  Because Intel being like, we're doing phones again is

54
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:27,365
Speaker 5:  Like,

55
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:29,165
Speaker 4:  That's a straight line down. Yeah.

56
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:33,205
Speaker 5:  Straight line down. Like I would say maybe 80, 90% of what is

57
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:37,005
Speaker 5:  in this chip, like the little chips within the chip not made by

58
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:40,605
Speaker 5:  Intel. Like, like it's based on like a TS

59
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:44,725
Speaker 5:  mc node. Okay. So they, they just fully were like, yeah, we can't do it.

60
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:48,165
Speaker 5:  You do it. So there's all of that.

61
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,725
Speaker 5:  They then they've just changed it all up and one of their big things is like,

62
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:56,485
Speaker 5:  we need to be faster, so we're gonna put the RAM on the chip, which will

63
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:57,165
Speaker 5:  make it faster.

64
00:04:57,435 --> 00:04:59,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The app famously Apple's move. Yeah.

65
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:04,285
Speaker 5:  People like to upgrade the RAM on their devices, so we'll see how

66
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. THEC market less

67
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:09,005
Speaker 4:  compliant than I think Mac users.

68
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:13,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So I, I I, we'll we'll see how it goes. They're, they're claiming 48

69
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:17,245
Speaker 5:  tops for their AI chip. The NPU specifically

70
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:17,525
Speaker 5:  48

71
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,805
Speaker 4:  Tops. Trillion operations per second.

72
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:22,525
Speaker 5:  Yes. Trillion operations per second. And this only matters because everybody

73
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,805
Speaker 5:  has decided that this is the way we're gonna calculate how good things are

74
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:27,845
Speaker 5:  at processing AI workloads.

75
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:31,965
Speaker 4:  Has anyone figured out what to do with AI on these

76
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:32,485
Speaker 4:  computers?

77
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:37,005
Speaker 6:  You can take a a thing in a photo and move it over here. Yeah.

78
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:40,285
Speaker 6:  I think that's about as far as we've gotten. And now you can do it very fast

79
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:40,805
Speaker 6:  and

80
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:44,285
Speaker 5:  Some of 'em have like a little chat bot powered by chat GPT

81
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:47,285
Speaker 5:  and you can be like, Hey, it'll be like, Hey,

82
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:51,005
Speaker 6:  That one's in the cloud. That's not even, that's all, that's not even anything.

83
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:52,965
Speaker 6:  That's that's fine. But that's like over there. But it

84
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:53,885
Speaker 5:  Could one day

85
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:54,925
Speaker 6:  It could, it could one day. Yeah.

86
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,445
Speaker 5:  Run on a laptop powered by literal lake. That's

87
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:00,045
Speaker 4:  What, when Oregon and Trail tries to bang you. That's happening in Azure.

88
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:00,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

89
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,605
Speaker 4:  I'm just putting, I'm just saying.

90
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:09,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There's no like local banging happening.

91
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,365
Speaker 4:  Intel, we got a new marketing message for you.

92
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:13,245
Speaker 5:  We helped

93
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,845
Speaker 4:  This computer will try to get it on with you. No internet required.

94
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,845
Speaker 6:  Local dimming is out, local banging is in.

95
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:25,925
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying so far the, the biggest consumer success of the AI industry

96
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:29,925
Speaker 4:  ha. Has been the fact that it's a little bit horny. Fine.

97
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:33,925
Speaker 4:  Yep. Okay. Do we think lunar based on

98
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,165
Speaker 4:  what we saw from Qualcomm in, in Windows

99
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:41,765
Speaker 4:  and then Nvidia. Nvidia was not a Compex or event, it was just

100
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:45,605
Speaker 4:  before they announced like 500 new chips, like a whole roadmap.

101
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,885
Speaker 4:  And they said we're doing this every year. It was very aggressive. Jensen

102
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:52,445
Speaker 4:  Wong looks very proud of himself. Is is this

103
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:53,885
Speaker 4:  competitive from Intel or No,

104
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:58,205
Speaker 5:  This is different. So this is not like in Nvidia and Intel

105
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:59,285
Speaker 5:  don't compete in this space.

106
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:01,805
Speaker 4:  No, I meant with Qualcomm, like we're seeing, oh, Qualcomm, yeah. We're,

107
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,245
Speaker 4:  this thing happen with

108
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:04,245
Speaker 5:  Qualcomm. Definitely.

109
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:07,805
Speaker 4:  Right? Qualcomm, like Microsoft wants to say, these new

110
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,965
Speaker 4:  Qualcomm windows laptops are faster than the MacBook error. They're better

111
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,325
Speaker 4:  than the MacBook error. They've, they've got AI built into them and then

112
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:18,405
Speaker 4:  our data centers full of Nvidia chips are rocketing into the future

113
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,245
Speaker 4:  and none of that has intelligent.

114
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:24,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So, and yeah, this is, this is definitely their, their attempt to like

115
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,805
Speaker 5:  catch up with everybody else because I think they just got bodied by

116
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:32,005
Speaker 5:  Apple for a long time in, in this space, in this laptop

117
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:35,805
Speaker 5:  CPU space. And so this is their, like, they've just changed their whole strategy.

118
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:39,445
Speaker 5:  It's all about power efficiency first, soldering the RAM

119
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:43,405
Speaker 5:  directly onto the chip so it'll go even faster. Everything is about how can

120
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,605
Speaker 5:  we get every single like piece of power out of this thing

121
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:50,845
Speaker 5:  while also keeping it as energy efficient as possible. And their,

122
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,525
Speaker 5:  their claims are really big. Like Right. Like they're saying like 50% better

123
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:58,405
Speaker 5:  GPU performance. They're saying 60% better battery life, which is

124
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:02,765
Speaker 5:  huge if true. Yeah. But it's also if true, we

125
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,405
Speaker 5:  still have to see these chips. We still have to see 'em in a laptop. We still

126
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:09,285
Speaker 5:  have to test them. There's a lot more to come. Intel always likes to make

127
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:12,845
Speaker 5:  huge claims and then it's like, okay, but what is reality?

128
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:16,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Intel has even less credibility

129
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:21,325
Speaker 6:  for making some of these claims right now than Qualcomm does, which is tough

130
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:25,125
Speaker 6:  because we're still in the, you know, let's

131
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,885
Speaker 6:  see if it's real phase for what Qualcomm just launched. And

132
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:32,925
Speaker 6:  Microsoft also at that event was like, we have stuff coming from a MD and

133
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:36,285
Speaker 6:  Intel too. This copilot plus P thing, PC thing is gonna be real. Everything's

134
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:40,165
Speaker 6:  gonna be great. I found myself reading about all of this from Intel

135
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:44,085
Speaker 6:  going like, yeah, okay, sure. And I hope it's great. Like I really do.

136
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:47,765
Speaker 6:  And I think Intel is right to do it this way. And I think the overlap of

137
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,405
Speaker 6:  people for whom this chip would be useful and people who upgrade their ram

138
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:54,645
Speaker 6:  is like zero. So I think that's actually fine, but

139
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:59,645
Speaker 6:  I just, I think Intel is, is lying

140
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:03,365
Speaker 6:  until proven, truthful in a pretty real way about some of its chips right

141
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:03,525
Speaker 6:  now.

142
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I also want to know what I can do with 40 tops that I can't

143
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,125
Speaker 4:  do with 25 or two.

144
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:13,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right.

145
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:13,645
Speaker 5:  Like, yeah.

146
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:18,045
Speaker 4:  What, what is it? Is it something, because we

147
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:22,165
Speaker 4:  seem to be in a spec war over nothing and I love a spec war, don't

148
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:25,645
Speaker 4:  get me wrong. You want to take me from 12 to 14 megapixels. I will talk to

149
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:29,285
Speaker 4:  you all day about that. You wanna go from HDMI 2.1 to 2.1 a,

150
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,725
Speaker 4:  we'll give you an hour. That's what we do here. I just,

151
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:38,125
Speaker 4:  what is it like, like I, I

152
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,965
Speaker 4:  don't need generative fill in Photoshop to go that much faster

153
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:46,285
Speaker 4:  and on my computer anyway. That's CPU bound. It's not even GPU bound. So

154
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,965
Speaker 4:  like what is the thing? And I, I don't think

155
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:53,485
Speaker 4:  there's a great broad consumer answer to that question yet.

156
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:57,125
Speaker 5:  The, I I, yeah, I would say a hundred percent. You're correct. I think most

157
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:01,085
Speaker 5:  of the, the answers are for like engineers and stuff

158
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:03,085
Speaker 5:  like that. They'll probably see some advantage from this.

159
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:07,205
Speaker 4:  By the way, not generated Phil a ID noise in Lightroom. That's the one

160
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:09,565
Speaker 4:  and my computer anyway. That, that's a good ones. CPU bound. Yeah.

161
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:12,445
Speaker 6:  Surprisingly good too. That works. It's really good. Like remarkably, well,

162
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,525
Speaker 6:  every time I use it, every

163
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,885
Speaker 4:  Time I do it, I realize I'm committing like, like heresy against what is

164
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:20,525
Speaker 4:  a photo. I'm like, the Pope should come to my house and bless me,

165
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:21,125
Speaker 4:  but it's

166
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,085
Speaker 6:  Only like gentle heresy, you know what I mean? Yeah.

167
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,005
Speaker 4:  It's a little

168
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:24,925
Speaker 6:  Goodhearted, heresy.

169
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:26,125
Speaker 4:  It's

170
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,405
Speaker 5:  Fine.

171
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. I have, we we should keep going. We're already, this is

172
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:30,965
Speaker 4:  Thing can see we're, we're gonna

173
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:31,645
Speaker 5:  Crack down.

174
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:34,045
Speaker 4:  Alright. Like, who knows? Question mark. Number two,

175
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:39,365
Speaker 4:  Humane is trying to sell itself to HP for a billion dollars. This is perfect.

176
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:45,045
Speaker 4:  David, the reporting from CBC says there's also at least

177
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,845
Speaker 4:  one telecom company in the mix.

178
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So one of the things that Humane needed really early on

179
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:55,485
Speaker 6:  was telecom support. And it has been working with

180
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:58,005
Speaker 6:  different telecoms sell around the world. I think it made a deal in Japan

181
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:01,765
Speaker 6:  fairly recently to launch the device over there. Like getting the AI

182
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:05,285
Speaker 6:  pin on these networks is crucial to it working so in a certain way, like

183
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:09,125
Speaker 6:  if you're Verizon, you're like, oh, all we do

184
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,885
Speaker 6:  is sell other people stuff. We are desperate to be more than a dumb pipe.

185
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:15,005
Speaker 6:  Like you can see how you have that meeting. Right. And I think

186
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,205
Speaker 4:  This not Verizon ended up buying blue jeans. That's what I

187
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:19,445
Speaker 6:  Mean. And like they will keep,

188
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:20,805
Speaker 4:  This is ended up

189
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:24,885
Speaker 6:  Startups until morale improves. You know what I mean? This, this is just

190
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,085
Speaker 6:  what they do. So I would not be, I would not be shocked by that at all. The

191
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:30,525
Speaker 6:  HP one seems very strange to me.

192
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:32,605
Speaker 5:  IHP

193
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:36,405
Speaker 6:  Just can't do this and seems to have finally understood that being

194
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,325
Speaker 6:  cool is not HP's thing. And that's fine.

195
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,725
Speaker 6:  And yet here we are. Yeah.

196
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:46,245
Speaker 5:  You know what? You never like, as you get older, you, you always

197
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:49,765
Speaker 5:  have those moments where you're like, yeah, I can pull that off. Right? Like,

198
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,405
Speaker 4:  No, HP already had that moment. I wanna be very clear about

199
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:54,405
Speaker 5:  It's, we all have that moment. I, I thought I

200
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:54,845
Speaker 4:  Could pull,

201
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:57,765
Speaker 5:  Pull off a leather hat. I couldn't do that.

202
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:00,085
Speaker 4:  When did you think you could pull off a leather hat?

203
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:01,205
Speaker 6:  It

204
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:03,685
Speaker 5:  Was like three months ago. Too long ago. Yeah, it was like last week, Tuesday

205
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:07,205
Speaker 5:  last week. Right. I, I thought I could pull off skinny jeans.

206
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,765
Speaker 5:  Like, like, like you always have these moments. Like, so

207
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:13,485
Speaker 4:  I just wanna point out in, in this comparison very directly

208
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:16,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm comparing buying Humane to buying skinny

209
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:20,725
Speaker 4:  Jeans and That's great. I'm I'm running with you. Yes. I'm just saying HP

210
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:24,045
Speaker 4:  went through its skinny jeans phase when it bought palm

211
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:28,485
Speaker 4:  and had an entire event that I went to in San Francisco on the water. It

212
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:29,565
Speaker 4:  was beautiful. Yeah,

213
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:30,565
Speaker 5:  No, this is like

214
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:34,165
Speaker 4:  Where they were like, here's the HP Touchpad, our web os tablet

215
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:38,365
Speaker 4:  that will compete with the iPod. Jimmy Iovine was there and

216
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:42,325
Speaker 4:  he got on stage and was apparently so blown away with the level of

217
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:45,045
Speaker 4:  innovation on display that he just went off script for like 10 minutes. Yeah.

218
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:49,125
Speaker 4:  Paul Jacobs, who's the CEO of Qualcomm spoke right before this is a real,

219
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:53,245
Speaker 4:  I want you to go watch this video. I remember he was like, Dr. Paul Jacobs

220
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:56,805
Speaker 4:  was incredible. I was supposed to say something about music, but you know

221
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,725
Speaker 4:  what's beats we don't make chips. Like it was nuts. Nuts.

222
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:04,765
Speaker 4:  And then they canceled the touch pad. No, this is like, no one has one except

223
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:07,645
Speaker 4:  for Dieter and I don't think he's allowed to admit it anymore. 'cause he

224
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:08,325
Speaker 4:  works at Google. Now.

225
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:11,645
Speaker 5:  I I would say that this is like,

226
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:12,885
Speaker 4:  That those were the skinny jeans.

227
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:16,005
Speaker 5:  These are Yeah. That's skinny jeans. This is like when you hit like your

228
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:19,725
Speaker 5:  sixties. Okay. And you get the motorcycle and you're like, I'm gonna be a

229
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:23,085
Speaker 5:  guy that does motorcycling. See on the weekends they're gonna be a company

230
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,525
Speaker 5:  that does Humane. This

231
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:28,285
Speaker 6:  Is the midlife crisis. This isn't the the cool kids phase. This is the midlife

232
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:28,565
Speaker 6:  crisis.

233
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:31,765
Speaker 4:  No, that's the skinny jeans. Skinny jeans were midlife was the midlife crisis.

234
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:34,765
Speaker 4:  Oh, that's fair. This is your retirement. It depends on when you think you're,

235
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:38,365
Speaker 4:  the sixties are, it's fair. I I would say it's midlife now that I'm in my

236
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:42,125
Speaker 4:  forties. This is, you're saying this is the the Harley with a windshield.

237
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:45,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's Humane. Yeah. In this context for hp.

238
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:50,165
Speaker 4:  I understand. Totally nailed it. Understood. Harley with a

239
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:53,485
Speaker 4:  windshield. I grew up in Wisconsin. There were a lot of Harleys with a windshield.

240
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:56,325
Speaker 5:  It's like, look at that lawyer go, he bought that Harley last

241
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:58,405
Speaker 4:  Week. If you're a Harley person, you have a windshield. I want it's America.

242
00:13:58,905 --> 00:13:59,765
Speaker 4:  You know, live your life.

243
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:01,245
Speaker 5:  You go real fast.

244
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:04,445
Speaker 4:  I'm a sports star person. Okay.

245
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:08,725
Speaker 4:  They also Humane the gift that keeps on giving

246
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:11,165
Speaker 4:  recall their, their battery cases this week.

247
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:14,885
Speaker 6:  It's a really tough week for Humane and it's, it's actually Humane has

248
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:18,125
Speaker 6:  entered that rare phase where everyone has gone from making fun of them to

249
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,765
Speaker 6:  feeling bad for them. And it is, it's a tough time at

250
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:25,645
Speaker 6:  Humane. But yeah, they had what sounds like one incident with a

251
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:29,365
Speaker 6:  charging case, which is a, a little like egg shaped thing that they ship

252
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:33,165
Speaker 6:  with the AI pin because the battery life is awful. And

253
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:37,045
Speaker 6:  because of that one incident, they are getting rid of that supplier and giving

254
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:40,925
Speaker 6:  all of the ai pin owners two extra months of service.

255
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:44,125
Speaker 6:  What they're not saying is whether they're going to replace anybody's charging

256
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:48,125
Speaker 6:  case, how they're doing better with the charging case. Like it just

257
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,285
Speaker 6:  seems like this company is scrambling in a really bad way and

258
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:55,045
Speaker 6:  I think correctly realized like, oh, something bad happened, it could happen

259
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:58,325
Speaker 6:  again. We have to stop it from happening. And did that before it made any

260
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,965
Speaker 6:  other plan. Because I don't think there is another plan because I think they're

261
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:04,085
Speaker 6:  just trying to sell as fast as they can and get out. Yeah. Yeah. It's just

262
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:04,965
Speaker 6:  bad times all around.

263
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:08,805
Speaker 4:  There is a very long times article about the inside of

264
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:12,645
Speaker 4:  Humane during this period and there's a lot of people saying, this isn't

265
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,445
Speaker 4:  as good as we think. Should we launch it now? And apparently being shut down

266
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:17,405
Speaker 4:  one slash

267
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:17,685
Speaker 6:  Slash

268
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:20,725
Speaker 4:  Fired slash fired. Yeah. Fired. Yeah. In one case being fired. Go read that.

269
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:23,885
Speaker 4:  But we'll see. I will say the idea of

270
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:27,645
Speaker 4:  either of the founders of Humane working for Verizon,

271
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:32,765
Speaker 4:  very funny, very funny. Or at and t and I I will say

272
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,485
Speaker 4:  just, I know we have to move on 'cause it's lightning around. I will say

273
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:39,005
Speaker 4:  once again, a workable antitrust policy for the United States

274
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,365
Speaker 4:  is to prevent at and t from buying anything.

275
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:44,365
Speaker 5:  That's what

276
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:47,885
Speaker 6:  You mean. It's like an anti-monopoly. 'cause it will just drag it down into

277
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:48,885
Speaker 6:  the muck.

278
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:53,085
Speaker 4:  It's, it's fine. That would work. You could, Joe, if you're listening

279
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,805
Speaker 4:  Donald, you know, you're in the mix. Propel, let's see what happens. Yeah,

280
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,925
Speaker 4:  let's get after it. You didn't, you didn't want them to buy Time Warner and

281
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,005
Speaker 4:  you were right my friend. Do you think Donald Trump has ever watched the

282
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,285
Speaker 4:  four three Senator Grace he

283
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:05,605
Speaker 5:  Hundred percent dead on.

284
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:08,765
Speaker 6:  Wait, before, before we do move on, I I'm just curious. The, the number in

285
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:12,045
Speaker 6:  the time story was that Humane has sold 10,000 AI pins. They were hoping

286
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:14,565
Speaker 6:  to sell a hundred, but they have 10. And my question for the two of you,

287
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,405
Speaker 6:  is that more or less than you would've guessed?

288
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:17,325
Speaker 5:  More

289
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:18,885
Speaker 4:  More.

290
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:23,245
Speaker 6:  Same actually, I, I I I, what I wonder is how many of those were

291
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:27,365
Speaker 6:  pre-orders and how many of those came after the reviews and after the thing

292
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:30,525
Speaker 6:  shipped? And I, I would be shocked if a thousand people have bought that

293
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:30,805
Speaker 6:  thing since

294
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:32,805
Speaker 4:  It shipped. What wasn't 10,000 number of rabbits too?

295
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,645
Speaker 6:  No, they sold, they sold like a hundred thousand rabbits. Oh.

296
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:40,405
Speaker 4:  'cause they were cheap. Yeah, I was I think you said on the show

297
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:43,365
Speaker 4:  when we heard the rabbit number the first time, like you could probably sell

298
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,925
Speaker 4:  that number of $300. Anything. Yeah.

299
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:49,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I I really believe that. Yeah. It's orange. Like

300
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:50,045
Speaker 6:  it's

301
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:53,925
Speaker 4:  True. Speaking of extremely odd AI news, someone just

302
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,445
Speaker 4:  explained this to me. Raspberry Pi is getting AI features.

303
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:00,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They're getting a, I believe they're, they're gonna have a little a

304
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:04,525
Speaker 5:  like add-on accelerator that's gonna give you 13

305
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:05,445
Speaker 5:  tops.

306
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,485
Speaker 4:  Again, someone tell me what to do with one top Wait, no,

307
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:13,245
Speaker 6:  But, but Neli, the thing that's great about this is now every other chip

308
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:16,085
Speaker 6:  maker on earth is going to have to convince you that they can do more than

309
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:20,045
Speaker 6:  your raspberry pie. This is perfect. Raspberry pie is now it's the

310
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:23,965
Speaker 6:  thing is $70 floor and this is the bar now, like in order for

311
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:27,245
Speaker 6:  me to buy your thing, you have to be more compelling than a raspberry pie.

312
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:28,325
Speaker 6:  Which I

313
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:32,125
Speaker 5:  Love. I I love this because if anyone can figure out why

314
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,725
Speaker 5:  tops matter, it's, it's people using like raspberry pies for stuff.

315
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:39,125
Speaker 4:  All that's gonna happen is a bunch of people are gonna like hook a raspberry

316
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:42,205
Speaker 4:  pie up to their video doorbells and that. Yeah. It's like

317
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:46,485
Speaker 4:  unhinged LLM horny responses from video doorbells will happen.

318
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:50,445
Speaker 5:  What or what if like pie hole gets better? What if like pie hole can do

319
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,645
Speaker 5:  something with ai? With ai?

320
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,885
Speaker 5:  I don't know what, what I don't like, I'm just saying

321
00:17:57,235 --> 00:18:00,845
Speaker 4:  What if the routing on your network was a little bit less reliable than it

322
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:01,285
Speaker 4:  was today?

323
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's just gonna start making stuff up. It's gonna be like, eat the

324
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:06,285
Speaker 5:  cheese Alex. It's got glue in it.

325
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,525
Speaker 4:  Like it's at the network level. It's telling lies. I'm into it.

326
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:16,045
Speaker 4:  It does feel like the $70 for raspberry pie is expensive. That's not where

327
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:19,845
Speaker 4:  they started. Yeah. And so it feels like this push is

328
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:23,605
Speaker 4:  just, it's making everything more expensive. I'm just begging for one.

329
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:26,005
Speaker 4:  What's it 18 tops.

330
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:26,605
Speaker 6:  13

331
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:30,965
Speaker 4:  Thir 13. Just just tell me what 13 tops are

332
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:34,565
Speaker 4:  for if you wanna max out in a, in a raspberry pie

333
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:36,125
Speaker 4:  compute environment. 13 tops.

334
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,245
Speaker 5:  I mean I do know what 13 tops are for, but it's a different time of tops.

335
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:42,925
Speaker 4:  Wait, the the trading cards are actual spinning tops. We'll keep going.

336
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:43,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

337
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:43,965
Speaker 4:  Keep

338
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:44,685
Speaker 6:  Going. Moving on.

339
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:45,605
Speaker 5:  Liam's gonna love

340
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:49,445
Speaker 4:  That. This is maybe a perfect VERGE scoop. I'm very happy

341
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,325
Speaker 4:  Jen Tui got this scoop. Yes. When I think, when I think of reasons

342
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:54,165
Speaker 4:  The Verge exists,

343
00:18:56,305 --> 00:19:00,205
Speaker 4:  we found a secret thread radio in every Mac. Right. It's right at the top

344
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:04,045
Speaker 4:  of the list. Like we had to manufacture the reasons people

345
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:07,885
Speaker 4:  care about this, but Jen noticed in a bunch of

346
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:11,645
Speaker 4:  FCC documents that there are in fact thread radios

347
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:15,925
Speaker 4:  in a bunch of max and iPads. This follows on Apple announcing a thread

348
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:19,805
Speaker 4:  radio in the iPhone 15 in 15 Pro, which they've never

349
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,925
Speaker 4:  done anything with as far as we can tell. Yeah.

350
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,645
Speaker 6:  Or even explained why it would be there.

351
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:29,165
Speaker 4:  Well, well no, what they said about the iPhone was this is for future home

352
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:32,325
Speaker 4:  app integrations. Right. Cool. Cool. Sure.

353
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:36,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This sort of like makes sense like in the world of chip design

354
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:40,525
Speaker 4:  at Apple scale, maybe you just bought a bunch of wifi chips and they have

355
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:44,125
Speaker 4:  thread radios. You might as well have them. But they've said nothing. They,

356
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:48,165
Speaker 4:  they tested them, which means they can be used. They're not just like

357
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:51,285
Speaker 4:  dark on the, on the chip die. But why

358
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:54,805
Speaker 4:  Apple said nothing to Jen. Jen ran around and asked everybody what it's for.

359
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:57,445
Speaker 4:  There's a bunch of reasons you could have faster setup. You could have a

360
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,565
Speaker 4:  low power thread network in your house.

361
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:01,405
Speaker 5:  That'd be

362
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:05,285
Speaker 4:  Cool. That'd be neat. And have the devices serve

363
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:08,485
Speaker 4:  as border routers between wifi and thread. Although you want that usually

364
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:12,325
Speaker 4:  to be stationary. Like having your thread border router leave your home with

365
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:15,125
Speaker 4:  your laptop or your iPad not great or your iPhone.

366
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:19,325
Speaker 4:  There's a bunch of other little like ideas people have that Apple hasn't

367
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:21,405
Speaker 4:  said anything. I'm kind of hoping we find out at WWC

368
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:22,845
Speaker 5:  That that's Jen's hope too.

369
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,285
Speaker 4:  We'll

370
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:27,885
Speaker 6:  See, I see it also, it it, there is like, we're gonna talk about this in

371
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:31,605
Speaker 6:  the next segment, but if you like, push this into the big, like

372
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:35,245
Speaker 6:  AI makes your life easier narrative of Apple, like

373
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:39,765
Speaker 6:  pushing into smart home stuff and like sensors and letting

374
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:43,325
Speaker 6:  your devices talk to each other makes a lot of sense. I still think the,

375
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:47,205
Speaker 6:  the like Occam's razor explanation here is that they got that chip for

376
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:51,045
Speaker 6:  free inside of these tri band chips that are in a lot of devices.

377
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,925
Speaker 6:  But I hope it's more cool. It's more interesting than that.

378
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:57,405
Speaker 5:  I was just trying to see if thread radios have tops in them

379
00:20:58,785 --> 00:20:59,805
Speaker 5:  So far it seems, no,

380
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,525
Speaker 4:  Not even a single top. No

381
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:02,365
Speaker 5:  Tops. Well that I'm

382
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:05,125
Speaker 4:  Out. And also very few uses for thread that matter.

383
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:10,245
Speaker 4:  We're we have to create the conditions by which people care about these scoops.

384
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:14,205
Speaker 4:  But a perfect VERGE scoop from Jen, speaking of Apple, another

385
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:18,325
Speaker 4:  weird one. They misstated the core count the number of

386
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:22,365
Speaker 4:  GPUs on the M two iPad Air. They said it was 10. It's

387
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:26,325
Speaker 4:  actually nine. How, how do you make a mistake like

388
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:26,485
Speaker 4:  this?

389
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:31,365
Speaker 5:  Like Yeah. Yeah. That, that's just the thing. This was very surprising to

390
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:34,965
Speaker 5:  see from Apple because they have a whole marketing department a, a very good

391
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:37,405
Speaker 5:  one when it's not like crushing all of art.

392
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:42,645
Speaker 5:  So, so the like to screw up, which I think is fair to say

393
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:46,125
Speaker 5:  that's a screw up, is to put the wrong number of cores

394
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,005
Speaker 5:  on all of the marketing materials. That's a pretty big one.

395
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:51,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And you think that the engineers, the chip designer, I mean because

396
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:55,365
Speaker 4:  it, the way these work is they pixel bin the chips. Yeah. So they try to

397
00:21:55,365 --> 00:21:58,925
Speaker 4:  make the chips the, the most number of cores, some of them don't get, don't,

398
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:02,005
Speaker 4:  don't work. And they pixel bin 'em and they cut down the number of cores

399
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:05,765
Speaker 4:  that are active to just the ones that work. And off you go. Every

400
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:06,685
Speaker 4:  manufacturer does this

401
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:09,285
Speaker 5:  Thing. Maybe someone just like forgot to be like, yo, we pixel bin that one.

402
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:12,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then it was up on the screen and they're like, oh dang, I forgot

403
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:13,645
Speaker 5:  to send that email last week.

404
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:16,925
Speaker 4:  Right. And then Apple's email system is like archaic. Yeah. And it just didn't

405
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:17,845
Speaker 4:  go through the approvals.

406
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:19,405
Speaker 6:  Yep. WebEx was down that day. And

407
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,565
Speaker 4:  They do use WebEx. I will say this is not in our show in nor Aaron. We had

408
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:26,325
Speaker 4:  the CEO of Zoom on decoder and he used to work at WebEx and I asked him if

409
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:29,045
Speaker 4:  he used WebEx in the past year and he was like, I don't, no.

410
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:37,005
Speaker 4:  Truly weird. They haven't said it. They're gonna make it Right because they

411
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:40,405
Speaker 4:  say the performance that they're offering is the same as what they said.

412
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:42,245
Speaker 4:  So you just got the number wrong. But the performance Right.

413
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:46,285
Speaker 6:  Well and even apparently the listed performance is right. So like

414
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:49,925
Speaker 6:  the only mistake that they made was a 10 instead of a nine. Which if that's

415
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:53,245
Speaker 6:  true, is like Yeah. Mostly it's just weird that it happened.

416
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:57,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But I do. Yeah. I, it's just like

417
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:58,925
Speaker 5:  I typos all the time.

418
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:02,365
Speaker 4:  This is what happens when you let the AI write your spec sheets for you.

419
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:07,005
Speaker 4:  You just made stuff up and I'm like, oh crap. See lightning round. This

420
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:09,925
Speaker 4:  is, this is all the more that needs to be said moving Right on. Samsung had

421
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:12,285
Speaker 4:  a leak, potentially a cheaper Galaxy watch.

422
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:16,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Samsung loves to leak things. They're not as bad as like Google,

423
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:20,165
Speaker 5:  but they're, they're, they're up there. So there's New Galaxy Watch. It's

424
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,645
Speaker 5:  gonna be like their founder's edition. So the FE edition

425
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,885
Speaker 5:  could cost about $200. Has a lot of really pretty colors.

426
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:33,165
Speaker 5:  Seems really neat if it's real and it probably is. So I think like Galaxy

427
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:37,005
Speaker 5:  unpacked is happening very, very soon. So we should know a lot more

428
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:41,885
Speaker 5:  very, very soon. But now we know a lot. It's gonna probably be

429
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:45,805
Speaker 5:  $199. It's got an EXOS W

430
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:49,445
Speaker 5:  nine 20 chip in it. 1.5 gigabytes of Ram

431
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:50,885
Speaker 5:  16 gigabytes of storage.

432
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:54,205
Speaker 4:  What do use with 16 gigabytes of storage on a smartwatch?

433
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:56,045
Speaker 5:  You put all only music. Okay.

434
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:57,405
Speaker 6:  I think that's the real answer

435
00:23:57,785 --> 00:23:58,365
Speaker 5:  All the time. Yeah.

436
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:01,725
Speaker 6:  Like yeah. Download. You just download a bunch of playlists and you're off

437
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:02,165
Speaker 6:  running because

438
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:05,925
Speaker 5:  People need their, their like, that was always a weird thing when I was reviewing

439
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:09,125
Speaker 5:  watches years ago. People would always be like, yeah, how many songs can

440
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:09,445
Speaker 5:  I get on that

441
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:11,085
Speaker 4:  Watch? Yeah. 'cause you wanna go for a run without your phone,

442
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:14,565
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah. And I'm like, why are you running, what, why are you running

443
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:18,405
Speaker 5:  and then you're just gonna use your watch. That's not people do it. Yeah.

444
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:21,125
Speaker 5:  A lot of people do it and I respect them for it. Sorry. Unpack.

445
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:22,885
Speaker 4:  This is why we have v on our staff. Yeah.

446
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:24,845
Speaker 5:  That's why VV runs. Thank you V Yeah,

447
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:28,125
Speaker 6:  V begrudgingly runs, which is the correct way to review products, I think.

448
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:32,045
Speaker 6:  And I, I love that about v unpacked is usually what, like early

449
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:35,605
Speaker 6:  August, right? Yeah. I think it's gonna be a really interesting one. Like

450
00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:39,085
Speaker 6:  the galaxy ring seems like it might be a pretty cool, this is coming, you

451
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:42,405
Speaker 6:  know, Samsung is going to have hundreds of thousands of weird ideas about

452
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:46,325
Speaker 6:  ai. Samsung will answer your tops questions. Neli, Samsung is going to

453
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:50,245
Speaker 6:  figure out what to do with tops. Will they be good ideas? I don't know. Will

454
00:24:50,245 --> 00:24:54,005
Speaker 6:  they be branded milk? Like maybe. But they will, they will

455
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:57,005
Speaker 6:  use those tops and I I think it's gonna actually be really fun if I, this

456
00:24:57,005 --> 00:25:00,885
Speaker 5:  Year I they're gonna have the most unhinged digital assistant. Right.

457
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:02,645
Speaker 5:  Like it's it's gonna have like a face

458
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:04,245
Speaker 4:  Big like bigby with a face.

459
00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:07,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's gonna talk to you. It's gonna make you feel very uncomfortable.

460
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:09,605
Speaker 5:  I am so excited.

461
00:25:10,205 --> 00:25:13,645
Speaker 4:  I feel like this Wwc and we will talk about that next time when it we're

462
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:17,325
Speaker 4:  leading into what I have begun to think of as the, what is a photo

463
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:21,205
Speaker 4:  apocalypse because Apple's just gonna let people start. But like it's when

464
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:25,085
Speaker 4:  Samsung is like, this is what the tops are for. All

465
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:25,645
Speaker 4:  bets are off.

466
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:27,525
Speaker 5:  We just made a new moon. Yeah.

467
00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:31,525
Speaker 4:  Just straight up like two moons. Fine. That's what the tops are for.

468
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:34,285
Speaker 5:  Each tops gives you another moon.

469
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:39,405
Speaker 4:  Speaking of ai, more ai, nothing. It has the phone three.

470
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:42,485
Speaker 4:  David, you looked at it apparently just AI apps for days.

471
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Did you guys see this teaser that, that Carl pay the CEO of nothing

472
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:49,485
Speaker 6:  put up. He basically, it's like him sitting in an armchair being like, we

473
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:52,365
Speaker 6:  believe that smartphones are the future of ai. And it's like, cool Carl like

474
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:55,965
Speaker 6:  great job. But then they show off a couple of things they've been working

475
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:58,725
Speaker 6:  on and one of them is just like straight up like

476
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:02,885
Speaker 6:  GPT-4 oh rip like push the button, talk to the

477
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:06,645
Speaker 6:  assistant looks very cool. But they also had this prototype they've been

478
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:10,445
Speaker 6:  working on of a dynamic personalized home screen, I guess you'd call it.

479
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:14,125
Speaker 6:  It's like a little bit news feed, a little bit sort of live updating

480
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:18,045
Speaker 6:  widgets with all the information you care about. And Carl has

481
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:21,485
Speaker 6:  been saying for years, including on this show, I think almost exactly a year

482
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:25,405
Speaker 6:  ago, that their big idea is like, okay, smartphones are still

483
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:29,365
Speaker 6:  the thing, but the app model is wrong. And how do we start to push past

484
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:33,045
Speaker 6:  this idea that all of life is just siloed off into a million apps. And I

485
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:36,965
Speaker 6:  happen to agree with that more and more every day. And so I think

486
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:40,005
Speaker 6:  it was interesting to see what they were working on and he just sort of said,

487
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:44,445
Speaker 6:  we're gonna start working on this stuff on the phone three. Like not surprising

488
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:46,845
Speaker 6:  that there's going to be a thing called the phone three, but interesting

489
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:50,725
Speaker 6:  that he said it and presumably it's gonna be launched this summer. Very curious

490
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:53,285
Speaker 6:  to see what they do because they've been kind of like

491
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:57,905
Speaker 6:  forward looking in some of their designy stuff, but have mostly just made

492
00:26:57,905 --> 00:27:00,905
Speaker 6:  like pretty straightforward cell phones and headphones. Like it's a, it's

493
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:04,705
Speaker 6:  a design around a pretty straightforward product. But if they're gonna start

494
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:08,585
Speaker 6:  doing this stuff, it might be more of a push into something different in

495
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,065
Speaker 6:  the Android world, which I think would be pretty cool.

496
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,745
Speaker 5:  Does it give you guys kind of like a Windows phone vibe?

497
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,865
Speaker 4:  Yes. I was gonna tell you, this is the episode of House where I brought up

498
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:19,585
Speaker 4:  the fact that I lived through the touch pad and now I have to be here being

499
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:22,945
Speaker 4:  like, this was the, this is Windows phone. Yeah.

500
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,985
Speaker 4:  Like we're just, we're just doing and Gadget again. Yeah. I mean

501
00:27:28,055 --> 00:27:29,665
Speaker 4:  this is how I spent my time back then.

502
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:33,545
Speaker 6:  A it is just 2004. Again, I would point that out. It just is,

503
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:37,865
Speaker 6:  but also like, it's really, it's long past due for us to

504
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,625
Speaker 6:  just admit that live tiles were a good idea and Microsoft should have stuck

505
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,665
Speaker 6:  to them because they

506
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:44,345
Speaker 4:  Were, they should have stuck to Windows. They

507
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:47,545
Speaker 6:  Should have stuck. No, no. They should have, they should have changed every

508
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:51,145
Speaker 6:  other thing about what they were doing except for Live tiles, which were

509
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:51,585
Speaker 6:  a good idea.

510
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:53,225
Speaker 4:  It's

511
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:55,865
Speaker 6:  A real like baby bath water situation. Like this

512
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:58,785
Speaker 5:  Is like less attractive life tiles.

513
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:03,665
Speaker 4:  There was a Microsoft event in Vegas where they announced like

514
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:06,665
Speaker 4:  the next version of the app model Windows phone. I'm just saying that's where

515
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:09,545
Speaker 4:  I fell in love with Teeter Bone. Aww, that's nice. Like we were, we were

516
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:10,185
Speaker 4:  there being like, are they

517
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:11,865
Speaker 5:  Say anything like eyes connected over the shitty

518
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:15,665
Speaker 4:  Phone Met we, we drank a lot. We we drank

519
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:19,385
Speaker 4:  a lot. And I was like, we will be friends now.

520
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:24,065
Speaker 4:  You you belong to me. We lasted a lot longer than Windows phone. I'm just

521
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:24,905
Speaker 4:  saying That's true. It's

522
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:25,865
Speaker 5:  Beautiful. It's true. It's true.

523
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:30,305
Speaker 4:  But the idea that Microsoft should have stuck to Windows phone because Carl

524
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:34,145
Speaker 4:  Pay is out here with nothing. Being like, what if we did this idea again?

525
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:37,305
Speaker 4:  What if we expose the apps to another interface on the home screen?

526
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,745
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Man. I don't know. Like everyone wants to do this, but the app makers

527
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:43,705
Speaker 4:  don't wanna do it. They want you in their app. Right.

528
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:47,785
Speaker 6:  I mean it's, we've seen this even like, again, WWDC is gonna be interesting

529
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:50,865
Speaker 6:  in that respect. 'cause we spent a lot of time last year talking about these

530
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:54,865
Speaker 6:  live updating widgets and the interactive widgets and the dynamic island

531
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:58,505
Speaker 6:  and this idea that like, oh, you can pull information out of the apps and

532
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:02,345
Speaker 6:  onto the home screen of your phone. I think we've gotten to like a two

533
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:05,985
Speaker 6:  out of 10 on where that could have gone. And it's been a year and like, I

534
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:08,625
Speaker 6:  don't know how many live activities y'all interact with every day, but my

535
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,265
Speaker 6:  answer is pretty damn close to zero

536
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:12,825
Speaker 5:  Once a week when I get Uber Eats.

537
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:16,465
Speaker 4:  There you go. There's countdown timers for various things that are gonna

538
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:20,425
Speaker 4:  happen. Yeah. All very good. Yeah. But it's also kind of like, yeah, I, I'd

539
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,625
Speaker 4:  super know the plane is gonna land in 45 minutes.

540
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:26,305
Speaker 5:  I mean I like, like the Uber Eats one is great. I'm like, wings almost here.

541
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:29,585
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then sometimes it goes up and I'm like, wings took a wrong turn.

542
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:31,705
Speaker 5:  Come back Wings.

543
00:29:31,965 --> 00:29:34,145
Speaker 4:  All right, we're gonna get through this whole thing. We're almost done. We're

544
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:37,145
Speaker 4:  almost there. We got two left. The ASE Rogue

545
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:38,505
Speaker 4:  Ally X

546
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:41,645
Speaker 4:  Sean looked at it. Alex, what do you think?

547
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:47,005
Speaker 5:  I love Sean's enthusiasm for this thing. 'cause he, he

548
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:47,805
Speaker 5:  went to look at it originally.

549
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:48,645
Speaker 4:  Rog or Rogue?

550
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:49,725
Speaker 5:  Rog. Rog. It's wrong.

551
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:51,565
Speaker 4:  It was, I know, I know, I

552
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:54,845
Speaker 5:  Know. It stands for Republic of Gamers. I'm aware of that. Which was a, which

553
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:56,965
Speaker 5:  was a gaming company that at a sous spot. 'cause all

554
00:29:57,265 --> 00:30:00,645
Speaker 4:  All of this stuff is in my brain. It's just right next to Windows phone.

555
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

556
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:02,485
Speaker 5:  Windows phone was really

557
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:04,245
Speaker 4:  Loud then. Right? They gotta spin up the dress.

558
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:08,205
Speaker 5:  Just, just, just really loud. No, I, I like, I

559
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:12,085
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm really optimistic. I mean, we both talk about this a lot.

560
00:30:12,085 --> 00:30:15,165
Speaker 5:  Like Sean and I's dms are just like more steam decks and more Steam deck

561
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:18,125
Speaker 5:  clones. Yeah. We've designed about four of our own.

562
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:19,485
Speaker 4:  This is how it starts.

563
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:23,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Someone call us. We, we've got great ideas. This thing is

564
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:26,125
Speaker 5:  is is definitely still pretty heavy. It's, it's definitely

565
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:31,805
Speaker 5:  beefy in a way that I think people will not find always so

566
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:32,565
Speaker 5:  pleasing. But is is

567
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:36,325
Speaker 4:  The Steam deck still just the the the prototypical

568
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:37,045
Speaker 4:  one of these?

569
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:40,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's, it's primarily because is it the one to be Yeah. 'cause most

570
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:44,325
Speaker 5:  of these run on Windows. Yeah. And that's not very

571
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:48,445
Speaker 5:  good for, for this, for this platform, right? Yeah. Like I think

572
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:50,685
Speaker 5:  that's the thing that Steam Deck has done really, really well, is they built

573
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:54,645
Speaker 5:  this really, really good platform so you can just pop in and start downloading

574
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:58,245
Speaker 5:  games and go. Whereas everybody else, you have to like futs with it.

575
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:00,165
Speaker 5:  You know, there's always something. This

576
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:03,525
Speaker 6:  Is like a sneakily exciting reason to be optimistic for all these new chips,

577
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:07,085
Speaker 6:  right? That if they, if they are as good as advertised, suddenly building

578
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:10,965
Speaker 6:  a device like this that is light and good and lasts a long time

579
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:15,045
Speaker 6:  and still does the stuff you want it to do, becomes a lot more plausible.

580
00:31:15,115 --> 00:31:19,045
Speaker 6:  Whereas right now you basically have to just shove as much of

581
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:22,925
Speaker 6:  a gaming PC as possible into as small a box as possible. And that

582
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,685
Speaker 6:  is just physics. Yeah. And physics is hard, but I will say on this,

583
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:29,525
Speaker 4:  I all the while Microsoft is like, what if Windows just watched everything

584
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:32,605
Speaker 4:  you did and wrote it down in a plain text database

585
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,845
Speaker 4:  And it's like, I don't, it'll

586
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:34,965
Speaker 5:  Be

587
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:37,725
Speaker 4:  Fine. But that's one of the reasons that's the advantage Steam Deck has,

588
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:40,845
Speaker 4:  is they were able to cut down the, the operating system. Right.

589
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:43,845
Speaker 5:  And, and this one like assumes their, their way of doing it is like, well,

590
00:31:43,845 --> 00:31:44,805
Speaker 5:  we're not gonna fix Windows,

591
00:31:46,665 --> 00:31:46,885
Speaker 4:  But

592
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:49,365
Speaker 5:  We're gonna make the battery a lot bigger. Yeah. There go. So, so that, that

593
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,245
Speaker 5:  could be really cool. Like, like this thing should have probably I think

594
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:55,325
Speaker 5:  the biggest battery of all of these kind of deals, but

595
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:59,285
Speaker 5:  We'll, we'll see. I like, I would love, every time I get one of these in

596
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:02,765
Speaker 5:  I'm like, oh, this is gonna be rad. And then I meet Windows and I'm having

597
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:06,525
Speaker 5:  to use a joystick to move a mouse around the screen and it

598
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:08,485
Speaker 5:  stops being rad real fast. Yeah.

599
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:12,125
Speaker 4:  All right, let's end it where we need to end it with the promise we made

600
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,965
Speaker 4:  at the top of the show. There's a defense contractor who made a game. Boy,

601
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:21,205
Speaker 4:  it's Palmer lucky everybody. What a surprise. Of course.

602
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:26,405
Speaker 4:  If the, this is a long and twisted tail. Palmer. Lucky we met when he was

603
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:29,685
Speaker 4:  a literal child. Speaking of things that happened a million years ago, we

604
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:33,525
Speaker 4:  saw the first Oculus prototype in our

605
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:35,805
Speaker 4:  like trailer at CES

606
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:37,085
Speaker 6:  2012, right?

607
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:40,565
Speaker 4:  A hundred million years ago. It was a young

608
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:44,125
Speaker 4:  fresh-faced Palmer Lucky. Yeah. Showing us a thing, talking about OLED refresh

609
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,805
Speaker 4:  rates and how he'd built the thing in forums and met John Carmack in the

610
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:51,645
Speaker 4:  forums of the Ole Nerds. It was very vir. Many things

611
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:55,405
Speaker 4:  have happened to both Oculus and Palmer. Lucky in that time.

612
00:32:56,745 --> 00:32:56,965
Speaker 4:  He

613
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:58,245
Speaker 5:  Grew a little mustache. He,

614
00:32:58,705 --> 00:33:02,645
Speaker 4:  The facial hair is, we're gonna set it aside. You're allowed

615
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:05,765
Speaker 4:  to make whatever choices you want with your facial hair. It's true. If you

616
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:08,325
Speaker 4:  wanna make those, we will just note them and set them aside.

617
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:13,485
Speaker 4:  Meta bought Oculus, they turned into the Quest line.

618
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,045
Speaker 4:  They fired Palmer. Lucky for being kind of weird.

619
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:21,885
Speaker 4:  Palmer Lucky made a bunch of weird donations to the Trump campaign, mostly

620
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:25,525
Speaker 4:  in the form of inflammatory billboards, I believe. Yeah. This is all real.

621
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:28,485
Speaker 4:  This is like in the past. And then he started a defense contractor named

622
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:30,565
Speaker 4:  Andrew, which makes drones with guns on them.

623
00:33:30,865 --> 00:33:34,605
Speaker 5:  And is also named after like a jk. No, not at

624
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:37,645
Speaker 5:  JK Rowing named after a JR Tolkien. Like

625
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:39,245
Speaker 4:  Oh, sure. He also has Cosplayed

626
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:40,285
Speaker 5:  And more of the Rings stuff.

627
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. He's also cosplayed as quiet from Metal Gear series. One of the, a

628
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:44,845
Speaker 4:  real thing that you can go look at a photo of,

629
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:48,925
Speaker 6:  One of the great sightings of my life was in San Jose. I was at a bar with

630
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:52,725
Speaker 6:  my wife watching the NBA playoffs. And Palmer Lucky comes

631
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:56,485
Speaker 6:  walking in with a tail on and just sits down at the bar and orders a drink.

632
00:33:57,595 --> 00:33:58,525
Speaker 6:  Just a delightful day.

633
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:03,325
Speaker 4:  He's been spiky with us. Whatever. This is all Palmer lucky stuff. And it's

634
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:06,405
Speaker 4:  in the, like, people arguing about the merits of spending money on Palmer

635
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:09,365
Speaker 4:  Lucky devices in our comments. But it is true

636
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:12,325
Speaker 4:  that he's made something called the Chromatic

637
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:13,485
Speaker 6:  And it looks sick. Which,

638
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:17,445
Speaker 4:  Which is rules $199 and apparently is just like, what if

639
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:21,405
Speaker 4:  you finished a Game Boy? Like what if you took a Game Boy to the

640
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:23,325
Speaker 4:  most Game Boy conclusion It could be.

641
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:26,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. What if you took all of the technology we have in 2024

642
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:31,485
Speaker 5:  and made a Game Boy from 1989

643
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:31,805
Speaker 5:  that

644
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:35,685
Speaker 6:  Plays Game Boy cartridges for like, it's, it's, it is exactly what I

645
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:36,965
Speaker 6:  want it to be. And it's like,

646
00:34:36,985 --> 00:34:38,885
Speaker 5:  Or excuse me, game boy color too.

647
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:43,005
Speaker 6:  You're right. Yeah. It has a, it has a color matched screen to the game

648
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:46,485
Speaker 6:  boy color. Right. Super bright, really good screen.

649
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:50,405
Speaker 6:  The colors look awesome. Like this, this thing. Yeah, you're right. All the

650
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:54,325
Speaker 6:  pedigree of it aside, this thing looks awesome and

651
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:58,165
Speaker 6:  it's 200 bucks. And I think like people love the stuff that analog makes

652
00:34:58,505 --> 00:35:01,765
Speaker 6:  and, and at least from the little bit we've seen so far, this belongs like

653
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:02,085
Speaker 6:  right there.

654
00:35:02,595 --> 00:35:06,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like analog I would say is for modern

655
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:10,725
Speaker 5:  nerds who wanna like get into retro gaming. This is for like you are

656
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:14,285
Speaker 5:  in retro gaming. Yeah. Because this is, this is like, what if we could make

657
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:18,125
Speaker 5:  it as accurate as possible, but modern, so like, like the pixels and everything,

658
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,645
Speaker 5:  you know, it's not a super high resolution display or anything like that.

659
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:24,685
Speaker 5:  It is meant to be the same resolution as the Game boy color,

660
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:26,005
Speaker 5:  which came out.

661
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,245
Speaker 4:  And then also it comes with a side of deep moral ambivalence. There

662
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:31,725
Speaker 5:  You go. And

663
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:33,165
Speaker 6:  Tetris, don't forget, Tetris

664
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:33,765
Speaker 5:  And Tetris

665
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:37,405
Speaker 4:  Very confusing product just all the way around. Yeah.

666
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:40,605
Speaker 4:  I don't know that I'm gonna spend $200 on it. I know that

667
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:45,165
Speaker 4:  Boy would I love to spend $200 on something just like it.

668
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:46,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah.

669
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:50,805
Speaker 4:  Deep moral ambivalence. That's, that's what I would say a defense contractor.

670
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:55,565
Speaker 4:  Although if Lockheed Martin was to make a 200 game, boy would we cover it.

671
00:35:55,885 --> 00:35:59,845
Speaker 4:  I think the answer is surely yes. Yeah. Lockheed, you have your orders. Yeah.

672
00:35:59,905 --> 00:36:03,645
Speaker 6:  Agreed. I mean, it is interesting like Palmer lucky it is

673
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:07,525
Speaker 6:  documented as having been into this for a really, really long time. Like

674
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:12,045
Speaker 6:  I I, again, all of, all of the feelings about Palmer. Lucky aside, he's

675
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:15,165
Speaker 6:  actually a person you would think would probably do a very good job of this.

676
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's gonna be, it's gonna be really interesting to see. He's also apparently

677
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:22,885
Speaker 6:  about to launch some new headset like Palmer. He's just running around doing

678
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:25,245
Speaker 6:  stuff now is it's very odd. Yeah. I

679
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:27,965
Speaker 5:  Mean that defense contractor money really helps out. Yeah. Seriously. But

680
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:30,885
Speaker 5:  yeah. And that, that's the, that's the challenge of trying to wear as many

681
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:33,965
Speaker 5:  hats as he does, is that people don't like sell a lot of those

682
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:37,925
Speaker 4:  Hats. Ed one of those hats is reprehensible politics. Okay. That's the lightning

683
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:41,165
Speaker 4:  round. We finished it. We did it. I dunno how long. Mila,

684
00:36:41,225 --> 00:36:43,565
Speaker 6:  I'm really proud of it took 45 minutes. You did a good job. It was so long

685
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:46,365
Speaker 6:  I only had to delete two things from the list. That was really good. We

686
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:50,365
Speaker 4:  As we went. All right. We have to take a quick break. We'll be back preview

687
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,445
Speaker 4:  of WDC and then a second traditional

688
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,365
Speaker 4:  lightning round for you traditionalists. We'll be right back.

689
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:02,245
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back.

690
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:44,815
Speaker 4:  which is really interesting. Traditionally we've seen

691
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:37,125
Speaker 4:  and you certainly don't want to tie that to the idea that you need

692
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:41,125
Speaker 4:  new hardware to do it. Right. The 'cause Apple has been on that

693
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,845
Speaker 4:  cadence in the past where they're like, here's a new iPhone.

694
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:47,925
Speaker 4:  We've gated some camera feature that you could definitely do on the old iPhone

695
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:51,245
Speaker 4:  to the new iPhone. But here, this is about the future of iOS. It's about

696
00:41:51,405 --> 00:41:55,245
Speaker 4:  the future of Siri. It seems like you need all of the focus to be like

697
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:59,045
Speaker 4:  a great upgrade that's coming to everybody with a recent iPhone

698
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:03,845
Speaker 5:  Ai. Yeah. Apple does not wanna be talking about Tops. I mean, not just because

699
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:07,605
Speaker 5:  their, their processors have the fewest, but Yeah, they, that that's not

700
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:08,765
Speaker 5:  a thing. They wanna, they they

701
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:10,365
Speaker 4:  Never, I mean they never wanna talk about specs that way.

702
00:42:10,365 --> 00:42:11,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They never wanna talk about the

703
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:14,845
Speaker 6:  Specs. But Alex, that's, that's true. And it isn't. Right, because the, the,

704
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:19,085
Speaker 6:  it is true that Apple is maybe losing the tops where it's also definitely

705
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:22,685
Speaker 6:  true that Apple is going to have the most

706
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:26,685
Speaker 6:  devices that this stuff can run on Yeah. By a million miles

707
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:30,125
Speaker 6:  on day one. And that is like, they don't, that's the Flex Apple is gonna

708
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:33,965
Speaker 6:  want here. Not we launched a new AI thing, but like we made all your things

709
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:38,005
Speaker 6:  AI things and if you're Apple and the world feels like you need to catch

710
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:39,805
Speaker 6:  up in ai, that's how you do it.

711
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:44,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I, I totally, totally agree. And I, and especially because as we, we

712
00:42:44,085 --> 00:42:48,045
Speaker 5:  know, we, we have no idea what TOPS actually do so so they

713
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:49,125
Speaker 5:  don't need to care about it.

714
00:42:50,115 --> 00:42:53,885
Speaker 4:  Well, so like what are Tops four a good question. Apple has an

715
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:57,125
Speaker 4:  opportunity to answer that question. Maybe not by saying Yeah,

716
00:42:57,225 --> 00:42:57,805
Speaker 5:  We don't care

717
00:42:57,915 --> 00:43:00,725
Speaker 4:  Tops. Yeah. But by saying like, here are a bunch of features in the operating

718
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:04,085
Speaker 4:  system. Apple very famously has so much

719
00:43:04,245 --> 00:43:08,125
Speaker 4:  headroom in terms of performance that it can just

720
00:43:08,305 --> 00:43:12,245
Speaker 4:  put out features. It can, it can waste cycles basically, again, to

721
00:43:12,245 --> 00:43:16,085
Speaker 4:  just sound like an old band when os an Apple first announced OS

722
00:43:16,105 --> 00:43:19,725
Speaker 4:  10 and it was like beautiful, it had extra animations. Everyone would

723
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,645
Speaker 4:  complain that they were just like running the processor all the time. And

724
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:26,245
Speaker 4:  Apple was like, yeah, it's pretty, that's what we do here.

725
00:43:27,035 --> 00:43:30,405
Speaker 4:  It's delightful. Yeah. That's what, that's what the processors are for. And

726
00:43:30,405 --> 00:43:33,085
Speaker 4:  now they have so much headroom they can do a bunch of stuff. So there, there's

727
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:36,925
Speaker 4:  just a bunch of stuff. There's AI

728
00:43:36,925 --> 00:43:40,725
Speaker 4:  generated emojis. Yep. Rumored to be announced. There's AI

729
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:44,285
Speaker 4:  powered voice transcription in voice memos and in notes, which

730
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:45,085
Speaker 4:  sounds great.

731
00:43:45,845 --> 00:43:45,965
Speaker 5:  I

732
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:48,725
Speaker 4:  Love it should put that in the operating system. Sorry, a bunch of India

733
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:50,125
Speaker 4:  apps that are offering that right now.

734
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:55,165
Speaker 4:  The idea that Siri will be able to just like go into your apps and do things.

735
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:59,205
Speaker 4:  An idea that we have talked about for a long time, programmatically with

736
00:43:59,495 --> 00:44:02,885
Speaker 4:  Bixby, programmatically with Siri, with shortcuts

737
00:44:04,785 --> 00:44:08,645
Speaker 4:  in implausible and ultimately fake ways with Rabbit in a

738
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:12,605
Speaker 4:  large action model. Like the idea that an assistant can just

739
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:16,605
Speaker 4:  use a computer for you, that is the dream. Apple can get

740
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:20,765
Speaker 4:  to somewhere farther than we are now with Sir on the phone.

741
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:22,605
Speaker 4:  That's a huge Yeah. Step

742
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:26,485
Speaker 5:  Forward if I can just go, 'cause I, I, we all have like, what,

743
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:30,605
Speaker 5:  four different music and podcasting and audio book apps on our phones.

744
00:44:31,025 --> 00:44:33,245
Speaker 5:  And so when you're like, yeah, I just wanna listen to my book, it's like,

745
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:36,245
Speaker 5:  okay, would you like to buy it from the Apple store? And you're like, no,

746
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:40,765
Speaker 5:  I have it in like Libby or LiRo FM or whatever. And to the idea to just be

747
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:44,685
Speaker 5:  like, Hey, play that. Go do it. Go do it. And it would just do it.

748
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:45,925
Speaker 5:  Oh my God, that would be incredible.

749
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:50,645
Speaker 4:  Will that actually happen Or will Apple still try to get you to buy a

750
00:44:50,645 --> 00:44:52,165
Speaker 4:  book from the, from the iBook store?

751
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:56,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think that's gonna be the real issue for or for,

752
00:44:56,225 --> 00:44:57,725
Speaker 5:  for that particular use case.

753
00:44:57,985 --> 00:45:01,125
Speaker 6:  But so I think the question is

754
00:45:01,795 --> 00:45:04,445
Speaker 6:  exclusively what you just said, NELI, which I think is really fascinating,

755
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:08,045
Speaker 6:  right? Because until now there have been a million problems, right? One of

756
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:11,485
Speaker 6:  which is the like underlying machine learning technology is not very good.

757
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:15,405
Speaker 6:  One of which is that Siri is not historically very good at speech

758
00:45:15,405 --> 00:45:19,245
Speaker 6:  recognition. One is that the processing stuff has not been as fast

759
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:22,445
Speaker 6:  as it needs to be to be useful for stuff. But the biggest one has just been

760
00:45:22,445 --> 00:45:26,005
Speaker 6:  that Apple won't let developers do stuff. And if

761
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:30,205
Speaker 6:  you're Apple, the question now is like, what are we going to

762
00:45:30,205 --> 00:45:33,805
Speaker 6:  expose to developers? Because the way it's been for a long time is developers

763
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:36,645
Speaker 6:  would've had to do all the work, right? So Apple just says like, here's what

764
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:40,485
Speaker 6:  Siri can do, plug it into your app however you'd like. But if this new AI

765
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:44,325
Speaker 6:  thing can work the way that it might, or at least that it's been reported

766
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:47,965
Speaker 6:  to work, all developers have to do is basically just like

767
00:45:48,105 --> 00:45:51,765
Speaker 6:  expose their app to Siri in a way that could become very powerful in the

768
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:54,525
Speaker 6:  way that it's like, I don't know, Google search is a good example of this,

769
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:58,125
Speaker 6:  right? Like if you just write a recipe on your website in a certain way or

770
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:00,685
Speaker 6:  you structure the page a certain way, like Google can understand it and index

771
00:46:00,685 --> 00:46:04,525
Speaker 6:  it and do stuff with it. And if Apple can say, Hey,

772
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:09,165
Speaker 6:  Spotify, Libby, whoever else, you want somebody to just be able to

773
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:13,125
Speaker 6:  listen to their podcasts in your app. Just turn these

774
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:16,285
Speaker 6:  three flags on that say, here's how you play a podcast in our app and we're

775
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:20,125
Speaker 6:  off and running. Like if everybody wants this to happen, it could happen.

776
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:22,205
Speaker 4:  But that's not the AI of it.

777
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:23,005
Speaker 6:  No, that's,

778
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:26,605
Speaker 4:  That's like, that exists sort of today. Like you can

779
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:30,365
Speaker 4:  kind of get there. My favorite example of this, I'm just going to

780
00:46:30,615 --> 00:46:34,525
Speaker 4:  admit to being a dad who buys chicken nuggets in the McDonald's app all

781
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,405
Speaker 4:  the time. It's like a real thing that happens. I'm counting

782
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:41,005
Speaker 4:  those points. We're gonna get six free nuggets one of these days.

783
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:45,405
Speaker 4:  And every time I make this order it's like, do you wanna make a series shortcut

784
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:49,165
Speaker 4:  for this order? And I have like a total moral crisis about

785
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:52,485
Speaker 4:  voice ordering chicken nuggets. Like,

786
00:46:53,425 --> 00:46:55,445
Speaker 4:  but it's like those flags already exist. No, but this

787
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,445
Speaker 6:  Is my point. Walk me through that process. Tell me, tell me every step you

788
00:46:58,445 --> 00:46:59,165
Speaker 6:  take to do that,

789
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:03,445
Speaker 4:  You literally hit a button in the app that's like, just say this as a, as

790
00:47:03,605 --> 00:47:05,485
Speaker 4:  a favorite. And then you can be like, Siri.

791
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:08,885
Speaker 6:  No, I mean to order Siri or to, oh wait, wait, you order

792
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:11,445
Speaker 6:  McDonald's and then it says, do you wanna order McDonald's with your voice?

793
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:12,525
Speaker 6:  And you can't bring yourself to be

794
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,845
Speaker 4:  That. If you make me open this app on this podcast, I would right now like

795
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:15,805
Speaker 4:  to.my

796
00:47:15,805 --> 00:47:18,685
Speaker 6:  God. I would like you to do that very much. No, because one thing I, I should

797
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:20,965
Speaker 6:  have said this at the beginning, is there are gonna be a lot of people listening

798
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:24,725
Speaker 6:  to this who are like, shortcuts solved this. And no it doesn't. No it doesn't.

799
00:47:25,205 --> 00:47:28,645
Speaker 6:  Shortcuts is a bad app that no one can figure out. And if you figured it

800
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,885
Speaker 6:  out, congratulations. And I'm proud of you. Shortcuts is not the solution

801
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:32,445
Speaker 6:  to this problem.

802
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:36,045
Speaker 5:  I would say shortcuts is the solution. If you're a programmer and you have

803
00:47:36,045 --> 00:47:37,645
Speaker 5:  a really strong grasp of programming.

804
00:47:37,645 --> 00:47:40,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If you wanna write code, you can solve a lot of your problems, including

805
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:41,445
Speaker 6:  in shortcuts.

806
00:47:41,885 --> 00:47:44,125
Speaker 5:  Absolutely true. Yeah. I, I don't wanna write code if you know

807
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:47,885
Speaker 6:  What a callback URL is. Congratulations. You can use shortcuts.

808
00:47:48,155 --> 00:47:50,445
Speaker 6:  Most people don't and that's fine.

809
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:54,685
Speaker 4:  I don't think you can set up Siri on the McDonald's app unless you order

810
00:47:54,965 --> 00:47:55,325
Speaker 4:  McDonald's.

811
00:47:58,865 --> 00:48:01,605
Speaker 4:  That's, but it is. That's how they get you. But, but it is true that you

812
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:05,485
Speaker 4:  can set up a Siri thing. It might use shortcuts in the background, right?

813
00:48:05,485 --> 00:48:09,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But like the hooks for have Siri do stuff in the app

814
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:12,965
Speaker 4:  programmatically, semantically, like you're talking about with Google, they

815
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:16,405
Speaker 4:  exist. The opportunity for Apple is to say,

816
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:20,365
Speaker 4:  we control this operating system top to bottom. We control the app store

817
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:23,805
Speaker 4:  top to bottom in, at least in this country and

818
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:27,005
Speaker 4:  we can now use your phone for you. Right? Which is more or less the promise

819
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:30,965
Speaker 4:  Samsung made with Bixby a million years ago. and more or less the promise,

820
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:35,165
Speaker 4:  Microsoft is starting to make with Windows. Yeah, right. We just sit over

821
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,885
Speaker 4:  the top of everything and we'll click around for you.

822
00:48:39,185 --> 00:48:43,085
Speaker 4:  And if Apple can get there, which I don't know if they can, but it's

823
00:48:43,405 --> 00:48:45,725
Speaker 4:  certainly the promise that's been reported by Grim and others, they will

824
00:48:45,725 --> 00:48:49,485
Speaker 4:  get there in their own apps that you'll just be able to talk to Siri and

825
00:48:49,485 --> 00:48:52,165
Speaker 4:  it will take action in Apple's own apps. And there's obviously privacy and

826
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:55,685
Speaker 4:  security concerns and all this stuff, but if they can get even a little bit

827
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:59,365
Speaker 4:  farther there on the phone with ai, so it's not this like very

828
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:03,365
Speaker 4:  manual set the flags of what you're allowed to do and here's how it

829
00:49:03,365 --> 00:49:07,285
Speaker 4:  works, but much more where the computer's gonna use the computer

830
00:49:07,305 --> 00:49:10,965
Speaker 4:  for you. That's a huge deal. Oh, I agree. I don't know how much processing

831
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:12,885
Speaker 4:  power you need for that. I don't know if Well

832
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:16,725
Speaker 5:  You're, you're also gonna run into to Apple's like desire to have you

833
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:19,965
Speaker 5:  use their stuff so that they get money and Right.

834
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:22,925
Speaker 4:  And then and once you're, once, once you're using Apple stuff and Apple's

835
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:26,845
Speaker 4:  ecosystem, whether or not it even is AI like starts to

836
00:49:26,845 --> 00:49:30,365
Speaker 4:  get fully obfuscated. 'cause you don't, you could just fake once you control

837
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:34,045
Speaker 4:  everything, you just like fake it more or less. Yeah. So there's a million

838
00:49:34,365 --> 00:49:37,685
Speaker 4:  questions in there and then there's obviously the big problem of

839
00:49:38,385 --> 00:49:41,365
Speaker 4:  how many tops do you need to pull that off? Can they run locally on the phone,

840
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:45,285
Speaker 4:  which is power constrained, network constrained, all this stuff. Heat, thermal

841
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:45,805
Speaker 4:  constrained.

842
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,965
Speaker 4:  Yikes. Yeah. And then do you want your phone watching everything you do like,

843
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:54,845
Speaker 4:  just like a series of escalating yikes problems. Yeah. I'm very curious

844
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:57,845
Speaker 4:  to see how Apple talks about this stuff. 'cause this sort of like

845
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:02,565
Speaker 4:  chat bot esque part Yeah. Where you're like, make a custom emoji for

846
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:06,005
Speaker 4:  me or like do a voice transcription. Like these familiar things

847
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,485
Speaker 4:  all make sense to do the part where they're like, we control everything and

848
00:50:09,485 --> 00:50:12,965
Speaker 4:  we can do things that no one else can do. Wild. I'm

849
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:17,085
Speaker 5:  Also gonna be curious if they can even like roll it out as fast

850
00:50:17,085 --> 00:50:20,965
Speaker 5:  as they want to. Right. Because I think technologically they can, but I'm

851
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:24,205
Speaker 5:  just thinking of what we've, what we've seen again and again and again is

852
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:26,645
Speaker 5:  that these companies are pushing these things out and not considering the

853
00:50:26,645 --> 00:50:29,645
Speaker 5:  edge cases. Because I was just sitting here being like, oh man, I'm totally

854
00:50:29,645 --> 00:50:33,205
Speaker 5:  gonna have it make an ugly Sonic the

855
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:36,885
Speaker 5:  hedgehog emoji that looks like Raccoon Girl.

856
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:40,965
Speaker 5:  Which is like, that is a whole thing that would

857
00:50:41,865 --> 00:50:45,805
Speaker 5:  see, I think any AI would struggle with that. Siri would struggle with

858
00:50:45,805 --> 00:50:45,885
Speaker 5:  that.

859
00:50:45,885 --> 00:50:48,445
Speaker 4:  There's a red team at Apple right now listening to this podcast being like,

860
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:49,645
Speaker 4:  did we test Right?

861
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,685
Speaker 10:  I hope you guys did.

862
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:53,805
Speaker 4:  Please hire Alex Cranz for

863
00:50:53,805 --> 00:50:55,285
Speaker 6:  All your Edge case Red team.

864
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:55,925
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

865
00:50:56,505 --> 00:50:56,925
Speaker 4:  That's

866
00:50:56,925 --> 00:50:58,365
Speaker 6:  A service we can provide on this show. You

867
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,125
Speaker 10:  Know, the, the,

868
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:02,525
Speaker 5:  The glue thing happened because they were like, how do I get the cheese to

869
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:03,125
Speaker 5:  stick to the pizza?

870
00:51:03,385 --> 00:51:04,925
Speaker 4:  Can I say the funniest thing about the glue thing?

871
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:06,645
Speaker 5:  What did you do

872
00:51:06,645 --> 00:51:09,925
Speaker 4:  It? I have not. Katie and I policy said Insider did it. She said it was fine

873
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:13,285
Speaker 4:  but you know, it's all good. You need to trust her that it was fine. Yeah.

874
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:18,645
Speaker 4:  So Google is manually deleting the bad results or Google

875
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:22,245
Speaker 4:  contractors and some other country are manually deleting the results as people

876
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:25,805
Speaker 4:  see them. But because so many people have now searched for

877
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:29,525
Speaker 4:  how to keep pizza, glue the cheese on pizza and then

878
00:51:30,195 --> 00:51:33,765
Speaker 4:  proactively clicked on fuck Smith's comment

879
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:37,925
Speaker 4:  on Reddit about the glue, the regular Google search algorithm

880
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,325
Speaker 4:  now is like, that's the answer. So Google

881
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:43,365
Speaker 5:  Ai, Google bombed Google. Yes.

882
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:47,365
Speaker 4:  Yes. Like the, the, if you at least I have a screenshot of it, but it, when

883
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:51,125
Speaker 4:  I searched for it the other day, no AI result, but

884
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:55,245
Speaker 4:  straight up it was like, here's a Reddit answer from 11 years ago by user

885
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:59,445
Speaker 4:  named fuck Smith who's like put the glue on pizza. You got it, didn't you?

886
00:51:59,445 --> 00:51:59,605
Speaker 4:  Yep.

887
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:02,125
Speaker 5:  It just immediately got it. That was the first thing

888
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:04,485
Speaker 4:  I got. It's like we, the regular Google algorithm is now broken.

889
00:52:07,195 --> 00:52:08,965
Speaker 10:  That brings me so much skill.

890
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:11,365
Speaker 4:  It's like whatcha gonna do with this man?

891
00:52:12,305 --> 00:52:13,405
Speaker 5:  You can put the glue on the pizza.

892
00:52:14,685 --> 00:52:17,205
Speaker 4:  And it's funny because with the Google leak that we were talking about last

893
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:20,445
Speaker 4:  week, we know it's because of the clicks. Yeah,

894
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:20,805
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

895
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,485
Speaker 4:  We, we know that So many people have like clicked on this answer as a goof.

896
00:52:25,485 --> 00:52:27,365
Speaker 4:  That regular Google got confused. Yeah.

897
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:28,885
Speaker 5:  Oh it's beautiful. It's

898
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:32,805
Speaker 4:  Good. Anyway, back to Apple. I can Apple's brand sustain

899
00:52:32,835 --> 00:52:36,645
Speaker 4:  that kind of error. It seems like they're not gonna do an open chat bot in

900
00:52:36,765 --> 00:52:40,645
Speaker 4:  this way. Yeah. But that brings us to whatever this OpenAI partnership

901
00:52:40,645 --> 00:52:44,565
Speaker 4:  is gonna be. I feel like I'm gonna disclose now that Fox Media has a

902
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:48,525
Speaker 4:  content deal with OpenAI. Yep. It's the first time we've done it in the

903
00:52:48,525 --> 00:52:50,325
Speaker 4:  course of the show. Like in the flow quick,

904
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:51,085
Speaker 5:  Somebody bring up Netflix.

905
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:52,685
Speaker 4:  I made a Netflix show.

906
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:54,965
Speaker 10:  Hi

907
00:52:55,395 --> 00:52:58,925
Speaker 4:  Hollywood Patel over here. It's called The Future of, it's a great show,

908
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,725
Speaker 4:  I encourage you to watch it. It was number one for five minutes and then

909
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:05,925
Speaker 4:  immediately other shows were number one.

910
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:08,205
Speaker 4:  Anyhow,

911
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:12,525
Speaker 4:  what are they gonna do with open ai? It feels like this is where Open AI

912
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:16,485
Speaker 4:  launches a search product or another

913
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:20,045
Speaker 4:  kind of integration. Who knows? David, do you have any inkling it's gonna

914
00:53:20,045 --> 00:53:20,245
Speaker 4:  be a

915
00:53:20,245 --> 00:53:20,645
Speaker 6:  Chatbot

916
00:53:21,035 --> 00:53:22,725
Speaker 4:  Chat? You think it's just gonna be a chatbot

917
00:53:22,785 --> 00:53:25,260
Speaker 6:  Bot? Well, no. So there's a bunch of things going on here. One is, is that

918
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,725
Speaker 6:  like no

919
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:26,885
Speaker 4:  Multimodal four oh

920
00:53:26,885 --> 00:53:29,445
Speaker 6:  Search. So there's gonna be some of that. Right? And to your point about

921
00:53:30,345 --> 00:53:34,285
Speaker 6:  how Apple does this on device Siri thing, there's this research paper

922
00:53:34,435 --> 00:53:38,125
Speaker 6:  that Apple put out I think earlier this year. It was either very late last

923
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:41,445
Speaker 6:  year or early this year about this thing called Ferret, which is basically

924
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:45,285
Speaker 6:  the like academic version of some of what we're talking about. It's

925
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:48,045
Speaker 6:  basically how to teach a language model, how to understand what's on a screen.

926
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:52,165
Speaker 6:  And one of the things they say in that paper is that

927
00:53:52,485 --> 00:53:56,085
Speaker 6:  GPT-4 is very good at sort of conceptually understanding

928
00:53:56,565 --> 00:53:59,285
Speaker 6:  a page, right? Like you, you show it something and it says this is an image

929
00:53:59,545 --> 00:54:03,365
Speaker 6:  of people on the beach, but if you zoom all the way in and

930
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,125
Speaker 6:  you're like, what's this little thing on the sand? GPT four's not good at

931
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:09,765
Speaker 6:  that. So what they built is this thing ferret that is very good in these

932
00:54:09,765 --> 00:54:13,605
Speaker 6:  small spaces. And what they say in the paper is, this combination is going

933
00:54:13,605 --> 00:54:16,365
Speaker 6:  to be very useful for us because we have this one simple system that can

934
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:20,205
Speaker 6:  just say, this is the Discover Weekly playlist on

935
00:54:20,285 --> 00:54:23,605
Speaker 6:  Spotify. And then you have this thing ferret that can drill down and be like,

936
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:27,205
Speaker 6:  okay, that's the song that they're looking for. And so I think that is

937
00:54:27,605 --> 00:54:31,405
Speaker 6:  probably more what you're gonna see that GPT-4 and this OpenAI

938
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:35,045
Speaker 6:  partnership is sort of the big broad strokes. Like

939
00:54:35,055 --> 00:54:38,485
Speaker 6:  let's do the first 80% of the AI job with a lot of the stuff.

940
00:54:39,065 --> 00:54:43,045
Speaker 6:  And then Apple's job underneath it is going to be to fix

941
00:54:43,145 --> 00:54:46,405
Speaker 6:  all of the things that GPT-4 either can't do or doesn't do very well. Which

942
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:50,085
Speaker 6:  actually in a lot of ways is really smart because it, you don't need to

943
00:54:50,445 --> 00:54:54,325
Speaker 6:  reinvent all the, you know, quote unquote easier stuff. Apple can just

944
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:58,125
Speaker 6:  like build features on top of it. It's like all the browsers building

945
00:54:58,145 --> 00:55:02,125
Speaker 6:  out of chromium now it's like we don't, we, we've more or less finished the

946
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:06,045
Speaker 6:  job of like how to do the very small simple basics. All the

947
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:09,445
Speaker 6:  interesting stuff is like the interface and the last mile stuff. And so I

948
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:12,805
Speaker 6:  suspect that's what we'll see a lot of all over

949
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:14,485
Speaker 6:  iOS. But where

950
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:18,285
Speaker 4:  Is it gonna happen? Because if you're relying on GPT-4 oh to do some

951
00:55:18,285 --> 00:55:21,845
Speaker 4:  aside, you have to go to the cloud, you probably have to go to Microsoft

952
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,765
Speaker 4:  servers, right? 'cause most of that runs in Azure.

953
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:26,765
Speaker 6:  Azure if you want the full model. Yeah. I also, I, I don't, I don't pretend

954
00:55:26,765 --> 00:55:29,405
Speaker 6:  to have a ton of knowledge, but I'm, I'm confident that OpenAI is working

955
00:55:29,505 --> 00:55:33,245
Speaker 6:  on smaller versions of, its stuff that works on device and

956
00:55:33,245 --> 00:55:36,845
Speaker 6:  locally and all that stuff. But I think if you look at something like

957
00:55:37,705 --> 00:55:40,765
Speaker 6:  what's a good example, voice transcription. We were just talking about why

958
00:55:40,785 --> 00:55:44,525
Speaker 6:  on earth if you're Apple, would you try to rebuild Whisper when Whisper

959
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:48,605
Speaker 6:  is really good And OpenAI made it already. Whispers may be a

960
00:55:48,605 --> 00:55:50,605
Speaker 6:  bad example 'cause it's actually open source and Apple could just take it.

961
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:54,285
Speaker 6:  But that's the sort of thing that's like OpenAI is sitting on a lot of very

962
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:57,885
Speaker 6:  good technology that is not being made into very good products.

963
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:01,565
Speaker 6:  And I think if I'm Apple, what I'm doing is looking at them and saying, I

964
00:56:01,565 --> 00:56:05,365
Speaker 6:  know how to make products. I'm just gonna take your sort of

965
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:09,285
Speaker 6:  base level infrastructure technology and build on top of it. I do think

966
00:56:09,345 --> 00:56:12,525
Speaker 6:  the what's going to happen on device versus what's gonna happen in the cloud

967
00:56:12,525 --> 00:56:16,165
Speaker 6:  thing is gonna be messy for Apple at first and

968
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:20,125
Speaker 6:  has been messy with Siri over the years, right? Like for a long time, one

969
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:23,045
Speaker 6:  of the things that sucked about Siri was that it went to the cloud for basically

970
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,445
Speaker 6:  everything. And progressively over time, Siri has gotten to do more stuff

971
00:56:26,445 --> 00:56:30,125
Speaker 6:  locally and has gotten better and faster as a result. And so I think we're

972
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:34,085
Speaker 6:  gonna see a lot of that sort of calibration of that sliding scale again from

973
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:34,485
Speaker 6:  Apple here.

974
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:37,565
Speaker 4:  But if they get to the point where they're sending what's happening on your

975
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:40,125
Speaker 4:  device to a cloud server,

976
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:44,965
Speaker 4:  especially one that Apple doesn't own, that's a, that is Apple

977
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:47,005
Speaker 4:  walking away from someone's privacy promises. They

978
00:56:47,005 --> 00:56:48,965
Speaker 6:  Made a Google deal, dude. Like this is what happens.

979
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:49,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I was like,

980
00:56:50,465 --> 00:56:53,125
Speaker 4:  But I'm, if they do the, where you're like, play spot Discover weekly in

981
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:56,925
Speaker 4:  GPT-4 and an Azure server is looking at your screen and then locally

982
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:58,485
Speaker 4:  it's something else. Like no. Oh,

983
00:56:58,605 --> 00:56:58,725
Speaker 5:  I

984
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:02,365
Speaker 4:  Like, I there's a level that there's a line that I don't think Apple will

985
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:02,565
Speaker 4:  cross.

986
00:57:02,805 --> 00:57:06,725
Speaker 5:  I I think, I think we, we don't know the term, the full terms of the

987
00:57:06,725 --> 00:57:10,565
Speaker 5:  open AI partnership, right? And Apple would be very, very, very, very,

988
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:14,765
Speaker 5:  very stupid to throw away that, that like privacy marketing

989
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:17,925
Speaker 5:  that they have. So I could totally see them be like, yeah, we're gonna, we

990
00:57:17,925 --> 00:57:21,805
Speaker 5:  have open ai but we're gonna use it on our servers and it'll go through our

991
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:25,245
Speaker 5:  stuff and it's all gonna be through your iCloud and, and all of that stuff.

992
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:28,405
Speaker 6:  I think that's probably what it's, I think, I think this is going to be less

993
00:57:28,435 --> 00:57:32,365
Speaker 6:  like we wanna run this stuff on the back of open AI's

994
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:35,805
Speaker 6:  server infrastructure, which is literally, as you said, Azure and more like,

995
00:57:36,175 --> 00:57:39,845
Speaker 6:  we're going to take some of their technology and we're gonna run it on our

996
00:57:39,845 --> 00:57:42,805
Speaker 6:  servers and it's just gonna be like a white label licensing deal. And

997
00:57:42,805 --> 00:57:46,365
Speaker 5:  We've, we've heard rumors about Apple having like building their own

998
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:47,525
Speaker 5:  processors and stuff.

999
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:49,365
Speaker 4:  No, they're, they're putting M two ultras. Yeah,

1000
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,725
Speaker 5:  That's it. That's it In Iraq. Yeah. And that's what it's for.

1001
00:57:51,865 --> 00:57:53,245
Speaker 4:  How many tops on M two Ultra?

1002
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:53,885
Speaker 6:  Some,

1003
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:59,005
Speaker 4:  Some, some to very, I mean, look, if, if there's, if there's one company

1004
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:02,605
Speaker 4:  like you said David, that can say like, this is what all the headroom on

1005
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:03,205
Speaker 4:  the phone is for

1006
00:58:03,465 --> 00:58:05,325
Speaker 5:  31.6 tops.

1007
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:06,685
Speaker 6:  That's pretty good.

1008
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:08,845
Speaker 4:  That's an amount of tops.

1009
00:58:09,705 --> 00:58:12,685
Speaker 5:  That's, that is more than a raspberry pie. If

1010
00:58:12,685 --> 00:58:14,485
Speaker 6:  You two and a half raspberry pies right there.

1011
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:20,165
Speaker 4:  That's brutal. If you can tell us what incremental

1012
00:58:20,275 --> 00:58:23,845
Speaker 4:  tops are for, please leave us a note. But you can't be an AI

1013
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,685
Speaker 4:  researcher. Like if you are building a consumer application where you're

1014
00:58:27,685 --> 00:58:31,445
Speaker 4:  like, oh man, when phones have at least 27

1015
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:34,765
Speaker 4:  tops, like the world will like you let us know.

1016
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,365
Speaker 4:  I'm dying to know the answer to question

1017
00:58:37,505 --> 00:58:41,125
Speaker 5:  Is writing you as we speak to be like, we can put, we can map

1018
00:58:41,655 --> 00:58:44,485
Speaker 5:  weird stuff to your face so well with more tops.

1019
00:58:44,505 --> 00:58:47,325
Speaker 4:  But if Evan Spiegel is like up at night because the average phone has 20

1020
00:58:47,355 --> 00:58:50,845
Speaker 4:  tops and he needs 27 like you, that's what I'm looking for. Evan

1021
00:58:51,565 --> 00:58:51,685
Speaker 4:  I.

1022
00:58:51,765 --> 00:58:55,725
Speaker 5:  Love it. This is such a good conversation for the beginning of Pride I. love

1023
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:56,205
Speaker 5:  it so much.

1024
00:58:56,985 --> 00:58:57,885
Speaker 4:  My god. Alex,

1025
00:58:59,365 --> 00:58:59,925
Speaker 5:  I just had to

1026
00:58:59,925 --> 00:59:02,325
Speaker 4:  Say what's randomly horny or Alex? Cranz Renee.

1027
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:04,405
Speaker 4:  Only

1028
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:07,605
Speaker 5:  A top six. We'll find out that that's gonna be a ba a head to head on a later

1029
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:08,445
Speaker 5:  VERGE cast.

1030
00:59:08,675 --> 00:59:12,045
Speaker 4:  Alright, what do we think is like the big thing that we're looking for from

1031
00:59:12,085 --> 00:59:15,165
Speaker 4:  WAC? Let's, let's, let's wrap it up this way. What, what's yours

1032
00:59:16,355 --> 00:59:18,005
Speaker 4:  like wishlist style? Ooh,

1033
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:23,565
Speaker 5:  I don't even know because I like, as, as, as David well

1034
00:59:23,565 --> 00:59:26,965
Speaker 5:  knows, I started using Arc. Oh my God. And so now that's all I care about

1035
00:59:26,965 --> 00:59:30,885
Speaker 5:  on my Mac. So like, I'm like, yeah, I just want

1036
00:59:30,885 --> 00:59:34,685
Speaker 5:  it to like look nice. I want better control over my, the

1037
00:59:34,685 --> 00:59:37,565
Speaker 5:  appearance of my device. I would love if the AI would just, I'd be able to

1038
00:59:37,565 --> 00:59:40,845
Speaker 5:  be like, I want it to be like cool cyberpunk green. And it would just be

1039
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:41,525
Speaker 5:  like, got you.

1040
00:59:43,235 --> 00:59:44,445
Speaker 5:  Okay. That's my wishlist.

1041
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:46,605
Speaker 4:  Did a cyberpunk green.

1042
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:50,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I want, I want, I want Mac OS and Siri to make my

1043
00:59:50,845 --> 00:59:52,325
Speaker 5:  computer look as ugly as possible.

1044
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:56,645
Speaker 4:  AI powered theming is an incredible, I'm not, I I don't think

1045
00:59:56,645 --> 00:59:56,965
Speaker 4:  it's Apple.

1046
00:59:57,395 --> 00:59:59,845
Speaker 5:  Give it to you. That was a Samsung. Yeah. Saturday day. There

1047
00:59:59,845 --> 01:00:03,765
Speaker 6:  Has been some reporting that Apple is going to like, really open up the

1048
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:06,885
Speaker 6:  possibilities for what you can do with your home screen. Like they're going

1049
01:00:06,885 --> 01:00:10,805
Speaker 6:  to let you put app icons wherever you want, which like, oh my God, what

1050
01:00:10,805 --> 01:00:13,725
Speaker 6:  a, how did no one think of this before? It's unbelievable. Incredible.

1051
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:18,685
Speaker 6:  But like, maybe we're not that far away from you just being

1052
01:00:18,685 --> 01:00:22,045
Speaker 6:  able to tell Siri like, just uug up my phone. It's no big deal and it'll

1053
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:22,925
Speaker 6:  just happen. Yes, that'd

1054
01:00:22,925 --> 01:00:24,405
Speaker 5:  Be amazing. That's what I want. That's

1055
01:00:24,405 --> 01:00:24,645
Speaker 6:  The dream.

1056
01:00:25,345 --> 01:00:26,725
Speaker 4:  All right. That's Alex's David.

1057
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:32,085
Speaker 6:  All of my stuff is Spotlight, which I would very much

1058
01:00:32,475 --> 01:00:36,085
Speaker 6:  like to, that's where I want all the AI stuff to go. I think

1059
01:00:36,385 --> 01:00:39,605
Speaker 6:  the like little AI features, voice transcription, all that stuff is gonna

1060
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:43,405
Speaker 6:  be very cool for me. It's like if it can get very good at me

1061
01:00:43,405 --> 01:00:47,285
Speaker 6:  just being like, what was that picture of the sign

1062
01:00:47,285 --> 01:00:50,885
Speaker 6:  that I took a few days ago? And it'll just be like this one or like the,

1063
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:54,645
Speaker 6:  the thing in Google Photos where you can just ask it about things in your

1064
01:00:54,645 --> 01:00:58,445
Speaker 6:  photos. Like, I want that locally on my phone. And also with access

1065
01:00:58,505 --> 01:01:02,365
Speaker 6:  to all of my stuff, right? Like Spotlight knows everything. It sees the

1066
01:01:02,485 --> 01:01:05,165
Speaker 6:  internet, it has all the stuff on your device. Oh man, it, there's been some

1067
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:07,725
Speaker 6:  reporting I think from Mark Garman at Bloomberg that it's gonna be able to

1068
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:10,765
Speaker 6:  do more stuff inside of files and with documents. And I just wanna be like,

1069
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:15,405
Speaker 6:  I wanna just live my life inside of that spotlight search and just have it

1070
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:18,885
Speaker 6:  understand everything on my phone all the time. Like that's, that

1071
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:19,445
Speaker 5:  Would be cool too.

1072
01:01:19,445 --> 01:01:21,365
Speaker 6:  That's DAI job here as far as I

1073
01:01:21,465 --> 01:01:22,245
Speaker 4:  You want rewind

1074
01:01:22,675 --> 01:01:25,805
Speaker 6:  Basically, but, and it's just sitting here. This no reason. You're one, one

1075
01:01:25,805 --> 01:01:26,845
Speaker 4:  Of the people who's like, just do all

1076
01:01:26,905 --> 01:01:30,445
Speaker 6:  He already does Neli. It's already like, do you know what? Already knows

1077
01:01:30,445 --> 01:01:33,245
Speaker 6:  everything that's happening on my phone is my phone. Like,

1078
01:01:34,235 --> 01:01:38,205
Speaker 6:  just do it for me. And again, like I think the, the interesting

1079
01:01:38,205 --> 01:01:42,125
Speaker 6:  thing about the recall thing is that it's like the

1080
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:45,685
Speaker 6:  worry is that somebody can get all the stuff on your device, right?

1081
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:49,365
Speaker 6:  Malware exists on Windows that just lets somebody look at that plain text

1082
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,885
Speaker 6:  database that is sitting on your device way less of a threat on the iPhone.

1083
01:01:53,305 --> 01:01:57,285
Speaker 6:  And so for me, like all my stuff is already here and if

1084
01:01:57,285 --> 01:02:01,085
Speaker 6:  you get my phone and my passcode, I'm screwed already. So I'm like,

1085
01:02:01,095 --> 01:02:04,605
Speaker 6:  let's at least make use of the fact that this device essentially contains

1086
01:02:04,605 --> 01:02:08,485
Speaker 6:  every piece of my life in existence and make it useful to me because I can't

1087
01:02:08,485 --> 01:02:09,245
Speaker 6:  help what it already is.

1088
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:13,685
Speaker 5:  I love this because I have like a whole reservoir of horrible photos

1089
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:17,405
Speaker 5:  and gifs and it would be real God, God, it would rule to just be like, Hey

1090
01:02:17,475 --> 01:02:17,765
Speaker 5:  Siri

1091
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,965
Speaker 4:  Again, if Apple's red team is available, Alex

1092
01:02:21,145 --> 01:02:21,365
Speaker 5:  Got

1093
01:02:21,365 --> 01:02:22,805
Speaker 4:  You to Alex. Cranz is also also

1094
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:25,085
Speaker 6:  Available. If I could just be like, like that. If I could just be like, where's

1095
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:27,685
Speaker 6:  the Wilmer Valda Ramma gift where he does the I love you with his hands and

1096
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:30,285
Speaker 6:  it just shows it to me like that's what I want. That's the dream. Yes.

1097
01:02:30,795 --> 01:02:34,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's that. I I love this dream. Okay. I'm on board. I, I switched

1098
01:02:34,725 --> 01:02:35,445
Speaker 5:  mine to Davids,

1099
01:02:36,025 --> 01:02:39,325
Speaker 6:  But also I wanna make my phone ugly with one command. Yes. I I'm with Alex

1100
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:41,005
Speaker 6:  too. Neli, what's your like Yeah,

1101
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:46,165
Speaker 4:  I feel like the, the Hey don't share wilder wil

1102
01:02:46,645 --> 01:02:50,485
Speaker 4:  derra gifts anymore. Warning is something that you need from an AI

1103
01:02:50,485 --> 01:02:54,045
Speaker 4:  system in this context. Like, hey, you're a little outta date. There's been

1104
01:02:54,045 --> 01:02:54,645
Speaker 4:  some news

1105
01:02:57,195 --> 01:03:01,165
Speaker 4:  just helping you out there bud. Okay. Mine is very small.

1106
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:04,725
Speaker 4:  It's not really a wishlist of a feature. Okay. I am

1107
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:09,405
Speaker 4:  dying to see how Apple addresses adding RCS to messages. Oh yeah.

1108
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:13,445
Speaker 4:  Is it an announcement? Is it a Bento box slide? Is it the world's smallest

1109
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:17,485
Speaker 4:  type? Is it just cred, FII being like, we've added the letters

1110
01:03:17,765 --> 01:03:21,645
Speaker 4:  and just like moving on. Like it could go a million different

1111
01:03:21,645 --> 01:03:21,845
Speaker 4:  ways.

1112
01:03:21,995 --> 01:03:23,045
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be bento, it

1113
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:26,845
Speaker 4:  Could be a full thing. Like we've now added support for the standard

1114
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,885
Speaker 4:  that everyone's been making for Right?

1115
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:32,765
Speaker 5:  I figured it out. They're gonna talk about the emoji emojis are that they

1116
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:35,925
Speaker 5:  can make with AI and then be like, and you can even send them to your friend

1117
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:39,125
Speaker 5:  on Android because we've introduced R Cs. Right?

1118
01:03:39,145 --> 01:03:43,045
Speaker 4:  So a a any number of ways Will the, will they show green bubbles on that

1119
01:03:43,095 --> 01:03:43,445
Speaker 4:  stage?

1120
01:03:44,835 --> 01:03:45,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1121
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:46,965
Speaker 4:  Anything could happen.

1122
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:48,285
Speaker 5:  Oh, it's

1123
01:03:48,285 --> 01:03:51,525
Speaker 4:  Gonna rule. And I'm just like, that's the thing that I'm, or or they could

1124
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:51,845
Speaker 4:  do nothing.

1125
01:03:52,565 --> 01:03:56,405
Speaker 6:  I love this Alex, because like, do you remember a million years ago

1126
01:03:56,595 --> 01:04:00,245
Speaker 6:  when Paul Pierce sent that tweet where he tried to send an emoji but he actually

1127
01:04:00,245 --> 01:04:04,085
Speaker 6:  sent a picture like a jpeg of the rocketship emoji. That's what

1128
01:04:04,085 --> 01:04:06,805
Speaker 6:  it's gonna look like when you make a custom emoji on an iPhone and send it

1129
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:10,045
Speaker 6:  to an Android person. And that is how Apple gets to support

1130
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:13,925
Speaker 6:  RCS and still kind of knife all the Android users all at the same time.

1131
01:04:13,955 --> 01:04:14,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

1132
01:04:14,245 --> 01:04:18,085
Speaker 4:  That's good. These new features are for, for message users. Messages users.

1133
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:20,685
Speaker 4:  And for Android users you get

1134
01:04:20,685 --> 01:04:20,965
Speaker 6:  Jpeg

1135
01:04:20,985 --> 01:04:21,805
Speaker 5:  You get a jpeg

1136
01:04:23,925 --> 01:04:24,445
Speaker 6:  I love it.

1137
01:04:25,315 --> 01:04:29,285
Speaker 4:  Like I've just, anything can happen like literally

1138
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,525
Speaker 4:  anything from that like open cutting warfare

1139
01:04:33,505 --> 01:04:37,205
Speaker 4:  all the way down to, we've put three letters in like the tiniest box

1140
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:40,005
Speaker 4:  of the other features in iOS. You know,

1141
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:43,885
Speaker 6:  They might not even call it RCS like Right? Yeah. Just

1142
01:04:43,885 --> 01:04:44,845
Speaker 4:  Like rich messaging.

1143
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:48,445
Speaker 6:  What did they call it on the Apple Home app? Like new architecture.

1144
01:04:48,575 --> 01:04:50,405
Speaker 6:  Maybe they'll just call it new architecture

1145
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:53,565
Speaker 5:  Rich complex mess messaging. Yeah.

1146
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:56,965
Speaker 4:  So whatever, they'll just, they'll just literally anything is possible.

1147
01:04:57,395 --> 01:05:00,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But like, I cannot wait 'cause they've announced they're gonna do it.

1148
01:05:00,915 --> 01:05:04,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And this is when they roll out the new operating systems. This is when

1149
01:05:04,165 --> 01:05:04,725
Speaker 4:  they might do it.

1150
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:06,725
Speaker 5:  They just don't say anything.

1151
01:05:07,105 --> 01:05:08,125
Speaker 4:  I'm on pins and needles.

1152
01:05:08,525 --> 01:05:11,685
Speaker 6:  It is really interesting, by the way, how little we've heard about

1153
01:05:12,465 --> 01:05:16,125
Speaker 6:  non-AI stuff coming this year. Like Yeah, the

1154
01:05:16,265 --> 01:05:20,085
Speaker 6:  non-AI reporting so far is basically like new settings, menu

1155
01:05:20,665 --> 01:05:24,525
Speaker 6:  and some more native apps for the Vision Pro and all that stuff is well

1156
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:27,525
Speaker 6:  and good, but there is surprisingly little,

1157
01:05:28,545 --> 01:05:32,045
Speaker 6:  at least from what we've heard so far, that is not going to be about ai.

1158
01:05:32,105 --> 01:05:36,005
Speaker 6:  And I think both for just how the presentation goes, but also what these

1159
01:05:36,005 --> 01:05:39,365
Speaker 6:  things are, it's gonna be really interesting to see if basically whatever,

1160
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:42,965
Speaker 6:  12 months ago Craig Federighi was like, we only do AI

1161
01:05:43,275 --> 01:05:47,195
Speaker 6:  from now on. Or not like, it's just, it's,

1162
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:50,355
Speaker 6:  I, that's the thing I'm gonna be watching the most for is like how much non-AI

1163
01:05:50,355 --> 01:05:53,835
Speaker 6:  stuff is there, which I think is very telling for how much Apple is gonna

1164
01:05:53,835 --> 01:05:55,715
Speaker 6:  feel like it has to do with ai.

1165
01:05:56,025 --> 01:05:59,475
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm telling you it's gonna be RCS. All right, we gotta wrap this up.

1166
01:05:59,475 --> 01:06:00,875
Speaker 4:  We're gonna be at wwe C

1167
01:06:01,985 --> 01:06:02,675
Speaker 5:  He's so sad.

1168
01:06:02,985 --> 01:06:04,475
Speaker 11:  What? I was gonna get in there and

1169
01:06:04,475 --> 01:06:07,835
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. Wait. Liam's got one. Okay. All right. Liam, we we, bonus round.

1170
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:08,355
Speaker 4:  Okay.

1171
01:06:08,355 --> 01:06:11,715
Speaker 11:  This one has technically been announced already, but the thing I'm most

1172
01:06:11,715 --> 01:06:15,075
Speaker 11:  excited to try next week is the motion sickness feature.

1173
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:15,715
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah.

1174
01:06:16,495 --> 01:06:19,795
Speaker 11:  I'm one of those people that like, when I'm in an Uber, I can't read my

1175
01:06:19,795 --> 01:06:22,675
Speaker 11:  phone for more than a few seconds 'cause I get horrible motion sickness.

1176
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:26,635
Speaker 11:  Me too. So I really wanna try this if it's in beta and hopefully it works.

1177
01:06:26,825 --> 01:06:27,115
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

1178
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:31,795
Speaker 4:  All right, we're gonna get Liam in a car just zooming around. I'll,

1179
01:06:31,795 --> 01:06:32,115
Speaker 5:  I'll drive.

1180
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:32,915
Speaker 4:  This

1181
01:06:32,915 --> 01:06:35,475
Speaker 6:  Is the first that we should do. Liam and I are gonna get in the back. We're

1182
01:06:35,475 --> 01:06:38,675
Speaker 6:  gonna both look at our phones and we're gonna see who Pukes first. And that's,

1183
01:06:38,815 --> 01:06:39,235
Speaker 6:  that's

1184
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:39,355
Speaker 4:  The

1185
01:06:39,555 --> 01:06:41,875
Speaker 5:  Vergecast. I'm just gonna be doing figure eights in a parking

1186
01:06:41,895 --> 01:06:44,235
Speaker 4:  Lot. That's also sponsorable. You considering

1187
01:06:45,575 --> 01:06:45,795
Speaker 6:  Bal

1188
01:06:46,455 --> 01:06:47,355
Speaker 4:  Who boots first.

1189
01:06:49,475 --> 01:06:52,515
Speaker 4:  All right. That's it. We're gonna be there next week. Sick house

1190
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:55,875
Speaker 4:  again. I, I've been told there will be tacos. I'm not a hundred percent sure

1191
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:57,515
Speaker 4:  how we're gonna work the tacos in the show. A lot of

1192
01:06:57,515 --> 01:06:58,195
Speaker 5:  Horses are gonna be

1193
01:10:22,425 --> 01:10:22,645
Speaker 5:  so

1194
01:10:24,335 --> 01:10:28,045
Speaker 4:  Right. But you're still just like, I'm gonna like HBO or Max, I'm sorry,

1195
01:10:28,155 --> 01:10:31,405
Speaker 4:  yeah. Is now just full of a bunch of weird discovery reality shows. Like

1196
01:10:31,405 --> 01:10:35,205
Speaker 4:  that's, that's the value for dollar there. Yeah. Is like, you wanna watch

1197
01:10:35,295 --> 01:10:39,125
Speaker 4:  House Hunters here, here it is. And that stuff is still super

1198
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,965
Speaker 4:  available on a cable package. Yep.

1199
01:10:41,505 --> 01:10:44,485
Speaker 5:  And, and the cable package is probably gonna be a nicer

1200
01:10:45,135 --> 01:10:48,965
Speaker 5:  experience where it'll be easier to find the episode you wanna watch and

1201
01:10:48,965 --> 01:10:52,365
Speaker 5:  get started because the, the Max UI is still

1202
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:53,645
Speaker 5:  hot, hot garbage.

1203
01:10:54,305 --> 01:10:58,285
Speaker 4:  So my max is still paid for because as you know, at

1204
01:10:58,605 --> 01:11:01,245
Speaker 4:  t it's a child at t bought. Because that's not why that would be incredible.

1205
01:11:01,545 --> 01:11:04,525
Speaker 4:  If everyone named Max got free Max, that would actually be great. Feels great.

1206
01:11:04,795 --> 01:11:08,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It would justify the bad name. No, as you are aware,

1207
01:11:08,705 --> 01:11:10,165
Speaker 4:  at t bought Warner Brothers.

1208
01:11:10,525 --> 01:11:11,325
Speaker 5:  I I did know that. Yes.

1209
01:11:11,885 --> 01:11:15,805
Speaker 4:  A deal which led only to the release of the four three Snyder cut.

1210
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:21,045
Speaker 4:  Sorry. But also a bunch of grandfathered plans. Yeah. And I have

1211
01:11:21,105 --> 01:11:24,685
Speaker 4:  one that is the same money as a new at t plan. It just

1212
01:11:24,805 --> 01:11:25,365
Speaker 4:  includes

1213
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:26,645
Speaker 5:  Max,

1214
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:27,845
Speaker 4:  But in 10 80 p

1215
01:11:28,545 --> 01:11:29,245
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's brutal.

1216
01:11:29,505 --> 01:11:33,205
Speaker 4:  And so I'm just like stuck with free 10 80 P max. Nope. Until

1217
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:36,485
Speaker 4:  someone will notice this at at and t, which they never will.

1218
01:11:37,115 --> 01:11:39,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They just want, they're just not gonna notice. Then

1219
01:11:39,325 --> 01:11:40,685
Speaker 5:  They're like, you enjoy 10 80.

1220
01:11:41,195 --> 01:11:44,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, they're gonna be like a grandfather at at and t plan. You're not

1221
01:11:44,405 --> 01:11:48,125
Speaker 4:  churning You may have it forever. Yeah. Until you get a, until they get to

1222
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,805
Speaker 4:  six G, that's when they churn you.

1223
01:11:50,235 --> 01:11:51,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you're done

1224
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:53,925
Speaker 4:  Then. But I'm stuck with this horrible plan. I'm sorry, David. Are you, are

1225
01:11:53,925 --> 01:11:54,965
Speaker 4:  you paying 21 bucks a month

1226
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:58,445
Speaker 6:  For No, I'm switching to ads over and over again. And it's just really,

1227
01:11:58,675 --> 01:11:59,485
Speaker 6:  it's just fine.

1228
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:04,925
Speaker 6:  And the thing that I have realized increasingly is

1229
01:12:04,925 --> 01:12:08,845
Speaker 6:  that the idea that people are churning is less real than people

1230
01:12:08,845 --> 01:12:12,525
Speaker 6:  think. And I think these services are stickier than people give them credit

1231
01:12:12,525 --> 01:12:16,405
Speaker 6:  for. Like I was, I was reading something the other day about how one of

1232
01:12:16,405 --> 01:12:19,925
Speaker 6:  the big reasons these companies get sports is that people sign up to watch

1233
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:23,165
Speaker 6:  one game and then like an overwhelmingly large percentage of those people

1234
01:12:23,195 --> 01:12:26,885
Speaker 6:  keep the service. Like it's actually the, this idea that people are coming,

1235
01:12:27,325 --> 01:12:29,725
Speaker 6:  watching the thing and then canceling until that thing comes back a year

1236
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:33,005
Speaker 6:  later is largely not the behavior. And

1237
01:12:33,505 --> 01:12:37,405
Speaker 6:  as a result, once you're in, you're kind of

1238
01:12:37,465 --> 01:12:41,165
Speaker 6:  in, and I think these companies have figured out that a dollar at a time

1239
01:12:41,305 --> 01:12:45,165
Speaker 6:  is not terrifying. Like, I think if if Max suddenly went up $10

1240
01:12:45,245 --> 01:12:49,045
Speaker 6:  a month, people would freak out and leave. Right? Like I think I've been

1241
01:12:49,245 --> 01:12:52,485
Speaker 6:  watching Evernote for this. I dunno why this just came into my head, but

1242
01:12:52,485 --> 01:12:54,365
Speaker 6:  I've been watching Evernote over the last couple years. They basically just

1243
01:12:54,365 --> 01:12:57,325
Speaker 6:  doubled their subscription price. And we're very honestly like, this is the

1244
01:12:57,325 --> 01:13:00,085
Speaker 6:  only way. This is a sustainable business. Here we go. And people freaked

1245
01:13:00,105 --> 01:13:04,075
Speaker 6:  out. That's how you churn people. But a

1246
01:13:04,195 --> 01:13:08,075
Speaker 6:  dollar a month at a time, just there doesn't seem to be a lot

1247
01:13:08,075 --> 01:13:11,955
Speaker 6:  of evidence that that costs them anything and it gets them more money.

1248
01:13:12,215 --> 01:13:16,195
Speaker 6:  And also what they want is either for you to pay $50 a

1249
01:13:16,195 --> 01:13:20,155
Speaker 6:  month or get ads and they will, they will keep raising the price

1250
01:13:20,155 --> 01:13:22,955
Speaker 6:  until those are the only two options left. I really believe that.

1251
01:13:23,675 --> 01:13:26,755
Speaker 5:  I I, I totally agree with you. I mean, it's, it's just the frog and the,

1252
01:13:26,755 --> 01:13:28,715
Speaker 5:  the boiling pot, right? Like it's the water that

1253
01:13:28,715 --> 01:13:30,995
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm stuck with an at t plan. Turning up.

1254
01:13:30,995 --> 01:13:33,475
Speaker 5:  You're you're stuck with 10 p turning forever.

1255
01:13:35,095 --> 01:13:35,435
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry.

1256
01:13:36,335 --> 01:13:39,715
Speaker 4:  Ah, all right. David, what's yours? Mine

1257
01:13:40,055 --> 01:13:43,875
Speaker 6:  Is maybe the wonkiest thing I've picked on

1258
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:47,955
Speaker 6:  The Vergecast in a while. Google bought this company called Cameo

1259
01:13:48,105 --> 01:13:51,755
Speaker 6:  with a y not the cameo, where you can get famous people to like tell you

1260
01:13:51,755 --> 01:13:55,155
Speaker 6:  you're terrific. It's a, it's a company that does Windows app

1261
01:13:55,155 --> 01:13:58,555
Speaker 6:  virtualization on CMOs. And I

1262
01:13:58,825 --> 01:14:02,195
Speaker 6:  thought this was very funny because this happened this week after I had a

1263
01:14:02,195 --> 01:14:05,875
Speaker 6:  very like related cameo experience. My wife is in grad school

1264
01:14:06,215 --> 01:14:09,635
Speaker 6:  and she's taking like a statistics class right now. And

1265
01:14:10,215 --> 01:14:13,885
Speaker 6:  she had to download this unbelievably like

1266
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:18,165
Speaker 6:  esoteric old app called our Studio. I

1267
01:14:18,165 --> 01:14:21,045
Speaker 6:  think that looks like it has not been updated since 1994.

1268
01:14:22,475 --> 01:14:26,205
Speaker 6:  Runs on Windows, Linux and Mac and not Chrome os. And she has a

1269
01:14:26,205 --> 01:14:30,125
Speaker 6:  Chromebook for her like personal use. And so

1270
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:33,845
Speaker 6:  she spent, I would say the better part of a day trying to install

1271
01:14:34,165 --> 01:14:37,885
Speaker 6:  Linux on her Chromebook in order to do this. And was

1272
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:40,405
Speaker 6:  she got like most of the way down, I was actually very impressed with how

1273
01:14:40,465 --> 01:14:44,085
Speaker 6:  far down the, like running a Linux distro on a Chromebook she got

1274
01:14:44,345 --> 01:14:46,805
Speaker 6:  and then eventually just gave up and was like, it's not worth it. Do a Windows

1275
01:14:47,085 --> 01:14:50,285
Speaker 6:  computer I can use. But the thing that we found was like, oh, the best answer

1276
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:53,885
Speaker 6:  to this is this app called Cameo, which just lets you run Windows apps on

1277
01:14:53,885 --> 01:14:57,445
Speaker 6:  your Chromebook, but it's prohibitively expensive and like explicitly not

1278
01:14:57,725 --> 01:15:01,285
Speaker 6:  designed for just like regular people. But now as part of Google, I think

1279
01:15:01,285 --> 01:15:04,645
Speaker 6:  this is super interesting. It gives Google like a new inroad into businesses

1280
01:15:04,645 --> 01:15:07,965
Speaker 6:  with Chromebooks where it has traditionally had trouble. It gives

1281
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:12,085
Speaker 6:  Chromebooks a lot more to do because if this works well, you could

1282
01:15:12,085 --> 01:15:15,965
Speaker 6:  start to just do more window stuff inside of Chromebooks. There's a lot left

1283
01:15:15,965 --> 01:15:19,325
Speaker 6:  to shake out here. This acquisition like just happened. But I actually think

1284
01:15:19,325 --> 01:15:22,125
Speaker 6:  it's super interesting and as like the one person on earth who still really,

1285
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:25,405
Speaker 6:  really, really, really wants Chromebooks to be cool and succeed. This makes

1286
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:26,285
Speaker 6:  me happy. Yeah.

1287
01:15:26,945 --> 01:15:29,365
Speaker 4:  The the, the best thing I've ever bought for my mom is a Chromebook.

1288
01:15:29,665 --> 01:15:30,085
Speaker 5:  Really?

1289
01:15:30,315 --> 01:15:33,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Because a regular computer or regular macro or Windows PC is like

1290
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:36,965
Speaker 4:  55 different operating system metaphors all at once.

1291
01:15:38,065 --> 01:15:42,045
Speaker 4:  You're like, this is called Launchpad. Why? And you get a Chromebook, you're

1292
01:15:42,045 --> 01:15:45,005
Speaker 4:  like, use this browser. And they just use it and it's like, fine.

1293
01:15:45,035 --> 01:15:46,445
Speaker 5:  Does your mom know what, when you say

1294
01:15:46,685 --> 01:15:48,085
Speaker 4:  I wrote whole article about it ages ago,

1295
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,845
Speaker 5:  Does she know like what the box is to where to type things in?

1296
01:15:51,235 --> 01:15:54,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's just a browser. It's like, this is Chrome. You like Chrome, right?

1297
01:15:54,795 --> 01:15:56,885
Speaker 4:  Okay. Go to YouTube. Your mom is so much

1298
01:15:57,195 --> 01:15:58,045
Speaker 5:  More advanced than my mom.

1299
01:15:58,985 --> 01:16:02,845
Speaker 4:  But like now what I worry about with Chromes to say added Android apps, now

1300
01:16:02,845 --> 01:16:06,205
Speaker 4:  they're adding Cameo. They're getting the same place where you're like, oh,

1301
01:16:06,205 --> 01:16:09,125
Speaker 4:  there's multiple competing application metaphors at once. Yep.

1302
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:14,365
Speaker 4:  Okay. But I still love a Chromebook. Oh, and Chromebook pluses

1303
01:16:14,365 --> 01:16:18,005
Speaker 4:  now have all the man. Yeah. It's like I just want a brow man.

1304
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:18,605
Speaker 4:  That

1305
01:16:18,655 --> 01:16:19,965
Speaker 5:  Pixel book was such a good,

1306
01:16:20,025 --> 01:16:23,925
Speaker 6:  It was very fun watching everybody argue in our comments about sort of

1307
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:27,365
Speaker 6:  the, the overall Chromebook thesis. And like, one of the things obviously

1308
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:30,845
Speaker 6:  Chromebooks have done is they've been hugely successful in schools.

1309
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:34,925
Speaker 6:  And there were a lot of people in our comments who were like, yeah, I had

1310
01:16:34,925 --> 01:16:37,965
Speaker 6:  a Chromebook in high school and it ensured that I will never ever buy myself

1311
01:16:37,965 --> 01:16:41,365
Speaker 6:  a Chromebook because it was a piece of junk. And it was like, yeah,

1312
01:16:41,655 --> 01:16:45,165
Speaker 6:  maybe at some point Google and others should have invested in making Chromebooks

1313
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:48,725
Speaker 6:  good. And then people would want them. Like what a crazy idea that would

1314
01:16:48,725 --> 01:16:49,205
Speaker 6:  be. Yeah.

1315
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:50,645
Speaker 5:  They should put Arc on it.

1316
01:16:51,325 --> 01:16:54,285
Speaker 4:  I had a Chrome, I bought my mom a Chromebook Pixel, a thousand dollars Chrome

1317
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:58,085
Speaker 4:  laptop. People thought I was nuts. It's still rocking. Yeah. 'cause it has

1318
01:16:58,085 --> 01:16:59,365
Speaker 4:  like 16 gigs of rain

1319
01:16:59,755 --> 01:17:01,485
Speaker 6:  Runs. Yeah. That had 10 times the power it needed.

1320
01:17:01,745 --> 01:17:02,405
Speaker 5:  It was such a good

1321
01:17:02,405 --> 01:17:05,365
Speaker 4:  Laptop, like an I seven. It was amazing. Still going 'cause it just runs

1322
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:09,645
Speaker 4:  rules. Alright, mine is last minute game time

1323
01:17:09,845 --> 01:17:13,605
Speaker 4:  decision. We just put this story up. The chair

1324
01:17:13,665 --> 01:17:17,245
Speaker 4:  of the Tesla board is warning shareholders today

1325
01:17:17,395 --> 01:17:21,085
Speaker 4:  that if they don't approve Elon's $56 billion pay package,

1326
01:17:21,425 --> 01:17:22,965
Speaker 4:  he might leave Tesla. Oh no,

1327
01:17:24,835 --> 01:17:25,125
Speaker 4:  Alex.

1328
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:26,725
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's

1329
01:17:27,165 --> 01:17:31,085
Speaker 4:  Terrible. Elon is not a typical executive and Tesla's not

1330
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:34,525
Speaker 4:  a typical company. He says in the letter, which was filed to the SEC. So

1331
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,605
Speaker 4:  the typical way in which companies compensate key executives will not drive

1332
01:17:37,605 --> 01:17:41,125
Speaker 4:  results for Tesla motivating someone like Elon requires something different.

1333
01:17:41,185 --> 01:17:41,565
Speaker 4:  He says,

1334
01:17:41,985 --> 01:17:45,605
Speaker 6:  To be fair, I would also be very motivated by $56 billion.

1335
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:48,165
Speaker 6:  Like, I dunno that that's different. That's the same

1336
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:52,805
Speaker 4:  Somehow he says, and it's not about the money, it's like

1337
01:17:52,805 --> 01:17:56,765
Speaker 4:  following up. You gotta motivate Elon somehow. And then it's not about the

1338
01:17:56,765 --> 01:17:59,525
Speaker 4:  money when the letter is about approve the pay package. Didn't

1339
01:17:59,525 --> 01:18:00,005
Speaker 5:  He just like

1340
01:18:00,365 --> 01:18:01,925
Speaker 4:  Threaten the needle there buddy? Didn't

1341
01:18:01,925 --> 01:18:05,765
Speaker 5:  He just screw over Tesla by having a bunch of like

1342
01:18:06,405 --> 01:18:08,125
Speaker 5:  H one hundreds from Nvidia shipped?

1343
01:18:08,435 --> 01:18:12,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. He sent them to X instead. X instead. This Matt Levine at Bloomberg

1344
01:18:12,435 --> 01:18:15,285
Speaker 6:  made what I thought was a very good point about this, which is that what

1345
01:18:15,285 --> 01:18:19,165
Speaker 6:  this, the, the initial read on that is like, oh, this is a

1346
01:18:19,165 --> 01:18:22,285
Speaker 6:  sign that Elon Musk is not paying attention to Tesla. Why would you give

1347
01:18:22,285 --> 01:18:26,245
Speaker 6:  him the money? The the Galaxy brain take is, oh, this

1348
01:18:26,245 --> 01:18:30,165
Speaker 6:  is a threat that if you don't give Elon Musk his money, he will stop paying

1349
01:18:30,165 --> 01:18:33,925
Speaker 6:  attention to Tesla. And this is what will happen. Yeah. And I think that

1350
01:18:33,945 --> 01:18:37,645
Speaker 6:  is a fun, like war games

1351
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:41,565
Speaker 6:  version of this story that is just gonna keep getting worse. He's obviously

1352
01:18:41,565 --> 01:18:43,245
Speaker 6:  gonna get the money right? Like, oh

1353
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:46,485
Speaker 4:  No, you don't think so? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think he's gonna

1354
01:18:46,485 --> 01:18:49,845
Speaker 4:  get the money. No, this vote doesn't even guarantee that he gets money. You

1355
01:18:49,845 --> 01:18:51,125
Speaker 4:  could win this vote and still not get the money.

1356
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,565
Speaker 6:  Okay, that's fair. I think he'll win the vote.

1357
01:18:55,055 --> 01:18:58,045
Speaker 4:  Maybe. I think I, I think they're worried. I don't think that Chairman of

1358
01:18:58,045 --> 01:19:01,805
Speaker 4:  your boards since the letter about how you have to motivate

1359
01:19:01,955 --> 01:19:05,325
Speaker 4:  Elon, which by the way is hilarious. That's a letter you send about like

1360
01:19:05,405 --> 01:19:07,405
Speaker 4:  a, like me in eighth grade. Yeah.

1361
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:10,885
Speaker 6:  Do you think $56 billion would've done it for you?

1362
01:19:11,275 --> 01:19:15,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I don't know. I was not a typical eighth grader and

1363
01:19:15,245 --> 01:19:17,325
Speaker 4:  I did not respond to typical motivations.

1364
01:19:19,135 --> 01:19:23,045
Speaker 4:  Right. We have to challenge him. We gotta keep him involved. Otherwise

1365
01:19:23,155 --> 01:19:26,285
Speaker 4:  he's gonna light yet another classroom on fire. Like

1366
01:19:27,605 --> 01:19:29,005
Speaker 4:  I just, that's a crazy letter.

1367
01:19:29,035 --> 01:19:29,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it really is.

1368
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:31,085
Speaker 5:  That's too much.

1369
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:34,205
Speaker 4:  And I will point out, Chancery Daily has been in great work on this if you've

1370
01:19:34,205 --> 01:19:37,445
Speaker 4:  follow that. They've followed a lot of the Tesla and Twitter back and forth.

1371
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:43,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like the court in Delaware said this pay package was illegal.

1372
01:19:43,395 --> 01:19:46,645
Speaker 4:  Like this vote doesn't cure the problem.

1373
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:51,005
Speaker 4:  Actually it's, it's like a weird dance. Who knows,

1374
01:19:51,145 --> 01:19:53,005
Speaker 4:  man. I just think he,

1375
01:19:55,025 --> 01:19:58,925
Speaker 4:  the need, the thing that caught my eye here is all this preamble

1376
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:01,845
Speaker 4:  about how it takes something special to motivate Elon.

1377
01:20:02,755 --> 01:20:06,645
Speaker 4:  It's not money. And then it's like, and also vote for the money. Yeah. It's

1378
01:20:06,645 --> 01:20:10,525
Speaker 4:  very good. All right, we're gonna wwc, we gotta get outta

1379
01:20:10,525 --> 01:20:14,445
Speaker 4:  here. That vote by the way is June 13th where Andy and Liz are primed

1380
01:20:14,465 --> 01:20:18,405
Speaker 4:  to Co, as you can imagine, primed to cover it. It's gonna be, I think

1381
01:20:18,405 --> 01:20:21,685
Speaker 4:  it's gonna be wild. I think the future of Tesla and X and

1382
01:20:22,105 --> 01:20:25,725
Speaker 4:  SpaceX kind of all tied up in this one little very odd

1383
01:20:25,845 --> 01:20:29,005
Speaker 4:  moment. Yeah. So they'll be covering that next week while we are headed back

1384
01:20:29,005 --> 01:20:32,845
Speaker 4:  from dub dub. I think there's gonna be a lot of stuff to cover outta

1385
01:20:32,845 --> 01:20:36,765
Speaker 4:  dub dub. I was saying this to our team today. People have a lot of feelings

1386
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:40,165
Speaker 4:  about ai. Yeah. And Apple putting AI all over its operating system.

1387
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:43,845
Speaker 4:  If you just look at the response to that ad that Alex mentioned before, that

1388
01:20:43,845 --> 01:20:47,605
Speaker 4:  Crush ad, that crush ad, that ad was not about ai. That was just about

1389
01:20:47,855 --> 01:20:51,605
Speaker 4:  iPads. Yeah. You actually do the thing where the photo

1390
01:20:51,605 --> 01:20:55,245
Speaker 4:  editing gets easier or the copy is easier to write. I think people,

1391
01:20:55,575 --> 01:20:58,885
Speaker 4:  apple has a lot of creatives who care a lot about this company. It's gonna

1392
01:20:58,885 --> 01:21:00,605
Speaker 4:  be a weird time next week I think. Yeah,

1393
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:01,565
Speaker 8:  I would agree.

1394
01:21:01,825 --> 01:21:05,285
Speaker 4:  So all that covered, that's why The Verge exists. Why do we exist? That's

1395
01:21:05,285 --> 01:21:09,125
Speaker 4:  why to figure out why we make art with computers. And the answer

1396
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:12,445
Speaker 4:  according to all trans, is to do weird horny stuff. Yeah. That's it. That's

1397
01:21:12,445 --> 01:21:13,525
Speaker 4:  The Verge cast rock and roll.

1398
01:21:19,065 --> 01:21:22,405
Speaker 8:  And that's it for The Verge Cast this week. Hey, we'd love to hear from you.
