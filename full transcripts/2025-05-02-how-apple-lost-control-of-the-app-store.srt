Description: Everywhere you look, antitrust fights have the potential to reshape the tech industry. Nilay, David, and The Verge's Jake Kastrenakes start by digging into the latest ruling in the Apple / Epic trial, in which a furious judge rips open the App Store in a way Apple likely never saw coming. The way we pay for apps is about to change, and fast. After that, it's time for an update on the Google and Meta trials, as Google tries to preserve its search empire and Meta tries to make the case that basically every company on the web is its vicious competitor. Finally, in the lightning round, it's time for another installment of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, plus some notes on this week's Worldcoin launch and the strange new Meta AI app. Also: party speakers. Always party speakers.


2
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:51,515
Speaker 5:  Hello and welcome to Vergecast the flagship podcast about being right

3
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:55,515
Speaker 5:  about esoteric legal opinions four and a half years later

4
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:59,875
Speaker 5:  after you wrote that blog post. So it's a niche, but it's ours. I mean, honestly,

5
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:00,795
Speaker 5:  like what else is it?

6
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,995
Speaker 6:  You? You bid your time. And finally, finally,

7
00:02:05,495 --> 00:02:08,355
Speaker 5:  It took a long time, but I can say,

8
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:13,035
Speaker 5:  we can all say it's a flagship podcast of people who can say, I wrote this

9
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:16,965
Speaker 5:  blog post four years ago and I was right. That's true. That's where you

10
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:20,885
Speaker 5:  wanna be in life. And I welcome our tiny but dedicated community, our

11
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:24,765
Speaker 5:  competitor podcast in this field as you know, our our week. And yeah, we're

12
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:28,725
Speaker 5:  gonna win this Webby next year for sure. I'm your friend Neil. That's David Pierce.

13
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:31,325
Speaker 5:  Hello, Jake Cast is here. Hey,

14
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:31,845
Speaker 6:  Good to be here.

15
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:35,565
Speaker 5:  Obviously what we're talking about is the big Apple ruling that came down

16
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:39,085
Speaker 5:  this week. Apple was found in contempt of court, referred for

17
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:43,285
Speaker 5:  criminal proceedings because an Apple executive lied in court

18
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:47,165
Speaker 5:  under oath. I was joking with a big tech executive today

19
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:51,085
Speaker 5:  that sometimes I think we founded The Verge 13 and a half years ago to

20
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:54,635
Speaker 5:  cover this story. Like we just needed to be here

21
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:58,795
Speaker 5:  because Apple got in trouble for lying about the difference between a button

22
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:02,645
Speaker 5:  and a link and how much those should cost. And The

23
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:06,685
Speaker 5:  Verge, The Verge was just lying in wait to be like, yep, buttons

24
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:07,805
Speaker 5:  and links. That's what we do here.

25
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:11,005
Speaker 7:  I had the exact same experience reading the ruling. We're gonna talk a lot

26
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:14,005
Speaker 7:  about this, but I had this distinct moment of being like, oh,

27
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:18,885
Speaker 7:  where do the buttons go? Is The Verge. That's the

28
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:22,205
Speaker 7:  whole, the whole question we are here to answer Yep. Is where do the buttons

29
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:22,365
Speaker 7:  go?

30
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:25,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there's a line in there that says A better design button would make

31
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,885
Speaker 5:  the market more competitive. And I was like, well, we did it. That's The

32
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:32,885
Speaker 5:  Verge cast. Like, I dunno what to tell you. That's our whole show.

33
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:35,885
Speaker 5:  That's all we ever talk about. So we, we gotta talk about that at length.

34
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:40,005
Speaker 5:  All of us have been covering that story every inch of that story for a long

35
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:43,645
Speaker 5:  time. So we gotta talk about that. Meta is still in trial.

36
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:47,645
Speaker 5:  It's antitrust trials ongoing. David was at the Google trial where Sundar

37
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:51,605
Speaker 5:  Hai was on the stand this week. We, we will talk about

38
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:55,165
Speaker 5:  Brendan, we always talk about Brendan. He, he lurks, he looms

39
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:59,405
Speaker 5:  over the ecosystem. But first I, I wanna start with a party

40
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,205
Speaker 5:  speaker. Update

41
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:01,485
Speaker 7:  Party speaker update.

42
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:03,245
Speaker 5:  Very important party speaker, update

43
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:06,565
Speaker 7:  Party speaker Capitalism is in the running to become the newest

44
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,245
Speaker 7:  podcaster than a podcast at the Bcast.

45
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:13,405
Speaker 5:  So as you all know, It is our belief that the market for gigantic

46
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:17,405
Speaker 5:  Bluetooth party speakers with LED lights in the drivers is

47
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:21,325
Speaker 5:  bigger than anyone can comprehend. It is right in front of you, but it's

48
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:22,285
Speaker 5:  so big you can't see it

49
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:23,365
Speaker 7:  Just like the party speaker.

50
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:27,565
Speaker 5:  It's a worldwide phenomenon. It is driving the whole tech industry

51
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:30,645
Speaker 5:  and no one wants to talk about it. It's shrugged under the rug. And we talk

52
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,565
Speaker 5:  about it here on the Birch Cast. We're five generations into

53
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:38,425
Speaker 5:  these things. The market is demanding them. People are providing them over

54
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:41,385
Speaker 5:  and over again. They're getting bigger, they're getting bolder. So we've

55
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:44,705
Speaker 5:  asked people to send us these party speakers in the wild. It's like crypts.

56
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:48,585
Speaker 5:  Have you seen Bigfoot? I will say a lot of people send

57
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:52,505
Speaker 5:  us photos of the speakers in the box in the store. I

58
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:55,625
Speaker 5:  appreciate you. I love that you see a speaker and you think of us.

59
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:59,955
Speaker 5:  It makes me happy. That's not what we want. That's not in the wild,

60
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:03,905
Speaker 5:  you know what I mean? It's, that's in captivity. It's

61
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:04,265
Speaker 5:  constrained.

62
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,385
Speaker 7:  The Speaker zoo, as we call Best Buy. I

63
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:09,705
Speaker 5:  Wanna see what's really happening. I wanna see what this market really looks

64
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:13,065
Speaker 5:  like. So we've gotten a million pictures of

65
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:16,065
Speaker 5:  speakers in stores, but that's not quite it. I appreciate you, but that's

66
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:20,025
Speaker 5:  not it. We've gotten a, a second million set

67
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:23,665
Speaker 5:  of photos of speakers at kids baseball and softball games.

68
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:26,025
Speaker 7:  Yes, those are, those are very good. Those qualify. These

69
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,745
Speaker 5:  Are the primary market from what I can tell. Walk-on music for 12 year

70
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:32,585
Speaker 5:  olds who are about to just hit a dinger. That's what party speakers are for.

71
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:33,705
Speaker 5:  Everyone's very happy about this.

72
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:35,665
Speaker 5:  Great.

73
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:41,195
Speaker 5:  I would like to understand what is going on in Europe based

74
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:45,155
Speaker 5:  on the imagery we have received from our listeners in Europe. So

75
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:48,835
Speaker 5:  Daniel sending a picture of two people

76
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:53,275
Speaker 5:  riding a scooter, like one of those bird scooters. The person

77
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,995
Speaker 5:  in front is sitting on what appears to be a three foot party speaker

78
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:01,645
Speaker 5:  with his hands on the handlebars, and then there's a person standing

79
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,925
Speaker 5:  on the back on the break and they're just cruising.

80
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:06,645
Speaker 7:  This might be the coolest picture I've ever seen in my life.

81
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:09,325
Speaker 5:  It is one of the most European pictures I've ever seen in my entire life.

82
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,565
Speaker 5:  We'll run it. We'll put smiley faces over the faces, the whole thing. If

83
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:12,645
Speaker 5:  you watch it on YouTube, you can see the photo.

84
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:17,085
Speaker 5:  We'll, we'll put it in the container post on the website as itself. Everybody

85
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:17,685
Speaker 7:  Looks really

86
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:21,725
Speaker 5:  Cool. Daniel says he thinks that the speaker's on the lights are on.

87
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:25,325
Speaker 5:  He took the photo from his car. I appreciate you having the wherewithal to

88
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:28,925
Speaker 5:  be in your car. See this, pull out your phone, snap a photo, think of us

89
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:30,445
Speaker 5:  and send us the photo. Yeah,

90
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,645
Speaker 7:  There's a little motion blur in here. Like something's happening.

91
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:36,605
Speaker 5:  That's what you want. Like if you run a tech podcast, you want

92
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:40,405
Speaker 5:  people to see this and be like, I need, i I need to send this in.

93
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:44,565
Speaker 5:  That's the kind of citizen journalism we're looking for. Daniel says he thinks

94
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:47,365
Speaker 5:  it was on because the lights were on, but he was in a car so he can hear

95
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:51,145
Speaker 5:  it. And then he said, and then he says, somehow it's

96
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:54,905
Speaker 5:  not the first speaker on scooter I've seen in Oslo either.

97
00:06:56,795 --> 00:07:00,495
Speaker 5:  So there's a hot new trend in Norway where people are putting

98
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:04,695
Speaker 5:  speakers on the scooters and cruising around with the

99
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:08,655
Speaker 5:  speaker as a chair. I love it. I love it. Just send us more

100
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:09,775
Speaker 5:  photos of that. Is it

101
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:13,975
Speaker 7:  Possible that portable stool that plays music is,

102
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:16,335
Speaker 7:  is an underrated feature of the party speaker?

103
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:17,015
Speaker 5:  I dunno,

104
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:21,935
Speaker 5:  I'll just say this. Smart. It's a, it's crypted, right? It's it's everywhere.

105
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:25,895
Speaker 5:  It's nowhere. No one can see it. There's no research. The great analysts

106
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:29,415
Speaker 5:  of our time are not writing party speaker notes to CNBC. You know, like

107
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:33,815
Speaker 5:  we have to do this together ourselves, otherwise no one will

108
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:37,975
Speaker 5:  understand it. Okay. So that's one I, again, I dunno what's going

109
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:41,455
Speaker 5:  on in Europe. And then there's even more European speaker activity.

110
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:45,615
Speaker 5:  Fabio writes us, Fabio sent us a video. He says, I'm writing you from the

111
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:48,615
Speaker 5:  law Italy, where I realized I have witnessed the largest

112
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:53,335
Speaker 5:  concentration of party speakers outside of US Navy ship for weeks without

113
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:57,295
Speaker 5:  realizing it. Yesterday as I was walking through the Porto Vincia subway

114
00:07:57,295 --> 00:08:00,775
Speaker 5:  station, I think that's how I pronounce it, I saw LEDs lighting up a, a

115
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:04,095
Speaker 5:  kid-sized party speaker and realized I was the right person in the right

116
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:08,135
Speaker 5:  situation to send you an email that would fill your heart with joy. I love

117
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:08,655
Speaker 5:  you Fabio.

118
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,895
Speaker 7:  You were right Fabio. It did

119
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:13,735
Speaker 5:  The subway station there in Port Venga has, is the ideal place for people

120
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:17,455
Speaker 5:  of all ages, genders, nationalities, and passive lives to gather and train

121
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:21,355
Speaker 5:  their dance moves. What each of these groups had in common was party

122
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:24,035
Speaker 5:  speakers blasting music in the echoing hall. All different songs of different

123
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:27,995
Speaker 5:  genres of music. I'm saying there were four plus speakers,

124
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:31,795
Speaker 5:  but only because I managed to film four speakers. But believe me, there were

125
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:35,075
Speaker 5:  more. And then he sent us a video of competing

126
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,665
Speaker 5:  groups of European teenagers, like practicing

127
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:43,575
Speaker 5:  dances in the subway station with different speakers and they're all like

128
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:44,335
Speaker 5:  kind of next to each other.

129
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:48,975
Speaker 7:  This suggests a possibility that I had not even considered until

130
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:52,855
Speaker 7:  just now, which is a party speaker arms race. Oh yeah. That is

131
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:56,365
Speaker 7:  the party speakers. The only way to outdo someone else's

132
00:08:56,475 --> 00:09:00,125
Speaker 7:  extremely portable party speaker is with a larger, extremely

133
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,645
Speaker 7:  portable power speaker with more base and more

134
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:07,645
Speaker 7:  lights. More lights. And this is, this is, this is how like the

135
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:11,565
Speaker 7:  way Apple gets you from a MacBook Air to a fully kitted out MacBook Pro.

136
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:15,085
Speaker 7:  You just, you gotta go up the line or you're gonna get bested on a party

137
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:15,405
Speaker 7:  speaker.

138
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,885
Speaker 5:  So wait until you're the next one. Come

139
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:18,005
Speaker 7:  On.

140
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,925
Speaker 5:  So I said last week, my dream, because we had heard that

141
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:26,285
Speaker 5:  the US military has a lot of party speakers in it. And I said, can someone

142
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:29,805
Speaker 5:  please send me a picture of a party speaker next to a fighter jet preferably

143
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:32,965
Speaker 5:  taking off. I will say I, I requested taking off at dusk,

144
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:37,715
Speaker 5:  but we got the next best thing. Jason, who is a literal fighter pilot who

145
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:41,555
Speaker 5:  listens to the show. Thank you very much. Jason says, I can confirm that

146
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:44,915
Speaker 5:  the US Navy is a target population for the party speaker market.

147
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,995
Speaker 5:  I'm a pilot in a US Navy FA 18 squadron, and our sailors

148
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:53,035
Speaker 5:  love the big party speakers for providing something to listen to while working

149
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:56,155
Speaker 5:  in the hangar while shore side or in the hangar bay of an aircraft carrier

150
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:59,435
Speaker 5:  when deployed. They can't wear AirPods while working. They need to maintain

151
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:02,995
Speaker 5:  clear ears and the work environment can be loud. So you need speakers to

152
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:06,075
Speaker 5:  pump out a good amount of volume. Anything that has lights added, cool factor.

153
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:09,115
Speaker 5:  The Navy units don't own purchase them or sailors do it on their own dime

154
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:12,515
Speaker 5:  to make work a bit more pleasant. It is not uncommon to have

155
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,875
Speaker 5:  dueling party speakers playing very different music separated by a hundred

156
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:19,795
Speaker 5:  feet. It is chaos for the ears, but it helps with morale. And he sent

157
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:23,755
Speaker 5:  us a photo of a party speaker next to an F 18, which

158
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:27,715
Speaker 5:  rules, and he actually gave us the model number of the speaker. It is

159
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:31,055
Speaker 5:  an Edison PSL 800. I love it.

160
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:34,495
Speaker 5:  This is like what maybe the best photo we we've ever gotten at the perch.

161
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:37,655
Speaker 7:  It really is. It's very good. And I also, I like this because

162
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:42,495
Speaker 7:  you can sort of imagine the meeting at Sony and all these other companies

163
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:44,495
Speaker 7:  where they were like, should we, should we make it so that you can like,

164
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:48,695
Speaker 7:  use a bunch of them sort of together? Like you can, you can chain them together

165
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:51,375
Speaker 7:  via Bluetooth or whatever. And somebody's like, who in the hell is gonna

166
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,535
Speaker 7:  put more than one of these in a room? They look at the size of this thing,

167
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:58,535
Speaker 7:  why would you need more than one? And the Navy's like, listen guys, I need

168
00:10:58,595 --> 00:10:59,855
Speaker 7:  six of these all at once

169
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:02,975
Speaker 5:  Together. No, they, so a lot of them can do like Aura cast and actually be

170
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:06,805
Speaker 5:  chained together. Like this is a, a part of like a

171
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:10,565
Speaker 5:  mesh audio standard that exists. Everyone's very, they've all done the, the

172
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:13,325
Speaker 5:  bad thing, which is they took the standard and they named it their own thing.

173
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,965
Speaker 5:  So you don't know, but it's actually this thing called the Wirecast. And

174
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:19,765
Speaker 5:  so you can chain like a hundred speakers together with just a standard that

175
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:21,285
Speaker 5:  exists that all the companies support. But

176
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:21,565
Speaker 7:  That's good.

177
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:25,265
Speaker 5:  Okay. But that's not what we're seeing. We're seeing groups of

178
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:28,905
Speaker 5:  competing teens playing different music on different speakers

179
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:33,025
Speaker 5:  right next to each other. Groups of sailors doing fighter

180
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,345
Speaker 5:  jet maintenance, playing different songs and different speakers right next

181
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:40,305
Speaker 5:  to each other. This is like the, the end result of, I'm listening to my own

182
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:44,065
Speaker 5:  TikTok on the subway, but now with like, this is your arms race.

183
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,985
Speaker 7:  We are all listening to everyone's TikTok on the subway.

184
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:53,845
Speaker 5:  I love it. I love it. All of you. Thank you for emailing us. Even

185
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:57,565
Speaker 5:  the people who send us pictures of the speakers in Walmart, this is an

186
00:11:57,565 --> 00:12:01,445
Speaker 5:  escalation. You gotta send us even better pictures and videos of party speakers

187
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:05,365
Speaker 5:  in the wild where I I can, we, we have to figure

188
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:08,835
Speaker 5:  this out as a community. There's, there's no market

189
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:12,355
Speaker 5:  intelligence on party speakers. If there is, it's like locked away

190
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,195
Speaker 5:  in the Sony vaults.

191
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,385
Speaker 5:  We're gonna bring it out. We're gonna bring this to light. The media's not

192
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:18,905
Speaker 5:  talking about this.

193
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:23,065
Speaker 7:  The mainstream media could never,

194
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:27,425
Speaker 5:  That's what say, do you see this in the New York Times? Right? You turn

195
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:30,145
Speaker 5:  on CNN Night. Are they showing you pictures of fighter jets with party speakers?

196
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:33,825
Speaker 5:  Edison, PSL eighties, eight hundreds. That's what,

197
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,665
Speaker 5:  not even whatever. They're not talking about this.

198
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:41,595
Speaker 5:  I love it. Thank you all so much for sending this stuff. We, we wanna see

199
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:45,275
Speaker 5:  more of it. It is, It is very funny to me and I

200
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:47,835
Speaker 5:  love that we're doing this little project together. Alright, we should talk

201
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:51,805
Speaker 5:  about Apple. It's a big one. Middle of the night

202
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:55,445
Speaker 5:  filing from Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, the judge in the case

203
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,485
Speaker 5:  Epic versus Apple. That case filed in 2020

204
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,985
Speaker 5:  big trial, right? Epic said Apple had a monopoly over its own devices,

205
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:07,965
Speaker 5:  which is a very, you know, it's a very big argument to make

206
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:11,605
Speaker 5:  in 2020 that like, you have to rewind your brain. This is the beginning of

207
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:16,435
Speaker 5:  the modern tech antitrust era, right? All this stuff hadn't

208
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:20,235
Speaker 5:  happened. The idea that Meta and Google and Apple would all be facing federal

209
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:24,235
Speaker 5:  lawsuits about having monopolies was not on the table in 2020

210
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,155
Speaker 5:  when Epic filed this case,

211
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,275
Speaker 7:  Epic also picked this fight very specifically and very

212
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,755
Speaker 7:  aggressively. Like, it, it, it dropped the 1984

213
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:36,355
Speaker 7:  commercial. It dropped it, it did a thing with

214
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:39,795
Speaker 7:  payments inside of Fortnite designed to get kicked out of this. Like

215
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:44,185
Speaker 7:  antitrust moves slowly. And this case has taken five years,

216
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,225
Speaker 7:  but Epic has pushed harder and more aggressively

217
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:53,385
Speaker 7:  and more like with more spectacle than anybody else

218
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:57,105
Speaker 7:  in this entire whole realm of antitrust fights.

219
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:01,145
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it, it, it against Google it It is won in like

220
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:04,985
Speaker 5:  substantial ways against Apple. You know, it's really interesting is again,

221
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:08,945
Speaker 5:  it was, it was so early that I think the judge in that case

222
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,665
Speaker 5:  looked at Epic's arguments. It looked at the

223
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:17,305
Speaker 5:  standards of sort of like 1980s antitrust standards that we had,

224
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:21,945
Speaker 5:  again, 2020 pre lien Khan at the ftc, right? This is the Trump administration.

225
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,785
Speaker 5:  This case was filed under. So we hadn't had this big conversation

226
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:28,745
Speaker 5:  about changing antitrust standards and whether Ronald Reagan was bad. All

227
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:32,145
Speaker 5:  this stuff that created the conditions that we're now this is before all

228
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:35,265
Speaker 5:  that. So I think the judge looked at all of that and said, well, I'm not

229
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:38,705
Speaker 5:  gonna be the first judge in this case to accept

230
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:43,705
Speaker 5:  this like, pretty big idea that Apple has a monopoly over

231
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:47,425
Speaker 5:  its own devices in this specific way. Like, no, I'm not, she's like, not

232
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:51,205
Speaker 5:  gonna happen. But I have all this evidence that the app

233
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:55,085
Speaker 5:  store's bad and that Apple restricts competition on the app store. And I'm

234
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:58,605
Speaker 5:  sitting in California and there's a California unfair competition law,

235
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:02,205
Speaker 5:  and I'm gonna say under this California com unfair competition law, which

236
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:04,845
Speaker 5:  is very broadly construed. Apple has to stop

237
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:09,225
Speaker 5:  prohibiting developers from even saying

238
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:14,105
Speaker 5:  you can buy digital services and digital products elsewhere for

239
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:17,955
Speaker 5:  a cheaper price. Because at the time Apple prohibited Netflix

240
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:21,835
Speaker 5:  and Spotify and Epic and anyone else from even saying

241
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:26,035
Speaker 5:  this subscription is $3 cheaper if you do it on our website. You

242
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:28,955
Speaker 7:  Couldn't even say, you can also subscribe on our website. You couldn't even

243
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:32,595
Speaker 7:  have a link to your website. Yeah. It's like in in the Apple ecosystem,

244
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:37,235
Speaker 7:  the broader internet did not exist and was not allowed to exist.

245
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:41,275
Speaker 7:  And that was, that was the, that was the thing Epic won on, right? Like it,

246
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,715
Speaker 7:  it lost on some of its bigger swings, but like we all spent a lot of time

247
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,755
Speaker 7:  though in those years talking about the phrase anti steering provisions and

248
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,355
Speaker 7:  like, and that that became the thing here. Well

249
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,955
Speaker 5:  So you know, there's this narrative, I could argue this either way, but there's

250
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,315
Speaker 5:  this narrative that Apple won most of the case in Epic only won this small

251
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:01,775
Speaker 5:  thing and anti steering was the whole thing.

252
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:06,175
Speaker 5:  It was the whole thing. What Epic really wanted was to put the

253
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:10,015
Speaker 5:  Epic game store on iOS and control its own store. But you

254
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:13,855
Speaker 5:  only wanna do that if what you're mad about are Apple's rules for

255
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:17,935
Speaker 5:  its store. Sure. And what is the biggest rule? The biggest rule

256
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:21,935
Speaker 5:  is the Apple tax. Like far and away, the biggest rule is that to put a button

257
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:25,615
Speaker 5:  to buy anything in your app, you have to pay Apple 30 or 15 or whatever

258
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:28,935
Speaker 5:  percentage structure it worked out to by now.

259
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:33,815
Speaker 5:  And if you get rid of that rule, the incentives for wanting your own

260
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:37,675
Speaker 5:  store kind of fall. Right? You, you, you've solved the problem.

261
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:41,775
Speaker 5:  The only reason you want other store is to have lower rates or in, in the

262
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:45,575
Speaker 5:  case of the alternative stores we're seeing in Europe to do apps

263
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:49,055
Speaker 5:  that Apple otherwise wouldn't let you do. Right? Emulators and porn apps

264
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:52,695
Speaker 5:  and stuff like that. But for the vast majority of developers, all they really

265
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:56,175
Speaker 5:  cared about was, I can't do purchases in this app without paying Apple a

266
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:59,435
Speaker 5:  fee. Like Netflix doesn't care. You

267
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,355
Speaker 6:  Can look to Europe like we haven't seen that much change. We have,

268
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,315
Speaker 6:  which may might be because Apple's rules are so strict over there still,

269
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:10,555
Speaker 6:  but how many, you know, brand new ideas for apps

270
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:14,475
Speaker 6:  or models for apps are we seeing over there that couldn't exist in the

271
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:17,595
Speaker 6:  app store, right? Apple was just like, here's emulators.

272
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:21,635
Speaker 5:  Well, so the number one model was emulators. Yep. And the instant that

273
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:25,635
Speaker 5:  happened, apple changed its rules to put emulators in the store. And so you

274
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:29,595
Speaker 5:  see like competition leads to results. But my point is,

275
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:33,735
Speaker 5:  the whole game here was always anti sti. It was

276
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,855
Speaker 5:  always letting developers say, you can transact for cheaper somewhere

277
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:41,795
Speaker 5:  else. And Apple lost. It just lost. And so in, in the

278
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,595
Speaker 5:  realest way, the biggest part of the problem was being dealt with by the

279
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:49,410
Speaker 5:  court. And I think this judge again remind your brain to that period in time

280
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:53,285
Speaker 5:  was looking at the landscape of antitrust policy and antitrust law and saying,

281
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,705
Speaker 5:  yeah, I can't just like change the law

282
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:01,175
Speaker 5:  before it's re before it's time. Like she

283
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:03,735
Speaker 5:  just wasn't gonna do it. That's not, it's not how district courts work. Maybe

284
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:06,455
Speaker 5:  courts of appeals do that. Maybe Supreme Court does that. They love doing

285
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:09,855
Speaker 5:  that. But the sort of district court judge in Apple versus Epic wasn't gonna

286
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,465
Speaker 5:  say, you know what, this lien at con's, a real firecracker,

287
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:16,905
Speaker 5:  like, it's just like wasn't gonna happen. So the Apple lost in this state

288
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:20,825
Speaker 5:  court claim, they litigated ninth Circuit. They lost, they asked this

289
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:23,785
Speaker 5:  Supreme Court. Supreme Court said, no dice, you're this is done. And then

290
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:27,755
Speaker 5:  I think Apple didn't take it seriously and they,

291
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:32,355
Speaker 5:  Jake wrote the entire narrative, which we should talk about. They did played

292
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:35,995
Speaker 5:  all these games to fake compliance with this ruling

293
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:40,495
Speaker 5:  'cause they weren't taking it seriously. And I got caught, like

294
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:44,095
Speaker 5:  caught in the worst way. And now the judge is like, actually

295
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:48,255
Speaker 5:  we're not just doing my small anti steering rule, we're doing the big one.

296
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:52,335
Speaker 5:  Like, you're not allowed to do anything because you've delayed for so long,

297
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:56,055
Speaker 5:  you've made the harm worse. So now it's a free for all

298
00:18:56,475 --> 00:19:00,135
Speaker 5:  app developers can do anything they want effective immediately to do transactions

299
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:03,415
Speaker 5:  in their apps. No more fees and you have no choice. And she says

300
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:06,935
Speaker 5:  it's worth reading this entire opinion in full 'cause It is full of bombs.

301
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:11,255
Speaker 5:  She, at the end she says, this is an injunction, not a negotiation.

302
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:13,705
Speaker 5:  So it's like this is over.

303
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:18,025
Speaker 7:  I do think, I think the the narrative here is important. And Jake, I know

304
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:20,345
Speaker 7:  you wrote this through and you should kind of give us the timeline because

305
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,585
Speaker 7:  I think, I think saying Apple didn't take it seriously, actually,

306
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,545
Speaker 7:  lets Apple off the hook a little bit. I think Apple

307
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:32,305
Speaker 7:  basically got this ruling and had two years worth of meetings about how

308
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,945
Speaker 7:  to give two middle fingers to this ruling and to continue to get what it

309
00:19:35,945 --> 00:19:38,985
Speaker 7:  wants and to essentially, like we, we talked about it on the show as malicious

310
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:42,385
Speaker 7:  compliance. Like this was the most malicious possible version

311
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:46,425
Speaker 7:  of compliance to the point where Judge Gonzalez Rogers decided

312
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,025
Speaker 7:  actually this isn't compliance at all. You, you have gone out of your way

313
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:53,785
Speaker 7:  to not comply with this order while looking like you're complying with this

314
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:57,185
Speaker 7:  order. And in fact lying to the court about how you're not complying with

315
00:19:57,185 --> 00:20:00,185
Speaker 7:  this order. But Jake, you, you ran down the timeline here. Can you just give

316
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:01,785
Speaker 7:  us like the short version of it? Yeah. And,

317
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,225
Speaker 6:  And the judge is, is pissed. Like she, she sees through all of it and is

318
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,385
Speaker 6:  is furious about how it went down. Yeah, I think Apple has for a really long

319
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:12,305
Speaker 6:  time operated in this environment where it can kind of just, you know,

320
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,055
Speaker 6:  control whatever it wants and do things how it wants to, nobody's really

321
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:17,455
Speaker 6:  on them.

322
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:22,735
Speaker 6:  They, they make some tweaks around the edges and say, sorry, see you later.

323
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:27,295
Speaker 6:  And they got this ruling and you know, back in, in

324
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:28,095
Speaker 6:  2021

325
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:33,525
Speaker 6:  and it was, it was, it, it felt pretty narrow and it, and it was kind of

326
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,645
Speaker 6:  open-ended. It was just right. You have to allow links and buttons. You have

327
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:40,565
Speaker 6:  to allow them to go to the web. You can still charge if you want to. You

328
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:42,845
Speaker 6:  just have to, to do it in a, in a reasonable way.

329
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:47,260
Speaker 6:  And so Apple sat down and they went, okay, how are we gonna comply with this?

330
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:51,085
Speaker 6:  And they kept looking at options and basically each time they would look

331
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:54,925
Speaker 6:  at something as the judge kind of paints the picture,

332
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:59,125
Speaker 6:  they, they often had this sort of like Goldilocks array, right? There was

333
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,365
Speaker 6:  the, Hey, let's do the great version of this where developers love it and

334
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:06,285
Speaker 6:  you know, it really hurts us. Let's do the middle option where we do a

335
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:09,965
Speaker 6:  little bit of, of restriction or let's just go all out and, and make sure

336
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:13,045
Speaker 6:  that devs don't get too much here and we protect our, our profit.

337
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:18,165
Speaker 6:  And so, you know, first they, they go, okay, what,

338
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:21,365
Speaker 6:  what percentage cut do we wanna take on the web? Should we do no cut? Should

339
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,685
Speaker 6:  we do a little sum? Should we do something else? And they're like, no, no,

340
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:27,045
Speaker 6:  no, we should do, we should do it. We should take a cut. What cut Should

341
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,965
Speaker 6:  it be some, you know, Phil Schiller's, like, I don't think we should do a

342
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:31,365
Speaker 6:  cut at all.

343
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:36,995
Speaker 6:  Tim, Tim Cook goes, eh, 20%, 27%, let's do 27%.

344
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:39,355
Speaker 6:  How do they get to 27%? Eh, they just invented,

345
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:44,155
Speaker 6:  you know, how, how should these links and buttons look? Should they be rich

346
00:21:44,155 --> 00:21:47,955
Speaker 6:  buttons that, that are clearly buttons? No, they should be text links

347
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:52,235
Speaker 6:  because we don't, we don't look ugly. Should there be a a, a screen

348
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:55,195
Speaker 6:  to notify you that you're going out to the web, oh, we should make sure it's

349
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:57,915
Speaker 6:  a big giant popup that takes over the whole screen. And so every single time

350
00:21:57,935 --> 00:22:01,435
Speaker 6:  the judge looks at and goes, they ha they internally

351
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:06,235
Speaker 6:  discussed options that were not so bad and

352
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:09,915
Speaker 6:  then they chose the worst option. And I think there's this thing that happened

353
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:13,715
Speaker 6:  where they had some leeway, they could have put some

354
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:17,315
Speaker 6:  restrictions in place, they could have done a fee, they could have done a

355
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:20,995
Speaker 6:  big pop-up. But I think when they chose the worst option

356
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:25,075
Speaker 6:  every time the judge just goes, sorry, all all

357
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:28,995
Speaker 6:  you've done is maintain the status quo. I said that this

358
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:31,435
Speaker 6:  is anti-competitive. You can't just

359
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:35,795
Speaker 6:  continue to be anti-competitive. That's exactly what the injunction says

360
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:39,475
Speaker 6:  to do. And when she gets to the end of this, she, she's just like

361
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:42,155
Speaker 6:  utterly put out and just saying, I don't think there's any

362
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:46,435
Speaker 6:  reasonable world in which Apple believed it was actually

363
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,635
Speaker 6:  complying with the injunction I put down.

364
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:52,715
Speaker 5:  So there's another term to this. The the anger is

365
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:56,715
Speaker 5:  doubled, tripled, quadrupled because there was

366
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,315
Speaker 5:  a first hearing about compliance and Apple showed up

367
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:04,955
Speaker 5:  and lied to the judge and said, we commissioned this report that says

368
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:08,435
Speaker 5:  here's how much value we provide and this is why it's these rates.

369
00:23:09,135 --> 00:23:12,235
Speaker 5:  And they add an executive, a VP of finance come on in it and say all these

370
00:23:12,235 --> 00:23:15,795
Speaker 5:  words about when the decisions were made. And the judge didn't buy it in

371
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:19,755
Speaker 5:  the room at that time. And she sent them away and she ordered document

372
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:22,515
Speaker 5:  production. She got all their emails and all their slacks, all their meeting

373
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:26,075
Speaker 5:  notes and said, we're gonna have another hearing to find out what you are

374
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:29,635
Speaker 5:  doing in real time to see if what you are saying to me is true.

375
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:34,055
Speaker 5:  And so all of this stuff that we have, Jake wrote it through,

376
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:38,215
Speaker 5:  It is just a story. The judge wrote a story in her opinion and we just,

377
00:23:38,245 --> 00:23:40,975
Speaker 5:  Jake just translated it from legalese to like human,

378
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:45,970
Speaker 5:  it's just a story about Apple having these meetings backed up by notes.

379
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:50,565
Speaker 5:  It it, at moments Apple engineers and PMs and designers are

380
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:54,565
Speaker 5:  literally discussing how to make the language scarier because the

381
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:58,445
Speaker 5:  execs will like it better. Like that is a literal phrase that we have from

382
00:23:58,445 --> 00:23:59,125
Speaker 5:  their slacks. And

383
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,325
Speaker 7:  Then an Apple executive showed up in court and tried to argue that Yeah,

384
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:05,965
Speaker 7:  in design terms, scary doesn't mean what you think it does. Yeah.

385
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:06,645
Speaker 5:  It's a term of art.

386
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:09,005
Speaker 7:  Judge Roger's just like, no, it's

387
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:12,085
Speaker 5:  Not, this is all designers are like, scary it up a little bit. Yeah,

388
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:12,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

389
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:13,965
Speaker 7:  People say that all the time.

390
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:17,085
Speaker 5:  Jake, what did the judge say? It strains in credulity or something. Oh,

391
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:20,245
Speaker 6:  Oh. She, she, she said it, it strains common sense.

392
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:25,245
Speaker 6:  She's like, like absolutely. Like come on, I cannot believe you

393
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:28,765
Speaker 6:  are lying about scary having a specialized meaning.

394
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:32,805
Speaker 6:  Like you want, you want it to be a scary message. They kept adding scarier

395
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:37,045
Speaker 6:  language. So at the end of it, Tim Cook looked at it and was like, we need

396
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:40,605
Speaker 6:  to add some more. Like they all just wanted the, this is,

397
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:44,125
Speaker 6:  we're talking about the full screen popup that appears when you click a web

398
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,965
Speaker 6:  link that that is this big warning that you're leaving, that leaving the

399
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:50,605
Speaker 6:  app. It's like they, they had an option that was just a little popup that

400
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:54,285
Speaker 6:  said, Hey, you're opening Safari. And they're like, no, like giant

401
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,885
Speaker 6:  paragraph of text. Yeah. Yeah.

402
00:24:57,545 --> 00:25:00,845
Speaker 7:  And, and just neli to finish what you, you were just saying the, the thing

403
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:04,285
Speaker 7:  that they discovered after getting all of this documentation was that this

404
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:08,165
Speaker 7:  study that Apple had commissioned basically saying here's why we're worth

405
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:11,765
Speaker 7:  30% that they said they then made all of their decisions about actually came

406
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:14,685
Speaker 7:  at the end of all of this process. Yeah. Where Apple had spent months and

407
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:18,365
Speaker 7:  years debating what to do here and then gave

408
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:21,645
Speaker 7:  themselves data at the end to justify all the decisions they had already

409
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:21,845
Speaker 7:  made

410
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:23,165
Speaker 5:  And then showed up in court and lied about it.

411
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:26,845
Speaker 6:  Right? Well, and this was a particularly big deal because the last time around

412
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,885
Speaker 6:  the judge had said, Hey, okay, you can charge a commission

413
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:34,085
Speaker 6:  for stuff outside the app store. It just has to be based on something.

414
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:37,605
Speaker 6:  And so in this ruling, she's going,

415
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:42,555
Speaker 6:  what is this based on? You had the opportunity to value your technology

416
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:46,675
Speaker 6:  to figure out what it was worth and you just didn't do any of that. You

417
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:49,795
Speaker 6:  decided on a number and then worked back to, to get up to that number.

418
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,155
Speaker 5:  And that was a big out, I think she even calls it an out in the ruling. Yeah.

419
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:56,835
Speaker 5:  This is a big out for Apple, right? It's not everyone gets to put their

420
00:25:56,835 --> 00:26:00,675
Speaker 5:  buttons in and not pay you any money. It's, we understand the court

421
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:04,275
Speaker 5:  understands that you spend a lot of money developing iOS in the iPhone app

422
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:08,075
Speaker 5:  developers, you, it's fair to expect them to pay you for that work in some

423
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:11,315
Speaker 5:  way. Figure it out, figure out the formula that's fair.

424
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:15,795
Speaker 5:  So that developers can make good decisions and they're, it feels

425
00:26:15,795 --> 00:26:19,195
Speaker 5:  like they participate in a market and Apple picked a bunch of numbers that

426
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:22,835
Speaker 5:  basically made it impossible for developers to leave an app purchasing, right?

427
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:26,635
Speaker 5:  Instead of 30, they picked 27%. And every developer, it's in this record

428
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:30,435
Speaker 5:  as well, says, well, Stripe is gonna cost us more than 3%. Yep.

429
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:33,715
Speaker 5:  So this is just not worth it to us. And Josh says, well, that's just not

430
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:37,595
Speaker 5:  right. Like you just picked a number because it sounded good

431
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,195
Speaker 5:  and you know that developers aren't gonna leave. Like here's all this evidence

432
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:44,365
Speaker 5:  of these executives talking about how developers won't leave. The only person,

433
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:47,005
Speaker 5:  by the way, who comes off looking good in this entire sequence of events.

434
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:47,845
Speaker 5:  Phil Schiller.

435
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:51,765
Speaker 7:  Phil Schiller. Yeah. Kudos to Phil who was, who was the one saying we

436
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:53,005
Speaker 7:  should not take commissions and fees.

437
00:26:53,185 --> 00:26:55,805
Speaker 5:  You know, Phil ran the app store for years. I think he's still, he, you know,

438
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:59,285
Speaker 5:  he has like some emeritus role at Apple now. I think he still plays a, a

439
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:03,085
Speaker 5:  very active role in the app store. Oh yeah. He's the one who talks to developers

440
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:07,515
Speaker 5:  like he is the face of that organization to

441
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:11,435
Speaker 5:  developers. He, I, you know, he used to work with Steve Jobs

442
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:15,235
Speaker 5:  very closely. I think he was there in like the power book years when Apple

443
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:19,035
Speaker 5:  was not a behemoth. I think he knows what it's like to be the underdog and

444
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:22,555
Speaker 5:  need those developers to do what you want them to do instead of

445
00:27:22,555 --> 00:27:25,955
Speaker 5:  punishing them to do what you want them to do, which is what you can do when

446
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:29,595
Speaker 5:  you're very powerful. And at every turn he is like, well, what if we do the

447
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:32,995
Speaker 5:  right thing? And Luca matri apple's, CFO is like,

448
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:37,035
Speaker 5:  what if we just charge them all the money we can And Tim Cook is picking

449
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:40,715
Speaker 5:  the finance team. Yep. Literally the words Cook chose poorly

450
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:45,115
Speaker 5:  are in this decision. And I, I, look, we have a lot of people

451
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:48,355
Speaker 5:  listening to us. We're, this isn't, we're not interpreting the decision.

452
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:53,205
Speaker 5:  This is the judge saying it as clearly as she can. This

453
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:57,035
Speaker 5:  is over. I have made these findings a fact. This is what

454
00:27:57,315 --> 00:28:00,955
Speaker 5:  happened and this is what Apple has to do Now, no more excuses

455
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,675
Speaker 5:  actually at the very end, I think the last line of the ruling is there will

456
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:08,635
Speaker 5:  not be another bite at the apple, which you can just see her just hit and

457
00:28:08,635 --> 00:28:10,435
Speaker 5:  return at the end of that one and be like, bang,

458
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:13,835
Speaker 7:  Take it outta the typewriter, duck and tongue.

459
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:20,235
Speaker 5:  But yeah, there's something there where, look, I mean these are big

460
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:24,115
Speaker 5:  businesses. They have to print a bunch of money. Apple stock price affects

461
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:27,675
Speaker 5:  things like firefighter pensions in this country. Like these are massive

462
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:32,195
Speaker 5:  load bearing pillars of the American economy. They have a lot of people that

463
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:35,735
Speaker 5:  they're beholden to, but you can just see

464
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:39,935
Speaker 5:  that they picked the, the finances over the

465
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:43,625
Speaker 5:  product over and over again. And if they had just figured out a way

466
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:47,585
Speaker 5:  to make in-app purchases worth more to developers than

467
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:51,395
Speaker 5:  leaving the ecosystem, they pro developers, I think would've picked

468
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,495
Speaker 5:  in-app purchases every single time. It's just easier.

469
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:59,095
Speaker 5:  And they didn't, they instead they, they punished the the ability to compete,

470
00:28:59,145 --> 00:29:02,015
Speaker 7:  Right? I mean that, that's what we've been hearing from developers for years,

471
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:05,935
Speaker 7:  right? And that's, that's what Apple knew when it went from 30 to 27%, right?

472
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:09,655
Speaker 7:  Is even if, even if it was a reasonable

473
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:13,455
Speaker 7:  financial gain for those developers, which it wasn't because of like payment

474
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:17,175
Speaker 7:  processing fees, the convenience kills it, right? Like

475
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:20,695
Speaker 7:  the most people I have talked to over the years have always said,

476
00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:24,855
Speaker 7:  I'm happy to play by the platform rules as a tiebreaker just because it's

477
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:28,215
Speaker 7:  simpler. It makes building my app simpler. It's easier for users who have

478
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:31,935
Speaker 7:  to click fewer buttons to subscribe like it when it works financially,

479
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:35,695
Speaker 7:  It is the better option. And so if Apple had just found a way to make itself

480
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:39,255
Speaker 7:  a tiebreaker, it would've won and instead it way overshot.

481
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:42,645
Speaker 7:  And so Judge Gonzalez Rogers just basically blew the whole thing up.

482
00:29:42,795 --> 00:29:46,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So just to sum up her ruling, and it's just literally she says to

483
00:29:46,805 --> 00:29:50,005
Speaker 5:  summarize, the court found that Apple's 30% commission allowed it to reap

484
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:53,565
Speaker 5:  super competitive operating margins was not tied to the value of its intellectual

485
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:57,165
Speaker 5:  property and was less anti-competitive. Apple's response was to charge a

486
00:29:57,165 --> 00:30:00,845
Speaker 5:  27% commission, again, tied to nothing on off app

487
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:03,845
Speaker 5:  purchases where it had previously charged nothing and extend the commission

488
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:07,645
Speaker 5:  for a period of seven days after the consumer had left the app. So if you

489
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:10,325
Speaker 5:  left the app in a link and then bought something on that website, seven days

490
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:14,245
Speaker 5:  later you still owed Apple money, which is nuts. Apple's goal

491
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,925
Speaker 5:  was to maintain its anti-competitive revenue stream. The

492
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:21,205
Speaker 5:  court prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate

493
00:30:21,205 --> 00:30:24,725
Speaker 5:  with and direct consumers to other purchasing mechanisms. Apple's response

494
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:27,685
Speaker 5:  was to impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and

495
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:31,725
Speaker 5:  increase breakage rates with full page scare screens, static URLs and

496
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:35,045
Speaker 5:  generic statements. The goal was to dissuade customer usage of alternative

497
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:38,965
Speaker 5:  purchasing opportunities and maintain its anti-competitive revenue stream.

498
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:43,045
Speaker 5:  In the end, apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct

499
00:30:43,165 --> 00:30:46,925
Speaker 5:  defiance of the court's injunction. This is bad. That's just bad. Brutal.

500
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:50,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And again, this is not, apple says it will appeal, but

501
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,995
Speaker 5:  this is not gonna be the same kind of appeal. Like, but in the

502
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:59,235
Speaker 7:  Meantime also the, the other thing is, and, and this is the flip side of

503
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:02,435
Speaker 7:  what happened before is Apple did nothing for a long time because they didn't

504
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:06,275
Speaker 7:  have to. Now it has to do something like, the thing that is going to

505
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:09,995
Speaker 7:  change quickly is that developers are going to start

506
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:14,115
Speaker 7:  updating their apps with loud aggressive ways for you to pay for the

507
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:17,835
Speaker 7:  app outside of the app store because they can now, like even, even

508
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:21,355
Speaker 7:  under the provisions before there were all kinds of wacky things, right?

509
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:24,915
Speaker 7:  You could, you could have one link. It wasn't allowed to be in the normal

510
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:28,315
Speaker 7:  in-app purchase flow, it had to be somewhere else in the app, which was in

511
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:31,555
Speaker 7:  like, it was all designed, it was just, just shenanigans all the way down.

512
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:32,275
Speaker 7:  And now

513
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:37,215
Speaker 7:  by the rules of this ruling, I can open up my app and the very first thing

514
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:40,215
Speaker 7:  it shows me is a link to go subscribe somewhere on the web. Yeah. It can't,

515
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:44,335
Speaker 7:  I can't pay in a button in the app is

516
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:48,255
Speaker 7:  the one difference, right? Like it's still, it can send me to i a

517
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:52,095
Speaker 7:  website that takes Apple Pay, but it can't take Apple Pay right there.

518
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:52,775
Speaker 7:  I

519
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:55,935
Speaker 5:  We're gonna find out because we're gonna find out, this is what I was saying

520
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:59,615
Speaker 5:  about being right four years ago. Four years ago, the injunction was Apple

521
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:02,575
Speaker 5:  can't prohibit developers from using buttons and external links.

522
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:07,975
Speaker 5:  The difference between a button and an external link exists only in

523
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:12,255
Speaker 5:  our shared metaphysical reality. Sure. Like Right.

524
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:15,295
Speaker 5:  We all just decide that as a, as a family, what the, the difference between

525
00:32:15,295 --> 00:32:19,135
Speaker 5:  those two things are. And like in this ruling there

526
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:23,055
Speaker 5:  are literal pictures of buttons and links that the court thinks

527
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:26,175
Speaker 5:  are competitive and aren't competitive. And Apple every time

528
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:30,695
Speaker 5:  chooses the least competitive one. Yeah. It defines button

529
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:35,415
Speaker 5:  all the way down to a piece of plain text with

530
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:37,375
Speaker 5:  a little, you know, that little box with the arrow

531
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:38,735
Speaker 7:  That's a button

532
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,455
Speaker 5:  Indicates you're, you're about to go. They're like, that's the, that's a

533
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:45,135
Speaker 5:  button. You can have that button and the court's like that's not a button.

534
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:48,815
Speaker 5:  And apple's like, isn't it though? And that's where we're at, right? And

535
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:51,335
Speaker 5:  so what my headline four years ago is The future of the App Store depends

536
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:54,215
Speaker 5:  on the difference between a button and a link. Like Apple pushed back on

537
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:57,775
Speaker 5:  that hark, they're like, we everyone knows. And then for four years

538
00:32:58,115 --> 00:33:01,455
Speaker 5:  it spent time trying to convince the court that these shitty button, these

539
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:04,655
Speaker 5:  shitty links were actually buttons. This is a real thing that happened in

540
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:08,175
Speaker 5:  our nation's court system. And the judge eventually got tired of this and

541
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:12,055
Speaker 5:  said not. And now she said, look, we're, we're not arguing buttons

542
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:15,615
Speaker 5:  and links anymore here. Here's what I'm saying. To make up for all of your

543
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:19,615
Speaker 5:  bad behavior. You are no longer allowed to impose any commission or any

544
00:33:19,675 --> 00:33:23,375
Speaker 5:  fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app. And

545
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:27,415
Speaker 5:  that means you have no reason to audit, monitor, track, or require developers

546
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:30,535
Speaker 5:  to report any purchases or any activities that consumers make outside the

547
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:34,195
Speaker 5:  app. So Apple had this ability before, but they acted badly. So the course

548
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:37,315
Speaker 5:  says, Nope, that's gone. I'm just taking it off the table. They're no longer,

549
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:41,395
Speaker 5:  Apple's no longer allowed to restrict or condition developer style language

550
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:44,515
Speaker 5:  formatting, quantity flow or placement of links for purchases outside an

551
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:47,875
Speaker 5:  app. So anything, any quality of a link is now off the table.

552
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:50,075
Speaker 7:  Those two things right there are the whole ball game.

553
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,515
Speaker 5:  It's the game that's the app store that

554
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:54,835
Speaker 7:  Is Apple going from what it wanted to the

555
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:58,955
Speaker 7:  180 degree, not what it wanted. Like this is the worst

556
00:33:58,955 --> 00:33:59,835
Speaker 7:  case Apple scenario.

557
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:03,555
Speaker 5:  Apple also prohibited from prohibiting or limiting the use of buttons or

558
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:06,715
Speaker 5:  other calls to action or otherwise conditioning the content style, language

559
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:10,035
Speaker 5:  formatting, float or placement of these devices for purchases outside an

560
00:34:10,035 --> 00:34:13,755
Speaker 5:  app so that you can style the buttons any way you want now. So now the difference

561
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:15,795
Speaker 5:  between a button and link does, it doesn't matter. You can style 'em both

562
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:16,595
Speaker 5:  any way you want. She

563
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:19,755
Speaker 7:  Had a different bullet for links and buttons. She knows what she's doing.

564
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:20,995
Speaker 7:  Josh has figured this out

565
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:22,515
Speaker 5:  When I say this as a VERGE story,

566
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:27,395
Speaker 5:  They're not allowed to exclude categories and developers and apps

567
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,795
Speaker 5:  from obtaining the link provisions, which they were going to do, right?

568
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:35,275
Speaker 5:  They were going to say games in particular had to keep paying the money.

569
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,795
Speaker 5:  All those Candy Crush whales are about to get a, you know, 30% discount.

570
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:43,355
Speaker 5:  They're not allowed to interfere with the consumer's choice to proceed in

571
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:46,875
Speaker 5:  or out of an app by anything other than a neutral message arising users.

572
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:50,275
Speaker 5:  They're going to a third party site. So no more scary language and they're

573
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:53,595
Speaker 5:  not allowed to restrict the developer's use of dynamic links that bring customers

574
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:57,395
Speaker 5:  to a specific product page in a logged in state rather than just

575
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,715
Speaker 5:  requiring static links that make customers have to log in again.

576
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:06,315
Speaker 5:  Again, this is very virgie, right? Apple was saying you can only have

577
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:09,755
Speaker 5:  static links, so you couldn't carry login tokens through the links.

578
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:13,795
Speaker 5:  So you would land on, you know, netflix.com, but it wouldn't know that you

579
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:16,475
Speaker 5:  were logged into the Netflix app. You'd have to log in again to get your

580
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:20,435
Speaker 5:  discount. Apple knows this is friction. So the judge says, no, I'm all the

581
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:23,715
Speaker 5:  way to mandating the use of

582
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:28,195
Speaker 5:  dynamically generated links in apps so developers can pass

583
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:32,075
Speaker 5:  login states. That's, this is the ballgame. To your point, David, this is

584
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:35,755
Speaker 5:  the whole game. It's the whole game. They got Apple lost its revenue stream

585
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:39,415
Speaker 5:  in the app store in-app purchase revenue is gone, is

586
00:35:39,425 --> 00:35:43,195
Speaker 5:  going to go down. If they'd played ball, they could have

587
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:44,555
Speaker 5:  maintained a healthy chunk of it.

588
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:48,795
Speaker 6:  One thing that I don't know if anybody has looked at in like 15 years or

589
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:52,715
Speaker 6:  however long the app store has existed, what does it actually look like for

590
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,155
Speaker 6:  Apple to compete with web

591
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:54,675
Speaker 7:  Purchases?

592
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:59,555
Speaker 6:  What does it do? What changes now if they, if they have to contend with

593
00:35:59,555 --> 00:35:59,635
Speaker 6:  this?

594
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:02,275
Speaker 5:  I mean, I can think of a million things off off just off the top of my head

595
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:07,235
Speaker 5:  app. If you buy everything in the app store or the Apple system,

596
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:10,715
Speaker 5:  you have a catalog in one place of everything that you bought. You have a

597
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:14,155
Speaker 5:  catalog of every subscription that you have. You can cancel those subscriptions.

598
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:17,755
Speaker 5:  You can manage your purchases. Maybe you can transfer purchases to someone

599
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:21,515
Speaker 5:  else because there's a shared centrally maintained database of who owns what.

600
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:24,835
Speaker 5:  You don't need a blockchain for that if you just trust Tim Cook to run that

601
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:28,875
Speaker 5:  database. Like there's a million things you can do if you

602
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:32,715
Speaker 5:  are the central transaction provider that Apple has not had to do or not

603
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:36,075
Speaker 5:  even been pushed to do because you can't buy anything anywhere else.

604
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:40,525
Speaker 5:  And so the only thing you can offer outside is it's a little

605
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:43,845
Speaker 5:  bit cheaper than you're terrified of that. But if you say to customers,

606
00:36:44,595 --> 00:36:47,685
Speaker 5:  protect your purchase with by buying it with Apple, it will cost a dollar

607
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:51,165
Speaker 5:  more. But here's all these services you get for that dollar. Like maybe that'll

608
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:54,535
Speaker 5:  work. It's also easier. You don't have to, you don't have to do anything

609
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:58,235
Speaker 5:  else. You're just like, push this button. But I I don't, they haven't had

610
00:36:58,235 --> 00:36:58,915
Speaker 5:  to have these ideas.

611
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,155
Speaker 7:  Right? I mean, I, the other thing I think is gonna be interesting here is

612
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:06,035
Speaker 7:  we're gonna see a lot of different ideas about how to

613
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:09,555
Speaker 7:  solve some of this friction. I mean, it's not, it's not not

614
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:13,515
Speaker 7:  ironic that the simplest way to pay for things on the web is Apple Pay.

615
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:18,635
Speaker 7:  And, and in many ways what is going to happen here is people are going to

616
00:37:18,785 --> 00:37:22,235
Speaker 7:  punt from a thing that gives Apple a huge commission to a thing that gives

617
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:26,195
Speaker 7:  Apple a small commission. And that's fine. But we're also seeing

618
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:29,995
Speaker 7:  pretty quickly any company that collects payments is going to

619
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:34,195
Speaker 7:  try to find a very quick way to collect payments on the

620
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:37,035
Speaker 7:  web for your app subscription like this. This is going to become a really

621
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:41,235
Speaker 7:  interesting competitive business. Like Stripe is out here already

622
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:44,355
Speaker 7:  promoting stuff that it's doing. Patreon has big ideas about what it's gonna

623
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:47,845
Speaker 7:  do. Like the, the quick internet

624
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:51,725
Speaker 7:  transaction market has never had to be interesting in this space because

625
00:37:51,725 --> 00:37:55,165
Speaker 7:  there hasn't been a reason to do it. And so not only is Apple gonna have

626
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:57,365
Speaker 7:  to figure out how to compete, all these other companies are gonna have a

627
00:37:57,365 --> 00:38:00,885
Speaker 7:  chance to figure out how to compete. And I think that to me is where a lot

628
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:04,765
Speaker 7:  of this stuff gets super interesting. It is like Netflix is just

629
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:08,365
Speaker 7:  gonna want me to input my credit card number, right? But in a, in a fair

630
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:12,325
Speaker 7:  fight against in-app purchases where they are now at

631
00:38:12,345 --> 00:38:15,445
Speaker 7:  the same price because they can be, because Netflix doesn't have to pay 30%.

632
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:19,245
Speaker 7:  There's actually fascinating competition to see who can give me the most,

633
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:22,085
Speaker 7:  to be the one where I put in my credit card details,

634
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:26,315
Speaker 5:  The thing that gets me at that, which I, I was not expecting this

635
00:38:26,315 --> 00:38:30,195
Speaker 5:  outcome. I knew there would be a fight about buttons and links. I just

636
00:38:30,195 --> 00:38:31,795
Speaker 5:  wanna call, I wanna point this out. Yeah,

637
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:32,635
Speaker 7:  We're all very proud of you.

638
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:35,685
Speaker 5:  I'm very proud. If you're not proud of yourself, yourself, if you don't love

639
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:39,165
Speaker 5:  yourself, you know no one else can, can love you back. Is that true?

640
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:43,035
Speaker 7:  Let's go down that rabbit hole for a while. Should we talk about this for

641
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:43,155
Speaker 7:  a

642
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:46,435
Speaker 5:  Minute? Is that just a Coldplay lyric? I'm not a hundred percent sure. All

643
00:38:46,435 --> 00:38:50,035
Speaker 5:  right. It's a weird time in America. I'm coursing with emotions.

644
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:55,975
Speaker 5:  This outcome from, you know, our standpoint

645
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:59,975
Speaker 5:  is consumers is the best outcome because instead of

646
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:04,535
Speaker 5:  we will force the app store to compete head up against an entire

647
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:08,335
Speaker 5:  other app store that's different rules and weirdo experiences

648
00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:11,655
Speaker 5:  and you know, all this other stuff you're worried about. It's actually just

649
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:15,055
Speaker 5:  everything's gonna get cheaper in the same app store that you loved today.

650
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:19,605
Speaker 5:  That Apple could have solved this so long ago.

651
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:24,165
Speaker 5:  Like that. It's nuts that we're talking about like alt store in Europe

652
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,925
Speaker 5:  and how Epic might do Epic game store and we are having these pitched antitrust

653
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:31,905
Speaker 5:  battles and you gotta get all the way to like, can you construct

654
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:35,865
Speaker 5:  a legal argument using the existing consumer welfare standard to prove that

655
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:39,625
Speaker 5:  Apple has a monopoly on its own platform. And at the end of the day, they

656
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:42,745
Speaker 5:  just screwed it up and they got to the result that I think most developers

657
00:39:42,745 --> 00:39:46,705
Speaker 5:  wanted, which is we're still gonna rely on the app store for discovery for

658
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:50,975
Speaker 5:  distribution, and now we can just collect more

659
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:54,575
Speaker 5:  margin from the things people buy in our apps with alternative payments.

660
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:55,015
Speaker 5:  Or

661
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:58,375
Speaker 7:  There's another version of the upside here, which is now all of a sudden

662
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:01,415
Speaker 7:  there's a stuff that if you're a developer, you can put into

663
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:06,495
Speaker 7:  the app store as in app purchases, if this forces Apple to

664
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:11,285
Speaker 7:  be more competitive on that front too, right? Like step one is everybody

665
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:14,525
Speaker 7:  just goes and buys stuff elsewhere. But like the best case scenario is there

666
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:18,125
Speaker 7:  is a step two where Apple is forced by that to be more competitive and play

667
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:21,925
Speaker 7:  ball within app purchases so that you can start to do things like buy Kindle

668
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:25,845
Speaker 7:  books in the app store again. And there, like we, we've talked a lot

669
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:29,245
Speaker 7:  over the years on the show about all the kinds of things that you can't do

670
00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:32,645
Speaker 7:  in the app store because it's not a 30% margin business. And

671
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:36,645
Speaker 7:  things like, things like books and audiobook are like right there on that.

672
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:40,445
Speaker 7:  And so we've made the experience awful. And so if this works and becomes

673
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:44,525
Speaker 7:  actually competitive, it, it actually turns back towards making the app

674
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,445
Speaker 7:  store version of everything better. I'm not counting on

675
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,285
Speaker 7:  that because Apple will appeal to death before it allows that to happen.

676
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:55,645
Speaker 7:  But like the, the tie here should be good for

677
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:59,245
Speaker 7:  both sides and ultimately for however you want to use the app, it should

678
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:01,965
Speaker 7:  be better when these fees start to fall apart.

679
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:06,165
Speaker 5:  I'm glad that you have a, a good and kind heart because you went to,

680
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:10,085
Speaker 5:  people will buy art and culture more easily and I went to, oh fuck,

681
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:11,005
Speaker 5:  the NFTs are coming.

682
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:16,165
Speaker 5:  What can't you buy in the, what can't you buy in an app right now? Well,

683
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:18,925
Speaker 5:  you know what definitely isn't a 30% business NFT,

684
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,485
Speaker 5:  there's 30% of nothing is what? So

685
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:27,765
Speaker 5:  we'll see what happens. There's that. But I, we I I do think we're gonna

686
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:29,205
Speaker 5:  see a new kind of competition here.

687
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:34,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's and the, the joy in the developer community.

688
00:41:34,985 --> 00:41:38,845
Speaker 7:  Yes, It is unreal. I mean it, it truly is. Like we've just gotten

689
00:41:39,305 --> 00:41:42,485
Speaker 7:  an outpouring and Jake, I think you've seen more of these than I have even

690
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:46,765
Speaker 7:  over the last several hours as this has been happening of just the grand

691
00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:50,165
Speaker 7:  enthusiasm from people who are like, oh my God, finally the day has come,

692
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:51,965
Speaker 7:  we can play in the app store again.

693
00:41:52,155 --> 00:41:56,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Developers are usually pretty wary about criticizing Apple.

694
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,845
Speaker 6:  And here everybody's just like, got it, let's go. We're ready. We've been

695
00:41:59,845 --> 00:42:02,605
Speaker 6:  waiting for this. Like we, we have the product ready, we're submitting it,

696
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:03,925
Speaker 6:  like it, people are ready to go.

697
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:07,685
Speaker 7:  There was one Ryan Jones who's the developer of an app called Flay that are

698
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:11,605
Speaker 7:  really like, it's, I always follow flighty because they're always

699
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:14,045
Speaker 7:  at the forefront of like interesting Apple features. Like whenever Apple

700
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:17,285
Speaker 7:  releases anything flighty is there. I'm like, cool, great job. Flighty

701
00:42:18,265 --> 00:42:21,405
Speaker 7:  and Ryan Jones, who, who runs the app tweeted. So what's gonna happen starting

702
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:25,205
Speaker 7:  tomorrow? Apps in the US will have save 20% with Apple Pay type buttons right

703
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:29,165
Speaker 7:  next to normal buttons, or better yet only have the link out button on the

704
00:42:29,165 --> 00:42:32,765
Speaker 7:  paywall. Apple specifically cannot limit anything about the buttons. That's

705
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:36,405
Speaker 7:  something I had not even thought of that ev people might just bypass the

706
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:39,845
Speaker 7:  idea of in-app purchases entirely. And when you hit the subscribe button,

707
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:42,845
Speaker 7:  it might just take you to the web, which is a thing

708
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:47,465
Speaker 7:  everyone is familiar with. And suddenly, so like not only do I have to compete

709
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:50,065
Speaker 7:  within app purchases, I might be able to do away with them entirely.

710
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,665
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then, and then you're still completing it in the Apple ecosystem

711
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:55,505
Speaker 5:  with Apple Pay for a much lower fee.

712
00:42:55,915 --> 00:42:56,265
Speaker 7:  Right.

713
00:42:56,685 --> 00:42:59,545
Speaker 5:  The thing that I think is gonna be really fascinating is it's developers

714
00:42:59,605 --> 00:43:03,155
Speaker 5:  do this quickly enough and everything gets cheaper and more

715
00:43:03,155 --> 00:43:06,155
Speaker 5:  competitive or more vibrant and there's all this excitement in developer

716
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:09,965
Speaker 5:  community and then Apple Appeals and starts fighting to

717
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:13,365
Speaker 5:  put the genie back in the bottle. It still might not matter if they win.

718
00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:18,065
Speaker 5:  'cause you can't, you can't be like, well we won this court case

719
00:43:18,885 --> 00:43:20,745
Speaker 5:  so everybody stop it. Go

720
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:21,785
Speaker 7:  Make your app worse. Yeah.

721
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,705
Speaker 5:  Like we will have run the AB test. They

722
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:25,705
Speaker 6:  Like that 30%.

723
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:30,225
Speaker 5:  Look, Todd Hazelton this morning woke up and was

724
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:33,145
Speaker 5:  like, oh, I gotta write this down. Like the amount of pressure on Apple is

725
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:36,825
Speaker 5:  out of control right now. So he we'll link that piece too. It's, It is really

726
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:40,025
Speaker 5:  good. But he just listed them. He's like, okay, tariffs, tariffs are gonna

727
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:43,745
Speaker 5:  increase the costs of every product and Apple has to figure out how to work

728
00:43:43,745 --> 00:43:47,345
Speaker 5:  that into its margin. The Google search remedies case, which we'll talk about

729
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:51,305
Speaker 5:  in a second here, might just take $20 billion off of Apple's bottom

730
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:55,225
Speaker 5:  line. And that's pure margin. Google just pays Apple $20 billion to be

731
00:43:55,225 --> 00:43:55,665
Speaker 5:  the default.

732
00:43:55,935 --> 00:43:56,225
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

733
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:59,465
Speaker 5:  It might just go away. That's the, that's one of the very real results of

734
00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:03,425
Speaker 5:  the case that is ongoing. And then the entire part of the

735
00:44:03,545 --> 00:44:07,265
Speaker 5:  business that's growing is services every quarter. Now it's services,

736
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:11,185
Speaker 5:  it's growing. It's not Apple TVs and, and MacBooks. It's not the

737
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:14,105
Speaker 5:  iPhone, it's not the iPad. It's services.

738
00:44:15,745 --> 00:44:19,125
Speaker 5:  What services? They don't wanna say it. They want you to think a severance.

739
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:19,965
Speaker 5:  It's not severance,

740
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:25,585
Speaker 5:  it's Candy Crush Whales. Yep. Apple's entire business has been

741
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:28,465
Speaker 5:  taking 30% of Candy Crush whales and that's been growing for years.

742
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:33,445
Speaker 5:  And so you, you're gonna take that too now. So you're gonna lose the 20 billion

743
00:44:33,445 --> 00:44:37,205
Speaker 5:  from Google, you're gonna lose the Candy Crush whale money. You're gonna

744
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:41,235
Speaker 5:  increase the margin pressure because of tariffs. Wow.

745
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:44,795
Speaker 5:  That whole business has changed. By the end of this year, the entire, all

746
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:48,735
Speaker 5:  of the fundamentals of Apple's business will be like flipped. And

747
00:44:48,735 --> 00:44:52,585
Speaker 5:  then what's the next turn that everyone's talking about? Whether you believe

748
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:56,375
Speaker 5:  in it or not, it's like ai, ai, ai, well they had to delay their AI

749
00:44:56,375 --> 00:45:00,045
Speaker 5:  project. Like this company is suddenly like real shaky.

750
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:04,615
Speaker 5:  And that's not to say the iPhone's bad, the thing that they do

751
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:08,255
Speaker 5:  is really good. It is still like the centerpiece of the modern tech economy,

752
00:45:08,835 --> 00:45:12,415
Speaker 5:  but you're just like, wow. All of the pieces of this puzzle just got real

753
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:16,415
Speaker 5:  frayed around the edges. Like what's gonna happen? How

754
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,855
Speaker 5:  do they recover from this? And I'm, I'm hopeful that there's

755
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:23,935
Speaker 5:  smart, creative, really interesting people who work at Apple that

756
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:27,735
Speaker 5:  they are finally forced to be creative and invent the next

757
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:31,255
Speaker 5:  turn as opposed to figuring out more and more, more ways to

758
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:32,895
Speaker 5:  extract dollars from the iPhone.

759
00:45:33,325 --> 00:45:36,495
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I mean, it, It is funny to watch this sort of rhyme with the Google

760
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:40,375
Speaker 7:  trial in that I, if you sort of boil it all the way

761
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:44,015
Speaker 7:  down like Apple found its version of Google

762
00:45:44,015 --> 00:45:47,895
Speaker 7:  search in the 30% commission, which is just essentially a

763
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:51,855
Speaker 7:  perpetual money machine, right? It is. If if you want to exist in

764
00:45:51,855 --> 00:45:55,575
Speaker 7:  the world, you have to give us money. That's, that's what Google did with

765
00:45:55,575 --> 00:45:58,055
Speaker 7:  the internet and that's what Apple did with mobile, right? And it, it, boy

766
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:01,775
Speaker 7:  did it work gangbusters, but is eventually, if, if you get someone who is

767
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:05,755
Speaker 7:  willing to peel that apart, it becomes really

768
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:09,715
Speaker 7:  hard to put back together. And like Google is, is furiously fighting to

769
00:46:09,855 --> 00:46:13,435
Speaker 7:  not have happened to it. Essentially what just happened to Apple, which is

770
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:16,995
Speaker 7:  a judge says absolutely not. Like you just can't do this thing anymore.

771
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:17,475
Speaker 7:  I

772
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:21,195
Speaker 6:  Am curious if Apple, you know, still tries to, to pull

773
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,755
Speaker 6:  something here. You know, the, the judge puts some pretty strict limits on

774
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:28,035
Speaker 6:  things, but Apple explored some other options, right? They were like, hey,

775
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,635
Speaker 6:  we could, we could charge people based on how many downloads their apps get.

776
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:33,435
Speaker 6:  That's one of the things that they pulled in Europe,

777
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,995
Speaker 5:  But they're not allowed to do it anymore.

778
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,915
Speaker 6:  They can't, they can't condition links on that. They could just charge people

779
00:46:40,105 --> 00:46:41,835
Speaker 6:  that would totally upend the app store model.

780
00:46:42,145 --> 00:46:44,395
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I think if you're Apple,

781
00:46:46,005 --> 00:46:47,505
Speaker 7:  that's pretty dangerous.

782
00:46:47,765 --> 00:46:50,385
Speaker 6:  You're probably fearing this ruling,

783
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:54,585
Speaker 7:  Which is the goal, right? Like Judge, judge Gonzalez Rogers here is, is very

784
00:46:54,585 --> 00:46:57,745
Speaker 7:  much attempting to strike the fear of God into this company. Like, if you

785
00:46:57,745 --> 00:47:01,665
Speaker 7:  cross me again, I will ruin you is pretty much the message

786
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:02,865
Speaker 7:  of this thing. It

787
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:04,185
Speaker 6:  It, it reads a little like that. Yeah.

788
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:08,665
Speaker 7:  I mean, it It is going, It is gonna be really interesting to see because

789
00:47:08,805 --> 00:47:12,505
Speaker 7:  I'm, I'm confident there have been meetings all day in Cupertino about

790
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:16,785
Speaker 7:  not, maybe not how to ignore this, but how to get around it. Like how do

791
00:47:16,785 --> 00:47:20,425
Speaker 7:  we keep getting our services revenue without this?

792
00:47:20,645 --> 00:47:23,385
Speaker 7:  And some of those meetings are about products and some of those will not

793
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:27,145
Speaker 7:  be about products, but, but like the, the, this ruling

794
00:47:27,855 --> 00:47:31,685
Speaker 7:  intentionally and in as many words opened the

795
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:35,125
Speaker 7:  floodgates for developers and It is basically like they, they get to do this

796
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,205
Speaker 7:  now and you can't stop them or it's illegal. Like

797
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:41,325
Speaker 5:  It also opened the floodgates for regulators. So

798
00:47:42,285 --> 00:47:46,005
Speaker 5:  I was talking to some antitrust people yesterday after the ruling hit and

799
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:51,595
Speaker 5:  a little bit of insight, maybe I can share that. But the overwhelming

800
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:55,315
Speaker 5:  feeling was like finally someone has called Apple out on their

801
00:47:55,315 --> 00:47:59,115
Speaker 5:  hubris. Mm. Apple, their rep around the world

802
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:02,485
Speaker 5:  when it comes to this stuff is how dare you

803
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:05,855
Speaker 5:  no Will will fight you till you die.

804
00:48:06,855 --> 00:48:10,545
Speaker 5:  Arrogance and hubris just absolutely like the comparison was made

805
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:13,945
Speaker 5:  specifically to Google and they're like, Google's pretty arrogant and noncompliant

806
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:17,625
Speaker 5:  as well, but at least they pretend that they're nice. Which tracks like totally

807
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:20,105
Speaker 5:  tracks. Yeah. Like Google's, like we make YouTube music

808
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:25,225
Speaker 5:  just a bunch of goofballs over here. Yeah. Apple's like, we make the iPhone

809
00:48:26,045 --> 00:48:29,955
Speaker 5:  and none of you will ever have taste like we have taste, so

810
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:33,915
Speaker 5:  please shut up. And like it just bit them in the ass here. Like they

811
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:37,555
Speaker 5:  didn't have to get to this position and now they're totally

812
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:38,075
Speaker 5:  constrained.

813
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:41,155
Speaker 7:  Well, and to that point, one of the things Apple has said over and over throughout

814
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:44,875
Speaker 7:  this whole process is, and every big tech company does this, is they, they

815
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:48,515
Speaker 7:  yell and scream about security and privacy, right? That if you do this,

816
00:48:48,855 --> 00:48:52,395
Speaker 7:  if you allow developers to put links in their apps,

817
00:48:52,855 --> 00:48:56,355
Speaker 7:  it it will devastate privacy on the internet. People will be opened up to

818
00:48:56,355 --> 00:49:00,195
Speaker 7:  fraud, everything will be horrible. And it all over

819
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:04,155
Speaker 7:  this ruling from Judge Al Rogers, it just says that is

820
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:07,835
Speaker 7:  a lie and that's not what you think. That is not how you feel. And I can

821
00:49:07,835 --> 00:49:11,075
Speaker 7:  prove it. Right. And that is like the, the stuff in this documents was you

822
00:49:11,075 --> 00:49:14,475
Speaker 7:  had a meeting about money and then you told a story about privacy and those

823
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:17,115
Speaker 7:  two things have nothing to do with each other. And I'm tired of hearing the

824
00:49:17,115 --> 00:49:20,395
Speaker 7:  privacy story because it's about money. And that is like,

825
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:24,915
Speaker 7:  we've all kind of known that, but it's, it, it's different to

826
00:49:24,915 --> 00:49:27,515
Speaker 7:  say it when you have the meeting minutes in front of you and it's like, oh,

827
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:30,955
Speaker 7:  you know what never came up in this meeting about whether it should be 27%

828
00:49:30,955 --> 00:49:34,595
Speaker 7:  or 30% user privacy. Turns out you don't actually care

829
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:38,435
Speaker 7:  except as a justification to the public who you hope don't really

830
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:39,715
Speaker 7:  understand what's going on.

831
00:49:40,055 --> 00:49:43,795
Speaker 5:  The thing that I heard specifically yesterday when I was talking to some

832
00:49:43,795 --> 00:49:47,715
Speaker 5:  folks was if the DOJ is smart, they will take this

833
00:49:47,715 --> 00:49:51,275
Speaker 5:  ruling and amend the complaint against Apple for

834
00:49:51,275 --> 00:49:55,195
Speaker 5:  antitrust to include a bunch of what you're saying, right. That you can take

835
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:57,955
Speaker 5:  your complaint and amend it. The complaint is basically the offense monopoly

836
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:01,915
Speaker 5:  and it Apple uses it to legally command all kinds of other

837
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,795
Speaker 5:  industries. And there's a laundry list of ways to do that.

838
00:50:05,905 --> 00:50:08,155
Speaker 5:  Well, if you're smart, now you have a bunch of evidence that says, oh, they

839
00:50:08,155 --> 00:50:11,195
Speaker 5:  super do that, and you're gonna, you're gonna amend your complaint to

840
00:50:11,195 --> 00:50:14,075
Speaker 7:  Put it and all of their defense again, which is about privacy and security

841
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,915
Speaker 7:  and taking the best care of users

842
00:50:17,535 --> 00:50:19,155
Speaker 7:  may not actually be what you're worried about.

843
00:50:19,455 --> 00:50:22,875
Speaker 5:  Yep. So these things begin to stack up, like the regulators around the world

844
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:26,195
Speaker 5:  are looking at this decision and they're looking at this judge saying, you

845
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:29,375
Speaker 5:  know, actually I can just body up and punch Tim Hook in the nose. And they're,

846
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:32,695
Speaker 5:  they're emboldened. Like the joke I keep I was making last night was like,

847
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:36,535
Speaker 5:  there are bells ringing in Paris. Like there's a bunch of happy gray suited

848
00:50:36,735 --> 00:50:37,975
Speaker 5:  European lawyers being like, finally

849
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:39,935
Speaker 6:  It's

850
00:50:39,935 --> 00:50:43,575
Speaker 5:  Like it's happened. Like someone has finally like punched, like landed a

851
00:50:43,575 --> 00:50:47,055
Speaker 5:  punch and it's because of Apple's attitude. And that is such an own goal.

852
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:48,215
Speaker 5:  Like they did not have to get here.

853
00:50:49,735 --> 00:50:52,875
Speaker 5:  That's a, we have a statement from Apple that says they disagree with the

854
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:56,745
Speaker 5:  judges' ruling. They're, they're going to appeal it. There's,

855
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:59,665
Speaker 5:  there's an amount of, even all the statements we're getting, the indie app

856
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:03,145
Speaker 5:  developers I think are very excited. The big companies like

857
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:07,095
Speaker 5:  Spotify and match groups that have been fighting this the loudest. A little

858
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:09,335
Speaker 5:  more measured, right? Like they're all

859
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:13,255
Speaker 7:  The, the proof is gonna be in the pudding, right? Like it's, it's, it's going

860
00:51:13,255 --> 00:51:16,575
Speaker 7:  to be the app updates. Like I, I sincerely believe the next

861
00:51:17,655 --> 00:51:21,455
Speaker 7:  14 days of app updates from all of these companies is gonna be fascinating

862
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:22,535
Speaker 7:  because you, so here's

863
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:25,535
Speaker 5:  The one that's gonna be the most fascinating. Tim Sweeney says Epic will

864
00:51:25,535 --> 00:51:28,055
Speaker 5:  put Fortnite back in iOS. Yep. How

865
00:51:28,615 --> 00:51:32,495
Speaker 7:  I was talking to j Peters about this earlier, like this, this suggests that

866
00:51:32,805 --> 00:51:36,735
Speaker 7:  Epic has been updating the Fortnite iOS app for years,

867
00:51:37,455 --> 00:51:40,975
Speaker 7:  waiting for this day. I'm serious. Like that is what has been going on is

868
00:51:40,975 --> 00:51:44,935
Speaker 7:  Epic has been waiting to win so that it can, it can victoriously

869
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,815
Speaker 7:  and ceremoniously reappear in the app store triumphant over

870
00:51:49,085 --> 00:51:52,935
Speaker 7:  Apple's monopoly and it's gonna work. And I

871
00:51:52,965 --> 00:51:55,695
Speaker 7:  like, I guarantee you every big app developer, wait,

872
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,695
Speaker 5:  No, how will it work? So the, the mechanics of this case, epic

873
00:51:59,345 --> 00:52:03,295
Speaker 5:  broke apple's rules by shipping a secret update to

874
00:52:03,515 --> 00:52:06,695
Speaker 5:  iOS Fortnite that allowed people to purchase stuff in Fortnite without an

875
00:52:06,695 --> 00:52:10,535
Speaker 5:  app purchases. Apple kicked him outta the store, said, you broke our

876
00:52:10,535 --> 00:52:14,335
Speaker 5:  rules. Epic said, aha, it was a troll. And they filed a lawsuit

877
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:18,015
Speaker 5:  they've gotten here where Apple's non-compliance with the injunction

878
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:22,215
Speaker 5:  has gotten Apple in a bunch of trouble. But Epic lost

879
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:25,495
Speaker 5:  on, did you willfully break the iOS developer agreement?

880
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:30,255
Speaker 5:  There's nothing in this ruling says Apple has to give Epic its

881
00:52:30,255 --> 00:52:34,065
Speaker 5:  developer account back. Like how are they gonna put it back in the

882
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:34,785
Speaker 7:  Stock? That's a good point.

883
00:52:35,725 --> 00:52:36,065
Speaker 6:  So I think

884
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:36,905
Speaker 5:  It's

885
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:39,985
Speaker 6:  Unclear. Do you have Fortnite ready? Because they, they brought it to the

886
00:52:40,145 --> 00:52:43,425
Speaker 6:  EU a couple months back. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause they,

887
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:46,985
Speaker 6:  they launched that big game tour. They had another battle with Apple over

888
00:52:47,745 --> 00:52:50,865
Speaker 6:  a developer account in the European Union, which Apple

889
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:55,305
Speaker 6:  briefly banned. So It is, it remains unclear to me

890
00:52:55,365 --> 00:52:58,785
Speaker 6:  it they have a developer account in the US

891
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:04,105
Speaker 6:  or if Apple is required to, to by any means, let

892
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:07,465
Speaker 6:  them have Fortnite on the store. I feel like Apple's allowed to just be like,

893
00:53:07,465 --> 00:53:09,505
Speaker 6:  eh, sorry guys. Like we're pretty pissed about this.

894
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:13,715
Speaker 5:  I will say Tim Sweeney put out what he calls a peace proposal, which

895
00:53:13,715 --> 00:53:14,995
Speaker 5:  is super not a peace proposal.

896
00:53:15,315 --> 00:53:16,555
Speaker 7:  No, it's just a nice, he says

897
00:53:16,555 --> 00:53:20,435
Speaker 5:  Epic puts forth a peace proposal. If Apple extends the court's friction

898
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:21,915
Speaker 5:  free Apple tax free framework

899
00:55:58,505 --> 00:56:01,365
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back now onto active litigation

900
00:56:03,755 --> 00:56:07,525
Speaker 5:  here, here on the America's favorite tech litigation podcast.

901
00:56:08,585 --> 00:56:10,835
Speaker 5:  Look, we open with party speakers to draw you in.

902
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:15,765
Speaker 7:  Yeah, if people would launch more gadgets, we would talk

903
00:56:15,765 --> 00:56:19,125
Speaker 7:  like could. It's, it's about to be developer conference and gadget season

904
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:22,045
Speaker 7:  again, and I'm very much looking forward to that. Wait, can I sidetrack you

905
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,060
Speaker 7:  because David, there was something you you wanted to talk about up front

906
00:56:24,665 --> 00:56:28,395
Speaker 7:  that we skipped over. Oh, you're right. So we, we could do a little

907
00:56:28,395 --> 00:56:31,755
Speaker 7:  intermission here. Let's, let's do a brief gadget like a cleanser. Yeah.

908
00:56:32,465 --> 00:56:36,275
Speaker 7:  Because I, I need to know Nila you in particular, but both of you.

909
00:56:36,535 --> 00:56:39,475
Speaker 7:  We gotta talk about the Slate truck for like five minutes because we talked

910
00:56:39,475 --> 00:56:43,355
Speaker 7:  about the Slate Truck with Tim Stevens on Tuesday show. He wrote a great

911
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:45,475
Speaker 7:  story for us. He's written a couple of great stories for us about the Slate

912
00:56:45,475 --> 00:56:49,395
Speaker 7:  truck. I, I would say, without giving too much away traffic to our website

913
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:52,395
Speaker 7:  suggests that this is the most interesting thing that anyone has done in

914
00:56:52,395 --> 00:56:52,995
Speaker 7:  a very long time.

915
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:55,995
Speaker 5:  It's neck and neck between Slate Truck and calling Jeff Bezos a coward.

916
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:58,555
Speaker 5:  That's our audience.

917
00:56:58,555 --> 00:57:02,435
Speaker 7:  That's about right. Yeah. So let's let, what do you think

918
00:57:02,535 --> 00:57:05,995
Speaker 7:  you, you weren't here for our talk with Tim on, on Tuesday. What do you make

919
00:57:05,995 --> 00:57:06,515
Speaker 7:  of the sidetrack?

920
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:10,515
Speaker 5:  I listened to it actually the other day. I love Tim. Tim and I used to work

921
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:14,515
Speaker 5:  together in Gadget. He, it's so much fun when he writes for us and

922
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:14,995
Speaker 5:  does stuff for us.

923
00:57:17,235 --> 00:57:21,105
Speaker 5:  I, I'm like, take my money. It's,

924
00:57:21,465 --> 00:57:25,355
Speaker 5:  I don't need a pickup truck anymore. I used to need a pickup truck

925
00:57:25,355 --> 00:57:28,915
Speaker 5:  when I lived in the woods on an unpaved road and had to take my own trash

926
00:57:28,915 --> 00:57:32,395
Speaker 5:  to the dump once a week with a baby in the house, which meant the trash could

927
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:35,515
Speaker 5:  not stay in the house for more than two days. Do you understand what I'm,

928
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,235
Speaker 5:  do you understand what the baby was doing?

929
00:57:37,235 --> 00:57:38,275
Speaker 7:  Babies like trash

930
00:57:39,495 --> 00:57:42,275
Speaker 5:  Babies make the worst trash in human history.

931
00:57:42,785 --> 00:57:43,075
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

932
00:57:43,075 --> 00:57:47,035
Speaker 5:  That's real. It's not great. So yeah, we, you know,

933
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:49,875
Speaker 5:  there was a time when I like loaded the bed of a pickup truck like several

934
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,155
Speaker 5:  times a week in a pandemic and drove away and that was great. And then I

935
00:57:52,155 --> 00:57:55,875
Speaker 5:  moved to Westchester, pickup truck was incompatible with this area,

936
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:58,955
Speaker 5:  sold the pickup truck. And then I saw the slate truck and I was like, what

937
00:57:58,955 --> 00:57:59,155
Speaker 5:  if,

938
00:58:00,855 --> 00:58:02,905
Speaker 5:  what if I found a reason to take my own trash to the top?

939
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:06,785
Speaker 7:  But it's not a very picky pickup truck. Like I, no, it's very small. Never

940
00:58:06,785 --> 00:58:10,065
Speaker 7:  once in my life been like, you know, what I need is a pickup truck. And I

941
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:13,505
Speaker 7:  have still been on the Slate Auto website a half dozen times this week being

942
00:58:13,505 --> 00:58:15,065
Speaker 7:  like, I could buy this car. They

943
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:18,185
Speaker 5:  Did the one extremely smart thing about this late auto website. Even if you're

944
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:21,585
Speaker 5:  not a pickup truck person or a car person, they, the configurator is so much

945
00:58:21,605 --> 00:58:25,545
Speaker 5:  fun. It's because the thing is so modular by design. They're

946
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:29,465
Speaker 5:  like, I don't know today I want a yellow SUV tomorrow a a red pickup

947
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:32,945
Speaker 5:  truck with a Bluetooth speaker. And they, you're like, screw with it. I think

948
00:58:32,945 --> 00:58:36,625
Speaker 5:  they're, they're their ability to

949
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:40,465
Speaker 5:  capture the trends in cars right now with what people

950
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:44,425
Speaker 5:  are doing with cars and not what like Ford thinks people are doing

951
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:47,635
Speaker 5:  with cars is super interesting. So

952
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:51,635
Speaker 5:  every, you know, car culture is dominated by people wrapping their cars

953
00:58:52,415 --> 00:58:56,105
Speaker 5:  like all over the place. People buy like car, people buy what, you know,

954
00:58:56,445 --> 00:59:00,305
Speaker 5:  you, when you're like trying to buy a car, like a used car, if you're a car

955
00:59:00,305 --> 00:59:03,935
Speaker 5:  person, there's a party that's like, I wanna make sure I get the color I

956
00:59:03,935 --> 00:59:07,735
Speaker 5:  want. But there's another part that is like, I know exactly what set of

957
00:59:07,865 --> 00:59:11,775
Speaker 5:  specs and option packages I was looking for and the color is almost immaterial

958
00:59:11,775 --> 00:59:14,945
Speaker 5:  because I'm absolutely gonna wrap this car when I get it. Like that's just

959
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:18,945
Speaker 5:  a thing that happens in this world. Lots of people wrap new cars. So

960
00:59:19,085 --> 00:59:22,445
Speaker 5:  for slate to say, you know what, like we can just do away

961
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:26,565
Speaker 5:  with a paint shop or metal body panels and

962
00:59:26,705 --> 00:59:29,485
Speaker 5:  assume that our customers are gonna wrap the car to their specifications.

963
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:32,925
Speaker 5:  There's something about that that I think is incredibly smart,

964
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:37,585
Speaker 5:  right? They're, they're not at the, what does the big company think

965
00:59:37,645 --> 00:59:41,305
Speaker 5:  the market wants? They're at the, what is the community doing

966
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:45,345
Speaker 5:  and how do we deliver to the community, the product that might work?

967
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:49,025
Speaker 5:  And I don't have any of that's gonna work, right? Like it's new. I don't

968
00:59:49,025 --> 00:59:52,175
Speaker 5:  know if the car's any good. Like we haven't, no one's ever driven in one.

969
00:59:52,335 --> 00:59:54,775
Speaker 5:  I think listening to 10, it sounds like Slate hasn't spent a lot of time

970
00:59:54,775 --> 00:59:55,735
Speaker 5:  driving. It does.

971
00:59:56,295 --> 00:59:59,535
Speaker 7:  They've sat in it a lot. Yeah. That we know for sure. But has it gone

972
00:59:59,775 --> 01:00:02,575
Speaker 5:  Anywhere? There's something about that which I love, which is like, they're

973
01:00:02,575 --> 01:00:06,495
Speaker 5:  at the fringe of car culture in a very specific way that I think is super

974
01:00:06,495 --> 01:00:06,775
Speaker 5:  cool.

975
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:07,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

976
01:00:07,765 --> 01:00:11,605
Speaker 7:  That's fair. Jake, you're, you're famously a truck guy. Everyone who knows

977
01:00:11,605 --> 01:00:14,365
Speaker 7:  you, knows you love a cable knit sweater and a pickup truck.

978
01:00:15,435 --> 01:00:16,325
Speaker 7:  What do you think of this thing?

979
01:00:16,805 --> 01:00:20,645
Speaker 6:  I, I'm neither a car guy nor a truck guy, but this is the coolest truck I've

980
01:00:20,645 --> 01:00:24,405
Speaker 6:  ever seen. That's how I feel. This is the thing. It's like every single time

981
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:28,165
Speaker 6:  I I I am in a car, I have a problem with something. The speaker system is

982
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:32,245
Speaker 6:  terrible. The infotainment system is terrible. The I I love that.

983
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:35,685
Speaker 6:  They're just like, listen, you are gonna be mad about it anyway,

984
01:00:36,645 --> 01:00:39,845
Speaker 6:  whatever. Get a, bring your own speaker. I don't care. You're gonna put your

985
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:43,685
Speaker 6:  phone up anyway. Like, just do it. I, it's, it's like such a delightful

986
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:47,685
Speaker 6:  approach. It feels very friendly and, and welcoming and like, I,

987
01:00:47,885 --> 01:00:50,885
Speaker 6:  I kind of love that even though it's actually like deeply for tinkerers.

988
01:00:51,225 --> 01:00:55,125
Speaker 6:  The big question to me, and again, not a car guy.

989
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:59,685
Speaker 6:  People love really large vehicles and they started with

990
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:03,925
Speaker 6:  a truck and a small truck. Like when I see old

991
01:01:03,925 --> 01:01:07,845
Speaker 6:  trucks in the wild, the wild being the streets, I,

992
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:11,045
Speaker 6:  I like, I'm like, oh my God, they're so cute. Like, there's adorable little

993
01:01:11,055 --> 01:01:15,005
Speaker 6:  truck that, that was actually just a full size truck from 10 years

994
01:01:15,025 --> 01:01:17,685
Speaker 6:  ago. So I I I'm really curious

995
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:23,325
Speaker 6:  how that taps into the market they're going for, but it's a really cool

996
01:01:23,355 --> 01:01:23,645
Speaker 6:  idea.

997
01:01:24,155 --> 01:01:27,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Neli, is there a, is there a turn towards, obviously like

998
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:31,365
Speaker 7:  everywhere else it's, you know, the nineties and early two thousands again,

999
01:01:31,825 --> 01:01:35,365
Speaker 7:  are we gonna do that with cars? Are we gonna go back to like, you know, the,

1000
01:01:35,365 --> 01:01:39,165
Speaker 7:  the cars our parents had back in the day? Is that, is that coming? Because

1001
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:41,285
Speaker 7:  that's kinda what the site truck is aesthetically.

1002
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:43,325
Speaker 5:  So one, I want people to go on TikTok

1003
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:43,925
Speaker 6:  And technologically

1004
01:01:44,545 --> 01:01:47,765
Speaker 5:  And technologically and technologically, they're all gonna have cigarette

1005
01:01:47,765 --> 01:01:48,845
Speaker 5:  lighter in the beginning. It's gonna be great.

1006
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:52,685
Speaker 7:  I run with a boombox on my passenger seat for a long time like that. That's

1007
01:01:52,685 --> 01:01:53,045
Speaker 7:  a real thing.

1008
01:01:53,305 --> 01:01:56,565
Speaker 5:  Go on TikTok and just search for the Ford Ranger song. No further commentary.

1009
01:01:57,495 --> 01:02:00,545
Speaker 5:  It's just an ecosystem of content that you can be a part of. It's very good.

1010
01:02:00,615 --> 01:02:04,305
Speaker 5:  When I say my TikTok feed is trucks jumping over stuff, I'm offering you

1011
01:02:04,385 --> 01:02:08,265
Speaker 5:  a door that's very good. You know, the, the market's

1012
01:02:08,545 --> 01:02:12,265
Speaker 5:  distorted it, the, the trucks are big and they cost a hundred

1013
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:16,225
Speaker 5:  thousand dollars because trucks are excluded

1014
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:20,285
Speaker 5:  from some fuel economy standards and people buy them and then

1015
01:02:20,285 --> 01:02:23,365
Speaker 5:  you make them bigger and then dentists can write them off on their taxes

1016
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:27,365
Speaker 5:  in specific ways. And then you make 'em cost so much money. 'cause that's

1017
01:02:27,365 --> 01:02:31,285
Speaker 5:  just pure margin for the automaker. Like it's just, there's just like

1018
01:02:31,285 --> 01:02:34,765
Speaker 5:  a nonsensically to that part of the market. Because when you show people

1019
01:02:34,845 --> 01:02:37,605
Speaker 5:  a picture of like the Rivian R three X, everyone's like, that's what I want.

1020
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:42,325
Speaker 5:  I want, I want a weird little eighties hatchback that goes 300 miles

1021
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:45,645
Speaker 5:  on a charge. Like gimme that. You show people a Ford Maverick, which is still

1022
01:02:45,645 --> 01:02:49,125
Speaker 5:  huge compared to, to the slate truck. And they're like, that's, I want that,

1023
01:02:49,415 --> 01:02:53,045
Speaker 5:  gimme that. So there's a distortion in the market that I think everyone thinks

1024
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:57,005
Speaker 5:  is real, but it's like, it really is like a, the attack part tax is

1025
01:02:57,005 --> 01:03:00,965
Speaker 5:  like section 1 7 9. It's like you can write off the full value of a giant

1026
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:04,725
Speaker 5:  vehicle all at once if you run a small business and you claim that

1027
01:03:05,545 --> 01:03:09,205
Speaker 5:  yes, you know, your dry cleaners needs a truck of this size and so people

1028
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:11,845
Speaker 5:  do it and like the, there's just a distortion in the market.

1029
01:03:13,465 --> 01:03:17,125
Speaker 5:  And I, I think this is the anti tote to that in a real way. But I know why

1030
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:20,005
Speaker 5:  car makers have been making their cars bigger. I will. The other thing I

1031
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:23,885
Speaker 5:  will, I'm curious if the audience feels this way. I think all cars

1032
01:03:23,905 --> 01:03:26,205
Speaker 5:  are ugly right now. Like they are so ugly.

1033
01:03:26,645 --> 01:03:27,805
Speaker 7:  I agree with that. Yeah.

1034
01:03:28,035 --> 01:03:31,885
Speaker 5:  Very, very few cars are just straightforwardly beautiful. And

1035
01:03:32,315 --> 01:03:35,965
Speaker 5:  this trend back to sort of classic designs, like very handsome

1036
01:03:35,965 --> 01:03:38,325
Speaker 5:  profiles, it just can't come fast enough.

1037
01:03:38,705 --> 01:03:42,525
Speaker 7:  Oh, I totally agree. We, we've been lost in this like, cars

1038
01:03:42,525 --> 01:03:46,285
Speaker 7:  should look like the future thing for a while now. And like

1039
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:49,205
Speaker 7:  there's a, there's a Hyundai and Genesis dealership just down the street

1040
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:52,845
Speaker 7:  from me. And so like every day some new

1041
01:03:52,985 --> 01:03:56,925
Speaker 7:  stupid spaceship looking thing comes driving by my front door and

1042
01:03:56,945 --> 01:04:00,325
Speaker 7:  I'm like, what, what have we done here? Like, people love the iion,

1043
01:04:01,115 --> 01:04:04,965
Speaker 7:  it's all fine and every single one has like more weird angles

1044
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:08,365
Speaker 7:  and it's like, why these aren't cars anymore? What are we doing here? Yeah.

1045
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,965
Speaker 5:  My favorite weirdness in the current car design market is

1046
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:16,285
Speaker 5:  everyone has decided the headlights should be vertical, but we should still

1047
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:19,885
Speaker 5:  pretend to have very tiny, small horizontal headlights like eyebrows.

1048
01:04:20,185 --> 01:04:24,155
Speaker 5:  And I'm like, this looks horrible. Like if any of you looked at the cars,

1049
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:29,275
Speaker 5:  I, I just dunno what's going on. So it's nice to see

1050
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,675
Speaker 5:  some classic profiles come back. I think

1051
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:37,355
Speaker 5:  the, the car's not gonna ship for it another year, two years. It's vapor

1052
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:41,235
Speaker 5:  tilt ships man. Like Yep. But you know, who doesn't love dreaming out a vaporware

1053
01:04:41,235 --> 01:04:42,915
Speaker 5:  car? It's like America's favorite pastime.

1054
01:04:43,155 --> 01:04:46,675
Speaker 7:  That's what we do here. It's, and it's past, it's a render.

1055
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,715
Speaker 7:  So at least, at least we're past that point. It's not just a drawing of a

1056
01:04:50,715 --> 01:04:54,675
Speaker 7:  car. It is a car. And that's, that's something. Yeah. Jake, thank you

1057
01:04:54,675 --> 01:04:57,915
Speaker 7:  for that. I feel much better. Let's go back to the courthouse because there's

1058
01:04:57,915 --> 01:04:59,035
Speaker 7:  so, there's so, so much.

1059
01:04:59,945 --> 01:05:03,475
Speaker 5:  Alright. Alright. David, you, let's start with Google 'cause it, it's simpler.

1060
01:05:03,855 --> 01:05:06,835
Speaker 5:  The meta case is so complicated, it's gonna take us minute. David, you were

1061
01:05:07,015 --> 01:05:10,275
Speaker 5:  at the Google trial in the courthouse this week with Sundar try in the stand

1062
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:14,555
Speaker 5:  for what I gather it. He was just there to say, please, please don't make

1063
01:05:14,555 --> 01:05:15,955
Speaker 5:  me scrum. Kind

1064
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:19,885
Speaker 7:  Of. I I actually expected him to be a tiny bit more that than he

1065
01:05:20,065 --> 01:05:24,005
Speaker 7:  was. And so I've been in the courthouse three out

1066
01:05:24,005 --> 01:05:27,645
Speaker 7:  of the eight days now and I think we, I've missed a couple of interesting

1067
01:05:27,645 --> 01:05:30,565
Speaker 7:  people, but I've seen a bunch of the most interesting moments of the, the

1068
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:34,365
Speaker 7:  remedies trial so far. And the, the thing that he's become abundantly

1069
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:38,205
Speaker 7:  clear is that Google is petrified of the

1070
01:05:38,205 --> 01:05:42,165
Speaker 7:  part of the DOJs remedies that suggests that what Google actually needs

1071
01:05:42,165 --> 01:05:46,045
Speaker 7:  to do is take its search index, its ranking

1072
01:05:46,045 --> 01:05:48,845
Speaker 7:  information, which is just like how it ranks all the stuff, when it puts

1073
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:52,445
Speaker 7:  it on the page and the query streams that it gets, which is all the stuff

1074
01:05:52,445 --> 01:05:55,485
Speaker 7:  that people are actually searching for and essentially give that to anyone

1075
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:59,405
Speaker 7:  who wants it at, at what the DOJ calls a marginal cost. Nobody knows

1076
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:02,525
Speaker 7:  what a marginal cost is or who's gonna decide. That is one of the things

1077
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:06,165
Speaker 7:  Google's concerned about. But of all the things the DOJ wants,

1078
01:06:06,915 --> 01:06:10,405
Speaker 7:  that is the one that Google is terrified of. And

1079
01:06:11,025 --> 01:06:14,685
Speaker 7:  so Sundar, when he was on the stand, spent a long time

1080
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:17,765
Speaker 7:  talking about how scary that is. And you could tell

1081
01:06:18,545 --> 01:06:22,525
Speaker 7:  the line he had rehearsed either in his head or with a bunch of people who

1082
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:25,565
Speaker 7:  worked for him at Google. I suspect both. Yeah. You know, he you think he

1083
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,885
Speaker 7:  just workshopped in the mirror that morning at the hotel? Yeah, he's just,

1084
01:06:27,915 --> 01:06:31,885
Speaker 7:  he's just in the car on this way going reverse engineer. Reverse engineer.

1085
01:06:33,185 --> 01:06:36,205
Speaker 7:  Was he? He But his whole thing was essentially that if

1086
01:06:36,945 --> 01:06:40,645
Speaker 7:  Google has made itself into what It is because it has

1087
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:44,605
Speaker 7:  essentially out invested and outspent all of its rivals for 25 years.

1088
01:06:45,105 --> 01:06:49,085
Speaker 7:  And it's true, right? Like no, nobody has tried harder at search for

1089
01:06:49,085 --> 01:06:50,645
Speaker 7:  longer than Google. Certainly true.

1090
01:06:52,315 --> 01:06:55,655
Speaker 7:  And the thing he kept saying is, if you do this, if you take away

1091
01:06:56,435 --> 01:06:59,495
Speaker 7:  all of the stuff that we have done and you give it to everybody else who

1092
01:06:59,525 --> 01:07:03,375
Speaker 7:  asks for it, I don't know how as Google we can

1093
01:07:03,695 --> 01:07:06,935
Speaker 7:  continue to justify investing in search the way that we have. And

1094
01:07:08,085 --> 01:07:11,975
Speaker 7:  what he said is, if if you give people all this data, they can reverse engineer

1095
01:07:11,975 --> 01:07:15,215
Speaker 7:  Google. If you have all the information, you have the order in which we rank

1096
01:07:15,215 --> 01:07:17,935
Speaker 7:  that information and you have all the stuff that people are searching for,

1097
01:07:18,275 --> 01:07:22,055
Speaker 7:  that's the whole thing. That's it. You, you can, you can get from there to

1098
01:07:22,145 --> 01:07:25,535
Speaker 7:  every single thing about how Google works is Google's argument. They don't

1099
01:07:25,535 --> 01:07:28,095
Speaker 7:  have to give you the algorithm, but if you have the inputs and the outputs,

1100
01:07:28,095 --> 01:07:32,055
Speaker 7:  you can figure out the algorithm. And he, he over and over was

1101
01:07:32,055 --> 01:07:35,935
Speaker 7:  like, if you let people reverse engineer Google, why would I

1102
01:07:35,935 --> 01:07:39,705
Speaker 7:  keep building Google? And It is like, it, it just forcefully

1103
01:07:39,705 --> 01:07:41,945
Speaker 7:  saying that over and over. And he has really interesting thoughts about Chrome

1104
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:45,745
Speaker 7:  because he, he started Chrome, like Chrome was how

1105
01:07:46,025 --> 01:07:48,985
Speaker 7:  Sundar sort of made his rise inside of Google in the first place.

1106
01:07:50,765 --> 01:07:54,185
Speaker 7:  But the thing for him is he's like, you cannot make us give this away because

1107
01:07:54,205 --> 01:07:58,025
Speaker 7:  it will crush Google search. And then the, the DOJ is sitting there

1108
01:07:58,025 --> 01:08:01,625
Speaker 7:  being like, yeah, that's, that's the goal. That's what we're here for. And

1109
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:05,425
Speaker 7:  so it's, it's fascinating like for so much of this trial in the, in the liabilities

1110
01:08:05,425 --> 01:08:07,945
Speaker 7:  phase and in the remedies phase, these two sides have been talking completely

1111
01:08:07,975 --> 01:08:11,825
Speaker 7:  past each other. Google is like, we're very good and the

1112
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:14,665
Speaker 7:  DOJ is like, everything you've done is illegal and they're, they, they just

1113
01:08:14,665 --> 01:08:17,765
Speaker 7:  have not been speaking to each other. And, and it was Sundar was the first

1114
01:08:17,765 --> 01:08:20,725
Speaker 7:  time that it was like, oh, we're actually all talking about the same thing

1115
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:24,845
Speaker 7:  now. And, and what Google is saying is you

1116
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:28,645
Speaker 7:  think that what you have to do is solve some of the problems that

1117
01:08:28,645 --> 01:08:32,525
Speaker 7:  you've created. And what I'm saying it will happen is it

1118
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,525
Speaker 7:  will kill Google.

1119
01:08:35,065 --> 01:08:38,685
Speaker 7:  And it was just, it was just fascinating. And like Judge Meta who is

1120
01:08:38,695 --> 01:08:42,525
Speaker 7:  overseeing all of this, has asked a lot of questions about how big a deal

1121
01:08:42,595 --> 01:08:46,405
Speaker 7:  this kind of thing would be in the opening arguments. He asked a lot of questions

1122
01:08:46,405 --> 01:08:49,845
Speaker 7:  about what's a behavioral remedy and what's a structural remedy and does

1123
01:08:51,035 --> 01:08:54,805
Speaker 7:  this change within Google search constitute a behavioral

1124
01:08:54,805 --> 01:08:58,245
Speaker 7:  remedy which is easier to ask for and get or a structural remedy,

1125
01:08:58,455 --> 01:09:02,125
Speaker 7:  which is essentially breaking up Google and s Bahai's argument is, this is

1126
01:09:02,245 --> 01:09:06,205
Speaker 7:  breaking up Google. Like, it, it, he could not have been more apocalyptic

1127
01:09:06,205 --> 01:09:08,485
Speaker 7:  about what happens if this happens. And it was fascinating.

1128
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:12,205
Speaker 5:  You know, it's interesting there's some wonkiness about behavioral remedies

1129
01:09:12,205 --> 01:09:13,245
Speaker 5:  and structural remedies.

1130
01:09:14,975 --> 01:09:18,855
Speaker 5:  The behavioral remedy is you're gonna change the way you act

1131
01:09:19,275 --> 01:09:21,775
Speaker 5:  and the government will watch out. Right?

1132
01:09:22,595 --> 01:09:23,015
Speaker 7:  Be cool,

1133
01:09:23,395 --> 01:09:27,255
Speaker 5:  Be cool, or we we're show up, right? We're watching you. And

1134
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:31,015
Speaker 5:  there's a big argument you can actually listen to Rebecca Slaughter

1135
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:34,935
Speaker 5:  FCC commissioner on decoder earlier this week. Her argument is,

1136
01:09:35,545 --> 01:09:39,195
Speaker 5:  behavioral remedies are more intrusive, right? It's the

1137
01:09:39,195 --> 01:09:42,795
Speaker 5:  government over your shoulder saying what you can and can't do. Right? And

1138
01:09:42,795 --> 01:09:45,595
Speaker 5:  the structural remedy where you break it up is actually the more democratic

1139
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:46,755
Speaker 5:  small deed democratic

1140
01:09:48,275 --> 01:09:52,185
Speaker 5:  solution. 'cause you're just like, well you're broken up now, everyone try

1141
01:09:52,185 --> 01:09:55,985
Speaker 5:  your best with government out. And there's there's some real back and forth

1142
01:09:55,985 --> 01:09:59,755
Speaker 5:  there, right? Like do you want a Google that has

1143
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:02,595
Speaker 5:  this administration sitting over its shoulder being like, are you behaving

1144
01:10:02,835 --> 01:10:06,795
Speaker 5:  yourself if you don't, if you love this administration, do you want to

1145
01:10:06,795 --> 01:10:10,475
Speaker 5:  Google that? I don't know has president a OC sitting over their

1146
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:13,715
Speaker 5:  shoulder saying, are you doing what I want? Like there's a lot to contend

1147
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:17,395
Speaker 5:  with there in the behavioral remedy. Whereas the structure remedy might be

1148
01:10:17,395 --> 01:10:21,155
Speaker 5:  the end of Google. If you listen to sunder Shy, like I, it's,

1149
01:10:21,155 --> 01:10:22,915
Speaker 5:  it's hard to evaluate which one's like a better idea,

1150
01:10:23,565 --> 01:10:27,475
Speaker 7:  Right? I mean It is sort of funny. I I went into this thinking and I have

1151
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:29,875
Speaker 7:  talked to a bunch of people who confirmed that they were also thinking this

1152
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:33,235
Speaker 7:  people sort of in and around the trial that the, the

1153
01:10:33,945 --> 01:10:37,715
Speaker 7:  idea that Google should have to divest Chrome was the

1154
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:40,675
Speaker 7:  big swing nobody thought they would get right? That this was, this was the

1155
01:10:40,675 --> 01:10:43,715
Speaker 7:  thing you performatively give up in order to get the other stuff and that

1156
01:10:43,715 --> 01:10:47,635
Speaker 7:  it would wind down to just, just don't you,

1157
01:10:47,655 --> 01:10:50,555
Speaker 7:  you can't pay Apple $20 billion a year that that was gonna be where this

1158
01:10:50,555 --> 01:10:54,395
Speaker 7:  landed. The DOJ has argued far

1159
01:10:54,465 --> 01:10:58,075
Speaker 7:  more forcefully for the idea that

1160
01:10:58,075 --> 01:11:01,875
Speaker 7:  solving search in this way is what has to happen. And Google has come to

1161
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:05,755
Speaker 7:  believe pretty clearly that it's a real threat and that it would be much

1162
01:11:05,755 --> 01:11:08,755
Speaker 7:  scarier. Like you get the distinct sense that Google would much rather sell

1163
01:11:08,755 --> 01:11:12,395
Speaker 7:  Chrome than give up this search data.

1164
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:15,565
Speaker 5:  Well, you know, it's, there's like a natural experiment for Google 'cause

1165
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:19,125
Speaker 5:  they're just the default on iPhone. That's like, it's not iOS Chrome that's

1166
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:22,995
Speaker 5:  making them the money right now. Right? It's Chrome

1167
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:25,915
Speaker 5:  search or it's, it's Google searches and Safari,

1168
01:11:26,045 --> 01:11:29,275
Speaker 6:  Right? What they would lose if they lost Chrome, right? If somebody else

1169
01:11:29,295 --> 01:11:31,675
Speaker 6:  is operating Chrome, I guess the threat is that they have their own search

1170
01:11:31,675 --> 01:11:35,435
Speaker 6:  engine or AI service to replace it. But if app, if they can still

1171
01:11:35,485 --> 01:11:38,555
Speaker 6:  offer a cut of search traffic and just say like, Hey, if you want to,

1172
01:11:39,765 --> 01:11:41,215
Speaker 6:  it's still just gonna be more Google search.

1173
01:11:41,485 --> 01:11:42,415
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah.

1174
01:11:42,415 --> 01:11:43,375
Speaker 6:  They're gonna be paying a lot.

1175
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:47,905
Speaker 7:  Yeah. To be clear, Google would very much like to hold onto Chrome and Sundar

1176
01:11:47,905 --> 01:11:49,785
Speaker 7:  talked to a lot about that and mean

1177
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:50,945
Speaker 5:  It's his baby. It

1178
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:54,825
Speaker 7:  Is his baby. But also he talks a lot about the Chromium project, which is,

1179
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:59,225
Speaker 7:  he is correct in saying Chromium is the most important

1180
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:03,065
Speaker 7:  thing in web browsing right now. And It is, it's a technically open

1181
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:06,345
Speaker 7:  source thing that Google fundamentally controls and runs and operates. He

1182
01:12:06,345 --> 01:12:10,185
Speaker 7:  said 94% of the code commits to chromium over the last year have been

1183
01:12:10,185 --> 01:12:13,545
Speaker 7:  from Google employees. It spends huge amounts of money on chromium.

1184
01:12:14,105 --> 01:12:18,065
Speaker 7:  Microsoft's browser is based on chromium, like brave is chromium. Almost

1185
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:21,705
Speaker 7:  all of the browsers people use are chromium or Chrome.

1186
01:12:22,325 --> 01:12:26,145
Speaker 7:  And that, that matters, right? Like that's a huge deal. And the idea

1187
01:12:26,165 --> 01:12:30,025
Speaker 7:  of some other company, like I asked, I asked

1188
01:12:30,065 --> 01:12:33,945
Speaker 7:  a a a person around this trial, like, is the idea of

1189
01:12:33,945 --> 01:12:37,865
Speaker 7:  open AI administering chromium terrifying to you? And

1190
01:12:37,865 --> 01:12:38,745
Speaker 7:  they just laughed at me

1191
01:12:39,895 --> 01:12:40,185
Speaker 5:  Like,

1192
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:44,585
Speaker 7:  And, and Chromebooks change, ChromeOS changes. Like It

1193
01:12:44,585 --> 01:12:48,025
Speaker 7:  is a huge change for Google in a really meaningful way and all of a sudden

1194
01:12:48,045 --> 01:12:51,385
Speaker 7:  the the default Android browser becomes not yours, which is meaningful too.

1195
01:12:51,445 --> 01:12:52,625
Speaker 7:  But, but again, like

1196
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:58,025
Speaker 7:  that is all immaterial to Google if it can't win

1197
01:12:58,025 --> 01:13:01,985
Speaker 7:  at search anymore. Like Chrome only matters because search matters. And

1198
01:13:01,985 --> 01:13:02,945
Speaker 7:  if you kill search, who cares?

1199
01:13:03,465 --> 01:13:07,225
Speaker 5:  I find this Chrome argument so disingenuous. Can I just say that

1200
01:13:07,335 --> 01:13:10,785
Speaker 5:  like I agree. Everything is Electron is Chrome. Half of the desktop apps

1201
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:14,745
Speaker 5:  I'm running right now are chromium. That's true. Like

1202
01:13:14,745 --> 01:13:18,665
Speaker 5:  right Notion calendar is a chromium app. Like it's running, it's just an

1203
01:13:18,865 --> 01:13:20,625
Speaker 5:  electron thing, right? Like whatever,

1204
01:13:22,195 --> 01:13:25,855
Speaker 5:  all of those companies have an enormous incentive to make sure their apps

1205
01:13:25,855 --> 01:13:29,655
Speaker 5:  still work and that chromium is good. Google has an

1206
01:13:29,815 --> 01:13:33,135
Speaker 5:  enormous incentive to make sure the Android browser is good, which means

1207
01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:36,495
Speaker 5:  it will continue developing chromium upon which It is based.

1208
01:13:37,695 --> 01:13:40,755
Speaker 5:  So this idea that if they don't have chrome, just like Chrome on Windows

1209
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:43,995
Speaker 5:  anymore, that they won't just immediately

1210
01:13:44,705 --> 01:13:48,595
Speaker 5:  fork chromium. They can't, they, that's not allowed. They're not one to

1211
01:13:48,685 --> 01:13:51,755
Speaker 7:  Their browser at all. They be allowed by, by the rules of the, the remedies

1212
01:13:51,755 --> 01:13:53,955
Speaker 7:  that the d OJ has proposed. Google would not be allowed to do that.

1213
01:13:55,535 --> 01:13:57,495
Speaker 7:  I mean, it, it could land elsewhere, but the idea of like,

1214
01:13:57,495 --> 01:13:59,295
Speaker 5:  It could, right? They can negotiate their way outta that to say we need to

1215
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,495
Speaker 5:  make our first party browser on Android. Right?

1216
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:04,735
Speaker 7:  A question we've gotten a bunch from folks actually is like, couldn't Google

1217
01:14:04,765 --> 01:14:08,455
Speaker 7:  just make another browser and there's a ton of wiggle room in it, but like

1218
01:14:08,455 --> 01:14:11,445
Speaker 7:  letter of the law? No, it couldn't, it would not be allowed to.

1219
01:14:12,105 --> 01:14:15,235
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean it just feels like that's, that's the give and take here, right?

1220
01:14:15,265 --> 01:14:19,075
Speaker 5:  Like a bunch of people are still very motivated to keep chromium going.

1221
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:22,235
Speaker 5:  A lot of people don't spend the money 'cause Google will, right?

1222
01:14:22,235 --> 01:14:23,595
Speaker 7:  That's the interesting counterfactual,

1223
01:14:23,595 --> 01:14:27,115
Speaker 5:  Right? But if that development moves elsewhere, it's not like all those people

1224
01:14:27,115 --> 01:14:30,875
Speaker 5:  have suddenly lost from incentive like Electron as an open

1225
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:34,755
Speaker 5:  source platform unto itself relies on a chromium. You can just see how

1226
01:14:35,425 --> 01:14:38,515
Speaker 5:  that development ecosystem will like help. It won't be as big, it won't be

1227
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:42,395
Speaker 5:  as rich, right? You won't get as many like, you know, old time classic

1228
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:45,795
Speaker 5:  Google neck beards like doing chromium under the good of their heart that

1229
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:49,595
Speaker 5:  like against no revenue, which is a thing that a company at Google

1230
01:14:49,595 --> 01:14:53,315
Speaker 5:  Scale can do and a company with Google's culture can do. Like,

1231
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:56,475
Speaker 5:  you know, I've interviewed Sundar before, I'm like, is AI killing the web

1232
01:14:56,495 --> 01:14:59,595
Speaker 5:  for like an hour? And he's like, I love the web. And that's like, you believe

1233
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:03,515
Speaker 5:  him because he made Chrome. He he cares whether or not he's actually killing

1234
01:15:03,515 --> 01:15:07,395
Speaker 5:  the web. I mean that was the harder that conversation last year. I don't,

1235
01:15:07,395 --> 01:15:09,675
Speaker 5:  I don't know what's gonna happen here. It just feels very much like

1236
01:15:11,635 --> 01:15:14,735
Speaker 5:  Google making a search a little bit more interoperable

1237
01:15:15,405 --> 01:15:18,895
Speaker 5:  against the worry that someone will reverse engineer all of search

1238
01:15:19,555 --> 01:15:23,495
Speaker 5:  and then make it so that Google is worth nothing to consumers

1239
01:15:24,115 --> 01:15:27,975
Speaker 5:  is is just like fake worry. There's still

1240
01:15:27,975 --> 01:15:31,775
Speaker 5:  Google. The ver people still say they're gonna Google it.

1241
01:15:31,885 --> 01:15:35,695
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like you could make Bing an exact copy of Google

1242
01:15:35,905 --> 01:15:39,715
Speaker 5:  today and people wouldn't use bing. Bing has

1243
01:15:39,715 --> 01:15:43,515
Speaker 5:  made Bing an exact copy of Google today and people won't use Bing.

1244
01:15:45,445 --> 01:15:49,335
Speaker 5:  There's something about this that just seems, I dunno, we'll see

1245
01:15:49,335 --> 01:15:53,255
Speaker 5:  what happens. But it feels like they're making all of

1246
01:15:53,255 --> 01:15:55,775
Speaker 5:  this, you know, it's like the smartest people in the world are saying we

1247
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:58,535
Speaker 5:  can't solve this problem. It just never rings sincere to me.

1248
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:01,575
Speaker 7:  Yeah, no, I I think that's fair. And, and I, the other thing I should say

1249
01:16:01,575 --> 01:16:04,815
Speaker 7:  about chromium is I've talked to a lot of people who make browsers

1250
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:08,975
Speaker 7:  who would love for Google to be less intense about

1251
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:13,335
Speaker 7:  running chromium. Like everybody I talk to who doesn't work at Google

1252
01:16:13,355 --> 01:16:17,215
Speaker 7:  and works with chromium is like, God, it's so annoying that Google runs chromium

1253
01:16:17,215 --> 01:16:19,855
Speaker 7:  because what they want goes and everything they do is to benefit Google in

1254
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:23,695
Speaker 7:  some way. And wouldn't it be great if we had a neutral thing that

1255
01:16:23,695 --> 01:16:27,095
Speaker 7:  just wanted browsers to be great? The problem is that's very expensive and

1256
01:16:27,275 --> 01:16:29,935
Speaker 7:  no one has ever done it before. But to your point, no one has ever done that

1257
01:16:29,935 --> 01:16:33,775
Speaker 7:  before because Google always has. Yeah. So like I, is there a a

1258
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:37,855
Speaker 7:  way in the wings for this to work? It's certainly possible. The DOJ certainly

1259
01:16:37,855 --> 01:16:38,735
Speaker 7:  believes there is are are

1260
01:16:38,735 --> 01:16:42,175
Speaker 5:  There scaled open source projects that run the entire world that don't have

1261
01:16:42,175 --> 01:16:45,815
Speaker 5:  a Google involved? Yes, Linux exists.

1262
01:16:46,475 --> 01:16:50,135
Speaker 5:  Now, does Linux have its own deeply fucked

1263
01:16:50,135 --> 01:16:54,015
Speaker 5:  governance problems? It absolutely does, but like

1264
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:54,695
Speaker 5:  it exists

1265
01:16:54,925 --> 01:16:58,375
Speaker 7:  Somewhere. Sundar PCI just heard you comparing Google to the Linux Foundation

1266
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,375
Speaker 7:  and started sobbing uncontrollably.

1267
01:17:00,675 --> 01:17:04,255
Speaker 5:  I'm, the whole world is like, man, I hope the one guy shows up to commit

1268
01:17:04,255 --> 01:17:08,055
Speaker 5:  code to Linux for free. And like it works. Like thus far

1269
01:17:08,115 --> 01:17:12,085
Speaker 5:  it has worked. That's true. All right. That's a Google case where David,

1270
01:17:12,245 --> 01:17:15,845
Speaker 5:  I think you're gonna be in that courtroom a bunch just down the hall.

1271
01:17:16,115 --> 01:17:18,355
Speaker 5:  Yeah, upstairs around

1272
01:17:18,355 --> 01:17:22,115
Speaker 7:  The court, down the hall. It's, it's all, it's all pure chaos.

1273
01:17:22,735 --> 01:17:26,715
Speaker 7:  My favorite thing is this is a little inside baseball for everybody. So the

1274
01:17:26,715 --> 01:17:29,035
Speaker 7:  way this works is these, these courtrooms,

1275
01:17:29,175 --> 01:17:31,235
Speaker 5:  We should say it's the meta case that's just down the

1276
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:33,435
Speaker 7:  Hall. Oh yeah. The meta case is just down the hall. And what I should say

1277
01:17:33,435 --> 01:17:37,315
Speaker 7:  is the courtrooms typically don't allow any electronics at all. Right? Like,

1278
01:17:37,315 --> 01:17:40,155
Speaker 7:  you can't, you can't even type on your laptop while you're in there. You

1279
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,595
Speaker 7:  can't have phones, no, nothing. So what a lot of media members do who wanna

1280
01:17:43,595 --> 01:17:47,475
Speaker 7:  like take notes and write stories, there are media rooms for

1281
01:17:47,475 --> 01:17:49,915
Speaker 7:  each one of them, and sometimes it's another courtroom and they just get

1282
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,395
Speaker 7:  like a video feed of the trial and they watch it there. They move the media

1283
01:17:53,395 --> 01:17:57,075
Speaker 7:  rooms around every day. So every morning you show up at the courthouse and

1284
01:17:57,075 --> 01:18:00,115
Speaker 7:  it's just pure chaos of a bunch of reporters trying to figure out which room

1285
01:18:00,115 --> 01:18:02,715
Speaker 7:  to go to. And every morning there's somebody who thinks they're in the Google

1286
01:18:02,715 --> 01:18:06,635
Speaker 7:  trial, but it's actually in the meta trial and vice versa. And the

1287
01:18:06,635 --> 01:18:10,515
Speaker 7:  other day when I was there for Sundar, they started the morning

1288
01:18:11,025 --> 01:18:14,835
Speaker 7:  with a completely unrelated criminal trial, just like it was just another

1289
01:18:14,835 --> 01:18:18,115
Speaker 7:  trial that that Judge Meta is overseeing. And so for five minutes, he just

1290
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:20,395
Speaker 7:  had like a procedural conversation with a lawyer about when they were gonna

1291
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:23,995
Speaker 7:  talk to this guy about his crime. And people are like pouring

1292
01:18:24,185 --> 01:18:28,115
Speaker 7:  into the media room as this is on the screens being like, who's in the jumpsuit?

1293
01:18:29,345 --> 01:18:30,355
Speaker 5:  There's this guy in like

1294
01:18:30,355 --> 01:18:33,235
Speaker 7:  An orange prison jumpsuit and everybody's trying to figure out which Google

1295
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:36,195
Speaker 7:  executive this is. Yes, it's fantastic. I enjoyed every,

1296
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,835
Speaker 5:  It wasn't Andy Rubin, it

1297
01:18:37,835 --> 01:18:40,675
Speaker 7:  Was not in fact. But so the, the meta trial, there are like

1298
01:18:41,765 --> 01:18:44,795
Speaker 7:  three, there are a lot of things going on in this meta trial and,

1299
01:18:44,795 --> 01:18:47,795
Speaker 5:  But we should note Lauren Finer is in that. Do you, do you and Lauren see

1300
01:18:47,795 --> 01:18:48,595
Speaker 5:  each other in the courthouse?

1301
01:18:48,615 --> 01:18:51,355
Speaker 7:  We do. We pass each other in the hallways a couple times a day. That's hilarious.

1302
01:18:51,595 --> 01:18:55,475
Speaker 7:  And Lauren, Lauren has become like sort of the, the house mom of the courtroom.

1303
01:18:55,715 --> 01:18:58,035
Speaker 7:  Every time, every time I look around she's like directing somebody where

1304
01:18:58,035 --> 01:19:01,075
Speaker 7:  to go and telling 'em where the cafeteria is and she's like, no, the mediums

1305
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:04,755
Speaker 7:  are like, Lauren lives in the, the district court of DC That's right.

1306
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:07,515
Speaker 7:  And someday she will leave and she'll be on The Vergecast and it'll be very

1307
01:19:07,675 --> 01:19:10,915
Speaker 7:  exciting. But there are, there are kind of three threads that I wanna talk

1308
01:19:10,915 --> 01:19:14,195
Speaker 7:  about from the, the meta trial this week. And the first is TikTok, which

1309
01:19:14,195 --> 01:19:18,075
Speaker 7:  has come up an awful lot in the course of the meta trial

1310
01:19:18,075 --> 01:19:21,735
Speaker 7:  because the like, big open question

1311
01:19:22,115 --> 01:19:24,775
Speaker 7:  for all of this, and we've talked about this is like, what is a social network,

1312
01:19:24,785 --> 01:19:28,655
Speaker 7:  right? And that, what was it, what was it

1313
01:19:28,795 --> 01:19:32,295
Speaker 7:  one day where TikTok was gone has turned into

1314
01:19:32,765 --> 01:19:36,655
Speaker 7:  this incredibly interesting data point of who competes with who based on

1315
01:19:36,655 --> 01:19:40,495
Speaker 7:  what happened when TikTok was gone. And tiktoks head of

1316
01:19:40,495 --> 01:19:44,455
Speaker 7:  operations was on the stand this week talking about what reels is

1317
01:19:44,455 --> 01:19:48,055
Speaker 7:  versus what TikTok is and how people use Reels isn, how people use TikTok

1318
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:52,295
Speaker 7:  and how Instagram has adapted Reels,

1319
01:19:52,295 --> 01:19:55,695
Speaker 7:  isn its own app to match TikTok. But this question of

1320
01:19:56,095 --> 01:20:00,025
Speaker 7:  like, what is TikTok and

1321
01:20:00,365 --> 01:20:04,305
Speaker 7:  how have all the other apps, particularly within Meta responded to it, has

1322
01:20:04,305 --> 01:20:08,295
Speaker 7:  become like one of the most important parts of this whole trial. And

1323
01:20:08,295 --> 01:20:11,775
Speaker 7:  it's deeply bizarre because TikTok is supposed to be gone. So,

1324
01:20:11,835 --> 01:20:15,655
Speaker 6:  So is it good for meta or bad for meta when people flock

1325
01:20:15,715 --> 01:20:19,495
Speaker 6:  to its apps in, in place of TikTok, right? That shows that

1326
01:20:19,495 --> 01:20:23,335
Speaker 6:  they're, the, the, the sun around which everything else orbits.

1327
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:26,135
Speaker 6:  On the other hand, it shows that people are other places.

1328
01:20:26,685 --> 01:20:30,495
Speaker 7:  It's really true. And also a lot of different,

1329
01:20:32,055 --> 01:20:35,855
Speaker 7:  a lot of different witnesses on the sand this week have been forced to acknowledge

1330
01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:39,415
Speaker 7:  that there is nothing remotely unique about Instagram at all.

1331
01:20:40,295 --> 01:20:41,455
Speaker 6:  I mean, over and over, over

1332
01:20:41,765 --> 01:20:43,135
Speaker 7:  Like, oh yeah, Instagram's just a copy of

1333
01:20:43,135 --> 01:20:44,535
Speaker 6:  Other apps. Apps smashed together.

1334
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:48,735
Speaker 7:  Exactly. Which I've enjoyed very much. Like there was a, there was a line

1335
01:20:48,735 --> 01:20:52,135
Speaker 7:  from, I believe his name was Aaron Pressman at, or Aaron Presser, excuse

1336
01:20:52,135 --> 01:20:56,095
Speaker 7:  me, at TikTok who called TikTok Reels

1337
01:20:56,095 --> 01:20:59,935
Speaker 7:  ISN shorts, virtually and deliberately indistinguishable and function

1338
01:20:59,935 --> 01:21:03,535
Speaker 7:  and user experience quoting something that the company had written

1339
01:21:03,715 --> 01:21:07,535
Speaker 7:  in March. It's fabulous. I just love it. It's very good.

1340
01:21:09,675 --> 01:21:13,545
Speaker 7:  But th this, this TikTok thing, I I think to your point, Jake

1341
01:21:13,565 --> 01:21:17,265
Speaker 7:  is like Meta is trying to prove that it has millions of competitors, right?

1342
01:21:17,265 --> 01:21:21,065
Speaker 7:  And that that TikTok competes with Instagram, and Instagram

1343
01:21:21,065 --> 01:21:25,025
Speaker 7:  competes with Facebook and actually this is like a huge teaming ecosystem

1344
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:27,945
Speaker 7:  of places people hang out and spend their time.

1345
01:21:29,295 --> 01:21:32,835
Speaker 7:  The the case against It is that

1346
01:21:33,835 --> 01:21:37,795
Speaker 7:  Facebook is a, is a personal social network and that that's, that's

1347
01:21:37,795 --> 01:21:41,675
Speaker 7:  what it does. And that that's where it has a monopoly and thus all

1348
01:21:41,675 --> 01:21:45,475
Speaker 7:  the stuff that it has done is monopolistic. And the

1349
01:21:45,575 --> 01:21:48,715
Speaker 7:  the TikTok thing, I think on balance probably helps

1350
01:21:49,745 --> 01:21:53,275
Speaker 7:  meta because what they're saying is they, they've had

1351
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:56,675
Speaker 7:  executives from Tumblr and Pinterest and Strava

1352
01:21:57,225 --> 01:22:00,795
Speaker 7:  come up on the stand and say, we're not a social network.

1353
01:22:01,095 --> 01:22:04,555
Speaker 7:  We are, we are about interests, right? Like even, even Twitter folks said

1354
01:22:04,555 --> 01:22:07,035
Speaker 7:  this, like, we're, we're a place to go for things that you're interested

1355
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:10,875
Speaker 7:  in, which is not the same as a place to go to find people that you're friends

1356
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:14,755
Speaker 7:  with. But Meta gets up and is like, well, when TikTok dies, everybody comes

1357
01:22:14,755 --> 01:22:17,395
Speaker 7:  to our app and then when TikTok comes back, everybody leaves and goes back

1358
01:22:17,595 --> 01:22:18,995
Speaker 7:  to TikTok. So what are we gonna, what do we do?

1359
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:22,675
Speaker 6:  I, I do think it's really interesting, like it feels to me, and, and tell

1360
01:22:22,675 --> 01:22:26,435
Speaker 6:  me if I'm wrong, but it feels to me like a lot of this case

1361
01:22:26,495 --> 01:22:29,755
Speaker 6:  is premised around this I idea of the personal social network

1362
01:22:30,295 --> 01:22:32,835
Speaker 6:  you connecting with your friends and your family, which is this very old

1363
01:22:32,835 --> 01:22:36,275
Speaker 6:  school, old school, you know, 10, 15 years ago, I guess

1364
01:22:37,015 --> 01:22:40,635
Speaker 6:  vision of social media. And I feel like if Facebook vanished

1365
01:22:40,925 --> 01:22:44,435
Speaker 6:  today, I don't know that there would be a one-to-one replacement,

1366
01:22:44,725 --> 01:22:47,555
Speaker 6:  right? That is just not how people are thinking about social media anymore.

1367
01:22:47,975 --> 01:22:49,875
Speaker 6:  As I think, which may maybe

1368
01:22:50,245 --> 01:22:53,875
Speaker 7:  Where all my angriest neighbors to try to send their friends to jail,

1369
01:22:53,925 --> 01:22:57,715
Speaker 6:  There is another app for that that is next for That's true. Yeah. But like,

1370
01:22:57,725 --> 01:23:00,875
Speaker 6:  maybe that hasn't popped up because Facebook has this monopoly and they're

1371
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:04,115
Speaker 6:  being anti-competitive, but maybe it has hasn't popped up because people

1372
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:07,300
Speaker 6:  just want different types, types of experiences on social media. And I feel

1373
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:11,045
Speaker 6:  like that's what we're seeing with all these other companies that they're

1374
01:23:11,045 --> 01:23:11,405
Speaker 6:  calling up.

1375
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:15,465
Speaker 5:  But this was Mark's insight. I mean, this is the heart of the case

1376
01:23:16,085 --> 01:23:19,465
Speaker 5:  is Mark Zuckerberg woke up and said, every so often

1377
01:23:19,855 --> 01:23:23,825
Speaker 5:  there's a new thing that people want to do on their phones that

1378
01:23:23,985 --> 01:23:27,385
Speaker 5:  gives rise to another social network. There's another kind of sharing dynamic.

1379
01:23:27,885 --> 01:23:31,425
Speaker 5:  And so Facebook was whatever it was not, or not for

1380
01:23:31,425 --> 01:23:35,345
Speaker 5:  colleges. And then he identified photo sharing on Instagram and

1381
01:23:35,345 --> 01:23:38,225
Speaker 5:  said, I gotta buy that one. And then he identified, and there's all these

1382
01:23:38,225 --> 01:23:41,785
Speaker 5:  emails where he lays out his thinking and then he identified group

1383
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:45,585
Speaker 5:  messaging and messaging and said, I gotta buy WhatsApp. And so the, the

1384
01:23:45,585 --> 01:23:49,265
Speaker 5:  point here is the anti-competitive move

1385
01:23:49,845 --> 01:23:53,705
Speaker 5:  was to stifle the thing that could have taken Facebook's market share

1386
01:23:54,085 --> 01:23:56,585
Speaker 5:  and whether or not they could have bought a TikTok.

1387
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:02,095
Speaker 5:  It's like we, you're just getting into this place where they became so big

1388
01:24:02,645 --> 01:24:06,015
Speaker 5:  that TikTok was too big to buy and also owned by the Chinese government or

1389
01:24:06,015 --> 01:24:08,735
Speaker 5:  controlled by the Chinese government somewhere. Like, it's like, it's the

1390
01:24:08,735 --> 01:24:11,975
Speaker 5:  weirdest one because they, they did try to buy Snap,

1391
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:14,815
Speaker 5:  right? And they, Evan said, no,

1392
01:24:16,655 --> 01:24:20,535
Speaker 5:  I have this quote here from Rebecca Slaughter is a commissioner of the FCC.

1393
01:24:20,675 --> 01:24:24,215
Speaker 5:  She was a democratic commissioner of the FTC. She's appointed by Trump in

1394
01:24:24,215 --> 01:24:28,055
Speaker 5:  the first term, legally fired by Trump in this term. But she is

1395
01:24:28,055 --> 01:24:31,975
Speaker 5:  one of the commissioners at the FT C who voted this case out of the commission

1396
01:24:31,975 --> 01:24:34,655
Speaker 5:  and said we should go to trial on it. And so I asked her about this market

1397
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:36,615
Speaker 5:  definition thing. I was like, this is dumb, right? Like

1398
01:24:38,155 --> 01:24:41,615
Speaker 5:  Met is a narrative about this is like putting us in personal social

1399
01:24:41,615 --> 01:24:45,415
Speaker 5:  networking is whatever. And she said, look, all antitrust cases are what

1400
01:24:45,415 --> 01:24:48,535
Speaker 5:  market definition to a degree, it's very tortured things that makes people

1401
01:24:48,565 --> 01:24:52,495
Speaker 5:  hate lawyers. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration

1402
01:24:52,495 --> 01:24:55,535
Speaker 5:  of it gets very complicated. Market definition is always hard. Everyone has

1403
01:24:55,535 --> 01:24:58,175
Speaker 5:  a different view about the right way to define a market. It all gets litigated.

1404
01:24:58,555 --> 01:25:02,415
Speaker 5:  And then she went on to tell me what this case is really about is

1405
01:25:02,415 --> 01:25:05,935
Speaker 5:  whether meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That

1406
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:09,175
Speaker 5:  is the argument at the end of the day. Did it not wanna compete on the merits,

1407
01:25:09,175 --> 01:25:12,375
Speaker 5:  but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to

1408
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:15,775
Speaker 5:  build and maintain a monopoly in a way that's illegal. It's not more

1409
01:25:16,015 --> 01:25:19,815
Speaker 5:  complicated than that. So I think Meta is putting a lot of stock into the

1410
01:25:19,815 --> 01:25:23,415
Speaker 5:  existence of Mei. It's like, here's this dumb thing we can say to make everyone

1411
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:27,095
Speaker 5:  think everything else is dumb. And then you have the actual Federal Trade

1412
01:25:27,095 --> 01:25:30,895
Speaker 5:  Commission saying no, this case is, you saw Instagram as a rising

1413
01:25:30,895 --> 01:25:34,705
Speaker 5:  threat and you bought it to kill it. And they've shown that now I

1414
01:25:34,865 --> 01:25:38,625
Speaker 5:  think pretty conclusively. And here are all of these other threats.

1415
01:25:39,445 --> 01:25:42,305
Speaker 5:  If you could have bought TikTok when TikTok went down, people came to your

1416
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:46,065
Speaker 5:  apps, they're obviously competitors. If you could've, you would've, I don't

1417
01:25:46,065 --> 01:25:48,825
Speaker 5:  know how that's gonna go. I I really don't. This is, this case is real weird.

1418
01:25:49,215 --> 01:25:52,745
Speaker 5:  It's like this old lawyer cliche. I keep saying like, if you don't have the

1419
01:25:52,745 --> 01:25:55,345
Speaker 5:  law, you argue the facts. If you don't have the facts, you argue the law.

1420
01:25:55,345 --> 01:25:59,305
Speaker 5:  And if you don't have either, you pound the table. This is like old law professors

1421
01:25:59,305 --> 01:26:00,705
Speaker 5:  say this, they think they're very clever,

1422
01:26:02,495 --> 01:26:05,935
Speaker 5:  but that's what, what the, that's what's happening here. Like Meta is trying

1423
01:26:05,935 --> 01:26:09,415
Speaker 5:  to argue the Esoterical law of market definition and the government is like,

1424
01:26:09,755 --> 01:26:10,895
Speaker 5:  but you bought Instagram,

1425
01:26:11,225 --> 01:26:14,375
Speaker 7:  Right? And that, I mean we talked about this last week, but that was the

1426
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:16,975
Speaker 7:  thing that was so damaging about the, the Kevin system. Bit of it. And to

1427
01:26:16,975 --> 01:26:19,815
Speaker 7:  that point actually, I think the, the most interesting piece of all that

1428
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:23,495
Speaker 7:  this week has been about WhatsApp, which has come up

1429
01:26:23,965 --> 01:26:27,295
Speaker 7:  more this week than in sort of previous parts of the testimony. And

1430
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:32,375
Speaker 7:  it has become very clear that Facebook was petrified about what

1431
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:35,935
Speaker 7:  messaging apps might do to Facebook in particular. And

1432
01:26:36,465 --> 01:26:39,855
Speaker 7:  there the, it was really worried that Google was gonna buy WhatsApp and turn

1433
01:26:39,855 --> 01:26:43,455
Speaker 7:  it into a, a cross platform social network. Which is very funny

1434
01:26:43,525 --> 01:26:47,215
Speaker 7:  because at the same time Lauren is hearing this, I was sitting in the

1435
01:26:47,215 --> 01:26:51,175
Speaker 7:  courtroom listening to Sundar talk about how bad Google Plus was

1436
01:26:51,595 --> 01:26:55,255
Speaker 7:  and get burned by the plaintiffs for how bad Google Buzz was

1437
01:26:55,575 --> 01:26:58,935
Speaker 7:  and use, they, they literally use that as an example of how Google is not

1438
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:03,055
Speaker 7:  able to take care of its user's privacy. That's how bad Google Bus was. And

1439
01:27:03,055 --> 01:27:06,375
Speaker 7:  so Google this company that can't make a social network to save its life,

1440
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:10,295
Speaker 7:  Facebook is terrified, is gonna spend a bunch of money on WhatsApp, make

1441
01:27:10,295 --> 01:27:13,735
Speaker 7:  it cross-platform and take over the world with it. Because to your point,

1442
01:27:14,245 --> 01:27:18,215
Speaker 7:  they perceived messaging apps as the

1443
01:27:18,215 --> 01:27:21,935
Speaker 7:  future of how people interact with their friends and family. Which check,

1444
01:27:21,965 --> 01:27:25,855
Speaker 7:  correct. They won That was it, that was, that was exactly correct. The,

1445
01:27:25,915 --> 01:27:29,295
Speaker 7:  the group chat has taken over the Facebook feed in a real way

1446
01:27:30,195 --> 01:27:34,055
Speaker 7:  and they were worried about iMessage and the all of this stuff, right? They,

1447
01:27:34,055 --> 01:27:37,415
Speaker 7:  they looked at all the messaging apps out there and said, okay, we are the

1448
01:27:37,415 --> 01:27:40,375
Speaker 7:  place people hang out with their friends right now that is going to move

1449
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:44,335
Speaker 7:  to messaging apps. It's more private, it's, it's easier to administer. Like

1450
01:27:44,335 --> 01:27:48,175
Speaker 7:  there's just a lot of reasons for it. And they went and got

1451
01:27:48,455 --> 01:27:51,375
Speaker 7:  WhatsApp A because they understood that that was gonna work. B, because they

1452
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:54,975
Speaker 7:  understood that Facebook's own stuff, including Messenger was not gonna be

1453
01:27:55,135 --> 01:27:58,495
Speaker 7:  that. There's been some really interesting testimony from folks at Facebook

1454
01:27:58,495 --> 01:28:01,935
Speaker 7:  who were just like, messenger just wasn't that thing. It was popular, but

1455
01:28:01,935 --> 01:28:05,815
Speaker 7:  it just, it wasn't, it it wasn't gonna win. And then they

1456
01:28:05,815 --> 01:28:09,095
Speaker 7:  were, they were worried about what iMessage might be like. There were questions

1457
01:28:09,095 --> 01:28:12,615
Speaker 7:  inside of Facebook about whether Apple was going to turn on ads

1458
01:28:12,875 --> 01:28:16,495
Speaker 7:  and more social features inside of iMessage and

1459
01:28:16,495 --> 01:28:20,055
Speaker 7:  Apple's just like, we're not gonna do that. That's a stupid idea. We would

1460
01:28:20,055 --> 01:28:20,575
Speaker 7:  never do that.

1461
01:28:22,115 --> 01:28:25,655
Speaker 7:  But that, that's been the other thread of this is is the same thing

1462
01:28:26,045 --> 01:28:29,575
Speaker 7:  Mark Zuckerberg on Instagram, which is photo sharing is is

1463
01:28:29,835 --> 01:28:33,495
Speaker 7:  the way people are going to share going forward. And he was right about that.

1464
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:38,015
Speaker 7:  He was also right about messaging apps. And so now the question is, did

1465
01:28:38,915 --> 01:28:42,655
Speaker 7:  did Facebook sort of neuter WhatsApp by buying it or

1466
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:46,295
Speaker 7:  did it help it ascend to new heights? Which is the exact same question about

1467
01:28:46,295 --> 01:28:46,655
Speaker 7:  Instagram.

1468
01:28:47,005 --> 01:28:50,575
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I don't know man, it my, did you look at all these cases,

1469
01:28:52,215 --> 01:28:56,155
Speaker 5:  the end like apple's just first quarter of the year is like,

1470
01:28:56,155 --> 01:28:59,315
Speaker 5:  well, Apple's gonna be a whole different company. Google's gonna come out

1471
01:28:59,315 --> 01:29:02,645
Speaker 5:  of these cases. By the way, we haven't even talked about ad tech remedies

1472
01:29:02,645 --> 01:29:05,845
Speaker 5:  like that hasn't even started, right? You, you, you think Google will be

1473
01:29:05,845 --> 01:29:08,845
Speaker 5:  a different company if you pull apart search, wait until you gut the money.

1474
01:29:09,445 --> 01:29:12,045
Speaker 5:  Google's gonna end the year in a totally different place. Yeah. Meta might

1475
01:29:12,045 --> 01:29:15,045
Speaker 5:  end the year in a totally different place. Like we're in for a restructuring

1476
01:29:15,045 --> 01:29:16,085
Speaker 5:  of the internet. It's coming

1477
01:29:17,245 --> 01:29:17,535
Speaker 7:  Good.

1478
01:29:17,965 --> 01:29:21,175
Speaker 5:  Something's gonna happen. If you know what It is by, by all means tell me.

1479
01:29:21,215 --> 01:29:24,335
Speaker 5:  I I think it's party speakers. It's,

1480
01:29:25,525 --> 01:29:28,255
Speaker 5:  it's something. Something's something's up. You can feel it in the air. It

1481
01:29:28,255 --> 01:29:31,095
Speaker 5:  should be exciting. It's weird. Like so much other stuff is so foreboding

1482
01:29:32,195 --> 01:29:35,125
Speaker 5:  that I think this feels foreboding, but it's, I think it's actually exciting.

1483
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:39,075
Speaker 5:  Like there's space, these companies

1484
01:29:39,075 --> 01:29:42,675
Speaker 5:  under all this pressure is going to create space. Yeah. Other people are

1485
01:29:42,675 --> 01:29:43,155
Speaker 5:  gonna build stuff.

1486
01:29:43,335 --> 01:29:46,475
Speaker 7:  You look at what happened at the Microsoft case and it's like a, because

1487
01:29:46,475 --> 01:29:49,235
Speaker 7:  of the Microsoft case, we got Google. Like that's, that's just a thing that

1488
01:29:49,395 --> 01:29:52,795
Speaker 7:  happened, right? And we're, we're now doing that at greater scale

1489
01:29:53,345 --> 01:29:57,195
Speaker 7:  with a bunch of different companies all at once. And it's, it,

1490
01:29:57,195 --> 01:30:00,915
Speaker 7:  we're doing it at a very weird economic moment. So I think like

1491
01:30:02,025 --> 01:30:05,635
Speaker 7:  this is ordinarily a time that you would see venture capitalists just like

1492
01:30:05,635 --> 01:30:08,275
Speaker 7:  falling all over themselves to invest in everything everywhere. Because suddenly

1493
01:30:08,275 --> 01:30:10,635
Speaker 7:  there's, it feels like there might be space in tons of these markets for

1494
01:30:10,635 --> 01:30:13,595
Speaker 7:  the first time. That's not happening because they're all in group chats being

1495
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,835
Speaker 7:  weirdos with each other. They've

1496
01:30:15,955 --> 01:30:19,915
Speaker 5:  Got dumber ideas. One of the, one of the answers regulators

1497
01:30:20,075 --> 01:30:23,515
Speaker 5:  I talked to yesterday said, VCs have hated Apple for so long.

1498
01:30:23,895 --> 01:30:26,035
Speaker 5:  It is only a matter of time before the money starts falling.

1499
01:30:26,715 --> 01:30:28,955
Speaker 7:  I, I believe it. I mean there's so much there.

1500
01:30:30,015 --> 01:30:33,675
Speaker 5:  So we'll see. We'll see. I'm just saying it's all this stuff is happening

1501
01:30:33,675 --> 01:30:36,915
Speaker 5:  and you can argue about the, the individual twists and turns,

1502
01:30:37,815 --> 01:30:41,195
Speaker 5:  but this is the stuff that creates space for new companies and honestly It

1503
01:30:41,195 --> 01:30:44,315
Speaker 5:  is a little exciting. Yeah. Alright, we gotta take a break. We're gonna run

1504
01:30:44,315 --> 01:30:46,075
Speaker 5:  through this sliding round. It's gonna happen. We'll be right back.

1505
01:32:22,985 --> 01:32:24,505
Speaker 5:  can't just podcast with you. Clowns forever.

1506
01:32:26,485 --> 01:32:30,345
Speaker 5:  We got party speakers to find exactly. Can someone invent a metal

1507
01:32:30,585 --> 01:32:34,385
Speaker 5:  detector for party speakers? Think about my Navy ship is leaving soon, so

1508
01:32:34,385 --> 01:32:37,825
Speaker 5:  I have to finish this podcast. Please, please. More enlisted service members

1509
01:32:38,055 --> 01:32:41,945
Speaker 5:  send us photos. Neli, is It, is it time? It's the lightning round. But is

1510
01:32:41,945 --> 01:32:45,545
Speaker 5:  It, is it once again that time for America's? It's time. It's time. Okay.

1511
01:32:45,565 --> 01:32:49,145
Speaker 5:  It is time for America's favorite non-food podcast

1512
01:32:49,245 --> 01:32:52,945
Speaker 5:  within a podcast that I feel I can say comfortably. Award-winning,

1513
01:32:53,525 --> 01:32:56,745
Speaker 5:  future award. A word for composed award-winning

1514
01:32:57,455 --> 01:33:01,425
Speaker 5:  podcast in a podcast. Brendan right is dummy. Alright,

1515
01:33:01,525 --> 01:33:05,385
Speaker 5:  so a a quiet, another quiet week for Brendan. He did

1516
01:33:05,385 --> 01:33:08,865
Speaker 5:  congratulate himself a lot. So you, we, we just hit a hundred days of the

1517
01:33:08,865 --> 01:33:09,505
Speaker 5:  Trump administration.

1518
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:14,965
Speaker 5:  Brenda put out a tweet with just a list of things that he says he's

1519
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:18,685
Speaker 5:  accomplished. He, Brendan believes that he strengthened national security

1520
01:33:18,685 --> 01:33:21,685
Speaker 5:  in advanced public safety. He believes he is protected consumers and

1521
01:33:22,565 --> 01:33:25,445
Speaker 5:  expanded America's space economy. Brendan all by himself is that Brendan's

1522
01:33:25,445 --> 01:33:29,125
Speaker 5:  job. He's unleashed high speed infrastructure. He's restored our leadership

1523
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:32,325
Speaker 5:  in wireless, which as you know, is under constant

1524
01:33:32,555 --> 01:33:35,645
Speaker 5:  existential threat if you don't

1525
01:33:36,115 --> 01:33:39,485
Speaker 5:  upgrade the 5G network. Something China.

1526
01:33:39,945 --> 01:33:43,765
Speaker 5:  Yep. It's just there, it's just in the background all the time. And you know,

1527
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:47,045
Speaker 5:  he says he is restored free speech. So it's a long list. You can, we will

1528
01:33:47,045 --> 01:33:47,725
Speaker 5:  link it. It's a tweet,

1529
01:33:49,985 --> 01:33:53,965
Speaker 5:  you know, under restoring free speech, he claims that he has joined DOJ Assistant

1530
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:58,085
Speaker 5:  Attorney General Slater and FCC Chairman Ferguson to launch a campaign

1531
01:33:58,105 --> 01:34:01,965
Speaker 5:  to smash the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights, which

1532
01:34:01,965 --> 01:34:05,565
Speaker 5:  means sending threatening letters from the government about other people's

1533
01:34:05,565 --> 01:34:09,245
Speaker 5:  speech and just upside down world all over the place with Brendan.

1534
01:34:09,345 --> 01:34:13,165
Speaker 5:  So Brendan's very proud of, it's a very Trumpian, everything he says

1535
01:34:13,165 --> 01:34:16,765
Speaker 5:  is a thing that he didn't do. Yeah. And a lot of it's just stuff the Ft C

1536
01:34:16,765 --> 01:34:19,085
Speaker 5:  does. Like, he's like, we did a spectrum option. It's like, yeah, it was

1537
01:34:19,085 --> 01:34:23,045
Speaker 5:  Tuesday at the FEC. Great. What I wanna call it this week is we,

1538
01:34:23,045 --> 01:34:26,645
Speaker 5:  there's a bunch of other hundred days coverage of Brendan that we should

1539
01:34:26,645 --> 01:34:29,965
Speaker 5:  call out. We did big piece Carl Bode, who we love working with,

1540
01:34:30,555 --> 01:34:34,485
Speaker 5:  just ran down all the stuff Brandon has done. It's basically familiar, I

1541
01:34:34,485 --> 01:34:38,045
Speaker 5:  think to Vergecast listeners, particularly listeners of America's favorite

1542
01:34:38,045 --> 01:34:41,525
Speaker 5:  podcast on the podcast. Brandon Carl dummy. That piece is great. Carl is

1543
01:34:41,565 --> 01:34:45,365
Speaker 5:  a ferocious writer. He has been the model for how I

1544
01:34:45,365 --> 01:34:48,885
Speaker 5:  think about writing for consumer advocacy and consumer rights for a long

1545
01:34:48,885 --> 01:34:52,765
Speaker 5:  time. He just did a great job. So go read that piece. I also wanna call out

1546
01:34:53,215 --> 01:34:56,805
Speaker 5:  other people have started taking note of Ren in real meaningful ways.

1547
01:34:57,345 --> 01:35:01,285
Speaker 5:  So Fire, which is a free speech advocacy organization, not

1548
01:35:01,285 --> 01:35:03,845
Speaker 5:  without its own controversies that has a strong point of view in what cases

1549
01:35:03,845 --> 01:35:06,485
Speaker 5:  it takes and doesn't take people a lot of feelings about it. You might almost

1550
01:35:06,485 --> 01:35:10,005
Speaker 5:  call it the more conservative, free speech advocacy organization. I wouldn't

1551
01:35:10,005 --> 01:35:13,685
Speaker 5:  go that far, but some people do. They have a long piece about how

1552
01:35:13,755 --> 01:35:14,605
Speaker 5:  Brendan sucks.

1553
01:35:16,395 --> 01:35:19,965
Speaker 5:  Like just Straightforwardly Fire published a piece called Brendan

1554
01:35:20,025 --> 01:35:23,445
Speaker 5:  Carr's bizaro world FCC. They have a cartoon of him

1555
01:35:23,755 --> 01:35:27,725
Speaker 5:  with a backwards FCC logo dressed up like, like Bizaro superman.

1556
01:35:27,905 --> 01:35:31,045
Speaker 5:  And the caption of the cartoon, Brendan is saying the FCC should operate

1557
01:35:31,045 --> 01:35:33,845
Speaker 5:  as the nation's speech police that we're just gonna link it

1558
01:35:34,445 --> 01:35:36,085
Speaker 7:  Full on the nose. But you know, it's

1559
01:35:36,085 --> 01:35:39,125
Speaker 5:  A little on the nose. Yeah, but it's not just us screaming it. Right? It

1560
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:42,625
Speaker 5:  It is some of our nation's preeminent free speech

1561
01:35:42,855 --> 01:35:46,745
Speaker 5:  organizations, some of which, like, I'm, I'm pointing this out just to

1562
01:35:46,745 --> 01:35:50,105
Speaker 5:  point it out, are not always aligned with what people think my politics are.

1563
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:53,725
Speaker 5:  Although I think my politics are basically like, free markets are good and

1564
01:35:53,725 --> 01:35:57,605
Speaker 5:  don't be racist, which aren't exactly communists, but whatever, whatever

1565
01:35:57,605 --> 01:35:58,445
Speaker 5:  you think my politics are,

1566
01:36:00,395 --> 01:36:04,005
Speaker 5:  they don't always align with some of these groups. So racism is bad. They

1567
01:36:04,005 --> 01:36:04,805
Speaker 5:  call me Uncle Woke.

1568
01:36:05,065 --> 01:36:07,645
Speaker 7:  You just said like eight things that people are gonna make us put on T-shirts.

1569
01:36:07,645 --> 01:36:11,405
Speaker 7:  Now I just want you to know that including they call me Uncle Woke. That's,

1570
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:14,605
Speaker 7:  that's a, that's just everyone who's listening. Please know. I will make

1571
01:36:14,605 --> 01:36:15,045
Speaker 7:  that t-shirt.

1572
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:19,245
Speaker 5:  Like what, what It's, so I get these notes, like I did the piece

1573
01:36:19,245 --> 01:36:22,685
Speaker 5:  about calling Jeff Bezos a coward. I got to the most bananas emails of all

1574
01:36:22,685 --> 01:36:26,285
Speaker 5:  time just like calling me like literally like,

1575
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:30,205
Speaker 5:  you are a communist. And I was like, the only political opinions I've really

1576
01:36:30,205 --> 01:36:33,085
Speaker 5:  expressed consistently are like, free markets are good

1577
01:36:34,075 --> 01:36:37,805
Speaker 5:  competition makes better products. Like what do you want from me? Exactly.

1578
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:41,165
Speaker 5:  And the answer is state regulated speech.

1579
01:36:42,545 --> 01:36:45,915
Speaker 5:  Clearly the LA Times is a good piece about Brendan running down all the things

1580
01:36:45,915 --> 01:36:49,595
Speaker 5:  he's done. So the coverage is out there. It's not just us. It's not just

1581
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:53,435
Speaker 5:  me Uncle woke. But as always, I wanna end Brendan Carr as a

1582
01:36:53,435 --> 01:36:57,155
Speaker 5:  dummy by saying, Brendan, I know you listen, I know you love

1583
01:36:57,155 --> 01:37:01,065
Speaker 5:  attention. You do. You, you, you live for it. Come

1584
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:01,945
Speaker 5:  on the show, man.

1585
01:37:03,525 --> 01:37:06,865
Speaker 5:  If you can defend any of this crap, you should do it. You should make the

1586
01:37:07,065 --> 01:37:10,705
Speaker 5:  argument, you should say the words out loud to me and then win. Don't you

1587
01:37:10,705 --> 01:37:14,665
Speaker 5:  wanna win? Brandon? Don't you wanna collect this trophy from me? I'll,

1588
01:37:14,695 --> 01:37:17,345
Speaker 5:  I'll make you a trophy if you win that debate and you can have it, you could

1589
01:37:17,345 --> 01:37:21,305
Speaker 5:  tweet about it, you could show it to your buddy Elon, the offers in

1590
01:37:21,305 --> 01:37:25,055
Speaker 5:  front of you. I just, I don't think you can do it. So

1591
01:37:25,595 --> 01:37:28,215
Speaker 5:  as always, Brendan, I think you're a dummy, but you are welcome on decoder.

1592
01:37:28,215 --> 01:37:31,455
Speaker 5:  You're welcome on The Vergecast. You're welcome to one of those, you know

1593
01:37:31,455 --> 01:37:34,295
Speaker 5:  those things I do on YouTube now where like 20 kids wave flags of people

1594
01:37:34,295 --> 01:37:38,225
Speaker 5:  sitting in the center. We'll do that. Let's go. I don't think

1595
01:37:38,225 --> 01:37:40,905
Speaker 5:  you will. 'cause I think you're a dummy and I think you know that you can't

1596
01:37:40,905 --> 01:37:43,865
Speaker 5:  win. As always, this has been, Brendan Carr is a dummy America's favorite

1597
01:37:43,865 --> 01:37:44,825
Speaker 5:  podcast. Within the podcast,

1598
01:37:45,085 --> 01:37:48,825
Speaker 7:  TikTok Trends with Brendan Carr is very clearly a podcast

1599
01:37:49,005 --> 01:37:51,585
Speaker 7:  we need to launch. So Brendan, Brendan, get at us.

1600
01:37:51,645 --> 01:37:55,595
Speaker 5:  What's that? It's, what's it called? P Polonium. But

1601
01:37:55,615 --> 01:37:56,155
Speaker 5:  you know what I'm

1602
01:37:56,155 --> 01:37:58,195
Speaker 6:  Talking about. It's like Jubilee. Jubilee. Is that it?

1603
01:37:58,255 --> 01:38:01,275
Speaker 5:  Oh, by the way, if any, if there's any like young reporters out there who

1604
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:04,875
Speaker 5:  wanna to profile Jubilee email us. I'm fascinated by this

1605
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:08,435
Speaker 5:  entire situation. Whatever is going on, there is some of the

1606
01:38:08,475 --> 01:38:12,405
Speaker 5:  weirdest new media that has ever existed. And I, I

1607
01:38:12,405 --> 01:38:16,085
Speaker 5:  don't understand how any of it works. I would like to know more. Do you want

1608
01:38:16,085 --> 01:38:18,005
Speaker 5:  to write a feature? Send us pitch.

1609
01:38:18,745 --> 01:38:22,235
Speaker 7:  Love this. Jake, I, I need, I have a favorite to ask.

1610
01:38:23,595 --> 01:38:27,195
Speaker 7:  I put a story that Alex Heath wrote about world coin in our

1611
01:38:27,265 --> 01:38:30,675
Speaker 7:  rundown, and I didn't read it because I refuse to learn anything about world

1612
01:38:30,675 --> 01:38:34,075
Speaker 7:  coin. So can you explain it, David, while I don't pay

1613
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:37,985
Speaker 6:  Attention, David, I was worried for, for folks who, who are

1614
01:38:38,185 --> 01:38:42,145
Speaker 6:  watching at home, we, David just drops a gigantic document with a bunch

1615
01:38:42,145 --> 01:38:45,905
Speaker 6:  of stories that we may or may not discuss. I try my best

1616
01:38:45,925 --> 01:38:48,815
Speaker 6:  to prep for all of them. World coin is so

1617
01:38:49,135 --> 01:38:52,535
Speaker 6:  inexplicable. I I spoke

1618
01:38:53,015 --> 01:38:56,615
Speaker 6:  repeatedly with Alex Heath about this story. I've read this story,

1619
01:38:56,975 --> 01:39:00,495
Speaker 6:  I edited this story. I still cannot truly explain

1620
01:39:01,245 --> 01:39:05,215
Speaker 6:  what world Coin is, why it exists or what it's doing. It re

1621
01:39:05,555 --> 01:39:09,135
Speaker 6:  the, the, the main news, the, this is the, the, the

1622
01:39:09,365 --> 01:39:11,495
Speaker 6:  eyeball scanning startup, Sam

1623
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:13,775
Speaker 5:  Altman from Samal, from eyeball scanning startup. It

1624
01:39:13,775 --> 01:39:14,215
Speaker 7:  Has an, it's

1625
01:39:14,215 --> 01:39:17,975
Speaker 6:  An orb. They have an orb. Yeah. Scans your eyes, puts you on the blockchain

1626
01:39:18,235 --> 01:39:21,855
Speaker 6:  and that validates your id. Here's the most important thing.

1627
01:39:23,145 --> 01:39:27,125
Speaker 6:  You can now verify yourself on Tinder by getting your

1628
01:39:27,205 --> 01:39:30,245
Speaker 6:  eyeballs scanned by Sam Altman. Yep. And

1629
01:39:31,015 --> 01:39:34,745
Speaker 6:  when you're swiping through Tinder, that's either gonna be a clear

1630
01:39:35,245 --> 01:39:39,065
Speaker 6:  way to know that somebody is or is not a match for you. So I think that's

1631
01:39:39,065 --> 01:39:41,905
Speaker 6:  a big upgrade. The main, the the actual news is they're bringing it to the

1632
01:39:41,905 --> 01:39:45,785
Speaker 6:  US for the first time. It's, it's legal in most states.

1633
01:39:46,285 --> 01:39:49,225
Speaker 6:  Not all of them, but they're bringing it to the us. You can now get your

1634
01:39:49,225 --> 01:39:52,545
Speaker 6:  eyeballs scanned, you can now get on the blockchain. You can now get some

1635
01:39:52,545 --> 01:39:53,625
Speaker 6:  of the world coin.

1636
01:39:55,425 --> 01:39:59,345
Speaker 6:  I think the idea is that this is somehow going to

1637
01:39:59,345 --> 01:40:02,585
Speaker 6:  help authenticate humans. Yeah. As being humans

1638
01:40:03,485 --> 01:40:07,385
Speaker 6:  in a world of AI nonsense happening on the internet. I'm not

1639
01:40:07,385 --> 01:40:11,065
Speaker 6:  quite sure where the crypto coin comes in. That

1640
01:40:11,065 --> 01:40:14,665
Speaker 6:  still feels a little like fuzzy magic. It'll be worth value

1641
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:18,105
Speaker 6:  somehow. But yeah, the main, the main thing is they have brought it to the

1642
01:40:18,105 --> 01:40:21,905
Speaker 6:  us now they're opening some stores. You'll be able to go to razor stores

1643
01:40:22,405 --> 01:40:25,465
Speaker 6:  and while you're shopping for gaming accessories, you can get your eyeballs

1644
01:40:25,465 --> 01:40:29,345
Speaker 6:  scanned and get on the blockchain. I would say everything about this

1645
01:40:30,315 --> 01:40:34,105
Speaker 6:  feels like Mad Libs. I, I, I still

1646
01:40:34,935 --> 01:40:38,905
Speaker 6:  like, I'm not sure how this all came together. I'm not sure how

1647
01:40:38,905 --> 01:40:40,705
Speaker 6:  they decided to partner with Tinder. Well,

1648
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:44,665
Speaker 5:  'cause they, they need off providers or they need to prove that being

1649
01:40:44,665 --> 01:40:48,625
Speaker 5:  an off provider is useful to someone. So you're, you go, you're, you

1650
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:51,945
Speaker 5:  know, like you're worried about getting catfished on Tinder and you're like,

1651
01:40:52,085 --> 01:40:55,525
Speaker 5:  you know what? That's an eyeball skin. That's a real person. Mm.

1652
01:40:55,975 --> 01:40:57,285
Speaker 6:  These eyeballs match. Yeah.

1653
01:40:57,315 --> 01:41:01,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's like a, it's like they, they look, they did this announcement

1654
01:41:01,045 --> 01:41:04,765
Speaker 5:  in San Francisco, Alex Heath went, lots of people went. Yeah.

1655
01:41:04,825 --> 01:41:07,925
Speaker 5:  Sam Hunt was there. People wanna be there. The real quotes about all of this

1656
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:11,805
Speaker 5:  came at a previous event that they had last October

1657
01:41:12,715 --> 01:41:13,205
Speaker 5:  because

1658
01:41:14,865 --> 01:41:18,835
Speaker 5:  like any startup, they need scale. Like they need people to scan their

1659
01:41:18,835 --> 01:41:22,075
Speaker 5:  eyeballs to make everything work. And so they're announcing in the us which

1660
01:41:22,075 --> 01:41:25,275
Speaker 5:  will get them scale. But I just wanna read this quote from last year

1661
01:41:26,335 --> 01:41:30,195
Speaker 5:  to provide access to every human. We need more orbs, lots more

1662
01:41:30,465 --> 01:41:34,355
Speaker 5:  orbs, probably on the order of a thousand times more orbs than

1663
01:41:34,355 --> 01:41:38,155
Speaker 5:  we have today. Not more orbs, but more orbs in

1664
01:41:38,155 --> 01:41:38,635
Speaker 5:  more places.

1665
01:41:40,575 --> 01:41:44,185
Speaker 5:  Then they're launching a service called Orb on

1666
01:41:44,185 --> 01:41:48,065
Speaker 5:  Demand that will let people order orbs. Much like a pizza

1667
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:51,625
Speaker 5:  you would have delivered to your apartment. So you can push a button

1668
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:55,825
Speaker 5:  and someone with an orb will come to your apartment, scan your

1669
01:41:55,825 --> 01:41:56,065
Speaker 5:  eyes.

1670
01:41:59,365 --> 01:42:02,965
Speaker 5:  I can't, it's, it's so silly. I love it. I

1671
01:42:02,965 --> 01:42:06,005
Speaker 7:  Love it. This is all completely vindicated, my total uninterest in knowing

1672
01:42:06,285 --> 01:42:07,005
Speaker 7:  anything about this story.

1673
01:42:07,565 --> 01:42:11,365
Speaker 5:  I love it. Look the world soon our social networks will be full of weird

1674
01:42:11,545 --> 01:42:14,125
Speaker 5:  AI avatars all trying to bone you and marry Kevin Rus.

1675
01:42:16,185 --> 01:42:18,805
Speaker 5:  And I will prove I knew. And you're gonna have to push the orb button and

1676
01:42:18,805 --> 01:42:22,645
Speaker 5:  have an orb show up at your house and verify that

1677
01:42:22,645 --> 01:42:26,525
Speaker 5:  it's actually you who is deeply in love with Kevin and not some rogue

1678
01:42:26,705 --> 01:42:26,925
Speaker 5:  ai.

1679
01:42:27,825 --> 01:42:31,765
Speaker 7:  And It is me, Kevin, you're listening. Get at me. I'm right

1680
01:42:31,765 --> 01:42:33,085
Speaker 7:  here. I've been right here

1681
01:42:33,085 --> 01:42:36,435
Speaker 5:  All along. It's very good. It's very good. All right. Should we do like one

1682
01:42:36,435 --> 01:42:36,715
Speaker 5:  or two more?

1683
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:37,475
Speaker 7:  Yeah, let's do

1684
01:42:37,475 --> 01:42:40,395
Speaker 5:  One or two more. We need like a pallet cleanser. I would say We need more

1685
01:42:40,465 --> 01:42:42,995
Speaker 5:  orbs. A thousand times more orbs is a good palate cleanser.

1686
01:42:43,365 --> 01:42:46,795
Speaker 7:  Let's, let's do, let's do the Trump thing really fast just so you can take

1687
01:42:46,795 --> 01:42:47,675
Speaker 7:  another cover.

1688
01:42:48,035 --> 01:42:48,995
Speaker 5:  I said pallet cleanser, man. Wait,

1689
01:42:49,585 --> 01:42:53,275
Speaker 6:  Wait. Can I talk about some more AI nonsense? Yes. There's this, so meta

1690
01:42:53,955 --> 01:42:57,875
Speaker 6:  launched a meta AI app, and it, it has a social

1691
01:42:58,105 --> 01:43:02,075
Speaker 6:  feed of things. People are just sharing their AI prompts.

1692
01:43:02,215 --> 01:43:05,795
Speaker 6:  So you can have a conversation with Meta's ai and it'll just post the transcript.

1693
01:43:05,795 --> 01:43:09,475
Speaker 6:  You'll be talking to it. You can hear somebody say like, Hey, what kind of

1694
01:43:09,595 --> 01:43:12,995
Speaker 6:  crackers should I eat today? And then the AI just is like, oh, maybe you

1695
01:43:12,995 --> 01:43:16,715
Speaker 6:  could try a whole grain. And they're like, I don't think so. It is,

1696
01:43:16,955 --> 01:43:19,875
Speaker 6:  I I, I think the idea is to give people an idea of what they're supposed

1697
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:23,635
Speaker 6:  to do with ai. I have to tell you, this is the single strongest

1698
01:43:23,995 --> 01:43:27,915
Speaker 6:  argument against AI that I have seen yet. If you scroll through this feed,

1699
01:43:27,975 --> 01:43:31,875
Speaker 6:  It is just like total nonsense, nonstop. It is incredible.

1700
01:43:33,155 --> 01:43:33,875
Speaker 6:  I can't look away.

1701
01:43:34,225 --> 01:43:34,515
Speaker 7:  It's

1702
01:43:34,515 --> 01:43:38,275
Speaker 5:  Awful. I mean, that's what they want, right? Is I wanna see

1703
01:43:38,275 --> 01:43:42,115
Speaker 5:  what, how somebody has Joe Broken meta ai. You know, mark Ser gave an

1704
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:45,955
Speaker 5:  interview that Ben Thompson, I think he came out today as we were recording,

1705
01:43:47,215 --> 01:43:51,035
Speaker 5:  and he says explicitly the thing we were talking about a couple

1706
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:54,325
Speaker 5:  weeks ago. He says, the future of Met

1707
01:43:54,945 --> 01:43:58,165
Speaker 5:  Ben asked Mark, like, what do you wanna do with ai? And Mark is like, yeah,

1708
01:43:58,205 --> 01:44:01,325
Speaker 5:  I wanna do better ad targeting, obviously, you know, we wanna help people

1709
01:44:01,325 --> 01:44:04,325
Speaker 5:  make more content, you know, feeds full of AI content, all this stuff. And

1710
01:44:04,325 --> 01:44:07,365
Speaker 5:  he says this thing in the middle where he's like, eventually we're gonna

1711
01:44:07,365 --> 01:44:11,245
Speaker 5:  make the ads for advertisers and you're just gonna connect to your bank account

1712
01:44:11,265 --> 01:44:14,565
Speaker 5:  and tell us what business outcomes you want. And then we'll, we'll just like,

1713
01:44:14,565 --> 01:44:17,365
Speaker 5:  deliver you results. Like we'll just have sold your products for you, which

1714
01:44:17,365 --> 01:44:20,245
Speaker 5:  means they're gonna like, make videos of your products with ai, write the

1715
01:44:20,245 --> 01:44:21,725
Speaker 5:  copy with ai,

1716
01:44:23,805 --> 01:44:27,505
Speaker 5:  generate infinite amounts of creative with ai. Like

1717
01:44:27,885 --> 01:44:31,665
Speaker 5:  you're just gonna, it's like literally a black box. Like you give them some

1718
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:34,545
Speaker 5:  money, they make an advertising campaign, and then some of your products

1719
01:44:34,545 --> 01:44:38,065
Speaker 5:  get sold. And that's his literally his vision for the future of ai.

1720
01:44:38,135 --> 01:44:41,825
Speaker 7:  It's so funny to put that next to the thing that meta

1721
01:44:41,825 --> 01:44:45,025
Speaker 7:  executives have been saying for a while, which is that like a lot of people

1722
01:44:45,165 --> 01:44:48,705
Speaker 7:  go to these services and appreciate the ads as content.

1723
01:44:49,165 --> 01:44:52,665
Speaker 7:  And it's like, there, there just is this belief that actually what people

1724
01:44:52,665 --> 01:44:56,585
Speaker 7:  really want is AI made stuff like that, that is like a cultural

1725
01:44:56,715 --> 01:45:00,665
Speaker 7:  value at meta. That AI stuff is good and people will like

1726
01:45:00,665 --> 01:45:04,545
Speaker 7:  it. And I see no evidence of that fact in the

1727
01:45:04,605 --> 01:45:06,025
Speaker 7:  actual real world.

1728
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:10,305
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Are you tell us what your objective is. You connect to your bank account.

1729
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:13,345
Speaker 5:  You don't need any creative, you don't need any targeting demographics, you

1730
01:45:13,345 --> 01:45:15,985
Speaker 5:  don't need any measurement except you're able to read the results that we

1731
01:45:15,985 --> 01:45:19,935
Speaker 5:  spit out. And it's like, you know, you guys have a, have a lot of

1732
01:45:19,935 --> 01:45:23,695
Speaker 5:  like ad fraud scandals. Like you're, you kind of famous for inflating the

1733
01:45:23,695 --> 01:45:24,935
Speaker 5:  metrics like that. Give

1734
01:45:24,935 --> 01:45:27,655
Speaker 7:  Us a lot of money and trust us, we're Facebook what could possibly go wrong.

1735
01:45:28,335 --> 01:45:31,775
Speaker 5:  I wrote a story about this. I emailed some media people, some ad agency people.

1736
01:45:32,635 --> 01:45:35,455
Speaker 5:  I'm just gonna read this quote. This is a re return. I said, can you respond

1737
01:45:35,455 --> 01:45:39,375
Speaker 5:  to this? One person said, I've reacted pretty viscerally to this.

1738
01:45:39,495 --> 01:45:43,415
Speaker 5:  I need a moment to say something smart, which is incredible. And

1739
01:45:43,495 --> 01:45:46,535
Speaker 5:  another person did not take the time and they just said,

1740
01:45:47,655 --> 01:45:51,605
Speaker 5:  quote, read the results that we spit out is gold the full cycle towards their

1741
01:45:51,765 --> 01:45:55,645
Speaker 5:  customers from moderate condescension to active antagonism to we'll

1742
01:45:55,645 --> 01:45:56,365
Speaker 5:  fucking kill you.

1743
01:45:56,865 --> 01:45:57,355
Speaker 7:  Perfect.

1744
01:45:57,585 --> 01:46:01,315
Speaker 5:  Perfect. So I, I suspect there's a, a war coming between meta

1745
01:46:01,375 --> 01:46:05,155
Speaker 5:  and the a industry. They're not happy with it. All right. A pallet

1746
01:46:05,155 --> 01:46:08,915
Speaker 5:  cleanser. Just to end it on like the nerdiest note. I can end it on. In a

1747
01:46:08,915 --> 01:46:11,115
Speaker 5:  happy note. LG has spent 20 years

1748
01:46:12,535 --> 01:46:16,515
Speaker 5:  trying to make ole panels with blue phosphorescent backlights.

1749
01:46:17,055 --> 01:46:20,875
Speaker 5:  It says it's ready to manufacture tandem panels that use both fluorescence

1750
01:46:20,935 --> 01:46:24,835
Speaker 5:  and phosphorescence. This will bring power conduct down by 15%.

1751
01:46:25,575 --> 01:46:27,265
Speaker 5:  There's nothing that makes me happier.

1752
01:46:27,695 --> 01:46:30,625
Speaker 7:  None of what you just said sounds like words to me. We're happy about this.

1753
01:46:30,735 --> 01:46:31,305
Speaker 7:  This is good.

1754
01:46:31,355 --> 01:46:35,305
Speaker 5:  Everything about the future is, is predicted first by

1755
01:46:35,305 --> 01:46:38,405
Speaker 5:  what happens in display technology. It's absolutely true,

1756
01:46:39,605 --> 01:46:43,075
Speaker 5:  right? You can't get curved phones or folding phones without curved or

1757
01:46:43,405 --> 01:46:47,395
Speaker 5:  bendy OLED panels. You couldn't make smartphones without thin LCDs with low

1758
01:46:47,395 --> 01:46:50,885
Speaker 5:  power draw. You, you couldn't make laptops with CRTs,

1759
01:46:51,645 --> 01:46:55,485
Speaker 5:  although some people did try. You. You see what

1760
01:46:55,485 --> 01:46:58,605
Speaker 5:  I'm saying? You, you can look ahead to what the display industry is doing.

1761
01:46:58,665 --> 01:47:02,435
Speaker 5:  You can predict the future. And I'm just saying

1762
01:47:02,435 --> 01:47:05,755
Speaker 5:  20 years in the making, slightly thinner, brighter, better.

1763
01:47:06,215 --> 01:47:07,875
Speaker 5:  Oh, adss are coming and something will happen.

1764
01:47:08,305 --> 01:47:11,355
Speaker 7:  That is exciting. I'm into that. See, I've been doing a lot of research on

1765
01:47:11,355 --> 01:47:15,275
Speaker 7:  the Sony Watchman from the eighties recently for a project that will become

1766
01:47:15,275 --> 01:47:17,355
Speaker 7:  very clear to everyone later this year.

1767
01:47:19,165 --> 01:47:23,065
Speaker 7:  And the, the like enthusiasm for a slightly different

1768
01:47:23,065 --> 01:47:26,425
Speaker 7:  take on A CRT. Unbelievable. Yeah. People were freaking out. They were like,

1769
01:47:26,425 --> 01:47:29,785
Speaker 7:  they made the CRT this big instead of this big. It's gonna change everything.

1770
01:47:30,445 --> 01:47:33,745
Speaker 5:  It didn't, I'm just saying people react mostly to what things look like and

1771
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:37,465
Speaker 5:  the, the way you change things, how things look like, you change the display

1772
01:47:37,465 --> 01:47:41,305
Speaker 5:  technology. So if you pay attention to that, you will know what things are

1773
01:47:41,305 --> 01:47:43,985
Speaker 5:  gonna look like then. Then you know the future. And you don't need an orb

1774
01:47:43,985 --> 01:47:44,225
Speaker 5:  to do it.

1775
01:47:46,445 --> 01:47:50,385
Speaker 5:  We need more orbs, a thousand times more orbs. That's it. That's

1776
01:47:50,385 --> 01:47:51,345
Speaker 5:  The Vergecast Rock and roll.

1777
