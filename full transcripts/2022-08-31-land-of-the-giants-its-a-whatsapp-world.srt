00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,870
Speaker 1:  Welcome to the Vergecast the flagship podcast of unattractive messaging apps.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,680
Speaker 1:  I'm your friend, David Pierce. And we are technically off today, but I wanted

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,640
Speaker 1:  to play you instead of just not having an episode, an episode of a

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,610
Speaker 1:  podcast called land of the giants, which hopefully you're listening to. But

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,420
Speaker 1:  if not this season, the land of the giants is all about Facebook

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,170
Speaker 1:  and meta. The show is a collaboration between Recode and the verge and Shereen

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,770
Speaker 1:  Ghafari and Alex, Keith have been exploring how Facebook

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,700
Speaker 1:  eventually Metta have changed the way that we live our lives, both on and

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,300
Speaker 1:  off the internet. The last episode of the season dropped today. The whole

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,150
Speaker 1:  series is great. You should listen to all of it, but I wanted to play you

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,060
Speaker 1:  an episode. That's actually the second to last episode in the season, all

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,450
Speaker 1:  about WhatsApp. WhatsApp is absolutely fascinating. It's

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,260
Speaker 1:  massive. And it changes the way that people live their lives

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,950
Speaker 1:  in ways. Many of us, especially in the U S where WhatsApp is not as popular,

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,980
Speaker 1:  don't even understand. So again, you should listen to the whole series, but

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,970
Speaker 1:  I think this episode stands pretty well on its own. This is land at the giants

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,380
Speaker 3:  You probably don't remember where you were on

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,270
Speaker 3:  October 4th, 2021,

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,560
Speaker 4:  Tonight, major outages affecting billions of users of Facebook,

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,520
Speaker 4:  Instagram, and WhatsApp. All of it starting this morning and continuing through

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,000
Speaker 4:  the day,

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,290
Speaker 5:  All three apps went offline at the same time around the world.

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,460
Speaker 3:  Inconvenience doom. Scroller is on Facebook and Instagram switched over to

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,330
Speaker 3:  other platforms so much so that the official Twitter account tweeted out.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,340
Speaker 3:  Hello, literally everyone,

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,210
Speaker 5:  But for Rajiv, Kira WhatsApp going down was a much bigger

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:38,870
Speaker 5:  deal. We

29
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,090
Speaker 6:  Never, we don't for so long.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,140
Speaker 3:  The official shutdown lasted for about six hours, but the effects

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,980
Speaker 3:  lingered in a few places, such as India, which meant

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,940
Speaker 3:  enormous consequences for people like Kira. WhatsApp is his

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,570
Speaker 3:  livelihood.

34
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,620
Speaker 5:  He founded a food tech business called Chucky piecing outside new Delhi,

35
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,550
Speaker 5:  India that delivers freshly milled flour and spices to people. And

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,510
Speaker 5:  he runs it primarily on WhatsApp. That's where he lists available items

37
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,030
Speaker 5:  chats with customers, processes orders.

38
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,150
Speaker 6:  Well, 70, 80% of our business was done.

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,550
Speaker 3:  Kierra was not alone. About 15 million businesses run on

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,570
Speaker 3:  WhatsApp in India.

41
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,620
Speaker 6:  And even today to be very honest, we don't have an alternative, which can

42
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,200
Speaker 6:  a hundred percent replace whatsoever. There is a downtime

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,910
Speaker 3:  In India. WhatsApp is more than a private messaging service.

44
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,630
Speaker 5:  Four it's 400 million users there. WhatsApp is the

45
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,450
Speaker 5:  internet, or you could put it like this.

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,730
Speaker 6:  Watch seven India is avail flight.

47
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,170
Speaker 3:  Keep in touch with your family, WhatsApp, buy and sell goods.

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,770
Speaker 3:  WhatsApp, send money, access, critical medical

49
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,130
Speaker 3:  information, like where to get a COVID vaccine WhatsApp

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,300
Speaker 5:  Though, it doesn't contribute much to Meta's bottom line. Yet WhatsApp is

51
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,140
Speaker 5:  the company's most essential product by far that's because

52
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,940
Speaker 5:  with over 2 billion users, WhatsApp is embedded in the social

53
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,930
Speaker 5:  economic and political infrastructure of countries across the globe,

54
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,440
Speaker 3:  But there's a dark side to connecting the world. Enormous

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,050
Speaker 3:  platforms can cause enormous problems.

56
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,160
Speaker 7:  India is WhatsApp's biggest market and viral hoaxes on the

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,820
Speaker 7:  platform are being blamed for a recent spate of mob violence.

58
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,690
Speaker 8:  Recently in India, internet Lynch mobs have killed a dozen

59
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,850
Speaker 8:  people, including innocent bystanders. Thank you.

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,450
Speaker 9:  Cryptid messaging platform has become a playground for conspiracy

61
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,110
Speaker 9:  theorists

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,530
Speaker 5:  Today. The story of WhatsApp's incredible power is told through its

63
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,400
Speaker 5:  largest market India. Mark Zuckerberg has had a

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,360
Speaker 5:  long history with India, even before WhatsApp solidified his company's

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,230
Speaker 5:  dominance there.

66
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,640
Speaker 3:  Now WhatsApp is particularly intertwined in Indian society

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,830
Speaker 3:  for better and for worse.

68
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,350
Speaker 3:  This is land of the giants

69
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,940
Speaker 5:  Long before WhatsApp was one of the biggest apps in the world. Niraj

70
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,840
Speaker 5:  Aurora noticed it's starting to climb the downloads chart of Google's Android

71
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,530
Speaker 5:  play store.

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,970
Speaker 3:  The year was 2010 and Aurora was working on corporate development at

73
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,900
Speaker 3:  Google. He was tasked with looking for startups to acquire at the Dawn

74
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,920
Speaker 3:  of the smartphone era.

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,120
Speaker 11:  WhatsApp had no information about them on the website.

76
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,930
Speaker 11:  So I emailed support@whatsapp.com. I didn't hear back

77
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,200
Speaker 11:  for several days. Finally. I think

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,040
Speaker 11:  Brian replied on support email

79
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,280
Speaker 11:  saying, why don't you come meet us at this mountain? We address

80
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,270
Speaker 5:  Brian is in Brian Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp with Yon

81
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,080
Speaker 5:  comb. The founders met while working at Yahoo. Now they were building

82
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,980
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp out of a small back office in Silicon valley, Aurora

83
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,140
Speaker 5:  members that had an informal meeting room.

84
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,190
Speaker 11:  So it was sort of like a, just a cubicle, not really a conference room.

85
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,720
Speaker 11:  And I was like, shit. Like, this is very weird because I'm going to talk

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,540
Speaker 11:  some sensitive stuff with you. And they're like, I don't care.

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,980
Speaker 3:  Neither did Aurora. He left the meeting excited about the potential for what

88
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,330
Speaker 3:  accent and Coon we're building.

89
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,650
Speaker 5:  He made an offer for this startup on behalf of Google, $10 million

90
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,820
Speaker 5:  and impressive price tag, considering that WhatsApp, boasted barely a million

91
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,970
Speaker 5:  downloads so far and hadn't raised any outside capital

92
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,940
Speaker 3:  And yet acting in Coon passed.

93
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,170
Speaker 5:  So Aurora came back within a few months with a better deal. One that he

94
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,950
Speaker 5:  says, Google co-founder Larry Page had to personally sign off on

95
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,960
Speaker 5:  $100 million.

96
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,790
Speaker 11:  They said, look, we left Yahoo to start WhatsApp for a reason.

97
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,890
Speaker 11:  We hate big companies and we cannot operate the baby B cam

98
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,790
Speaker 11:  hair. So thank you very much. Thanks for spending time with

99
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:55,970
Speaker 11:  us

100
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,880
Speaker 5:  Move that left a lasting impression.

101
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,180
Speaker 5:  When Aurora left Google looking for his next career move, he called

102
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,720
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp.

103
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
Speaker 11:  Obviously the only company I really wanted to like work at was

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,070
Speaker 11:  WhatsApp. Like I'd seen everything Dropbox, Airbnb

105
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,550
Speaker 11:  square, like all the heart darlings of the valley

106
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,660
Speaker 11:  were not that interesting. This was sort of like the hidden gem that nobody

107
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,750
Speaker 11:  knew about and was just growing really well. And the founders were incredible.

108
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,860
Speaker 3:  Aurora joined WhatsApp in November, 2011 as its chief business

109
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,790
Speaker 3:  officer. And by then what's apps growth was taking off

110
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,990
Speaker 3:  purely by word of mouth. Tens of millions of people were using the app.

111
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,370
Speaker 11:  The most important thing was that our daily to

112
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,240
Speaker 11:  monthly active users ratio was the best in the

113
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,170
Speaker 11:  industry. I think it was around 70 something percent

114
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,400
Speaker 11:  like 70% of your monthly active users would come back daily,

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,610
Speaker 11:  which was, I think better than Facebook's.

116
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,170
Speaker 5:  Here's why WhatsApp was taking off. It was a cheaper alternative to texting

117
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,800
Speaker 5:  traditional text messaging was expensive and a lot of the world at the time,

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,820
Speaker 5:  you often got charged per text messaging apps like WhatsApp

119
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,980
Speaker 5:  instead used internet data plans.

120
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,580
Speaker 3:  And WhatsApp was simple, both to sign up for and to use

121
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,900
Speaker 3:  Kumon. Acton made a priority of supporting every kind of smartphone possible.

122
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,800
Speaker 3:  So WhatsApp could work no matter the device and your account was just your

123
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,460
Speaker 3:  phone number. The app limited the information it collected on you,

124
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,600
Speaker 3:  not your location and not the names or addresses of your contacts.

125
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,440
Speaker 5:  This spoke to a key value for the founders of WhatsApp privacy

126
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
Speaker 5:  from the very beginning, privacy and security were built into the company's

127
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,450
Speaker 5:  DNA. This was more than a design feature. It was what the founders

128
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,890
Speaker 5:  felt. They owed their users.

129
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,240
Speaker 3:  Coon was born in Ukraine during the Soviet years, growing up, his parents

130
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,540
Speaker 3:  avoided using the telephone for fear. They were being monitored by the state.

131
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,680
Speaker 5:  If Kuhn's appreciation for privacy came from his personal history.

132
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,190
Speaker 5:  Actins came from his professional past at Yahoo in the

133
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,000
Speaker 5:  nineties, he'd run an advertising platform that collected click-through data.

134
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,610
Speaker 5:  It turned them off for good on targeted as

135
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,480
Speaker 11:  He had a very kind of like ugly experience, trying to

136
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,110
Speaker 11:  figure that thing out. I think he didn't really enjoy that experience of

137
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,650
Speaker 11:  collecting all the data and showing out and all that. So when they started

138
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,400
Speaker 11:  WhatsApp and when Brian joined, it was very clear. He said, I'm not never

139
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,090
Speaker 11:  going to do that. This is a very intimate and personal product that we are

140
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,810
Speaker 11:  building. I would hate to collect or know what people are

141
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,680
Speaker 11:  chatting about on my app, right? So from day one, it was

142
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,910
Speaker 11:  not an option.

143
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,230
Speaker 3:  Coon famously taped a note to his work desk from Acton that red, no

144
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,600
Speaker 3:  ads, no games, no gimmicks.

145
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,290
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp's the emphasis on simplicity and privacy was working by

146
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,920
Speaker 5:  early 2013. The company had 200 million active users.

147
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,880
Speaker 5:  And with advertising off the table, acting in Coombe, decided to charge a

148
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,410
Speaker 5:  whopping 99 cents a year for the app.

149
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,580
Speaker 3:  It wasn't much, but in the world of free social media apps like Facebook,

150
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,450
Speaker 3:  Twitter, and Snapchat, it was unusual. And according to Aurora,

151
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,650
Speaker 3:  it was actually part of an effort to slow down growth to a manageable pace.

152
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,890
Speaker 5:  But the strategy didn't work out exactly as planned.

153
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,230
Speaker 11:  The growth never stopped. People were still paying and they were shocked.

154
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,170
Speaker 11:  And I remember I still have those screenshots somewhere where I think

155
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,710
Speaker 11:  there was a point where we were the top paid app

156
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,130
Speaker 11:  on the app store in 50 different countries. At the same time,

157
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,090
Speaker 5:  What's up success was starting to make waves in April, 2013.

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,540
Speaker 5:  Coombe took the stage at the all things, Dean mobile conference, and revealed

159
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,790
Speaker 5:  that WhatsApp had more users than Twitter.

160
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,660
Speaker 11:  Everybody was taken a back like, who are these guys? They've never talked

161
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,910
Speaker 11:  about themselves. And now they're saying they're bigger than Twitter, right?

162
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,470
Speaker 3:  Aurora says after Coombs, Mike drop major acquisition offers rolled in

163
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,920
Speaker 3:  the Chinese company. Tencent was the first big one,

164
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,030
Speaker 3:  $10 billion. Google called again, this time

165
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,780
Speaker 3:  Larry Page wanted to meet and the meeting got scheduled, but

166
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,100
Speaker 5:  It would be too late because someone else had been keeping track of

167
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,650
Speaker 5:  WhatsApps success. Mark Zuckerberg,

168
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,990
Speaker 11:  You were getting into the zone of half a billion users, active

169
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,860
Speaker 11:  users. So really active everyday and

170
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,300
Speaker 11:  with an opportunity to definitely get to a billion users and do a lot

171
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,780
Speaker 11:  of other things than just messaging. So

172
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,070
Speaker 11:  it was absolutely an existential threat for Facebook. And he knew that

173
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,330
Speaker 5:  As he had shown with the purchase of Instagram, Zuckerberg was always on

174
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,170
Speaker 5:  the lookout for challengers to his social media empire, and

175
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,770
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp's growth on mobile phones directly challenged Facebook messenger,

176
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,820
Speaker 5:  especially because WhatsApp was taking off in parts of the world that messenger

177
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,540
Speaker 5:  just wasn't.

178
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,560
Speaker 3:  And at a more fundamental level, people were using WhatsApp for many of the

179
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,250
Speaker 3:  same reasons. They might otherwise use Facebook to keep in touch with family

180
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,180
Speaker 3:  and friends online. It was a network of users that might never enter

181
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,170
Speaker 3:  the Facebook universe, sucker Berg needed it, or he might

182
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:58,830
Speaker 3:  lose to it.

183
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,660
Speaker 5:  So he made his move before WhatsApp was set to meet with

184
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,600
Speaker 5:  Google Zuckerberg, invited Coombe over for dinner.

185
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,920
Speaker 11:  Facebook said, look, whatever it takes, the kind of deal you want to

186
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,350
Speaker 11:  structure, whatever you want, we'll give it to you

187
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,990
Speaker 3:  And buy whatever you want. They meant it

188
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,280
Speaker 11:  Autonomy nor ads, complete product independence

189
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,690
Speaker 11:  for Yon and Brian board seat for Yon, which we didn't ask for. They

190
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,480
Speaker 11:  offered, we said, okay, fine. And

191
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,100
Speaker 11:  encryption and doing encryption was, they cannot say no to it.

192
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,920
Speaker 11:  Like we were still in working on it. And they said, yeah, we'll support

193
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,190
Speaker 11:  that

194
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,960
Speaker 5:  End to end encryption was a deal point that spoke to actin and Coombs focus

195
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,620
Speaker 5:  on privacy. The technology would prevent anyone except the

196
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,430
Speaker 5:  sender and the recipient of a message from being able to read it. So

197
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,090
Speaker 5:  even WhatsApp itself, wouldn't be able to know the contents of the

198
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,250
Speaker 5:  conversation's flowing through its service.

199
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,490
Speaker 3:  The encryption deal point also spoke to an inherent tension between WhatsApp

200
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,420
Speaker 3:  and Facebook early on Facebook's business model depended

201
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,230
Speaker 3:  on collecting data about users, likes and interactions. So it could use that

202
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,970
Speaker 3:  data to personalize ads,

203
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,170
Speaker 11:  Obviously Yon and Brian might never put this on the record that we were

204
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,440
Speaker 11:  doing this partially so that Facebook never gets any information about our

205
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,590
Speaker 11:  users. But I know for sure that was one of the reasons that they wanted

206
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,980
Speaker 11:  to do it.

207
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,050
Speaker 3:  Even if WhatsApp's adherence to privacy was contradictory in some ways to

208
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,920
Speaker 3:  Facebook's business. Facebook just wanted to get the deal done.

209
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,360
Speaker 5:  Kumon Zuckerberg did just that on Valentine's day in 2014,

210
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,740
Speaker 5:  the agreed price, 19 billion in mostly Facebook

211
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,400
Speaker 5:  stock. It would be Zuckerberg largest acquisition ever by

212
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,760
Speaker 5:  far

213
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,110
Speaker 3:  The media reported at the time Zuckerberg and Coombs shared a plate of seasonally,

214
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,360
Speaker 3:  appropriate chocolate covered strawberries.

215
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,190
Speaker 5:  It was a whirlwind romance.

216
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,920
Speaker 13:  WhatsApp is a great company and it's a, and it's a great fit for us.

217
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,970
Speaker 3:  Just shy of two weeks after the deal was signed, sucker Berg was in

218
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,930
Speaker 3:  Barcelona at the mobile world, Congress, a gigantic trade show for the mobile

219
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,430
Speaker 3:  telecommunications industry.

220
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,810
Speaker 13:  I'll already almost half a billion people. I love using

221
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,620
Speaker 13:  WhatsApp for, for messaging. And it's the

222
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,280
Speaker 13:  most engaging app that, that we've ever seen exist on

223
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,780
Speaker 13:  mobile by far,

224
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,980
Speaker 5:  People were stunned by how much he paid for WhatsApp. It was the most expensive

225
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,940
Speaker 5:  purchase of any private tech startup to date. So in Zuckerberg was asked

226
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,330
Speaker 5:  to explain his rationale. He sounded a little defensive.

227
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,020
Speaker 13:  I actually just think that by itself it's worth more than $19 billion. I

228
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,770
Speaker 13:  mean, it's, it's hard to exactly make that case today because they

229
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,340
Speaker 13:  have so little revenue compared to that number. But I mean, the reality

230
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,220
Speaker 13:  is there are very few services that reach a billion people in the world.

231
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,950
Speaker 13:  They're all incredibly valuable, much more valuable than that

232
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,360
Speaker 3:  For Zuckerberg. WhatsApp was invaluable because it was a way to fulfill

233
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,350
Speaker 3:  his original mission of getting as many people in the world as possible using

234
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,670
Speaker 3:  one of Facebook's products

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,970
Speaker 13:  When Yon and I first met and started talking about this,

236
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,920
Speaker 13:  we really started talking about what it was going to be like to connect

237
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,520
Speaker 13:  everyone in the world, right? And a lot of this is the vision for

238
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,330
Speaker 13:  internet.org. And that's what I really want to take the time to focus on

239
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:10,870
Speaker 13:  today.

240
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,340
Speaker 5:  Internet.org, this project sucker Berg talked about in the same breath as

241
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,240
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp was an initiative to bring internet access to various countries

242
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,750
Speaker 5:  with untapped users, including India, which have become an

243
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,090
Speaker 5:  incredibly attractive market to Silicon valley.

244
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,750
Speaker 12:  So around 2015,

245
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,980
Speaker 12:  Silicon valley essentially looked eastwards

246
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,060
Speaker 12:  and said, here's this big market. It has more than a billion

247
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,050
Speaker 12:  people. A telecom war is just getting underway. Here's

248
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,940
Speaker 12:  our next billion users

249
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,050
Speaker 3:  <inaudible> as a technology reporter for Buzzfeed who was based in India

250
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,860
Speaker 3:  from 2014 to 2022, that telecom

251
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,140
Speaker 3:  war he mentions. It meant that suddenly India

252
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,590
Speaker 3:  experienced a huge drop in internet data costs

253
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,940
Speaker 3:  a whole bunch of people who couldn't afford to get online before now

254
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,390
Speaker 3:  could

255
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,530
Speaker 12:  Most people in India experience the internet almost entirely on

256
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,520
Speaker 12:  that smartphones, India leapfrogged, as they say,

257
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,850
Speaker 12:  the desktop PC era, most people never had them.

258
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,430
Speaker 3:  So back to Zuckerberg, internet.org project, a way to get onto all those

259
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,090
Speaker 3:  smartphones,

260
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,400
Speaker 5:  Practically it met Facebook, partnered with major telecom services in India

261
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,970
Speaker 5:  and other countries to provide a free stripped down version of the internet.

262
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,060
Speaker 5:  Facebook of course, would be one of a few sites available

263
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,710
Speaker 3:  Facebook branded internet.org as an idealistic project to deliver the

264
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,700
Speaker 3:  human right of connection. But many did not buy that branding,

265
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,380
Speaker 3:  especially in India, where there were protests against Facebook's

266
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,220
Speaker 3:  initiative, many people, and even the government saw it as an

267
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,910
Speaker 3:  attempt by Facebook to control the internet. The government ended up

268
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,840
Speaker 3:  outright banning the project, but lucky for Zuckerberg, he would

269
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,900
Speaker 3:  still have a way to those hundreds of millions of users

270
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,360
Speaker 6:  In India is a way of life.

271
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,950
Speaker 3:  In the years, following Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp, the app flourished

272
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,700
Speaker 3:  in India, even with limited two G mobile internet connections,

273
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,450
Speaker 3:  people could load WhatsApp relatively quickly because it was simple with

274
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,420
Speaker 3:  far fewer features and social media apps like Facebook.

275
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,430
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp was a success except in one respect revenue

276
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,020
Speaker 5:  just a few years after the acquisition conversations inside Facebook

277
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,860
Speaker 5:  began to turn to how WhatsApp could make money that subscription WhatsApp

278
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,920
Speaker 5:  originally charged Facebook, removed it after the deal,

279
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,180
Speaker 11:  They want it to run ads on the

280
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,890
Speaker 11:  stories feature that WhatsApp built

281
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,450
Speaker 3:  Called status. This feature was a knockoff of Instagram stories. It

282
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,410
Speaker 3:  launched in 2017 to Facebook status was a natural place

283
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,160
Speaker 3:  to run ads.

284
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,390
Speaker 11:  They had all the infrastructure of running ads on Instagram and Facebook.

285
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,020
Speaker 11:  So they were like, we just plug it in. I think Brian had an allergic reaction

286
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,980
Speaker 11:  to that. He was like, I'm leaving. And he left a lot of money on the table

287
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,440
Speaker 5:  Act and walked away from roughly 850 million in Facebook shares.

288
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,580
Speaker 5:  He would go on to become the chairman of signal. Another encrypted messaging

289
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,420
Speaker 5:  app that's run as a nonprofit. And when the Cambridge Analytica scandal

290
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,020
Speaker 5:  broke in 2018, actin tweeted out, quote, it is

291
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,150
Speaker 5:  time hashtag delete Facebook

292
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,440
Speaker 3:  A few months after act and left Coombe quit too, though. It's

293
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,220
Speaker 3:  unclear how much ads had to do with it in his farewell post. He said he

294
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,910
Speaker 3:  wanted to spend more time on his hobbies, like collecting rare air

295
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,730
Speaker 3:  cooled Porsche's and playing ultimate Frisbee.

296
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,930
Speaker 5:  This whole situation is ironic because ads never came to

297
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,890
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp. Facebook decided that the risk of backlash wouldn't be worth it,

298
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,670
Speaker 5:  but not before actin Coombe and Aurora were out the door

299
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,230
Speaker 5:  and Facebook decided to lean into the values of

300
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,950
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp to embrace its focus on privacy as a selling

301
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,310
Speaker 5:  point.

302
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,570
Speaker 14:  I think you have to think about what it means to offer a service where people

303
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,950
Speaker 14:  communicate their most private thoughts

304
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,800
Speaker 14:  to the people they care about the most, all around the world.

305
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,500
Speaker 3:  The current head of WhatsApp will Cathcart Cathcart transferred over

306
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,460
Speaker 3:  from the Facebook app in 2019. Now he says Mehta has

307
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,270
Speaker 3:  embraced an ads free WhatsApp. Instead it's pushing to

308
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,210
Speaker 3:  make money by charging businesses, to message their customers.

309
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,500
Speaker 14:  There are a lot of really, really sensitive

310
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,940
Speaker 14:  conversations that happen on WhatsApp. Everything from people talking to

311
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,480
Speaker 14:  a doctor, people talking to a journalist and a lot of countries or WhatsApp's

312
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,020
Speaker 14:  popular government officials talking amongst themselves. So you've got to

313
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,340
Speaker 14:  offer the highest level of security.

314
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,600
Speaker 5:  This preaching of WhatsApp's original values. It's not just coming from Cathcart.

315
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,350
Speaker 13:  Privacy gives us the freedom to be ourselves.

316
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,360
Speaker 13:  It's easier to feel like you belong when you're part of smaller

317
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,150
Speaker 13:  communities and amongst your closest friends,

318
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,840
Speaker 5:  Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook's ethic conference in 2019

319
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,310
Speaker 5:  with Russian misinformation and Cambridge Analytica behind him. This was

320
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,180
Speaker 5:  the year Zuckerberg made a hard pivot to privacy specifically.

321
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,080
Speaker 5:  He said he believed the future of communication would increasingly shift

322
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,370
Speaker 5:  to encrypted messaging.

323
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,720
Speaker 13:  As the world gets bigger and more connected. We need that

324
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
Speaker 13:  sense of, of intimacy more than more than ever.

325
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,420
Speaker 13:  So that's why I believe that the future is private

326
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,890
Speaker 3:  Privacy and encryption. They become virtues to Facebook,

327
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,330
Speaker 3:  but these commitments are now putting Mehta and WhatsApp at odds with the

328
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,260
Speaker 3:  government of India. It's the largest market because connecting so many

329
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,830
Speaker 3:  people, even through private group chats can cause real world

330
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,610
Speaker 3:  problems.

331

Speaker 3:  Please note, in the second half of the episode, there are descriptions of

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,980
Speaker 3:  graphic acts of violence. If you want to skip this content, exact

Speaker 3:  times are given in the show notes,

347
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,820
Speaker 12:  India lives and dies by what we call forwards,

348
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,870
Speaker 12:  which is just people forwarding pieces of content,

349
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,250
Speaker 12:  pictures, videos, text to

350
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,360
Speaker 12:  each other on WhatsApp.

351
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,920
Speaker 3:  Prinav diction technology reporter for Buzzfeed news, he's

352
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,850
Speaker 3:  describing a popular WhatsApp feature, forwarded messages, content

353
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,790
Speaker 3:  you could easily send off to your friends or whatever groups you were a part

354
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,030
Speaker 3:  of.

355
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,660
Speaker 12:  You will be in like 50 different WhatsApp groups,

356
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,850
Speaker 12:  full of people. You may know like your friends and family,

357
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,480
Speaker 5:  And maybe you're also in a few groups with people. You don't know that well

358
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,830
Speaker 5:  like once for your neighborhood or school, and those can get pretty big filled

359
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,850
Speaker 5:  with hundreds of people.

360
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,320
Speaker 3:  Most forwarded content tends to be mundane, good mornings, weather

361
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,670
Speaker 3:  reports, recipes,

362
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,990
Speaker 5:  But as with anything that can go potentially viral, some forwards

363
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,010
Speaker 5:  aren't so benign

364
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,230
Speaker 3:  In late 2017, a wave of so-called stranger danger

365
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,570
Speaker 3:  videos spread across WhatsApp in India,

366
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,740
Speaker 17:  Stranger danger videos that went out said the following things look out

367
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,950
Speaker 17:  for your children. There are strangers in your area. They're coming to kidnap

368
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,460
Speaker 17:  your children and take their kidneys. That was the basic message in multiple

369
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,800
Speaker 17:  different vernacular languages across India,

370
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,970
Speaker 3:  Chicago, Angela Banaji is a professor of media culture and social change

371
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,900
Speaker 3:  at the London school of economics and political science. She researches the

372
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,310
Speaker 3:  spread of misinformation.

373
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,300
Speaker 5:  What struck Banaji was that these videos were carefully edited and tailored

374
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,110
Speaker 5:  to different ethnic groups, often depicting local children being seemingly

375
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,510
Speaker 5:  kidnapped or hurt by malicious outsiders.

376
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,770
Speaker 17:  So for example, you'd have a video of a killing of children

377
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,760
Speaker 17:  from <inaudible> overlapping that you would have a voiceover

378
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,750
Speaker 17:  in, in Tamel or Telegu or Hindi saying something like this

379
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,050
Speaker 17:  is what people traffickers are doing in your area. Even though it was so

380
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,830
Speaker 17:  clear from the visuals that the children were not locals, but nevertheless,

381
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,480
Speaker 17:  this spread absolute panic.

382
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,650
Speaker 12:  So there was a call to arms at the end of each of these messages,

383
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,550
Speaker 12:  asking people to forward them and essentially, almost cajoling

384
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,550
Speaker 12:  them to take things into their own hands and do something about these people

385
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,780
Speaker 12:  who were kidnapping the children,

386
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,410
Speaker 5:  Pranav Dick shit reported on what happened with one of these stranger danger

387
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,490
Speaker 5:  videos went viral.

388
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,390
Speaker 12:  I ended up traveling to this

389
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,080
Speaker 12:  tiny Hamlet called Ryan powder,

390
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,670
Speaker 12:  which is in the Indian state of Maharashtra in the Western

391
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,600
Speaker 12:  part of the country, where just days before I

392
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,020
Speaker 12:  visited five, people had been lynched to death

393
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,370
Speaker 12:  in an extremely gruesome and brutal

394
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,430
Speaker 12:  manner. Basically a mob of 40 people,

395
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,720
Speaker 12:  stoned them and beat them to death inside the village council

396
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,350
Speaker 12:  office,

397
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,070
Speaker 3:  The video that spurred that violence, it was complete misinformation.

398
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,280
Speaker 3:  It featured an image of dead children. That was actually from the aftermath

399
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,350
Speaker 3:  of a chemical weapons attack in Syria.

400
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,160
Speaker 5:  But the fact that the information was being shared by people in WhatsApp

401
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,500
Speaker 5:  groups made it feel more trustworthy.

402
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,610
Speaker 12:  WhatsApp is your window to the world, and you

403
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,940
Speaker 12:  believe everything that, that you see there

404
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,020
Speaker 12:  because you know, oh, somebody I know sent me this, a

405
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,680
Speaker 12:  friend sent me this, somebody from my village sent me this. So

406
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,180
Speaker 12:  it must be true.

407
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,230
Speaker 3:  Banaji says, in addition to the trust factor, there was something else at

408
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,950
Speaker 3:  work here, an atmosphere of heightened religious and political

409
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,730
Speaker 3:  tensions,

410
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,990
Speaker 17:  As we were doing our research, it became evident that very quickly,

411
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,830
Speaker 17:  the discourse morphed from it's just any stranger in your area

412
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,760
Speaker 17:  to it's Muslim invaders, it's Muslim infiltrators,

413
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,330
Speaker 17:  it's people from across the border. It's Bangladeshis

414
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,650
Speaker 17:  it's Rohingya. So really quickly. So it began to look

415
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,460
Speaker 17:  like there had been a kind of plan all along. So

416
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,390
Speaker 17:  distrust and enmity against new people coming into particular

417
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,870
Speaker 17:  areas,

418
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,370
Speaker 5:  Regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts in India predate the

419
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,270
Speaker 5:  internet, but just as access to the internet started to grow the

420
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,770
Speaker 5:  political climate changed.

421
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,760
Speaker 17:  So in 2014, Narendra Modi and his

422
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,720
Speaker 17:  government came to power in India after a very sort of concerted

423
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,740
Speaker 17:  new media campaign in which they linked modern

424
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,370
Speaker 17:  technologies to that outreach to different voter

425
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:16,850
Speaker 17:  groups,

426
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,570
Speaker 3:  Modi ran on a successful digitally savvy campaign of political

427
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,470
Speaker 3:  populism vowing to put an end to corruption and India's elite ruling

428
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,770
Speaker 3:  class, his political party, the BJP

429
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,430
Speaker 3:  historically has had a Hindu nationalist message. One which was

430
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,640
Speaker 3:  amplified during the campaign. And after Modi came to power.

431
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,570
Speaker 17:  This ideology basically states that India is an

432
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,380
Speaker 17:  always has been and always will be a Hindu mainly in the

433
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,350
Speaker 17:  nation. That Hindus should be proud of their Hinduism and

434
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,270
Speaker 17:  should be strong.

435
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,350
Speaker 5:  Modi's critics say that some of the viral stranger danger rumors on

436
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,310
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp will not directly started by Modi or the BJP draw

437
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,370
Speaker 5:  on religious divisions at the core of the party's politics

438
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,980
Speaker 3:  From around 2017 to 2018, Banaji says over

439
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,400
Speaker 3:  30 people were killed across India by mobs incited, by

440
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,140
Speaker 3:  misinformation, spread on WhatsApp,

441
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,220
Speaker 5:  The violence was gaining more and more attention and pressure was mounting

442
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,930
Speaker 5:  on WhatsApp to confront the issue.

443
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,730
Speaker 3:  So in July, 2018, WhatsApp rolled out some product changes in India

444
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,390
Speaker 3:  to try to curb the sharing of incendiary videos and misinformation.

445
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,890
Speaker 3:  It was a little over a year since the first major lynching connected to WhatsApp

446
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,380
Speaker 3:  happened. Here's WhatsApp's will Cathcart.

447
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,320
Speaker 14:  We said, okay, how do we approach the problem? What are the things we can

448
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,810
Speaker 14:  do to help society deal with misinformation?

449
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,920
Speaker 5:  One of the first things WhatsApp did was to add friction, to sharing, to

450
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,650
Speaker 5:  slow down the speed at which viral content could spread.

451
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,140
Speaker 14:  We latched on to, well, how easy is it to send

452
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,250
Speaker 14:  information around and how easy is it to find alternative sources of

453
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,210
Speaker 14:  information? So forward limits have been the biggest change by far

454
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,660
Speaker 14:  we've made

455
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,160
Speaker 3:  In India. That meant a user could only forward something to five individuals

456
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,910
Speaker 3:  or group chats simultaneously down from the previous limit of 100

457
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,660
Speaker 3:  WhatsApp adopted similar rules. Worldwide six months later,

458
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,560
Speaker 5:  It also removed a feature that allowed for quick forwarding and eventually

459
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,370
Speaker 5:  replaced it with a Google search button to remind people to confirm something

460
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,810
Speaker 5:  as true before forwarding it.

461
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,690
Speaker 14:  We're not trying to jump in and say, Hey, what you just said is false. But

462
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,930
Speaker 14:  by changing the design of the product, we can make it easier to find out

463
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,840
Speaker 14:  the truth than it is to quickly forward something without thinking about

464
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:24,930
Speaker 14:  it.

465
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,160
Speaker 3:  These were all important changes, but to Prinav diction, the company could

466
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,950
Speaker 3:  have considered the consequences of WhatsApp's original product design sooner.

467
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,110
Speaker 12:  That's a true line with all Silicon valley products and

468
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,470
Speaker 12:  platforms that have expanded into countries like India

469
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,460
Speaker 12:  without putting in the necessary checks and balances

470
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,120
Speaker 12:  first, without doing groundwork, without actually

471
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,450
Speaker 12:  studying the country that they were expanding into,

472
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,980
Speaker 12:  they saw a billion people and they were like, great, here's

473
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,580
Speaker 12:  a billion people. Let's just give them our

474
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,480
Speaker 12:  product, our app, our service, and then let's see how they

475
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,020
Speaker 12:  use it

476
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,630
Speaker 3:  For Indian regulators though. These measures weren't enough after WhatsApp

477
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,290
Speaker 3:  implemented some of the changes, the ministry of electronics in it issued

478
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,910
Speaker 3:  a statement, demanding a do more.

479
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,690
Speaker 5:  The government called for WhatsApp to filter out harmful content from the

480
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,380
Speaker 5:  source to trace a chain of forwards back. So it could

481
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,260
Speaker 5:  track down who is spreading violence, inducing rumors.

482
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,040
Speaker 3:  There was one big problem though, end to end encryption.

483
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,660
Speaker 3:  One of WhatsApps core values evaluate stuck to all along. Was it,

484
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,620
Speaker 3:  it couldn't see or trace people's messages. Me keel. Paula is

485
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,360
Speaker 3:  with the tech website, media Nama,

486
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,510
Speaker 18:  Then WhatsApp was doing something about

487
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,950
Speaker 18:  misinformation in terms of trying to prevent it. It would

488
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,160
Speaker 18:  mean that they're reading the texts and that wouldn't be in tuned encryption.

489
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,600
Speaker 18:  So WhatsApp is in a very tricky situation where at

490
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,260
Speaker 18:  one level it can't do much except at a product level could try and

491
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,790
Speaker 18:  address misinformation.

492
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,230
Speaker 3:  But another way

493
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,190
Speaker 18:  There's really nothing that they can do specifically to address

494
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,780
Speaker 18:  misinformation on the platform.

495
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,530
Speaker 3:  Here's what WhatsApp can do according to will Cathcart.

496
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,460
Speaker 14:  Sometimes on the team we talk about it is solving a problem as an architect

497
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,930
Speaker 14:  would rather than as a law enforcement officer would, I mean, architects,

498
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,050
Speaker 14:  think a lot about the design of a building, the design of a city. What can

499
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,410
Speaker 14:  you do that will help create a safe environment or a safer environment over

500
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,650
Speaker 14:  time, which is very different than when there's been a problem, a specific

501
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,580
Speaker 14:  problem. How do you go deal with it? I think for some of these problems,

502
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,480
Speaker 14:  like at misinformation, the private nature of the product has

503
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,440
Speaker 14:  pushed us more towards architect type solutions because you have to

504
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,130
Speaker 14:  given how private

505
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,610
Speaker 3:  Architect type solutions like limiting message forwarding, but other

506
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,600
Speaker 3:  Mehta platforms like Facebook and Instagram, they can take the kind of law

507
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,350
Speaker 3:  enforcement approach. Cathcart referenced. They're able to moderate content

508
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,030
Speaker 3:  directly because they can see it

509
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,350
Speaker 5:  In 2021 India's ministry of electronics. And it issued

510
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,010
Speaker 5:  new rules requiring social media companies to identify the quote

511
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,700
Speaker 5:  first originator of information when requested by the government,

512
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,230
Speaker 5:  essentially a legal mandate for WhatsApp to break encryption

513
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,640
Speaker 3:  In response, WhatsApp filed a lawsuit to block the regulations, which is

514
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,510
Speaker 3:  still ongoing.

515
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,530
Speaker 14:  We're trying to make the point that undermining end to end

516
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,400
Speaker 14:  encryption is actually bad for the things governments care

517
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,360
Speaker 14:  about in any free democratic society. I

518
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,570
Speaker 14:  believe security people's private communications is really, really, really

519
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,410
Speaker 14:  important. One of the points we've been making is that it is ironic.

520
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Speaker 14:  Like governments are never asking us to increase the security. We offer

521
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,310
Speaker 14:  people. They're always asking us to lower it.

522
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,970
Speaker 3:  The Indian government says it needs to root out the viral misinformation

523
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,870
Speaker 3:  that incites violence, but the experts we talked to were skeptical of Modi's

524
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,860
Speaker 3:  intentions. They worried that this could be a way for the government to crack

525
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,700
Speaker 3:  down on open political debate in the country, Chicago Tula Banaji.

526
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,090
Speaker 3:  Again,

527
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,290
Speaker 17:  If I believed in good faith that governments

528
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,800
Speaker 17:  really intended to trace the people who were sending the

529
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,490
Speaker 17:  murderous messages and that they were not going to

530
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,340
Speaker 17:  only take action against the people who were

531
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,540
Speaker 17:  organizing through democracy rallies. So the people who were in

532
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,110
Speaker 17:  some way critical of the government, then I might consider

533
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,330
Speaker 17:  the DN cryption as an answer.

534
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,650
Speaker 5:  So what is the end game? The Indian government has proven it can be serious

535
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,550
Speaker 5:  about social media regulation. It went so far as to ban Tik TOK in

536
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,540
Speaker 5:  2020, claiming that the app was harmful to the quote sovereignty and

537
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,050
Speaker 5:  integrity of India, basically because of its companies, Chinese

538
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,560
Speaker 5:  ownership,

539
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,850
Speaker 3:  But many observers believe that despite this precedent and the ongoing legal

540
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,690
Speaker 3:  challenges, WhatsApp, isn't going away, Prinav

541
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,410
Speaker 3:  diction. Again,

542
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,610
Speaker 12:  I don't paying even the government wants to be in a situation

543
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,420
Speaker 12:  where they ban WhatsApp, because it's like, what are you going to replace

544
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,130
Speaker 12:  it with? There's there's nothing else.

545
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,050
Speaker 5:  Ultimately WhatsApp is at a high stakes face off with the Indian government,

546
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,280
Speaker 5:  but unlike Tik TOK, WhatsApp is so entrenched in India that it

547
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,020
Speaker 5:  can't be as easily accessed

548
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,340
Speaker 3:  At this point, both WhatsApp and the Indian government need each other, but

549
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,470
Speaker 3:  they're each distrustful of the other's intentions,

550
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,940
Speaker 5:  Metas, other social networks. We've talked about this season, Instagram,

551
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,900
Speaker 5:  Facebook they're fighting to stay relevant. WhatsApp's fight is

552
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,830
Speaker 5:  different. And that it's coming from a place of strength, which is

553
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,340
Speaker 5:  maybe why will Cathcart has a point when he says, he believes that

554
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,170
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp's model is the future.

555
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,980
Speaker 14:  We've had this incredible growth and innovation period,

556
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,220
Speaker 14:  social media, and he called a town square social media. We're now seeing

557
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,180
Speaker 14:  this incredible growth in more private communication services like

558
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,270
Speaker 14:  WhatsApp and features like stories that have

559
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,220
Speaker 14:  ephemerality groups.

560
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,570
Speaker 3:  What Cathcart means when he refers to the town square social media model

561
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,650
Speaker 3:  is essentially the core Facebook. We all know, well, everyone shouting

562
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,520
Speaker 3:  everything into the public arena, guided by algorithms. That guess what we

563
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,000
Speaker 3:  want to hear most it's a square that's incredibly crowded,

564
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,500
Speaker 3:  messy, chaotic

565
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,670
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp's way is instead more private, trusted and simple.

566
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,050
Speaker 5:  And even though it doesn't make meta that much money, the trust users have

567
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,980
Speaker 5:  in WhatsApp is invaluable, but what's up still runs into that

568
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,850
Speaker 5:  recurring Facebook problem of sometimes enabling the ugliest

569
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,440
Speaker 5:  aspects of human behavior.

570
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,670
Speaker 3:  Throughout the course of this season, the tension we've been tracking and

571
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,360
Speaker 3:  each of Metis platforms comes down in a way to scale.

572
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,160
Speaker 3:  Zuckerberg has always wanted to connect the world to have as many

573
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,090
Speaker 3:  people as possible using his technologies. And he's been able

574
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,020
Speaker 3:  to do that, made the right acquisitions, set the right growth metrics.

575
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,430
Speaker 3:  But when it comes to considering the complexity of every culture, the

576
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,420
Speaker 3:  trade off of every product design Metta, hasn't always been able to

577
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,020
Speaker 3:  think ahead

578
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,340
Speaker 5:  Next week, Zuckerberg, grandest, boldest, vision to date

579
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,360
Speaker 5:  the metaverse and our season finale. What would it look like for

580
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,050
Speaker 5:  Zuckerberg to invent the next era of how we connect with each other

581
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,620
Speaker 3:  News clips from ABC news, CNN business, PBS news
