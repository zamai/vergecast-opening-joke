8
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,990
Speaker 5:  That's really the experience of using modern technology. You're

9
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,790
Speaker 5:  alone in your house. The things aren't gonna plug into one another unless

10
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,710
Speaker 5:  you engineer a solution. But you know that you're connected to

Speaker 5:  millions of people worldwide who are going through the exact same frustrating

12
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,170

Speaker 5:  Who all know what a dongle is? It's a real,

15
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,020
Speaker 5:  How do we end up here man?

16
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,430
Speaker 6:  I don't know man. I love a dongle though. I'm excited to talk about Dons

17
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,350
Speaker 7:  Mistakes were made, standards were organized, and standards

18
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,390
Speaker 7:  organizations are the

19
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,230
Speaker 5:  Problems. Oh my gosh. All right, well that voice you hear is

20
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,590
Speaker 5:  Richard Lawler. What's up Richard?

21
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,990
Speaker 7:  It's going on. Good to

22
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,550
Speaker 5:  Be back immediately joining the show with a spicy take. I love it

23
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,590
Speaker 5:  about standards organizations. That's how you know it's Avir has everybody.

24
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,360
Speaker 5:  Hell yes. Richard is here in place of David Pierce, who I believe

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,820
Speaker 5:  is in Texas.

26
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,150
Speaker 6:  What he went without

27
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,030
Speaker 5:  Me. I don't know. I just got a slack from him today and said I'm getting

28
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,870
Speaker 5:  on a flight in Texas. There was no shocking preview of this

29
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,060
Speaker 5:  slack. There was no follow up from this slack.

30
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,540
Speaker 6:  He's just the Texas now.

31
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,630
Speaker 5:  He's just in Texas now. It's big

32
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,790
Speaker 6:  State. It could be anywhere.

33
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,950
Speaker 7:  Everybody's getting into Formula One. That's that's what it

34
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,820
Speaker 5:  Is. So hopefully David comes back at some point.

35
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,390
Speaker 5:  I wish him well in Texas. I don't even know what part of Texas he's in. He

36
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,720
Speaker 5:  just said he was in Texas. But anyway, Richard's here. Alex Kranz is here.

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,000
Speaker 6:  Hello. I am very curious to know where in Texas David

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,780
Speaker 5:  Is. Well, if anyone in Texas sees David, let Alex know.

39
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,440
Speaker 6:  Let me know. Don't say hi to David. Just like be like, Hold on, I have to

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,310
Speaker 5:  Dm. Just take his picture on the street and send it to him.

41
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,440
Speaker 5:  It's surveillance. Yeah,

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,830
Speaker 6:  It's fine. That's, I've consented so it's okay.

43
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,760
Speaker 5:  It's not from above. It's from with it. It's surveillance. Yeah, right.

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,830
Speaker 5:  I'm your friend Eli. Welcome to Vergecast. There's a lot going on this week.

45
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,640
Speaker 5:  I was looking at the rundown before we started. Boy, this is gonna be a verge

46
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,080
Speaker 5:  cast. That's all I can say about this episode of the show. It's gonna be

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
Speaker 5:  one of the most a vergecast, a verge casts of all time. That's what I got

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,720
Speaker 5:  for you. We got new Apple stuff. Apple more committed to

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,320
Speaker 5:  dongles than ever. Yeah. I think Apple has decided to react to governments

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,120
Speaker 5:  around the world attempting to standardize ports by saying, Fine. Now

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,160
Speaker 5:  our shit will be more frustrating than you could possibly imagine. You

52
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,680
Speaker 6:  Want us to do it, we're gonna do it. And there'll be dongs. Hundreds of

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,350
Speaker 6:  dongs.

54
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,120
Speaker 5:  What combinations of magnets and Dons do you want

55
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,880
Speaker 5:  Europe? Cause you've never seen one like this. So there's a lot going on.

56
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,240
Speaker 5:  New iPads, new pet pro, new Apple tv, 4k, new

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,900
Speaker 5:  remote, new keyboard cases for these iPads,

58
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,360
Speaker 5:  the whole thing. Then Kanye West decided to buy

59
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,960
Speaker 5:  Parlor. Who knows why Netflix is really on password sharing.

60
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,520
Speaker 5:  Tesla had an earnings call. Foxconn did some Foxconn

61
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,440
Speaker 5:  stuff and Richard confidently told us before the show began that he's been

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,180
Speaker 5:  crypto pilled

63
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,520
Speaker 7:  And get everybody eventually.

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,400
Speaker 5:  Who knows what that means? I don't know. I don't

65
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Speaker 5:  know if that's true. I think the future, I think that's a complicated reverse

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,640
Speaker 5:  troll. Richard Lawler, just a ton going on.

67
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 5:  Let's start Obviously with Apple. I wanna say it's a weird

68
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,200
Speaker 5:  move, but Apple has done this before. They did not have an event. They just

69
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,430
Speaker 5:  issued a bunch of press releases and we were off we go.

70
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,270
Speaker 6:  They all, I mean they did do a video. You, you can go out and you can watch

71
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,040
Speaker 6:  a, like a 20 minute video and I guess if you like hunch

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Speaker 6:  forward and watch it really closely, you'll feel like you're watching the

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,470
Speaker 6:  normal like stream.

74
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,350
Speaker 5:  I didn't watch this video. Did you watch this video?

75
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,760
Speaker 6:  I watched part of it and then I was like, I don't have to watch this video.

76
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Cause I just go on the website and look at the stuff.

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,320
Speaker 6:  I got the press release. Yeah, I, I'm good, I'm ready to go. But they did

78
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,080
Speaker 6:  do a video this year.

79
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,560
Speaker 7:  We're practically in range of having the things in our hands. I I think I

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,000
Speaker 7:  can skip the video this time if I have the spec sheet. I'm good. I've seen

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,960
Speaker 7:  an iPad. Yeah.

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,480
Speaker 5:  Right. So this is the, this is the the weird

83
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,400
Speaker 5:  zone all these companies are in. You can have the big event, maintain

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,840
Speaker 5:  all the surprise, show the stuff to us in person. We love that.

85
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,720
Speaker 5:  Right. I'll sit through a video in your theater just to see the stuff in

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,200
Speaker 5:  person right away. That's a fine trade. And, and obviously like talk to executives

87
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,150
Speaker 5:  on the people and take pictures. All the stuff. Yeah, I'll, I'll good trade.

88
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,840
Speaker 5:  Then there's what Apple has been doing, which is virtual events where we

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Speaker 5:  all watch the video together short from the comfort of our homes.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,560
Speaker 5:  And then we all look at the spec

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,160
Speaker 6:  Sheets, the hold hands in the metaverse. Then

92
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,120
Speaker 5:  There's this, which is what if you would just put out all the spec sheets

93
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,040
Speaker 5:  right away and then also make this video in case what you you wanted was

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,160
Speaker 5:  to watch a video at home. And I would say this is the least effective of

95
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,430
Speaker 5:  the approaches to the modern product announcement.

96
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,180
Speaker 6:  A hundred percent.

97
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,680
Speaker 5:  But please don't go back to making us all stream the video first. I think

98
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,440
Speaker 5:  just put out the press releases. So they put out all the press releases.

99
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,630
Speaker 5:  Like lot lots of stuff.

100
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah, a lot of stuff. It's like a shocking, I was,

101
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,120
Speaker 6:  I was expecting like an iPad.

102
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,040
Speaker 7:  There was real

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,070
Speaker 6:  Surprise that we got two iPads. We got the Apple tv,

104
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,240
Speaker 7:  A lot of their events recently. I feel like we haven't had the surprise come

105
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,840
Speaker 7:  in. Yeah. But this time I, I was, I was actually shocked by some of the things.

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,880
Speaker 7:  It was good to have that back.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,510
Speaker 5:  What were you shocked by? What shocked you the best?

108
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,800
Speaker 7:  I didn't see a new Apple TV coming this week or two

109
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,720
Speaker 7:  New. That's, that's double. Okay. It's, it's not Okay.

110
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,230
Speaker 7:  It's, it's a new processor. Apple tv. It has a new, changed everything

111
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,370
Speaker 7:  from a newer iPhone. It is still the same. Yeah.

112
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,920
Speaker 5:  So yeah, the Apple TV is basically still the same. It has a 15 now

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,880
Speaker 5:  they've removed the fan, which most people did not even know the Apple TV

114
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,720
Speaker 5:  had a fan. But more recent Apple TVs have gigantic slow

115
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,120
Speaker 5:  fans in them now they don't have a fan. Here's the weird part about the app.

116
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,360
Speaker 5:  Well two weird things about these Apple TVs. This is what shocked me. One,

117
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,060
Speaker 5:  it's still expensive. They lowered the price to 1 29 for the base model

118
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,040
Speaker 5:  but it's still incredibly expensive. Like Rokus are

119
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,150
Speaker 5:  more or less free.

120
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,080
Speaker 6:  They, they Frisbee them to you when you walk into Walmart. Amazon is

121
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,560
Speaker 6:  just like automatically shipping them. You just sneeze in Amazon's

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,520
Speaker 5:  Direction. If you have Amazon Prime, you can get a fired TV stick for

123
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,200
Speaker 5:  nothing. Apple's at 1 29. So lower the price at 1 29. But that

124
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,030
Speaker 5:  1 29 model is really weird, right? It has it,

125
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,850
Speaker 5:  it's 64 gigs of storage. No ethernet.

126
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,570
Speaker 5:  So it's like, it's just a weird, it's like a more expensive cheap thing.

127
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,730
Speaker 6:  No fan.

128
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,640
Speaker 5:  No fan. They put an A 15 ship in it. People don't even know that. The old

129
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,720
Speaker 5:  Apple TV four case had fans and big slow fan at bottom and some meds. Now

130
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,160
Speaker 5:  they don't. Whatever. So that's 1 29 64 gig of storage wifi

131
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,140
Speaker 5:  only. Who is that for? Because for $20 more

132
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,000
Speaker 5:  you get double the storage. You get an ethernet port, which

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,600
Speaker 5:  if you are actually serious about streaming forecast, you probably want this

134
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,440
Speaker 5:  thing near some sort of hardwired connection. And then you get a

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,480
Speaker 5:  thread radio so you can support matter and have it be your home home. This

136
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,510
Speaker 5:  is like the easiest $20 you should spend. Yeah,

137
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:10,800
Speaker 6:  I

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,910
Speaker 5:  Like the most future proof $20 that you can have in your home.

139
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,470
Speaker 6:  I keep wondering why they didn't drop the price of the base model. One more.

140
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,360
Speaker 6:  Like if that had been a hundred dollars, $50 difference. I would,

141
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,980
Speaker 6:  I would still be, I would be here saying this is an outrageous price difference.

142
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,800
Speaker 6:  How dare they. But also it would make like more business sense for

143
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,320
Speaker 6:  Apple cuz they'd be pushing

144
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,200
Speaker 7:  It. It feels like they Motorola Oh yeah. Where it exists to go

145
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,120
Speaker 7:  on sale for $99. But like they don't

146
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,240
Speaker 7:  expect you to buy it for 1 29. They're just, they're gonna put it on sale

147
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,710
Speaker 7:  and they're gonna say, Hey man, we give you a discount.

148
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,400
Speaker 6:  This is the Ted lasso discount. You gotta watch season $300.

149
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. If you sign up for Apple tv, you get one of these for for free, right?

150
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Speaker 5:  Like or for in Bucks. Okay, maybe I'm still saying that 1 49 model,

151
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,840
Speaker 5:  you're you're gonna spend this much money in streaming box and you're not

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,480
Speaker 5:  getting an Nvidia Shield from My Shield people out there, of which Alex is

153
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,040
Speaker 5:  one. Definitely.

154
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,260
Speaker 6:  It's still the best

155
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,680
Speaker 5:  One. Yes. Super. Not the best.

156
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,410
Speaker 6:  Cause it it it, because you can do pass through, you can do audio pass through

157
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,120
Speaker 6:  to your receiver, which the Apple converts. The Apple

158
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,000
Speaker 6:  TV converts the audio. And so if you're really serious about your

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,630
Speaker 6:  home theater audio. That's true. That's the only reason to get the shield.

160
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,560
Speaker 6:  I like, I love them both. I still get the, I still use the Apple TV because

161
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,000
Speaker 6:  I also use a Sotos bar. I don't care about pass through.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,810
Speaker 8:  It's truly the only way to, to do plex.

163
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,920
Speaker 5:  Oh my god. That's not

164
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,760
Speaker 8:  True the right way.

165
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,720
Speaker 5:  And and did you know it can gently warm your weed for you while you run

166
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,330
Speaker 5:  flexible? Yeah,

167
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,430
Speaker 6:  It could do everything. It's a magical device.

168
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,320
Speaker 5:  Anyhow. See I believe its good. It's really expensive.

169
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
Speaker 5:  I, I like it but you should just spend the money for the really good

170
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,280
Speaker 5:  one because it's $20. So

171
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,680
Speaker 6:  Like

172
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,830
Speaker 5:  It's just a bizarre situation.

173
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,600
Speaker 6:  It's super weird. And also the storage, I keep coming back to

174
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,320
Speaker 6:  like why do I need so much storage on my Apple tv? I can

175
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,880
Speaker 6:  understand like Ram, you know, and I could understand like wanting to load

176
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,960
Speaker 6:  up more of the movie or whatever that you're streaming so it can serve directly.

177
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,240
Speaker 6:  So it's not like I get that but

178
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
Speaker 5:  It's games people, Some people put games on Apple tv. That's what I got for

179
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,320
Speaker 5:  you. It's

180
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,520
Speaker 6:  How many, if

181
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,600
Speaker 7:  If you did gaming on Apple TV then I guess it would matter. I just think

182
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,560
Speaker 7:  it's so strange that now it supports both Doby vision and HDR 10 plus.

183
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,400
Speaker 7:  I can't, I can't think of exactly how many devices have

184
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,560
Speaker 5:  That. Oh this is the Samsung. The

185
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,440
Speaker 7:  Samsung hdr,

186
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,930
Speaker 6:  Samsung H

187
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,500
Speaker 7:  Hs, Doby vision. Usually you have to choose. Yeah there there are a few

188
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
Speaker 6:  But HS has HDR 10.

189
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,520
Speaker 5:  Well so if you just, if you just look at it So boy talk

190
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,030
Speaker 5:  about standard bodies Richard. This is why standards bodies should be abolished.

191
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,920
Speaker 5:  I should be in charge just the feudal lord of all

192
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,680
Speaker 5:  tech standards. Ne I Patel vote Patel but really in sort of a dictator

193
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,270
Speaker 5:  way

194
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,810
Speaker 6:  It's a great glow up.

195
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,680
Speaker 5:  So Adobe Vision is a standard. Apple supported huge fanfare. Apple's

196
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,760
Speaker 5:  one of the biggest supporters of Adobe Vision. They put in the Apple tv.

197
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,380
Speaker 5:  The iPhone supports it. Max support it. Apple loves Adobe vision.

198
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,320
Speaker 5:  You can record Adobe Vision on an iPhone. Samsung has never supported

199
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,900
Speaker 5:  Adobe Vision. Yeah it's always supported HDR 10 and then HDR 10 plus

200
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,580
Speaker 5:  the difference between HDR 10 and HDR 10 plus is effectively

201
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,380
Speaker 5:  the difference between Adobe Vision HDR 10. So

202
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,200
Speaker 5:  HDR 10 has the same wider dynamic range. Bright,

203
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,160
Speaker 5:  bright things get brighter, things get darker. Is Adobe vision same

204
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,760
Speaker 5:  wider color gamut? To a certain extent Adobe Vision has

205
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,240
Speaker 5:  dynamic metadata so it moves the dynamic

206
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,400
Speaker 5:  range along with the scene. That's how the compression works. HDR 10 is

207
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,080
Speaker 5:  fixed 10 plus metadata. Now you can

208
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,040
Speaker 5:  argue about the fine dis distinctions between all of

209
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,760
Speaker 5:  these things. I think Adobe vision looks better than HCR 10 plus other people

210
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,840
Speaker 5:  can't see it. Whatever. But now the technology is the same. Samsung just

211
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,200
Speaker 5:  refused to support Adobe Vision, any of its TVs. They were totally committed

212
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,450
Speaker 5:  HDR 10 plus as was Amazon

213
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,170
Speaker 6:  Because they didn't wanna pay because Doby vision you have to pay

214
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,080
Speaker 6:  to like use their product. You have to pay to like master all of your stuff.

215
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,040
Speaker 6:  Like you have to go through a process with Doby vision and HDR 10

216
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,160
Speaker 6:  plus they can just be like oh bam, that's HDR 10 plus baby

217
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Speaker 6:  enjoy

218
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,100
Speaker 5:  There. And there's like just weird mafia level licensing

219
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,720
Speaker 5:  shenanigans in the background of all this whatever. But Samsung sells a lot

220
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,560
Speaker 5:  of TVs so at some point it was just who was gonna blink

221
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,400
Speaker 5:  first? Was the industry gonna just support HCR 10 plus cuz it's on all the

222
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,120
Speaker 5:  Samsung TVs or Samsung gonna be like screw it, we're paying the money and

223
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,980
Speaker 5:  we're gonna support Adobe vision. Cause all the services are on Adobe vision

224
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,780
Speaker 5:  and it looks like Samsung won like just, they just flatly won

225
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,760
Speaker 5:  And now Apple, the biggest booster of Adobe vision is shipping HDR 10 plus

226
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,550
Speaker 5:  in the Apple tv.

227
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,320
Speaker 6:  I don't know if they won because they still have to get like all of the

228
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,680
Speaker 6:  different people making content have to start mastering in HDR 10

229
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,360
Speaker 6:  plus. And most a lot of them are still mastering in

230
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,630
Speaker 6:  Doy vision in HDR 10. They're not doing that. That metadata.

231
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,300
Speaker 7:  They do have like Netflix and Amazon had at least some

232
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,160
Speaker 7:  HDR 10 plus stuff I believe. Or at least I know Amazon did. I can't remember.

233
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,480
Speaker 7:  Netflix

234
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,240
Speaker 6:  Was actually TV is now gonna be doing some, like everybody is slowly

235
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
Speaker 6:  kind of doing it but they're all irritated cuz they still have to like go,

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Speaker 6:  okay now they have to do an HDR 10 master. Now they have to do an HDR 10

237
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
Speaker 6:  plus master and Adobe Vision Master.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,710
Speaker 5:  But I think if you get the HDR 10 plus master, it's easier to go.

239
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,600
Speaker 5:  It's easier to go fall back to H Tier 10 for sure. It might

240
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,680
Speaker 5:  be easier to go back and forth between Adobe Vision. I just, this is what

241
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,440
Speaker 5:  I said, I told you'd be the ver caste vercast of all time, but

242
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,920
Speaker 6:  It'll be ugly. Here you go. It won't be as pretty as Doby vision.

243
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,640
Speaker 7:  How many profiles of Doby Vision does your TV support? Let's get into it.

244
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we'll see, I mean I'm, I'm dying to see Apple never really

245
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,280
Speaker 5:  figured out this big plan. They had to run everything

246
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,240
Speaker 5:  in Adobe vision including the user interface and then dynamically

247
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,080
Speaker 5:  remap into SDR and now potentially in

248
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,760
Speaker 5:  HCR 10 plus because that's what Amazon's app supports. That was

249
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,060
Speaker 5:  what the Apple TV shipped with this. Yeah. Where the whole thing

250
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,960
Speaker 5:  permanently ran in Adobe Vision and they would dynamically

251
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,880
Speaker 5:  remap content. It's just like didn't work. So that's where you get match

252
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,560
Speaker 5:  content and frame rate and that's how you should run your Apple tv. Now you

253
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Speaker 5:  can now that now there's another thing to switch to. So we'll see if they

254
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,600
Speaker 5:  can get to a place which is where everybody wants to be, where you're doing

255
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,590
Speaker 5:  this seamlessly without blinking the TV to black.

256
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,410
Speaker 6:  I do wonder though, Apple's always had kind of an issue with the hand shaking

257
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,280
Speaker 6:  on Doby vision and like it's this thing called edited and

258
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,240
Speaker 6:  it's basically when your your set top box handshakes with

259
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,160
Speaker 6:  your TV and says this is the kind of signal I'm gonna send. Apple can sometimes

260
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,000
Speaker 6:  be really wonky about that. And you have to very specifically set up your

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,800
Speaker 6:  Apple TV to get the handshake right. To get it in Doby vision. And I

262
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,400
Speaker 6:  wonder if like we're gonna see some weird HHA issues with these new ones

263
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,760
Speaker 6:  where it's like HDR 10 HDR Doby vision. Who

264
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,600
Speaker 6:  knows? Yeah. Because that's been like a big frustration

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,270
Speaker 6:  for new Apple TV users

266
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,960
Speaker 5:  When they roll out new TVs and new versions of the H G M I standard. Every

267
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,720
Speaker 5:  year they have plug parties. Usually you'll listen to the HTM I

268
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
Speaker 5:  spectacular episode of the VER Chance. They talk about this. All the manufacturers

269
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,720
Speaker 5:  show up, all their engineers show up with all their stuff and they just plug

270
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
Speaker 5:  things into one another. It's great to make sure it all works. I've always

271
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
Speaker 5:  wanted to go to one

272
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,400
Speaker 6:  But it almost never does.

273
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,800
Speaker 5:  Well that's why

274
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Speaker 6:  They, the eat it is like really like Apple's kind of notorious for having

275
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,520
Speaker 6:  one of the best ed like that handshake. But it's also still

276
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,280
Speaker 6:  kind of like wonky. Everybody's kind of crummy at it. It's great.

277
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,620
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I love it.

278
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,600
Speaker 5:  All right, well if you are attending an HG m I plug party, let me

279
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,680
Speaker 5:  know May I'll just come with you. Yeah, I'll just pretend I work at your

280
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:30,800
Speaker 5:  company.

281
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,520
Speaker 6:  You'll be your their

282
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,320
Speaker 5:  Plus one at the HT I plug party. So

283
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,800
Speaker 7:  We're gonna talk about this thing for 10 minutes and not talk about the most

284
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,480
Speaker 7:  important development.

285
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,760
Speaker 5:  All right,

286
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,600
Speaker 7:  Go ahead. The remote has usbc now I'm

287
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Speaker 5:  Just worried. I'm like, I'm like you can't feel it. There's an anxiety building.

288
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,240
Speaker 5:  I'm not. It doesn't crypto

289
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,120
Speaker 6:  Richard, go ahead. Why? What's

290
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,840
Speaker 7:  Exciting? The remote has USBC now it doesn't have

291
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,400
Speaker 5:  Like talk about your plug parties. So

292
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,750
Speaker 5:  this is the year where

293
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,580
Speaker 5:  Apple's bullshit about USBC is catching up to it. Yeah, it is

294
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,540
Speaker 5:  fully the year. Like all of these devices are

295
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,480
Speaker 5:  all over the place because Apple didn't just go with the standard

296
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,260
Speaker 5:  and they shipped lightning all over the place. So the Apple TV remote for

297
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,460
Speaker 5:  years has been a lightning. I'll tell you you don't have to charge it very

298
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,540
Speaker 5:  often. It's like every six months.

299
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,260
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I've been charged mine in like a year.

300
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,900
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So then, and this year with the update, now it's usbc, this is fine.

301
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,530
Speaker 5:  People probably have USBC connectors in their homes. Now

302
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,100
Speaker 5:  Europe has mandated USBC for new devices.

303
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,500
Speaker 6:  Apparently they don't include a USBC cable, but

304
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,610
Speaker 5:  There's no cable in the box. And this is what I mean

305
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,380
Speaker 7:  Unless, unless you live in Brazil, then you can get a USBC cable in the box

306
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,620
Speaker 5:  Because the Brazilian government is like, what are you doing? You have to

307
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,580
Speaker 5:  put cables in the box. This is what I mean like apples just like got its

308
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,530
Speaker 5:  middle finger in there. It's like you want usbc, it'll be the most annoying,

309
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,220
Speaker 5:  most difficult implementation of this possible. So no cables in the

310
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,980
Speaker 5:  box. It's different than all your other stuff. We didn't do the phones this

311
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,490
Speaker 5:  year. Whatever.

312
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,450
Speaker 6:  Wait Richard, I dunno man. Does the box have like a different layout?

313
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,620
Speaker 6:  Like how do they fit the cable in there? They don't know. Like does it just

314
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,770
Speaker 6:  come taped on the side with a big middle finger?

315
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,350
Speaker 7:  I, I think people figured this out by looking at the website spec sheets.

316
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,500
Speaker 7:  So I don't know if anyone's actually seen the packaging yet.

317
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,020
Speaker 6:  Somebody sent Richard, not me a photo but

318
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,700
Speaker 7:  I I bet there's just an empty slot in every other global

319
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,900
Speaker 7:  release and you're like, Huh, what's

320
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,320
Speaker 6:  That for? That's for the Brazilians.

321
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,220
Speaker 5:  All right. So that, but the Apple TV going to USBC is kinda

322
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,900
Speaker 5:  like neither here nor there, right? Like yeah it's remote, you plug it in

323
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,340
Speaker 5:  once a year, you probably one of these cables in your house. So be it. Unless

324
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,780
Speaker 5:  you're like deeply in the Apple ecosystem and all you have is

325
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,800
Speaker 5:  lightning

326
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,700
Speaker 6:  And like one micro USB cable, you're just like,

327
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,020
Speaker 6:  no, have fun going

328
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,620
Speaker 5:  To micro. It's very funny. There's no way to charge this thing unless you

329
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,380
Speaker 5:  have USBC already in your house. Like you just get it and your remote doesn't

330
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,220
Speaker 5:  work and you're screwed. So it goes, that one's fine. It's the iPad. So

331
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,160
Speaker 5:  wait, that's so that's the The Apple tv. Yeah. Right. The, It's surprising

332
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,900
Speaker 5:  how the prices work. It's surprising that Apple caved on

333
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,390
Speaker 5:  HDR 10 plus. It's a little surprising on usbc but like whatever.

334
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,210
Speaker 6:  It's a surprising they announced it. We were It's surprising it. Yeah.

335
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,640
Speaker 5:  If anyone thought we weren't gonna start with the Apple tv, I don't know

336
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,240
Speaker 5:  what show you thought you were listening to. Of course we like deep in the

337
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,080
Speaker 5:  Adobe vision profiles. It's the VER cast. Right? Then there was the stuff

338
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,000
Speaker 5:  we were expecting, which was new iPads and I think we were

339
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Speaker 5:  all expecting the new iPad Pro, which we can get through very quickly I think.

340
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,370
Speaker 5:  But we should come back to, because it's also caught up in this USBC noise.

341
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,360
Speaker 5:  So the new iPad has an M two chip has wifi six E, which is Apple's first

342
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,920
Speaker 5:  wifi six E device. It's a great, unless you

343
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,860
Speaker 6:  It's wonderful.

344
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,160
Speaker 5:  Use more wifi channels in your home if you have wifi six e router, which

345
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,070
Speaker 5:  I just bought. I pro six s. They're great. Super

346
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,760
Speaker 5:  stupid expensive. And I only bought them because I

347
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Speaker 5:  podcast from home twice a week.

348
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,760
Speaker 6:  You look wonderful today. I was, I was thinking there was something a little

349
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,000
Speaker 6:  different about you today and it's

350
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
Speaker 5:  Easy. An extra 50 megahertz of bandwidth on

351
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,800
Speaker 6:  The

352
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,520
Speaker 5:  Hell. Yeah, that's, I don't know what that is. It's the sun's low in the

353
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:54,640
Speaker 5:  sky.

354
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,790
Speaker 6:  It's a 50 megahertz difference.

355
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,360
Speaker 5:  It's a 50 megahertz, not bandwidth of spectrum. That's what I'm doing.

356
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,000
Speaker 5:  It's, yeah, I'm not even doing that. There's IMAX from 2015. This thing is

357
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,160
Speaker 5:  probably on 2.4 gigahertz. I just have routers that don't crash in two minutes.

358
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,800
Speaker 5:  That's, I bought new ones. That's all that happened. Anyway, so the iPad

359
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Speaker 5:  Pro has M two wifi 60, otherwise same design, same

360
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,000
Speaker 5:  features,

361
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,540
Speaker 6:  Same displays.

362
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,320
Speaker 5:  Yep. Same Boulder rolling down the hill of stage manager when

363
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,680
Speaker 5:  iPad OS 16 comes out. Same, Same displays, right?

364
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Lc displays no changes. Just

365
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,360
Speaker 6:  Display the micro L e D display in the the iPad. The

366
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,180
Speaker 6:  12 inch.

367
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,830
Speaker 5:  Yep.

368
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,800
Speaker 6:  That I remember Chris Welch wasn't a great fan of last year. He thought

369
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,200
Speaker 6:  there was like some weird roll off for

370
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,040
Speaker 5:  The light. There's living with those in weird ways. Yeah. But I've always

371
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Speaker 5:  liked them. It's weird but the 11 does not get micro. That's

372
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,440
Speaker 6:  What I was holding out for. I was so excited for an 11 inch with Micro and

373
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,280
Speaker 6:  I was like, oh well I won't spend way too much money on an iPad

374
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,430
Speaker 6:  Pro I don't need now. It's a whole reason.

375
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,510
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Take that Tim Apple.

376
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I really

377
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,800
Speaker 5:  Showed him Instead I'll be buying Dons from you at $29 a

378
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,680
Speaker 5:  pop. Okay, so that's say I've had pro but

379
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,390
Speaker 5:  then there's a new iPad, right? Which is totally redesigned.

380
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,320
Speaker 5:  Bigger screen. Us bbc, the camera has been moved so

381
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,400
Speaker 5:  it's at the top in landscape, new keyboard cover, old pencil.

382
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,190
Speaker 6:  But it was redesigned. The weirdest pencil.

383
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,160
Speaker 6:  Like everything about this kind of shocked me. One, I didn't expect a total

384
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Speaker 6:  new redesign because normally we, that's like, like Apple for these

385
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,800
Speaker 6:  press releases is usually like here's a little, the M two and the iPad Pro

386
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,920
Speaker 6:  go. And I'm like okay, I get that. I don't need to see that in person. This

387
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,560
Speaker 6:  is a whole new device. So I was expecting like I would've expected a lot

388
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,440
Speaker 6:  of big things. Yeah. But then I think about that pencil and I

389
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,000
Speaker 6:  think about like all of the pictures in the apple in the jobs

390
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,040
Speaker 6:  theater of people playing with that dongle and that pencil.

391
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,160
Speaker 5:  Beautiful pencil. Oh

392
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,440
Speaker 6:  My god. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I get it. I get why you couldn't do

393
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,960
Speaker 6:  an event for

394
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,320
Speaker 5:  This guy. You just wanna hide the pencil from people. Yeah,

395
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,880
Speaker 6:  Don't

396
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,360
Speaker 5:  Look, this device is full of compromises. So a

397
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,320
Speaker 5:  10.9 inch display new, the new flatter edges to the same kind

398
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,120
Speaker 5:  of dis same kind of design language. They had air and the pro, they

399
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,520
Speaker 5:  updated the cameras. Like I said, they moved the front camera to landscape

400
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,240
Speaker 5:  wifi six. So Apple's finally like adopting wifi six across its

401
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,080
Speaker 5:  line touch id in a power button. I complained about this

402
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,040
Speaker 5:  on Twitter and people were like, you know ly mad at me. Apple keeps

403
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,750
Speaker 5:  saying this is an all screen design.

404
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,230
Speaker 6:  It's got a bezzle

405
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,840
Speaker 5:  Dude, the bes on this thing are like, go watch the video. This is a reason

406
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,120
Speaker 5:  you should watch the video. Like, cause they show the thing a lot and you're

407
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,080
Speaker 5:  like, oh those bezels are huge. Like you could, like,

408
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,320
Speaker 6:  You could

409
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,560
Speaker 5:  Live in that. And I understand that they're not calling it edge to edge now

410
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,020
Speaker 5:  they're saying it's all screen. What is the difference between all screen

411
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,870
Speaker 5:  and edge to edge display? Those things mean the same thing.

412
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,510
Speaker 7:  This has HP touch pad bezels.

413
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,200
Speaker 5:  Well, okay, just close your eyes. Pull over in your car, close your eyes.

414
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,610
Speaker 5:  Imagine this. Let's just go through this exercise. Okay,

415
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,600
Speaker 5:  imagine the bezels were 10 times

416
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,520
Speaker 5:  thicker. So it was like a little tiny display in lots of

417
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,280
Speaker 5:  bezels, right? But otherwise the same. Would you call

418
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,870
Speaker 5:  that an all screen display or an all screen design?

419
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,440
Speaker 6:  I, I mean I would if I worked at Apple,

420
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Speaker 5:  Right? I'm saying, but people are like, I'm like this is not all screen.

421
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,680
Speaker 5:  And people are like, yeah it is. There's nothing else with screen. Okay.

422
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,480
Speaker 5:  Just like push it out. Imagine the screen was four

423
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,760
Speaker 5:  inches but it was the same size case and there was just that much bezzle

424
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,400
Speaker 5:  around it. And I was like, this is an all screen design. Would you agree

425
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,160
Speaker 5:  with me? I mean no you wouldn't cuz you're not bonkers.

426
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no.

427
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,120
Speaker 5:  Cause words have meanings. Now imagine the screen, there's no

428
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,000
Speaker 5:  bezel. And I was like, this is an all screen design. Would you agree? Yes,

429
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,810
Speaker 5:  of course you would. Yeah. So there's at some point between

430
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,760
Speaker 5:  filling to the edges in a little postage stamp with five inch

431
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,560
Speaker 5:  bezels where you can no longer get to say it's all screen

432
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,160
Speaker 5:  somewhere in

433
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,080
Speaker 6:  The middle. And this is where you, you, you are at the point right now where

434
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,520
Speaker 6:  you're like, this is not all screen. Richard are, this is not all screen.

435
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,020
Speaker 6:  Do you feel it's all screen?

436
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,280
Speaker 7:  You gotta hear both sides. You gotta hear both sides. You gotta hear both

437
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,320
Speaker 7:  sides. The screen is all screen,

438
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,390
Speaker 7:  right.

439
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,960
Speaker 5:  I agree that the screen is all screen,

440
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,280
Speaker 7:  The screen is nothing but screen. There's nothing but screen where the screen

441
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,160
Speaker 7:  is. There's no notch, there's no porthole. Little for the front facing

442
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,870
Speaker 7:  camera, nothing like that. It's just screen. That's all. It's all screen.

443
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,600
Speaker 5:  Okay, so you're saying it's what you mean by it's an all screen screen

444
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,260
Speaker 5:  design. Yes.

445
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,680
Speaker 7:  Got

446
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,360
Speaker 5:  It. Yes. By the way, even the thing is an all screen cuz there's a camera

447
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,280
Speaker 5:  there like definitionally, it's

448
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,840
Speaker 5:  an all screen end camera design. Ah,

449
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,680
Speaker 5:  right. So that's the I that they've added USBC data. But

450
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,530
Speaker 5:  because they went with the old pencil, the old pencil charges with lightning

451
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,400
Speaker 5:  in a famous Johnny Ive design decision, you charge the old

452
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,110
Speaker 5:  pencil by plugging it into the lightning port of the old iPad.

453
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,600
Speaker 6:  It's

454
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,590
Speaker 5:  Beautiful. But now, so now what you do is you plug a

455
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,200
Speaker 5:  USBC cable into the, your new iPad and then you plug a

456
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,160
Speaker 5:  $9 dongle, which is female usbc. So you

457
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,230
Speaker 5:  plug your cable into that and then female lightning. So you plug your lightning

458
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,950
Speaker 5:  pencil into the other end. And my god man,

459
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,190
Speaker 6:  I, so I actually like the dongle.

460
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,020
Speaker 5:  Okay.

461
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,000
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm sorry. I like, I don't like the dongle in that. I want to

462
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Speaker 6:  own one. But I like that they were like, okay, we only

463
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,580
Speaker 6:  wanna use the old pencil. Why? Well so now we've gotta plug it in

464
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,590
Speaker 6:  and we wanna go

465
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,000
Speaker 5:  Usbc. They make a new, they've made it for years, but

466
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,560
Speaker 6:  It'll be charged by magnets. And they're like, we can't do the magnets cuz

467
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,760
Speaker 6:  cuz it's gonna mess with like the camera or something. And so we can't, no

468
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,500
Speaker 6:  magnets. So we gotta use the old pencil that has the goofiest way of charge

469
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,180
Speaker 6:  and we gotta plug it in. But we can't just sell somebody a cord

470
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,480
Speaker 6:  cuz they would've sold you a cable. They wouldn't have included a cable.

471
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,400
Speaker 6:  They would sell you a cable that's female lightning on one

472
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,240
Speaker 6:  side and USBC on the other and like that's a terrible

473
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,040
Speaker 6:  cord. You can never use that again. And now you just like, you got your little

474
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,570
Speaker 6:  dongle and you plug it into your USBC cable and you're good to go.

475
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,560
Speaker 5:  My theory is when Apple rolled out this Apple pencil years ago,

476
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,280
Speaker 5:  they were like, people are gonna love this thing. And they made like 10

477
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:12,040
Speaker 5:  million of them. Yeah. They were riding high. Maybe Tim Cook

478
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,770
Speaker 5:  pressed the zero on his number pad one too many times.

479
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,120
Speaker 5:  He just made too many of 'em. And they're all in warehouse. They're like,

480
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,400
Speaker 5:  you know what, we're just gonna get rid of them over time. But they could

481
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,950
Speaker 5:  just

482
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,520
Speaker 7:  Keep you one. I'm, I'm going to absolutely purloin to take from news reporter.

483
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,360
Speaker 7:  I'm a Shakira who pointed out that one, one explanation

484
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,560
Speaker 7:  and I think it holds some weight, is that a lot of schools have have iPads,

485
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,360
Speaker 7:  the base model iPad that we're talking about. And they have a lot of those

486
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,280
Speaker 7:  pencils already. So making it work with the old pencil, they don't have

487
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,040
Speaker 7:  to replace the pencils.

488
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,190
Speaker 5:  Why can't you support both things?

489
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,960
Speaker 7:  Amen. Technology's

490
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,200
Speaker 6:  Well, they're already gonna be all of those. They're gonna want all of those

491
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,320
Speaker 6:  schools to go and update to the new iPad, which is now what,

492
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,950
Speaker 6:  $150 more. A hundred dollars more.

493
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So we gotta talk about the pricing because it, this thing is really

494
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,240
Speaker 5:  expensive.

495
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,620
Speaker 6:  Really expensive

496
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,520
Speaker 5:  For, for what? It's, so it's 4 49 for the 64 gig model. The old

497
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,160
Speaker 5:  version started 3 29. The three 20 iPad was like this

498
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,880
Speaker 5:  close. I don't think it was an impulse buy, it was still too expensive for

499
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,150
Speaker 5:  that. But it was like teetering on the edge.

500
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it

501
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,920
Speaker 5:  Had like had 2 52 99 is like, I'm gonna buy this my kid that can break it.

502
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,280
Speaker 5:  Right. 3 29 right on the other side, frequently discounted. Right? You could

503
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,920
Speaker 5:  buy a resource when you buy used one or whatever. 4 49 is no longer in that

504
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,520
Speaker 5:  territory. That's

505
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,310
Speaker 6:  Just a hundred dollars less than an iPad Air.

506
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's it's weird. It's weird. And then the keyboard is another

507
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,520
Speaker 5:  $250. We should talk about this keyboard. They, it's what's it called? The

508
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,240
Speaker 5:  magic smart Folio. Yep.

509
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,880
Speaker 6:  Magic or the 10.9 inch iPad, like

510
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,110
Speaker 6:  the,

511
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,080
Speaker 5:  It's magic keyboard for the, the 10.9 inch iPad. It's got a

512
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,370
Speaker 5:  track pad, it's got buttons, it's got function keys.

513
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:47,720
Speaker 6:  Oh

514
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,200
Speaker 5:  I love that. Which is another really interesting addition from Apple to the

515
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,520
Speaker 5:  iPad line, this thing. And it's got a kickstand so it

516
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,400
Speaker 5:  effectively turns the new iPad into a surface, you know, and there's,

517
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,720
Speaker 5:  there's an arm surface, but

518
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,240
Speaker 6:  Only this cheapest iPad has the function

519
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,840
Speaker 6:  keys.

520
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,390
Speaker 5:  Right. So the iPad Pro still has the same keyboard

521
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,950
Speaker 5:  case with no function keys and no kicks stick. I can't defend that one.

522
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,810
Speaker 6:  I believe you mean the magic keyboard folio for 12.9 inch iPad Pro.

523
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,010
Speaker 6:  We have to use the right names.

524
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,760
Speaker 5:  Oh my god. I dunno. There's

525
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,560
Speaker 5:  something here where Apple is just caught in the middle. Yeah,

526
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,480
Speaker 5:  right. They didn't update the new iPad. If they had

527
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,440
Speaker 5:  just moved the camera to the side and added function keys to the

528
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,680
Speaker 5:  keyboard would've made a little sense. They didn't do any of that to that

529
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,160
Speaker 5:  iPad. They just bumped the processor. This iPad's like a

530
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,120
Speaker 5:  substantial redesign. It is clearly designed to be used in

531
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,960
Speaker 5:  a laptop mode, right Landscape, front facing camera keyboard

532
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,880
Speaker 5:  case with function keys. A surface like Kickout

533
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,600
Speaker 5:  design, slightly more expensive. This is the

534
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,960
Speaker 5:  iPad is the low end laptop replacement. This is the iPad that goes up against

535
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,840
Speaker 5:  the 500, 600, $700 cheap Windows pc High end Crow

536
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,800
Speaker 5:  book I guess. Yeah. It's weird. It's a weird product but

537
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,680
Speaker 6:  It's $700

538
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,640
Speaker 5:  And they're keeping the 3 29 model in the lineup. It's not going away like

539
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,010
Speaker 5:  it usually does. Yeah,

540
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,550
Speaker 6:  No, I thought Monica did a wonderful story this week,

541
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,380
Speaker 6:  just like trying to wrap her head around why this thing exists

542
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,040
Speaker 6:  and pointed out that okay, if you get it, you have to get the key like, and

543
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,800
Speaker 6:  you wanna use it as a laptop, you have to go get the keyboard. So now you're

544
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,520
Speaker 6:  spending two, $700 so now you're spending $700 on this

545
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,800
Speaker 6:  thing. And for that you can get a really nice Windows

546
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,760
Speaker 6:  machine that does all the things and isn't like the iPad os,

547
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,130
Speaker 6:  which we all enjoy. But also it is not a laptop

548
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,230
Speaker 6:  os

549
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,810
Speaker 5:  I will say Monica put a line in this piece, which is very good.

550
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,220
Speaker 5:  It's called the new iPad. Makes no sense. You'll read it but in the middle

551
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,260
Speaker 5:  of she's like, it's not a computer. I don't care what you say. And I was

552
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,050
Speaker 5:  like, wow. Strong words for ver.com.

553
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,310
Speaker 5:  The website founded on the notion that we should just argue about what words

554
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,190
Speaker 5:  mean for the rest of our lives. But I get what she's saying.

555
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,450
Speaker 6:  Monica was like, no line in the sand.

556
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,590
Speaker 5:  She was like, it's not a computer. Our laptop reviewer was like, this garbage

557
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,190
Speaker 5:  isn't a computer but they're obviously trying to get it to compete.

558
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,590
Speaker 5:  She's she's earned, she's earned the take. She's earned the take. She's she's

559
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,510
Speaker 5:  earned the take. But it's weird right? Because the surface, the arm

560
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,250
Speaker 5:  surface is this form factor. Exactly. This is Microsofts form factor.

561
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,720
Speaker 5:  And the arm surface is also limited in what apps can run. Right. Because

562
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,670
Speaker 5:  Windows on arm, we'll see what it's bad life is like, but this new iPad

563
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,300
Speaker 5:  is more of a head up competitor to the surface than ever before. It's just,

564
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,390
Speaker 5:  it's cheaper but then they can't do as much cuz it's iPad os it can't run.

565
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,230
Speaker 5:  This one can't run stage manager. Cause it's not an iPad Pro. Just a

566
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,960
Speaker 5:  weird product all the way around. Like, I'm not sure what Apple is doing,

567
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,600
Speaker 5:  doing. I'm not sure why they went USBC on this one and then didn't do the

568
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:44,720
Speaker 5:  first

569
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,410
Speaker 6:  I forgot about the piles. I'm sorry, I forgot that. It doesn't do the piles.

570
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,320
Speaker 5:  It doesn't do piles.

571
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,260
Speaker 6:  No piles.

572
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,240
Speaker 5:  One thing I'll say log check updated it's crayon, which is also what's

573
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,120
Speaker 5:  what schools by USBC port. You just plug USBC cable right

574
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,200
Speaker 5:  into this thing. That's

575
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,940
Speaker 6:  The way to do it

576
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,920
Speaker 5:  Out done. But

577
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,640
Speaker 6:  Maybe they can just break off that lightning part of it. Snap it

578
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,190
Speaker 6:  off.

579
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,120
Speaker 5:  I don't get it man. And here's, there's somebody who has given a ninth

580
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,040
Speaker 5:  gen iPad to a child. Actually not having a home button is

581
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,350
Speaker 5:  gonna be is weird. It's gonna be weird for a lot of people.

582
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,610
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

583
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,440
Speaker 5:  So we'll see. We got a whole episode whenever David comes back

584
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,880
Speaker 5:  from wherever he is in Texas, he's gonna do a whole Wednesday episode on

585
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,400
Speaker 5:  the iPad. How to even pick one. David has more feelings about stage manager

586
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,420
Speaker 5:  than anybody.

587
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,040
Speaker 6:  The most

588
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,840
Speaker 5:  Feelings today before he DMed me about being in Texas, he,

589
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,080
Speaker 5:  he had dug up a story that I had written for End Gadget in like

590
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,000
Speaker 5:  2008 where Steve Jobs was talking about task managers and

591
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,840
Speaker 5:  what they represent to people. I was like, I don't remember writing this.

592
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,720
Speaker 5:  David's like, I found it. I'm like, God. So that's coming Wednesday very

593
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,350
Speaker 5:  good. But yeah, just a weird set of products

594
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,120
Speaker 5:  from Apple and this USBC moment for Apple is coming

595
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,730
Speaker 5:  and it just feels like the company hasn't grabbed onto

596
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,600
Speaker 5:  it yet. You know what I mean? Like it, it didn't go all the

597
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,240
Speaker 5:  way. It seems like it's fighting. It is like what I would say.

598
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I don't think Apple wants to do usbc. I think this is

599
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,760
Speaker 6:  shocking. But they're,

600
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,280
Speaker 7:  They're being dragged through the door kicking and screaming and flowing

601
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,840
Speaker 7:  into the floor.

602
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,830
Speaker 6:  I don't think they wanna do it.

603
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,760
Speaker 5:  I want to be clear about this. Apple invented usbc. The

604
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,680
Speaker 5:  standard exists because Apple wanted it to exist for that 12 inch

605
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,280
Speaker 5:  MacBook. They were so proud of it when that MacBook came out and now they're

606
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,800
Speaker 5:  like, How dare you force us to use the standard that we

607
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,320
Speaker 5:  invented.

608
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,880
Speaker 6:  Sometimes your children portray you and this is one of those moments. I'm

609
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,360
Speaker 6:  sorry Tim Apple. Let's roll

610
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,560
Speaker 5:  That. All right, we gotta take a break. Told you. This is ver Cassie vs.

611
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,040
Speaker 5:  We'll be right

612
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,740
Speaker 5:  back.

613
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,280
Speaker 5:  Okay, we're back. Lots of other news this week. So Netflix had a

614
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,240
Speaker 5:  bunch of news. They had earnings, Tesla had earnings. Elon Musk said

615
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,160
Speaker 5:  he was never gonna be on an earnings hall again. Guess what? He was

616
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,760
Speaker 5:  on this earnings hall, talked a bunch, both started Netflix. Richard walks

617
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,150
Speaker 7:  Through it. Netflix has had an interesting pandemic.

618
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,920
Speaker 7:  They, when everyone came home, suddenly

619
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,680
Speaker 7:  everyone subscribed to Netflix and their subscriber numbers exploded

620
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,520
Speaker 7:  way beyond their projections. Just really, they kind of gobbled up

621
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,260
Speaker 7:  what they expected the next few years to take within the next few months.

622
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,100
Speaker 7:  And the downside of that has been that as the pandemic

623
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,680
Speaker 7:  has has kind of progressed and we've, we're now years removed, they aren't

624
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,480
Speaker 7:  growing anymore. They already added all the customers. They can't find

625
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,440
Speaker 7:  more people to sign up for Netflix. People are leaving Netflix because there

626
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,200
Speaker 7:  are other streaming services. Other Stu, the Hollywood studios and the big

627
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,880
Speaker 7:  companies have gotten into streaming and they're spending a lot of money

628
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,160
Speaker 7:  to do it. And earlier this year, Netflix lost customers for the first time

629
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,640
Speaker 7:  in 10 years. So they came out with their earnings report this week and we

630
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,400
Speaker 7:  finally got news that the password sharing crackdown that they have talked

631
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,090
Speaker 7:  about to try and turn around and reverse this trend will roll out globally

632
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,080
Speaker 7:  in 2023. They've been using it in a few Latin American countries. Whether

633
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,760
Speaker 7:  or not people like it depends on who you ask. If you ask Netflix, everyone

634
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,640
Speaker 7:  loves it and it's great if you ask people in those countries, they say

635
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,960
Speaker 7:  it's confusing and they don't like it. So

636
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,880
Speaker 5:  It's weird cause Netflix has to frame, this is like a

637
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,320
Speaker 5:  feature addition. They can't frame it as, Hey,

638
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,480
Speaker 5:  we've noticed you've been stealing for a number of years. Right? They can't

639
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,370
Speaker 5:  come at it that way. They've gotta be like, Hey, you're sharing your account,

640
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,680
Speaker 5:  we love it. Would you like to pay some more money to keep doing it? And I

641
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,520
Speaker 5:  I I just don't think that makes sense to anybody. Like, I think most people

642
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,040
Speaker 5:  like intuitively understand that they're being shaken

643
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,660
Speaker 5:  down

644
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,680
Speaker 6:  And it's like not a little amount. It's not like, Hey, do you wanna spend

645
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,747
Speaker 6:  99 cents a month to share this password? No, you'll have to spend 7

646
00:35:28,813 --> 00:35:32,400
Speaker 6:  99, which used to be what Netflix costs. And also you're gonna have to watch

647
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,310
Speaker 6:  ads and they may or may not suck.

648
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,270
Speaker 5:  That's brutal.

649
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,240
Speaker 7:  That's so, And if you wanna watch Netflix on a tbu that's not at your

650
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,800
Speaker 7:  house, it could get complicated now, especially if you're there for more

651
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,960
Speaker 7:  than a month or, and stuff like that. Like suddenly the rules have have changed.

652
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,680
Speaker 7:  It's not just, Oh hey, you know what? I'm here. I'm gonna sign in with my

653
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,040
Speaker 7:  Netflix account and watch stuff. It's not going to be like that anymore.

654
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,000
Speaker 5:  If they talked about how they're gonna figure that out for people who are

655
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,800
Speaker 5:  traveling, they

656
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,720
Speaker 7:  Have de they detailed that a bit on their support

657
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,670
Speaker 7:  page. They,

658
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,120
Speaker 6:  It's partially like if you're signed into the app and stuff, I think is part

659
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,690
Speaker 6:  of it. Like if you sign into the app on your home network, right?

660
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,960
Speaker 7:  It really only applies if you are signing in on a TV I think is what they

661
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,920
Speaker 7:  said. Okay. So like, you know, if if you're watching on your, your

662
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,040
Speaker 7:  phone or something, you're traveling you, you've gotta, you gotta whole different,

663
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,640
Speaker 7:  different kind of thing. But essentially what you are, are dealing with is

664
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,520
Speaker 7:  you're gonna, you're going, you may run into this. If you are trying to sign

665
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,580
Speaker 7:  in on a tv, that's somewhere not where you live.

666
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,180
Speaker 5:  All right? So you gotta tell all your exes to watch Netflix on our phones

667
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,790
Speaker 5:  and use airplay. Yeah.

668
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,430
Speaker 6:  I to tell my mom she's just not gonna have Netflix ever again.

669
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,020
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

670
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,560
Speaker 5:  But for your mind, you just like pay the money. She

671
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,080
Speaker 6:  Can pay the money. I'm not

672
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,800
Speaker 5:  Paid. The password sharing thing is complicated with like the number of people,

673
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,430
Speaker 5:  like roommates and old friends and ex-girlfriends. Like, Yeah,

674
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,040
Speaker 5:  here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna like not talk to you anymore. This

675
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,520
Speaker 5:  is over where you're on the account by the way. And you

676
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,440
Speaker 5:  start Venmo $7 a month where your Netflix is gonna have ads.

677
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,320
Speaker 5:  Those are your choices.

678
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,280
Speaker 6:  Wait, don't you ever just do like the hard cutoff where one

679
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,480
Speaker 6:  day, like one day I, I signed on and I was like, why am I getting all these

680
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,270
Speaker 6:  recommended recommendations for shows about babies?

681
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,160
Speaker 6:  I do not have a baby. Yeah. And I remember my old roommate had a baby

682
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
Speaker 6:  and was just using my account and I was like, I don't talk to this person

683
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,000
Speaker 6:  anymore and just annihilated

684
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,520
Speaker 7:  It and they're gonna make that easier.

685
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,200
Speaker 6:  So just like took change the password, demanded sign

686
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,900
Speaker 6:  out, no more baby content.

687
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,810
Speaker 5:  Wow.

688
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:30,140
Speaker 7:  So if, if what you wanna do is to be petty with your ex roommate

689
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,560
Speaker 6:  Yes. Or your, your ex your ex-boyfriend,

690
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,880
Speaker 6:  ex-girlfriend, like I think everybody should be just a little more petty.

691
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,280
Speaker 6:  That

692
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,360
Speaker 7:  Is a feature. That's

693
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,700
Speaker 5:  A feature.

694
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,280
Speaker 7:  Yes. But yeah, I think essentially if you are, what it comes down to is

695
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,720
Speaker 7:  verify the idea of verified devices. It's sort of like your home Xbox. If

696
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,160
Speaker 7:  you have like an Xbox or a PlayStation, which one is your home one? So if

697
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,400
Speaker 7:  you're watching on a device that you've already verified for, they, they,

698
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,360
Speaker 7:  they don't, they don't exactly have all the details. But like if for a month

699
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,160
Speaker 7:  or so, if you are away from home, you won't get prompted for a code

700
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,760
Speaker 7:  or to like a, a text message or something to verify who you

701
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,080
Speaker 7:  are. But if you stay away from home for a while, suddenly it's going to ask

702
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,640
Speaker 7:  you to verify the device again. Or maybe it'll ask the people who are, who

703
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,320
Speaker 7:  are back at your, your home location to verify their devices. It's gonna

704
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Speaker 7:  get real complicated for you is what I'm saying.

705
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,800
Speaker 5:  I'm very excited for the cat and mouse game of people trying to break Netflix

706
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,190
Speaker 5:  password sharing rules. It's, it's going to happen. It's gonna be incredible.

707
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,400
Speaker 6:  I was gonna say, it sounds kinda like screeners and with screeners you have

708
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,640
Speaker 6:  to verify a lot of times and then your friend will be like, Can I have the

709
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,560
Speaker 6:  screeners? And you're like, no, I don't wanna be like getting a verification

710
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,960
Speaker 6:  code at 3:00 AM and having to just text it to you. So I'm not doing that.

711
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,260
Speaker 6:  So a lot of people are just gonna gonna

712
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,640
Speaker 5:  You mean screeners for review movies and

713
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,960
Speaker 6:  Stuff like that? Yeah. When you're reviewing movies, when you, when you're

714
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,620
Speaker 6:  reviewing TV shows, they'll send you, like, you'll have to like log in

715
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,840
Speaker 6:  and you'll have to get a two-factor authentication and it's a whole thing

716
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,360
Speaker 6:  and it's fine, but you can't do it with your, your friends ask for the password

717
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,440
Speaker 6:  and you're like, No, it's two complicated, it's two-factor. So if they're

718
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,200
Speaker 6:  doing like a two factor kind of deal here, that prob that like that

719
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,800
Speaker 6:  complication will probably push more people to be like, man, get your own

720
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,187
Speaker 6:  account. I'm not texting you codes at 2:00 AM

721
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:05,320
Speaker 7:  Some friendships are gonna fall apart over this. Yeah,

722
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

723
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,500
Speaker 6:  We're gonna see friendships fall apart. It's gonna be great.

724
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,400
Speaker 5:  I'm excited. I I can't wait to write 500 rights about Netflix password car

725
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,000
Speaker 5:  town. But there's all this back to what Richard is saying, right? Netflix

726
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,880
Speaker 5:  is sort of like out of human beings to sell Netflix too, so it needs to get

727
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,800
Speaker 5:  more of them by kicking more people off password

728
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,760
Speaker 5:  sharing. So as like created more Netflix customers can sell than sell

729
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,480
Speaker 5:  to and then needs to basically raise prices and cut costs

730
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,360
Speaker 5:  like they're at mature company saturated market moments and like here

731
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,020
Speaker 5:  we are

732
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,440
Speaker 7:  And it, it is really interesting to see them in, in this mature company era

733
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,970
Speaker 7:  of theirs because they have suddenly turned into the cable company. Yep.

734
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,920
Speaker 7:  On their earnings call. The only thing they want to talk about is how they

735
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,240
Speaker 7:  are profitable and none of their competitors are they. They just wanna remind

736
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,060
Speaker 7:  everyone that they make money and hbo, Max Peacock,

737
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,010
Speaker 7:  you name it, Paramount, they're all just

738
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,960
Speaker 7:  plowing millions or billions of dollars into, into

739
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,470
Speaker 7:  a hole and setting it on fire and it's going away.

740
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,920
Speaker 5:  Okay, well two things. One, to be fair, if I was competing against

741
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,870
Speaker 5:  Peacock and the at and t implosion of H bmx,

742
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,960
Speaker 5:  I would point out that I was profitable all the time too. I'd be like, you

743
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,420
Speaker 5:  know what's true, they're just lighting in money on fire.

744
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,180
Speaker 5:  Two, I am now compelled to disclose Comcast

745
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,960
Speaker 5:  Universal's NBC unit, which is the proprietor of Peacock is a

746
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,880
Speaker 5:  minority investor in V Media. I assure you they did not

747
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,920
Speaker 5:  like what I just said about Peacock. We ever said about them ever.

748
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,740
Speaker 6:  Didn't we also make a Netflix show?

749
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,880
Speaker 5:  Two, we've made a Netflix show. It's great. You should go watch it. It's

750
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,840
Speaker 5:  called The Future of It will single handedly save the company in this time

751
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,000
Speaker 5:  of turmoil and strife. Our company also makes TV

752
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,960
Speaker 5:  shows all over the place. There's a a Chad

753
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,920
Speaker 5:  mom, our, the creative director of Oxia Studios are very excited about

754
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,280
Speaker 5:  partnering with the people who make F F1 Drive to survive to make a show

755
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,600
Speaker 5:  about the PGA Tour. These are been tweeting about golf for, for months

756
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,560
Speaker 5:  now. I know what goes on over there. I just see the golf tweets. There's

757
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,800
Speaker 5:  a conflict of interest. Everybody. Golf tweets from a my my buddy the end,

758
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,120
Speaker 5:  that's the disclosure this week. The

759
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,240
Speaker 7:  Other things that Netflix talked about, they announced the profile transfer

760
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,520
Speaker 7:  Transfer so that you know when you get kicked off someone's account, you

761
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,480
Speaker 7:  can take your your account and and walk and create a new account that you

762
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,040
Speaker 7:  will hopefully pay Netflix for. They, they hope, but you can't merge accounts.

763
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,760
Speaker 7:  Like, like don't they know that people get married sometimes and you have

764
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,610
Speaker 7:  multiple Netflix accounts?

765
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,080
Speaker 5:  Oh no, it's all over man. You gotta decide who are you now? It's like changing

766
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,230
Speaker 5:  your last name but it's your Netflix. I'll go, I

767
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,840
Speaker 7:  I gave up, I gave up my Netflix,

768
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,310
Speaker 5:  Other interesting things, Netflix Hall. So they're all in on binge watching.

769
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,360
Speaker 5:  I think there's been a lot of this conversation, especially cuz House the

770
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,160
Speaker 5:  Dragon is out issue. Max really all in on sort of these week by week drops

771
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,080
Speaker 5:  other Hulu does week by weeks for its big shows. Like all, most of the

772
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,110
Speaker 5:  streamers are at week by week. Netflix still just drops 'em all at once,

773
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:50,680
Speaker 5:  does not get the water cooler conversation, does not get the sort of

774
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,480
Speaker 5:  weekly ringer podcasts about what's gonna happen next. It just all

775
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,040
Speaker 5:  happens at once and they're committed to it. They say this is what creates

776
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,570
Speaker 5:  the value for Netflix subscribers. I don't know about this. Here's the quote.

777
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,480
Speaker 5:  We think our binge release model helps D drive substantial engagement, especially

778
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,960
Speaker 5:  for newer titles. I feel like it's the opposite. I feel like they lose out

779
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,350
Speaker 5:  on that sort of week by week anticipation.

780
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think this is one of those situations where they're gonna have regret

781
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,040
Speaker 6:  in a couple years because these other companies have all figured out the

782
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,200
Speaker 6:  water cooler situation. Like these are mature entertainment companies that

783
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,880
Speaker 6:  have been doing this in many cases for decades and decades. And while like

784
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,840
Speaker 6:  viewership habits have changed some stuff, haven't, people still only have

785
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,520
Speaker 6:  a limited amount of time to watch shows every day. And that like

786
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,720
Speaker 6:  getting ahead and everything is really frustrating for people. It's like,

787
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,920
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna binge watch, I don't wanna watch a show, a group watch a show

788
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,640
Speaker 6:  with my friends on Netflix cuz then I'm gonna have to be like, okay, I can't

789
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,040
Speaker 6:  watch it. It's

790
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,800
Speaker 7:  A conversation that they're having internally where they have some debate

791
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,643
Speaker 7:  and they just released or they're going to release this new Ryan

792
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:52,720
Speaker 7:  Johnson movie in theaters. And there's a Wall Street Journal article about

793
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,880
Speaker 7:  kind of the, the debate the executives had over whether or not they should

794
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,760
Speaker 7:  do theatrical releases and how that would affect the kind of movies that

795
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,320
Speaker 7:  they can get and put on their service. And also the

796
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,250
Speaker 7:  release, the release strategy. My guess on this,

797
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,610
Speaker 7:  my, my personal guess based on basically nothing is that Reed

798
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,490
Speaker 7:  Hastings was forced to give up his position on the ad thing. He, he

799
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,690
Speaker 7:  had to, he he kicking and screaming. They were losing customers. The investors

800
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,130
Speaker 7:  were scared they had to do something. They they added ads. Yeah. They're

801
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:24,050
Speaker 7:  gonna take binge releases from him and from Ted from their cold

802
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,930
Speaker 7:  dead hands. So until they have new CEOs, they're gonna still do binge

803
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,410
Speaker 7:  releases because that's what they want. And and that's, and that's when you'll

804
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,210
Speaker 7:  see it change. I

805
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,900
Speaker 5:  Agree with you with the ad thing. This is like right, Netflix is out of people.

806
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,690
Speaker 5:  So you got two choices to make more money. You gotta create more people,

807
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,330
Speaker 5:  which you can do by kicking people off of their password sharing. And then

808
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,970
Speaker 5:  you gotta make more money from the people you got, which is showing some

809
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,410
Speaker 5:  of those people ads. Those are, that's it. That's what you got. The binge

810
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,610
Speaker 5:  thing to me is just Right. They're already starting to break. Right. Stranger

811
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,850
Speaker 5:  Things was in two drops. The new gear, they of

812
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:57,650
Speaker 5:  things a couple of drops, Right. Like they're getting there

813
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,610
Speaker 5:  where they realize they got like here know, here's another disclosure. The

814
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,250
Speaker 5:  new show, the new series, The Watcher on Netflix based on New York Mag story.

815
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,530
Speaker 5:  New York Mags, part of Box Media. Yeah. Whole thing. It's good. You should

816
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,570
Speaker 5:  watch it. Any anything Bobby Convo. I'll watch it. It's great. He was in

817
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,370
Speaker 5:  Mr. Robot, You know how I feel about Mr. Robot? Great. That

818
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:18,000
Speaker 5:  show would be better if it was week by week. Right? It's a cliff hanger show.

819
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,610
Speaker 5:  It's a thriller. They should stop it every week and make people try to figure

820
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:24,250
Speaker 5:  out the mystery instead of you. Everybody watched it all once and everyone's

821
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,570
Speaker 5:  like mad about the ending, which I won't spoil, but it's a New York Mac story,

822
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,180
Speaker 5:  which you could've read. So I'm like, how much can you possibly spoil it?

823
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,080
Speaker 5:  But that's weird, right? To get everybody focused on the end and

824
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,960
Speaker 5:  like whether or not the thing com completed itself successfully versus over

825
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,400
Speaker 5:  a long period of time making everybody focus on the twists and turns of the

826
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,600
Speaker 5:  mystery inside of the store. Yeah. At some point they're just gonna have

827
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,200
Speaker 5:  to deal with it. Well

828
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,760
Speaker 6:  I think they also have to deal with the fact that at some point right now

829
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,600
Speaker 6:  they're profitable. Competition is increasing. I mean I don't

830
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,480
Speaker 6:  think most of these streaming channels are gonna survive, but the competition

831
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,680
Speaker 6:  is there. They're, they're having to fight other people for, for some of

832
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,600
Speaker 6:  these dollars and some of these subscriptions and you can't

833
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,880
Speaker 6:  just keep churning out content at some point that the kinda like infinite

834
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,480
Speaker 6:  content has to become finite. And so if they're the only

835
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,320
Speaker 6:  ones in that binge mode being like we are just shoveling

836
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,200
Speaker 6:  stuff in your faces while Disney's over here doing, we do two shows a

837
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,190
Speaker 6:  week, that's it and it's Thursday night and have fun.

838
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,920
Speaker 6:  Like they're just gonna run into a problem of money. That's why Disney's

839
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,300
Speaker 6:  doing so well is it's being very cautious about it. It's rollout. That's

840
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,640
Speaker 6:  one of the reasons that HBO Max and some of these other ones have struggled

841
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,600
Speaker 6:  is because they weren't cautious and they were shoveling money at

842
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,410
Speaker 6:  people and just being like, yeah, make as much content as possible. And like

843
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,360
Speaker 6:  Netflix is the worst offender there and

844
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,330
Speaker 6:  you're seeing that burnout in Hollywood. You're seeing those ramifications

845
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:48,090
Speaker 6:  in the entertainment industry and at some point I think that's gonna catch

846
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:49,440
Speaker 6:  up with Netflix itself.

847
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,250
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. The other thing Netflix is doing, right?

848
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,930
Speaker 5:  They gotta get rid of people. They gotta create more customers. You fire

849
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:00,170
Speaker 5:  the people from password sharing, make them pay you a ads. Those are your

850
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,890
Speaker 5:  choices. You also make new products. So they are now quote,

851
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,530
Speaker 5:  seriously exploring a cloud gaming service, which makes sense.

852
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,130
Speaker 5:  Netflix is very good at streaming video over the internet. Its simplest

853
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,970
Speaker 5:  form cloud gaming is just streaming some video to you over the internet

854
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:18,450
Speaker 5:  accepting some input back from you. Adjusting that video

855
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,890
Speaker 5:  right in a, you know, performant in low latency

856
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,850
Speaker 5:  way. They gotta do it though, right? I mean it's harder than it sounds

857
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,330
Speaker 5:  actually getting the games. Maybe

858
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,730
Speaker 6:  You think at the games. Jay Peters did this great story this week called

859
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:34,370
Speaker 6:  Can Netflix Reclaim the Netflix for games Crown from Xbox Game

860
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:38,290
Speaker 6:  Pass. And he, he spoke with a bunch of different people about like what

861
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,090
Speaker 6:  are the actual challenges there? And Richard Gillette like that was one of

862
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,890
Speaker 6:  the biggest challenges is they don't have all those relationships that Nvidia

863
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:48,730
Speaker 6:  and Microsoft have with game developers to make games. Like

864
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,610
Speaker 6:  they've got a lot of games on their platform, but they're primarily indie

865
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,770
Speaker 6:  games from indie developers. That's for mobile.

866
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,690
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yo, but off is like, you want Assassin's cre we'll stream

867
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,170
Speaker 5:  it anywhere.

868
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:02,010
Speaker 6:  Yeah, Give off will do that for anyone. We could probably have, we could

869
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,730
Speaker 6:  probably have Assassin's Creed on the Verge website at any point if we want.

870
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:08,050
Speaker 5:  Here's what I'm saying. Look, I, we've got big updates to the redesign coming

871
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:11,850
Speaker 5:  and soon biggest update of all, which is the entire Verge

872
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,650
Speaker 5:  will just be a level of assassin. We're gonna bring back stadium and you'll

873
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,410
Speaker 5:  have to do the eagle dive to find a new

874
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:20,170
Speaker 5:  story. That's a bird

875
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,890
Speaker 5:  noise for today. I can't make the

876
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,440
Speaker 6:  Bird. That's the noise they make in the game. I've never played these games.

877
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,730
Speaker 6:  I don't know what they do. You

878
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,570
Speaker 5:  Gotta play at least one assassin screen. What are you doing?

879
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,600
Speaker 6:  I played, I played the Vike one. Okay.

880
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,280
Speaker 5:  But I didn't finish. That's not the best one by far. I mean, it's like the

881
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,990
Speaker 5:  most like beautiful one.

882
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,860
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

883
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,840
Speaker 5:  But like, what's,

884
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,110
Speaker 6:  What's the good one?

885
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:40,870
Speaker 5:  They all blur together. The, the, the one in Italy, The Eio.

886
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,440
Speaker 6:  Okay. That's like an early one. I was, I was always told never to finish

887
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,720
Speaker 6:  one.

888
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,260
Speaker 5:  They made, I think, No, I made, they made three with him. I think

889
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,160
Speaker 6:  I'm really up to date on my assassin Creed board.

890
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,070
Speaker 7:  Sorry. Good. I had, I had assassin.

891
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There's people listening to us right now who are hardcore

892
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,760
Speaker 5:  assassin Creed fans still, I'm so sorry. They're right in the slash fix and

893
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,320
Speaker 5:  like, Please don't email us. Like I just, I'm sorry. But Eio was the I

894
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,440
Speaker 6:  Know they don't have the middle finger. That's like, there's my lo knowledge.

895
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,400
Speaker 6:  They don't have their middle finger.

896
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Cuz they've got knives,

897
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,950
Speaker 6:  Which is way cooler.

898
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:13,400
Speaker 5:  It's true. My wife used to be like, Are you playing the game where you stab

899
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,300
Speaker 5:  people in the face and I'd be like, I am playing the game. I am.

900
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,360
Speaker 5:  And that is a totally accurate description of this game, but Ustar will be

901
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,280
Speaker 5:  anywhere, right? Yeah. The problem is Ubisoft is one of the last large

902
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,120
Speaker 5:  independent game studios with, you know, a

903
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,840
Speaker 5:  triple a title like Assassin's Creed to drop

904
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,480
Speaker 5:  on everyone. All of the other studios are getting

905
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,250
Speaker 5:  bought by Microsoft. Whoops.

906
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,550
Speaker 6:  In just Microsoft,

907
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,640
Speaker 5:  It's pretty much just Microsoft. You get

908
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,880
Speaker 7:  Into this weird, you get into this weird space because you, you build a service

909
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,720
Speaker 7:  that only people who are hardcore gamers would want. And then you don't have

910
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,600
Speaker 7:  the games for those hardcore gamers. Like, you don't have a reason for those

911
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,560
Speaker 7:  people to turn off the PS five and the Xbox Series S or X or s or gaming

912
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,520
Speaker 7:  PC that they already

913
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,930
Speaker 5:  Have. Wait, do you think that cloud gaming is only for hardcore gamers?

914
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,600
Speaker 7:  No, but it's hard to sell to someone who isn't a hardcore gamer. Like if

915
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,240
Speaker 7:  someone who plays mobile games on their phone, maybe they should try cloud

916
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,750
Speaker 7:  gaming. But how would you convince them to do it?

917
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,640
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think it's a, the, like hardcore gamers want triple A games, generally

918
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,520
Speaker 6:  speaking, right? And you're, you're just regular person who

919
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,880
Speaker 6:  doesn't own any consoles but would probably wanna play a game, is gonna wanna

920
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,480
Speaker 6:  play those same triple A games. Those are the ones that are in the marketplace.

921
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,390
Speaker 6:  The call duties of the world, the Destiny twos. And so like, they're gonna,

922
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,400
Speaker 6:  you're gonna have to have support for those. If you wanna get those people

923
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,680
Speaker 6:  who are like, Yeah, I don't want one, but I wanna like mess around with my

924
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,480
Speaker 6:  friend who who plays this game a lot and like see what they're doing and,

925
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,800
Speaker 6:  and experience it. So you have to like, you still have to have those triple

926
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,600
Speaker 6:  A games because that's where the audience is. Whether they're

927
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,120
Speaker 6:  hardcore or cash. I think

928
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,520
Speaker 5:  Every time I talk about gaming on this show, people yell at me. So I'm just

929
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,800
Speaker 5:  gonna lean directly into it. This is my personal, they

930
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,000
Speaker 6:  Can all

931
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Speaker 5:  Yell at me. This is my personal cultural war trolling.

932
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,030
Speaker 7:  Either you have Madden or you don't. Yeah,

933
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,880
Speaker 5:  I play a lot of Madden and now Chris Grant, the publisher of the ver the

934
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,320
Speaker 5:  group publisher of the Virgin Polygon is trying to get me to play control.

935
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,320
Speaker 5:  That's where I'm at with gaming lately. I buy all the games I just bought

936
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,120
Speaker 5:  Cyberpunk. Haven't played a minute of it. No

937
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,520
Speaker 6:  Fifa.

938
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,080
Speaker 5:  That's, I buy 'em all. I don't play 'em. But here's my, here's my thing.

939
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,400
Speaker 7:  If you didn't play when it was broken, you didn't really play

940
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,910
Speaker 7:  it.

941
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,480
Speaker 5:  I watched all the videos of the weird map clipping and I was like, this looks

942
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,160
Speaker 5:  amazing. And then I just never played it. If you are a Netflix binge

943
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,080
Speaker 5:  watching subscriber, right? You sit down in front of Netflix, you want 16

944
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,360
Speaker 5:  hours of content to fill the empty hours of your

945
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,160
Speaker 5:  day. Sure. What you could sell to that

946
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,920
Speaker 5:  audience is like a great single player story driven

947
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,840
Speaker 5:  narrative game. Those don't exist. Right. Start playing this game. Experience

948
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,560
Speaker 5:  this long story. You'll come to the end of it. It'll be whatever the

949
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,520
Speaker 5:  entire modern games industry is like veering away from

950
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,320
Speaker 5:  that, especially with the AAA titles into, you know, GTA five is

951
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,840
Speaker 5:  like an extremely long running massively

952
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,760
Speaker 5:  multiplayer world that asks you for money in one way or the other every

953
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,480
Speaker 5:  five minutes,

954
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,400
Speaker 6:  Right? They're all MMOs because they just wanna like get as much

955
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,200
Speaker 6:  of your money as possible. They're trying to create their own subscription

956
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,170
Speaker 6:  services effectively. So yeah, I I think Netflix

957
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:17,080
Speaker 6:  is gonna have to figure that out. How do they, are they gonna make a strangers

958
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,790
Speaker 6:  thing game? Do you wanna play a strangers thing game

959
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,420
Speaker 6:  like a aaa?

960
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,000
Speaker 5:  Why do you keep calling it Strangers thing? I think that's a

961
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Speaker 5:  fanfic that is not

962
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,260
Speaker 6:  Officially licensed. It's the evening.

963
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,720
Speaker 5:  The strange thing is, I don't know if you've heard about this

964
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,040
Speaker 6:  Strangers

965
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,000
Speaker 5:  Thing, it's a 60 hour, extremely dark, gritty

966
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,080
Speaker 5:  reboot of perfect

967
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,840
Speaker 5:  strangers and

968
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,830
Speaker 6:  It's went in

969
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,530
Speaker 5:  Aist wandering rated

970
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,910
Speaker 6:  Of I was gonna go

971
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,470
Speaker 5:  It's thing

972
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,560
Speaker 6:  Well cause just like, Hey guys, what's up? I can't even try the accent.

973
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,010
Speaker 5:  Cousin. Larry's a drug dealer, it's strangers thing. Everybody,

974
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:58,880
Speaker 5:  There's like 90% of the office has no idea what I'm talking about. Perfect

975
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,680
Speaker 5:  Strangers was a show in the eighties that I am guessing based on

976
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,370
Speaker 5:  having watched a lot in the eighties and not anytime recently. I'm just

977
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,000
Speaker 5:  in nineties. Guess it didn't hold up just based on what

978
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,050
Speaker 5:  I remember a stranger,

979
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,800
Speaker 6:  Me cousin bulky who held a lamb and was like,

980
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,690
Speaker 6:  I'm from another country. In other countries we don't have things.

981
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,380
Speaker 6:  We just have our little ghost.

982
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,060
Speaker 5:  But can you be racist against a fake country?

983
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,720
Speaker 5:  The Verge cast everybody. I think I know the

984
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,600
Speaker 5:  answer. All right, so that's

985
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,150
Speaker 5:  Netflix. Rebooting Perfect Strangers is a dark,

986
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,120
Speaker 5:  gritty, 60 hour single player video paint

987
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,810
Speaker 6:  Gonna be incredible.

988
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,610
Speaker 6:  They're all gonna have like the little five o'clock shadow.

989
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,640
Speaker 5:  Oh it's great. It's

990
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,200
Speaker 6:  Some large gun. It's gonna be great. Oh,

991
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,760
Speaker 5:  It'll be rights race. It's gonna, it's gonna look fantastic. It's, yeah,

992
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,480
Speaker 5:  it's just cousin Larry walking. Yeah, it's gonna be great. And then Cousin

993
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,190
Speaker 5:  Larry's gonna do the eagle dive from top of the Sears Tower

994
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,840
Speaker 5:  Stab people on the streets of 1980s Chicago. I don't know why this game

995
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,280
Speaker 5:  hasn't been made. I would play the tell out of it.

996
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,000
Speaker 5:  Sorry Li All right, let's talk about Tesla. Is that a good segue

997
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,840
Speaker 5:  everybody? Speaking of diving off of skyscrapers and stabbing people

998
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,410
Speaker 5:  in the face. Tesla had earnings.

999
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,510
Speaker 5:  They're doing okay. Walk us through Alex.

1000
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean they're, they're doing all right. I think the big thing

1001
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,160
Speaker 6:  that kind of jumped out at me was Elon talking about Twitter again and saying

1002
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,000
Speaker 6:  he's excited to buy it and he's sure definitely gonna buy it in a couple

1003
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,920
Speaker 6:  of weeks, right?

1004
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,560
Speaker 5:  No, they've gotta close on 28th. They're eight days away.

1005
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,330
Speaker 6:  So they've got next week. Yep. Yeah. So this time next Friday

1006
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,120
Speaker 6:  he has to have purchased Twitter and he's currently saying he's very

1007
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,680
Speaker 6:  excited to buy it. Yeah. But he also like they're, they're shipping

1008
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,120
Speaker 6:  cars. They're shipping almost too many cars, right? They're

1009
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,680
Speaker 5:  Not shipping too many. They're shipping everyone they can make and they're

1010
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,240
Speaker 5:  just running too hot. So they're trying to create efficiency in how they

1011
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,490
Speaker 5:  make cars and in particular for whatever the next car

1012
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:57,320
Speaker 5:  is. Elon is saying for all the effort we put into making one

1013
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,070
Speaker 5:  model three, we should be able to produce two of whatever the new car is.

1014
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:00,620
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1015
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,480
Speaker 6:  But I, I would like kind of want them to first go back and figure

1016
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,040
Speaker 6:  out how to make the cars not fall apart when somebody sneezes in

1017
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,070
Speaker 6:  one.

1018
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:13,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I, that stuff has gotten a little better, but it's still the thing

1019
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,760
Speaker 5:  that plagues Tesla. Like I was looking into buying a used

1020
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,760
Speaker 5:  model three. Yeah. For this like commute to New York that I'm doing once

1021
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,560
Speaker 5:  a week and all of the forms like you should buy used model three, the best

1022
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,360
Speaker 5:  car I've ever had. Tesla's changed my life. Also make sure you buy

1023
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,440
Speaker 5:  an extended warranty and reserve at least two weeks of time a year for the

1024
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,400
Speaker 5:  inevitable repairs. And it was just like, it just stated

1025
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,920
Speaker 5:  as fa like it's just part of that community now in a way that is a little

1026
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,840
Speaker 5:  too normal. But it's, Yeah, the door might fall off. There's still, but

1027
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,600
Speaker 5:  they'll, they'll fix it eventually. It'll be fine. The door latches on the

1028
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,040
Speaker 5:  model three in particular. You can live with that. Yeah. So yeah, I mean

1029
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,800
Speaker 5:  I think Elon's still got some quality control too. I think he said they're

1030
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,070
Speaker 5:  putting out a cheaper car. He promised the cyber truck will hit next year.

1031
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,090
Speaker 6:  Okay. Okay.

1032
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:58,370
Speaker 5:  He did not reveal the design for the windshield wipers.

1033
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:02,220
Speaker 6:  They're still working on it to, it's gonna actually be 12 different wipers

1034
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,640
Speaker 6:  all

1035
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,150
Speaker 5:  Around the wipers in a triangle. I'm telling you,

1036
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,040
Speaker 6:  It's gonna be incredible. But you know, they also did like in the earnings

1037
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,520
Speaker 6:  they, they said that like they're making money. I think that was kind of

1038
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,000
Speaker 6:  one of the little concerns everybody had is that Elon had to sell a bunch

1039
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,960
Speaker 6:  of stock to buy Twitter and that hurt Tesla

1040
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,440
Speaker 6:  stock. And it's like, okay, but are they still making money? Like was this

1041
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,200
Speaker 6:  always just a stock rich company or can they still keep going and still

1042
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,020
Speaker 6:  produce these cars when he's off spending everybody's money on Twitter

1043
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,440
Speaker 6:  and

1044
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,520
Speaker 5:  They're doing it and frankly being distracted by Twitter.

1045
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Super distracted by Twitter. So they're doing it and

1046
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,800
Speaker 6:  I'm really curious to see if he's like, I don't know, I keep thinking, is

1047
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,320
Speaker 6:  Elon gonna stay the CEO of all these different companies? Because ever since

1048
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,990
Speaker 6:  I learned that he has 20 direct reports at Tesla,

1049
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:51,520
Speaker 6:  like my brain just screams at that knowledge every

1050
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,030
Speaker 6:  day.

1051
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:55,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But he's not like doing like best practice one-on-ones with them. He

1052
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,080
Speaker 5:  just shows up and it's like, did you do, did you make the car drive itself?

1053
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,910
Speaker 5:  Not yet. Okay. We'll say it's next week.

1054
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,570
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's true.

1055
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,440
Speaker 5:  So you know, analysts did not like Tesla's quarter and the thing that you

1056
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,440
Speaker 5:  are saying about their deliveries, they made too many, they can't deliver.

1057
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,320
Speaker 5:  They can make the cars, but they don't have the transportation capacity to

1058
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,320
Speaker 5:  deliver all of them. Turns out their layoffs actually let go some of those

1059
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,200
Speaker 5:  people. That's true. Oops. So we'll just see, I mean,

1060
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,760
Speaker 5:  I think Tesla's in a strong position, but this Twitter thing like looms over

1061
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,720
Speaker 5:  Tesla in a real way. And it will be, like I said, if it

1062
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,840
Speaker 5:  actually closed the deal, my headline is like, Welcome to hell Elon Musk

1063
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,800
Speaker 5:  because owning Twitter is gonna suck for him. Like he

1064
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,000
Speaker 5:  is too easily trolled into doing and saying dumb

1065
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,880
Speaker 5:  things. And when it's like state actors in

1066
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,400
Speaker 5:  weirdo politicians on both sides trolling you into

1067
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,320
Speaker 5:  moderation decisions that they favor, it's, it's just, it's welcome to

1068
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,680
Speaker 5:  hell. That's like literally he should run away screening. But now he's saying

1069
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,830
Speaker 5:  he is excited about it.

1070
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:55,480
Speaker 6:  I hope he just bans all governments and

1071
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,810
Speaker 6:  politicians from having Twitter.

1072
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,080
Speaker 5:  Oh, I don't think he's gonna do that. I think he's, he's

1073
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,760
Speaker 6:  Gonna do the opposite.

1074
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,573
Speaker 5:  He's gonna, he's he's gonna sell it to the government for $50

1075
00:57:04,227 --> 00:57:08,120
Speaker 5:  billion Twitter employees. Bloomberg reported Twitter locked its

1076
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,640
Speaker 5:  equity grant. So it's not handing out equity in anticipation. The deal will

1077
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,630
Speaker 5:  close. So we'll see next week. Yeah. Then speaking and then

1078
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:19,430
Speaker 5:  more Elon News. Just an absolutely bizarre back and

1079
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,230
Speaker 5:  forth about Starling and Ukraine. Obviously Elon started shipping

1080
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:27,090
Speaker 5:  startup units to the Ukrainian military and to Ukrainian citizens.

1081
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:29,590
Speaker 5:  The government was paying for summit, the United States government, other

1082
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,590
Speaker 5:  governments around the world were paying for some of it. Turns out Ukrainians

1083
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:36,110
Speaker 5:  are doing crowd funding to pay for some of their own service. Other people

1084
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,910
Speaker 5:  were setting up crowdfunding has to pay for some of their own service. Elon

1085
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:42,390
Speaker 5:  claims that he had been paying for it out of pocket. Starling is like not

1086
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:45,150
Speaker 5:  a profitable thing. And like actually the biggest challenge for Starling,

1087
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,710
Speaker 5:  he said this many times before all this happened, right? Based on for Starling

1088
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,310
Speaker 5:  is just not going outta business. Cuz usually everything goes outta business.

1089
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:54,230
Speaker 5:  Like satellite based internet companies got business. So then he

1090
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:58,030
Speaker 5:  said we can't keep funding this forever. The government should pay for it.

1091
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,510
Speaker 5:  That got leaked. That turned into a political football especially cuz Elon

1092
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:05,390
Speaker 5:  keeps tweeting about Russia and peace plans and he's

1093
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,430
Speaker 5:  just making a bunch of bad decisions there. And then there was a lot of pressure.

1094
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,900
Speaker 5:  Hey you're threatening the access to the Ukrainian military is relying on,

1095
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,470
Speaker 5:  you're obviously puppet of Putin, which of course took

1096
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:19,390
Speaker 5:  exception to. And now he says he will keep funding Starling for

1097
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,070
Speaker 5:  the Ukrainian government for free despite losing money. Which I would just

1098
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,750
Speaker 5:  note the United States government, other governments around the world were

1099
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,150
Speaker 5:  already paying for some of this. So it's just deeply unclear what is going

1100
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:32,830
Speaker 5:  on here. Yeah. Also just one of those, if you take free stuff from a

1101
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,030
Speaker 5:  billionaire boy do you end up beholden to the billionaire?

1102
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,870
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. I think like this is one of those situations where I have a rule

1103
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:43,550
Speaker 6:  of thumb where I try not to tweet about international politics. And I

1104
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,150
Speaker 6:  think Elon should also try not to tweet about

1105
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,010
Speaker 6:  international politics,

1106
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:52,870
Speaker 5:  But soon he will own Twitter. Yeah. This is what I'm saying. This is gonna

1107
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:55,630
Speaker 5:  be, he is too easily trolled into responding

1108
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,270
Speaker 6:  Like he got in like a Twitter war briefly with the president of Ukraine

1109
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,150
Speaker 6:  who is at war. It's just he should not tweet in

1110
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:07,010
Speaker 6:  this space. It's bad. Like I think he got a lot of good will with starlink

1111
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,870
Speaker 6:  did really well for him and now he

1112
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:14,400
Speaker 6:  needs to just like be quiet like Yeah.

1113
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,070
Speaker 5:  Or he could do nothing. Right? He could. He could. It's, I think it's

1114
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:21,200
Speaker 5:  legitimate for money losing business that's providing a critical, critical

1115
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,930
Speaker 5:  infrastructure service to an American ally a hundred percent.

1116
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:28,160
Speaker 5:  To ask the American government to fund that service. I think that is a totally

1117
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,960
Speaker 5:  reasonable request that it gets reported. Should you

1118
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,520
Speaker 5:  should, you could just not react to it. Be like, yes, in fact we did ask

1119
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,613
Speaker 5:  the United States government to pay for this service the same way the United

1120
00:59:38,613 --> 00:59:42,400
Speaker 5:  States government is like paying for missiles and ammunition to go to

1121
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,200
Speaker 5:  Ukraine. Like great. Like that's Boeing does not get controlled into

1122
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,960
Speaker 5:  responding to, its to criticisms of its defense contracts.

1123
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,920
Speaker 7:  But that's the Elon story is that no one else, no, no other CEO ever operates

1124
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,480
Speaker 7:  this way. And there are reasons and we just keep finding out the reasons

1125
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,000
Speaker 7:  why they don't.

1126
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,510
Speaker 5:  Yeah, well what he owns Twitter, it's all gonna get

1127
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:05,360
Speaker 5:  stupider. Especially cuz right? He's up against

1128
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,360
Speaker 5:  Kanye West buying parlor, which is gross and

1129
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,160
Speaker 5:  weird. Kanye tweeted a bunch of antisemitic

1130
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,280
Speaker 5:  things. He got kicked off the platforms and then he basically got conned

1131
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,200
Speaker 5:  into buying parlor, which is bleeding money Mechanically has a great story

1132
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,880
Speaker 5:  about how Parlor was basically dying and they conned

1133
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,520
Speaker 5:  Kanye to buy it. There's no other way to describe it. And then obviously

1134
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,840
Speaker 5:  Trump and Truth Social, which is falling apart in a series of

1135
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,760
Speaker 5:  extremely chaotic recriminations, including its own former executives going

1136
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,240
Speaker 5:  to the Washington Post and providing all of the evidence that he'd given

1137
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,960
Speaker 5:  to the s e c Badly Truth Social is

1138
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,760
Speaker 5:  run. So at the end of it, just like in this flaming

1139
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,440
Speaker 5:  pile of alternative social service wreckage, there's an Elon

1140
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,320
Speaker 5:  owning Twitter with nothing to stop him. It's gonna be weird. I

1141
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,600
Speaker 5:  mean, we can all stop using Twitter. Why do you think we redesign the whole

1142
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,890
Speaker 5:  website? Why do you think I'm needed a Twitter key up? Because I'm ready

1143
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,400
Speaker 5:  anytime you want. Ready,

1144
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,560
Speaker 7:  Ready to pull the escape

1145
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,880
Speaker 5:  Edge. You gotta start tweeting on a website more. All right, we gotta take

1146
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,680
Speaker 5:  a break. I'm, it's gonna, We'll see, I mean

1147
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,320
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm as addicted to it as anybody, but at least we have an escape hatch.

1148
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,760
Speaker 5:  You know what I'm saying? All right, we gotta take a break. We're gonna come

1149
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,600
Speaker 5:  back. Richard's gonna tell us about his crypto obsession. I can't

1150
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,640
Speaker 5:  believe how excited I about this. We'll, right

1151
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:27,880
Speaker 5:  back.

1152
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:48,010
Speaker 5:  We're back Richard Lawler, this week you fell

1153
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:51,770
Speaker 5:  deep down an NFT rabbit hole because as everyone

1154
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:55,570
Speaker 5:  remembers, CNN decided it would start selling NFTs and then they

1155
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:59,130
Speaker 5:  decided they would stop, Tell, tell us what happened here. My

1156
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,600
Speaker 5:  friend,

1157
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,570
Speaker 7:  I will have, you know, that their NFC marketplace lasted 16 times as long

1158
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:09,410
Speaker 7:  as CNN Plus first of all, that just first of all, Yeah, okay.

1159
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:13,290
Speaker 7:  Like let's, let's, let's take the win, let's take the W there, the

1160
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:17,250
Speaker 7:  CNN Vault, which tried to sell moments because who doesn't wanna

1161
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:21,010
Speaker 7:  buy digital tokens attached to news articles about famous

1162
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:24,810
Speaker 7:  events and trade them or sell them with your friends? That

1163
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:28,600
Speaker 7:  that's a thing people do. It's it's something that everyone wants. I I,

1164
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,290
Speaker 7:  I was sitting at home hoping someone would launch a service like that and

1165
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:36,010
Speaker 7:  then CNN did. No, I actually spoke to someone who had spent more than

1166
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:39,890
Speaker 7:  $10,000 on Wow. That

1167
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:43,210
Speaker 7:  that was what they thought. You know, kind of looking at what they own on,

1168
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,650
Speaker 7:  on these moments. Like there, there are, when you take a look at these things

1169
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:50,290
Speaker 7:  that these, these brands launch, these web three, these NFT things, you think,

1170
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:54,210
Speaker 7:  okay, nobody's buying that. There is someone who is buying it. There

1171
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:57,850
Speaker 7:  are, there are are not. There is a certain number of people who have the

1172
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:01,530
Speaker 7:  money and have decided, yes, I am going to go ahead and invest cuz CNN

1173
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:04,610
Speaker 7:  sounds sounds like a, a reasonable company. They're not gonna rug pull and

1174
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:08,230
Speaker 7:  just disappear overnight like some of these shady and FD operators.

1175
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:11,810
Speaker 7:  And that's exactly what they did. 16 months later they were like, Yeah, no,

1176
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,690
Speaker 7:  we're not doing this anymore. And the community is,

1177
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,570
Speaker 5:  Wait, there's a community

1178
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:19,370
Speaker 7:  Unsurprisingly not really pleased about it. They, they, CNN said that they're

1179
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:21,090
Speaker 7:  going to give some refunds. I was like, how

1180
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,210
Speaker 11:  Many

1181
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:22,010
Speaker 5:  People besides

1182
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:25,010
Speaker 7:  This one person, Every NFT project has a community. Every NFT project has

1183
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:28,090
Speaker 7:  a discord and there are at least five people who come on there every morning

1184
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:30,530
Speaker 7:  and say good morning to each other. And they talk about their days. It's,

1185
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:31,290
Speaker 7:  it's beau it's actually

1186
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,570
Speaker 5:  Beautiful. Stop trying to curtail me. You should join

1187
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,130
Speaker 7:  A few, you

1188
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:36,890
Speaker 5:  Should, you should get into NFTs. No, I'm not coming in. This is like the

1189
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:40,570
Speaker 5:  end of the fun. First of all, you're trying to get me in at the end of the

1190
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:43,970
Speaker 5:  party when all the streamers are falling down, people are sweeping like,

1191
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,800
Speaker 5:  no, come over and help clean up.

1192
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,090
Speaker 7:  I I've got some really nice NFTs that I can sell you at a good

1193
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,290
Speaker 7:  price. I'm just saying

1194
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:54,170
Speaker 5:  I have stayed out too late with you in my life before, sir. And I

1195
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,810
Speaker 5:  am not doing that again. Especially when there's crypto

1196
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,450
Speaker 5:  involved.

1197
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:59,720
Speaker 7:  Everyone's survived.

1198
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,250
Speaker 5:  It's true. Everyone's survived. Where where's your, you've, you are

1199
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:07,040
Speaker 5:  notably, we are joking. Richard is notably skeptical of

1200
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,370
Speaker 5:  NFTs and crypto Now that you've talked to these folks, where, where's your

1201
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:11,340
Speaker 5:  feeling at?

1202
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:15,030
Speaker 7:  It's, it's really unfortunate and I, I feel like these people have been taken

1203
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:18,480
Speaker 7:  advantage of. Like you, you had these brands just kind of grab at these,

1204
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,480
Speaker 7:  these projects and they, they launched and they had these promises. They

1205
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,320
Speaker 7:  said, We're gonna give you utility, we're gonna give you special experiences.

1206
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,080
Speaker 7:  We're going to give you access, we're going to allow you to do this and to

1207
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,960
Speaker 7:  do that. And then none of those things happened. They sold, they sold you

1208
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,920
Speaker 7:  magic beans and then they said, Okay, stay tuned with our

1209
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,440
Speaker 7:  social channel and our discord. And then they waited a year until

1210
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,760
Speaker 7:  everybody forgot about it. And then they said, Yeah, we're we got your money

1211
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,360
Speaker 7:  and we're just gonna

1212
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,320
Speaker 5:  Leave now. Yeah. And they rugged everybody super hard.

1213
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,090
Speaker 7:  Right. We, we don't have any bigger plans here. We it, it never got big,

1214
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:50,640
Speaker 7:  it never scaled to a level where we're going to continue doing it. I think

1215
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,960
Speaker 7:  there was a report earlier this year that CNN had made $300,000 from it,

1216
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,440
Speaker 7:  which you know, is a small number amount of money for a person. But for Warner

1217
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,350
Speaker 7:  Brothers, discovery isn't enough to stay in the business.

1218
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:03,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It was not even enough to fund one extra day of CNN

1219
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,800
Speaker 5:  Plus they were like, we can't even, not even an extra hour.

1220
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,600
Speaker 5:  That's not to

1221
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,120
Speaker 7:  Do it for us. And CNN is far from the only brand like this. Like I,

1222
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,560
Speaker 7:  I'm, as I said, I really am in a lot of nft discords.

1223
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,440
Speaker 7:  Every company that you can name has tried to do web three

1224
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,960
Speaker 7:  things. I'm, I'm in one for the Gap. And many of them have

1225
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,760
Speaker 7:  either completely abandoned their communities or they just

1226
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,300
Speaker 7:  keep dropping things to sell to these same people who already bought in.

1227
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,640
Speaker 7:  And the people are, are hoping that the company will do something that will

1228
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,320
Speaker 7:  bring in new people so they can bring it so they can sell the tokens that

1229
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,680
Speaker 7:  they bought early at a profit, but they just keep pumping money outta the

1230
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,840
Speaker 7:  same people over and over again. And that, that's really where the cycle

1231
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,430
Speaker 7:  is.

1232
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:45,280
Speaker 5:  That's fertile. Well, I'm gonna continue avoiding it. I'll just

1233
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,240
Speaker 5:  keep getting my updates from you from this. Wait,

1234
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,000
Speaker 6:  But you, you talk to this person who spent $10,000. Did they have a reason

1235
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,910
Speaker 6:  besides like, just speculation?

1236
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:57,040
Speaker 7:  They just, they're into nds and you know, they, they get into the community.

1237
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,670
Speaker 7:  They, when you, when you are in one of these things, and I compare it

1238
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:04,280
Speaker 7:  very much to a cult because that's really what it is. You, you have this

1239
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,960
Speaker 7:  like magical belief that things are going to go up and everyone shares it

1240
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,830
Speaker 7:  and you can get in and you can kind of log in and every day

1241
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:15,680
Speaker 7:  you'll have maybe five or maybe 500 people telling you how great

1242
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,560
Speaker 7:  things are and how you're in the right place and you're doing the right thing

1243
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,520
Speaker 7:  and you're going to win eventually. And, and that, that sense

1244
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,600
Speaker 7:  of com, that community is really what people are there for. But to be in

1245
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,490
Speaker 7:  the community, you have to buy things. And some,

1246
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:31,110
Speaker 7:  some people buy a little bit more.

1247
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:34,710
Speaker 5:  All right, well I can't wait to start our NFT collection. Oh, next

1248
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:35,890
Speaker 7:  The hill turn is coming. I'm doing it.

1249
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:39,130
Speaker 5:  It's coming right out. When we redesign the entire site is an assassin's

1250
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:42,300
Speaker 5:  CRE level. It's the future of all media

1251
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:46,190
Speaker 5:  futures. Speaking of nonsensical future ideas,

1252
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:49,050
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm gonna try to get through this as quickly as I can. I told you it

1253
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:50,130
Speaker 5:  was gonna be vir chasity, vergecast.

1254
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:52,390
Speaker 6:  Are you gonna, are you gonna talk about Wisconsin?

1255
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:56,290
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna talk about Wisconsin. So the Packers are bad this year. Look very

1256
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,410
Speaker 5:  bad. I'm sorry. No, I'm not gonna talk. They're very

1257
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:03,130
Speaker 5:  bad. I predict that Aaron Rods will destroy at least

1258
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,090
Speaker 5:  two more surface tablets by the end of the year. That's my personal prediction

1259
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:09,850
Speaker 5:  about the state of Wisconsin. No, the state of Wisconsin, there's a company

1260
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:13,330
Speaker 5:  called Fox on, which you may have heard about on the show before. They were

1261
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,280
Speaker 5:  supposed to build an LCD factory in Wisconsin. They have not built that.

1262
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,040
Speaker 5:  It's mostly empty buildings. They did build a dome, which they continue to

1263
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,960
Speaker 5:  claim is a data center. It is not a data center. The data center is located

1264
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,440
Speaker 5:  outside the dome in a shipping container at the porta potty next to it. This

1265
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,350
Speaker 5:  is true information.

1266
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,320
Speaker 6:  I mean is that technically

1267
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,960
Speaker 5:  And even that isn't data center, it's just a shipping container with some

1268
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,750
Speaker 5:  Dell servers in it.

1269
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,800
Speaker 6:  It's like the Apple version of the It's like the Foxcon version of the all

1270
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,360
Speaker 6:  screen. Yeah. Right. Like it's close enough that it counts.

1271
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,600
Speaker 5:  There's some screen. Yeah, there's some screen,

1272
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,520
Speaker 6:  There's some data

1273
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,080
Speaker 5:  Center, there's some, there's some data center around the dome.

1274
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,740
Speaker 6:  They plugged it in in the do into the data into the dome.

1275
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:51,393
Speaker 5:  All right. So Foxconn, when it goes into Wisconsin like 20

1276
01:08:51,475 --> 01:08:55,400
Speaker 5:  16, 17, they, there's do whatever they're doing. And one of

1277
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,040
Speaker 5:  the enduring mysteries of what Fox Homem was doing in Wisconsin was they

1278
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,360
Speaker 5:  kept talking about something called the AI AK plus 5G

1279
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:06,010
Speaker 5:  ecosystem. This is a real phrase they said

1280
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:09,670
Speaker 5:  in my belief to just bamboozle

1281
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:13,320
Speaker 5:  dumb local politicians in Wisconsin into thinking they were doing something

1282
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,720
Speaker 5:  cool. Like they just fired buzzwords at these

1283
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:20,600
Speaker 5:  hapless dummies and they got a huge tax break. Right.

1284
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,360
Speaker 5:  Scott Walker was like, I love AI eight K and 5g. I sound great

1285
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,390
Speaker 5:  now. Yeah. What Welcome to the Wisconsin Valley.

1286
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:31,000
Speaker 6:  They just went to ces. Yeah. They saw what was like on the little

1287
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,800
Speaker 6:  banners around and they're like, that's it. At

1288
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,350
Speaker 5:  One point they set up what was essentially a CES in Wisconsin.

1289
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:41,080
Speaker 5:  Like a fake trade show. Yes. With

1290
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:45,040
Speaker 5:  like big TVs and drones, like all the CES stuff that

1291
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,000
Speaker 5:  we go to and ignore to like find the real products. They set up

1292
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,760
Speaker 5:  one of those. So aia, so Josh Jesu who did most of our Fox

1293
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,260
Speaker 5:  reporting won awards for that FoxTown recording. We've spent years

1294
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:59,690
Speaker 5:  alternately trying to figure out what Foxcon means by AI AK plus

1295
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:03,560
Speaker 5:  5g and laughing at it and in, in one very notable

1296
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,960
Speaker 5:  instance, receiving just anonymous threats from Foxcon

1297
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,760
Speaker 5:  executives to tell, telling us to leave them alone. And

1298
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,610
Speaker 5:  then in the same breath trying to explain what AK plus 5G is.

1299
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:18,120
Speaker 5:  It was very confusing. None of this matters anymore because

1300
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,080
Speaker 5:  Foxconn just announced a new plan to make electric vehicles. They were like,

1301
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,280
Speaker 5:  we, our ambition is to make EVs for

1302
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,040
Speaker 5:  Tesla. I dunno if you just heard us. Tesla's making every

1303
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,000
Speaker 5:  car at Tesla's very good at making EVs. It

1304
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,560
Speaker 5:  does not need a contract manufacturer. It makes the cars. I don't know why.

1305
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,440
Speaker 5:  Anyway, Foxconn announces two reference designs of its new EVs and

1306
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:44,060
Speaker 5:  then the, the president of Foxconn says, We have a new strategic vision.

1307
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,680
Speaker 5:  Are you ready for it? Yes. It's three plus three equals

1308
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,800
Speaker 5:  infinity.

1309
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,680
Speaker 6:  Well you said is it three plus three equals infinity or an infinity

1310
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,120
Speaker 6:  symbol? It's like

1311
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,670
Speaker 5:  The symbol. It's it's a symbol. So then the, the

1312
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,120
Speaker 5:  FOXCON and Wisconsin website has been scrubbed of all

1313
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,040
Speaker 5:  references of A I A K plus 5g. Oh no. And it has all

1314
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,800
Speaker 5:  been replaced with three plus three equals infinity. So I, I don't know man.

1315
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,640
Speaker 5:  Three plus three by the way, it's three industries. Electric vehicle digital

1316
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,520
Speaker 5:  health and fee robotics. Who knows what that is. It's not the same as

1317
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:16,920
Speaker 5:  they're

1318
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,920
Speaker 6:  Gonna make the robot. They're not gonna make the the cars, they're gonna

1319
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,190
Speaker 6:  make the robot.

1320
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:25,120
Speaker 5:  It's, I can't even begin to explain what fee is. Fee is

1321
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,120
Speaker 5:  a subsidiary of Fox on, they set up to take over what's

1322
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,440
Speaker 6:  Whatever they're gonna make the Tesla robot.

1323
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,520
Speaker 5:  It's three things. The three is electric vehicle, digital health and field

1324
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,280
Speaker 5:  products. And then the plus three is technology. It's

1325
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,160
Speaker 5:  5G solutions. Semiconductors by the way, the logo for semiconductors is just

1326
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,650
Speaker 5:  the USB logo. So I don't know what's going on there. And then industrial

1327
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:47,430
Speaker 5:  ai, which Fox on has branded iai.

1328
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:51,240
Speaker 5:  This is a real thing with a link to something called the IAI Institute and

1329
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,720
Speaker 5:  that link just doesn't work. So I dunno what that

1330
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,640
Speaker 5:  is. I tried, I clicked all the links

1331
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,080
Speaker 5:  on this one website.

1332
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,840
Speaker 6:  Can we, can we all list ourselves as just employees of the IAI

1333
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,620
Speaker 6:  Institute? Like Richard you're now chairperson. I always was the I

1334
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:08,400
Speaker 5:  You should sell some I I NFTs Richard, why

1335
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,840
Speaker 7:  Didn't they go with you plus me equals us. It was right

1336
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,710
Speaker 7:  there.

1337
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,480
Speaker 7:  It's a deep bet. It's gonna miss some people but for those who appreciate

1338
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,270
Speaker 7:  it,

1339
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:22,240
Speaker 5:  Here's what I got is first of all three plus three six. I dunno, I

1340
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:26,000
Speaker 5:  just want to put that out there as a thing that I know Infinity is the,

1341
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,960
Speaker 5:  as the father of a four year old, I'm really confident that three plus three

1342
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,840
Speaker 5:  equals six. This is, this is something we're working on actively

1343
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,040
Speaker 5:  in our

1344
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,390
Speaker 6:  House. You're just not looking at it in the foxcon way.

1345
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Second of all, you can't just list industries and

1346
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,820
Speaker 5:  technologies and be like, here's what you do. You take these three industries

1347
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:46,790
Speaker 5:  and you just throw some 5G solutions at it and arrive at

1348
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:50,480
Speaker 5:  infinity. Don't know what that means. Third of

1349
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,320
Speaker 5:  all, none of this is gonna create jobs in Wisconsin. Right? Like

1350
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,160
Speaker 5:  at the end of the day they have an empty building, they've got a dome. The

1351
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,890
Speaker 5:  website has been updated to brag about the dome. Yes.

1352
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:05,720
Speaker 5:  In the, But the brags are like the dome is

1353
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,560
Speaker 5:  nearly 100 feet tall, which I would note is not 100

1354
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,480
Speaker 5:  feet tall. So you've built like an eight story dome. It's

1355
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,180
Speaker 5:  just not impressive. And they're like, you can see it

1356
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:21,020
Speaker 5:  from the highway, which I dunno if you've ever driven through

1357
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,500
Speaker 5:  Wisconsin. Wisconsin's mostly cornfield are they? So like

1358
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,300
Speaker 5:  being able to see an eight story building from the highways is

1359
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,960
Speaker 5:  really not that big of deal.

1360
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,620
Speaker 6:  But you know, people go out of their ways to like find the

1361
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:36,570
Speaker 6:  largest ball of twine.

1362
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,060
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1363
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:40,940
Speaker 6:  And people are there. Is there just a vendor sitting out there next to

1364
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,540
Speaker 6:  the data center with like a bunch of little ball, little

1365
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:48,420
Speaker 6:  globes selling them to people who pass by, who drove off the highway to

1366
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,750
Speaker 6:  be like, what's that globe over there?

1367
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,780
Speaker 5:  No. You don't understand if you drive by there and your parents' house is

1368
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:56,570
Speaker 5:  like right by there. Yeah, they built just

1369
01:13:56,570 --> 01:14:00,300
Speaker 5:  huge roadways. Okay. To support what they

1370
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,290
Speaker 5:  thought would be 13,000 jobs building

1371
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:07,810
Speaker 5:  like hundred inch TVs. So they built

1372
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,520
Speaker 5:  roadways and water and power to support

1373
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,420
Speaker 5:  manufacturing on this massive scale and to move these like giant

1374
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:19,360
Speaker 5:  TVs. Yeah. And none of it exists. Like

1375
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,270
Speaker 5:  if I was still a teenager in Wisconsin, like I would be,

1376
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:27,240
Speaker 5:  I would only be drag racing by the dome all day long because

1377
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,580
Speaker 5:  it's just like six lane roads that are dead empty.

1378
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,560
Speaker 6:  Are there, are there people in any of the buildings?

1379
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,200
Speaker 5:  Sometimes that's why

1380
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,540
Speaker 5:  sometimes the dome is apparently like an event

1381
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,310
Speaker 5:  space. There are no pictures by the way of the inside of the dome.

1382
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:46,650
Speaker 5:  And Fox continues to claim the dome is a data center. They say there's gonna

1383
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,370
Speaker 5:  be a network operations center there and I believe but what network, there's

1384
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:52,780
Speaker 5:  one day center shipping container,

1385
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,530
Speaker 5:  there's like a power strip that shuts down the shipping container and turns

1386
01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:00,450
Speaker 5:  it very off. It's not, it's just truly bizarre. But

1387
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:04,290
Speaker 5:  anyway, so AI look A i a K plus 5G is out three

1388
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:07,930
Speaker 5:  plus three equals infinity is in you. Let me know if you know what that means

1389
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,590
Speaker 5:  cuz I, I'm working on it.

1390
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:10,970
Speaker 6:  I'm really excited about

1391
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:14,610
Speaker 5:  It. It's, it's real bad but the, you gotta just, everybody gonna read the

1392
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:18,290
Speaker 5:  website cuz the part about the dome where they just consistently, you

1393
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,310
Speaker 6:  Can see it from the

1394
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:23,090
Speaker 5:  The dome and it's like, it's incredible. Have you ever

1395
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:27,000
Speaker 5:  looked at an eight story circle from the highway? Because now you can

1396
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,650
Speaker 5:  foxcon some of the things to talk about. David wrote a big

1397
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:34,180
Speaker 5:  piece about Google and rcs. They're adding

1398
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,170
Speaker 5:  replies and stars to messages and

1399
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:41,290
Speaker 5:  they're doing it in a way that's super annoying. So if you're in a group

1400
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:44,820
Speaker 5:  chat with an iPhone user and they fall back to SMS and you do a tap back

1401
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:48,290
Speaker 5:  in Android messages, they're gonna start getting the annoying sms. It's like

1402
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,570
Speaker 5:  so-and-so did a so and so lecture thing.

1403
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,490
Speaker 6:  Yeah it's so petty.

1404
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:53,080
Speaker 5:  It's good. It's so petty.

1405
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,170
Speaker 6:  It's so petty. It's so good.

1406
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:58,010
Speaker 5:  But that's a good piece. Interviews some Google PMs who worked on the thing

1407
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:01,090
Speaker 5:  Chris Welch wrote about the new feature in Lightroom content of where Phil

1408
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:04,010
Speaker 5:  is coming to Lightroom. So now you kind of don't eat Photoshop of your photo

1409
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,970
Speaker 5:  edits, which is kind of amazing. Yeah,

1410
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:08,900
Speaker 6:  We had, we had Adobe max this week. They announced

1411
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,690
Speaker 5:  It was Adobe max this week. Yep. They,

1412
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:14,410
Speaker 6:  They did this big update in Chris is like super, super excited because we're

1413
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:18,010
Speaker 6:  finally like, Lightroom is super annoying. I was really shocked. Like I was

1414
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:21,410
Speaker 6:  honestly shocked when I see saw this pop up on the website. Cuz when I first

1415
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,250
Speaker 6:  got in this business I was told if you use Lightroom, you're punk and

1416
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:29,130
Speaker 6:  you don't know anything. Only pros use Photoshop. And

1417
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:32,540
Speaker 6:  I'm not a pro but I wanted to pretend I was one. And so like

1418
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:36,370
Speaker 6:  to see actually that Lightroom is good now and see somebody

1419
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:39,290
Speaker 6:  who's a really good photographer like Chris Wells say it. I was like, oh

1420
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,450
Speaker 6:  dang, that's that's big

1421
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:44,090
Speaker 5:  News. It's good. It's expensive, which is its problem but it's good. It's

1422
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:45,530
Speaker 5:  been getting better. It's really good on

1423
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:47,500
Speaker 6:  The iPad. Is it subscription based?

1424
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,730
Speaker 5:  It is. Okay. And what you get for the subscription, it's a bunch of storage

1425
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:54,370
Speaker 5:  right? Yeah. So it works out but it's really good on the

1426
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:58,130
Speaker 5:  iPad. All the jokes about U S C C aside Light room on an iPad

1427
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:01,650
Speaker 5:  Pro with the second generation pencil, like the whole thing

1428
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,410
Speaker 5:  choice. And you know, especially with the newer chips

1429
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:09,280
Speaker 5:  super fast before the MacBook went to m m one

1430
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,600
Speaker 5:  chips, I preferred Lightroom on my iPad cuz it was so much faster than my

1431
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,560
Speaker 5:  Intel MacBook Pros. Wow. It's it's a thing. Yeah.

1432
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,800
Speaker 6:  I mean it just looks really, really cool. The, the other big news that came

1433
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,680
Speaker 6:  out of Adobe Max was that like, you know every year they do something

1434
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,650
Speaker 6:  wacky and they're like this is the future. And this year they were like,

1435
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:29,560
Speaker 6:  if you give us a picture of someone we can make that

1436
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,950
Speaker 6:  we can turn them into a puppet and make them dance.

1437
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,220
Speaker 5:  I mean that's pretty cool.

1438
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:37,120
Speaker 6:  And yeah, there's like Jess Weathered who's a

1439
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,360
Speaker 6:  new reporter, she's on our international team. She's lovely. She watched

1440
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,160
Speaker 6:  all of the Adobe Max stuff, paid attention to it and she's put a

1441
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,040
Speaker 6:  Jiff into this thing and it's just these two cutouts of people

1442
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,220
Speaker 6:  doing the Oppa gun gum style.

1443
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,600
Speaker 5:  The Gunga style. Yeah. If

1444
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,680
Speaker 7:  You haven't seen this, you should,

1445
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,120
Speaker 5:  It's

1446
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,760
Speaker 6:  Worth it. It's a really, it's like they're deeply unsettling images.

1447
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,150
Speaker 6:  Adobe has not figured this out yet. I've

1448
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:03,430
Speaker 6:  rarely been more terrified.

1449
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:07,360
Speaker 5:  This is my TikTok strategy is I'm just gonna do an AI version of myself

1450
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,480
Speaker 5:  doing TikTok dances. Watch

1451
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:12,910
Speaker 7:  This and then watch the trailer for Megan.

1452
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:16,640
Speaker 5:  You'll get that movie looks bonkers. Allison

1453
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,550
Speaker 5:  Johnson has a big piece on EIM and what that's like.

1454
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:23,440
Speaker 5:  Alison obviously is a phone reviewer so she switches from iPhone to enter

1455
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,240
Speaker 5:  it all the time with physical sim card. Just do it. Yeah,

1456
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:31,160
Speaker 5:  with an Ssim card. You gotta get corporations involved in your

1457
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,620
Speaker 5:  situation and that sucks. Turns out that sucks.

1458
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,560
Speaker 6:  She was actually at the office when, when she did the switch and

1459
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,490
Speaker 6:  we just, everybody just heard an oh no

1460
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:44,360
Speaker 6:  because cause she's like, I gotta call Verizon because

1461
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,560
Speaker 6:  she's like on the phone with the Verizon doing the switch. But they did the

1462
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,410
Speaker 6:  switch and because they did the switch, the phone she was on no longer worked.

1463
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:54,910
Speaker 6:  So it just connected her but then the new phone didn't work.

1464
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:58,820
Speaker 5:  This is the promise in the peril of ssim, right? The promise is

1465
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:02,210
Speaker 5:  you can provision your phone onto anyone's network at any time

1466
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:05,890
Speaker 5:  without a piece of plastic. Yeah. Things like push the buttons and see

1467
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:09,760
Speaker 5:  it. That promise is, I would say halfway realized. Right? The real and say

1468
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,320
Speaker 5:  that promise is you open the cellular settings on your phone, you see all

1469
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:16,840
Speaker 5:  the available networks in your area. There's speeds, their prices there

1470
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,800
Speaker 5:  plans you pick and choose and switch

1471
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,000
Speaker 6:  It. Oh that's a way better promise than what I heard about ems. I want that

1472
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,460
Speaker 6:  one.

1473
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,240
Speaker 5:  But that there're nowhere close to that. That's just me saying here's some

1474
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,840
Speaker 5:  cool shit that could happen. What's the process? I

1475
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,520
Speaker 6:  Think that would be really cool. I want that.

1476
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,150
Speaker 5:  You can kind of do that on iPad. What's the promise? You heard?

1477
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:34,720
Speaker 6:  I just heard that. Oh are you traveling internationally now? You don't need

1478
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:38,560
Speaker 6:  to find one of those stupid little sim card removers to switch your sim

1479
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,690
Speaker 6:  out. You can just be like bam. Internet.

1480
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:44,600
Speaker 5:  So your promise to vSim was will reduce paperclip usage. Yes.

1481
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,400
Speaker 5:  Worldwide. All right. So it's a spectrum. Spectrum on the high end of

1482
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,280
Speaker 5:  the spectrum is free and open competition. A more informed

1483
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:56,160
Speaker 5:  consumer making better and more rational choices. A little couple ticks

1484
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:00,120
Speaker 5:  below that. You won't need a paper clip. And then there's where

1485
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:04,000
Speaker 5:  we are, which is, oh shit, the carriers have locked you in and

1486
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,640
Speaker 5:  actually switching your account from one phone to another got

1487
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,560
Speaker 5:  substantially harder because it's not just moving piece of plastic, it's

1488
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,520
Speaker 5:  moving someone else's software authorization for piece

1489
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,400
Speaker 5:  of hardware. Which is exactly what it sounds like. Bad. So we'll

1490
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,200
Speaker 5:  see. Maybe it'll get easier. We'll see. But that piece is really good. You

1491
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,760
Speaker 5:  should read it. It it is really the promise in the apparel. Like the promise

1492
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,520
Speaker 5:  is apparent. We all know what the end state should be. The reality is very

1493
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,840
Speaker 5:  different. And then there's a new generation of Thunderbolt that Mitchell

1494
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,370
Speaker 5:  Clark wrote about it. This is really interesting. So Intel gave up the basis

1495
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:38,120
Speaker 5:  of Thunderbolt or the basics of Thunderbolt for USB four. So now

1496
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,480
Speaker 5:  Thunderbolt and USB are kinda the same thing. I dunno, I kind of don't understand

1497
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,440
Speaker 5:  why Thunderbolt exists anymore.

1498
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think it, it really struggles to exist now because USB

1499
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:50,040
Speaker 6:  four is like gonna be really fast when we start seeing it in actual

1500
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:50,830
Speaker 6:  products.

1501
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,830
Speaker 5:  I can't wait until it comes to Apple TV remote.

1502
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:56,170
Speaker 6:  It's gonna be amazing in 2035.

1503
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:59,160
Speaker 7:  It brings us right back around to where we started. The problem is standards

1504
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,700
Speaker 7:  groups. We need a standards groups focused on getting rid of standards groups.

1505
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,710
Speaker 7:  Are you guys with me? Are you in, Let's create it.

1506
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:07,080
Speaker 6:  NE's starting it. He's

1507
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,800
Speaker 5:  Interviewed the heads of many standards groups over the past many

1508
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,400
Speaker 5:  years. They're, they're that they're the most politician politicians I interview

1509
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,860
Speaker 5:  cuz they, their job is to make sure no one's mad,

1510
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,000
Speaker 6:  But everybody ends up mad. But

1511
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,590
Speaker 5:  Everyone's always mad.

1512
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:22,550
Speaker 6:  They suck at their jobs.

1513
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:25,820
Speaker 5:  They can't, but they're, it's like an impossible job. Yeah.

1514
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:29,760
Speaker 7:  But so it seems like the difference is the, if you have the USB

1515
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,720
Speaker 7:  four V2 device or cable, then certain features are optional.

1516
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,960
Speaker 7:  But if you are, if you have Thunderbolt, then those optional features are

1517
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,030
Speaker 7:  definitely in there. Is what it sounds like on some of them.

1518
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:43,360
Speaker 6:  I mean that's kind of what we've seen so far with Thunderbolt in usb. Right?

1519
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,820
Speaker 6:  Like I can, I can run my, my monitors off of a

1520
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:50,560
Speaker 6:  USB port on my computer, but they're gonna run a lot nicer off the

1521
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,000
Speaker 6:  Thunderbolt one because it's got a higher bandwidth guaranteed. And

1522
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,040
Speaker 6:  USB's always struggled with being like, yeah, you can pick and choose everything.

1523
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,640
Speaker 6:  Oh no your, your laptop exploded because you used the wrong charger. Sucks

1524
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,980
Speaker 6:  for you, it's gonna take

1525
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:05,520
Speaker 7:  10 minutes to transfer that video file because you are using the wrong

1526
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,440
Speaker 7:  cap. But

1527
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,320
Speaker 6:  It's very, it's very Doby vision HDR 10 plus where it's like, yeah,

1528
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,600
Speaker 6:  one of these is good but the other is actually way better. Yeah,

1529
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:13,880
Speaker 5:  I think

1530
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,680
Speaker 6:  That's great. It's more expensive in every way.

1531
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:19,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And one involves paying until licensing fee. Yeah, fair enough.

1532
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:23,000
Speaker 5:  Some other things to call out. Our Homeland series continues. That's our

1533
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,840
Speaker 5:  big series about TSA and security in America. It's the 20

1534
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,760
Speaker 5:  year anniversary of the tsa, which is frightening to think about that Sarah,

1535
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,360
Speaker 5:  John and Sergio almost have a piece about the Portland van abductions in

1536
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,070
Speaker 5:  2020, which is just a thrilling caper. So I encourage you to go read that.

1537
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:40,400
Speaker 5:  Nicole Wetsman has been paying a lot of attention to the fertility features

1538
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,180
Speaker 5:  that are being added to all kinds of tech products, including the Apple Watch.

1539
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,360
Speaker 5:  All these things are getting added. They're filling a void that exists in

1540
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,880
Speaker 5:  the context of the dobs decision that overturn Roe v. Wade. So

1541
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,800
Speaker 5:  like this incredible collision of tech

1542
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,380
Speaker 5:  companies seeing a market, the culture war

1543
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:01,360
Speaker 5:  and a politics of abortion changing dramatically for the

1544
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,400
Speaker 5:  worse. Yeah. And people kind of not knowing what to do or what to believe

1545
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,320
Speaker 5:  or how to use these, these products or what data's collected. She's doing

1546
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,760
Speaker 5:  an amazing job reporting all that.

1547
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,640
Speaker 6:  There's also this weirdness she and I have talked about a bunch about is

1548
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,440
Speaker 6:  that like the research isn't there, All the research now isn't being

1549
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,720
Speaker 6:  done by, by scientists with no financial, no real financial

1550
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:22,480
Speaker 6:  incentive. It's being done by these companies who do have a financial

1551
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,320
Speaker 6:  incentive and they're like, these fertility products are

1552
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,280
Speaker 6:  pushing really weird things. Like we have, we

1553
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,160
Speaker 6:  have way methods of birth control that we know work that

1554
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,860
Speaker 6:  don't require you to own an Apple watch and be like, Oh,

1555
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:41,510
Speaker 6:  not this week honey. So like that's

1556
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:44,630
Speaker 6:  Yeah, she's doing just a tremendous job on this stuff.

1557
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:48,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean this is I think one of the biggest

1558
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,920
Speaker 5:  verge stories you can think of. Like what it all the,

1559
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,760
Speaker 5:  the colliding themes inside of it, right? The law, the culture

1560
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,070
Speaker 5:  of the United States, the politics, bodily autonomy, the

1561
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:02,960
Speaker 5:  tech industry, data privacy. It's all colliding in

1562
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,800
Speaker 5:  a really extraordinarily messy and somewhat depressing way. And

1563
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,040
Speaker 5:  Nicole's just doing a great job covering it. Yeah. Last few things right,

1564
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,880
Speaker 5:  is we have been talking, Andy Hawkins covered the launch of the

1565
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,810
Speaker 5:  new GMC Sierra Ev Denali horrible name.

1566
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:21,320
Speaker 5:  It literally just happened. So I basically have no idea about anything except

1567
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:25,020
Speaker 5:  it gets 400 miles of range can power a whole house for to 21 days

1568
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:27,110
Speaker 5:  and it looks ridiculous.

1569
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:29,600
Speaker 6:  I was thinking it looks kinda cool. It

1570
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,000
Speaker 5:  Doesn't look, Is

1571
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,360
Speaker 6:  It the headlights? The headlights look like

1572
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,280
Speaker 5:  It's the headlights, the headlights look Grow lab. I mean it looks like

1573
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,760
Speaker 5:  the Silverado, they just GED it up a little bit. Yeah. And the inside has

1574
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,350
Speaker 5:  a vertical touch screen with touched controls for climate.

1575
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:46,040
Speaker 6:  I have never wanted to control the seat in my car while I'm driving

1576
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:49,390
Speaker 6:  more than on a giant vertical touch screen.

1577
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:52,920
Speaker 5:  It's ridiculous. It's gonna cost $107,000. So

1578
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,410
Speaker 5:  cool.

1579
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:55,520
Speaker 6:  Oh, but they, they changed the name of the front in it.

1580
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,280
Speaker 5:  What's the name of the

1581
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,860
Speaker 6:  Front? They're calling it the E trunk.

1582
01:24:58,860 --> 01:24:59,830
Speaker 5:  The E trunk.

1583
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:03,600
Speaker 6:  Just watching your face as you, you realize that was, I'm

1584
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,250
Speaker 6:  sorry.

1585
