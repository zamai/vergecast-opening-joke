Description: In the final chapter of our Vergecast “creators series,” Alex Cranz talks with Ben Heck, who has been modding game systems and controllers since the early 2000s, which led to his project creating single-handed video game controllers.
Alex also talks with Bryce Johnson, who is one of the inventors of the Xbox Adaptive Controller, the game controller designed for gamers with limited mobility.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,620
Speaker 3:  Hey Rodney. It's Nila. We've got another special episode of our virtual

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,590
Speaker 3:  cast creators series coming up. What's up, Alex,

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,680
Speaker 4:  We're going to talk about controllers today.

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,130
Speaker 3:  Control. So this is the third episode. Yes, you did

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,030
Speaker 3:  keyboards.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,080
Speaker 4:  We did keyboards.

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,220
Speaker 3:  You did track Pauls.

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,090
Speaker 4:  We did poopy

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,990
Speaker 3:  Floopy.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,970
Speaker 4:  It talks about floopy

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,320
Speaker 3:  Today's controllers. What do you mean about controllers?

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,860
Speaker 4:  Well, I think the thing was for this final episode, we really wanted to talk

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,130
Speaker 4:  about a gadget where all the tinkerers, all the people, making these things

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,090
Speaker 4:  actually for once had a really big win in these bigger companies really

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,720
Speaker 4:  finally started to pay attention. And that led us to

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,290
Speaker 4:  controllers because right now, most of them aren't really

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,070
Speaker 4:  accessible unless you have like two hands with really solid dexterity.

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,060
Speaker 4:  And a lot of people have spent a lot of time modding those to make them more

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,310
Speaker 4:  accessible for other members of the gaming community.

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,860
Speaker 3:  What specifically do you mean by accessible?

32
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,000
Speaker 4:  I think that means like controllers that you can use with one hand or a

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,720
Speaker 4:  foot, or like putting all the joysticks on one side, there's even mods for

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,140
Speaker 4:  people with different levels of motor control. And so that kind of led me

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,770
Speaker 4:  to this one guy who's been doing this for 20 years and that's been

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,220
Speaker 4:  heck

37
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,240
Speaker 3:  So it's funny. I know Ben Ben is from Wisconsin, listen Madison

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,680
Speaker 3:  in my ancient logging history. We would always cover every Ben

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,010
Speaker 3:  Heckmont. I've actually been out to Madison to see Ben before. That's amazing.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
Speaker 4:  And he, he was, he was a lot of fun to talk to about video game

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
Speaker 4:  controllers, but you know, this is also a success story. And

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,570
Speaker 4:  so the other half of this is we really wanted to talk to one of these big

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,530
Speaker 4:  companies. And we ended up talking with Bryce Johnson, who is one of the

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,980
Speaker 4:  creators of Microsoft's adaptive controller for the Xbox.

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,520
Speaker 3:  That adaptive controller is a big win. People love it. One of the things

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,670
Speaker 3:  that I think about all the time is people love the adaptive controller. Even

47
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,730
Speaker 3:  if they do have two hands and staring, cause it's just a, it's a cool controller.

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,520
Speaker 3:  That's great. And making things accessible. It makes them better for everybody.

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,510
Speaker 3:  So I am very excited for this episode. Take it away,

50
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:33,870
Speaker 3:  Alex,

51
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,910
Speaker 4:  A lot of the times when I hear game control mods, I think of people

52
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,640
Speaker 4:  cheating at call of duty by adding special triggers,

53
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,600
Speaker 5:  The controller and the rapid fire mods. It completely

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,950
Speaker 5:  transformed this gun.

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,180
Speaker 4:  Or I think of like that video of teen Timothy shallow may painting an Xbox

56
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,780
Speaker 4:  controller.

57
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,770
Speaker 6:  Oh, here's a red tiger. Started it today. Yesterday, finished it today.

58
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,330
Speaker 6:  It looks nice. It looks sexy.

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,510
Speaker 4:  And yeah, some of the controller modding is focused on cheating the system

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,590
Speaker 4:  or just being unique. But a lot of the people out there modern

61
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,040
Speaker 4:  controllers are doing it for a much cooler reason. Increasing the

62
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,900
Speaker 4:  accessibility of playing video games.

63
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,770
Speaker 7:  My name is Ikea and this is my one handed dual sense controller.

64
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,550
Speaker 8:  This video will review our PlayStation four red-handed controller for

65
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,570
Speaker 8:  accessible gaming device.

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,710
Speaker 9:  It's a hobby I've built and designed custom game controllers for people with

67
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,970
Speaker 9:  physical disabilities.

68
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,860
Speaker 4:  Video games have a very well-documented accessibility problem, but

69
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,670
Speaker 4:  that's starting to change and it's not because exact set

70
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,570
Speaker 4:  gaming companies have suddenly changed their minds. It's because of the community

71
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,690
Speaker 4:  being vocal and demanding changes. And when that fails

72
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,070
Speaker 4:  implementing their own,

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,060
Speaker 4:  That's what led me to Ben. Heck

74
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,170
Speaker 10:  Hello? I am Benjamin J heckendorn online. I go by Ben, heck

75
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,650
Speaker 10:  I've have a website. Ben, heck.com. I am a self-taught

76
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,670
Speaker 10:  electrical engineer and I've been doing video game related modding and

77
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,450
Speaker 10:  customized console's controllers, et cetera. Since the year 2000,

78
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,560
Speaker 4:  He was one of the first modern to really embrace building communities. Online,

79
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,310
Speaker 4:  back before social media was even a term in most of our vernacular.

80
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,330
Speaker 4:  I knew if I was going to talk to anyone about how this area has transformed

81
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,380
Speaker 4:  and what it takes to do it, it had to be Ben. So here's my conversation with

82
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,560
Speaker 4:  them.

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,320
Speaker 4:  What was your first controller that you modded?

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,550
Speaker 10:  Well, I started out modifying old game systems,

85
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,960
Speaker 10:  the Atari 2,600 from back in the seventies or like 1980. I

86
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,930
Speaker 10:  found one of those in like a junk drawer. And I was like, I think I could

87
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,680
Speaker 10:  make this portable. This was back in 2000. So I hacked it all up and

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,470
Speaker 10:  I made it into like somewhat compact unit,

89
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,760
Speaker 11:  A grand total of 57 wires, nine switches, three potentially auditors, three

90
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,240
Speaker 11:  resistors, two capacitors, and one voltage regulator have to be hand connected

91
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,620
Speaker 11:  to build a VCSP.

92
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,850
Speaker 10:  I had a geo cities website. I put it on there and then a

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,510
Speaker 10:  gaming. I think it was classic gaming.com put a link to it. And then

94
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,480
Speaker 10:  apparently I became sort of internet famous back then.

95
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,930
Speaker 4:  I mean, that was before YouTube social media even.

96
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,550
Speaker 10:  Yeah, that was 22 years ago.

97
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,670
Speaker 4:  So you've been doing it ever since. What I was really excited to talk to

98
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,300
Speaker 4:  you about is I think in my head, I usually think of

99
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,320
Speaker 4:  controller mods is like somebody painting a controller or maybe putting

100
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,310
Speaker 4:  little switches on the back so they can shoot faster in call of duty,

101
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,520
Speaker 4:  but you're actually doing stuff to make controllers more accessible for people.

102
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,540
Speaker 10:  Correct. So I became known as like, oh, this guy's modifying things. Or

103
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,530
Speaker 10:  like, oh, he made a portable X-Box 360 into a laptop or whatever. So

104
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,550
Speaker 10:  2006, this guy emails me and he's like, Hey, I

105
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,540
Speaker 10:  was in the second Iraq war. And when he was over there, you

106
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,410
Speaker 10:  know, he'd been wounded and he came back. He's like, I realize if I don't

107
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,980
Speaker 10:  have both my hands, I can't hold a controller because it requires both of

108
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,220
Speaker 10:  your hands. He's like, I want to play video games. Like this was a big part

109
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,560
Speaker 10:  of my life. So he's like, could you make me a controller? But he's like,

110
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,870
Speaker 10:  can you move everything? That'd be on one side of the controller and make

111
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,780
Speaker 10:  it so it's accessible just on one side. And I'm like, oh, okay. I'll, I'll

112
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,260
Speaker 10:  try that.

113
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,610
Speaker 12:  It says he can see, we have the left analog on the leg here. So

114
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,150
Speaker 12:  what you do is you move your arm left and right. To do that

115
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,690
Speaker 12:  motion. And then the right hand log stick is the same as it ever was

116
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,040
Speaker 10:  The original prototypes that I did. I think this was the Xbox 360 days.

117
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,860
Speaker 10:  Well, I think they were actually over-engineered because I was like laser

118
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,580
Speaker 10:  cutting panels and little. And he was like, oh, okay, this works.

119
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,490
Speaker 10:  And I can't remember if that was, that was the first time I did it. But

120
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,330
Speaker 10:  you know, there's two analog sticks. Right. And obviously that's a problem.

121
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,110
Speaker 10:  So one of the gags I came up with was you take the right hand analog

122
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,860
Speaker 10:  stick and you put it on the bottom of the controller and then you actuate

123
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,120
Speaker 10:  it against your leg.

124
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,470
Speaker 4:  Oh, that's cool.

125
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,100
Speaker 10:  This acts as a joystick for the movie, the controller against your leg acts

126
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,970
Speaker 10:  as the other analog axis of movement. And so that was something that I did

127
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,730
Speaker 10:  pretty early on because I was like, you know, how do you get both analogs?

128
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,540
Speaker 10:  Do it now. It is harder for people to learn because you're taking this

129
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,080
Speaker 10:  many tasks and putting them all into one hand, which does make it more difficult.

130
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,830
Speaker 10:  But the vast majority of people that I sell them to that

131
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,610
Speaker 10:  seems to work. I get a lot of feedback. It's like, Hey, now I can game again.

132
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,030
Speaker 10:  So that's kind of, that's where it started back in 2006,

133
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,720
Speaker 4:  You expanded it. You, you primarily, for a long time, there were mainly doing

134
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,800
Speaker 4:  X-Box 360 controllers, right? You weren't working on PlayStation or

135
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,090
Speaker 4:  Nintendo controllers.

136
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,230
Speaker 10:  Yes. So if you think about in 2006, if you take

137
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,160
Speaker 10:  apart your standard computer keyboard, not like a, a razor, but your standard

138
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,090
Speaker 10:  one, it's got those that's soak screen, conductive membrane. It's

139
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,000
Speaker 10:  basically two pieces of plastic. And then that's how the switches work.

140
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,390
Speaker 10:  That's what Sony uses. They've been using that for their controllers, for

141
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,290
Speaker 10:  the buttons since 1995. And it makes it really hard to modify like you

142
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,990
Speaker 10:  can't just go in there and like, oh, I'm going to solder to this point.

143
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,660
Speaker 10:  And that gives me that X button I'm going to solder to this point. That

144
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,440
Speaker 10:  gets me the square button. You can't do it very easily on a Sony controller.

145
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,010
Speaker 10:  Whereas in the Xbox you take it up. It's just a box standard green circuit

146
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,460
Speaker 10:  board. And it's filled with test points all over. It's like test point test

147
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,040
Speaker 10:  point, and you solder to those and boom, you get your button.

148
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,270
Speaker 4:  Oh, that's cool.

149
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,200
Speaker 10:  So that's why for the longest time, I only did X-Box was because it was

150
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,980
Speaker 10:  much, much easier to modify the controllers versus

151
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
Speaker 10:  PlayStation. Also, if you want to get into the weeds with it, always

152
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,440
Speaker 10:  Sony revises their controllers multiple times for generation, whereas

153
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,460
Speaker 10:  Microsoft might do it once. So not only is it places you control

154
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,300
Speaker 10:  are harder to modify, but it keeps changing as well. I think there was at

155
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,990
Speaker 10:  least three different versions for the PlayStation four, for instance. Whereas

156
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,150
Speaker 10:  X-Box had to over that same period,

157
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,630
Speaker 4:  It was like Microsoft conscious of like what you were doing.

158
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,920
Speaker 10:  Oh yeah. Actually Microsoft actually, every so often they'll send me a

159
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,790
Speaker 10:  whole box of like broken controllers just to scavenge parts from

160
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,980
Speaker 4:  That's. Cool. So how did that go from like one guy and

161
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,010
Speaker 4:  helping one guy to a little side hustle? Is it fair

162
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,900
Speaker 4:  to call it a side hustle? Is it a full hustle?

163
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,960
Speaker 10:  No, it is not the main thing that I do, but actually I just, I just, I

164
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,020
Speaker 10:  actually, I got to send them off today. Like I just did my taxes, like

165
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,740
Speaker 10:  2021. I built like 124 of them. It turns out.

166
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,520
Speaker 10:  So I, I built about two weeks for people, but one thing that helped us,

167
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,360
Speaker 10:  we had a, we had this forum on my website. We, it was the

168
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,140
Speaker 10:  Ben heck.com forum. And people would go on there like, oh, I want to

169
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,950
Speaker 10:  modify video game councils. I want to, you know, do this. And that was from

170
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,910
Speaker 10:  like 2004 to 2007 was probably the heyday of that.

171
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,810
Speaker 10:  So my website, Ben, heck.com already had a lot of good

172
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,380
Speaker 10:  SEO as far as like modifying things go because that's why, even though my

173
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,280
Speaker 10:  forums are dead, we there've been dead for a long time. I still keep them

174
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,650
Speaker 10:  up, but I keep the database and good. Nick

175
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,330
Speaker 4:  SEO is too good

176
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,870
Speaker 10:  For dry because there's still tons of legacy links from Google that still

177
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,510
Speaker 10:  go to that website. So I wanted to make sure it's still there. So it was

178
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,800
Speaker 10:  just, it was just web traffic back then. And I guess it still is. I don't

179
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,960
Speaker 10:  do any marketing people just come to my website and order this stuff.

180
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,650
Speaker 4:  YouTube Twitter, like when, when, when you started using these, cause you're

181
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,460
Speaker 4:  a fairly big presence on both that didn't kind of transform how

182
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,300
Speaker 4:  people were reaching out to you and, and kind of talking to you about accessibility

183
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,960
Speaker 4:  and controllers.

184
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,040
Speaker 10:  Not that I've noticed. I, well, a lot of people email me about it. That's

185
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,400
Speaker 10:  pretty common. So I, maybe they just go to my website because you know,

186
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Speaker 10:  they'll email me and be like, oh, you know, I've got this particular thing

187
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,820
Speaker 10:  or I have also done all their modified controllers in the past. Like I've

188
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,120
Speaker 10:  done one for someone who had muscular dystrophy, which meant they basically

189
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,080
Speaker 10:  had trouble having the strength to necessarily use the controller. Another

190
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,110
Speaker 10:  thing I've come across is the size of people's hands.

191
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,130
Speaker 4:  I couldn't use the original one. I had to my I very tiny hands

192
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,640
Speaker 10:  And you're not alone. Like there's, there's one right now when I'm trading

193
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,450
Speaker 10:  emails with them, their, their main problem is they are having trouble

194
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,060
Speaker 10:  reaching the whole thing because yes, people have different size hands.

195
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,690
Speaker 10:  There's a lot of different things that can affect, you know, your ability

196
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,500
Speaker 10:  to game myself. I have, I'm like 50% color blind.

197
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,250
Speaker 10:  So when they started adding those options into games about 10 years ago,

198
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,250
Speaker 10:  I think like dice actually was one of the first ones to do it with bad company

199
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,030
Speaker 10:  too. I'm like, oh yes. Finally I can see the, the, my ally

200
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,970
Speaker 10:  markers in the snow maps because of the lines. I couldn't see the blue.

201
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,300
Speaker 10:  Right. I'm like, okay, this is something I can appreciate. And there's other

202
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,600
Speaker 10:  things, a lot of other much smell, almost everything is worse than that,

203
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,780
Speaker 10:  that can affect people. So it's kind of interesting to do that. Kind of

204
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,440
Speaker 10:  like, okay, what can I do? Even if it's just these controllers, which are,

205
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,860
Speaker 10:  it's not like it's some sort of science miracle, but it's kind of fun to

206
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,120
Speaker 10:  do problem solving with that. And right now what I'm doing is

207
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,660
Speaker 10:  actually I was working out just this morning, I'm working on ways to

208
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,590
Speaker 10:  improve the process so I can keep the prices

209
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,580
Speaker 10:  static. As other prices might change. Like during the,

210
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,810
Speaker 10:  like in 2020, I had a hard time like finding the controllers. So I

211
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,770
Speaker 10:  was having to go on eBay actually to get a lot of them or go to the

212
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,610
Speaker 10:  used game store once things reopened. And yeah, that was kind of a crap

213
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,420
Speaker 10:  shoot back then. And even like the filament at that time, like the

214
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,270
Speaker 10:  3d printer filament. So when people send me controllers for

215
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:59,170
Speaker 10:  repair, which, you know, obviously that they break after time and the number

216
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,010
Speaker 10:  one thing that goes wrong in stick drift, don't tell them, don't tell big

217
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,460
Speaker 10:  game industries. I had the spool of filament. It's like this

218
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,660
Speaker 10:  marble fake marble filament. I got at a festival in 2019

219
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,930
Speaker 10:  and I'm like, oh, wait a minute. I'm never going to use this. I'm not going

220
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,720
Speaker 10:  to print chess pieces or anything. Right. But then Amazon was like, oh,

221
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,680
Speaker 10:  we don't have any white filament. And I'm like, I guess I have to use this

222
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,430
Speaker 10:  white marble. So now when I get, if someone sends in a controller and I

223
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,550
Speaker 10:  see something that should have been a white, 3d printed piece, but it's

224
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,550
Speaker 10:  actually like this marble, which kind of looks like, you know, the white

225
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,300
Speaker 10:  gum that has like the specks of flavor in it. It kind of looks like that.

226
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,690
Speaker 10:  So if I see something on there with that color of film and I'm like, oh,

227
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,680
Speaker 10:  I made that the summer of 2020 it's it's like

228
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,410
Speaker 10:  an archeologist I could like rip it. It kind of reminds me of,

229
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,650
Speaker 4:  It gets a little bit of an artist's signature people. You can just see that

230
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,190
Speaker 4:  and be like, I did that. I know. And other people will now know. I love it.

231
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,820
Speaker 10:  Well, in the case of that filament, it was the signature of shortages or

232
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,890
Speaker 10:  whatever the problem was. Back then,

233
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,940
Speaker 4:  You mentioned earlier that Microsoft was, was always very enthusiastic about

234
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,630
Speaker 4:  you modifying these controllers and making a more accessible Microsoft

235
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,380
Speaker 4:  now is kind of embraced accessibility itself. And it started,

236
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,500
Speaker 4:  you know, it has this big cool accessibility controller. Yup.

237
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,940
Speaker 13:  For the Xbox adaptive controller, a gamer can gain with one hand

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,690
Speaker 13:  and one foot or one hand and their shoulder or even one

239
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,150
Speaker 13:  foot and their chin. And I can change it for the damned again.

240
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,120
Speaker 4:  Was there ever like evidence where they were like, oh yeah, we're working

241
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,970
Speaker 4:  on this because we see so much of the appetite there because of people like

242
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,150
Speaker 4:  you.

243
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,410
Speaker 10:  Well, they've never told me that directly. I know they knew of

244
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,950
Speaker 10:  my work. I don't know if it inspired them. And I actually did buy one of

245
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,700
Speaker 10:  their controllers to take a look at. And at the time they announced

246
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,730
Speaker 10:  that like, oh, I guess we're not going to build these anymore. But

247
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,350
Speaker 10:  an issue that people have with that, like people will email me and there's

248
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,200
Speaker 10:  like, Hey, I tried it, but it's this big box. And it has all

249
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,560
Speaker 10:  these like one eighth inch, three millimeter headphone jacks. So you're

250
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,280
Speaker 10:  like, okay, I've got this foot pedal, plug it in. That's going to

251
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,210
Speaker 10:  be the jump button. I've got this puff controller where you

252
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,570
Speaker 10:  use air, I'm going to plug it into here. So basically in order to use this

253
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,030
Speaker 10:  thing, you have to plug all this stuff into it. It looks like a giant, like

254
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,690
Speaker 10:  super squid with all these wires coming out of it. So the feedback I've

255
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,080
Speaker 10:  gotten from people is that, yeah, I think the thing is like 99 bucks, which

256
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,530
Speaker 10:  is actually a lot less than I charge for my modifications,

257
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,770
Speaker 10:  but they're like, yeah, but you can't just use this thing out of the box.

258
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,930
Speaker 10:  It's got like two big buttons on the front at everything else has to be

259
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,800
Speaker 10:  plugged back in. So at least for people with a specific situation of,

260
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,460
Speaker 10:  I only have one hand people buy the controller and then they don't realize

261
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,790
Speaker 10:  how much extra work you have to put into it. Or how many ad-ons Microsoft

262
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,720
Speaker 10:  also has this thing on your Xbox consoles. I think it's called assist

263
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,140
Speaker 10:  or Microsoft assist. So if you have like, you know, your

264
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,800
Speaker 10:  partner or your brother or sister or whatever, like let's say, okay, I'm

265
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,040
Speaker 10:  playing this game, but I have some sort of impairment. There's a certain

266
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,530
Speaker 10:  thing I have difficulty doing. Like this button, this button, Microsoft

267
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,370
Speaker 10:  actually has it where you can map certain functions of one controller

268
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,790
Speaker 10:  onto an assistant controller. So someone else can help you perform those

269
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,660
Speaker 10:  functions as well. And that's baked into the operating system of the

270
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,700
Speaker 10:  Xbox, which is pretty cool. That's

271
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,240
Speaker 4:  Very cool.

272
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,450
Speaker 10:  I think that's one of the things they thought with the, you know, the Microsoft

273
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,450
Speaker 10:  accessibility controller or whatever it's called is that, oh, you know,

274
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,720
Speaker 10:  this can let a person do certain things, but then someone else can do the

275
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,590
Speaker 10:  rest of it. So they, they made it very general purpose, but

276
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,910
Speaker 10:  that's also a negative because you have to add everything else to it. So,

277
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,190
Speaker 10:  yeah, I mean, I thought, oh, I guess, I guess we're not going to sell any

278
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,550
Speaker 10:  more of these mods anymore. And this was like three or four years ago. And

279
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,210
Speaker 10:  I guess not like last couple of years, I think I've sold more per year than

280
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,860
Speaker 10:  I did in the past even. Wow.

281
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,540
Speaker 4:  I guess my last big question for you is how have you seen these

282
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,630
Speaker 4:  big gaming companies? We talked about Microsoft, but, but

283
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,260
Speaker 4:  Sony, Nintendo, even some of these other ones like

284
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,100
Speaker 4:  steam and stuff, have they started to embrace accessibility? Have you started

285
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,060
Speaker 4:  to see them change in this last 22 years that you've

286
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,540
Speaker 4:  been doing this?

287
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,050
Speaker 10:  Well, I would say a lot more changes happened in the last 10 years. Even,

288
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,470
Speaker 10:  you know, you have like able gamers, they've been pushing for this for much

289
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,950
Speaker 10:  longer than 10 years, but it does seem like the industry is starting to,

290
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,860
Speaker 10:  well, not starting. Do they have that and implemented it more and more?

291
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,490
Speaker 10:  I mean, I'm surprised Sony hasn't done more with it. I mean, they sell way

292
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,090
Speaker 10:  more consoles and like, I'm not the only one who modifies controllers. You've

293
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,810
Speaker 10:  got like evil controllers and there's a couple other ones, you know, if

294
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,320
Speaker 10:  you have like, oh, like let's say you're Sony, Hey Sony, maybe make it.

295
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,010
Speaker 10:  So your controllers a little easier to mob a person of average soldering

296
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,700
Speaker 10:  skill who hasn't been doing it for like 35 years would probably

297
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,630
Speaker 10:  struggle with it. Anyway, what I would want to say with that is since

298
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,690
Speaker 10:  people are modifying controllers, maybe, Hey, there's things they could

299
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,050
Speaker 10:  do to make it easier. Yes. There's going to be people trying to cheat or

300
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,440
Speaker 10:  quick scope or whatever in call of duty. There's also people that want to

301
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,190
Speaker 10:  modify a controllers for altruistic purposes. So, you know,

302
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,280
Speaker 10:  without affecting anything, they could make things a little easier to modify

303
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,240
Speaker 10:  or, or fix. So, yeah, I guess that would be my, my, my plea.

304
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,350
Speaker 10:  And as I mentioned, except for like the Microsoft or in part X-Box, it's

305
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,020
Speaker 10:  actually gotten easier with the controllers. I don't think it was on purpose,

306
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,860
Speaker 10:  but it's been easier. Whereas Sony is, they've actually made the

307
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,920
Speaker 10:  controller the same way longer. The next box is like, oh, here's a silkscreen

308
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,850
Speaker 10:  circuit. And that's got the four face buttons, the four shoulder

309
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,300
Speaker 10:  buttons and the cross, they keep making it the same way over and over and

310
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,080
Speaker 10:  over. And it's very hard to mod because I can't solder to a piece of plastic,

311
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,650
Speaker 10:  the silkscreen circuit. So you've got to find the traces on the PCB.

312
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,940
Speaker 10:  The PCB has no test points. Oh, and the soak screen is black or blue, which

313
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,810
Speaker 10:  makes it even harder.

314
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,010
Speaker 4:  I'm just still continuously impressed. You've been doing this for over 22

315
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,000
Speaker 4:  years and you started putting it on your website to kind of creating

316
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,750
Speaker 4:  this industry, to getting people like even Microsoft noticing your

317
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,650
Speaker 4:  work and hopefully thinking about it. But thank you

318
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,480
Speaker 4:  so much for taking the time to chat today. Ben. No

319
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:45,890
Speaker 10:  Problem.

320
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,000
Speaker 4:  Okay. I bet you didn't expect. We'd be talking about PCBs in an

321
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,050
Speaker 4:  X-Box controller that long. Finn's got a wealth of knowledge about the game

322
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,620
Speaker 4:  controller space and about the unique challenges of building controllers

323
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,220
Speaker 4:  for a wide variety of people with different capabilities. After the

324
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,250
Speaker 4:  break, I'm going to talk to somebody else who knows this space,

325
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,240
Speaker 4:  particularly the X-Box accessibility space, Bryce

326
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,020
Speaker 4:  Johnson. He's one of the creators of Microsoft adaptive controller, which

327
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,800
Speaker 4:  was maybe the first controller from a major console maker intended to

328
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,010
Speaker 4:  actually address accessibility for a wide variety of people

329
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:26,820
Speaker 4:  stated

330
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,050
Speaker 1:  Thanks to grin for supporting this episode. So you and your

331
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,040
Speaker 1:  business have finally taken the leap into influencer marketing. It's going

332
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,100
Speaker 1:  great. And you're excited to connect with your audience in a powerful new

333
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,970
Speaker 1:  way, but you've noticed you're spending a lot of time on busy work checking

334
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,390
Speaker 1:  to see if the creator has gotten your product moving through a tangled web

335
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,200
Speaker 1:  of emails and DMS. And now you're wondering, Hey, did that

336
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,130
Speaker 1:  Instagram post they promised ever even go up influencer marketing

337
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,030
Speaker 1:  can be super effective, but not if it's a drain on your time. That's

338
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,810
Speaker 1:  where green comes in. Grim is the number one creator management platform.

339
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,650
Speaker 1:  It helps you find and recruit the perfect ambassadors for your brand and

340
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,460
Speaker 1:  streamlines the communication process. You can collect all creator content

341
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,210
Speaker 1:  in one, easy to find place and track your return on investment and

342
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,200
Speaker 1:  mealtime influencer marketing. Doesn't have to be complicated. Grim

343
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,190
Speaker 1:  makes it simple. So you can treat your creators like your brand revolves

344
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,640
Speaker 1:  around them because in the creator economy, it does

345
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,350
Speaker 1:  influence our marketing is easier with grant. Find out why I

346
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,740
Speaker 1:  glen.co that's, G R I n.co.

347
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,110
Speaker 4:  And we're back, we've talked to a lot of gadget bakers for this video

348
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,530
Speaker 4:  series about their efforts to make cool stuff that maybe,

349
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,600
Speaker 4:  maybe the big guys and gadgets will pay attention to Ben

350
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,560
Speaker 4:  and other game controller monitors have actually succeeded. Maybe

351
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,860
Speaker 4:  it's because I've been doing it longer. I'm not sure, but regardless in

352
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,580
Speaker 4:  2018, Microsoft introduced the adaptive controller

353
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,540
Speaker 4:  and finally gave first party choice for people looking to make an accessible

354
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,440
Speaker 4:  controller for playing video games, no waiting for a mater, no concerns

355
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,010
Speaker 4:  about voided warranties, just an easy financial transaction.

356
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,670
Speaker 4:  And that's because of Bryce Johnson and his colleagues at Microsoft, they

357
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,020
Speaker 4:  created the adaptive controller.

358
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,200
Speaker 14:  I've been at Microsoft a while working on accessibility, probably most of

359
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,900
Speaker 14:  my time here throughout X-Box and now hardware.

360
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,730
Speaker 4:  So let's talk to them about it.

361
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,190
Speaker 4:  You know, I think it's kind of interesting that you guys did this and

362
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,610
Speaker 4:  then Microsoft released it and really put a lot of marketing and, and other

363
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,320
Speaker 4:  things behind it, a lot of resources behind it, because kind of

364
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,310
Speaker 4:  prior to that, as far as like accessibility and gaming, it was primarily

365
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,120
Speaker 4:  up to people online, like just hacking together

366
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,860
Speaker 4:  things. Would you say that's kind of correct?

367
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,150
Speaker 14:  Oh yeah, for sure. And I mean, it's not like we didn't know or notice we

368
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,630
Speaker 14:  learned a lot from a lot of people and we had wonderful partners throughout

369
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,110
Speaker 14:  the journey. I think as you get into any type of accessibility

370
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,100
Speaker 14:  inclusion, you know, we talk a lot about it and being intentional and,

371
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,000
Speaker 14:  and we kind of dig into the weeds there with the community. So that, that

372
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,630
Speaker 14:  is super important to us. But to do that, you have to be part of the community.

373
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,480
Speaker 14:  So yeah, we were there, we were there when we saw it, but we, we saw folks

374
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,610
Speaker 14:  doing things and we, we, we learned

375
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,420
Speaker 4:  Was that primarily like in forums, was it on YouTube, was like, where, where

376
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,010
Speaker 4:  were you signing a lot of that community working on these things and thinking

377
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,730
Speaker 4:  about it. Cause I think most of the community did a very different kind of

378
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,720
Speaker 4:  approach to accessibility controllers versus what you guys did, but

379
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,560
Speaker 4:  I want to get into.

380
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,340
Speaker 14:  Yeah, absolutely. And I would say that like, definitely in the beginning

381
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,070
Speaker 14:  there was a lot of YouTube, you know, I'm thinking like my buddy

382
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,840
Speaker 14:  AIJ Ryan who goes by only use me feet. There's so many people to be

383
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,530
Speaker 14:  honest, you know, nomads, all these folks, there's, there's really just

384
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,400
Speaker 14:  tons of them. I wish I could just sit here and say them all for only course

385
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,930
Speaker 14:  parolee and can't believe I forgot Brawley.

386
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,950
Speaker 4:  I think a lot of the, the ones I had seen had primarily been created for

387
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,580
Speaker 4:  people who might have only one lamb or something like that.

388
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,750
Speaker 4:  But you, you really were working on something that was available for

389
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,740
Speaker 4:  people with a wide variety of different needs. What kind of led

390
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,640
Speaker 4:  you to trying to kind of do as much as you can for as many people as you

391
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:24,940
Speaker 4:  can.

392
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,870
Speaker 14:  I think that's the answer in way it's like we wanted to do as much as we

393
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,680
Speaker 14:  can for as many people as we can. And we had to investigate a

394
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,190
Speaker 14:  lot of solutions that were out there, understand who were they were optimized

395
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,090
Speaker 14:  for. I think the one thing that is tricky and I don't want to

396
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,960
Speaker 14:  say that it's, this is a golden rule or anything, but often when you optimize

397
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,950
Speaker 14:  for one disability, you're excluding from another, right.

398
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,730
Speaker 14:  You have to figure out the balance. Right. And so for us, it was always

399
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,450
Speaker 14:  this exercise and understanding the balance. And I will say

400
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,590
Speaker 14:  that, I think that, you know, we still have a lot to learn there in that

401
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,730
Speaker 14:  way. We still are learning to understand that balance, but we started, I

402
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,910
Speaker 14:  think we're in a place that you just described, right? We started with limb

403
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,570
Speaker 14:  different vets, you know, we moved on to quadriplegia. Cause that makes

404
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,440
Speaker 14:  sense. Cause that's where a lot of limb, different bets are also quadriplegics.

405
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,520
Speaker 14:  You know, we moved on to cerebral palsy and then, you know, we moved on

406
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,090
Speaker 14:  to muscular neuromuscular conditions. So while I think we do

407
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,050
Speaker 14:  really well for limb different folks and quadriplegics and even CP,

408
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,770
Speaker 14:  you know, I definitely recognize that we could do better for neuromuscular

409
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,380
Speaker 14:  folks. And that's, you know, we're always thinking about,

410
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think it's, it's a real challenge because you do have just, you can't

411
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,380
Speaker 4:  build just w I mean, I think you guys are kind of coming close to that, but,

412
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,630
Speaker 4:  but you can't build just one thing for, for everybody.

413
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,120
Speaker 14:  Yeah. I mean, like I wanted big black buttons on the front of the controller,

414
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,750
Speaker 14:  you know, you can press it in any spot. The engineering team made it. So

415
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,050
Speaker 14:  it didn't wobble. It was fairly lightly pressed, but not too lightly pressed,

416
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,740
Speaker 14:  like the trick we did have these in the beginning, we had these a little

417
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,370
Speaker 14:  bit lighter to press, but the problem was is if you moved it, it would press

418
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,300
Speaker 14:  the button. So because it was so lightly finely tuned, but the

419
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,730
Speaker 14:  other thing about it, and I'm going to this might, you know, sorry to the

420
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,450
Speaker 14:  audio guy in advance, like you can hit these things, right? Like they're

421
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,200
Speaker 14:  meant to be hit for people who have, like, they don't have the, the

422
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,830
Speaker 14:  motor control and they have what they would call high tone so they can kind

423
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,760
Speaker 14:  of hit it. So that's just two different extreme uses, like the ability of

424
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,360
Speaker 14:  people who press to light and the ability of people who press too hard.

425
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,960
Speaker 14:  There's many spectrums like that, that we think about as we work on our

426
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,530
Speaker 14:  products. And I D I will come back to, we try to find the balance, but it

427
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,770
Speaker 14:  is always in the service of like human diversity. Right?

428
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,610
Speaker 4:  Well, that was really interesting about the community. And what I've really

429
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,400
Speaker 4:  seen from the community is, is for the most part, it's, it's, it's a lot

430
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,850
Speaker 4:  of mods and stuff. And I know a lot of people in the community specifically

431
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,570
Speaker 4:  appreciate Microsoft because you leave a lot of like

432
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,710
Speaker 4:  the pens on the board available. So people can really get in there and

433
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,460
Speaker 4:  mess around. Why did you go instead of

434
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,120
Speaker 4:  kind of doing just the most X-Box modded

435
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,780
Speaker 4:  mod, X-Box 360 controller, instead of doing that, you

436
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,710
Speaker 4:  created this, this almost joystick looking device, what kind

437
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,590
Speaker 4:  of led you from that very traditional

438
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,380
Speaker 4:  iconic look to this new one.

439
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,890
Speaker 14:  Yeah, that's a really good question. Let me kind of give you a bit of a

440
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,820
Speaker 14:  broader story around it. We knew that we needed to externalize

441
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,750
Speaker 14:  controls. So on the back of the controller, there's 19 ports that basically

442
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,530
Speaker 14:  have a switch input for every function on a game controller, plus two extras.

443
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,130
Speaker 14:  I'm actually sorry, generation nine controllers. They'll not only be one

444
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,910
Speaker 14:  extra. So if you want to have that share button, you can't. So

445
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,660
Speaker 14:  there's still a lot of options there. And so trying

446
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,560
Speaker 14:  to figure out how to externalize all those controls was, was

447
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,250
Speaker 14:  really tricky. And what allowed us to design a

448
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,120
Speaker 14:  form that was so different from a regular controller was

449
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,900
Speaker 14:  copilot. So we were working in a different direction. The original

450
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,230
Speaker 14:  hacks were in a different direction. And

451
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,160
Speaker 14:  co-pilot when we designed that as a feature, we've got that into like

452
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,330
Speaker 14:  production allowed us to like, use different forms because

453
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,110
Speaker 14:  you can always use a traditional controller alongside your

454
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,450
Speaker 14:  adaptive controller. You can use them at the same time. Can

455
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,890
Speaker 4:  You explain copilot

456
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,760
Speaker 14:  Copilot is the ability to take two controllers. So it could be an adaptive

457
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
Speaker 14:  controller or a regular traditional controller and tell the

458
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,440
Speaker 14:  Xbox or windows 10 PC that they're the same controller that

459
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,430
Speaker 14:  you really only have one controller. And for the adaptive controller, what

460
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,850
Speaker 14:  this allowed us to do is it allowed us to have this form, because if you

461
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,270
Speaker 14:  could use half the buttons on a regular controller, let's say you were limb

462
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,210
Speaker 14:  different. You could use the right half of a controller. We want you to

463
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,520
Speaker 14:  use the right half of a controller. We don't want you to go out and buy

464
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,540
Speaker 14:  stuff. We want you to use what you have. So the other thing too, for

465
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,500
Speaker 14:  copilot is some people don't even need the adaptive controller. They could

466
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,280
Speaker 14:  get what they need from two controllers. And we continue to look at that

467
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,970
Speaker 14:  as we develop the ecosystem, you know, the design for X-Box Horry

468
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,480
Speaker 14:  products that they put out, you can copilot their arcade, stick

469
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,650
Speaker 14:  with a controller. So in a sense, that's super powerful. If

470
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,830
Speaker 14:  you've looked into these hacks, you've seen people, it is about

471
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,760
Speaker 14:  modularizing control. You know, we always ask people to tell us

472
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,210
Speaker 14:  where you have movements so that we can put buttons there. We can put Joe

473
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,960
Speaker 14:  six there. I think a lot of times in the disability community, especially

474
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,950
Speaker 14:  in limited mobility community, we talk in terms of what people are missing,

475
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,710
Speaker 14:  but we don't focus on that. We focus on what people have,

476
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,940
Speaker 4:  Where do you think the community is going to go next? Like,

477
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,510
Speaker 4:  what are the next big goals in making gaming more

478
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,230
Speaker 4:  accessible

479
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,490
Speaker 14:  In terms of gaming? I think there's been a lot of people who've been talking

480
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,000
Speaker 14:  about this for a really long time, and that history should be honored. I

481
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,420
Speaker 14:  look at what gaming is doing, and I see them basically rocketing through

482
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,660
Speaker 14:  accessibility. You know, if you think about the internet, like the web was

483
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,080
Speaker 14:  designed to be accessible from the beginning, and we're still talking about

484
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,650
Speaker 14:  it, like 30 years later, like making web accessibility, we always have to

485
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,160
Speaker 14:  be kind of, sort of vigilant to make sure that we're intentionally, including

486
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,100
Speaker 14:  people, we're bringing people into the community. So we're where are we

487
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,790
Speaker 14:  going next? I think there's tons of stuff in game accessibility. That's

488
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,240
Speaker 14:  going on. Like, to be honest, after the adaptive controller, I did a lot

489
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,840
Speaker 14:  of game stuff. I then kind of sunk more into hardware stuff, and I

490
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,920
Speaker 14:  still kept basically in the gaming world. I actually I'm on a group

491
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,850
Speaker 14:  chat with like the folks from GA comp. And can I play that? And so

492
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,540
Speaker 14:  I'm still connected to that world. So it's, it's

493
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,410
Speaker 14:  really interesting to see how quickly that's developing, especially if

494
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,190
Speaker 14:  you know, the history of, of computing accessibility in general, like

495
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:39,180
Speaker 14:  human computer interaction in gaming is, is like human computer interaction

496
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,020
Speaker 14:  on extra hard, right? Put a gaming metaphor in there, right? There's so

497
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,800
Speaker 14:  many things that they're uncovering and addressing so quickly and

498
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,490
Speaker 14:  gaming accessibility. It's really quite impressive, but there is still a

499
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,330
Speaker 14:  huge way to go. I mean, even an inaccessible

500
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,320
Speaker 14:  website is somewhat more accessible than an accessible game. There's

501
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Speaker 14:  really a lot of to go on and that's not to diminish any of the work that

502
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,470
Speaker 14:  anyone's done. There's been some incredible work throughout the community,

503
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,220
Speaker 14:  but, you know, that's just that aspect of it. Like, but I mean, as you think

504
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,670
Speaker 14:  about like, well, what is gaming, right. I think, you know, one of the

505
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,840
Speaker 14:  sad things, this will I'll date myself, as I know that the mixer

506
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,830
Speaker 14:  team did a lot of really great work on how to think about like how people

507
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,010
Speaker 14:  with disabilities stream. And when you think about like the fact that if

508
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,850
Speaker 14:  you can't get a nine to five job because of a disability or, or condition

509
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,600
Speaker 14:  that you have, you know, streaming can be a viable option to help supplement

510
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,140
Speaker 14:  your income, you know, it's, it's so it's, as we think about empowering

511
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,410
Speaker 14:  people with disabilities through gaming, there is, there's just so much

512
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,310
Speaker 14:  stuff that we can do.

513
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,640
Speaker 4:  Do you think that community of people creating these controllers,

514
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,420
Speaker 4:  doing these pretty extensive mods and stuff to make these more accessible,

515
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,650
Speaker 4:  is that going to go away as companies like Microsoft and

516
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,010
Speaker 4:  Horry kind of invest more in this community? Or do you think they're going

517
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:54,670
Speaker 4:  to continue?

518
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,080
Speaker 14:  No, because I think we try to service those people, right? Like

519
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,920
Speaker 14:  when we created the adaptive controller, we definitely had

520
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,760
Speaker 14:  a sense of like supporting makers because as we

521
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,760
Speaker 14:  talked about earlier, when you lean too much in one direction, you might

522
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,090
Speaker 14:  be excluding someone else. So for example, people ask why we don't include

523
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,360
Speaker 14:  joysticks with the adaptive controller, you know, and it's kind of like,

524
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,290
Speaker 14:  well, what joystick, like a joystick for like someone with cerebral palsy

525
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,290
Speaker 14:  who might use their feet or, or a tetrapolegic that needs something bigger,

526
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,680
Speaker 14:  or like a tiny joystick for someone with like a neuromuscular condition.

527
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,220
Speaker 14:  So you realize that as soon as you start, including all these parts in here,

528
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,460
Speaker 14:  parts that cost money, some people will use them and other people won't.

529
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,240
Speaker 14:  So it is actually crucially important for us to support that maker

530
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,020
Speaker 14:  community and to have those things out there. So in many ways, we've,

531
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,680
Speaker 14:  we've actually dug deeper into that. But at the same time, you know, we

532
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,010
Speaker 14:  recognize that people want to go buy a product, that they can kind of go

533
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,940
Speaker 14:  to a store and buy in and sort of use without having to like go into

534
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,900
Speaker 14:  their garage and build something, you know? So we're trying to figure out

535
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,100
Speaker 14:  all these things, right? Like how do you create products that can be

536
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,550
Speaker 14:  extended by the maker community, but can be purchased to the store and basically

537
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,510
Speaker 14:  taken home and used.

538
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,230
Speaker 4:  So what is next for Microsoft in this area?

539
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,460
Speaker 14:  So on May 10th, we announced the Microsoft adaptive accessories.

540
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,570
Speaker 14:  It's a suite of products, which basically includes an adaptive

541
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,410
Speaker 14:  mouse that can be extended by 3d printing tales

542
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,890
Speaker 14:  and things like that. That changed this mouse in many different forms. There

543
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,820
Speaker 14:  is the Microsoft adaptive hub, which is very similar to what the

544
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,750
Speaker 14:  Xbox adaptive controller is. And then there's the, the Microsoft

545
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,800
Speaker 14:  adaptive button. So this is very similar to our D pad. This comes in a number

546
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,370
Speaker 14:  of different ways. All the functions of these devices can be programmed,

547
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,600
Speaker 14:  not only with like to whatever button presses you on, but to macros and

548
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,900
Speaker 14:  things like that, to help you kind of increase your productivity. So the

549
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,590
Speaker 14:  top of this button can be 3d printed and designed to be

550
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,310
Speaker 14:  extended by the maker community and to kind of bridge that gap

551
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,270
Speaker 14:  between makers and consumers. We've partnered with Shapeways

552
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,500
Speaker 14:  so that people can basically go to Shapeways, pick the mods that they

553
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,220
Speaker 14:  want and just have Shapeways print them and then send them to them.

554
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,910
Speaker 14:  So you don't even have to have a 3d printer to basically go in and get

555
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,260
Speaker 14:  and take advantage of the community of people that will build mods for

556
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,220
Speaker 14:  this thing. So we have like joysticks for this button. We have Cheech sticks

557
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,030
Speaker 14:  for this button. We have all kinds of things, you know, more kind of

558
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,510
Speaker 14:  vertical things. Typically a lot of quadriplegics want a bigger joystick

559
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,140
Speaker 14:  to even press buttons, you know, because this kind of movement helps. So

560
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,430
Speaker 14:  we've created this system so that people on their PCs and it

561
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:37,090
Speaker 14:  also works on, on, on mobile phones to can basically create

562
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,310
Speaker 14:  what we did with the adaptive controller. Like that's a, I think one of

563
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,090
Speaker 14:  the things that we've learned in our inclusive design practice, that is

564
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,210
Speaker 14:  something that I think we need to dig in more to is that, you know, very

565
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,780
Speaker 14:  often in accessibility, we talk about what's wrong, but we really need to

566
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,200
Speaker 14:  also focus on what's right. You know, like with the adaptive controller,

567
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,560
Speaker 14:  I couldn't really articulate this until about, until the middle of the pandemic.

568
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,160
Speaker 14:  You know, we created the adaptive controller for veterans with limited mobility,

569
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,390
Speaker 14:  but we were inspired to do so to support their mental health because they

570
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,350
Speaker 14:  loved gaming, right. We were there to support what they love. So I think

571
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,950
Speaker 14:  a lot of what we talk about and inclusive design and accessibility can sometimes

572
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,640
Speaker 14:  be about the bad things, but we need to hold on and cling to the good thing

573
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,710
Speaker 14:  we need to hold on to why they're there.

574
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,280
Speaker 4:  I want to thank Bryce and Ben, both for coming on the show. A lot of the

575
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,270
Speaker 4:  times you can get, I don't know, a little despondent about what major tech

576
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,140
Speaker 4:  companies are doing versus the little guy too often. It feels like they buy

577
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,100
Speaker 4:  up the cool stuff only to kill it, or they sell their own products for so

578
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,880
Speaker 4:  cheap. The cool stuff can't survive, but here's an instance where

579
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,510
Speaker 4:  both are happy to co-exist and actually create really

580
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,380
Speaker 4:  important technology that makes playing video games a lot

581
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,100
Speaker 4:  more accessible for a lot more people. It gives you hope for

582
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,790
Speaker 4:  people like Colin and Phil lamp who created floopy to make open source

583
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:02,300
Speaker 4:  gadgets, a real viable thing, or Jacob Alexander, who

584
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,080
Speaker 4:  just wants you to use a better keyboard than the one. It issues you

585
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,980
Speaker 4:  great. See changes in the gadget world can happen. The adaptive

586
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,640
Speaker 4:  controller feels like proof of that. You just need to find a gadget you

587
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,910
Speaker 4:  love and find a community that loves it as much as you do.
