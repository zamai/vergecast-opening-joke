Description: It’s Pixel week. Jake, Vee, and Allison are chatting about all things Google. First, there’s the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold, which get a mix of hardware upgrades (dust-proofing on a foldable!) and downgrades (a worse camera on the Pixel 10?) and a ton of new AI features, including Magic Cue and Pro Res Zoom, which puts AI right inside the camera app. Next, there’s the Pixel Watch 4, Fitbit’s AI fitness coach, the Pixel Buds 2A, and a tease of Google’s next smart home speaker. Finally, we wrap it up with the Thunder Round and a discussion of Hank Green’s Focus Friend, Ricoh’s GR IV, Netflix’s new content strategy, Masimo’s attempt to sue over the Apple Watch again, and most importantly, Chipotle’s drone delivery.


2
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:37,585

12
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:11,345
Speaker 5:  literally like too many Pixel things to talk about.

13
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:16,585
Speaker 5:  Nonstop series of announcements on Wednesday at the Made by

14
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:20,465
Speaker 5:  Google event. It was four Pixel, 10 models, some

16
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:28,225
Speaker 5:  ai, way too much ai, VNL got a chance to play with all this stuff. Before

17
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:32,025
Speaker 5:  we talk about the phones, we have to talk about the event because

18
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:35,185
Speaker 5:  this is, this is the single weirdest

19
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:38,905
Speaker 5:  I'm stoked. Announcement event. Traumatized. You know, can I say

20
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:43,745
Speaker 5:  the first episode that I think we were doing without Neli

21
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:47,025
Speaker 5:  and David? Yeah. I believe began with UV

22
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,945
Speaker 5:  going to the same venue for

23
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:51,865
Speaker 5:  same,

24
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:53,385
Speaker 2:  Same place, different venue,

25
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:56,985
Speaker 5:  Same place. Okay. Same place, different venue and, and saying,

26
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:00,605
Speaker 5:  that was a chaotic time. I don't wanna do this again. And now Google has

27
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,485
Speaker 5:  made you go back Yeah. To the Brooklyn Navy yard. I

28
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:06,725
Speaker 6:  Was not pleased finding out I was at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. I was like,

29
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:10,525
Speaker 6:  really? Guys? Really, really, it was slightly

30
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:14,365
Speaker 6:  better organized though. It's, it was at this place called Steiner Studios,

31
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:18,045
Speaker 6:  which is a movie studio, which, you know, really should have like clued to

32
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:21,765
Speaker 6:  us before what this event was gonna be like. Because

33
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:25,925
Speaker 6:  I, I just remember like when in the runup some like inside baseball and the

34
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:28,605
Speaker 6:  runup to this, we were like, what is this event gonna be? And Google will

35
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:32,565
Speaker 6:  be like, it's a surprise. It's a surprise, guys. And I was like, but why

36
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:36,085
Speaker 6:  does it have to be in Brooklyn Navy Yard? And they were like, ah,

37
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:40,805
Speaker 6:  well it's a surprise. And I was like, oh my God guys, really?

38
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,565
Speaker 6:  For real, for real, for real. Off the record, you can't tell me nothing.

39
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:47,245
Speaker 6:  And they're like, we want, it's a surprise. And I was like,

40
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:47,605
Speaker 6:  okay.

41
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,525
Speaker 5:  It was a surprise.

42
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:52,405
Speaker 6:  It was a surprise. It, it was a surprise. So

43
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:57,725
Speaker 5:  For folks who didn't watch this event, normally I, I think everybody

44
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:01,325
Speaker 5:  knows what a what a, you know, a keynote looks like the executives get up

45
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:05,285
Speaker 5:  on stage, they kind of do a deep dive. They talk to you about the ins and

46
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:06,245
Speaker 5:  outs of the phones, and then

47
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,085
Speaker 6:  You stuff, there's a Bento box after the end.

48
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:11,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there's a Bento box. Yeah. It's, you know, it's pretty nerdy. It's

49
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:15,645
Speaker 5:  for us, it's for fans. It's like it is to tell you

50
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:18,285
Speaker 5:  about the ins and outs of these products. Google didn't

51
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:19,845
Speaker 6:  Do that. No, they did not. No,

52
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:20,405
Speaker 5:  They did not.

53
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:24,365
Speaker 6:  What, what did Google do? Google ushered a bunch of us into this

54
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:28,005
Speaker 6:  little studio and you know, there was

55
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,165
Speaker 6:  an applause sign up in the rafters and there was a warmup

56
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:35,765
Speaker 6:  comic. And he was like, Hey guys, are you guys

57
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:39,485
Speaker 6:  pumped for Pixel phones? Look at you nerds with your

58
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:43,845
Speaker 6:  laptops on your thing. And you love phones, don't you guys? But I need you

59
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:47,805
Speaker 6:  to get loud for Jimmy Fallon. He's

60
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:51,365
Speaker 6:  backstage. Is this all you're gonna give for Jimmy? Is this the energy you

61
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:54,445
Speaker 6:  have for Jimmy? What publication do you work for? And I'm sitting there going

62
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:56,765
Speaker 6:  like, what the fuck is happening?

63
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:01,685
Speaker 6:  Where am I, I, what is

64
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:05,485
Speaker 6:  happening? And so then, you know, Jimmy Fallon comes out and he

65
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:10,485
Speaker 6:  is joined by Rick Olow, and they sit on a

66
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:14,125
Speaker 6:  couple of comfy couches and I'm in the front row for this. And I look up

67
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,285
Speaker 6:  And I'm like, oh my God, there's a teleprompter. And I can read

68
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:20,445
Speaker 6:  everything they're going to say before it happens.

69
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:24,405
Speaker 6:  What is happening? And then all of a sudden Jimmy would be like, tensor and

70
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:26,485
Speaker 6:  clapping his hands like a seal. We're

71
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:30,405
Speaker 7:  Gonna talk about tensor chips, we're gonna talk about IP numbers.

72
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:34,445
Speaker 6:  And I was like, I, I feel like I'm in an episode of

73
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:38,445
Speaker 6:  Wandavision because I don't know, like if you've never

74
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:42,125
Speaker 6:  been in any kind of filming situation, you kind of really have to be like,

75
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:46,125
Speaker 6:  keyed up. You have to be like, rah, just had a Red Bull and

76
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,965
Speaker 6:  here's my energy. Because any energy that's in studio that

77
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:53,925
Speaker 6:  feels way too much is hopefully like, it's not hopeful, but

78
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:57,565
Speaker 6:  it, it is gonna get like diluted and filtered when it finally

79
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:01,565
Speaker 6:  gets across your screen. But like when you're in the studio

80
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,365
Speaker 6:  audience, you're like, oh my God, it's hitting me in the face. All of this

81
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,805
Speaker 6:  energy that's happening, all of the artifice and the stage

82
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:12,845
Speaker 6:  ness of it. And I was just like, oh my God.

83
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:17,045
Speaker 6:  Cody Rigsby from the Peloton instructor who was very famous and was

84
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:20,965
Speaker 6:  on Dancing with the Stars is there, and he's going like,

85
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:24,405
Speaker 6:  Hey girl, let's do a workout. And I was like, no, no, please.

86
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:28,005
Speaker 5:  So they like, they, they basically made a fake episode of The Tonight Show.

87
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,445
Speaker 5:  Right. They made a, but it was all about

88
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:29,885
Speaker 6:  Fake episode.

89
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:33,525
Speaker 5:  The Pixel Buds. They had, they even had like special guests. They

90
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:34,405
Speaker 6:  Had special guests, they had a

91
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:37,405
Speaker 5:  QVC segment. They pre-filed videos. Like it was Yeah, there, there was a

92
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:37,765
Speaker 5:  q right

93
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,525
Speaker 6:  There, there was a segment where they're there. And I was like, I'm either

94
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:44,685
Speaker 6:  watching Good Morning America or QVC as they go through the entire lineup.

95
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:49,045
Speaker 6:  They're making a lot of digs at like Apple. At one point,

96
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:53,085
Speaker 6:  one of the Googlers was like, we can say the A word.

97
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:56,645
Speaker 6:  And I was like, oh my God. It was, were we for real? Yeah. Right now what

98
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:58,965
Speaker 6:  is happening? What is happening?

99
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:02,845
Speaker 5:  So we saw what we saw. Steph Curry, Alex Cooper, the Jonas Brothers.

100
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:06,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Kareem from Subway Takes, yeah, they have, it was a big list.

101
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:10,485
Speaker 6:  The, the Jonas Brothers made a music video on their Pixel phone. It was very

102
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:14,645
Speaker 6:  much like a, well, they do shot on iPhone. What about shot

103
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:18,045
Speaker 6:  on Pixel? And I was like, oh God, okay, here we

104
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:21,005
Speaker 5:  Are. So I think what's like, interesting about this, and maybe a little confusing

105
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:24,605
Speaker 5:  about this is like, I, this is clearly meant for a bigger audience, but like

106
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:28,445
Speaker 5:  Alison, I'm curious, having watched this remotely, like is

107
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:32,325
Speaker 5:  this, did you think that this is a thing a normal human would watch? Like,

108
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:36,645
Speaker 5:  like I I, I'm curious like if this actually is gonna connect with people

109
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:38,805
Speaker 5:  more than a traditional keynote would. Yeah.

110
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:43,245
Speaker 8:  I mean, I think we all get that. We're like, this event

111
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:46,925
Speaker 8:  wasn't for us. They had the embargo lift an hour beforehand.

112
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:51,325
Speaker 8:  So like all, all of us nerds could see the

113
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,085
Speaker 8:  specs, talk about it, think about it. And then there was this Jimmy

114
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:59,125
Speaker 8:  Fallon thing. Like I know that logically I was still

115
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,045
Speaker 8:  sitting there watching it just, just like cringing. You know?

116
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:07,005
Speaker 8:  It was like the thing you said to me about the, the energy

117
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:07,325
Speaker 8:  level.

118
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:13,005
Speaker 8:  It, it felt very keyed up watching it. Oh,

119
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:13,845
Speaker 8:  well, from

120
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:18,045
Speaker 6:  Across the country me was more keyed up in studio. Yeah. There's a lot of

121
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:21,685
Speaker 6:  tech journalists who, who, who I am friends with. And we were all just looking

122
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:25,645
Speaker 6:  at each other like, the the fuck is going on. Yeah. And then I, one of,

123
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:29,645
Speaker 6:  one of, before the warmup comic was just like, and just so you guys know,

124
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:33,725
Speaker 6:  once filming starts, you cannot get up to pee. And then

125
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:37,165
Speaker 6:  one of my journalist friends messaged me and he was like, oh my God, they

126
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:40,085
Speaker 6:  were serious. I have to pee. And they would not let me go. Okay,

127
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:43,005
Speaker 8:  First they, first they came for our water bottles first

128
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:44,885
Speaker 6:  They came for water bottles. Now,

129
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,405
Speaker 8:  Now we can't pee. Oh my

130
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:50,205
Speaker 6:  God. Now we can't pee. And I was, I, I felt

131
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:54,525
Speaker 6:  honest to God, like I was in the Twilight Zone and that I was losing it.

132
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:58,765
Speaker 6:  I I I just, you know. Yeah. Between the flashing applause signs that

133
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:00,765
Speaker 6:  went off every time Jimmy made a joke,

134
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:06,365
Speaker 6:  he, he there he could not find the Pixel device that he was not wowed by.

135
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:07,005
Speaker 6:  Like

136
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:11,205
Speaker 5:  It was Marquez pointed out in a tweet that at one point he is

137
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:12,965
Speaker 5:  holding The Pixel fold upside down.

138
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:14,245
Speaker 6:  He, it was for my story. It

139
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:16,885
Speaker 5:  Was from your, yeah, yeah. That was, yeah. And just

140
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:21,085
Speaker 8:  Thrilled, like, so excited to look at that upside. Oh my god. Wax phone

141
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:25,245
Speaker 6:  IP numbers first I was like, IP numbers,

142
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,285
Speaker 6:  doesn't he mean IP addresses? But I think he was actually talking about the

143
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:29,805
Speaker 6:  dust and waterproofing IP numbers.

144
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:35,205
Speaker 6:  So I I I was not convinced that Jimmy knew

145
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:39,765
Speaker 6:  actually what a big deal it is for IP 68 on a foldable.

146
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:43,685
Speaker 6:  I, I was not convinced. And I was like, there's no way

147
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:47,605
Speaker 6:  on earth Jimmy Fallon is that excited about tensor chips, this's

148
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:51,165
Speaker 5:  The thing. Let us be excited about IP. Yeah. Right. Someone

149
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:55,365
Speaker 5:  is, it's not Jimmy. He can't encroach on our space like

150
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:59,125
Speaker 5:  that. Right. So, okay. Do you think, like, do we think,

151
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:01,845
Speaker 5:  do you think that they will try this again, right? Because like the, the

152
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:05,725
Speaker 5:  keynote has been changing, right? Like Apple sort of invented this format

153
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,675
Speaker 5:  and then more recently Apple has already kind of shifted away from it with

154
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:14,275
Speaker 5:  their pre-made videos, which are maybe like halfway between a traditional

155
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:18,075
Speaker 5:  keynote and like a Hey everybody watch this big long commercial.

156
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,795
Speaker 5:  Like, do, do we think that Google keeps trying this?

157
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,415
Speaker 6:  I mean, you know, I did talk to a lot of Googlers on the ground, some of

158
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:30,295
Speaker 6:  which, you know, fans of the show will know and you know,

159
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:34,455
Speaker 6:  everyone was very curious to know what the reaction was. And I felt bad

160
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:37,535
Speaker 6:  because I was processing it in real time And I was like, it sure was a show.

161
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,975
Speaker 6:  And, and the thing that I kept hearing over and over again was that they

162
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,935
Speaker 6:  were trying to reach a new audience and I'm not sure they know what that

163
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:49,775
Speaker 6:  new audience that they're trying to reach is because like, who

164
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:53,415
Speaker 6:  exactly is this for? It's not for us. I know it's not for us like the tech

165
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:57,015
Speaker 6:  nerd and the tech journalists, I do think it's for a new

166
00:10:57,295 --> 00:11:00,935
Speaker 6:  audience, but I'm like, who? Because the grandmas are not gonna

167
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:05,215
Speaker 6:  stream this at 1:00 PM on Wednesday, even though they might

168
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:08,855
Speaker 6:  like Jimmy Fallon and then the kids on

169
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:12,775
Speaker 6:  TikTok are 100000% not gonna stream this live, even if

170
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:16,375
Speaker 6:  they like the subway take sky and call her daddy. So

171
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:19,615
Speaker 6:  who is this for?

172
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:23,935
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It sort of feels like, like the late night format

173
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,455
Speaker 8:  lately is so, you know, Mia talked about this on her episodes

174
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:32,055
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Is like built to get those little TikTok clips

175
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,935
Speaker 8:  out of whatever's happening. And I don't know

176
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:39,375
Speaker 8:  if that there was anything that happened that would be interesting

177
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:43,975
Speaker 8:  in a different context. Like none of that I, I don't know.

178
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:47,375
Speaker 5:  That's actually really interesting. Yeah. Like maybe this was just designed

179
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,895
Speaker 5:  to get a bunch of viral TikTok moments. Like that's, I

180
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:53,605
Speaker 6:  Think, I think it, you know, like, And I get it to it and my piece, but I

181
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:57,205
Speaker 6:  think they're just realizing that, you know, in the jobs era,

182
00:11:57,355 --> 00:12:01,125
Speaker 6:  they needed media to create the buzz. They needed the,

183
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:05,205
Speaker 6:  you know, traditional outlets. They needed the diehards to create that buzz

184
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:08,445
Speaker 6:  online to talk about the products. And now they can just skip us entirely

185
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:12,485
Speaker 6:  in some, not entirely because of course we were invited. They want us to

186
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:16,445
Speaker 6:  talk about these products, but like they can also go

187
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:20,285
Speaker 6:  around us a little bit and go straight to the people online, through the

188
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:23,925
Speaker 6:  relationships that they have with these viral influencers, through the relationships

189
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:27,845
Speaker 6:  that they have with these celebrities. And you know, it's been really interesting

190
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:31,685
Speaker 6:  to see the reaction on, on online about what

191
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:35,285
Speaker 6:  people thought because you know, there, there were some Apple fan boys who

192
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,205
Speaker 6:  were like, oh my god, Google's so cringe. Like the apple is so much better.

193
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:42,885
Speaker 6:  And then the Google fan boys going like, no, this was so much more entertaining.

194
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:46,205
Speaker 6:  And just like a mix of people who would like, I hated that. That was awful.

195
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:50,805
Speaker 6:  Why? Where are my specs? Where are my bento boxes? Who, who what?

196
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:55,765
Speaker 6:  Then people going like, you guys broke NDA. I'm like, no, we didn't actually,

197
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:58,645
Speaker 6:  it just was set for an hour before the thing.

198
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:02,325
Speaker 5:  Well, and that's, that's sort of the secret here, right? Yeah. Like Google

199
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:05,525
Speaker 5:  it, you know, I I, we're not here to, we're not complaining that Google like

200
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:08,125
Speaker 5:  didn't like left us out, right? Yeah. They like, they, they, they didn't

201
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,765
Speaker 5:  leave us out, right? No, we, we, we were briefed. We got hands ons and we

202
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:14,245
Speaker 5:  were able to run that stuff before this event. And I think that sort of is

203
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:18,125
Speaker 5:  the secret here, right? They can talk to media with

204
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,925
Speaker 5:  one hand and then talk to exactly the audience with the other. And I think

205
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,365
Speaker 5:  they're sort of redefining the keynote. It's like, we already talk to the

206
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:28,085
Speaker 5:  media, why do we need to do this thing? And it's, it's,

207
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:31,765
Speaker 5:  it's weird because those things were also for, for fans. Yeah. And now it's

208
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:34,965
Speaker 5:  like, it's not quite the fans. It's not like I don't, I don't think it's

209
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:35,885
Speaker 5:  was for the fans.

210
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:40,205
Speaker 6:  No, I don't think it was for the fans. It was for someone else. Whether

211
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:44,045
Speaker 6:  they know who that someone else is. I, I'm not sure because I felt like

212
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:47,805
Speaker 6:  there was a little bit of mixed messaging throughout a lot of like, come

213
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:51,525
Speaker 6:  on over leave the iPhone messaging and they're like, you know,

214
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,005
Speaker 6:  I forget who exactly said it, but they're like, we're done with the green

215
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:58,525
Speaker 6:  bubble conversation. I'm like, well I'm glad you guys are done with it. The

216
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,485
Speaker 6:  people in the real world are not done with

217
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,325
Speaker 5:  That Does sound like conversation. Does that sound done with that conversation?

218
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:06,415
Speaker 5:  But yeah, it was wild. So lots of stuff announced.

219
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:09,815
Speaker 5:  Obviously the headliners were the phones, Alison,

220
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,335
Speaker 5:  there were four of them. Can you give us the highlights here?

221
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:17,775
Speaker 8:  Four phones. We've got the regular Pixel 10 still

222
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:21,495
Speaker 8:  7 99. That's great. Pixel 10 Pro

223
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:25,935
Speaker 8:  9 99 Pixel 10 Pro XL. God,

224
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:29,815
Speaker 8:  there's so many. That one technically not more expensive, but

225
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:33,695
Speaker 8:  there is no longer 128 gigabyte option.

226
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:37,255
Speaker 8:  So it's 1199. And then of course The

227
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,415
Speaker 8:  Pixel 10 Pro Fold 1799

228
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,835
Speaker 8:  expensive phone. The, the kind of

229
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:49,395
Speaker 8:  higher level, they look exactly as frigging same as last year's phones.

230
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:53,205
Speaker 8:  Like they're just get that outta the way. I, you can't tell the

231
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:56,885
Speaker 8:  difference unless you're, you work at Google, but on the

232
00:14:56,905 --> 00:15:00,885
Speaker 8:  inside they all have tens or G five, which is a

233
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:05,325
Speaker 8:  moderately big deal first chip that is made by

234
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:09,165
Speaker 8:  TSMC and not Samsung. So there's a lot of interest in like how

235
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:12,805
Speaker 8:  that's gonna shake out. And they have

236
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:13,645
Speaker 8:  Q2,

237
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:18,285
Speaker 8:  our national nightmare is over. We finally have

238
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:23,325
Speaker 8:  proper Q2. The magnets are here. Yes, the magnets, the charging scene,

239
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:25,685
Speaker 8:  everything is built into the phone. You don't need a case.

240
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:31,405
Speaker 8:  So I think those are, and without

241
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:35,165
Speaker 8:  getting into ai, which we will, those are the high

242
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:38,365
Speaker 8:  level. Like here's why these are new phones.

243
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:42,805
Speaker 5:  So, okay, this is really interesting. The, the, the pro models feel like

244
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:46,405
Speaker 5:  they are basically the same phones, right? Slightly brighter

245
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,285
Speaker 5:  display, slightly bigger battery, new chip. Right. But they look the

246
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:53,965
Speaker 5:  same. It's the 10 and the fold

247
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:57,005
Speaker 5:  that have the biggest differences. And

248
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:01,645
Speaker 5:  both of them are like really interesting ones. So the, the 10 is maybe where

249
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:05,525
Speaker 5:  I wanna start, right? The Pixel 10 is getting a third camera

250
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:09,365
Speaker 5:  for the first time. It's getting a telephoto, but they're downgrading

251
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:13,735
Speaker 5:  both of the other cameras in the process, which I think is

252
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:17,815
Speaker 5:  such a fascinating trade off because it,

253
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,855
Speaker 5:  the, the differentiation between the lines, I guess I, I

254
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,575
Speaker 5:  don't know where it is now. Like if you look at them, they look identical.

255
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:28,975
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But if you care a lot, there's a pretty big difference.

256
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,375
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I think it just says a lot about where Google

257
00:16:33,515 --> 00:16:37,215
Speaker 8:  thinks it can get away with enhancing stuff in

258
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:41,215
Speaker 8:  software and where you just need the hardware. So Yeah, typically the regular

259
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:45,055
Speaker 8:  Pixel phone just has the ultra wide in the main camera.

260
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:49,615
Speaker 8:  Part of the kind of sales pitch was you get the

261
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:53,535
Speaker 8:  same like big sensor nice lens as

262
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:57,495
Speaker 8:  the pro phones, which was cool. But yeah, they added that

263
00:16:57,495 --> 00:17:00,815
Speaker 8:  five times telephoto camera, which is

264
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:05,825
Speaker 8:  the same one is on The Pixel fold, not the same one that's

265
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,705
Speaker 8:  on the pro phone. It's like what

266
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:12,465
Speaker 8:  does a pro phone mean is completely like

267
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:16,665
Speaker 8:  confusing this time around. But yeah, they did kind of like

268
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:20,865
Speaker 8:  downgrade the hardware on the main Pixel on the

269
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,625
Speaker 8:  main camera and the ultra wide because I think

270
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:27,425
Speaker 8:  they're just like, we'll, just software it,

271
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,545
Speaker 5:  Which like at the, so it's, I think it's the same cameras as on the nine

272
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,585
Speaker 5:  A, which admittedly like, they're not bad cameras. They're good

273
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:38,305
Speaker 8:  Cameras. Yeah, yeah, they're fine. And Google gave me

274
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:41,705
Speaker 8:  some kind of fluffy answer about how magical and special

275
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:46,225
Speaker 8:  the camera hardware is, even though it is probably just the same

276
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:49,925
Speaker 8:  as on the nine A. Yeah. It just, if you

277
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:54,045
Speaker 8:  look across the series just at camera specs, it's, it gets

278
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:57,805
Speaker 8:  more confusing because you've got the most expensive model, the

279
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:01,445
Speaker 8:  fold $1,800, you get kind of worse

280
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:05,285
Speaker 8:  cameras. And then there's the pro models, the slab

281
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,965
Speaker 8:  phones, those get you the best cameras and then you kind of

282
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:12,485
Speaker 8:  take another step back on the regular

283
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:16,285
Speaker 8:  models. It's, it, it's a little confusing. I think I've

284
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:20,045
Speaker 6:  Turned into that gif of the lady who's just really confused

285
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:23,245
Speaker 6:  as math symbols float around her head. That's just me, me right now.

286
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:27,125
Speaker 8:  That is Google trying to just like, what is a pro phone?

287
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:31,605
Speaker 8:  They, the only reasonable explanation last time around was it had a

288
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:35,325
Speaker 8:  telephoto lens. 'cause that's what all three had. That

289
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:39,285
Speaker 8:  doesn't exist anymore. I don't, I'm accepting any answers. That makes sense.

290
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:43,445
Speaker 5:  Right. So now, now The Pixel 10 has more

291
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:47,365
Speaker 5:  differentiation from the nine A or, or,

292
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:50,525
Speaker 5:  or you know, probably the eventual 10 A because there's three cameras instead

293
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,925
Speaker 5:  of two. But it is true if you're just like, if you're in the store and you're

294
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,785
Speaker 5:  like, should I buy The Pixel 10 or The Pixel 10 Pro? Like they, they

295
00:18:57,785 --> 00:19:01,545
Speaker 5:  look identical. Which like, I don't know. I get is is this

296
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:05,545
Speaker 5:  compete with the baseline iPhone, which doesn't have

297
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,385
Speaker 5:  that third lens? I don't know.

298
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:11,585
Speaker 8:  I I know, I think Google loves being like, look what we do that the

299
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:15,545
Speaker 8:  iPhone doesn't, like Samsung has the telephoto on, its

300
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:19,505
Speaker 8:  on its regular. So maybe it's more trying to offer some

301
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:23,665
Speaker 8:  purity there. And I, I like, I I like

302
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:27,425
Speaker 8:  a de a dedicated telephoto. So I think it's a good

303
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:29,425
Speaker 8:  change. I'm gonna try it out.

304
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:33,105
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's a really interesting trade off. So that's on the low end and then

305
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:37,015
Speaker 5:  the high end, the fold maybe like the most single

306
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:37,855
Speaker 5:  most exciting upgrade.

307
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:38,895
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

308
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,935
Speaker 8:  They made a fully dust resistant foldable. It is

309
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:47,255
Speaker 8:  IP 68 rated. As we heard Jimmy Fallon

310
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:48,615
Speaker 8:  excitedly,

311
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:52,655
Speaker 6:  I don't IP numbers. I believe that he plagiarized

312
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,695
Speaker 6:  you. He was like beforehand. They,

313
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,295
Speaker 8:  That's

314
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,575
Speaker 6:  My conspiracy theory. He, that's my conspiracy theory.

315
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,455
Speaker 8:  He learned about dust resistance on foldables about 10 minutes

316
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:05,095
Speaker 8:  before you went into that. But it's a big deal. I

317
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:09,055
Speaker 8:  talked to, so Samsung has kind of gone into

318
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:12,575
Speaker 8:  like, we're making a foldable really thin with its

319
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,575
Speaker 8:  last fold phone, which was cool. Still not quite dust

320
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:20,855
Speaker 8:  resistant. Had an IP 48 rating, which means it's, you

321
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:24,495
Speaker 8:  can't poke it with a little needle or something.

322
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:30,215
Speaker 8:  The 68 means full dust sand, bring it to

323
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:33,815
Speaker 8:  the beach, it's gonna be okay. Probably with all the

324
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:37,575
Speaker 8:  usual disclaimers of IP ratings. And

325
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:41,175
Speaker 8:  once they leave the factory, they degrade over time.

326
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:45,655
Speaker 8:  Like blah blah, blah. That's true of all, all IP ratings on

327
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:49,525
Speaker 8:  devices. But it's a new hinge. It's a

328
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:53,445
Speaker 8:  gearless hinge. I think Google's like kind

329
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:57,325
Speaker 8:  of, they could be playing it up a little more. Maybe I'm just

330
00:20:57,325 --> 00:21:00,725
Speaker 8:  super invested in this, but I'm like, I wanna hear more about

331
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:05,485
Speaker 5:  No, but you're right as possible. There's like two directions they can go

332
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:08,845
Speaker 5:  here and one is the Samsung route where they go thinner, thinner, thinner.

333
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:10,645
Speaker 5:  And like, don't get me wrong, the,

334
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,885
Speaker 6:  The, that was a nice thin foldy phone.

335
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:14,925
Speaker 5:  It wa it was a very impressive,

336
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:15,885
Speaker 6:  It was very impressive.

337
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:16,605
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Very nice.

338
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:19,685
Speaker 5:  And, and you look at that and you go, if, if everybody else is bigger than

339
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:23,645
Speaker 5:  this, like they lost. And then I look at the, at The Pixel

340
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:27,245
Speaker 5:  fold And I, I'm like, okay. It, you know, yeah, it's a little chunkier, but

341
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:31,645
Speaker 5:  it like promising that level of security on a device that

342
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:35,525
Speaker 5:  expensive that is seemingly pretty fragile. Like

343
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:38,685
Speaker 5:  that's actually a pretty smart area to run at

344
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:42,985
Speaker 5:  instead of racing to be as thin as

345
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:44,305
Speaker 5:  you can go before you get

346
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:48,145
Speaker 6:  There. Yeah. I still think that the best way to sell these phones is to

347
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:51,985
Speaker 6:  find the tech journalist in the, in the event. Yes. Who is blogging

348
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:56,305
Speaker 6:  from their Pixel fold. And I sat, I ended up sitting next to

349
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:59,865
Speaker 6:  Sam from Eng Gadget who was doing that with the Pixel fold, like the older

350
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:03,185
Speaker 6:  one. And I was just, oh my god, last time it was Allison.

351
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,745
Speaker 6:  This time it's Sam. Oh my god, do I need one? Because

352
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:11,065
Speaker 6:  I was having trouble with the wifi again, because it's a tin can

353
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:15,425
Speaker 6:  in i in the Brooklyn Navy artist deja vu. And I was like,

354
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:18,905
Speaker 6:  oh my God, they're having no problem with these foldy phones.

355
00:22:19,435 --> 00:22:22,745
Speaker 6:  Maybe that's, that's this, they don't need these keynote events. They just

356
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:26,185
Speaker 6:  need to find the one tech journalist in the thing while all everyone else

357
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:29,945
Speaker 6:  is suffering going like, oh my god, can you get wifi in here? And the one

358
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:33,825
Speaker 6:  journalist with The Pixel fold or the Samsung fold just blogging away

359
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:37,825
Speaker 6:  super fine, having no issues. And I was just like, damn,

360
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,705
Speaker 6:  do I need a Foldy phone? This is the only two times that I've wanted a Foldy

361
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:41,985
Speaker 6:  phone. It

362
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,865
Speaker 5:  Is also the only two use cases I've ever heard for foldy fold. Like,

363
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:50,145
Speaker 5:  don't get me wrong, I am obsessed with them. I want one, I

364
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:52,785
Speaker 5:  have no idea what I would do with it. And this is this, you're, you're like,

365
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:55,865
Speaker 5:  you can blog the heck out of anything you want. You

366
00:22:55,865 --> 00:22:56,425
Speaker 6:  Can glog the

367
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:58,105
Speaker 5:  Heck. You know what that is our job. We've,

368
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:01,465
Speaker 8:  I press like a dream is

369
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:05,305
Speaker 6:  Like AI have seen these things handle many of finicky

370
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:09,345
Speaker 6:  CMS. So I'm just saying that they, they're

371
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:10,105
Speaker 6:  great for journalists.

372
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:12,945
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Forget Jimmy Fallon.

373
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,945
Speaker 5:  So we talked a bunch about the cameras already, but we have, there's a lot

374
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:20,385
Speaker 5:  more to talk about with these cameras because the zoom

375
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:21,345
Speaker 5:  gets a little

376
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:22,785
Speaker 6:  So freaky. Yeah,

377
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:24,585
Speaker 5:  A little interesting. Gets a little interesting.

378
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:29,025
Speaker 8:  So the, we need like a sound, the alarm, like

379
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,065
Speaker 8:  break glass in case of emergency. Like, so

380
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:36,545
Speaker 8:  they put AI in the camera is the short version.

381
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,305
Speaker 8:  This is only on,

382
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:42,105
Speaker 5:  We need to pipe in neli screaming. Like do we not have like a

383
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:43,105
Speaker 5:  soundboard for this? I

384
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:46,965
Speaker 8:  Know. I can kind of hear it in my own head. Yeah. So

385
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:50,605
Speaker 8:  this is only on the, the pro in the Pro XL

386
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:54,485
Speaker 8:  and it's only in this feature called ProRes Zoom,

387
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:58,845
Speaker 8:  which is kind of digital zoom. It's when you get past 30 x

388
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:02,685
Speaker 8:  all the way up to a hundred. So typically like

389
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:07,325
Speaker 8:  garbage territory of like, you're not getting a good photo from that. There's

390
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:11,125
Speaker 8:  just not enough information for any kind of processing to do anything with

391
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:15,005
Speaker 8:  it. So Google was like, what if

392
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:18,925
Speaker 8:  we put generative AI in here and had it try to

393
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:22,525
Speaker 8:  figure out what you're taking a picture of. And

394
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:26,445
Speaker 8:  so that happens on device. It's in the

395
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:30,775
Speaker 8:  right in the camera. It, you can see it running

396
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:35,015
Speaker 8:  after you take the photo and it does retain like the original photo you

397
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,655
Speaker 8:  took. So you do know something is happening

398
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:42,535
Speaker 8:  does not work on people. So like, thank God

399
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,735
Speaker 6:  The demo was really wild. Like it's because we both, it's good. We were

400
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:51,215
Speaker 6:  at the demo and like we were at Google's office and they took us out on the

401
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:54,255
Speaker 6:  balcony and they're like, do you see that White House across the river?

402
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:58,855
Speaker 6:  Boop took a picture and they were like, Allison, would you like to take a

403
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:02,495
Speaker 6:  picture of the, the museum over there that's like really far away.

404
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:06,215
Speaker 6:  Whoop took a picture. V do you wanna try that water tower

405
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,815
Speaker 6:  took a picture. It the, the thing they don't tell you is that you like really

406
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:11,295
Speaker 6:  need a steady hand because

407
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:12,415
Speaker 8:  Oh, it's hard. Yeah,

408
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:15,455
Speaker 6:  It's really hard. It like mo like if you move

409
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:20,215
Speaker 6:  a millimeter well you're not in focus anymore and you just have to like

410
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:22,615
Speaker 6:  it, you really need a steady hand, right.

411
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:25,735
Speaker 5:  Because you're at 100 x controlling this like super tiny. It's a,

412
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:28,855
Speaker 6:  There's like a little picture and picture window so that you can just like

413
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:31,775
Speaker 6:  tap to refocus on the place that you wanna take a picture of. It was weird.

414
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,095
Speaker 6:  So

415
00:25:32,215 --> 00:25:35,335
Speaker 5:  I, I, last night I watched like every YouTube video of this that I could

416
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:38,935
Speaker 5:  find and it was blowing my mind be

417
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:42,935
Speaker 5:  right because there was, I think, I think it was Pet Pixel had one

418
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:45,815
Speaker 5:  where they were, I think they were zoomed in like past 50 x on this like

419
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:49,575
Speaker 5:  boat way out in the harbor. And they show the original

420
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:53,215
Speaker 5:  and it's like, fine, just the grain and ugly.

421
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:57,375
Speaker 5:  And then boom, there's the AI version.

422
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:00,935
Speaker 5:  And if you had, if you had not told me AI was involved, I would've been like,

423
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:04,495
Speaker 5:  oh, okay. Just some nice camera processing. Like, it, it, I like

424
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:07,215
Speaker 5:  compare. I was like trying to, I was doing a spot. The difference between

425
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:10,535
Speaker 5:  them, I'm like, where did it invent something? Where did it screw up? And

426
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:14,335
Speaker 5:  I could not find it. Yeah. And okay, look, obviously this is early, you know,

427
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:17,855
Speaker 5:  there's one one image I saw, but it just looked like a cleaner,

428
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:22,255
Speaker 5:  crisper version of what you're actually seeing. Like it looks like it is

429
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:24,495
Speaker 5:  really just fixing it, cleaning it up.

430
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:26,535
Speaker 5:  It's wild.

431
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:30,655
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I totally agree. I talked to Isaac Reynolds who heads up

432
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:34,455
Speaker 8:  The Pixel camera team And I was, I was like, okay,

433
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:38,295
Speaker 8:  what are you doing here? AI in the camera. What is a photo? Like, put him

434
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:42,935
Speaker 8:  through the gauntlet of questions and he was really like, you know,

435
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:46,885
Speaker 8:  know this is an algorithm. Like we've, in a similar

436
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:50,685
Speaker 8:  way we've used in the past. It's just really good at like

437
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:55,125
Speaker 8:  getting rid of the artifacts that you would see from the, the

438
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:58,285
Speaker 8:  upsampling and the, you know, image processing

439
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:03,045
Speaker 8:  pipeline in that, you know, his claim is that is not gonna do

440
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:06,965
Speaker 8:  anything you wouldn't expect from a camera. 'cause that's where I'm like,

441
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:10,965
Speaker 8:  what is it gonna invent stuff? Is it gonna, you know,

442
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:15,205
Speaker 8:  put different things that weren't there, like lochness monster out there.

443
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:19,165
Speaker 6:  It was like a weird, you know, because there were instances where we're getting

444
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:23,125
Speaker 6:  pictures of people versus like the things and and, and the

445
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:27,125
Speaker 6:  buildings or the architecture or whatnot would be kind of unnaturally clear

446
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,245
Speaker 6:  for something taken that far. And then the people would just be blobs. Yeah.

447
00:27:30,245 --> 00:27:33,365
Speaker 6:  And I get why they're not doing the people that's like very important that

448
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:35,725
Speaker 6:  they're not doing the people. But that, that was the one thing that I was

449
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:35,845
Speaker 6:  like,

450
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,445
Speaker 8:  This is a blob. Yeah, it

451
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:43,605
Speaker 5:  Does. So there'll be a blob within your crispr Yes. Everything else. Oh,

452
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:44,925
Speaker 5:  that's okay. Yeah,

453
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:45,365
Speaker 6:  It's weird,

454
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:49,715
Speaker 5:  Right? I guess they, because that would be creepy at a minimum.

455
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,875
Speaker 5:  Like you're at like a hundred x Geez. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

456
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,235
Speaker 6:  Right. Creepy at a minimum dangerous.

457
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:55,955
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

458
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:58,115
Speaker 6:  Yeah. In a different context.

459
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:01,755
Speaker 5:  This is is wild. It's,

460
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:07,215
Speaker 5:  I'm curious where it goes from here. Yeah. And if it's, if it is

461
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:11,095
Speaker 5:  like limited to this zoom function, 'cause this like got my

462
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:14,295
Speaker 5:  mind racing on whether I'm like, okay is like the future of The Pixel camera.

463
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:18,095
Speaker 5:  Just everything gets like diffusion

464
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:22,735
Speaker 5:  and they use this to, right. Like why not enhance details elsewhere? Right.

465
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:26,375
Speaker 5:  They know what they, they know what a, a proper DSLR photo is supposed to

466
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,815
Speaker 5:  look like. Forget portrait mode. Why don't they just like, can they just

467
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:30,455
Speaker 5:  diffusion it?

468
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:34,935
Speaker 6:  I mean there were so many camera features that

469
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:38,495
Speaker 6:  like when Alice And I were getting the demos, I was just like in my head

470
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:42,095
Speaker 6:  like, you know, you're smiling to be polite in, in, in person and in your

471
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,975
Speaker 6:  head I'm going like, Hey Ray, everything

472
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:49,935
Speaker 6:  is, what is a photo? Oh no. Okay. Oh God. Oh

473
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:53,535
Speaker 6:  no. Oh. Like that, that was in my head

474
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:56,575
Speaker 6:  happening at the time. It's very impressive. But at the same time, if you're

475
00:28:56,575 --> 00:29:00,175
Speaker 6:  thinking, if you are contemplating what is a photo there,

476
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:02,095
Speaker 6:  there's just a lot of screaming that's going on.

477
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:06,095
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, and In fact, actually, now that I say it, there are other parts

478
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:09,775
Speaker 5:  of the camera where it is inventing photos. So there's this new camera coach

479
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:13,495
Speaker 5:  thing and it invents photos and tells you to go take them, right?

480
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:13,935
Speaker 5:  Like

481
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:14,935
Speaker 8:  This is, yeah. Yeah. Did

482
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:16,015
Speaker 5:  You get to demo this? Yes.

483
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:19,695
Speaker 8:  Yeah, we did. And it, you kind of get into the camera coach

484
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:23,375
Speaker 8:  mode, so it's separate and then I, I believe

485
00:29:23,515 --> 00:29:27,135
Speaker 8:  you take a photo and it, it invents some like

486
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:29,975
Speaker 8:  potential photos you could take like with

487
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:33,775
Speaker 6:  That would be better. Yeah. So it's nagging your natural photo taking ability

488
00:29:33,795 --> 00:29:34,575
Speaker 6:  too. It's just

489
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:38,695
Speaker 8:  Right. But, and importantly you pick one and then it takes you

490
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,685
Speaker 8:  through the steps. It's like, okay, well now get down lower or

491
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:46,485
Speaker 8:  compose it this way and you end up with your photo

492
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:50,085
Speaker 8:  and the, the AI one gets thrown away. But it is like

493
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:54,125
Speaker 8:  you're seeing that little glimmer of like, okay, what's coming next

494
00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:55,725
Speaker 8:  if this is what you're doing right now.

495
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:59,685
Speaker 5:  Right. It's so interesting. It's like you, I have to go take it, but like,

496
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:02,965
Speaker 5:  actually you already made it. You like Yeah, it's already here. Like, do

497
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:06,685
Speaker 5:  I, did I need to take it? Yeah. I mean, I would prefer to take it. I I

498
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:10,765
Speaker 5:  I will say like the, the camera coach thing seems like one of those

499
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,765
Speaker 5:  very impressive, like, AI is crazy. Look at all these things. It can do,

500
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:18,685
Speaker 5:  can analyze the scene live and it takes you how to like, take it. I don't

501
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:21,565
Speaker 5:  know who's gonna use it or why I don't wanna use it. It do, they

502
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:25,365
Speaker 6:  They told us it was for like, people who are intimidated by photography or

503
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:29,285
Speaker 6:  who take like really crappy pictures but want like that Instagram worthy,

504
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:33,605
Speaker 6:  like cool looking picture and learning about composition and lighting

505
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,005
Speaker 6:  Okay. And how to do that stuff. But it's also like

506
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:40,605
Speaker 5:  They should have thrown a gnarly flash on the back of this thing

507
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:45,325
Speaker 5:  and, and forced it to be on at all times. Yes. If they wanted to

508
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:48,965
Speaker 5:  appeal to, to like they, nobody's trying to take

509
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:51,845
Speaker 5:  Instagram photos anymore. No, this isn't happening.

510
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:55,405
Speaker 6:  That's why it's a coach. Right. This is because they're, they're like, this

511
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:59,285
Speaker 6:  is for beginners. It's not for people who already know how to do the photography

512
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:03,205
Speaker 6:  stuff. And I, you know, And I, I was the model for Allison's

513
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:07,165
Speaker 6:  demo and boy did I get a quad workout because it kept

514
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:11,045
Speaker 6:  telling me to like do a dynamic pose or whatnot. Or like Allison threw the

515
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,205
Speaker 6:  thing was telling me to do that. Yeah.

516
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:15,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Why did you be dynamic?

517
00:31:15,995 --> 00:31:19,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I did. My, my legs were hurting, so thanks ai.

518
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:25,285
Speaker 5:  Okay, last thing in the, about the cameras

519
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:28,125
Speaker 5:  last big thing is it is building in

520
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:33,405
Speaker 5:  credentials saying it's tagging them as ai. Yeah. Right? Yeah.

521
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:36,725
Speaker 5:  When you do these, I guess not the camera coach, but if you're doing the

522
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:40,165
Speaker 5:  zoom, if you're doing the crazy zoom thing, it's gonna tell you in the metadata

523
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:40,645
Speaker 5:  that is ai,

524
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:44,365
Speaker 8:  Right? Yeah. And, and oh, more importantly like, yeah,

525
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:48,325
Speaker 8:  I talked to Isaac and it's tagging

526
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:51,845
Speaker 8:  every photo you take with the camera, not just the AI ones.

527
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:57,245
Speaker 8:  If there's, there's no AI used, it just says something like taken

528
00:31:57,245 --> 00:32:00,725
Speaker 8:  with a camera. It'll say something like, if you took, why

529
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:02,565
Speaker 5:  Does that have to be established? Well,

530
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:02,845
Speaker 8:  Well

531
00:32:02,905 --> 00:32:04,405
Speaker 5:  Here's the alternative because

532
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:07,845
Speaker 8:  What is the photo? We live in a dys dystopian future

533
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,445
Speaker 8:  where no, yeah. It's like

534
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:12,965
Speaker 5:  There's no such thing as a photo that is not taken by a camera. Right? Am

535
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,565
Speaker 5:  I, is there something I'm missing here?

536
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:18,645
Speaker 8:  So, okay, so the, the rationale for this is

537
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:22,525
Speaker 8:  if you only tag the things that are ai, then it gives the

538
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:26,445
Speaker 8:  appearance that the untagged thing is real,

539
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:28,805
Speaker 8:  which may not be the case. Okay. Okay.

540
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:29,045
Speaker 5:  We just,

541
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:33,565
Speaker 8:  We just don't know if it's AI or not. So this is a little

542
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:37,365
Speaker 8:  bit of like, Google's going to set the good example and

543
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:41,325
Speaker 8:  hopefully every, you know, Instagram will have all kinds of tags

544
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:43,525
Speaker 8:  about this was taken with the camera and

545
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:49,525
Speaker 8:  we will see how, how that pans out. But I, I

546
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:52,245
Speaker 8:  appreciate that they're doing it And I, I get it.

547
00:32:53,635 --> 00:32:54,165
Speaker 8:  It's weird,

548
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:58,925
Speaker 5:  You know, sometimes this word is a photo question is like impossible to

549
00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:02,685
Speaker 5:  answer and other times I'm like, yeah, it's a camera. It's like it's,

550
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:07,125
Speaker 5:  was there a camera like Yes. Yeah. That if it wasn't taken with a camera,

551
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:11,125
Speaker 5:  I feel very confident. It feels like unimpeachably not a photo. If

552
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:15,365
Speaker 5:  vergecast at The Verge dot com email me if you can figure out

553
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,925
Speaker 5:  what a photo is that's not taken by a camera.

554
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,085
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's not Well it's

555
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:20,605
Speaker 6:  Just a picture.

556
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:21,365
Speaker 5:  It is

557
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:23,205
Speaker 6:  But we wouldn't call it a photo. We

558
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:26,325
Speaker 5:  Just wouldn't call it. Yeah, yeah. Oh gosh. Okay. Yeah,

559
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:28,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

560
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,965
Speaker 5:  This is a, a photo realistic painting that

561
00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:34,185
Speaker 5:  it's not, it's not,

562
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:37,505
Speaker 6:  It's a picture. A picture versus a photo is gonna be

563
00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:39,235
Speaker 6:  okay.

564
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,635
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is, it's

565
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:45,475
Speaker 8:  A robot's memory of a tree that it saw

566
00:33:45,495 --> 00:33:46,115
Speaker 8:  one time. I'm just saying

567
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:49,955
Speaker 6:  We should do a, what is a photo package and just have everyone on staff contribute

568
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:53,475
Speaker 6:  and lose our minds collectively. And just let that live

569
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:53,995
Speaker 6:  online.

570
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:57,675
Speaker 5:  That's the end state of The Verge. Yeah. 'cause all of us become

571
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,715
Speaker 5:  hermits afterward

572
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:02,795
Speaker 8:  After we we'll be released, we can

573
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:05,435
Speaker 6:  Rest. We'll just, you know, we'll we'll do this one last, what is a photo

574
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:09,235
Speaker 6:  package and then all of our souls will be released to Valhalla and

575
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:09,955
Speaker 6:  we'll retire.

576
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:10,995
Speaker 8:  Exactly.

577
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:15,235
Speaker 5:  The other thing we have to talk about here is Magic Q, which is like the,

578
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:19,035
Speaker 5:  maybe the flagship feature from the AI standpoint, at least as

579
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:22,915
Speaker 5:  Google is pushing it. Alison like, is this thing actually going to be help?

580
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:26,715
Speaker 5:  Like this is their attempt to make I ai actually

581
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:27,995
Speaker 5:  maybe potentially useful.

582
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:32,075
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And it's, the demos we saw were really

583
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:35,835
Speaker 8:  interesting, but they were on rails. So just, just to explain,

584
00:34:36,985 --> 00:34:40,795
Speaker 8:  this is sort of a contextual, always

585
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:44,915
Speaker 8:  their AI that can kind of

586
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:49,555
Speaker 8:  prompt and autofill things that might be relevant. So the,

587
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:53,755
Speaker 8:  I think demo everybody saw was a friend text you

588
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:57,315
Speaker 8:  like, Hey, do you have the details about our dinner

589
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:00,755
Speaker 8:  reservation tonight? And Magic hu will

590
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:05,155
Speaker 8:  kind of take that and go to your Gmail and come

591
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:08,915
Speaker 8:  back with, you know, the relevant details In theory

592
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,995
Speaker 8:  that it's like the name of the restaurant and it'll, it'll

593
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:16,755
Speaker 8:  kind of present that as a thing. You can just potentially

594
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:18,435
Speaker 8:  like paste into the conversation.

595
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:23,595
Speaker 8:  So there's a, a little bit, it's, I I think

596
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:26,115
Speaker 8:  it was described to us as ephemeral

597
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:31,355
Speaker 5:  That is like concerning. They're like, we're not storing all of your

598
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:35,235
Speaker 5:  data forever. We, we, we know all of it. We just might not,

599
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:38,125
Speaker 5:  we just might not hang onto this is like, this is the dream, right? Like

600
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,565
Speaker 5:  this is, I mean this sort of gets at what, what Apple was trying to problem

601
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:43,925
Speaker 5:  with Siri where it's like it knows everything. It sees everything it surfaces

602
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:44,885
Speaker 5:  for you at the right time.

603
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,805
Speaker 5:  It's not, it's not entirely clear. Like I love the pitch of this, right?

604
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:52,645
Speaker 5:  Like those are the things that are super annoying to like juggle and look

605
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:56,485
Speaker 5:  up. Can it actually pull that stuff up? Can it do this in

606
00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:59,565
Speaker 5:  every app? Yeah. Is it just like these select googly moments? No,

607
00:35:59,705 --> 00:36:03,245
Speaker 8:  But it is a handful of like Google apps, like

608
00:36:04,215 --> 00:36:08,045
Speaker 8:  Gmail calendar messages. It is in

609
00:36:08,185 --> 00:36:10,365
Speaker 8:  Gboard. So it can kind of

610
00:36:11,955 --> 00:36:15,845
Speaker 8:  work a little bit outside of just those core apps where

611
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:20,845
Speaker 8:  if you were looking at something in Chrome and it senses you went to

612
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:24,485
Speaker 8:  a shopping app, it's like you Oh right. That's you open up Amazon. Yeah.

613
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:28,405
Speaker 8:  That's the example we got. It can suggest text in Gboard that you

614
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:31,845
Speaker 8:  might wanna paste in. It is all happening on device,

615
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,325
Speaker 8:  which is good from the scary privacy

616
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:39,885
Speaker 8:  perspective and it incorporates some of like

617
00:36:40,475 --> 00:36:44,125
Speaker 8:  some of your very recent activities. So like in that example of

618
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,485
Speaker 8:  something you were looking at

619
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:50,645
Speaker 8:  and, and sort of feeds that into what you might

620
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:54,805
Speaker 8:  see as suggested activities, but it's not

621
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:58,805
Speaker 8:  saving those for super long. I, we didn't get exacts

622
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:02,205
Speaker 8:  on any of that, but just enough to feel like

623
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:04,485
Speaker 8:  maybe this isn't too scary,

624
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:09,245
Speaker 6:  It's cool if it works. The question is is like, is it gonna get the

625
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:12,925
Speaker 6:  right reservation? What if you're someone who's like a social butterfly

626
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:17,085
Speaker 6:  and you're meeting some of the same people in the same group

627
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:20,965
Speaker 6:  chats, but in different group configurations. Like can it handle that?

628
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:22,045
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

629
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:25,645
Speaker 5:  It's interesting too because Google sort of already like has

630
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:30,045
Speaker 5:  pieces of this individually within apps, right? Where it's like

631
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:33,885
Speaker 5:  there's stuff with this that you can just hard code Gmail already

632
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,925
Speaker 5:  surfaces your flights at the right time. It started doing this thing

633
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:41,285
Speaker 5:  that honestly I find very annoying. But it's like, it'll be like, Hey, you've

634
00:37:41,285 --> 00:37:43,645
Speaker 5:  got a package coming and we're gonna put the package thing up so you know

635
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:47,405
Speaker 5:  that your package is coming today. Right? So it's like already reading

636
00:37:47,405 --> 00:37:50,725
Speaker 5:  your emails, it's figuring out when you need them and surfing the right moments.

637
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:54,725
Speaker 5:  It's like being able to do that, take it to another app,

638
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:58,445
Speaker 5:  read what's happening in the app, give it to you at that time. Like that

639
00:37:58,505 --> 00:38:02,405
Speaker 5:  is, that's a lot of juggling to do. And it's

640
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:06,285
Speaker 5:  like, okay, flights got it. That's a good use case. This feels like a thing

641
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:10,085
Speaker 5:  that they've probably programmed a few specific things for And I

642
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:13,965
Speaker 5:  maybe it expands over time. Like I, I think the idea is

643
00:38:14,285 --> 00:38:18,125
Speaker 5:  fascinating and it's just not clear to me if they can actually execute this.

644
00:38:18,795 --> 00:38:22,565
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It, it'll be interesting like one to try it out and

645
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:26,445
Speaker 8:  see if it actually works outside of these demos. And two, like

646
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:30,925
Speaker 8:  it sort of gets at that thing of are they just gonna

647
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:34,725
Speaker 8:  circumvent us going into apps? Are app developers

648
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:36,365
Speaker 8:  gonna love that? Like, ooh,

649
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:40,685
Speaker 6:  In the engagement economy, that's gonna be interesting.

650
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:44,685
Speaker 8:  I know like, ooh, they can, the, I mean presumably app developers

651
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:48,565
Speaker 8:  can just be like, no, we're not gonna open this up to magic queue.

652
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:52,445
Speaker 8:  You know, if that ever became an option. But yeah, I wonder,

653
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:55,845
Speaker 8:  I sort of wonder what the limits are on something like this,

654
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:58,325
Speaker 8:  but it's gotta work first. So

655
00:38:58,485 --> 00:39:02,005
Speaker 5:  I, I'm really curious. They also have this like daily hub thing that like

656
00:39:02,115 --> 00:39:04,845
Speaker 5:  pops up with like a bunch. Like here's all the stuff for you to do today.

657
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:08,165
Speaker 5:  And I, I'm like, I'm super interested in what this is actually capable of.

658
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:10,965
Speaker 5:  'cause it keeps, it's like, here's all this stuff on your calendar today.

659
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,445
Speaker 5:  And I'm like, oh, okay. That would actually be really interesting for me

660
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:17,965
Speaker 5:  because I, like, I use Google Calendar a little bit at work,

661
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:21,525
Speaker 5:  but most of my life is in tick tick the to-Do app

662
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:25,245
Speaker 5:  and if it can't access tick tick, then it's actually just like useless to

663
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:25,365
Speaker 5:  me.

664
00:39:25,675 --> 00:39:29,445
Speaker 8:  Yeah. They, and this is kind of a version of something

665
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:32,485
Speaker 8:  Samsung has, they call it like the now brief

666
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:37,165
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. That I have found to be just completely useless.

667
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:37,965
Speaker 8:  Honestly.

668
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:42,645
Speaker 6:  Honestly, the funny thing is that it feels like they sort of also took this

669
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:46,245
Speaker 6:  from smartwatch features, which are morning report. And like you wake up

670
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:48,605
Speaker 6:  on your smartwatch first thing in the morning and it tells you the weather,

671
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:52,285
Speaker 6:  it tells you what Yeah. Workout you're having next and it tells you everything

672
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:53,445
Speaker 6:  on your calendar. So

673
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:54,925
Speaker 8:  I I like that honestly.

674
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:58,165
Speaker 6:  Like I I honestly don't think it belongs on your phone. I think it belongs

675
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:02,085
Speaker 6:  on something like that. That's Yeah. My, I'm biased but that's my

676
00:40:02,155 --> 00:40:03,285
Speaker 6:  take on that.

677
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:04,725
Speaker 8:  We'll see.

678
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:08,925
Speaker 5:  I wanna make sure we talk about one more important thing on the phones,

679
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,285
Speaker 5:  which is that there's some magnets.

680
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:12,805
Speaker 6:  There are magnets. Oh yeah,

681
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:14,845
Speaker 5:  You touched touched on this a little bit, but

682
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:20,285
Speaker 5:  Chee two is real. It's happened. It's the, the only

683
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:24,205
Speaker 5:  other phone was the HMB skyline, which is more of a punchline

684
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:25,365
Speaker 5:  than a actual product.

685
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:31,845
Speaker 5:  I This is great, right? Like this is, I know it is, is exactly MagSafe now

686
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:34,805
Speaker 5:  it's on Pixel Buds. They build it into the actual phones. A bunch of accessories

687
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:38,245
Speaker 5:  did like is there, is there more to this? It's just good. It's like they

688
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:38,805
Speaker 5:  did it, it works.

689
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:40,245
Speaker 8:  I think so. It,

690
00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:43,075
Speaker 6:  They said it in the, in the show they

691
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:44,315
Speaker 8:  Said Jimmy, Jimmy is

692
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:48,195
Speaker 6:  So MagSafe and Apple stuff and, and Jimmy Fallon was

693
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,715
Speaker 6:  like, can't we say the A word? So that's why he said that.

694
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:52,675
Speaker 6:  So yeah. Yeah.

695
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:56,355
Speaker 5:  I'll say like, this is, I I, there's a lot of stuff I'll

696
00:40:56,355 --> 00:40:59,595
Speaker 5:  criticize Apple for like keeping locked down And I, I

697
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:04,235
Speaker 5:  marvel at the fact that they opened up Mag safe to the Q

698
00:41:04,235 --> 00:41:08,135
Speaker 5:  ecosystem and this seems right now most seems good for

699
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:11,615
Speaker 5:  Android. Yeah. Like I I assume this helps all their partners who make all

700
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:14,215
Speaker 5:  these accessories. 'cause they're gonna get to sell a whole lot more of 'em

701
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:18,265
Speaker 6:  And there's so much money. Yeah. In And I, I think they're just like, they

702
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:21,705
Speaker 6:  weighed the pros and cons. 'cause in my mind Apple just has like a bunch

703
00:41:21,705 --> 00:41:25,105
Speaker 6:  of supply chain people and like those math nerds who are like

704
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:28,865
Speaker 6:  the pros and the cons of how much money gets into our pocket by making it

705
00:41:28,865 --> 00:41:32,305
Speaker 6:  open versus closed. And they just did the beepboop bop math and they were

706
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:35,645
Speaker 6:  like, oh, we get get so much more money for like opening it up. Mm.

707
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:40,085
Speaker 6:  Let The Pixel have the mag safe or whatnot. That's just like how

708
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,325
Speaker 6:  I think it went my computer very

709
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:43,325
Speaker 8:  Meanwhile Green Bubbles, they're like,

710
00:41:45,055 --> 00:41:46,285
Speaker 8:  seems like all downside.

711
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:49,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That one's still not happening.

712
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:55,565
Speaker 5:  All right, we gotta take a break when we're back, we're gonna talk all about

713
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:56,605
Speaker 5:  the wearables.

714
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:53,485
Speaker 6:  the first one 'cause it was a first gen device. And then the third one came

715
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:56,405
Speaker 6:  out And I was like, we're done catching up guys. We we're, we're here now

716
00:44:56,465 --> 00:45:00,405
Speaker 6:  we have arrived third time's the charm. And so I was like, oh yeah,

717
00:45:00,425 --> 00:45:03,245
Speaker 6:  so like, what are you gonna do next year for the fourth? And then they were

718
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,525
Speaker 6:  like, how about we blow your mind with

719
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:06,365
Speaker 5:  Ai?

720
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:08,725
Speaker 6:  And that's, which

721
00:45:08,825 --> 00:45:10,805
Speaker 5:  Is honestly what no man wants to hear.

722
00:45:11,025 --> 00:45:14,485
Speaker 6:  No one wants to hear that. Yeah. But it was actually like a substantive update

723
00:45:14,485 --> 00:45:18,125
Speaker 6:  when I was writing my hands-on. I was just like, oh Jesus Christ, I forgot

724
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:22,085
Speaker 6:  about this feature. Oh Jesus Christ, I forgot about that feature. Oh, I

725
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:25,685
Speaker 6:  get, I have to do two separate hands ons because there's

726
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:30,005
Speaker 6:  also an AI coach that's coming and that deserves its own 1200

727
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:32,765
Speaker 6:  words of, of talking about. So it, it was a lot.

728
00:45:33,135 --> 00:45:36,085
Speaker 5:  Right? So, okay, so there's like a mix of things going on here. There's a

729
00:45:36,085 --> 00:45:40,005
Speaker 5:  bunch of like small but meaningful hardware updates, right? It's the, the

730
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:42,325
Speaker 5:  screen is 50% brighter. So

731
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:46,245
Speaker 6:  There's, there's a domed display. So you know

732
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:49,845
Speaker 6:  the glass is domed because they have this little, what they call a rain droplet

733
00:45:49,845 --> 00:45:52,645
Speaker 6:  design. It looks like a little bead of water on your wrist. And that's their

734
00:45:52,645 --> 00:45:56,285
Speaker 6:  design ethos. So that display is, the glass is domed and now the

735
00:45:56,285 --> 00:46:00,165
Speaker 6:  display, the actual display underneath is also domed. And that

736
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:03,765
Speaker 6:  enables a, a couple of different things. It's 50% brighter, 3000 knits

737
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:08,205
Speaker 6:  and then it, it's the bezels are 15% thinner than the last

738
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:11,765
Speaker 6:  generation and the active display area is 10% larger.

739
00:46:12,265 --> 00:46:15,605
Speaker 6:  So like, just by making it domed they did all of that stuff

740
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:18,085
Speaker 5:  Like that sounds very silly but it's actually like a very meaningful

741
00:46:18,385 --> 00:46:21,765
Speaker 6:  It is. And then like we, I got the chance to look at like The Pixel

742
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:26,285
Speaker 6:  two, three and four side by side with the flashlight on so that I

743
00:46:26,285 --> 00:46:29,365
Speaker 6:  could see like the difference between both the brightness and the bezels.

744
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:32,925
Speaker 6:  And I'm like, if you look at the progression of it, it is quite impressive.

745
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:36,685
Speaker 6:  So that was just like, oh nice nice hardware guys. Yeah. Good,

746
00:46:36,685 --> 00:46:40,285
Speaker 5:  Good job. So, so some some like meaningful hardware improvements also, like

747
00:46:40,285 --> 00:46:43,805
Speaker 5:  dual frequency GPS you like satellites os

748
00:46:44,145 --> 00:46:46,685
Speaker 5:  repair. Well we can talk about the repairability a little bit more later,

749
00:46:46,785 --> 00:46:49,245
Speaker 5:  but it, there, it's more repairable than any other watch.

750
00:46:50,785 --> 00:46:53,765
Speaker 5:  And then there's the ai, the AI is all the other stuff, right?

751
00:46:53,995 --> 00:46:57,285
Speaker 6:  There's, there's just like so much on there. There's like,

752
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:02,165
Speaker 6:  well like the Samsung watches, the Gemini is now on the wrist, but

753
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:06,325
Speaker 6:  also like you have smarter contextual

754
00:47:06,435 --> 00:47:10,165
Speaker 6:  replies so that you know, in, so, so one of the things about

755
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:12,925
Speaker 6:  smart replies on the smart watches, like someone texts you and you can just

756
00:47:12,925 --> 00:47:16,645
Speaker 6:  go boop and and quick reply back and usually they're pretty canned responses,

757
00:47:16,645 --> 00:47:19,245
Speaker 6:  right? They're like, yes, no on my way.

758
00:47:20,515 --> 00:47:23,215
Speaker 6:  And like when I was talking to the Pixel Watch team, they're like, you know,

759
00:47:23,485 --> 00:47:26,975
Speaker 6:  most of the time people only use it about 30% of the time for conversations.

760
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:30,685
Speaker 6:  It's not that helpful. So now that the, there's like an

761
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:34,525
Speaker 6:  on-device LLM model on there, it will context give

762
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:38,605
Speaker 6:  contextual replies based on what was was texted back. It was like, oh, so

763
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,525
Speaker 6:  someone texted you about a game. It could be like, yay, I am really happy

764
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:45,165
Speaker 6:  we won. And like that's the response that you get to send back. And it's

765
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:48,885
Speaker 6:  not limited to the default messages app. So if you use

766
00:47:49,045 --> 00:47:53,005
Speaker 6:  a different one like WhatsApp if you use, I don't know if that's signal 'cause

767
00:47:53,005 --> 00:47:56,765
Speaker 6:  there's privacy stuff there, but like cacao talk, which all my Koreans know,

768
00:47:57,365 --> 00:48:01,285
Speaker 6:  that is the, the text messaging apple of choice for Korea and Korean

769
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:05,245
Speaker 6:  Americans. And you know, you'll be able to have those contextual

770
00:48:05,245 --> 00:48:08,925
Speaker 6:  replies from that. And so that's like one of the many

771
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:12,725
Speaker 6:  ways that AI can be used on the wrist. And as I've written before

772
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:16,445
Speaker 6:  though, using a on the wrist is just a little, is a little weird.

773
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:20,525
Speaker 5:  I it it's like on one hand for a smartwatch, I think those

774
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:24,245
Speaker 5:  contextual replies could legitimately be like pretty

775
00:48:24,305 --> 00:48:28,245
Speaker 5:  useful. Yeah. 'cause you do not wanna be typing, but Alison you just spent

776
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,325
Speaker 5:  a week using your watch as your main

777
00:48:32,325 --> 00:48:35,965
Speaker 5:  device and you did a bunch of typing on it And I think it was okay.

778
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:40,525
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And maybe it is a little bit of pride for me 'cause I'm like, I'm not

779
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:44,485
Speaker 8:  using those canned responses or you know, even if they are

780
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:48,285
Speaker 8:  like pretty close to what I wanna say, that, you know,

781
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:52,005
Speaker 8:  I'm like, this is my profession robot don't come for me.

782
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:57,805
Speaker 8:  But yeah, I could see how it, it's just when you're initiating the

783
00:48:57,805 --> 00:49:01,605
Speaker 8:  conversation, I'm like texting my husband on my way home. I don't know how

784
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:05,965
Speaker 8:  AI knows that I wanna do that, but I can see it being useful

785
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:09,925
Speaker 8:  and maybe I'll just like get over my hangup with auto reply

786
00:49:09,925 --> 00:49:10,205
Speaker 8:  stuff.

787
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:14,845
Speaker 5:  I've gotten really into voice to text on text

788
00:49:14,845 --> 00:49:18,285
Speaker 5:  messaging. I'm, I'm, now I'm like, I don't feel like typing, like if, if

789
00:49:18,285 --> 00:49:21,645
Speaker 5:  this is oh, voice memos are anywhere, I'm not doing a full voice memo. Oh

790
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:25,165
Speaker 5:  no, I'm straight up voice to texting. I sh maybe I should voice because it,

791
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:28,845
Speaker 5:  and it seems like an insane person. 'cause I'll send like three

792
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,245
Speaker 5:  paragraphs oh

793
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:30,925
Speaker 8:  My god, of text

794
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:34,205
Speaker 5:  Like to somebody just because I'm like, I've just been talking for like two

795
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:36,005
Speaker 5:  minutes straight. I don't wanna type up,

796
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:40,005
Speaker 6:  I'm saying try voice memos next. Like Mia turned me onto

797
00:49:40,005 --> 00:49:43,365
Speaker 6:  voice memos and now sometimes I'm like, I ain't typing this show. I just

798
00:49:43,365 --> 00:49:45,045
Speaker 6:  send like a two minute message. If

799
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:48,405
Speaker 5:  I got a voice memo from somebody, I would feel like that was a threat I would

800
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:49,765
Speaker 5:  like, it's what did I do?

801
00:49:50,225 --> 00:49:53,045
Speaker 8:  I'm like, I gotta put in earbuds now to to no,

802
00:49:53,475 --> 00:49:57,005
Speaker 6:  Usually there's like a text, there's usually a transcript too in case you

803
00:49:57,005 --> 00:50:00,765
Speaker 6:  can't like actually play it. But I don't know, I I've been, I, I had those

804
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:04,485
Speaker 6:  thoughts and now I'm on that. Now I'm on the voice

805
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:08,445
Speaker 6:  memo train. But also with, with this new Gemini

806
00:50:08,445 --> 00:50:11,005
Speaker 6:  on the wrist thing, you can raise to talk

807
00:50:11,465 --> 00:50:12,645
Speaker 8:  And I'm into that talk to

808
00:50:12,645 --> 00:50:16,405
Speaker 6:  The thing. But it, it was interesting because you know, oh, I think a lot

809
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:19,845
Speaker 6:  of the people I were talking to were saying like, oh God, another gesture

810
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:21,685
Speaker 6:  that you have to do unnaturally. Like,

811
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:27,085
Speaker 6:  and actually it's a lot more subtle. Like if you do that, it won't

812
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:29,605
Speaker 6:  actually bring up Gemini just

813
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:31,525
Speaker 5:  Like, like raise your wrist up to your,

814
00:50:31,835 --> 00:50:35,365
Speaker 6:  Like if you do it to like, if you're like a power ranger when you're doing

815
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,845
Speaker 6:  the move. Yeah, yeah. And like you're trying to talk into your wrist communicator.

816
00:50:37,845 --> 00:50:40,645
Speaker 6:  It's not gonna do it. So you have to do it like, just like naturally and

817
00:50:40,645 --> 00:50:44,325
Speaker 6:  it'll do it. And I was like, oh that's interesting that,

818
00:50:44,465 --> 00:50:48,285
Speaker 6:  you know, 'cause there's a lot of movement that happens with hands, especially

819
00:50:48,285 --> 00:50:51,685
Speaker 6:  if you're like me and you're just doing hand gestures all the time. So having

820
00:50:51,705 --> 00:50:55,085
Speaker 6:  to find out when people are actually wanting to talk to Gemini was a lot

821
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,965
Speaker 6:  of work that they put into it that I was surprised to find was actually

822
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:02,285
Speaker 6:  like, oh, I don't have to do a crazy exaggerated moment

823
00:51:02,845 --> 00:51:05,965
Speaker 6:  because I'm so used to after 10 years of testing wearables, doing things

824
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:09,525
Speaker 6:  like flick pinch and like moving like I'm a power ranger

825
00:51:09,845 --> 00:51:11,125
Speaker 6:  because of how

826
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:16,125
Speaker 6:  wonky these gestures have been over time. And that one was just one where

827
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:19,805
Speaker 6:  it was actually quite fluid And I was like, oh that's surprisingly good.

828
00:51:20,105 --> 00:51:23,605
Speaker 5:  So the, the other big thing here, And I couldn't quite figure this out,

829
00:51:24,065 --> 00:51:27,925
Speaker 5:  it, there's this Fitbit AI health coach, which is the other like big

830
00:51:27,925 --> 00:51:31,405
Speaker 5:  part of this announcement. It's huge. And I guess I'm curious like is that

831
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:34,965
Speaker 5:  the Pixel Watch feature or is that just like these two teams are? That's

832
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:36,925
Speaker 5:  all. Okay, so this is all, all Fit fits, fits

833
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:41,125
Speaker 6:  And Pixel watches. So it's not gate kept to the Pixel Watch four. It

834
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:45,045
Speaker 6:  is all Pixel watches and all Fitbits will get this Fitbit AI coach

835
00:51:45,715 --> 00:51:49,485
Speaker 6:  when it rolls out in October though, you have to be a Fitbit premium member

836
00:51:50,305 --> 00:51:53,805
Speaker 6:  in order to, they are gatekeeping it because, well, you know, AI is

837
00:51:53,805 --> 00:51:57,165
Speaker 6:  expensive to run and this health coach

838
00:51:57,585 --> 00:52:01,485
Speaker 6:  is, so my caveat is, is that I've tested a lot of

839
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:05,565
Speaker 6:  AI health coaches and a lot of AI health and fitness features. I have

840
00:52:05,785 --> 00:52:09,685
Speaker 6:  yet to like a single one. And I walked into this demo

841
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:13,045
Speaker 6:  being like, this, this better be good buddy.

842
00:52:13,475 --> 00:52:17,325
Speaker 6:  Like this better be some like, here we go again.

843
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:21,285
Speaker 6:  Friend And I walked out like cautiously, I won't say optimistic,

844
00:52:21,345 --> 00:52:25,285
Speaker 6:  but curious about it. Like they felt, it felt very thoughtful.

845
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:30,765
Speaker 6:  The Fitbit app is gonna get a complete, it's gonna get blown

846
00:52:30,785 --> 00:52:34,285
Speaker 6:  up completely and completely redesigned. There's a dark mode coming for all

847
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:38,245
Speaker 6:  the Fitbit people who've been wanting it for a long time. But generally

848
00:52:38,485 --> 00:52:42,285
Speaker 6:  speaking, this AI coach is going to be built into every

849
00:52:42,545 --> 00:52:46,245
Speaker 6:  single nook, cranny, and corner of the Fitbit app.

850
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:50,365
Speaker 6:  And you're gonna be able to talk to it to give like

851
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:52,285
Speaker 6:  insights. And you know, I asked

852
00:52:53,835 --> 00:52:54,325
Speaker 6:  Sandeep

853
00:52:56,345 --> 00:53:00,165
Speaker 6:  and Sandeek whatchamacallit, Andy Abramson and

854
00:53:00,485 --> 00:53:04,165
Speaker 6:  Rishi Chandra. Like this was a, this was like a table of very like skeptical

855
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:08,005
Speaker 6:  journalists grilling these dudes. Just like, you know,

856
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,125
Speaker 6:  I, I went out And I said, you know, these have been capped in obvious level

857
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:14,925
Speaker 6:  summaries. Just saying like, you did a workout. Thanks. Like I,

858
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:18,245
Speaker 6:  I can see that in my metrics. So like how are you gonna be different about

859
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:21,845
Speaker 6:  it? And the answers I got were pretty

860
00:53:21,895 --> 00:53:25,765
Speaker 6:  thoughtful. Like just, you know, it is going to reference your weekly

861
00:53:25,765 --> 00:53:29,605
Speaker 6:  patterns versus your daily patterns, but you can ask it about your

862
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:33,045
Speaker 6:  long-term patterns. 'cause one of the things was I asked Aura, like, Hey,

863
00:53:33,305 --> 00:53:37,165
Speaker 6:  what's my average hours of sleep for this year?

864
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:40,005
Speaker 6:  And it would be like, girl, we can't do more than a month. And I was like,

865
00:53:40,105 --> 00:53:43,565
Speaker 6:  you're useless. That's not helpful. That's not helpful. Why do I have five

866
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:46,285
Speaker 6:  years of Aura data if you can only do a month's worth? And they're like,

867
00:53:46,285 --> 00:53:50,205
Speaker 6:  no, you'll be able to do that with this. It is chatty. I saw the chat

868
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:50,565
Speaker 6:  logs.

869
00:53:50,805 --> 00:53:53,925
Speaker 5:  I thought, I thought this was so, so interesting. Yeah. And you asked them

870
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:56,845
Speaker 5:  about this, you're like, yeah, bro, why is in this shorter? Yeah. And they,

871
00:53:56,845 --> 00:53:58,605
Speaker 5:  they were like, we tested and people didn't like it. Yeah.

872
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:02,005
Speaker 6:  And they were like, well, we tested it to be shorter, but if you have an

873
00:54:02,045 --> 00:54:05,925
Speaker 6:  LLM do it in three sentences, you don't get anything useful

874
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:09,765
Speaker 6:  from that. 'cause it's just summering summarizing it so that it's so generalized

875
00:54:09,825 --> 00:54:13,405
Speaker 6:  as to be useless. And I was like, huh. Interesting.

876
00:54:13,705 --> 00:54:17,325
Speaker 6:  So they are right now going for like pretty in depth, like

877
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:21,165
Speaker 6:  really long things. And then the idea is for it to be

878
00:54:21,165 --> 00:54:25,125
Speaker 6:  conversational and adjust. So like

879
00:54:25,155 --> 00:54:28,885
Speaker 6:  I've had problems where I get injured or it's really hot outside

880
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:32,925
Speaker 6:  And I have a tendency to be a Type A

881
00:54:32,925 --> 00:54:36,285
Speaker 6:  overachiever and push through the pain, which is not good for you when you're

882
00:54:36,285 --> 00:54:40,125
Speaker 6:  exercising. I've gotten injured a lot over the last few years doing

883
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:43,885
Speaker 6:  that. And so now you can go talk to this AI and be like, Hey,

884
00:54:44,005 --> 00:54:47,925
Speaker 6:  I tweaked my knee. I can't really do this exercise

885
00:54:47,925 --> 00:54:50,965
Speaker 6:  program that you've done for me. And I'll be like, okay, cool. Let's adjust

886
00:54:50,965 --> 00:54:54,045
Speaker 6:  it and it'll adjust it for you. Which is sort of like the first time that

887
00:54:54,045 --> 00:54:55,085
Speaker 6:  we're actually seeing

888
00:54:56,825 --> 00:55:00,325
Speaker 6:  moving from just a static summary to going like, cool

889
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:03,525
Speaker 6:  information. Thanks for, for giving it to me. Let me adjust that for you

890
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:07,205
Speaker 6:  and I'll check in with you a week later to see if you're ready to get back

891
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:10,925
Speaker 6:  to your regular routine. Which is like, that's what we've been asking for

892
00:55:10,955 --> 00:55:11,365
Speaker 6:  kind of.

893
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:15,405
Speaker 5:  Right. It feels like everything else has just been, we're not gonna

894
00:55:15,405 --> 00:55:18,685
Speaker 5:  change the existing app. We're not gonna add any new features. But like,

895
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:21,645
Speaker 5:  hey, here's some ai like, it, it will just summarize. We can already tell

896
00:55:21,645 --> 00:55:21,965
Speaker 5:  you. Yeah.

897
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:22,805
Speaker 6:  It's like bolted on.

898
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:27,005
Speaker 5:  And this feels like they're taking, or at least they're, they're trying to

899
00:55:27,005 --> 00:55:30,685
Speaker 5:  take the maximalist approach, which is like, we're gonna plug all of your

900
00:55:30,685 --> 00:55:34,125
Speaker 5:  data in and we're gonna give you an essay back. Yes. And

901
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,765
Speaker 5:  the whether it works, that's an open question

902
00:55:37,815 --> 00:55:38,685
Speaker 6:  We're we're gonna see.

903
00:55:38,825 --> 00:55:42,765
Speaker 5:  But, But that is, that is like the step that needs to happen. Right? If

904
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:46,605
Speaker 5:  you want actually good results from the ai, if you want the

905
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:49,165
Speaker 5:  AI to actually be useful, it needs to have all your data.

906
00:55:49,385 --> 00:55:53,165
Speaker 6:  And that's, that's the, the, the kind of part that I'm somewhat like

907
00:55:53,805 --> 00:55:57,445
Speaker 6:  Hmm. About, you know, because you gotta hoover in a lot.

908
00:55:57,595 --> 00:55:59,245
Speaker 5:  What about handing over your health data?

909
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:03,125
Speaker 6:  A lot of your health data? And the thing, the thing that they've pointed

910
00:56:03,185 --> 00:56:05,765
Speaker 6:  out to me is that when Google acquired Fitbit

911
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:10,615
Speaker 6:  regulatorily for that sale to go through, they had to agree to the EU to

912
00:56:10,615 --> 00:56:14,575
Speaker 6:  keep all of the Fitbit data siloed out of the Google data because it

913
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:18,415
Speaker 6:  was health data. So they are actually obligated to

914
00:56:18,415 --> 00:56:22,215
Speaker 6:  keep those data silos separate. Doesn't mean people trust it doesn't mean

915
00:56:22,235 --> 00:56:26,085
Speaker 6:  you should trust it if you are, if you're like a maximalist

916
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:30,045
Speaker 6:  about data privacy, security. But it is like a lot of data that

917
00:56:30,045 --> 00:56:33,445
Speaker 6:  they're gonna be asking for. And the they're, they're starting out with fitness

918
00:56:33,785 --> 00:56:37,515
Speaker 6:  and sleep. They have ambitions for it to be everything.

919
00:56:38,355 --> 00:56:41,795
Speaker 8:  I was gonna ask if you think there's like a play with the journal app

920
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,875
Speaker 8:  that we saw on the phones. I, but if there's like

921
00:56:46,055 --> 00:56:49,875
Speaker 8:  no crossover, I think, I know you have some I think so some feelings about

922
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:50,595
Speaker 8:  the journal app.

923
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,955
Speaker 6:  I don't think AI should be in journals. I don't. I the

924
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:57,955
Speaker 6:  don't keep the, the AI out of journals you're

925
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:02,475
Speaker 6:  journaling is not complicated and it's not supposed to be easy. This is,

926
00:57:02,475 --> 00:57:04,355
Speaker 6:  we keep the AI out of the journals.

927
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:08,395
Speaker 5:  We Yeah, we didn't, we didn't touch on this up top, but for, for some

928
00:57:08,865 --> 00:57:12,715
Speaker 5:  confusing reason, one of the new Pixel features is a

929
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:16,035
Speaker 5:  journal app. Yes. It's a journal app with some, with AI prompts.

930
00:57:16,705 --> 00:57:20,635
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So you'll write journal entries in this AI app

931
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:21,035
Speaker 6:  and

932
00:57:22,685 --> 00:57:26,275
Speaker 6:  it'll prompt you based on what you've written before for new prompts. So

933
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:29,755
Speaker 6:  it's just like, Hey, why don't you write about your feelings for a test that's

934
00:57:29,755 --> 00:57:32,795
Speaker 6:  coming up next week. And then, you know, you'll write and you can read summaries

935
00:57:32,795 --> 00:57:36,715
Speaker 6:  of the entries that you've written and there's a little calendar and it it's

936
00:57:36,735 --> 00:57:40,595
Speaker 6:  little emoji. Yeah. Summarizing your emotions.

937
00:57:40,735 --> 00:57:42,275
Speaker 6:  You get like a re based what you've written.

938
00:57:42,665 --> 00:57:46,555
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's like a smiley face or just kind of like, huh, you didn't have

939
00:57:46,595 --> 00:57:47,515
Speaker 8:  a smiley face date.

940
00:57:48,075 --> 00:57:51,155
Speaker 5:  I feel like you shouldn't be able to lose at journaling. That feels like

941
00:57:51,155 --> 00:57:52,955
Speaker 5:  it is antithetical to like, it's

942
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:53,915
Speaker 6:  Supposed to. Like there's

943
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,915
Speaker 8:  Of streaks too. Yeah.

944
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:59,635
Speaker 6:  It, it's, it's, I I saw that And I was just like,

945
00:58:01,035 --> 00:58:04,195
Speaker 6:  I think you should have a hard time with a blank page. 'cause that is the

946
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:08,155
Speaker 6:  point of journaling. But yeah, no, I am with you Allison on

947
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:11,835
Speaker 6:  that conspiracy theory about like linking those two things

948
00:58:11,975 --> 00:58:15,715
Speaker 6:  for, 'cause they do have ambitions beyond just fitness and sleep. Yeah. Those

949
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:19,675
Speaker 6:  are just like the natural easy on ramps for this kind

950
00:58:19,675 --> 00:58:23,195
Speaker 6:  of AI health coach feature. But they do wanna get into

951
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:26,475
Speaker 6:  nutrition. They do wanna get into like, overall health

952
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:30,955
Speaker 6:  advising And I was just like, let's, let's run it up on the line

953
00:58:30,955 --> 00:58:34,595
Speaker 6:  of medical tech and wellness, a line that I've written about and is getting

954
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:38,555
Speaker 6:  increasingly blurrier to my internal fear and horror.

955
00:58:39,335 --> 00:58:42,355
Speaker 6:  So there's, there's a lot there that I'm just like,

956
00:58:43,975 --> 00:58:44,195
Speaker 8:  Ah,

957
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:47,235
Speaker 6:  Ah,

958
00:58:47,785 --> 00:58:48,555
Speaker 5:  It's all colliding

959
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:50,275
Speaker 8:  Sums it all up. Yeah, it

960
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:53,955
Speaker 6:  It, it is, but it's the greater point. The the big issue with

961
00:58:53,955 --> 00:58:56,795
Speaker 6:  wearables is that it generates this boatload of data

962
00:58:57,735 --> 00:59:00,515
Speaker 6:  and the average person is just like, okay, cool. I don't know what to do

963
00:59:00,515 --> 00:59:03,995
Speaker 6:  with this like mountain of metrics that you've given me. And so the problem

964
00:59:03,995 --> 00:59:07,675
Speaker 6:  they're trying to solve here is giving you useful actionable context if you're

965
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:11,235
Speaker 6:  trying to lose some weight, get healthier,

966
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:14,955
Speaker 6:  be able to run a marathon, like just whatever your goals are, just having,

967
00:59:15,655 --> 00:59:19,635
Speaker 6:  you know, the, the phrasing and the framing they used is like Steph

968
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:23,605
Speaker 6:  Curry who is actually partnering on this thing and

969
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:26,965
Speaker 6:  giving feedback and his team is like going like, yeah, you should do this.

970
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:30,405
Speaker 6:  Not so they're like actually partnering on this particular feature together.

971
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:34,645
Speaker 6:  But Steph Curry has a whole team of people helping him parse his

972
00:59:35,765 --> 00:59:39,285
Speaker 6:  athletic and health data. What if we democratize that with

973
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:40,205
Speaker 6:  AI for you?

974
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:45,485
Speaker 5:  I, I mean listen, I would love if Steph Curry's people gave me some notes,

975
00:59:45,965 --> 00:59:49,805
Speaker 5:  that would be great. I feel like we're not getting notes at that level

976
00:59:50,325 --> 00:59:51,845
Speaker 5:  from, from the Fitbit app.

977
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:55,445
Speaker 6:  At least not at first that that's their goal. Whether they can get there

978
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:59,525
Speaker 6:  is a totally different story, But that, that is their kind of

979
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:02,765
Speaker 6:  like roadmap for that particular feature. And to be fair,

980
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:07,085
Speaker 6:  it's one that's Garmin's pursuing Apple has Workout Buddy,

981
01:00:07,335 --> 01:00:10,485
Speaker 6:  which is like nowhere near this level of ambition because

982
01:00:11,095 --> 01:00:14,165
Speaker 6:  where, where's the new improved series? You kind of need that for that to

983
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:18,125
Speaker 6:  happen. But I do think they're thinking about that as well. I

984
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:21,885
Speaker 6:  think all of these companies are thinking down this route. This is just the

985
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:25,805
Speaker 6:  most ambitions And I think thoughtful implementation that I've

986
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:29,405
Speaker 6:  seen as to something that actually tells you something and

987
01:00:29,535 --> 01:00:32,285
Speaker 6:  isn't just a stapled on summary regurgitated book report.

988
01:00:32,825 --> 01:00:36,445
Speaker 5:  No, I think you're right. And And I think between the Fitbit changes that

989
01:00:36,445 --> 01:00:40,245
Speaker 5:  are coming in October, between that and the Pixel Watch four

990
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:44,125
Speaker 5:  updates, like there's a pretty opinionated series of products here And

991
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:47,845
Speaker 5:  I think the last piece of this that we saw is some of the

992
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:50,765
Speaker 5:  hardware changes and the one we didn't talk about yet is the repairability

993
01:00:50,765 --> 01:00:54,605
Speaker 5:  coming to the watch, which is sort of like a total surprise curve

994
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:55,085
Speaker 5:  ball here.

995
01:00:55,425 --> 01:00:59,405
Speaker 6:  Yes. 'cause The Verge has done some real stress

996
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:03,285
Speaker 6:  testing. We are apparently famous within that product team

997
01:01:03,345 --> 01:01:06,885
Speaker 6:  for destroying two screens of the first two Pixel watches.

998
01:01:07,395 --> 01:01:09,565
Speaker 6:  Both unintentionally, we dunno how it happened.

999
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:13,525
Speaker 5:  Listen, listen, it's not on us. And we didn't know. I don't, I don't think,

1000
01:01:13,585 --> 01:01:13,885
Speaker 5:  you know,

1001
01:01:14,165 --> 01:01:17,405
Speaker 6:  I am, I like, I've had some people go those things broke. Like I've had some

1002
01:01:17,405 --> 01:01:21,365
Speaker 6:  people in my Pixel two watch review. Like there is no way You don't

1003
01:01:21,365 --> 01:01:25,125
Speaker 6:  know how this happened. I am telling you on the record right now, I cooperated

1004
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:28,685
Speaker 6:  with every step of Google's investigation into how it happened and we were

1005
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,445
Speaker 6:  all baffled, like just completely baffled. I was like, I don't know,

1006
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:32,685
Speaker 6:  this

1007
01:01:32,685 --> 01:01:34,325
Speaker 5:  Sounds like agents like swarmed your house,

1008
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:37,325
Speaker 6:  Try. Yeah. It sounds like they arrested you. Oh, oh no, they came in person

1009
01:01:37,385 --> 01:01:40,365
Speaker 6:  and they were like, we're gonna take this and do, do some tests on it. And

1010
01:01:40,365 --> 01:01:41,245
Speaker 6:  I was just like, please pass

1011
01:01:41,245 --> 01:01:41,765
Speaker 5:  The polygraph.

1012
01:01:42,195 --> 01:01:45,125
Speaker 6:  He's still here. I was like, please tell me there's like conspiracy theories

1013
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:49,085
Speaker 6:  that my cat did it. I he was a baby. I don't think he could have done it.

1014
01:01:49,465 --> 01:01:51,885
Speaker 6:  He, listen, he didn't have teethers yet, so

1015
01:01:53,555 --> 01:01:57,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So apparently we are famous for having done that in,

1016
01:01:57,465 --> 01:02:00,805
Speaker 6:  in some capacity, but what I was told is that

1017
01:02:01,315 --> 01:02:05,205
Speaker 6:  they really want these devices to last a long time. So they want it to

1018
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:08,965
Speaker 6:  last a long time for people to have and repair. Making it

1019
01:02:08,965 --> 01:02:12,285
Speaker 6:  repairable was just one part of that. If you take the, the straps off and

1020
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:15,685
Speaker 6:  you look into the little lug his area, there's little screws. There's little

1021
01:02:15,685 --> 01:02:19,645
Speaker 6:  screws and you can unscrew it and if you take it off, it actually

1022
01:02:19,645 --> 01:02:23,525
Speaker 6:  kind of what they said is the insides have been redesigned to kind of look

1023
01:02:23,525 --> 01:02:25,245
Speaker 6:  like a bento box. So

1024
01:02:25,545 --> 01:02:28,445
Speaker 5:  It all comes through a circle. It all comes back full circle. Okay.

1025
01:02:28,555 --> 01:02:31,405
Speaker 6:  Alright. There's open the bento box from the event and they put it in the,

1026
01:02:31,405 --> 01:02:32,285
Speaker 6:  The Pixel, Pixel Watch,

1027
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:33,125
Speaker 8:  Put it in a watch,

1028
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:37,725
Speaker 5:  You open it up, there's a little update sheet inside it. It tells you what

1029
01:02:37,885 --> 01:02:38,365
Speaker 5:  features it has.

1030
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:42,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And yeah, so the idea is that the display and the

1031
01:02:42,285 --> 01:02:46,085
Speaker 6:  battery will be repairable and replaceable. So,

1032
01:02:46,615 --> 01:02:48,205
Speaker 5:  Which is really impressive for a watch,

1033
01:02:48,615 --> 01:02:52,205
Speaker 6:  Especially one where people were just like breaking the screens left and

1034
01:02:52,205 --> 01:02:53,085
Speaker 6:  right. That is one of the,

1035
01:02:53,355 --> 01:02:57,085
Speaker 5:  When you say people, the other than us, pretty, pretty, pretty

1036
01:02:57,325 --> 01:02:57,565
Speaker 5:  specifically

1037
01:02:58,185 --> 01:03:01,845
Speaker 6:  Us, but also other, we didn't do it with the Pixel Watch three n Knock on

1038
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:03,365
Speaker 6:  wood, we're not gonna do it with our Pixel

1039
01:03:03,535 --> 01:03:04,605
Speaker 5:  Watch. I mean, try us.

1040
01:03:05,185 --> 01:03:09,085
Speaker 8:  Oh, can I, can I say my favorite watch feature this year? Yes.

1041
01:03:09,425 --> 01:03:13,325
Speaker 8:  Is the new charger the new proprietary charger?

1042
01:03:13,505 --> 01:03:17,365
Speaker 8:  Yes. Which I know you're all annoyed by it. The watch goes

1043
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:21,205
Speaker 8:  on it like it's sleeping on a pillow. It looks like it,

1044
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:25,165
Speaker 8:  it's like it charges on its side and it just looks like it's

1045
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:28,285
Speaker 8:  sleepy and it's taking a little rest once you

1046
01:03:28,285 --> 01:03:31,405
Speaker 6:  Said that, And I put it in all my hands on And I'm pretty sure I credited

1047
01:03:31,405 --> 01:03:35,365
Speaker 6:  you and at least most of my mentions of it across the thing. But I

1048
01:03:35,365 --> 01:03:38,165
Speaker 6:  was just like, once I, once she said it, I couldn't unsee it And I was like,

1049
01:03:38,165 --> 01:03:38,645
Speaker 6:  that's so cute.

1050
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:41,325
Speaker 8:  It's just a tired little gadget. I'm so

1051
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:41,565
Speaker 6:  Tired.

1052
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:45,045
Speaker 8:  I'm, I'm sorry. You need like another watch charger

1053
01:03:45,395 --> 01:03:48,965
Speaker 6:  That is really annoying. This is the third proprietary charger in four watches.

1054
01:03:49,905 --> 01:03:53,525
Speaker 6:  So that's not ideal from an e-waste perspective,

1055
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:54,085
Speaker 6:  it's kind of

1056
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:54,925
Speaker 8:  Progressive. It's, yeah,

1057
01:03:55,195 --> 01:03:59,165
Speaker 6:  It's, it's just like, guys come on. But I actually like

1058
01:03:59,165 --> 01:03:59,285
Speaker 6:  it.

1059
01:03:59,745 --> 01:04:02,285
Speaker 5:  No, that makes sense though too. Especially if like, you're putting that

1060
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:05,485
Speaker 5:  up beside your bed at night. If now you've gotta look locked. It's, no, it's

1061
01:04:05,485 --> 01:04:09,285
Speaker 5:  all right. There's something there. I see it. On the topic of Repairability

1062
01:04:09,285 --> 01:04:13,205
Speaker 5:  that was on the only repairable gadget they announced the

1063
01:04:13,205 --> 01:04:16,245
Speaker 5:  other new piece of hardware, I think the final new piece of hardware

1064
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:21,045
Speaker 5:  Pixel Buds two A. Yes. Which, what's

1065
01:04:21,045 --> 01:04:23,365
Speaker 5:  repairable here? It's, it's they, can you replace the battery

1066
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:26,645
Speaker 6:  On that? Yeah. So there's the, the case and there's the little insert inside

1067
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:29,165
Speaker 6:  the case. You can pop that out and replace the battery.

1068
01:04:29,475 --> 01:04:32,525
Speaker 5:  Okay. Okay. Yeah. So it's the battery in the case, not in the buds, which

1069
01:04:32,525 --> 01:04:33,485
Speaker 5:  would be kind of Yeah,

1070
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:36,525
Speaker 6:  That's intense. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's the case battery that you can just

1071
01:04:37,065 --> 01:04:40,405
Speaker 6:  pop it out, replace it. That's, that's pretty cool. They

1072
01:04:41,415 --> 01:04:45,325
Speaker 6:  added, so here's another thing. There's like a big thesis with all of

1073
01:04:45,325 --> 01:04:49,125
Speaker 6:  these devices and it, the thesis is Gemini and AI basically

1074
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:53,085
Speaker 6:  because these budget buds got the tensor chip

1075
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,595
Speaker 6:  and why would they have a tensor chip?

1076
01:04:55,815 --> 01:04:56,515
Speaker 5:  Why not? Why not

1077
01:04:56,535 --> 01:05:00,515
Speaker 6:  Future AI baby? Like that's just like, you can just

1078
01:05:00,515 --> 01:05:03,965
Speaker 6:  see that they're going like, we're gonna need i

1079
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:05,325
Speaker 6:  everything to have AI in it.

1080
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:09,125
Speaker 5:  Sometimes I I think you're people are

1081
01:05:09,195 --> 01:05:12,725
Speaker 5:  genuinely like, we're doing this because we think it's gonna be cool. We

1082
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:16,445
Speaker 5:  think people are gonna like it. And sometimes I think people are like, my

1083
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:20,285
Speaker 5:  boss really wants us to say ai. Yeah. And that's what that feels like.

1084
01:05:20,285 --> 01:05:23,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I feel like someone's like, they're, they're gonna love it. They're

1085
01:05:23,845 --> 01:05:27,565
Speaker 5:  gonna like, I'm gonna get a promotion if I, if I put Gemini like on this

1086
01:05:27,905 --> 01:05:31,645
Speaker 5:  box five times and like what,

1087
01:05:31,715 --> 01:05:34,565
Speaker 5:  like, you, you could already talk to Google on these. Like, what, what, what,

1088
01:05:34,715 --> 01:05:38,085
Speaker 5:  what do I need these Pixel Buds two A to Gemini for me?

1089
01:05:38,525 --> 01:05:41,805
Speaker 6:  I, you know, I think they're just kind of future proofing for down the, down

1090
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:45,605
Speaker 6:  the road for whenever it is that they have like AI based

1091
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:49,765
Speaker 6:  sound audio features, you know? Yeah. Like, like, I mean

1092
01:05:50,035 --> 01:05:54,005
Speaker 6:  it's interesting because the original a series buds where like

1093
01:05:54,045 --> 01:05:57,725
Speaker 6:  $99, they were the kind of, you know, cheaper version.

1094
01:05:58,185 --> 01:06:02,125
Speaker 6:  Now they're 130, so they're $30 more expensive, but they also

1095
01:06:02,155 --> 01:06:05,885
Speaker 6:  have a NC and transparency mode, which they didn't have before.

1096
01:06:05,975 --> 01:06:08,885
Speaker 5:  Right. Noise cancellation is actually like a pretty meaningful upgrade here.

1097
01:06:08,885 --> 01:06:09,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's

1098
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:09,885
Speaker 6:  A pretty meaningful,

1099
01:06:09,995 --> 01:06:13,365
Speaker 5:  It's it's actually not, I was looking at the comparison page between the

1100
01:06:13,365 --> 01:06:16,565
Speaker 5:  Pixel Buds two A and the Pixel Buds two Pro.

1101
01:06:17,225 --> 01:06:21,005
Speaker 5:  And it's like, I, it feels sort of like Google is like searching

1102
01:06:21,065 --> 01:06:24,925
Speaker 5:  for places to, to make the two pro different, that like the

1103
01:06:24,925 --> 01:06:28,645
Speaker 5:  difference in the noise cancellation is that they're like the Pixel

1104
01:06:28,715 --> 01:06:32,685
Speaker 5:  Buds two Pro has active noise cancellation with, with

1105
01:06:32,915 --> 01:06:36,885
Speaker 5:  Live Seal 2.0 and the Pixel Buds two A is active

1106
01:06:36,885 --> 01:06:40,805
Speaker 5:  noise cancellation with Live Seal 1.5. And I'm like, what is, what is

1107
01:06:40,805 --> 01:06:43,965
Speaker 5:  Live Seal? I like, I don't know if I have the name right, but it's like you're

1108
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:47,245
Speaker 5:  searching here, you're searching for like, which is great. It's great if

1109
01:06:47,245 --> 01:06:50,845
Speaker 5:  the Pixel Buds two A are like getting closer to pro level

1110
01:06:51,205 --> 01:06:54,405
Speaker 5:  features. It does not have wireless charging in the case.

1111
01:06:54,905 --> 01:06:56,045
Speaker 6:  No, that was annoying. That

1112
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:59,125
Speaker 5:  Was, that's that was like, that's a rough one. I'm that's, yeah, once you're,

1113
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:02,205
Speaker 5:  once you're living that wireless charging lifestyle, it's hard to go back.

1114
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:06,365
Speaker 6:  It is. But it, it's funny because when it, Allison And I went to this content

1115
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:10,205
Speaker 6:  capture before the event, it, like, if you looked at

1116
01:07:10,205 --> 01:07:14,005
Speaker 6:  the displays, it was like phones, watches, and

1117
01:07:14,005 --> 01:07:17,845
Speaker 6:  in the corner right over there are The Pixel ones. We're like, where

1118
01:07:17,945 --> 01:07:20,885
Speaker 6:  are they? Where are The Pixel one? They're like, oh, they're in the corner.

1119
01:07:21,115 --> 01:07:23,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I like, and, and And I when I was like, so what's, what's new? And

1120
01:07:23,845 --> 01:07:27,645
Speaker 6:  they're like, oh, A and C and you can talk to Gemini on it. And like the

1121
01:07:27,645 --> 01:07:30,085
Speaker 6:  talking point was like, and you can talk to Gemini on it. And I was like,

1122
01:07:30,085 --> 01:07:33,085
Speaker 6:  couldn't you talk to Gemini on it before? And they're like, but you can talk

1123
01:07:33,085 --> 01:07:35,765
Speaker 6:  to Gemini, you can really talk to Gemini on it now.

1124
01:07:37,105 --> 01:07:41,085
Speaker 6:  It was like, okay, so, okay, so the ai ai is

1125
01:07:41,085 --> 01:07:41,365
Speaker 6:  the thing

1126
01:07:41,545 --> 01:07:45,365
Speaker 5:  And the, you know what, my big problem with literally all of Google's products,

1127
01:07:45,965 --> 01:07:49,285
Speaker 5:  I can't find a way to talk to Gemini, you know? Yeah. They make it so

1128
01:07:49,715 --> 01:07:50,005
Speaker 5:  hard

1129
01:07:50,745 --> 01:07:54,725
Speaker 6:  To access that data and they're like, you know, these, these, these devices,

1130
01:07:55,025 --> 01:07:59,005
Speaker 6:  unlike your phone, they live on you. And so these are the different

1131
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:03,045
Speaker 6:  pathways in which we can talk to ai, AI in your ear,

1132
01:08:03,465 --> 01:08:06,805
Speaker 6:  AI on your wrist, AI in your pocket. And I was like, oh my God.

1133
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:11,205
Speaker 6:  Okay, new, new meaning to ambient computing, which is

1134
01:08:11,705 --> 01:08:15,685
Speaker 6:  the whole thing that they were kind of talking about when

1135
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:18,765
Speaker 6:  they introduced The Pixel phone. So I guess this is what they

1136
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:22,645
Speaker 5:  Meant. And speaking of Gemini being literally everywhere,

1137
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:26,645
Speaker 5:  they, they did potentially, we think they teased one other

1138
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:30,285
Speaker 5:  product here, which is just in the middle of a

1139
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:34,325
Speaker 5:  video of where they were demoing some stuff. They kind

1140
01:08:34,325 --> 01:08:37,965
Speaker 5:  of just, like, there's a, there's a, a weird little gadget that looked like

1141
01:08:38,045 --> 01:08:41,845
Speaker 5:  a next Gen Nest hub Nest mini Google

1142
01:08:42,275 --> 01:08:46,205
Speaker 5:  Home Mini what it was, there was a little gray orb with

1143
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:50,005
Speaker 5:  like a blue ring around it that was, was talking to them with

1144
01:08:50,105 --> 01:08:53,525
Speaker 5:  Gemini and it looks like a new Nest smart speaker, which they, those things

1145
01:08:53,525 --> 01:08:56,885
Speaker 5:  haven't been updated in forever. Forever. And they announced also on Wednesday

1146
01:08:57,195 --> 01:09:01,005
Speaker 5:  that they're finally bringing Gemini to smart speakers in the home,

1147
01:09:01,565 --> 01:09:04,565
Speaker 5:  starting in October. But like, Alexa plus is gonna be like slow rollout.

1148
01:09:04,565 --> 01:09:08,125
Speaker 5:  So we'll see. We'll see. Have you guys tried using

1149
01:09:08,595 --> 01:09:10,485
Speaker 5:  like Google Assistant lately? Oh

1150
01:09:10,705 --> 01:09:14,125
Speaker 6:  Yes. It's in my home because

1151
01:09:14,665 --> 01:09:18,565
Speaker 6:  we had a Smart Home package last year And I was a first time homeowner,

1152
01:09:18,745 --> 01:09:22,605
Speaker 6:  so Jen Tuy like held my hand and walked me through my first

1153
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:26,205
Speaker 6:  smart home. Oh, amazing. And she decided that it was gonna be a nest in Google

1154
01:09:26,255 --> 01:09:29,965
Speaker 6:  Smart Home. So I talked to Google Assistant on the daily Oh. For my

1155
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:32,405
Speaker 6:  little broken Jan Smart home.

1156
01:09:32,675 --> 01:09:33,525
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Yeah.

1157
01:09:33,785 --> 01:09:36,085
Speaker 6:  You know what? It's so it breaks half the time.

1158
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:40,285
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's not great. We, our 4-year-old has learned how to

1159
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:44,325
Speaker 8:  get Google to say the weather and the way he just yells at it

1160
01:09:44,345 --> 01:09:48,285
Speaker 8:  is he is like, Google say, what's a weather today? So

1161
01:09:48,845 --> 01:09:50,605
Speaker 8:  I think he's using it as much as we are.

1162
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:55,085
Speaker 5:  He has gotten it to be more functional than I have. I I,

1163
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:59,485
Speaker 5:  this weekend I was like, Hey Google. What? Oh, I'm so sorry to literally

1164
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:03,325
Speaker 5:  every listen. Yes, but this weekend I was like, yo, what is the weight of

1165
01:10:03,385 --> 01:10:07,365
Speaker 5:  an iPad? Air seems, I feel like that's manageable. It was just

1166
01:10:07,365 --> 01:10:10,645
Speaker 5:  like, I don't know what a question is. I don't know what an iPad is. Like

1167
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:14,245
Speaker 5:  what do like it, it would like, it like had a meltdown. Oh no mine. It just

1168
01:10:14,245 --> 01:10:15,245
Speaker 5:  like, didn't know what to do with this.

1169
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:19,485
Speaker 6:  Mine is sexist because I will ask it to turn on the

1170
01:10:19,485 --> 01:10:23,005
Speaker 6:  kitchen lights or whatever and it'll listen and my spouse will do it and

1171
01:10:23,005 --> 01:10:26,805
Speaker 6:  it won't, it just does not register. And like we trained their

1172
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:28,645
Speaker 6:  voice on it too, so it's like rude.

1173
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:34,325
Speaker 6:  Interesting. Only listens to me. So they are just like, I don't know why

1174
01:10:34,325 --> 01:10:37,885
Speaker 6:  we gotta talk to this robot and I'm just gonna pull up the app and control

1175
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:41,485
Speaker 6:  it from, from the phone. So it it is, it's, yeah,

1176
01:10:41,635 --> 01:10:41,925
Speaker 6:  well

1177
01:10:41,925 --> 01:10:45,045
Speaker 5:  Get ready for October. 'cause they're gonna sell some new robots that will

1178
01:10:45,335 --> 01:10:49,005
Speaker 5:  maybe they, I I truly think they're like, we gotta be careful

1179
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:52,925
Speaker 5:  we can't put Gemini in 'cause we'll lose some Google Assistant features.

1180
01:10:52,925 --> 01:10:56,725
Speaker 5:  And I'm like, no, no. Like half broken Gemini cannot be worse

1181
01:10:56,725 --> 01:10:59,965
Speaker 5:  than this. Like, these things just do not function anymore.

1182
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:04,445
Speaker 6:  It's, it's, it's gotten really bad lately. I, I gotta agree with

1183
01:11:04,445 --> 01:11:07,845
Speaker 6:  you. And there'll be times where the, the wake word,

1184
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:09,965
Speaker 6:  I won't say it, but I'm sorry

1185
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:10,205
Speaker 5:  Again,

1186
01:11:10,585 --> 01:11:14,565
Speaker 6:  The wake word will just activate out of nowhere. I don't know what

1187
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:18,365
Speaker 6:  I'm like, am my, is my house haunted? Because it'll just like go bing, boom

1188
01:11:18,425 --> 01:11:22,285
Speaker 6:  ba and, and and oh, it'll say things. I've been on calls

1189
01:11:22,285 --> 01:11:26,245
Speaker 6:  with sources and it just acts up because I have a, a nest hub by my

1190
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:29,005
Speaker 6:  desk and to, to look at the doorbell and it's like, oh

1191
01:11:30,835 --> 01:11:34,165
Speaker 6:  cool. I just have a rogue smart speaker.

1192
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:39,275
Speaker 5:  Mine, mine. Every time I talk to my cat, mine's like, you're talking to me,

1193
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:40,355
Speaker 5:  right? I'm like, well,

1194
01:11:41,415 --> 01:11:42,275
Speaker 6:  Do they have similar names?

1195
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:43,355
Speaker 5:  I no,

1196
01:11:44,995 --> 01:11:45,115
Speaker 6:  I,

1197
01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:49,555
Speaker 5:  I'm looking forward to seeing any movement here on, on making

1198
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,875
Speaker 5:  these things more usable Again. I I think like we, we don't really know,

1199
01:11:53,415 --> 01:11:56,075
Speaker 5:  but yeah, I'm, I'm hoping that a lot of these features come to the older

1200
01:11:56,075 --> 01:11:59,075
Speaker 5:  ones just 'cause there's a huge install base there and that product is obviously

1201
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:03,235
Speaker 5:  not what it once was. Alright, we've got to take a break when we get back.

1202
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:07,035
Speaker 5:  The thunder round returns new. Improved, better than ever.

1203
01:12:07,535 --> 01:12:08,315
Speaker 5:  Get ready for it.

1204
01:14:27,275 --> 01:14:31,035
Speaker 5:  disposed of the lightning round. That thing is over. It's

1205
01:14:31,045 --> 01:14:34,115
Speaker 5:  stale. It's done with, they could never get to all the stories. So I have

1206
01:14:34,115 --> 01:14:37,395
Speaker 5:  given Eric Gomez our producer, the Power of Thunder to make sure that we

1207
01:14:37,395 --> 01:14:40,195
Speaker 5:  can get through all of the important stuff that we wanna talk about. We're

1208
01:14:40,195 --> 01:14:43,435
Speaker 5:  gonna do five stories, five minutes each when we're getting close to time.

1209
01:14:43,895 --> 01:14:47,675
Speaker 5:  Eric's gonna give us some rolling thunder that's playing us off. And if we

1210
01:14:47,675 --> 01:14:49,795
Speaker 5:  go too far, we will be struck down

1211
01:14:51,315 --> 01:14:54,615
Speaker 5:  by a sound that is, is related to

1212
01:14:54,845 --> 01:14:58,775
Speaker 5:  lightning but is distinctly not lightning because that is not part

1213
01:14:58,775 --> 01:15:02,135
Speaker 5:  of this new world. Again, we're working on it, we're working on

1214
01:15:02,555 --> 01:15:05,455
Speaker 5:  the intro, we're working on the segment. It's gonna get better each week.

1215
01:15:05,845 --> 01:15:08,175
Speaker 5:  Okay, first up the what have we got?

1216
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:12,575
Speaker 6:  We have beans. So Hank Green released

1217
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:16,455
Speaker 6:  this app called Focus Friend and it is kind

1218
01:15:16,455 --> 01:15:20,255
Speaker 6:  of a po Pomodoro timer. It is kind of a distraction

1219
01:15:20,325 --> 01:15:23,935
Speaker 6:  free situation. And our good friend Zach Brown

1220
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:28,095
Speaker 6:  wrote Hank Green's Focus Friends swapped my screen time for Bean Time

1221
01:15:28,515 --> 01:15:31,895
Speaker 6:  And I love this app so much. I downloaded it recently

1222
01:15:32,635 --> 01:15:36,455
Speaker 6:  and continuing my theme of using the brick for TV time.

1223
01:15:36,655 --> 01:15:40,375
Speaker 6:  I am using the Bean app for reading time

1224
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:45,215
Speaker 6:  and guys, I got through four books this week. How that is,

1225
01:15:45,405 --> 01:15:49,015
Speaker 6:  that is insane. What I got through four, four books this week. I've gotten

1226
01:15:49,015 --> 01:15:52,935
Speaker 6:  through seven books this month. Do you? It's amazing. Do you read a

1227
01:15:53,055 --> 01:15:57,015
Speaker 6:  physical book? Are you on a Kindle? I am on physical books. I'm on Kindles,

1228
01:15:57,075 --> 01:16:00,535
Speaker 6:  I'm on my phone. I'm on my gosh, audio books. I'm on like different

1229
01:16:01,045 --> 01:16:02,175
Speaker 6:  formats at all time. Are you,

1230
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:05,935
Speaker 5:  You doing audio and physical book like simultaneously? No. Like how

1231
01:16:05,935 --> 01:16:07,935
Speaker 6:  Else you through books? It all makes sense.

1232
01:16:07,965 --> 01:16:08,695
Speaker 5:  This is not happening.

1233
01:16:09,015 --> 01:16:10,495
Speaker 6:  I can't tell you read four books. So

1234
01:16:10,495 --> 01:16:12,135
Speaker 5:  That is not You're two Xing an audio book

1235
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:16,135
Speaker 6:  While you're reading. No, that's not what I'm doing. But so like the

1236
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:20,055
Speaker 6:  issue I I've had is just like being way too addicted to

1237
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:23,455
Speaker 6:  my phone. Like I think this is a universal problem at this point in time

1238
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:27,695
Speaker 6:  And I just, as soon as a notification comes up, I get into panic mode, like,

1239
01:16:27,695 --> 01:16:30,615
Speaker 6:  oh, I have to answer it immediately or someone's gonna hate me.

1240
01:16:31,515 --> 01:16:34,855
Speaker 6:  But no, I, I put the bean timer on the Focus Friend,

1241
01:16:35,475 --> 01:16:39,215
Speaker 6:  my Bean, you can name your bean. His name is B Bbo, my, my bean

1242
01:16:39,535 --> 01:16:43,455
Speaker 6:  name Bbo. And so bla bo the concept is that

1243
01:16:43,575 --> 01:16:46,175
Speaker 6:  bla bo is a radioactive beam that has been like

1244
01:16:47,095 --> 01:16:50,935
Speaker 6:  injected into your phone and he lives there now. And bla bo's great passion

1245
01:16:50,955 --> 01:16:54,935
Speaker 6:  in life is knitting, but Bbo can't knit if you're on your phone

1246
01:16:55,075 --> 01:16:59,055
Speaker 6:  and being distracted. So you put this little timer on and

1247
01:16:59,055 --> 01:17:02,975
Speaker 6:  then B bbo knits for the time that you are not on your

1248
01:17:02,975 --> 01:17:06,055
Speaker 6:  phone. And when B BBO is done, he has either knitted

1249
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:10,585
Speaker 6:  socks if you're on the free version like me or scarves if

1250
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:14,505
Speaker 6:  you choose to pay or whatnot. And then depending on the amount

1251
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:18,465
Speaker 6:  of socks or scarves that B lvo or your bean, whatever you wanna name,

1252
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:20,505
Speaker 6:  it has knitted. You can decorate his little

1253
01:17:20,505 --> 01:17:23,945
Speaker 5:  Room. It's so nice. Oh my. It's all bean. I, I'm looking at the art and it's

1254
01:17:23,945 --> 01:17:27,825
Speaker 5:  like, it's so delightful. I should also say disclosure, Hank

1255
01:17:27,865 --> 01:17:31,785
Speaker 5:  Green is gonna cohost decoder next month, which also

1256
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:36,065
Speaker 5:  promo Hank Green is gonna cohost decoder next month. But this app is just

1257
01:17:36,065 --> 01:17:39,705
Speaker 5:  like, it, it feels, it has like animal crossing vibes where it's just like

1258
01:17:39,775 --> 01:17:42,425
Speaker 5:  kind of quaint and delightful and you just decorate stuff. Yeah.

1259
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:46,265
Speaker 6:  You, it's like animal crossing vibes mixed with a Pomodoro timer, which

1260
01:17:46,265 --> 01:17:49,425
Speaker 6:  if you don't know, a Pomodoro timer is based on like the little tomato kitchen

1261
01:17:49,525 --> 01:17:53,345
Speaker 6:  timers. You go for 25 minutes of focus time

1262
01:17:53,365 --> 01:17:55,945
Speaker 6:  on a single task, then you take a five minute break, you do that four times

1263
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:58,945
Speaker 6:  and then you get a 15 minute break. It's like a productivity thing. I use

1264
01:17:58,945 --> 01:18:02,505
Speaker 6:  it a lot. It helps me get started on projects I don't wanna do.

1265
01:18:03,965 --> 01:18:07,665
Speaker 6:  So that mix just really worked for my brain

1266
01:18:07,815 --> 01:18:10,865
Speaker 6:  with reading. And so every morning now

1267
01:18:11,695 --> 01:18:15,505
Speaker 6:  I've become a morning person through sheer force of effort because no one

1268
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:18,705
Speaker 6:  can interrupt your morning. They can always interrupt and derail your evening.

1269
01:18:19,045 --> 01:18:21,945
Speaker 6:  No one can interrupt your morning if you get up really early.

1270
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:24,145
Speaker 8:  My 4-year-old wants a word.

1271
01:18:24,725 --> 01:18:28,345
Speaker 6:  Ah, well I, it's true, but like, so my cat

1272
01:18:28,595 --> 01:18:32,585
Speaker 6:  loves cuddle time on the couch in the morning. Oh. So I put bbo the bean

1273
01:18:32,595 --> 01:18:34,345
Speaker 6:  timer on, I get the cat.

1274
01:18:34,725 --> 01:18:35,905
Speaker 8:  Oh my gosh. I open up

1275
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:39,665
Speaker 6:  A book and for, oh my gosh, 30 minutes to 45 minutes before work

1276
01:18:40,305 --> 01:18:41,705
Speaker 6:  I uninterrupted reading.

1277
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:42,865
Speaker 8:  That's so beautiful.

1278
01:18:43,445 --> 01:18:44,305
Speaker 6:  And that is how I got

1279
01:18:44,575 --> 01:18:48,145
Speaker 5:  Four books, books this week as the single most zen thing I've heard in months.

1280
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:48,905
Speaker 5:  Beautiful. I beautiful.

1281
01:18:49,065 --> 01:18:52,865
Speaker 8:  I have a question. What kinds of stuff can you decorate blower blows

1282
01:18:52,975 --> 01:18:53,545
Speaker 8:  room with?

1283
01:18:53,815 --> 01:18:57,265
Speaker 6:  There's so, you know, because I do it in such short time

1284
01:18:57,585 --> 01:19:01,505
Speaker 6:  intervals and BBO is not the fastest knitter, I've only

1285
01:19:01,505 --> 01:19:05,385
Speaker 6:  been able to buy a shelf, but you can buy a shelf. I think there's a

1286
01:19:05,385 --> 01:19:09,185
Speaker 6:  chair course had, there's a, it's 75 socks for a shelf,

1287
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:13,025
Speaker 6:  but oh dang. He just got a little pink shelf today. I'm very proud. BBO

1288
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:16,905
Speaker 6:  has a a a a shelf to, you know, and it's, it's, it's about the

1289
01:19:16,905 --> 01:19:20,345
Speaker 6:  process because every time I take time to read I'm helping

1290
01:19:20,765 --> 01:19:21,585
Speaker 6:  LBO and it socks.

1291
01:19:21,585 --> 01:19:25,465
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Can he put, can he eventually put stuff on the shelf? Is there like

1292
01:19:25,465 --> 01:19:26,705
Speaker 8:  little plants he can get?

1293
01:19:27,265 --> 01:19:31,225
Speaker 6:  I think so. Honestly, his sock. I, I need to read more so

1294
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:34,905
Speaker 6:  that PBO can have his little socks. Oh, okay. 'cause I'm not report back.

1295
01:19:34,915 --> 01:19:38,665
Speaker 6:  Sorry. Hank Green. I have limited funds. I'm not buying the pro version

1296
01:19:38,845 --> 01:19:39,625
Speaker 6:  for the scarves.

1297
01:19:40,105 --> 01:19:43,785
Speaker 5:  I So wait, what do you, what? Why do you get scarves? The scarves? What,

1298
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:44,105
Speaker 5:  what's,

1299
01:19:44,345 --> 01:19:48,225
Speaker 6:  I think scarves are a higher value in, I've seen knitters

1300
01:19:48,245 --> 01:19:52,225
Speaker 6:  get mad about this online uhuh 'cause they're like, socks should be higher

1301
01:19:52,315 --> 01:19:54,065
Speaker 6:  value than the scarves. And I was just like

1302
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:56,025
Speaker 5:  Either or two actual knitters

1303
01:19:56,345 --> 01:20:00,225
Speaker 6:  I have tried and absolutely not, I cannot do it. It's

1304
01:20:00,225 --> 01:20:03,545
Speaker 6:  just knit pearl. I can't do it. My friend is a great knitter, not me. But

1305
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:03,745
Speaker 6:  yeah,

1306
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:07,725
Speaker 5:  Hank Ian should, should know that he should, he should be more serious about

1307
01:20:07,825 --> 01:20:11,485
Speaker 5:  the relative value of the knitting that this beam does.

1308
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:15,765
Speaker 6:  I'm here for P lbo, I'm here for pl bo to knit socks while I read

1309
01:20:15,865 --> 01:20:19,485
Speaker 6:  and sit with a cat just purring on me every morning.

1310
01:20:19,715 --> 01:20:20,005
Speaker 6:  It's

1311
01:20:20,405 --> 01:20:23,845
Speaker 5:  Honestly, I'm here for B lbo. The scientific accuracy concerns me and I'll,

1312
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,125
Speaker 5:  I, okay. There's

1313
01:20:26,365 --> 01:20:29,725
Speaker 8:  A bean in your phone. There're worried about the value. There's

1314
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:32,925
Speaker 6:  A, there's a bean that lives in my phone who likes to

1315
01:20:33,085 --> 01:20:35,085
Speaker 5:  Knit. Listen, listen. The,

1316
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:39,325
Speaker 5:  okay, Allison, what have you got? Okay.

1317
01:20:39,675 --> 01:20:43,445
Speaker 8:  Okay, I'll go with the Ricoh GR

1318
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:47,645
Speaker 8:  four. We're going to the camera world got a price.

1319
01:20:48,185 --> 01:20:52,085
Speaker 8:  So it was announced earlier this year. This is a beloved

1320
01:20:53,035 --> 01:20:57,005
Speaker 8:  like camera nerds camera. It's been like

1321
01:20:57,065 --> 01:21:01,005
Speaker 8:  1 million years since they announced a new one. The

1322
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:04,925
Speaker 8:  GR three was 2019, so it's

1323
01:21:04,925 --> 01:21:07,445
Speaker 8:  been like coming and in the works this fall,

1324
01:21:08,635 --> 01:21:11,725
Speaker 8:  they announce the price and it is

1325
01:21:12,235 --> 01:21:13,645
Speaker 8:  $1,500.

1326
01:21:15,345 --> 01:21:18,645
Speaker 8:  The previous version was $900. So

1327
01:21:19,805 --> 01:21:23,285
Speaker 8:  that's a bummer and sort of

1328
01:21:23,665 --> 01:21:27,205
Speaker 8:  is giving me Sony RX one R

1329
01:21:27,455 --> 01:21:28,325
Speaker 8:  vibes. Where

1330
01:21:29,065 --> 01:21:30,205
Speaker 6:  Is this all tariffs?

1331
01:21:30,355 --> 01:21:32,485
Speaker 8:  What the hell? I I know. That's what I feel. It's

1332
01:21:32,485 --> 01:21:32,965
Speaker 5:  A little tariffs

1333
01:21:32,965 --> 01:21:36,925
Speaker 8:  Because I will, you know, the PS five went

1334
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:40,765
Speaker 8:  up in price this week, so it feels a little bit

1335
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:44,685
Speaker 8:  like maybe this is a tariff thing happening here. But yeah,

1336
01:21:44,685 --> 01:21:48,445
Speaker 8:  the arcs one are also not updated in

1337
01:21:48,515 --> 01:21:52,485
Speaker 8:  like a long time. 2015 was the last one.

1338
01:21:52,485 --> 01:21:56,285
Speaker 8:  And then that famously Sony just outta the blue was like, we're making a

1339
01:21:56,285 --> 01:21:58,765
Speaker 8:  new one and it's five grand.

1340
01:22:00,365 --> 01:22:03,725
Speaker 5:  I I had not like, heard much about the,

1341
01:22:04,145 --> 01:22:07,565
Speaker 5:  the GR three i, I like did not know that was a camera.

1342
01:22:08,205 --> 01:22:12,085
Speaker 5:  And then I think, you know, during the X 100 craze, it was

1343
01:22:12,085 --> 01:22:15,845
Speaker 5:  like the go-to comparison and it's, it's fascinating because

1344
01:22:15,865 --> 01:22:19,845
Speaker 5:  it really is like a, it's like a different take on

1345
01:22:19,845 --> 01:22:23,805
Speaker 5:  the same kind of idea where it is, it is an AP

1346
01:22:23,845 --> 01:22:27,645
Speaker 5:  PSC sensor. So you've got a big sensor in a compact camera,

1347
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:31,805
Speaker 5:  but it's even more compact. You can actually pocket this thing, well it

1348
01:22:31,805 --> 01:22:35,445
Speaker 5:  depends on your pocket, but like big pockets more so than the XX 100. Yeah.

1349
01:22:36,105 --> 01:22:39,405
Speaker 5:  But there's no viewfinder, which like is a bummer. It's like a different

1350
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:43,265
Speaker 5:  style of shooting. But you know, it's, it like if

1351
01:22:43,265 --> 01:22:47,185
Speaker 5:  you wanted a point and shoe that takes fantastic photos, like this is,

1352
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:50,985
Speaker 5:  this has really been the camera and at 1500 you're buying a

1353
01:22:51,055 --> 01:22:53,065
Speaker 5:  very, very different type of product.

1354
01:22:53,575 --> 01:22:57,465
Speaker 8:  Yeah, exactly. I feel like it's kind of flown under the radar a little

1355
01:22:57,465 --> 01:23:00,265
Speaker 8:  bit, especially in the, the shadow of the X 100.

1356
01:23:01,245 --> 01:23:05,165
Speaker 8:  But it, it is really like a camera person's camera where it's kind

1357
01:23:05,165 --> 01:23:09,125
Speaker 8:  of the one that, you know, back at deeper review would, would just be like

1358
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:12,805
Speaker 8:  talked about and like, oh yeah, the Ricoh gr is so nice. You know,

1359
01:23:12,985 --> 01:23:13,405
Speaker 8:  the camera

1360
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,885
Speaker 5:  People love the Ricos.

1361
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:18,565
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's, I it has that, that following. It's a smaller

1362
01:23:18,565 --> 01:23:20,565
Speaker 8:  following than the Fuji film. But

1363
01:23:20,675 --> 01:23:23,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think that's probably it though because like the Fuji film, I feel

1364
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:27,805
Speaker 5:  like the Fuji film is like, you're not a photographer but you, you kind of

1365
01:23:27,945 --> 01:23:31,765
Speaker 5:  aspire to be. And this is like, you spend your day lugging

1366
01:23:31,765 --> 01:23:35,685
Speaker 5:  around enormous lenses, fiddling with all kinds of dials and

1367
01:23:35,685 --> 01:23:39,525
Speaker 5:  you're like, thank goodness I can just like hit one button and take a good

1368
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:43,325
Speaker 5:  photo. Yeah. Like that. It's, it's bringing it all down to

1369
01:23:43,325 --> 01:23:46,925
Speaker 5:  like the size of something normal. Also. Interesting.

1370
01:23:47,835 --> 01:23:51,355
Speaker 5:  I think what, like a couple weeks ago, Fuji raised their prices.

1371
01:23:52,175 --> 01:23:52,395
Speaker 8:  Oh

1372
01:23:52,905 --> 01:23:55,355
Speaker 5:  That they, they experie is the same thing. Yeah. A couple weeks ago they

1373
01:23:55,355 --> 01:23:58,555
Speaker 5:  raised prices on some of their, one of their cameras went up $800.

1374
01:23:59,265 --> 01:24:02,395
Speaker 5:  This is absurd. Fortunately the, the the X

1375
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:06,075
Speaker 5:  106 went up merely $200.

1376
01:24:06,415 --> 01:24:10,275
Speaker 5:  So I think, I think it's at, ooh, was it's at 1700 now, maybe

1377
01:24:10,365 --> 01:24:11,475
Speaker 5:  800. 1800.

1378
01:24:11,855 --> 01:24:12,475
Speaker 8:  Can you buy one

1379
01:24:12,575 --> 01:24:15,355
Speaker 5:  Now? No, it's, it's 1800 now. I think they're like

1380
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:20,205
Speaker 5:  In stock ish. I I, I think like the last I checked on Reddit,

1381
01:24:20,205 --> 01:24:24,135
Speaker 5:  it's like, you're, you're not waiting so long anymore. Okay. If you, I

1382
01:24:24,135 --> 01:24:28,095
Speaker 5:  think I hundred so 1800. So it's that thing's still more expensive. And

1383
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:32,055
Speaker 5:  also, this is what's wild about Fuji that, so they, they

1384
01:24:32,055 --> 01:24:34,855
Speaker 5:  announced their price hike like two weeks ago and just this week they're

1385
01:24:34,855 --> 01:24:38,815
Speaker 5:  like, we're gonna have to raise our prices again. Oh my God. They're

1386
01:24:38,815 --> 01:24:41,695
Speaker 5:  gonna, so at the end of the month they're, they're like, we we're not, and

1387
01:24:41,695 --> 01:24:42,815
Speaker 5:  we're not selling you, but like,

1388
01:24:44,355 --> 01:24:47,935
Speaker 5:  buy it now. Buy it now. Like Right. These things, things are not going great

1389
01:24:48,035 --> 01:24:49,935
Speaker 5:  for the camera companies. Is this,

1390
01:24:50,045 --> 01:24:53,815
Speaker 6:  This is rough. Like, I mean, there's such uncertainty with the

1391
01:24:53,815 --> 01:24:57,455
Speaker 6:  tariffs, right. Because we never know if they're on or if they're off or

1392
01:24:57,455 --> 01:25:00,375
Speaker 6:  if they're fully on or off again. 'cause it's, you know,

1393
01:25:01,315 --> 01:25:05,015
Speaker 6:  we need a crystal ball for that. But when they do hit,

1394
01:25:05,575 --> 01:25:09,175
Speaker 6:  I really do feel like I'm being punched in the face. Like they,

1395
01:25:09,325 --> 01:25:13,095
Speaker 6:  this, this, these are significant price hikes. Like, I mean

1396
01:25:14,205 --> 01:25:18,015
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Right, right. The, the PS five went up 50 bucks this week.

1397
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:22,455
Speaker 8:  I feel very righteous because I bought mine a couple months

1398
01:25:22,515 --> 01:25:26,335
Speaker 8:  ago. I was like, we got it, we gotta get on this. Gotta lock. This is

1399
01:25:26,395 --> 01:25:29,535
Speaker 8:  is only going up. So save 50 bucks right there.

1400
01:25:30,265 --> 01:25:34,255
Speaker 5:  Every company just needs to be blaring tariff sale. It's our normal

1401
01:25:34,305 --> 01:25:36,695
Speaker 5:  price. We cannot promise it will last.

1402
01:25:36,885 --> 01:25:37,535
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I,

1403
01:25:39,365 --> 01:25:39,655
Speaker 6:  yeah,

1404
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:44,415
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm very excited to see how this camera has, has

1405
01:25:44,775 --> 01:25:48,335
Speaker 5:  improved because at this price, it's, it's a very different

1406
01:25:49,575 --> 01:25:53,335
Speaker 5:  prospect than it once was. Yeah. But I think particularly given the,

1407
01:25:53,475 --> 01:25:56,735
Speaker 5:  the, you know, craze around the X one hundreds

1408
01:25:57,655 --> 01:26:01,575
Speaker 5:  speaking as somebody who owns one, like I, I wanna see more competition in

1409
01:26:01,575 --> 01:26:05,525
Speaker 5:  this space. Yeah. We need to see more of these like a PSC, bigger

1410
01:26:05,675 --> 01:26:09,565
Speaker 5:  sensors coming into smaller cameras. It's great. I love

1411
01:26:09,565 --> 01:26:13,405
Speaker 5:  it. I wish it wasn't 1500 bucks. Same. Yeah. It's a lot. Whoa,

1412
01:26:13,405 --> 01:26:16,805
Speaker 6:  Whoa. Oh my god. Got it. That one got me. Nailed

1413
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:20,765
Speaker 5:  It. Okay. So Netflix is changing, and

1414
01:26:20,955 --> 01:26:24,085
Speaker 5:  this is, I think like we've talked about this a little bit in the past, but

1415
01:26:24,085 --> 01:26:26,565
Speaker 5:  they're sort of at the end of an era. I'm gonna paint like a little bit of

1416
01:26:26,565 --> 01:26:30,285
Speaker 5:  a picture here. Right. A lot of their biggest serious swim winding down.

1417
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:34,285
Speaker 5:  Right? We Squid game just wrapped up, what, two months

1418
01:26:34,305 --> 01:26:37,925
Speaker 5:  ago, the final season of Stranger Things about to hit and

1419
01:26:38,135 --> 01:26:41,805
Speaker 5:  we're starting to see this programming shift, right? So earlier

1420
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:45,585
Speaker 5:  this year they started bringing episodes of Miss

1421
01:26:45,585 --> 01:26:48,935
Speaker 5:  Rachel to the platform. Okay. Alright.

1422
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:53,575
Speaker 5:  They just announced that Mark Rober, one of the biggest YouTubers is getting

1423
01:26:53,615 --> 01:26:56,455
Speaker 5:  a Netflix series also this week.

1424
01:26:57,695 --> 01:27:01,635
Speaker 5:  The Duffer Brothers who make Stranger Things and who previously had a

1425
01:27:01,635 --> 01:27:04,835
Speaker 5:  big deal at Netflix to make a whole bunch of new shows and Stranger Things

1426
01:27:04,835 --> 01:27:08,715
Speaker 5:  spinoffs announced they're going to join Paramount in a couple years.

1427
01:27:09,695 --> 01:27:13,555
Speaker 5:  And so that to me tells me like their Headspace

1428
01:27:13,735 --> 01:27:17,675
Speaker 5:  is somewhere else. Right? Hmm. Netflix for the longest time, they

1429
01:27:17,955 --> 01:27:21,275
Speaker 5:  were like, had something to prove we're premium,

1430
01:27:21,735 --> 01:27:25,635
Speaker 5:  we can do great stuff. And now the Duffer brothers are like,

1431
01:27:25,635 --> 01:27:29,555
Speaker 5:  Hey, Paramount's gonna give us a big sack of cash. And they're

1432
01:27:29,555 --> 01:27:29,755
Speaker 5:  like,

1433
01:27:31,635 --> 01:27:31,995
Speaker 5:  Stranger, this

1434
01:27:31,995 --> 01:27:32,115
Speaker 6:  Is

1435
01:27:32,115 --> 01:27:32,875
Speaker 5:  Pretty good. But like, okay.

1436
01:27:33,925 --> 01:27:34,635
Speaker 6:  Right. Like

1437
01:27:35,755 --> 01:27:39,515
Speaker 5:  A, I I am curious like, are you seeing

1438
01:27:39,515 --> 01:27:43,035
Speaker 5:  this when you're watching Netflix? Like, what I feel like increasingly

1439
01:27:43,635 --> 01:27:47,475
Speaker 5:  I, like I subscribe for those big shows that

1440
01:27:47,475 --> 01:27:50,915
Speaker 5:  are basically wrapped up And I have not started a new Netflix series in a

1441
01:27:50,915 --> 01:27:51,115
Speaker 5:  while.

1442
01:27:51,935 --> 01:27:55,515
Speaker 6:  So the difference that I'm seeing is that Netflix

1443
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:59,675
Speaker 6:  is going hard on Korean stuff. Mm. Like they are

1444
01:28:00,035 --> 01:28:03,995
Speaker 6:  bringing so many KDRs over that I'm just like, shit, I

1445
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:07,955
Speaker 6:  can't cancel my Netflix subscription. Wow. Where am I gonna get my

1446
01:28:08,465 --> 01:28:12,195
Speaker 6:  KDRs from? And then, you know, then they had K-pop demon

1447
01:28:12,195 --> 01:28:15,955
Speaker 6:  hunters like explode. I, I don't think Netflix

1448
01:28:16,215 --> 01:28:20,035
Speaker 6:  was prepared for K-pop demon hunters and what a massive phenomenon that's

1449
01:28:20,035 --> 01:28:22,995
Speaker 6:  been. But I was like, maybe you should have like Squid games did

1450
01:28:23,775 --> 01:28:27,395
Speaker 6:  bongos for you. The Glory was huge on your, your platform as well.

1451
01:28:29,615 --> 01:28:32,875
Speaker 6:  And then, you know, K-pop demon Hunters is

1452
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:37,595
Speaker 6:  apparently destroying the, the, the billboard charts and the Han

1453
01:28:37,595 --> 01:28:41,355
Speaker 6:  moon has been sealed or whatever. So they, they apparently

1454
01:28:41,355 --> 01:28:45,315
Speaker 6:  greenlit two more K-Pop demon hunters movie, possibly a live action and

1455
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:47,755
Speaker 6:  possibly a series. Oh my God. Going on all of this. They

1456
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:48,915
Speaker 5:  Just pounced on that. They

1457
01:28:48,915 --> 01:28:52,795
Speaker 6:  Just, 'cause it's the first Netflix thing where the movie, the

1458
01:28:52,815 --> 01:28:56,155
Speaker 6:  the viewership has gone up over time. Wow. So they're like,

1459
01:28:56,585 --> 01:29:00,555
Speaker 6:  holy guacamole. What do you mean? It's, it's like, I still think

1460
01:29:00,555 --> 01:29:02,005
Speaker 6:  it's like the number one movie on Netflix

1461
01:29:02,055 --> 01:29:05,685
Speaker 5:  Right now keeps, this is really like the only Netflix movie that I've heard

1462
01:29:05,685 --> 01:29:09,365
Speaker 5:  people discuss after the movie came out. I feel like, I feel like everything

1463
01:29:09,365 --> 01:29:12,805
Speaker 5:  else you're like, did you see they're doing this? And then it's just done.

1464
01:29:13,205 --> 01:29:13,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1465
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:16,925
Speaker 6:  That's the extent of it. It's, yeah, this just keeps going.

1466
01:29:17,705 --> 01:29:21,365
Speaker 6:  And like Korea is all on k-pop demon hunters right now.

1467
01:29:21,365 --> 01:29:25,245
Speaker 6:  Samsung was just like, we're gonna get on this. And at Samsung Galaxy unpack,

1468
01:29:25,245 --> 01:29:28,565
Speaker 6:  they were just blaring the soundtrack. Alison can for can Attest. I went,

1469
01:29:28,665 --> 01:29:29,925
Speaker 6:  oh my God, K-Pop Demon Hunters,

1470
01:29:30,185 --> 01:29:33,565
Speaker 8:  No idea what I was listening to. And v explained it.

1471
01:29:33,955 --> 01:29:37,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So I I to your point, I do think

1472
01:29:37,685 --> 01:29:41,445
Speaker 6:  they're just going like, screw prestige. We'll just go

1473
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:45,525
Speaker 6:  in on KDRs, which are produced super cheaply overseas. Let's

1474
01:29:45,525 --> 01:29:49,125
Speaker 6:  get in on the YouTubers, which have a built-in audience. Let's just, it's

1475
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:52,565
Speaker 6:  kind of just like what Google did and they're just like, we're gonna find

1476
01:29:52,675 --> 01:29:55,405
Speaker 6:  different distribution. Like, you

1477
01:29:55,405 --> 01:29:58,005
Speaker 5:  Know what I, I think there's something there, right? It's like the traditional,

1478
01:29:59,005 --> 01:30:02,825
Speaker 5:  you know, prestige stuff. Like, that's expensive. It's risky and

1479
01:30:02,985 --> 01:30:06,785
Speaker 5:  everyone makes fun of you when you do a bad job. But like, they can

1480
01:30:06,785 --> 01:30:10,385
Speaker 5:  pump out however many reality shows they want. And actually, like, there's

1481
01:30:10,385 --> 01:30:13,585
Speaker 5:  a pretty big audience for that stuff. And they don't all have to be winners.

1482
01:30:13,895 --> 01:30:17,705
Speaker 5:  They can syndicate or bring in a ton of K

1483
01:30:17,805 --> 01:30:20,865
Speaker 5:  dramas. They, they can see if it's any good. They can make deals for this

1484
01:30:20,865 --> 01:30:23,705
Speaker 5:  stuff. They don't. Right. They don't have to take on as much risk. And I

1485
01:30:23,705 --> 01:30:26,225
Speaker 5:  think the YouTubers, you're right, like there's a built-in audience there.

1486
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:30,025
Speaker 6:  It just makes sense. And like they're doing a lot of weird live stuff too.

1487
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:33,345
Speaker 6:  Like, I was watching ev everybody's live with John Malaney And I was like,

1488
01:30:33,385 --> 01:30:34,745
Speaker 6:  I didn't know this was a thing.

1489
01:30:35,465 --> 01:30:39,345
Speaker 5:  I, I signed up and said I could watch the first episode because

1490
01:30:39,345 --> 01:30:41,865
Speaker 5:  I'm like, oh, this is crazy. They're doing a talk show with John Mullaney,

1491
01:30:41,865 --> 01:30:44,345
Speaker 5:  it's gonna be live. And then at the top of the first episode he is like,

1492
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:46,985
Speaker 5:  we actually did this last year. I'm like, what? I have the same

1493
01:30:47,265 --> 01:30:50,305
Speaker 6:  Reaction done this, I have the same reaction. I was like, what?

1494
01:30:51,305 --> 01:30:53,545
Speaker 6:  I didn't know they did this last year live. It's not,

1495
01:30:53,695 --> 01:30:57,345
Speaker 5:  They're work, they're working on learning how to promote this, I guess.

1496
01:30:57,415 --> 01:30:57,705
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1497
01:30:57,735 --> 01:31:01,505
Speaker 6:  They're, but like to your point, Netflix feels different

1498
01:31:01,695 --> 01:31:02,705
Speaker 6:  from what it used to be.

1499
01:31:02,975 --> 01:31:06,745
Speaker 5:  It's, it's clearly in a new era it is figuring things out. Right?

1500
01:31:06,745 --> 01:31:10,625
Speaker 5:  They're doing like the, the big fights to, there's a

1501
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:14,185
Speaker 5:  lot more here and it's like the, the, the future shape of Netflix

1502
01:31:14,405 --> 01:31:18,265
Speaker 5:  is very different. And as somebody who, I

1503
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:21,945
Speaker 5:  dunno enjoyed quite a few of those like prestigious series I did, you know,

1504
01:31:21,945 --> 01:31:22,825
Speaker 5:  a little bummed. But

1505
01:31:23,885 --> 01:31:27,545
Speaker 6:  Listen, you can just watch 40,000 k dramas. All of them are 15

1506
01:31:27,585 --> 01:31:31,145
Speaker 6:  episodes. They kind of drag around episode 10 where you're like, get on with

1507
01:31:31,145 --> 01:31:33,305
Speaker 6:  it, but then it's done and there's like 4,000 of them.

1508
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:36,345
Speaker 5:  Well this is what I've learned. I need to watch K-Pop Demon Honors to prepare

1509
01:31:36,345 --> 01:31:39,985
Speaker 5:  for K-Pop Demon, hers two, three and the live action movie.

1510
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,745
Speaker 6:  What I will say is the soundtrack is a banger.

1511
01:31:43,005 --> 01:31:46,905
Speaker 5:  May I'll start there. Alright. The what have you got

1512
01:31:46,905 --> 01:31:47,025
Speaker 5:  next?

1513
01:31:47,365 --> 01:31:50,945
Speaker 6:  So this is a sequel from last week's corporate shenanigans. Mm.

1514
01:31:51,445 --> 01:31:55,265
Speaker 6:  So we have a little mini corporate shenanigan sequel

1515
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:58,785
Speaker 6:  where Massimo maker of medical tech devices,

1516
01:31:59,025 --> 01:32:02,765
Speaker 6:  mostly Pulse Oximeters, is now suing US customs

1517
01:32:03,145 --> 01:32:06,845
Speaker 6:  for allowing Apple to have a workaround from the Apple

1518
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:11,205
Speaker 6:  Botch import ban. And I just think that is Chef's

1519
01:32:11,205 --> 01:32:14,965
Speaker 6:  Kiss. I love corporate beef over patents. It's so

1520
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:19,365
Speaker 6:  like, as a puny human who like worries about paying

1521
01:32:19,455 --> 01:32:23,205
Speaker 6:  bills that I'm just like, ha these

1522
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:26,845
Speaker 6:  numbers that they're talking about are fake. But also

1523
01:32:27,865 --> 01:32:31,765
Speaker 6:  the pettiness, I live for the pettiness of this. They're like, well we can't

1524
01:32:31,765 --> 01:32:35,325
Speaker 6:  get Apple, so well get you and your little dog do

1525
01:32:35,585 --> 01:32:36,365
Speaker 6:  us customs.

1526
01:32:36,805 --> 01:32:40,765
Speaker 5:  This, this is so good because Apple, right. Apple went to customs

1527
01:32:40,825 --> 01:32:44,565
Speaker 5:  and they're like, this is good. Right? Like we f like we, we, we snuck it

1528
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:48,445
Speaker 5:  in. We figured something out and customs give 'em the Okay. Yeah. And so

1529
01:32:49,075 --> 01:32:52,405
Speaker 5:  they can't sue Apple or maybe they're already suing Apple. They're,

1530
01:32:52,405 --> 01:32:54,125
Speaker 6:  They've already sued Apple like five times.

1531
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:57,725
Speaker 5:  They're mad at customs. And so like, I, I guess, I guess we'll Sue

1532
01:32:57,725 --> 01:32:58,525
Speaker 5:  customs. Yeah.

1533
01:32:58,525 --> 01:33:02,045
Speaker 6:  They're like, we don't like this customs. You were out of pocket

1534
01:33:02,175 --> 01:33:06,125
Speaker 6:  doing that. Also, we didn't find out about this until Apple announced

1535
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:10,045
Speaker 6:  it. What the heck? So it was just, I I was just looking at

1536
01:33:10,045 --> 01:33:12,325
Speaker 6:  that and I'm like, oh, my show's on.

1537
01:33:13,115 --> 01:33:14,885
Speaker 8:  They're just lashing out. Yeah.

1538
01:33:14,995 --> 01:33:18,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm once again begging everyone to make these

1539
01:33:18,955 --> 01:33:22,805
Speaker 5:  sensors useful. Like, this is, again, this

1540
01:33:22,805 --> 01:33:26,365
Speaker 5:  sensor was missing from the Apple watch for a year and a half

1541
01:33:27,105 --> 01:33:28,485
Speaker 5:  and no one complained.

1542
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:33,085
Speaker 6:  No. Well, like four people in my comments complain. 'cause

1543
01:33:33,105 --> 01:33:35,885
Speaker 6:  I'm the wearable lady and so they're, if they're gonna complain to anybody,

1544
01:33:35,995 --> 01:33:39,765
Speaker 6:  it's gonna be me. But most people did not miss this sensor

1545
01:33:40,135 --> 01:33:43,965
Speaker 6:  whatsoever. And you just have Massimo being over here

1546
01:33:43,995 --> 01:33:47,965
Speaker 6:  like, this is our thing. You can't do this. And

1547
01:33:47,965 --> 01:33:51,605
Speaker 6:  meanwhile I'm sitting here going like, guys, your patent expires in 2028

1548
01:33:51,955 --> 01:33:52,245
Speaker 6:  like

1549
01:33:52,515 --> 01:33:56,365
Speaker 5:  This. I guess this really is their, their last hurrah. Like they've got

1550
01:33:56,385 --> 01:33:56,605
Speaker 5:  to,

1551
01:33:57,195 --> 01:33:58,685
Speaker 6:  They've, you know, they're

1552
01:33:58,685 --> 01:34:00,805
Speaker 5:  Just, they've gotta get it now or they've got nothing. They're,

1553
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:03,885
Speaker 6:  I feel like they're at this point that I was like, we're in too deep. We've

1554
01:34:03,885 --> 01:34:07,165
Speaker 6:  made a stand. We can't let, we can't like,

1555
01:34:08,195 --> 01:34:11,805
Speaker 6:  like what, what was the thing they say at the end of Brave Braveheart? Just

1556
01:34:11,805 --> 01:34:14,485
Speaker 6:  like, that's how I imagine them just yelling the, the Braveheart thing going

1557
01:34:14,485 --> 01:34:18,285
Speaker 6:  into battle. They're like, for glory or whatever my crappy Scottish accent

1558
01:34:18,285 --> 01:34:21,045
Speaker 6:  is. But you know, just, that's how I imagine Massimo and just being like

1559
01:34:21,215 --> 01:34:23,485
Speaker 6:  blood oxygen. So yeah,

1560
01:34:24,065 --> 01:34:27,045
Speaker 5:  I'm happy for them. I'm glad they're continuing the beef. Allison,

1561
01:34:28,185 --> 01:34:31,205
Speaker 5:  we, the last week we decided are these events

1562
01:34:31,595 --> 01:34:35,405
Speaker 5:  shenanigans or are they serious? What is your read in the Moss most situation?

1563
01:34:36,365 --> 01:34:40,085
Speaker 8:  I maybe a little bit of both. I think it, it makes sense if

1564
01:34:40,085 --> 01:34:43,565
Speaker 8:  they're, they gotta make the most out of this patent and they're just gonna

1565
01:34:43,565 --> 01:34:47,125
Speaker 8:  throw a fit with everybody and make it everybody

1566
01:34:47,305 --> 01:34:48,005
Speaker 8:  else's problem.

1567
01:34:48,675 --> 01:34:52,325
Speaker 5:  This is, I I think I'm with you where it's like this is, they're,

1568
01:34:52,325 --> 01:34:55,845
Speaker 5:  they're dead serious, but it is absolutely futile.

1569
01:34:55,955 --> 01:34:57,460
Speaker 5:  They're gonna get nowhere

1570
01:34:57,945 --> 01:35:01,845
Speaker 6:  Stupid. I mean, apple has so much money, so nobody

1571
01:35:02,015 --> 01:35:04,805
Speaker 6:  knows what Massimo is except for like this Apple

1572
01:35:04,805 --> 01:35:07,525
Speaker 5:  Will invent new court systems if it has to. It

1573
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:11,605
Speaker 6:  Apple will be like, okay, bet we'll find a different workaround

1574
01:35:12,575 --> 01:35:16,245
Speaker 6:  aside from this work. We have time, we have money bet we're gonna just

1575
01:35:16,425 --> 01:35:20,165
Speaker 6:  not do this. So it's just like, I feel like they're just doing this

1576
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:24,245
Speaker 6:  on principle. They're like, we're gonna stand on business, on blood

1577
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:28,365
Speaker 6:  oxygen, this thing that people do not care about extensively.

1578
01:35:28,825 --> 01:35:32,365
Speaker 6:  And we are just gonna beef until the sun. It's Kendrick

1579
01:35:32,775 --> 01:35:34,845
Speaker 6:  Lamar energy and

1580
01:35:35,025 --> 01:35:36,685
Speaker 8:  You gotta respect it. Yeah.

1581
01:35:37,635 --> 01:35:40,565
Speaker 6:  Like I, I, I, 2025 is the year of the hater,

1582
01:35:41,865 --> 01:35:43,045
Speaker 6:  so I gotta respect it.

1583
01:35:43,395 --> 01:35:47,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's good. Okay. Excited to see where this goes next. And how

1584
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:50,325
Speaker 5:  many more lawsuits are filed before the patent expires in 2028,

1585
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:51,805
Speaker 6:  20,000. Keep

1586
01:35:51,835 --> 01:35:55,805

1588
01:36:00,165 --> 01:36:00,285
Speaker 6:  B

1589
01:36:01,295 --> 01:36:03,785
Speaker 5:  Allison, take us home. What do we got?

1590
01:36:04,455 --> 01:36:07,505
Speaker 8:  Okay, this is the most important news you'll hear all week.

1591
01:36:09,745 --> 01:36:13,585
Speaker 8:  Chipotle is starting drone

1592
01:36:13,985 --> 01:36:14,145
Speaker 8:  delivery.

1593
01:36:15,695 --> 01:36:19,545
Speaker 8:  This is an article in an, on a blog called Deli.

1594
01:36:20,565 --> 01:36:23,825
Speaker 8:  And they're okay. It's only in like Dallas I think right now,

1595
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:25,505
Speaker 8:  but they're calling

1596
01:36:25,505 --> 01:36:26,265
Speaker 5:  Texas now Dallas.

1597
01:36:26,785 --> 01:36:26,945
Speaker 8:  I know.

1598
01:36:27,175 --> 01:36:28,065
Speaker 5:  Come on. Come on.

1599
01:36:28,815 --> 01:36:32,585
Speaker 8:  They're calling. Well, it's a partnership with a company called Zipline.

1600
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:36,385
Speaker 8:  I don't know what that is. They have drones, but they're calling it

1601
01:36:36,745 --> 01:36:37,305
Speaker 8:  Chipotle.

1602
01:36:38,445 --> 01:36:41,545
Speaker 5:  No. Yeah, yeah. That I, that I'm, that I'm not on board with. Yeah.

1603
01:36:41,565 --> 01:36:45,305
Speaker 8:  Yes. But can you imagine like chips and guacamole

1604
01:36:45,825 --> 01:36:47,625
Speaker 8:  reigning down from heaven, just literally

1605
01:36:47,855 --> 01:36:50,945
Speaker 6:  It's, it's like cloudy with a chance of burritos. I love it.

1606
01:36:50,945 --> 01:36:54,785
Speaker 5:  Yes. Yes. This, this increases my chance of ordering Chipotle like 10 x.

1607
01:36:54,785 --> 01:36:56,065
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like I absolutely,

1608
01:36:56,605 --> 01:36:56,825
Speaker 6:  And

1609
01:36:56,945 --> 01:36:59,825
Speaker 8:  I just wanna, and like you could, could stick outside, could DoorDash it

1610
01:36:59,825 --> 01:37:03,385
Speaker 8:  or whatever, but like knowing that it would come from the sky

1611
01:37:03,655 --> 01:37:07,545
Speaker 8:  from a drone, like no, no other human would have to know

1612
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:11,385
Speaker 8:  that I am ordering a burrito at whatever hour it

1613
01:37:11,385 --> 01:37:14,705
Speaker 5:  Is. I mean, on the other hand, all your neighbors can be like, Hey Allison,

1614
01:37:15,185 --> 01:37:19,105
Speaker 5:  I saw a small aircraft land in your yard. Yeah. Like what was that important?

1615
01:37:19,255 --> 01:37:19,545
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1616
01:37:19,605 --> 01:37:22,305
Speaker 8:  I'd be like, oh, you know, UFOI, I don't know.

1617
01:37:23,485 --> 01:37:27,265
Speaker 8:  But yeah, you, you order just like in the

1618
01:37:27,265 --> 01:37:28,945
Speaker 8:  Chipotle app, it looks like,

1619
01:37:31,005 --> 01:37:34,465
Speaker 8:  oh, maybe you need a zip line app too. I dunno what this is.

1620
01:37:36,065 --> 01:37:39,305
Speaker 8:  Chipotle staff place your meal in a zipping point

1621
01:37:40,285 --> 01:37:42,545
Speaker 8:  and then a zip picks it up,

1622
01:37:44,355 --> 01:37:48,265
Speaker 8:  takes off and hovers around 300 feet and then

1623
01:37:48,325 --> 01:37:52,145
Speaker 8:  it lowers your Chipotle bag to your, I

1624
01:37:52,145 --> 01:37:56,085
Speaker 8:  don't know, front porch, backyard. It's a little gross thinking

1625
01:37:56,085 --> 01:38:00,045
Speaker 8:  about my food just kind of sitting in my yard. But

1626
01:38:00,145 --> 01:38:03,645
Speaker 6:  Listen, I'm just imagining Tim Robbins in

1627
01:38:03,885 --> 01:38:07,165
Speaker 6:  Shawshank Redemption, just, it's rainy. He doesn't feel like cooking.

1628
01:38:07,705 --> 01:38:11,565
Speaker 6:  And then he orders this Chipotle and he goes outside in the rain and goes

1629
01:38:11,565 --> 01:38:14,725
Speaker 6:  on his knees and goes Al Pastor Burrito.

1630
01:38:15,745 --> 01:38:19,565
Speaker 6:  Yes. And then it just like launches down

1631
01:38:19,565 --> 01:38:23,285
Speaker 6:  from the drone into his mouth. That's, that's my dream. Okay.

1632
01:38:23,525 --> 01:38:27,125
Speaker 5:  I legitimately though, this is my question. Can this thing operate when like,

1633
01:38:27,185 --> 01:38:30,525
Speaker 5:  you know, a little rain if, because it was raining if I'm hungry last night.

1634
01:38:30,715 --> 01:38:34,645
Speaker 5:  Last night it was storming. Yes. My fridge was empty And

1635
01:38:34,645 --> 01:38:38,405
Speaker 5:  I am like, I am gonna the grocery store and I'm like, I'm not, I'm not order

1636
01:38:38,685 --> 01:38:42,125
Speaker 5:  delivery. You can order delivery. These guys are on e-bikes. Yeah. That's

1637
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:42,645
Speaker 5:  not the right time.

1638
01:38:42,985 --> 01:38:44,245
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. That is tough.

1639
01:38:45,305 --> 01:38:49,245
Speaker 5:  If I can send a drone out that drove might crash, but

1640
01:38:49,845 --> 01:38:52,805
Speaker 5:  I would get a burrito if it, it didn't, you get a, which is a pretty good,

1641
01:38:53,495 --> 01:38:56,445
Speaker 5:  there is a Chipotle in like a two block radius of me.

1642
01:38:56,825 --> 01:38:57,285
Speaker 6:  It wouldn't have

1643
01:38:57,285 --> 01:38:58,765
Speaker 5:  To far could, a burrito

1644
01:38:58,815 --> 01:39:00,485
Speaker 6:  Could make it would not be that make

1645
01:39:00,485 --> 01:39:03,805
Speaker 8:  It, they could throw it, they could just throw it to your front stoop,

1646
01:39:04,745 --> 01:39:06,765
Speaker 5:  You know. Yeah. Yeah. That's a next step. But

1647
01:39:06,765 --> 01:39:09,965
Speaker 6:  You know, I think I get why they're doing it in Dallas and not New York City.

1648
01:39:09,975 --> 01:39:13,485
Speaker 6:  Could you imagine everyone who's hungry in New York City getting their

1649
01:39:14,285 --> 01:39:18,245
Speaker 6:  Chipotle burrito drone and just like, how do you deliver it to

1650
01:39:18,245 --> 01:39:22,045
Speaker 6:  an apartment? Is it the drone gonna like fly outside your fire, fire, escape,

1651
01:39:22,105 --> 01:39:22,445
Speaker 6:  and then

1652
01:39:22,445 --> 01:39:23,285
Speaker 5:  Throw Okay that

1653
01:39:23,825 --> 01:39:25,965
Speaker 8:  You open the door, the window and you grab it.

1654
01:39:27,035 --> 01:39:29,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like that. Could you just imagine that, that

1655
01:39:30,155 --> 01:39:31,085
Speaker 8:  That would be perfect.

1656
01:39:31,635 --> 01:39:35,565
Speaker 6:  That would, that would be something just like an army of,

1657
01:39:35,985 --> 01:39:39,645
Speaker 6:  an army of drones with Chipotle

1658
01:39:39,685 --> 01:39:43,445
Speaker 6:  burritos in New York City. Just descending like a swarm of burrito bees.

1659
01:39:43,545 --> 01:39:43,765
Speaker 6:  If

1660
01:39:43,765 --> 01:39:45,325
Speaker 5:  Food delivery can go right into my window,

1661
01:39:46,915 --> 01:39:50,555
Speaker 5:  I mean that's, that's the epitome of laziness. I, it's all over

1662
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:51,715
Speaker 5:  it. Can't get better than that.

1663
01:39:52,015 --> 01:39:55,715
Speaker 6:  I'm here. Screw through a eye. Why are we not inventing this?

1664
01:39:56,055 --> 01:39:58,315
Speaker 5:  We need to focus on the important technologies.

1665
01:39:58,945 --> 01:40:00,835
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Drone burritos. There

1666
01:40:00,835 --> 01:40:02,435
Speaker 8:  Is, so there is a limitation.

1667
01:40:04,095 --> 01:40:07,715
Speaker 8:  It can carry orders up to 5.5 pounds.

1668
01:40:07,975 --> 01:40:11,515
Speaker 5:  That's like a burrito. Yeah. Like that's not right.

1669
01:40:12,665 --> 01:40:13,115
Speaker 8:  It's like a

1670
01:40:13,115 --> 01:40:13,915
Speaker 6:  Chipotle burrito.

1671
01:40:13,915 --> 01:40:16,275
Speaker 5:  Those are hefty burritos. Yeah. Yeah. They, okay.

1672
01:40:17,705 --> 01:40:18,795
Speaker 5:  That is not going far.

1673
01:40:19,065 --> 01:40:22,635
Speaker 8:  I've seen my husband order at Chipotle and that is weighing

1674
01:40:22,935 --> 01:40:25,115
Speaker 8:  at least five pounds. It's a lot.

1675
01:40:26,185 --> 01:40:28,875
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He gets all this stuff. Okay. They should have started with a different

1676
01:40:29,155 --> 01:40:32,435
Speaker 5:  restaurant. Chipotle was not the place for it.

1677
01:40:33,545 --> 01:40:34,955
Speaker 8:  It's a little too heavy. Yeah.

1678
01:40:35,255 --> 01:40:38,875
Speaker 5:  And that's it for The Vergecast. Stay tuned. Alison is hosting on Tuesday.
