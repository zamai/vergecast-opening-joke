00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:06,005
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of machine learning based

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,765
Speaker 2:  recommendation systems. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am on a

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:13,445
Speaker 2:  walk. So I've been trying this thing where instead of sitting in front of

5
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:16,885
Speaker 2:  screens all day, which I do, way too much of my back hurts, my eyes hurt.

6
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:20,745
Speaker 2:  It's just bad times. I try to get out in the world once a day

7
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:24,605
Speaker 2:  and just kind of wander around. A lot of smart people say that if you want

8
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:28,525
Speaker 2:  to think something through or be creative or process something, there's

9
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:32,365
Speaker 2:  really nothing better for you than to just go for a walk, leave all your

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,325
Speaker 2:  technology at home and just walk until you've figured it out. It's a

11
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:40,125
Speaker 2:  kind of romantic idea. I really love it. But so far in my experience,

12
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,645
Speaker 2:  I've found that I spend a lot of time just like walking, singing

13
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:47,285
Speaker 2:  1 21 Pilots song to myself over and over

14
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:51,165
Speaker 2:  again, and then I get home and I'm like, did I actually just accomplish

15
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:53,645
Speaker 2:  anything? I don't know. Maybe it's like meditation where you have to do it

16
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:57,005
Speaker 2:  a lot and you get better at it. But I feel like when I go on a walk and I'm

17
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,165
Speaker 2:  like, I'm gonna think deep thoughts, it's not going super great so far, but

18
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:03,385
Speaker 2:  at least the walking is nice and it's definitely good to not look at screens

19
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:06,885
Speaker 2:  for at least a little while every now and then. Anyway, we have an awesome

20
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:09,935
Speaker 2:  show coming up for you today. The first person I'm gonna talk to is Gustav

21
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:13,605
Speaker 2:  Soderstrom, who's the co-president of Spotify. He also ran product for

22
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:17,485
Speaker 2:  Spotify for a long time and he is the person I most wanted to talk

23
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:21,125
Speaker 2:  to about what Spotify is trying to be. It's trying to be

24
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,925
Speaker 2:  this incredible AI recommendation system that knows exactly

25
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:28,245
Speaker 2:  what you wanna listen to and exactly what you're doing at exactly the right

26
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:32,005
Speaker 2:  time. It's also kind of trying to be TikTok and it's doing audiobooks and

27
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:35,985
Speaker 2:  it's doing podcasts, and I'm trying to figure out how you do

28
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:39,785
Speaker 2:  all of that all in one place without making a total mess

29
00:01:39,785 --> 00:01:43,285
Speaker 2:  out of Spotify. So that is what Gustave and I talked about. He's very open

30
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:46,525
Speaker 2:  and very smart about all of it, and it was a really fun conversation after

31
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:50,005
Speaker 2:  that. I'm gonna talk to Alex Cranz, who is my favorite person to talk to

32
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:53,435
Speaker 2:  about all things streaming. We're gonna talk about Disney and

33
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:57,325
Speaker 2:  Hulu And, what Verizon is doing with Netflix and Max and what's going on

34
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,165
Speaker 2:  with Marvel movies and just what to make of all of this

35
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:05,005
Speaker 2:  upheaval. We both have strong theories about ads and bundling and we had

36
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:07,725
Speaker 2:  a lot of fun hanging out. And of course we're gonna get to the virtual cast

37
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:10,525
Speaker 2:  Hotline, we have a really fun one this week. All that is coming up in just

38
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:14,465
Speaker 2:  a second, but first I have like three more blocks on this walk

39
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:18,045
Speaker 2:  and I'm gonna go try and think some deep thoughts on my way back. This is

40
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:21,995
Speaker 2:  The Vergecast. See you in a sec.

41
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:37,405
Speaker 2:  Welcome back, So, I. Didn't think any deep thoughts, but that

42
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:41,445
Speaker 2:  1 21 pilot song is now deeply lodged in my

43
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:45,095
Speaker 2:  head, probably forever. And also I'm cold All, right?

44
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:48,985
Speaker 2:  Let's get into it. I think Spotify is one of the most interesting companies

45
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:52,965
Speaker 2:  and apps on the planet right now. It's a huge winner as a music

46
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,845
Speaker 2:  streaming app, but it turns out there's really no money in being a

47
00:03:56,845 --> 00:04:00,255
Speaker 2:  music streaming app. So it's trying to figure out podcasts and

48
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:03,865
Speaker 2:  audiobooks and in general being whatever the

49
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:07,445
Speaker 2:  TikTok for audio is. That's what CEO Daniel Eck has called it

50
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:11,025
Speaker 2:  before and it sort of makes sense. But then as a user of Spotify

51
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:14,925
Speaker 2:  mostly I worry that all of that stuff is just gonna clutter up

52
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,295
Speaker 2:  the app and confuse my playlists and make everything about it

53
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:22,175
Speaker 2:  worse. I think a lot that maybe Spotify should just be a really good

54
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:26,165
Speaker 2:  music app instead of trying to take over the world and shove

55
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,795
Speaker 2:  a lot of audio into one place. I don't know. Gustav Soderstrom,

56
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:33,155
Speaker 2:  Spotify's co-president and chief product Officer is the person

57
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:37,125
Speaker 2:  responsible for making all of this stuff make sense together. So I brought

58
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,785
Speaker 2:  him onto the show to talk about everything from recommendations to audiobooks,

59
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:44,685
Speaker 2:  to app design, all to try and figure out what Spotify wants to

60
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,525
Speaker 2:  be and whether it's possible to do it all really well. We

61
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:52,245
Speaker 2:  started by going back a few months to this spring when Spotify

62
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:55,925
Speaker 2:  announced a more visual, more TikTok style

63
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:59,885
Speaker 2:  redesign for the app. Here's Gusav at Spotify's Stream on event explaining

64
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,825
Speaker 2:  kind of the big idea behind it.

65
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,665
Speaker 5:  The Spotify we're revealing today is built to feel alive.

66
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:09,145
Speaker 5:  The interface is dynamic. It's easier than ever to

67
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:12,805
Speaker 5:  scroll and swipe and load it with all new ways for

68
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:16,485
Speaker 5:  listeners to enjoy your work. The Reimagine Home Feed will show better

69
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:20,145
Speaker 5:  recommendations from your favorites, the fresh content with

70
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:23,045
Speaker 5:  richly animated images and videos.

71
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:26,825
Speaker 2:  I asked Gustav to dig a little deeper on that and to explain what Spotify

72
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:30,285
Speaker 2:  was trying to do with this redesign because I think the

73
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:34,265
Speaker 2:  redesign actually says a lot about what that app wants to be.

74
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:37,355
Speaker 2:  So what was Spotify trying to do here?

75
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:40,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so if we go all the way back to to what we were trying to achieve

76
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:44,805
Speaker 6:  something like a year ago plus a bit more actually. So we kind

77
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:48,725
Speaker 6:  of pride ourselves on being good at discovery. Sometimes we say we think

78
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:52,325
Speaker 6:  that we're the best at discovery if we ask our users, but it's a certain

79
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:55,005
Speaker 6:  type of discovery. It's kind of the type of discovery we call background

80
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:58,765
Speaker 6:  discovery. When you're listening to a playlist, we're very good at

81
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:02,365
Speaker 6:  finding tracks that fit that playlist that you might like so forth. We also

82
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:06,245
Speaker 6:  have a lot of specific playlists for Discovery, You know, discover

83
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:10,205
Speaker 6:  Weekly and Daily Mix and so forth. But there's a different type of discovery

84
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:13,925
Speaker 6:  which we sort of called foreground Discovery. When you're finding, for example,

85
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,835
Speaker 6:  a new act and a genre that you didn't even know you liked,

86
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:21,005
Speaker 6:  it's not actually similar to anything you're listening to right now. And

87
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,455
Speaker 6:  the truth is that most of that type of discovery doesn't happen on Spotify.

88
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:28,385
Speaker 6:  We're really good at inserting more of what you're already listening to.

89
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:31,405
Speaker 6:  You know if you're, if you're into certain genre, we're really good at finding

90
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:35,045
Speaker 6:  other things that isn't that genre that we think you'll like. But if you

91
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:38,445
Speaker 6:  want to explore a completely new genre, those things actually often happen

92
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:41,445
Speaker 6:  off platform. They happen on YouTube, they happen on TikTok, they happen

93
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:45,415
Speaker 6:  in other places And and two things are important there. When you are

94
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:49,345
Speaker 6:  evaluating a lot of sort of new music that you don't even know if you like,

95
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:52,765
Speaker 6:  you usually don't listen to the full songs so you and spend

96
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:56,625
Speaker 6:  hours, you're kind of evaluating much more quickly.

97
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,085
Speaker 6:  And secondly, you're also quite interested when you discover band in, in

98
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,185
Speaker 6:  sort of seeing what they look like and so forth, right? And and that's mostly

99
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:05,925
Speaker 6:  the first time we're interested in that. Not the 10th time that you listen

100
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,245
Speaker 6:  to the song, but the first time it kinda matters, right? So we've been in

101
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:12,085
Speaker 6:  this symbiotic relationship with these other services where You know there's

102
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:15,045
Speaker 6:  a lot of foreground discovery that happens all over the place, but then you

103
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:18,005
Speaker 6:  usually save that track to Spotify and that's where you spend most of your

104
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:21,465
Speaker 6:  consumption. And that's, that's fine by us. It's worked for us really well.

105
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:24,565
Speaker 6:  It means that we could focus our investment on the sort of background moment,

106
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:27,485
Speaker 6:  background discovery being a really good background application. But we decided

107
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:31,205
Speaker 6:  about a year plus ago that we want to become a really good place for when

108
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:33,845
Speaker 6:  you wanna explore something completely new as well. And when you want to

109
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:37,085
Speaker 6:  break out of your show. That's, that's the feedback that we got like Spotify's

110
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:40,965
Speaker 6:  really good for already already like, but it's not that easy to break out

111
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:43,925
Speaker 6:  of your sort of taste bubble. And this is what brought brought about the

112
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:47,835
Speaker 6:  whole redesign and it, it was across music but also across

113
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:51,765
Speaker 6:  podcast and now recently across audiobooks as well. How do you

114
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:55,085
Speaker 6:  evaluate a lot of items in more of AGTD get things

115
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:59,075
Speaker 6:  done way where the hit ratio may be low, maybe

116
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:02,925
Speaker 6:  it's one great candidate in 10, well then you

117
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:06,125
Speaker 6:  better need to be able to quickly get through those 10 versus in the

118
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,845
Speaker 6:  background, if we had a one in 10 hit ratio, you would hate Spotify. It has

119
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:12,805
Speaker 6:  to be like nine in 10, right? So you have to be much more careful and so

120
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:15,685
Speaker 6:  forth. So we saw that's, that was the impetus like why we did it because

121
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:19,265
Speaker 6:  we also wanted to, in addition to staying very good at background discovery,

122
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,405
Speaker 6:  we wanted to bring foreground discovery or or being able giving you tools

123
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:25,905
Speaker 6:  to quickly break out your taste bubble and find something completely

124
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:26,505
Speaker 6:  new.

125
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,085
Speaker 2:  What's really interesting about that is that that strategy makes absolute

126
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:32,525
Speaker 2:  perfect sense. I think especially the idea of trying to make it easier for

127
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:36,485
Speaker 2:  people to find stuff they don't like. Which sounds weird. Like the the sort

128
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:39,965
Speaker 2:  of lowering the penalty of guessing wrong. Exactly. Makes total sense to

129
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:40,365
Speaker 2:  me. Yeah.

130
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:43,495
Speaker 6:  What is often called like fault tolerant in like product speak,

131
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:47,305
Speaker 2:  Right? And I think like if TikTok did one incredible thing for the world,

132
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:51,115
Speaker 2:  it was that like it it is the most fault tolerant app that has ever existed.

133
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:51,915
Speaker 2:  Exactly

134
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:52,205
Speaker 6:  What

135
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,725
Speaker 2:  I think is really interesting and and the way you describe that makes me

136
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:58,605
Speaker 2:  think that if Spotify had always done that

137
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,285
Speaker 2:  kind of thing, it would make perfect sense to everybody. But there's something

138
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:05,165
Speaker 2:  about coming back around to the foreground piece where it's like we

139
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:08,445
Speaker 2:  want you to be more in the app. We're gonna make the app more enticing and

140
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:11,225
Speaker 2:  more inviting. We want you to scroll more, we want you to do more stuff.

141
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:15,085
Speaker 2:  And I'm just like thinking about all of the like mad people on Reddit

142
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:18,525
Speaker 2:  when the redesign started coming out and that sort of instinctive reaction

143
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:22,245
Speaker 2:  some people had to seeing the way the new app looked and even as what you

144
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,925
Speaker 2:  described as very much sort of the other side of the coin of a thing that

145
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:28,765
Speaker 2:  already exists, it's just so different. Did you expect the kind of

146
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:32,485
Speaker 2:  visceral reaction of like we're doing a very different thing even in

147
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,305
Speaker 2:  service of the same activity.

148
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:39,125
Speaker 6:  So let's dig into it because it was a combination of a few things. I sort

149
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:43,005
Speaker 6:  of did expect it any like I've redesigned like the entire thing

150
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:46,905
Speaker 6:  a few times in my career and people are always very upset. Sure.

151
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:50,365
Speaker 6:  The problem with that is that they can be upset but it's

152
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:54,075
Speaker 6:  right. They just don't understand it yet. You know the Steve Jobs view.

153
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:57,725
Speaker 6:  Sure. Or they can be upset because it's actually bad and wrong. And the question

154
00:09:57,725 --> 00:10:01,245
Speaker 6:  is how do you tell those two apart? And so it was a little bit of both in

155
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:04,885
Speaker 6:  this case. So this was impetus. It was to give users tools for much better

156
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:08,525
Speaker 6:  foreground discovery and be able to effectively try a completely new

157
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,885
Speaker 6:  genres and so forth. Now what happened when we launched this even before

158
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:15,485
Speaker 6:  people got to try it, to your point like even when we showed it, I think

159
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:19,085
Speaker 6:  the big challenge is that we were trying to do something very different with

160
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,865
Speaker 6:  these feeds. We were trying to get you to go through

161
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:26,515
Speaker 6:  as much music as possible in order to find stuff to save to your

162
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:30,245
Speaker 6:  library to listen to later. So it's actually discovery but not

163
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:33,585
Speaker 6:  consumption. Our point was to get you through this thing as fast as possible

164
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:36,885
Speaker 6:  and the thing we measure is sort of saves per minute. Whereas if you look

165
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:40,845
Speaker 6:  at TikTok or or YouTube shorts or reels, the feed is

166
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:43,805
Speaker 6:  the consumption. It's not discovery. The feed is consumption. The point is

167
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:47,025
Speaker 6:  to keep you there as long as possible. So I, think what happened when people

168
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:50,125
Speaker 6:  saw this. They were like, oh my god, I don't want another TikTok feed. Like

169
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,685
Speaker 6:  I have three now You know I have shorts and I have reels and I have TikTok

170
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:57,325
Speaker 6:  like why aren't they sticking to the music thing that I like them for? Why

171
00:10:57,325 --> 00:11:00,325
Speaker 6:  they wanna become TikTok? Because that's honestly what it looks like when

172
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,805
Speaker 6:  you see a feed of moving images. And so there was that like

173
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:07,565
Speaker 6:  visceral reaction to it, which is just like a problem of communication. And

174
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,965
Speaker 6:  the idea is, well when you start using it you'll understand that that's we're

175
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:13,685
Speaker 6:  actually trying to get you out of the feed as pos as much as possible and

176
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:16,805
Speaker 6:  get you to save as much and actually listen to it later. 'cause that's when,

177
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:20,605
Speaker 6:  I mean we don't gain anything unless you listen to it later. This is a

178
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:24,245
Speaker 6:  tool for for creating more sessions down the line. But then we also made

179
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:28,025
Speaker 6:  a few mistakes in the first iteration of it, which was that we were

180
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:31,885
Speaker 6:  so keen on adding foreground discovery that when we redesigned

181
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:35,785
Speaker 6:  the experience, we changed the balance of what the homepage specifically

182
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:39,165
Speaker 6:  did quite drastically. If you think about it from like the product team's

183
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,525
Speaker 6:  point of view, you look around and you see like there is, there's YouTube

184
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:46,285
Speaker 6:  over there. It's kind of similar long form experience music. It's just a,

185
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:50,065
Speaker 6:  it's just a feed You know everything is just a feed as the as the start page.

186
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:53,925
Speaker 6:  So you could guess that that's what users want. They wanna feed us a start

187
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:57,365
Speaker 6:  pitch and So I think we got a little bit too jealous of the

188
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:01,045
Speaker 6:  competition. And so You know we had these shortcuts on top of our home, but

189
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:04,765
Speaker 6:  then pretty quickly we went into like fullscreen carbs 'cause that's kinda

190
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,245
Speaker 6:  what word looks like and people were quite upset. And so we looked at this

191
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:11,955
Speaker 6:  and we realized that to our benefit we were doing something quite well

192
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:15,765
Speaker 6:  that we didn't understand that we broke. So our homepage was

193
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:19,735
Speaker 6:  quite different from from these competitors, which was just like full card

194
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:23,405
Speaker 6:  feeds. We had these shortcuts and then we had these shelves. And, what they

195
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:27,085
Speaker 6:  did, which I think we saw much better than competition, is that they

196
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:30,965
Speaker 6:  managed to keep you in a lot of sessions at the same time. You might be

197
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:34,945
Speaker 6:  in the middle of two podcasts now, one audiobook and a playlist

198
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:38,265
Speaker 6:  and you might be into a set of playlists right now. And our homepage managed

199
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:42,005
Speaker 6:  to solve what we call recall really well. It made it really easy without

200
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:45,045
Speaker 6:  having to go into your library and search to get back to those sessions.

201
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:48,765
Speaker 6:  The one the store really relevant to you, we had this balance between

202
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:52,005
Speaker 6:  recall and discovery where when we looked at the metrics, You know how much

203
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,445
Speaker 6:  of the consumption from the homepage is sort of recall. You go back into

204
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:59,105
Speaker 6:  sessions that you had previously visited or were in the middle of versus

205
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:02,945
Speaker 6:  how much is you truly listen to new one. It was almost like 90% recall

206
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:06,805
Speaker 6:  and 10% discovery. And when we flipped it around, we sort of

207
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:10,525
Speaker 6:  turned it into 10% recall, like the top shortcuts and 90%

208
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:14,505
Speaker 6:  discovery. And you could see this in the metric and on Twitter. So on Twitter,

209
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:18,445
Speaker 6:  if you squinted through all the swearing and cursing and this guy should

210
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:22,245
Speaker 6:  get fired and I was be put in a lion cage and all these things, you could

211
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:25,205
Speaker 6:  see the actual feedback being like, where the hell am I playlist? Where am

212
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,925
Speaker 6:  my podcast? Right? And then you look at the consumption data and you see

213
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:32,805
Speaker 6:  the same thing. You see traffic going to search and to library people were

214
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:36,405
Speaker 6:  trying to find their playlist. So we realized the error that we have flipped

215
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:40,385
Speaker 6:  the ratio too much into almost like forced discovery.

216
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:44,365
Speaker 6:  And then we, we said, okay, let's look at this and let's embrace what people

217
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,215
Speaker 6:  loved. If we were really good at recall, instead of even just going back,

218
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:51,405
Speaker 6:  let's make sure that the redesign, we leverage that and we become even better

219
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:54,565
Speaker 6:  at recall. The weird thing for us then was we looked at competition and like

220
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,805
Speaker 6:  they're actually not doing this at all and people don't seem to complain

221
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:00,435
Speaker 6:  and be angry like what's the problem? And we realized that we're probably

222
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:04,345
Speaker 6:  very good at recall keeping in many sessions at the same time.

223
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:07,905
Speaker 6:  And our competition is probably not. But the, the thing is they were never,

224
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:11,765
Speaker 6:  if you only ever had like a single feed, you think about something like a

225
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:14,225
Speaker 6:  YouTube or something, it's very hard to actually get back into the session.

226
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:17,245
Speaker 6:  You have to click at the bottom right and scroll back in history. So maybe

227
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:20,025
Speaker 6:  it was just a case that they don't complain because it was never good there.

228
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,885
Speaker 6:  As we try to then reverse and lean into let's be really good at recall. So

229
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:27,725
Speaker 6:  we actually made it even better and we got the recall metrics measured as

230
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:31,325
Speaker 6:  like how many people find a relevant session on home without having to go

231
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:34,325
Speaker 6:  to search or library? Got that even better. And then the problem was obviously,

232
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:37,245
Speaker 6:  well we wanted to achieve foregone discovery, so how do we solve this? And

233
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:41,165
Speaker 6:  we switched our tactic to instead being voluntary entry

234
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:45,145
Speaker 6:  points into, instead of these cards that ought to play in a very high

235
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:49,045
Speaker 6:  up. We have two mechanisms now. One is we have these, what we call

236
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:52,100
Speaker 6:  watch feeds or discovery feeds, which are these small cards that you can

237
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,075
Speaker 6:  click and then you go into feed only optimize for this, but it's, it's voluntary.

238
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:58,205
Speaker 6:  Like you click through and it's just like, Hey, we found a bunch of new songs

239
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:01,765
Speaker 6:  for you. We have a bunch of podcasts for you. The idea now is as soon as

240
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,805
Speaker 6:  you feel a little bored and trapped in a taste bubble, it should be one click

241
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:08,645
Speaker 6:  away to just get into very effective discovery. And then when you scroll

242
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:11,965
Speaker 6:  down the homepage, you actually get to these cards and we, we, we think of

243
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:15,225
Speaker 6:  that as like, if you keep scrolling, well then you probably didn't find anything.

244
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:18,645
Speaker 6:  So now you are interested in discovery. And to cut a long story slightly

245
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:22,625
Speaker 6:  shorter, where we are now finally is now the new homepage is,

246
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,725
Speaker 6:  is out to a hundred percent of existing users. So we're back to like one

247
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:29,565
Speaker 6:  homepage, which You know being on two stacks, it's very, very expensive

248
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:32,825
Speaker 6:  and very frustrating. And we see what we wanna see. So in this watch feed

249
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:36,485
Speaker 6:  for example, we actually see 50 times the saves per minute

250
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:40,205
Speaker 6:  versus any other session. Wow. Versus like You know a Discover Weekly or

251
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,035
Speaker 6:  something. Not, they're not saving 50 tracks per minute, but 50 times

252
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:48,005
Speaker 6:  more saves per minute. So we're seeing what we want to see finally and

253
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:51,885
Speaker 6:  and users now seem happy. So that's a long version of what actually

254
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:52,225
Speaker 6:  happened.

255
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:55,405
Speaker 2:  No, it's super interesting and you, you actually brought up kind of the the

256
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:59,325
Speaker 2:  like two central questions of what Spotify is that have

257
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,165
Speaker 2:  always fascinated me. I think part of the reason people flipped

258
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:06,525
Speaker 2:  out at having all of this discovery added was that Spotify is the app that

259
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,725
Speaker 2:  you use all the time, but hardly ever touch. Yeah. Right. And that's, that's

260
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:12,445
Speaker 2:  a really valuable thing and it's, it's a thing that I know Spotify in the

261
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:16,225
Speaker 2:  past has been very proud of, right? You can use Spotify for hours and hours

262
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,805
Speaker 2:  and hours without ever looking at it. And in a time when every app is

263
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:22,905
Speaker 2:  demanding my full face attention at all times,

264
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:26,835
Speaker 2:  that's good thing. Very true. But then how to marry that with this

265
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:30,525
Speaker 2:  idea of obviously You know you, you we, we wanna build a video ads business

266
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:34,365
Speaker 2:  and we also want to en engender this foreground discovery and like I can

267
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:38,245
Speaker 2:  see why there are lots of perfectly valid polls back into the app, but

268
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:42,205
Speaker 2:  it just breaks that sort of core behavior that is so good

269
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:45,445
Speaker 2:  about Spotify. Like I don't go to TikTok to listen to songs because it's

270
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:48,905
Speaker 2:  a pain in the ass to find songs on TikTok, right? I go to Spotify because,

271
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:51,605
Speaker 2:  and that's like the purpose it has served. And I feel like trying to pull

272
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:55,185
Speaker 2:  that thing back into it, even if it's the right call, is just a challenge

273
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:58,085
Speaker 2:  to do. Right? But then the other flip side of that is, and this is I feel

274
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,965
Speaker 2:  like the, the sort of great product journey of Spotify is how to do

275
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:05,805
Speaker 2:  a lot of things in one app in a way that makes sense, right? And and this

276
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,925
Speaker 2:  is like, this goes back to the question you and I have talked about before

277
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:11,215
Speaker 2:  about like how do you do podcasts and audiobooks and

278
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:15,105
Speaker 2:  music in a single interface in a way that makes sense? And

279
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:17,725
Speaker 2:  I'm still not convinced you're all the way there. I I, I'd be curious to

280
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:21,205
Speaker 2:  hear how you think you're doing. I got chapter three of an audiobook in my

281
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,745
Speaker 2:  release radar, which like you just cannot convince me is a good user experience.

282
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:25,725
Speaker 2:  But that's

283
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,985
Speaker 6:  A great chapter, I promise you.

284
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:31,885
Speaker 2:  I'm sure it was. But I think that question continues

285
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,435
Speaker 2:  to be kind of the big one, right? Like if you want to be the TikTok for audio

286
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:39,005
Speaker 2:  that Daniel has talked about in the past, like you have to figure out how

287
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:41,925
Speaker 2:  to put all these things in one place, but doing it in a way that feels like

288
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:45,665
Speaker 2:  it doesn't compromise each one of them along the way just gets harder every

289
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,755
Speaker 2:  new thing you add.

290
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:50,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So you're, you're completely right that, that there are two dimensions

291
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,925
Speaker 6:  here. One is the who we have to call foreground versus background. So we're

292
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:57,765
Speaker 6:  still a vast majority background service. Sure. Meaning what percentage of

293
00:17:57,765 --> 00:18:01,685
Speaker 6:  the time is the phone in your pocket? Most of the services, to your point,

294
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:04,575
Speaker 6:  they're like You know 90% in the foreground and we're sort of the opposite,

295
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:08,205
Speaker 6:  right? So that's one dimension and that's what we try to find is

296
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:11,765
Speaker 6:  so when the, that phone is in the foreground and you're bored, that's when

297
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:15,445
Speaker 6:  we have to have these tools for you to find a lot of music for that sort

298
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:18,885
Speaker 6:  of 80, 90% background listening. And that's a, that's a tricky balance and

299
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:22,785
Speaker 6:  we, and we rebalance the homepage to reflect too much of the,

300
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,645
Speaker 6:  the time that you're in the foreground, which is the minority. Sure. And

301
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,845
Speaker 6:  sort of focusing on, it still needs to be insanely simple to get to your

302
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:29,725
Speaker 6:  favorite sessions. But

303
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:33,145
Speaker 2:  That thing, and by the way, that user flow you've landed on in which you

304
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,725
Speaker 2:  say basically like I'm in discovery mode, you just like bang bang, bang through

305
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:39,125
Speaker 2:  a bunch of stuff, pick a bunch of stuff you wanna listen to click play and

306
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,525
Speaker 2:  put your phone away. Like that's a very Spotify version of the thing you

307
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:45,125
Speaker 2:  described, right? Like that's much closer to the way that the app has always

308
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:45,765
Speaker 2:  been. Exactly.

309
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:48,845
Speaker 6:  That's that's a plan. And that's where I feel we've landed now. But there

310
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:51,525
Speaker 6:  was a bit of wilderness wandering to get there.

311
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:53,265
Speaker 2:  There always is. Yeah.

312
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:57,005
Speaker 6:  And then the other thing you mentioned is, well a cross content right now

313
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,715
Speaker 6:  there certainly shouldn't be audiobooks chapters in your daily mix or something

314
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:04,645
Speaker 6:  that, that that's just a bug that we need to fix. But there is

315
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:08,525
Speaker 6:  that question of how is You know? Is that the best product

316
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:12,045
Speaker 6:  experience? How much is that a strategy that we need to adopt because it's

317
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:15,765
Speaker 6:  a distribution strategy versus what is best for the, for the consumer. I

318
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:19,605
Speaker 6:  choose to see it as a very interesting challenge and it puts a lot

319
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:23,465
Speaker 6:  of requirements on our experience team, right? Because the challenge

320
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:27,445
Speaker 6:  is in order to keep sort of the complexity as we call it internally to

321
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:31,365
Speaker 6:  keep the entropy down, you need to make things look as similar as

322
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:34,805
Speaker 6:  possible so that it doesn't get very confusing. Right. And and the notion

323
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:38,325
Speaker 6:  is that well it's all audio, right? Music is audio, podcast is audio, audiobooks

324
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:41,175
Speaker 6:  is audio, but then it's also very different. Music is like three minutes,

325
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:44,685
Speaker 6:  audiobooks, maybe podcast, maybe an hour an audiobook, 20 hours or something,

326
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:48,395
Speaker 6:  right? Yeah. So it's also very different. So the the real big challenge

327
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:52,245
Speaker 6:  that we just have chosen to accept given our strategy is to make it sort

328
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:56,025
Speaker 6:  of to consciously misquote Einstein as similar as possible,

329
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:59,915
Speaker 6:  but not more similar than possible. Right. Okay. And so

330
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:03,405
Speaker 6:  what what's an example of that? You know, you can say that it's all cards.

331
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:07,085
Speaker 6:  Like there's an, there's a track card and there's a playlist card and there's

332
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:10,925
Speaker 6:  a, an episode card and an audio book card, which is kind of true. But

333
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:14,165
Speaker 6:  on the other hand we also have to realize where they're different. So, so

334
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:18,065
Speaker 6:  for an example, one thing that we're working with right now is the feedback

335
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:20,805
Speaker 6:  to the algorithm. We, we actually, we've been playing around with giving

336
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:24,155
Speaker 6:  people tools of feedback on the algorithm and it turns out people love that

337
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:27,965
Speaker 6:  even when we had like on the three dots a hidden option, I was amazed at

338
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:31,005
Speaker 6:  how many people found that and said like, I didn't want this recommendation,

339
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:34,685
Speaker 6:  I wanted this. So we're making that easier. But you run into these problems

340
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:38,405
Speaker 6:  where, where it's different. So for example, we're experimenting with these

341
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,765
Speaker 6:  things where you can say like, this is a bad recommendation or, or more like

342
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:45,315
Speaker 6:  I don't want this recommendation You know, which gives the user a way to

343
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:48,645
Speaker 6:  back the fault tolerance to solve when we were wrong quickly. But it also

344
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:51,905
Speaker 6:  gives us a lot of super valuable signal to improve for the user. But then

345
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,845
Speaker 6:  for a podcast episode, it's pretty straightforward. You just say like, this

346
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:57,765
Speaker 6:  was bad recommendation, don't show it again. And we can interpret it as like

347
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:01,665
Speaker 6:  bad recommendation for a playlist. It's tricky because if you say that maybe

348
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:05,245
Speaker 6:  it was that you didn't like the song, but did you not really like the playlist?

349
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:08,065
Speaker 6:  Should we actually show the playlist again, but not with the same songs.

350
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:10,925
Speaker 6:  And then for audiobook, you have a different problem which we realized, which

351
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:14,435
Speaker 6:  is when you say like, sort of thumbs down, it could be

352
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:18,085
Speaker 6:  because you hated this recommendation or it could be because you love this

353
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,325
Speaker 6:  recommendation, but you already listened to the book or read the book years

354
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:23,565
Speaker 6:  ago. Oh, interesting. So we are trying to find the exact balance. We will

355
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:26,925
Speaker 6:  have different controls on all the books and on episodes and on tracks, but

356
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:30,725
Speaker 6:  we also need, need to still make the system similar enough that it makes

357
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:34,205
Speaker 6:  sense as as one app. So this is where we're putting most of our effort and

358
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:37,595
Speaker 6:  and we think we're, we think we're doing a good job if you just look at the

359
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:41,565
Speaker 6:  metrics and and user engagement. But it is kind of the, the strategy

360
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:45,405
Speaker 6:  and path we have now. I always tell the team that the challenge

361
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:48,405
Speaker 6:  is like how do you choose between these things? You know, should we show

362
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:52,285
Speaker 6:  a podcast or an audiobook or music? I choose to say that we're just

363
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:55,045
Speaker 6:  being more honest with ourselves than other companies. So if you think about

364
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:57,965
Speaker 6:  something like Apple, they also have a music app, podcast app, an audiobooks

365
00:21:57,965 --> 00:22:01,765
Speaker 6:  app. It is the same user in front of the iPhone. Sure. The three

366
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:05,205
Speaker 6:  teams treat it as different users, right? And they all try to compete for

367
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:08,755
Speaker 6:  the user, right? But it is the same user, the same 24 hours.

368
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:12,005
Speaker 6:  They're just fooling themselves. There's three different users. We're just

369
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:15,805
Speaker 6:  being honest to ourselves. No, it's the same user. Yeah. So it's, it's it's

370
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:19,265
Speaker 6:  in a way a harder challenge but it's in a way true for everyone. It's just

371
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:23,165
Speaker 6:  one user and we just have to be more explicit about how

372
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:25,925
Speaker 6:  we solve that problem. But the user can't listen to all three at the same

373
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:28,045
Speaker 6:  time anyway. Right. And and I think when people say like if you just had

374
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:31,045
Speaker 6:  three apps, you don't have to worry about it. I'd say like no, it's the same

375
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:34,125
Speaker 6:  David, it's still gonna have to choose between the three apps. So why not

376
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,445
Speaker 6:  solve it in one app if we can. It's just less clicks. That's kind of how

377
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:38,485
Speaker 6:  I think about it.

378
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:41,685
Speaker 2:  I agree. I think this has become a somewhat controversial stance over time,

379
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:45,445
Speaker 2:  but I actually think doing all of these things in one app is the right path.

380
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:49,045
Speaker 2:  I think these sort of wilderness stuff for Spotify so to

381
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:52,505
Speaker 2:  speak, would be the thing where it's like, okay, what what we actually need.

382
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:55,605
Speaker 2:  And I think people accuse Spotify of this more than at least I've actually

383
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:58,865
Speaker 2:  seen it in the wild. But it does seem like one possible endpoint of this

384
00:22:58,865 --> 00:23:02,805
Speaker 2:  is like, how do we mix your favorite songs with

385
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:05,845
Speaker 2:  a bunch of podcasts you might wanna listen to and then we'll throw an audio

386
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:09,795
Speaker 2:  book in there. And to me that's just not even remotely what I want.

387
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:12,365
Speaker 2:  Like sometimes I wanna listen to a book and sometimes I wanna listen to a

388
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:15,895
Speaker 2:  podcast and sometimes I wanna listen to music. I always know

389
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,765
Speaker 2:  which one I want. And for Spotify to guess or try to

390
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,605
Speaker 2:  intermingle them all that strikes me as like borderline impossible to

391
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:24,265
Speaker 2:  do. Well

392
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:27,485
Speaker 6:  So when, when you do that on, if we had three different apps, you would just

393
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:30,345
Speaker 6:  go into three different apps. Right? Exactly. Because you would know, right?

394
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:34,325
Speaker 6:  So the way we solve this is we land you own a homepage where

395
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:37,405
Speaker 6:  we have a pretty good guest, we're trying to, we have these shortcuts, but

396
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:40,165
Speaker 6:  you are in multiple sessions at the same time. So you can actually continue

397
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:42,925
Speaker 6:  in that playlist, you can continue in that audiobook and there's like in

398
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:45,765
Speaker 6:  the middle of that episode or those two episodes you were in. So hopefully

399
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:49,645
Speaker 6:  it's like super easy to, to solve it. But then back to fault tolerant UIs.

400
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:53,165
Speaker 6:  This is also why you see these tabs where you can say like, you click the

401
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,405
Speaker 6:  music tab totally. And then it's music only or the podcast tab or the order

402
00:23:56,405 --> 00:24:00,025
Speaker 6:  books tab. So which which is almost the same as opening the separate

403
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:03,725
Speaker 6:  app. So this is how we're trying to solve it with trying to program for

404
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:07,445
Speaker 6:  you and then have a fault tolerance solution if we're wrong or if your

405
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:11,205
Speaker 6:  intent was super high. But we do statistically see that It

406
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:14,985
Speaker 6:  works that we actually managed to get people to listen to podcasts

407
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:18,445
Speaker 6:  who didn't. And and hopefully the same for audiobooks. So, so it seems to

408
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:21,785
Speaker 6:  work, but I think you, I think it's a statistical question. I think you're,

409
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:25,765
Speaker 6:  you're, you're right, but my h is, it's like 80% of the time or 90 people

410
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:29,325
Speaker 6:  know what they want, but the other, the other 10% of the time are incredibly

411
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,965
Speaker 6:  valuable. 'cause that's when you find this new podcast or book and it's back

412
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:35,725
Speaker 6:  to this like why we need to be 90% recall and 10% discovery and we went wrong

413
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,345
Speaker 6:  with 90% discovery.

414
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:41,325
Speaker 2:  The upside of doing all those things together is you, you can do a

415
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:44,605
Speaker 2:  sort of one-on-one makes three thing where it's like the podcast I listen

416
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:48,525
Speaker 2:  to probably do inform the kinds of books I might like and the kinds

417
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:51,765
Speaker 2:  of music that I listen to probably informs the kind of podcast I like. So

418
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:55,645
Speaker 2:  if you can actually having all of those things together in one place lets

419
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:59,485
Speaker 2:  you do stuff. But that stuff is not

420
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:01,805
Speaker 2:  shove stuff in front of me that I don't wanna listen to, I think. But I,

421
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:03,845
Speaker 2:  I think you're, you're increasingly getting away from that, which I think

422
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:04,465
Speaker 2:  is very good.

423
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:06,545
Speaker 6:  I'm glad to hear that we're trying hard,

424
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:10,445
Speaker 2:  But that also brings me to ai, which I think you're using kind

425
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:13,865
Speaker 2:  of in, in both directions of that, right? Like it seems like the

426
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:17,845
Speaker 2:  AI stuff I'm seeing floating around both what's been released And, what

427
00:25:17,845 --> 00:25:21,745
Speaker 2:  random people are finding in code on Spotify is that both,

428
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:25,565
Speaker 2:  you want to use AI to be smarter and more proactive about what people

429
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,165
Speaker 2:  might want. Like the day list thing I think is really fascinating and the

430
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:32,645
Speaker 2:  names are all deeply weird, put in really interesting ways. Yeah. And then

431
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,845
Speaker 2:  on the other side there's this idea of like, what if you could just make

432
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:38,555
Speaker 2:  a playlist with a prompt? What if you could just sort of declare to Spotify

433
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:42,245
Speaker 2:  what you wanna listen to and it can do that. And that's the kind of thing

434
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:45,545
Speaker 2:  that as far as I can tell, these large language models are relatively capable

435
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:49,525
Speaker 2:  of. That's data that you have. Like that becomes a

436
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:53,365
Speaker 2:  whole new sort of tool for finding stuff to listen to. Again, if,

437
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:56,845
Speaker 2:  if your idea is like get back into the pocket as quickly as you can, that's

438
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:57,955
Speaker 2:  a pretty powerful one.

439
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:00,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, for sure. I I think you're completely right. I'm, I'm very fascinated

440
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:04,405
Speaker 6:  about both of those directions. So, so one way to sort of retell what you

441
00:26:04,405 --> 00:26:07,865
Speaker 6:  said is you could think one way is to You know everyone tries to reduce friction

442
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,925
Speaker 6:  and get even better at predicting what you wanted to do. And, and certainly

443
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:14,695
Speaker 6:  these LMSs help with that in many ways you get larger

444
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:18,325
Speaker 6:  embeddings that makes the content understanding better. So just the recommendations

445
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:22,045
Speaker 6:  of songs get better. In podcast you obviously have the whole

446
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:25,995
Speaker 6:  safety thing. You can now have machines pre-list to the podcast,

447
00:26:25,995 --> 00:26:29,865
Speaker 6:  make sure that we can do safe fix or exploit, which can surface podcast

448
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:33,395
Speaker 6:  to you that we couldn't have done before because we didn't feel

449
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:36,365
Speaker 6:  literally safe e exploring content that we didn't understand

450
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:40,165
Speaker 6:  ourselves. So, so there's just making the recommendations better and hopefully

451
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,885
Speaker 6:  even better at this homepage predicting the right thing, the thing that you

452
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:47,325
Speaker 6:  had in your head. So we reduce friction and we're doing that and we're seeing

453
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:49,805
Speaker 6:  benefits of that. But to your point, I think the other direction is really

454
00:26:49,805 --> 00:26:53,005
Speaker 6:  interesting as well. Sometimes you want more control, like you don't want

455
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:56,805
Speaker 6:  to be sold to everything and so can we build even more powerful tools for

456
00:26:56,805 --> 00:27:00,315
Speaker 6:  you where you can have a lot of fun with the podcast catalog and the music

457
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:04,055
Speaker 6:  catalog. That is something I'm very fascinated about.

458
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,485
Speaker 6:  Can't comment too much about things that aren't live, but you're certainly

459
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:11,005
Speaker 6:  right. That's an area that I think is super interesting and having,

460
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:14,965
Speaker 6:  having a conversation around music with an entity that is

461
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:18,865
Speaker 6:  very knowledgeable about the global music culture. Everything has been written

462
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:22,405
Speaker 6:  on Wikipedia, every concert ever happened, but that also super knowledgeable

463
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:26,275
Speaker 6:  about you because it has your music taste, I think can be a really cool experience.

464
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:30,165
Speaker 2:  That is cool. And how has that changed the way that

465
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:34,005
Speaker 2:  you think about the kind of human machine interaction that

466
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:36,805
Speaker 2:  you've always talked about at Spotify, right? I think like the, the sort

467
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:40,765
Speaker 2:  of human curated playlists with machine help is like a core tenet

468
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:44,405
Speaker 2:  of what Spotify has always been. But if we're headed into this place of sort

469
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:48,285
Speaker 2:  of mass personalization, both that you're bringing to me and that I

470
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:51,805
Speaker 2:  can ask for myself, does that change that dynamic?

471
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:55,765
Speaker 6:  I think over time it probably will if you think

472
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:58,805
Speaker 6:  that the the, the systems are getting more and more

473
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:02,765
Speaker 6:  intelligent, they can do more and more of that. But what we are

474
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,685
Speaker 6:  right now, I think it's still the same world where

475
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,645
Speaker 6:  you, you look at Twitter and you see these 100% automatic things. There

476
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:14,525
Speaker 6:  are very cool demos. You don't see a lot of applications of them. And then

477
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:17,925
Speaker 6:  when you do some, when you apply something, it's actually almost

478
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:21,685
Speaker 6:  always including humans in the loop. It's just that they're m they get

479
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:24,845
Speaker 6:  much more leverage. That's fair. Yeah. So, so for example, if we look at

480
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:28,285
Speaker 6:  something we did recently with the dubbing for example, it's

481
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:30,765
Speaker 6:  quite straightforward. I wouldn't say straightforward, but it's getting quite

482
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:34,675
Speaker 6:  easy to, to use a service to get like a, a pretty good

483
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:38,325
Speaker 6:  translation and a generation of a voice in another

484
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:41,645
Speaker 6:  language. But if you put that to a native speaker, that language, they're

485
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:44,745
Speaker 6:  gonna drop off because the translation is not gonna sound like a podcast

486
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:48,585
Speaker 6:  or it's gonna be like correct grammatically, but very formal. The intonations

487
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:52,385
Speaker 6:  are off. And so what we find is that

488
00:28:52,385 --> 00:28:55,785
Speaker 6:  you need to use these technologies and they're amazing, but you still need

489
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:59,685
Speaker 6:  people in the loop to make it truly great. So we keep

490
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:03,565
Speaker 6:  applying that recipe and we think of it more as getting more

491
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:07,035
Speaker 6:  and more leverage of those people on those people rather than

492
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:09,565
Speaker 6:  replacing more and more of those people, if that makes sense. You know the

493
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:12,565
Speaker 6:  same amount of people, but they can do more and more and more. If you think

494
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:16,005
Speaker 6:  about Steve Jobs old notion of You know the computer is a bicycle for the

495
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:19,685
Speaker 6:  mine. I think the LLM is like, it's like, I don't know, like a

496
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:23,645
Speaker 6:  motorcycle for the mine or a mountain bike or something. It's just that on

497
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:26,325
Speaker 6:  steroids. Yeah. So that's how I, I tend to think about it like that for any

498
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:30,045
Speaker 6:  type of creation. If you're an artist, if You know, I think the big

499
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:34,005
Speaker 6:  benefit of this will be it's an incredibly powerful bicycle for

500
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,125
Speaker 6:  the mine. And, and sure you can automate some things, you can

501
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:40,805
Speaker 6:  do elevator music and so forth. And that's not the interesting part. I think

502
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:43,585
Speaker 6:  the inter, inter interesting part is as augmentation to people.

503
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:46,045
Speaker 2:  No, I I think that's right. And actually the, I'm glad you brought up the,

504
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:50,015
Speaker 2:  the dubbing because that, and kind of on the flip side, the automated transcription

505
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:53,525
Speaker 2:  stuff I think is really interesting because like you said, it, it opens up

506
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,305
Speaker 2:  sort of new avenues both for people to reach people and for like

507
00:29:57,305 --> 00:30:00,965
Speaker 2:  new ways of consuming this kind of stuff. To me, like automated

508
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,785
Speaker 2:  transcription and making podcasts searchable is like incredible. Yeah.

509
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:08,005
Speaker 2:  And we're finally getting to the point where the LLMs are good enough at

510
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,805
Speaker 2:  speech to text that it's actually pretty plausible, which I think is very

511
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:14,685
Speaker 2:  exciting. But I am curious from a, from a creator standpoint, like I, I make

512
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:18,605
Speaker 2:  a podcast and I've been trying to figure out how I feel at

513
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:22,535
Speaker 2:  just like a very personal level about the idea of my

514
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:25,925
Speaker 2:  voice being translated into tons of different languages all over the

515
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:29,885
Speaker 2:  world. And most of me thinks it's very cool. Part of me is sort of horrified

516
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:33,645
Speaker 2:  by it in a way. I can't even totally describe, it just feels odd. It's like

517
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:37,405
Speaker 2:  it's me but it's not me in some way that I can't

518
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:40,685
Speaker 2:  totally wrap my head around. And it feels like in so many ways with ai we're

519
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:44,305
Speaker 2:  headed down that road of, of feelings in a lot of ways.

520
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:48,175
Speaker 2:  But what are you hearing from creators and people who are, are

521
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:51,805
Speaker 2:  using this tech already? Like what do they make of all this new leverage

522
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:52,595
Speaker 2:  you're giving them?

523
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:55,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So as you say, our focus is really on, on helping

524
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:59,185
Speaker 6:  creators, giving them tools rather than trying to replace them. Other people

525
00:30:59,185 --> 00:31:02,485
Speaker 6:  may have that as a strategy, but our, our, our tool is really to try to empower

526
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,825
Speaker 6:  creators, giving them more and more tools and, and dubbing is one of those

527
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:08,885
Speaker 6:  and, and we're working on other tools as well that we think are very interesting

528
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:12,655
Speaker 6:  for creators. But if, if we look at dubbing your notion like it's

529
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:15,765
Speaker 6:  weird in a way, there's a lot of these things I think we're gonna get into

530
00:31:15,765 --> 00:31:19,565
Speaker 6:  that feels weird the next few years. Sure. But from another point of

531
00:31:19,565 --> 00:31:23,345
Speaker 6:  view, if you look at non podcasters, You know book authors and

532
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:27,085
Speaker 6:  TV movies, they've been dubbed for tens of years. That's true. And with

533
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:31,075
Speaker 6:  completely different voices and, and sometimes You know in certain markets

534
00:31:31,075 --> 00:31:34,625
Speaker 6:  with just ducking the original audio, it's like really crappy in a sense.

535
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,635
Speaker 6:  So, so from that point of view, this is just the same but's much more authentic.

536
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:41,045
Speaker 6:  It's really you instead of someone else trying to pretend to be you. So I,

537
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:44,965
Speaker 6:  I, my hunch is podcasters are gonna, are sort of gonna get over

538
00:31:44,965 --> 00:31:48,245
Speaker 6:  that feeling, certainly will be heard from the podcasters we worked

539
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:52,235
Speaker 6:  with is that their fear was the opposite. That

540
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:55,645
Speaker 6:  when we contacted them, they're like, I don't think it's gonna really sound

541
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:59,485
Speaker 6:  like me. Will I have like a, an accent where I sound like a, instead

542
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:03,125
Speaker 6:  of a good Spanish speaker, I sound like a slow American You know

543
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:06,795
Speaker 6:  heavy American accent, right? I just sound dumb. Somehow they're really very

544
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:10,345
Speaker 6:  predictably very concerned about what they appear like in that language.

545
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:14,245
Speaker 6:  So that's what we put a ton of effort on details. Like it's a

546
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:17,455
Speaker 6:  translation not just grammatically correct, but is this what a, this person

547
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:20,485
Speaker 6:  would sound like? What a, is this a relaxed podcast conversation or a formal

548
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:24,445
Speaker 6:  lecture in that other language? Does You know Lex Friedman or Steven Bartlett?

549
00:32:24,565 --> 00:32:28,485
Speaker 6:  Do they sound like they should probably sound in Spanish or do

550
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:31,865
Speaker 6:  they sound like someone who doesn't speak Spanish that well? But if it's

551
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:35,365
Speaker 6:  to Spanish it doesn't sound like them anymore. That's the balance we spent

552
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:38,565
Speaker 6:  a lot of time on and I think we found a good balance, at least they are very

553
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:42,135
Speaker 6:  happy. And and maybe even more importantly, when you look at the Twitter

554
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:46,005
Speaker 6:  feeds, what I take a lot of joy from is almost without a

555
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,845
Speaker 6:  fault. The feedback are like, I'm a native speaker and this

556
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:53,725
Speaker 6:  is amazing, which you don't see that much. I see people saying this is

557
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:56,665
Speaker 6:  amazing. And then you see native speaker saying, actually it's not that good

558
00:32:56,665 --> 00:33:00,445
Speaker 6:  as a native speaker because it's wrong. And, and we really try to put effort

559
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:04,405
Speaker 6:  in was like sort of just quality of production and So I look

560
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:07,565
Speaker 6:  a lot at it's a creator happy, do they feel like what they should sound like.

561
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:10,965
Speaker 6:  But then I also look at the feedback from the native speakers and then obviously

562
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:14,165
Speaker 6:  I look at the episode and when do people drop off if it's not good enough,

563
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:17,925
Speaker 6:  if it's cool but not interesting, people are gonna drop off after to five

564
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:21,405
Speaker 6:  minutes. So that's kind of how we evaluate quality and so far we're

565
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,925
Speaker 6:  very encouraged by by what we're seeing. Yeah.

566
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:27,645
Speaker 2:  What are you telling the, the creators who are trying to figure out how to

567
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,805
Speaker 2:  navigate this stuff? I mean I just think about, we, we've talked a ton about

568
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:32,765
Speaker 2:  like the writer's strike on the Hollywood side and one of the things they're

569
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:36,585
Speaker 2:  worried about is like if you're an actor they can just take your voice

570
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:39,525
Speaker 2:  and never need you anymore. And then I, I listened to like, I was listening

571
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:42,845
Speaker 2:  to Bill Simmons and he's like, oh great, my voice can read our ads and I

572
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:45,215
Speaker 2:  don't ever have to. And so I'm like, well there's the two sides of the coin

573
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:48,645
Speaker 2:  right there. What are you telling folks who are, are trying to figure out

574
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:51,645
Speaker 2:  kind of how to navigate that? Like what, what does it mean that my voice

575
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:54,075
Speaker 2:  is now part of kind of an AI machine?

576
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,595
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I I think it's very much about creator control. I think what you hear

577
00:33:57,595 --> 00:34:01,265
Speaker 6:  Bill Simmons say this is because he feels like he's in control. Sure.

578
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:05,165
Speaker 6:  That's obviously when we do these dubbing things, we

579
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:08,915
Speaker 6:  we get no rights to that creator's voice for any other purpose. Right.

580
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:12,045
Speaker 6:  It's only for that purpose. Exactly. For that translation. So it's their

581
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:15,685
Speaker 6:  voice. I think that's the key. I think people will be fair, would feel very

582
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:19,085
Speaker 6:  uncomfortable, but giving away rights to their

583
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:22,795
Speaker 6:  likeness for like unknown purposes. So for, for us

584
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:25,785
Speaker 6:  back to like You know, we, we try to structure it as narrowly as possible

585
00:34:25,785 --> 00:34:29,625
Speaker 6:  around like your voice for exactly this purpose and, and

586
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:33,365
Speaker 6:  You know it's your episode. So that's how we've solved it and I think

587
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:36,965
Speaker 6:  that's the, that's the fear that creates, I I would feel equally

588
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:40,865
Speaker 6:  concerned if, if someone had the rights to say whatever they wanted with

589
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:41,755
Speaker 6:  my voice.

590
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:42,745
Speaker 2:  Sure. Yeah.

591
00:34:42,745 --> 00:34:46,665
Speaker 6:  And that's also why we've been quite careful. I think that's why OpenAI who

592
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:50,435
Speaker 6:  we, we have worked with has been quite careful 'cause there is that

593
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:53,845
Speaker 6:  potential for abuse and I think that's why this was a good use case to start

594
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:57,085
Speaker 6:  with, where it's very clear that this is something those creators want and

595
00:34:57,085 --> 00:35:00,885
Speaker 6:  it's voluntary and it's, it's, I think un unambiguously

596
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:01,485
Speaker 6:  good.

597
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:04,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, I I that's, that's fair. And I think I, I definitely agree that

598
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:07,645
Speaker 2:  the right way to think about it is like these are, these are tools you can

599
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:11,565
Speaker 2:  give people to use. Not sort of things you're foisting on top of what

600
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:15,365
Speaker 2:  they're already doing. I think that that feels right to me. Yeah. So come

601
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,525
Speaker 2:  back to the ai AI playlist thing for a second because I, I've been thinking

602
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:21,685
Speaker 2:  a lot about DJ and I've been thinking a lot about day lists recently and

603
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:25,085
Speaker 2:  I think dj, which is seems to have done really well. Everybody I talked to

604
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:28,775
Speaker 2:  about DJ thinks it's the coolest thing ever, but it's this very

605
00:35:28,775 --> 00:35:32,495
Speaker 2:  human thing, right? Like it's an AI generated thing that is

606
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:36,385
Speaker 2:  still meant to be sort of a character in my life. Yeah. But then

607
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:40,085
Speaker 2:  on the flip side, day list is just like a super curated list of

608
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:42,845
Speaker 2:  songs, right? Yeah. There are two sort of very different ways of thinking

609
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:46,365
Speaker 2:  about it should both be in there. Do you have a thesis about one or the other

610
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,555
Speaker 2:  that we land on over time? What do you think?

611
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:52,165
Speaker 6:  It's a great question and the truth is we, we don't know yet. Okay. Which

612
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:55,485
Speaker 6:  going to be the future play mode and I think people have different listening

613
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:59,045
Speaker 6:  modes. I still think there's always gonna be a mode where you want exactly

614
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:02,645
Speaker 6:  your playlist that you are you curated You know without our recommendations

615
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:05,565
Speaker 6:  in it or anyone commenting or anything like that. And then I think you're

616
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:09,185
Speaker 6:  gonna want these music sessions sort of like a daily mix or something where

617
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:12,925
Speaker 6:  you're asking for like a specific genre. You kind of know exactly what you're

618
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:16,705
Speaker 6:  gonna get on the genre and style, but not exactly which track.

619
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:19,445
Speaker 6:  But you don't want anyone talking in between the songs, the whole thing.

620
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:22,675
Speaker 6:  It's like a lean back session where it's what we call it like mind busy versus

621
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:26,115
Speaker 6:  mind free. Mm. I like that. And You know when when the mind is busy, music

622
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:28,885
Speaker 6:  fits mind busy 'cause you can think about something else, but then when someone

623
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:32,285
Speaker 6:  starts talking you have to stop thinking about someone else and pay attention

624
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:35,045
Speaker 6:  something else. Pay attention again. And, and this was one of the tricky

625
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:39,005
Speaker 6:  things with the dj. We, we've done some other experiments where we've had

626
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:42,565
Speaker 6:  like these sessions we can talk for a while and then play some music and

627
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:46,275
Speaker 6:  in theory people love it. In practice the problem is like

628
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:49,645
Speaker 6:  it's partially a podcast and you have to pay attention. Then the music comes

629
00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:52,805
Speaker 6:  in you so not start thinking about something else and then it's like, oh

630
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:55,565
Speaker 6:  back now I have to pay attention again. You're switching between like mind

631
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:59,485
Speaker 6:  free and mind busy. And so what we saw in that data was people kind of

632
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:03,005
Speaker 6:  chose, either they listened to the podcast and skipped past the music or

633
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:06,525
Speaker 6:  they kind of did the opposite. So I definitely think we're gonna have these

634
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:10,445
Speaker 6:  music only sessions. And the notion for the DJ was actually taking that

635
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:14,045
Speaker 6:  learning and saying like that this is a music session first

636
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:17,925
Speaker 6:  and foremost the DJ needs to be quick, brief and get out of

637
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:21,795
Speaker 6:  the way. So it's not a podcast about music, it's a playlist

638
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:25,765
Speaker 6:  with some introduction to it. We may at some point do the opposite and have

639
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:29,585
Speaker 6:  a generated podcast about a track where it's like 90% talk and

640
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:33,445
Speaker 6:  10% music. But then it's a different hypothesis, right? But this

641
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:37,325
Speaker 6:  is the the dj, what's the point of this dj? Like why does it even

642
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:41,045
Speaker 6:  need to to talk? Well what we found was that even for the exact

643
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:44,805
Speaker 6:  same playlist, if you say like, Hey David, here's a playlist, these

644
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,845
Speaker 6:  five tracks are gonna come up. And when you look at that playlist, you're

645
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:51,165
Speaker 6:  sitting there thinking like, maybe I do, maybe I don't like that. Maybe it's

646
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:54,545
Speaker 6:  gonna feel like this and so forth. And there was a lot of like choice paralysis

647
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:58,385
Speaker 6:  and the, the kinda weird thing is when when we had the DJ say like, Hey David,

648
00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:01,845
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna take you back to when you were like teenager, I'm gonna play this

649
00:38:01,845 --> 00:38:05,825
Speaker 6:  track. And it's the exact same track that you would've seen in the playlist.

650
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,845
Speaker 6:  You stick around and listen. So there's something about, there's something

651
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:12,675
Speaker 6:  about removing choice and paralysis saying like, okay, just

652
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:16,555
Speaker 6:  take me somewhere where you seem to get inspired and enjoy it.

653
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:19,665
Speaker 6:  Sort of the exact same tracks you might have skipped if we showed you a list

654
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:23,115
Speaker 6:  or what's gonna happen in the future. And we're still not exactly

655
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:26,985
Speaker 6:  sure what that is, but it's very clear it's happening.

656
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:30,765
Speaker 6:  So, I think of this now as the, we have lots of choices. If You

657
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:34,205
Speaker 6:  know what you want or you sort of know what you want, we have genres and

658
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:37,745
Speaker 6:  hundreds of playlist for every type of genre and you have your own playlist.

659
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:40,765
Speaker 6:  We didn't have a good solution for like, hey Spotify, I have no

660
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:44,285
Speaker 6:  idea. So this is the solution for like, I know idea, but I want

661
00:38:44,285 --> 00:38:47,525
Speaker 6:  music and then this is a, this is a really good tool and So I don't think

662
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,005
Speaker 6:  it's gonna switch to a hundred percent. I have no idea. I think you're gonna

663
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:52,355
Speaker 6:  have different moments.

664
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:55,625
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, that makes sense. And that actually brings me to, I'm gonna just,

665
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,525
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna throw thesis at you and I want you to, to agree or disagree and,

666
00:38:58,525 --> 00:39:01,765
Speaker 2:  and tell me why I'm right or wrong, go for it. It seems to me that we've

667
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:05,565
Speaker 2:  gone through this phase in this space where there were a lot of

668
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:07,595
Speaker 2:  betts in a lot of different directions, right? Everybody, everybody went

669
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,445
Speaker 2:  towards trying to figure out how to do exclusive content in

670
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:15,215
Speaker 2:  really cool ways. Everybody tried to build radically different

671
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:19,145
Speaker 2:  kinds of listening experiences. People tried to do live audio

672
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:22,845
Speaker 2:  and it, it seems like we're coming back to the idea that

673
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:26,605
Speaker 2:  actually there is this incredibly cool, interesting

674
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:30,445
Speaker 2:  library of content out there and the job of an app

675
00:39:30,445 --> 00:39:34,235
Speaker 2:  like Spotify or any of your competitors is to find

676
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:37,925
Speaker 2:  ways for me to find that content and that content to find me just sort

677
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:41,905
Speaker 2:  of watching Spotify over the last, I don't know, 24 months. It feels like

678
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:44,805
Speaker 2:  to some extent you, you've kind of wound all the way back to like the core

679
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:47,645
Speaker 2:  competency, which is like, we're very good at telling you what to listen

680
00:39:47,645 --> 00:39:51,485
Speaker 2:  to and it just feels like you, you've pushed back into

681
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:55,385
Speaker 2:  that in new ways over the last year or so. Is that fair?

682
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:57,325
Speaker 2:  Am I totally wrong? What do you think?

683
00:39:57,325 --> 00:40:00,805
Speaker 6:  I think it is fair. I would say that we, we try to get more distinct about

684
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:04,775
Speaker 6:  separating the modes. So the DJ is still in this class. So like it's mostly

685
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:08,715
Speaker 6:  going to play things that we are quite certain

686
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:12,625
Speaker 6:  that you like back to like it's probably gonna be right nine out of 10

687
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:16,395
Speaker 6:  things. And then we need a different solution for when you wanna be exploratory

688
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:19,485
Speaker 6:  when we're only right one out of 10 instead of nine out 10, which is the

689
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:22,585
Speaker 6:  feeds, right? So we try to separate the two instead of having a bad average

690
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:26,425
Speaker 6:  of both. If the DJ was right one out of 10,

691
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:27,785
Speaker 6:  you would churn out, right?

692
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:30,315
Speaker 2:  Or if they're both five outta 10, I'm gonna churn out.

693
00:40:30,315 --> 00:40:33,045
Speaker 6:  Exactly. That's a better point. If they're both five outta 10, both are bad,

694
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:36,525
Speaker 6:  right? So that is true. I think we got more confident that like let's build

695
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:40,085
Speaker 6:  this product for this purpose and this other product for that other purpose.

696
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:43,785
Speaker 6:  I also do think that, back to your questions on ai, in generative

697
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:47,285
Speaker 6:  ai, I have this obsession with as artificial

698
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:50,605
Speaker 6:  intelligence or machine intelligence or whatever you call it is getting more

699
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:53,885
Speaker 6:  and more capable. I've always had this obsession about everyone should be

700
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:57,805
Speaker 6:  able to really have a dj that sounds very natural, but that gets

701
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:01,085
Speaker 6:  more and more intelligent over time so it understands. So the DJ we have

702
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:04,445
Speaker 6:  now, it understands quite a lot about your music taste, but with a lamps

703
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:07,185
Speaker 6:  it will also start to understand a lot about music culture and the world

704
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:10,985
Speaker 6:  And, what happens. It can get more skilled at things like

705
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:14,695
Speaker 6:  mixing and like, I, I really want to build this perfect session

706
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:17,765
Speaker 6:  where you feel like a, a larger percentage of the

707
00:41:17,765 --> 00:41:21,685
Speaker 6:  time you feel like Spotify is almost like a,

708
00:41:21,685 --> 00:41:25,445
Speaker 6:  a friend, a person, a, a dj. I'm just gonna trust them. Then maybe

709
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:28,725
Speaker 6:  instead of 80% of the time you go and choose your playlist, maybe we get

710
00:41:28,725 --> 00:41:32,475
Speaker 6:  down to like 2010, 20% of the time you're gonna have your playlist because

711
00:41:32,475 --> 00:41:35,365
Speaker 6:  it's party or something. But most of the time you're gonna say like, Hey

712
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:39,045
Speaker 6:  Spotify my friend, just play something and I'll

713
00:41:39,045 --> 00:41:42,945
Speaker 6:  feedback. I think that is entirely possible given

714
00:41:42,945 --> 00:41:46,885
Speaker 6:  the insane development of, of intelligence. So

715
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:50,025
Speaker 6:  that's something I'm very passionate about. So I think we're gonna keep investing

716
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:53,925
Speaker 6:  in that. So in that sense, I think your thesis is right. We're getting

717
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:57,485
Speaker 6:  more confident in the ability to recommend and try to program to

718
00:41:57,485 --> 00:42:01,365
Speaker 6:  you, but we still need to find this balance of being fault tolerant and

719
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:05,285
Speaker 6:  give you super easy ways to like say, now you're wrong. Gimme

720
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:06,275
Speaker 6:  control back.

721
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:09,355
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's, that's totally fair. What playlist do you listen to

722
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:10,285
Speaker 2:  most?

723
00:42:10,285 --> 00:42:13,965
Speaker 6:  I actually listen to with you statistically it's, it's the DJ by far that

724
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,635
Speaker 6:  I listen to the most and then I have a set of my, my own

725
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,525
Speaker 6:  curated holders and goalies. I

726
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:20,525
Speaker 4:  Like it.

727
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:23,265
Speaker 2:  I really appreciate you doing this. It's really fun to do this. I ho I I

728
00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:25,925
Speaker 2:  I'm glad we got to make it happen even though we couldn't do it in person.

729
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:28,245
Speaker 6:  Likewise, always fun, happy to do

730
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,955
Speaker 6:  again.

731
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:32,765
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna talk about Streaming

732
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:36,685
Speaker 2:  because there is always something happening in Streaming. We'll be right

733
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:41,815
Speaker 2:  back.

734
00:45:16,995 --> 00:45:20,855
Speaker 2:  All right We're back. We have kind of a grab bag of streaming news this

735
00:45:20,855 --> 00:45:24,635
Speaker 2:  week from Disney to Verizon to Max to Marvel to Netflix. It's a

736
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:28,455
Speaker 2:  lot and it feels like there's a bigger story tying all of

737
00:45:28,455 --> 00:45:32,295
Speaker 2:  it together. Or maybe a couple of them. So I grabbed Alex Cranz to talk

738
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:36,005
Speaker 2:  it through. Hi Alex. Hello. Whenever we have

739
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:39,215
Speaker 2:  streaming things to yell about, it feels important that you and I do it on

740
00:45:39,215 --> 00:45:42,935
Speaker 2:  The Vergecast together. So I'm very happy to do this. The first thing we

741
00:45:42,935 --> 00:45:46,255
Speaker 2:  need to do is we need to, we need to explain the truth to some people about

742
00:45:46,255 --> 00:45:49,695
Speaker 2:  what is going on with Disney. The shortest bit of the history that I need

743
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:53,675
Speaker 2:  to give in order to get into this is what, a week ago now, two weeks ago

744
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:57,595
Speaker 2:  now, Disney and Comcast enacted their agreement

745
00:45:57,595 --> 00:46:00,495
Speaker 2:  for Disney to buy the rest of Hulu from Comcast, which we've kind of always

746
00:46:00,495 --> 00:46:04,455
Speaker 2:  known is gonna happen. That's the history. Explain to me these weird

747
00:46:04,455 --> 00:46:07,975
Speaker 2:  things that have been happening around the Disney internet in the last few

748
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:08,715
Speaker 2:  days.

749
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:12,325
Speaker 7:  So Disney was doing its earnings call the other day and Bob

750
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:15,875
Speaker 7:  Iger said that they're gonna experiment with a beta

751
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:19,565
Speaker 7:  in December combining the content of Hulu and Disney

752
00:46:19,565 --> 00:46:23,375
Speaker 7:  Plus. And that's, I think something we've talked about on The.

753
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:26,415
Speaker 7:  Vergecast was probably gonna be the outcome of all of this. So that was not

754
00:46:26,415 --> 00:46:27,565
Speaker 7:  a surprise to us.

755
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:31,355
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Disney has not hid that fact that ultimately what it was going to do

756
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:34,205
Speaker 2:  was probably combine them all into one streaming service.

757
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:37,055
Speaker 7:  He's been talking about this I think since May very openly that that was

758
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,815
Speaker 7:  his plan. But a lot of outlets, a lot of people have

759
00:46:40,815 --> 00:46:44,455
Speaker 7:  gotten confused by that and assume that one or both of those

760
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:48,055
Speaker 7:  streaming services is gonna go away. And I think like a, A name is probably

761
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,955
Speaker 7:  gonna go away. I think Hulu or Disney Plus is probably gonna get retired,

762
00:46:51,955 --> 00:46:55,225
Speaker 7:  but all the content is still gonna be there. It's just gonna be one app,

763
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:59,095
Speaker 7:  which in the United States is kind of tricky because the Disney

764
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:02,655
Speaker 7:  Plus app in the United States is for babies and the Hulu app is for

765
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:06,605
Speaker 7:  adults. I say that subscribing to both. Yeah, I am baby

766
00:47:06,605 --> 00:47:10,595
Speaker 7:  here. But You know that that one is very much for kids. Your kids

767
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:14,475
Speaker 7:  are less likely to go find two people going at it

768
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:16,045
Speaker 7:  on Disney Plus

769
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:18,415
Speaker 2:  Hulu the one for sex. Like that's the The one

770
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:21,455
Speaker 7:  For sex. Yeah, that's the, I mean honestly in the United States, that's the

771
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:25,445
Speaker 7:  big differentiation. Sure. One is Bone Town, the other population,

772
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:28,815
Speaker 7:  none. It, one of the things that Bob Iger said was he was like, we're gonna

773
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:31,965
Speaker 7:  wait and take a minute because people are gonna need to like prepare and

774
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:35,465
Speaker 7:  think about child protection and stuff so their kids don't go to Bone Town.

775
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:36,725
Speaker 7:  He didn't say Bone Town, but

776
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:38,905
Speaker 2:  That's essentially what it means. Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:47:38,905 --> 00:47:42,245
Speaker 7:  And I think that got people kind of scared thinking that Disney Plus is going

778
00:47:42,245 --> 00:47:46,195
Speaker 7:  away and it's like, no, it's, it's gonna be there so much.

779
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:49,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You're just gonna have to think a little harder about the accounts

780
00:47:49,085 --> 00:47:52,425
Speaker 7:  you set up and make sure that one of 'em, if you don't want your kids

781
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:56,375
Speaker 7:  seeing Handmaid's Tale, that you block that

782
00:47:56,375 --> 00:48:00,235
Speaker 2:  Everything you just said is true and correct. Except, except for one thing.

783
00:48:00,235 --> 00:48:03,875
Speaker 2:  Okay. There is no question about which brand is going to go

784
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:07,845
Speaker 2:  away. It's going to be Hulu. Like I, I don't know how to be

785
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:11,365
Speaker 2:  clearer about this. Like Disney Plus is going to be the name of the

786
00:48:11,365 --> 00:48:15,285
Speaker 2:  service. Hulu is going to be a section of the service that has some

787
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:18,165
Speaker 2:  of that more adult stuff. Maybe it'll be everything on Hulu. Maybe it'll

788
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:21,445
Speaker 2:  just be that more like adult subset of it. Right now there's like FX on Hulu

789
00:48:21,445 --> 00:48:24,145
Speaker 2:  which is like yeah, kind of the way that that works. This is going to be

790
00:48:24,145 --> 00:48:28,045
Speaker 2:  FX on Hulu, on Disney Plus. Like it's gonna be insane. But that's what it's

791
00:48:28,045 --> 00:48:31,645
Speaker 2:  gonna be like. Let's not pretend that there is a possibility that Hulu is

792
00:48:31,645 --> 00:48:34,595
Speaker 2:  like the main Disney brand forever. That's ridiculous.

793
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:35,865
Speaker 7:  I've got a cling to it.

794
00:48:35,865 --> 00:48:39,525
Speaker 2:  Not only is this just like an objectively moral truth of the

795
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:43,235
Speaker 2:  universe, I just wanna read you the thing that Bob Iger said,

796
00:48:43,235 --> 00:48:46,965
Speaker 2:  okay, from the earnings call, we expect that Hulu on Disney Plus

797
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,895
Speaker 2:  will result in increasing engagement, greater advertising opportunities,

798
00:48:49,895 --> 00:48:53,525
Speaker 2:  lower return and reduce customer acquisition costs, thereby increasing our

799
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:57,485
Speaker 2:  overall margins. The beginning of that sentence is we expect that Hulu

800
00:48:57,485 --> 00:49:01,435
Speaker 2:  on Disney Plus, I don't know how to be clear. Like he said it,

801
00:49:01,435 --> 00:49:04,925
Speaker 2:  it's right there. Alex. It's right there. I know. I'm so tired of all of

802
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:08,465
Speaker 2:  these people being like, what if the Disney Plus brand dies? It's not gonna

803
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:09,155
Speaker 2:  die.

804
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,825
Speaker 7:  It's not gonna die. It's fun to think it will.

805
00:49:11,825 --> 00:49:14,885
Speaker 2:  The way I see it and I, I went through, I wound up reading and listening

806
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:18,475
Speaker 2:  to this entire earnings call, which I like super don't recommend as a

807
00:49:18,475 --> 00:49:20,405
Speaker 2:  lifestyle choice. Don't do

808
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:20,945
Speaker 7:  That folks.

809
00:49:20,945 --> 00:49:24,675
Speaker 2:  But what's super interesting to me is Bob Iger at least feels very strongly

810
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:28,285
Speaker 2:  that Disney has two really good brands and it's Disney and it's

811
00:49:28,285 --> 00:49:31,965
Speaker 2:  ESPN. Those are the flagships, those are the monoliths. Those are like the

812
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:35,845
Speaker 2:  things he believes in as brands. Everything else is like

813
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:39,485
Speaker 2:  subservient to those two things. And in an interesting way, he even kind

814
00:49:39,485 --> 00:49:43,385
Speaker 2:  of intimated that ESPN might roll into Disney Plus, like Disney Plus

815
00:49:43,385 --> 00:49:47,215
Speaker 2:  is the thing. It just is good idea, bad idea. It is the answer,

816
00:49:47,215 --> 00:49:47,565
Speaker 2:  which

817
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:50,855
Speaker 7:  Is a better name. Disney Plus or Max for your

818
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:53,685
Speaker 7:  Giant, your Giant Everything App You

819
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:56,015
Speaker 2:  Know what Sucks is, I think Hulu is a better name

820
00:49:56,015 --> 00:49:59,885
Speaker 7:  There. We gonna see Hulu Hulu

821
00:49:59,885 --> 00:50:03,555
Speaker 7:  more captures the what the hell of all of it all. And I

822
00:50:03,555 --> 00:50:07,365
Speaker 7:  like, I think that's one of the things that I'm a little questioning

823
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:10,975
Speaker 7:  myself is Disney Plus has a very firm brand in the United States of

824
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:14,965
Speaker 7:  population zero for Bone Down and, and that's not the case in

825
00:50:14,965 --> 00:50:18,072
Speaker 7:  the rest of the world, but it is very much the case in the United States.

826
00:50:18,105 --> 00:50:21,865
Speaker 7:  And I think like that's gonna be a real challenge for them branding wise.

827
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:25,805
Speaker 7:  But they probably will call it all Disney Plus and be like, now you can get

828
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:29,475
Speaker 7:  ESPN and Hulu there and then in a year everybody's gonna be like, why

829
00:50:29,475 --> 00:50:30,195
Speaker 7:  Hulu?

830
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:34,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Hulu for me has like Google Energy in that.

831
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:37,835
Speaker 2:  It's like, not a word, but it's kind of a word and it's like fun to say and

832
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:41,115
Speaker 2:  it's a very good brand. I've always just really liked it as a, as a word.

833
00:50:41,115 --> 00:50:44,445
Speaker 2:  Like even it's not knowing what it means. It's just a good word. It's

834
00:50:44,445 --> 00:50:48,265
Speaker 7:  A good word. You're like hula, hooping, hula. What? You just dunno.

835
00:50:48,265 --> 00:50:51,925
Speaker 7:  But You know that's where you could get your TV legally for a long

836
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:52,605
Speaker 7:  time.

837
00:50:52,605 --> 00:50:55,605
Speaker 2:  I, I've come to think this strategy sort of makes sense for Disney because

838
00:50:55,605 --> 00:50:59,395
Speaker 2:  like e even if what you're talking about like Hulu equals Bone Town, right?

839
00:50:59,395 --> 00:51:03,285
Speaker 2:  It's gonna be like a checkbox in the Disney app that it's like

840
00:51:03,285 --> 00:51:06,725
Speaker 2:  when you set it up for your family, you're like, my app has Bone

841
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:10,715
Speaker 2:  Town, the kids' apps No Bone Town. Yeah. And it, it's gonna be a pretty

842
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:14,675
Speaker 2:  easy toggle. Like I think where content goes

843
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:18,205
Speaker 2:  over time is gonna be kind of tricky and we've already seen some kind of

844
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:21,525
Speaker 2:  bleeding between the two over time, right? Where like some things are on

845
00:51:21,525 --> 00:51:25,245
Speaker 2:  both services, sometimes they move between like it's already kind of complicated,

846
00:51:25,245 --> 00:51:26,045
Speaker 2:  right? There's

847
00:51:26,045 --> 00:51:29,745
Speaker 7:  Like a whole bunch of Fox films that really shouldn't be on

848
00:51:29,745 --> 00:51:32,925
Speaker 7:  Disney Plus as we think of it today that are currently on Disney Plus and

849
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:36,765
Speaker 7:  you're like, oh no. Like kids are gonna see something. They might see like

850
00:51:36,765 --> 00:51:40,405
Speaker 7:  the top of a boob. Oh no. And like this travesty

851
00:51:40,405 --> 00:51:43,885
Speaker 7:  travesty for the children. So yeah. Yeah. They've already been

852
00:51:43,885 --> 00:51:47,725
Speaker 7:  dealing with this problem and that was why he wanted to Burge the two,

853
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:51,045
Speaker 7:  right? Like he, he doesn't wanna have to think about that and I suspect it's

854
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:54,925
Speaker 7:  gonna be less Bone Town versus No Bone Town and more do you

855
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:57,405
Speaker 7:  want your kids to be able to watch mature rating stuff, right? And do you

856
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,925
Speaker 7:  want your kids to be able to watch like TV 14 and So I think they're gonna

857
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:04,755
Speaker 7:  really clinging to those TV ratings that they've kind of informally adopted

858
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:08,245
Speaker 7:  that they don't actually have to have at this point. Like

859
00:52:08,245 --> 00:52:11,045
Speaker 7:  nobody's telling them these aren't broadcast on television. That's true.

860
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,805
Speaker 7:  They can do whatever ratings they want and they're still out there being

861
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:17,565
Speaker 7:  like, we thought of a good rating for this one at Disney. Which is

862
00:52:17,565 --> 00:52:18,345
Speaker 7:  hysterical.

863
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:22,025
Speaker 2:  But I do think like even in that case having Hulu as the kind of shorthand

864
00:52:22,025 --> 00:52:25,955
Speaker 2:  for like here's all of our sort of adult originals is probably pretty useful.

865
00:52:25,955 --> 00:52:29,125
Speaker 2:  It's like I know what Disney gets me and I know what Hulu gets me and even

866
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:32,125
Speaker 2:  though they're in the same app, being able to kind of split them as I want

867
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:34,165
Speaker 2:  to makes some sense. I think

868
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:37,695
Speaker 7:  What we're really gonna start seeing as we get these more super apps, right,

869
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:41,485
Speaker 7:  which is Max Disney plus whatever Paramount and

870
00:52:41,485 --> 00:52:44,965
Speaker 7:  Peacock end up joining together to make in order to

871
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:48,005
Speaker 7:  compete a, as we start to get these super apps, I think we're gonna start

872
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:51,905
Speaker 7:  seeing kind of the replica of TV that we had before where like

873
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:54,525
Speaker 7:  you knew you had your different channels and stuff. That's something ZZ love's

874
00:52:54,525 --> 00:52:57,125
Speaker 7:  talked about. That's something that like Iger kind of hints at. I think that

875
00:52:57,125 --> 00:53:00,845
Speaker 7:  that that idea, that concept of channels is gonna come

876
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:04,805
Speaker 7:  roaring back and some brand execs

877
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:07,805
Speaker 7:  somewhere are gonna be working their butt off, coming up with a whole bunch

878
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:10,165
Speaker 7:  of new channels or trying to resurrect old ones. Oh

879
00:53:10,165 --> 00:53:14,115
Speaker 2:  That's interesting. So in the like Disney cable bundle universe,

880
00:53:14,115 --> 00:53:18,045
Speaker 2:  Hulu becomes like the HBO right? Prestige adult

881
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:19,625
Speaker 2:  television channel, right?

882
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:23,245
Speaker 7:  You've got FX over still hanging out over there or

883
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:27,205
Speaker 7:  whatever and then like Disney XD for the kids. I think that's what

884
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:30,825
Speaker 7:  it was called. Oh that's interesting. I'm an old So I think it's Disney XD

885
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:33,755
Speaker 7:  and and So I think we're gonna see that sort of thing. You know freeform.

886
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:37,605
Speaker 7:  Well Freeform's Toast Freeform is not gonna survive the next couple

887
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:41,265
Speaker 7:  of years. Correct. But they might still keep that for like that

888
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:45,045
Speaker 7:  ya audience keep that young adult audience there with

889
00:53:45,045 --> 00:53:45,505
Speaker 7:  Freeform.

890
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:49,005
Speaker 2:  You're making me realize now that if you, if you take what Disney is already

891
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:52,685
Speaker 2:  planning on doing like the way you describe and then you add ESPN's on demand

892
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:55,485
Speaker 2:  stuff and even the linear channel which Disney has talked about adding to

893
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:59,255
Speaker 2:  streaming and then you do the same with ABC news, you've just basically recreated

894
00:53:59,255 --> 00:54:02,965
Speaker 2:  60% of the cable bundle. Yes. Like you're one Yes. NBC and

895
00:54:02,965 --> 00:54:06,165
Speaker 2:  CBS broadcast channel away from just the full cable bundle, which

896
00:54:06,165 --> 00:54:07,645
Speaker 7:  Is really, really compelling. Wait

897
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:11,605
Speaker 2:  And Hulu has Hulu with live tv. Yeah, we're just back, this is just, I'm

898
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:15,285
Speaker 2:  just paying Disney for my cable bundle now instead of Comcast. Oh I guess

899
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:19,085
Speaker 2:  this is where we should disclose Comcast is a

900
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:22,735
Speaker 2:  investor in Vox Media through its subsidiary NBC Universal.

901
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:25,645
Speaker 2:  Eli's not here. So I don't have to tell you about the Netflix show that he

902
00:54:25,645 --> 00:54:29,485
Speaker 2:  humble brags about all the time. Alex has Paramount Plus, I don't know

903
00:54:29,485 --> 00:54:33,405
Speaker 2:  like this is we, we have a bunch of complicated disclosures to do here

904
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:34,885
Speaker 2:  but that's, that about covers it. We both

905
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:38,725
Speaker 7:  Spend a lot of money on Streaming already. We do. We watch a

906
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:39,595
Speaker 7:  lot of streaming.

907
00:54:39,595 --> 00:54:42,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Which actually is a good segue to the next thing, which is the other

908
00:54:42,965 --> 00:54:46,715
Speaker 2:  thing that Bob Iger talked about in the earnings call a bunch

909
00:54:46,715 --> 00:54:50,525
Speaker 2:  that also there was some Verizon Netflix Max news on

910
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:54,005
Speaker 2:  this is that the advertising tier of

911
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:57,885
Speaker 2:  streaming continues to boom. Yes. In a way

912
00:54:57,885 --> 00:55:01,555
Speaker 2:  that like kind of surprises me. Like I think Bob Iger said over

913
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:05,515
Speaker 2:  half of new Disney plus subscribers in this last quarter

914
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:08,245
Speaker 2:  were ad supported, which is huge.

915
00:55:08,245 --> 00:55:11,825
Speaker 7:  I don't think that's like, that's not surprising to, to me at all.

916
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:15,225
Speaker 7:  People want things and they want things cheap

917
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:18,965
Speaker 7:  and TikTok and YouTube and everything else has totally prepared people to

918
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:22,165
Speaker 7:  be able to sit through it and broadcast TV has prepared people to sit through

919
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:25,685
Speaker 7:  an ad in order to get the content they want. So that's not

920
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:28,965
Speaker 7:  surprising to me. And I think the most surprising part of it is that advertisers

921
00:55:28,965 --> 00:55:32,685
Speaker 7:  are so eager for it when they do have the ability to micro target on platforms

922
00:55:32,685 --> 00:55:36,605
Speaker 7:  like TikTok and stuff. So that's the part that's

923
00:55:36,605 --> 00:55:40,485
Speaker 7:  surprising. But I guess it's easy, you've got good partners with

924
00:55:40,485 --> 00:55:43,925
Speaker 7:  Disney You know there's gonna be brand safety. You're not gonna have to worry

925
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,545
Speaker 7:  about some weird thing

926
00:55:45,545 --> 00:55:48,145
Speaker 2:  Unlike TikTok and some of the other platforms you're talking about. Yeah.

927
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:48,485
Speaker 2:  You have

928
00:55:48,485 --> 00:55:51,705
Speaker 7:  A lot more safety on something like Disney or Netflix or

929
00:55:51,705 --> 00:55:55,605
Speaker 7:  Max than than you do on social media platforms. So,

930
00:55:55,605 --> 00:55:57,035
Speaker 7:  I get it. Makes sense.

931
00:55:57,035 --> 00:56:00,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's also very funny. Like part of me wonders if part of the appeal

932
00:56:00,885 --> 00:56:04,425
Speaker 2:  of that is just all of these ad agencies have been

933
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:08,265
Speaker 2:  making one specific kind of ad to go next to one specific kind of thing

934
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:11,845
Speaker 2:  for decades. And for a long time it was like, well where do we put that

935
00:56:11,845 --> 00:56:15,525
Speaker 2:  thing now? Yeah. And now Netflix is just like, well instead of putting it

936
00:56:15,525 --> 00:56:19,145
Speaker 2:  next to I, I don't know, like Chicago Fire

937
00:56:19,145 --> 00:56:22,965
Speaker 2:  on television, put it next to Chicago fire on streaming and the

938
00:56:22,965 --> 00:56:26,285
Speaker 2:  ad agencies are like, oh I know how to do that. That works for me.

939
00:56:26,285 --> 00:56:29,205
Speaker 7:  I, I think that's a big part of it. I think it's just like this is a thing

940
00:56:29,205 --> 00:56:31,685
Speaker 7:  they already, all the advertisers already know how to do. They know how to

941
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:35,485
Speaker 7:  sell it Disney, all of these companies know how to how to buy this

942
00:56:35,485 --> 00:56:39,025
Speaker 7:  stuff and and and how to sell it. So everybody's just like, okay, we figured

943
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:43,005
Speaker 7:  it out. And now also instead of broadcast and and

944
00:56:43,005 --> 00:56:46,805
Speaker 7:  cable and dealing with that, we can have it all internal. We can control

945
00:56:46,805 --> 00:56:50,525
Speaker 7:  everything and that makes everything a lot easier and

946
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:54,025
Speaker 7:  cheaper. But also now Disney is gonna

947
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:56,875
Speaker 7:  own all the entertainment you wanna watch.

948
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,355
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like in a really real way.

949
00:56:59,355 --> 00:57:03,285
Speaker 7:  Like Bob Iger is gonna be deciding what scripted TV you watch and that's

950
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:06,935
Speaker 7:  a little Ooh that has me a little concerned. I'm not crazy

951
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:10,595
Speaker 7:  about one company having that much power over what I watch. But

952
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:13,635
Speaker 7:  yeah, I do like how convenient it'll be.

953
00:57:13,635 --> 00:57:17,395
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well one of the things I was reading was basically theorizing

954
00:57:17,395 --> 00:57:21,365
Speaker 2:  that Disney is going to win because it did all of

955
00:57:21,365 --> 00:57:25,325
Speaker 2:  its acquisitions before it became hard to do acquisitions. Both I guess for

956
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:29,085
Speaker 2:  like interest rate reasons, just the way the economy has gone and also

957
00:57:29,085 --> 00:57:32,885
Speaker 2:  like there's more scrutiny over these mergers and acquisitions than there

958
00:57:32,885 --> 00:57:33,765
Speaker 2:  used to be. If

959
00:57:33,765 --> 00:57:37,355
Speaker 7:  You think about it, the, the fact that they were able to acquire Marvel,

960
00:57:37,355 --> 00:57:41,005
Speaker 7:  they were able to acquire E-S-P-N-E-S-P-N led to the

961
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:42,195
Speaker 7:  acquisition of Marvel, right?

962
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:45,915
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then Lucasfilm and Pixar, like the list is crazy.

963
00:57:45,915 --> 00:57:49,625
Speaker 7:  It's insane and it really shouldn't have happened. But it was also, it is

964
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:53,045
Speaker 7:  Bob ER's legacy. It was the thing. Yeah. He did really, really well. He's

965
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:57,005
Speaker 7:  very proud of, I think every, when he was retired for that year and a

966
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,885
Speaker 7:  half or whatever, he spent all of his time going around being like, I did

967
00:57:59,885 --> 00:58:03,725
Speaker 7:  this, I built this, this whole stable of, of assets for

968
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:07,545
Speaker 7:  us and now we can just go mint money and Disney

969
00:58:07,545 --> 00:58:08,035
Speaker 7:  has,

970
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:10,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it was, it worked out super well for a minute. He saw

971
00:58:10,765 --> 00:58:13,085
Speaker 7:  The writing on the wall and was really, really smart about it. Whether or

972
00:58:13,085 --> 00:58:16,765
Speaker 7:  not he should be able to do that, the whole copyright situation, the fact

973
00:58:16,765 --> 00:58:20,005
Speaker 7:  that he's gonna own all of these copyrights and, and

974
00:58:20,005 --> 00:58:23,885
Speaker 7:  aggressively goes and has laws to stop this stuff from

975
00:58:23,885 --> 00:58:26,565
Speaker 7:  like entering the public domain, that's less cool. But, but

976
00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:29,625
Speaker 2:  The thing about that that's weird then is the flip side of that is like Disney

977
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:33,285
Speaker 2:  has lost just an essentially infinite amount of money on

978
00:58:33,285 --> 00:58:37,125
Speaker 2:  streaming now it's betting on this future of like all of this is gonna come

979
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:40,955
Speaker 2:  together. And like I think with the Hulu thing, I see it more than ever

980
00:58:40,955 --> 00:58:44,545
Speaker 2:  like the bundle, the way you describe it is like, oh, that that might work

981
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:48,425
Speaker 2:  and it might make Disney an awful lot of money pretty quickly.

982
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:51,995
Speaker 2:  But also it makes me wonder, can anyone come after Disney?

983
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:55,535
Speaker 2:  Like one of the things in the news this week was that Verizon is going to

984
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:59,185
Speaker 2:  start selling a combination of Netflix

985
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:03,165
Speaker 2:  and Max both ad supported for $10 instead of I think what would

986
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:06,895
Speaker 2:  be $17. And one of the, the theories I saw about that is basically like

987
00:59:06,895 --> 00:59:10,265
Speaker 2:  ordinarily what would happen is these

988
00:59:10,265 --> 00:59:14,245
Speaker 2:  two companies would merge, or two companies like them would merge

989
00:59:14,245 --> 00:59:18,125
Speaker 2:  or they'd find some way to kind of be one and compete in a

990
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:21,995
Speaker 2:  real way head on. But they can't because

991
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:25,455
Speaker 2:  You know gestures broadly the world is what it is. And so they're having

992
00:59:25,455 --> 00:59:29,095
Speaker 2:  to find all these ways to kind of put their pieces together in order to be

993
00:59:29,095 --> 00:59:32,575
Speaker 2:  harder to turn away from. Do you buy that logic? Like is everybody else gonna

994
00:59:32,575 --> 00:59:35,815
Speaker 2:  sort of sneaky bundle because they can't do what Disney is doing? Yeah, I

995
00:59:35,815 --> 00:59:39,595
Speaker 7:  Think they have to. Right. Peacock and Paramount have to bundle

996
00:59:39,595 --> 00:59:43,245
Speaker 7:  or they're gonna be toast. 'cause you've got the three or four big players.

997
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:47,202
Speaker 7:  There's Disney Plus with now 168, 200

998
00:59:47,202 --> 00:59:50,855
Speaker 7:  million subscribers at this point. Just astronomical number. Amazon

999
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:54,615
Speaker 7:  with a similarly astronomical number. But that one's gonna be really curious

1000
00:59:54,615 --> 00:59:57,855
Speaker 7:  'cause how much of that is just people who bought Amazon Prime and how much

1001
00:59:57,855 --> 00:59:59,025
Speaker 7:  of it's actually users,

1002
00:59:59,025 --> 01:00:01,525
Speaker 2:  Which Amazon has never really talked about.

1003
01:00:01,525 --> 01:00:05,055
Speaker 7:  They've never disclosed. So there's always like a little asterisk when you

1004
01:00:05,055 --> 01:00:07,915
Speaker 7:  see them at the top of the list. Then you've got Max and you've got Netflix.

1005
01:00:07,915 --> 01:00:11,855
Speaker 7:  So there's those, those are the big four. Those are effectively your A,

1006
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:15,715
Speaker 7:  B-C-C-B-S-N-B-C and Fox of 2023.

1007
01:00:15,715 --> 01:00:18,975
Speaker 7:  And I think everybody's gonna probably need to subscribe to most of those

1008
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:22,775
Speaker 7:  if they wanna be able to have like intelligent conversations with their friends

1009
01:00:22,775 --> 01:00:26,525
Speaker 7:  about cultural moments. Yeah. And then there's everybody else

1010
01:00:26,525 --> 01:00:30,415
Speaker 7:  Paramount and, and Peacock and, and all these other ones are all

1011
01:00:30,415 --> 01:00:33,495
Speaker 7:  sitting at the bottom underneath them. They're the the WB and the

1012
01:00:33,495 --> 01:00:36,575
Speaker 7:  UPN of of this analogy.

1013
01:00:36,575 --> 01:00:38,685
Speaker 2:  I mean you're not wrong but brutal.

1014
01:00:38,685 --> 01:00:42,015
Speaker 7:  What a move for these guys. And I think the only way they're gonna be able

1015
01:00:42,015 --> 01:00:45,655
Speaker 7:  to compete is, is to start bundling and start offering that. Because right

1016
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:49,595
Speaker 7:  now they're, they're really hedging their betts on being like better at programming.

1017
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:52,965
Speaker 7:  And to their credit, they are much better at programming than

1018
01:00:52,965 --> 01:00:56,575
Speaker 7:  Netflix. Much, much better at it. But I don't

1019
01:00:56,575 --> 01:01:00,415
Speaker 7:  think just being really talented at one thing is going to pull

1020
01:01:00,415 --> 01:01:01,975
Speaker 7:  their butts outta the fire on

1021
01:01:01,975 --> 01:01:04,935
Speaker 2:  This. Yeah. And also the thing we seem to have learned over the last year

1022
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:08,775
Speaker 2:  or so is that Netflix can just spend its way out of any problem that

1023
01:01:08,775 --> 01:01:12,695
Speaker 2:  it has. It just has so much more money that it's like, oh we can't make a

1024
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:16,535
Speaker 2:  good original. We'll go get suits and make it a gigantic hit. Like it

1025
01:01:16,535 --> 01:01:17,285
Speaker 2:  just works.

1026
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:21,155
Speaker 7:  Peacock's out there furious. I think Peacock was the owner of that. Well

1027
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:24,235
Speaker 7:  that's the other thing we're seeing is we're seeing a lot of these companies,

1028
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:27,335
Speaker 7:  You know, AVV said this last year, he said, we're open for business, we're

1029
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:30,285
Speaker 7:  gonna start selling a lot of our properties. Yeah. We don't wanna hold everything.

1030
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:33,695
Speaker 7:  It's not just for us. Like Disney is very much in the business of this is

1031
01:01:33,695 --> 01:01:36,735
Speaker 7:  our ip, this is our brand and you come to us for this IP and this

1032
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:40,535
Speaker 7:  brand Max and Net and, and Peacock and Paramount, not

1033
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:43,915
Speaker 7:  Netflix, but Max and Peacock and Paramount and those kind of competitors

1034
01:01:43,915 --> 01:01:47,435
Speaker 7:  are like, no, we want our brand to go everywhere. And the hopes that eventually

1035
01:01:47,435 --> 01:01:51,315
Speaker 7:  you say, I like this brand enough, I'm gonna come back and pay you. Right.

1036
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:54,915
Speaker 7:  And we'll see how that works. I don't know if it's gonna work,

1037
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:58,545
Speaker 7:  but it definitely means there's more stuff being purchased and moved around,

1038
01:01:58,545 --> 01:02:01,775
Speaker 7:  which is really, really, which is actually crucial to like a

1039
01:02:01,775 --> 01:02:05,695
Speaker 7:  good interesting set slate of content coming out. Because if all the

1040
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:09,295
Speaker 7:  content is being made by four companies who are run by four white

1041
01:02:09,295 --> 01:02:13,175
Speaker 7:  guys who all have very similar tastes and stuff, you're not

1042
01:02:13,175 --> 01:02:15,815
Speaker 7:  gonna get a lot of diversity of content. You're not gonna get a lot of different

1043
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:19,330
Speaker 7:  fun and exciting things happening. And so needing to sell to these smaller

1044
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:22,905
Speaker 7:  ones, needing to keep their breast of that industry moving is gonna be important

1045
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:26,765
Speaker 7:  for that diversity. 'cause otherwise it's just gonna be suits. Grey's

1046
01:02:26,765 --> 01:02:30,705
Speaker 7:  Anatomy, Riverdale, I don't know what are the like the most

1047
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,595
Speaker 7:  Bo like

1048
01:02:31,595 --> 01:02:34,565
Speaker 2:  Fast talking dramatic white people is like essentially what I would call

1049
01:02:34,565 --> 01:02:35,605
Speaker 2:  all of their shit was just

1050
01:02:35,605 --> 01:02:38,955
Speaker 7:  A little Huh. Moments in there. Just a few huh?

1051
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:39,915
Speaker 7:  Moments.

1052
01:02:39,915 --> 01:02:43,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Swelling violins at the end of every episode. That's the, that's how

1053
01:02:43,485 --> 01:02:44,205
Speaker 2:  You know or

1054
01:02:44,205 --> 01:02:44,865
Speaker 7:  Chasing cars.

1055
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:47,365
Speaker 2:  That's actually a, a good segue to the last thing we should talk about, which

1056
01:02:47,365 --> 01:02:51,245
Speaker 2:  is two things happen sort of simultaneously. One was Bob Iger

1057
01:02:51,245 --> 01:02:55,145
Speaker 2:  also said on the Disney earnings call that one of his big focuses

1058
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:58,985
Speaker 2:  is to go back to the film studio. Like the core Disney thing

1059
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:02,755
Speaker 2:  has always been, they develop, like you were saying, characters and movies

1060
01:03:02,755 --> 01:03:06,325
Speaker 2:  that people love. Right? And that that feeds movies, that feeds the theme

1061
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:10,315
Speaker 2:  parks, it feeds the merchandising stuff they do, it feeds everything. And

1062
01:03:10,315 --> 01:03:14,005
Speaker 2:  that in recent years, especially with Pixar and especially with

1063
01:03:14,005 --> 01:03:17,685
Speaker 2:  Marvel, has started to wane. And so what he said

1064
01:03:17,685 --> 01:03:21,455
Speaker 2:  is, I'm gonna go back and really dig into that

1065
01:03:21,455 --> 01:03:24,865
Speaker 2:  space. And on the one hand it's like, okay, you're like an old rich white

1066
01:03:24,865 --> 01:03:28,115
Speaker 2:  guy. Like we've, we kind of know how that goes. But on the other hand, the

1067
01:03:28,115 --> 01:03:31,665
Speaker 2:  Marvels opened this past weekend horrible opening

1068
01:03:31,665 --> 01:03:31,945
Speaker 7:  To

1069
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:35,925
Speaker 2:  The lowest in Marvel history. Right? It was the worst performing box

1070
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:38,685
Speaker 2:  office for a Marvel movie ever.

1071
01:03:38,685 --> 01:03:41,475
Speaker 7:  Ton of asterisks next to it by the way. Yeah.

1072
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:43,095
Speaker 2:  List them for me. Tell me the asterisks.

1073
01:03:43,095 --> 01:03:46,915
Speaker 7:  There was the sag strike. So they couldn't, they couldn't have Oscar winning

1074
01:03:46,915 --> 01:03:50,725
Speaker 7:  Brie Larsson out there having fun with Samuel Jackson getting

1075
01:03:50,725 --> 01:03:54,685
Speaker 7:  you excited for it, which they totally were gonna do. Yep. And so you had

1076
01:03:54,685 --> 01:03:58,515
Speaker 7:  the SAG strike. There was a, there's a, a large group of, of people in the,

1077
01:03:58,515 --> 01:04:02,285
Speaker 7:  that are fans of the MCU that are very upset with the direction of like the

1078
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:04,925
Speaker 7:  more diverse direction that the, the franchise has taken over over the last

1079
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:08,625
Speaker 7:  few years. And so they're all upset that this is starring ladies and

1080
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:12,365
Speaker 7:  not, not dudes. There are some dudes in it, they're great. And

1081
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:16,215
Speaker 7:  then you have, you have the real challenge of just Marvel fatigue.

1082
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:19,665
Speaker 7:  There are so many Marvel movies that came out before and Man in Quantum Mania

1083
01:04:19,665 --> 01:04:23,475
Speaker 7:  is another one that got short shrifted because it came out four,

1084
01:04:23,475 --> 01:04:26,995
Speaker 7:  they had four months to like finish a whole bunch of

1085
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:30,165
Speaker 7:  effects that they were supposed to have like a year to finish. So they had

1086
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:33,925
Speaker 7:  to like rush their finish and that's why it looks like hot

1087
01:04:33,925 --> 01:04:37,245
Speaker 7:  garbage and you're like, oh this is an ugly movie. 'cause nobody has spent

1088
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:40,965
Speaker 7:  the time so they, they've poisoned their brand. Which is a shame because

1089
01:04:40,965 --> 01:04:43,685
Speaker 7:  I think everybody who's going to see it really likes it. I wouldn't be surprised

1090
01:04:43,685 --> 01:04:47,635
Speaker 7:  if the, the scores coming outta the film are pretty high for it.

1091
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:51,285
Speaker 7:  Like not astronomically high, but Disney historically has been really

1092
01:04:51,285 --> 01:04:54,685
Speaker 7:  good at making a movie that even if critics don't like

1093
01:04:54,685 --> 01:04:58,645
Speaker 7:  it, audiences really like it. And the last few, they really didn't

1094
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:02,245
Speaker 7:  have that success. Particularly with Antman and Dr. Strange, they really,

1095
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:06,085
Speaker 7:  really struggled with those cinema scores and So I think Marvel's probably

1096
01:05:06,085 --> 01:05:09,755
Speaker 7:  got much better cinema scores, but it's gotta carry so

1097
01:05:09,755 --> 01:05:13,245
Speaker 7:  much water that I think it's, it's gonna have that horrible

1098
01:05:13,245 --> 01:05:15,465
Speaker 7:  asterisk next to it forever.

1099
01:05:15,465 --> 01:05:19,225
Speaker 2:  Do you think it has a chance, like is the, it feels increasingly with every

1100
01:05:19,225 --> 01:05:23,205
Speaker 2:  one of these, like the Marvel fatigue is just irreversible. Even

1101
01:05:23,205 --> 01:05:26,445
Speaker 2:  the stuff that people mostly seem to agree is good, like low key season two

1102
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:30,325
Speaker 2:  people seem to mostly like doesn't have that like cultural

1103
01:05:30,325 --> 01:05:32,725
Speaker 2:  force that it once did. Do you think we're just done with that phase and

1104
01:05:32,725 --> 01:05:35,445
Speaker 2:  it's time to figure out what's next for Disney and everybody? I

1105
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:38,205
Speaker 7:  Don't think so. 'cause I think what people would need to remember is that

1106
01:05:38,205 --> 01:05:42,195
Speaker 7:  the original MCU with the exception of maybe the first Ironman movie was

1107
01:05:42,195 --> 01:05:46,035
Speaker 7:  just as calculated, was just as well planned out.

1108
01:05:46,035 --> 01:05:49,925
Speaker 7:  Like the reason Captain Marvel as a character exists today was

1109
01:05:49,925 --> 01:05:53,905
Speaker 7:  because they rewrote her in back in like 2011

1110
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:57,445
Speaker 7:  to make her a better character to spit make it produce in

1111
01:05:57,445 --> 01:06:01,285
Speaker 7:  movies Miss Marvel herself. That was one of the reasons Miss Marvel that

1112
01:06:01,285 --> 01:06:04,715
Speaker 7:  character was created was for that same reason, like these characters were,

1113
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:08,445
Speaker 7:  have always been manufactured to sell tickets. Guardians of the Galaxy was

1114
01:06:08,445 --> 01:06:11,885
Speaker 7:  their big, was that first big surprise where they made that film and it did

1115
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,645
Speaker 7:  really, really well. And they're like, oh shit, we could make people care

1116
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:18,485
Speaker 7:  about a sentient raccoon. We can do anything. And that's

1117
01:06:18,485 --> 01:06:21,885
Speaker 7:  still true. But, but if you don't have the marketing behind it and if you're

1118
01:06:21,885 --> 01:06:25,485
Speaker 7:  not making films that are entertaining, 'cause there was a lot of struggles,

1119
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:29,225
Speaker 7:  like early on Marvel struggled with incredible Hulk and the first Thor movie

1120
01:06:29,225 --> 01:06:32,405
Speaker 7:  did not have the strongest cinema scores. And even at the time it was like,

1121
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,565
Speaker 7:  oh, are we gonna get it? And then like they, they knocked it outta the park

1122
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:38,605
Speaker 7:  with the Avengers and everybody's like, okay, nevermind. And so they were

1123
01:06:38,605 --> 01:06:41,985
Speaker 7:  able to kinda weather those bad times before, but they've just had a string

1124
01:06:41,985 --> 01:06:45,885
Speaker 7:  of horrible films that nobody cares about and they're so

1125
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:49,635
Speaker 7:  focused on that crossover concept and that who are you gonna see

1126
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:52,765
Speaker 7:  next that it's, it's just exhausting when it's like, no, just do what you

1127
01:06:52,765 --> 01:06:55,915
Speaker 7:  did at the beginning, tell really goods stories and then it's have Samuel

1128
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,875
Speaker 7:  L. Jackson show up in the last five minutes to be like also

1129
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:02,445
Speaker 7:  this guy showing up next week. Well

1130
01:07:02,445 --> 01:07:04,805
Speaker 2:  And that's one of the, that's one of the things that I, I haven't seen the

1131
01:07:04,805 --> 01:07:08,405
Speaker 2:  Marvels yet, but Byla Hunt did very well is like it's just a good

1132
01:07:08,405 --> 01:07:12,295
Speaker 2:  movie. But also if you're a super fan who has seen everything, it has

1133
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:15,685
Speaker 2:  extra rewards for you. And that was the thing for me that like the

1134
01:07:15,685 --> 01:07:19,445
Speaker 2:  original movies did so well was like

1135
01:07:19,445 --> 01:07:23,365
Speaker 2:  I, I've probably seen 60% of the Marvel movies and it felt like the

1136
01:07:23,365 --> 01:07:27,125
Speaker 2:  longer I went, the more I was being penalized for not having seen them.

1137
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:30,325
Speaker 2:  Whereas at the beginning it was like, if I had seen them, I got 10 more references

1138
01:07:30,325 --> 01:07:34,165
Speaker 2:  that I didn't get before, but it wasn't a huge problem

1139
01:07:34,165 --> 01:07:37,945
Speaker 2:  that I missed a bunch of them. Now it's like if I start watching

1140
01:07:37,945 --> 01:07:41,605
Speaker 2:  one of these movies and I haven't seen 65 other things, none of it is gonna

1141
01:07:41,605 --> 01:07:44,645
Speaker 2:  make any sense to me. And that is, that's too much. We've like, we've lost

1142
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:47,525
Speaker 2:  the plot when we've gotten to there. Like literally lost the plot.

1143
01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:51,165
Speaker 7:  I think Ant-Man and the wasp in Qua into Quantum Mania or whatever the hell

1144
01:07:51,165 --> 01:07:55,085
Speaker 7:  it's called is probably like, that's the turning point because the

1145
01:07:55,085 --> 01:07:58,205
Speaker 7:  original Ant-Man franchise exemplified this better than anything. It was

1146
01:07:58,205 --> 01:08:01,245
Speaker 7:  just like, Hey look, we're doing a really cool thing. And oh, also like it's

1147
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:02,725
Speaker 2:  Paul Rudd, he's so small.

1148
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:06,205
Speaker 7:  Yeah and it's, it's loosely attached to this larger franchise, but you didn't

1149
01:08:06,205 --> 01:08:08,685
Speaker 7:  have to care about it. And then this third one, they were like, you must

1150
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:12,365
Speaker 7:  care about this entire franchise and also this little man

1151
01:08:12,365 --> 01:08:15,925
Speaker 7:  named King. And you're like, what? I don't why stop

1152
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,545
Speaker 7:  it and it looks like shit. So,

1153
01:08:18,545 --> 01:08:22,205
Speaker 2:  But you think we're forever like one or two good Marvel movies from it

1154
01:08:22,205 --> 01:08:24,005
Speaker 2:  being back on top of the world?

1155
01:08:24,005 --> 01:08:27,965
Speaker 7:  I, I think so. Disney is very good at making hits. Disney is better than

1156
01:08:27,965 --> 01:08:31,785
Speaker 7:  just about anybody on the planet at making you care about something and selling

1157
01:08:31,785 --> 01:08:35,485
Speaker 7:  it. So as long as Marvel's invested it's they're gonna, they're gonna do

1158
01:08:35,485 --> 01:08:39,325
Speaker 7:  well. I think what's gonna be curious to see is what lessons they take from

1159
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:43,125
Speaker 7:  their recent failures. It's, it's not lost on me that the last

1160
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:46,715
Speaker 7:  two re like the two biggest recent failures were also led by women

1161
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:50,325
Speaker 7:  that big primary parts of the cast and I I live in ta, constant

1162
01:08:50,325 --> 01:08:53,465
Speaker 7:  terror that they're gonna do what they were always doing in like the, the

1163
01:08:53,465 --> 01:08:57,325
Speaker 7:  two thousands of being like, ugh, the woman led show bombed. So we gotta

1164
01:08:57,325 --> 01:09:01,065
Speaker 7:  kill all things where women lead that kind of group think is really popular

1165
01:09:01,065 --> 01:09:04,745
Speaker 7:  in, in Hollywood and I'm terrified of that happening again.

1166
01:09:04,745 --> 01:09:08,085
Speaker 7:  But Disney knows how to make hits. Marvel is not going away

1167
01:09:08,085 --> 01:09:11,965
Speaker 7:  until Bob Iger who or whoever decides it needs

1168
01:09:11,965 --> 01:09:12,795
Speaker 7:  to.

1169
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:16,325
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. Thank you. All. right, we gotta take a break. Go see the Marvels.

1170
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:18,805
Speaker 2:  Apparently it's great. Charles really liked it. Everybody who sees it seems

1171
01:09:18,805 --> 01:09:21,365
Speaker 2:  really like it. We gotta take a break. We'll kind of come back and do The

1172
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:26,885
Speaker 2:  Hotline

1173
01:11:34,755 --> 01:11:38,495
Speaker 2:  All right Welcome back. Let's get to The. Vergecast Hotline. We take questions

1174
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:42,335
Speaker 2:  every week and we try to answer them as sometimes helpfully as we

1175
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,765
Speaker 2:  can. This week Chris Welch is here to help me. Hi Chris. Hello.

1176
01:11:45,765 --> 01:11:46,755
Speaker 9:  Good to be back.

1177
01:11:46,755 --> 01:11:50,215
Speaker 2:  We got a question about something that I honestly thought we would never

1178
01:11:50,215 --> 01:11:53,895
Speaker 2:  ever in our lives get a question about again on The Vergecast Hotline,

1179
01:11:53,895 --> 01:11:57,695
Speaker 2:  which is MP three players. But first let me just play the question. It

1180
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:00,035
Speaker 2:  comes from Patrick.

1181
01:12:00,035 --> 01:12:03,735
Speaker 10:  Hi Verge team. This is Patrick from Tucson, Arizona. I'm trying to reduce

1182
01:12:03,735 --> 01:12:07,295
Speaker 10:  my reliance on my phone so that when I go to replace it I can get a dump

1183
01:12:07,295 --> 01:12:11,185
Speaker 10:  phone and replace all of its functions with standalone dumb or

1184
01:12:11,185 --> 01:12:14,815
Speaker 10:  semis smartt products. The one feature that's giving me the most

1185
01:12:14,815 --> 01:12:18,135
Speaker 10:  difficulty replacing is the ability to listen to my music from

1186
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:21,855
Speaker 10:  Spotify, my podcasts and my audiobooks in my car in an

1187
01:12:21,855 --> 01:12:25,735
Speaker 10:  easy and automatically updating fashion. It seems that all of

1188
01:12:25,735 --> 01:12:29,075
Speaker 10:  the MP three players that remain on the market are either over

1189
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:32,855
Speaker 10:  $600, at least like the Sony Walkman or under a hundred dollars and

1190
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:36,765
Speaker 10:  limited to playing manually populated offline files. Is it true

1191
01:12:36,765 --> 01:12:40,315
Speaker 10:  that there's just no more mid-market for MP three players?

1192
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:43,285
Speaker 10:  Thanks. I look forward to your insight as always.

1193
01:12:43,285 --> 01:12:47,215
Speaker 2:  Okay. Hmm. I have like an immediate visceral reaction to this

1194
01:12:47,215 --> 01:12:50,935
Speaker 2:  question but I'm curious what your instant thoughts are.

1195
01:12:50,935 --> 01:12:54,855
Speaker 9:  I think the main hangup and problem challenge here is that

1196
01:12:54,855 --> 01:12:58,175
Speaker 9:  podcasts part, like finding an MP three player that'll like automatically

1197
01:12:58,175 --> 01:13:02,135
Speaker 9:  update podcasts is not really what the ones that are out there these

1198
01:13:02,135 --> 01:13:05,815
Speaker 9:  days are for. Like he mentioned you can buy like a Sony Walkman for

1199
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:09,575
Speaker 9:  300 $400 but that's like all Hi-Fi listening gear. It's not

1200
01:13:09,575 --> 01:13:12,495
Speaker 9:  really intended for like casual podcast listening. I don't know. What are

1201
01:13:12,495 --> 01:13:14,815
Speaker 9:  your vibes on the question? What are your feels?

1202
01:13:14,815 --> 01:13:18,415
Speaker 2:  I kind of have come to the point where I think the only reason to buy a

1203
01:13:18,415 --> 01:13:22,385
Speaker 2:  dedicated MP three player is if you really care about

1204
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:26,315
Speaker 2:  Hi-Fi lossless and I think that's a perfectly valid thing

1205
01:13:26,315 --> 01:13:30,235
Speaker 2:  and reason to buy an MP three player if you're worrying about Spotify

1206
01:13:30,235 --> 01:13:34,155
Speaker 2:  and podcasts that is not you and So I kind of think

1207
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:38,075
Speaker 2:  the market for those people for an MP three player is dead

1208
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:41,785
Speaker 2:  To me the answer here is buy a cheap second

1209
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:45,565
Speaker 2:  phone only download the two apps that you need.

1210
01:13:45,565 --> 01:13:48,455
Speaker 2:  Like I don't know, have somebody change your Google Play password so you

1211
01:13:48,455 --> 01:13:52,175
Speaker 2:  can't do anything else or whatever. And then just treat that like your device

1212
01:13:52,175 --> 01:13:56,095
Speaker 2:  basically try to like iPod touch if I a phone that you have. That's the only

1213
01:13:56,095 --> 01:13:58,065
Speaker 2:  answer I can think of that makes sense to me.

1214
01:13:58,065 --> 01:14:01,695
Speaker 9:  Steve, you still can buy like a used iPod touch. That's an option but it's

1215
01:14:01,695 --> 01:14:05,015
Speaker 9:  stuck on iOS 15 I think. So there will come a day where like Spotify no longer

1216
01:14:05,015 --> 01:14:08,935
Speaker 9:  supports iOS 15 and like same for Apple Music, which is very strange to

1217
01:14:08,935 --> 01:14:12,325
Speaker 9:  think about. So at some point the iPod touch will be be left behind. I've

1218
01:14:12,325 --> 01:14:15,125
Speaker 9:  got one, it feels so small these days that it like no longer feels like a

1219
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:15,685
Speaker 9:  phone. I know

1220
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:15,965
Speaker 2:  It's

1221
01:14:15,965 --> 01:14:19,905
Speaker 9:  Really true. It's like so tiny so You know it's got some charm

1222
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:23,645
Speaker 9:  but yeah, software days are probably numbered. There's also, I don't know

1223
01:14:23,645 --> 01:14:26,885
Speaker 9:  if you remember The Mighty player, it's like that iPod shuffle device. Oh

1224
01:14:26,885 --> 01:14:30,725
Speaker 9:  yeah that can sink. That can sink Spotify and like Traps and

1225
01:14:30,725 --> 01:14:34,045
Speaker 9:  podcasts. So that's an option. But you would need a smartphone to sync it

1226
01:14:34,045 --> 01:14:37,445
Speaker 9:  to, so if you want a dumb phone therein lies the problem. But yeah, that's

1227
01:14:37,445 --> 01:14:40,725
Speaker 9:  still out there. I think they cost like 130 bucks so nowhere near the cost

1228
01:14:40,725 --> 01:14:43,805
Speaker 9:  of like a Sony Wman which right again is silly And for nerds like me who

1229
01:14:43,805 --> 01:14:47,165
Speaker 9:  like have like lossless audio libraries of fully

1230
01:14:47,165 --> 01:14:50,855
Speaker 9:  legally You know downloaded music. No question about that. That

1231
01:14:50,855 --> 01:14:52,065
Speaker 2:  Don't worry about it. Yeah.

1232
01:14:52,065 --> 01:14:55,045
Speaker 9:  But yeah for this question I would either like pursue an old iPod touch for

1233
01:14:55,045 --> 01:14:58,485
Speaker 9:  a few years at least it should be good for 1, 2, 3 more years. Or like you

1234
01:14:58,485 --> 01:15:02,285
Speaker 9:  said, buy a secondary phone that's You know does the job. The

1235
01:15:02,285 --> 01:15:05,045
Speaker 2:  Only other thing I could think of, and I did some research on this, like

1236
01:15:05,045 --> 01:15:08,175
Speaker 2:  I, I kind of wish we lived in the world

1237
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:11,365
Speaker 2:  where Spotify's like car thing had been super

1238
01:15:11,365 --> 01:15:15,165
Speaker 2:  successful and it went down this road of building sort

1239
01:15:15,165 --> 01:15:19,005
Speaker 2:  of nichey music gadgets. 'cause I agree we should have more music gadgets.

1240
01:15:19,005 --> 01:15:22,725
Speaker 2:  Like I, I think the idea that my phone is my source of music makes some

1241
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:25,565
Speaker 2:  sense because it's the device I have with me, whatever. But I kind of wish

1242
01:15:25,565 --> 01:15:29,275
Speaker 2:  there were more. And the thing I wish most of all is that

1243
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:33,085
Speaker 2:  some kind of wearable was the answer and there's little bits of

1244
01:15:33,085 --> 01:15:36,835
Speaker 2:  stuff. Fitbit makes some stuff that has some pretty good integrations

1245
01:15:36,835 --> 01:15:40,245
Speaker 2:  with Spotify and geezer and some of these things. A lot obviously depends

1246
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:44,005
Speaker 2:  on which apps you use. Like if, if you use Apple Podcasts, all of this is

1247
01:15:44,005 --> 01:15:47,765
Speaker 2:  moot by an iPod touch. But for some of these things there are like bits and

1248
01:15:47,765 --> 01:15:50,365
Speaker 2:  pieces of it you can get. But like you said, all of these are just phone

1249
01:15:50,365 --> 01:15:54,245
Speaker 2:  accessories. They, they require so much else to do on

1250
01:15:54,245 --> 01:15:57,815
Speaker 2:  your smartphone before you can get it onto your actual dedicated device.

1251
01:15:57,815 --> 01:15:58,165
Speaker 2:  Right?

1252
01:15:58,165 --> 01:16:00,965
Speaker 9:  Like it feels like the Apple Watch should be able to sync with a Mac at this

1253
01:16:00,965 --> 01:16:04,805
Speaker 9:  point in time and You know it's, god knows it's almost 2024

1254
01:16:04,805 --> 01:16:07,685
Speaker 9:  but you still need an iPhone there. So that would solve the problem immediately.

1255
01:16:07,685 --> 01:16:10,445
Speaker 9:  Like like You know buy an Apple watch that could talk to a Mac, you'd be

1256
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:13,325
Speaker 9:  all good but that does not exist. But I would look at The Mighty honestly

1257
01:16:13,325 --> 01:16:16,325
Speaker 9:  You know it looks like an IPO shuffle, it's got some charm, you can wear

1258
01:16:16,325 --> 01:16:18,965
Speaker 9:  it if you want a dumb phone. It kind of fits that, that vibe. But you just

1259
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:22,795
Speaker 9:  gotta figure out like what device will it sync with And I think, I'm sure

1260
01:16:22,795 --> 01:16:26,035
Speaker 9:  he's got some kind of phone lying around that can still You know run Spotify.

1261
01:16:26,035 --> 01:16:28,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah and the good news is, I would think on the phone front, if all you really

1262
01:16:28,885 --> 01:16:32,725
Speaker 2:  want is like Spotify and Pocket Casts or whatever,

1263
01:16:32,725 --> 01:16:35,525
Speaker 2:  I'll plug pocket cast 'cause it's my favorite podcast app. Same, you

1264
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:35,725
Speaker 9:  Don't

1265
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:39,335
Speaker 2:  Need much phone to do that, right? Like you can buy a pretty

1266
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:43,235
Speaker 2:  small, pretty low end, pretty low powered phone I would say as long as

1267
01:16:43,235 --> 01:16:46,245
Speaker 2:  it's relatively modern in its software

1268
01:16:46,245 --> 01:16:50,025
Speaker 2:  capabilities. So it'll last a long time. Yeah. Like to

1269
01:16:50,025 --> 01:16:53,885
Speaker 2:  almost no one what I recommend most of the like one to $200

1270
01:16:53,885 --> 01:16:56,525
Speaker 2:  smartphones out there, but in that range you can get something that's gonna

1271
01:16:56,525 --> 01:17:00,445
Speaker 2:  serve you perfectly fine for these particular cases. If all you want

1272
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:04,355
Speaker 2:  is like a thing to plug headphones into to listen to music, right?

1273
01:17:04,355 --> 01:17:08,265
Speaker 9:  Yeah. That or like check out like a Pixel seven A during the holiday sales

1274
01:17:08,265 --> 01:17:10,445
Speaker 9:  and see if you can get a good good discount on that. Yeah.

1275
01:17:10,445 --> 01:17:13,285
Speaker 2:  Google gives those things away like six times a year. Yeah. You can probably

1276
01:17:13,285 --> 01:17:17,125
Speaker 2:  find one. Any other, are there any other interesting music gadgets

1277
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:19,885
Speaker 2:  out there in the world right now? I feel like there's like is Neil Young

1278
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,995
Speaker 2:  still doing the the Pono thing? Is that

1279
01:17:21,995 --> 01:17:25,765
Speaker 9:  Pono? God, what a time that was to be alive. That's not around

1280
01:17:25,765 --> 01:17:28,925
Speaker 9:  anymore. I mean I'm sure some of my readers are gonna have some very super

1281
01:17:28,925 --> 01:17:32,845
Speaker 9:  niche solutions that are out there, but yeah, off the top of my head I can

1282
01:17:32,845 --> 01:17:36,045
Speaker 9:  think of like Sony makes Cheap Walkmans that aren't that pricey, but those

1283
01:17:36,045 --> 01:17:39,405
Speaker 9:  are the manual loading on music and stuff and so those don't run Android

1284
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,645
Speaker 9:  at all. And so that would not be a good solution. But yeah, I would buy an

1285
01:17:42,645 --> 01:17:46,485
Speaker 9:  old iPod touch secondary phone check out The Mighty for

1286
01:17:46,485 --> 01:17:50,105
Speaker 9:  like a hundred, 130 bucks and see if that'll solve your dilemma.

1287
01:17:50,105 --> 01:17:53,885
Speaker 9:  But yeah, that's a, that's a big challenge to find a device that can sync

1288
01:17:53,885 --> 01:17:56,155
Speaker 9:  your podcasts with a dumb phone.

1289
01:17:56,155 --> 01:17:59,925
Speaker 2:  It's a strange one and I really, I do support the overall theory of

1290
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:02,445
Speaker 2:  trying to take all the things that your phone does instead. Absolutely. Instead

1291
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:05,805
Speaker 2:  of split them out so that it's like instead of having everything with me

1292
01:18:05,805 --> 01:18:09,285
Speaker 2:  all at once in this one device, I can just have the tools that I need and

1293
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:10,725
Speaker 2:  not worry about the rest. Like single

1294
01:18:10,725 --> 01:18:12,835
Speaker 9:  Purpose devices, You know the iPod.

1295
01:18:12,835 --> 01:18:16,755
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Honestly, like I wish the answer was the new

1296
01:18:16,755 --> 01:18:20,455
Speaker 2:  iPod Classic, right? Like integrates with Apple Music and

1297
01:18:20,455 --> 01:18:23,925
Speaker 2:  Apple Podcasts and you can just live your life and that like that's the device

1298
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:24,525
Speaker 2:  I want to exist

1299
01:18:24,525 --> 01:18:27,885
Speaker 9:  Seriously. Part of me will always miss the heyday of the iPod I think to

1300
01:18:27,885 --> 01:18:31,565
Speaker 9:  some degree, but, but this is the world we're in now so you gotta gotta work

1301
01:18:31,565 --> 01:18:32,605
