00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,090
Speaker 1:  fueled by recommendations, maybe from your favorite artists, your

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,990
Speaker 1:  sister-in-law or your friend. Who's so cool. It's actually kind of

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,560
Speaker 1:  intimidating. Grin is the leading influencer marketing

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,040
Speaker 1:  software that allows you to build relationships with creators directly.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,300
Speaker 1:  It's used by top e-commerce brands like Allbirds, skims,

Speaker 1:  I N dot C O.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,180
Speaker 3:  Hey Vergecast listeners it's Nila for the next three weeks on the show. We're

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,710
Speaker 3:  going to be doing some extra episodes on Tuesdays focused on

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,040
Speaker 3:  creators, but in true verge has fashion the

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,030
Speaker 3:  nerdiest parts of the creator economy. We can think of. It's going to be

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,960
Speaker 3:  hosted by verge managing editor, our friend, Alex Cranz. Alex is

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,010
Speaker 3:  here with me right now, Alex.

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,910
Speaker 4:  Hey, very excited to talk to all of the nerds. That's all I've been doing

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,810
Speaker 4:  for the last couple of weeks.

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,630
Speaker 3:  I mean, what else are we here for the first episode of your mini series on

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,330
Speaker 3:  creators is running today, but tell us what the whole series about,

22
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,530
Speaker 4:  Okay. So the idea is that there's a lot of these really cool gadgets out

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,860
Speaker 4:  there that are really awesome, but they've kind of gotten a little stagnant,

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,640
Speaker 4:  like big companies like Logitech and razor. They're not really making these

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,360
Speaker 4:  products that we really want, but there are other people they're weird,

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,170
Speaker 4:  fun, nerdy, creators out there doing this stuff, and they're making it

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,410
Speaker 4:  on YouTube and on Reddit and on their weird own

28
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,220
Speaker 4:  websites. So we went out and we found them and we talked to

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,000
Speaker 4:  them to see like what they're doing, why they're doing it and like

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,340
Speaker 4:  how they're changing these really cool gadgets.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,340
Speaker 3:  I love that. That's very much in our, with us. What's this week's episode

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:44,580
Speaker 3:  about,

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,270
Speaker 4:  So this week's episode, I mean, obviously we had to start with keyboards.

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,990
Speaker 4:  I think there's like no other product out there. That's quite like

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,950
Speaker 4:  proven this theory I had then keyboards. So we talked to some

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,370
Speaker 4:  keyboard people, and we're going to figure out like what's happening in this

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,490
Speaker 4:  space right now. How much has changed in the last eight years

38
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,370
Speaker 4:  and what it's going to look like going forward.

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,300
Speaker 3:  All right, well, first episode about mechanical keyboards. I'm sure this

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,780
Speaker 3:  will cause no controversy at all and no one will have opinions on it. I'm

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,910
Speaker 3:  excited for this one. Take it away, Alex,

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,710
Speaker 4:  If you're still in an office or you're on a zoom call or nobody mutes, you've

43
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,030
Speaker 4:  probably heard this sound.

44
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,050
Speaker 4:  That's a mechanical keyboard, practically ubiquitous in the eighties by the

45
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,500
Speaker 4:  mid nineties, they'd started to fall out of fashion and were being replaced

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,310
Speaker 4:  by much cheaper to make and LaMer to type on membrane

47
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:35,910
Speaker 4:  keyboards.

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,700
Speaker 4:  I don't know about you, but I can feel the unpleasantness of that keyboard.

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,540
Speaker 4:  Just listening to it. A membrane keyboard is squishy and quiet.

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,950
Speaker 4:  A mechanical keyboard is louder, But if you're

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,800
Speaker 4:  typing on it all day, it's a hell of a lot nicer to type on.

52
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,740
Speaker 4:  And in 2010, I had to finally say goodbye to membrane and track down a mechanical

53
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,320
Speaker 4:  keyboard to make me feel like I was typing on a Tandy or an IBM

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,280
Speaker 4:  again, but in 2010 there weren't a lot of options. You could track down one

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,670
Speaker 4:  of those old keyboards and use an adapter to connect it to your computer.

56
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,300
Speaker 4:  Or you could spend a lot of money on something like the apple friendly lineup

57
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,080
Speaker 4:  of keyboards from a terrace. But 12 years later, the keyboard

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,560
Speaker 4:  landscape is a lot different companies like razor,

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,340
Speaker 4:  Logitech and Coursera have huge lineups of mechanical keyboards and

60
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,330
Speaker 4:  newer companies like key crown or something really cool, really affordable

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,080
Speaker 4:  mechanical keyboards for anyone who wants to try them. What

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,070
Speaker 4:  changed between then and now is a whole industry of smaller companies. A

63
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,610
Speaker 4:  lot of which are one person shows has started experimenting with making their

64
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,330
Speaker 4:  own keyboards and all the individual parts of a keyboard, improving that

65
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,050
Speaker 4:  there's a big eager market of people like me willing to open their

66
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,590
Speaker 4:  wallets, to take on something a little more customizable and a little more

67
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,370
Speaker 4:  fun to type on.

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,390
Speaker 4:  I'm a huge keyboard nerd. And I've written about this community a lot,

69
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,620
Speaker 4:  but the space is moving so fast that it's hard to keep up. If you look away

70
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,100
Speaker 4:  for a month, there's a half a dozen new, big names that you have to get to

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,970
Speaker 4:  know so better, understand the space, how it's changed and

72
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,910
Speaker 4:  where it's headed. I reached out to interview Jacob Alexander.

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,440
Speaker 7:  My name is Jacob Alexander. I really liked keyboards a lot.

74
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,770
Speaker 4:  Jacob has over 600 keyboards that has amassed over the

75
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,520
Speaker 4:  last decade. And he's a member of input club, one of the first groups to

76
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,420
Speaker 4:  start making their own mechanical keyboards. Since I first met him way back

77
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,230
Speaker 4:  in 2017, his team has launched the Konos store, which sells mechanical

78
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,220
Speaker 4:  keyboards and he's invented his own switch. That's the key

79
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,470
Speaker 4:  part between the key cap and the keyboard.

80
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,610
Speaker 7:  You better have the halo switch, which is kind of basis of the holy Panda

81
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,810
Speaker 7:  variants. The switches

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,890
Speaker 4:  Look, this guy seriously knows keyboards. So yeah,

83
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,640
Speaker 4:  I had to talk to him again. So here's my interview with

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,510
Speaker 4:  Jacob Alexander.

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,540
Speaker 4:  I feel like you probably have more than 600 keyboards at this point.

86
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,010
Speaker 7:  Absolutely. I

87
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,430
Speaker 4:  Know you started initially kind of as a collector and then you

88
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,390
Speaker 4:  moved into building your own keyboards. Is that the

89
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,110
Speaker 4:  trajectory?

90
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,400
Speaker 7:  Yes, sort of initially I started collected keyboards, but around

91
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,150
Speaker 7:  2009, when I got into the stuff, the older keyboards, the only

92
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,970
Speaker 7:  interest was the ones that you could plug into your computer because what's

93
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,780
Speaker 7:  the use of the keyboard. If you can't type on it. And I got a couple of

94
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,700
Speaker 7:  older keyboards, well, I can't plug the sentence, like, wait a second. I

95
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,900
Speaker 7:  I'm taking computer engineering and a decent engineering school. I should

96
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,380
Speaker 7:  be able to like make this work. So I actually got into kind of

97
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,750
Speaker 7:  the TNC slash R do we know development to reverse engineer protocols?

98
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,210
Speaker 7:  So like when you plug in USB, like how do you reverse engineer it to USB

99
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,990
Speaker 7:  or PST or at T or XD or whatever the heck else. It's

100
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,860
Speaker 7:  some weird esoteric Japanese keyboard. So that's

101
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,190
Speaker 7:  how I got into keyboard development was I want to use the keyboard. That's

102
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,980
Speaker 7:  really cool. And all these things that I'd be like, oh, I'll make cute cats

103
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,590
Speaker 7:  there. I'll never make switches. Let's just use this cool things that were

104
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,490
Speaker 7:  done before. I,

105
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,510
Speaker 4:  And then you started showing off your projects, right?

106
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,430
Speaker 4:  Like you, you, were you on forums mainly.

107
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,210
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So mainly I was on forum, so I was on Geekhack cause I was bored at

108
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,110
Speaker 7:  work one day when I was working in Japan and I had all these keyboards. It

109
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,980
Speaker 7:  really cool though. I was like, well, it's kind of, I don't know, rude of

110
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,460
Speaker 7:  me to like, just keep everything to myself. Right? So like, I want to take

111
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,610
Speaker 7:  pictures and collect the pictures, but keyboards, aren't just a visual thing.

112
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,480
Speaker 7:  Like it's as beautiful as the pictures people take online these days of like

113
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,410
Speaker 7:  fancy keyboards and get decafs. That's not the experience of actually using

114
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,710
Speaker 7:  it. Keyboards are very tactile and very, very functional things. So I started

115
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,600
Speaker 7:  doing keyboard, beat ups in the bay area, initially monthly, and then it

116
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,970
Speaker 7:  went to bi-monthly and then like, as they got larger, I had to make them

117
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,570
Speaker 7:  take longer. Cause it takes too much energy to organize. We've got,

118
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,710
Speaker 4:  So you started kind of showing off your stuff on Geekhack and I think that's

119
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,070
Speaker 4:  how I first heard about you is you had a very, you had a name on Geekhack,

120
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,720
Speaker 4:  like you were known, what was that name?

121
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,710
Speaker 7:  Hot class. So H a T a it came about

122
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,640
Speaker 7:  because of it's somewhat related to martial arts that were

123
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,450
Speaker 7:  hot on a sensor. That's kind of a mispronunciation of that. But at the

124
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,390
Speaker 7:  time when I was picking a name online, talk about like

125
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,410
Speaker 7:  2006 or five, I hate numbers and names. That's like, like

126
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,340
Speaker 7:  one of the things like when you see like 1926 or whatever, like I hate that

127
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,360
Speaker 7:  it has to be no numbers in my name. And so that's kind

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,260
Speaker 7:  of how it came about.

129
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,980
Speaker 4:  So you, you, you kinda got started there and I feel like for you, it was

130
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,580
Speaker 4:  almost a natural evolution from being

131
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,690
Speaker 4:  this guy. Who's just making cool stuff and putting it on the

132
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,590
Speaker 4:  forums and connecting it to these slowly giant collection of

133
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,430
Speaker 4:  keyboards you you'd acquired. When did it start to shift into something that

134
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,950
Speaker 4:  became a business that became like something more?

135
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,270
Speaker 7:  So that was a little bit organic kind of happened as

136
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,140
Speaker 7:  I was doing these meetups, I gave a presentation on KLL.

137
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,770
Speaker 7:  So KLL was kind of like a language DSL for the

138
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,470
Speaker 7:  technical people, the main specific language, like a programming language,

139
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,890
Speaker 7:  just for keyboards to say, like, this is how I want it to my layout. And

140
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,010
Speaker 7:  the purpose of that was so I could use it on all these converters I'd use.

141
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,490
Speaker 7:  I didn't want to make my callback for every keyboard I did. I got paid, I

142
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,190
Speaker 7:  got tired. You had to be Cordy first. And then Cole Mac. And it was a pain

143
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,550
Speaker 7:  in the ass. So I wrote a language to do that. And as I gave a presentation

144
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,400
Speaker 7:  for this, Jesse from keyboard IO walked up to me and they go,

145
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,440
Speaker 7:  do you want to work for me? Like, not really, but at the time I wasn't

146
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,220
Speaker 7:  interested in like working on things. Like, I, I don't even know if I was

147
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,970
Speaker 7:  on an H1B visa yet I'm Kadian. So I, I, there's lots of

148
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,960
Speaker 7:  complications with me, like working for like a small startup,

149
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,640
Speaker 7:  especially cause I just graduated basically. And so I was like,

150
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,390
Speaker 7:  ah, okay. And then a few months later I was also

151
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,380
Speaker 7:  hosting meet ups at a mass stop. We're not dropped. And Andrew

152
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,650
Speaker 7:  who's one of the co-founders of it book club. He approached me and says,

153
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,560
Speaker 7:  Hey, can you make us a keyboard? And so for those that aren't

154
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,770
Speaker 7:  aware the keyboard market at the time was really difficult.

155
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,940
Speaker 4:  What year was this?

156
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,810
Speaker 7:  This would have been 2014.

157
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,980
Speaker 4:  Okay. 2014. I think at that point we just

158
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,700
Speaker 4:  see in like the DAS keyboard was still the main keyboard that people

159
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,650
Speaker 4:  used if they wanted to seem cool. Yeah.

160
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,730
Speaker 7:  Dusky board or Phil CO's. And if you're really cool, you're into real

161
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,630
Speaker 7:  force and you bought them from elite keyboards.com Greg website at the

162
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:21,990
Speaker 7:  time.

163
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,010
Speaker 4:  Absolutely wonderful. So 2014 Andrew reaches out

164
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,780
Speaker 4:  and he asks you to build a keyboard.

165
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,380
Speaker 7:  And the problem was they had these group buys and they would sell out

166
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,130
Speaker 7:  immediately. They could not buy enough keyboards from the manufacturers.

167
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,150
Speaker 7:  And it turns out that they could get quote unquote, black market

168
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,930
Speaker 7:  switches. So cherry was all the giant contracts at the

169
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,170
Speaker 7:  time. So you could only buy it for people who bought these giant orders,

170
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,950
Speaker 7:  like millions and millions of switches at a time. But of course the community

171
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,730
Speaker 7:  is very small. Nobody in the community, you can dos like buy millions of

172
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,600
Speaker 7:  switches, right? And so there are ways to buy these switches in

173
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,410
Speaker 7:  like a gray market area from like Chinese suppliers and things. So they could

174
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,130
Speaker 7:  acquire all the parts for a keyboard, but they could actually build a

175
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,430
Speaker 7:  keyboard. And so they asked you, look, could you, could you please build

176
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,260
Speaker 7:  us a keyboard? And that's where the infinity 60% came on. So I called a couple

177
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,160
Speaker 7:  friends, mechanical engineer, PCB, I entered and I saw for firmware and

178
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,570
Speaker 7:  software overall design and build it.

179
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,630
Speaker 4:  Those keyboards, those initial keyboards were a success like when, when I

180
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,570
Speaker 4:  first met you, it was because people were saying, you've got to talk to this

181
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,320
Speaker 4:  guy. He's incredible. He's doing these great keyboards. And he's

182
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,160
Speaker 4:  building this movement. Was that, was that interactions on those forums

183
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,090
Speaker 4:  was, was working there part of why you had that success?

184
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,660
Speaker 7:  I think so a lot of it has to do with, like you said, my

185
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,230
Speaker 7:  interactions, I was very active at the time on desk

186
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,130
Speaker 7:  three for the desk already awards. By the time I had sort of stopped doing

187
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,700
Speaker 7:  it and there's a fucking get it too. Why later I hit, I had the most

188
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,600
Speaker 7:  awards of anybody at the time. I just kept getting them.

189
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,680
Speaker 7:  And I tried really hard to like make things interesting. So to me, it's,

190
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,010
Speaker 7:  there are collectors who collect things just for collecting things. I don't

191
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,430
Speaker 7:  do that. I collect hands because I'm searching for

192
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,090
Speaker 7:  answers. And I'm looking for information that was kind of like previous and

193
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,420
Speaker 7:  gloss. Like it's, it's keyboard archeology to me at that. That's kind of

194
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,320
Speaker 7:  what it is. And one of the things I'm like really happy to hear

195
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,280
Speaker 7:  about is like when other groups or other random

196
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,940
Speaker 7:  YouTubers or podcasts or streamers started using terms that I

197
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,930
Speaker 7:  point, and that's when I know, like I was like, oh, I actually made a

198
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,900
Speaker 7:  difference in total. Like, so people understand what things are.

199
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,710
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Cause when, when people first started talking about keyboards, we weren't

200
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,220
Speaker 4:  talking about force curves. We weren't talking about, about like the pressure

201
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,820
Speaker 4:  on a key. And now we do. And the first time I saw those curves

202
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,270
Speaker 4:  was you were making them, you you'd built a machine in your

203
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,870
Speaker 4:  space to test these. What are some of the big terms that you kind of

204
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,470
Speaker 4:  coined that I'll now hear from other creators and YouTube and stuff

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,020
Speaker 7:  Interrupted, like force curves and things like that. All those terms, drawing

206
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,530
Speaker 7:  them like forest curves have always existed. They've been like more

207
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,250
Speaker 7:  artistic data sheets, but there's like, in my

208
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,880
Speaker 7:  articles, I referenced like a pretty famous Japanese keyboard or

209
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,640
Speaker 7:  enthusiastic who did a lot of the stuff like that. It was by admiration.

210
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,450
Speaker 7:  Like I want that. That's kind of how I got this up. But a lot of things like

211
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,890
Speaker 7:  switches. So the one that made me really smile was a

212
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,380
Speaker 7:  YouTube person, LTR Liza game reviews.

213
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,970
Speaker 7:  And he talked about a Tandy personal computer and he

214
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,790
Speaker 7:  called the oh and uses Fujitsu, least sprigs switches.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,520
Speaker 8:  I a little bit different than a lot of the photos that I've seen online.

216
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,030
Speaker 8:  But apparently these are Fujitsu leaf Springs, the third

217
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,420
Speaker 8:  generation of them. They're not clicky keyboard keys, but they are pretty

218
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,530
Speaker 8:  darn satisfying.

219
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,860
Speaker 7:  So I'm like, wait a second. He's not a keyboard enthusiast. Why the heck

220
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,070
Speaker 7:  does he know that name? Cause he had to look that up like that. And at the

221
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,370
Speaker 7:  time, the only place you'd find out about that was articles on desktop already

222
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:48,970
Speaker 7:  that I wrote.

223
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,140
Speaker 4:  That's awesome.

224
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,680
Speaker 7:  And so like, it's, it's like little hints like that. It's like I, or like

225
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,340
Speaker 7:  switches and people talk about magnetic separation switches. So one of the

226
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,330
Speaker 7:  cool projects it's today, someone called a risk of

227
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,570
Speaker 7:  fall on the internet. So the voice switches are 3d printed magnetic switches.

228
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,070
Speaker 7:  I don't know if you've seen solos,

229
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,610
Speaker 9:  The body magnet and the stem magnet are attracted to each other. They want

230
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,700
Speaker 9:  to pull each other together. Right. So when you're pressing on the switch,

231
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,210
Speaker 9:  you've got the magnetic separation feeling. So if you've ever held two magnet

232
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,700
Speaker 9:  together and then pull them apart, it's that sort of feeling.

233
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,840
Speaker 7:  So the magnetic separation switches, the idea for a lot of that stuff

234
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,950
Speaker 7:  comes from keyboard. As I kind of discovered from the

235
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,190
Speaker 7:  sixties and seventies, do you need that keyboards? And so I talk about magnetic

236
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,760
Speaker 7:  separation switches. So like those terms I coined because I didn't know what

237
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,510
Speaker 7:  the heck they're called, the people using those terms like that. And to me,

238
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,350
Speaker 7:  that's the fun part. It's like, I I've done my part and sort of got people

239
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,190
Speaker 7:  excited about old things, but keyboard things in general, right?

240
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,520
Speaker 7:  Like I no longer feel like at the time and especially like

241
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,450
Speaker 7:  20 14, 20 15, there are so few people interested

242
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,660
Speaker 7:  in vintage keyboards or making

243
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,470
Speaker 7:  interesting things with switches. So like the handle and Hako switches and

244
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,310
Speaker 7:  all the things I did like is now holy Panda is like a category of

245
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,000
Speaker 7:  switches down

246
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,050
Speaker 10:  And we overlay Hatas. How does hatters forced graph of the

247
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,470
Speaker 10:  Panda over the halo clears. We can clearly see that actuation point and

248
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,300
Speaker 10:  bottom out forces are lower

249
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,260
Speaker 7:  And that's based off the work I did on that slider. It did not exist prior

250
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,800
Speaker 7:  to that. There's a patent on it. And so like, there's all these things to

251
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,040
Speaker 7:  me, like just make me smile. It's like, I've, I've been doing my part in

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,460
Speaker 7:  sort of getting people interested in keyboards, making sure that it gets

253
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,180
Speaker 7:  better. Right? Nope. There's all these things that the larger

254
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,880
Speaker 7:  companies do because they only think about money like that, that at the end

255
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,490
Speaker 7:  of the day, that they just think of what money and their reasons why they

256
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,270
Speaker 7:  do their things, but it still makes it frustrating as someone's like

257
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,520
Speaker 7:  uses tools. Like why can't tools be great.

258
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,810
Speaker 4:  Right. But I find really interesting is when you started doing this, most

259
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,590
Speaker 4:  of the main keyboard manufacturers weren't focused on mechanical keyboards,

260
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,020
Speaker 4:  they all got ignored them. There's I think like a single guy at

261
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,920
Speaker 4:  Corsair who really liked keyboards and would periodically be like,

262
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,580
Speaker 4:  we're going to do a mechanical keyboard at Corsair, but otherwise that was

263
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,480
Speaker 4:  it. And now everybody has a mechanical keyboard. Logic

264
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,410
Speaker 4:  tech has built their own switches. How much of that is because

265
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,630
Speaker 4:  of this kind of movement that you were a part of

266
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,530
Speaker 7:  My main theory on mechanical switches for sort of the

267
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,370
Speaker 7:  mainstream one, th the main initial driving force was

268
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,670
Speaker 7:  e-sports like, that's, that's the, the main part. Like, that's how I got

269
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,300
Speaker 7:  into it. Some famous e-sports players were using some Philco

270
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,900
Speaker 7:  keyboard or whatever it's like, and all of the fans want to use the same

271
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,620
Speaker 7:  thing they're using. Right. It's just like fancies Nike shoes and

272
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,850
Speaker 7:  that kind of stuff. So that's how it got started. And for people who

273
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,300
Speaker 7:  are a little bit more elitist in the community, I was like, ah,

274
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,780
Speaker 7:  e-sports blah, blah, blah, blah. But to me, that's not important. It's more

275
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,530
Speaker 7:  that people are learning like the marketing material, not saying this is

276
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,010
Speaker 7:  a mechanical switch. So if I tell you, ask me what a mechanical switch at

277
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,000
Speaker 7:  2014, he probably wouldn't have known it that right now I can go, I can talk

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,960
Speaker 7:  to almost anybody about keyboards and though vaguely know what

279
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,310
Speaker 7:  a mechanical keyboard is.

280
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,720
Speaker 4:  And they'll say that's pretty good.

281
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,350
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Pretty good or whatever. But it doesn't matter, like before it was

282
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,800
Speaker 7:  by any mechanical keyboard, it will be better than what you have today. Now

283
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,010
Speaker 7:  I was like, oh, well, what kind did I have to ask more questions? So like,

284
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,760
Speaker 7:  you could do better. Like, what are you looking for? Kind of thing. Seeing

285
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,090
Speaker 7:  it actually progress has been very rewarding actually.

286
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,230
Speaker 4:  Was that part of, kind of what drove you to do it? Not just, I

287
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,780
Speaker 4:  know that you, you really care about these switches and stuff, but was it

288
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,620
Speaker 4:  always kind of this backseat desire of wanting to get the

289
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,060
Speaker 4:  bigger companies to pay attention?

290
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,990
Speaker 7:  Yes. That was a really big part of it. And it comes back to my

291
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,860
Speaker 7:  original frustration. Like while small companies build really cool

292
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,460
Speaker 7:  things and definitely should support them at the end of the day, most people

293
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,910
Speaker 7:  don't buy from small companies because they're small. Right. And so

294
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,870
Speaker 7:  having things like a mechanic, he were like, when I first got into

295
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,550
Speaker 7:  mechanical keyboards, this was

296
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,090
Speaker 7:  2007 or

297
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,750
Speaker 7:  eight. At that time I was looking for a computer. And it's like, if money

298
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,410
Speaker 7:  were no object for each part, like if you look for like building a PC, that's

299
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,100
Speaker 7:  how you look at it. You look at the fanciest thing and then you go back and

300
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,050
Speaker 7:  see, like, what can you afford for keyboard? Is this, the fanciest thing

301
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,770
Speaker 7:  was garbage. EA the paint was like some logic tech,

302
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,720
Speaker 7:  rubber, dumb thing with a little screen on it. I typed it out on the store.

303
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,400
Speaker 7:  Like this feels like garbage, but crappy keyboard at work feels better than

304
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,360
Speaker 7:  this thing. And so like, why is that? And like, there were no

305
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,140
Speaker 7:  options. It doesn't matter if I had money or not. There's no options in

306
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,620
Speaker 7:  terms of like, I could buy something. There's also no options for me to search

307
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,780
Speaker 7:  for anything. I had no idea about anything.

308
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,650
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You know, I got into keyboards like in 2009,

309
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,070
Speaker 4:  2010 or something. I think one of my first keyboards was the Mathias. It

310
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,060
Speaker 4:  was their keyboard built for Mac users and it had these outs,

311
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,270
Speaker 4:  mechanical keys. I still have the thing I will never part with it. Cause

312
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,790
Speaker 4:  it was my first one. And I just have this affection for it.

313
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,110
Speaker 4:  And there was no way to talk about these things online. There

314
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,890
Speaker 4:  was no language. The, the, the companies didn't seem to

315
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,550
Speaker 4:  care. And there were these very small groups of people who liked

316
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,630
Speaker 4:  cherry switches or who liked topiary switches. And that was like me and two

317
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,470
Speaker 4:  other people who liked Alps. And that was it. And then it just slowly, this

318
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,400
Speaker 4:  community built up and it seems like it primarily built up in places like

319
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,440
Speaker 4:  dusk authority. Is that accurate?

320
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,610
Speaker 7:  Yes. So like these keyboard communities, they're not built full

321
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,480
Speaker 7:  of people who play games. They're built people who use keyboards and like

322
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,140
Speaker 7:  typing, like initially a large majority of

323
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,130
Speaker 7:  the key card members were actually writers. People who

324
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,940
Speaker 7:  type a lot, also like coders and programmers. They also type a

325
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,840
Speaker 7:  lot. So they, they, they care. And of course, gamers also characters. They

326
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,710
Speaker 4:  Gotta get the speed, the

327
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,370
Speaker 7:  Speed, but there's going to win. But also what's really fascinating about

328
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,030
Speaker 7:  this is that all of these different people have different kinds of

329
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,260
Speaker 7:  requirements and tastes and none of them are wrong. And that what was

330
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,010
Speaker 7:  really interesting about, especially about the early Reddit, I don't know

331
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,790
Speaker 7:  if this is the case anymore, but at one time the art mechanical keyboard

332
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,390
Speaker 7:  was the second boast, positive subreddit next to

333
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,620
Speaker 7:  makeup, because basically it was all, oh, you should just get this skateboard.

334
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,340
Speaker 7:  Oh, you see this one? Like basically there are no wrong answers at that time,

335
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,330
Speaker 7:  because anything you got was better than when you had before. And because

336
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,870
Speaker 7:  the difference is so striking, especially when you got your first mechanical

337
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,740
Speaker 7:  keyboard going from like years of having a terrible one and not being old

338
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,340
Speaker 7:  enough to actually experience what they were before. It was a big

339
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,300
Speaker 7:  shift. Like it's like a, it's a hard moment of like, oh, that's

340
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,510
Speaker 7:  nice. It's like having really nice headphones for the first time. It's like,

341
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,480
Speaker 7:  oh, I'm, that's the money. Lots of money now.

342
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,980
Speaker 4:  And so are you using Reddit? Are you using social media? How are you

343
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,970
Speaker 4:  getting people excited?

344
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,340
Speaker 7:  I like to get people excited through other people. And

345
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,210
Speaker 7:  so like, one of the things I realized, and this was a while ago is

346
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,080
Speaker 7:  that I'm not really scalable online to make posts. Like

347
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,250
Speaker 7:  I really like communicating with people one-on-one because I can,

348
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,150
Speaker 7:  I can see the light in their eyes when they get it. I can tune the

349
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,450
Speaker 7:  analogies to that person. Like I like to get to know the person a little

350
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,410
Speaker 7:  bit and I can like use their prior knowledge to explain to them, but it gets

351
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,370
Speaker 7:  really hard in a written article to do that because you have to talk to the

352
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,240
Speaker 7:  masses, right. Talking to the masses is actually a really hard problem

353
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,960
Speaker 7:  because like you're not talking to the person anymore. And so

354
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,040
Speaker 7:  if I can explain and talk to individual people who are

355
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,000
Speaker 7:  really enthusiastic about things, then they can kind of also promote

356
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,900
Speaker 7:  their thing in their own way. Right. And so like, I really like not

357
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,830
Speaker 7:  being the only like central focal point because it's, I'm only

358
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,430
Speaker 7:  so scalable. I'm not, I, I can't, I can't cloud computing myself.

359
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,540
Speaker 7:  Unfortunately,

360
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,830
Speaker 4:  Kickstarter seems to have been a really big, important tool for

361
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,440
Speaker 4:  input club over the years to get people excited. What about

362
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,260
Speaker 4:  kickstart? Like why is Kickstarter so successful for you guys?

363
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,700
Speaker 7:  The blood's answer of this is they have an audience. There are

364
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,540
Speaker 7:  the largest of the crowdsourcing audiences in terms of

365
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,350
Speaker 7:  services they provide, they're usually a little bit lacking on that. So

366
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,370
Speaker 7:  in order to compete, the other companies tend to give you a little bit

367
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,180
Speaker 7:  more on the services side. Like when we got started Kickstarter, wasn't really

368
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,840
Speaker 7:  viable. Like there's a reason why most hardware Kickstarters end up like

369
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,290
Speaker 7:  failing and flopping. I'll get into that in a second one that's really annoying

370
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,800
Speaker 7:  for arc arc group is they're hard.

371
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,790
Speaker 7:  And there's a lot of things that can fail very easily.

372
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,450
Speaker 7:  Like, oh, everyone knows about the chip shortage. Now that can affect

373
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,560
Speaker 7:  these kinds of projects extremely poorly. Like when we did

374
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,430
Speaker 7:  the white Fox Kickstarter, we had the initial order, but we

375
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,420
Speaker 7:  ended up having to quickly buy an alternate part

376
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,380
Speaker 7:  because apparently the fab burned down and it was going to be a year and

377
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,000
Speaker 7:  a half for them to get more parts.

378
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,930
Speaker 4:  Wow.

379
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,950
Speaker 7:  And I had worked years and years and years on this Ferber just

380
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,880
Speaker 7:  to, just for this part. And there were no alternate parts I'd

381
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,870
Speaker 7:  have to like completely rewrite everything. And I'm like the

382
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,740
Speaker 7:  vehicles, all the testing, all the users, right.

383
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,520
Speaker 7:  As like this was before the pandemic. Right. And so like,

384
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,270
Speaker 7:  I was very well aware of like with the chip short has happened. Like this

385
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,260
Speaker 7:  is really painful. Right. And so you

386
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,980
Speaker 4:  Were like, I know, I know all about chip shortages. Yes.

387
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,700
Speaker 7:  It's not fun. It sucks a lot. And when they come back, they could be

388
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,560
Speaker 7:  2, 3, 4 times the cost when you can get them. And so that

389
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,500
Speaker 7:  this can really affect how, like when you collect money for a Kickstarter,

390
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,490
Speaker 7:  like, can you succeed? Like, do you just pull into your own pocket?

391
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,940
Speaker 7:  You may have already spent half the money or all the money on developing

392
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,360
Speaker 7:  the prototype or gathering materials. Right. So a lot of these

393
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,290
Speaker 7:  Kickstarters, they just can't be good either way. Working with

394
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,530
Speaker 7:  originally Massdrop was nicest because they would actually front the bill

395
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,980
Speaker 7:  for the, like the initial production costs and stuff like that. And then

396
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,620
Speaker 7:  the prototype it got, cause we didn't have any money. We started with zero

397
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,920
Speaker 7:  basically, no seed money at all. Right. So like even with the Kickstarter,

398
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,880
Speaker 7:  you have to get all of the ad and marketing stuff. Like actually

399
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,840
Speaker 7:  getting the word out is a big deal. Like there's a, a measure that be

400
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,320
Speaker 7:  used for like, if a kickstart is actually successful you'll know in the first

401
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,160
Speaker 7:  like 24 hours at that point, generally, if it's does

402
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,640
Speaker 7:  dog good, then he's fine. We'll just cancel it. Wow. And there it goes, all

403
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,550
Speaker 7:  the PR money and most PR firms are vultures.

404
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,750
Speaker 7:  Unfortunately

405
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,830
Speaker 4:  You spend all this money, you spent all this time. And if it's not that first

406
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,570
Speaker 4:  24 hours, you're done. Yeah.

407
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,800
Speaker 7:  Basically you might as well just like pack up and just take your losses.

408
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,500
Speaker 7:  Cause you spent money on that fancy video on all that marketing. You don't

409
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,190
Speaker 7:  get that back. And then there's all of the integration costs with,

410
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,030
Speaker 7:  oh, your fulfillment for actually fulfilling something or like

411
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,660
Speaker 7:  shipping or people like lose packages for whatever reason. It doesn't actually

412
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,300
Speaker 7:  matter. Like all of that back on you because you're a business. So kind of

413
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,020
Speaker 7:  card companies. Don't like you, they like the consumer. So there's all these

414
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,830
Speaker 7:  problems fulfilling with these Kickstarters. But they're interesting. And

415
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,760
Speaker 7:  there's no other mechanism to actually make it happen because a large company

416
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,330
Speaker 7:  is not going to fulfill your dream or like build your thing. And they're

417
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,550
Speaker 7:  not going to give you the time of day. Right.

418
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,510
Speaker 4:  That's wild though. It does kind of continue to baffle

419
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,380
Speaker 4:  me that we have these very large companies that are clearly very aware of

420
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,650
Speaker 4:  what's going on in the keyboard space. They're paying attention. Why aren't

421
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,550
Speaker 4:  they teaming up with you? Why aren't they teaming up with other keyboard

422
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,180
Speaker 4:  creators?

423
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,320
Speaker 7:  So here's an anecdote that I learned kind of offhand

424
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,830
Speaker 7:  from someone else who went to CES this past year,

425
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,000
Speaker 7:  they were talking to was HyperX, which is owned by

426
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,930
Speaker 7:  HP now. And it turns out that HP is not

427
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,800
Speaker 7:  interested in doing anything with, with another like sourcing firms,

428
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,250
Speaker 7:  like an Amazon or Walmart, unless it's like a hundred million dollar deal.

429
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,600
Speaker 4:  So it costs a lot of money

430
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,470
Speaker 7:  So that that's not like an ending PO, they want that PO for a hundred million

431
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,370
Speaker 7:  dollars to go through and then they'll put something behind it. But it's

432
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,210
Speaker 7:  almost impossible to think at that scale, unless you have led an army of

433
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,960
Speaker 7:  MBAs behind you to like actually plan it out, as well as the

434
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,770
Speaker 7:  market research and all this stuff like that. That's not feasible. Like I'm

435
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,100
Speaker 7:  sure that's like a ridiculous number and it's not actually that high, but

436
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,610
Speaker 7:  that's the kind of like hurdles that these large companies end up having.

437
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,310
Speaker 7:  They're like they have their duty to their shareholders. They have to make

438
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,880
Speaker 7:  money. And so the people at the top will do the take the easy stuff first.

439
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,330
Speaker 7:  But if they don't take the chances on, on basically anything.

440
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,960
Speaker 4:  And so that's where we, we, we, we kind of look at you. We look at, we look

441
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,080
Speaker 4:  at Jesse, we look at these other guys making these keyboards to say, build

442
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,270
Speaker 4:  us the small, take the risks, build us a smaller stuff.

443
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,960
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And a lot of the stuff, especially if you look at kind of the, the

444
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,890
Speaker 7:  audio file space, there is a way to be successful by

445
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,820
Speaker 7:  not making a lot of things. You could make a larger impact.

446
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,600
Speaker 7:  That's what like wall street and Silicon valley like is the impact and where

447
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,140
Speaker 7:  people were money. But in terms of you don't have to be a

448
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,950
Speaker 7:  fancy investors startup to have a successful business.

449
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,310
Speaker 7:  They're not the same thing, right? You can, you can have a successful business

450
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,970
Speaker 7:  with a small business right now. It's not sexy. And you can't

451
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,780
Speaker 7:  like proclaim yourself all the time. But if you, if you

452
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,650
Speaker 7:  actually have a vision and you actually want to succeed, do it your way,

453
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,190
Speaker 7:  the way you want it, that's generally the way you want to do it. As long

454
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,700
Speaker 7:  as you can pull it off course, right? You still have to make money at the

455
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,690
Speaker 7:  end of the day. Just a

456
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,530
Speaker 4:  Little bit of money

457
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,290
Speaker 7:  Stuff costs money, unfortunately.

458
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,430
Speaker 4:  Well, thank you, Jacob. This has been an absolutely wonderful

459
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,330
Speaker 4:  conversation,

460
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,720
Speaker 4:  Man. I think he was only talking to Jacob that I really realized

461
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,440
Speaker 4:  how much the space has changed over the years. But while Jacob has given

462
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,430
Speaker 4:  me and hopefully you a really great idea of how much this industry has blown

463
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,370
Speaker 4:  up over the last eight years, I kind of want to know what's happening

464
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,360
Speaker 4:  right this second in the space. There's just a lot of

465
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,960
Speaker 4:  options. Compared to the last time I went on a keyboard buying spree. After

466
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,510
Speaker 4:  the break, we're going to talk to someone who is making the sheer volume

467
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,540
Speaker 4:  of choices in the keyboard world, their actual business,

468
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,820
Speaker 1:  Thanks to grin for supporting this episode. So you and your

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,810
Speaker 1:  business have finally taken the leap into influencer marketing. It's going

470
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,870
Speaker 1:  great. And you're excited to connect with your audience in a powerful new

471
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,770
Speaker 1:  way, but you've noticed you're spending a lot of time on busy work checking

472
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,160
Speaker 1:  to see if the creator has gotten your product, moving through a tangled web

473
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,000
Speaker 1:  of emails and DMS. And now you're wondering, Hey, did that

474
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,930
Speaker 1:  Instagram post they promised ever even go up. Influencer marketing

475
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,830
Speaker 1:  can be super effective, but not if it's a drain on your time. That's

476
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,580
Speaker 1:  where green comes in. Grim is the number one creator management platform.

Speaker 1:  n.co.

486
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,240
Speaker 4:  Okay. We're back to recap. The keyboard industry has

487
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,050
Speaker 4:  exploded. Thanks to people like Jacob Alexander, building the dang things

488
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,130
Speaker 4:  and showing the world. There's a huge market for super customizable mechanical

489
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,730
Speaker 4:  keyboards. It's moved beyond the forums and even subreddits. And they're

490
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,480
Speaker 4:  now Twitch, streamers, YouTubers, even folks on Kik talk, pushing the keyboard

491
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,410
Speaker 4:  agenda and giving us all, some serious keyboard MV to get a

492
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,920
Speaker 4:  better understanding of what's happening right now. I reached out to Julie

493
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,430
Speaker 4:  Muncie,

494
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:46,480
Speaker 6:  Hello, I am Julie Muncie. I am a writer

495
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,060
Speaker 6:  and also a person who builds keyboards.

496
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,810
Speaker 4:  We worked together once upon a time as journalists and Julie's work has appeared

497
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,530
Speaker 4:  on Gizmodo and IO nine and wired. And she's really fantastic

498
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,010
Speaker 4:  when Julie isn't writing about the best lube for your key switches or the

499
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,670
Speaker 4:  best game to play on your PC. She spent an increasing amount of time on a

500
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,660
Speaker 4:  very cool side hustle called keyboard concierge. The

501
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,440
Speaker 4:  keyboard landscape is confusing and for a prize, Julia is trying to help

502
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,220
Speaker 4:  customers navigate it. And hopefully she's going to help me figure out

503
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,940
Speaker 4:  what the space actually looks like right now. So here's my interview with

504
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,600
Speaker 4:  Julie Muncie.

505
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,250
Speaker 4:  Well, I've, I've known you for a couple of, for many years now. And I remember

506
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,590
Speaker 4:  that first time you mentioned you were doing the service. And I was like,

507
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,490
Speaker 4:  that makes a lot of sense because I feel like the keyboard space

508
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,180
Speaker 4:  itself has transformed a lot in the last few years and gotten

509
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,850
Speaker 4:  harder to kind of parse for most people.

510
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,140
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. Over the past few years, it's really exploded.

511
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,010
Speaker 6:  The amount of options have increased dramatically

512
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:52,150
Speaker 6:  and it's a lot to learn and a lot to navigate. You have to learn, you

513
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,930
Speaker 6:  know, not only how to build a thing, but also where to find

514
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,950
Speaker 6:  the parts to build. And you have to follow complex

515
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,100
Speaker 6:  group buys, which are like pre-orders, but worse

516
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,150
Speaker 6:  and all of these things. And it's just, it's a lot.

517
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,290
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, I got, I bet I I've been very into the keyboard community for

518
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,270
Speaker 4:  years. I bought my first mechanical keyboard and like the late two thousands,

519
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,330
Speaker 4:  right before I guess this huge kind of kickoff. But if I, if I

520
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,200
Speaker 4:  take a break from that community for even a year, there's suddenly all

521
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,070
Speaker 4:  these new switches, there's all these new keywords. Like the GMM K

522
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Speaker 4:  was something I had never even heard of. And everybody I talked to, who's

523
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,370
Speaker 4:  a keyboard fanatic. Now. I was like, oh yeah, everybody knows the GMM. K

524
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,210
Speaker 4:  that's the best keyboard you can get. And I'm like, what, what is it? I don't

525
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,510
Speaker 4:  understand what's happening. Do you think there's a reason that it just kind

526
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,850
Speaker 4:  of exploded like this and gotten so complex?

527
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,900
Speaker 6:  I think there are a couple of reasons. I think one reason is

528
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,860
Speaker 6:  that a lot of people like me got into

529
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,820
Speaker 6:  it around the time of the pandemic when it hit, I got

530
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,780
Speaker 6:  my first keyboard ordered a keyboard from a company called IQ next in

531
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,560
Speaker 6:  China. They have really great keyboards. So I ordered it in like

532
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,550
Speaker 6:  January 20, 20. So I was waiting for it for quite a while, as you

533
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,360
Speaker 6:  might imagine. And during that time, I just did a lot of reading

534
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,990
Speaker 6:  and obsessing and hyper fixating and learned about keyboards. And I think

535
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,950
Speaker 6:  a lot of other people did the same. Also video games in the gaming space

536
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,880
Speaker 6:  have been a really big deal here. I think for a lot of people, gaming

537
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,840
Speaker 6:  keyboards have been an entry point that, you know, they

538
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,680
Speaker 6:  get a gaming keyboard. There's the reputation that may or

539
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,550
Speaker 6:  may not be true that mechanical switches, you know, give you better gaming

540
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,510
Speaker 6:  performance and people get into that. And then they want to

541
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,620
Speaker 6:  customize and explore and learn and like

542
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,550
Speaker 6:  all of the gaming keyboards, most of them and okay, this is changing

543
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:49,330
Speaker 6:  now to be fair. But up until like the past year, they're all like

544
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,380
Speaker 6:  black and red and like lime and green and really

545
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,950
Speaker 6:  garish. And if you want a mechanical

546
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,520
Speaker 6:  keyboard to play games on, but you don't want it to look like that

547
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,850
Speaker 6:  up until the past year, you had to go make your own basically.

548
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,470
Speaker 6:  And so that was a big thing. I think there have also been

549
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,280
Speaker 6:  an increase in streamers and content creators in the scene. And I

550
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,710
Speaker 6:  think they both arrived the trend and add to it.

551
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,760
Speaker 4:  I definitely see a lot of Twitch streamers and stuff. I admittedly do not

552
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,240
Speaker 4:  watch a lot of Twitch, but when I do, I do see people are really

553
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,080
Speaker 4:  focused on their keyboards and it's this kind of like nerdiness that reminds

554
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,680
Speaker 4:  me that old movie hackers where it's like these people are just like wanting

555
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,800
Speaker 4:  to, to show themselves, wanting to explore their own

556
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,670
Speaker 4:  personalities in this piece of technology that most of us can't

557
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,610
Speaker 4:  even see. But we definitely hear on a zoom. Is that accurate as

558
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,460
Speaker 4:  this really like this kind of like form of self-expression?

559
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,540
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. I mean, one of the things that initially drew me to

560
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,900
Speaker 6:  mechanical keyboards and kept me getting into them was that like,

561
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,250
Speaker 6:  it was a piece of consumer technology that I use for myself

562
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,060
Speaker 6:  every day that I can understand and build and

563
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,990
Speaker 6:  customize. I mean, you can do that to an extent with gaming PCs,

564
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,500
Speaker 6:  right? But they're complicated and very expensive keyboards are

565
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,400
Speaker 6:  expensive, but not as expensive as a good gaming PC. And it's

566
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,300
Speaker 6:  a thing where you, you know, w some time you can understand them well enough

567
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,810
Speaker 6:  that you can be designing your own keyboard PCBs, if you want to.

568
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,920
Speaker 6:  I not quite smart enough for this haven't cracked that yet, but a lot of

569
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,700
Speaker 6:  people have, and you can do all of these things. So it's very much,

570
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,450
Speaker 6:  it becomes this piece of tech that you can understand

571
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,050
Speaker 6:  and customize and build yourself and have ownership of. And then there's

572
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,980
Speaker 6:  very few other pieces of technology we use nowadays

573
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:40,340
Speaker 6:  that has that allure and that power and that like,

574
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,360
Speaker 6:  customizability that sense that this is mine and I own it.

575
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,180
Speaker 6:  And I understand and picked every single part of it.

576
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,110
Speaker 4:  When you entered into the space and you realized there was kind of this

577
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,100
Speaker 4:  need, was it just only yourself that, that, that drove

578
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,250
Speaker 4:  this? Like you realized how hard it is and you're like, I want to help others.

579
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,040
Speaker 4:  Or were you finding other people really having this difficulty too?

580
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,480
Speaker 6:  A couple of things first was I did it become a part of a

581
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,470
Speaker 6:  keyboard community that a Milo worked on and then joined. And actually

582
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:13,250
Speaker 6:  I'm a mod there now at mint Lada because acute keyboard

583
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,090
Speaker 6:  club just scored. It's a great, and so a lot of people talking, asking

584
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:21,020
Speaker 6:  questions and just realizing that there's a big barrier to entry,

585
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,770
Speaker 6:  a lot of learning. And I had to do a lot of research and I

586
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,640
Speaker 6:  became very fascinated by it and just learned

587
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,390
Speaker 6:  all these things. And then I came up to a couple of problems. The first

588
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,840
Speaker 6:  problem was that I didn't have the money to do all the building I wanted

589
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,220
Speaker 6:  to do. And the second thing was, I saw that

590
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,640
Speaker 6:  there were people in the space who will help others build

591
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,390
Speaker 6:  keyboards, but they tend to be big streamers people

592
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:51,320
Speaker 6:  like Tahoe types go and make these really, really nice

593
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,100
Speaker 6:  keyboards in front of a large audience. And they make a lot

594
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,490
Speaker 6:  of commissions and they make the rest of their money off of streaming.

595
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,390
Speaker 11:  What am I cutting? Oh, yes. I forgot to explain. So your stabilizers come

596
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,080
Speaker 11:  like this, so you can see how there's these two little prongs that are

597
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,150
Speaker 11:  sticking out. So when you bought them,

598
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,230
Speaker 6:  And this is really cool, but it's deeply inaccessible to just a normal person

599
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,290
Speaker 6:  who wants to build a keyboard. You're probably not going to get Teo types

600
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,500
Speaker 6:  or one of them to build you a keyboard. So I thought I could do a similar

601
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,130
Speaker 6:  sort of building service, but on a much smaller

602
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,120
Speaker 6:  scale. And that's where it really originated from, from

603
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,110
Speaker 6:  wanting to build, but not having the money to build a bunch of

604
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,920
Speaker 6:  projects myself. Cause it does get real expensive real quick. And like I

605
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,980
Speaker 6:  said, my day job is a writer, so I not making it bank

606
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,610
Speaker 6:  and seeing that people were doing this work. And the other thing was

607
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,480
Speaker 6:  just the recognition that I had built all of this

608
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,410
Speaker 6:  knowledge and that I was not bad at this and that it took a

609
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,310
Speaker 6:  lot of time and effort and that a lot of people like these things, but

610
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,240
Speaker 6:  don't have that time or just don't care enough. And that it might be fun

611
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,890
Speaker 6:  to share that knowledge with other people.

612
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,370
Speaker 4:  You mentioned you, you kind of were in this discourse group. I definitely

613
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,570
Speaker 4:  have spent so much time in the mechanical keyboard, subreddit.

614
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,830
Speaker 4:  How are these communities kind of like escalating this

615
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,110
Speaker 4:  attention? The mechanical keyboards are receiving?

616
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,310
Speaker 6:  I think part of it is just that there are more and more

617
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,790
Speaker 6:  eyes on these communities and that is drawing in

618
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,450
Speaker 6:  bigger corporate players and hobbyists and people who

619
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,720
Speaker 6:  think that there's something interesting here and maybe a way to make money

620
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,590
Speaker 6:  here. And maybe a lot of money here like razor. If you look at their

621
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,100
Speaker 6:  offerings over the past few years, they've become more and more

622
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,460
Speaker 6:  interested in trying to release prestige products that

623
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,360
Speaker 6:  core, the more snobby mechanical keyboard,

624
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,900
Speaker 6:  hobbyists that look different and have different

625
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,740
Speaker 6:  switches and like achieve a certain field

626
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,700
Speaker 6:  that hobbyists really want. Because I think V these companies have seen how

627
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,360
Speaker 6:  much money people spend on these things. And like you have players

628
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,810
Speaker 6:  like glorious, which you mentioned the G MMK. And

629
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,980
Speaker 6:  that is a company that is building itself as a bigger and

630
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,790
Speaker 6:  bigger brand in the peripheral space and doing it largely

631
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:12,690
Speaker 6:  off of the back of interest in mechanical keyboards. So I think a

632
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,560
Speaker 6:  lot of it is corporate tech realizing that there's money here,

633
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,030
Speaker 6:  which, you know, that's both a good and a bad thing for the hobbyist.

634
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,930
Speaker 6:  And another is I think, you know, the interest in the

635
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,560
Speaker 6:  hobby moving beyond the white nerd

636
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,220
Speaker 6:  gamer boy crew, which of course has caused a lot of friction in the

637
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,580
Speaker 6:  community. There's, you know, people who love that, people who hate that,

638
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,300
Speaker 6:  but I think it's become less of sort of an identity Tarion

639
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,990
Speaker 6:  gamer boy thing, and more of a thing, dial up people who are interested in

640
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,950
Speaker 6:  tech and video games who aren't white boys have

641
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,180
Speaker 6:  become more and more engaged in and interested in. And that

642
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,790
Speaker 6:  has also led to the scene.

643
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,410
Speaker 4:  You're doing these, these customizations that, that

644
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,200
Speaker 4:  you do. And these, these kinds of, I guess, not customization, they're more

645
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,070
Speaker 4:  like a concierge service, right? Like people come and they ask

646
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:09,030
Speaker 4:  you, I want to do they come to you with like big ideas or they come to you

647
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,020
Speaker 4:  and say, I want a pink keyboard. I want some cool flowers on it. I

648
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,990
Speaker 4:  want it to really pop. And I want it to make my fingers feel nice.

649
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,470
Speaker 6:  It's usually the latter, but it varies.

650
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,700
Speaker 6:  And yeah, the way it usually works is someone comes and

651
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,660
Speaker 6:  either they want help shopping or help building or both, it's usually both.

652
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,650
Speaker 6:  And so what I do is I just use the knowledge I have

653
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,560
Speaker 6:  of where to look for stuff what's popular. What's good.

654
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,160
Speaker 6:  And based on their interests, I find them stuff. And I'm like, what do you

655
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,730
Speaker 6:  think of these key caps or, or this keyboard shape? What are your

656
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,390
Speaker 6:  needs and what do you want to express? And then

657
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,320
Speaker 6:  once I find that out, we get it and I build it and send it to

658
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,500
Speaker 6:  them.

659
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,470
Speaker 4:  And how are, how are they finding you? Are they finding you through like

660
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,290
Speaker 4:  Twitter? Are they finding you through like discord or Reddit?

661
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,220
Speaker 6:  I think it's mostly Twitter and discord. And

662
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,790
Speaker 6:  like, honestly I have gotten way more interest than I was

663
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,840
Speaker 6:  prepared for that necessarily able to handle. So I'm pretty backed up.

664
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:11,590
Speaker 6:  If you're listening to this, if you reach out there will be a long wait,

665
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,670
Speaker 6:  but yeah, I have a website keyboard,

666
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,240
Speaker 6:  concierge.com and at KB underscore

667
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,140
Speaker 6:  concierge on Twitter, you know, I have my main Twitter

668
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,130
Speaker 6:  that I built up a following and tech and gaming spaces as

669
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,270
Speaker 6:  a writer there. And I know people, you know, like you

670
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,900
Speaker 6:  and people at a bunch of other publications. And when I launched this,

671
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,170
Speaker 6:  everyone was very supportive and retweeted. And I think a lot of people,

672
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,810
Speaker 6:  you know, through that, just kind of learned who I was.

673
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,110
Speaker 4:  You think this is going to be a service that we're going to see more people

674
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,040
Speaker 4:  really embracing?

675
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,300
Speaker 6:  I think probably, yes. I think right now it is very tied up

676
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,230
Speaker 6:  in being a content creator and most people who do this service

677
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:57,190
Speaker 6:  also stream or make YouTube videos of builds. I think

678
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,060
Speaker 6:  it's just because that's what the prominent names in the space do. And

679
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,930
Speaker 6:  because it gets you a dual income stream, the only reason why I

680
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,860
Speaker 6:  necessarily don't do those things is I just haven't had the space in time.

681
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,760
Speaker 6:  I have my hand in like five different things and then given time. But yeah,

682
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,480
Speaker 6:  I do think more and more people are going to emerge in this

683
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,470
Speaker 6:  space and be sort of concierge shoppers slash

684
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,460
Speaker 6:  builders slash content creators. And there are already a lot out there.

685
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,600
Speaker 4:  Let's talk about some of those content creators, because what is the

686
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,840
Speaker 4:  appeal do you think of watching other people build these

687
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,290
Speaker 4:  keyboards? Cause that's like kind of the primary thing that's happening with

688
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,230
Speaker 4:  these content creators, right? They're like explaining it. It's, they're

689
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,440
Speaker 4:  showing it as they're almost like gadget bloggers right here. They're showing

690
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,890
Speaker 4:  it off. They're giving you the unboxing it and then they're putting it

691
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,460
Speaker 4:  together.

692
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,510
Speaker 6:  Lots of unboxing videos. Yeah. I think there are a few things. I

693
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,110
Speaker 6:  think one is the sort of showcasing and

694
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,800
Speaker 6:  voyeurism of seeing really nice, expensive things like

695
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,850
Speaker 6:  <inaudible> types to how types went really viral

696
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,720
Speaker 6:  in like 20, 19, 20, 20. I'm

697
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,350
Speaker 6:  not sure precisely, but he built a keyboard for the Fortnite

698
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,310
Speaker 6:  streamer T Fu

699
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,760
Speaker 12:  Oh my God, dude, this thing is

700
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,990
Speaker 12:  nuts.

701
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,520
Speaker 6:  And that keyboard costs $3,500. That was like the most

702
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,510
Speaker 6:  expensive keyboard you could possibly build. And people

703
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,470
Speaker 6:  loved it and were fascinated by it seeing like, you know, the case was made

704
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:30,160
Speaker 6:  out of like Chrome steel or something. It was wild.

705
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,610
Speaker 6:  And seeing that come together and how it looks and how it sounds.

706
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,600
Speaker 6:  I think that's really interesting. I think the other thing

707
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,530
Speaker 6:  is just, it's a means of learning and knowledge.

708
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,580
Speaker 6:  I consume a lot less keyboard content than I used to when I

709
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,480
Speaker 6:  was first learning because I watched a lot of that content to build

710
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,470
Speaker 6:  my own knowledge base to see, okay, how do you build this? And

711
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,460
Speaker 6:  what is good for this and this, what sort of customization techniques

712
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,300
Speaker 6:  and modern techniques, because that's another big thing in this scene is

713
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,080
Speaker 6:  modding parts of the keyboard to sound and feel better like

714
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,220
Speaker 6:  lots of little mechanical lubricants and like a little

715
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,130
Speaker 6:  mods. You do it with tape and all these things. And these are techniques

716
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,030
Speaker 6:  invented by people. And if you want to learn them the best way to do it is

717
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,580
Speaker 6:  on YouTube or Twitch. Watching people build things.

718
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,700
Speaker 4:  That's very fascinating to me cause I'm gonna make you listen to this right

719
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,300
Speaker 4:  now. I've got a keyboard over here. This is why my

720
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,260
Speaker 4:  Leopold <inaudible>. I

721
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,620
Speaker 4:  went ahead and I'm it's, it's got the toe prey stems.

722
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,460
Speaker 6:  Nice, nice.

723
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,850
Speaker 4:  They're very, very good stems. Very good stems. But I replaced them. I replaced

724
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,840
Speaker 4:  the stems because I wanted to use my own Cary stem key

725
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,290
Speaker 4:  caps and just listened to my regular toll-free keyboard.

726
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,140
Speaker 4:  Okay. You hear that?

727
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,630
Speaker 4:  My other, this keyboard sounded exactly like that until I replaced the stems.

728
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,450
Speaker 6:  Cool.

729
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:01,250
Speaker 4:  Does it sound different? Like, to me, it kind of sounded different when I

730
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,000
Speaker 4:  did it and I was like, oh, did I break my keyboard? But it does. It

731
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,230
Speaker 4:  sounds different. So like

732
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,920
Speaker 6:  Massively

733
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,700
Speaker 4:  People are, I guess, really focused on that and wanting to, I'm just now

734
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,000
Speaker 4:  learning that there is apparently a large community of people who would tell

735
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,230
Speaker 4:  me how to fix that noise.

736
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,460
Speaker 6:  Yes. There absolutely are. Yeah. In fact, in

737
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,360
Speaker 6:  my head I was thinking of, okay, so that's readily on the upstroke if you

738
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,200
Speaker 6:  loop this specific thing, et cetera, et cetera. And it was going on in my

739
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,370
Speaker 6:  head, but

740
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,530
Speaker 4:  I know what I'm going to be talking to you about after we finished this

741
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,100
Speaker 4:  conversation.

742
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:38,210
Speaker 6:  Yes. But people are very invested in how their keyboards

743
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,600
Speaker 6:  sound. So most build

744
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,350
Speaker 6:  videos, feature a typing section where the person just types

745
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,250
Speaker 6:  into a microphone.

746
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,060
Speaker 11:  They all sound that funky. Yeah. I mean, these are, Telio still, Telio,

747
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,740
Speaker 11:  aren't generally known for their,

748
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,210
Speaker 6:  And they're even like break off videos of just typing

749
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,350
Speaker 6:  a SMR where like you just listened to a nice keyboard type and

750
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,550
Speaker 6:  people really like these. I enjoy them. I think it's a nice sound.

751
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,300
Speaker 6:  I mean, part of my fascination with mechanical

752
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,900
Speaker 6:  keyboards is when I went to undergrad, we had a

753
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,740
Speaker 6:  collective printer in the library and it had an old keyboard attached to

754
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,730
Speaker 6:  it. And it was really loud and clacky and very satisfying. And I

755
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,570
Speaker 6:  love that fan. And so when I was first got into it, I

756
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,590
Speaker 6:  got into mechanical keyboards. I wanted to build something

757
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:31,290
Speaker 6:  that felt and sounded like that because it was nostalgic. It made me feel

758
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,160
Speaker 6:  cool. Like you mentioned the movie hackers earlier, it made me feel like

759
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,450
Speaker 6:  a character in that movie,

760
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,700
Speaker 4:  Angelina Jolie. And that movie was awesome, man.

761
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,360
Speaker 6:  Yes, exactly. And like that fantasy was

762
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,350
Speaker 6:  something that I was chasing on a tactile and aesthetic level. And

763
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,250
Speaker 6:  I think a lot of people have similar memories

764
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,970
Speaker 6:  of like an old apple two or IBM

765
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,480
Speaker 6:  model M keyboard that was lying around the house or they've

766
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,320
Speaker 6:  seen, or felt a keyboard somewhere, something that's streamer has or something

767
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,070
Speaker 6:  where they just dug the sound in the field and they want something

768
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,120
Speaker 6:  like that.

769
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,260
Speaker 4:  Do you think there is like that YouTube and that Twitch and

770
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,770
Speaker 4:  video has kind of helped increase the

771
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,580
Speaker 4:  popularity of this community because people can hit here or this stuff. Cause

772
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,910
Speaker 4:  like when I started doing this, there weren't a lot of YouTubers. This wasn't

773
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,750
Speaker 4:  a thing. And now that seems to be where a big chunk of the community is.

774
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,440
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. Like in my submissions for keyboard

775
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,190
Speaker 6:  concierge, I will regularly, you know, there's a space in the form where

776
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,850
Speaker 6:  people can write what they're looking for. And a lot of times it's happened

777
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,810
Speaker 6:  more and more people link me to videos of keyboards say saw on YouTube and

778
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:43,080
Speaker 6:  they're like, I want something like this. And all of a sudden I have to tell

779
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,800
Speaker 6:  them, you know, that keyboard costs $1,200 and they waited

780
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,970
Speaker 6:  a couple years for all the parts to come out of group

781
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,420
Speaker 6:  by. Here's how we might be able to approximate this. But

782
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:58,500
Speaker 6:  absolutely I think being able to see and to hear them is a big thing.

783
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,640
Speaker 4:  Where do you think keyboards are going next? Are they going to get more complex?

784
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,960
Speaker 6:  I don't know if more complex, I think what I've seen

785
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,950
Speaker 6:  mostly the past year or two, since, you know, I've gotten really into,

786
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,640
Speaker 6:  this is a sort of sideways explosion of

787
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,450
Speaker 6:  different styles and shapes and little

788
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,170
Speaker 6:  accessory things like for a while, people got really into having

789
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,630
Speaker 6:  rotary knobs on their keyboards,

790
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,310
Speaker 4:  Very popular at the verge,

791
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,730
Speaker 6:  Extremely popular that you can use as, you know,

792
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,600
Speaker 6:  volume knobs or whatever else. Those got real big. And I

793
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,380
Speaker 6:  think certain aesthetics, like very

794
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,280
Speaker 6:  sleek modernist keyboards and then a move against that

795
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,120
Speaker 6:  to like more outrageous and playful and garish looking

796
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,990
Speaker 6:  keyboards. I don't necessarily see them getting more

797
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:52,980
Speaker 6:  complex, but I'm seeing more and more aesthetic

798
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,340
Speaker 6:  variety and sort of like in the

799
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,300
Speaker 6:  materials coming out of group bias and corporations, it's very

800
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,290
Speaker 6:  much like its own little art world of like, you know, what is

801
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,280
Speaker 6:  trending, what people think looks good and just a really intense

802
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,500
Speaker 6:  focus right now on aesthetics.

803
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,670
Speaker 4:  Awesome. Well, I feeling bad because all of my keyboards are

804
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,660
Speaker 4:  gray, so I am, I am not in the future going

805
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,750
Speaker 4:  to have to go buy something that looks like an electric guitar. I did see

806
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,680
Speaker 4:  that just recently. That sounds very cool. But Julie, thank

807
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,590
Speaker 4:  you so much for chatting and talking about this.

808
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,620
Speaker 6:  Absolutely.

809
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,280
Speaker 4:  Thanks again to Julie Muncie for talking with me for the show and thank you

810
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,300
Speaker 4:  for listening. The keyboard space really has changed and people like Jacob

811
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,020
Speaker 4:  and Julie are driving that change, but as much as it's them, it's

812
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,650
Speaker 4:  also all the other fans and creators gathering online at places like Reddit

813
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,610
Speaker 4:  discord and that wide variety of keyboard forums, where Jacob made a

814
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:58,480
Speaker 4:  name for himself. It's the community. Not any company driving

815
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,720
Speaker 4:  that change this. Isn't the only community driving kick-ass change in the

816
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,750
Speaker 4:  gadget space this month. I'm going to be talking to a lot of really cool
