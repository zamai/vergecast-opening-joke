Speaker 1:  applications in the cloud on premises and at the edge. That's

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,180
Speaker 1:  why millions of organizations trust a W Ss for every

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,060
Speaker 1:  application, wanna develop and deploy secure applications faster

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,660

Speaker 1:  you can imagine.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,790
Speaker 3:  Welcome, To, The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of really simple syndication.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,750
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend David Pierce and this is the third episode in our series

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,590
Speaker 3:  all about connectivity. If you miss the first two episodes, we talked about

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,790
Speaker 3:  telly and how we connect to content and beeper and how we connect

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,070
Speaker 3:  to each other. They're both super fun episodes. You should listen to both.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,270
Speaker 3:  Today I wanna talk about something a little different. I wanna talk about

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,150
Speaker 3:  posting and when I say posting, I mean it in the broadest possible

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,790
Speaker 3:  way. Like if messaging is how we talk to directly to each other,

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,070
Speaker 3:  posting is how we talk to the internet. An audience, the

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,630
Speaker 3:  whole world, whatever you want to think about posting the threads or X or

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,070
Speaker 3:  Instagram that's posting, uploading to YouTube or TikTok.

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,830
Speaker 3:  Also posting. Posting is how a lot of creators have made

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,630
Speaker 3:  careers. It's how a lot of people and companies and even governments

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,910
Speaker 3:  share and consume information. A huge portion of the internet

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,910
Speaker 3:  is just places for posting and for reading other people's posts. One

28
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,670
Speaker 3:  thing we've been talking a lot about on this show over the last year is the

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,230
Speaker 3:  way that these posting networks, these social networks are changing.

30
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,430
Speaker 3:  I really think we're at the end of what you might call the great platform

31
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,790
Speaker 3:  age where a handful of big companies and products like Facebook and Twitter

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,550
Speaker 3:  and Reddit and really not that many others, own all of the posting

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,470
Speaker 3:  systems. Recently we have things like Mastodon and Blue Sky,

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,270
Speaker 3:  which are big new ideas about how this all works. There are

35
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,070
Speaker 3:  more open, more interconnected, more like the web itself than

36
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,030
Speaker 3:  just a specific platform. We've talked a lot about Activity Pub on this

37
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,830
Speaker 3:  show in the last nine months or so. We're not gonna do too much of that

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,710
Speaker 3:  today. Activity Pub is the protocol that underlies a lot of the change that's

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,430
Speaker 3:  going on, but again, we're not gonna do too much of it. Just a, a tiny bit

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,150
Speaker 3:  of, lemme just play you this clip from Flipboard, C E o, Mike

41
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,830
Speaker 3:  McHugh from when he was on The Vergecast back in April.

42
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,410
Speaker 2:  Activity Pub You know, when I think about it, I think there are two things

43
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,370
Speaker 2:  that it does and one of them is to create an open social graph that

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,330
Speaker 2:  becomes a part of the web, which in and of itself is a very big

45
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,530
Speaker 2:  deal. The other thing it does is it creates a common

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,970
Speaker 2:  two-way streaming platform or or architecture that allows

47
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,130
Speaker 2:  services to be interoperable. So what this means is that

48
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,840
Speaker 2:  as we've seen all these social media platforms basically just

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Speaker 2:  become other versions of themselves. They You know they all have vertical

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,880
Speaker 2:  video now. They're all copying each other. They all build everything into

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,520
Speaker 2:  this vertical stack that's totally proprietary. And if you leave and you

52
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,880
Speaker 2:  try to do a new one, you've gotta rebuild your social graph. As a creator,

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,720
Speaker 2:  that's a big issue. As a brand, as a publisher, that's a big problem.

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,160
Speaker 2:  So what this reminds me of is the days of a O l before the web

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,760
Speaker 2:  really happened, everything is built vertically. If you wanna do a You know,

56
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,560
Speaker 2:  put something up online, you have to go do a business development deal with

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Speaker 2:  a O l and all of the innovation is locked in by

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,280
Speaker 2:  one company. So they're only doing as much as that one company can do.

59
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,640
Speaker 2:  And with this activity Pub Breakthrough And, what it really

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,600
Speaker 2:  allows is the web to flourish again and to You know

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,320
Speaker 2:  kind of reopen up all of that innovation that currently is really

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,120
Speaker 2:  controlled by just You know a handful of social media platforms

63
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,360
Speaker 2:  today.

64
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,600
Speaker 3:  Like I said, we're not going to spend today talking about Activity Pub. I

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,160
Speaker 3:  think it's important to understand, but that's not what we're here to do

66
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,120
Speaker 3:  today. We are going to talk about an acronym, sorry, not an acronym.

67
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,560
Speaker 3:  I always get that wrong. It's an initialism, two of them actually very similar

68
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,080
Speaker 3:  but also very different in some important ways. The first one is

69
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,840
Speaker 3:  POSSE P POSSE POSSE. It stands for post own site

70
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,800
Speaker 3:  syndicate everywhere. You don't have to remember that. I'll come back to

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,280
Speaker 3:  it. The other one is PESOS Similar but different

72
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,040
Speaker 3:  PESOS. It stands for Post Everywhere syndicate own site.

73
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,000
Speaker 3:  These are two ideas and really one idea in two parts about how

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,800
Speaker 3:  Post should work, but they're really not all that different from one another.

75
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,960
Speaker 3:  And I think that if you want to understand the future of posting, POSSE and

76
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,920
Speaker 3:  PESOS are the key. So the story of POSSE and PESOS starts in about

77
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,720
Speaker 3:  2012. It came out of a group called Indie Web, particularly

78
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,680
Speaker 3:  a guy named EC Celek. This is how Totec described the reason behind

79
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,400
Speaker 3:  the idea at a Google developers event. He was at all the way back in

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,960
Speaker 3:  2013,

81
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,400
Speaker 4:  Because I wanna own my own content, I wanna control it, but yet I still wanna

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,880
Speaker 4:  stay in touch with my friends. And that's really where POSSE came from was

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,160
Speaker 4:  this like diligent desire to own your own content. But then like, hey, my

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,760
Speaker 4:  friends are reading on Twitter or my friends are reading on Facebook, or

85
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,800
Speaker 4:  my friends are reading on Google Reader. Wherever they're reading, you're

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,920
Speaker 4:  like, okay, I have to have a feed, right? If someone's using a feed reader

87
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,200
Speaker 4:  or if someone's just using Twitter, I need to post copies of my content to

88
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,120
Speaker 4:  Twitter or Facebook. But in all those cases, one thing we've we've tried

89
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,480
Speaker 4:  to do is like make sure that there's always links or or some identifier pointing

90
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,280
Speaker 4:  back to the original. And that's important because when you start kind of

91
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,920
Speaker 4:  forking these conversations in these different forums, you may want to actually

92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,600
Speaker 4:  integrate them back right in your own site and somebody might wanna see like

93
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,560
Speaker 4:  the whole story of what's going on. Yeah,

94
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,000
Speaker 3:  The idea behind POSSE is basically this, instead of posting by logging

95
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,520
Speaker 3:  into some platform and posting only for that platform and the people on it,

96
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,520
Speaker 3:  then logging into another platform and posting different stuff for that platform

97
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,000
Speaker 3:  and those people, the place you post should be your own website,

98
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,160
Speaker 3:  a blog, social feed, a gallery, whatever it should be, your

99
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,160
Speaker 3:  website. And that link back part that EC was talking about is

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
Speaker 3:  also really important. You see some POSSE believers around the internet,

101
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,320
Speaker 3:  they use full links to their post at the end of every post that they share.

102
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,240
Speaker 3:  Others will add like a six digit ID that you can add to their

103
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,360
Speaker 3:  website U R L and find it that way. Either way, the goal is to have your

104
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,320
Speaker 3:  stuff be everywhere, but to always be bringing people back toward

105
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Speaker 3:  your own site. The idea is that a thing is yours that you publish

106
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,080
Speaker 3:  on and that's where everything starts. The way I think about it is like who

107
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,040
Speaker 3:  owns the publish button right now the platforms do you post on X

108
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,960
Speaker 3:  by typing in a text box on X, you post on Instagram by

109
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,800
Speaker 3:  using Instagram's upload feature. But in a POSSE world, the publish button

110
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,280
Speaker 3:  lives on your website, your blog, whatever thing you've created,

111
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,440
Speaker 3:  you post there and whatever you post gets disseminated to all the places

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,760
Speaker 3:  that your audience is. I really like this approach. This approach has a bunch

113
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,000
Speaker 3:  of benefits too, starting with the fact that it's just easier, right? Right

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Speaker 3:  now, even if you wanna post the exact same thing to X and

115
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,040
Speaker 3:  Threads and Mastodon, you have to log into three services. You do a bunch

116
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,440
Speaker 3:  of copying and pasting, you post in each one individually. You have kind

117
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,880
Speaker 3:  of three different conversations on three different platforms. It's just

118
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,360
Speaker 3:  disconnected in a way that it shouldn't be. If you've ever used a tool like

119
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,240
Speaker 3:  Hootsuite or Sprinkler or one of those apps that brands use to post their

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,600
Speaker 3:  stuff around the web, You know how useful. Just a simple better posting tool

121
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,880
Speaker 3:  can actually be. POSSE would give those tools to everybody.

122
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,440
Speaker 3:  PESOS by the way, is kind of the exact inverse. In a PESOS world,

123
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,120
Speaker 3:  you can publish from anywhere using any tools on any platform and everything

124
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,960
Speaker 3:  you publish gets sent back to your site. So you post on Instagram

125
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,600
Speaker 3:  with Instagram's tools, you post on X with X's tools, but all of it gets

126
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,440
Speaker 3:  pulled back to your website, your blog, whatever. It's in that world.

127
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,040
Speaker 3:  Your website becomes more like an archive of your stuff published

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Speaker 3:  elsewhere, whereas POSSE sees it as the place for the best version of your

129
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,000
Speaker 3:  posts. That's where people should go to interact with you. The difference

130
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,720
Speaker 3:  is subtle but important, but generally I think both sides really see the

131
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,640
Speaker 3:  world the same way and think that in general, this platform specificity

132
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,760
Speaker 3:  is a bad idea. That's really the bigger picture here. POSSE

133
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,640
Speaker 3:  and PESOS both want to totally upend the way we think about our content and

134
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,600
Speaker 3:  social networks right now. These social platforms say that you own your

135
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,520
Speaker 3:  content but you don't really, if a social platform goes away, your stuff

136
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,440
Speaker 3:  is just gone. If a platform decides you violated the rules and deletes

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,160
Speaker 3:  your stuff also gone in the same way that Activity Pub makes your

138
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,040
Speaker 3:  social graph portable between networks, POSSE turns the social networks

139
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,800
Speaker 3:  into destinations for your content but not the place you create

140
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,560
Speaker 3:  anything. I think that difference is really important and the more I've learned

141
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,200
Speaker 3:  about POSSE, the more I've come to see it as a potentially powerful new way

142
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,760
Speaker 3:  to think about posting and building content in general. But it also does

143
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,040
Speaker 3:  raise some really complicated questions. The way we think about posting now

144
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,000
Speaker 3:  posting is really only half the equation. So what's Posse's

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,920
Speaker 3:  plan for likes and reposts and comments and replies and all the rest of the

146
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,720
Speaker 3:  engagement that comes on these platforms. And if Posse's idea is

147
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,640
Speaker 3:  to just post the same thing on a hundred different platforms, is that actually

148
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,480
Speaker 3:  what we want? And just from a pure aesthetic perspective,

149
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,680
Speaker 3:  how does all of that work on one website? How do I make the

150
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,480
Speaker 3:  whole internet of posting and content make sense on my

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
Speaker 3:  domain? I asked Cory Dro, the author and activist in one of the Internet's

152
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Speaker 3:  most kind of tenured bloggers, what he thought about all of this. He said

153
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,880
Speaker 3:  that when he set up his new blog pluralistic about two years ago, he tried

154
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,840
Speaker 3:  to adhere to the POSSE way of life and then he explained how his

155
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,600
Speaker 3:  system works. I'm gonna play you his entire answer, which is very

156
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,440
Speaker 3:  long and very technical because I think it's useful to understand what

157
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,840
Speaker 3:  it takes right now to really make this work.

158
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,400
Speaker 5:  I wanted to find a way to stand up a new platform in this moment

159
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,320
Speaker 5:  where everyone gets their news and their You know does their reading

160
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,280
Speaker 5:  through these silos that then hold you to ransom.

161
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,440
Speaker 5:  And I wanted to use those silos to bring in readers and to

162
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,560
Speaker 5:  attract and engage with an audience, but I didn't wanna become beholden to

163
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,240
Speaker 5:  them. And So I made my own POSSE thing. And so as when I started,

164
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,560
Speaker 5:  I literally had an H T M L template in the default Linux editor,

165
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,240
Speaker 5:  which is called Get It, which I've got like emax key bindings on. And I just

166
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,480
Speaker 5:  literally would open that file and re-save it with a different file name,

167
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,280
Speaker 5:  like I had a pen the day's date to it, and then write a bunch of blog posts

168
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,040
Speaker 5:  in this template. And then I would copy and paste those

169
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,840
Speaker 5:  into Twitter's threading tool and mask it on and

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,640
Speaker 5:  Tumblr and Medium like one at a time,

171
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,120
Speaker 5:  individually editing as I went. And then I would turn it into a

172
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,080
Speaker 5:  text file that I would paste into an email that I would send to a mailman

173
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,160
Speaker 5:  instance where I was hosting a newsletter and then I had full

174
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,920
Speaker 5:  text r s s as well and Discourse for Comments, which has its own

175
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,000
Speaker 5:  syndication for people to follow you on discourse. That was a lot of manual

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Speaker 5:  work and I made a lot of mistakes. And a guy, Lauren

177
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,600
Speaker 5:  Kornfield, who's a like legendary cryptographer who was following it,

178
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,560
Speaker 5:  took notice of how many manual errors I was making and said

179
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,240
Speaker 5:  like, do you need me to write you some Python scripts? And so he did. He

180
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,960
Speaker 5:  wrote me a little Python script that automates about three

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Speaker 5:  quarters of that work, which still leaves me with substantial

182
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,800
Speaker 5:  work to do. So I'm, I have a text editor tab open that

183
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,240
Speaker 5:  has one of the two posts I'm gonna post today in it already

184
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,720
Speaker 5:  and the other one just as a skeleton. And then I

185
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,200
Speaker 5:  have a template file that has all the things that change from

186
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,880
Speaker 5:  day-to-day, like a recap of yesterday's posts, my

187
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,120
Speaker 5:  overview of my blog posts from 20 years, 15 years, 10 years,

188
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,040
Speaker 5:  five years, and one year ago my upcoming talks and

189
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,160
Speaker 5:  promotional messages. I'm, I'm running a Kickstarter for my next novel. If

190
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,080
Speaker 5:  I can plug that it's at lost-caused.org and

191
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,680
Speaker 5:  So. I've got that open. I've got a template open for social media from

192
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,280
Speaker 5:  Mastodon and Twitter that has a slightly different version of those same

193
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,960
Speaker 5:  things that I manually maintain. I have a file called Twitter two and a file

194
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Speaker 5:  called Mastodon two, which have captures of that second post

195
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,520
Speaker 5:  that I'm gonna publish today, but not the first one. There's an empty file

196
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,960
Speaker 5:  called Twitter and Mastodon that are still on my, on my desk. And then

197
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,360
Speaker 5:  in one Firefox window I have probably about 10

198
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,760
Speaker 5:  tabs. Three are for medium, one is for WordPress, three or for Tumblr, three

199
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,440
Speaker 5:  or four Twitter and three or for Mastodon that are just kind of the templates

200
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,160
Speaker 5:  for these things. And then in another window I have

201
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,760
Speaker 5:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 different tabs

202
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,560
Speaker 5:  for articles that I'm going to refer to in today's blog post.

203
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,840
Speaker 5:  And So I will then compose that in the text editor, run the Python

204
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,320
Speaker 5:  scripts on them. That takes as long as it takes to write a blog post.

205
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,440
Speaker 5:  But then I will spend probably another hour getting

206
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,480
Speaker 5:  everything into all of those feeds.

207
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,000
Speaker 3:  Okay, you get the idea right? The process is rough. Corey finished his thought

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,880
Speaker 3:  here by being very annoyed at how hard it is to post long threads on X

209
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,520
Speaker 3:  these days. And he's right. And here's the problem. The existing

210
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,600
Speaker 3:  platforms X and all the rest have no incentive at all to make it easy

211
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,600
Speaker 3:  for you to bring stuff in or get stuff out. They want to keep you using

212
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,520
Speaker 3:  their tools on their platform as much as possible. But not

213
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,120
Speaker 3:  only are platforms like Blue Sky and Mastodon and Pixel Fed inventing new

214
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,080
Speaker 3:  more open tools for posting and reading, there are new apps

215
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,040
Speaker 3:  out there trying to passify the internet as we know it. Now

216
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,640
Speaker 3:  we're gonna take a quick break and then we're gonna talk to the creator of

217
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,920
Speaker 3:  one of them. We'll be right back.

218
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,050
Speaker 1:  Thank you to Amazon Web Services for sponsoring Vergecast

219
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,530
Speaker 1:  A w s has been innovating infrastructure for over 15 years

220
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,650
Speaker 1:  so you can build and run secure performance applications faster and

221
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,450
Speaker 1:  more economically. That's why a w s pioneered serverless technology

222
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,010
Speaker 1:  in 2014 with the launch of a w s Lambda.

223
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,290
Speaker 7:  Lambda allows developers to supply snippets of code in various

224
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,650
Speaker 7:  languages like Java or Python or otherwise, and we run it on

225
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,850
Speaker 7:  their behalf using a S'S power of infrastructure.

226
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,410
Speaker 1:  AJ NIR is Lambda's general manager with a W Ss Serverless Services.

227
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,650
Speaker 1:  Customers can offload most operational responsibilities to a w s

228
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,490
Speaker 1:  and get built-in high availability, scalability and security best

229
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,810
Speaker 1:  practices by default

230
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,650
Speaker 7:  And, what that means is they can get a, what we would call a production grade

231
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,490
Speaker 7:  application up and running in factors of time that are three to five times

232
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,970
Speaker 7:  shorter than it used to be in the past.

233
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,650
Speaker 1:  AJ will be back later in the show to tell you more about how a w s

234
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,530
Speaker 1:  serverless technologies make it easy to scale and manage cloud applications.

235
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,370
Speaker 1:  Reimagine your applications with a w s

236
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,550
Speaker 3:  All, right? We're back. I think POSSE, as I've been saying, is a really good

237
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,550
Speaker 3:  idea. I really believe in the idea of having your own space and owning your

238
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,190
Speaker 3:  own content online. I'm just not at all sure how it's supposed to like

239
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,350
Speaker 3:  work and how it's gonna be easier and more doable than just signing up

240
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,760
Speaker 3:  for a Facebook account. So I called up Manton Reese, who's the founder of

241
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,720
Speaker 3:  a service called Micro Blog to see how he thinks about it. Micro Blog

242
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,400
Speaker 3:  has been around since 2017. It didn't necessarily start as a

243
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,120
Speaker 3:  POSSE tool or a way to do activity pub posting. It just started because

244
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,760
Speaker 3:  Manton thought well before Elon Musk showed up that we needed a Twitter

245
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,120
Speaker 3:  that wasn't owned and operated by one single company.

246
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,840
Speaker 8:  One of the original premises was just could we rebuild a Twitter

247
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,480
Speaker 8:  like user experience but base it on blogs? So the

248
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,480
Speaker 8:  timeline in Micro Blog is just posts from lots of feeds, lots of R S Ss feeds,

249
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,120
Speaker 8:  whether they're hosted a Microsoft blog or they're hosted somewhere else,

250
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,840
Speaker 8:  so, so how do we merge those together so you don't just have like a few

251
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,800
Speaker 8:  tabs open with your favorite websites and you're typing in the domain name

252
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,560
Speaker 8:  that it's more of a newsfeed timeline experience and

253
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,200
Speaker 8:  that's what people want. But if the foundation of that, if the protocols

254
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,880
Speaker 8:  can be open, it allows us to just build so many interesting apps,

255
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,040
Speaker 8:  so many different types of experiences, it'll just be way, way

256
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,280
Speaker 8:  better.

257
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,760
Speaker 3:  That philosophy, the stuff he's talking about there became a lot more real

258
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,080
Speaker 3:  for him and I think for a lot of people on the internet over the last year,

259
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,200
Speaker 3:  frankly whatever you think about how Elon Musk is doing at X, the

260
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,040
Speaker 3:  whole saga has made really clear that the services we care about and

261
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,960
Speaker 3:  post on are Fragile Micro blog now lets you keep a

262
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,680
Speaker 3:  simple blog, which kind of looks like Tumblr I guess, and you can post photos

263
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,560
Speaker 3:  or texts or links or whatever. And when you post to Micro Blog,

264
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,320
Speaker 3:  you can also automatically post to Mastodon, Tumblr, blue Sky, medium,

265
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,320
Speaker 3:  LinkedIn, pixeled, no Stir and Flicker. It's a lot of services.

266
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,120
Speaker 3:  One of the big criticisms that I've heard of the POSSE approach and of tools

267
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,920
Speaker 3:  like Micro Blog is that actually posting the same content to

268
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,000
Speaker 3:  all of those different networks is a terrible idea. Networks have

269
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,880
Speaker 3:  different audiences, different people, different norms, different ways of

270
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,560
Speaker 3:  engaging with the system. At some point, if you're just posting to a bunch

271
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,520
Speaker 3:  of places all at once, aren't you basically spam? When I put that

272
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,400
Speaker 3:  question to Manton, he said he doesn't really see it that way.

273
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,360
Speaker 8:  I think it really depends on the person, like what you're trying to get out

274
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,240
Speaker 8:  of posting. If you are a quote unquote like social media

275
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,480
Speaker 8:  presence and you are an influencer and you are really needing to target

276
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,440
Speaker 8:  different groups, sure, but if you are posting first

277
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,080
Speaker 8:  for yourself, like I want, I'm doing something, I'm thinking about something,

278
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,440
Speaker 8:  I wanna share this with the world, then it's really a secondary

279
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,040
Speaker 8:  decision about how people receive it. Like so for me, I like to post

280
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,000
Speaker 8:  to my blog, I like everything to be there and if I post a photo to my blog,

281
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,880
Speaker 8:  it would be great if everybody on different networks could see it.

282
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,320
Speaker 3:  Manden did agree though that the user interface for all of this is bad

283
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,560
Speaker 3:  starting at the very beginning, which is that you have to register your own

284
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,920
Speaker 3:  domain. That is already too much work and expense for a lot of people.

285
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,080
Speaker 3:  I mean, who wants to manage d n s records? Who even wants to know what d

286
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,760
Speaker 3:  n s records are? Micro Blog does push you to register your own

287
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,360
Speaker 3:  domain during the setup process, but Manson actually said it probably doesn't

288
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,280
Speaker 3:  push hard enough and make it easy enough. And in general, he said

289
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,120
Speaker 3:  the real bar for websites and for POSSE in general is that you have to be

290
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,000
Speaker 3:  easier than creating a social account. And the thing is, it's really,

291
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,440
Speaker 3:  really easy to create a social account. That's a hard, hard bar to

292
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,040
Speaker 3:  clear. Okay, we've gotta take one more quick break and then I have one more

293
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,240
Speaker 3:  person I wanna talk to about all of this. One of the people in charge of

294
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,400
Speaker 3:  the Internet's biggest posting platform and someone who thinks about this

295
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,560
Speaker 3:  stuff way more than most, we'll be right back,

296
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,380
Speaker 7:  Fox Creative.

297
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,660
Speaker 1:  This is advertiser content brought to you by Amazon Web Services.

298
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,900
Speaker 1:  AJ NA from a w s says there's an easy way to understand the

299
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,020
Speaker 1:  benefits of serverless app development.

300
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,380
Speaker 7:  So, I. Think about serverless closer to the concept of wireless,

301
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,140
Speaker 7:  meaning

302
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,940
Speaker 1:  The servers are there, you just don't have to think about it.

303
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,060
Speaker 7:  They become our problem to worry about.

304
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,500
Speaker 1:  That means no infrastructure to provision or manage no operating systems

305
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,580
Speaker 1:  to install, upgrade or patch a w s takes care of it all for you.

306
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,180
Speaker 7:  A lot of the innovation we see in the market today I don't believe would

307
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,780
Speaker 7:  have been possible if something like cloud services did not exist as the

308
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,140
Speaker 7:  accelerant. That's

309
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,860
Speaker 1:  Because serverless technologies from Amazon help customers across

310
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,740
Speaker 1:  industries do two very important things. First, serverless

311
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,620
Speaker 1:  technologies eliminate operational overhead so your teams can release

312
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,500
Speaker 1:  quickly, get feedback and iterate to get to market faster.

313
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,620
Speaker 7:  The customer is always gonna pick the one who meets their needs faster. Second,

314
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,900
Speaker 1:  A w s serverless solutions reduce total cost of ownership

315
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,020
Speaker 1:  with a pay for value billing model. So you never pay for resources, you

316
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,420
Speaker 1:  don't need

317
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,220
Speaker 7:  The total cost of ownership and infrastructure costs are lower than what

318
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,180
Speaker 7:  they would do if they were building on their own. I continue to marvel that

319
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,820
Speaker 7:  when we see companies that are built by one and two people that are serving

320
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,580
Speaker 7:  millions of customers and helping millions of people around the world do

321
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,460
Speaker 7:  things better. And those are the kind of accelerations that happen when customers

322
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,300
Speaker 7:  use cloud services.

323
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,620
Speaker 1:  Learn how a Wix serverless technologies can help you

324
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,460
Speaker 1:  accelerate innovation and lower TCO for your

325
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,420
Speaker 1:  applications@go.aws slash every app.

326
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,790
Speaker 3:  All, right? We're back. I've become obsessed in recent months with this question

327
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,350
Speaker 3:  of how a POSSE system can work. How I as a poster

328
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,590
Speaker 3:  can control where all my stuff is, where things go, I can engage with people

329
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,710
Speaker 3:  but do it all through a place that is mine. It's a really complicated system.

330
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,710
Speaker 3:  It's kind of a rewiring of the entire internet in a certain way and I

331
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,550
Speaker 3:  think it's gonna take everything from domain registrars to R ss s

332
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,350
Speaker 3:  readers to social platforms to think totally differently about how they operate

333
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,790
Speaker 3:  if we're gonna make this work. And frankly I've wondered a lot if this is

334
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,590
Speaker 3:  just an impossible dream, a cool idea about the internet of 20

335
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,150
Speaker 3:  years ago that just can't exist anymore. Like is the toothpaste just out

336
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,430
Speaker 3:  of the tube on this stuff Now to help me sort through it, I called up Matt

337
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,120
Speaker 3:  Mullenweg, the c e O of Automatic and one of the most important people working

338
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,560
Speaker 3:  on WordPress, which is the software that powers basically half the internet.

339
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,520
Speaker 3:  Matt has been a blogger for two decades and has been working on posting

340
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,080
Speaker 3:  software for pretty much just as long So I figured he might have some thoughts

341
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,960
Speaker 3:  and surprise, surprise, he had some thoughts. The first thing I asked him

342
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,800
Speaker 3:  was if he was familiar with the POSSE and PESOS ideas. He said yes

343
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,640
Speaker 3:  he was. And that he actually liked the theory of it quite a bit.

344
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,840
Speaker 9:  As someone publishing, I want as much interaction as possible,

345
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,680
Speaker 9:  so why are you making me choose which network it goes to? I should post it

346
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,480
Speaker 9:  once ideally to my domain and then it goes to x

347
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,440
Speaker 9:  slash Twitter and Threads and Tumblr and all the other networks that have,

348
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,080
Speaker 9:  can have their own interfaces and network effects and everything like that.

349
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,320
Speaker 9:  But my thoughts should go to all those places. They should

350
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,720
Speaker 9:  all have APIs where whatever interactions are happening on those platforms,

351
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,400
Speaker 9:  I should be able to bring them in. There's actually some really cool plugins

352
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Speaker 9:  for WordPress that'll bring in like Twitter replies to tweets, which I think

353
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Speaker 9:  is kind of interesting. And then as well, if I'm interacting with someone

354
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,840
Speaker 9:  else with their own domain, their own open web thing, like there should be

355
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,360
Speaker 9:  a way for our sites to talk to each other in a way that yeah, that has the

356
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,040
Speaker 9:  same effect as what's sort of simple to do in these monolithic

357
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,280
Speaker 9:  domain architectures.

358
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,160
Speaker 3:  This is where I'm really curious how you think about it as not somebody who

359
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,440
Speaker 3:  runs one of these companies but who has like been a blogger on the internet

360
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,360
Speaker 3:  for a really long time. 'cause I think the counter that I've heard to the

361
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,600
Speaker 3:  POSSE idea is that it's just not true that you can

362
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,880
Speaker 3:  post one thing and syndicated it everywhere and it will work that fundamentally

363
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,120
Speaker 3:  even all, all the networks are just text boxes or vertical video, but they

364
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,560
Speaker 3:  want different things, they have different norms and you actually have to

365
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,240
Speaker 3:  kind of be different things in different places because that's just how these

366
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,160
Speaker 3:  systems work. Is that a surmountable thing in the kind of

367
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,320
Speaker 3:  POSSE era? What do you make of that criticism of the The thesis? Yeah,

368
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,880
Speaker 9:  I mean there's nuance to each one of course, and there's like

369
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,120
Speaker 9:  public companies like Sprinkler or Sprout that that all they do is like

370
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,760
Speaker 9:  allow folks who want to post to all these places like manage that. We've

371
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,240
Speaker 9:  been thinking in our Jetpack plugin as well, we've been thinking a lot about

372
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,960
Speaker 9:  what's the right UI for this. I think there might be something like the first

373
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,760
Speaker 9:  step is posting to my blog and the second step is I kind of get some

374
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,720
Speaker 9:  opportunities to customize it for each network versus I think where we messed

375
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,600
Speaker 9:  up a little bit is by trying to make this all automated, which by

376
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,920
Speaker 9:  definition maybe loses some of the nuance of like

377
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,000
Speaker 9:  cropping the image a certain way or, or maybe even not having a

378
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,840
Speaker 9:  link, maybe you don't You know link back to your post, which you just sort

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,840
Speaker 9:  of associate the ID of a tweet with a canonical

380
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,800
Speaker 9:  post on your side and then you kind of figure it out on your side versus

381
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,240
Speaker 9:  trying to have them link back to you So I think there's, this is

382
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,480
Speaker 9:  actually more of a a user interface and user flow issue than it is

383
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,760
Speaker 9:  necessarily a technical one. I'm really into this kind of two or three step

384
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,680
Speaker 9:  publishing process as as part of this, as a way to get around this.

385
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,880
Speaker 9:  The other nice thing is that like you want to aggregate as well, So I,

386
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,080
Speaker 9:  I don't want to have to go to all these places necessarily to find the people

387
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,600
Speaker 9:  who I really care about following. Like maybe I'll open an app to see what

388
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,880
Speaker 9:  their flavor of algorithm is and if it surfaces anything interesting for

389
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,840
Speaker 9:  me, but for people I truly wanna follow. I kind of want something that brings

390
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,640
Speaker 9:  that all together in a way that, again, as someone who runs

391
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,000
Speaker 9:  a network like Tumblr, like I know this is like a trade off 'cause I want

392
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,280
Speaker 9:  people obviously to come to my thing. So I can show 'em ads and support the

393
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,480
Speaker 9:  service and everything, but as a user I, I really want everything together

394
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,400
Speaker 9:  in one. Yeah,

395
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,760
Speaker 3:  I think that's right. I think part of why I'm so excited about this whole

396
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,720
Speaker 3:  next phase is that like the creating the platform

397
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,240
Speaker 3:  and the consumption can all be different things. They can all be the same

398
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,680
Speaker 3:  thing in the same place, but they can also be all different things in different

399
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,360
Speaker 3:  places. And if there's just a whole bunch of like fascinating products that

400
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,160
Speaker 3:  are gonna appear when you can just be a reading app. Like

401
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,880
Speaker 3:  the folks at Flipboard I know are thinking a lot about this stuff. They're

402
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,080
Speaker 3:  like, how do we make the best reading experience for the Fedi verse? We don't

403
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,000
Speaker 3:  even have to worry about the text box to post in. We just want figure out

404
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,200
Speaker 3:  consumption. And I think splitting up that stuff is so interesting because

405
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,640
Speaker 9:  A few jobs to be done when you think about it like, and the apps bundle them

406
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,160
Speaker 9:  into one thing. 'cause paper used to bundle like classified and

407
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,920
Speaker 9:  obituaries and news and journalism and like lifestyle

408
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,400
Speaker 9:  stuff. Like what they do is they bundle like, I'm bored and I

409
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,320
Speaker 9:  wanna see something from people I follow. I'm bored and I wanna see things

410
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,000
Speaker 9:  that maybe, I don't know I, I want You know, which is actually where they've

411
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,920
Speaker 9:  scaled a lot. I want to publish something. And then finally like I

412
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Speaker 9:  wanna see how people are interacting with the thing. I published, I guess

413
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,960
Speaker 9:  maybe a fifth, I wanna reply to things that people have published or share

414
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,240
Speaker 9:  things that people published. That's a really lovely loop. And actually one

415
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,960
Speaker 9:  of the things I I miss most about Kind the Reader days is like

416
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,120
Speaker 9:  how much it would get me to blog. Hmm. Because when I was kind of one click

417
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,120
Speaker 9:  or I used the WordPress Bookmarklet You know I could be on indie site

418
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,960
Speaker 9:  reading any article and it was just one click to kinda share that to my blog.

419
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,320
Speaker 9:  But at some point, I think especially with WordPress making the title so

420
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,520
Speaker 9:  prominent, like we, we made it a little too heavy to do a post and I

421
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,400
Speaker 9:  want something a little bit more like a Cott Key or Daring Fireball

422
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,040
Speaker 9:  or like some of these longstanding blogs and I've, how I've been trying to

423
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,000
Speaker 9:  redesign my blog Ma tt is to also have these titleless posts

424
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,920
Speaker 9:  which are a little just lower You know the big title and the big image really

425
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,080
Speaker 9:  makes you feel like you gotta write like an essay, gotta do something like,

426
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,800
Speaker 9:  like you post where it's like really thought through and has lots of, but

427
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
Speaker 9:  sometimes I just wanna shoot something off a little shorter. It's not really

428
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,160
Speaker 9:  a tweet 'cause I wanna have links and like I want it to be rich, but it's,

429
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,640
Speaker 9:  it's not like a essay either. It's not You know one of these Magnum opuses

430
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,200
Speaker 9:  that Mark Andre or Paul Graham post.

431
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,350
Speaker 3:  I've been researching this stuff and talking to people about it for months

432
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,390
Speaker 3:  now and here's what I think. I think this is the way, I think

433
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,070
Speaker 3:  it's a shame that we've all gotten used to giving away all of our posts and

434
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,830
Speaker 3:  all of our content just to get the engagement and connection that we get

435
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,630
Speaker 3:  from these platforms. I think it is possible to have it both ways and I think

436
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,270
Speaker 3:  a POSSE style system is a really cool way to get there.

437
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,590
Speaker 3:  Just as I'm hopeful that Activity Pub is gonna win and open up social to

438
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,070
Speaker 3:  many more platforms and systems and ways of thinking about the world.

439
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,240
Speaker 3:  I'm hopeful that POSSE can win too because I think we shouldn't be stuck

440
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,920
Speaker 3:  on platforms and more of the internet should belong to us and not companies.

441
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,720
Speaker 3:  And there are some really exciting signs here. I think the thing Blue Sky

442
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,480
Speaker 3:  is doing where you can use your domain name as your username is awesome.

443
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,840
Speaker 3:  A bunch of people I talk to mention that to me as one sign of doing

444
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,680
Speaker 3:  this exactly the right way. I also think tools like Micro Blog are a big

445
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,240
Speaker 3:  deal and I think the growth of these new platforms like Blue Sky and Macedon

446
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,280
Speaker 3:  can also bring new growth not just in how we post, but in how we consume

447
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,560
Speaker 3:  posts and how we sort them and how we organize them. All of this is being

448
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,480
Speaker 3:  broken into pieces in really interesting ways. I also think it might

449
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,600
Speaker 3:  just be impossible to pull all of this off. The truth is we do live

450
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,280
Speaker 3:  in an era of walled gardens where the biggest businesses in the world have

451
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,920
Speaker 3:  figured out how to keep us and our posts glued to their feed and

452
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,440
Speaker 3:  addicted to their published buttons. For POSSE to Work, we'll basically take

453
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,600
Speaker 3:  a complete reinvention of the internet from the blogging software to

454
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,440
Speaker 3:  the social networks to like literally the GoDaddy interface. All of it

455
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,160
Speaker 3:  is gonna have to change in order for this to work in big, meaningful

456
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,120
Speaker 3:  internet shaping ways. If all of that does happen, and again, I'm hopeful

457
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,160
Speaker 3:  but skeptical that it will happen, it won't happen fast or soon. Even

458
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,800
Speaker 3:  in 2012 when the indie web community was first talking about

459
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,080
Speaker 3:  POSSE, the web was a more open and less commercialized place than it is

460
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,320
Speaker 3:  now. Now, I mean, You know what it's like to be online, it's just commerce

461
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,080
Speaker 3:  everywhere. So stay tuned on POSSE and PESOS. But here

462
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,000
Speaker 3:  is my one piece of very specific advice for right now, buy a

463
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,640
Speaker 3:  domain name. If you don't already have one, buy one that feels like it could

464
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,560
Speaker 3:  be your internet home, your username, your blog, your archive, your

465
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,680
Speaker 3:  publish button, your everything. Personally, I bought David Pierce

466
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,760
Speaker 3:  XYZ a while ago for this exact purpose, but I'm looking at it now and I could

467
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,680
Speaker 3:  be David Pierce dot social, david Pierce dot guitars, david Pierce dot bingo,

468
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,560
Speaker 3:  which actually rules David Pierce dot golf, David Pierce dot apartments,

469
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,520
Speaker 3:  and so many other things. Get a domain and get ready for the future when

470
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,000
Speaker 3:  that domain is like your phone number or your email address or your

471
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,440
Speaker 3:  username, that it is the signal of the part of the internet that actually

472
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,360
Speaker 3:  belongs to you. I don't know how long it's gonna take for it to be like that,

473
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,640
Speaker 3:  but I think it's gonna be great.

474
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,480
