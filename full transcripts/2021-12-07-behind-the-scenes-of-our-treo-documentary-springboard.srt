00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,530
Speaker 2:  Greetings mobile. Accomplishers welcome to the Vergecast. I am Dieter

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,100
Speaker 2:  Bohn and this is another entry in our special run of topic.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,090
Speaker 2:  Specific Tuesday episodes. This week, we are bringing you another

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,900
Speaker 2:  conversation from our 10 year anniversary party. It was called on the

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,530
Speaker 2:  verge specifically. We're going to play a conversation that Nila Patel and

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,190
Speaker 2:  I had after the world, premier of our documentary, it's called

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,280
Speaker 2:  springboard the secret history of the first real

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,230
Speaker 2:  smartphone. And there weren't,

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,960
Speaker 4:  You can go buy you. Couldn't go to the market and say, build memory of these

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,800
Speaker 4:  tanks. We,

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,130
Speaker 5:  The cough like a rocket. Everybody wanted this

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,600
Speaker 5:  product.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,170
Speaker 3:  The documentary is about a nearly forgotten company called handspring, which

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,950
Speaker 3:  made visor, PDAs and trio smartphones years

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,730
Speaker 3:  before the iPhone. You can watch it now on our smart TV

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,600
Speaker 3:  apps that are on Roku, fire, TV, apple TV, and Android

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,230
Speaker 3:  TV by searching for the verge. Or as of today, it's

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,260
Speaker 3:  also available on our YouTube channel, which is

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,010
Speaker 3:  youtube.com/the verge. I think that you're going to find a conversation to

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,580
Speaker 3:  just be a bit richer, more interesting if you've watched the documentary,

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,210
Speaker 3:  but I will play a couple of clips from it here on this podcast. Before we

23
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,720
Speaker 3:  get started with conversation, just to give you some context on a personal

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,410
Speaker 3:  note, I'm really proud of what the verge video team did here, but I'm

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,190
Speaker 3:  also personally happy to have put this thing out into the world. I

26
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,030
Speaker 3:  really do feel like the people behind handspring haven't gotten the credit

27
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,810
Speaker 3:  that they deserve. And my hope for springboard is that it goes some way towards

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,140
Speaker 3:  setting the record straight about who some of the early innovators were in

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,830
Speaker 3:  the smartphone space. If you've been following my

30
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,340
Speaker 3:  work for a long time, you might know that I got my start in

31
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,590
Speaker 3:  journalism by hanging out on the

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,780
Speaker 3:  forums@visorcentraldotcomandthenwritingfortriocentral.com.

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,770
Speaker 3:  In fact, my little intro here at the top of the podcast, greetings

34
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,400
Speaker 3:  mobile accomplishers is actually a reference to

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,270
Speaker 3:  Palm. See, back when Palm introduced the trio six 80,

36
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,840
Speaker 3:  just a few months before the iPhone was announced, they were trying to

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
Speaker 3:  describe who the target market was for the smartphone. And back in

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,220
Speaker 3:  2006, nobody really knew if smartphones are

39
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,030
Speaker 3:  actually going to take off blackberries or for email and

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,990
Speaker 3:  other smartphones are really not mass market yet. So palms idea

41
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,530
Speaker 3:  for the trio six 80 was that it was targeted towards quote mobile

42
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,190
Speaker 3:  accomplishers, which was something that was like not quite a regular consumer,

43
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,180
Speaker 3:  but not really business people either. You know, it's pretty common for companies

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,080
Speaker 3:  to come up with categories for their target demographic, but I just thought

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,560
Speaker 3:  the phrase mobile accomplishers was funny. So I started using it to

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,130
Speaker 3:  introduce the trio central trio cast. And I've been introducing

47
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,670
Speaker 3:  podcasts with that phrase kind of ever since greetings mobile

48
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,010
Speaker 3:  accomplishers here we are the sprint trio pro. We are readings mobile.

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,700
Speaker 3:  Accomplishers welcome to the verge mobile show. Anyway, this is

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,570
Speaker 3:  all just to point out that I have been reporting on smartphones since

51
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,020
Speaker 3:  forever, but more importantly, I want to put some of our

52
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,940
Speaker 3:  discussion about handspring into

53
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,720
Speaker 3:  context. Springboard is about a

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,990
Speaker 3:  period of time. That's roughly say 1998 to

55
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,650
Speaker 3:  2006, 2007. And back then the smartphone world

56
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,220
Speaker 3:  looked very different than it does today. Like I said, there was

57
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 3:  Blackberry, but there was also Symbion there was pocket PC and

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,480
Speaker 3:  eventually windows mobile, Android didn't exist back then. And the iPhone

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,050
Speaker 3:  didn't exist back then. And nobody really knew how this market was going

60
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,740
Speaker 3:  to shake out except that a few people knew just how

61
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,640
Speaker 3:  big it was going to be a phrase that's been kicked around a lot in

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,420
Speaker 3:  Silicon valley, since it was originally introduced by John Sculley,

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,290
Speaker 3:  the former CEO of apple, when Steve jobs got sent away before he

64
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,130
Speaker 3:  came back, it was called the mother of all markets. And

65
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,880
Speaker 3:  at Palm, they actually had a little spinny sign and one sign pointed up to

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,750
Speaker 3:  mother of all markets. And the bottom of it was a pipe dream driven by greed

67
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,090
Speaker 3:  or something. And no one really knew where it was going to be with the PDA

68
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,300
Speaker 3:  market. And no one really knew where the smartphone market would land, but

69
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,690
Speaker 3:  everybody in the back of their mind, especially at handspring had a sense

70
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,530
Speaker 3:  that the smartphone market was going to be huge, that it was going to be

71
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,430
Speaker 3:  the mother of all markets. And they tried to make that happen,

72
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,180
Speaker 3:  but they were way too small. They were really scrappy and they faced

73
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,960
Speaker 3:  very long odds. There are lots of things working

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
Speaker 3:  against handspring, but the biggest thing working against handspring

75
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,430
Speaker 3:  was the carriers. The companies that actually sold the phones,

76
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,240
Speaker 3:  they had so much power back then. It was impossible to sell a

77
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,990
Speaker 3:  phone without them. And in many ways the I-phones biggest

78
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,600
Speaker 3:  innovation was taking some power away from those

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,230
Speaker 3:  carriers. So here's a brief clip from the springboard

80
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,680
Speaker 3:  documentary where some of the people from handspring talk about how

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,560
Speaker 3:  difficult it was to get anybody to just sell the

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,790
Speaker 3:  trio.

83
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,300
Speaker 6:  At times, these deals were so big. You're talking about the survival of the

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,290
Speaker 6:  company. The degree of gamesmanship could get

85
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,280
Speaker 6:  so intense. Your entire dream will fail

86
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,270
Speaker 6:  unless you agree to put this app on your launcher,

87
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,030
Speaker 4:  They were interested in adding features to their phones. They didn't view

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,480
Speaker 4:  it as a computer. They said, it's a phone everyone's going to fall on. And

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,070
Speaker 4:  phones are dominant. We were thinking, no, the future is going to be the

90
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,930
Speaker 4:  computers. And the phone is a,

91
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,230
Speaker 5:  I remember clearly going to sprint and saying, great

92
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,070
Speaker 5:  idea. Now, guess what? You can take a photo

93
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,000
Speaker 5:  right on this thing and send it to somebody. And they said, nah,

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,540
Speaker 5:  we don't want to do that. Our other devices can't do that. They

95
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,750
Speaker 5:  also were one of the principal resellers of the product. It went through

96
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,920
Speaker 5:  their stores. We made

97
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,670
Speaker 4:  The first products and they wouldn't sell them. They said, no, we can't.

98
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,430
Speaker 4:  We're not going to sell these things. You have to make the following changes.

99
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,610
Speaker 3:  Okay, one more clip. I want to play for you before we get started, it's a

100
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,450
Speaker 3:  very brief and abbreviated history of Palm and

101
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,030
Speaker 3:  handspring. Now, again, the springboard documentary only covers a portion

102
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,960
Speaker 3:  of this, but you can get a sense of just how complicated the corporate

103
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,560
Speaker 3:  history of Palm is by listening to this little clip. One of the big

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,520
Speaker 3:  reasons that Palm never really managed to take on the iPhone is it spent

105
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,480
Speaker 3:  all of the years leading up to the iPhone, just dealing with various

106
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,380
Speaker 3:  corporate shenanigans. They founded Palm, which was bought by us

107
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,190
Speaker 3:  robotics, which got bought by three com three comm refuse to spin

108
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,090
Speaker 3:  off Palm. So Donna and Jeff quit to start handspring.

109
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,870
Speaker 3:  Meanwhile, their old company, three com finally did spin off

110
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,530
Speaker 3:  Palm, but they split it into two divisions, one for

111
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,490
Speaker 3:  hardware and one to sell software. The Palm hardware

112
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,970
Speaker 3:  division screwed up the market with excess inventory and the Palm

113
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,690
Speaker 3:  software division. Well, it didn't accomplish very much at all. Handspring

114
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,650
Speaker 3:  then runs out of money. So the Palm hardware division buys them, but

115
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,070
Speaker 3:  they refused to buy back the Palm software division. So the family's back

116
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,520
Speaker 3:  together again, and they would continue to sell trios for years to come.

117
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Speaker 3:  But the family trauma isn't over. Here's what was going to

118
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,170
Speaker 3:  happen next for Paul, Jeff and Donna would step away, but ed

119
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,100
Speaker 3:  collagen stayed on to give it another go at the new Palm,

120
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,060
Speaker 3:  but that separate Palm software company sold off and withered

121
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,990
Speaker 3:  away. So the new Palm had to sell windows, mobile trios, and then

122
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,920
Speaker 3:  start over again with new software called web iOS. Then they

123
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,460
Speaker 3:  ran out of money and had to sell the HP. And then

124
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,360
Speaker 3:  HP finally killed Paul. All right,

125
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,350
Speaker 3:  like I said, you can go watch the full springboard documentary on our

126
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,410
Speaker 3:  smart TV apps. Or you can go to our YouTube channel,

127
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,800
Speaker 3:  youtube.com/diverge to watch it there up next. My

128
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,100
Speaker 3:  conversation with Nila that followed the world, premier of the documentary

129
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,420
Speaker 3:  at our 10 year anniversary

130
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:50,480
Speaker 3:  party.

131
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,840
Speaker 8:  So I think Nila is coming up. I'm not sure where he is, but

132
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,080
Speaker 8:  actually I don't want you to plot for me. I didn't make

133
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,010
Speaker 8:  fish. I went on camera. The, the verge video team made this and there

134
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,490
Speaker 8:  stand up, please stand up. Come

135
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,550
Speaker 8:  on,

136
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,480
Speaker 9:  Buddy. Also to the Virginia team, I did a

137
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,900
Speaker 9:  lot. I'm so happy you saw my movie. All right.

138
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,800
Speaker 9:  Data. I have a number of questions. Okay. How do

139
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,530
Speaker 9:  we break the hold of the,

140
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,520
Speaker 8:  Well, what you need to do is be apple and read a

141
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,450
Speaker 8:  revolutionary new phone and just do the whole thing all

142
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,200
Speaker 8:  over again. It's really we're back in a lot of ways, right?

143
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,170
Speaker 9:  We do feel like we're backing a lot of ways. The carriers do have a lot of

144
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,290
Speaker 9:  control over products, but it does seem like the tide has

145
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,190
Speaker 9:  turned apple and Google do get to sort of do whatever they want. But there

146
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,610
Speaker 9:  are a lot of parallels to this moment, to that moment, like a new

147
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,830
Speaker 9:  company finds it very hard to make a phone.

148
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,550
Speaker 8:  Well, a new company can, it's easy to make a phone now just like to

149
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,950
Speaker 8:  build the phone. One of the, one of the stories here is when they wanted

150
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,820
Speaker 8:  to build the visor phone, like, okay, well let's go get a radio. Well

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,270
Speaker 8:  where they had to, like, they found like a company I think in France. And

152
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,720
Speaker 8:  that was the only place they could find a radio that would connect to a cellular

153
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,560
Speaker 8:  network. Now you can show up in Shenzen and be like, make me a

154
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,120
Speaker 8:  phone. And they're like, what? Which parts would you like? Here we go. Bang,

155
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,890
Speaker 8:  bang, bang, bang. So that part is easy, but getting a

156
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,370
Speaker 8:  phone that is actually something that will make it into the carrier stores,

157
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,330
Speaker 8:  get carrier marketing and be something that can be successful on a pretty

158
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,080
Speaker 8:  big scale is much more difficult. It's impossible to imagine a

159
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,320
Speaker 8:  tiny company, the size of what handspring was, would be able to

160
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,920
Speaker 8:  like believe that they could break into the smartphone market right now.

161
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,210
Speaker 8:  But

162
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,160
Speaker 9:  That's like, there's a myth in our industry, in our world that if you make

163
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,080
Speaker 9:  a great product, the market will find you

164
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,830
Speaker 9:  and you will be a success in the market is still under the control of like

165
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,370
Speaker 9:  a tiny handful. And if you sell your products to sprint, you'll

166
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,350
Speaker 8:  Die.

167
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,800
Speaker 9:  It's like how many times the sprint killed pawn separately. It's

168
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,580
Speaker 9:  actually you'll notice that we didn't get to web alas. I feel like I need

169
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,590
Speaker 9:  good left is,

170
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,650
Speaker 8:  Well, I mean like I was inspired by doing, you know, they just ended in the

171
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,230
Speaker 8:  middle.

172
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,350
Speaker 9:  Why'd you why'd you decide to start here. I feel like a lot of our audience

173
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,600
Speaker 9:  knows that you'd care a lot about Palm and web west. Why did you decide to

174
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,000
Speaker 9:  start? It's such a primitive zone

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,750
Speaker 8:  Because I don't think the story is well known. And I think that there's

176
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,510
Speaker 8:  a, there's a, I don't know if there's a hopeful element here. Like they came

177
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,410
Speaker 8:  up with these ideas. They were trying to make a

178
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,340
Speaker 8:  wonderful product and thinking really deeply about the user experience and

179
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,230
Speaker 8:  the customer experience and how apps should work and all of that. Like there's,

180
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,840
Speaker 8:  there's just, they don't get the credit that I think they deserve for it.

181
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,620
Speaker 8:  And I feel like, I mean, one, we, we started this six

182
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,010
Speaker 8:  months ago, so trying to tell the rest of that story would have

183
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,850
Speaker 8:  been a lot longer, but I felt like there was an arc

184
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,630
Speaker 8:  here to like this specific company and this thing that they try to do that

185
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,600
Speaker 8:  like starts with some drama. There's some, there was drama before this, by

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,530
Speaker 8:  the way. And then, you know, ends with, you know, it's, it's a

187
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,190
Speaker 8:  sad story, but like they were still trying, but the company of

188
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,640
Speaker 8:  handspring and the thing that they were trying to make, you know, it's not

189
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,150
Speaker 8:  a well-known enough story basically. What'd you leave out? Well, we left

190
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,990
Speaker 8:  out all of them. . I mean, if there's that, actually this was, you

191
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,440
Speaker 8:  know, post this, but there was a famous quote that ed

192
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,370
Speaker 8:  collagen gave it the Churchill club. They like do these breakfast talks or

193
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,330
Speaker 8:  whatever that if you read daring fireball and John Gruber, he loves to quote

194
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,050
Speaker 8:  this thing where he was talking to John Markoff I think.

195
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,530
Speaker 8:  And he said something to the effect of PC guys, aren't going to figure this

196
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,070
Speaker 8:  out PC guys. Aren't just going to walk in to the phone market to the phone

197
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,940
Speaker 8:  market was, was it, it was assumed that he was referring just to

198
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,430
Speaker 8:  apple saying that they're not going to figure this out. This is like, phones

199
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,860
Speaker 8:  are really complicated. If all you do is make PCs. You're not going to be

200
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,700
Speaker 8:  to figure this out. And you know, he has been lambasted for this

201
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,660
Speaker 8:  quite a bit. He, he contends, he's taken a little bit out of context. I didn't

202
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,470
Speaker 8:  put it in. Cause like I just

203
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,870
Speaker 3:  Gave you a long story that involves talking about during fireball. I don't

204
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,590
Speaker 3:  know if it fits in a documentary like this, but also the, the actual

205
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,520
Speaker 3:  archive of it is currently Mia. So I couldn't like

206
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,460
Speaker 3:  go verify that he believes he was talking. He was talking with the PC industry

207
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,420
Speaker 3:  at large. So funny story, since we recorded this live

208
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,990
Speaker 3:  show, back in October, we did manage to get a hold of the original

209
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,410
Speaker 3:  interview. So I'm going to play just a couple of clips from it. Now, for

210
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,280
Speaker 3:  context, I want to read how collagen was originally quoted in this interview

211
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,180
Speaker 3:  in print in the San Jose mercury news. And the quote goes like this

212
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,960
Speaker 3:  PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They're not going to

213
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,770
Speaker 3:  just walk in unquote. Now, as I mentioned on the live show, John

214
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,700
Speaker 3:  Gruber over it during fireball has quoted collagen on this very often

215
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,390
Speaker 3:  or the past 15 years, at least 20 times by my account. And so it's

216
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,960
Speaker 3:  become a bit of a meme. It's become a shorthand for how everybody

217
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,920
Speaker 3:  underestimated apple before the iPhone launched. But I don't think

218
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,580
Speaker 3:  that's an accurate reading exactly. Once you hear the full quote and the

219
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,450
Speaker 3:  context, see the context here is that they were speaking weeks before the

220
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,350
Speaker 3:  original iPhone was announced and nobody really knew what it would be. So

221
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,530
Speaker 3:  in the interview, mark Robin collagen speculate a bit on what apple might

222
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,130
Speaker 3:  be working on. And then mark off jumps into his next question where he not

223
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,550
Speaker 3:  only asks about future competition from apple, but also from

224
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,600
Speaker 3:  Google.

225
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,500
Speaker 10:  What will it look like? In 2007? You know, apple does get in, Eric's

226
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,830
Speaker 10:  wandering around talking about free phones. He's got Andy Rubin, who is

227
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,280
Speaker 10:  the founder of danger doing something inside. He bought Andy's

228
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,430
Speaker 10:  startup. The phone market could look, I mean, it looks crowded. Now it could

229
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,810
Speaker 10:  look intensely crowded. Nick.

230
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,130
Speaker 11:  Next year,

231
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,000
Speaker 3:  The Eric, there is Eric Schmidt who was then the CEO of Google and Andy

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,750
Speaker 3:  Rubin startup was what became Android. This was of course before Android

233
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,360
Speaker 3:  launched. Also, anyway, here's collagen reply.

234
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,960
Speaker 11:  It's intensely big. We just have to get our fair share of the pie. And let

235
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,680
Speaker 11:  me tell you, this is not as easy as it looks. Okay. You

236
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,890
Speaker 11:  know, you've seen Motorola one of the biggest phone companies in the

237
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,460
Speaker 11:  world and or with a device that was going to take over the world and it's

238
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,690
Speaker 11:  had enormous issue.

239
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,980
Speaker 10:  You're talking about queue. Yeah,

240
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,880
Speaker 3:  That Q would be the Motorola Q a very hyped up

241
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,840
Speaker 3:  windows, mobile smartphone that had a Cordy keyboard, but no touch screen,

242
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,560
Speaker 3:  terrible battery life, and really only so-so sales. So here's

243
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,460
Speaker 3:  collagen again. And I want you to pay attention to the tone of his voice

244
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,060
Speaker 3:  here, but also how the actual words he uses are not the

245
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,980
Speaker 3:  exact quote that I read earlier.

246
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,880
Speaker 11:  And so I just would caution people that think

247
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,150
Speaker 11:  they're going to walk in here and just, and do these. We've struggled for

248
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,630
Speaker 11:  a few years here, figuring out how to make a decent phone. The PC guys are

249
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,540
Speaker 11:  not gonna just, you know, knock this out. I guarantee

250
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,500
Speaker 11:  it. So look, you know, welcome,

251
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,770
Speaker 11:  you know, let's, let's go for it. I, I, we can't stop all that it's going

252
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,130
Speaker 11:  to happen, but it's going to be, yeah, I don't think it will be so easy

253
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,190
Speaker 11:  for everybody that everybody thinks to enter it. It's a tough space.

254
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,860
Speaker 3:  The difference between the old quote PC guys are not going to just figure

255
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,950
Speaker 3:  this out. They're not just going to walk in and what you heard Callie and

256
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,710
Speaker 3:  actually say here, I think is notable. There's a bit more humility

257
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,460
Speaker 3:  here than Coggins traditionally gotten credit for. And the topic is specifically

258
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,240
Speaker 3:  that making smartphones is hard. Anyway, Markoff also catches onto

259
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,080
Speaker 3:  this whole vibe that you get whenever a company has when there's a huge

260
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,380
Speaker 3:  competitor about to come in and eat their lunch. So he asked about that specifically

261
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,000
Speaker 3:  in the next question. ,

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,250
Speaker 10:  I've been around this industry long enough that you probably remember, maybe

263
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,820
Speaker 10:  you don't actually the famous wall street journal ad that apple took out

264
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,420
Speaker 10:  in 1981. Welcome. IBM, seriously. Yeah.

265
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,200
Speaker 10:  Right.

266
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,070
Speaker 11:  Well, look, I, you know, I'm not, I'm not trying to

267
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,030
Speaker 11:  be cocky about it. It is a tough, it's a tough business. We've

268
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,450
Speaker 11:  really struggled through that. You know, in the sense of making world-class

269
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,080
Speaker 11:  radios that perform on global networks consistently with all the

270
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,960
Speaker 11:  applications that we,

271
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,300
Speaker 3:  So that's the original interview. And well, I think it's fair to say that

272
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,600
Speaker 3:  collagen was putting on a brave face for apple jumped into his

273
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,530
Speaker 3:  market. I also think it's fair to say that really he was talking about the

274
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,220
Speaker 3:  rest of the industry that didn't have much experience with smartphones,

275
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,210
Speaker 3:  apple. Sure. But also Google and even Motorola. And when I asked

276
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,990
Speaker 3:  CogAT about it specifically during the interviews for the springboard

277
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,770
Speaker 3:  documentary, he said that his main point was that it was hard. And also

278
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,490
Speaker 3:  that he was a little bummed that this one section of an otherwise pretty

279
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,820
Speaker 3:  good hour long interview is the thing that gets quoted the most.

280
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,200
Speaker 9:  And he was right about that.

281
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,580
Speaker 8:  That's an excellent point.

282
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,480
Speaker 9:  Have any of you ever used a phone made by Dell? Yeah.

283
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,690
Speaker 9:  Right. I, I have it. Wasn't

284
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,440
Speaker 9:  great. Yeah. Right. Do any of you use a phone

285
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,910
Speaker 9:  made by a little company called

286
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,660
Speaker 9:  Microsoft? I'm actually, I was like,

287
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,650
Speaker 9:  assuming there'd be one person here. It's

288
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,440
Speaker 9:  just like given our audience, but like the PC guys did not

289
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
Speaker 8:  Figure it out. No, they did not.

290
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
Speaker 9:  What else? What were the other pieces? Cause when he puts this other, something

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,420
Speaker 9:  of this, you only got 30 minutes. There are some things you have to let go

292
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,850
Speaker 9:  of. And I know that you

293
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,840
Speaker 8:  There's more and more stories of carriers being dumb.

294
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,180
Speaker 8:  Japan, Taiwan,

295
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,780
Speaker 9:  30 minutes

296
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,870
Speaker 8:  Of donkey. Jeff Hawkins rolled into a meeting

297
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,410
Speaker 8:  in for a carrier in France. And the guy

298
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,130
Speaker 8:  refused to believe that Cordie keyboards were a thing. And at the time the

299
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,260
Speaker 8:  capacitive screens weren't really there yet. They were using resistance screen.

300
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,000
Speaker 8:  So a touch screen keyboard wasn't like viable. So Curry keyboards were the

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,970
Speaker 8:  shit. And like blackberries were doing it. They were doing it on the trio.

302
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,750
Speaker 8:  And so he rolls in and the carrier guys like, you know,

303
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,620
Speaker 8:  Courtney keyboards will never be as fast as T nine. And I challenge you to

304
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,580
Speaker 8:  erase, to type something and you have to put the phone

305
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,700
Speaker 8:  under the table. And so Jeff Hawkins had to race this guy with phones under

306
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,850
Speaker 8:  the table that he could type on accord to keyboard faster than T nine. And

307
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,250
Speaker 8:  he won. He won four. Of course he won. Come on.

308
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,850
Speaker 9:  Yeah. That makes sense. So yeah, we're going to take questions. So you

309
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,600
Speaker 9:  have lineup over there. The one thing that as I watched

310
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,450
Speaker 9:  this, you know, we have seen this documentary a lot, but watching it with

311
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,930
Speaker 9:  all of you, it seems like Donna Dubinsky does

312
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,680
Speaker 9:  not get the credit she deserves for being a pioneer in this industry.

313
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,560
Speaker 9:  Yeah.

314
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,430
Speaker 8:  She came on, she was, you know, the CEO, she used to work at

315
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,060
Speaker 8:  apple, like the, the number of like fights at these three executives. But

316
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,840
Speaker 8:  Donna and ed in particular who both were at apple had with, with

317
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,170
Speaker 8:  Steve jobs that like aren't in this cut, like there's a lot, they would,

318
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,950
Speaker 8:  they would call and yell at each other all the time. And you know, she talked

319
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,580
Speaker 8:  about how fast the company grew. It, there were there magazine articles of

320
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,450
Speaker 8:  like the Titans of, you know, Silicon valley at the time. And you like, look

321
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,350
Speaker 8:  at these pictures of these people. There's like, it's, it's 15 white

322
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,340
Speaker 8:  dudes and Donna in the middle. And like, she's so much shorter

323
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,710
Speaker 8:  than two. And you know, it's like the late nineties. So they're all wearing

324
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,890
Speaker 8:  pants that are like, you know, this wide, like what it was. But yeah, it

325
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,880
Speaker 8:  was remarkable. She was, she was successful and dynamic and you

326
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,780
Speaker 8:  know, doing really well, they just, they hit these dramas. I, the joke that

327
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,650
Speaker 8:  I make is that the history of Pullman handspring is every 18

328
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,800
Speaker 8:  months. If somebody would have just given them $300 million, they would have

329
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,430
Speaker 8:  won their own feet a

330
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,240
Speaker 8:  bunch. But

331
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,930
Speaker 9:  Yeah. What do you see now that reminds you of that, of that

332
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,800
Speaker 9:  excitement, not the excitement. Where are the small companies that if

333
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Speaker 9:  only someone would just give them the money and the time. Yeah.

334
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,590
Speaker 8:  And they would break through, well, there's a website called the verge. We're

335
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,950
Speaker 8:  very good. You'd like to give us a 300 mil.

336
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,790
Speaker 9:  We're just 18 months away from defeating apple. She

337
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,630
Speaker 9:  could just help us out. That would be great. I think that, I see a lot of

338
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,590
Speaker 9:  those companies, it's a cliche now. Right? You

339
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,100
Speaker 9:  haven't made a product. You've made a feature where like somebody has a great

340
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,970
Speaker 9:  idea and we all love it. And the big company can just take it and like integrate

341
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,690
Speaker 9:  it in C operating system or they'll buy the nascent company and crush

342
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,380
Speaker 9:  it. And in many ways, buying the nascent company and

343
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,160
Speaker 9:  crushing it is a superior alternative to whatever happened upon me. Right?

344
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,060
Speaker 9:  Like that cycle of murders and deaths and spinoffs, and then HP kills

345
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,960
Speaker 9:  you is like, no, thanks. Right. Like I'd rather just like let Google

346
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,830
Speaker 9:  acqui-hire my company. Yeah. But I think I, I, I still feel

347
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,190
Speaker 9:  that right. Th the small companies don't get the

348
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,740
Speaker 9:  opportunity to take the market.

349
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,190
Speaker 8:  So the, I see excitement and dynamism all over the place. People making a

350
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,370
Speaker 8:  hardware and software tools for creators. There's just so much exciting stuff

351
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,310
Speaker 8:  going on there. The question is where do you see that excitement and that

352
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,300
Speaker 8:  possibility and the something the size of smartphones.

353
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,200
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And that is much more difficult to predict. And is there, is it possible

354
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,350
Speaker 8:  that there is a market that you could theoretically go after without the

355
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,340
Speaker 8:  resources of a tech giant? I'm not sure. I think that's one

356
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,250
Speaker 8:  of the reasons that maybe like crypto is so interesting to people is because

357
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,000
Speaker 8:  it seems like it's a potentially huge thing that you could get into

358
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,660
Speaker 8:  without being, you know, Google or apple or Microsoft.

359
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,670
Speaker 9:  For one second, I thought you were going to say the metaverse and I was going

360
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,090
Speaker 9:  to kick you

361
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,720
Speaker 9:  off.

362
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,780
Speaker 3:  We're gonna take a break. But when we come back, we'll have more of my conversation

363
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,720
Speaker 3:  with Neela about the history of smartphones. Plus some questions from the

364
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,590
Speaker 3:  audience.

365
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,320
Speaker 9:  All right. We're back. We've got some

366
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,270
Speaker 9:  questions. Let's start over here. Piney. Hi Dieter. Oh my God. The hype

367
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,470
Speaker 9:  desk is back. Hello, Sam, the

368
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,130
Speaker 9:  shadow. You know, that was really awesome to

369
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,060
Speaker 9:  watch. It's also crazy to think that so much happened in

370
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,990
Speaker 9:  20 years, 10 years, right? Like that iPhone came out in 2007. It's a long

371
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,800
Speaker 9:  time ago. Do you have a vision or

372
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,640
Speaker 9:  sort of like an idea or thoughts on what do things look like in 10

373
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,000
Speaker 9:  years with mobile computing, spacial computing, Aimee computing, and then

374
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,850
Speaker 9:  20 years. Cause that stuff was 2000 we're in 2021. Yeah. What

375
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,940
Speaker 9:  does, what does that future look like to you?

376
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,330
Speaker 8:  I'll give you 10 I'm too chicken to do 20 actually

377
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,170
Speaker 8:  I J Castroneves wonderful editor at the verge. I, I opened a final

378
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,360
Speaker 8:  draft on an article about this.

379
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,050
Speaker 9:  I stopped me for Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake,

380
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,810
Speaker 9:  Jake, Jake. It was like the third

381
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,910
Speaker 9:  time

382
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,600
Speaker 8:  Know. I think that that there's either going to be a radical,

383
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,440
Speaker 8:  like technological innovation that we can't see. Like screens will

384
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,040
Speaker 8:  go from folding to projecting into our, I familiar a little camera or

385
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,310
Speaker 8:  something. There'll be implanted some huge thing. And there's no way to predict,

386
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,610
Speaker 8:  or it will just be more relentless, incremental

387
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,300
Speaker 8:  innovation. And I say that in, it sounds like a bummer,

388
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,230
Speaker 8:  but from 2007 to now, it's arguably relentless

389
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,130
Speaker 8:  incremental innovation. And the cultural

390
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,820
Speaker 8:  changes that have been wrought by that those incremental

391
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,750
Speaker 8:  changes are massive. And so the smartphone 10

392
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,320
Speaker 8:  years from now may look very much like the smartphone that we have today,

393
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,980
Speaker 8:  just better cameras, better screens, better, you know, stuff. But that

394
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,910
Speaker 8:  doesn't mean that it doesn't still have the power to change.

395
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,830
Speaker 8:  Our culture changed the way we live our lives.

396
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,920
Speaker 9:  I have two answers. One of which is a relentless plug

397
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,730
Speaker 9:  one. I always look at display technologies,

398
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,630
Speaker 9:  right? That the thing that bounds the devices in our lives is the

399
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,480
Speaker 9:  display, right? So we CA we could not have smartphones with CRT

400
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,520
Speaker 9:  displays, although it would be

401
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,820
Speaker 9:  rad,

402
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,660
Speaker 9:  rad, we needed LCDs. And then we needed really thin LCDs. We

403
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,600
Speaker 9:  needed power efficient LCDs. We needed to touch

404
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,140
Speaker 9:  technology. That is the thing that makes technology

405
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,070
Speaker 9:  possible. We don't have a next display technology. We're really close in

406
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,070
Speaker 9:  some ways. I think Addie and Dieter corrected me on the verge cast a couple

407
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,500
Speaker 9:  of weeks ago. And I was like, it's all CDs. And like, no, there's a, there's

408
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,250
Speaker 9:  like hints of all their stuff, but there's not that turn. We might have folding.

409
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,490
Speaker 9:  So that's what I would look at because that is the thing that allows the

410
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,300
Speaker 9:  leap. The second thing is the restless plug, is we a

411
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,870
Speaker 9:  Nori, Donovan, RDP, and a bunch of other people diverge and I are. And a

412
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,330
Speaker 9:  bunch of other smart people I'm not doing anything might be working on a

413
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,020
Speaker 9:  show for a large streaming service about what life looks like 50 and a hundred

414
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,420
Speaker 9:  years in the future. Is that an exclusive,

415
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:33,620
Speaker 16:  So I'm

416
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,590
Speaker 9:  Pretty sure let's call it that. And I'm very, that's it's months away,

417
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,190
Speaker 9:  but we were spending a lot of time thinking about that. And I will tell you

418
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,000
Speaker 9:  not easy to predict the future, but we're doing our

419
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,520
Speaker 9:  best. So that'll come out later. Cool. Over here,

420
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,240
Speaker 16:  Hey, let us a proud owner of a Microsoft. So if you

421
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,030
Speaker 16:  ask about Microsoft phone owners is at least

422
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,380
Speaker 16:  one.

423
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,040
Speaker 16:  My question is, I think when you take any of these ideas, you can pursue

424
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,190
Speaker 16:  their origins down to, I mean like software keyboard, for example, you can

425
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,910
Speaker 16:  pursue them down from the iPhone to, to the handspring all the way down

426
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,670
Speaker 16:  to academia for a lot of these ideas. So when you try to tell the story

427
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,660
Speaker 16:  about the origin of ideas like this, where do you, how

428
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,720
Speaker 16:  do you think about where to start? Is it from the first product? Is it from

429
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,900
Speaker 16:  the origins of the ideas themselves and the people who wrote about them

430
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,180
Speaker 16:  thought about them? Or is it even earlier, where did you decide where to

431
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,440
Speaker 16:  start with, with the stories? Yeah,

432
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,960
Speaker 8:  I thought about that a lot. Cause it's like, am I, am I just wanting to tell

433
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,040
Speaker 8:  the story of spring? Cause that's how I got my start in reporting and I just

434
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,010
Speaker 8:  this whatever, and I, maybe this is rationalization, but I

435
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,640
Speaker 8:  feel like you start, I wanted to start with the products that

436
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,510
Speaker 8:  like had an audience and had a community and had like a real shot

437
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,290
Speaker 8:  at like hitting big numbers. I think that going

438
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,250
Speaker 8:  back to, before those products to academia, to there's again,

439
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,000
Speaker 8:  there's other Palmer Wes phones before this thing from Kyocera Wacom or

440
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,390
Speaker 8:  whoever, but the, these were the products

441
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,080
Speaker 8:  that like had more forward looking ideas

442
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,680
Speaker 8:  and also like had a commercial market and had a significant community around

443
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,160
Speaker 8:  them. Neil asked some of the stuff I left out the community

444
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,640
Speaker 8:  around visors and handspring and later Palm was

445
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,860
Speaker 8:  obviously very important to me, so.

446
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,700
Speaker 16:  Okay. Alright. Hi, my name is Scott. I have a question. I

447
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,250
Speaker 16:  don't know if I'm remembering this correctly, but I believe that Palm OOS

448
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,020
Speaker 16:  at one point was connecting to iTunes and apple killed

449
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,800
Speaker 16:  that. W so am I remembering that correctly? And if

450
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Speaker 16:  so, where does that fit into this timeline of this company?

451
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,490
Speaker 8:  I do not know if there was ever a bridge from Paul. My

452
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,160
Speaker 9:  God. I know something about Palm OST. You don't know to

453
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,960
Speaker 8:  ITunes

454
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,080
Speaker 9:  Everybody. It was great. Seeing all of

455
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,040
Speaker 9:  you.

456
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,250
Speaker 8:  Is it the missing sink? No. Okay. Now Weber

457
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,630
Speaker 8:  less.

458
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,270
Speaker 9:  See this that's my God. I just feel my power grow right

459
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,830
Speaker 9:  now.

460
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,190
Speaker 8:  WebQuest did connect to iTunes and on the all things D

461
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,070
Speaker 8:  stage that's when they had a chat, they showed it off. They,

462
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,540
Speaker 8:  they did it by making the Palm pre, which comes after the story,

463
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,600
Speaker 8:  identify as an iPod by its USB

464
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,990
Speaker 8:  identification. So when you plug it a USB device, it says I'm a

465
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,890
Speaker 8:  BA. And so the Palm print, when it plugged into a max that I'm an iPod and

466
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,310
Speaker 8:  then iTunes was like, cool let's sync. Yeah. And then apple did not like

467
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,180
Speaker 8:  that. They did not like, and then there was a cat and mouse game for, I don't

468
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,510
Speaker 8:  know, three, six months where apple would find a way to block it.

469
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,020
Speaker 8:  And Palm would find a way to turn it back on. And then they finally stopped

470
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,270
Speaker 8:  and they stopped doing it.

471
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,870
Speaker 9:  But earlier, do you see that digital hub slide, that famous Steve jobs

472
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,440
Speaker 9:  thing? You net there's no iPod in that slide, there was a creative

473
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,430
Speaker 9:  Rio. Yeah. Central light, full product. I

474
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,390
Speaker 9:  had one, I had it in college, 2003. He

475
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,380
Speaker 9:  got me zero dates. No one was interested in, but

476
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,100
Speaker 9:  apple had a product called Eye-Sync and it could transfer to other players.

477
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,010
Speaker 9:  And then they released the iPod and they cut all that off. So there was like

478
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,000
Speaker 9:  one tiny moment. And I know more about pawn then Dieter I'm done. Okay.

479
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,630
Speaker 8:  No, actually, if, if we're talking about music stuff, I may have

480
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,990
Speaker 8:  noticed it. I talked about the sound's good springboard module. It was an

481
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,890
Speaker 8:  MP3 module. That company got started and

482
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,820
Speaker 8:  there was a young intern at that company. And then the springboard

483
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,540
Speaker 8:  market died. So they moved on to push email

484
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,960
Speaker 8:  services. And then that company got bought by Motorola. And then that young

485
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,440
Speaker 8:  intern,

486
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,370
Speaker 9:  You guys wonder why we are so angsty about mergers on our

487
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,330
Speaker 9:  show. Every time it's like there a good idea, then I company bought

488
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,080
Speaker 9:  it and then they died.

489
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,110
Speaker 8:  I don't know, but that young intern moved up the ranks and Motorola, and

490
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,040
Speaker 8:  it was like, Hey, Razor's not going to last forever. We should make an Android

491
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,130
Speaker 8:  phone. And he talked them into it and he'd launched the

492
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,000
Speaker 8:  droid. And the droid is one of the phones that killed poem.

493
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Speaker 8:  And then Motorola got bought by Lenovo and Rick

494
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,220
Speaker 8:  Costello who currently is in charge of the

495
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,340
Speaker 8:  pixel.

496
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,700
Speaker 9:  So good.

497
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,300
Speaker 17:  Hi Dieter, huge trans since the trio central is I'm going to say three words

498
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,870
Speaker 17:  that might cause PTSD for you. Access Linux pro

499
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,680
Speaker 17:  platform.

500
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,710
Speaker 9:  So, oh God, he didn't even ask him. Why. So you mentioned

501
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,460
Speaker 17:  It. Dave mentioned it in there that the split between

502
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,450
Speaker 17:  Palm wine and Palm source happening, I personally think that schism was

503
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,350
Speaker 17:  one of the biggest cell phones in technology history. Do you think if

504
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,110
Speaker 17:  they hadn't split apart, they might've been able to execute a bit

505
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,370
Speaker 17:  better.

506
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,880
Speaker 8:  When handspring came back to Palm, the hardware

507
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,810
Speaker 8:  division, they were up to free up their license for Palm OLS

508
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,680
Speaker 8:  and, and collagen wanted to just buy them instead of

509
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,440
Speaker 8:  get a license. And the board said, no, just wrap the

510
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Speaker 8:  license, there's it. But it's only like another, some so-and-so million dollars

511
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,250
Speaker 8:  more. And they're like, nah. And so they gave the Palm

512
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,240
Speaker 8:  OSPF company, Palm source, all of this money. And then the Palm source

513
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,060
Speaker 8:  company was like, look at all this money that we just got paid. We must be

514
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,840
Speaker 8:  worth a lot of money. Does anybody want to buy us? And so they sold to a

515
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,050
Speaker 8:  company in Japan access. They made access to Lennox,

516
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,010
Speaker 8:  Palm and this like, nobody else was licensing this

517
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,910
Speaker 8:  operating system except for Paloma obviously. And so it sort of didn't have

518
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,900
Speaker 8:  anywhere to go. And the team that was developing a

519
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,860
Speaker 8:  lot of very interesting, innovative ideas for Palm

520
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,920
Speaker 8:  source, that access Linux Palm, they like

521
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,880
Speaker 8:  started leaving the company and they all started going to a place where

522
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,130
Speaker 8:  they're like, you know, there might be something interesting and cool here

523
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,060
Speaker 8:  we can execute these ideas. One of the most important engineers was a Diane

524
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,020
Speaker 8:  heck thorn. And that company was Google and they made it Android along

525
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,470
Speaker 8:  with the folks from sidekick. So yes. Biggest cell phone in history.

526
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,100
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Sometimes you wonder why Dieter knows everybody. And it's like, because

527
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,790
Speaker 9:  you knew them when they were babies. It's like one of the

528
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,420
Speaker 9:  secrets of 10 years of doing this is like, oh, we know a lot of

529
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,020
Speaker 9:  important people now because we paid attention to them when they were not

530
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,530
Speaker 9:  very important. And like go at coming up with people is like one of the

531
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,510
Speaker 9:  secrets and it just,

532
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,630
Speaker 18:  Hey, so I'm thinking back to like the HTC touch pro too. If you remember

533
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,380
Speaker 18:  that, like the, the windows mobile stuff. And then I feel like after that,

534
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,650
Speaker 18:  the next big leap was Microsoft went all in on the Lumia

535
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,130
Speaker 18:  devices, tried to push that windows eight tile stuff did not work out on

536
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,000
Speaker 18:  desktop or mobile. Do you think if Microsoft would have switched to Android

537
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,690
Speaker 18:  a lot earlier on what we have, like a whole suite of Microsoft, like, could

538
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,510
Speaker 18:  they be the pixel or similar to that? Is that a

539
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,500
Speaker 9:  Victory?

540
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,490
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I dunno. Neela, would you like to discuss? Cause it's been a minute.

541
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,230
Speaker 8:  The burning platform memo

542
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,860
Speaker 9:  Like two days in a row, Steven Elop references on this day, he might

543
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,340
Speaker 9:  recall Steven Elop went to Nokia. He became the

544
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,180
Speaker 9:  CEO and he wrote this memo about saving Nokia. You don't

545
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,840
Speaker 9:  recall this because you're saying people with lives, this is a very important

546
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,740
Speaker 9:  to us. And the memo was an extended allegory about people who

547
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,550
Speaker 9:  lived on an oil Derrick in the middle of the ocean

548
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,530
Speaker 9:  and the oil Derrick catches fire.

549
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,770
Speaker 8:  The oil Derrick in this metaphor is Symbion another competing smartphone

550
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,390
Speaker 8:  operating system.

551
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,540
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It's been a long time since I've read it, but I believe the choices

552
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,930
Speaker 9:  were to burn to death or to dive into the frigid

553
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,830
Speaker 9:  ocean. And he's like, sometimes he got a dive and this

554
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,690
Speaker 9:  was his management philosophy for this

555
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,500
Speaker 9:  company. And he's like, we're diving

556
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,430
Speaker 9:  and the, oh, the frigid ocean was windows phone.

557
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,000
Speaker 9:  Right? So there's like this big thing. And he sends us a memo and I'm imagining

558
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,960
Speaker 9:  I'm, I'm not finished. As you may have noticed. Maybe, maybe

559
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,740
Speaker 9:  this has some like, meaning if any of you are finished, let me know. It's

560
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,250
Speaker 9:  like people just talk about the burning oil Derrick all the time. But like

561
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,670
Speaker 9:  maybe it has some residents, but I imagine the employees of Nokia are like,

562
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,370
Speaker 9:  well, this sucks, but they could have picked. And I think if

563
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,210
Speaker 9:  Nokia had picked Android, the whole market may have been

564
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,930
Speaker 9:  different. But instead the ex Microsoft employee who took

565
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,350
Speaker 9:  over his Nokia CEO surprisingly picked

566
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,130
Speaker 9:  Microsoft platform. So Nokia, Microsoft, Microsoft

567
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,340
Speaker 9:  losses, CEO, they got a new CEO. Who's

568
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,920
Speaker 8:  Like, yeah, the more, these are just some guys

569
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,520
Speaker 9:  Who make choices. I feel like we like elevate CEOs a lot, like many times

570
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,640
Speaker 9:  they're just guys. And like, you might make the same choices. And I think

571
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,240
Speaker 9:  this is like a pivotal choice, but everyone around that choice was like,

572
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,320
Speaker 9:  you should've picked Android.

573
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,070
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean the, when I said like the current iPhone,

574
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,560
Speaker 8:  Android world, we live in it, wasn't inevitable. This is one of the things

575
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,490
Speaker 8:  that maybe could have changed it. And so the big question I think that

576
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,420
Speaker 8:  we face now that tech companies are so massive. Is,

577
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,290
Speaker 8:  is there still the potential for that kind of disruptive change that will

578
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,180
Speaker 8:  like re shift things around? And I, you know, my heart

579
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,640
Speaker 8:  wants to say yes, but I think that it's harder than it used to

580
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,450
Speaker 8:  be.

581
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,540
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And I think the, another carrier

582
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,350
Speaker 9:  reference, the carriers saw the duopoly and

583
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,250
Speaker 9:  they wanted Microsoft to be a third competitive thing. So they could

584
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,520
Speaker 9:  get price, leverage. They needed to get leverage against apple and they still

585
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,380
Speaker 9:  do. And like that was their decision. And I think Eli

586
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,350
Speaker 9:  saw a business opportunity and not a product opportunity. And that's always

587
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,490
Speaker 9:  a mistake.

588
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:03,480
Speaker 19:  I, I love the documentary and it got me thinking about how history

589
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,410
Speaker 19:  always repeats itself. And so I was wondering, do you see a device category

590
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,370
Speaker 19:  like VR or AR or small board computing that is kind of going through a similar

591
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,300
Speaker 19:  cycle where it just hasn't found its form factor yet. That is like the real

592
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,460
Speaker 19:  hit of the iPhone disclosure. Oh

593
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,200
Speaker 9:  God,

594
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,530
Speaker 19:  We did

595
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,120
Speaker 19:  it.

596
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,680
Speaker 8:  You just wanted me to get the,

597
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,710
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that's all I wanted. Also, if we are taping that we need to send that

598
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,190
Speaker 9:  to like every journalism, ethics college course in American,

599
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,610
Speaker 9:  like our disclosures are brand, which is super

600
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,140
Speaker 9:  weird.

601
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,210
Speaker 8:  Nobody applauds for disclosures. Here's

602
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,110
Speaker 8:  amazing. My spouse works for

603
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,010
Speaker 8:  a Oculus Facebook reality labs, the division of Facebook that works on VR

604
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,910
Speaker 8:  and maybe AR I don't actually know. I do think your, that said, I

605
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,810
Speaker 8:  do think that AR is like an interesting possibility. VR is interesting possibility,

606
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,440
Speaker 8:  but the screen thing is real and the resource thing is real.

607
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,230
Speaker 8:  Can you do, can you break into that without having a

608
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,650
Speaker 8:  platform? That's a pretty tough, I think I mentioned tools for

609
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,430
Speaker 8:  creators a little bit earlier, and this is not a fully formed idea, but I

610
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,820
Speaker 8:  think that people that are making stuff that doesn't just feel like it's

611
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,330
Speaker 8:  an accessory for the iPhone, or it's an accessory for the iPhone or Android

612
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,230
Speaker 8:  phone, but it has its own like independent existence in some way that

613
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,500
Speaker 8:  lets you make stuff. That's the most exciting thing to me right now. Like

614
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,980
Speaker 8:  musical tools, you know, creative tools. Yeah.

615
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,460
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I'm with that. We talk about the AR stuff on the podcast all the

616
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,450
Speaker 9:  time, the number of problems to solve from

617
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,790
Speaker 9:  how will you make the battery last all day to who gets to

618
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,600
Speaker 9:  decide who augments reality? Like just, I mean like

619
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,110
Speaker 9:  know Senate rebrand itself, but imagine you're wearing the Facebook glasses

620
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,980
Speaker 9:  and you look at the United States Capitol building, like you don't want your

621
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,790
Speaker 9:  uncle augmenting that image in front of your eyes, right?

622
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,760
Speaker 9:  Like you don't want to literally live in a different reality than the person

623
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,600
Speaker 9:  sitting next to you wearing the glasses. And like, that is the big problem,

624
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,080
Speaker 9:  right? Like my dream, I said this yesterday, like if I could just know all

625
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,890
Speaker 9:  your names, I would be the most powerful person in America, but

626
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,310
Speaker 9:  I cannot, and I will not remember your names and I refuse to get better at

627
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:13,180
Speaker 9:  it, but just like, imagine what you need to solve for that problem. You need

628
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,760
Speaker 9:  to build a worldwide facial recognition

629
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,630
Speaker 9:  database that seems bad. Like I'm

630
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,630
Speaker 9:  just going to keep introducing myself to you. Like that's a bad, that's a

631
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,720
Speaker 9:  preferable outcome. So like, I think AR is really interesting, but that sack

632
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,650
Speaker 9:  of problems from like the battery won't last very long too, everyone lives

633
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,400
Speaker 9:  in a different dystopian. Hellscape in the same, like that sweet.

634
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,390
Speaker 9:  Let's calm down, let's breathe. But I do think AR and

635
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,000
Speaker 9:  VR to me are still the most interesting.

636
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,960
Speaker 20:  Hello gents, real quick. Any comments or where does danger

637
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,030
Speaker 20:  fit into this whole narrative?

638
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,600
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean, they're, they're here, they're around. And I think the one

639
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,050
Speaker 8:  could make a very similar documentary about, about danger and about the

640
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,390
Speaker 8:  sidekick and similar set

641
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,200
Speaker 8:  of, but I think

642
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,950
Speaker 8:  that their influence, like it went into

643
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,790
Speaker 8:  Android, but a little bit more indirectly, Larry and Sergei were big psychic

644
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,690
Speaker 8:  fans. So like there's, there's an influence line there, but I don't

645
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,320
Speaker 8:  think that there's as like, I don't know, frankly, as tragic a story of like

646
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,730
Speaker 8:  yep. Almost had it.

647
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,340
Speaker 20:  The reason I bring them up is because they had the carrier relationship.

648
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,940
Speaker 20:  And so it's, to me, it's very interesting. Right. They had that with T-Mobile

649
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,450
Speaker 20:  like there was an interesting opportunity. They got it

650
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,380
Speaker 20:  to

651
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,660
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Having the carrier relationship doesn't mean you win Blackberry had

652
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,340
Speaker 8:  to carry a relationship.

653
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,790
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Plus I remember Timo was very small or carriers, not all the same

654
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,630
Speaker 9:  size. So being the cool partner on the smallest carrier, doesn't make you

655
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,650
Speaker 9:  win.

656
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,610
Speaker 21:  Thanks guys. So, you know, the documentary obviously did not

657
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,540
Speaker 21:  realize this like many people here did make

658
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,690
Speaker 21:  me realize though it seems very similar to the wearables market, right?

659
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,530
Speaker 21:  The whole Kickstarter pebble right market. They

660
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,350
Speaker 21:  pioneered a lot of pebble fans.

661
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,170
Speaker 9:  There's somebody here wearing a pebble. Do we have like a windows phone pebble

662
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,720
Speaker 9:  combo and the audience?

663
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,650
Speaker 21:  I guess my question is, do you see some parallels in how the wearables market

664
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,370
Speaker 21:  is sort of, you know, last 10 years, example of this happening to that

665
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,120
Speaker 21:  market pebble gets acquired and they're, you know, killed by Fitbit basically.

666
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,720
Speaker 8:  So in this metaphor, the wearables are the smartphones and the carriers are

667
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,090
Speaker 8:  the people that own the smartphone platforms. Yep.

668
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,330
Speaker 9:  Like if, imagine that you could get a notification on a watch that isn't

669
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,450
Speaker 9:  an iPhone, which you cannot, you can get notifications. You can't do, they're

670
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,320
Speaker 9:  not smart. Right? You can't just like reply to them. That is a feature limitation

671
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,930
Speaker 9:  of the platform that prevents a competitor from keep competing with the apple

672
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,190
Speaker 9:  watch. Like there it is. If you could get a notification and actually reply

673
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,970
Speaker 9:  to it on the phone, I guarantee you, some people will pick not an apple watch

674
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,690
Speaker 9:  to use with their iPhones, but like they're the carrier dealer has written

675
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,260
Speaker 9:  an excellent editorial about this actually. And he was like, should I pitch

676
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,250
Speaker 9:  it as the iPhone? Like the smartphone companies or the new carriers, something

677
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,180
Speaker 9:  like that. Yeah. And we decided to use the word carrier, but

678
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,360
Speaker 9:  when we say carrier, we say it with like malice and hatred in our

679
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,880
Speaker 9:  hearts.

680
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,840
Speaker 22:  Hi. So we talk a lot about hardware and software, where they

681
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,680
Speaker 22:  come from, where they go to and people make terrible

682
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,430
Speaker 22:  choices in buying hardware and using software all the time,

683
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,970
Speaker 22:  which leaves marketing, advertising, how products are positioned in the

684
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,810
Speaker 22:  market. And I'm just kind of curious, how do you think this story

685
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,710
Speaker 22:  relates in that kind of sense, whether it's the failure

686
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,640
Speaker 22:  of Hannah spring, the ascent of the iPhone, but like that's an important

687
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,510
Speaker 22:  way that markets are shaped. I feel like give me an example. I

688
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:33,260
Speaker 22:  think that you could have a terribly

689
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,410
Speaker 22:  designed product that maybe has a terrible user interface, terrible

690
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,950
Speaker 22:  software. And if it's positioned really well in the

691
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,670
Speaker 22:  market, if it's advertised and given some of this is comes down to

692
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,850
Speaker 22:  carrier deals, it comes down to money. It comes down to all of those things,

693
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,480
Speaker 22:  but like things that are really terrible that are like

694
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,870
Speaker 22:  genuinely garbage, get really popular and sell a ton of

695
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:57,710
Speaker 22:  units. And that's just due to other forces in the market.

696
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,580
Speaker 22:  And I look at this and given, I don't know the full history of handspring,

697
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,150
Speaker 22:  but like would promotion would different positioning

698
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:09,020
Speaker 22:  would any of that have shaped this differently? And given apple

699
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,410
Speaker 22:  knocks, marketing out of the park, every chance they get. So it was almost

700
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,220
Speaker 22:  a surefire bet that the iPhone would do well. But like, I just wonder

701
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,430
Speaker 22:  how the market, if you think the market would have shaped differently,

702
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,090
Speaker 8:  A cynical is that I think that it's a good product can

703
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:27,050
Speaker 8:  fail because it didn't get proper marketing, but I think bad products

704
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,800
Speaker 8:  will out and the best marketing does, isn't

705
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,760
Speaker 8:  gonna keep a bad product. Like it's not going to have longevity,

706
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,510
Speaker 8:  you know, you'll get one or two rounds maybe, but you're not going to, you're

707
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,870
Speaker 8:  not going to become like an important iconic product if it sucks. And I think

708
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,740
Speaker 8:  that I'm actually, I don't think marketing saves at that point,

709
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,610
Speaker 9:  Unless you're ruthlessly locked into its ecosystem,

710
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,430
Speaker 9:  but I, I am unsurprisingly more cynical than

711
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,360
Speaker 9:  Dieter. And it is thinking about us like a thousand

712
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,350
Speaker 9:  people asked me about scissor vodka yesterday. The whole joke

713
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,830
Speaker 9:  there is very dumb, but underlying it is like my friends. And

714
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,490
Speaker 9:  I realized that bid range vodka is a commodity

715
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:11,060
Speaker 9:  product. And we could just like tell jokes about marketing it. And we would

716
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,960
Speaker 9:  just yell vodka taglines at each other. And that's, that's the whole

717
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,890
Speaker 9:  joke, right? Like if you think apple makes the same

718
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,770
Speaker 9:  product as everyone else, but Steve jobs is a better marketer. They'll

719
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,310
Speaker 9:  win. I think apple makes great products. And the

720
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:29,270
Speaker 9:  marketing is a bonus cause they're really good at marketing. But

721
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,060
Speaker 9:  at the end of that, you get the thing home and you turn it on in either

722
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,810
Speaker 9:  it is horrible. And in your Android TV crashes a

723
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,590
Speaker 9:  lot and you have to answer to your family or it's really good. Right. And

724
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,190
Speaker 9:  like that is as simple as it gets. And I think with some kinds of products,

725
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,940
Speaker 9:  the marketing is the whole story, right? Like that is the vodka job. And

726
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,930
Speaker 9:  with other kinds of products, your experience and how you feel about it

727
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,760
Speaker 9:  instantly transcends the marketer.

728
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,690
Speaker 22:  So I think just a one, one super quick followup to that is had

729
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,590
Speaker 22:  handspring Ben positions correctly in the market had, and again,

730
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,650
Speaker 22:  money carrier deals, all that could handspring have

731
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,280
Speaker 22:  succeeded just by virtue of having better

732
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,820
Speaker 22:  marketing, better positioning, better, whatever that

733
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,690
Speaker 22:  extra something is because everything else there was in the

734
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,980
Speaker 22:  right place.

735
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,100
Speaker 8:  But I'm not, I'm not going to say that they would have. I think that they

736
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,790
Speaker 8:  had really good ideas. I think that they executed them pretty badly in, in

737
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,180
Speaker 8:  these products. Cause they just didn't have the resources. They need to execute

738
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,110
Speaker 8:  them well, but that's not a guarantee that

739
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,240
Speaker 8:  they would have made it, but they would've had a better chance than they

740
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,160
Speaker 8:  ended up having. So, yeah.

741
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,820
Speaker 9:  Cool. Thanks. We've gone over scared, but we're gonna, we're gonna take these

742
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,260
Speaker 9:  last two. Let's start over here.

743
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,220
Speaker 23:  I had a question about what you guys think between apple and Samsung, because

744
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,000
Speaker 23:  apple makes everything like the software, the hardware,

745
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,690
Speaker 23:  and Samsung gets their software from Google for free, but their

746
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:54,660
Speaker 23:  phones are priced the same. How do you guys think that they can

747
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,080
Speaker 23:  justify charging the same when they get a major

748
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,620
Speaker 23:  investment that they don't even really have to pay for?

749
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,370
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

750
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,360
Speaker 9:  Is it, is it free? Like

751
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,290
Speaker 9:  yeah, it's free, but Google demands, like there's a reason every Samsung

752
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,130
Speaker 9:  phone has a two browsers and two email clients. Like at some point the tax

753
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,700
Speaker 9:  they're paying is that they have to ship half of Google's

754
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,660
Speaker 9:  product and a half of Samsung's product. Right. And then

755
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,020
Speaker 9:  we are like, Samsung's product sucks and like,

756
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,660
Speaker 9:  okay. But if they didn't, they weren't paying that tax and they didn't know

757
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,450
Speaker 9:  that they're going to release the phone and then we're going to like Bixby

758
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,540
Speaker 9:  is a dog with shoes and then no one's going to use it. Cause everyone's because

759
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,210
Speaker 9:  we are going to tell everyone the Google's doing a better job. Like I think

760
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,270
Speaker 9:  that tax, it might not be monetary. And I understand what you're saying,

761
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,960
Speaker 9:  that they charge the price of the phones the same. And that is like a whole,

762
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,840
Speaker 9:  like the hardware is still expensive, right? There's a reason Samsung has

763
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,600
Speaker 9:  a head on hardware features all the time. Maybe they're reinvesting that

764
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,900
Speaker 9:  money somewhere else. But I think there's a, there's a very

765
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,290
Speaker 9:  practical effect of the tax, which is that they've had to

766
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:59,190
Speaker 9:  compromise what might have been their user experience to a seed to

767
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,150
Speaker 9:  Google.

768
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,870
Speaker 8:  And I, I guess I would also add don't shed a tear for apple having to invest

769
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,780
Speaker 8:  in software development because they make more profits than anybody like

770
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,330
Speaker 8:  they're doing fine.

771
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,060
Speaker 9:  They're doing fine. Last one, mate, you had a lot of pressure on you.

772
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,900
Speaker 24:  Okay. Hi. I was wondering what you think of the

773
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,620
Speaker 24:  viability of Linux based phones. Yeah,

774
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,960
Speaker 24:  that's my question. Yeah.

775
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,810
Speaker 9:  It's like a perfect ender.

776
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,410
Speaker 8:  Th it has been tried. I think that even

777
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,630
Speaker 8:  Google was fuchsia maybe is thinking Linux isn't the best

778
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,440
Speaker 8:  Colonel. I mean, it's, it's not a question of the viability of

779
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,050
Speaker 8:  Linux as a technology and is it appropriate for a smartphone? Like there's,

780
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,930
Speaker 8:  there's lots of fascinating conversations to have there. And many of you

781
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,770
Speaker 8:  would be able to like beat me at that conversation really quickly.

782
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,220
Speaker 8:  It's a question of, can there be a third smartphone platform right now?

783
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,460
Speaker 8:  And that seems dubious that that's going to take a minute

784
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,630
Speaker 8:  if

785
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:56,410
Speaker 9:  Right. There's two parties involved. There's carriers

786
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:00,220
Speaker 9:  who will not allow anything good to happen. Can you tell, I feel if you're

787
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,320
Speaker 9:  a carrier partner and you're in the audience, please see our ad sales

788
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,310
Speaker 9:  people, they would love to talk to you. And then

789
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,340
Speaker 9:  there's customers like, are you going to buy a Linux phone that doesn't have

790
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,490
Speaker 9:  an Instagram app? Well, actually, maybe now you would some other good app

791
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,330
Speaker 9:  Snapchat. They're great. Thanks Rian station,

792
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,540
Speaker 9:  right? Like that, those developers aren't incentivized to build those

793
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,600
Speaker 9:  applications and bring up a new platform and say, well, not have all the

794
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,020
Speaker 9:  capabilities of the current mature platforms too. So between the

795
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,500
Speaker 9:  carriers and then knowing that you will not be able to

796
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,400
Speaker 9:  deliver any kind of tangible value except for freedom,

797
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,970
Speaker 9:  which is great. I like it. But I also just like, ha I like having a useful

798
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:40,720
Speaker 9:  phone. I think that just makes that investment very difficult to justify

799
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,560
Speaker 8:  We not in the duopoly down one more round of applause to the video team.

800
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:51,550
Speaker 9:  <em></em>

801
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,480
Speaker 9:  that's it. We didn't actually plan an ending. So no,

802
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,260
Speaker 9:  but thank you all for coming. I want to actually just say thank you to

803
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,070
Speaker 9:  Dieter. You might've noticed a weird theme of our

804
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,790
Speaker 9:  10 year birthday is like fragility. And we just did an entire documentary

805
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,660
Speaker 9:  about fragility and the verge was once very fragile. I think I

806
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,650
Speaker 9:  said this to almost everybody. You talk to me over the course past two

807
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,020
Speaker 9:  days, they're like, what did you learn in the past 10 years? And like, I

808
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,920
Speaker 9:  wish I had a time machine, so I could go back 10 years in time and tell myself

809
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,910
Speaker 9:  it was going to be okay. I really do like Dieter and I

810
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:28,870
Speaker 9:  at the very beginning, spent nights in the bar by my house.

811
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:32,680
Speaker 9:  This is Bosky is RP. It's closed, like literally in tears. Cause at the beginning

812
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,580
Speaker 9:  of this was so hard and it wasn't going to work and we were working too hard

813
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,920
Speaker 9:  and now it's here and we have a great video team. We have all these people

814
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,640
Speaker 9:  will work with us and all of you care for us. We do not take it for

815
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,490
Speaker 9:  granted. And Deidre is my brother. And I don't think I would have been able

816
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,390
Speaker 9:  to do with it. I

817
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:52,090
Speaker 9:  can't.

818
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:52,450
Speaker 8:  Thank you so

819
00:49:52,450 --> 00:50:03,040
Speaker 8:  much.

820
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,700
Speaker 3:  Okay. My thanks to Nila for the chat to everybody who came to our ten-year

821

825
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:24,670
Speaker 3:  documentary. We'll be back on Friday with the Vergecast chat show. And then

Speaker 3:  when as promised, we're going to dig into the new smart home standard

828
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:36,380
Speaker 3:  that's called the matter this week's Vergecast is

829
