Speaker 1:  You've probably heard about the job of an intimacy coordinator,

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,110

Speaker 2:  And every intimacy coordinator's kit is gonna be some form of mint. Really?

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,230
Speaker 2:  I think most of the time Wait. Oh a hundred percent, huh? Then we add in

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,210
Speaker 5:  know, kind a gentler kind of crooks so to speak.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,890

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,850

Speaker 4:  I'm Phoebe Judge and this is criminal. Did you have to say what

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,130

00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,090

22
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,150
Speaker 7:  following feed. You're gonna like it. It doesn't matter what you

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,590
Speaker 7:  David Pierce is here alone

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,870
Speaker 11:  In the studio's. Weird.

29
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,510
Speaker 7:  This is a real inversion. If you're watching us on video, David's in New York

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,270
Speaker 7:  and we're both at home. That's not how this usually goes.

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,710
Speaker 11:  No, I came to the office today and you said no, it's just you and

32
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,710
Speaker 11:  the Nugget account in the office. You don't get to be around people you

33
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:04,870
Speaker 11:  like

34
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,630
Speaker 7:  Nugget account's killing it. And then you know, our friend Taylor Loren's

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,830
Speaker 7:  like oh has a deep intuitive understanding how social platforms work and

36
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,230
Speaker 7:  she's like, A new social platform is defined by volume and she's going ham

37
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,390
Speaker 7:  and God bless her. Oh yeah. It's like some people know And I can't do it,

38
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,950
Speaker 7:  but like the Nugget account Pop Crave and Taylor, they're like, we're gonna

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,790
Speaker 7:  dominate threads.

40
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,190
Speaker 11:  Yep. For me it's memes are Oh, memes are, I don't know where memes are came

41
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,670
Speaker 11:  from but like every other post is memes are and it is true. It's a, it's

42
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,710
Speaker 11:  a algorithmic land grab. They're like, oh, you don't know who to follow.

43
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,870
Speaker 11:  Here's some posts.

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,910
Speaker 7:  Yeah, just fire shit into the algorithm and maybe it will

45
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,350
Speaker 7:  reward you. Adam Aer will be like turn up the knob on that person. Pop Crave.

46
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,030
Speaker 7:  For a while there I was getting Bible verses. I think Casey was getting bible

47
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,430
Speaker 7:  verses too. And I was like this algorithm. It's not very good. This,

48
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,710
Speaker 7:  no, thank you.

49
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,390
Speaker 10:  It's just the Wendy's account for me on Sunday only Wendy's.

50
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,750
Speaker 7:  All right, we should start with Reds. There's a bunch of stuff to talk about.

51
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,980
Speaker 7:  Microsoft FTC resolved, FTC lost. Microsoft may be

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Speaker 7:  able to buy Activision. That's a big deal. Big big deal. We should talk about

53
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,740
Speaker 7:  that. There's new Apple beta to talk about. There's a Senate hearing

54
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,700
Speaker 7:  right now about OpenAI and its data practices. the Nothing

55
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,300
Speaker 7:  Phone two came out. There's just like a lot. Bob Eger just like randomly

56
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,460
Speaker 7:  said he was gonna sell ESPN today. Yeah, there's all kinds of stuff going

57
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,220
Speaker 7:  on, but let's start with threads just like a quick vibe. Check on

58
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,180
Speaker 7:  threads. How are you feeling?

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,700
Speaker 11:  I'm torn. So I feel like we've, we've been through this thing. What

60
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,700
Speaker 11:  Eight Threads is now eight days old? Yeah. As we're recording this has

61
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,660
Speaker 11:  over a hundred million users. The growth is insane. Seems to be going

62
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,060
Speaker 11:  very well. Everyone at Meta is very excited and keeps talking about how

63
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,580
Speaker 11:  this has exceeded their wildest imaginations. But I also feel like it's

64
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,860
Speaker 11:  not even a backlash. It's like a pre backlash. Like everyone is talking

65
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,420
Speaker 11:  about how mad they're about to be at Threads for all the things that it

66
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,460
Speaker 11:  isn't and all the features it doesn't have. And the fact that your whole

67
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,020
Speaker 11:  feed is just the Nugget account. There was definitely, it had that energy

68
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,660
Speaker 11:  for like four days of just like pure summer

69
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,580
Speaker 11:  camp Joy. It was just like a bunch of posters found each other again and

70
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,820
Speaker 11:  it was very exciting. And it feels like that is already kind of starting

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,420
Speaker 11:  to turn off and at least my feed has gotten very

72
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,180
Speaker 11:  like engagement porn.

73
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:10,900
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

74
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,500
Speaker 11:  Constantly. It's just like interact with this,

75
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,780
Speaker 11:  look at this meme. Do you like this meme? Here's the Spider-Man meme. Remember

76
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,620
Speaker 11:  you found the Spider-Man meme funny. Here's some more Spider-Man memes,

77
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,660
Speaker 11:  And I. Still think it's more fun than Twitter.

78
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,620
Speaker 11:  Yeah. But it is definitely like, it's settling in into I think

79
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,860
Speaker 11:  a, a slightly less enthusiastic phase at least is my read so

80
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,020
Speaker 11:  far.

81
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,100
Speaker 7:  Yeah. My feed is a combo platter of jaded

82
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,780
Speaker 7:  tech journalists being like all the problems are coming and then yeah, the

83
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,020
Speaker 7:  Nugget account and then Shakira being like, what's your favorite color? you

84
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,420
Speaker 7:  know, and it's like, blue, will you talk to me

85
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,020
Speaker 7:  Shakira, I hear you're single. Like, you know, it's like

86
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,100
Speaker 7:  what are we supposed to do with this And I think that's kind

87
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,380
Speaker 7:  of exactly what they want. Yeah. One thing that's really interesting right

88
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,260
Speaker 7:  now, blue Sky is in the middle of some sort of content moderation scan.

89
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,340
Speaker 7:  Like they always will be, they don't have any that's the's the issue. Yeah.

90
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,980
Speaker 7:  They don't have any trust and safety. Like they're just always gonna have

91
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,220
Speaker 7:  scandals. Like they didn't have any filters. So people put the N word in

92
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,780
Speaker 7:  their usernames, like that's just right baby stuff. Right? Like baby problems

93
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,580
Speaker 7:  for babies. Instagram has it all. So I've seen all these people

94
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,420
Speaker 7:  talk about like, oh, why are the vibes nice? And like they've said on the

95
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,540
Speaker 7:  answer is like, because we're behaving ourselves. And the answer is like,

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,540
Speaker 7:  no. The answer is a gigantic metadata center

97
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,140
Speaker 7:  is keeping you away from it and it works and it's good and the product

98
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,940
Speaker 7:  is content moderation. And so you see stuff that's good and you don't see

99
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,060
Speaker 7:  stuff that's bad. And then occasionally the Nugget account is like, do you

100
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,940
Speaker 7:  remember the eighties? And you're like, yes. And they're like, people, it's

101
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,820
Speaker 7:  crazy, but like they're good at it. They're good at that thing in that way.

102
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,740
Speaker 7:  That's my vibe. Check on it right now is like people are sort of, they're

103
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,220
Speaker 7:  pre mad because they think the problems will happen again in exactly the

104
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,340
Speaker 7:  same way that they've always been happening. But Meta has like lived through

105
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,780
Speaker 7:  most of those problems. So they're gonna have new problems.

106
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,820
Speaker 7:  Don't get me, they're still Meta and we should talk about that a little bit,

107
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,820
Speaker 7:  but it just seems like that first wave of disillusionment of new social

108
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,540
Speaker 7:  platforms is definitely not gonna happen to threats.

109
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,260
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I I have found myself in the unusual position this week of spending

110
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,860
Speaker 11:  a lot of time running around reminding people that actually Meta is better

111
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,260
Speaker 11:  at running social networks than any other company on the planet. Which is

112
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,340
Speaker 11:  like a deranged thing to have to say and feels not true. But

113
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,940
Speaker 11:  it is true. Like Meta is better at this than everybody else. It's so much

114
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,900
Speaker 11:  bigger at it that it gets to deal with all the problems that no one else

115
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,740
Speaker 11:  has. They're

116
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,180
Speaker 10:  Better to an extent. Right. Like I

117
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,780
Speaker 11:  Think, I think the truth is it's impossible to be good at it. Yeah. Right.

118
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,260
Speaker 11:  But no one else is doing this better at any kind of scale

119
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,460
Speaker 11:  than Meta.

120
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,420
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's

121
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:43,540
Speaker 10:  Right.

122
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,980
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Which is a deeply sad state of affairs, but seems true. And so I'm

123
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,060
Speaker 11:  like, it's weird to be that guy. I'm like defending meta's content moderation

124
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,540
Speaker 11:  abilities. But like it's, I think you're right, Nili.

125
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,580
Speaker 10:  I found myself defending Meta a lot this weekend. Like I didn't realize

126
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,140
Speaker 10:  so many people I followed were very like, we hate Facebook so we just hate

127
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,180
Speaker 10:  being here at all. And it's like, well you don't, you don't have to be here.

128
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,180
Speaker 10:  You can go somewhere else. And they're like, no, but I wanna be here because

129
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
Speaker 10:  I need to like be here.

130
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,260
Speaker 11:  Please follow me.

131
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,020
Speaker 10:  So I'm gonna be just very angry here. And. I'm like, that's just like a

132
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,780
Speaker 10:  we. And so it's like I'm having to be like, well you don't have to be here,

133
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,140
Speaker 10:  you can just turn this off. I don't like, you're just railing at the injustice

134
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,140
Speaker 10:  of Meta existing. Yeah. And that's a weird space.

135
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,100
Speaker 10:  But by actual like the interactions I'm having there are good, I've just

136
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,420
Speaker 10:  realized like, oh, if someone's being dumb, I don't have to interact with

137
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,460
Speaker 10:  them. And, I can like mute them or, or block them.

138
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,740
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I think that's the other thing. Like you're a pro, you're like a social

139
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
Speaker 7:  media pro. Yeah.

140
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,580
Speaker 10:  We're a pro Now.

141
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,420
Speaker 7:  No one has to convince you to use the block button button. You're just doing

142
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:41,900
Speaker 7:  it. I

143
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,700
Speaker 10:  I can just not do that. And I can go and like interact with people who just

144
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,220
Speaker 10:  wanna talk about cool stuff and like, that's really, really nice. I'm not

145
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,220
Speaker 10:  having to worry about getting pulled into Culture wars. At one point some

146
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,260
Speaker 10:  guy was like, oh, you're saying this but you're trash or you know, whatever

147
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,180
Speaker 10:  random troll thing. It was And I was just like Mute. Yeah. Done

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,820
Speaker 10:  in scene. And my life went on And I didn't get really upset for an hour.

149
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,340
Speaker 10:  Like have to call somebody and be like, do you believe what this guy said

150
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,180
Speaker 10:  on threads? Which was far too common Occurrence on Twitter.

151
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,780
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I. Just think in general, people are

152
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,140
Speaker 7:  overestimating how much the vibe is good because people are generally

153
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,980
Speaker 7:  cool and underestimating how much it is that Meta is good at

154
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,700
Speaker 7:  content moderation. And to your point, I'm, they're not perfect

155
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,460
Speaker 7:  at it and they're, they're still, it's still Facebook, right? Like

156
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,540
Speaker 7:  they're still biased towards, and Shakira asking you what your

157
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,900
Speaker 7:  favorite color is like that. It's just they want engagement and they're good

158
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,540
Speaker 7:  at getting it. And sometimes that means just the weirdest stuff is happening

159
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,500
Speaker 7:  on this platform. And like drl, like basically, do you know

160
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,220
Speaker 7:  the fourth most popular Facebook page last week was like a picture of a

161
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,540
Speaker 7:  potato.

162
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,780
Speaker 7:  Oh it's, it was in Garbage Day by Brian Brodock, who's, who's great, we'll

163
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,020
Speaker 7:  link it. But it's like it's, he just had a great piece about how like the,

164
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,260
Speaker 7:  just the cultural impact of Facebook itself is almost nil

165
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,060
Speaker 7:  because being so weighted towards engagement

166
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,100
Speaker 7:  means that you have to acknowledge that the fourth most popular page is a

167
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,180
Speaker 7:  picture of a potato, right? It's up against Barbie Heimer. you know, like,

168
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,420
Speaker 7:  it's like, which movie are you gonna see first Barbie, Oppenheimer or look

169
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,980
Speaker 7:  at a picture of a potato? Like they're not on the same cultural scale.

170
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,660
Speaker 7:  And so Facebook has tons of engagement and, but it just doesn't have the

171
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,380
Speaker 7:  impact Threads is an opportunity for impact. And I think they're taking that

172
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Speaker 7:  seriously. The last two things I'll say about this one, a lot of people have

173
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,180
Speaker 7:  asked me in particular if I believe them about Activity Pub

174
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,900
Speaker 7:  because I have said very loudly, the only reason I feel comfortable using

175
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,460
Speaker 7:  this platform is Federation and Decentralization. The evidence that they

176
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,300
Speaker 7:  are serious about it continues to grow, right? I've been sent screenshots

177
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,140
Speaker 7:  of Meta employees very sincerely engaging in like mailing

178
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,220
Speaker 7:  list discussions about the standard. I've seen Meta employees on threads

179
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,140
Speaker 7:  itself, like soliciting feedback for how Activity Pub should work. Like

180
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,660
Speaker 7:  being involved in the technical side of it. I think they have to do it to

181
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,340
Speaker 7:  launch in Europe. I I, I actually don't think they have a choice for any

182
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,420
Speaker 7:  number of like regulatory reasons now. It's like

183
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,900
Speaker 10:  A get outta jail free card. I don't know why they wouldn't do it.

184
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,100
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Like it just in so many regulatory

185
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,020
Speaker 10:  discussions, it cr brings up a whole bunch of new ones, but it ends so

186
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,820
Speaker 10:  many of the big ones.

187
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,300
Speaker 7:  Well it's your choice is, it's like a very contradictory

188
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,940
Speaker 7:  regulatory position that they're in in Europe, which is you have to be interoperable

189
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,500
Speaker 7:  so you can get past the competition concerns, but then you've created a bunch

190
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,740
Speaker 7:  of illegal privacy practices because you're interoperable and that's like,

191
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,020
Speaker 7:  yep.

192
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,580
Speaker 11:  Oh

193
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,060
Speaker 7:  Look, I don't know the answer to that, but if anyone can figure it out, it's

194
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,340
Speaker 7:  Meta, And, I think also on top of all of that,

195
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,780
Speaker 7:  they want to, I think they just want to, I think they think it's a neat technical

196
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,260
Speaker 7:  challenge that their company is able to solve like

197
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,780
Speaker 7:  technical legal compliance, like all that, all that machinery.

198
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,420
Speaker 7:  This is the hardest problem for that machinery to solve. So I think

199
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,060
Speaker 7:  they want to And I think they might have to, but I think they're excited

200
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,260
Speaker 7:  about applying themselves to that problem.

201
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,780
Speaker 11:  I think the Instagram team is excited about it. Like Adam Maser just cannot

202
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,820
Speaker 11:  stop talking about Activity Pub. Like I believe him when he says how excited

203
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,700
Speaker 11:  he is about integrating. But I think one of the things that I have

204
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,260
Speaker 11:  wondered a lot about is because it's gotten so big so quickly and because

205
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,220
Speaker 11:  Meta clearly now sees this as like a real player and a real revenue opportunity

206
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,140
Speaker 11:  for the company, does this start to look less like a place we can

207
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,900
Speaker 11:  experiment with? What sort of might be the future and more like

208
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,860
Speaker 11:  we have to make money to make the metaverse happen and it's suddenly gonna

209
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,500
Speaker 11:  look really profitable short term to keep the doors closed. The part of

210
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,980
Speaker 11:  me that is cynical about this happening says that actually the more

211
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,900
Speaker 11:  successful it gets, the harder it will be both technically and

212
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,780
Speaker 11:  like culturally within Meta to do this. But I do think all

213
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,540
Speaker 11:  the people who are actually building this thing seem to be genuinely serious

214
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,140
Speaker 11:  about it. And I, I believe them. Yeah. At least at this point it's

215
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,700
Speaker 10:  A pretty small team, right? I think that's what Alex Heath said last week

216
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,580
Speaker 10:  on the show. Yeah.

217
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,060
Speaker 11:  I think Moster has said it's like a couple dozen people. Like it's not,

218
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,980
Speaker 11:  it's not huge.

219
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,860
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Like this isn't been a big time sucker financial suck for the company

220
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,900
Speaker 10:  and like the upsides just enormous. so like yeah, right.

221
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,580
Speaker 7:  And I think the money importantly is also not, they don't have to invent

222
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,420
Speaker 7:  a business model. They have to get some data and do some ad targeting

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,340
Speaker 7:  and deliver some impressions that convert into e-commerce and they know how

224
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,980
Speaker 7:  to do that. Like it's, it's just

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,860
Speaker 11:  Meta's good at this.

226
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,140
Speaker 7:  Like the Facebook ad units exist today. If all Meta was saying

227
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,940
Speaker 7:  was run these Facebook ad units and you can now target people on threads,

228
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,300
Speaker 7:  they make the money,

229
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,420
Speaker 7:  will they convert? Like are they good? Who, who knows? But they don't have

230
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,460
Speaker 7:  to like invent it from whole cloth and go out to the market

231
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,180
Speaker 7:  and say like, here's a new thing to buy. They're just like, can you extend

232
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,020
Speaker 7:  the reach of our existing things that are, this thing is Facebook. Yep. It

233
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,220
Speaker 7:  is the Facebook newsfeed. It's kind of funny that we, you know,

234
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,740
Speaker 7:  we're, we're excited about it. It's 2011 again. It's just, here it is again.

235
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,980
Speaker 10:  But key difference. I have not had to watch someone make a horrible, horrible

236
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,100
Speaker 10:  dish in a video yet yet. Like I haven't gotten that that like tastes give

237
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,020
Speaker 10:  it time m but oh it's coming

238
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,060
Speaker 7:  By God. The celebrities are there to cook at you in any minute. It's coming.

239
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,460
Speaker 7:  I will say it is still Meta this story. you know, good

240
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,060
Speaker 7:  vibes on Meta Z Hero, he's got a six pack, whatever,

241
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,060
Speaker 7:  it's still Meta. The the flip side of Meta is still Meta, right? All the

242
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,900
Speaker 7:  problems are still there with the other platforms. They do not have end-to-end

243
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,700
Speaker 7:  encryption enabled in Messenger by default. And so just this

244
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,580
Speaker 7:  week a woman pled guilty for exchanging messages

245
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,060
Speaker 7:  with her daughter that enabled her to get abortion pills in a state in which

246
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,220
Speaker 7:  abortion was legal. The cops were able to go get a warrant to search her

247
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,620
Speaker 7:  text because Meta has not enabled and then encryption by default, they should

248
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,420
Speaker 7:  do that. They should take the political hit and just do that and they haven't

249
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,100
Speaker 7:  done it. And this is, people have been asking 'em to for years, I would make

250
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,820
Speaker 7:  the direct comparison to Apple, right? Which is insistent upon

251
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,540
Speaker 7:  encryption. And yes, there are ways around it, especially if iCloud on all

252
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,140
Speaker 7:  that stuff. But when there was a San Bernardino attack and the FBI said unlock

253
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,180
Speaker 7:  the phone, apple said, we won't, we have these principles. And so I just,

254
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,380
Speaker 7:  it's great that Zuck is jacked and flexing on

255
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,380
Speaker 7:  Elon like all great, right? They still run some large platforms with

256
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,140
Speaker 7:  some real problems and that, that story about the woman going to jail, like

257
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,940
Speaker 7:  that is a horrible story. Yeah. Like I, I'm outraged by that story. Every

258
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,820
Speaker 7:  time I think about it, I mean

259
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,700
Speaker 10:  There's a lot of those horrible stories. We're not gonna get into 'em all

260
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,820
Speaker 10:  today, but like Meta consistently has said profit

261
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,380
Speaker 10:  over people and they're gonna continue to do that just right now

262
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,940
Speaker 10:  it's really fun for the people. So yeah.

263
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,860
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Take some of those good vibes. Make

264
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,260
Speaker 10:  Money off of me. I'm having a great time.

265
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,700
Speaker 7:  This is like an old political quote. Like when you have the chips, you gotta

266
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,660
Speaker 7:  cash 'em. They don't hold so you got the political chips, cash

267
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,500
Speaker 7:  'em on end to encryption. That's all I'm saying. The other thing we should

268
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,380
Speaker 7:  talk about real quick before we go into FTC, it's Apple public beta week.

269
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,980
Speaker 7:  They just hit, we've got a bunch of coverage, although apple's we like all

270
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,620
Speaker 7:  the people have had them forever. Like people have been breaking the nds

271
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,900
Speaker 7:  in these forever. But the Official public betas are, are here.

272
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,140
Speaker 7:  They're fun. They're they're, they're like, it's a fun set of updates.

273
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,500
Speaker 11:  Widgets, man. It's just widgets. Yeah. Life is widgets now.

274
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,220
Speaker 11:  2011 again, David,

275
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,020
Speaker 10:  You're very happy.

276
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,340
Speaker 11:  I love widgets. I will die. And my last breath will be

277
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,340
Speaker 11:  to say smartphones should not just be things you use to open

278
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,900
Speaker 11:  apps. That'll be, write that on my tombstone. What

279
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,500
Speaker 10:  An epitaph.

280
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,180
Speaker 11:  Monica wrote a really good thing about how the Mac is just turning into

281
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,980
Speaker 11:  the iPhone. Yeah. Which I think is exactly right. Like you, you can have

282
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,300
Speaker 11:  desktop widgets on your Mac now Standby is a thing.

283
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,340
Speaker 11:  The smart display stuff is starting to become interesting. I I think it's

284
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,420
Speaker 11:  very cool. I have also installed all of these betas and they have just absolutely

285
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,260
Speaker 11:  decimated the battery life on every single one of my devices.

286
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,340
Speaker 11:  My, my phone now runs really hot for about four hours every single day.

287
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,940
Speaker 11:  It's really great. I really recommend the public pay us. I talked a bunch

288
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,860
Speaker 11:  about this with, with a bunch of our team on the Wednesday show. What are

289
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,780
Speaker 11:  you guys psyched about? Have you tested anything? Is there anything you're

290
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,460
Speaker 11:  seeing that you think is cool?

291
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,820
Speaker 10:  I have been terrified to test it because I need my battery life. I already

292
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
Speaker 10:  have bad battery life. I can't make it worse. So I have, I've put it off

293
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,700
Speaker 10:  so far, but the standby mode like that, I just got one of the mag safe

294
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,460
Speaker 10:  chargers but for my bedside table and I'm like, Ooh.

295
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,060
Speaker 7:  Oh nice.

296
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,820
Speaker 10:  Oh I want this. I also got one for my car and you're a liar. Nili, they

297
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,140
Speaker 10:  suck. Good. Just throwing

298
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,780
Speaker 7:  It out there. Which one did you get? Someone hit me up on threads and said

299
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,740
Speaker 7:  there's a new one. Okay, I gotta find the brand. But they're like, you should

300
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,100
Speaker 7:  buy this one. It's, it's the new, it's the newest hottest one

301
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,060
Speaker 10:  I put, it's like a Balkan one. And I stuck it in my vent and it immediately

302
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,900
Speaker 10:  just tipped down

303
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,820
Speaker 7:  And starts drooping. Yeah. It's too heavy for the vents. All that's better

304
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,740
Speaker 7:  than CarPlay. So you know, whatever. Nope. So I'm an every other year

305
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,540
Speaker 7:  Mac os updater. So I haven't, I I just skipped Ventura like I

306
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,860
Speaker 7:  was like miss me with it. Like come at me the next year when you figured

307
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,060
Speaker 7:  it out, you know? Sure. So I'm just, I'm just excited about like a fresh

308
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,780
Speaker 7:  coat of paint on Mac Os and then I missed out on all the Ventura

309
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,820
Speaker 7:  features. So I'm excited about dumb stuff like continuity camera that I just

310
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,340
Speaker 7:  haven't used for a year. And that's a, it just seems like there's a layer

311
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,700
Speaker 7:  of polish on that stuff. Stage manager on the iPad. David, you wrote about

312
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,900
Speaker 7:  it. It's not great, but it's not just a

313
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,180
Speaker 11:  But it's not awful anymore.

314
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,020
Speaker 10:  David's no longer like furious every time he mentions it. Like

315
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,820
Speaker 10:  previously we would've heard a loud groan as soon as you said stage. And

316
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,380
Speaker 10:  we didn't get that.

317
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,300
Speaker 11:  It's gotten to the point where like, I no longer think you're a bad person

318
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,900
Speaker 11:  if you use stage manager. Wow.

319
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,060
Speaker 7:  It was a, it was a moral flaw.

320
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,740
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Like if you used stage manager, you And, I are just not on the same

321
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,580
Speaker 11:  page how the world works. But now it's like they're doing

322
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,100
Speaker 11:  a thing. I don't think they've done it yet. There's a lot of work left to

323
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,540
Speaker 11:  do. And I, like I feel the same way about standby actually, which is that

324
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,980
Speaker 11:  standby is like an amazing idea that basically has no idea the rest of the

325
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,940
Speaker 11:  iPhone exists. so like you, you put your phone up landscape and

326
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,660
Speaker 11:  then you tap the thing to open the app and it just opens an app sideways.

327
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,580
Speaker 11:  Yep. And it's like, well that's not right. Like this is not how this is

328
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,380
Speaker 11:  supposed to work, but you can see where it's going and stage manager I think

329
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,500
Speaker 11:  now you can see where it's going and that makes me very happy.

330
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,420
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I wonder if I'm ever gonna use standby mode. It's one of those things

331
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,980
Speaker 7:  where like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy a dock and be excited about it and it

332
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,260
Speaker 7:  will never happen. You're

333
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,820
Speaker 10:  Going to use it when you get in your car and CarPlay comes on and you're

334
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,900
Speaker 10:  like, oh actually CarPlay is good and your phone will just go into standby

335
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,220
Speaker 10:  mode.

336
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,260
Speaker 11:  No Neli, do you wanna know my theory? The, the thing of all of this that

337
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,060
Speaker 11:  is going to be the best for you is the redesign on the watch

338
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,660
Speaker 11:  where you just scroll the digital crown, the revolutionary input device

339
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,300
Speaker 11:  on par with the mouse and multi-touch and it's just widgets. Yeah. Just,

340
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,620
Speaker 11:  just a bunch of widgets. Neli is gonna be out here just widget all day.

341
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,140
Speaker 11:  I read

342
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,380
Speaker 7:  V's. Preview of watch I was 10 where she was like, and now you use the Digital

343
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,620
Speaker 7:  Crown more. And. I was like, oh, we're going backwards. Like we just got

344
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,700
Speaker 7:  Kevin Lynch got in that car and he was like junk and put it in reverse and

345
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,540
Speaker 7:  was like speed it off the cliff backwards. People,

346
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:39,860
Speaker 7:  nobody

347
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,780
Speaker 11:  Understands the magic of it. He has to make you use it Now

348
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,940
Speaker 7:  He's Like he will use it. Yeah. I'm using, I I don't want to

349
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,780
Speaker 7:  pre-judge. I I get, I I understand why you would head that

350
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,140
Speaker 7:  way, right? These like app clippy widget things

351
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,740
Speaker 7:  where you get lots of slices of different apps on a, a screen that's getting

352
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,940
Speaker 7:  ever larger. I I get it all sort of emotionally,

353
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,020
Speaker 7:  but I'm just kind of like, I don't know man. I'm not, I'm not out here trying

354
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,220
Speaker 7:  to like fiddle with the watch all day long. Like give me the modular face

355
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,180
Speaker 7:  with as much text on it as I can get. And, I will be happy,

356
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,060
Speaker 7:  but we'll see just

357
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,980
Speaker 10:  A little book on your phone on your watch. Yeah.

358
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,100
Speaker 7:  But the betas are out. Go. If you're, you know, the sort of person who downloads

359
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,740
Speaker 7:  Vedas, go hit 'em. Like use them and then send us a note. I I, I'm very curious

360
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,660
Speaker 7:  to see what you all think of them. And,

361
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Speaker 11:  I will say the one I I would most years, I

362
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,780
Speaker 11:  would say at this point in time, everyone, almost everyone should feel comfortable

363
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,380
Speaker 11:  downloading the public betas this year, especially on iOS.

364
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,660
Speaker 11:  I have had more weirdness than usual. There's this weird keyboard

365
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,580
Speaker 11:  bug in a lot of apps that like, it'll just sort of disappear the

366
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,380
Speaker 11:  text box and so you'll be kind of typing into nothing. It's gone in some

367
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,620
Speaker 11:  apps, but like it's still there for me in messages. So it's still like,

368
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,540
Speaker 11:  if you are not a person who wants to spend your day like closing and reopening

369
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,940
Speaker 11:  apps to make things work, I would probably wait one more Rev on the public

370
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,140
Speaker 11:  beta before you download it.

371
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,580
Speaker 7:  Okay. Two things. I just thought, two things I have, I have a, I have a much

372
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,460
Speaker 7:  better answer to my favorite public beta moment. Okay. So

373
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,300
Speaker 7:  we are like long past the point where Apple can even talk about all the

374
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,540
Speaker 7:  features of iOS. Yeah. Like do you remember when Apple is like, and now you

375
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,300
Speaker 7:  can copy and paste and that took an hour to announce Right?

376
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,740
Speaker 7:  And now it's just like there's too much

377
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,980
Speaker 11:  Long Press was like an entire Apple event.

378
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,980
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They could not, they could not announce all this stuff this year.

379
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,220
Speaker 7:  And one thing they didn't really announce or spend time on is this personal

380
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,140
Speaker 7:  voice assistant thing and accessibility where you can train it on your voice

381
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,180
Speaker 7:  and then it can speak for you. So you do 15 minutes of training and then

382
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,380
Speaker 7:  overnight locally it processes an AI voice for you. Cool as hell.

383
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,340
Speaker 7:  Straight up. Cool as hell.

384
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,180
Speaker 11:  Have you done yours yet?

385
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,220
Speaker 7:  I have no, I don't have the betas yet. I'm not brave enough. Oh yeah, that's

386
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,860
Speaker 7:  right. Look, this is a production environment, David. All right. We don't

387
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,420
Speaker 7:  mess around.

388
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,980
Speaker 11:  So I, I have recorded the requisite 150 sentences.

389
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,820
Speaker 11:  My, my thing is still processing. It takes a long time to do it. It

390
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,660
Speaker 7:  Turns out data centers are faster at this than your folk. Yeah,

391
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,940
Speaker 11:  Yeah. But I will, I will come on the show next week. And. I will, I will

392
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,380
Speaker 11:  play for you some of what we have and then we're working on some other fun

393
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,180
Speaker 11:  stuff for later this month. So

394
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,580
Speaker 7:  Here's my absolute favorite public video moment and shout to our friend Marquez

395
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,260
Speaker 7:  Brownley cuz I understand exactly why this happened. He made it TikTok

396
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,860
Speaker 7:  demoing this feature and it was obviously in drafts and TikTok has a bug

397
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,740
Speaker 7:  where if the video's in drafts and you publish it, it will just play

398
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,580
Speaker 7:  whatever music you picked at full volume and not run your audio. And it was

399
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,420
Speaker 7:  just the Paw Patrol theme song. And it was

400
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,100
Speaker 7:  just the funniest thing I've ever seen. And I was like, I really hope they

401
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,380
Speaker 7:  leave it up. And they took it down and they put it up and it's the real video

402
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,060
Speaker 7:  now it's great. Marquez did a great job, but there was just that brief like

403
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,860
Speaker 7:  50 minutes where it was just, it was a regular Marquez demo

404
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,780
Speaker 7:  video like he's talking, but instead of any audio it was just full

405
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,500
Speaker 7:  volume Paw Patrol. Incredible. I was like, this is what we're, this is what

406
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,540
Speaker 7:  the internet's for. We don't worry. We saved a clip if you need it, you know,

407
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,980
Speaker 7:  send us a Bitcoin. Okay. Don't do that. That's horrible for

408
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,900
Speaker 7:  the environment. Okay. But if you're using it Vercast to The Verge dot com,

409
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,020
Speaker 7:  I'd love to hear, understand, I'm always curious. Okay, we should talk about

410
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,900
Speaker 7:  the big, big news of the week. There's just a lot of

411
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,860
Speaker 7:  interpretation of this, a lot of ways you can think about it. But

412
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,660
Speaker 7:  Tom Addie, Andrew, we covered the hell out of the FTC versus Microsoft

413
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,380
Speaker 7:  trial. Ups downs, twist turns decision came

414
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,100
Speaker 7:  out. FCC lost like in pretty thorough fashion I would say.

415
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,700
Speaker 11:  Yeah, it was, this whole thing went very quickly because

416
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,180
Speaker 11:  Microsoft had this July 18th deadline by which it had to acquire or

417
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,100
Speaker 11:  it had to finalize the deal to acquire Activision Blizzard or not. So this

418
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,420
Speaker 11:  all happened super fast. And the thing I really wanna talk about and the

419
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,100
Speaker 11:  thing I want you specifically to explain to me and Eli because you've been

420
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,660
Speaker 11:  sort of talking about this obliquely all week, And I want you to like put

421
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,580
Speaker 11:  all your thoughts in one place for me is this entire thing turned

422
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,020
Speaker 11:  out to be about Call of Duty. Yeah. In the judge's ruling, like the second

423
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,980
Speaker 11:  or third sentence was about Call of Duty. It says the gist of the FTCs complaint

424
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,260
Speaker 11:  is Call of Duty is so popular and such an important supply for any video

425
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,460
Speaker 11:  game platform that the combined firm is probably going to foreclose it from

426
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,780
Speaker 11:  its rivals for its own economic benefit to com customers detriment. And

427
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,700
Speaker 11:  then it goes on to basically say that's not the case. And so they lose How

428
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,300
Speaker 11:  is that what this trial was about?

429
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,220
Speaker 7:  Like

430
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,340
Speaker 11:  If, if just this became, can everyone have Call of Duty or not?

431
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,180
Speaker 11:  And Don don't feel like that was what the FTC actually meant to argue

432
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,580
Speaker 11:  if it was gonna try to win this case. What is happening here? Yeah, explain

433
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:21,900
Speaker 11:  this to me.

434
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,980
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna respond to this by offering a statement that I can not back

435
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,740
Speaker 7:  up but which I believe is true.

436
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:28,740
Speaker 11:  Okay.

437
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,180
Speaker 7:  Sony doesn't think cloud gaming will happen. Ooh. That's what I believe.

438
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,940
Speaker 7:  Okay. I don't know if that's true. I don't know if inside of Sony there's

439
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,100
Speaker 7:  some, you know, they, we've, we've reported on and Sean Holster has reported

440
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,580
Speaker 7:  on, you know, the hires that Sony has listed to build a new cloud gaming

441
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,980
Speaker 7:  service and they've had their fits and starts and whatever. They've got this

442
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,420
Speaker 7:  weird handheld that only runs over wifi. It doesn't seem like they're working

443
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,180
Speaker 7:  on it very hard. Right. They bought Guy Kai and killed it like right to Sony,

444
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,020
Speaker 7:  I think at a, at a base level is like the future of consoles is giant

445
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,380
Speaker 7:  ass GPUs in your living room and will send code

446
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,140
Speaker 7:  to you and you'll run them locally. Right? Like I think that's Sony's bet.

447
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,900
Speaker 7:  If you're Sony, that's a good bet. It has won you every generation of the

448
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,420
Speaker 7:  console work.

449
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,620
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Every time Microsoft is like, we have a new idea and Sony is like,

450
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,860
Speaker 11:  we have more powerful games and Sony just keeps winning.

451
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,580
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It it's, it's fi it's just the way it goes. you know, Microsoft's point

452
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,700
Speaker 7:  of view, And, I've had Phil Spencer on decoder and he has said this out loud,

453
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,180
Speaker 7:  I think he said at trial, I was like, look, the console market is shrinking.

454
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,180
Speaker 7:  We are losing to mobile. So winning this small ever smaller

455
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,820
Speaker 7:  slice of pie is not the point. And he has said to me and he said to the court,

456
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,140
Speaker 7:  call of Duty is not the point of this acquisition. The point of this

457
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,980
Speaker 7:  acquisition in the present is like Candy Crush the

458
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,900
Speaker 7:  King, which acquisition also owns that makes a ton of money on mobile games.

459
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,180
Speaker 7:  The point of this acquisition is building a library for our cloud gaming

460
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,900
Speaker 7:  future, which, hey, we own Azure, this is a great business for us to be in.

461
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,500
Speaker 7:  We, we, we've got all these ideas about cloud gaming. One day we'll solve

462
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,300
Speaker 7:  the Apple problem and ship a Xbox cloud gaming app on the phone. And so you're

463
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,100
Speaker 7:  like, that's why they're doing it. And so if you're the FTC, I think they

464
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,540
Speaker 7:  kind of got baited by both Microsoft and Sony

465
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,860
Speaker 7:  into endlessly talking about Call of Duty. Because what Sony

466
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,460
Speaker 7:  wants is Call of Duty.

467
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,180
Speaker 11:  So Sony's version of this is we don't care about any of the rest of this.

468
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,220
Speaker 11:  We just want some kind of assurance that we're gonna keep getting Call

469
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,820
Speaker 11:  of Duty. Right.

470
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,620
Speaker 7:  That this is the only game that Activision makes, that Sony gives a shit

471
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:22,900
Speaker 7:  about.

472
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,580
Speaker 11:  Right.

473
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,180
Speaker 7:  Apparently I I they haven't talked about any others. They don't care about

474
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,980
Speaker 7:  Diablo for, they don't care about Diablo, they don't care about Starfield.

475
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,460
Speaker 7:  Like all, you know, all this other stuff Microsoft makes, like they don't,

476
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,140
Speaker 7:  they have a lot of exclusives.

477
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,180
Speaker 11:  Right. And the numbers we've heard are are insane and back that up, right?

478
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,460
Speaker 11:  Like the, the numbers that came up about the, the huge percentage of people

479
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,380
Speaker 11:  who game, who only play Call of Duty and the billions of dollars in revenue

480
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,300
Speaker 11:  that this is means to Sony every single year. Like you can see why.

481
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,660
Speaker 11:  But yeah, again to your point, like this actually should not have been a

482
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,540
Speaker 11:  lawsuit about Call of Duty because no one was actually in disagreement

483
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,220
Speaker 11:  about Call of Duty.

484
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,300
Speaker 7:  If you're saying we're worried about this and your opponent is like, here

485
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,220
Speaker 7:  you go like over and over again, it's like here you go, you want it on the

486
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,900
Speaker 7:  switch. What's some no name, third rate game streaming service,

487
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,620
Speaker 7:  crackle, we'll put Call of Duty on Crackle. Anything you want, call of Duty,

488
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,260
Speaker 7:  wherever you want it. Right. Microsoft's been saying this around the world

489
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,460
Speaker 7:  and you know, the court in its opinion said this is one of the biggest deals

490
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,140
Speaker 7:  in the world. It deserves scrutiny, it got a lot of scrutiny. This is fine.

491
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,260
Speaker 7:  Guess what? All the scrutiny resulted in Call of Duty. Microsoft was showing

492
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,580
Speaker 7:  up at the table with that deal for everyone. Yeah.

493
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,460
Speaker 11:  Can I just read you that chunk of the opinion? Cuz actually it think it's

494
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,620
Speaker 11:  super interesting. It says Microsoft's acquisition of Activision has been

495
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,020
Speaker 11:  described as the largest in tech history. It deserves scrutiny that scrutiny

496
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,660
Speaker 11:  has paid off. Microsoft has committed in writing in public and in court

497
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,380
Speaker 11:  to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox. It

498
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,380
Speaker 11:  made an agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to switch and it entered

499
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,660
Speaker 11:  several agreements to, for the first time bring Activision content to several

500
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,140
Speaker 11:  cloud gaming services. And then it's basically the, the implication there

501
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,980
Speaker 11:  is like, and we're done here. Yeah. Yeah. And And I think you're right.

502
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,900
Speaker 11:  Like that's everyone at Microsoft was up there yelling that they, this was

503
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,420
Speaker 11:  what they wanted to do through the entire process. Yeah.

504
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,940
Speaker 7:  Here's the deal that we would like to give you and the court's like they're

505
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,540
Speaker 7:  gonna give you that deal and that's fine. I just think that there's something

506
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,980
Speaker 7:  in there that's like everyone wants to pile in the FTC for losing this case

507
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,500
Speaker 7:  and you should, I think they did a bad job. I think they got distracted into

508
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,100
Speaker 7:  this Call of Duty side show. Right. And it's because Sony wanted this deal.

509
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,220
Speaker 7:  so like Sony is screaming

510
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,980
Speaker 7:  like give us Call of Duty and the FTC is like, all right, that's our way

511
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,140
Speaker 7:  in. Like this other big company is mad about it and like we'll find some

512
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,740
Speaker 7:  anti-competitive stuff and then you've got Sony's own executives and emails

513
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,780
Speaker 7:  in evidence being like, I'm not so worried about this. Yeah, whatever. But

514
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,540
Speaker 7:  then you look around the world, right? It's still not done in the uk and

515
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,020
Speaker 7:  the UK is like focused on cloud gaming. You look at the EU which focused

516
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,700
Speaker 7:  on cloud gaming and Call of Duty and got Call of Duty and said, all right,

517
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,260
Speaker 7:  we'll see if the Americans can do this. It's not that the FTC shouldn't have

518
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,180
Speaker 7:  done the scrutiny, every other big regulatory body applied the same

519
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,860
Speaker 7:  level of scrutiny and is getting various kinds of deals. I think

520
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,580
Speaker 7:  what people are looking at is the FTC lost this case in court

521
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,220
Speaker 7:  and they've lost some other cases and you're like, maybe this isn't, maybe

522
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,700
Speaker 7:  they're just always gonna lose and they should never try And I just I, that

523
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,140
Speaker 7:  to me is the mistake. And it's a mistake for two reasons. One, the court

524
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,660
Speaker 7:  itself saying, look at what this scrutiny got you. It got you Call of Duty.

525
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,460
Speaker 7:  If Microsoft wasn't anticipating the scrutiny, they wouldn't have started

526
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,740
Speaker 7:  with we'll give you Call of Duty. They would've started with, we're gonna

527
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,540
Speaker 7:  make Call of Duty exclusive like they did with their other dames. So weird.

528
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,340
Speaker 7:  Right? Like that's just a weird thing to be like, if you take away the threat,

529
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,180
Speaker 7:  they'll still behave. I don't believe that. Then there's the second thing,

530
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,780
Speaker 7:  which is like very, very, very wonky, but the Lena

531
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,780
Speaker 7:  Khan project at the FTC and Lena Conn has

532
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,940
Speaker 7:  been on this show before. She was the chairperson at the FTC. You can go

533
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,300
Speaker 7:  listen to her. Her project is that the antitrust laws of this country are

534
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,580
Speaker 7:  bad. Right? Right. That they were reinterpreted in the eighties by Robert

535
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,260
Speaker 7:  Borg and Ronald Reagan, all this stuff. And that we got to a place where

536
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,820
Speaker 7:  we no longer think about competition. We just measured prices. And that has

537
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,780
Speaker 7:  led to all kinds of bad effects. And I think that is true, it's

538
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,780
Speaker 7:  true for a variety of reasons. And her project is to go get the courts or

539
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,860
Speaker 7:  Congress or someone to reset antitrust law. And there's two ways

540
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,860
Speaker 7:  to do it. One, you create a lot of political capital, you make a lot

541
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,660
Speaker 7:  of angry people so that Congress does something. So

542
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,380
Speaker 7:  Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren and Ken Buck, who's a Republican who's

543
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,900
Speaker 7:  on that committee can pass the antitrust bill that they've had in their back

544
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,500
Speaker 7:  pocket forever, right? Saying, look, this wasn't the right outcome under

545
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,780
Speaker 7:  the existing law. Here's a new law. Or you take it up to the appeals court

546
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,380
Speaker 7:  and say, the way we've been applying this law for ages is

547
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,300
Speaker 7:  inappropriate because of these effects in this thing. We want you to

548
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,940
Speaker 7:  write a new precedent. And then you take that to the Supreme Court, which

549
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,180
Speaker 7:  I would just point out this particular Supreme Court is like new precedent,

550
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,980
Speaker 7:  here you go. Like they're just into it. So you, she's just playing

551
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Speaker 7:  a long game. I think she's played the early innings of that long game

552
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,020
Speaker 7:  kind of stupidly. Like candidly, I think she has done a bad job at these

553
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,580
Speaker 7:  things. She certainly has not explained that she's playing a long game.

554
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,500
Speaker 11:  And you would think it would help to have some kind of like small wins along

555
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,220
Speaker 11:  the way to prove that. Like we are stepping in the right direction and instead

556
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,460
Speaker 11:  it's just like, I'm gonna lose aggressively and then I'm gonna win. And

557
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,740
Speaker 11:  that, that gets harder. I think

558
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,860
Speaker 10:  Could she have ever won this case? Because like even the, the, the

559
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,660
Speaker 10:  deal for the, so the Sony deal, that's only 10 years. Call of

560
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,220
Speaker 10:  Duty's been around for what, more than 20. It's been a huge, huge thing

561
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,180
Speaker 10:  for more than 20 years. So nothing's to stop Microsoft 10 years from

562
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,540
Speaker 10:  now from just saying, okay, that's it. Exclusive. Yeah.

563
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,500
Speaker 7:  But we'll all be dead then there'll be like a new generation of dancing teams

564
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,620
Speaker 7:  on a different platform and like whatever that

565
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,340
Speaker 10:  That even that felt kind of anti-competitive to me and, and the court court

566
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,220
Speaker 10:  saying, no, this is fine. Like was there any hope of winning

567
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,260
Speaker 10:  this case if she'd gone after the other stuff, if she hadn't gone after

568
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,700
Speaker 10:  Call of Duty?

569
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,740
Speaker 7:  I don't know. I I I think we just won't know. I think the Call of Duty

570
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,580
Speaker 7:  stuff was just such a distraction and somehow we ended just talking about

571
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,420
Speaker 7:  it. And I just will point you to Phil Spencer on decoder. It's like

572
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,340
Speaker 7:  this deal is not about Call of Duty. Who wants it? Well

573
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,820
Speaker 7:  we're gonna run Call of Duty and an iframe on The Verge dot com like 10 years.

574
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Speaker 7:  He'll, he'll write that deal with us tomorrow. He fine. As long as you're

575
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,460
Speaker 7:  paying 70 bucks a pop for Call of Duty, it's a great business. They're not

576
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,340
Speaker 7:  gonna change it. This thing is about, okay, how do we create a new paradigm

577
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,180
Speaker 7:  for games that ends the console era and

578
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,180
Speaker 7:  creates new market share? And that's why we end up talking about like the

579
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,140
Speaker 7:  Switch and all this other stuff, right? Like okay may and maybe they should

580
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,660
Speaker 7:  have a big library of exclusives to do it, but you just see how

581
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,940
Speaker 7:  with every other kind of streaming media, that cycle

582
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,540
Speaker 7:  is bad for consumers. It leads to less choices, it leads to

583
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,340
Speaker 7:  less content and it leads to higher prices. Like just

584
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,860
Speaker 7:  look at the streaming television industry. Not everything is on every service.

585
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,780
Speaker 7:  All the prices are completely insane and the apps are not good. And you're

586
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,740
Speaker 7:  like, do we, is that how you want this to go? Like shouldn't we make sure

587
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,420
Speaker 7:  there's like a lot of competition here or a lot of like developers across

588
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,340
Speaker 7:  these services so they have to compete for our dollars with quality as

589
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,820
Speaker 7:  opposed to competing for dollars with content that comes and goes. Like,

590
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,700
Speaker 7:  that's the thing I'm worried.

591
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,180
Speaker 10:  My question is why didn't the judge see that? Cuz they, they made that case

592
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,620
Speaker 10:  like during the thing they maybe didn't hammer on it the same as Call of

593
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:04,780
Speaker 10:  Duty.

594
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,540
Speaker 7:  David's got the opinion. If you look at the opinion where the judge deals

595
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,260
Speaker 7:  with cloud gaming, she's kinda like, I don't know, this seems weird, we're

596
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,460
Speaker 7:  not gonna

597
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,140
Speaker 10:  Do it. Yeah. Like that's, that's my thing is like how could she have won

598
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,620
Speaker 10:  if the, the judge doesn't even like understand cloud gaming, right? Like

599
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,540
Speaker 10:  if the judge is kind of being a dumb ass.

600
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,900
Speaker 7:  Wait, I, I realize I've been very strident, but I think if we get to a place

601
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,420
Speaker 7:  where like how can the American legal system not understand cloud gaming?

602
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,860
Speaker 7:  We might have already lost.

603
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,340
Speaker 10:  Right? That's true. That's if that's her, if her strategy

604
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,420
Speaker 10:  is to overturn antitrust law at a higher court, they still have to get,

605
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,220
Speaker 10:  or they're gonna have to understand cl cloud gaming, right? Like they're

606
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,340
Speaker 10:  gonna have to understand this stuff. Yeah. If we can't get this judge to

607
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,980
Speaker 10:  understand it, how are we gonna get the next judge to understand it?

608
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,860
Speaker 11:  But this is where we come back to it. I, I feel like so many of these

609
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,300
Speaker 11:  fights and trials end up coming down to market size

610
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,220
Speaker 11:  definitions and this was the case again, right? They had this giant fight

611
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,540
Speaker 11:  over, is Nintendo a genuine competitor

612
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,020
Speaker 11:  to Sony and Microsoft? And is the cloud

613
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,420
Speaker 11:  an actual threat to the console world? And, I think

614
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,260
Speaker 11:  in that case, if Sony is in the ear of the FTC being

615
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,180
Speaker 11:  the one sort of explaining the other side of this fight and Sony is out

616
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,300
Speaker 11:  here saying, yeah, we're not that worried about cloud gaming, that's fine.

617
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,420
Speaker 11:  Then I can see how you would sort of write it off as like a lark that Microsoft

618
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,420
Speaker 11:  is on and Microsoft has been on many larks that have not worked

619
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,980
Speaker 11:  out. And so I think Microsoft is also sitting there saying

620
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,220
Speaker 11:  Cloud gaming is like cool and fine, but we don't really care about it. Like

621
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,940
Speaker 11:  they spent so much time they tell investors it's the future. They tell the

622
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,740
Speaker 11:  world it's the future. They talk a ton about it and then they sit on the

623
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,340
Speaker 11:  stand and say, oh, we've pretty much paused all of our cloud gaming stuff.

624
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,940
Speaker 11:  We don't care all but care about it all that much.

625
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,340
Speaker 10:  Is that like where the screw up happened for Kahan? Like is that where she,

626
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,660
Speaker 10:  her her team screwed up is they didn't try to explain the actual technology

627
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:49,860
Speaker 10:  stuff?

628
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,780
Speaker 7:  No, I think the screw up happened that Sony basically

629
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,620
Speaker 7:  was like, we are the competitor and we will be harmed and the judge will

630
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,540
Speaker 7:  understand us, Sony saying this is anti-competitive and then

631
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,900
Speaker 7:  they fell down the rabbit hole of Call of Duty.

632
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:04,420
Speaker 10:  Okay.

633
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,460
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I think that's

634
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,340
Speaker 7:  Right. The one I'll compare to, and this is really interesting, antitrust

635
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,260
Speaker 7:  is broken. So this is, so why just go with me on this. This is what's a

636
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,980
Speaker 7:  vertical merger, right? Where you buy the next company up and down the stack

637
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,100
Speaker 7:  from you. So Microsoft needs games, it buys games. They're not direct competitor,

638
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,500
Speaker 7:  it's a vertical merger. Microsoft bought Sony, that'd be a horizontal merger,

639
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,380
Speaker 7:  right? They're direct competitors, vertical mergers, like never get challenged

640
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:28,980
Speaker 7:  there, there hasn't been one in like 40 years. The last one, the

641
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,900
Speaker 7:  challenge was at and t Time Warner by the Trump administration.

642
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,980
Speaker 11:  The answer to every antitrust trivia question in like the best way. It's

643
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,820
Speaker 7:  It's a very good, so this, this opinion like has to cite the

644
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,500
Speaker 7:  most recent precedent and yeah, it just has to continuously cite

645
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,460
Speaker 7:  at and t and Time Warner as good precedent for allowing vertical

646
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,140
Speaker 7:  mergers. And it's just like, my dude did that work?

647
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,460
Speaker 7:  Was that a good idea? Is anyone happy about that? Except for

648
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,180
Speaker 7:  David Zoff. Zack Snyder.

649
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,060
Speaker 7:  Like Zack Snyder got to put out like a weird gray square version

650
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:03,860
Speaker 7:  of

651
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,940
Speaker 11:  The eight people who watched that are probably happy.

652
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,180
Speaker 7:  I watched all three hours. I thought about watching it again the other day.

653
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,700
Speaker 7:  And I sat down. And I was like, I can't do this.

654
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,260
Speaker 7:  Like I can't be watching a square movie right now. Like if there's, you know,

655
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,100
Speaker 7:  those AI things where it's like we made the thing wide, it's like just do

656
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,900
Speaker 7:  that for, for Justice Lee. Just please just AI the

657
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,300
Speaker 7:  shit outta it.

658
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,420
Speaker 11:  Just expand the phrase

659
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,940
Speaker 7:  Please. You let me use my whole tv. That's it. It's, it's like super didn't

660
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,140
Speaker 7:  work. It was a disaster idea that caused

661
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,900
Speaker 7:  thousands of people to lose their jobs, right? Because the theory of

662
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,580
Speaker 7:  the merger was bad and yeah, you could say maybe the market will sort out

663
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,260
Speaker 7:  over time, but like the government could have stopped it by saying this will

664
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,020
Speaker 7:  reduce competition. Which it definitely did. We

665
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,740
Speaker 7:  definitely ended up with more consolidation on the other end of that

666
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,660
Speaker 7:  in streaming. And we ended up with a less competitive wireless marketplace

667
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,220
Speaker 7:  over time. Like it's just all that happened, like at and t did not

668
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,060
Speaker 7:  spend money on its network cuz they were busy spending money on

669
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,940
Speaker 7:  fucking Gray Justice League. Why? But that's the only other

670
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,140
Speaker 7:  vertical merger case that we have. And in that case, the, the court in at

671
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,060
Speaker 7:  TT Warner is constantly talking about how there's no precedent. Like this

672
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,580
Speaker 7:  is the first one in 40 years. That's weird. We should have more of these.

673
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,620
Speaker 11:  Oh wow.

674
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,500
Speaker 7:  So like, I I would just take a beat. Like this is a big project

675
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,020
Speaker 7:  to reset how we think about competition in this country. It will, the

676
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,420
Speaker 7:  beginning of it will be more losing than winning. I I I just inevitable

677
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,100
Speaker 7:  and maybe we need a new law. But like you get to the new law by a

678
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,980
Speaker 7:  bunch of senators and congress people saying, well the FTC

679
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,460
Speaker 7:  does not have the tools it needs to create competition. We have to give them

680
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,060
Speaker 7:  some new tools.

681
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,220
Speaker 10:  I guess my my concern is we, we did have some, some protections for

682
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,940
Speaker 10:  vertical integration. There was like the Paramount consent decree, which

683
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,660
Speaker 10:  was from the thirties, which told like film studios that they

684
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,980
Speaker 10:  couldn't own the theaters. Yeah. Now they own the theaters again, they're

685
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,700
Speaker 10:  just streaming. And that also in the Trump era got overturned cuz they were

686
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,180
Speaker 10:  like, no, we don't need this anymore. So it's like the court seemed to be

687
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,620
Speaker 10:  like, yeah, vertical integration, coolest thing in the world. So how, how

688
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,700
Speaker 10:  is, how do they go through the courts to stop something like Microsoft acquiring

689
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,300
Speaker 10:  Activision or at and t acquiring Warner Brothers?

690
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,420
Speaker 7:  I I just wanna be clear at this point, a workable antitrust law in this

691
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,340
Speaker 7:  country would to just be, to make it illegal for at and t to buy

692
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,660
Speaker 7:  anything or for anyone to buy Time Warner

693
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,380
Speaker 7:  Like you. If that was just the rule, I it might be fine.

694
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,780
Speaker 7:  Like more people would keep their jobs. Yeah.

695
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,460
Speaker 7:  That's like a and that's a way to measure like what's a good policy is like

696
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,460
Speaker 7:  when you have mergers, people get laid off, it ruins

697
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,860
Speaker 7:  lives. Maybe some shareholders will make more money, but along the way, a

698
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,660
Speaker 7:  bunch of like secretaries, like that redundant function, like your

699
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,260
Speaker 7:  back office merged and you like lay off your accounting department, right?

700
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,900
Speaker 7:  Like the, the, those are destructive actions for like thousands of people.

701
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,020
Speaker 7:  If you just banned at and t from buying stuff, like more people would've

702
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,300
Speaker 7:  kept their jobs like straight. Like that's just a way to measure it. If you

703
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,580
Speaker 7:  could ban any, anyone from buying Time Warner, like AOL might still exist.

704
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,660
Speaker 7:  Like it's just like one of those things.

705
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,700
Speaker 11:  Do you buy the logic that the, the FTC and even the judge in this case have,

706
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,460
Speaker 11:  have said, which is basically just that the existence of

707
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,020
Speaker 11:  cases like this and the fact that there is someone paying attention and

708
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,140
Speaker 11:  willing to pick this fight is gonna do a lot of the work all by itself.

709
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,260
Speaker 11:  Yeah, because before I think we, we spent a generation with companies just

710
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,460
Speaker 11:  being like, no, what everyone at the FTC is asleep at the wheel. This is

711
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,860
Speaker 11:  a non-issue. We'll get anything through. We want to, and now

712
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,700
Speaker 11:  the case for Lina Con would be at least someone is willing to pick the fight

713
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,660
Speaker 11:  and that's, that's gonna make fewer people want to be on the other side

714
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:37,820
Speaker 11:  of it.

715
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,060
Speaker 7:  Wait, I have two questions. I have two questions for you. Name one other

716
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,180
Speaker 7:  commissioner of the FTC.

717
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,020
Speaker 11:  No. Okay. I don't, I don't want, I know them all. I don't want

718
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,180
Speaker 11:  to,

719
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,980
Speaker 7:  I don't wanna pick favorites name the previous

720
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,980
Speaker 7:  chair of the FTC, right? It's tough. Todd

721
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,340
Speaker 10:  Siegel,

722
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,500
Speaker 11:  Ronald Ray,

723
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:58,860
Speaker 7:  Herbert.

724
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,900
Speaker 7:  I dunno, it doesn't, like she has a reputation and her reputation

725
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,540
Speaker 7:  is that she thinks big mergers and consolidation are bad.

726
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,540
Speaker 7:  Maybe she'll win, maybe she'll lose. But that is like a drastic change.

727
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,980
Speaker 7:  And I do I, I wanna be clear two things. One, I think that she did a bad

728
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,580
Speaker 7:  job arguing in this case the trial. I think that Call of Duty head fake,

729
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,740
Speaker 7:  she just got lost in it. Two, the more I think about it, it's

730
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,420
Speaker 7:  more like, I don't care if Microsoft owns Activision.

731
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:28,900
Speaker 7:  Like

732
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,580
Speaker 10:  Oh, I do.

733
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,380
Speaker 7:  Why?

734
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,540
Speaker 10:  Because vertical as we saw with streaming vertical integration is bad.

735
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,460
Speaker 7:  But like the, the actual bad outcome of that, when Sony is dominant

736
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,220
Speaker 7:  and Apple is not gonna let anyone do cloud gaming anyways. Like,

737
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,740
Speaker 10:  Because Sony is dominant today and they have Call of Duty today.

738
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,420
Speaker 10:  Is there anything in that decision to stop Microsoft from

739
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,540
Speaker 10:  saying, okay, Diablo four no longer works on PS five?

740
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,540
Speaker 7:  Well, so now there's there's a lot of Phil Spencer running around saying

741
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:00,180
Speaker 7:  that would be bad. There's all of this. And then on top of it,

742
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,980
Speaker 7:  Microsoft is in third place. so like if the market's more competitive, is

743
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,700
Speaker 7:  that bad? Like it I

744
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,580
Speaker 10:  Mean that theoretically that's it. If at any point micro like this is all

745
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,740
Speaker 10:  dependent on Microsoft being like, yeah, we're just good guys, we're fine

746
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,580
Speaker 10:  with third place because we're keeping an open like we're altruism.

747
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,220
Speaker 7:  No, I don't think they're fine with third place. I'm saying if they're not,

748
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,820
Speaker 7:  if they flip out and they make Call of Duty exclusive and then

749
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,140
Speaker 7:  sales between the Xbox and PS five even

750
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,060
Speaker 7:  out and the market is more competitive. Is that a bad th like, I

751
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,420
Speaker 7:  don't know the answer to that question.

752
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,740
Speaker 10:  Is the market more competitive if one of the largest gaming

753
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,780
Speaker 10:  console makers in the world owns the majority of the studios? Cuz Activision

754
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,740
Speaker 10:  Blizzard is just one of many studios they've acquired. They've been

755
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,100
Speaker 10:  on a buying spree. Yeah. They own most of the big studios, like with the

756
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,500
Speaker 10:  exception of think of like ea they own just about everything Buddy. After

757
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,980
Speaker 10:  they acquire Activist and Blizzard.

758
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,180
Speaker 7:  But even in that case, Sony's still winning for

759
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,420
Speaker 10:  Now.

760
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,940
Speaker 7:  Well, well, but I'm sure but like, okay, so let's say it evens out and Microsoft

761
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,580
Speaker 7:  goes from third to first. That means the market's more competitive.

762
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,180
Speaker 7:  Like,

763
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,980
Speaker 10:  And then they go from third to first and then they say, okay, it's been

764
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,820
Speaker 10:  10 years. Call of Duty is now exclusive. Diablo five or six or

765
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,940
Speaker 10:  whatever is now exclusive. If you wanna play any of these games, you have

766
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,580
Speaker 10:  to play them on an Xbox. And so now Sony has nothing,

767
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,820
Speaker 10:  no leg to stand on cuz it's been 10 years, they bited their time and

768
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,300
Speaker 10:  they're having a great time. Like we saw this happen over and over with

769
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,740
Speaker 10:  streaming. Streaming was like, yeah, we're gonna acquire this stuff, we're

770
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,340
Speaker 10:  gonna do this vertical integration and then we're gonna pull the rug out

771
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,100
Speaker 10:  from under people. And because it's, it's financially

772
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,940
Speaker 10:  expedient for us. And I'm just like, I don't trust

773
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,460
Speaker 10:  companies to do what's best for the people. They do what's best for their

774
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,300
Speaker 10:  bottom line and their bottom line does not always mean what's

775
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,460
Speaker 10:  best for people. Right? Yeah.

776
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,860
Speaker 7:  I I don't think we're, I don't think we're agreeing. I'm just saying that

777
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,860
Speaker 7:  instinct to do what's best for your bottom line is usually tempered by competition

778
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,580
Speaker 7:  in the market. You only have two choices. Like either I can set prices

779
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,380
Speaker 7:  for every product in America, vote Patel, that'd be a great benevolent king.

780
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,620
Speaker 7:  Or you can have like actual market competition that people can vote with

781
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,140
Speaker 7:  their dollars. And right now you kind of don't. Right. And I think that's

782
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,100
Speaker 7:  the thing that I'm getting at is Microsoft is so far behind that if you want

783
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,940
Speaker 7:  a new console, you kind of end up buying a PS five, right? Like, because

784
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,100
Speaker 10:  They have exclusives, that's why it's doing better is because it's got all

785
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,020
Speaker 10:  the, it's got Naughty dog and now Microsoft owns everybody. That's not Naughty

786
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,620
Speaker 10:  dog, but

787
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,580
Speaker 7:  That's market competition. Like if Sony wait sits on its ass for

788
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,420
Speaker 7:  10 years Yeah. And then Call of Duty goes away and they're like, whoops,

789
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,900
Speaker 7:  Microsoft. Like that is their fault. Like it's so Sony's like

790
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,820
Speaker 7:  a also a multi-billion dollar self-interest company. And that's all I'm getting

791
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,540
Speaker 7:  at is like it, the the harms here are hard to see and they're definitely

792
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,700
Speaker 7:  more pronounced in cloud gaming and the FTC kind of blew it. But the bigger

793
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,460
Speaker 7:  projects, the FTC is to say like any antitrust enforcement is

794
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,220
Speaker 7:  good and the law should change. And I, I think everyone is kind of missing

795
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:57,180
Speaker 7:  that second turn that they were always walking into a

796
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,820
Speaker 7:  loss because the law does not support their Lena Khan's

797
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,620
Speaker 7:  theories for how this should work. And again, you can go listen to her

798
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,700
Speaker 7:  on this show before she worked at the FTC talking about her theories.

799
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,060
Speaker 7:  And it's basically like this kind of consolidation creates

800
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,260
Speaker 7:  a ton of bad outcomes for consumers that aren't just measured in raw prices.

801
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,220
Speaker 11:  So in that case it's, and and we really should take a break here, but in

802
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,500
Speaker 11:  that case, it sounds like what you're saying is it's not so much the loss

803
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,340
Speaker 11:  that's the problem, it's the fact that the FTC allowed itself to fall down

804
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,140
Speaker 11:  this distraction of Call of Duty being the problem that is

805
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,580
Speaker 11:  actually the thing that's gonna pull it away from getting to where it was

806
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:33,980
Speaker 11:  trying to go.

807
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:34,860
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think that's right.

808
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,860
Speaker 11:  But at least we get Call of Duty. Call of Duty on the switch. Yeah, it's

809
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,860
Speaker 11:  animated. It's like Call of Duty, but you're Yoshi. It sounds awesome. I

810
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,540
Speaker 7:  Think a real problem for me is that I do not play Call of Duty. so like whatever,

811
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,460
Speaker 7:  you can have it Phil. If you're listening, I wanna run it on the homepage.

812
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,500
Speaker 7:  Okay, we'll, we'll, we'll sign the deal. 10 years of Call of Duty at The

813
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,980
Speaker 7:  Verge dot com. Love it. All right. We should take a break. We'll be right

814
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,140
Speaker 7:  back.

815
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,950
Speaker 13:  Hello, I'm Mr. Perel. I'm a psychotherapist and host of

816
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,870
Speaker 13:  the podcast. Where should we begin? Relationships, expectations

817
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,150
Speaker 13:  are at an all time high and yet the norms are

818
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,950
Speaker 13:  less and less clear. And we are literally making up the new norms

819
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,630
Speaker 13:  as we go. Whether it's your work, relationships,

820
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,990
Speaker 13:  friendships, or romantic relationships. I invite you

821
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,830
Speaker 13:  to enter into my office and listen in on my

822
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,500
Speaker 13:  sessions where I help people explore the challenges

823
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,500
Speaker 13:  and choices in their relationships. You will

824
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,260
Speaker 13:  listen intensely to them, but you will actually

825
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,380
Speaker 13:  see yourselves and in the process you become unstuck

826
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,180
Speaker 13:  and empowered in your own relationships.

827
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,460
Speaker 13:  Join me in my office every Monday morning for a new

828
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:55,460

832
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,580
Speaker 14:  C Nnn Trump and News writ large. My favorite part

833
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,620
Speaker 14:  might have been this description by Jake of how leaders at the highest level

834
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,660
Speaker 14:  get in their own way.

835
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,060
Speaker 15:  How great man rise to the level where they removed from their circle. Anyone

836
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,620
Speaker 15:  who will tell them when they're making mistakes, I call it the Jar Jar Banks's

837
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,860
Speaker 15:  theory. Someday I'll write a business book about it. Explain me Jar Jar

838
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,340
Speaker 15:  B'S theory is George Lucas rises to a level where some nobody's around him

839
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,620
Speaker 15:  to say, please do not include that Jamaican frog in the prequels. That's

840
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,580
Speaker 15:  an awful idea. What are you doing? And you see it all over,

841
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,260
Speaker 15:  all over with leader, after leader, after leader who does not have

842
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,300
Speaker 15:  anyone around them to say no. And that is, I never want to be that

843
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,460
Speaker 15:  person because that is always how it ends.

844
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,620
Speaker 14:  No one wants to be that person. Jake Tapper for the full episode. Search

Speaker 7:  We're back. David is just waving his computer around in the studio.

847
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,900
Speaker 7:  What is happening there? Man,

848
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,020
Speaker 11:  The thing that happened about 20 minutes ago on this podcast is I spilled

849
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,860
Speaker 11:  one whole pomp La Moose LaCroix just all the way over my computer.

850
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,300
Speaker 7:  Turn it upside down.

851
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,060
Speaker 11:  I did for a while. It was the, the key is to just

852
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,180
Speaker 11:  make a tent and put it on the floor. Yeah. And then that makes everything

853
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:25,420
Speaker 11:  better.

854
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,300
Speaker 11:  It it, luckily Liam, our producer, brought me what I would say as several

855
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,820
Speaker 11:  rolls of paper towels that I have now used.

856
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,300
Speaker 7:  Put it in some rice. Liam, get a bag of rice.

857
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,020
Speaker 11:  A really big bag of rice. The most astounding part is, it seems fine.

858
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,260
Speaker 11:  I think the software updated at one point,

859
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:42,820
Speaker 7:  But,

860
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,500
Speaker 11:  But now I'm just, I'm, I'm back. If it suddenly like lights on fire while

861
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,980
Speaker 11:  we're sitting here, that's why And I will probably have to leave briefly,

862
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,540
Speaker 11:  but I'm, I'm somehow

863
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,460
Speaker 7:  It's gonna make for great tv.

864
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,980
Speaker 11:  Listen, did I almost burn down the building when I tried to poke a

865
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,460
Speaker 11:  battery for a video at the Wall Street Journal? Yes, I did. And this can

866
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,580
Speaker 11:  be, this can be round two.

867
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,660
Speaker 7:  Gonna make a gif a bit pran. I have a stat for you. Okay. Hit me with it.

868
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,140
Speaker 7:  The average blockbuster store had between eight

869
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,460
Speaker 7:  and 10,000 videos in it. Some of 'em had 7,000 videos,

870
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,540
Speaker 7:  Netflix, 3,600 movies. so like

871
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,500
Speaker 7:  in moving to the streaming area, the amount of choice on the, on the

872
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,740
Speaker 7:  platforms has dwindled shrink. Yep.

873
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,900
Speaker 11:  Which is the opposite of what people think. I bet if you gave those two

874
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,740
Speaker 11:  numbers to a person and was like, which is which I bet almost everyone would

875
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,140
Speaker 11:  say Netflix is the bigger number. Yep.

876
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,740
Speaker 10:  But then you asked them to go find a movie they remember from their childhood

877
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,860
Speaker 10:  on Netflix. Exactly. And they'll be like, like, oh, yep, this is garbage.

878
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,300
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I'm just saying pump up the volume not available on any streaming service.

879
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,980
Speaker 7:  Let's make it happen. It was definitely in Blockbuster.

880
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,340
Speaker 11:  You had that ready to, you did not just look that up. Ready? I want everyone

881
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,180
Speaker 11:  to know Neli did not just Google to confirm that that is a fact he

882
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,740
Speaker 11:  knew before this podcast began.

883
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,540
Speaker 10:  I think he just knows it at all times. Like if it, if, if it does appear

884
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,140
Speaker 7:  All right, that's why sad for you. But to, to, to Alex's point, like you

885
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,620
Speaker 7:  move to the streaming world and your choice gets lessened. Like

886
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,100
Speaker 7:  that's, that's a real stat about Blockbuster George I think is fascinating.

887
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,740
Speaker 7:  All right, let's talk about a gadget. There's a bunch of gadgets. Talk about,

888
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,220
Speaker 7:  there's, there's a new foldable from honor. There's some iMac rumors. We,

889
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,580
Speaker 7:  I think we should start with a Nothing Phone two. Is it in parentheses? In

890
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,220
Speaker 7:  my head. It's in parentheses because whenever I get a new iPhone, it's always

891
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,940
Speaker 7:  like iPhone four. And that's how it shows up on all the Bluetooth, you know,

892
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,180
Speaker 7:  and this Is, the Nothing Phone two and

893
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,060
Speaker 11:  It, it is in parentheses. Our, our style guide says that it is not

894
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,460
Speaker 11:  in parentheses. And I love our style guide for that. But if you ask nothing,

895
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,820
Speaker 11:  it is in parentheses the thing

896
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,300
Speaker 7:  Is like a vibes phone. It's like the first True Vibes phone.

897
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:42,900
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

898
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,020
Speaker 11:  I think that's exactly right. It's like, I don't know the, the Nothing Phone

899
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,980
Speaker 11:  one was like cool because it was new, right? And I, like, I root

900
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,980
Speaker 11:  for every company that wants to make phones because we need more good phones

901
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,900
Speaker 11:  in the world that are not made by Apple or Samsung. And like we've been

902
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,780
Speaker 11:  talking about, competition is a good thing. And if someone could figure

903
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,020
Speaker 11:  out how to sell phones that isn't Samsung or Apple, that would be terrific.

904
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,780
Speaker 11:  But it it, it was like, it was a new phone, right? Like it had some weird

905
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,780
Speaker 11:  performance stuff. The camera wasn't amazing. The battery life was kind

906
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,620
Speaker 11:  of, eh, like it felt like a first phone. And this one, Alison Johnson

907
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,980
Speaker 11:  reviewed it for us and basically came out of it saying like, look, it's

908
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,660
Speaker 11:  a very good phone. It has a bunch of big ideas that either

909
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,940
Speaker 11:  work for your brain or they don't. It's big on like, we want to give you

910
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,540
Speaker 11:  tools to help you use your phone a little bit less. And one of those tools

911
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,020
Speaker 11:  is making all the icons look the same. Which is weird. It's like, what if

912
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,260
Speaker 11:  it was harder to find the Instagram app? Like I'm not No, that's a good,

913
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,580
Speaker 11:  good thing. So that's the thing, right? Like how you respond to that

914
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,900
Speaker 11:  idea. It's

915
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,700
Speaker 10:  Good. It's aesthetically pleasing.

916
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,300
Speaker 11:  Oh, it's beautiful. The home screen of the Nothing Phone is one of the best

917
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,300
Speaker 11:  looking home screens I've ever seen. It's gorgeous. It has the, the glyph

918
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,620
Speaker 11:  thing on the back. So if you put it down on the table, face down, it has

919
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,300
Speaker 11:  these lights that show up that will do some new stuff. It has the little

920
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,020
Speaker 11:  charging indicator, so like the light at the bottom will fill up as it charges.

921
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,540
Speaker 11:  It has a new countdown thing that if you have a timer on, it'll actually

922
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,380
Speaker 11:  sort of decrease the light as the timer countdown. There are these nifty

923
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,500
Speaker 11:  things like do any of these add up to like a transformational idea about

924
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,460
Speaker 11:  smartphones? Like, no, but there's some cool ideas here. And I think that's

925
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,060
Speaker 11:  what you mean Nila by calling this a vibes phone, right? Yeah. Like it's,

926
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,100
Speaker 11:  if if the things about it make you feel something awesome, you're gonna

927
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,020
Speaker 11:  love this phone and be super happy because it does all the phone things

928
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,900
Speaker 11:  pretty well, unlike the phone one. But it's still like, is this

929
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,380
Speaker 11:  the future of smartphones? Like there's really nothing here that screams

930
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:28,860
Speaker 11:  Yes,

931
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,780
Speaker 7:  We've just come to a place with smartphones where that question is kind of

932
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,700
Speaker 7:  like saying like, is this the future of shoes? It's like, it's just like

933
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,900
Speaker 7:  doesn't, what are you talking about? Like, and it, because

934
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,140
Speaker 7:  of the platform split, you're kind of always like, will the Nothing

935
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,460
Speaker 7:  Phone two capture share from the iPhone? It's like that doesn't matter. Like

936
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,020
Speaker 7:  if you're in the Android ecosystem, you now get to pick from

937
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,180
Speaker 7:  like a bunch of different vibes, right? Yeah. You

938
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,980
Speaker 7:  can pick a Galaxy fold and like run Subway

939
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,580
Speaker 7:  servers next to TikTok, next to Discord and like just

940
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,660
Speaker 7:  fully live in that zone, which is crazy. Or you can

941
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,260
Speaker 7:  like get this phone, which is like very chill and has lights on the back.

942
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,420
Speaker 7:  I, I think it's interesting, a neat place for phones to be in, at least on

943
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,780
Speaker 7:  the Android side of the equation where you can, you can almost buy a mood

944
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,940
Speaker 7:  or buy a style and Yeah, and it, it's only because this one has a

945
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,580
Speaker 7:  reasonably good camera and like it does phone things. Well, whereas I think

946
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,820
Speaker 7:  on the, on the iPhone side it has, it's kind of like, boy that camera bump

947
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,460
Speaker 7:  got even bigger. you know? It's like, and that's fine, that's fine. But it's

948
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,780
Speaker 7:  just, at least on the Android side of the equation, you can, you can now

949
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:39,220
Speaker 7:  kind of pick a style, which is interesting and it hasn't always been the

950
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,340
Speaker 7:  case.

951
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,500
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I so I just like a few hours ago sat in this studio

952
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,140
Speaker 11:  wearing this shirt and talked to Carl, pay the CEO of nothing

953
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,140
Speaker 11:  that's gonna be on next Wednesday show. But one of the things he

954
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,940
Speaker 11:  kept saying that I thought was really interesting is, is kind of to your

955
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,140
Speaker 11:  point Eli, that like we're sort of at a point now where like if you just

956
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,580
Speaker 11:  want a phone, this is especially true in the us. If you want a phone

957
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,540
Speaker 11:  and you have no follow up questions, the answer is an iPhone, right? It's

958
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,060
Speaker 11:  like it is, it is sort of, it is the phonet of phones at this point

959
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,460
Speaker 11:  and Samsung is like kind of there on the Android

960
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,380
Speaker 11:  side, but it has some weird bad ideas and some wacky ideas

961
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,340
Speaker 11:  and some good ideas. But Android is the place where there should

962
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,700
Speaker 11:  be lots of different ideas about what a smartphone can like be and do and

963
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,300
Speaker 11:  how it can work. And we're finally, it seems like sort of turning

964
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:30,140
Speaker 11:  into that era and you mentioned like the honor phone that the foldable thing

965
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,580
Speaker 11:  is starting to happen and the tech is getting better really fast. The flip

966
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,780
Speaker 11:  phones are starting to be competitive. If it's like there are finally a

967
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,820
Speaker 11:  bunch of different kinds of phones you can buy in the Android ecosystem.

968
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,620
Speaker 11:  My issue with the Nothing Phone two is it doesn't push on any of those

969
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,540
Speaker 11:  ideas far enough to really feel big.

970
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,140
Speaker 10:  Can anyone push on those ideas? Like one of the reasons Samsung and

971
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,220
Speaker 10:  Apple have become such so big is because they were the ones that had the

972
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,740
Speaker 10:  resource to do things like make the camera not garbage.

973
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:02,780
Speaker 10:  Right. And everybody, nobody else had the, like you need a lot of really

974
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,620
Speaker 10:  good engineers to do that and nobody else could afford that. so like, it

975
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,500
Speaker 10:  seems like most of the big kind of ways to make the phones interesting are

976
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:14,820
Speaker 10:  expensive and nothing is like, okay, well we're just gonna go for the interesting

977
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,940
Speaker 10:  cosmetic stuff because that's a ring light on the back of your phone. It

978
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,780
Speaker 10:  probably costs 'em five bucks to stick it in there.

979
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,220
Speaker 11:  Right? It's like a thing they can do instead of pouring 10 billion into

980
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,620
Speaker 11:  camera R and d. Yeah. Right.

981
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,260
Speaker 7:  But like all things, even camera r and d got

982
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,100
Speaker 7:  commoditized, right? You can, right. Like this phone I think is an example

983
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,060
Speaker 7:  of it per Alison's review. Like it's fine. It's fine. Yeah. In a way

984
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,420
Speaker 7:  that I think when we were sort of on the cusp of computational

985
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,020
Speaker 7:  photography, like you needed the money and now you're like,

986
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,700
Speaker 7:  or I can just buy it off the shelf because it's a commodity.

987
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,660
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I mean. Yeah. And that's even true. Like the, the Nothing Phone has

988
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,700
Speaker 11:  the Snapdragon eight plus gen one, which is technically a last

989
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,380
Speaker 11:  year chip, but it's a very good chip. It does all the things you would need

990
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,020
Speaker 11:  a smartphone chip to do. It's pretty efficient. It's pretty fast. Like that

991
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,980
Speaker 11:  stuff just is widely available now, to your point. Which is,

992
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,940
Speaker 11:  which is really cool. But the weird central tension of all of that is

993
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,660
Speaker 11:  that all this stuff is so commoditized, but there are so many people

994
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,740
Speaker 11:  in the market that it can still be hard to get in because even

995
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,220
Speaker 11:  though everyone is out here building better cameras than ever that you can

996
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,180
Speaker 11:  buy, there's so much more competition to buy those cameras that

997
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:28,180
Speaker 11:  small companies have a hard time getting to these new supposedly

998
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,100
Speaker 11:  commoditized things. Because like Foxconn is just tapped

999
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,300
Speaker 11:  making all the phones for all the other companies making phones. And so

1000
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,980
Speaker 11:  we, it's just, it's a weird thing where it's like the, the stuff is all

1001
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,780
Speaker 11:  there. It's more accessible to more people than ever. And yet it's still

1002
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,260
Speaker 11:  kind of on the other side of the wall unless you're a really big company.

1003
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,340
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Which is I think how you end up with, we're still, we're still here

1004
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,140
Speaker 7:  talking about Apple, Samsung and nothing like Yeah. you know what I mean

1005
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,940
Speaker 7:  and like nothing is connected to a much like, they have the ability

1006
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,620
Speaker 7:  to capture some of the resources from big company just cuz the way cuz Carl

1007
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,580
Speaker 7:  Pay basically. Yeah. It's so cool. I mean like, it has l e d lights in the

1008
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,580
Speaker 7:  back. I want it, can I

1009
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,380
Speaker 11:  Have it? The aesthetic, like honestly the home screen is so, so, so good

1010
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,900
Speaker 11:  looking. They're doing this monochrome thing with the like old timey

1011
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:15,260
Speaker 11:  pixelated text. It just, it just looks so good and it

1012
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,660
Speaker 11:  makes me so happy. And it's like the first Android phone where they're like,

1013
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,300
Speaker 11:  what if we actually gave like one whole shit about what it looked like when

1014
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,980
Speaker 11:  you turned it on And I. Don't feel like there's any other Android manufacturer

1015
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,380
Speaker 11:  out there doing that. And it makes me happy that nothing is doing that.

1016
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:27,820
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

1017
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,300
Speaker 10:  You know what it kinda looks like, it kinda looks like the, the books Palma

1018
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,980
Speaker 10:  that was also announced this week, the Cinch six inch Android

1019
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:35,900
Speaker 10:  e Ink phone.

1020
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,580
Speaker 7:  I knew it was coming. It's not even on the list. And I knew it was coming.

1021
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:40,140
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

1022
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:44,060
Speaker 10:  I I I I was sneaking it in. I was, I was waiting for the right moment and,

1023
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,500
Speaker 10:  and the Nothing Phone gave it to me. But yeah, this thing is, I think this

1024
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,740
Speaker 10:  thing is gorgeous for the same reason that I want the other one is like

1025
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,340
Speaker 10:  I, something about that just monochrome sleek design. I'm like, yeah, all

1026
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,180
Speaker 10:  right. I don't need colors. I got a TV for colors.

1027
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,020
Speaker 10:  That's fine. Shreds doesn't have colors. It's great.

1028
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,940
Speaker 11:  I got a TV for colors is a, is a stance. I would really like you to keep

1029
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,220
Speaker 11:  on this show for a very long time. I'm gonna

1030
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,180
Speaker 10:  See how long I can make that

1031
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,300
Speaker 7:  All the colors I need in life

1032
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,220
Speaker 11:  Are satisfied by my television. Is, is a, is an Alex

1033
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:16,420
Speaker 11:  Cranz belief that I feel like you should carry on for a long time. It's

1034
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,500
Speaker 7:  True. My gadget that I was inevitably gonna sneak into this conversation

1035
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,580
Speaker 7:  is that telly has started shipping the free tv. Yes,

1036
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,020
Speaker 7:  it's real.

1037
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,380
Speaker 11:  Did you guys think it was real?

1038
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,780
Speaker 7:  I knew I mean it's like not a hard product to ship.

1039
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,060
Speaker 11:  It's a tough,

1040
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,820
Speaker 7:  It's tv. They ship it to you for free.

1041
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,940
Speaker 7:  I mean they didn't even have to turn on Stripe. They were just like, here

1042
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,260
Speaker 7:  you go.

1043
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,460
Speaker 10:  How much are they spending on the TVs like, or on the shipping

1044
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,220
Speaker 10:  of the TVs? Cuz anytime I had to review a tv, that was always an

1045
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,380
Speaker 10:  affair. Oh yeah. An expensive one for whatever the company

1046
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,180
Speaker 10:  shipping it to be was.

1047
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,380
Speaker 7:  They had to capitulate. Did you read this? They had to capitulate cuz it,

1048
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,340
Speaker 7:  you know, it doesn't have any streaming software built into it. It just has

1049
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:59,180
Speaker 7:  right intrusive advertising software. So they're just like, screw it. Here's

1050
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:03,060
Speaker 7:  a Google TV dongle. Like in the box. I mean everything about this

1051
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,020
Speaker 7:  is great. I cannot wait for people to get it. I hope

1052
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,820
Speaker 10:  It's just rattling around in there just like, it's not even its own package.

1053
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,140
Speaker 10:  It's like taped on the side.

1054
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:13,380
Speaker 7:  It's sad to me that the Internet's like tearing itself apart right now. Like

1055
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,300
Speaker 7:  it, I'm very happy about it for some reason. But like that Reddit is in turmoil

1056
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,660
Speaker 7:  and like no one Twitter and threads. Like, there's a version of the internet

1057
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,300
Speaker 7:  where immediately disassembling this thing and figuring out how it worked

1058
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:28,060
Speaker 7:  would've been all we all did together for a minute. you know? And like, I,

1059
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,620
Speaker 7:  I just can't wait for people to get this thing.

1060
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,340
Speaker 10:  If you get one, please email us. We wanna know everything. Oh yeah,

1061
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,220
Speaker 7:  Yeah. If you have a telly, I am not allowing one in my home. But if

1062
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:41,020
Speaker 7:  you get one, you know, let me know. Let me know On, on the

1063
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,900
Speaker 7:  side securely from an honest account about how you act.

1064
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,620
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Call the hotline and tell us about your telly and we we can change

1065
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,700
Speaker 11:  your voice and play it on the podcast if that's what you want. I am desperate

1066
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,500
Speaker 11:  to know more about this thing. I think I continue to think it's

1067
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,740
Speaker 11:  actually an extremely good idea. I think it's going to work. I think it's

1068
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,380
Speaker 11:  going to be very successful. I also think it is hilarious

1069
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,180
Speaker 11:  nonsense in the best possible way. Do

1070
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,420
Speaker 10:  We know what panels they're using? No. Like where they're sourcing them.

1071
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,180
Speaker 11:  Free television, Alex. It has all the colors I need. I need

1072
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,860
Speaker 10:  To, I need to know Howing.

1073
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,900
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I mean the whole thing is very, very good. Other gadgets?

1074
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,740
Speaker 7:  There's a rumor that Apple's gonna do a 32 inch iMac. Yes. I'll buy this

1075
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:25,660
Speaker 7:  thing in a heartbeat. I'm so close to always buying a Mac mini. Like

1076
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,940
Speaker 7:  every time there's one on sale and there's one on sale lately all the time.

1077
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,500
Speaker 7:  Especially M one, which is all that I need because all I would, I run one

1078
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,100
Speaker 7:  app to podcast.

1079
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,260
Speaker 11:  I have one and it's wonderful.

1080
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,140
Speaker 7:  I'm always so close to buying one, but I'm like, then I gotta buy a display

1081
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,540
Speaker 7:  and then, you know, you end up in that display thing where like I'm gonna

1082
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,540
Speaker 7:  buy a cheap one, but then I'm, I'm me And I can't buy a cheap one. And I

1083
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,580
Speaker 7:  like crap. I'm not gonna buy a studio. Like you

1084
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,260
Speaker 10:  Spend so much money, it's great. Yeah,

1085
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:47,620
Speaker 7:  Just

1086
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,260
Speaker 10:  Monitors. That's the other place I get my color. Oh,

1087
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,100
Speaker 7:  You're like, I very, this is you should start like a wellness trend. Yeah.

1088
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,740
Speaker 10:  Just have color on your TVs and your mom. Anything bigger than 27 inches

1089
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,380
Speaker 10:  can have color. You can have color on it. I love it. Anything smaller? No,

1090
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,900
Speaker 10:  you should black and white iPad. Like

1091
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,540
Speaker 7:  A chroma diet. Like that's like the TikTok trend. A chroma fest.

1092
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,300
Speaker 10:  Chromo

1093
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,220
Speaker 11:  Fast. Gwyneth Paltrow just trademarked that while you were talking.

1094
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,340
Speaker 10:  No goop. Don't steal her idea.

1095
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,740
Speaker 7:  Goop don't steal. I'm watching you Gwyneth.

1096
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,220
Speaker 11:  The the 32 inch iMac I think is super exciting. I think it's, if we get

1097
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,980
Speaker 11:  a 32 inch iMac before we get a 27 inch iMac, I'm going to be furious because

1098
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:33,460
Speaker 11:  the 27 inch iMac is a perfect product and the fact that it doesn't exist

1099
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,780
Speaker 11:  is so stupid and bad. And a 24 inch iMac is a

1100
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,180
Speaker 11:  dumb idea. But a 27 inch iMac is an amazing idea. But I also think

1101
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:45,420
Speaker 11:  there was this rumor, I don't know if we've heard about it since like January,

1102
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,540
Speaker 11:  but there was this rumor at the beginning of the year that Apple is starting

1103
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,380
Speaker 11:  to think about smart display stuff. And like you look at like standby and

1104
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,700
Speaker 11:  the lock screen widgets and there's like this thing starting to happen where

1105
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,380
Speaker 11:  Apple is like, what can your screens be when you're not using them?

1106
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,020
Speaker 11:  And, I think the idea of like Apple

1107
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:07,140
Speaker 11:  basically doing that with my computer monitor is very

1108
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,260
Speaker 11:  exciting to me. Like make that the hub of all of

1109
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:14,180
Speaker 11:  my stuff because it's a big screen that just sits on my desk and I'm near

1110
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,380
Speaker 11:  it all the time. Like, I love that. I I assume this thing will cost

1111
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,740
Speaker 11:  $67,000 And. I will not buy it. What if

1112
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:24,500
Speaker 10:  It's the iMac pro? Remember? Oh my God. Like if we just to get that

1113
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,460
Speaker 10:  again, that's the 32 inch. You want a big screen, it can't be

1114
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:28,660
Speaker 10:  cheap.

1115
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,580
Speaker 7:  That's very, see this is the problem. It's like I want to buy just an M one

1116
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,500
Speaker 7:  Mac and like a beautiful display that's not expensive or isn't

1117
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,540
Speaker 7:  a panel from 1985, which is the current studio display.

1118
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,380
Speaker 11:  Can I interest you in the Specter 4K monitor that I bought that just randomly

1119
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,180
Speaker 11:  turns off three times a day for no reason. I

1120
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,460
Speaker 7:  See I can't live that life, man. I'm too old now.

1121
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,420
Speaker 10:  I refuse.

1122
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,100
Speaker 7:  I got gray hair in the beard. I only the finest of

1123
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:52,700
Speaker 7:  displays

1124
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:56,220
Speaker 7:  when I break my chromo fast stated,

1125
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,300
Speaker 11:  I only chroma between noon and eight p

1126
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,340
Speaker 7:  I do a 16 eight chromo fast.

1127
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,860
Speaker 10:  HDR is a treat.

1128
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,420
Speaker 7:  All right. All this color has exhausted me. I gotta take a chromo fast. We

1129
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:12,140
Speaker 7:  went back. By the way, did you know when I was in high school I stage

1130
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,860
Speaker 7:  managed over 70 productions of Joseph in the amazing Tech and Color

1131
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,340
Speaker 7:  Dream Code.

1132
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:17,500
Speaker 10:  What

1133
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,060
Speaker 7:  A hundred percent true. We'll be right back. Everybody

1134
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:28,800
Speaker 16:  Unexplainable has got a new two-part series. We're calling the black box.

1135
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:33,040
Speaker 16:  It's all about the mysterious hole at the center of modern artificial intelligence.

1136
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,840
Speaker 17:  I've built these models, I've studied these models, we just don't understand

1137
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,560
Speaker 17:  what's going on here.

1138
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:41,560
Speaker 16:  Even the experts don't really know how these systems work or what they can

1139
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:41,720
Speaker 16:  do

1140
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:45,520
Speaker 17:  If we open up achi PGE or a system like it. You just see

1141
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,640
Speaker 17:  millions of numbers flipping around and we just have no

1142
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,600
Speaker 17:  idea what any of it means.

1143
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,440
Speaker 18:  We are rushing at breakneck speed towards

1144
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,680
Speaker 18:  more and more advanced forms of ai.

1145
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,720
Speaker 19:  You know, when I see something that is well beyond my understanding,

1146
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,560
Speaker 19:  I'm scared. And that was something well beyond my understanding.

1147
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,760
Speaker 16:  I'm know I'm hassenfeld, but this isn't my voice and it hasn't been the

1148
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,320
Speaker 16:  whole time. It's just an AI made that sounds sort of like me. An

1149
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,040
Speaker 16:  unexplainable new series starts July 12th, wherever you get your podcast.

1150
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:26,940
Speaker 7:  All right, we're back.

1151
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,820
Speaker 11:  I have so many questions, Mila? Yes. Yeah,

1152
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,860
Speaker 10:  We we've got something to talk. No. Lightning round.

1153
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,660
Speaker 7:  This is just, just gonna talk about Joseph. All right. I'm just gonna tell

1154
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:38,420
Speaker 7:  this, this one, there's so many stories embedded in this. So I was like a,

1155
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:42,500
Speaker 7:  like a theater tech nerd kid. Same. This should be very

1156
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:42,780
Speaker 7:  obvious

1157
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,780
Speaker 11:  To everyone. Super off-brand for Neli. Yeah.

1158
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,740
Speaker 7:  And so it's like summer in Wisconsin in the

1159
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:53,020
Speaker 7:  nineties by theater nerd friends, And I all just like descend on the

1160
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,860
Speaker 7:  Racine Theater Guild, which is mounting a production of Joseph Mason's. This

1161
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,740
Speaker 7:  is true happening. I don't know how I don dunno how to describe all the

1162
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:04,420
Speaker 7:  things that happened there, but rest assured there's a scene in this Andrew Lloyd

1163
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:08,020
Speaker 7:  Webber musical where Josephs and brothers have to destroy a goat. Are you

1164
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,060
Speaker 7:  aware of this? This is a real thing that happens in the show. Yes. And there

1165
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:14,980
Speaker 7:  Scene Theater Guild is theater in the round so that there's VMs down

1166
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:17,980
Speaker 7:  the side of the stage. So to get the goat on at the stage, you couldn't build

1167
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,740
Speaker 7:  the normal things that you would build. So I took a remote controlled truck

1168
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,940
Speaker 7:  and disassembled it and built a goat on top of it. And we had a

1169
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,740
Speaker 7:  remote controlled goat that, this is like one of my like highlight of my

1170
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,460
Speaker 7:  use that's

1171
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,740
Speaker 11:  Legitimately like peak nili. Would

1172
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,700
Speaker 10:  It like drive in?

1173
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,340
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it would like, would like speed up the, the side of the sage

1174
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,060
Speaker 7:  and then they would like rip its legs off and like, you know, he would sing

1175
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,860
Speaker 7:  about how sad he he was or whatever. And then we would drive the disembodied

1176
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,060
Speaker 7:  goat And I thing one time in the minute of these many shows cuz we were like

1177
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,300
Speaker 7:  teenagers. We were like, go out and party after every single one of these

1178
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,740
Speaker 7:  things. Of course, course I forgot to plug the, you know, the old school

1179
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,980
Speaker 7:  RC battery back in his charger. So the the pork goat come back

1180
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:00,940
Speaker 7:  down off the stage. It just went and yeah, that

1181
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:04,780
Speaker 7:  thing just got kicked. Just straight up dance kicked off the

1182
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:05,140
Speaker 7:  stage.

1183
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,500
Speaker 11:  This really feels like the, the, the adult version of Neli needs

1184
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,500
Speaker 11:  to disassemble his Ford Raptor and turn it

1185
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,660
Speaker 11:  into a robot coat.

1186
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,260
Speaker 10:  That's your weekend plan.

1187
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:23,020
Speaker 7:  I hadn't thought about that until crumba fast. I'm gonna cry.

1188
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,340
Speaker 7:  All right. It's a lightning round. Yeah. Cranz you should

1189
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:33,220
Speaker 7:  start cuz as we've been talking there has been massive news

1190
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,060
Speaker 7:  in the world of entertainment.

1191
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:38,100
Speaker 10:  Yes. As we were talking, SAG declared that starting Friday at

1192
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:41,260
Speaker 10:  midnight, they're on strike. So they're officially, if you're listening

1193
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:45,020
Speaker 10:  to this SAG is on strike. They're picketing. This is the first time

1194
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:49,300
Speaker 10:  both SAG and the writer skill. The WGA we're both

1195
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,300
Speaker 10:  on strike since 1960. Yeah. So it's,

1196
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,820
Speaker 10:  it's been a while. Like W G A goes on strike at the drop of a hat. Love

1197
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:59,700
Speaker 10:  him for it. But SAG usually doesn't.

1198
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,100
Speaker 7:  We should note a series of escalating disclosures here.

1199
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:06,140
Speaker 10:  I know. I wanted to see how far it could get before you interrupted. Well

1200
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,300
Speaker 7:  I think once he get to WGA strikes the drop of hat, I think we have to disclose

1201
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,340
Speaker 7:  our newsroom. Wonderful people unionized with wga.

1202
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:18,550
Speaker 7:  They're great. We love them. Great. I'm a member. Yeah. Cranz in it.

1203
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,150
Speaker 7:  Great. We're fine. But we should disclose that. Yes, we make

1204
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,110
Speaker 7:  television shows with Netflix and HBO. I'm the executive producer of a Netflix

1205
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,750
Speaker 7:  show and then Comcast, which Trans NBC is an investor in the company. All

1206
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,670
Speaker 7:  of them are on the one side of the table or the other.

1207
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,550
Speaker 10:  None of them are making anything as you're listening because all the

1208
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:37,070
Speaker 10:  actors and the writers are on strike.

1209
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,470
Speaker 11:  Well and this is also happening as there was this big deadline

1210
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,390
Speaker 11:  story in which a bunch of unnamed studio executives basically

1211
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:49,430
Speaker 11:  said, not even basically said in as many words, we are

1212
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:52,470
Speaker 11:  just going to wait out the writers until they lose their homes and then

1213
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,830
Speaker 11:  they're gonna have to come back to the table and we're gonna win

1214
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:58,070
Speaker 10:  Is incredibly stupid.

1215
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:02,310
Speaker 11:  And there was apparently some backroom, this is not like a dumb thing an

1216
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:05,830
Speaker 11:  executive said off the top of their head, there was some like backroom strategizing

1217
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,870
Speaker 11:  among studio executives apparently who decided to say all this

1218
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:13,830
Speaker 11:  stuff to a reporter who was going to put

1219
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:17,510
Speaker 11:  it into a story as if it was like a negotiating

1220
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,790
Speaker 11:  move. And instead I think it has,

1221
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:25,750
Speaker 11:  to the extent that you can move things even more against a bunch

1222
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,630
Speaker 11:  of billionaires who are mad at writers for wanting to have homes,

1223
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:33,110
Speaker 11:  it has shifted it even further against the billionaires who don't want writers

1224
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,630
Speaker 11:  to have homes. It's really something.

1225
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:38,470
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it backfired terrifically. There are rumors

1226
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:42,430
Speaker 10:  that there's like recording of the video call of all the producers arguing

1227
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,990
Speaker 10:  about the deadline story after it went up. Which if you have that hit me

1228
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,430
Speaker 10:  up. Yeah, I would love to see it.

1229
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,630
Speaker 11:  Cranz posted the phrase And I quote. This is my peepee tape. I must

1230
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:53,070
Speaker 11:  see it.

1231
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,870
Speaker 7:  It's of our chest, everyone.

1232
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:57,790
Speaker 10:  And we're done.

1233
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,710
Speaker 7:  I think that's the fastest segue from Andrew Lloyd Weber to Peepee tape

1234
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:05,230
Speaker 7:  in media history. That's a PhD thesis for you

1235
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:06,590
Speaker 11:  Breaking records here on the first

1236
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:09,630
Speaker 7:  Call. Dr. Guinness.

1237
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:13,910
Speaker 7:  I don't know if there's a Dr. Guinness, I dunno how any of that works.

1238
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:18,150
Speaker 10:  But yeah, this, this thing is, is popping off. And it didn't help

1239
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:21,950
Speaker 10:  that Bob Iger today said that the, the writers were hurting the

1240
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:25,910
Speaker 10:  industry. I think that probably only added fuel to the fire.

1241
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,390
Speaker 10:  Fran Drescher spoke. She's the president of sag The Nanny.

1242
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:31,430
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

1243
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:35,350
Speaker 10:  Yeah, yeah. That's her. She's the president of sag. She had a very fiery

1244
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:39,110
Speaker 10:  speech saying that basically they're, they're ruining lives. They're getting

1245
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:42,350
Speaker 10:  rid of residuals. That's, that's the big thing here. That's like the big

1246
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:46,310
Speaker 10:  fight with both the W G A and SAG is they want residuals. If they

1247
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:50,030
Speaker 10:  make product, they wanna make money from that years down the line because

1248
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:53,430
Speaker 10:  that's how most of them support themselves. Especially like people who maybe

1249
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,430
Speaker 10:  have big careers in their thirties and then nothing in their forties because

1250
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:01,150
Speaker 10:  people start hiring them for a wide variety of reasons, usually due to

1251
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:05,150
Speaker 10:  ageism. So they really want these residuals and the companies are like,

1252
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:08,630
Speaker 10:  well no, because we are due streaming now and we don't make enough money

1253
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:12,350
Speaker 10:  to pay you residuals. But I Bob Iger make 27 million

1254
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:16,620
Speaker 10:  a year And I think you guys need to get back to work just

1255
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:20,620
Speaker 10:  a terrifically tone deaf move on his part. That was a

1256
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:20,780
Speaker 10:  real

1257
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:24,620
Speaker 7:  Bummer. So I encourage everyone to go watch this Agar, we Iger was on cnbc.

1258
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:28,500
Speaker 7:  It's the Sun Valley con. It's an incredible setting to be like, this strike

1259
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,060
Speaker 7:  is disturbing and it should stop. Right? He's at Sun Valley. It's because

1260
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:34,540
Speaker 11:  This is where all the billionaires go to make mogul deals

1261
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,140
Speaker 11:  where they buy each other's companies.

1262
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:39,260
Speaker 7:  Right. Like the next turn he's gonna be like, and we're consolidating all

1263
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:43,060
Speaker 7:  the studios even for like, who knows. Right. But the occasion of it

1264
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,300
Speaker 7:  is that he just signed it new to your contract. Like he's never leaving Disney.

1265
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,420
Speaker 7:  No. They're like the last thing that they're gonna do at Bob Iger is instead

1266
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:54,340
Speaker 7:  of the animatronic Spider-Man, they're just gonna yeat him into the sun.

1267
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,500
Speaker 7:  That exhibit and that's how he's gonna go out. Right? Like it's,

1268
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:02,500
Speaker 7:  he's, he's just in the company. And he said two things are interesting. One,

1269
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:05,620
Speaker 7:  he said the strike is disturbing. Like the actors and the writers are not

1270
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,100
Speaker 7:  paying attention to the economic reality of this industry. Which is fascinating

1271
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,580
Speaker 7:  and you can feel any way you want about that. Like on some level

1272
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:17,540
Speaker 7:  there is an a grain of truth in there, which is these companies do not make

1273
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:20,380
Speaker 7:  as much money selling Seinfeld

1274
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:24,300
Speaker 7:  60 billion times over and over again in different territories around the

1275
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,100
Speaker 7:  world. Like that's the economics of that are not happening. Should they still

1276
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,740
Speaker 7:  make it more equitable? They should. And like somewhere in there is probably

1277
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,580
Speaker 7:  the right icon, but nobody knows what it's, and then he said, oh I

1278
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:38,500
Speaker 7:  might sell ESPN and abc like linear television is like on its

1279
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,220
Speaker 7:  way out for us and we might have to do something else. And that is like,

1280
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,620
Speaker 7:  that's the end of Disney as we know it. ESPN funded

1281
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:49,540
Speaker 7:  everything like the cable fees for ESPN funded the

1282
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:53,220
Speaker 7:  acquisition of Marvel and Lucas film and all this stuff. And that

1283
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,500
Speaker 7:  engine is gone is basically what he's saying. And I think that is utterly

1284
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:56,980
Speaker 7:  fascinating.

1285
01:09:57,410 --> 01:10:01,220
Speaker 11:  Well, and not only that, ESPN like was the

1286
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:04,860
Speaker 11:  shining star of the cable business. Yep. For decades. Like

1287
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:09,020
Speaker 11:  a big part of the reason that the cable business has started to go away

1288
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:13,340
Speaker 11:  comes back to what people say about espn, which is what, I don't wanna pay

1289
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,940
Speaker 11:  these massive carriage fees for sports because I don't watch sports and

1290
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:20,860
Speaker 11:  my cable bill includes $7 a month for ESPN because ESPN has to

1291
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,220
Speaker 11:  pay billions of dollars to the NBA in order to get games. So they're charging

1292
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,340
Speaker 11:  the cable providers who are charging me And, I don't watch sports. And so

1293
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:31,180
Speaker 11:  like that is the single cleanest example of why unbundling is useful.

1294
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,460
Speaker 11:  And it has just, it, it's destroying ESPN as it happens.

1295
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:39,380
Speaker 11:  Like ESPN spent so much money because it could pass those fees

1296
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:43,380
Speaker 11:  on to so many people. And it is now, I think very much an

1297
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:46,780
Speaker 11:  open question of does that business continue to exist?

1298
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,220
Speaker 11:  If you have to just charge directly the people who watch the sports.

1299
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:53,380
Speaker 10:  Where are the sports? Oh that's like, are they still on

1300
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,140
Speaker 7:  Espn? Yeah, they're on Reddit.

1301
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:01,900
Speaker 7:  Like it's just, it's so true for so many people

1302
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,740
Speaker 7:  that's so complicated to watch sports that piring the streams are right.

1303
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,260
Speaker 7:  It is easier.

1304
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,540
Speaker 11:  Oh yeah. And sports is a disaster and this will take a long time to play

1305
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,500
Speaker 11:  out because they sell these rights like a decade at a time. And so it's

1306
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,740
Speaker 11:  gonna get real weird. But also the thing that happened is companies like

1307
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,660
Speaker 11:  Disney signed decade long deals thinking that cable was gonna vary

1308
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,900
Speaker 11:  slowly and carefully. Decline and streaming was gonna grow and the money

1309
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,380
Speaker 11:  was gonna offset and everybody was gonna get rich. And now what it looks

1310
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:29,740
Speaker 11:  like is all the numbers are down big really fast. And so

1311
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:33,420
Speaker 11:  Iger is saying like, we need a strategic partner for

1312
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:37,980
Speaker 11:  ESPN was so like Disney other than money, Disney doesn't need anything

1313
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,500
Speaker 11:  in terms of like how to do content. And so the

1314
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,260
Speaker 11:  fact that even Disney can't figure this out is fascinating. You also just

1315
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,700
Speaker 11:  stole my lightning round thing, which is the ESPN thing, so that's fine.

1316
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,300
Speaker 11:  So I I'm I'm done.

1317
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,300
Speaker 7:  That's you. I've got another, I got that Google thing in you for your lightning

1318
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:53,500
Speaker 7:  round.

1319
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,860
Speaker 11:  No, I don't even want to, I'm just mad about ESPN now.

1320
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,580
Speaker 7:  You're just mad about espn. David, there's a big future

1321
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,540
Speaker 7:  of sports media piece to be written cuz it is just a total chaos zone

1322
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,140
Speaker 7:  right now. Yeah. And even just stuff like Twitter and Instagram threats,

1323
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:10,820
Speaker 7:  like that's where the center of gravity in sports has been for a while.

1324
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:14,740
Speaker 7:  Right? It's like I, here, here's a story I want, I'm desperate

1325
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,660
Speaker 7:  for this. Do you know when, if you're a sports fan, you see this happen

1326
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:22,260
Speaker 7:  like every season, like high school students get recruited by a college and

1327
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,740
Speaker 7:  they say they're gonna commit to some college, right? This like happens in

1328
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:28,500
Speaker 7:  every sport and they all put up like Instagram templates

1329
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:32,500
Speaker 7:  where they've written a bunch of copy and they have a bunch of photos. I

1330
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,460
Speaker 7:  just wanna know who designs the templates, who's doing it, who's opening

1331
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:40,100
Speaker 7:  Canva and listening to some 17 year old talk about how Jesus is in their

1332
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,780
Speaker 7:  heart and they were always meant to play for asu. Like who is it?

1333
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,260
Speaker 7:  Let me know. Like I just wanna talk to you.

1334
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:49,620
Speaker 11:  I have all the jerseys done. Yeah,

1335
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:53,700
Speaker 7:  It's, it's amazing, right? And it's like where that's a whole economy

1336
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,420
Speaker 7:  of creators and creatives and agencies and da da da da that exist because

1337
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,300
Speaker 7:  of Instagram, not because of espn. And so like you just see like even

1338
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,140
Speaker 7:  that part of it is shifting. I I just think it's like there's a whole thing

1339
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,380
Speaker 7:  to be written about how all of it is shifting, but then the actual part of

1340
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,860
Speaker 7:  it where you like sit down and watch the games is So Hard that it's easier

1341
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,180
Speaker 7:  to open Reddit and just find them.

1342
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:15,180
Speaker 11:  Yeah. And it's gonna cascade through everything else because sports have

1343
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:18,980
Speaker 11:  been the richest thing in TV on all sides for a really long time. Yeah,

1344
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,020
Speaker 11:  we'll we'll talk about that more Neli, what's your lightning round

1345
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,220
Speaker 7:  I mean? Everyone saw this coming in my way. It's Sarah Silverman is suing

1346
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,620
Speaker 7:  OpenAI and Meta for copyright infringement.

1347
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,260
Speaker 11:  Oh weird. Neli wants to talk about legal things. Whoa. What?

1348
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:31,820
Speaker 7:  I love it. I think enough

1349
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,140
Speaker 11:  It How does this relate to Joseph in the technical dream code would you

1350
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,300
Speaker 11:  say?

1351
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:38,020
Speaker 7:  Well, so Sarah Silverman has a code of many colors and those colors

1352
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,380
Speaker 7:  are a number of legal theories about ai,

1353
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,700
Speaker 7:  you know, a real problem being authorized. I, I'm tweeting at lawsuits again

1354
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,580
Speaker 7:  and people are like, yeah, this is what we came here for. And it's like,

1355
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,460
Speaker 7:  this is not the feedback loop America needs

1356
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,180
Speaker 11:  More lawsuits.

1357
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:55,780
Speaker 7:  Like no, no, no, no, no. This is what I was trying to get away from easy

1358
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:59,740
Speaker 7:  dopamine hit by saying I hate this judge. Like stop it bad, but I'll do it

1359
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,540
Speaker 7:  anyway cuz I'm addicted to it. Anyway, Sarah Sullivan, there's a law firm

1360
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:07,460
Speaker 7:  basically that is organizing itself around suing the AI

1361
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:11,100
Speaker 7:  companies. So they had a couple other offer, they had a couple other

1362
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:14,780
Speaker 7:  children's book authors and now they filed the second one, Sarah Silverman,

1363
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:18,220
Speaker 7:  some other authors. And they're basically saying, look, you can ask these

1364
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:22,020
Speaker 7:  tools to summarize these books and then they do it at some

1365
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:25,460
Speaker 7:  point. That means you have made a copy of this book

1366
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,820
Speaker 7:  and that copy was unauthorized. And that's the whole argument.

1367
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:33,860
Speaker 7:  It's a pretty good argument. Like as far as legal,

1368
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:37,940
Speaker 7:  it's not like out on a ledge, right? It's saying, Hey, did you have permission

1369
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,580
Speaker 7:  to make this copy of this book? Because usually you don't,

1370
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:45,940
Speaker 11:  Isn't that like, basically exactly what worked for the record

1371
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,980
Speaker 11:  companies against all the free pirating websites was it was like,

1372
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,980
Speaker 11:  we, we can worry about all the big picture stuff, but you're taking our

1373
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,820
Speaker 11:  thing and you're putting it over here and that's not allowed.

1374
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,260
Speaker 7:  No, it was slightly different. Like Sarah Jong And I could probably do like

1375
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,380
Speaker 7:  two hours of our chest on that. They, they had to invent all these theories

1376
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:05,180
Speaker 7:  about how they were enabling users to do copier infringement. Oh, okay.

1377
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:08,380
Speaker 7:  Right. so like Napster wasn't doing any infringement on its own. Like I was

1378
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,300
Speaker 7:  sending a file from my computer to your computer and that was unauthorized.

1379
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,860
Speaker 7:  But Napster created a business that let us do that. And they knew that what

1380
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:18,820
Speaker 7:  they, and they, they just had to like invent a bunch of legal theories about

1381
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,100
Speaker 7:  contributory copy or whatever. So

1382
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,540
Speaker 11:  This one's even more straightforward than

1383
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:26,420
Speaker 7:  That. This is just straight up like, did you make a copy of this book? Did

1384
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:30,340
Speaker 7:  you have permission to make a copy of this book? If you did not have

1385
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:33,940
Speaker 7:  permission, is it fair use for you to have made a copy of this book, ingest

1386
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:37,700
Speaker 7:  it into your servers, and then deliver what is obviously a

1387
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,460
Speaker 7:  derivative work of this book, which is a summary of the book. Wouldn't

1388
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:44,900
Speaker 10:  That have ramifications for like everything computers

1389
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,460
Speaker 7:  Do? Yes. Without question, like

1390
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,140
Speaker 7:  all computers do is make copies, right? Like the fundamentally in copyright

1391
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,820
Speaker 7:  law is like very backwards in this way because it, I, I think I've said this

1392
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:59,660
Speaker 7:  many times in the show, it's hard for people in the computer era to wrap

1393
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,580
Speaker 7:  their heads around the, the basic of copyright law, which is that

1394
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:07,460
Speaker 7:  it regulates the act of making copies. So if I make a copy of something

1395
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:10,780
Speaker 7:  that implicates copyright law, if you don't make a copy, then there's nothing

1396
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,220
Speaker 7:  duh, whatever. Like, right? so like you reading the book, you have

1397
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:18,580
Speaker 7:  not made a copy of the book, you reading a book perfectly

1398
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:22,260
Speaker 7:  memorizing it and then writing it all down is an

1399
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:25,460
Speaker 7:  unauthorized copy of the book. Can you do that? Most people cannot do that.

1400
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:29,620
Speaker 7:  Computers can do that at rapid scale. so like, there's a, just a

1401
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:33,500
Speaker 7:  decade of law, like Furious Law Google Books. Like

1402
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:37,180
Speaker 7:  go look at that case like ferocious lawsuit about the existence of Google

1403
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:41,060
Speaker 7:  Books. Amazon, do you remember they had a Kindle and the Kindle had

1404
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,660
Speaker 7:  text to speech built into it. Ferocious lawsuit from the

1405
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:47,940
Speaker 7:  author's Guild about whether that was copyright infringement. That makes

1406
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,060
Speaker 7:  no sense to me. Like just right. Like it's text, it's on my computer, I can

1407
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,060
Speaker 7:  hit a button, it should read it to me. They're like, no, that's a derivative

1408
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:57,020
Speaker 7:  work. We make a lot of money doing audio books. You can't have it.

1409
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:01,060
Speaker 7:  Like, you we're not letting you make that copy. And they, they won

1410
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:04,420
Speaker 7:  essentially like they got a settlement on Amazon. so like there's just this

1411
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:08,100
Speaker 7:  thing where it's like, it's the simplest thing and like the hardest

1412
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:11,940
Speaker 7:  thing in any conversation is to keep people focused on the simplest thing,

1413
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:15,780
Speaker 7:  which is did you make a copy of the book? Like everyone spins off into like

1414
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,260
Speaker 7:  the philosophy of it. It's like, no, no, no. Did they make a copy of the

1415
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,140
Speaker 7:  book? Did they have permission to make that copy of the book? The

1416
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,940
Speaker 7:  answer is like, obviously no And I. I think this is the,

1417
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:29,820
Speaker 7:  these lawsuits are just gonna escalate because copyright laws is like not

1418
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:33,140
Speaker 7:  ready for this problem. Well that's exciting. Yeah, I'm thrilled.

1419
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,740
Speaker 11:  And then just to bring this all the way back around, the FTC is also now

1420
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,900
Speaker 11:  investigating OpenAI for the way that it has gotten

1421
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:44,980
Speaker 11:  some of that data to train its models and it just

1422
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:48,620
Speaker 11:  feels like, like Sam Altman was out here a while ago being like, please

1423
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:52,780
Speaker 11:  regulate us. We love regulation. And like boy is he about to get what he

1424
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:53,140
Speaker 11:  asked for.

1425
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:57,340
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But he's like, he's like regulates some like mythical problem. He's

1426
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,380
Speaker 7:  like, make it illegal for the AI to launch nuclear weapons. And it's like

1427
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:04,540
Speaker 7:  fine. Good. The part where it's like the AI is hoovered up all the

1428
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:08,460
Speaker 7:  data in the world without permission and hasn't returned any of that

1429
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:12,420
Speaker 7:  value to any of the people who made the, the starting works that

1430
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,100
Speaker 7:  is a decade of litigation, like straight up a decade of lawsuits to come,

1431
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:19,620
Speaker 7:  which is great cuz we have a website and we like writing about lawsuits and

1432
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,420
Speaker 7:  the people on threads are like super into it when I tweet about the lawsuits.

1433
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,140
Speaker 7:  So off we go.

1434
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:26,060
Speaker 11:  I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna, we're gonna have one Vergecast

1435
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:29,620
Speaker 11:  episode a year that's just 19 hours long and it's just all of

1436
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,060
Speaker 11:  NE's thoughts about copyright loss.

1437
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,820
Speaker 7:  It's like a honey pot Vergecast episode. Right?

1438
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,460
Speaker 11:  And we never even publish it. It's just, it's just on the internet. It's

1439
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:37,940
Speaker 11:  gonna be great.

1440
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,340
Speaker 7:  I think people, the the, we've been threatening that one. I keep threatening

1441
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,980
Speaker 7:  an hour long about metadata on decoder. It's all, it's all coming.

1442
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,540
Speaker 7:  That's what we're here for. Absolutely. We're the people who did to do

1443
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,220
Speaker 7:  holiday spectaculars,

1444
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:55,580
Speaker 7:  very few other publications at our scale or sustained success. People are

1445
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:59,300
Speaker 7:  like, why is the purchase of sustained success? I'm like, hour long htmi

1452
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:18,140
Speaker 7:  but I actually, I don't remember any of the words. David, you're a musical

1455
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,620
Speaker 11:  I could sing you several songs from Jesus Christ Superstar, which feels

Speaker 11:  like it's in,

1457
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:29,500
