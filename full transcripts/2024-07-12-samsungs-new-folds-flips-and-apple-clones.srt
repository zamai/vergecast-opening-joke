7
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:37,515
Speaker 2:  lot to say there. My favorite story of the hurricane, if You can have a

8
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:41,155
Speaker 2:  favorite story from a giant hurricane, has caused a great deal of harm. Bold

9
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:42,355
Speaker 4:  Way to start a story. Yeah, go

10
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:46,235
Speaker 2:  On. Is is the people like the Texas Power Utilities don't have

11
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:50,155
Speaker 2:  apps. So people are using the Whataburger app. I saw to find

12
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:53,835
Speaker 2:  what areas still have blackouts because the, what? Burgers are offline

13
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:54,315
Speaker 5:  And rules.

14
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:58,035
Speaker 2:  It's life finds away. Do you know what I'm saying?

15
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:02,715
Speaker 2:  Life finds away. Alright, well hopefully we can be a little ray

16
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:06,235
Speaker 2:  of sunshine in this time. If you are stuck down there. There's a lot of gadget

17
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:09,675
Speaker 2:  needs. Talk about Samsung did have unpacked a bunch of phones. Motorola has

18
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:13,795
Speaker 2:  new flip phones, which Allison reviewed. There's a bunch of streaming news.

19
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:18,635
Speaker 2:  Alex today was once again horny for David Zav in Slack

20
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:21,755
Speaker 2:  quite openly. That was a real thing that happened today. Days,

21
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:22,515
Speaker 5:  It's all days

22
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:27,555
Speaker 2:  And we got a lightning round. Unsponsored is always, I'm trying to sell

23
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:31,555
Speaker 2:  our soul here. People, we get a lot of inquiries. I will say this,

24
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:35,155
Speaker 2:  we get a lot of inquiries at price points that are entirely too low for my

25
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:35,355
Speaker 2:  soul.

26
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,195
Speaker 2:  Just keep that in mind. We're

27
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:39,635
Speaker 5:  Reasonable cost for your soul.

28
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:43,715
Speaker 2:  We're trying to buy boats. All right. Not dinghies. That's the lighting,

29
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:44,315
Speaker 2:  right? Everybody.

30
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,475
Speaker 4:  Boat's not dinghies. That's, that's going on a shirt. I don't know what,

31
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:49,715
Speaker 4:  I don't know what it's advertising, but we're putting that on

32
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:52,555
Speaker 2:  Her shirt. I was gonna say, I can buy my own unicorn floaties for my daughter.

33
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,755
Speaker 2:  I I don't need your help.

34
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:58,635
Speaker 2:  Alright, let's get into it. David, tell us about unpacked. It was like a

35
00:02:58,635 --> 00:02:58,915
Speaker 2:  big one.

36
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:03,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I sort of, this is a very weird year. So

37
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:07,365
Speaker 4:  Samsung I think probably tries the hardest

38
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:11,685
Speaker 4:  of any tech company to have cool events. Would you guys say

39
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:15,205
Speaker 4:  that's fair? Like Apple has the big ones, but they're increasingly, like

40
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:18,325
Speaker 4:  at Apple Park in a theater, they make a video. We like kind of know how they're

41
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:22,045
Speaker 4:  doing it. Samsung is like tr Samsung tries

42
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:23,645
Speaker 4:  so hard. Like so hard.

43
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,885
Speaker 2:  So I can explain this 'cause we've been talking about this for a long time

44
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,765
Speaker 2:  and it, it's gotten weirder in a weird way. Like the weirdness of it is

45
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:30,325
Speaker 2:  getting weirder

46
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:31,685
Speaker 4:  Is itself weird. Yeah. Okay. Do

47
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:34,685
Speaker 2:  You know what I mean? Like the mechanism of weirdness is getting weirder.

48
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:39,365
Speaker 2:  So Apple for the longest time had like

49
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:43,165
Speaker 2:  massive cultural influence. Like Steve Jobs was like, I don't know, here's

50
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:46,085
Speaker 2:  Coldplay. They're gonna tell you how good the iPod is. Yeah. Bono was on

51
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:49,645
Speaker 2:  stage one year, famously scrubbed from the internet.

52
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:54,125
Speaker 2:  Kanye West closed out a ww DC by playing Gold digger. Is that

53
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:58,245
Speaker 2:  true? And let me tell you, that audience did not scream

54
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,485
Speaker 2:  Prenup. Dead silence. Boy.

55
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:07,125
Speaker 2:  Like it is impossible to find this video that it is removed. Apple just

56
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:07,765
Speaker 2:  deleted it.

57
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:08,205
Speaker 4:  Wow.

58
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:12,405
Speaker 2:  But Kanye was like, H we want prenup. and it was just like, we do not sir.

59
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:14,565
Speaker 2:  We're good.

60
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:17,245
Speaker 4:  One Apple play just goes, I'm under NDA.

61
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:21,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It was so weird. The weekend has played at a

62
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:25,805
Speaker 2:  wwc just straight singing about cocaine at 10 30 in the morning.

63
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,925
Speaker 2:  Weird. But Apple is able to do it. Like their brand has the

64
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:33,365
Speaker 2:  cultural capacity for these moments

65
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:38,085
Speaker 2:  and now they don't, which is weird. Like they've gotten

66
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,965
Speaker 2:  so corporate, they're making infomercials. They're like, I tried to use these

67
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:44,565
Speaker 2:  AI tools and I couldn't like, you know, it's like, it's weird. It's like

68
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:48,525
Speaker 2:  QVC, but they still have the cachet. Samsung has been trying to buy it

69
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,605
Speaker 2:  for years. So they're like, I dunno, here's a Broadway play about how

70
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:56,445
Speaker 2:  women can't use phones, which is a real thing they did. Yep. That's a

71
00:04:56,445 --> 00:05:00,085
Speaker 2:  real story. Here's more famous people. Sidney Sweeney was at this event,

72
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:02,445
Speaker 2:  which we, we should talk about. Yes. Very odd moment with Sidney Sweeney

73
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:05,805
Speaker 2:  at this event. So they keep trying to buy celebrities and influencers

74
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:10,525
Speaker 2:  to get to the level of cultural relevance that Apple

75
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:14,645
Speaker 2:  has long had. But Apple doesn't actually, they're

76
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,485
Speaker 2:  not that company anymore. They're just bigger. Yeah. They're like a nation

77
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,205
Speaker 2:  state. And

78
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:21,125
Speaker 4:  I will say to Samsung's credit, I mean speaking of nation state's, Jesus,

79
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:25,125
Speaker 4:  but to Samsung's credit, it

80
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:29,005
Speaker 4:  is still very invested in doing these things live in a way that Apple has

81
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:32,965
Speaker 4:  gone full. Let's all sit here and watch a video. Samsung is like

82
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:36,485
Speaker 4:  trying to create spectacle in a way that I, I kind of appreciate,

83
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:39,245
Speaker 2:  I appreciate you, but that's what I mean by the mechanism of the weirdness

84
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:43,165
Speaker 2:  is getting weirder. Yeah. Like that's been the disconnect is like Apple's

85
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:46,685
Speaker 2:  the cool and then Apple and Samsung's trying to buy the coolness. Yeah. And

86
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:49,845
Speaker 2:  now it's like Apple doesn't even try to be cool. Like

87
00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:51,525
Speaker 2:  whatever. It's like, like

88
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,765
Speaker 4:  You have no choice. Which, you know, one thing about being cool, that's how

89
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:54,685
Speaker 4:  to actually be cool.

90
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:59,725
Speaker 2:  They're just like over it. And Samsung is like, here's even more, more

91
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:02,005
Speaker 2:  stuff like more hype, more

92
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,805
Speaker 5:  Spec. Here's Sydnee Sweeney,

93
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:07,165
Speaker 2:  Here's Sydnee Sweeney having like being forced to react

94
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,485
Speaker 2:  to like a deep fake herself. It's truly bizarre though. Let's,

95
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:11,685
Speaker 2:  let's

96
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:15,485
Speaker 4:  Come back to that. So, but this one was, they did it in Paris, which on

97
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:19,045
Speaker 4:  the one hand makes a certain kind of sense because Paris is, it's where the

98
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,645
Speaker 4:  Olympics is happening the summer. It's a big deal. All that stuff on the

99
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:25,085
Speaker 4:  other hand makes no sense because it's two weeks until the Olympics. It's

100
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,805
Speaker 4:  not like it's the middle of the Olympics. Like it's this

101
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:32,805
Speaker 4:  long break Olympics. Like, it's just weird that Samsung picked to

102
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:36,485
Speaker 4:  do this, but whatever. They did it in Paris. Lots of people went, they seemed

103
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:39,965
Speaker 4:  to fly in a ton of like creators and influencers and people, lots of folks

104
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:43,285
Speaker 4:  in Paris. We didn't have anybody there, but lots of folks were there and

105
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:48,965
Speaker 4:  had I what seemed like a giant like warehouse sized

106
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:52,885
Speaker 4:  theater thing, it was like the Samsung event and then like a,

107
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:56,725
Speaker 4:  like a really dirty rave was like the vibe I got from this building.

108
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:57,925
Speaker 2:  So Paris.

109
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:01,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's fair. Touche. and

110
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:06,525
Speaker 4:  it was, it, the reason I'm so hung up on the Apple comparison

111
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,605
Speaker 4:  here is because Samsung basically got up and launched a bunch of Apple products

112
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,645
Speaker 4:  like, like in a very direct, real way.

113
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:17,245
Speaker 4:  Launched a bunch of Apple products and they launched phones that I think

114
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:18,885
Speaker 4:  are cool and interesting and we should talk about and

115
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:21,685
Speaker 2:  The ring. But there are two in particular where you're like, oh

116
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:23,205
Speaker 5:  Thanks Apple.

117
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:27,125
Speaker 4:  And, and it's just Samsung is like doing

118
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:31,125
Speaker 4:  a weird thing where it is becoming less

119
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:35,125
Speaker 4:  Samsung all the time and it's doing Google AI plus Apple

120
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:38,525
Speaker 4:  hardware and, and kind of pretending that that is Samsung.

121
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,645
Speaker 4:  And I think that's bizarre.

122
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:44,005
Speaker 5:  Isn't that what happens when you work on Saturdays? You just say, what if

123
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,045
Speaker 5:  we take these two and swish 'em together? Well,

124
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:49,805
Speaker 2:  If we cut our costs by just firing the design teams entirely. Yeah.

125
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:53,645
Speaker 2:  I don't know. Let's just do the two Apple ones first. 'cause the other products

126
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:57,525
Speaker 2:  are fundamentally more interesting. Right? So it's the Galaxy Buds and the

127
00:07:57,525 --> 00:08:01,405
Speaker 2:  Galaxy Buds Pro, which just fully look like AirPods and AirPods Pro.

128
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:02,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

129
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:05,325
Speaker 5:  They used to look like little beans. Yeah. And they were kind of cool.

130
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:09,285
Speaker 5:  Like I wouldn't buy them, but they were kind of cool. And now they look like

131
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,685
Speaker 5:  AirPod pros. Air Pods just,

132
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:14,965
Speaker 2:  Well they, they're, they're the stems. They they got stems. They're a little

133
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:18,725
Speaker 2:  bit more angular. They do have LEDs on them. Yep. Which I, i is

134
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:21,485
Speaker 2:  where has listeners know I appreciate more than almost any other thing You

135
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:22,125
Speaker 2:  can add to your tech pod.

136
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You know, what you want is LEDs right next to your ear canal where

137
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,485
Speaker 4:  you'll see them all the time. It makes perfect sense

138
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,285
Speaker 5:  Where everyone else can too. You're

139
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:32,725
Speaker 2:  Right. I think people should be be like that dude's listening to tunes.

140
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:37,805
Speaker 5:  You should just know that only if it like pulses with their music. Yeah.

141
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:38,645
Speaker 4:  You want like RGB

142
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,925
Speaker 2:  Lighting for your ear basically. Where is the party speaker effects for these

143
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:44,365
Speaker 2:  headphones so no one else can see them and you can't,

144
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:47,285
Speaker 2:  no one else can hear what you're listening to and you can't see the lights.

145
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,605
Speaker 2:  That's the place for party speaker LEDs. So, you know, we're

146
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,925
Speaker 2:  at this weird place in headphone V where

147
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:59,285
Speaker 2:  the best headphones to buy for your phone are often the one that

148
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:03,085
Speaker 2:  the phone maker makes. Yes. Because they have all co-opted

149
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:06,885
Speaker 2:  Bluetooth as a standard and built proprietary features for their own

150
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:10,205
Speaker 2:  products. We can do this forever. They've all done it. Like whether or not

151
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:12,485
Speaker 2:  you think that's good or bad, they have all done it. Apple has done it with

152
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,725
Speaker 2:  the AirPods where they use Bluetooth, but then there's a bunch of proprietary

153
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:18,405
Speaker 2:  features Samsung has done with the Galaxy buds. Google has done it with pixel

154
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:22,285
Speaker 2:  Buds just down the line. Everyone's approach to this is if you

155
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:25,765
Speaker 2:  want the coolest stuff, you have to buy our proprietary earbuds.

156
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,485
Speaker 2:  And if God help you, if you want to use the Galaxy Buds with an iPhone, they're,

157
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,085
Speaker 2:  they're just gonna fall back to Bluetooth. Yeah. So if you're a Galaxy owner,

158
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:36,645
Speaker 2:  like if you have a Samsung phone, I think the question is whether you want

159
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,405
Speaker 2:  to advertise it with the stuff in your ears.

160
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:44,045
Speaker 4:  Well, I say it slightly differently. I I think if you're Samsung, there is

161
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,845
Speaker 4:  a perfectly reasonable set of decisions you make to land on.

162
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:51,525
Speaker 4:  We should just make AirPods, which is, they, they

163
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,085
Speaker 4:  cited the evidence and there is some evidence out there that that basic

164
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:59,325
Speaker 4:  shape is actually more comfortable for more people with

165
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:02,845
Speaker 4:  the, the stem. It balances the weight, it also points a microphone towards

166
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:06,045
Speaker 4:  your mouth instead of the microphone just sort of pointing out to the side

167
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:09,365
Speaker 4:  of your head, which a lot of these things do. But also

168
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:13,605
Speaker 4:  I, I'm curious if you guys feel this way, but in, in my circle

169
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:17,685
Speaker 4:  at least, there is AirPods and there is knockoff AirPods. And that is,

170
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:20,925
Speaker 4:  that is the perception of wireless headphones. Everybody knows what AirPods

171
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:24,365
Speaker 4:  are and then all the other ones are like, oh, those aren't AirPods. And I

172
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,525
Speaker 4:  feel like if you're Samsung you're like, okay, well we want something that

173
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,485
Speaker 4:  integrates and if it happens to at a

174
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:33,525
Speaker 4:  glance look like AirPods and so people think they're AirPods, that's actually

175
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:36,605
Speaker 4:  not the worst thing in the world. And I think like, maybe it is that simple.

176
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:39,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, I I think we're saying the same thing in slightly different ways.

177
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:43,365
Speaker 2:  Like do you want your headphones to advertise they're not from Apple

178
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:46,365
Speaker 2:  and that means you don't have an iPhone. I

179
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:50,045
Speaker 4:  Think a lot of companies have killed themselves trying to differentiate from

180
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:50,245
Speaker 4:  Apple.

181
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:55,405
Speaker 4:  We are not, apple turns out to be like a pretty bad branding exercise most

182
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:56,085
Speaker 4:  of the time. And I

183
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:59,045
Speaker 5:  Don't think, I don't think Samsung's ever done that. They've always kind

184
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:02,885
Speaker 5:  of been like, yeah, we're Apple, but for Android, like, oh, you live in any

185
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:05,845
Speaker 5:  other part of the world where Apple doesn't make sense or it's too expensive

186
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:06,165
Speaker 5:  or whatever.

187
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:10,245
Speaker 2:  No Samsung waxes and wanes on it. Does the We are not Apple does. I agree

188
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:13,285
Speaker 2:  with that. But there have been times of maximum, we are not Apple from Samsung

189
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:15,285
Speaker 2:  and I think this is a low point.

190
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:15,885
Speaker 5:  It's pretty strong. Yeah.

191
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:19,965
Speaker 2:  Like this is very much a low point in Samsung's like, are we totally differentiated?

192
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:23,965
Speaker 2:  Like every, for years they had bigger phones and they were just

193
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:27,205
Speaker 2:  like, they were making the ads that, you know, people stand in line for the

194
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,845
Speaker 2:  iPhone and then someone would come by with like a surfboard sized St. Samsung

195
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:30,285
Speaker 2:  phone.

196
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:36,165
Speaker 2:  So the point that that that marketing actually worked against Apple, it came

197
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:39,405
Speaker 2:  up in various lawsuits that like Apple executives were saying like

198
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:43,525
Speaker 2:  Samsung's branding was causing market share

199
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:47,405
Speaker 2:  loss. Like very famous. Like Phil Show was like screaming at Apple's ad agency

200
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:50,285
Speaker 2:  because that was working and it turned out it was just the screens were bigger

201
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:52,885
Speaker 2:  and people love big cheap screens. And then Apple was like, here's the iPhone

202
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:54,530
Speaker 2:  six, six. and it just stopped being a problem.

203
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:58,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, and it, it's worth pointing out that all of this is incredibly

204
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:02,365
Speaker 4:  cyclical, right? Like Apple spends most of its time building features into

205
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:06,045
Speaker 4:  the iPhone that already exist on Android devices. Apple got bigger

206
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:09,445
Speaker 4:  phones way after the whole Android universe. It like everybody is just

207
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:13,045
Speaker 4:  perpetually shoving towards each other at all times. Yeah. It's just

208
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:16,685
Speaker 4:  particularly jarring when you see it in

209
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:20,605
Speaker 4:  something as simple a shape as these headphones. 'cause it's not just

210
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:23,365
Speaker 4:  like a slab of glass in the way that all phones are a slab of glass. There

211
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:26,845
Speaker 4:  are a lot of shapes that headphones can be. And I don't know that there is

212
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:30,765
Speaker 4:  necessarily like a perfect correct way for headphones to

213
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:34,645
Speaker 4:  be, but we've just decided that AirPods are the thing. And it's very

214
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:37,525
Speaker 4:  clear that Samsung looked at it and said, AirPods are the thing. And the

215
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:40,125
Speaker 4:  best smartest thing we can do is just make AirPods.

216
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:43,725
Speaker 2:  I'm just gonna point out that the shapes of headphones, the designs of headphones,

217
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:47,125
Speaker 2:  the sound quality of headphones, all much more varied and competitive.

218
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:51,085
Speaker 2:  When the headphones Jack was still on phones, just just gonna say it out

219
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:53,925
Speaker 2:  loud, when there was an open interconnect that allowed for high quality audio

220
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:57,245
Speaker 2:  to pass from your device to the headphones, the variability in the market,

221
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:01,605
Speaker 2:  the variability in styles was, was real. It was big.

222
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,445
Speaker 4:  Also, as someone for whom AirPods don't feel great in my ears, it's a real

223
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,525
Speaker 4:  bummer that this is what we've decided. Yeah,

224
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:10,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So we'll see there, there's the, there's the two sides on the Galaxy

225
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:13,565
Speaker 2:  Buds. There's the pro which are in ears, and then there's the regular ones

226
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:16,845
Speaker 2:  which are more air potty, which are like, just shove it. They

227
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:17,485
Speaker 4:  Just hang. Yeah.

228
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:20,605
Speaker 2:  They're just like in there, you know, we gotta do the tests, we gotta try

229
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:23,485
Speaker 2:  'em out. I I'm, I'm always curious to see if anybody's actually managed to

230
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:27,325
Speaker 2:  make Bluetooth call audio sound good. Here in

231
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:30,565
Speaker 2:  New York City, the number of people who use wired headphones all day long,

232
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:33,365
Speaker 2:  it, it feels like it's just going up. Yep. I think people are just like over

233
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:36,725
Speaker 2:  it, which is interesting. But that's New York. It's not everywhere. So we'll

234
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:40,205
Speaker 2:  see. We're gonna review the things. The other major Yep. You just made an

235
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:43,405
Speaker 2:  Apple product is the Galaxy Watch Ultra. This

236
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:45,765
Speaker 4:  I think is actually the worst offender of the group.

237
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:46,685
Speaker 5:  It's so bad.

238
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean it's called, first of all, it's called the Ultra. They've added

239
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:53,605
Speaker 2:  the icons, like the menu switcher dealie, the home screen

240
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:57,605
Speaker 2:  is the Apple Watch home screen. They even launched it with an orange band

241
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,325
Speaker 4:  And a quick button

242
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:02,885
Speaker 2:  And a quick button, which is orange. The colors are the same.

243
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,445
Speaker 2:  Weird, just weird all around.

244
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:09,605
Speaker 5:  It's yeah, it's just like a full on copy.

245
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:13,765
Speaker 5:  Right? Like the, I think the only, it feels like the only really big difference

246
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:17,845
Speaker 5:  is the Squirkle shape, which I absolutely hate that word and

247
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:20,365
Speaker 5:  want it to die. Yes. Agreed. But our And

248
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:21,725
Speaker 4:  The crown doesn't turn

249
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,645
Speaker 5:  And the crown doesn't

250
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:24,085
Speaker 4:  Turn. Well it does, but it doesn't scroll.

251
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:28,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Which sure like, the, the fact that it doesn't scroll, but it

252
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:31,045
Speaker 5:  turns is just like mind boggling to me.

253
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:35,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I just, I don't know, I'm, I'm so torn on this yet again because

254
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:38,685
Speaker 4:  I think on the one hand what we've learned in the last couple of years is

255
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:42,485
Speaker 4:  that Apple got the watch ultra really right. In a lot of ways,

256
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:46,325
Speaker 4:  right? Like it, it went super hard on this idea that this is a thing

257
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:48,925
Speaker 4:  for people who are going to use it aggressively outdoors. So we're gonna

258
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:52,965
Speaker 4:  optimize for battery life, we're gonna give you extra information about how

259
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:56,885
Speaker 4:  you're doing. We're gonna add some like GP sy stuff into it. We're gonna

260
00:14:56,885 --> 00:15:00,765
Speaker 4:  make it more rugged for you to do more rugged things. And all of that has,

261
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:04,605
Speaker 4:  I think largely proven right, but has also just proven

262
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:08,325
Speaker 4:  popular. Like there are a lot of people, including a lot of people who don't

263
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:11,965
Speaker 4:  need all of that stuff here I am who wear ultras, right?

264
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,125
Speaker 4:  And, and so I think if you're part of me is like,

265
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:20,205
Speaker 4:  it's, it's a real sort of abdication of like creative responsibility for

266
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:24,165
Speaker 4:  Samsung to not find something more interesting to do. But also it, it looked

267
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:28,085
Speaker 4:  around and it was like, oh no Apple, apple maybe just got this one right?

268
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:31,765
Speaker 4:  And maybe we'll just go do that and build it into Samsung e stuff because

269
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:36,045
Speaker 4:  ultimately that's what people are asking us for, right? Like the thing

270
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:39,845
Speaker 4:  you hear all the time is like, where is the Apple watch for Samsung?

271
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,565
Speaker 4:  and it has like steadily moved towards that and this just feels like they

272
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:47,085
Speaker 4:  just went the hallway and we're like, you know what? Screw it. The Apple

273
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:49,125
Speaker 4:  Watch alter is pretty good. Let's do it. But

274
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:53,085
Speaker 2:  I want to say one thing, there's one very important differentiator

275
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,925
Speaker 2:  here. It is vastly unclear.

276
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The Squirkle,

277
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:02,605
Speaker 2:  It's not even the Squirkle, it's like got a round face on a squirl body with

278
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:06,005
Speaker 2:  like a weird, the weird touch ring that they do.

279
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,205
Speaker 4:  It's one too many bezels.

280
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:12,125
Speaker 2:  It's a chunk, it's a chunk in a way that the ultra is a trunk, but the

281
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:16,005
Speaker 2:  ultra feels like a singular idea. And this is just

282
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,765
Speaker 2:  like Yeah. One too many bezels. Yeah.

283
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:20,885
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's, it's likes a case inside of a case, inside of a case in

284
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:24,205
Speaker 4:  a way that just feels tacky. Yeah.

285
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:29,325
Speaker 4:  I do sort of like some of the color combinations. Like

286
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:33,165
Speaker 4:  if you, the, some of the pictures we've seen with some of the

287
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:37,125
Speaker 4:  like really aggressive like information dense watch faces,

288
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:40,725
Speaker 4:  you look at them and it's like, okay, there's a certain amount of like, I

289
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:44,445
Speaker 4:  could control a smart city from my watch with this and like,

290
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:48,565
Speaker 4:  could I be Batman with this watch on? Like, potentially. But it is,

291
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:52,405
Speaker 4:  it is. I think it, it feels it's either over designed or under

292
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:54,765
Speaker 4:  designed and I genuinely can't tell which one it's does

293
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:58,805
Speaker 5:  Does the screen feel like too much screen to y'all in a way that the

294
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,445
Speaker 5:  See, I feel the way with the Ultra does the Apple, yeah, the Apple Ultra

295
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:05,285
Speaker 5:  I feel doesn't quite scream screen at me as much as this does,

296
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:07,045
Speaker 5:  but I have neither, so I don't,

297
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:10,205
Speaker 4:  I I think the ultra is too much screen. I think they're both too much screen.

298
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:13,445
Speaker 4:  Like anytime I'm around somebody with an ultra both, dear God, you're right.

299
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:17,645
Speaker 4:  Anytime I'm around somebody with an Apple Watch Ultra, I'm like, I

300
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:21,405
Speaker 4:  can just sit here and read your email. Like you get a text message. It's

301
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:25,125
Speaker 4:  like we both got that text message, like it's just, it's a lot of screen

302
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:28,845
Speaker 4:  and this, this is I think very clearly gonna be the same thing. But

303
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:32,445
Speaker 4:  people seem to be fine with that. Like I guess that's just a thing we're

304
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:33,125
Speaker 4:  getting comfortable with.

305
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:37,285
Speaker 2:  There is some other Samsung stuff here in that,

306
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:42,165
Speaker 2:  you know, Samsung is just a weird company with weird ideas and they

307
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,325
Speaker 2:  like to be ahead of the curve. So they've added like

308
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:50,125
Speaker 2:  new sensors for health stuff and the, the best part is that

309
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:53,845
Speaker 2:  the, they call it the bioactive sensor and they're like, what if we just

310
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:57,565
Speaker 2:  add more colors of LEDs to the sensor and measure more things. And the the

311
00:17:57,725 --> 00:18:01,525
Speaker 2:  funniest one here is like no one can quite do

312
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:06,085
Speaker 2:  the blood sugar measurement, which everyone wants to do. Like apple's struggled

313
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,045
Speaker 2:  with it. Samsung is obviously struggling with it, but like there's a lot

314
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:12,245
Speaker 2:  of people out there who would love an ongoing blood sugar measurement. Yeah.

315
00:18:12,305 --> 00:18:15,965
Speaker 2:  For a variety of reasons. So they've just added something called the

316
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:19,685
Speaker 2:  experimental advanced glycation end products index metric,

317
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:20,165
Speaker 4:  Which

318
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,325
Speaker 5:  Is nothing to do. Hold on,

319
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:22,525
Speaker 4:  Hold on. Say that one more time. One more time.

320
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:26,645
Speaker 2:  The experimental advanced glycation end products.

321
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:27,565
Speaker 2:  Index metric.

322
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:32,685
Speaker 4:  It sounds like a like third rate stock exchange.

323
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:37,445
Speaker 2:  That's a pretty stock, it's an index of everyone's blood sugar is what it

324
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:41,405
Speaker 2:  is. It's like I ate a cookie. The A GEI went

325
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:41,645
Speaker 2:  down,

326
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:48,205
Speaker 2:  but so it's not it's not, yeah, it's not supposed to be that.

327
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:50,845
Speaker 2:  It's, you were not supposed to read at that. But Samsung says it looks at

328
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:54,365
Speaker 2:  your diet and lifecycle to reflect your overall biological

329
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,565
Speaker 2:  aging process, which is worse.

330
00:18:57,235 --> 00:19:00,845
Speaker 5:  There's so much, it's like, who's the billionaire that's just slowly turning

331
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:01,805
Speaker 5:  himself younger?

332
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:06,045
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah, yeah. This the Vapi blood guy Peter Thiel is like, I gotta get this

333
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:06,565
Speaker 2:  Samsung, go

334
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,325
Speaker 5:  Watch all trucks. Like why I need this immediately. But no one else

335
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:13,005
Speaker 2:  Does. But this is, this is the differentiation in this market. Like

336
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:17,125
Speaker 2:  everyone figured out watches are either you want a big screen 'cause you

337
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,605
Speaker 2:  have a big screen like me, or you want all these health and fitness features,

338
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:24,365
Speaker 2:  or maybe you just want notifications and two factor codes.

339
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:28,965
Speaker 2:  But at the high end it's all health and fitness. Yep. Like that's what sells

340
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:32,405
Speaker 2:  the extra watch features to people. There's a reason that new health

341
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,685
Speaker 2:  specific features are not coming out at a high rate. Like one the tech isn't

342
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:39,525
Speaker 2:  quite there. Two, there's a bunch of regulatory hurdles. Three, they have

343
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,925
Speaker 2:  to make sure they're actually safe and say what they say they're gonna do.

344
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,605
Speaker 2:  Great. That means you, you end up with like fake like wellness

345
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:51,965
Speaker 2:  health features, like the advanced experimental,

346
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:55,565
Speaker 2:  the like the experimental advanced glycation end products result. and it's

347
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:59,405
Speaker 2:  fine, but there's always the danger that people take that stuff

348
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:02,845
Speaker 2:  way more seriously than they should. Yeah. Just like 10 th like people take

349
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:06,125
Speaker 2:  10,000 steps very seriously and like that just made up

350
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:10,745
Speaker 2:  like people just made that up and like here we are and like

351
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:14,345
Speaker 2:  there's a piece of this puzzle where I think these watches are gonna end

352
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:17,665
Speaker 2:  up being more samey because the thing that ultimately differentiates them

353
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,625
Speaker 2:  is kind of caught up in a lull of innovation and

354
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:23,465
Speaker 2:  regulatory behavior and all that stuff.

355
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:27,625
Speaker 4:  And famously like aggressive lawsuits against Apple from other

356
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:31,145
Speaker 4:  companies. No, I think that's right. And there's the, what was it, the, is

357
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:34,465
Speaker 4:  it the health score? Is that what Samsung calls it? This this like all in

358
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,225
Speaker 4:  one tracking thing that they're doing with the watches to basically

359
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:41,145
Speaker 4:  give you sort of an overall picture of your score. But

360
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,985
Speaker 5:  Like everybody's doing that right now, right?

361
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,665
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But I think it, it fits exactly what you're talking about neli. That

362
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:49,445
Speaker 4:  it's, it's the sort of thing that as a, as a

363
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:53,085
Speaker 4:  very casual data point is helpful, right? Where it's like, okay,

364
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:56,405
Speaker 4:  like I was just looking at this weather app, it's called lazy weather and

365
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:00,045
Speaker 4:  its whole job is to tell you is it going to be warmer or colder than yesterday?

366
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,165
Speaker 4:  Right? Like based on the assumption that like that's actually all you really

367
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:07,045
Speaker 4:  need to know. And that is to that extent a

368
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:10,605
Speaker 4:  health score is useful, right? It's like am I, am I, am I better or worse?

369
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:13,885
Speaker 4:  Like how, how am I doing? And that's like it gives you that answer. But all

370
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:17,685
Speaker 4:  these things, as we get more of these sensors and more of this data, all

371
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:21,645
Speaker 4:  you're actually doing is giving people tools they don't understand with

372
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:25,605
Speaker 4:  which to do things that may or may not be helpful. and it feels

373
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:29,245
Speaker 4:  like we are so deep down the road of like here's some numbers without

374
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,525
Speaker 4:  giving people real ability to like do things with

375
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:33,725
Speaker 4:  them.

376
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:37,685
Speaker 5:  Well and this age index in particular feels like it is trying to

377
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,725
Speaker 5:  ride on the like ride the wave of continuous glucose monitors. It's trying

378
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:46,325
Speaker 5:  to sound like, oh yeah we kind of care about glucose monitors and and

379
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:49,925
Speaker 5:  diabetes and all of that. But also we can't legally do any of that because

380
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,925
Speaker 5:  none of that actual technology exists in a safe way. So

381
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:56,605
Speaker 2:  It should be clear, Samsung would not explain what the experimental

382
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:58,845
Speaker 2:  advanced glycation end products index is.

383
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:02,525
Speaker 5:  I was reading up on it all like as soon as I saw that word, I've been very

384
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:05,445
Speaker 5:  into continuous glucose monitors right now 'cause I've got a diabetic in

385
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:09,325
Speaker 5:  the family and as soon as I saw that I was like, what is that metric?

386
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:13,245
Speaker 5:  That's not the one I talk with the doctors about. Yeah. And just immediately

387
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:16,725
Speaker 5:  was like, oh this is, oh I don't wanna say bullshit, but like

388
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:19,885
Speaker 5:  close to it. Right?

389
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:23,725
Speaker 2:  All, all Samsung will say, just to repeat this, all

390
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:27,405
Speaker 2:  Samsung will say is that it looks at quote your diet and lifestyle

391
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:29,965
Speaker 2:  to reflect your overall biological aging process.

392
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:35,205
Speaker 2:  Sure. This is why I'm happy to announce a line of Vergecast supplements

393
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:38,165
Speaker 2:  which will bring your biological age lower.

394
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:44,845
Speaker 2:  Well if I only, if I had 10% more grift in my body

395
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:48,765
Speaker 2:  June spot out to the lightning round ho for lightning round sponsorships,

396
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:49,765
Speaker 2:  you,

397
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,005
Speaker 4:  You're by the way, supplements

398
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:53,885
Speaker 2:  Would do way, we, we will not allow supplement companies to advertise the

399
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:56,245
Speaker 2:  lightning round. I'm I'm putting that out there. Unless the price tag is

400
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:57,005
Speaker 2:  high enough price

401
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,125
Speaker 4:  Unless they're like really good supplements

402
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:01,245
Speaker 2:  Unless they rule. Yeah.

403
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:04,325
Speaker 4:  But no, I mean I think even the, one of the big things Samsung announced

404
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:08,005
Speaker 4:  with these watches is that they have FDA de Novo

405
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:10,845
Speaker 4:  clearance for sleep apnea stuff. Yeah. And that's another really good example,

406
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:14,525
Speaker 4:  right? Because what that doesn't mean is that this will tell you if you have

407
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:18,445
Speaker 4:  sleep apnea. It's very hard to not understand it as that.

408
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,925
Speaker 4:  But that is not what this is. What it means is this is

409
00:23:22,645 --> 00:23:26,605
Speaker 4:  a, a device that will give you data that is not harmful and potentially

410
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:30,685
Speaker 4:  interesting and that you should take that data and take it to a medical professional

411
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:34,645
Speaker 4:  who can help you make sense of it. And that is kind of indicative of

412
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:38,565
Speaker 4:  like the best of most smart watches. And this is true of Apple and Google

413
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:42,605
Speaker 4:  and basically everybody in this space right now that they're all so

414
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:46,485
Speaker 4:  careful to remind you constantly like these are not medical devices, this

415
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:50,365
Speaker 4:  is not medical advice. These things are just indicated as ways to give

416
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:54,045
Speaker 4:  you information that might be helpful in a certain context and you should

417
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:56,605
Speaker 4:  take it to your healthcare provider and consult with them like over and over

418
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:59,125
Speaker 4:  and over. That's the thing. But what it's actually doing is it's gonna pop

419
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,205
Speaker 4:  up a thing being like, you didn't sleep well. What do you think that's about?

420
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:02,285
Speaker 4:  and it's like,

421
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:03,605
Speaker 2:  Are

422
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:05,925
Speaker 4:  We, what problems are we really solving for people

423
00:24:05,955 --> 00:24:09,845
Speaker 2:  Here? So I come from a family of doctors and they all talk

424
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:13,445
Speaker 2:  about, you know, like there are laws in most states now

425
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:16,645
Speaker 2:  that say you have to have access to your medical records right away. And

426
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:20,565
Speaker 2:  a thing that is real is you go in for tests and then you get the result of

427
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:23,805
Speaker 2:  your test before the doctor gets it. Mm. And then people don't

428
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:28,245
Speaker 2:  wait. They start furiously googling numbers and

429
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:32,125
Speaker 2:  they call the doctors having already formed conclusions and

430
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,965
Speaker 2:  the doctor's like, hold on. You have no idea what you're talking about.

431
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:40,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Apparently I didn't have kidney failure, I just needed to drink more

432
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:40,685
Speaker 5:  water. Yeah.

433
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:44,085
Speaker 2:  This is like a real thing that happens like all the time. Yeah. And I think

434
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:47,485
Speaker 2:  that's fascinating in this context, right? Where you were like, you're just

435
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,285
Speaker 2:  putting on people's wrists for a couple hundred bucks being like, this is

436
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:54,085
Speaker 2:  good at hikes also it will terrify you and I

437
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:57,925
Speaker 2:  I'm saying like the, the bleeding edge of these devices is health features

438
00:24:58,225 --> 00:25:01,405
Speaker 2:  and we're just kind of at a place now where they can't make the real claims.

439
00:25:01,985 --> 00:25:05,845
Speaker 2:  So they're just making up other ones. We'll see how it goes. In

440
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:09,765
Speaker 2:  any case, it looks exactly like an Apple Watch Ultra. Yeah. Except uglier

441
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:11,925
Speaker 2:  in like a real way. All right. I mean so that's the two copies,

442
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:13,805
Speaker 4:  Right? Yeah, yeah.

443
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:17,365
Speaker 2:  Like the, you put in, you put the AirPods through chat GBT, it's spit back

444
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:21,285
Speaker 2:  AirPods with LEDs like done and done. Nailed it. Yeah. Then there's the other

445
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:24,365
Speaker 2:  stuff we should talk about the ring. 'cause the ring is easily the most interesting

446
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:28,205
Speaker 2:  product they have. Yes. and it is the one where a apple has nothing.

447
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:31,645
Speaker 2:  Although we've heard about some attempts, some research projects at that

448
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:35,445
Speaker 2:  company, but there are other, you know, the or ring exists but it seems like

449
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:37,685
Speaker 2:  Samsung is, has a shot here.

450
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think it does because the aura ring is really like, it's kind of

451
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:45,325
Speaker 5:  one size. Most of the other ring makers are kind of like, yeah we do one

452
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:48,565
Speaker 5:  size You can get different sizes of the ring, but ultimately the battery,

453
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:52,525
Speaker 5:  everything else is the same. Samsung is doing what most big tech

454
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:55,565
Speaker 5:  companies do, which is like, we're gonna have multiple sizes. So like the

455
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:58,885
Speaker 5:  largest ones have a little bit more battery than the smaller ones 'cause

456
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:02,885
Speaker 5:  they can put more in it. And that's just cool and smart. But also it

457
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:06,605
Speaker 5:  just sounds a lot like an aura ring with better integration for Samsung

458
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:10,365
Speaker 5:  specifically in a way that's like exciting. And they have smaller ones.

459
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:14,685
Speaker 5:  This is like, I think Victoria Song, our, our wearables writer

460
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:18,685
Speaker 5:  said that this might be one of the s like smallest available smart rings

461
00:26:18,685 --> 00:26:18,965
Speaker 5:  for people.

462
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:22,325
Speaker 2:  It still looks gigantic on her hand. It does in the, but she has,

463
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,805
Speaker 4:  She, she will be the first to tell you she has small hands and is she does

464
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,485
Speaker 4:  a, a super indicative also shout out to V who I believe wore four

465
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:33,605
Speaker 4:  other rings to the HandsOn with the galaxy ring. Like

466
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,885
Speaker 4:  that is, that's,

467
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:37,805
Speaker 2:  That's some straight from Mafi right there just like,

468
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:41,245
Speaker 4:  Like brass knuckles. But it's all smart rings. Like I, hell yeah.

469
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:42,445
Speaker 5:  It's so good.

470
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:45,485
Speaker 2:  I'm either going to a Samsung event or the Jersey Shore. We're gonna find

471
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:49,005
Speaker 2:  out. I might buy the ring sizer 'cause You can just buy

472
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:53,005
Speaker 2:  Samsung's ring sizer for 10 bucks and you figure out what

473
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:56,525
Speaker 2:  your ring size is, which is useful and then you get a credit when you buy

474
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:59,965
Speaker 2:  the ring. I think that's really smart. Like compared to the other, you have

475
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:03,845
Speaker 2:  to wear this on your body. Fitbit and ideas we've seen like Apple making

476
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:07,405
Speaker 2:  you go to the store. Yeah. Like this is actually very clever. It's obviously

477
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:09,605
Speaker 2:  easier with a ring than a thing that you have to wear on your face and wear,

478
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,805
Speaker 2:  you know, prescription lenses and all that with the Vision Pro. But I think

479
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:16,525
Speaker 2:  it's very clever that as we kind of go into wearables

480
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:20,445
Speaker 2:  world fitting stuff to your body becomes an

481
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:23,805
Speaker 2:  interesting challenge and it's not solved. So that, I thought that part was

482
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:27,525
Speaker 2:  really cool, but the part where it's, it's the same product as

483
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:30,245
Speaker 2:  everyone else, but it's more integrated in the system. 'cause Samsung owns

484
00:27:30,245 --> 00:27:33,685
Speaker 2:  the operating system. I I can't, I don't know how I feel about that at all.

485
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:33,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

486
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:38,125
Speaker 5:  Well one thing that is better about it is that it also has like an

487
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,645
Speaker 5:  actual case instead of just a little dongle, you have to periodically find

488
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:45,005
Speaker 5:  and stick the ring on and the case looks

489
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:48,485
Speaker 5:  interesting. Did you guys look at the case for it?

490
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:52,325
Speaker 2:  The the case is, is it gigantic? I can't tell if this case is

491
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:53,325
Speaker 2:  gigantic or not. It

492
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:57,125
Speaker 5:  Feels like gigantic and also so much fake crystal.

493
00:27:57,585 --> 00:27:58,525
Speaker 2:  Yes, yes, yes.

494
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,005
Speaker 4:  It's like a Claire's jewelry case.

495
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I love it so much.

496
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,285
Speaker 4:  I don't mean that as an insult. Like it, it just is what it is. And, and

497
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:10,245
Speaker 4:  it is true that it's better that it is a case than what you get

498
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:13,565
Speaker 4:  from Aura and others, which is essentially just like a puck that sits on

499
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:17,285
Speaker 4:  your desk, which is fine for what it is, but is easy to lose and

500
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:20,885
Speaker 4:  doesn't travel very well. And I think a case that is properly a case makes

501
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:24,845
Speaker 4:  a lot of sense. And I think actually the thing I'm most excited about,

502
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:28,125
Speaker 4:  about the Galaxy ring is that Samsung seems to have gotten

503
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:32,525
Speaker 4:  the ring wearing experience closer to right

504
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:35,485
Speaker 4:  than just about anybody that we've seen. Like the thing is pretty light,

505
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,445
Speaker 4:  it's pretty thin, it's, it's concave, which will make it a little easier

506
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,845
Speaker 4:  to wear and like bang around on a desk and stuff than some of the other sort

507
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:46,725
Speaker 4:  of convex ones that we've seen. It's, it's, it comes in

508
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,685
Speaker 4:  a bunch of different sizes. Like the battery life is long, it seems like

509
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:51,965
Speaker 5:  No additional subscription,

510
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:55,285
Speaker 4:  Right? There are like little bits and pieces of what it's gonna be like to

511
00:28:55,345 --> 00:28:58,845
Speaker 4:  own this that I think are going to be really important because we're still

512
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:02,765
Speaker 4:  very much at a moment where like, unless you are a psycho who wants to

513
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:05,765
Speaker 4:  track their sleep and no shade to those psychos, there's lots of them out

514
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:09,405
Speaker 4:  there. Unless you are that person, there are not a lot of compelling reasons

515
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:13,325
Speaker 4:  to wear a ring. So we have to figure out like

516
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:16,525
Speaker 4:  what, what, what is this thing for? And the smart thing that Samsung did

517
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:19,885
Speaker 4:  is be like, this is gonna be a nice thing to wear before you really have

518
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,005
Speaker 4:  a hundred reasons to use it.

519
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:23,045
Speaker 2:  It's just a bunch of sensors, right? Yeah,

520
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:23,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

521
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:27,645
Speaker 2:  It does heart rate tracking, it does a skin temperature sensor. Ve

522
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:31,445
Speaker 2:  often wondered what my skin temperature is and then it had a bunch of sleep

523
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:32,125
Speaker 2:  features like

524
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:37,125
Speaker 2:  the watch we just had this whole conversation about like they're adding more

525
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,845
Speaker 2:  kinds of sensors to the watch ahead of their ability to actually tell you

526
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:43,165
Speaker 2:  what they mean. It feels like, well we also need a bunch of 'em smaller now

527
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:44,565
Speaker 2:  we can just put 'em in a ring. Well

528
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:48,045
Speaker 4:  They're also better on a ring, right? Like the having that stuff on your

529
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:51,965
Speaker 4:  finger 24 hours a day is a vastly better data collection

530
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:55,485
Speaker 4:  system than having it on your wrist sometimes. Right? Like it if if you are

531
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:58,365
Speaker 4:  the person who wants that data and cares about it and is going to take it

532
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:02,245
Speaker 4:  to your medical professional, a ring is is just a better venue

533
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:06,005
Speaker 4:  for that in almost every way. Yeah. I want smart rings to work.

534
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:07,525
Speaker 4:  Like I really, I really do.

535
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,405
Speaker 2:  If you had a smart ring, would you give up on your watch?

536
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:13,045
Speaker 4:  No, and the reason I don't have a smart ring frankly, is because every time

537
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,685
Speaker 4:  I wear an aura, I wear an aura for three days and I'm like, what on earth

538
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:20,525
Speaker 4:  is the point of me having this thing on? Because I'm not like at,

539
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:24,445
Speaker 4:  at that if you're like a nine or 10 out of 10 on a,

540
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:28,285
Speaker 4:  like how much do I care about tracking my body sensors

541
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:32,325
Speaker 4:  person? A ring is great. I'm not that. And so like

542
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:36,645
Speaker 4:  having it tell me I got bad sleep when I wake up tired is like not

543
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:40,285
Speaker 4:  interesting to me. So I ended up just putting the aura back in a drawer and

544
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:43,845
Speaker 4:  the ring is still, the galaxy ring is is gonna have that same problem too.

545
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:47,485
Speaker 2:  So this brings me to Neil Patel's theory of wearable bullshit. Okay,

546
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:52,725
Speaker 2:  just wanna be clear. So if you remember this, by the way, this theory still

547
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,445
Speaker 2:  needs a better name I'm in the market for, but if you remember

548
00:30:55,715 --> 00:30:58,005
Speaker 4:  It's important that it has NE's name in it though. Yeah,

549
00:30:58,505 --> 00:30:59,405
Speaker 2:  It it's mine.

550
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:08,845
Speaker 2:  That's how You can, You can buy You can I'll sell you naming rights to the

551
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:12,485
Speaker 2:  theory of what wearable bullshit. This is the Samsung Exxon theory of

552
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:15,085
Speaker 2:  wearable bullshit presented by Citibank. There you go.

553
00:31:16,705 --> 00:31:19,485
Speaker 2:  So the the x axis right is

554
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:24,605
Speaker 2:  value and then the Y is fids. Like how much you

555
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:27,805
Speaker 2:  have to care about the thing or it's the other way around, it doesn't matter.

556
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:28,805
Speaker 2:  Those are the two axes.

557
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:32,525
Speaker 4:  Well there's also a z that you refuse to acknowledge, but that's okay.

558
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:36,725
Speaker 2:  Many people have sent us many versions of this chart. Right? And

559
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:40,685
Speaker 2:  so my, my my the paradigm object on

560
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:44,205
Speaker 2:  the chart of things you attach to your body is regular glasses,

561
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,285
Speaker 2:  which are a little bit fiddly. You had to clean 'em, you gotta carry 'em,

562
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:51,165
Speaker 2:  you can't lose them, but they, if you need them, provide you an immense amount

563
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:54,565
Speaker 2:  of value. So you're like, I'm gonna put these on my face all the time.

564
00:31:55,155 --> 00:31:59,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. 'cause they allow me to see and then I will deal with having to clean

565
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,885
Speaker 2:  them and owning a microfiber cloth and all the rest of the stuff that you're

566
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:02,325
Speaker 2:  supposed to do with glasses,

567
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:03,405
Speaker 7:  You just use your shirt.

568
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:07,765
Speaker 2:  Right. That's what, right. Like somewhere on that list is like

569
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:11,685
Speaker 2:  the original Apple Watch, which was too fiddly required a lot of care

570
00:32:11,745 --> 00:32:15,685
Speaker 2:  and didn't do well as a product. Then there's the current Apple Watch,

571
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,525
Speaker 2:  which actually is pretty good bad it life doesn't require a lot of care and

572
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:22,485
Speaker 2:  has a lot of value for people like exceeded the, the, the line.

573
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:26,535
Speaker 2:  Then there's a vision pro, which is very like anything that goes on your

574
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:30,495
Speaker 2:  face, the fids is off the charts and it can't deliver as much value. Yeah.

575
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:33,415
Speaker 2:  Like face computers just can't deliver the value to make this worthwhile.

576
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:36,575
Speaker 2:  Right. You just keep going down and down the list. The ring has a problem

577
00:32:37,315 --> 00:32:41,125
Speaker 2:  in that it delivers no value to you. It is a totally passive computer

578
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:45,285
Speaker 2:  that you have to fiddle with and put on your body. And then

579
00:32:45,385 --> 00:32:49,085
Speaker 2:  all the value that's delivered is like at some later point

580
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:51,645
Speaker 2:  you will look at some data that was collected. Well and

581
00:32:51,645 --> 00:32:55,205
Speaker 4:  I think if you're, if you're the kind of person who has a, like a

582
00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:59,205
Speaker 4:  preexisting thing for which that is useful, great. Like if you

583
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:01,965
Speaker 4:  are someone who knows you struggle with sleep and you're trying things and

584
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:05,525
Speaker 4:  actually collecting that data on an ongoing basis helps you. Great. That

585
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,605
Speaker 4:  makes total sense. A ring is gonna be really useful and the upside of a ring

586
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:12,525
Speaker 4:  is that the FIDS score is much, much lower. Like a thing that you wear

587
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:16,285
Speaker 4:  in your index finger and take off once a week to charge while you shower

588
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:20,685
Speaker 4:  super low on the FIDS meter. But the

589
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:24,605
Speaker 4:  problem is that even its potential to do more stuff is not that high.

590
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:25,085
Speaker 4:  Like I

591
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,805
Speaker 2:  Don't think it's that low on the fids meter. You don't think I I wear a ring

592
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,045
Speaker 2:  every day. Yeah. I I've never think I pick it up when I leave the house.

593
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:35,325
Speaker 2:  It serves an important function, which is

594
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:36,885
Speaker 2:  my ladies that I'm taking. Yeah.

595
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:43,885
Speaker 2:  It's a symbol of my ongoing devotion to my divorce lawyer of a wife

596
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,725
Speaker 2:  and I, I just never think about it. I I take it, I put it on, I take it off.

597
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:53,325
Speaker 2:  I I never think about charging it, whatever. It has a obviously

598
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:57,285
Speaker 2:  important societal emotional function

599
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:01,165
Speaker 2:  that it does. It's like symbolic but there's it's

600
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:05,005
Speaker 2:  zero fit. Like anything over zero is actually the standard.

601
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:05,405
Speaker 2:  I

602
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:09,445
Speaker 5:  I think that is probably only some of our

603
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:12,685
Speaker 5:  audience has that issue. 'cause a lot of their audience probably also enjoys

604
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:16,245
Speaker 5:  to wear a little couple of different rings, replaced rings like I wear.

605
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,325
Speaker 2:  But they're also zero.

606
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:21,365
Speaker 5:  No, because you take, like, I cannot tell you it's jewelry, right? Like jewelry,

607
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:23,765
Speaker 5:  you're, you're constantly, a lot of people are constantly fiddling with their

608
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:24,325
Speaker 5:  jewelry. Do you

609
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:25,605
Speaker 2:  Think Galaxy watches jewelry

610
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:29,925
Speaker 5:  Fundamentally is, it's not jewelry I wanna personally

611
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:30,365
Speaker 5:  wear.

612
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,765
Speaker 2:  Well that, but it doesn't have the function. No,

613
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:36,565
Speaker 5:  It does. It's it's a ring. It's showing, it's it's putting that extra

614
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:39,285
Speaker 5:  bling on your hand. Correct. And I think a lot of people do like to have

615
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,245
Speaker 5:  that extra bling. The

616
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:43,365
Speaker 4:  Aura ring has definitely attained like status, symbol

617
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:45,805
Speaker 4:  status over the years. Yeah.

618
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:49,685
Speaker 5:  It's it's got like a, it's got like a bling kind of quality to it. Yeah.

619
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:53,125
Speaker 5:  And I think the rings in a way like the Apple watch quickly became,

620
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:57,085
Speaker 5:  went from fashion. We all laughed at it being fashion and immediately

621
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:57,565
Speaker 5:  into,

622
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,805
Speaker 2:  But it, it failed as a fashion. Yeah. Famously failed as

623
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:02,085
Speaker 5:  A fashion. Yeah. Famously we were all like, that's stupid. And we all just

624
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:05,485
Speaker 5:  stopped treating it like fashion and it just became a watch on your wrist.

625
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:09,885
Speaker 5:  The ring is still, I think both more capable of it. So if

626
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:12,845
Speaker 5:  you're someone who doesn't wanna have a giant watch on your wrist and you

627
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:15,925
Speaker 5:  do want those metrics, like, okay, You can put on the rig the ring and You

628
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:19,085
Speaker 5:  can still wear your brightling or your Rolex or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Show

629
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:21,485
Speaker 5:  that off. And I think that's who this is for. That's

630
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:21,885
Speaker 2:  The, the market.

631
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:25,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is for like people with $6,000 watches that

632
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,685
Speaker 5:  that they don't wanna replace it.

633
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,645
Speaker 2:  This is why Silicon Valley billionaires love the door.

634
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,485
Speaker 5:  This is, this is my aspirational

635
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:34,725
Speaker 2:  Ring. I I just figured this out. I guess when I say is it jewelry? I agree

636
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:38,525
Speaker 2:  with you that like it's jewelry. Yeah. I meant does it look no

637
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:41,885
Speaker 2:  like jewelry. The aura ring actually they tried very hard to make it look

638
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:45,525
Speaker 2:  like jewelry. Yeah. And one of the only reasons that I

639
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:48,045
Speaker 2:  wouldn't just swap out my wedding ring for it is You can, I think You can

640
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,805
Speaker 2:  only wear it on your index finger, right? Yeah.

641
00:35:49,825 --> 00:35:51,685
Speaker 5:  You're supposed to only wear it on your index. So

642
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:54,245
Speaker 2:  It's it like it doesn't do the other thing. But there's a world and once

643
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:58,085
Speaker 2:  you just infuse my existing jewelry with a tech and it looks good enough

644
00:35:58,085 --> 00:36:01,805
Speaker 2:  and that's fine. I think that the Samsung one doesn't, doesn't.

645
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:02,245
Speaker 2:  But wait,

646
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:05,605
Speaker 4:  The ne the Neli Patel theory of wearable bullshit does not have a fashion

647
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:06,645
Speaker 4:  scale.

648
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:07,885
Speaker 5:  That's the Z axis. Now

649
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:10,285
Speaker 4:  You've, you've Yeah. This is, this is about fids

650
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:12,285
Speaker 2:  And those, those are same

651
00:36:12,285 --> 00:36:12,365
Speaker 4:  Thing.

652
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:14,685
Speaker 2:  Do you know what's very, if you wanna attach

653
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:16,045
Speaker 4:  A computer, NELI.

654
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:20,165
Speaker 2:  All right, look, I can

655
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:20,525
Speaker 4:  Make this

656
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:22,645
Speaker 2:  Work man work. I need to think about this for like five more seconds and

657
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:23,405
Speaker 2:  I'll come up with something.

658
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:30,085
Speaker 4:  But No, but I, I, I really think the problem is the, the

659
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:33,965
Speaker 4:  ceiling for what You can do with a ring right now seems really

660
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,925
Speaker 4:  low because like, even, even like the next thing you think of is like, oh,

661
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:41,805
Speaker 4:  maybe it'll vibrate for notifications. Do you know how insane it would feel

662
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:45,725
Speaker 4:  to have your, the base of your index finger vibrate every time you get

663
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:46,765
Speaker 4:  a text message? Like

664
00:36:47,145 --> 00:36:47,565
Speaker 2:  Insane

665
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:48,445
Speaker 4:  Disaster

666
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:49,845
Speaker 5:  You'd go to your doctor.

667
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:53,005
Speaker 2:  Exactly. It'd be like, I have all of this medical information

668
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,565
Speaker 4:  And Samsung is doing a thing where they're like sort of

669
00:36:57,945 --> 00:37:01,485
Speaker 4:  gently pointing it like maybe this is a way to gesture control some stuff.

670
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,565
Speaker 4:  Like they have a little bit of

671
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,125
Speaker 2:  A pinchy

672
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,005
Speaker 4:  Pinch, pinchy pinch stuff going on, but only

673
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,605
Speaker 2:  If you have a Samsung phone. Right.

674
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:10,565
Speaker 4:  And so there's like, but even that is like probab

675
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:13,205
Speaker 4:  probably not. I just don't think that's the thing yet.

676
00:37:13,435 --> 00:37:17,325
Speaker 5:  What if, I mean we're hearing a lot more about XR nowadays and

677
00:37:17,745 --> 00:37:21,525
Speaker 5:  And if you is like mixed reality. That's just another word for mixed

678
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:25,485
Speaker 5:  reality and what if that's a like kind of their way

679
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:27,605
Speaker 5:  of this is how we're gonna control it in the future. I

680
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:31,365
Speaker 4:  Do think if, if you wanna like Galaxy Brain, take the galaxy ring.

681
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:32,725
Speaker 4:  I think that's probably,

682
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,045
Speaker 5:  I, that's all I want to

683
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:36,805
Speaker 4:  Do. Also, I just realized if Samsung comes out with a headset and doesn't

684
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:38,605
Speaker 4:  call it the Galaxy Brain, I'm gonna be furious.

685
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:41,325
Speaker 2:  Or its entire AI service suite

686
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:41,965
Speaker 4:  Should

687
00:37:41,965 --> 00:37:45,005
Speaker 2:  Be called Galaxy Brain. Galaxy Brain. How did we have this idea?

688
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:49,405
Speaker 2:  David Pierce's Galaxy Brain You can have one. Yeah. God.

689
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:53,205
Speaker 2:  Alright, we're, we're gonna try out the ring VI think V is very excited to

690
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:56,405
Speaker 2:  get it. We'll we'll know much more about it soon. The last piece we should

691
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:58,805
Speaker 2:  talk about are some phones. I just

692
00:37:58,805 --> 00:38:01,685
Speaker 4:  Wanna point out that we're almost 40 minutes into this segment just now talking

693
00:38:01,685 --> 00:38:04,245
Speaker 4:  about the phones, which actually tells you every single thing you need to

694
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:05,165
Speaker 4:  know about these new phones.

695
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:06,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, they're more expensive.

696
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:11,245
Speaker 4:  I'm so disappointed in these new phones. Like of all the things like

697
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:15,405
Speaker 4:  I can understand why you would copy Apple in making certain things. I can

698
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:19,085
Speaker 4:  understand why you go all in on AI even before there are a lot of really

699
00:38:19,085 --> 00:38:22,845
Speaker 4:  compelling use cases. But this thing where Samsung was so far

700
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:26,885
Speaker 4:  ahead in foldable phones and Flip phones and seems content to

701
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:30,725
Speaker 4:  just like squander that in the name of making everything a smidge better

702
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:33,885
Speaker 4:  and not doing anything new or interesting every year is really starting to

703
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:34,365
Speaker 4:  bum me out.

704
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:37,965
Speaker 5:  Well do they have competition in this space? Like is there anybody that's

705
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:38,565
Speaker 5:  actually pushing

706
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,965
Speaker 2:  Well, so there, there are, we should talk about the Motorola Razor plus,

707
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:45,765
Speaker 2:  which Allison reviewed this week. Yeah. Which she loved. She just

708
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:46,165
Speaker 2:  loved it.

709
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:49,565
Speaker 4:  That thing is one very good camera away from maybe being the best Android

710
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:50,405
Speaker 4:  phone. Yeah.

711
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:55,205
Speaker 2:  Also, it's got a weird processor. It's like who even can

712
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:58,565
Speaker 2:  describe the Snapdragon eight s 3M or whatever it's called.

713
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:03,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Wait, let me find it. What is it I'm trying to find. It's the

714
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:07,005
Speaker 2:  Snapdragon eight s gen three, which is just a weird mid-tier rolls

715
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:10,645
Speaker 2:  processor. Yeah, it's weird. It's it's just a weird,

716
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,805
Speaker 2:  it's one of those where like, will this one last two years or five? Like

717
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:14,405
Speaker 2:  who, who knows? Right?

718
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:18,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Allison called it like an entry flagship, which is like Sure. Alright,

719
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:19,525
Speaker 2:  Here we are.

720
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:24,925
Speaker 2:  Anyways, talk about the Samsung ones first. The flip six

721
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:28,005
Speaker 2:  is the one that you know is sort of more interesting. 'cause I think that

722
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:30,925
Speaker 2:  form factor is more interesting also. It's the thing that's changing the

723
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:34,525
Speaker 2:  most. Like those are the phones that are changing the most. 'cause the cover

724
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:38,445
Speaker 2:  screens are getting bigger and bigger. Yeah. But it, it's basically just

725
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:40,805
Speaker 2:  like a little bit lighter and costs more money.

726
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:42,325
Speaker 5:  Mm Yeah.

727
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:44,925
Speaker 4:  Also a little more rugged, which is meaningful, especially for the flip.

728
00:39:45,475 --> 00:39:48,925
Speaker 4:  They're, they're getting better at making that thing into like an actual

729
00:39:48,925 --> 00:39:50,725
Speaker 4:  phone that You can treat like an actual phone

730
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:52,565
Speaker 5:  A little bit more, right?

731
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:53,285
Speaker 4:  A little,

732
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:56,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Like it doesn't even have dust resistance. Like don't do not

733
00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:57,285
Speaker 5:  take this to

734
00:39:57,285 --> 00:39:59,885
Speaker 4:  The desert. But listen, You can, You can drop it in the toilet. Now that's

735
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:00,085
Speaker 4:  a victory.

736
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:01,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

737
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:03,205
Speaker 4:  That's true. You can drop your phone in the toilet and it'll probably be

738
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:03,365
Speaker 4:  fine.

739
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,965
Speaker 2:  And then the, the Fold six, boy I couldn't tell you,

740
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:12,925
Speaker 4:  It's literally like one of the main features they talked about is

741
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:16,605
Speaker 4:  that when it's flat it's flatter. Like what, what are we doing here?

742
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:18,405
Speaker 2:  It's

743
00:40:18,405 --> 00:40:21,485
Speaker 4:  Just, and again, i i part of me wonders like

744
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:25,885
Speaker 4:  what are, are we several physics miracles away

745
00:40:25,885 --> 00:40:29,605
Speaker 4:  from there being a new thing You can do here because Samsung is

746
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:33,685
Speaker 4:  making little bits of this better. The the cover screen, the, it's, it's

747
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:36,165
Speaker 4:  a little wider on the outside, which I actually appreciate. It feels less

748
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:39,365
Speaker 4:  like a TV remote and more like a phone. It's

749
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:43,885
Speaker 4:  just the same thing though. Like the, the Samsung is not even really

750
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:47,645
Speaker 4:  like coming up with really cool new ideas about how the software here could

751
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,485
Speaker 4:  work. Which at least Motorola is pushing really hard for how do we make the

752
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:54,245
Speaker 4:  outer screen useful and the inner screen useful and have them interplay with

753
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:58,205
Speaker 4:  each other really well. Samsung feels like it is just not pushing

754
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:02,045
Speaker 4:  that nearly as hard. And so it's like, what, what, what is the case for

755
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,765
Speaker 4:  why I should buy these things? Samsung.

756
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:05,525
Speaker 5:  I don't think they care.

757
00:41:06,485 --> 00:41:06,605
Speaker 4:  I

758
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:08,365
Speaker 2:  Mean presumably they'd like me to buy their phones.

759
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:08,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

760
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:11,605
Speaker 5:  I think they want us to buy the phones, but, but I think they're, Samsung

761
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,565
Speaker 5:  often feels driven by, by external pressures. It often feels

762
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:18,405
Speaker 5:  driven by the market and like it's decisions are based in the market and

763
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:21,045
Speaker 5:  like, oh, we do the folding phone 'cause nobody else is doing it. And we

764
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,085
Speaker 5:  get there first and we get there before Apple. And Apple just

765
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:28,845
Speaker 5:  hasn't done it, hasn't even talked about doing it. The rumors are are

766
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:32,605
Speaker 5:  scanned. Right. And so, and that's their primary competitor. Like we wanna

767
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:36,205
Speaker 5:  say boat roller or Pixel or whatever. Let's be real, their primary competitor

768
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:39,405
Speaker 5:  is Apple. And if Apple's not doing anything in this space, then

769
00:41:40,185 --> 00:41:43,605
Speaker 5:  why should they invest in making the phone better when they can just rest

770
00:41:43,605 --> 00:41:44,325
Speaker 5:  on their laurels?

771
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,485
Speaker 2:  Well I think also we, we've Alex you mentioned Saturday Samsung.

772
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Their sales are down, they're trying to make more money.

773
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:52,165
Speaker 5:  Saturday Samsung man

774
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:56,005
Speaker 2:  Is a thing. They, their efforts are going to marketing

775
00:41:56,905 --> 00:42:00,445
Speaker 2:  and more dollars from the same product. Like of course they're not putting

776
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:04,165
Speaker 2:  tons of money into making like changing things too much at the same time.

777
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:09,045
Speaker 2:  Like they still employ the software engineers and designers like they Yeah.

778
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:13,405
Speaker 2:  Make it more interesting as like a, a totally valid critique here. Like yeah,

779
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:16,845
Speaker 2:  the phone opens You, can you have a little phone that turns into a big phone?

780
00:42:17,395 --> 00:42:21,165
Speaker 2:  What happens then? Right. Yeah. And that, that seems to be set aside. So

781
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:24,725
Speaker 2:  that does, I think, bring us to the Motorola phone where Motorola does seem

782
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:27,645
Speaker 2:  to have a lot of ideas. What would happen when you have a little phone that

783
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:31,765
Speaker 2:  gets even smaller and you have a big cover screen and like their

784
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:34,925
Speaker 2:  ideas about how apps even appear on that cover screen and how you might control

785
00:42:34,925 --> 00:42:36,325
Speaker 2:  them all pretty good.

786
00:42:36,915 --> 00:42:40,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. It's the idea of like, what if you only had to tap on your phone

787
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:43,285
Speaker 4:  two times to accomplish something on the outside screen is like, I don't

788
00:42:43,285 --> 00:42:45,485
Speaker 4:  know if that is the framework, but that's kind of what it feels like. And

789
00:42:45,485 --> 00:42:48,885
Speaker 4:  there's just little bits and pieces where it's like, okay, this is a screen

790
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:51,405
Speaker 4:  you're gonna have sort of looking at you all the time. So we're gonna make

791
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:55,045
Speaker 4:  it fun and cute and animated And, if you wanna like do

792
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:58,245
Speaker 4:  something, you're probably gonna open up the phone. So in this case, what

793
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:01,165
Speaker 4:  we need to do is just give you all the things that are like one or two taps

794
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:03,525
Speaker 4:  and just put it right in front of you so it's like, what's next on your calendar?

795
00:43:03,785 --> 00:43:07,645
Speaker 4:  Get to ai, stop the music. Like I love that. and

796
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:10,445
Speaker 4:  it, this is like, the thing about flip phones that I'm enthusiastic about

797
00:43:10,445 --> 00:43:14,205
Speaker 4:  is it is I sometimes you should only have access to a tiny

798
00:43:14,205 --> 00:43:18,005
Speaker 4:  portion of your phone and that is how you do it on that outside

799
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:20,845
Speaker 4:  screen. Like I think Motorola is getting this really right in a way I find

800
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:21,445
Speaker 4:  very exciting

801
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:25,685
Speaker 2:  Also, it seems like there, when you unfold it, their screen is less

802
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:27,925
Speaker 2:  creasey looking than the Samsung one. It's hard to

803
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:31,565
Speaker 4:  Tell. Yeah. It's only 10 80 p and it's like 6.9 inches. So it's like

804
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:35,285
Speaker 4:  super long and not that high res and that, that makes me

805
00:43:35,285 --> 00:43:38,365
Speaker 5:  Sense David's face right now. You just looks disgusted. Really enthusiastic.

806
00:43:38,685 --> 00:43:38,885
Speaker 4:  I just,

807
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:43,405
Speaker 2:  This you love a garbage phone, you're, oh my God, you single-handedly driving

808
00:43:43,545 --> 00:43:45,405
Speaker 2:  all of the sales of the B Palmer.

809
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:47,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's, that's been a wild couple of weeks. But wait,

810
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:49,085
Speaker 2:  One

811
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:53,005
Speaker 4:  Of the, one of the things that I've heard a bunch of people say about this

812
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,765
Speaker 4:  Samsung launch, and I think this might be true for Motorola and stuff too,

813
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:59,605
Speaker 4:  is that we're now in Samsung's case six generations

814
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:02,885
Speaker 4:  into the Flip and Fold universe and

815
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:07,405
Speaker 4:  anecdotally at least, and based on, you know, talking to people and what

816
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:11,125
Speaker 4:  we've seen, these are not winning in any meaningful way. Right? Like

817
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:15,045
Speaker 4:  they're not taking market share away from the Galaxy

818
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:19,205
Speaker 4:  s Lines and the iPhone and the other popular candy bar

819
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:22,845
Speaker 4:  phones. And so you wonder if instead of Samsung

820
00:44:23,065 --> 00:44:26,085
Speaker 4:  and others looking at these phones saying, this is how we win,

821
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:30,965
Speaker 4:  they're increasingly looking at them as just like kind of a sideshow

822
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:35,285
Speaker 4:  and Yeah, maybe. And, and if that is the case, of course you slow down

823
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:39,605
Speaker 4:  and you put less interesting resources into doing it. And

824
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:43,165
Speaker 4:  especially for Samsung, which has a gigantic business selling candy bar phones.

825
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:47,485
Speaker 4:  Like maybe, maybe we should be less interested

826
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:51,325
Speaker 4:  in these because the world is less interested in these for Motorola like

827
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:54,805
Speaker 4:  it, they kind of have nothing to lose by swinging big for something new and

828
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:58,405
Speaker 4:  the Razor is the best brand Motorola ever had. So like, I get why they're

829
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:02,325
Speaker 4:  doing this that way, but for Samsung, like, we've been

830
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,765
Speaker 4:  waiting for this to become Samsung's thing for so long now

831
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:10,165
Speaker 4:  and I wonder if Samsung is increasingly convinced with every

832
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,245
Speaker 4:  generation that maybe it's just not going to be,

833
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:16,045
Speaker 5:  Is it just too expensive? Is that why it just hasn't become the thing

834
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:18,925
Speaker 5:  I like, like that's why I haven't gotten one is it's almost $2,000

835
00:45:19,445 --> 00:45:23,245
Speaker 4:  I think for foldable phones. Very much so. Yeah. I think the flip funds you

836
00:45:23,245 --> 00:45:27,005
Speaker 4:  could like maybe have a debate about whether it is

837
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:30,405
Speaker 4:  meaningfully more useful to have that. I would argue that it is, but I I

838
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:34,245
Speaker 4:  think you could debate that. Yeah, but the, like the Fold problem is A,

839
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:38,165
Speaker 4:  they're huge and B, they're twice the price. Yeah. Like I just,

840
00:45:38,275 --> 00:45:41,525
Speaker 4:  it's that is going to be so hard to come back from for any of these companies.

841
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,165
Speaker 2:  But you get three times the screens

842
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,605
Speaker 5:  For twice the price.

843
00:45:44,985 --> 00:45:47,645
Speaker 2:  You do. Yeah. Pixel

844
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,205
Speaker 4:  The dollar ratio is off the choice.

845
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:53,285
Speaker 2:  That's your Saturday Samsung pitch. Two x the price, three x the screen

846
00:45:53,285 --> 00:45:53,485
Speaker 2:  and

847
00:45:53,485 --> 00:45:55,205
Speaker 4:  They'll give you a TV with it. So you get

848
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:59,165
Speaker 2:  Na and Cupertino. That's true. You can also get a TV with it.

849
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:03,085
Speaker 2:  All right. We have talked about everything for too long. We're way over already.

850
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:07,045
Speaker 2:  We're only halfway through. I think that makes sense. We'll be back

851
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:07,805
Speaker 2:  with more of our chest.

852
00:46:11,195 --> 00:46:14,765
Speaker 1:  Have a question or need how to advice. Just ask meta

853
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:18,765
Speaker 1:  AI whether you want to design a marathon training program that will get you

854
00:46:18,765 --> 00:46:22,605
Speaker 1:  race ready for the fall. Or you're curious what planets are visible in

855
00:46:22,605 --> 00:46:25,365
Speaker 1:  tonight's sky. Meta AI has the answers.

856
00:46:26,235 --> 00:46:29,925
Speaker 1:  Perhaps you want to learn how to plant basil when your garden only gets

857
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:33,725
Speaker 1:  indirect sunlight. Meta AI is your intelligent assistant.

858
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:37,685
Speaker 1:  It can even answer your follow-up questions like what You can make with your

859
00:46:37,775 --> 00:46:41,765
Speaker 1:  basil and other ingredients you have in your fridge. Meta AI

860
00:46:41,785 --> 00:46:45,685
Speaker 1:  can also summarize your class notes, visualize your ideas and so

861
00:46:45,685 --> 00:46:49,645
Speaker 1:  much more. The best part is You can find meta ai right in the apps

862
00:46:49,665 --> 00:46:53,445
Speaker 1:  you already have Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook,

863
00:46:53,705 --> 00:46:55,165
Speaker 1:  and Messenger. Just

864
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:12,245
Speaker 5:  got a story for this. I I got a way to tell. Explain this. All

865
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:13,845
Speaker 2:  Right Al, I'm just gonna let you drive. Here you go.

866
00:48:13,845 --> 00:48:17,565
Speaker 5:  So, so once upon a time, there was a family, no cost. And, and the dad went

867
00:48:17,705 --> 00:48:21,605
Speaker 5:  out and he put together a huge corporate conglomeration and they called it

868
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,205
Speaker 5:  National amusements, which

869
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:23,765
Speaker 2:  Is very good.

870
00:48:24,395 --> 00:48:28,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah, great. They're nationally amusing. And in there was

871
00:48:28,165 --> 00:48:31,965
Speaker 5:  CVS and this big storied century old

872
00:48:32,105 --> 00:48:35,645
Speaker 5:  studio, paramount, all of that in there. And then on the other side, there

873
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:39,325
Speaker 5:  was another family and, and they did something called Oracle. And

874
00:48:39,325 --> 00:48:42,925
Speaker 5:  Larry Ellison made a lot of money from that. And his kids

875
00:48:43,145 --> 00:48:46,885
Speaker 5:  got into to films and they started producing. And his daughter made a lot

876
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:50,125
Speaker 5:  of good movies and then made some bad ones. And his son made some really

877
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:53,845
Speaker 5:  successful movies like Top Gun that, you know, the New Top Gun.

878
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:57,285
Speaker 5:  The New Top Gun, yeah. He, he was a baby when the last, was he even alive

879
00:48:57,285 --> 00:48:59,405
Speaker 5:  when the last one came out? But he did that.

880
00:48:59,415 --> 00:49:00,685
Speaker 2:  We're not gonna find out. We're

881
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:04,165
Speaker 5:  Not gonna find out. Don't worry about it. This is, it doesn't matter. It

882
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:07,405
Speaker 5:  doesn't matter. What matters is that there were Z two families and they said,

883
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:11,205
Speaker 5:  you know what? We should really get together and the tech family

884
00:49:11,205 --> 00:49:14,965
Speaker 5:  should buy the media conglomerates, family's

885
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:19,165
Speaker 5:  business and just make an even bigger business. And then there was

886
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,485
Speaker 5:  a lot of winging about, there was a lot of like whinging about that. There

887
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:24,645
Speaker 5:  was a lot of, Ooh, should I do this? I don't know. Sherry Redstone, the current

888
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:28,085
Speaker 5:  owner of Paramount, was really concerned. She didn't know how she wanted

889
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:31,205
Speaker 5:  her, she didn't want her dad's legacy ruined, she wanted money.

890
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,285
Speaker 5:  Those are important things. And that's the

891
00:49:33,285 --> 00:49:36,765
Speaker 2:  Plot of succession, everybody. Yeah. This is fully the plot of success.

892
00:49:36,905 --> 00:49:37,325
Speaker 2:  That's

893
00:49:37,325 --> 00:49:39,805
Speaker 5:  What happened. And eventually David Ellison went to his dad and was like,

894
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:43,605
Speaker 5:  dad, you're a billionaire. Can I borrow a couple of billion, say

895
00:49:43,705 --> 00:49:47,645
Speaker 5:  six of your money and put it and sweetened this pot? And

896
00:49:47,645 --> 00:49:50,845
Speaker 5:  Larry said, I got your son. And now his son owns

897
00:49:51,745 --> 00:49:54,765
Speaker 5:  one of the largest film studios in Hollywood. Well,

898
00:49:54,765 --> 00:49:56,085
Speaker 2:  It hasn't closed yet, so he should Careful

899
00:49:56,145 --> 00:49:59,485
Speaker 5:  It hasn't closed yet. Yeah, that's true. It hasn't closed. He will potentially

900
00:49:59,545 --> 00:50:03,525
Speaker 5:  own it provided the lawsuits that are already cooking

901
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:06,205
Speaker 5:  up amongst the investors who are mad that they're not getting as much of

902
00:50:06,205 --> 00:50:09,725
Speaker 5:  this pot. Those, those don't screw things up. Provided

903
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:12,965
Speaker 5:  there is Apollo or another investor doesn't come in and say, actually I can

904
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:14,965
Speaker 5:  provide even more money than Larry Ellison

905
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,375
Speaker 5:  feel like that's probably not gonna happen. Seeing as Larry Ellison already

906
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:23,135
Speaker 5:  put 6 billion in, I, I, I feel like this is probably David

907
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:26,695
Speaker 5:  Ellison's company. And, and we've been seeing that all around

908
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:30,365
Speaker 5:  Hollywood. We've been seeing that from a lot of the reporters variety. Matthew

909
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,685
Speaker 5:  Bella over at Puck. A lot of folks have been talking about this. Matthew

910
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:37,125
Speaker 5:  Bella had a really good interview with Ellison about this, where he was like,

911
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,445
Speaker 5:  yeah, I'm gonna do all this tech stuff. And that was really interesting about

912
00:50:40,445 --> 00:50:43,605
Speaker 5:  all of this is he's pitched this as like tech taking over

913
00:50:44,425 --> 00:50:47,285
Speaker 5:  and I think we'd argue that Tech had already took over, given the success

914
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:50,965
Speaker 5:  of Netflix and, and even smaller stuff like Apple. But this is really officially

915
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:54,605
Speaker 5:  like tech has taken over Hollywood and he's got big

916
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,765
Speaker 5:  ambitions about using AI for workflows. That that's as much

917
00:50:58,765 --> 00:50:59,325
Speaker 5:  as he said.

918
00:50:59,645 --> 00:51:01,325
Speaker 2:  I can just read you the quotes. Yeah,

919
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:02,125
Speaker 5:  They're great.

920
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:06,125
Speaker 2:  The quotes are wild. A slide

921
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:09,885
Speaker 2:  deck for investors said AI would turbocharge content

922
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:13,325
Speaker 2:  creation and drive efficiencies in streamlined operations.

923
00:51:14,045 --> 00:51:14,685
Speaker 2:  Terrifying

924
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:19,205
Speaker 2:  Ellison said the art will challenge the technology and the technology challenges

925
00:51:19,205 --> 00:51:20,605
Speaker 2:  the art, which,

926
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:26,085
Speaker 2:  okay. Yeah. And then, and then he also said, we believe that understanding

927
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:29,245
Speaker 2:  the symbiotic relationship between art and technology is essential to be

928
00:51:29,245 --> 00:51:32,285
Speaker 2:  able to meet this moment. There are a lot of technology companies that are

929
00:51:32,285 --> 00:51:35,165
Speaker 2:  rapidly expanding into media. We believe it is essential for Paramount to

930
00:51:35,165 --> 00:51:38,565
Speaker 2:  be able to expand its technology prowess to be both a media and technology

931
00:51:38,565 --> 00:51:39,085
Speaker 2:  enterprise.

932
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:43,005
Speaker 4:  Those are quotes that come up when you say chat, GPT write me some quotes

933
00:51:43,295 --> 00:51:47,205
Speaker 4:  about like, do you remember the paper that was like, we, we found a

934
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:51,045
Speaker 4:  huge increase in the, the word delve being used because of chat

935
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,285
Speaker 4:  GPT. Like that's what that sounds like to me. That's a bunch of nothing.

936
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:56,285
Speaker 4:  Like that's, that's what you say. Well,

937
00:51:56,285 --> 00:52:00,165
Speaker 2:  There are, there are two, there are two things that are real. There are one

938
00:52:00,305 --> 00:52:04,285
Speaker 2:  oh thousand percent the things you would expect all of those words

939
00:52:04,345 --> 00:52:04,765
Speaker 2:  to mean.

940
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:10,045
Speaker 2:  Ellison proposed upgrading the advertising technology to give marketers more

941
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:12,885
Speaker 2:  information about what audiences they're reaching.

942
00:52:13,905 --> 00:52:17,245
Speaker 2:  So we're doing some data collection and algorithmic ads and that we are working

943
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:21,125
Speaker 2:  to improve the algorithmic recommendation engines that Paramount Plus uses,

944
00:52:21,145 --> 00:52:24,045
Speaker 2:  hoping subscribers will spend more time on the streaming service and viewer

945
00:52:24,065 --> 00:52:26,085
Speaker 2:  can. So we're doing engagement. Sure.

946
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:29,565
Speaker 5:  I I don't think those are actually the actual tech that they're gonna be

947
00:52:29,695 --> 00:52:32,845
Speaker 5:  doing, like investing in. I think, I think the advertising is, everybody's

948
00:52:32,845 --> 00:52:36,445
Speaker 5:  investing in that right now. Peacock, if you talk to anybody at NBC right

949
00:52:36,565 --> 00:52:40,005
Speaker 5:  now, they will not hesitate to be like, have you heard about our, our new

950
00:52:40,105 --> 00:52:43,725
Speaker 5:  ad tech platform? We are really all in on ad tech platforms for streaming.

951
00:52:44,155 --> 00:52:44,565
Speaker 5:  It's great.

952
00:52:44,985 --> 00:52:47,085
Speaker 2:  Can I just read you more words? Yes.

953
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:48,165
Speaker 4:  I wish you wouldn't.

954
00:52:48,845 --> 00:52:52,165
Speaker 2:  Ellison also said Skydance will work in partnership with Oracle to create

955
00:52:52,245 --> 00:52:56,165
Speaker 2:  a cloud-based animation studio. Skydance used

956
00:52:56,305 --> 00:53:00,165
Speaker 2:  the studio in the cloud to produce part of Spellbound, which is coming out

957
00:53:00,165 --> 00:53:03,925
Speaker 2:  later on. Netflix. We intend to scale that business across all of our production

958
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:05,445
Speaker 2:  workflows and animation. That's

959
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:08,725
Speaker 4:  Just, we're gonna buy a bunch of GPUs. Like what are we talking about? Well,

960
00:53:08,925 --> 00:53:12,605
Speaker 5:  I it's also kind of worthless because the guy who runs Skydance animation

961
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:16,085
Speaker 5:  right now is John Lasseter who famously got punted from Pixar

962
00:53:16,195 --> 00:53:20,165
Speaker 5:  because he couldn't keep his hands to himself. Allegedly. Yes.

963
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:23,645
Speaker 5:  And that, that's who's running it. They have not had a lot of successes.

964
00:53:23,675 --> 00:53:27,245
Speaker 5:  Most of their other animated properties have not had hit the, like

965
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:30,965
Speaker 5:  John Lasseter used to have a golden hand. Right? Like he'd look at anything

966
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:34,805
Speaker 5:  and it would make a billion dollars. It felt like nowadays it's like we barely

967
00:53:34,915 --> 00:53:38,805
Speaker 5:  sold luck to Apple tv. We're making a deal to, to get this

968
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:42,485
Speaker 5:  thing sold over at Netflix. That all felt like things

969
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:46,525
Speaker 5:  he was saying to get Sherry Redstone feeling comfortable to do

970
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:49,165
Speaker 5:  this deal because Sherry Redstone was holding up the deal

971
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:54,285
Speaker 5:  in, in big ways. And right now everybody in Hollywood has a lot of anxiety

972
00:53:54,285 --> 00:53:57,885
Speaker 5:  about tech companies and about tech infrastructure and how they can compete

973
00:53:57,885 --> 00:54:01,445
Speaker 5:  with stuff like Netflix who has like, for what it's worth,

974
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:05,285
Speaker 5:  the best algorithms when it comes to streaming and actually getting content

975
00:54:05,305 --> 00:54:09,165
Speaker 5:  in front of people's eyes. and it just felt like, let's alleviate this

976
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:11,925
Speaker 5:  woman's anxieties by saying AI a bunch.

977
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:12,925
Speaker 2:  Sure.

978
00:54:13,105 --> 00:54:14,965
Speaker 4:  And giving her many hundreds,

979
00:54:14,965 --> 00:54:15,525
Speaker 5:  Six of

980
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:17,205
Speaker 4:  Millions more dollars. Yeah. That, that seems

981
00:54:17,205 --> 00:54:18,485
Speaker 5:  Pretty, that probably helped. Yeah.

982
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:22,965
Speaker 2:  Anyway, I would just remind you the listener, that these

983
00:54:22,985 --> 00:54:26,525
Speaker 2:  are the things that people say when they buy studios.

984
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:30,885
Speaker 2:  Famously it's what at t said when I bought Warner Brothers. Yep. Which

985
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:34,005
Speaker 2:  again, provided the world, the four three Grayscale

986
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:35,645
Speaker 2:  Justice League.

987
00:54:36,475 --> 00:54:39,165
Speaker 5:  Fine. We, yeah. We don't know what this is gonna look like for

988
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:43,125
Speaker 2:  What movies will David Ellison remaster as Square

989
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:46,325
Speaker 2:  in Gray Scale, I think is the only question. It's gonna be

990
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,765
Speaker 4:  Mission Top Impossible movie. It's gonna be six hours long.

991
00:54:50,195 --> 00:54:50,685
Speaker 2:  Mission

992
00:54:50,685 --> 00:54:53,525
Speaker 4:  Impossible. Dead Records Cruise is going to be black and white and square

993
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:54,805
Speaker 4:  and it's gonna be nuts.

994
00:54:55,265 --> 00:54:58,125
Speaker 2:  Anyway, so this is like the big story in streaming. We haven't talked a lot

995
00:54:58,175 --> 00:55:01,925
Speaker 2:  about it because it hadn't happened, but now it's happened and it, if the

996
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:04,805
Speaker 2:  deal closes and as Alex said, all these lawsuits get resolved,

997
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:09,605
Speaker 2:  I think we're, we're looking at a bunch of tech money and tech ideas

998
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:13,845
Speaker 2:  coming for the studio that famously owns Top Gun coming for CBS

999
00:55:14,105 --> 00:55:16,085
Speaker 2:  coming for famously

1000
00:55:16,145 --> 00:55:16,965
Speaker 5:  On Star Trek.

1001
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:20,765
Speaker 2:  Right. Famously on Star Trek. It's gonna be weird. There's,

1002
00:55:20,765 --> 00:55:24,685
Speaker 2:  there's a real weirdness coming for this zone because this is just a

1003
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:28,525
Speaker 2:  flood of new money, but also just

1004
00:55:29,425 --> 00:55:33,365
Speaker 2:  the ideas that you would expect for the money to have. Yeah. But

1005
00:55:33,365 --> 00:55:35,965
Speaker 2:  dressed up in ever larger ambitions.

1006
00:55:36,395 --> 00:55:40,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That that is exactly it. I I'm curious to see what they do. I'm curious

1007
00:55:40,245 --> 00:55:44,085
Speaker 5:  to see if they unload any of these properties and, and what kind of

1008
00:55:44,085 --> 00:55:47,765
Speaker 5:  like movies and shows. We actually start seeing if Taylor Sheridan gets the

1009
00:55:47,765 --> 00:55:47,965
Speaker 5:  boot.

1010
00:55:48,405 --> 00:55:51,245
Speaker 2:  I have been, by the way, Goog furiously googling for what studio in the cloud

1011
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:54,325
Speaker 2:  means. and it, it's just a thing they say.

1012
00:55:54,515 --> 00:55:58,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's called a data center. This is the thing. Like, it's like

1013
00:55:58,005 --> 00:55:58,845
Speaker 5:  Everybody already does

1014
00:55:58,845 --> 00:55:59,645
Speaker 4:  It. This means anything.

1015
00:55:59,995 --> 00:56:01,125
Speaker 5:  It's called working remote.

1016
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:05,205
Speaker 4:  This is a rich guy who couldn't build a cool studio, buying

1017
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:09,205
Speaker 4:  a cool studio. Like if I had the money to do it,

1018
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:13,165
Speaker 4:  I would do it. Skydance is like cool, but not that cool. Paramount

1019
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:13,725
Speaker 4:  is cooler.

1020
00:56:16,145 --> 00:56:16,565
Speaker 4:  The end,

1021
00:56:17,785 --> 00:56:21,725
Speaker 2:  The closest I've come to understanding what Student Cloud means is

1022
00:56:21,835 --> 00:56:25,565
Speaker 2:  it's a, it's like a square in the deck that just says Studio in the cloud

1023
00:56:27,065 --> 00:56:30,525
Speaker 2:  and it says Skydance animation is building a studio in the cloud. That's

1024
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:31,885
Speaker 2:  the first bullet. Well, it's,

1025
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:33,365
Speaker 5:  It's great. You turn on Slack.

1026
00:56:33,785 --> 00:56:37,445
Speaker 2:  The second bullet is transition from on-prem to

1027
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:41,045
Speaker 2:  cloud-based production and hosting infrastructure, which is fine. That's

1028
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:45,165
Speaker 2:  a thing. You know, dentist office across America are

1029
00:56:45,165 --> 00:56:48,965
Speaker 2:  switching from on-prem to cloud-based infrastructure. and it

1030
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:52,725
Speaker 2:  feels like Oracle's just gonna get it $6 billion back because it turns

1031
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,245
Speaker 2:  out they're building it with Oracle.

1032
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:54,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1033
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:59,085
Speaker 2:  Okay. But does it it's gotta mean something.

1034
00:56:59,985 --> 00:57:03,925
Speaker 4:  Listen, NELI, we're we're like minutes away from you reading the Salesforce

1035
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:06,405
Speaker 4:  website again and I can't have that in my life. We

1036
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:10,045
Speaker 2:  Need to move on. Fine. Alright, Alex, you got a lot left in the lightning

1037
00:57:10,045 --> 00:57:10,445
Speaker 2:  round. What else?

1038
00:57:10,445 --> 00:57:13,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean, what else do we got? Well, so Redbox, we, we had this great

1039
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:17,925
Speaker 5:  story from, from Yanko last week that was all about friend

1040
00:57:17,925 --> 00:57:21,725
Speaker 5:  of The Verge about how Redbox was in dire straits

1041
00:57:21,745 --> 00:57:25,645
Speaker 5:  and why it was in dire straits and now it's shutting down its

1042
00:57:25,645 --> 00:57:29,605
Speaker 5:  parent company. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment. Yeah, that's, that's

1043
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:30,405
Speaker 5:  the real name of the

1044
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,325
Speaker 2:  Company. This is the second time in several weeks the Chicken Soup for the

1045
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:36,245
Speaker 2:  Soul has come up. Yeah. You'll recall that we looked at the Crackle website,

1046
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:38,525
Speaker 2:  which is owned by Chicken Soup for the Soul.

1047
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:40,645
Speaker 5:  We'll see. For how long?

1048
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:41,525
Speaker 2:  For now? Yeah,

1049
00:57:41,785 --> 00:57:45,685
Speaker 5:  For now. Yeah. They, they got a new CEO last week and his job

1050
00:57:45,705 --> 00:57:49,685
Speaker 5:  is literally to come in and fix companies that are in dire straits. And for

1051
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:53,485
Speaker 5:  chicken soup for the soul entertainment, that means red box is toast. and

1052
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:56,725
Speaker 5:  it had already been really bad. A lot of folks probably if you, if you're

1053
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:59,445
Speaker 5:  listening to this and you tried to go rent out a red box in the last couple

1054
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:02,685
Speaker 5:  of months would struggle to get any, anything,

1055
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:07,165
Speaker 5:  a lot of them have been shut down and, and now it's, it's done. RIP red

1056
00:58:07,225 --> 00:58:07,445
Speaker 5:  box.

1057
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:10,725
Speaker 2:  So what, what's happening to all the DVDs in the red boxes today?

1058
00:58:11,465 --> 00:58:13,925
Speaker 5:  You just go and you break the box open and you take it

1059
00:58:14,465 --> 00:58:16,645
Speaker 2:  Sub looting. So Alex is like, do looting.

1060
00:58:16,805 --> 00:58:20,525
Speaker 5:  Well the prob the problem is that all of the technicians who, who,

1061
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:24,045
Speaker 5:  who manage those things have all been grounded because all of their cars

1062
00:58:24,345 --> 00:58:28,045
Speaker 5:  are getting repossessed because Oh, that's brutal. They haven't been paying

1063
00:58:28,045 --> 00:58:30,445
Speaker 5:  the bills for the, the cars that they rent. So

1064
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,845
Speaker 5:  like, come like Walgreens seven 11, everybody's just unplugging them

1065
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:39,245
Speaker 5:  and I think you're just gonna start seeing more of these unplugged and just

1066
00:58:39,245 --> 00:58:43,005
Speaker 5:  sitting there. And I'm not saying you should loot them, but

1067
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:47,645
Speaker 2:  That's it. That's where that ends. Yeah. Don't t 'em there's no but after,

1068
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,485
Speaker 2:  I'm not saying you should loot them.

1069
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:51,165
Speaker 5:  Yes. Just don't, don't do that.

1070
00:58:52,165 --> 00:58:55,165
Speaker 2:  I can hear the, the footsteps of the lawyers coming down the hallway right

1071
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:55,725
Speaker 2:  now. Just ha

1072
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:57,125
Speaker 5:  Ha where is she?

1073
00:58:57,585 --> 00:59:00,885
Speaker 2:  So do you think this is just straight up streaming killed Red box? Is this

1074
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:04,965
Speaker 5:  That's where I'm at because like when you read Yoko's piece,

1075
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:08,805
Speaker 5:  this all happened. The, like the big turning point for Red Box was when

1076
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:14,405
Speaker 5:  in 2021 when everybody said we're gonna stop releasing

1077
00:59:14,405 --> 00:59:17,045
Speaker 5:  everything physically and putting it in theaters and we're just gonna do

1078
00:59:17,045 --> 00:59:18,605
Speaker 5:  it all wait to streaming. What

1079
00:59:18,605 --> 00:59:21,085
Speaker 4:  Was the other thing going on in 2021, Chris? You

1080
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,045
Speaker 2:  Know? Yeah. But

1081
00:59:23,065 --> 00:59:26,205
Speaker 5:  But see that's the thing. If they had, if they had said like, there's a,

1082
00:59:26,325 --> 00:59:29,285
Speaker 5:  a lot of the people who are buying, who were renting these were in places

1083
00:59:29,285 --> 00:59:33,205
Speaker 5:  where they don't have streaming and they would also like to watch whatever

1084
00:59:33,275 --> 00:59:37,245
Speaker 5:  King Kong and Godzilla are getting up to in 2021. And

1085
00:59:37,255 --> 00:59:40,725
Speaker 5:  those just weren't coming out so they couldn't rent anything. So nobody was

1086
00:59:40,725 --> 00:59:43,645
Speaker 5:  renting from Redbox because none of the studios were releasing this stuff

1087
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:44,005
Speaker 5:  physically.

1088
00:59:44,005 --> 00:59:47,045
Speaker 4:  Well, right. I but I think I I I think You can make a

1089
00:59:47,395 --> 00:59:51,365
Speaker 4:  extremely compelling argument that Covid killed Redbox more so

1090
00:59:51,365 --> 00:59:53,365
Speaker 4:  than You can make one that's streaming killed Redbox.

1091
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:56,845
Speaker 5:  But no 'cause co how is Covid gonna do it? Everybody's at home anyway. These

1092
00:59:56,845 --> 00:59:57,885
Speaker 5:  things are outside. We didn't

1093
00:59:58,045 --> 00:59:59,245
Speaker 4:  Go outside for two years.

1094
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:02,685
Speaker 5:  You still have to go to the grocery store where the red box

1095
01:00:02,685 --> 01:00:06,205
Speaker 2:  Is. So yeah, there was a, there was a red box at the CVS in the woods.

1096
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:10,925
Speaker 2:  People, people gazed at it and then they thought, I don't have a

1097
01:00:10,965 --> 01:00:14,845
Speaker 2:  DVD player. It went home. I mean there is that. Well, and

1098
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:15,005
Speaker 2:  and

1099
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:18,925
Speaker 4:  Part of Red Box's thing was access for people who

1100
01:00:18,925 --> 01:00:22,485
Speaker 4:  didn't have great access to streaming either because it's expensive or because

1101
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,765
Speaker 4:  they lived in places without great connection. Or like, there was a, there

1102
01:00:25,765 --> 01:00:29,725
Speaker 4:  was a real, this is a compliment to streaming or like a,

1103
01:00:30,035 --> 01:00:33,325
Speaker 4:  this is a, a thing you do when you can't do streaming. Not, this is a real

1104
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:36,725
Speaker 4:  competitor to streaming. And so, Alex, to your point, I think as

1105
01:00:37,015 --> 01:00:40,605
Speaker 4:  fewer and fewer people didn't have streaming, it's probably true that

1106
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:44,125
Speaker 4:  Redbox didn't fill that need for as many people.

1107
01:00:44,425 --> 01:00:48,005
Speaker 4:  But the problem for me is this is also just spectacular

1108
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:51,325
Speaker 4:  corporate mismanagement. Oh, a hundred percent. This company took on a mountain

1109
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:54,725
Speaker 4:  of debt to buy a company. It probably couldn't afford Chicken Soup for the

1110
01:00:54,725 --> 01:00:58,565
Speaker 4:  Soul. I think it was like $325 million in debt to buy Redbox

1111
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:02,405
Speaker 4:  banking on. We're gonna make a ton of money back. 1D VD at a time made a

1112
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:05,445
Speaker 4:  bunch of weird decisions and it all fell apart. So part of me is like, maybe

1113
01:01:05,445 --> 01:01:08,965
Speaker 4:  streaming killed Redbox, but I don't think we ever actually got to see streaming

1114
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:12,085
Speaker 4:  killed Redbox because I think like Chicken Soup for the Soul killed Redbox.

1115
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:12,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

1116
01:01:12,525 --> 01:01:16,325
Speaker 5:  Well Redbox was like not doing great when, when

1117
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:19,285
Speaker 5:  Chicken Soup for the Soul bought it because it had just, it just done a spac

1118
01:01:19,825 --> 01:01:22,125
Speaker 5:  it it just gone public via spac Which

1119
01:01:22,235 --> 01:01:23,205
Speaker 2:  Wait, can we just,

1120
01:01:24,895 --> 01:01:25,245
Speaker 5:  Sorry.

1121
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:28,405
Speaker 2:  There's, there's, there's like all of that. This company is called Chicken

1122
01:01:28,515 --> 01:01:32,245
Speaker 2:  Soup for the Soul Entertainment. Right? Like you already know,

1123
01:01:32,795 --> 01:01:36,445
Speaker 2:  like this started as a set of books for Live Laugh Love

1124
01:01:36,555 --> 01:01:40,485
Speaker 2:  moms. Right? And they're like, we're a media empire now. At

1125
01:01:40,505 --> 01:01:41,005
Speaker 2:  no point we

1126
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:42,325
Speaker 5:  Like crowd funded media

1127
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:45,045
Speaker 2:  Empire. We should change our name. Like you already know that. This is just

1128
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:48,245
Speaker 2:  a bunch of weird, I like zombie media

1129
01:01:49,265 --> 01:01:50,805
Speaker 2:  zombie ideas. Like I'm

1130
01:01:50,805 --> 01:01:54,485
Speaker 4:  Glad you brought this up because does violate my theory that you can't

1131
01:01:54,485 --> 01:01:58,085
Speaker 4:  survive a bad name for your company. And Chicken Soup For the

1132
01:01:58,085 --> 01:01:59,285
Speaker 2:  Soul is

1133
01:01:59,755 --> 01:02:00,965
Speaker 5:  Entertainment. Please

1134
01:02:00,965 --> 01:02:03,445
Speaker 4:  Very much a bad name. Yeah, right. You Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment.

1135
01:02:03,815 --> 01:02:04,165
Speaker 4:  Thank

1136
01:02:04,165 --> 01:02:05,085
Speaker 2:  You. When did this book

1137
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:06,885
Speaker 4:  Come out? People say the fact that I'm

1138
01:02:06,885 --> 01:02:09,965
Speaker 2:  Googling Chicken Soup for the Soul as a book is gonna be so bad for me.

1139
01:02:10,545 --> 01:02:14,085
Speaker 5:  So this is technically spun. They spun off from Chicken Soup for the Soul

1140
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:16,405
Speaker 5:  for the books. 'cause that's like the book of publishing

1141
01:02:16,415 --> 01:02:17,685
Speaker 2:  Signs. They didn't even have the books yet.

1142
01:02:18,115 --> 01:02:20,165
Speaker 5:  They spun that off. This is a whole other company.

1143
01:02:21,315 --> 01:02:22,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah, this is the entertainment

1144
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,045
Speaker 2:  Company. Oh, the books are Chicken Soup for the Soul. LLC

1145
01:02:27,185 --> 01:02:31,005
Speaker 2:  We gotta, I gotta end this also the worst website I've ever seen in my

1146
01:02:31,005 --> 01:02:34,685
Speaker 2:  entire life. But just that you can't survive a bad name,

1147
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:38,645
Speaker 2:  especially when you're not even connected to the the Live Laugh love

1148
01:02:38,645 --> 01:02:39,325
Speaker 2:  books anymore.

1149
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:43,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You just out there buying companies for too much debt that are

1150
01:02:43,325 --> 01:02:47,285
Speaker 5:  already been half killed by Covid and streaming and thinking this'll work

1151
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:48,605
Speaker 5:  and it didn't.

1152
01:02:48,905 --> 01:02:52,285
Speaker 2:  Can I say that the the book company has Chicken Soup for the Soul for Kids.

1153
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:58,325
Speaker 2:  It's good. Okay. That's enough. Next lightning round item. Just if you start

1154
01:02:58,365 --> 01:03:00,645
Speaker 2:  a company, don't call it Chicken Soup for the Soul. Please don't, I think

1155
01:03:00,645 --> 01:03:00,845
Speaker 2:  is the,

1156
01:03:01,155 --> 01:03:02,125
Speaker 4:  That is probably the lesson.

1157
01:03:02,505 --> 01:03:06,405
Speaker 2:  And also if your entire company is distributing physical media, you,

1158
01:03:06,545 --> 01:03:07,925
Speaker 2:  you, you should have a plan B.

1159
01:03:09,115 --> 01:03:12,805
Speaker 4:  Well they did. They had a big long plan

1160
01:03:12,945 --> 01:03:16,165
Speaker 4:  for how to go digital with all of this. And Redbox has been trying to do

1161
01:03:16,165 --> 01:03:19,245
Speaker 4:  a streaming service for like 10 plus years.

1162
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:22,005
Speaker 2:  Correct. But then you're just being being and never you're just, you're just

1163
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:22,245
Speaker 2:  Netflix.

1164
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:26,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean that's what Paramount's trying to do and we didn't yell at them

1165
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:27,285
Speaker 4:  for that. So.

1166
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:30,725
Speaker 2:  Well I can't wait to see what chicken soups plan to cloud

1167
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:32,565
Speaker 4:  Cloud is. Here's a new idea. Chicken

1168
01:03:32,565 --> 01:03:33,765
Speaker 2:  Soup in the cloud for the soul.

1169
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:37,765
Speaker 4:  Larry Ellison buys Redbox. Do you think we're good

1170
01:03:38,465 --> 01:03:42,445
Speaker 2:  As, as long as they get off-Prem and I would point out that Red Box,

1171
01:03:42,905 --> 01:03:46,285
Speaker 2:  one of the single most on-prem businesses of all time,

1172
01:03:46,945 --> 01:03:50,765
Speaker 4:  Red Box in the cloud in so many PREMs. Think about it. What if a red box

1173
01:03:50,865 --> 01:03:51,445
Speaker 4:  put in the cloud?

1174
01:03:51,825 --> 01:03:52,845
Speaker 2:  All right, what's next Alex?

1175
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:58,405
Speaker 5:  The next is, I'd never pause when I'm watching tv.

1176
01:03:58,605 --> 01:04:02,565
Speaker 5:  I learned because I don't get pause ads. Do you guys get those when you're

1177
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:04,805
Speaker 5:  just watching a show and you're like, I gotta go to the bathroom. So you

1178
01:04:04,805 --> 01:04:05,325
Speaker 5:  pause it on Hulu,

1179
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:07,845
Speaker 4:  Amazon Prime is the one I notice it on the most, but I think there are other

1180
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:08,965
Speaker 4:  streaming services. Hulu

1181
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:12,525
Speaker 5:  Does it. Who does it? Okay. It Sling TV is now doing it. That's the big news

1182
01:04:12,525 --> 01:04:16,485
Speaker 5:  this week. I was like, what is a pause ad? Oh, I'm

1183
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:20,285
Speaker 5:  watching TV wrong is what I learned from all of this. But

1184
01:04:20,285 --> 01:04:24,165
Speaker 5:  basically pause ads happen when you pause something and then

1185
01:04:24,165 --> 01:04:27,845
Speaker 5:  it just decides to display an ad while you're going to the bathroom. Exactly

1186
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,285
Speaker 2:  What I

1187
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:32,165
Speaker 5:  Wanted. Exactly what you want. Sling TV is now doing it, but they also

1188
01:04:32,165 --> 01:04:35,245
Speaker 5:  have a little thing at the bottom saying You can go turn this off for how

1189
01:04:35,245 --> 01:04:39,085
Speaker 5:  much, which prime and for free, you just go to the settings and

1190
01:04:39,085 --> 01:04:43,045
Speaker 5:  turn it off. Which is different than what Prime and Hulu are doing.

1191
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:46,805
Speaker 5:  So good on you Sling like bad on you Sling, but also good on you

1192
01:04:47,545 --> 01:04:51,525
Speaker 2:  Is more and more of these companies move into like ad tiers,

1193
01:04:51,935 --> 01:04:54,685
Speaker 2:  right? Pay money, but still have ads, which is what they all are now.

1194
01:04:55,945 --> 01:04:59,605
Speaker 2:  The desire to get more money is gonna result in more and more ads getting

1195
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:03,245
Speaker 2:  more and more You can just see it coming. It's a tsunami of weird ideas and

1196
01:05:03,245 --> 01:05:05,965
Speaker 2:  they're just out of space. Like the goal,

1197
01:05:05,965 --> 01:05:08,485
Speaker 5:  When you think we get like a right rail of just ads,

1198
01:05:08,635 --> 01:05:12,525
Speaker 2:  Dude You can already get a free TV that is, that has a physical rail

1199
01:05:12,545 --> 01:05:13,285
Speaker 2:  of ads on it.

1200
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:20,005
Speaker 4:  That's literally a thing. So I will say I think pause ads are

1201
01:05:20,035 --> 01:05:23,885
Speaker 4:  fine. Yeah. Like in, in terms of finding ways to show

1202
01:05:23,975 --> 01:05:27,885
Speaker 4:  giant ass ads on my TV in a way that is non interruptive. This is the best

1203
01:05:27,985 --> 01:05:31,485
Speaker 4:  one they've ever invented. Because it's like, if I'm pausing my

1204
01:05:31,785 --> 01:05:32,005
Speaker 4:  tv,

1205
01:05:34,225 --> 01:05:38,205
Speaker 4:  who cares? Like what, what do I wanna see on the tv? It's do I care if it's

1206
01:05:38,525 --> 01:05:42,085
Speaker 4:  a frozen like ha moving shot of someone's face

1207
01:05:42,545 --> 01:05:44,645
Speaker 4:  or if it's like a Toyota ad, I don't care.

1208
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:45,685
Speaker 5:  I think it's like

1209
01:05:46,435 --> 01:05:49,605
Speaker 4:  Fine, it's, I'm getting up to leave the room anyway. Like that's why I paused

1210
01:05:49,605 --> 01:05:50,565
Speaker 4:  the joke. I think it's

1211
01:05:50,565 --> 01:05:53,165
Speaker 5:  Like when you're having like a phone call, right? Like somebody calls you,

1212
01:05:53,165 --> 01:05:56,485
Speaker 5:  you're like, oh, I need a pause. And then it's like Toyota Chandra,

1213
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,725
Speaker 2:  Is it gonna wait, it's gonna play a video or

1214
01:05:58,725 --> 01:06:00,525
Speaker 4:  Is it gonna, there's sound I feel very differently.

1215
01:06:00,835 --> 01:06:02,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, these are,

1216
01:06:02,795 --> 01:06:06,685
Speaker 4:  Most of the Amazon ones at least are just like a static image that is just

1217
01:06:06,685 --> 01:06:10,165
Speaker 4:  like you, you press pause of Mr and Mrs. Smith and a thing pops up that's

1218
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:11,045
Speaker 4:  just like Jeep

1219
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:13,005
Speaker 2:  And

1220
01:06:13,045 --> 01:06:16,765
Speaker 4:  Then just freezes for as long as you need it to. And I think that's fine.

1221
01:06:16,985 --> 01:06:20,085
Speaker 4:  You know what I hate, I'm just gonna complain about ads for a minute here

1222
01:06:20,085 --> 01:06:22,485
Speaker 4:  and then we can move on. I love this thing is, there's now a thing that happens

1223
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:26,325
Speaker 4:  on Hulu and probably some others, but I noticed that the most on Hulu where

1224
01:06:26,325 --> 01:06:29,765
Speaker 4:  at the beginning of a show it will ask you to choose your ad experience.

1225
01:06:30,075 --> 01:06:34,005
Speaker 4:  It's like, which Charmin ad would you like to watch? None

1226
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:36,405
Speaker 4:  of, and you've gotten to the point now where Anna, my wife, will sit there

1227
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:39,885
Speaker 4:  and yell at the tv, I don't care. And I'm always like, Anna, that doesn't

1228
01:06:39,885 --> 01:06:43,725
Speaker 4:  accomplish anything. And she's like, but I don't care. And and it'll like

1229
01:06:43,725 --> 01:06:46,725
Speaker 4:  linger there for 10 seconds then if you don't it do anything it'll just choose

1230
01:06:46,865 --> 01:06:50,645
Speaker 4:  for you and then play the whole ad anyway. And I'm like, no, if you're gonna

1231
01:06:50,645 --> 01:06:54,605
Speaker 4:  make me watch ads, you pick, don't make me do the work to pick my

1232
01:06:54,605 --> 01:06:55,045
Speaker 4:  own ads.

1233
01:06:55,685 --> 01:06:56,285
Speaker 5:  I I agree with that.

1234
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,125
Speaker 4:  Use your damn algorithms and show me the ads. We can't

1235
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:02,245
Speaker 2:  Use AI to collect more data about you unless you generate more data. David,

1236
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:02,925
Speaker 4:  Apparently

1237
01:07:03,345 --> 01:07:05,245
Speaker 2:  It costs money to go from on-prem to the cloud

1238
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:09,765
Speaker 4:  Drives me nuts. But if I, if I could choose between like

1239
01:07:10,425 --> 01:07:14,325
Speaker 4:  in, in like dynamic interstitial ads and pause ads, give me pause ads

1240
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:17,605
Speaker 4:  every time. The problem is it's both and it's gonna be a bunch of other stuff

1241
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:18,205
Speaker 4:  too. Yeah, and

1242
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:21,925
Speaker 2:  They're, they're just gonna send you that way. Like it's, it's coming. All

1243
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:22,445
Speaker 2:  right. One more.

1244
01:07:23,425 --> 01:07:23,645
Speaker 5:  Oh,

1245
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:24,965
Speaker 2:  In the streaming lightning round.

1246
01:07:26,305 --> 01:07:26,925
Speaker 5:  Do you wanna

1247
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:29,965
Speaker 2:  Talk about, I think we got it. Well actually lemme do it. I'll do it this

1248
01:07:29,965 --> 01:07:33,725
Speaker 2:  way. Okay. All right. I, I want to call out one more that isn't

1249
01:07:33,725 --> 01:07:37,125
Speaker 2:  technically streaming, but I think is really interesting for our lightning

1250
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:40,885
Speaker 2:  round of video over the internet, which is Adam Ary who runs

1251
01:07:40,885 --> 01:07:44,325
Speaker 2:  Instagram, put out a video this week where he is like, I just wanna make

1252
01:07:44,325 --> 01:07:47,965
Speaker 2:  it clear we're ne we're not gonna do long form video, which is interesting

1253
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:51,645
Speaker 2:  for a number of reasons. One, he was like, the whole point of Instagram is

1254
01:07:51,645 --> 01:07:54,725
Speaker 2:  connect you to your friends. So when you like open a friend's video and then

1255
01:07:54,725 --> 01:07:57,605
Speaker 2:  you're like in reels by accident and then you're in reels by accident for

1256
01:07:57,605 --> 01:08:01,565
Speaker 2:  two hours, he's like, that's great. That's what we want. Because you are

1257
01:08:01,565 --> 01:08:05,205
Speaker 2:  more likely to share a short video with your friend and then they'll watch

1258
01:08:05,205 --> 01:08:08,845
Speaker 2:  it and they'll, they'll end up in the we the reels rabbit hole and they'll

1259
01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:12,565
Speaker 2:  share some videos and he is like, that's great long videos you won't

1260
01:08:12,565 --> 01:08:15,205
Speaker 2:  watch all the way through and you definitely won't share them. And they apparently

1261
01:08:15,205 --> 01:08:18,125
Speaker 2:  measure this and they know this. He calls it a symbiotic relationship between

1262
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:21,485
Speaker 2:  connecting your friends and short videos, which is interesting on its face.

1263
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:24,485
Speaker 2:  The second thing that's interesting is that Instagram has super tried to

1264
01:08:24,485 --> 01:08:27,645
Speaker 2:  do long form video and compete with YouTube. Before it was called IGTV,

1265
01:08:27,765 --> 01:08:31,205
Speaker 4:  I went to the IGTV launch. It was one of the weirdest days of my entire life.

1266
01:08:31,425 --> 01:08:34,565
Speaker 2:  And this is the previous administration of Instagram. This is not Myer's

1267
01:08:34,565 --> 01:08:37,645
Speaker 2:  Instagram, this is like the previous leaders of Instagram. But they tried,

1268
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:40,925
Speaker 2:  they were like, oh, we'll just be YouTube now. And they utterly failed.

1269
01:08:41,745 --> 01:08:45,125
Speaker 2:  And now they, they, you know, they were like, we'll be TikTok now. And they've

1270
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:49,085
Speaker 2:  succeeded. And TikTok is like, we'll be YouTube now. And I

1271
01:08:49,085 --> 01:08:52,645
Speaker 2:  dunno how that's going, but it's interesting to see Instagram be like, huh,

1272
01:08:52,945 --> 01:08:56,685
Speaker 2:  no, when in fact all of these streamers have to compete with

1273
01:08:56,885 --> 01:09:00,805
Speaker 2:  reels and YouTube and like YouTube is growing fastest on TVs

1274
01:09:01,045 --> 01:09:04,885
Speaker 2:  actually. So it's interesting to see all of this other action happening

1275
01:09:05,105 --> 01:09:08,605
Speaker 2:  and then Missa being like, no, we're gonna, we're staying right here. Short

1276
01:09:08,605 --> 01:09:09,045
Speaker 2:  form video.

1277
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:13,645
Speaker 4:  I think it's the right call. And I will say the, the thing you're describing

1278
01:09:13,645 --> 01:09:17,325
Speaker 4:  that that like symbiotic thing makes perfect sense to me and anecdotally

1279
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:21,125
Speaker 4:  feels true, right? That like the idea that I'm a going to sit

1280
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:24,165
Speaker 4:  here and watch one single 30 minute video

1281
01:09:24,985 --> 01:09:26,285
Speaker 4:  on Instagram and it

1282
01:09:26,515 --> 01:09:27,285
Speaker 2:  Send it to a friend,

1283
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:31,045
Speaker 4:  Right? It just feels preposterous. Right? And I think like, I think all the

1284
01:09:31,045 --> 01:09:35,005
Speaker 4:  time about, like, when you talk to people about the, the act that you do

1285
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:39,165
Speaker 4:  on TikTok, it's scrolling, it's not viewing, like the thing that

1286
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:42,885
Speaker 4:  you do on TikTok is flip channels that is more important than what is actually

1287
01:09:43,465 --> 01:09:46,445
Speaker 4:  on the screen that you're viewing. It's, it's the activity that is the thing,

1288
01:09:46,935 --> 01:09:50,885
Speaker 4:  which is what's different from like TV or even

1289
01:09:50,885 --> 01:09:54,205
Speaker 4:  YouTube, which is less of a scrolling thing, but YouTube is becoming more

1290
01:09:54,205 --> 01:09:58,045
Speaker 4:  scrolly with shorts and stuff like that. Instagram is, has always been scrolly.

1291
01:09:58,105 --> 01:10:01,645
Speaker 4:  And I think trying to undo that and be like, this is now a destination

1292
01:10:01,835 --> 01:10:04,645
Speaker 4:  that you're gonna spend a half hour at a time without touching your screen,

1293
01:10:05,245 --> 01:10:08,085
Speaker 4:  I think was just never gonna happen. It's also like a much harder thing to

1294
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:12,045
Speaker 4:  sell ads against, which is I think a reason. It makes a lot of sense. It's

1295
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:15,525
Speaker 4:  really easy to sell ads that are a video between two other videos that you're

1296
01:10:15,525 --> 01:10:19,325
Speaker 4:  scrolling on. And this, this just feels, this feels very obvious

1297
01:10:19,325 --> 01:10:23,125
Speaker 4:  to me except that these companies usually can't help themselves from all

1298
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:26,925
Speaker 4:  trying to be each other. So to hear Adam just kosh it entirely was

1299
01:10:26,925 --> 01:10:27,125
Speaker 4:  pretty

1300
01:10:27,365 --> 01:10:30,925
Speaker 2:  Interesting. It's also funny 'cause it's the money, like YouTube makes a

1301
01:10:30,925 --> 01:10:33,965
Speaker 2:  lot of money and they're like, we're not gonna make that money. Which is

1302
01:10:33,965 --> 01:10:37,925
Speaker 2:  super, like YouTube just has no competition. It is the place for

1303
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:41,445
Speaker 2:  long form video on the internet, which is weird. Well, it's

1304
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:45,405
Speaker 5:  A place for independent long form video, right? Like, like it is

1305
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:49,285
Speaker 5:  effectively the VHS tape of, of the modern era where

1306
01:10:49,285 --> 01:10:52,965
Speaker 5:  it's just like, hey, or cable access. It's just like, Hey, I need a platform.

1307
01:10:53,685 --> 01:10:57,325
Speaker 5:  I don't wanna go make a deal with David Ellison. This is what I do.

1308
01:10:57,605 --> 01:11:00,765
Speaker 5:  I put it, I just put it on YouTube. Like functionally, that's what YouTube

1309
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:04,805
Speaker 5:  is becoming. And and it's getting more and more like that even though

1310
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:08,525
Speaker 5:  it's UI and stuff isn't like that. And I think it makes sense.

1311
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:12,205
Speaker 2:  Well, right, but a really weird thing is that You can just like rent paramount

1312
01:11:12,205 --> 01:11:15,125
Speaker 2:  movies on YouTube. Yes. No one does it, but You can just be like, I'm gonna

1313
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,845
Speaker 2:  rent Mission Impossible. Yeah. And

1314
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:17,285
Speaker 5:  You can

1315
01:11:17,285 --> 01:11:19,765
Speaker 4:  You You can subscribe to streaming services through YouTube. Yeah,

1316
01:11:19,765 --> 01:11:23,725
Speaker 5:  You could watch movies on cable access in in in olden times too.

1317
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:28,045
Speaker 5:  Like, and I think Instagram to me is more like, now I'm gonna go

1318
01:11:28,195 --> 01:11:31,605
Speaker 5:  just completely switch up the analogy and, and say that

1319
01:11:31,675 --> 01:11:35,005
Speaker 5:  Instagram is kind of like the drive through Margarita bars.

1320
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:38,005
Speaker 5:  I don't know if you, I've, they're in Texas and they rule

1321
01:11:38,165 --> 01:11:39,885
Speaker 4:  I was gonna say that I I gotta move to Texas.

1322
01:11:40,075 --> 01:11:42,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's, that sounds awesome. You see those in Louisiana and Texas and

1323
01:11:42,525 --> 01:11:45,685
Speaker 5:  it's like, yeah, you drive through, you get your, your beautiful treat, you

1324
01:11:45,685 --> 01:11:49,245
Speaker 5:  drive home, you have, it's like bam, bam, you're done. and

1325
01:11:49,825 --> 01:11:53,365
Speaker 5:  it feels like long form video is like, what if we did fine dining at the

1326
01:11:53,365 --> 01:11:55,565
Speaker 5:  drive through Margarita bar?

1327
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:59,205
Speaker 4:  So it's like, I don't want that. What if you went to Sonic but your meal

1328
01:11:59,205 --> 01:12:01,845
Speaker 4:  was a hundred dollars? And it's like, that's not, that's not, we're looking

1329
01:12:01,865 --> 01:12:03,325
Speaker 2:  For you isn't the plot of the bear. I just,

1330
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:07,845
Speaker 5:  They still serve the sandwiches out the side window

1331
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:12,205
Speaker 2:  Just isn't that the bear People love the bear

1332
01:12:14,075 --> 01:12:15,565
Speaker 5:  Instagram. You could be the bear.

1333
01:12:16,185 --> 01:12:18,685
Speaker 2:  All right, that is where we need to end this entire

1334
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:22,365
Speaker 2:  look. If you know the people who run Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment,

1335
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:25,405
Speaker 2:  bring 'em to us. We, I have a, I have a number of questions. What kind of

1336
01:12:25,405 --> 01:12:28,045
Speaker 2:  zombies are they? All right, that's it. We gotta take a break. We'll be back

1337
01:12:28,115 --> 01:12:29,285
Speaker 2:  with the actual lightning round.

1338
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:36,005
Speaker 1:  Have a question or need how to advice. Just ask meta

1339
01:12:36,225 --> 01:12:40,205
Speaker 1:  AI whether you want to design a marathon training program that will get you

1340
01:12:40,205 --> 01:12:44,085
Speaker 1:  race ready for the fall. Or you're curious what planets are visible in tonight's

1341
01:12:44,105 --> 01:12:47,965
Speaker 1:  sky. Meta AI has the answers. Perhaps

1342
01:12:47,985 --> 01:12:51,645
Speaker 1:  you want to learn how to plant basil when your garden only gets indirect

1343
01:12:51,965 --> 01:12:55,885
Speaker 1:  sunlight. Meta AI is your intelligent assistant. It

1344
01:12:55,885 --> 01:12:59,125
Speaker 1:  can even answer your follow-up questions like what You can make with your

1345
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:02,925
Speaker 1:  basil and other ingredients you have in your fridge. Meta AI

1346
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:06,925
Speaker 1:  can also summarize your class notes, visualize your ideas and so

1347
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:10,885
Speaker 1:  much more. The best part is You can find meta ai right in the apps

1348
01:13:10,905 --> 01:13:14,725
Speaker 1:  you already have Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook,

1349
01:13:14,945 --> 01:13:18,645
Speaker 1:  and Messenger. Just tag meta AI in your chat or

1350
01:13:18,905 --> 01:13:22,525
Speaker 1:  tap the icon in the search bar to get started. It's the

1351
01:13:22,805 --> 01:13:25,485
Speaker 1:  most advanced AI at your fingertips.

Speaker 1:  Expand your world with meta ai.

1353
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:23,645
Speaker 4:  new smartwatch. And I would say by far, most interestingly,

1354
01:14:23,805 --> 01:14:27,565
Speaker 4:  a new phone called the s CMF Phone one. It's

1355
01:14:27,565 --> 01:14:31,365
Speaker 4:  $199 Android phone that

1356
01:14:31,365 --> 01:14:35,205
Speaker 4:  basically lets you replace the back of the phone with

1357
01:14:35,285 --> 01:14:39,245
Speaker 4:  a couple of different accessories and different colors or add like a

1358
01:14:39,435 --> 01:14:42,685
Speaker 4:  lanyard. What's the other one? A wallet You can put on? And I think there's

1359
01:14:42,685 --> 01:14:46,645
Speaker 4:  one that's a kickstand that You can just stick on through an accessory

1360
01:14:46,645 --> 01:14:46,765
Speaker 4:  port.

1361
01:14:48,665 --> 01:14:52,285
Speaker 4:  By all accounts, it's kind of a like mid rangey Android phone, but it looks

1362
01:14:52,285 --> 01:14:56,245
Speaker 4:  awesome. It's orange, it's 200 bucks. And this is for some

1363
01:14:56,245 --> 01:14:59,245
Speaker 4:  reason the Android phone I have been most excited about in a very long time.

1364
01:14:59,835 --> 01:15:02,365
Speaker 4:  Like nothing is out there being like, we're gonna make tech more fun again.

1365
01:15:02,515 --> 01:15:03,485
Speaker 4:  This is the most

1366
01:15:05,525 --> 01:15:09,045
Speaker 4:  interesting thing in that mold that I think nothing has ever done.

1367
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:13,165
Speaker 4:  And it's a $200 Android phone and I'm very excited about it. Like it rules.

1368
01:15:13,955 --> 01:15:16,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah, just like what if, what if we tried new things? Right?

1369
01:15:17,925 --> 01:15:21,125
Speaker 4:  I I really spending all that time with the books Palmer has gotten me like

1370
01:15:21,365 --> 01:15:24,605
Speaker 4:  obsessed with this idea that what if you took a phone and just tweaked two

1371
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:28,205
Speaker 4:  things about it. Like what this, if we, if we take this form factor we're

1372
01:15:28,205 --> 01:15:31,925
Speaker 4:  all obsessed with and just turned it a little, can you change that? And that

1373
01:15:31,925 --> 01:15:34,005
Speaker 4:  one of those is like, what if the screen folded? One of them is like, what

1374
01:15:34,005 --> 01:15:36,645
Speaker 4:  if it was the ink? And one of them, like, I've been obsessed with modular

1375
01:15:36,645 --> 01:15:40,565
Speaker 4:  phone ideas for forever and I I really continue to think there is something

1376
01:15:40,565 --> 01:15:44,285
Speaker 4:  to like, what if you could make your phone several different things

1377
01:15:45,365 --> 01:15:49,245
Speaker 4:  o over time. And this is such a cool version of that. And they did

1378
01:15:49,285 --> 01:15:52,845
Speaker 4:  a really like IKEA ish thing here where it has some like

1379
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:56,445
Speaker 4:  exposed screws and You can actually open up the back of your phone and see

1380
01:15:56,445 --> 01:16:00,125
Speaker 4:  the inside of your phone. It's just, it's just seems fun. And again, it's

1381
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:03,765
Speaker 4:  like, it's a, it's $200 like yes, more of this please.

1382
01:16:04,195 --> 01:16:08,125
Speaker 2:  It's weird because what you want is, what you would expect is that the phone

1383
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:11,365
Speaker 2:  parts of the phone, 15 years into phones

1384
01:16:12,355 --> 01:16:16,285
Speaker 2:  more would be a commodity by now, right? Like

1385
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:18,605
Speaker 2:  an Android phone should just be a commodity and then the way it looks and

1386
01:16:18,605 --> 01:16:22,565
Speaker 2:  works and feels in your hand and it, that just hasn't played out for, for

1387
01:16:22,565 --> 01:16:26,005
Speaker 2:  a million reasons because of carriers 'cause of competition. Because Google

1388
01:16:26,155 --> 01:16:27,245
Speaker 2:  what, whatever it is,

1389
01:16:29,155 --> 01:16:33,045
Speaker 2:  EIMS like whatever you think has restricted this market, right? From being

1390
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:36,405
Speaker 2:  competitive and the android part, it's

1391
01:16:36,445 --> 01:16:40,285
Speaker 4:  Happened with Android parts, like with the other parts of Android

1392
01:16:40,285 --> 01:16:43,125
Speaker 4:  phones, like yeah, cameras that go into Android phones are now everywhere.

1393
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:47,085
Speaker 4:  The sensors are everywhere. Android runs everything. But like the phone thing,

1394
01:16:47,715 --> 01:16:49,125
Speaker 4:  that hasn't happened. You're totally right.

1395
01:16:49,525 --> 01:16:52,365
Speaker 2:  Well, at at least the United States we're gonna, yeah, we're gonna have listeners

1396
01:16:52,365 --> 01:16:55,165
Speaker 2:  in other countries, particularly like India and China, who'll be like, no,

1397
01:16:55,165 --> 01:16:59,005
Speaker 2:  this, this is pretty competitive out here. Yeah. But it, this

1398
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:00,965
Speaker 2:  is like one of those things where it's like, oh, if only we had a little

1399
01:17:00,965 --> 01:17:04,525
Speaker 2:  competition, we'd have way more ideas like this. Yep. It is cool. I'm

1400
01:17:04,805 --> 01:17:07,085
Speaker 2:  assuming that it is a very slow phone because it's 200.

1401
01:17:08,835 --> 01:17:12,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But I, like, I, I saw a bunch of reactions from people that

1402
01:17:12,685 --> 01:17:15,845
Speaker 4:  were like, they, people were ask, I got a bunch of people asking me like,

1403
01:17:15,845 --> 01:17:19,605
Speaker 4:  is this a good reading device? 'cause it has a, it has an OLED screen, it

1404
01:17:19,605 --> 01:17:22,805
Speaker 4:  has a, I think 5,000 million battery, which should last a while.

1405
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,925
Speaker 4:  It'll run Android apps. And then I saw a bunch of people who were like, this

1406
01:17:25,925 --> 01:17:29,845
Speaker 4:  is gonna be a kick ass gaming handheld. And to me it's like, this

1407
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:33,525
Speaker 4:  is, this is the stuff, right? Like we don't, what if we didn't have one device

1408
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:37,325
Speaker 4:  that we demanded to do everything, but instead we could just buy these

1409
01:17:37,325 --> 01:17:41,005
Speaker 4:  things that are $200 and actually just like, sort of push them

1410
01:17:41,005 --> 01:17:44,565
Speaker 4:  towards one use case or another. And instead it's like an overlapping Venn

1411
01:17:44,565 --> 01:17:48,285
Speaker 4:  diagram of things that look like phones. And I think that's super fun. I

1412
01:17:48,285 --> 01:17:51,925
Speaker 4:  like that more. I'm gonna buy the hell out of this thing. But also the

1413
01:17:52,395 --> 01:17:56,245
Speaker 4:  earbuds and the watch also both look pretty cool. And the earbuds in

1414
01:17:56,245 --> 01:17:59,845
Speaker 4:  particular, I think the little dial. Yeah, really great.

1415
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:03,845
Speaker 4:  Like total, I love a little pointless fidget spinner of a dial on a case.

1416
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:07,325
Speaker 4:  Like good job CMF and the ones last year,

1417
01:18:07,945 --> 01:18:11,205
Speaker 4:  if I remember correctly, were better than we expected

1418
01:18:11,745 --> 01:18:15,285
Speaker 4:  for something pretty cheap. I think these are like, these are,

1419
01:18:15,595 --> 01:18:19,485
Speaker 4:  yeah, $59, they're cheap. And for a pair of kind of

1420
01:18:19,485 --> 01:18:20,885
Speaker 4:  AirPods e looking things,

1421
01:18:22,545 --> 01:18:25,405
Speaker 4:  by all accounts, they've sounded pretty good in the past. So I'm, I'm pretty

1422
01:18:25,405 --> 01:18:26,685
Speaker 4:  optimistic here. I'm very excited.

1423
01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:30,365
Speaker 5:  I will say it was surprising to me that this week we got two kind of

1424
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:34,285
Speaker 5:  AirPod knockoffs and nothing was the one that didn't have

1425
01:18:34,555 --> 01:18:35,045
Speaker 5:  LEDs in it.

1426
01:18:37,025 --> 01:18:39,565
Speaker 2:  That's surprise me. You're gonna change AirPods. What's the first thing to

1427
01:18:39,565 --> 01:18:43,045
Speaker 2:  do? You had LEDs? Yeah. All right. I'll do mine quick and then Kranz should

1428
01:18:43,045 --> 01:18:46,365
Speaker 2:  ends with yours. 'cause yours, you should end on outrage basically. Yeah.

1429
01:18:46,785 --> 01:18:49,645
Speaker 2:  So I'll, I'll just pick one. I, I had two, but I'll just pick one. You know,

1430
01:18:49,655 --> 01:18:53,485
Speaker 2:  we're paying a lot of attention to AI and copyright, like, I think it's

1431
01:18:53,635 --> 01:18:56,925
Speaker 2:  kind of asset cards and there's lots and lots of lawsuits. Sarah Silverman

1432
01:18:56,925 --> 01:19:00,765
Speaker 2:  is suing ai, AI companies. There's the, the record

1433
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:04,765
Speaker 2:  labels are suing Suo uio, which are AI companies. The

1434
01:19:04,765 --> 01:19:08,725
Speaker 2:  New York Times are suing Open ai, on and on and on. The one that

1435
01:19:08,725 --> 01:19:11,685
Speaker 2:  I thought was really interesting and kind of like a long shot was a bunch

1436
01:19:11,685 --> 01:19:14,725
Speaker 2:  of developers sued over GitHub copilot

1437
01:19:15,395 --> 01:19:18,445
Speaker 2:  because it can obviously spit out code. And this is like the main thing that

1438
01:19:18,445 --> 01:19:21,845
Speaker 2:  people have been excited about with ai. Most of their claims got tossed out

1439
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:25,245
Speaker 2:  this week except for the one that said they're violating the open source

1440
01:19:25,365 --> 01:19:28,605
Speaker 2:  licenses, which is a really weird circle.

1441
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:33,725
Speaker 2:  So they're like, look, the GitHub copilot can just spit out code. They trained

1442
01:19:33,725 --> 01:19:37,525
Speaker 2:  on a bunch of our code. They didn't have the copyright to that code. That

1443
01:19:37,645 --> 01:19:41,045
Speaker 2:  code is copyrighted and that's copyright infringement. Like,

1444
01:19:41,265 --> 01:19:43,365
Speaker 2:  pretty straightforward. The judge was like, none of that makes any sense.

1445
01:19:43,365 --> 01:19:47,085
Speaker 2:  This isn't what's really happening. Interesting precedent. And then they

1446
01:19:47,085 --> 01:19:50,965
Speaker 2:  said, but it is true that there were software licenses

1447
01:19:50,985 --> 01:19:54,045
Speaker 2:  for that code open source software licenses. They didn't abide by them. 'cause

1448
01:19:54,045 --> 01:19:57,845
Speaker 2:  the, the code they spit out should have those same licenses. That's how open

1449
01:19:57,845 --> 01:20:01,605
Speaker 2:  source licenses work. So now we might have a weird open source legal battle

1450
01:20:02,235 --> 01:20:06,045
Speaker 2:  over AI and not a copyright legal battle over ai, which is equally

1451
01:20:06,045 --> 01:20:09,645
Speaker 2:  weird because all of those open source licenses absolutely

1452
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:13,485
Speaker 2:  depend on copyright law because that's what they are, they're licenses to

1453
01:20:13,485 --> 01:20:17,085
Speaker 2:  copyright work, right? So there's just this weird knot of weird of like

1454
01:20:17,435 --> 01:20:20,605
Speaker 2:  copyright law problems happening with this one case.

1455
01:20:21,345 --> 01:20:24,725
Speaker 2:  And if you're a really optimistic AI person, you say, look, it was fair use.

1456
01:20:25,035 --> 01:20:28,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like all these games have thrown out. If you're very negative, you

1457
01:20:28,485 --> 01:20:32,245
Speaker 2:  say, well that was just a weird one. And the, the big ones to come

1458
01:20:32,945 --> 01:20:36,485
Speaker 2:  are still going to define how this whole industry survives or thrives.

1459
01:20:36,755 --> 01:20:37,045
Speaker 2:  Does

1460
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:39,805
Speaker 4:  It feel like that's where all of this is headed? That we're, we're starting

1461
01:20:39,805 --> 01:20:43,565
Speaker 4:  with we're of a hundred different versions of the same fight and what

1462
01:20:43,565 --> 01:20:47,445
Speaker 4:  we're gonna end up with is like two of the most consequential ones and then

1463
01:20:48,035 --> 01:20:51,165
Speaker 4:  that will percolate out. 'cause it does feel like, I mean we've talked a

1464
01:20:51,165 --> 01:20:53,725
Speaker 4:  lot about a lot of these lawsuits and they're all different, but they're

1465
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:57,685
Speaker 4:  all also kind of the same. And you wonder if we're gonna get

1466
01:20:57,685 --> 01:21:00,365
Speaker 4:  to a point where everybody decides like, okay, let's, let's figure out what

1467
01:21:00,365 --> 01:21:03,405
Speaker 4:  we're actually fighting about and then fight about that instead of fighting

1468
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:06,125
Speaker 4:  about like a hundred variations of that thing.

1469
01:21:06,635 --> 01:21:07,885
Speaker 2:  Well this is America Jack.

1470
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:14,285
Speaker 2:  Like no, it's gonna just be chaos. Like yeah, okay. That's, that's the way

1471
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:18,245
Speaker 2:  our system is designed to work is like there isn't yet

1472
01:21:18,405 --> 01:21:19,485
Speaker 2:  a King of America.

1473
01:21:20,645 --> 01:21:21,765
Speaker 4:  I mean there is now. Yeah,

1474
01:21:22,235 --> 01:21:23,725
Speaker 2:  Soon. Soon there might be.

1475
01:21:25,945 --> 01:21:29,805
Speaker 2:  But the, the notion that there is just some definitive answer or that

1476
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:34,005
Speaker 2:  everyone will quit their whining so the New York Times can get to

1477
01:21:34,005 --> 01:21:37,285
Speaker 2:  like, it's not gonna happen. So what you're gonna get is this like mishmash

1478
01:21:37,285 --> 01:21:41,245
Speaker 2:  of precedence until Congress passes a law that unifies all

1479
01:21:41,245 --> 01:21:44,925
Speaker 2:  these precedents into like a regulatory framework. Seems unlikely. Or

1480
01:21:44,925 --> 01:21:48,725
Speaker 2:  there's a Supreme Court case that I dunno, throws out 50 years

1481
01:21:48,725 --> 01:21:52,525
Speaker 2:  of precedent for no reason. That's, they, they love doing that and you

1482
01:21:52,525 --> 01:21:55,485
Speaker 2:  just have to like work through the process, but in the meantime, everyone's

1483
01:21:55,485 --> 01:21:58,685
Speaker 2:  just gonna take their shots. And I think one of the things that's interesting

1484
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:02,485
Speaker 2:  is like there are so many shots and they're all kind of weird,

1485
01:22:02,695 --> 01:22:06,485
Speaker 2:  right? They're all just like picking off at the edges. But again, I've been

1486
01:22:06,485 --> 01:22:09,645
Speaker 2:  saying it like only one has to like go through for the bottom to fall out

1487
01:22:09,645 --> 01:22:12,085
Speaker 2:  and these companies have to pay. And the thing you're saying is that they're

1488
01:22:12,085 --> 01:22:15,165
Speaker 2:  all kind of the same case. It's all the same argument. You took our stuff

1489
01:22:15,165 --> 01:22:18,885
Speaker 2:  without permission. Whether or not you need that permission is like

1490
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:22,885
Speaker 2:  the thing that makes the internet go in like the realist

1491
01:22:22,945 --> 01:22:26,925
Speaker 2:  way. And so if you change the boundaries of what you need permission

1492
01:22:26,925 --> 01:22:30,885
Speaker 2:  for to use or reuse or remix or sample or whatever, you kind

1493
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:34,725
Speaker 2:  of change the economy. Like the whole economy changes around it.

1494
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:38,605
Speaker 2:  Which is why it's kind of wacky that it's just a bunch of shots. Like who

1495
01:22:38,605 --> 01:22:41,925
Speaker 2:  knows? Yeah. But this one in particular is interesting 'cause it's gonna

1496
01:22:41,925 --> 01:22:45,885
Speaker 2:  end up being an open source contract case. And we haven't had one

1497
01:22:45,885 --> 01:22:46,725
Speaker 2:  of those in a very long time.

1498
01:22:48,435 --> 01:22:51,925
Speaker 2:  Okay. That was fine. Alex. I bring us home with some pure outrage. Yeah,

1499
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:55,805
Speaker 5:  Some pure outrage. So do you guys remember the, what is

1500
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:58,325
Speaker 5:  it, the unofficial Apple web log?

1501
01:22:58,795 --> 01:23:02,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. ua I used to work, I worked at Engadget and they were our sister site.

1502
01:23:02,515 --> 01:23:02,925
Speaker 2:  They were

1503
01:23:02,925 --> 01:23:06,485
Speaker 5:  Your sister site. Oh yeah. UA was like old school. One of the original Apple

1504
01:23:06,655 --> 01:23:10,525
Speaker 5:  blogs used to love reading it. One of my best friends used to

1505
01:23:10,525 --> 01:23:14,485
Speaker 5:  work there. One of my best friends got very upset this week because

1506
01:23:15,595 --> 01:23:19,005
Speaker 5:  Christina Warren, former, former, she works at GitHub now

1507
01:23:19,505 --> 01:23:22,285
Speaker 5:  and she was suddenly writing it to again,

1508
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:27,205
Speaker 5:  she herself wasn't, her byline was appearing at Tua of

1509
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:31,405
Speaker 5:  just next to a bunch of like clearly AI written schlock. And

1510
01:23:31,825 --> 01:23:35,765
Speaker 5:  she wasn't the only one. A lot of former reporters from Tua had

1511
01:23:35,775 --> 01:23:39,645
Speaker 5:  their bylines appear on the site because earlier this year it

1512
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:43,605
Speaker 5:  seems to have been acquired from Apollo. It it left the Yahoo

1513
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:47,685
Speaker 5:  land for Apollo and, and then Apollo seemed to have sold

1514
01:23:47,685 --> 01:23:51,085
Speaker 5:  it to someone else. And that someone else who we still don't entirely know

1515
01:23:51,085 --> 01:23:54,805
Speaker 5:  who they are or what they do, were just filling

1516
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:58,525
Speaker 5:  up, filling up this empty blog with content. And allegedly

1517
01:23:58,715 --> 01:24:02,645
Speaker 5:  like the, the explanation that they had on their site was on

1518
01:24:02,645 --> 01:24:06,005
Speaker 5:  the two oh site was, yeah, we, we don't have any of this content. So we're

1519
01:24:06,005 --> 01:24:09,445
Speaker 5:  replicating it with ai so we don't lose these important archives.

1520
01:24:09,665 --> 01:24:11,165
Speaker 5:  That's not how archiving works.

1521
01:24:13,115 --> 01:24:16,645
Speaker 2:  It's very good, by the way. It's a very good, like what if I made some stuff

1522
01:24:16,645 --> 01:24:17,485
Speaker 2:  up? Yeah.

1523
01:24:17,555 --> 01:24:21,245
Speaker 5:  Just full stop. That's not how any of that works. Nope. People were very

1524
01:24:21,245 --> 01:24:24,965
Speaker 5:  upset. Christina Warren was, was among them and she reached out

1525
01:24:25,785 --> 01:24:29,285
Speaker 5:  and, and they, they promptly changed the name of her

1526
01:24:29,285 --> 01:24:32,485
Speaker 5:  character and changed the, the headshot. So it was no longer her.

1527
01:24:33,105 --> 01:24:37,005
Speaker 5:  And it's just a big bummer in the world. It's just a bummer

1528
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:40,125
Speaker 5:  that sites are getting picked up and just filled with AI

1529
01:24:40,555 --> 01:24:44,405
Speaker 5:  garbage. I think it is particularly a bummer for those of us who've worked

1530
01:24:44,405 --> 01:24:48,085
Speaker 5:  at a lot of these smaller sites and stuff. Who, who

1531
01:24:48,085 --> 01:24:52,045
Speaker 5:  knows where my byline could appear next. I'm excited to find

1532
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:52,245
Speaker 5:  out.

1533
01:24:52,795 --> 01:24:56,445
Speaker 4:  This is like Google ha did earlier

1534
01:24:56,595 --> 01:25:00,325
Speaker 4:  this year, a thing Google normally doesn't do, which is come out and

1535
01:25:00,325 --> 01:25:03,805
Speaker 4:  basically say aggressively and clearly

1536
01:25:04,315 --> 01:25:08,285
Speaker 4:  that it was making changes to its search algorithm such that this is no

1537
01:25:08,285 --> 01:25:11,685
Speaker 4:  longer a good idea. Yeah. Right? 'cause the reason you do this is you, you

1538
01:25:11,705 --> 01:25:15,645
Speaker 4:  buy a domain that has real authority in the

1539
01:25:15,645 --> 01:25:18,645
Speaker 4:  hopes that it will still rank in Google. You fill it with nonsense. That

1540
01:25:18,845 --> 01:25:21,125
Speaker 4:  nonsense ranks well on Google. You sell a bunch of ads, you make some money.

1541
01:25:22,145 --> 01:25:25,965
Speaker 4:  It it does work. Like it is, it is a strategy. It's not necessarily a

1542
01:25:25,965 --> 01:25:26,365
Speaker 4:  long term.

1543
01:25:26,435 --> 01:25:29,525
Speaker 5:  It's a strategy for like half of media online.

1544
01:25:29,935 --> 01:25:33,365
Speaker 4:  Right. and it, and it, and it works. And Google has been saying

1545
01:25:33,485 --> 01:25:37,445
Speaker 4:  aggressively that it is trying to prevent this from working. And yet it

1546
01:25:37,445 --> 01:25:39,445
Speaker 4:  pretty clearly seems to continue to work.

1547
01:25:40,365 --> 01:25:43,925
Speaker 5:  I I, I just don't know when Google's gonna be able to do that because this

1548
01:25:43,925 --> 01:25:47,565
Speaker 5:  has been like the, the only difference here is the scale of crappy content.

1549
01:25:48,115 --> 01:25:51,885
Speaker 5:  Like somebody would've done this without AI as well, right? They would've

1550
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:54,925
Speaker 5:  hired a bunch of people with no name and said, just write a bunch of content,

1551
01:25:54,985 --> 01:25:57,725
Speaker 5:  put it on the site. We've seen that happen before. Sure. I think IBT was

1552
01:25:57,725 --> 01:26:01,405
Speaker 5:  an example of that. And in this case it happened to be a

1553
01:26:01,665 --> 01:26:05,085
Speaker 5:  ai it happened to be this early Apple blog full of like,

1554
01:26:05,215 --> 01:26:08,885
Speaker 5:  well-known tech bloggers. And that's just a

1555
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:12,605
Speaker 5:  terrible, terrible move to make in that case.

1556
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:16,805
Speaker 5:  Don't do that. You wanna choose like better homes and Gardens? No,

1557
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:17,845
Speaker 5:  they're still around. They're

1558
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:18,085
Speaker 2:  Still around.

1559
01:26:18,195 --> 01:26:21,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But you know, you wanna choose something maybe not tech adjacent to

1560
01:26:21,925 --> 01:26:24,645
Speaker 5:  do this with, if you're gonna be gross. It,

1561
01:26:24,705 --> 01:26:28,645
Speaker 4:  It was a weird choice to do it on an Apple blog. Yeah, I will. I I

1562
01:26:28,645 --> 01:26:31,965
Speaker 4:  will agree with that. But this is the thing, like MTO on our team wrote this

1563
01:26:31,965 --> 01:26:35,525
Speaker 4:  great piece this week about Yeah. The guy behind, I think the company is

1564
01:26:35,525 --> 01:26:38,005
Speaker 4:  it called Aon, I think is the name of the company,

1565
01:26:39,175 --> 01:26:42,965
Speaker 4:  which is the one that did a lot of the AI stuff that became a huge

1566
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:46,525
Speaker 4:  mess at Sports Illustrated like this. The internet is so quickly

1567
01:26:46,965 --> 01:26:50,765
Speaker 4:  becoming this, and I've been thinking a lot about this, like after the

1568
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:54,285
Speaker 4:  MTV archives went away and the Comedy Central archives went away, like speaking

1569
01:26:54,285 --> 01:26:57,645
Speaker 4:  of two websites that a lot of people know and trust and would believe if

1570
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,885
Speaker 4:  someone bought them and filled them with spam nonsense. Like there's just

1571
01:27:00,885 --> 01:27:04,605
Speaker 4:  going to be such a long run of this and it's,

1572
01:27:04,605 --> 01:27:08,525
Speaker 4:  it's gonna get weirder before it gets normalized in

1573
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:09,565
Speaker 4:  whatever way it's gonna look like.

1574
01:27:10,305 --> 01:27:11,925
Speaker 2:  To be clear, I don't think Google can stop it.

1575
01:27:12,325 --> 01:27:13,805
Speaker 5:  I Yeah, I don't think they can. There I

1576
01:27:13,805 --> 01:27:17,325
Speaker 2:  And I it's not, and that's not because of antipathy towards Google. I think

1577
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:20,685
Speaker 2:  the problem is so hard and then

1578
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:25,805
Speaker 2:  the internal philosophical reckoning for Google is

1579
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:29,725
Speaker 2:  even harder. So the problem is you have to say a

1580
01:27:29,725 --> 01:27:33,525
Speaker 2:  bunch of AI generated sludge is bad. Yes. Right? We're gonna

1581
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:34,565
Speaker 2:  not rank it

1582
01:27:35,265 --> 01:27:38,565
Speaker 4:  Sludge that you're charging people $20 a month per person to make. Right?

1583
01:27:38,565 --> 01:27:42,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So you're like, okay, like you, you just, there are two

1584
01:27:42,225 --> 01:27:46,085
Speaker 2:  wolves, you know, it's like, what are you gonna do? Like you have to

1585
01:27:46,085 --> 01:27:49,805
Speaker 2:  say the output of your own models is bad at some point. Like, that is the

1586
01:27:49,805 --> 01:27:53,685
Speaker 2:  task ahead of the search team. And I don't know that they can reckon

1587
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:54,765
Speaker 2:  with it fully. Like,

1588
01:27:55,175 --> 01:27:58,965
Speaker 4:  We'll see. Well, and let's be real, like what are Google's AI overviews for

1589
01:27:58,985 --> 01:28:02,565
Speaker 4:  web searches, if not more or less exactly the same thing. Yeah.

1590
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:06,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. We'll see, they, by the way I've been, the overviews have been,

1591
