00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,520
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Connected Meat Thermometers.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,320
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am at Trader Joe's two

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,280
Speaker 2:  days before Thanksgiving. Pray for me, honestly, all the turkeys are gone.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,920
Speaker 2:  There's like 95,000 people in this grocery store right now and it

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,680
Speaker 2:  feels a little like what I imagine it would feel like if they

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,320
Speaker 2:  just came on and announced that the apocalypse was happening in two hours,

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,520
Speaker 2:  if that makes sense. But I need stuffing. So here we

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,760
Speaker 2:  are. Anyway, we have a great show for you coming up today. It's

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,520
Speaker 2:  Thanksgiving week, so we're gonna do something a little different than a

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,320
Speaker 2:  normal Verge cast episode. We're gonna make Thanksgiving dinner, Jen Patterson

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,720
Speaker 2:  two eight, the Verges smart home reviewer and reporter is also an excellent

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,120
Speaker 2:  cook. So she's at home in South Carolina and she's gonna make us a meal.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,920
Speaker 2:  And tell us all about the state and future of the smart kitchen and the smart

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,720
Speaker 2:  home in general. This episode FairWarning is gonna make you

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,000
Speaker 2:  really, really hungry. So I'm sorry in advance about that all that's coming

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,280
Speaker 2:  up right after the break, but I just found the stuffing aisle and I think

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,600
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna have to fist fight somebody to get it before it's gone. So wish

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,560
Speaker 2:  me luck and please come bail me outta jail. This is a verge cast scene in

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:06,680
Speaker 2:  a sec.

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,070
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So we had other plans for this episode. We

22
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,190
Speaker 2:  recorded a bunch of stuff. We had big ideas about stories we wanna do. We'll

23
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,710
Speaker 2:  get to all of those later. But we ended up just wanting to spend

24
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,470
Speaker 2:  all of this time talking about the smart home. It's an interesting time in

25
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,790
Speaker 2:  the Smart Home with Matter and a bunch of new gadgets coming out that all

26
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,590
Speaker 2:  promised to make the smart home make a lot more sense. But also it's Thanksgiving

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,150
Speaker 2:  week and all I can think about is Thanksgiving food and stuffing

28
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,190
Speaker 2:  and cranberry sauce and all of these other things. So we ended up just spending

29
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,030
Speaker 2:  like a really long time hanging out with Jen Tuey and recording

30
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,830
Speaker 2:  and talking about the smart home and smart gadgets and we made a Vergecast

31
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,950
Speaker 2:  cooking show without even really meaning to.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,990
Speaker 2:  So that's what this episode is now, this is the Vergecast Cooking Show. It's

33
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,950
Speaker 2:  Thanksgiving week. Like I said before, Jen is in her kitchen in South Carolina.

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,790
Speaker 2:  She's been cooking like for hours it seems. I think if I

35
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,030
Speaker 2:  remember correctly, we're like mid Turkey. That's what seems to be going

36
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,510
Speaker 2:  on here. So let's just dive into it. Let's see what's going

37
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,630
Speaker 2:  on. Hi Jen.

38
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,630
Speaker 4:  Hey David.

39
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,910
Speaker 2:  Happy Thanksgiving. Happy almost Thanksgiving.

40
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,670
Speaker 4:  Happy Thanksgiving to you too. It's not always my favorite

41
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,430
Speaker 4:  holiday cuz I spend it all in the kitchen. But I have a great

42
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,070
Speaker 4:  smart kitchen so I get to play with my gadgets. So that's always fun.

43
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,720
Speaker 2:  You do a lot of smart home reviewing for us, which means your house

44
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,400
Speaker 2:  is, I would say like a chaotically smart home, which is that you,

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,560
Speaker 2:  you don't get to have things that like make sense and work well together.

46
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,240
Speaker 2:  You just have all the things and then you get to figure it out. Is that that

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,440
Speaker 2:  fair?

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,360
Speaker 4:  That is fair, yes. I have dual competing. I don't have

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,680
Speaker 4:  dualling, I have competing voice assistants in my kitchen. I have four cuz

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,400
Speaker 4:  I actually have big be built into my fridge. I'm so sorry

51
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,520
Speaker 4:  Siri and Google and Alexa, they're all gonna go off now

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,760
Speaker 4:  and that is one of the downsides of being a smart home reviewer. Everyone

53
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,440
Speaker 4:  says to me, oh you know your house must be so smart. I'm like,

54
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,520
Speaker 4:  it is, but I'm always changing things up and breaking things.

55
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,640
Speaker 4:  So troubleshooting things. But the kitchen is the one space that I

56
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,600
Speaker 4:  do actually try very hard to keep, you know, operational.

57
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,240
Speaker 4:  Okay. Whereas you know, the lights might not go in on the bathroom every

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,960
Speaker 4:  time you walk in, but I want my kitchen to work cuz I wanna be able to feed

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,360
Speaker 4:  my family.

60
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,440
Speaker 2:  That's fair.

61
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,480
Speaker 4:  And there aren't actually that many great smart home gadgets for the

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,440
Speaker 4:  kitchen yet. I like to say the reason is probably because the

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,920
Speaker 4:  kitchen is already one of the most technologically advanced rooms in your

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,560
Speaker 4:  house, right? You've already got a robot that washes your dishes, you've

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,160
Speaker 4:  got a fridge and an oven that does its job very well,

66
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,800
Speaker 4:  doesn't really need an internet connection to do what it does well.

67
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,840
Speaker 4:  So I tend to limit my smart gadgets in the kitchen, but I do have one

68
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,680
Speaker 4:  or two that I really

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,240
Speaker 2:  Like. Yeah, give me a quick tour. Let's just do kind of a a, a whip

70
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,200
Speaker 2:  around the Jen Smart Kitchen here. The first thing I see is this enormous

71
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,600
Speaker 2:  screen on your fridge behind you. So let's, let's start there. What do, what

72
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,400
Speaker 2:  do we have here? So

73
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,320
Speaker 4:  This is a Samsung Smart Fridge. It's an older model. It does have

74
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,280
Speaker 4:  some hiccups cuz of that builtin Android screen. I did

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,880
Speaker 4:  try and order the Turkey and everything through Instacart

76
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,480
Speaker 4:  on the fridge and it kept crashing so I had to use my phone.

77
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,640
Speaker 4:  So that was a bit of a disappointment. I'd never done that before

78
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,840
Speaker 4:  cause normally I'd just go to the grocery store. But yeah, so the Smart Fridge,

79
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,920
Speaker 4:  the main thing I use it for is watching tv.

80
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:58,960
Speaker 2:  Sure.

81
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,440
Speaker 4:  I mean I have a TV not too far away, but you know, if my family's watching

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,160
Speaker 4:  something in the, in the living room, it has the Samsung TV plus

83
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,720
Speaker 4:  app in it. I get like a little screen and I can watch some tennis.

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,480
Speaker 2:  Nice.

85
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,160
Speaker 4:  Okay. So it's my kitchen TV primarily. The fridge

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,560
Speaker 4:  itself is great though. It's a great fridge, plenty of room. It has cameras

87
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,520
Speaker 4:  in it. So if I am at the grocery store and can't remember if I've got

88
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,200
Speaker 4:  something, you can look on the app on your phone and see what

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Speaker 4:  what you've got. It also has recipes and a number of other things you

90
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,840
Speaker 4:  can do with it. It's a smart things hub so I can technically control

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,600
Speaker 4:  smart devices from it. But in the kitchen I like to be hands free.

92
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,640
Speaker 4:  So I have my voice assistants and I have to say

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,480
Speaker 4:  the Amazon is the one that I use the most in the kitchen. It

94
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,760
Speaker 4:  has some of the better features. I really like its timer feature.

95
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,920
Speaker 4:  I also like the Echo Show 10 because it

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,360
Speaker 4:  moves with you. So when if you're trying to follow a recipe

97
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,840
Speaker 4:  and you're walking around the kitchen, it kind of follows you. It's a bit

98
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,160
Speaker 4:  creepy but it's handy.

99
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,040
Speaker 2:  I do feel like you're like one small step away from being like, and here

100
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,440
Speaker 2:  is my tiny robot that follows me around my house and is my sous chef all

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,960
Speaker 2:  the like this, this is coming for you. You know this right? It

102
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,200
Speaker 4:  Is. Well I had the astro here for a while. He would've actually, it would've

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,880
Speaker 4:  been very helpful as a sous chef. But we we, yes. My

104
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,920
Speaker 4:  favorite sous chef though is the Therma mix, which many

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,800
Speaker 4:  people listening may not be familiar

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,920
Speaker 2:  With. I'm certainly not.

107
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,960
Speaker 4:  It's a fantastic kitchen gadget. I mentioned not a big

108
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,600
Speaker 4:  gadget fan in general. I like things that just do one thing good

109
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,760
Speaker 4:  and don't necessarily mean that I have to clean a ton of parts

110
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,640
Speaker 4:  afterwards or you know, read a manual to figure out how to use it.

111
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,080
Speaker 4:  I want something that's just gonna cook my dinner, help me cook my dinner.

112
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,920
Speaker 4:  The biggest thing is not have to clean up so many gadgets. You spend half

113
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Speaker 4:  the time pulling them apart and cleaning them. This thing cleans itself,

114
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,520
Speaker 4:  which is like the number one thing you need to know about it. So you don't

115
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,600
Speaker 4:  have any wash to do afterwards. And you can also stick the whole thing in

116
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,120
Speaker 4:  the dishwasher.

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,880
Speaker 2:  Oh I love that.

118
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,040
Speaker 4:  But to explain what a Therma mix is, it's a company that's

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Speaker 4:  been around for a really long time. European listeners will probably be familiar

120
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,880
Speaker 4:  with it. It started as a blender company and now they've come out, well

121
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,400
Speaker 4:  this has been around for a few years. The Therma Mix is a blender that cooks.

122
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,400
Speaker 4:  So that's kind of the easiest way to explain it. So I just made

123
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,360
Speaker 4:  before we got on air mashed potatoes in my blender or

124
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,040
Speaker 4:  in the Therma mix and they came out perfectly and now

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,360
Speaker 4:  I'm going to make pumpkin pie cheesecake in my blender.

126
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,520
Speaker 2:  Is it like a slow cooker in that you just like dump a bunch of stuff in and

127
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
Speaker 2:  like stuff happens and then it's done but it does it for like other kinds

128
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,080
Speaker 2:  of food?

129
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,000
Speaker 4:  So actually it can be a slow cooker, it can be

130
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,280
Speaker 4:  multiple things. It, it can be a pressure cooker, a slow cooker. It can boil

131
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,600
Speaker 4:  eggs. I mean it, it does hundreds of things. Wow. It's, it's pretty neat.

132
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,800
Speaker 4:  But what I use it for is, as I said, as like a sous chef. So

133
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,680
Speaker 4:  it does little jobs for me. So for example, I'm gonna make

134
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,320
Speaker 4:  pumpkin pie with a cookie crume crust. So

135
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,160
Speaker 4:  instead of getting out the rolling pin and a plastic Ziploc bag

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,240
Speaker 4:  and sticking the ground crackers in and smashing away, although that is really

137
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,040
Speaker 4:  fun, I can just throw the ground crackers into

138
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,840
Speaker 4:  the Therma mix and it has a little recipe so it has a screen,

139
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,840
Speaker 4:  a little Android touch screen and you follow along on the recipes on there

140
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,800
Speaker 4:  and it will blend the CRAs for me and then it will

141
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,760
Speaker 4:  melt the butter and cook them. So then I can just pour the

142
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,680
Speaker 4:  pie base into my pie pan and then I give it a rinse and

143
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,560
Speaker 4:  then I can put all the ingredients for the pie filling and it'll

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,120
Speaker 4:  mix them for me. So it's a bit like a like KitchenAid. Yeah as well.

145
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,040
Speaker 4:  Except for if you're cooking something like the pie base, it will cook

146
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,800
Speaker 4:  it for you. Cooked my mashed potatoes. I also did the stuffing in it this

147
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,320
Speaker 4:  morning. Cooked the onions and the sausage before they went in the Turkey.

148
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,680
Speaker 4:  So it's a really handy sort of extra pair of hands. Don't have to do as

149
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,760
Speaker 4:  much chopping, although you know I still have to do some because you can't

150
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,200
Speaker 4:  put like a whole potato in it it cuz it would kind of vibrate and explode.

151
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,560
Speaker 4:  So you do have to chop the potato up before you put it in. And as as

152
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,040
Speaker 4:  I mentioned, it also cleans itself. So all you have to do is put a little

153
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,880
Speaker 4:  bit of water soap, press clean button and it goes

154
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,720
Speaker 4:  and comes out clean and then you do the next stage. I know some people will

155
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,320
Speaker 4:  have two or three of its so it has like a blender, a stainless steel

156
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,680
Speaker 4:  blender, that's what heats up and you can have multiple of those so that

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,640
Speaker 4:  you can rotate and cook different things. It also steams, so I'm

158
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,520
Speaker 4:  gonna do the green beans at the end of the cooking process has what's

159
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,400
Speaker 4:  called a aroma dish that you put on the top and it heats up from

160
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,600
Speaker 4:  the blender and steams the food for you. So you could do fish

161
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,600
Speaker 4:  in there as well. And I'm gonna do green beans.

162
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,760
Speaker 2:  This is also like perfectly speaking my kitchen gadget language

163
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,920
Speaker 2:  cuz to me it's like I don't mind figuring out what temperature something

164
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,040
Speaker 2:  needs to be and I don't really mind just like setting a timer and checking

165
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,880
Speaker 2:  it. But if you can prevent me from needing to chop things or do

166
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,560
Speaker 2:  dishes, I'm all in like fall in. Yes.

167
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,120
Speaker 2:  That sounds wonderful to me.

168
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,920
Speaker 4:  It is though. The downside. Oh hang on the Turkey time is going off. Timer

169
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Speaker 4:  is done. All right, time to get the Turkey out the oven before it overcooks.

170
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,760
Speaker 4:  There we go. Alexa, stop Turkey timer.

171
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,080
Speaker 4:  All right, sorry about that. Didn't mean to interrupt you David. You're right.

172
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,840
Speaker 4:  It is a great gadget. It does cost quite a bit though

173
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,280
Speaker 4:  as kitchen getts a want to do. Unfortunately it's

174
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,080
Speaker 4:  $1,500 for the whole sort of package and then there's

175
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,680
Speaker 4:  lots of add-ons that you can, that you can buy basically. I like to say it

176
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,920
Speaker 4:  kind of make everything but the Turkey.

177
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,200
Speaker 2:  How's the Turkey looking? Speaking of the

178
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,040
Speaker 4:  Turkey is is looking really good. Let's have a look. I'm looking at my

179
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Speaker 4:  probes. It looks like we are right on, we have the right temperature

180
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,600
Speaker 4:  but the little red thing is still saying that we don't but I'm not putting

181
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,640
Speaker 4:  it back in there. I'm not coming out with charcoal Turkey.

182
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think we're good. I'm just gonna let this sit now. I think it can

183
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,200
Speaker 4:  sit an hour or more. So we've got our mashed potatoes, we've got our Turkey,

184
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,520
Speaker 4:  the green means I'm gonna do at the end my foil

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,200
Speaker 4:  and then I thought seen as we've got a little party here,

186
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,200
Speaker 4:  it might be a good time to make a cocktail cuz that's kind of the best part

187
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,880
Speaker 4:  of Thanksgiving.

188
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,840
Speaker 2:  I agree with

189
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,320
Speaker 4:  That. I mentioned I have the Echo show 10, which I will use sometime for

190
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,680
Speaker 4:  recipes but I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to recipes

191
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,440
Speaker 4:  and unfortunately the ones that come up on the echo aren't always great.

192
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,280
Speaker 4:  So my go-to is actually my iPad mini.

193
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,600
Speaker 4:  This is the best sort of kitchen companion for cooking I find.

194
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,720
Speaker 2:  I totally agree.

195
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,200
Speaker 4:  Do you do a lot of cooking David?

196
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,960
Speaker 2:  So I like to cook. My wife doesn't really let me cook because

197
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,000
Speaker 2:  she's a control freak is essentially what it is. She'll never hear this podcast

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,320
Speaker 2:  so it's okay. I can, I can say all this stuff that I want. I like to cook

199
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,760
Speaker 2:  and I agree, I like experimented with a million different kitchen gadgets,

200
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,720
Speaker 2:  tried all the different, you know, echoes with the screen and the

201
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,560
Speaker 2:  the nest stuff and also landed on an iPad and it's like what I do

202
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,440
Speaker 2:  is I watch, watch a show on the iPad with the recipe in the

203
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,240
Speaker 2:  slide overview and it is, it is perfect. It solves all my problems. I love

204
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,400
Speaker 2:  it.

205
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,200
Speaker 4:  Well my favorite thing about the iPad is actually the New York Times

206
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,680
Speaker 4:  cooking app, which is my favorite cooking app. It's very good. Some really

207
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,560
Speaker 4:  good recipes on there. And then my other favorite thing is

208
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,480
Speaker 4:  she doesn't have an app sadly but is Delia Smith who's England's

209
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,760
Speaker 4:  version of Martha Stewart. She's the woman that taught me how to cook and

210
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,480
Speaker 4:  she doesn't have an app, she's not tech like that but I can just pull up

211
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,200
Speaker 4:  her website. She is who I am following for my Turkey. I've always, always

212
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,760
Speaker 4:  gone to Delia. So yes, use the iPad. That's sort of key

213
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,720
Speaker 4:  for me. And then I also, I love having the Alexa because

214
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,040
Speaker 4:  it has, I have this fun routine set up where when I

215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,320
Speaker 4:  start running water it'll start playing music for me, which I've turned off

216
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,160
Speaker 4:  for today cuz I didn't wanna interrupt our recording but every time I turn

217
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,000
Speaker 4:  the tap on it'll start the radio for me. So just, you know when you get in

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,800
Speaker 4:  the kitchen you start cooking, sometimes you forget to put music on and it's

219
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,560
Speaker 4:  a nice nice little feature. Speaking of water, my

220
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720
Speaker 4:  absolute favorite gadget in my kitchen alongside the Therma mix is

221
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,600
Speaker 4:  my handsfree voice activated Moen smart faucet.

222
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,000
Speaker 2:  Okay that is so many words that I've never heard people use next

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,480
Speaker 2:  to faucet. Is it one of the ones you like wave in front of when your arms

224
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,000
Speaker 2:  are dirty? Is that the kind of stuff we're talking about? Okay,

225
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,920
Speaker 4:  So yes, that's the sort of main function and you don't need to connect it

226
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,400
Speaker 4:  to the internet for that. You can just wave your hand in front, starts the

227
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,280
Speaker 4:  water and then wave again and it stops and then it has a handle for hot and

228
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,080
Speaker 4:  cold. But if you wanna get fancy and when you know

229
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,960
Speaker 4:  when you're cooking, your hands are always busy or covered

230
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,920
Speaker 4:  in Turkey or sausage or you may be a little way away and you want it to

231
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,280
Speaker 4:  be hot when you get over there. So I can say and I can do the little demo

232
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,080
Speaker 4:  for you now if you like please Alexa, tell Moen to

233
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,160
Speaker 4:  dispense two cups of warm water.

234
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,840
Speaker 5:  First I will run the water to temperature, wait for the water

235
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,800
Speaker 5:  to stop when the light is solid you can wave over sensor for two

236
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,960
Speaker 5:  cups of water at 105 degrees.

237
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,840
Speaker 4:  So as a soon to be father congratulations by the way. I haven't

238
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,640
Speaker 4:  had a chance to to send my congratulations yet but

239
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,400
Speaker 4:  this is great. Okay, so now the radio is

240
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,320
Speaker 4:  playing because the water is running.

241
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,800
Speaker 4:  Okay, sorry

242
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,120
Speaker 2:  This is an unbelievably good idea. I'm now all in on the, every time I turn

243
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Speaker 2:  on the water it should, I thought that was crazy until you did it and now

244
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
Speaker 2:  I'm like this is the best idea I've ever heard.

245
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,280
Speaker 4:  It was fun. You see it gets a little, you know, festive in the, I love it

246
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,120
Speaker 4:  in the kitchen. So it's now running the water two temperature

247
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,240
Speaker 4:  and as I say, as a soon to be father, it's great for baby bottles because

248
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,280
Speaker 4:  you can get the exact temperature you need

249
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,880
Speaker 2:  Totally

250
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,720
Speaker 4:  For your baby bottle. I'm beyond that stage. So right now

251
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,600
Speaker 4:  I'm running the water to get hot enough for

252
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,720
Speaker 4:  the pie. Once it shows me that it's at the right temperature,

253
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Speaker 4:  it's flashing right now and it's getting hot. Takes a while cuz I have a

254
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,280
Speaker 4:  tankless hot water heater, which is very efficient but also very slow.

255
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,240
Speaker 4:  And then once I go over to it now I'll stop it from running

256
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,040
Speaker 4:  and then I wave again and it will dispense exactly two cups into my bowl

257
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,720
Speaker 4:  for me. So I'm gonna like that. I will do that now. Just gonna grab my bowl.

258
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,680
Speaker 4:  Oh it stopped and now

259
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,040
Speaker 4:  and I got my two cups of water, 104 degrees. I don't have

260
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,840
Speaker 4:  a thermometer handy that's not in a Turkey to test but it

261
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,920
Speaker 4:  feels warm. You

262
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,720
Speaker 2:  Know the thing where you walk over the faucet with like the tablespoon or

263
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,440
Speaker 2:  whatever and you turn on the water too hard and it just like explodes the

264
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,960
Speaker 2:  water all over your entire kitchen. This solves that problem. This is like

265
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,040
Speaker 2:  it does, this is what you're talking about. This is like an actual thing

266
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,280
Speaker 2:  that you do in the kitchen that this makes better and that makes me happy.

267
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,680
Speaker 4:  Yes it is, it's very handy. I mean to be honest the main thing I

268
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,320
Speaker 4:  use is the waving, but when I'm full on cooking a big dinner,

269
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,320
Speaker 4:  it definitely is very helpful

270
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,280
Speaker 2:  And it's fewer dishes. I hate washing measuring cups, I don't know why

271
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,280
Speaker 2:  I just hate it. And for little things like that, like I guess this one's

272
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,920
Speaker 2:  just water so you don't need to wash it anyway but like

273
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,840
Speaker 4:  But you got it wet, you have to put it on the drying rack. Yeah,

274
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,560
Speaker 2:  It's a whole thing.

275
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah actually that's another thing that's really fun about the Therma mix,

276
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,720
Speaker 4:  just to go back to it, but it's at the top of the Thema mix, it's lid

277
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,800
Speaker 4:  is a built in measuring cup so it's very well thought out.

278
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,920
Speaker 4:  But yes, so I've got my smart fort, I got my smart fridge, got

279
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,800
Speaker 4:  my semi smart oven, my Thema mix, my smart

280
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,560
Speaker 4:  voice assistance. What else? Oh I have an indoor air quality

281
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,000
Speaker 4:  monitor. Okay. Amazon's indoor air quality monitor and

282
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,080
Speaker 4:  that doesn't have a ton of use but I do

283
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,760
Speaker 4:  like that when I, if I've forgotten or one of my other smart

284
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,680
Speaker 4:  devices have failed me, it will send an alert through one of my

285
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,600
Speaker 4:  smart speakers if the indoor air quality is turned to pour, which often

286
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,560
Speaker 4:  happens when you're cooking on a gas stove, which is what I have and might

287
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,080
Speaker 4:  alert me that something's burning.

288
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,840
Speaker 2:  Well I was gonna say isn't the answer to that. This is, you know what, what

289
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,280
Speaker 2:  we hear in in America have smoke alarms for, I dunno if you're aware

290
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,760
Speaker 4:  Of this, it gets you there a little bit before the smoke alarm comes. Okay,

291
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,880
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. The gas thing actually makes sense that you're like, if I leave

292
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,760
Speaker 2:  a burner on, it'll tell me before my house explodes. Like yeah, that's fair.

293
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,440
Speaker 4:  It gives me a little heads up, reminds me. But yes, by the time

294
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,480
Speaker 4:  it, you know, things start to burn. Yeah I do have some smoke alarms

295
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,520
Speaker 2:  Around. I will say the thing that occurs to me as you're talking is that

296
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,240
Speaker 2:  you have an enormous number of screens in your kitchen and yet you just do

297
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,160
Speaker 2:  everything on your iPad mini. This feels very telling to me about how all

298
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,680
Speaker 2:  of these screens actually do their jobs.

299
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,960
Speaker 4:  Yes, I have a Google Nest hub max right here too, which

300
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,760
Speaker 4:  also has a big screen and yeah they're just not

301
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,280
Speaker 4:  designed well enough yet. The interface isn't good for

302
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,040
Speaker 4:  kitchen use, it's fine for playing a video, you know, or watching

303
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,840
Speaker 4:  TV or music. I mean I use, and the timers are the main thing

304
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,760
Speaker 4:  I use it for. The nice thing about the Nest hub timer is it

305
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,720
Speaker 4:  will show in like really big numbers the timer counting down

306
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,840
Speaker 4:  but actually the echo that I'm using that you heard just recently, it's

307
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,240
Speaker 4:  the echo dot with clock. So that also has the little l e d screen

308
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,320
Speaker 4:  that shows the time counting down. So rather than having to constantly

309
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,880
Speaker 4:  ask how long is left on my timer, I can just glance and have a look.

310
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,000
Speaker 4:  The stove also has a timer on it, but that's not as convenient cuz it's

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Speaker 4:  not an eye level. But yeah, I'm looking forward to the Google Nest

312
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,880
Speaker 4:  tablet that's gonna be, yes, that's gonna mount to the speaker

313
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,080
Speaker 4:  because I feel like the tablet experience is what you really need in

314
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,640
Speaker 4:  the kitchen. The smart displays just aren't at that level

315
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,640
Speaker 4:  and this tablet built into the fridge is just a little outdated.

316
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,640
Speaker 4:  It's not fast enough. It's an older Android tablet. It crashes though.

317
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,520
Speaker 4:  I, I don't find that one is useful. So yes, the mini, the iPads the way

318
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:45,760
Speaker 4:  to go.

319
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no I, there are a bunch of things you've described here that I think

320
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,480
Speaker 2:  are like very good, very smart ideas. I continue to think smart fridges might

321
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,280
Speaker 2:  just be a terrible idea. Like my fridge is some unknowable

322
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,040
Speaker 2:  number of years old, but like it keeps my food cold and until it doesn't

323
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,720
Speaker 2:  keep my food cold I'm good. But like to worry about like the, the

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,680
Speaker 2:  security updates to the Android operating system on my fridge is just like

325
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,440
Speaker 2:  not a thing I need in my life. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna stick to my old ass

326
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,920
Speaker 2:  fridge and an iPad and it's gonna serve me just fine.

327
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,320
Speaker 4:  I mean Smart Fridge has had such great promise when they first came on the,

328
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,920
Speaker 4:  the scene and the idea, the thing that I really liked the concept I was looking

329
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,680
Speaker 4:  forward to and Samsung made some good strides here but it hasn't really

330
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,120
Speaker 4:  capitalized yet, is telling you when you're low on something

331
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,440
Speaker 4:  and automatically we ordering it for you. It does have food

332
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,160
Speaker 4:  recognition based in using the camera and it will tell you what products

333
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,760
Speaker 4:  you have in your fridge and then it can say you are running low on this,

334
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,440
Speaker 4:  you might want to order more, but it's so unreliable, it misses things

335
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,800
Speaker 4:  so they're working on it. And I think once we got to a point where a fridge

336
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,760
Speaker 4:  could really do that, maybe with sensors, you know to see how much weight

337
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,320
Speaker 4:  you had left. So your milk carton weighed, you know, 50%

338
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,040
Speaker 4:  less this morning than yesterday so you probably need to order milk. Those

339
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,520
Speaker 4:  kind of things will be useful, especially if they reorder for you automatically.

340
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,320
Speaker 4:  The one thing my fridge constantly wants me to do though is reorder my water

341
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,120
Speaker 4:  filter every morning it says your water filter

342
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,800
Speaker 4:  expired, would you like to reorder it? I'm like, no, I don't wanna spend

343
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,760
Speaker 4:  a hundred dollars on water filter, I'm just gonna use my tap. Thank you very

344
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:15,960
Speaker 4:  much.

345
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,840
Speaker 2:  Those are the things that make you realize like I had a Brita for a long

346
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,960
Speaker 2:  time and it was like they would be the thing that would like the red light

347
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,680
Speaker 2:  that would say, you know, you're supposed to change your filter. And it was

348
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,200
Speaker 2:  like, oh I'm supposed to change this thing like 10 times more often

349
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,960
Speaker 2:  than I actually change this thing. Which is just like once

350
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,080
Speaker 2:  every two years when I think about it while I'm at Target is how often I

351
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,320
Speaker 2:  replace it. So yeah, I just, I don't need to know all that stuff I guess.

352
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,520
Speaker 2:  All right, we need to take a break and when we come back we're gonna talk

353
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,480
Speaker 2:  about a bunch of stuff I've seen in your kitchen As we're moving around I

354
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,280
Speaker 2:  see a bunch of beverage things. So we're gonna talk about smart beverages

355
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,800
Speaker 2:  because this is a thing that is near and dear to my heart and we're gonna

356
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,240
Speaker 2:  check on that Turkey, we'll be right back.

357
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,440
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back with Jennifer Patterson Tuy. Jen, I have

358
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,360
Speaker 2:  two gadget questions for you and they're both about beverages.

359
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,480
Speaker 2:  One, have we solved coffee in the smart home? Do you have

360
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,040
Speaker 2:  anything? Have you tested anything? Is there anything That's good cuz that's

361
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,880
Speaker 2:  the one I wanna wake up to. Perfect coffee every morning. It doesn't seem

362
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,320
Speaker 2:  to exist yet.

363
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,400
Speaker 4:  Well I have here a GE cafe smart

364
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,640
Speaker 4:  espresso maker. This is the ATO automatic

365
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,040
Speaker 4:  espresso machine. So I mean it, you know coffee is

366
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,840
Speaker 4:  very subjective so I don't know what your perfect

367
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,840
Speaker 4:  cup is but my husband loves this thing because it's

368
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,440
Speaker 4:  one of the ones where you press a button and it dispenses an espresso for

369
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,080
Speaker 4:  you. So you can connect it to an app and then you can dial in your

370
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,560
Speaker 4:  exact like grind time bruise, strength,

371
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,560
Speaker 4:  how many ounces you want your espresso to be. You can do long

372
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,840
Speaker 4:  espressos, you could do double espressos and all you do is press this one

373
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
Speaker 4:  button, it's called my cup in the morning and then it'll just dispense that

374
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,520
Speaker 4:  for you. Which it's pretty handy. It's nice because I mean there's lots of

375
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,200
Speaker 4:  automatic espresso machines out there. They're all quite expensive. This

376
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,000
Speaker 4:  one is two, I wanna say it's around $700. Oof. But this one has,

377
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,960
Speaker 4:  because the app connection gives you that customization. So it has

378
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,680
Speaker 4:  its regular buttons. You've got espresso Americano and

379
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,600
Speaker 4:  then mic up. And the mic up is the one you can customize. And then it also

380
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,320
Speaker 4:  has the milk frother, which is not automatic

381
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,160
Speaker 4:  obviously. You just still have to stand there with your little pot.

382
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,320
Speaker 4:  Who

383
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,880
Speaker 2:  Has the time? Jen who has the time, the time for that. Thermomix should do

384
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,520
Speaker 2:  that for you. You should just be able to pour your coffee into the thermo

385
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,840
Speaker 2:  mix and it'll froth it for you.

386
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,720
Speaker 4:  But he drinks black coffee so it doesn't bother him. But it is been great

387
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,320
Speaker 4:  for eggnog lattes this so far this season.

388
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,280
Speaker 2:  So it sounds like the hybrid of like an espresso and an actual fancy

389
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,600
Speaker 2:  espresso machine.

390
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,640
Speaker 4:  Yes. And it's not like huge either. It's nice and

391
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,480
Speaker 4:  compact which oh nice is because those big fancy espresso machines like take

392
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,840
Speaker 4:  up half your kitchen counter.

393
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,240
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah, they're nuts. I have tried many times to buy one and my wife who

394
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,720
Speaker 2:  doesn't drink coffee is just straight up. I'm always like, that would be

395
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,440
Speaker 2:  a cool present for you to get me sometimes. And she's just like absolutely

396
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,480
Speaker 2:  not. Like I have to look at that thing all day and never use it. Absolutely

397
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,640
Speaker 2:  not.

398
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,720
Speaker 4:  Oh this one's quite pretty actually it's white with rose gold accents

399
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,560
Speaker 4:  so she might like it.

400
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,760
Speaker 2:  All right. Okay so then the other one is another beverage thing

401
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,280
Speaker 2:  that I'm very curious about which is like a, I want something that is like

402
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,840
Speaker 2:  better and more automatic than a soda stream for like making

403
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,920
Speaker 2:  my own fizzy stuff. I've like gone down the road of like

404
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,800
Speaker 2:  should I drill a faucet into my, like I

405
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,760
Speaker 2:  drink an like an inappropriate amount of and I'm like these,

406
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,680
Speaker 2:  I just want a tap in my house where I can just make seltzer. Does this exist?

407
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,640
Speaker 2:  Do you have the answer for me?

408
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,160
Speaker 4:  I do, I do. I'm excited to do this is something you wanted cuz it's not something

409
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,480
Speaker 4:  I'd ever really considered but

410
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,320
Speaker 2:  This is my dream. Like literally like a a better than soda stream, semi

411
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,160
Speaker 2:  smartt way to just make sparkling water all day is like there's a

412
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,480
Speaker 2:  terrifying amount of money and effort that I would spend to do this.

413
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,840
Speaker 4:  $130

414
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,840
Speaker 2:  Sold literally. Yes. Done. Tell me the website. I'm there.

415
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,400
Speaker 4:  So have you used soda streams? Cause I've never used a soda stream. Like

416
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,240
Speaker 4:  I never really got the thing, it was so big in my childhood. But the big

417
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,760
Speaker 4:  selling point of this one, it's called a, it's called the Sparkle and it's

418
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,600
Speaker 4:  also I believe German. Okay. Is you don't need the carbonator, you

419
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Speaker 4:  don't need the like canister I guess is what you need to use in a soda stream.

420
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

421
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,960
Speaker 2:  Okay. And the problem was just to tell you why Soda Stream sucks, there was

422
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,240
Speaker 2:  a whole big controversy about Soda Stream that I never really understood

423
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,440
Speaker 2:  so I didn't worry about that. But the real problem was you have to go like

424
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,680
Speaker 2:  take your canister to get it replaced at like Target or a handful of places

425
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,560
Speaker 2:  and they're always out and nobody ever has any stock so you just have to

426
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,280
Speaker 2:  like go to Target every day and be like, do you new soda streams? And they

427
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,160
Speaker 2:  say no and then you leave and it's like it's a nightmare. And so I

428
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,200
Speaker 2:  eventually just gave up and this is why I'm like, I want a thing that lasts

429
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,960
Speaker 2:  longer at my home that would solve this problem for me.

430
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,040
Speaker 4:  Well so this machine is, I said it's called the Sparkle but it

431
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,600
Speaker 4:  has a little umla thing on the E cuz it's German and it uses,

432
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,280
Speaker 4:  it uses sas.

433
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:11,880
Speaker 2:  Oh

434
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,800
Speaker 4:  Carbonator sas. So I mean not so environmentally friendly

435
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,280
Speaker 4:  cuz there's lots of little pieces of plastic but as opposed to these big

436
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,160
Speaker 4:  carbonated pressure canisters perhaps I,

437
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,080
Speaker 4:  I'd have to do the the green work there. But so there's two sass

438
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,160
Speaker 4:  that come wrapped together and the sparkle came with a ton of them,

439
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,080
Speaker 4:  like a big bag of them. So you use one every time you have a drink.

440
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,240
Speaker 4:  Oh you just snip the top off and you pour it into a little canister at the

441
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,160
Speaker 4:  back and then it's a very kind of space aging machine. I can actually, actually

442
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,520
Speaker 4:  I will do one right now if you like do it and we can hear it. You can make

443
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,880
Speaker 4:  anything, you could just do yourself. So water if you wanted or you could

444
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,240
Speaker 4:  do like a mimosa.

445
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,760
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah, you were gonna make us a cocktail

446
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,840
Speaker 4:  For today. I was gonna make us a Thanksgiving themed

447
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,120
Speaker 4:  pineapple and sage cocktail. How does that sound? Sold?

448
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,600
Speaker 2:  I

449
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,400
Speaker 4:  Love this. Okay so it's quite the

450
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,160
Speaker 4:  machine, it has this bottle that you fill up with your

451
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,880
Speaker 4:  desired ingredients and the kind of a selling point here is that you can

452
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,480
Speaker 4:  use anything that's in your home like a fresh juice, you can put sage in

453
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,040
Speaker 4:  it, like fresh sage. You could also, I did one with some rosemary spriggs

454
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,600
Speaker 4:  from my garden. It's like an infuse. So as well as doing

455
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,480
Speaker 4:  the carbonating also kind of infuses your water with flavor.

456
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,360
Speaker 4:  So you can put cucumber or lemon, anything you like. And

457
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,720
Speaker 4:  I believe all I need to put in this one for my pineapple surprise

458
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,120
Speaker 4:  is pieces of pineapple which I've got here. So I'm gonna put in

459
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,040
Speaker 4:  a few chunks and then some sage which I

460
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,680
Speaker 4:  also have cuz I had a little leftover from stuffing my Turkey.

461
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,440
Speaker 4:  So we're gonna pop in pineapple chunks, little

462
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,400
Speaker 4:  bit of sage and some water and it

463
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,120
Speaker 4:  says vodka, I'm not a big vodka fan so we're going to put some

464
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,480
Speaker 4:  gin in instead if that

465
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,760
Speaker 2:  I support this, yeah

466
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,920
Speaker 4:  We'll put some pineapple juice

467
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,480
Speaker 4:  and then you just fill it up with water depending on how,

468
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,960
Speaker 4:  how big a drink you like. So one bottle here would make

469
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,320
Speaker 4:  probably three adult drinks and then I'm using the, the

470
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,160
Speaker 4:  smart fridge cuz it the colder the water is the better for

471
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,000
Speaker 4:  the sparkle for some reason I think it's the way the chemicals

472
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,880
Speaker 4:  or are they chemicals? Okay so it uses sodium

473
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,680
Speaker 4:  by carbonate and granulated citric acid. So

474
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,640
Speaker 4:  once you've got your ingredients together and you find the

475
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,360
Speaker 4:  lid pro tip, you have to make sure this thing is on

476
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,280
Speaker 4:  really tight because I sparkled my kitchen floor yesterday.

477
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,200
Speaker 4:  Oh no. Trying to make a apples fizz And I was like, oh that's making

478
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,120
Speaker 4:  a loud noise. And I went over and there was, it was everywhere. That

479
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,280
Speaker 4:  was not fun. But then I called the robot mop over to clean it. So

480
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,840
Speaker 2:  Problem solve.

481
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,240
Speaker 4:  Okay so popping the machine in, there's a little

482
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,920
Speaker 4:  slot at the back here that you lift up and you put your

483
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,760
Speaker 4:  powders in both at the same time. I guess if you mix 'em together, they

484
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,240
Speaker 4:  do something. I'm not, I was never very big at science. So,

485
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,760
Speaker 4:  and then I'm gonna push this big handle down, it'll make a big

486
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,080
Speaker 4:  thud

487
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,800
Speaker 4:  and then can you hear that making its little sparkle noise. And then I've

488
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,640
Speaker 4:  got one through five here. This is the level of carbonation that you can

489
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,400
Speaker 4:  choose. So if you want it super fizzy, you choose five and we'll probably

490
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,280
Speaker 4:  go for four here and then you press the sparkle

491
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,120
Speaker 4:  button and then here it goes

492
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,080
Speaker 4:  and it, it takes a couple minutes but yeah, it'll come out with

493
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,520
Speaker 4:  carbonated water. As I said, I did a mimosa the other day, it was pomegranate

494
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,840
Speaker 4:  and orange juice with white wine.

495
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,680
Speaker 2:  You just found my Christmas present for myself this year. It's very exciting.

496
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, I was, I'm quite impressed. I dunno how many of those saches, I

497
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,600
Speaker 4:  mean if you drink two or three bottles a day of of sparkling water, you'd

498
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,360
Speaker 4:  be getting through some saches but you'd have to kind weigh that with the

499
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,080
Speaker 4:  Soda stream debacle

500
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,600
Speaker 2:  Or in my case just the number of cans I crush and throw into

501
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,840
Speaker 2:  the recycling, which is bad. Oh

502
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,640
Speaker 4:  There you go. Yeah. This much better. Much better for the environment than

503
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,040
Speaker 4:  that. Yes,

504
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,080
Speaker 2:  I think so. Alright, so let's talk through a couple of of Thanksgiving things

505
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,800
Speaker 2:  just to, just to get a a feel for how this works. So like let's,

506
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,360
Speaker 2:  let's do Turkey first we're at like the end of the Turkey process. You've

507
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,200
Speaker 2:  successfully turkeyed congratulations. But like you,

508
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,000
Speaker 2:  you come home with a, with a frozen Turkey, you throw it in the

509
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,360
Speaker 2:  smart fridge then what? Walk me through the process.

510
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,000
Speaker 4:  Okay, so according to Delia who is my queen of the kitchen, you

511
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,520
Speaker 4:  wanna get your Turkey out the night before because you want the Turkey

512
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,520
Speaker 4:  to be at sort of room temperature or below before it goes

513
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,320
Speaker 4:  in the oven because that helps it cook more evenly because it's so hard to

514
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,160
Speaker 4:  get the balance right between crisping the Turkey and making sure it's cooked

515
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,720
Speaker 4:  nicely inside. So yeah, bring it up. Oh sparkle has stopped

516
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,240
Speaker 4:  sparkling.

517
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,320
Speaker 2:  We are sparkled.

518
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,080
Speaker 4:  We are sparkled. Whoa. It's like a spaceship taking

519
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,400
Speaker 4:  off.

520
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah that was quite the noise. That's a sparkly, sparkly sounded thing right

521
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,240
Speaker 4:  There and it might be a little early for gin but yeah here's my,

522
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,440
Speaker 4:  there we go. It's steaming. It's like a witches brew.

523
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Wow. I guess I should have had the cup ready to go

524
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,040
Speaker 4:  so yeah. Oh that's got some, that's got some kick. The nice thing about this

525
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Speaker 4:  machine is you could like leave it out on your counter when your guests arrive

526
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,360
Speaker 4:  and they could each make themselves their own their own Thanksgiving cocktail.

527
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,920
Speaker 2:  That is nice. That's a good looking drink. Cheer well done. Cheers.

528
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,920
Speaker 2:  Next year I just want this on record. I'm coming to your house and we're

529
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,200
Speaker 2:  doing this, we're doing this in person next year. Oh

530
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,720
Speaker 4:  That's good.

531
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,160
Speaker 4:  Okay. Sorry Turkey out the night before and then in

532
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,080
Speaker 4:  the morning and I did this this morning which was kind of cheeky but it was

533
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,880
Speaker 4:  kind of early. You do have to get the Turkey in the oven kind of before dawn

534
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,480
Speaker 4:  if you're going to eat around lunchtime. So I was able to whip out the phone

535
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,400
Speaker 4:  and open the the Home connect app which is the Thermador app.

536
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,880
Speaker 4:  Thermador is owned by Bosch and that's Bosch's main

537
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,720
Speaker 4:  smart home app which actually works with quite a few different manufacturers

538
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,200
Speaker 4:  and it works with Alexa and Google so you've got voice control.

539
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,360
Speaker 4:  But yeah, so I whipped out the app and I was able to set the temperature

540
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,640
Speaker 4:  that I wanted the oven app. Can you say that again, sorry.

541
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,640
Speaker 4:  Alexa is talking to me from my fridge

542
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,400
Speaker 4:  and showing me a polar bear for some reason. Okay. So then I

543
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,920
Speaker 4:  was able to set the oven from the comfort of my bed and didn't need to get

544
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,560
Speaker 4:  outta bed for an extra 45 minutes while the oven heated up and then

545
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,280
Speaker 4:  used the Therma mix to make the stuffing. So we did did

546
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,080
Speaker 4:  onions, sage, some other herbs, popped

547
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,560
Speaker 4:  it in the Therma mix, gave it a little whizz for about three or four seconds

548
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,400
Speaker 4:  and then it cooked for about 10 minutes. So it kind of helps with the

549
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,560
Speaker 4:  flavors. Put a little bit of butter in there too, then mixed that in with

550
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,320
Speaker 4:  some sausage and some breadcrumbs. Stuffed it in the Turkey, popped

551
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,440
Speaker 4:  all the probes in the three probes I had

552
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,240
Speaker 4:  for the Turkey today, including, well the four probes and then

553
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,000
Speaker 4:  went in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. That's my

554
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,880
Speaker 4:  favorite trick because you wanna blast it with heat to start with and

555
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,760
Speaker 4:  then cook, I think it's like 12 to 15 minutes

556
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,640
Speaker 4:  per pound so depending on how big your Turkey is and then it'll cook

557
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,520
Speaker 4:  like that for the rest of the cooking time. And that's kind of the

558
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,400
Speaker 4:  extent of the smart part for me because then from that point I just keep

559
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,200
Speaker 4:  an eye on the probe temperature, have an alert on my phone that I can check

560
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,960
Speaker 4:  if I'm not in the kitchen. And then the nice thing about the Weber or

561
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,840
Speaker 4:  Weber, I'm not sure how they pronounce it, grilling hub is

562
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,480
Speaker 4:  that it shows it in nice big numbers on the display which is

563
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,320
Speaker 4:  outside the oven. Got it. So you can just keep an eye on that. And then

564
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,440
Speaker 4:  basing key part of Turkey making, once you get through the

565
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,320
Speaker 4:  main cooking part, then every sort of 10 minutes for the last

566
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,280
Speaker 4:  hour you wanna base now it's gonna sit for

567
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,240
Speaker 4:  about, I think they recommend sort of 60 minutes cuz you want all the juices

568
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,800
Speaker 4:  to sort of reabsorb so that you have nice juicy Turkey

569
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,440
Speaker 4:  breast. And so I will transfer the Turkey out of the

570
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,120
Speaker 4:  roasting pan and use the pan to make

571
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,920
Speaker 4:  some gravy.

572
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,360
Speaker 2:  I have two thoughts about this. One is that it feels very much like we're

573
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,160
Speaker 2:  like one Jetson style robot arm away from

574
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,880
Speaker 2:  this being just like completely all I want is the thing that just like

575
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,160
Speaker 2:  opens your fridge or like your, your Samsung fridge should like

576
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,320
Speaker 2:  catapult the Turkey out of the fridge and into the oven.

577
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,880
Speaker 4:  Would you really want it to do that

578
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,160
Speaker 2:  Then? Yes, if I'm being honest, yes. I really, really would.

579
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,480
Speaker 2:  I dunno if this is a good idea but I do want that to be a thing that I can

580
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,760
Speaker 2:  do very badly. And then the other part is I'm trying to decide like there's

581
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,320
Speaker 2:  still a bunch of like steps in the process. It's definitely fewer

582
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,240
Speaker 2:  and part of me is like is the future for the smart oven that you just like

583
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,120
Speaker 2:  hit a button that says Turkey and then hours later it does all the

584
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,680
Speaker 2:  temperature, it does all the cooking, it does the waiting for 60 minutes

585
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,120
Speaker 2:  for you. It has like a tin foil dispenser at the top that it puts down at

586
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,680
Speaker 2:  the right time and then it's just like Turkey accomplished and you like go

587
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,440
Speaker 2:  and take it out and eat it. And that's like, I feel like where a lot of these

588
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,560
Speaker 2:  companies wanna go but it kind of comes back to the same like I still sort

589
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,240
Speaker 2:  of want to do the cooking here. I don't know like is that, does it feel like

590
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,000
Speaker 2:  the right balance for you of like it doing stuff for you versus kind of making

591
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,880
Speaker 2:  you do some of the steps? Yeah

592
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,320
Speaker 4:  And you know it depends on your level of comfort in the kitchen too.

593
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,440
Speaker 4:  I like to cook, my grandmother was a a cook, that was

594
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,160
Speaker 4:  her job, not a chef. She was a cook, a good old English cook and I loved

595
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,320
Speaker 4:  cooking with her in the kitchen. I like having my daughter help me cook in

596
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,200
Speaker 4:  the kitchen. My son son just baked me brownies last night so I'm passing

597
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,240
Speaker 4:  on the, on the gene. So you know, cooking for me is

598
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,200
Speaker 4:  a sort of experience that I enjoy. It's the way I kind of wind down

599
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,040
Speaker 4:  as well. So I really love it and I show my love to my family through food.

600
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,920
Speaker 4:  So I love to present them with a lovely dish even

601
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,320
Speaker 4:  though it's just the four of us for Thanksgiving this year, my husband and

602
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,120
Speaker 4:  my two children and they don't eat Turkey. So what I am eating a lot of

603
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,200
Speaker 4:  leftovers. So for me this level right

604
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,960
Speaker 4:  now is a good level because it's helping me but

605
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,040
Speaker 4:  it's not overbearing. It's not getting in the way which like a robot arm

606
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,760
Speaker 4:  I feel like might feel a little overbearing. I did see at

607
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,600
Speaker 4:  ces I think last year and the year before, you know they had the kitchen

608
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,680
Speaker 4:  arms that Samsung was demoing that will kind of come

609
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,280
Speaker 4:  down from your hood and chop things and I could imagine that could

610
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,360
Speaker 4:  in theory lift a Turkey up and put it in the oven for you. Totally. But

611
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,080
Speaker 4:  GE has, last year they released a Turkey

612
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,000
Speaker 4:  mode which does what you were just describing. So if you have one of their

613
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,800
Speaker 4:  ovens, they're connected smart ovens, they have a number of different modes

614
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,760
Speaker 4:  where you just press a button, say cooking a pot roast or you

615
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,600
Speaker 4:  are cooking a Turkey or some other sort of

616
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,120
Speaker 4:  dish that needs varying temperatures and has different sort of

617
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,000
Speaker 4:  levels as you go through the process of cooking. And the Turkey

618
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,960
Speaker 4:  mode just which GE showed me a demo, they had

619
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,800
Speaker 4:  their Turkey with lots of probes and they had you know, done all the calculations

620
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,320
Speaker 4:  to get the exact temperatures based on the size of your Turkey

621
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,240
Speaker 4:  and the exact cooking process. And all you had to do was press a button

622
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,360
Speaker 4:  and it comes out perfectly done at the end and when it's finished

623
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,320
Speaker 4:  it, the oven goes gobble gobble. So you know, just

624
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,280
Speaker 4:  for that extra little piece of flare, I don't want

625
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,480
Speaker 4:  my Turkey to gobble cuz that's kind of a bit disturbing actually.

626
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's true.

627
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,120
Speaker 4:  It's well past that point.

628
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,080
Speaker 2:  It should gobble at the beginning and then at the end it should just be like

629
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,480
Speaker 2:  bleak silence. It's just like don't this is, this is

630
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,680
Speaker 2:  just like Darth Vader music at the end. But

631
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah for people who aren't comfortable in the kitchen, I think that's a great

632
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,480
Speaker 4:  feature. You know, you just go by Turkey, stick in the oven, press a button

633
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,280
Speaker 4:  and outcomes a great Turkey. I am not saying that that is what

634
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,120
Speaker 4:  happens. I've never done it myself. If anyone out there has ever done that,

635
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,000
Speaker 4:  I would love to know how good the Turkey mode is. My thermador doesn't do

636
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,880
Speaker 4:  that. My Thermador is much more lets me be in control. Yeah. Which

637
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,520
Speaker 4:  is how I want it in the kitchen to be fair. Other than you know, for

638
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,720
Speaker 4:  mashing the potatoes, I'm happy to have someone else do that for me.

639
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,320
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah, I think you're right that the right answer is probably that

640
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,600
Speaker 2:  there should kind of be a whole spectrum of stuff and even that your oven

641
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,040
Speaker 2:  should be able to give you lots of options, right? Cause there's probably

642
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,800
Speaker 2:  some days where you're just like, I need this to be made and I don't have

643
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,760
Speaker 2:  time to make it Right. And you should be able to just like open a door, shove

644
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,000
Speaker 2:  some stuff in and have it be made. And then there's other times where it's

645
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,360
Speaker 2:  like I wanna be part of the process. It's like it makes me think about self-driving

646
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,680
Speaker 2:  cars, right? Like there will be times you don't wanna drive yourself and

647
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,240
Speaker 2:  times you do and both of those things should be possible and allowed.

648
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah and you know there are the, I mentioned earlier the June oven

649
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,960
Speaker 4:  which I tested a while back and I loved some of the features of that

650
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,920
Speaker 4:  where you could just put dish in or a piece of meat

651
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,520
Speaker 4:  and just say, you know, press a button and it would do the whole process

652
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,280
Speaker 4:  for you. And what I really liked, which I would like in this oven I

653
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,160
Speaker 4:  miss not having is the camera because I like to be able to

654
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,040
Speaker 4:  look inside the oven without opening it. Because as any chef will tell

655
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,000
Speaker 4:  you, every time you open the oven you are messing up the cooking process

656
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,240
Speaker 4:  and being able to look with the camera in at how your

657
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,000
Speaker 4:  turkey's browning or whatever it is that you're cooking is in there, how

658
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,520
Speaker 4:  it's doing. That's useful. That's something I would definitely would like

659
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,440
Speaker 4:  to be able to do with my smart oven. But unfortunately Thermador isn't

660
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,240
Speaker 4:  at that stage. There's also like the air fryers and smart

661
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,160
Speaker 4:  toaster ovens which have these presets and I think

662
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,960
Speaker 4:  it's nice to have the option to be able to, yeah just press a button and

663
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,080
Speaker 4:  you know the chicken nuggets are done and I can focus on the beef bugging

664
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,560
Speaker 4:  on for me and my kids can eat their nuggets.

665
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,120
Speaker 2:  Do all these things talk to each other at all. Obviously you have four voice

666
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,080
Speaker 2:  assistants, which is just absolute chaos and that sounds like a total

667
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,800
Speaker 2:  insane nightmare. But like are they integrated in any meaningful

668
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,680
Speaker 2:  way? All these different gadgets or are you the connective tissue of

669
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,000
Speaker 2:  all this

670
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,800
Speaker 4:  Stuff? So this has been a part of the smart kitchen that has been very

671
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,560
Speaker 4:  slow to evolve and it was an area I think we thought voice assistants would

672
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,480
Speaker 4:  be able to help with. For example, yes my oven can be

673
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,960
Speaker 4:  controlled by the two voice assistants here that Amazon's and Googles.

674
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,600
Speaker 4:  If I had a smart Samsung oven,

675
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,800
Speaker 4:  then the fridge oven would talk to each other. I did not want a

676
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,760
Speaker 4:  Samsung smart Oven cuz I wanted my fma. I'm not, I

677
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,480
Speaker 4:  won't go, won't go further. Samsung ovens don't have a great reputation,

678
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,280
Speaker 4:  but the problem is all of the individual air

679
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,240
Speaker 9:  Quality and your home recently changed to

680
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,880
Speaker 4:  Coral Uhoh. Did you hear that? What are we burning? I think I'm burning my

681
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,640
Speaker 4:  bacon. Have a look. Oh yeah. Ooh it's crispy.

682
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,080
Speaker 4:  Ooh I like crispy bacon.

683
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,480
Speaker 2:  There we go.

684
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,360
Speaker 4:  So this was on top of the Turkey to keep it moist. I, I forgot that to tell

685
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,840
Speaker 4:  you about that step. So yes, the next step in the smart kitchen

686
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,600
Speaker 4:  is this integration and there's been a recent

687
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,320
Speaker 4:  development because the problem is most people have different

688
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,240
Speaker 4:  brands in their kitchen. So I have different smart fridge

689
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,960
Speaker 4:  for my oven and a different brand for my microwave

690
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,800
Speaker 4:  and a different brand for my dishwasher. Sometimes you'll buy all your

691
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,720
Speaker 4:  pieces and parts from one brand but not that often. And then when one thing

692
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,640
Speaker 4:  breaks you might wanna get a different one. So even if you did have

693
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,200
Speaker 4:  all the same pieces, it doesn't necessarily help you with

694
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,160
Speaker 4:  communicating with everything in your home too. For example, my TV

695
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,160
Speaker 4:  can connect to my fridge so when my fridge is telling me the doors open,

696
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,920
Speaker 4:  I get an alert on my tv. But what I'd really like is an alert on my tv.

697
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,920
Speaker 4:  TV that my oven had reached the right temperature. But Thermador,

698
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,240
Speaker 4:  actually Thermador does work with smart things. So it's beginning we're getting

699
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,840
Speaker 4:  these connections. What's happened that's made a big difference and I think

700
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,360
Speaker 4:  will make a big difference probably in the next 12 to 18 months

701
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,480
Speaker 4:  is a new organization called the Home Connectivity Alliance. And

702
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,720
Speaker 4:  this is similar to, and I can't believe we've gotten through this much of

703
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,000
Speaker 4:  a smart home vercast and not mention the word matter. I

704
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,480
Speaker 2:  Blame you, this is all your fault. I'm outrage it took

705
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,240
Speaker 4:  You this long. This is similar to the Matter Alliance, which is where

706
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:09,240
Speaker 4:  a lot of the big companies in the space have got together and

707
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,600
Speaker 4:  are working on a common protocol and communication method.

708
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,440
Speaker 4:  But the difference between Matter and the Home Connectivity Alliance is the

709
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,000
Speaker 4:  Home Connectivity alliance will be entirely cloud-based. So it's basically

710
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,880
Speaker 4:  a way for all the appliance manufacturers to connect their

711
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,560
Speaker 4:  appliances on the backend. And so lg, ge,

712
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,560
Speaker 4:  which is ha Samsung, a number of large

713
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,720
Speaker 4:  H V A C manufacturers are all on board. I think there's

714
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,080
Speaker 4:  even more like they've been announcing new members. This launched about a

715
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,760
Speaker 4:  year, year and a half ago, John, one of our reporters at EFA

716
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,680
Speaker 4:  saw a demo of how these devices will work together and basically

717
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,280
Speaker 4:  you can use Samsung's app, LGS app

718
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,320
Speaker 4:  to control any appliance that's part of this home connectivity alliance.

719
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:58,640
Speaker 4:  So that is a beginning to be, you know, a point where when our

720
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,360
Speaker 4:  appliances talk to each other, then maybe you could start to see some artificial

721
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,120
Speaker 4:  intelligent layers being built on top that could help you get

722
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,880
Speaker 4:  to a more useful smart kitchen in terms of like reordering

723
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,400
Speaker 4:  food or sending recipes from the fridge to the oven,

724
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,400
Speaker 4:  telling the dishwasher it needs to do an extra hard load because you know,

725
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,520
Speaker 4:  you used the deep fat fryer, but at the

726
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,200
Speaker 4:  moment I just don't see a lot of really useful

727
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,160
Speaker 4:  compellingly use cases for consumers. I think

728
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,800
Speaker 4:  the appliance manufacturers need to kind of get that connectivity layer

729
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,760
Speaker 4:  sorted and then maybe start building some good experiences on top

730
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,080
Speaker 4:  of that.

731
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,520
Speaker 2:  Okay, I like it. We're, we're making progress. This is what I like to hear.

732
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,560
Speaker 2:  All right Jen, we're gonna leave you for a few minutes. You need to cook,

733
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,840
Speaker 2:  you need to finish some stuff. We're gonna do the cooking show magic where

734
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,080
Speaker 2:  you just put something in the oven, go to a commercial break, come back and

735
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,800
Speaker 2:  it's finished. We have to talk about dessert. We have a lot more to do. We'll

736
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,200
Speaker 2:  be right back.

737
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,830
Speaker 2:  We're back. Okay Jen, last we left you. You were checking on

738
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,150
Speaker 2:  the Turkey, we didn't burn the house down with the bacon. This is all very

739
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,190
Speaker 2:  good. Catch me up. It's been a couple of hours. Tell me what's been going

740
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,110
Speaker 2:  on, what have you been working on?

741
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,110
Speaker 4:  So yes it has been quiet time, just while the Turkey

742
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:09,590
Speaker 4:  rested, while I have two things left to do, one that we're gonna go through

743
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,310
Speaker 4:  now and then my final thing is the green beans

744
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,070
Speaker 4:  cuz we want those done last so they're nice and crisp and tasty with the

745
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:20,430
Speaker 4:  Turkey. So I did do some gravy, so I got the Turkey

746
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,470
Speaker 4:  out of the pan and I did pan gravy, which is my favorite way to do gravy.

747
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:28,230
Speaker 4:  Didn't need any gadgets for that, just a whisk. But now it's time for

748
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,230
Speaker 4:  pie, which is my favorite part of Thanksgiving.

749
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,670
Speaker 4:  Again, I'm coming back to my trusty Therma mix

750
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,550
Speaker 2:  And this is, we're doing Smart pie, right?

751
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,750
Speaker 4:  No ordinary pie and just to make it, you know, take it up a notch in skill

752
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,510
Speaker 4:  level. We're doing pumpkin cheesecake, not just pumpkin pie

753
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,150
Speaker 2:  Fancy.

754
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,190
Speaker 4:  So I have my spring form pan, which is what you need for cheesecake

755
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,510
Speaker 4:  and now my Therma mix is gonna do most of the work for me.

756
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,190
Speaker 4:  So it's pretty straightforward. As I described before, it has a

757
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:02,070
Speaker 4:  little Android screen, Android powered screen built into the

758
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:06,030
Speaker 4:  Therma mix and once you powered it on, this is the one thing

759
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,430
Speaker 4:  I find it's a little slow.

760
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,310
Speaker 2:  I was just about to say, as soon as you said Android powered screen,

761
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,350
Speaker 2:  I get, I get nervous like

762
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,870
Speaker 4:  Yeah it's a little laggy once it's up and running.

763
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:20,790
Speaker 2:  What kind of icons are we talking about here? How, how like what? Give me

764
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,150
Speaker 2:  a design review of the Thermo Makes interface here.

765
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,150
Speaker 4:  It's actually pretty nice. It's very much custom. It's not something you

766
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,750
Speaker 4:  would recognize the keyboard you would definitely recognize just like on

767
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:33,470
Speaker 4:  any other Android interface. So it's a little laggy

768
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:37,830
Speaker 4:  and I just managed to spell cheesecake wrong so it's not able to find

769
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,230
Speaker 4:  my recipe. But it gives you the option to save. So

770
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,870
Speaker 4:  like before you start Thanksgiving dinner you can go through and like save

771
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,830
Speaker 4:  all the recipes that you want in a little recipe book. So it's really easy

772
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,950
Speaker 4:  to just pull 'em up and tap them so you don't have to go through the whole

773
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,070
Speaker 4:  laggy Android tablet process.

774
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,790
Speaker 2:  Does this connect to some like outside service that you can do the recipes?

775
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,390
Speaker 2:  Like I want this to like integrate with the New York Times cooking app?

776
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,230
Speaker 4:  That would be great. No, actually this is a key point that I didn't mention

777
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,710
Speaker 4:  before. It integrates with its own cooking app, which is called

778
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,630
Speaker 4:  Cookie. Do

779
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,710
Speaker 2:  I hate that?

780
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,230
Speaker 4:  You have to pay, I did forget to mention that. And that is

781
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:19,750
Speaker 4:  actually one of the frustrating things about using the device. It's not too

782
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,590
Speaker 4:  expensive. I wanna say it's $23 a year but without the

783
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,430
Speaker 4:  cookie do subscription. It does all the basic functions that

784
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,800
Speaker 4:  you expect. It doesn't take away the functionality but it's just not as easy

785
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,680
Speaker 4:  cuz it's much easier when you're following a recipe and it's all there

786
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,880
Speaker 4:  for you to just hit the button rather than having to figure it out as you

787
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,680
Speaker 4:  go. But yeah, so the cookie Do app, you can download that onto

788
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,240
Speaker 4:  your smartphone. So you can go in and like add everything, get your

789
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,080
Speaker 4:  recipes ready, you don't have to stand in front of the device to get

790
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:49,640
Speaker 4:  it all set

791
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,880
Speaker 2:  Up. Is there an app for your Samsung Smart Fridge though? That's the real

792
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,120
Speaker 2:  question.

793
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,400
Speaker 4:  No, and they don't, it doesn't integrate at all. There's that whole, going

794
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,000
Speaker 4:  back to the whole, the Smart kitchen just doesn't really talk to it itself

795
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,880
Speaker 4:  yet. There's not enough integration there. Although to be

796
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,680
Speaker 4:  fair, I'm not entirely sure what I would use it for. I was kind of

797
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,040
Speaker 4:  disappointed when I first started using this that it didn't have

798
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,960
Speaker 4:  integrations, but as I've used it, I haven't really found like I needed

799
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,760
Speaker 4:  them. What I do when I'm sometimes going through you working with this is

800
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,640
Speaker 4:  would, you know, add something to my shopping list, which I can do with voice

801
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,320
Speaker 4:  on the Samsung Smart Fridge, which has Alexa built in as well as

802
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
Speaker 4:  Bixby. And I do tend to use Alexa

803
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,800
Speaker 2:  For obvious reasons.

804
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:34,160
Speaker 4:  It's fun to do BPE occasionally. Is it? I feel like someone

805
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,000
Speaker 4:  should use it. It's, it's out there. It's

806
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,200
Speaker 2:  Just a lonely dog butler with shoes just waiting for you to ask it to do

807
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,120
Speaker 2:  something. I get

808
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,680
Speaker 4:  It. So my ther mix is telling me the first step in my pumpkin

809
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,560
Speaker 4:  cheesecake is to preheat my oven. So it's like it gives

810
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,840
Speaker 4:  you all the steps. It's not just what you're doing on the device, which is

811
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,760
Speaker 4:  nice. And then you are gonna grease your pan, which is my spring form

812
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,720
Speaker 4:  pan. And you know, in the grand tradition of all cooking shows,

813
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,400
Speaker 4:  I should have done this earlier. So we're gonna put our unsalted butter

814
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,720
Speaker 4:  cubed into the thermo mix and I'm just gonna grab my knife

815
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,920
Speaker 4:  so we can chop away. So as I mentioned,

816
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,880
Speaker 4:  this doesn't really chop because it's a blender, so if you don't

817
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,680
Speaker 4:  chop things up it gets a bit stuck. So I've added in my butter

818
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,720
Speaker 4:  and then this is the fun part, it uses this thing called a

819
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,640
Speaker 4:  simine basket. So like you can use it to make rice, it's

820
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,160
Speaker 4:  a rice cooker as well. I don't think I mentioned that.

821
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,760
Speaker 4:  I kind of lose track of all the different things this can

822
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,160
Speaker 2:  Do. Well, yeah, I'm kind of, I'm, I'm at the point now where like it does

823
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,800
Speaker 2:  so many things that it's like can it possibly do all of these things well,

824
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,080
Speaker 2:  but it kind of seems like it does.

825
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,360
Speaker 4:  The one thing it doesn't do that well is chop, as I mentioned, like it's

826
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,040
Speaker 4:  good if you want puree, so if you want whipped mashed potatoes, but if

827
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,080
Speaker 4:  you want lumpy mashed potatoes, which you know is a choice, it, it doesn't

828
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,000
Speaker 4:  do that well cuz it'll chop and whip things like a

829
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,600
Speaker 4:  blender. I see again, so if you want like nice little cubes

830
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:05,640
Speaker 4:  in your stew or something, or if you're doing carrots with

831
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,360
Speaker 4:  your Turkey and you want nice little cube carrots, then you might wanna crack

832
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,160
Speaker 4:  out the cuisine art, food processor for that if you've got the time

833
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,240
Speaker 4:  and energy. Okay, so now I've got my butter in here

834
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,160
Speaker 4:  and it's the little Android screen which is quite handy. It has,

835
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,920
Speaker 4:  it's shown me how long it's gonna cook, what temperature it's gonna cook

836
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,760
Speaker 4:  to, and then I turn the dial for the speed and so the

837
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,680
Speaker 4:  slowest speed won't turn everything into mush. Whereas if

838
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,960
Speaker 4:  I do full speed, it's a blender and then you know, I'd get a smoothie

839
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:39,720
Speaker 4:  so you probably just heard it. Then it has two

840
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,200
Speaker 4:  arms on either side that clamp the lid down so that you can't

841
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,200
Speaker 4:  accidentally pull it off while it's cooking and then it's gonna go ahead

842
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,160
Speaker 4:  and cook. It's melting the butter for me, which you know, I could do

843
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,920
Speaker 4:  in the microwave. But then I have to get another bowl out and I have to put

844
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,440
Speaker 4:  in the microwave and I have to check every couple of seconds to make sure

845
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,120
Speaker 4:  it's melted enough. And I haven't burnt the butter, which I always do. So

846
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,000
Speaker 4:  that's melting away. And then I'm getting my cookies out cuz my cookies are

847
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,920
Speaker 4:  gonna be our base rather than using graham

848
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,560
Speaker 4:  crackers, which is the tradition I'm going with ginger snaps just to give

849
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,440
Speaker 4:  a little extra flavor.

850
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,120
Speaker 2:  I like that idea. What does your family think of your smart kitchen

851
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,960
Speaker 2:  insanity? Like do they, are they hopelessly intimidated by trying to cook

852
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,480
Speaker 2:  in your kitchen now? Do they love it?

853
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:26,240
Speaker 4:  So my husband is a bit like you. He loves to cook but I don't let him do

854
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,360
Speaker 4:  it.

855
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,040
Speaker 4:  So he's actually a fireman. So he cooks a lot on

856
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,000
Speaker 4:  shift. So he'll cook for his fire crew. So he gets to do the cooking there

857
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,680
Speaker 4:  and quite often he'll ask me for recipes and stuff, but no, I don't let him

858
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,400
Speaker 4:  actually cook in this kitchen ever.

859
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,560
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. What is this very charming noise we're hearing right now by

860
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:44,720
Speaker 2:  the way?

861
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,680
Speaker 4:  So this is the Therma mix. It is dumb with the melting of the

862
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:48,840
Speaker 4:  butter.

863
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,840
Speaker 2:  It's a nice noise. We've heard some hideous noises from this gadget so far,

864
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,120
Speaker 2:  but that was a nice one. I like

865
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,680
Speaker 4:  That one. This is a gentle one. The downside is it will not stop

866
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,640
Speaker 4:  until you come and press the button. Oh. So if it's done and you

867
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,920
Speaker 4:  don't, you know you don't wanna mess with it, you have to get up and shut

868
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,840
Speaker 4:  it up. That's the one thing that annoys me about it. Okay, so now I'm

869
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,080
Speaker 4:  gonna put in my ginger snap cookies and now I can't remember if I mentioned

870
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,000
Speaker 4:  this before, but this is a builtin scale so I don't need to

871
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,880
Speaker 4:  get the scales out to weigh how many ginger snap cookies I need. I just pour

872
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,760
Speaker 4:  it in and it shows me on the screen what quantity I've add.

873
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,840
Speaker 4:  So, oh love the of gingers.

874
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,280
Speaker 4:  I think it's just gonna be the whole bag. Yep, there we go. So the whole

875
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,400
Speaker 4:  bag goes in, this will be

876
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,240
Speaker 2:  Noisy. So now we have basically all the ingredients of your pie crust in

877
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:38,440
Speaker 2:  there.

878
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,960
Speaker 4:  Oh and sugar, I forgot the sugar. So one ounce of sugar.

879
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:45,320
Speaker 2:  Do you have to do all the measurement conversion in your head? The difference

880
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,880
Speaker 2:  between like an ounce and a gram and a tablespoon?

881
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:52,280
Speaker 2:  Does it show you all the different measurements all at the same time?

882
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:56,120
Speaker 4:  So you can choose in the settings what measurements you want, if you want

883
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,800
Speaker 4:  to use imperial or metric. Okay. And then the

884
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,760
Speaker 4:  on the screen as I added, it's showing me the weight. So it's showed

885
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,520
Speaker 4:  me when I added, I've added 1.2 ounces of sugar, which you know,

886
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:11,880
Speaker 4:  I don't need to be exact. And then if you want, like

887
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,800
Speaker 4:  I mentioned, it's also got this cup measure up here. So if you're adding

888
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,600
Speaker 4:  liquid you can just measure that, it can weigh

889
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,560
Speaker 4:  or measure. So you've got lots of options, which is nice cuz again

890
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:27,320
Speaker 4:  I don't, I, I've cooked this whole meal and I haven't got a cup or a

891
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,280
Speaker 4:  tablespoon thing out once it's pretty great. Anything Yeah,

892
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,080
Speaker 4:  which I really like. I've got my ingredients for the crust in

893
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,880
Speaker 4:  and it's telling me it's gonna take five seconds and it's gonna heat it up

894
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,840
Speaker 4:  to 160 degrees for five seconds and go really fast. So this is gonna

895
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,520
Speaker 4:  be noisy.

896
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,000
Speaker 2:  Okay,

897
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,760
Speaker 11:  That's

898
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,440
Speaker 4:  Not too noisy actually. Oh nope. Just

899
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,040
Speaker 11:  Rev up.

900
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,300
Speaker 2:  That's it. It did it. That was so fast.

901
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:02,500
Speaker 4:  Yep, that was really quick. So the device comes with a spatula

902
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:06,580
Speaker 4:  so it's asking me to scrape down the sides because obviously when

903
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,260
Speaker 4:  you blend something in a blender it all kind of goes up sides.

904
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,220
Speaker 2:  Is this like a special spatula?

905
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:16,020
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it comes with it. It's very neat. It's actually designed

906
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:20,020
Speaker 4:  to use, it has a little hook in it and it hooks onto the

907
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:24,220
Speaker 4:  simine basket. So like say you're doing rice or boiled eggs or something,

908
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,020
Speaker 4:  it can just lift the simmering basket out for you without you getting burning

909
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,820
Speaker 4:  your hands on the steam cuz it boils. You can boil eggs

910
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,580
Speaker 4:  in this as well

911
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,980
Speaker 2:  And of course you can. I,

912
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,940
Speaker 4:  I literally haven't found anything it can't do yet. Okay,

913
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,340
Speaker 4:  so now we're gonna blend again. 10 more seconds.

914
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:42,980
Speaker 11:  That

915
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,380
Speaker 4:  Was faster.

916
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:44,060
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

917
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:46,620
Speaker 11:  Oh of course.

918
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,300
Speaker 11:  Describe it.

919
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,700
Speaker 2:  Okay. Okay I've I've changed my mind about that noise by the way. If it does

920
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,580
Speaker 2:  that noise until you make it stop every single time, that's a lot of that

921
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,900
Speaker 2:  sound.

922
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,420
Speaker 4:  It is. And yeah and I can't like stop it

923
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,260
Speaker 4:  remotely or anything with the app so yeah that's definitely a downside

924
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,580
Speaker 4:  I would like, I'd like a bit more control there.

925
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,700
Speaker 2:  I also just feel like it should play like three seconds of, of a song or

926
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,780
Speaker 2:  like tell you a joke or just like something different when it's done.

927
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:22,020
Speaker 4:  Yeah cause it does get quite repetitive. So now I've got my

928
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,780
Speaker 4:  crumb bass so I'm gonna put that in my pie filling

929
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,340
Speaker 4:  spring form pie pan which is what you need for a cheesecake if you're

930
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,180
Speaker 4:  not familiar with cheesecake cooking. Okay. I will make that

931
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,900
Speaker 4:  into a pie just by sort of pressing it down with the

932
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,500
Speaker 4:  spatula. So like into a crust. Sorry graham cracker

933
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,380
Speaker 4:  crusts are normally on cheesecakes. Yeah, yeah,

934
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:44,700
Speaker 2:  Usually.

935
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,460
Speaker 4:  Yeah so that's what this is a lot like. So I'm gonna just

936
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,460
Speaker 4:  tap that down and then it tells me to just put it in the fridge so that it

937
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,420
Speaker 4:  chills while I'm making the filling and now I've got nice gingerbread

938
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,300
Speaker 4:  hands and now I can go over to my smart faucet and

939
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,700
Speaker 4:  wash them without getting my faucet or covered in gingerbread crumbs cuz

940
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,700
Speaker 4:  it's motion activated. I

941
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,140
Speaker 2:  Was gonna say you can wash your hands without touching anything. Do you have

942
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,900
Speaker 2:  like a temperature you use to wash your hands now? Like how crazy has this

943
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,500
Speaker 2:  sink made you?

944
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:16,500
Speaker 4:  I probably should have, shouldn't I? Cause it's better to do it when you

945
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,220
Speaker 4:  are to do it with warm water, but I'm, I'm more about speed.

946
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,320
Speaker 4:  Okay. Especially as it's just some butter. But it does have a hand hand washing

947
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,240
Speaker 4:  feature so I can say hey voice assistant start my

948
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,080
Speaker 4:  hand washing preset and then it would dispense the water at certain

949
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,720
Speaker 4:  temperature. So yeah, maybe I'll try and do that.

950
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,840
Speaker 2:  All

951
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,120
Speaker 4:  Right. I just, you know, sometimes there's only so much smart you need.

952
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:42,480
Speaker 4:  Okay. So I'm just rinsing out the FEMA mix

953
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:46,800
Speaker 4:  bowl I guess is what you call it. Now we're gonna make the filling so

954
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,400
Speaker 4:  you can, as I mentioned before, it will self clean but for

955
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:54,360
Speaker 4:  efficiency at this stage it's just quicker to rinse it out and it's

956
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,200
Speaker 4:  not like I'm doing meat and then the pie, it's just

957
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,040
Speaker 4:  got gingerbread crumbs in it so a little contamination wouldn't be a problem.

958
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,120
Speaker 2:  I'm definitely starting to see why people would buy several of the, of the

959
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,320
Speaker 2:  container thing to be able to just sort of hot swap them in and out as you're

960
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:09,440
Speaker 2:  cooking.

961
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:13,160
Speaker 4:  If I had my druthers I would have at least two. Okay. Cream

962
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,720
Speaker 4:  cheese, the best part of any pie or cake filling.

963
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:20,800
Speaker 4:  So again, have to cube it, it doesn't, it doesn't want me to put it in

964
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,720
Speaker 4:  whole so there is a little bit of manual labor and

965
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,800
Speaker 4:  then I'm gonna pop the hued cream cheese

966
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:32,280
Speaker 4:  into the bowl. It's not cooking this obviously cuz

967
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:36,080
Speaker 4:  the oven will cook it but like when I was, I did the mashed

968
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,960
Speaker 4:  potato before it cooked a mashed potato in the bowl for

969
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,720
Speaker 4:  30 minutes before we blended it. So it's nice to be able to have

970
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,400
Speaker 4:  that function of doing both.

971
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,360
Speaker 2:  Yeah although it's, it's an interesting thing because like in doing that

972
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,640
Speaker 2:  you're in a good position because you're kind of doing everything in one

973
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,240
Speaker 2:  place that's very handy. But it's also kind of like you have a whole kitchen

974
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,120
Speaker 2:  with only one bowl and, and it's, you know what I mean And nothing

975
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,520
Speaker 2:  is now like monopolized for 30 minutes and it is like the main thing you're

976
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,160
Speaker 2:  using to do your cooking. So it's yet another reason that it would be better

977
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,960
Speaker 2:  if this stuff was like well integrated and everything sort of made sense

978
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,560
Speaker 2:  together. It feels like we need like a universal standard for kitchen gadgets

979
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,160
Speaker 2:  that you can just sort of drop new things into new places and it's like

980
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,240
Speaker 2:  you keep it in the bowl but you move it between devices and that's how it

981
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,120
Speaker 2:  works. That seems like it would be a much cleaner system than a lot of the

982
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,280
Speaker 2:  stuff we've been doing where it's just kind of one all in one system.

983
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,280
Speaker 4:  Exactly. Yeah. That's the biggest issue I have with this device

984
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,840
Speaker 4:  and it was entirely designed as a self-contained system

985
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,480
Speaker 4:  other than you know, using your oven. But yeah, it doesn't integrate with

986
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,400
Speaker 4:  anything else in my house. Although it wasn't sort of designed to be a

987
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,880
Speaker 4:  smart device, which generally is when you find

988
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:47,360
Speaker 4:  gadgets become actually useful when you know someone didn't think oh I

989
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,360
Speaker 4:  can make this smart, what can I then make it do?

990
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:55,000
Speaker 4:  They thought, oh I have this function I need and actually adding

991
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,720
Speaker 4:  connectivity would make this function work better, you know, and I like that

992
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,080
Speaker 4:  approach totally because I, there's too much, let's add wifi to this and

993
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,040
Speaker 4:  then figure out why that might be useful later. And that happens in

994
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,720
Speaker 4:  the kitchen a lot.

995
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah and by the time you're building a whole Android tablet into your device,

996
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,360
Speaker 2:  like you kind of have no excuse but to make some of this stuff work.

997
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:17,400
Speaker 4:  Exactly. And you know obviously the connectivity, the best feature

998
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,080
Speaker 4:  of connectivity I would say in the kitchen at the moment is software updates.

999
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,160
Speaker 4:  You know, this has had like new recipes appear every

1000
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,920
Speaker 4:  week with a new software update and my fridge gets new

1001
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,480
Speaker 4:  functions with software updates. So you know, from from that perspective

1002
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:36,000
Speaker 4:  I think adding the connectivity does, you know, add usefulness.

1003
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,960
Speaker 4:  But now I've put sour cream and cream cheese in here so this is gonna be

1004
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,320
Speaker 4:  very decadent my, which I suppose

1005
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,280
Speaker 4:  that's just the way cheesecakes are. Okay so three and a half ounce of sugar

1006
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,080
Speaker 4:  again gonna add the eggs again you have to do this

1007
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,120
Speaker 4:  manually. It's not gonna crack the egg for you.

1008
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,960
Speaker 2:  So this is one of the things I've been thinking as you've been doing this

1009
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,840
Speaker 2:  is like in the kitchen world there is like an infinite selection

1010
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:04,840
Speaker 2:  of super random little gadgets, right? Like are we gonna get the

1011
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,800
Speaker 2:  equivalent of that but with Bluetooth next and this is just gonna be the

1012
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,400
Speaker 2:  whole new world that we live in. I both hope so and hope not. Simultaneously

1013
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,640
Speaker 4:  I just can't see what value they would be but someone will come up with it.

1014
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,760
Speaker 4:  And one of the things that we really aren't showcasing here because you know

1015
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,320
Speaker 4:  when you cook your Thanksgiving dinner you are in the kitchen all day.

1016
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:27,400
Speaker 4:  But one of the biggest benefits I would say of the smart kitchen to date

1017
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:31,400
Speaker 4:  is remote control and remote monitoring. So if you

1018
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,680
Speaker 4:  are out, you know you can put your Turkey in the oven and go out for the

1019
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,640
Speaker 4:  day and check in on your thermometer from a distance to make

1020
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,360
Speaker 4:  sure that everything's going well. You know, having that kind of remote

1021
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,680
Speaker 4:  control or insight into what's happening at home.

1022
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:50,000
Speaker 4:  If you are in the garden or had to go do some shopping, that's a benefit.

1023
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:54,160
Speaker 4:  Unfortunately I had to get out the teaspoons because

1024
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,880
Speaker 4:  I know

1025
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,360
Speaker 2:  Technology has failed us

1026
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,560
Speaker 4:  Using the teaspoon. So there's one thing I'm gonna have to wash.

1027
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,640
Speaker 2:  I'm assuming you also have like a smart dishwasher lying around.

1028
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,360
Speaker 4:  I do have a smart dishwasher.

1029
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:08,480
Speaker 2:  Of course you do. I didn't even know that was a thing and I just said that

1030
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,920
Speaker 2:  and was like if, if this exists, Jen has it.

1031
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:15,000
Speaker 4:  So like the oven though, it's just smart in that I can monitor it,

1032
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,880
Speaker 4:  I can like change the program. It does tell me how much RINs aid I have

1033
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,160
Speaker 4:  and that kind of stuff. It doesn't do anything special in terms of cleaning,

1034
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,560
Speaker 4:  it just cleans like a regular dishwasher. But a dishwasher's a pretty smart

1035
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:29,240
Speaker 4:  gadget to begin with. That's true. I mean it's a robot that is washing your

1036
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,160
Speaker 4:  dishes for you. You don't need to mess with that too much. Okay, we're

1037
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,680
Speaker 4:  gonna mix our filling for 10 seconds.

1038
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:50,800
Speaker 4:  There's the noise wants a little bit of scraping and you

1039
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,600
Speaker 4:  could hear the little robot arms coming off cuz it won't let you in.

1040
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,680
Speaker 4:  Sometimes you have to sort of stand here for a few seconds to wait for it

1041
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,640
Speaker 4:  to let you in, which can be a little frustrating. Okay. And we're gonna mix

1042
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,000
Speaker 4:  again and then almost at the end

1043
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,760
Speaker 2:  I'm officially out on this noise just in the time we've been standing here

1044
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,000
Speaker 2:  doing this. I'm out on the noise.

1045
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:16,920
Speaker 4:  I know but it's quite loud but it's not too jarring

1046
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,840
Speaker 2:  And it is definitely true. At least we've moved past the just like loud

1047
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,640
Speaker 2:  truck reversing beeping noises. Yes. So that's something

1048
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:25,640
Speaker 2:  it's progress.

1049
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:30,040
Speaker 4:  Okay so it asked me to pour two-thirds of the mixture

1050
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:33,960
Speaker 4:  over the pie base and now we get to the exciting

1051
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,840
Speaker 4:  bit which is the pumpkin. And now I did not

1052
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,400
Speaker 4:  go hand scrape a pumpkin for you guys. I went and bought some

1053
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:45,800
Speaker 4:  canned stuff and some brown

1054
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,720
Speaker 4:  sugar. So this one is definitely the messiest

1055
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:52,600
Speaker 4:  part of the meal. And then we need to add some pumpkin

1056
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,840
Speaker 4:  spice. That should be it.

1057
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:57,560
Speaker 4:  Okay.

1058
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:01,400
Speaker 2:  And every single part of this has happened in this one Therma mix.

1059
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:05,400
Speaker 4:  Yep. Other than obviously the pie crust is now in the Pippa,

1060
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:09,400
Speaker 2:  Are there other devices like this? Like is the Therma mix one of like a

1061
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,240
Speaker 2:  whole genre or is it just kind of the one thing? It's

1062
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,800
Speaker 4:  Just the one thing as far as I'm aware, I have not come across another gadget

1063
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,560
Speaker 4:  like it as said it's pretty popular in Europe but I haven't seen it

1064
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,120
Speaker 4:  much in the States yet. Like I said that there are so many gadgets for the

1065
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,120
Speaker 4:  kitchen that I think a lot of people are like, oh do I need another one?

1066
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,840
Speaker 4:  You know I've already got cuis and art.

1067
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:30,840
Speaker 7:  Sorry

1068
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,200
Speaker 2:  It's

1069
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,640
Speaker 4:  Just a nice noise. It's just

1070
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,640
Speaker 2:  A nice, it just sounds like cooking. I

1071
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,920
Speaker 4:  Appreciate that. You getting hungry?

1072
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:41,080
Speaker 2:  Yes. This is the absolute worst part. I feel bad for everyone listening to

1073
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,760
Speaker 2:  this but I especially feel bad for me cuz I'm just starving. Now if you're

1074
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,640
Speaker 2:  listening to this in your car on the way to Thanksgiving, just know that

1075
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,280
Speaker 2:  I'm sorry and I feel your pain.

1076
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,000
Speaker 4:  All right and so now we're done. So I'm just gonna pull that onto the top

1077
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,560
Speaker 4:  of the pie and then it'll go in the oven for two hours in total

1078
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,360
Speaker 4:  10 minutes to start and then an hour and 50 minutes to finish it off

1079
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:04,080
Speaker 4:  And then you have to let it sit for a long time. Cheesecakes take a long

1080
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:04,960
Speaker 4:  time to chill.

1081
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:09,360
Speaker 2:  So the connectivity piece of this, if you were to just like buy

1082
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,240
Speaker 2:  all Samsung everything, would all of this be even easier cuz

1083
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,840
Speaker 2:  all these companies now are trying to like build out whole ecosystems, right?

1084
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,520
Speaker 2:  Like is it Yeah if you went all in on one company would it work?

1085
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:24,680
Speaker 4:  So in terms of what you were asking about this device, like if, if it

1086
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,120
Speaker 4:  talked to anyone else, the Therma mix, would it be more useful? So what

1087
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,960
Speaker 4:  Samsung's sort of angle is for the smart fridge and the smart

1088
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,640
Speaker 4:  oven right now is you know you order your groceries on your fridge,

1089
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,560
Speaker 4:  you choose your recipes on your fridge, you can follow along on the

1090
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,000
Speaker 4:  recipes on the fridge, although that's not that useful unless cuz your fridge

1091
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,960
Speaker 4:  is not right in front of you when you're cooking but then it would

1092
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,080
Speaker 4:  know what you were cooking. So the fridge would know I was cooking a pumpkin

1093
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:54,120
Speaker 4:  pie, a pumpkin cheesecake and it would send the

1094
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,960
Speaker 4:  correct settings to the oven and you know if this device would

1095
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,440
Speaker 4:  could communicate with the oven, I think that would be an extra useful step

1096
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,160
Speaker 4:  because right now it's saying turn the temperature of your oven

1097
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:09,120
Speaker 4:  to 250 degrees for 20 minutes and then

1098
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,080
Speaker 4:  reduce the temperature to 225 and bake for another hour and a

1099
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,040
Speaker 4:  half. So that means I'm gonna have to come back in 20 minutes and adjust

1100
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,920
Speaker 4:  it. But if it could could send that to the oven and automatically

1101
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,880
Speaker 4:  adjust the oven in 20 minutes down to 2 25 and to

1102
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,800
Speaker 4:  continue cooking at one for an hour and a half, then I wouldn't have to worry

1103
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,360
Speaker 4:  about it. So that would be a useful connect. You know if there was

1104
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,760
Speaker 4:  some connectivity in the background here between these

1105
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,800
Speaker 4:  appliances, which could happen if I was using Samsung oven, it

1106
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,880
Speaker 4:  could have and the Samsung fridge to do the recipe, it could have talked

1107
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,800
Speaker 4:  to each other but it's a small thing at this stage, you

1108
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,120
Speaker 4:  know, changing the temperature isn't that hard. True and I can do it

1109
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,080
Speaker 4:  from my app on the oven but you know if we're trying to make the

1110
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,800
Speaker 4:  smart kitchen a more viable and appealing

1111
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,760
Speaker 4:  solution to people, those kind of small but sort of simple

1112
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:04,360
Speaker 4:  steps, taking that out of our brains and having to worry about when we're

1113
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,160
Speaker 4:  cooking other things would help. I

1114
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,600
Speaker 2:  Think that's where it goes back to the question of like having your family

1115
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:13,120
Speaker 2:  cook with you, right? This is part of the problem with with smart homes in

1116
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,960
Speaker 2:  general is you have to learn so many specific things

1117
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,640
Speaker 2:  about exactly how it works and what the name of that lamp is

1118
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,120
Speaker 2:  and how it'll refer to your faucet and it's like, you know what's great about

1119
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,360
Speaker 2:  a light switch is they look pretty much the same everywhere and right and

1120
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,400
Speaker 2:  it's like the thing on the oven that you turn to the right to turn the oven

1121
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,080
Speaker 2:  on is like pretty self-explanatory most of the time. And I feel like with

1122
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,880
Speaker 2:  a lot of this stuff it's so handy but so non-obvious

1123
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,800
Speaker 2:  how it works that it's like you have to like build a manual for how to use

1124
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,760
Speaker 2:  your kitchen. Little things like the thermo mix seem like they push in the

1125
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,520
Speaker 2:  right direction where it's just like here is a screen, touch the screen,

1126
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,600
Speaker 2:  we'll figure this out together. But so much of this stuff is all so like

1127
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,600
Speaker 2:  behind the scenes in opaque and just impossible to figure out. So if I like

1128
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,000
Speaker 2:  walked into your kitchen, I would not know how to do anything.

1129
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah you would not know how to turn the tap on.

1130
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,160
Speaker 2:  Which is a pretty important thing.

1131
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:05,360
Speaker 4:  My husband when I was away a few weeks ago was making something in the kitchen

1132
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,520
Speaker 4:  and I said oh we use a Therma mix and he's like, I have no idea how to use

1133
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,160
Speaker 4:  that. And it is a bit, as you mentioned, a bit more user friendly

1134
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,040
Speaker 4:  than some devices but yes it's, it's foreign, it's different. It's not what

1135
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,840
Speaker 4:  he's used to. That's a problem with too many of the gadgets like sous vide

1136
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:23,600
Speaker 4:  is a big thing in the smart kitchen. I have not actually tried it myself

1137
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,080
Speaker 4:  but there, you know when you try and sort of break the mold and come out

1138
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,720
Speaker 4:  with really new ways of doing things in the kitchen or at least new for the

1139
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,680
Speaker 4:  residential kitchen cuz it was obviously a big thing for commercial kitchens

1140
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:37,560
Speaker 4:  that when it gets a little bit harder for the average consumer to

1141
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:41,480
Speaker 4:  say hey yes I definitely want this. The connectivity of devices

1142
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,320
Speaker 4:  in the kitchen right now still is a big question mark like why do I need

1143
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,040
Speaker 4:  to do that? I, I remember talking to some appliance manufacturers and they

1144
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,880
Speaker 4:  say you know, 90% of their smart appliances never

1145
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,840
Speaker 4:  get connected to the internet. So no one's really using that. That

1146
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,720
Speaker 4:  might be slightly overestimate but it was like they rarely do. Or if

1147
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,160
Speaker 4:  they do get connected and then one day someone changes their wifi

1148
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,680
Speaker 4:  router, no one ever bothers to reconnect it cuz they just haven't found the

1149
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,520
Speaker 4:  value. I think the most useful thing I have found out of connectivity was

1150
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:15,440
Speaker 4:  my LG dishwasher about five years ago stop working

1151
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:19,440
Speaker 4:  and I was able to hold up the phone to the

1152
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,800
Speaker 4:  device and it played a sound to the LG app

1153
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,200
Speaker 4:  which told the app what was wrong with the dishwasher

1154
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:30,400
Speaker 4:  and how I could fix it cuz it wasn't working and that saved me a lot of money

1155
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,480
Speaker 2:  That I like

1156
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:35,560
Speaker 4:  That has got better. This was a while ago. So now you can

1157
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,560
Speaker 4:  actually, you know the app will do proper diagnosis for you. My fridge will

1158
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,160
Speaker 4:  diagnose itself. Actually it did once when it wasn't working properly and

1159
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,520
Speaker 4:  so when the repair man, cuz it did need to be repaired when the repair man

1160
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:50,200
Speaker 4:  came here, he knew exactly what he needed to bring, didn't have to

1161
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,080
Speaker 4:  come out twice. So that sort of support for appliances,

1162
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,040
Speaker 4:  that connectivity is a bonus because you know you

1163
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,520
Speaker 4:  save money, especially if you don't have to have a repairman come out. And

1164
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:05,360
Speaker 4:  I think that's the most compelling use case right now for regular consumers

1165
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,080
Speaker 4:  is if you connect it to the internet we can tell you why it broke.

1166
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,840
Speaker 2:  That's pretty good. So here, here's the real question. This is what it all

1167
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,680
Speaker 2:  boils down to. Does matter, fix everything Matter is

1168
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,320
Speaker 2:  matter gonna solve everything for us.

1169
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:22,560
Speaker 4:  I'll tell you what will matter, we'll fix in my kitchen as the lights, oh

1170
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,480
Speaker 4:  okay, so we didn't go into this but in terms of my family using my

1171
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,440
Speaker 4:  kitchen, the one sort of smart thing they have got used to is the lights.

1172
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,440
Speaker 4:  Cuz I have a motion sensor that when you walk into the kitchen it'll turn

1173
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,280
Speaker 4:  the lights on and if no one's been moving in the kitchen for a certain amount

1174
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,800
Speaker 4:  of time, they'll turn off. Which is useful cuz it's, it's an open plan kitchen.

1175
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,640
Speaker 4:  And we have our living room right here. So when you're watching TV you don't

1176
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,560
Speaker 4:  really want the kitchen lights on. But I also wanted nice lights. I did

1177
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,160
Speaker 4:  a big kitchen remodel a couple years ago. It was kind of my midlife crisis

1178
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,960
Speaker 4:  thing. I didn't buy a Corvette, I got a really fancy kitchen, it

1179
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,920
Speaker 4:  works. I didn't want like screw and light bulb. I wanted nice light fixtures.

1180
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,720
Speaker 4:  So I have like pendant lights and I have a few other kind of fancy light

1181
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:07,000
Speaker 4:  fixtures that aren't smart. So I needed to use smart switches from different

1182
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,640
Speaker 4:  brands and getting them all to work with one motion

1183
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,600
Speaker 4:  sensor has been difficult. I have done it but it's been a bit of

1184
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,560
Speaker 4:  a work around and it's not ideal and it often breaks. So

1185
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,440
Speaker 4:  this is the whole point of matter is a common language

1186
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,280
Speaker 4:  for all your devices. So I should have much and much faster

1187
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,000
Speaker 4:  responsiveness too. So occasionally you'll walk into the kitchen and it takes

1188
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,560
Speaker 4:  a couple beats before the lights turn on, which is very frustrating. You

1189
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,440
Speaker 4:  want it to be as fast, if not fast than flipping

1190
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,320
Speaker 4:  the light switch. I've been here too, you know, everyone's very excited

1191
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:45,560
Speaker 4:  in this space about matter and kind of hyped up for it. But ultimately

1192
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:49,560
Speaker 4:  it's a very simple solution to start with. And

1193
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,160
Speaker 4:  I think the easiest way to sum up is that matter is going to make

1194
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,320
Speaker 4:  smart lights work as well as dumb lights do now.

1195
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:01,840
Speaker 2:  Okay. I mean even that is is a pretty high bar given kind of where

1196
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,720
Speaker 2:  we're coming from with a lot of this stuff. Yes. Like you have to be better

1197
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,320
Speaker 2:  than light switches before any of this matters. And I think like, it sounds

1198
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,640
Speaker 2:  very small, but it's, I think that's like the real bar. So I'm, I'm, if Matter

1199
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,560
Speaker 2:  can get there, that feels like, like good news.

1200
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:17,440
Speaker 4:  That's the hope. My kitchen will be a good test for it once it finally gets

1201
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:17,560
Speaker 4:  here.

1202
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:22,520
Speaker 2:  Okay, we have tortured people enough. I'm starving. I'm gonna

1203
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,640
Speaker 2:  go eat everyone else. I hope you have made it to wherever you're going for
