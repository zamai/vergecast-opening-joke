Description: The Verge's Jennifer Pattison Tuohy joins the show to discuss a bunch of updates in the smart home world, including what's new from Google Home and in iOS 18, plus some big news in the world of smart locks and video doorbells. Then, The Verge's Chris Welch comes on to test some new earbuds, and see which pair has the best sound – and the best mic. After that, a new take on the Vergecast's chaotic wearables theory.

00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,995
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Powered Front

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:10,755
Speaker 2:  Doors, which is a thing that I just learned exists. Thanks to this

4
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:14,515
Speaker 2:  episode, I'm your friend David Pierce and I am cooped up

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:18,355
Speaker 2:  inside and have been for several days. Obviously a lot of people in the

6
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:22,235
Speaker 2:  US have been really horribly affected by Hurricane Helene.

7
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:26,875
Speaker 2:  I hope you're all doing okay. Our thoughts are obviously with everyone dealing

8
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:30,555
Speaker 2:  with all of that where I am. It's been fine. It's just

9
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:34,315
Speaker 2:  basically been raining for four days and my kid has been outta daycare and

10
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:38,075
Speaker 2:  he's been sick and so it's just been a lot of inside

11
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:41,355
Speaker 2:  time. It's been a lot of running around in the basement. It's been a lot

12
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:45,195
Speaker 2:  of watching the same old McDonald had a farm YouTube video over and

13
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:48,875
Speaker 2:  over. It's just been a lot like you, you, you just grow to

14
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,395
Speaker 2:  appreciate outside more and more. I'm in a real like touch grass moment

15
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:56,515
Speaker 2:  except it's still raining so there will be no grass touching for a little

16
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:00,475
Speaker 2:  while. Even the dog over there is starting to lose it a little bit I

17
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:04,075
Speaker 2:  think. But anyway, luckily we have The Vergecast to keep us on track

18
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:08,595
Speaker 2:  and doing stuff. Today we have two things we're gonna do. First

19
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:11,995
Speaker 2:  we're gonna catch up with Jen Tuy about all things Smart Home. There's been

20
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:15,875
Speaker 2:  a lot this summer she was at EFA looking at sworn home gadgets. We have some

21
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:19,755
Speaker 2:  protocol news with Matter and Thread. We have a bunch of stuff going on with

22
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:23,395
Speaker 2:  Google and Apple and software updates everywhere and all kinds of fun stuff

23
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:26,075
Speaker 2:  to talk about. So we're just gonna kind of play round Robin and catch up

24
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:29,755
Speaker 2:  with her. Then we're gonna talk to Chris Welch about this new run of

25
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:33,035
Speaker 2:  earbuds that we have this year. Apple just released some new ones. Google

26
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,915
Speaker 2:  released some new ones. Samsung released some new ones. Bose released some

27
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:39,035
Speaker 2:  new ones. I'm missing some. Oh nothing. Just released some new ones that

28
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:42,795
Speaker 2:  I'm really interested in. So we're gonna talk to him about this new slate

29
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:46,755
Speaker 2:  of earbuds. But also we're gonna do a mic test because as

30
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,275
Speaker 2:  I continue to say and really strongly believe microphones matter,

31
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:54,115
Speaker 2:  the way we talk to ai, the way we talk to the assistants on our devices,

32
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:57,955
Speaker 2:  the way we talk to each other, microphones in these earbuds matter

33
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:01,995
Speaker 2:  a lot and they don't get talked about enough. So we're gonna do what we occasionally

34
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:05,875
Speaker 2:  do on this show, which is put some really, really bad audio into the podcast

35
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:09,875
Speaker 2:  and I'm sorry in advance, but you know, we do it for the greater good.

36
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:13,435
Speaker 2:  We also have a really fun hotline question lots to get to today. Super fun

37
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:17,235
Speaker 2:  episode. But first I have to, I have to go outside. I'm just gonna

38
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:21,155
Speaker 2:  go like stand in the rain like a 1990s rom-com

39
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:24,635
Speaker 2:  star and just like stare upwards for five minutes and then we're gonna get

40
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:26,555
Speaker 2:  to it. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

41
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:46,975
Speaker 2:  Very happy to be back indoors looking at screens. Anyway, let's get to it.

42
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,675
Speaker 2:  First up, we're gonna talk about smart home stuff because it's been a minute

43
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:54,515
Speaker 2:  since we talked about smart home stuff. And normally I like to have the verges

44
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:58,555
Speaker 2:  Jen Tui on every once in a while just to basically, sadly

45
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,595
Speaker 2:  ask her why matter isn't better and why the smart home isn't fixed. And

46
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:05,595
Speaker 2:  we're gonna do a little bit of that today. But there's also been a surprising

47
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:09,315
Speaker 2:  amount of interesting smart home news that kind of points to something

48
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:13,155
Speaker 2:  bigger going on. There have been a lot of new gadgets for your front door,

49
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:16,515
Speaker 2:  which I find fascinating. Smart locks and video doorbells and that kind of

50
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:19,315
Speaker 2:  stuff. So, I. Think that whole space is really interesting. I wanna talk

51
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:22,955
Speaker 2:  about that. We've seen some new software from Google and Apple that makes

52
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:26,635
Speaker 2:  it easier to administer your smart home, which I think is a really big deal.

53
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:30,835
Speaker 2:  and we have some protocol news because matter

54
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:35,515
Speaker 2:  continues to be chaos. We have to talk about the chaos that is matter.

55
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:38,635
Speaker 2:  Let's get to all of that with Jen. We're just gonna bounce through a whole

56
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:42,155
Speaker 2:  bunch of news. I'm very excited about it. Let's get into it. Jen. Hello.

57
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,435
Speaker 5:  Hi David. Pleasure to be back. It's been too long.

58
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,715
Speaker 2:  It has been too long. You're you're going through a hurricane right now.

59
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:51,635
Speaker 2:  We should just tell the people that If you suddenly disappear. And this segment

60
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:55,355
Speaker 2:  is four minutes long. It's because you're like deep in hurricane times. Yes.

61
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,115
Speaker 2:  Are you holding up? Okay.

62
00:04:56,335 --> 00:05:00,195
Speaker 5:  Helene has been paying us a visit this morning. Thankfully we are not as

63
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:03,995
Speaker 5:  bad off as the poor people in Florida, but it's, it's been a bumpy ride so

64
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:06,675
Speaker 5:  far, so fingers crossed. We'll make it through

65
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:11,395
Speaker 2:  For sure. I find myself very curious in the middle of all this, what happens

66
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:15,475
Speaker 2:  to your smart home situation when your power goes off and then comes back

67
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:19,115
Speaker 2:  on? Like, does, is it just full insane chaos

68
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,355
Speaker 2:  every time the power blips in your house right now?

69
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:25,275
Speaker 5:  Yeah, because everything talks to me. It's kind of

70
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,555
Speaker 5:  scary actually, especially when it happens in the middle of the night. 'cause

71
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:32,115
Speaker 5:  so many things will be like, you know, connection restored or

72
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:36,355
Speaker 5:  offline and, and like voices from every corner of the house.

73
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:40,035
Speaker 5:  Robots in particular, robot vacuums, you know, cameras,

74
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:44,235
Speaker 5:  security systems and lots. Yeah, it it, it gets a little chaotic and then

75
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:47,075
Speaker 5:  obviously the notifications on my phone are like, ding, ding, ding, ding,

76
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:49,915
Speaker 5:  ding, ding. You know, offline, offline, offline. You can turn those off.

77
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:53,435
Speaker 5:  But because I, obviously I'm testing these things, I always turn on all the

78
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:57,325
Speaker 5:  notifications and then I have, you know, it was, it gets

79
00:05:57,405 --> 00:06:01,285
Speaker 5:  a little crazy, especially cameras. 'cause when they go offline they send

80
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:04,085
Speaker 5:  you alerts and then when they come back online, right. So this morning I

81
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:06,725
Speaker 5:  was woken up numerous times throughout the night when the power went out.

82
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:10,245
Speaker 5:  Thankfully though, smart lights have managed to fix the problem where they

83
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:14,205
Speaker 5:  all turn on automatically when the power comes back. And

84
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:18,045
Speaker 5:  that used to be a terrible issue where, you know, they would reset

85
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:21,245
Speaker 5:  to default and like all the lights in your bedroom would turn on at 2:00 AM

86
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:25,045
Speaker 5:  when the power came back on. That's no longer a problem. Thankfully.

87
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:29,125
Speaker 2:  That is really like the first act of a horror movie is, is all of that stuff

88
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,125
Speaker 2:  happening, all

89
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:30,605
Speaker 5:  Going crazy?

90
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,085
Speaker 2:  Well I'm glad it's, it seems to be settling so I'm, I'm glad, I'm glad everything's

91
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:36,565
Speaker 2:  okay. Yes,

92
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:37,405
Speaker 5:  I'm doing good.

93
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:41,045
Speaker 2:  We have some stuff to catch up on. We do. We have not done our

94
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,965
Speaker 2:  Jen, why isn't matter solving all of my problems check in in a while. So

95
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:48,005
Speaker 2:  we're gonna do that. But you mentioned right before we started recording

96
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:51,565
Speaker 2:  that you're working on a, a smart lock thing and

97
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,365
Speaker 2:  I just wanna start, I, I wanna run a theory by you and then I, I want you

98
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,245
Speaker 2:  to tell me what you think and then we're gonna talk about some new stuff

99
00:06:57,245 --> 00:07:00,845
Speaker 2:  around it. Okay. I think you could make a pretty compelling case that

100
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:04,845
Speaker 2:  your front door is the most interesting space in the smart home

101
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:08,605
Speaker 2:  right now between what's going on with video doorbells, what's going on with

102
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:12,445
Speaker 2:  smart locks, what stuff is like mainstream and very

103
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:16,125
Speaker 2:  good and suddenly like super interesting in a way that I feel like

104
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:20,245
Speaker 2:  everything else in the smart home is like kind of cool kind of a mess. And

105
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:23,325
Speaker 2:  it's like your front door is like where cool, interesting, good smart stuff

106
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:26,045
Speaker 2:  is happening right now. What do you think? Good theory, bad theory?

107
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:30,005
Speaker 5:  No, I agree. I think the front door always sort of actually always has been

108
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:34,005
Speaker 5:  a really key part because it's something that appeals to

109
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:37,925
Speaker 5:  everyone. I mean smart lights are really fun. Robot vacuums have

110
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:42,085
Speaker 5:  large appeal but you know, they are still niche. But the

111
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:46,245
Speaker 5:  concept of just of easy access to your home, not worrying about losing

112
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:49,805
Speaker 5:  keys, being able to let people in lock, unlock your door remotely,

113
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:53,405
Speaker 5:  know who's at your front door, you know, the front door is the gateway to

114
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:57,325
Speaker 5:  your house. And having the capability to sort

115
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:00,645
Speaker 5:  of remotely monitor it, always know what's going on. Having control over

116
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:03,445
Speaker 5:  the entrance to your home is something that everyone is interested in. Even

117
00:08:03,445 --> 00:08:07,285
Speaker 5:  people that live in apartments, you know, the smart entryways,

118
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:11,085
Speaker 5:  you know, 'cause smart home quite often apartment dwellers sort of get left

119
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:14,445
Speaker 5:  out a little bit, but not when it comes to smart locks and smart doorbells

120
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:18,125
Speaker 5:  there. There's lots of devices tailored to those types of

121
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:22,165
Speaker 5:  living scenarios. And it is an area that there's a lot going

122
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:26,125
Speaker 5:  on right now. There's a lot of change happening, but there's also, it's also

123
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,205
Speaker 5:  an area that's always had quite a lot of challenges

124
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,805
Speaker 5:  primarily because of power. And that's an area

125
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:37,605
Speaker 5:  we've seen more sort of innovation in. I think it will take a while. There

126
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:41,045
Speaker 5:  was the smart door that came out a couple years ago that was like wired for

127
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:43,965
Speaker 5:  power, which everyone kind of Oh yeah. Laughed about

128
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,885
Speaker 5:  a little bit but you know. Yeah. I think ultimately most homes, new homes

129
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,725
Speaker 5:  as they're built or homes as they're remodeled, wiring your door for power

130
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:56,645
Speaker 5:  is gonna make more and more sense. Both for lighting, for

131
00:08:56,645 --> 00:09:00,285
Speaker 5:  powering video doorbells, for powering your door locks. 'cause

132
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:03,365
Speaker 5:  battery power in the door lock is probably one of the biggest

133
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:07,965
Speaker 5:  pain points with smart door locks. You know, most sort of

134
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:11,525
Speaker 5:  ordinary people who decide to get a smart door lock, you know when they realize

135
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:14,765
Speaker 5:  they have to start changing the batteries every three to six months. It's

136
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:18,685
Speaker 5:  like this is, this is not smart. This is a pain. Yeah.

137
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:21,525
Speaker 5:  Especially if it locks you out because you know you've ignored the warnings

138
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:24,325
Speaker 5:  after the seventh or eighth time that they've sent them to you.

139
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,965
Speaker 5:  So we, it's interesting to find, you know, to see the solutions that are

140
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:32,685
Speaker 5:  coming around there. And then we've also got, UWB is a new,

141
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:37,325
Speaker 5:  a new technology we're seen in door locks. Apple quite recently

142
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:41,045
Speaker 5:  announced that they were adding capability for unlocking smart door

143
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:44,805
Speaker 5:  locks using UWB chip in the iPhone.

144
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:48,965
Speaker 5:  So we're starting to see sort of a real shift there that in, what's interesting

145
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:52,885
Speaker 5:  about that is the sort of the hands free notion of you know, being

146
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:56,805
Speaker 5:  able to access your home without even having to even tap your watch to

147
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:00,765
Speaker 5:  the door, let alone pull your key out because UWB

148
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:04,125
Speaker 5:  radio will automatically sense that you are there, connect to your door and

149
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,405
Speaker 5:  unlock it for you. So there's so much interesting going on. But you, you

150
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:10,725
Speaker 5:  need the power. And actually something I've been testing recently,

151
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:14,805
Speaker 5:  which sort of ties into all of this is wireless power. I'm testing

152
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:18,205
Speaker 5:  something called We Charge, which is a wireless power

153
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:21,885
Speaker 5:  transmitter and it can wirelessly power a door lock that I've been testing,

154
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,485
Speaker 5:  which is by a company called Alfred.

155
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:26,085
Speaker 2:  Wait, this has been around forever, right? Yes. I feel like I've been hearing

156
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:30,005
Speaker 2:  like science project things about wireless power for like

157
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:34,245
Speaker 2:  the entire time I have been covering technology. Is this for

158
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:37,725
Speaker 2:  real now? Like is somebody actually gonna ship this thing to me at some point?

159
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:38,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

160
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,685
Speaker 5:  Well you can buy this right now with this door lock. Okay. It is,

161
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,165
Speaker 5:  it's not sort of off the shelf. You kind of have to get in touch with the

162
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:48,925
Speaker 5:  company and they can arrange for installation. So it's a little laborious.

163
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:52,445
Speaker 5:  But I was talking to the founder and he said they've actually developed a

164
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:56,405
Speaker 5:  retrofit design so that you can just plug a little

165
00:10:56,845 --> 00:11:00,805
Speaker 5:  transmitter into power, put it on a shelf and then plug a

166
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:04,885
Speaker 5:  receiver into your power port of say your door locks, a lot of door locks

167
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:08,245
Speaker 5:  have power ports and then that can actually end up allowing you to

168
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:13,165
Speaker 5:  wirelessly power your door. Now wireless power I

169
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:16,965
Speaker 5:  think is maybe not the solution ultimately to all of these

170
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:20,845
Speaker 5:  issues. I think Wired is always generally

171
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:24,645
Speaker 5:  gonna be more reliable, but it requires so much more effort

172
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:28,645
Speaker 5:  for installation. So, I feel like there is, you know, there's

173
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:32,245
Speaker 5:  always maybe gonna be a middle ground, you know, especially for retrofit.

174
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:36,165
Speaker 5:  You're gonna, you know, having the options to do something other than

175
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:39,125
Speaker 5:  use, I mean, have you used, do you have a smart door lock?

176
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:43,445
Speaker 2:  I don't. It's actually the, the one and only smart home

177
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:47,005
Speaker 2:  device that I think my wife would allow me to install. But

178
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:47,365
Speaker 5:  You haven't

179
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:51,005
Speaker 2:  So I'm, I'm gonna do it. It's just like we're we're, I'm at the point where

180
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:54,365
Speaker 2:  I'm procrastinating painting the thing So, I'm not sure I'm a good like

181
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:58,085
Speaker 2:  version of, you know, being ahead of things on home projects. But it's on

182
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,405
Speaker 2:  the list. It's on the list.

183
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:03,485
Speaker 5:  Well and the, the battery is an issue. I mean the August

184
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:06,885
Speaker 5:  is a great smart lock for example, but when you know you have to change the

185
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:09,605
Speaker 5:  batteries every two to three months, that's too often some smart locks will

186
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,365
Speaker 5:  go at least a year and a year. Sounds great. But actually that's still, that's

187
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,765
Speaker 5:  still a lot. Yeah. I mean it's like, do you remember to change your smoke

188
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:16,685
Speaker 5:  alarm batteries every year?

189
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:20,125
Speaker 2:  I remember when it beeps at me right at two o'clock in the morning. That's,

190
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,645
Speaker 2:  that's when I remember to change the smoke alarm.

191
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:25,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So I mean And that if we could have wireless power

192
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:29,525
Speaker 5:  or wired for power built into our homes so that you can have, you

193
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:33,005
Speaker 5:  can power your video doorbell, you can power your door lock, you can power

194
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,885
Speaker 5:  some lighting around your door, maybe even your security panel. You

195
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:40,765
Speaker 5:  know, it just, I can see sort of a much easier transition

196
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:44,565
Speaker 5:  to these types of devices rather than having to constantly mess with them

197
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:48,045
Speaker 5:  and recharge or put new batteries in and

198
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:51,245
Speaker 5:  So, I go through so many batteries and I hate it. I'm like, ah,

199
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:52,125
Speaker 2:  This

200
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:55,005
Speaker 5:  E-waste. Yeah. So it's, it's an interesting space for sure.

201
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:59,405
Speaker 2:  Too many of these devices also make that part really complicated

202
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,885
Speaker 2:  because I, I think the, the battery life thing is really interesting to me.

203
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:05,885
Speaker 2:  'cause I think like I I, one of the, I've owned a home for three years

204
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,325
Speaker 2:  now and I'm still discovering all the things you're supposed to do on like

205
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:13,285
Speaker 2:  a routine basis and I just like, I have, I have furnace

206
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:16,405
Speaker 2:  air filters right? That I just am supposed to change every three months and

207
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:19,965
Speaker 2:  I more or less remember every three months. That's fine. It's every three

208
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,125
Speaker 2:  months. It takes 30 seconds, it's fine. But I feel like the problem with

209
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:27,245
Speaker 2:  way too many of these smart home gadgets is not just that you

210
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:30,965
Speaker 2:  have to charge it or reinstall

211
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:34,685
Speaker 2:  batteries or whatever, it's that that process is annoying and I, this has

212
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:37,245
Speaker 2:  probably gotten a lot better with these gadgets over time. But it feels like

213
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:40,405
Speaker 2:  you basically have to like unmount the thing, charge the thing,

214
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:45,045
Speaker 2:  reinstall the thing, reconnect the thing, which probably won't work the first.

215
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:47,485
Speaker 2:  So there's just, yes, there's all these little pieces that it's like if I

216
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:50,165
Speaker 2:  could just walk up to it with a double a battery, like pull a thing down,

217
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:53,125
Speaker 2:  stick the battery and put it back on, I'm good. Yeah, I'll do that three

218
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,205
Speaker 2:  times a year. Yeah. But that is not what the process is.

219
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:56,805
Speaker 5:  That's generally not what the process is. No and

220
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:59,245
Speaker 2:  It feels like that to me is the solve problem. Yeah, that is true. Like wireless

221
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:03,005
Speaker 2:  power is like a miracle of of chemistry that I hope we

222
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:05,805
Speaker 2:  accomplish sometime day but just like make it easier to change the batteries.

223
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:06,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

224
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:07,125
Speaker 5:  That's

225
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:07,525
Speaker 2:  True. That

226
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:10,525
Speaker 5:  Seems easier. That is true. There are some where you have to get like a special

227
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,245
Speaker 5:  tool and it's like no.

228
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:15,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's just silliness as far as I'm concerned.

229
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Although, but speaking of wireless power, I was just at EFA in Berlin

230
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:22,485
Speaker 5:  and they, the wireless power consortium have launched the

231
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:26,325
Speaker 5:  first spec for key wireless power. That's

232
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:30,485
Speaker 5:  wireless power for kitchen appliances now. Not necessarily ovens

233
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:34,325
Speaker 5:  and fridges 'cause you don't really need that but for your countertop

234
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:38,085
Speaker 5:  gadgets. So air fryers, microwaves, blenders,

235
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:42,325
Speaker 5:  kettles so that you know, you, it's basically

236
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:46,125
Speaker 5:  induction power. You have induction coils underneath your counter,

237
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,845
Speaker 5:  which can be retrofit also can work with retrofitted

238
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:53,945
Speaker 5:  induction cooktops. There are some new ones coming out that

239
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:57,105
Speaker 5:  have this capability built in and your

240
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:01,625
Speaker 5:  countertop or induction cooktop can power your blender

241
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:05,785
Speaker 5:  or air fryer and you, they were showed me a demo at EFA

242
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:09,505
Speaker 5:  where you just basically put the appliance on the countertop and it

243
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,465
Speaker 5:  turn it on and it will blend or cook or whatever it is you need it

244
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:17,185
Speaker 5:  to do. And what's been, you know, power in the kitchen

245
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:21,305
Speaker 5:  is a challenge. There's, you know, never enough outlets, the

246
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:24,185
Speaker 5:  cord never goes far enough where you are trying to reach. Yeah,

247
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:28,185
Speaker 2:  I really do think the thing where everyone has three gadgets and two

248
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:32,105
Speaker 2:  outlets is like a completely universal experience Yes. Of being a person

249
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:36,065
Speaker 2:  in the world in a kitchen. Like I can, I can tell, I can picture in

250
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:39,865
Speaker 2:  my head the Tetris I have to do every time I make coffee just

251
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:43,585
Speaker 2:  in order to have the, the grinder and the kettle

252
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:47,505
Speaker 2:  and the milk frother, which is my favorite fancy gadget of all time.

253
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:51,785
Speaker 2:  I have to just the, I know which one is which by feel. I could do all that

254
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,705
Speaker 2:  like in the dark now and like it's ridiculous and bad because it's three

255
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,465
Speaker 2:  things and two outlets and If you can solve that problem for me. I'm, I'm

256
00:15:58,465 --> 00:15:59,305
Speaker 2:  in I love this idea.

257
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,065
Speaker 5:  You a happy person. I know, me too. I have the same issue. And

258
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:07,705
Speaker 5:  I also got recently redid my kitchen and just still, even though

259
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:11,465
Speaker 5:  I asked the electrician to put in as many outlets as you could, I still

260
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:15,145
Speaker 5:  don't have enough outlets. And this, you know,

261
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:18,905
Speaker 5:  again, a lot of this feels very much in the future, but the,

262
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:22,745
Speaker 5:  there are, I can see a lot of benefit here, especially in

263
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:26,665
Speaker 5:  the way that your new, the the, obviously it does require all new

264
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:30,585
Speaker 5:  appliances, but the way that they are manufactured because they don't

265
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:33,825
Speaker 5:  need cords, which means they don't need any open

266
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:38,745
Speaker 5:  access to them. They don't have batteries in, it's not a battery charging,

267
00:16:38,745 --> 00:16:41,785
Speaker 5:  it's not like g charging which powers the battery.

268
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:46,385
Speaker 5:  This is just direct power transfer. So the device

269
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:49,225
Speaker 5:  itself still kind of weighs the same, there's not a giant battery in there,

270
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:52,425
Speaker 5:  but it's completely sealed. So the gentleman I was talking to Iffa was like,

271
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:55,745
Speaker 5:  you know, manufacturers can design say your blender so that you could just

272
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:59,185
Speaker 5:  put the entire thing in the dishwasher because there's no open

273
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:03,225
Speaker 5:  ports. And that also could reduce things like wear and tear. 'cause quite

274
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:07,185
Speaker 5:  often it's the power supply that goes first on a, on a lot of these

275
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:11,105
Speaker 5:  devices and these gadgets in your kitchen. So, and it's, they also

276
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:14,745
Speaker 5:  said it's only 10% less efficient than wired power.

277
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,665
Speaker 5:  So it's pretty good.

278
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,025
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

279
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:21,185
Speaker 5:  I think the future of no wires anywhere in our house is kind of an

280
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:21,905
Speaker 5:  interesting one.

281
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:26,425
Speaker 2:  Oh, I agree. I also think I, I like, I I admire your optimism

282
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,065
Speaker 2:  and also I feel like I've been burned by wireless power at this point too

283
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:32,545
Speaker 2:  many times that I'll believe it when I see it. But I do think the,

284
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:36,705
Speaker 2:  the kitchen as a thing with like mostly stationary things

285
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:41,745
Speaker 2:  feels like a good use for that as opposed to like you can charge your

286
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,425
Speaker 2:  phone wirelessly and it's like, that's a lot harder than you think it is.

287
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:48,145
Speaker 2:  But I can just like, I can set this down and it will power, it feels more

288
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:50,405
Speaker 2:  doable. Yeah, I'm excited about that. It

289
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:51,485
Speaker 5:  Feels, it feels pretty smart.

290
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:55,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's, that's very cool. I will say we should, we should switch gears,

291
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:59,205
Speaker 2:  but the fact that we now have key qi and we char

292
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:03,085
Speaker 2:  no this is bad everybody, you have done this wrong.

293
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:07,725
Speaker 2:  Let's, let's, let's all come together and figure out one rhyme

294
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:11,725
Speaker 2:  that we can do together for wireless power. Yes, I agree.

295
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,965
Speaker 2:  So you're, you're doing a big update to the the smart lock buying guide,

296
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:18,005
Speaker 2:  right? Give us a preview. What's your favorite one right now?

297
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:22,245
Speaker 5:  Still a big fan of Yale, the Yale Assure two

298
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:26,565
Speaker 5:  because it comes in so many different flavors, it kind of fits everyone's

299
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:31,205
Speaker 5:  needs. So Yale if, if you're not familiar, has these swappable

300
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:35,005
Speaker 5:  modules. So depend If you decide to change your smart home setup.

301
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:39,325
Speaker 5:  You know you've gone from Z-Wave to Apple Home or Google Home.

302
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:42,805
Speaker 5:  You can easily pop in a different module and be able to have

303
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,565
Speaker 5:  compatibility, which is nice. Although a lot of the locks I tested

304
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:49,765
Speaker 5:  do work sort of universally with different platforms.

305
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:54,485
Speaker 5:  But they also matter is sort of is slowly

306
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:58,045
Speaker 5:  coming into the smart lock space, which will help with compatibility.

307
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:02,245
Speaker 5:  Although I mean a lot of people who buy smart

308
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:06,325
Speaker 5:  locks, it's really just for that it's easier for me to get into my house.

309
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:10,085
Speaker 5:  I don't have to have my key. So you don't necessarily need to set it up with

310
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:13,765
Speaker 5:  your smart home platform. But that's again what I like about Yale is it gives

311
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:17,405
Speaker 5:  you multiple options. You've got fingerprint access,

312
00:19:17,465 --> 00:19:21,245
Speaker 5:  you've got keypad access, you've got lock key

313
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:25,165
Speaker 5:  If, you really insist on using the key. And then also it

314
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:29,125
Speaker 5:  has the auto unlock feature. So if, which is again

315
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,445
Speaker 5:  this hands free concept, which I've never found work

316
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:36,365
Speaker 5:  that well for me, but that's also because I have poor cell service and poor

317
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:40,605
Speaker 5:  GPS in my neighborhood. Fair enough. And it relies on that. But it is nice

318
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:44,045
Speaker 5:  the concept of having your door automatically unlock as you walk up to it.

319
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:47,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And so Yale has that feature which actually got from August,

320
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:52,365
Speaker 5:  which Yale is the sister company of August now. and we

321
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:56,045
Speaker 5:  haven't had a new lock from August for a while. So I think Yale is kind of

322
00:19:57,025 --> 00:20:00,925
Speaker 5:  now the the main sort of smart lock space that

323
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:04,845
Speaker 5:  we're gonna see from what was Asa Aloy now owned by

324
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:05,085
Speaker 5:  Fortune.

325
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:05,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

326
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:09,525
Speaker 5:  The whole smart lock space has got quite complicated. Yes. But Yale,

327
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:13,285
Speaker 5:  yeah, Yale has some really good stuff. They actually just released a new

328
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:17,405
Speaker 5:  retrofit locks which kind of replaces the original iconic

329
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:21,365
Speaker 5:  August retrofit lock, which has been my long been my number one pick for

330
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:25,605
Speaker 5:  your best retrofit lock. And just to clarify what retrofit means, there are

331
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:28,965
Speaker 5:  two types of smart locks. There's a full deadbolt replacement, which is what

332
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:32,805
Speaker 5:  most of the Yale Assure two locks are. So that replaces your entire

333
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:36,405
Speaker 5:  lock. So you're gonna have a different lock on the front and on the back

334
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:40,685
Speaker 5:  a retrofit lock just replaces the back so that you still

335
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,605
Speaker 5:  can use your regular key and Yale's come out with a new

336
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:47,925
Speaker 5:  retrofit lock called the Yale approach and you just replace the back portion

337
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:52,165
Speaker 5:  to add smarts to your lock. And that's really helpful for people who are

338
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:55,925
Speaker 5:  renting and can't swap out their lock. And also If, you have a nice

339
00:20:56,155 --> 00:21:00,125
Speaker 5:  lock set and you don't want a kind of ugly looking smart lock

340
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,605
Speaker 5:  on the front of your door and fair. They've come out with a good solution.

341
00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:06,805
Speaker 5:  And we're seeing this a lot now and I've tested a lot of these for the the

342
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:10,285
Speaker 5:  new update to the buying guide keypads that go with

343
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:14,165
Speaker 5:  retrofit locks so that you can still use a key

344
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:17,765
Speaker 5:  code or a fingerprint to unlock the lock

345
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:22,005
Speaker 5:  without, because that was always an issue with retrofit locks. You couldn't

346
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:25,925
Speaker 5:  actually control it from the outside other than using a key or an app.

347
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,125
Speaker 5:  And when you get to your front door, you don't wanna have to pull out your

348
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,565
Speaker 5:  phone to unlock your door

349
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:33,645
Speaker 2:  No. By then just pull out your key. It's actually simpler to have keys at

350
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:34,085
Speaker 2:  that point. Yeah,

351
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:38,005
Speaker 5:  It's easier to pull out your key, right? Yeah. So now, so the Yale approach

352
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,845
Speaker 5:  comes with a keypad that has a fingerprint reader and a keypad built

353
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:44,885
Speaker 5:  in. So you can use either of those options. And the nice thing about these

354
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:48,965
Speaker 5:  keypads is you don't have to put them like on your door or next to your door.

355
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:52,725
Speaker 5:  They have quite long range so you can kind of have it tucked away and still

356
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,165
Speaker 5:  have your front door look. Oh that's cool. Like a normal front door. So,

357
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:59,525
Speaker 5:  and I've seen, there's a couple other companies, a Cara has a new retrofit

358
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:03,405
Speaker 5:  lock that I've been trying and the Switch bot also has another one that all

359
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,365
Speaker 5:  come with these Bluetooth keypads, which I think is really kind of

360
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:11,205
Speaker 5:  a nice upgrade. And a lot of those also work with Apple

361
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:15,405
Speaker 5:  Home Key, which is new again in the retrofit space, being able to

362
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:19,005
Speaker 5:  use Home Key, which people that use it swear by, they say it's the absolute

363
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:23,005
Speaker 5:  favorite way of getting into a smart lock. 'cause you can put your home key

364
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:26,285
Speaker 5:  on your watch up to the lock. Right. Or you can use your phone,

365
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:30,885
Speaker 5:  obviously phone again, not necessarily easier than key, but

366
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:34,765
Speaker 5:  watch quite easy. So yeah, lots of great options in the lock

367
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:37,845
Speaker 5:  space right now we're seeing new smart locks come out

368
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:40,855
Speaker 5:  almost daily. It's kind of a bit overwhelming.

369
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:45,055
Speaker 2:  It really does seem like that. Well and I think part of me thinks it's, it's

370
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:48,095
Speaker 2:  because of the thing you just mentioned a minute ago is that these are not

371
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:52,695
Speaker 2:  devices that have to like have a grand vision of how do they fit into

372
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:56,575
Speaker 2:  an ecosystem and like tell you a big story about routines in your smart

373
00:22:56,735 --> 00:22:59,695
Speaker 2:  life and like you can build that stuff if If you want. But this thing is

374
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:02,655
Speaker 2:  just like, it's, it makes it easier to get inside of your house, which is

375
00:23:02,655 --> 00:23:06,535
Speaker 2:  just like the single most mainstream home use

376
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:10,215
Speaker 2:  case that anyone has. Everyone needs to get into their house. Yes. That is

377
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,175
Speaker 2:  a thing that happens when you have a house. Any kind and So I think that

378
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:16,655
Speaker 2:  stuff is, is very cool. 'cause it's like in a, in a sort of

379
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:20,495
Speaker 2:  increasingly messy idea of how everything works together. That's one thing

380
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:23,735
Speaker 2:  that just doesn't have to it it can, it can completely do its job

381
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:27,615
Speaker 2:  completely on its own. And I think as we get through this

382
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:31,175
Speaker 2:  messy matter phase, I can see why that would be very enticing to any company

383
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:34,575
Speaker 2:  that wants to build this stuff. But let's talk about Matter. You, you mentioned

384
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:38,055
Speaker 2:  where we are with some of the, the protocol stuff and I think

385
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,815
Speaker 2:  Google has made some big changes. Apple has made some big changes were it

386
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:46,645
Speaker 2:  feels like we've had some good momentum on the how you control

387
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:49,205
Speaker 2:  all of this stuff and how it all works together. But let's start with the

388
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:51,685
Speaker 2:  protocol stuff. There was a big threads update this summer

389
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:54,885
Speaker 5:  Thread. Don't put the S on the end. You're right. 'cause that just confuses

390
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,725
Speaker 5:  everyone. And everyone thinks I'm writing about Meta.

391
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,965
Speaker 2:  Just the one thread there, there was a big thread

392
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:04,525
Speaker 2:  with a D at the end update this summer. There's been

393
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:08,085
Speaker 2:  some ongoing matter news. Catch us up. Where are we in the, the protocol

394
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:08,285
Speaker 2:  world.

395
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:12,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well okay, just before we jump into those protocols,

396
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:15,845
Speaker 5:  there is one protocol I should mention before we move on from Smart locks.

397
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:15,965
Speaker 5:  Oh

398
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:19,445
Speaker 2:  God, is it another wireless charging protocol? How much? Where's the wireless

399
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:20,445
Speaker 2:  power coming from this time?

400
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:25,365
Speaker 5:  No, no, no. This is a LiRo. So this is tied to matter, but this is the

401
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:27,045
Speaker 5:  new smart lock protocol.

402
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:31,245
Speaker 5:  David's just put his head down

403
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:34,325
Speaker 2:  Someday you're gonna come on the show and just make all of this stuff up

404
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:36,845
Speaker 2:  and I'm not gonna know and I'm gonna feel very stupid at the end.

405
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:40,285
Speaker 5:  But no, this ties into what we were just talking about and what we're about

406
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:43,885
Speaker 5:  to talk about. Okay. So a good segue, but Allero is the new

407
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:48,965
Speaker 5:  access control standard from the CSA, which is an organization behind

408
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:52,645
Speaker 5:  Matter, the Connectivity Standards Alliance. And this is why we're seeing

409
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:56,325
Speaker 5:  so much movement in the lock space because it's actually going to help

410
00:24:57,005 --> 00:25:00,805
Speaker 5:  standardize the way we access Smart locks, not just in our homes,

411
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:04,525
Speaker 5:  but maybe even in like our businesses and apartments and

412
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:08,205
Speaker 5:  everywhere. So we're waiting for the standard to actually be

413
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:12,205
Speaker 5:  released. It's likely to involve UWB, which we've discussed

414
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:16,805
Speaker 5:  as well as an fc, which is the tap, which is what Home Key uses.

415
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:21,125
Speaker 5:  And we actually just saw our very first UWB

416
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:25,405
Speaker 5:  supporting Locke get released this last month, although, oh cool.

417
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:29,565
Speaker 5:  It won't work with a LiRo. So it's

418
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:30,845
Speaker 5:  like we're seeing a lot of cut before, so we're

419
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,125
Speaker 2:  Just doing this again. Yeah, we've

420
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:35,165
Speaker 5:  Seen a lot of cut before horses at the moment, but it, it's the excitement

421
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:37,725
Speaker 5:  in this space. And Apple is a huge

422
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:42,685
Speaker 5:  part of developing the Allero standard as are the big

423
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:46,005
Speaker 5:  smartphone companies. Because basically the idea here is that you'll be able

424
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:49,685
Speaker 5:  to use your phone or watch to unlock any door and no matter which

425
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:53,605
Speaker 5:  operating system you're using or which platform you're using, it's the universal

426
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:57,325
Speaker 5:  access. Just like matter is the universal standard for the smart home. This

427
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:00,765
Speaker 5:  is like a universal standard for the smart lock, which is kind of

428
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:04,605
Speaker 5:  connecting you into the smart home. So it's separate from but connected

429
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:08,525
Speaker 5:  to. So this is a space we should be watching quite closely. I

430
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,405
Speaker 5:  think we'll get a lot of movement around CES, especially since Apple announced

431
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:16,125
Speaker 5:  that it's supporting u WB unlocking in Apple Home. So

432
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:20,125
Speaker 5:  anyway, that was just to wrap up Smart Locks and now into Smart

433
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:20,365
Speaker 5:  Home.

434
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:23,885
Speaker 2:  No, it's good. The answer I I've always said is let's invent more protocols,

435
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:26,965
Speaker 2:  more pressure. That's that's what I, I'm glad that we're continuing on the

436
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,165
Speaker 2:  trend of more protocols.

437
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:33,165
Speaker 5:  I know, I know it, but what, it gives me something,

438
00:26:33,165 --> 00:26:34,485
Speaker 5:  it gives me stuff to write about So.

439
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:37,285
Speaker 2:  I know it's true. If if everybody figures this out, we'll be out of jobs.

440
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:41,005
Speaker 2:  Exactly. So like it's, this is for the best. So, but yeah, the,

441
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:44,405
Speaker 2:  the talk to me about threat. Threat with a D and no s The. Thread. Just the

442
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,805
Speaker 2:  one one single thread.

443
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:49,925
Speaker 5:  Okay, so Thread is, as I've written about in the past,

444
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:54,405
Speaker 5:  is one of the two main wireless protocols of format.

445
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:59,885
Speaker 5:  So wifi and Thread Thread's been around for a decade or so prior to

446
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:03,725
Speaker 5:  matter, but it is, and it was originally developed Inside Nest

447
00:27:04,295 --> 00:27:08,045
Speaker 5:  along with a few other companies and it is a low bandwidth, low

448
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:12,005
Speaker 5:  power protocol developed specifically for IOT devices, which

449
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:15,445
Speaker 5:  actually is a sort of a first, whilst we've got things like Z-Wave and ZigBee,

450
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:18,685
Speaker 5:  they weren't necessarily designed for the Smart Home and Thread is designed

451
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,805
Speaker 5:  specifically for the smart home. And so it was sort of re relaunched with

452
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:26,245
Speaker 5:  big fanfare when Matter launched a couple years ago. I was like, this is

453
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:29,485
Speaker 5:  gonna solve all our problems because

454
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:33,885
Speaker 5:  talking about battery life, this is something we've seen throughout the Smart

455
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,085
Speaker 5:  Home. Smart Home device is constantly running outta battery, needing to be

456
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:41,005
Speaker 5:  charged Thread is low power. So supposedly should, especially

457
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:44,005
Speaker 5:  things like smart door locks should not need to

458
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:48,345
Speaker 5:  be recharged or have their batteries replaced frequently if they use Thread.

459
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:52,465
Speaker 5:  But we've been having a lot of issues with threads since it kind of

460
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:57,065
Speaker 5:  launched into the, the broadest smart home space in the last year or

461
00:27:57,065 --> 00:28:00,825
Speaker 5:  two. And just last, no, two weeks ago just around

462
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:04,585
Speaker 5:  EFA when I was at the tech show in Berlin and The Thread group

463
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:09,025
Speaker 5:  launched Thread 1.4, which is basically

464
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:12,905
Speaker 5:  their pania to all the problems that we've seen so far with

465
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:16,505
Speaker 5:  thread specifically around

466
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:20,425
Speaker 5:  interoperability, which is one of the main points of

467
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:24,385
Speaker 5:  matters that we're supposed to be solving here. The idea that anything

468
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:27,825
Speaker 5:  you buy for your smart home, your smart lock, your smart lights should all

469
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:31,585
Speaker 5:  work together no matter which phone you use or which platform you use. And

470
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:35,265
Speaker 5:  so Thread uses something called thread border routers to help

471
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:39,345
Speaker 5:  communicate from your thread device to the internet and to whichever platform

472
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:43,115
Speaker 5:  you want to use. And this wasn't necessarily

473
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:47,555
Speaker 5:  The Thread Group or The Thread protocols problem. I'm trying to

474
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:48,675
Speaker 5:  avoid saying Threads problem.

475
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:50,715
Speaker 5:  Sorry,

476
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,675
Speaker 2:  Thread apostrophe s Yes. Yeah,

477
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:57,715
Speaker 5:  Because every border router is made by a different manufacturer. So

478
00:28:57,715 --> 00:29:01,435
Speaker 5:  you have border routers from Apple, so like your Apple Home pod, your Apple

479
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:05,395
Speaker 5:  TV is a thread border router from a Amazon, your

480
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:09,515
Speaker 5:  Echo, your Echo show, 10 number of

481
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:13,475
Speaker 5:  devices from Amazon. The arrows are thread border routers. Same for

482
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:17,195
Speaker 5:  Google. But unfortunately these thread border routers didn't talk to each

483
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:20,915
Speaker 5:  other and this was causing all sorts of problems because your

484
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:23,995
Speaker 5:  devices, you'd think you'd connected your device to your smart home, but

485
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,675
Speaker 5:  it was on a different network from, say your smart lights might be on a different

486
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:31,115
Speaker 5:  network from your door lock. So it was, it was causing headaches and and

487
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:34,875
Speaker 5:  problems. And so this 1.4 should

488
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:38,475
Speaker 5:  they say fix that specific issue, but we have to wait,

489
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:42,565
Speaker 5:  this is the, this is the thing with these protocols, they come along promising

490
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:46,445
Speaker 5:  all these great solutions and then it's all down to the manufacturers and

491
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:50,085
Speaker 5:  the platforms to then implement them. So we're gonna have to wait for that

492
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:54,055
Speaker 5:  So I mean, I think with, you know, being optimistic, which

493
00:29:54,055 --> 00:29:57,975
Speaker 5:  is definitely my preferred method Absolutely. Of approaching, we

494
00:29:57,975 --> 00:30:01,735
Speaker 5:  should see some movement by around CESI think

495
00:30:01,735 --> 00:30:04,935
Speaker 5:  we'll see a lot of products that are coming out with thread 1.4, but still

496
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:05,815
Speaker 5:  that's a long way away.

497
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:09,375
Speaker 2:  It is. But I will tell you here is the thing that gives me optimism is I

498
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:13,335
Speaker 2:  think the last time you and I talked, my worry was starting

499
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,855
Speaker 2:  to become that this was moving so slowly,

500
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:20,375
Speaker 2:  all that everyone was essentially just gonna give up on all things matter

501
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:24,215
Speaker 2:  and it would be kind of a, a thing that existed but nobody really cared about

502
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:28,295
Speaker 2:  and thus kind of languished. Yeah. And it actually doesn't seem like that's

503
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:32,255
Speaker 2:  the case. I I there, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm missing it, but it doesn't

504
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:35,935
Speaker 2:  seem like there has been sort of reverse momentum where everybody has just

505
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:39,135
Speaker 2:  decided to go back to doing their own things. It's just that it's moving

506
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:42,575
Speaker 2:  slower than we hoped, but it still seems to be actually moving in the right

507
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:46,535
Speaker 2:  direction, which gives me optimism about the fact that we will

508
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:49,695
Speaker 2:  get where we wanna be. It's just gonna take a lot longer than anybody hoped.

509
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:53,975
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think, I think that's, that's spot on. But the problem has been

510
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:57,655
Speaker 5:  I think around expectation

511
00:30:58,395 --> 00:31:02,015
Speaker 5:  and a lot of companies kind of jumped on the bandwagon with Thread and matter

512
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:05,895
Speaker 5:  and we were like, this is our solution. We're going to, you know, make

513
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:09,815
Speaker 5:  everything work with thread and matter and ship it to our customers and it's

514
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:13,455
Speaker 5:  gonna be a great experience. And specifically companies like Nano Leaf and

515
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:17,695
Speaker 5:  Eve who are quite well known in the smart home space, but not

516
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:20,935
Speaker 5:  broadly, very well known. And they were sort of seen this as their opportunity

517
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:24,895
Speaker 5:  to become more sort of household names because their products can

518
00:31:24,895 --> 00:31:28,775
Speaker 5:  be so much easier to use and they've really been burned by these

519
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:32,695
Speaker 5:  things, these protocols not working in the way that it was predicted or

520
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:36,615
Speaker 5:  promised. And so we have seen a lot of companies kind of walk back

521
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:40,855
Speaker 5:  from these protocols at least Nana Leaf specifically created

522
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:42,495
Speaker 5:  its own protocol, another

523
00:31:42,495 --> 00:31:44,015
Speaker 2:  One. Oh no, it did. Oh no,

524
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:48,655
Speaker 5:  Because it's like we can't rely on thread. It's not that we can't rely on

525
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:52,455
Speaker 5:  the protocol itself. It's a great protocol is what that CEO Jimmy

526
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:56,575
Speaker 5:  Chu told me. But it's the way it's implemented by the platforms. And

527
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:59,895
Speaker 5:  this all comes back down to this interoperability issue. And there's something

528
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:03,735
Speaker 5:  you and I have talked about a lot, the different manufacturers, the different

529
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:07,415
Speaker 5:  platforms playing nicely together. Apple playing nicely with Amazon, Google

530
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:11,375
Speaker 5:  playing nicely with Samsung, you know, we all worried that

531
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:15,335
Speaker 5:  that could be the issue eventually that they, you know, they all got together

532
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:18,495
Speaker 5:  to start with, but when, when they all gonna start going there separate ways

533
00:32:18,595 --> 00:32:21,855
Speaker 5:  and causing issues and that's where The Thread water router issue came from.

534
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:25,095
Speaker 5:  But they've come back, they said they're gonna work on it, they should hopefully

535
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:29,175
Speaker 5:  be fixed. But yes, right now, If you went all in on

536
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:32,935
Speaker 5:  thread or If, you went all in on matter. It's not the sort of

537
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:37,015
Speaker 5:  panaya that we were hoping for, but we're getting there and people aren't

538
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:40,805
Speaker 5:  giving up. You are right. There is momentum. It's just not ready for the

539
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,365
Speaker 5:  the real world yet. It's not ready for the people that want a good door lock

540
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,605
Speaker 5:  and a good video doorbell.

541
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:49,965
Speaker 2:  And we are definitely past the point where a lot of these

542
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:54,125
Speaker 2:  companies promised us it would work by now and it doesn't. Right. But it

543
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:58,085
Speaker 2:  will. I still, I I still believe that someday it will. And speaking

544
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:01,645
Speaker 2:  of last thing we should talk about before I let you go is there's been some

545
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:05,565
Speaker 2:  big software changes on that front, right? Like you mentioned Home Key with

546
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:09,405
Speaker 2:  Apple. There's some stuff in iOS 18 that I think has been really

547
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:13,285
Speaker 2:  important to the smart home things. Google is doing a bunch of smart home

548
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:16,965
Speaker 2:  stuff right now with the, with its TV products. I have a TV

549
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:20,765
Speaker 2:  streamer right over there that you and I both really like. Yes. That feels

550
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,845
Speaker 2:  like it's moving in a really good direction, right? Like the, the stuff is

551
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:26,365
Speaker 2:  getting built into the devices it needs to get built into.

552
00:33:26,545 --> 00:33:30,485
Speaker 5:  So yes, so the iOS 18 has an update that's specifically designed to

553
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:33,645
Speaker 5:  address this problem, this problem of, of thread and border routers

554
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:37,725
Speaker 5:  because people were buying a thread device bringing it home and it wasn't

555
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:40,245
Speaker 5:  working because they didn't have a border router. They didn't know they needed

556
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,445
Speaker 5:  a border router because

557
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:43,845
Speaker 2:  You shouldn't have to know that. You shouldn't, no one should have to know

558
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:45,245
Speaker 2:  about border routers.

559
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:48,925
Speaker 5:  Right. And so as you may recall, all

560
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:52,765
Speaker 5:  iPhone 15 pros and newer have

561
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,405
Speaker 5:  thread radios in. Right. And with iOS 18, apple

562
00:33:56,765 --> 00:34:00,125
Speaker 5:  released an update that allows you to add matter devices

563
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:04,405
Speaker 5:  directly to your Apple Home app without requiring any hub,

564
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:08,365
Speaker 5:  either a home hub or an a thread border router. So wifi devices and

565
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:12,325
Speaker 5:  thread devices can connect using your phone directly. I

566
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:16,005
Speaker 5:  mean this isn't an a solution for the long term because If, you want a smart

567
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:19,965
Speaker 5:  home, you do need a hub for orchestration, but it does

568
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:23,845
Speaker 5:  solve the problem of I just bought this cool new smart light and I wanna

569
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:27,285
Speaker 5:  set it up and I don't wanna have to go buy a thread border router. And that's

570
00:34:27,285 --> 00:34:30,765
Speaker 5:  also an answer to sort of why Apple decided to put thread chips

571
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:32,765
Speaker 5:  in their iPhones. They are also,

572
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:35,885
Speaker 2:  Which you kind of called you, you should take just a mini victory lab on

573
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:38,845
Speaker 2:  that one because you were, you were way out in front of that whole story.

574
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:42,965
Speaker 5:  Well it, it did make sense. It's, it's, it's confusing a bit though because

575
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:45,405
Speaker 5:  people are like, oh, well doesn't that make your phone a hub and a thread

576
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:49,365
Speaker 5:  border rack? It's like, well no it's not. But it's

577
00:34:49,365 --> 00:34:52,925
Speaker 5:  like a temporary connection that you can use

578
00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:57,205
Speaker 5:  If, you don't have anything else. It's like a fallback and then,

579
00:34:57,385 --> 00:35:00,485
Speaker 5:  but If, you do want a thread border router that's getting easier.

580
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:04,925
Speaker 5:  There are more and more devices like you mentioned, there's the Google streamer

581
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:08,645
Speaker 5:  that just came out. This is Google's new answer to the Apple TV

582
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:13,085
Speaker 5:  and that is a smart home hub as well as a streamer.

583
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:17,445
Speaker 5:  It has thread border router and matter capabilities and

584
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:21,165
Speaker 5:  also great smart home controls, which I was my favorite thing about this

585
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:25,005
Speaker 5:  device. We said we both would tested out and reviewed it and we try

586
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:28,525
Speaker 5:  all the streamers in our house and most of my family just ends up using

587
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:32,725
Speaker 5:  the regular Samsung remote and going to the built-in os like no.

588
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:36,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But they all love the streamer and they've all set up their own

589
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:40,045
Speaker 5:  profiles and it's like, it's been a huge success in my house. So there you

590
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:44,005
Speaker 5:  go. So, but it's great to see more devices like this that

591
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:47,965
Speaker 5:  kind of have a good use case in your home, but for, for every day. Like you

592
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:51,045
Speaker 5:  would go buy this because you want a good TV streamer, but it's also gonna

593
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:54,405
Speaker 5:  help If. you do want to use a smart home to give you a bit more

594
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,365
Speaker 5:  infrastructure built into your home so that when you come home with that

595
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,485
Speaker 5:  shiny new thread light bulb, it will work and you didn't have to worry about

596
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:04,725
Speaker 5:  it. But what what I'm most excited about right now

597
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:10,005
Speaker 5:  overall with the smart home is where we're going with generative AI

598
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,805
Speaker 5:  because, and this is something that Google talked about a lot

599
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:18,765
Speaker 5:  at its event at what was the last big event they had made by Google? Made

600
00:36:18,765 --> 00:36:19,725
Speaker 2:  By Google I think is what they call it.

601
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:23,675
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Basically both Apple and Amazon we

602
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:27,635
Speaker 5:  know have kind of struggled in this space. Google says it's about to

603
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:31,315
Speaker 5:  release some really interesting updates. I'm interested to see who,

604
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:35,395
Speaker 5:  who gets their first. But where I see the most

605
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:39,195
Speaker 5:  interesting use case of generative AI in the smart home is making the smart

606
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:42,875
Speaker 5:  home easier. It's that natural language that we're being promised, being

607
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:46,635
Speaker 5:  able to just say, oh I'm, I'm a little cold and it's too dark.

608
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:50,675
Speaker 5:  And your smart home voice assistant knows that it should raise the

609
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:54,635
Speaker 5:  thermostat and turn the lights up for you. And Google has promised

610
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:58,755
Speaker 5:  with some new enhancements through

611
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:02,875
Speaker 5:  Gemini for Google Home and the Google Assistant that it's

612
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:06,475
Speaker 5:  gonna be bringing these kind of features to the smart home along with

613
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:10,895
Speaker 5:  interpretive notifications. Which is another thing I'm interested

614
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,535
Speaker 5:  in, like I mentioned at the beginning of this chat that my smart home,

615
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:18,495
Speaker 5:  when my smart home cameras send me notifications nonstop and

616
00:37:18,495 --> 00:37:21,935
Speaker 5:  it's really annoying. So what's happening with Google Home is they're using

617
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:25,935
Speaker 5:  Gemini to sort of filter through your video

618
00:37:25,935 --> 00:37:29,575
Speaker 5:  footage and only send you relevant notifications.

619
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:33,015
Speaker 5:  Like you can say, I only want to know if this person shows up at my front

620
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:36,575
Speaker 5:  door or this car shows up at my front door. Those kind of, you know,

621
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:40,695
Speaker 5:  specific notifications rather than just, oh, there was a breeze and plastic

622
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:41,655
Speaker 5:  bag flew past your

623
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:44,175
Speaker 2:  Right and then back the other way and then back the other way. Yeah.

624
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:47,655
Speaker 5:  Wake you up at one o'clock in the morning. So

625
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:52,415
Speaker 5:  these kind of sort of quality of life make the smart home so much easier

626
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:56,495
Speaker 5:  to use. Less annoying and more

627
00:37:56,565 --> 00:38:00,295
Speaker 5:  intuitive I think will really sort of push smart home

628
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:04,375
Speaker 5:  adoption because there are so many benefits. But like you said at the beginning,

629
00:38:04,725 --> 00:38:08,695
Speaker 5:  just trying to unlock or figure out how to replace a battery. There are

630
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:12,575
Speaker 5:  too many parts of smart home and home automation that require

631
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:16,895
Speaker 5:  a lot of time and attention and reading and Googling and watching YouTube

632
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:20,695
Speaker 5:  videos and reading my articles, which is a good thing. But I

633
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:24,255
Speaker 5:  think we've, we're seeing both Google, Amazon and Apple and Samsung

634
00:38:24,755 --> 00:38:28,575
Speaker 5:  all trying, you know, using generative AI to make

635
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:33,295
Speaker 5:  this experience a lot smoother and therefore hopefully

636
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:37,365
Speaker 5:  encourage more people to kind kind of reap the benefits of, of what

637
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:40,565
Speaker 5:  I think is is a great experience in your home when, when it all works.

638
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,445
Speaker 2:  I agree. I mean, and it seems like we're presumably only weeks

639
00:38:45,595 --> 00:38:49,245
Speaker 2:  away from Amazon launching the, the generative

640
00:38:49,545 --> 00:38:52,605
Speaker 2:  AI underpinnings of Alexa, which we've been hearing about for a long time

641
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:56,725
Speaker 2:  ago. We were at the event, was that a year ago at this point?

642
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,485
Speaker 2:  They were the first ones they a to promise this.

643
00:38:58,665 --> 00:38:59,165
Speaker 5:  Yes. Yeah.

644
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:03,125
Speaker 2:  And So I. And is that the same kind of stuff that you think we're gonna see?

645
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:07,005
Speaker 2:  Like I think honestly if, if Google Assistant and Alexa both

646
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:11,005
Speaker 2:  get even kind of a pretty good version of what you just described, that

647
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:14,765
Speaker 2:  instantly upgrades like many, many millions of people's

648
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,205
Speaker 2:  smart home lives, which I think is very

649
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:19,325
Speaker 5:  Exciting. Very much so. Yeah. I mean Amazon promised, you know, they launched

650
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:22,885
Speaker 5:  all of this a year ago and it's taken a long time. It's not here yet.

651
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:26,485
Speaker 5:  So this is why I'm interested to see when Google's actually gonna implement

652
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:29,445
Speaker 5:  what they've promised. And Apple hasn't even mentioned the smart home,

653
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:34,325
Speaker 5:  you know, none of its Apple intelligence or Siri improvements are specifically

654
00:39:34,325 --> 00:39:38,125
Speaker 5:  for the smart home. It is a difficult space you get,

655
00:39:38,345 --> 00:39:41,765
Speaker 5:  you know, you get hallucinations in the smart home and it can go really,

656
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:45,685
Speaker 5:  really wrong. Yeah. And this is what, speaking to all of the companies

657
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,885
Speaker 5:  involved here, I hear a lot. It's like, it's complicated

658
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:54,005
Speaker 5:  and hard. So I think we're gonna see baby steps. We're

659
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:57,445
Speaker 5:  gonna see, I'm hoping we'll see something from Amazon here. I mean, it's

660
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:01,045
Speaker 5:  fall, we normally have a fall event, it's kind of later than

661
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:05,485
Speaker 5:  normal last year, I think it was this week. So, but we know

662
00:40:05,485 --> 00:40:08,845
Speaker 5:  we've, there's been a lot of reporting on the struggles the company's had

663
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:12,925
Speaker 5:  to really nail this down. And every time I've spoken with an executive

664
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:16,565
Speaker 5:  at Amazon about the new Alexa, they said, well,

665
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:20,045
Speaker 5:  we are working on it. But it's very complicated.

666
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,485
Speaker 5:  So yeah, I think it's, it's a struggle. But when, but if and when we can

667
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:30,085
Speaker 5:  see these solutions, I, I really do think it's gonna be a game changer for

668
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:33,485
Speaker 5:  the smart home. It's gonna just make, it takes it from being something you

669
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:37,045
Speaker 5:  have to program and fiddle with to something that just

670
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:40,005
Speaker 5:  works if, if they get it right.

671
00:40:40,715 --> 00:40:44,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's remains the biggest question. Yes. All right, well we're, we'll,

672
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:47,605
Speaker 2:  we'll have you back on after all this Amazon stuff happens, because I think

673
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:51,485
Speaker 2:  in a very real way with all of this stuff, the, the proof is in the pudding.

674
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:55,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And by the pudding, I mean your house. So we, we'll come back

675
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,805
Speaker 2:  and we'll do this Jen. Thank you as always. Thank

676
00:40:57,805 --> 00:40:57,885
Speaker 5:  You.

677
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:01,725
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we are gonna come back and we're

678
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,525
Speaker 2:  gonna do a mic test. We'll be right back.

679
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:31,300
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So if you've been listening to The Vergecast for a

680
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,805
Speaker 2:  long time, you know that a thing we like to do occasionally is test the

681
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,725
Speaker 2:  microphones on a bunch of different kinds of headphones. The last one

682
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:42,645
Speaker 2:  of these I think we did was the face gadgets, the meta

683
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:45,765
Speaker 2:  ray bands and the Vision Pro and that kind of stuff. And that I thought was

684
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:48,365
Speaker 2:  actually really interesting. The Ray Band Meta Smartt glasses might be the

685
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:52,285
Speaker 2:  best like body worn mic we've tested yet, which is

686
00:44:52,285 --> 00:44:56,205
Speaker 2:  pretty cool. But this time I want to go through

687
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:59,965
Speaker 2:  all of the new headphones that have come out from kind of the major

688
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:03,285
Speaker 2:  headphone companies in the last few months. Because for people who just want

689
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:06,645
Speaker 2:  like a normal set of wireless earbuds, you're suddenly spoiled for choice,

690
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:09,685
Speaker 2:  right? There's the new Pixel Buds Pro two from Google. There's the AirPods

691
00:45:09,685 --> 00:45:12,485
Speaker 2:  four from Apple Samsung has some new Galaxy Buds Pro,

692
00:45:13,435 --> 00:45:17,325
Speaker 2:  nothing has the new ear open. Bose has some stuff.

693
00:45:17,325 --> 00:45:21,045
Speaker 2:  There's just a lot of new options on the market. Chris Welch

694
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:24,925
Speaker 2:  has them all as he has want to do. And so we sent him to a coffee shop

695
00:45:25,145 --> 00:45:28,405
Speaker 2:  and we're gonna talk a little bit about the audio quality and his feelings

696
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:31,805
Speaker 2:  about them overall. But mostly I want to test the microphones because my

697
00:45:31,805 --> 00:45:35,165
Speaker 2:  running theory is that microphones really matter. I mentioned this a bit

698
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:39,005
Speaker 2:  in the intro, but right now so much of using your headphones is

699
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:42,965
Speaker 2:  using them to talk to people or to make videos or to talk to

700
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:47,165
Speaker 2:  Siri or to do this increasingly multimodal AI stuff that these

701
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:50,485
Speaker 2:  companies are talking about. Microphones matter and we don't talk about them

702
00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:53,885
Speaker 2:  enough. And I think to some extent that lets these companies off the hook

703
00:45:54,395 --> 00:45:58,365
Speaker 2:  from building better microphones. Like it's not impossible to be able a very

704
00:45:58,365 --> 00:46:01,045
Speaker 2:  good microphone. It's just hard. And a lot of these companies care a lot

705
00:46:01,045 --> 00:46:04,005
Speaker 2:  about noise cancellation. They care a lot about sound quality and I think

706
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:06,645
Speaker 2:  they should care more about Mike's. So we're gonna talk about Mike's and

707
00:46:06,645 --> 00:46:10,605
Speaker 2:  we're gonna see who is doing the best job right now. Chris Welch is sitting

708
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:14,485
Speaker 2:  in a coffee shop, I assume with lots and lots of headphones

709
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:18,125
Speaker 2:  around, confusing everyone else in the coffee shop. So let's, let's do some

710
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,565
Speaker 2:  testing. Chris Welch. Hello.

711
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,085
Speaker 6:  Hello again.

712
00:46:21,975 --> 00:46:25,765
Speaker 2:  Where are you right now? I feel like I'm, I'm growing to like learn the

713
00:46:25,765 --> 00:46:28,885
Speaker 2:  different spots that you are when we test your buds. Where are we?

714
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:33,165
Speaker 6:  This is my Go-to coffee shop in my neighborhood that I come to

715
00:46:34,065 --> 00:46:37,765
Speaker 6:  fairly often and work from. And yeah, it tends to be, you know,

716
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:40,965
Speaker 6:  pretty loud as most Brooklyn Coffee Shop are. But

717
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,725
Speaker 2:  Do they know you there by now? You're like the guy who shows up with a pile

718
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:47,245
Speaker 2:  of gadgets and takes a bunch of pictures. Like is that they just, they just

719
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:49,565
Speaker 2:  understand Absolutely. When you walk through the door. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

720
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:50,725
Speaker 2:  That's good. I'm glad.

721
00:46:52,265 --> 00:46:56,205
Speaker 2:  So we're here 'cause we're kind of at the end of this year's cycle of

722
00:46:56,705 --> 00:47:00,685
Speaker 2:  new earbuds. You just published the, the Pixel Buds

723
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:04,285
Speaker 2:  Pro two review. You have a bunch of them, so we figured this is a good moment

724
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:08,405
Speaker 2:  to test them. Before we dive in, just give us the list. What are

725
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:09,885
Speaker 2:  we gonna, what are we gonna try here? What do we have?

726
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:14,605
Speaker 6:  We've got the Air Pods four, which I have right now in

727
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:17,725
Speaker 6:  my ears. That's what you're doing. Okay. To start, we've got the Samsung

728
00:47:17,945 --> 00:47:21,645
Speaker 6:  Galaxy Buds three Pro, the Pixel Buds Pro two,

729
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:25,965
Speaker 6:  the new Bose Quiet comes with earbuds that just came out as well. And

730
00:47:26,165 --> 00:47:29,925
Speaker 6:  the nothing opens very is funky open style

731
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:31,685
Speaker 6:  earbuds that were just announced as well. So

732
00:47:31,905 --> 00:47:35,885
Speaker 2:  I'm very excited about those here. Yeah, I, I have developed an like

733
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:39,645
Speaker 2:  unnecessary attachment to an obsession with these open earbuds.

734
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:43,205
Speaker 2:  So I'm, I'm very excited to see if those are any good. And I'm glad you started

735
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:45,805
Speaker 2:  with AirPods. So this is actually good. This is a good first test because

736
00:47:45,845 --> 00:47:49,805
Speaker 2:  I feel like AirPods are a useful control in a lot of

737
00:47:49,805 --> 00:47:53,365
Speaker 2:  this because they're just like the one that everybody has. Yeah, they sound

738
00:47:53,395 --> 00:47:56,925
Speaker 2:  fine. I described them to somebody the other day as like, the nice thing

739
00:47:56,925 --> 00:48:00,765
Speaker 2:  about AirPods is that you can get them to sound like a c plus in almost

740
00:48:00,785 --> 00:48:03,885
Speaker 2:  any situation. Yeah. The downside of the AirPods is you cannot get them to

741
00:48:03,885 --> 00:48:07,445
Speaker 2:  sound better than a c plus in any situation. Like perfect

742
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:09,245
Speaker 2:  scenario, they're gonna sound just like this,

743
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:14,165
Speaker 6:  But that's, that's fine. I guess so, yeah. Yeah. So like, here's their

744
00:48:14,165 --> 00:48:17,525
Speaker 6:  like normal mode, but on phone calls you can do like the voice isolation

745
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:20,925
Speaker 6:  feature, which usually like machine learning to make you sound even clearer.

746
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:24,405
Speaker 6:  We're not getting that unfortunately, but it does get a little bit better

747
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:26,845
Speaker 6:  on phone calls. Yeah. Because day to day

748
00:48:27,225 --> 00:48:30,765
Speaker 2:  The voice isolation, you can only do, it's like phone calls and FaceTime,

749
00:48:30,765 --> 00:48:31,405
Speaker 2:  right? Yeah,

750
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:35,605
Speaker 6:  Exactly. Not here, but you know, they sound fine, which is all you

751
00:48:35,605 --> 00:48:39,085
Speaker 6:  really need. Like 90% of the time If, you just send, if they chat somebody,

752
00:48:39,755 --> 00:48:43,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah, they, they they do the job. Alright, well let's, let's, we've got enough

753
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:46,965
Speaker 2:  of this. Let's switch to the next one. Let's do, let's do Google next.

754
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:48,285
Speaker 6:  Google. That's the most

755
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:52,365
Speaker 2:  Go too. I think that's, that's a good, if I remember correctly, Google has

756
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:56,885
Speaker 2:  outperformed my expectations several times on these tests over the last

757
00:48:56,885 --> 00:48:58,845
Speaker 2:  couple of years. So, I'm, I'm curious about this one. Let's just do it first.

758
00:48:58,855 --> 00:48:59,805
Speaker 2:  We'll see. Yeah.

759
00:48:59,805 --> 00:49:00,445
Speaker 6:  Alright. I'll do it.

760
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:01,445
Speaker 2:  All right. Let's see it.

761
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:06,085
Speaker 2:  All right. Hit me.

762
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:10,525
Speaker 8:  We're back again. You said some buds Pro two,

763
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:12,445
Speaker 8:  they're smaller and lighter

764
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:18,165
Speaker 8:  and the mics have gotten mixed feedback so far.

765
00:49:20,665 --> 00:49:24,245
Speaker 2:  I'm don't see, I'm gonna go decidedly lower than mixed on this one.

766
00:49:25,425 --> 00:49:26,925
Speaker 8:  Really that much of a difference from the

767
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:30,565
Speaker 2:  AirPods even. Do you remember when we did a test on the ferry

768
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:34,525
Speaker 2:  in New York and it was just blindingly obvious how

769
00:49:34,595 --> 00:49:37,965
Speaker 2:  hard some of them were working? Yeah. Like even, even though they were kind

770
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:41,725
Speaker 2:  of working and I could kind of hear you, you could, you could hear how hard

771
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:45,485
Speaker 2:  it was for them to get to that point. That's what I'm getting here too. It's

772
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:49,205
Speaker 2:  like the, one of the things interesting that just happened was between

773
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:53,565
Speaker 2:  recordings here, we just to let everybody in on how this works, we

774
00:49:53,565 --> 00:49:56,605
Speaker 2:  use a app called Riverside and you have to stop and start recording every

775
00:49:56,605 --> 00:49:59,525
Speaker 2:  time you wanna change devices. So we have to stop each time. So, I get to

776
00:49:59,525 --> 00:50:03,405
Speaker 2:  hear like the natural audio coming out of your Mac. And there was

777
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:06,325
Speaker 2:  music playing that I didn't really hear on the AirPods. There was more noise

778
00:50:06,325 --> 00:50:08,845
Speaker 2:  than I expected that I wasn't really hearing on the AirPods. I'm hearing

779
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:09,765
Speaker 2:  all of that now.

780
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:12,845
Speaker 8:  Interesting. There's like no cancellation whatsoever, huh?

781
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:17,165
Speaker 2:  Almost. I, I mean there's some and it's like it's coming and

782
00:50:17,165 --> 00:50:20,245
Speaker 2:  going it's kind of like they're raising and lowering the volume as time goes

783
00:50:20,245 --> 00:50:21,205
Speaker 2:  on. And

784
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:26,565
Speaker 2:  your voice sounds fine. It's like it's picking up more of everything.

785
00:50:26,915 --> 00:50:29,965
Speaker 2:  Okay. So I'm actually like, your voice is a little richer than I was hearing

786
00:50:29,965 --> 00:50:33,885
Speaker 2:  through the iPod or through the AirPods, but so is

787
00:50:33,945 --> 00:50:34,925
Speaker 2:  the background noise

788
00:50:36,025 --> 00:50:39,885
Speaker 8:  Not great? Yeah, but I guess that's a trade off. I'm getting smaller and

789
00:50:39,885 --> 00:50:42,965
Speaker 8:  lighter. They're even further away from my mouth when I'm talking obviously.

790
00:50:42,985 --> 00:50:46,845
Speaker 8:  So it's harder to kind of separate voice from

791
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:50,165
Speaker 8:  background noise. But these also have like clear calling on phone calls,

792
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:53,165
Speaker 8:  which again, you can't do on like video chats unfortunately. So like,

793
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:56,165
Speaker 8:  it should be a little bit better when you're actually talking to someone

794
00:50:56,165 --> 00:50:59,445
Speaker 8:  on the phone. But if you're in a coffee shop, this is what you're trying

795
00:50:59,445 --> 00:50:59,765
Speaker 8:  think you have,

796
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:03,805
Speaker 2:  You know, this makes me think of, do you ever, do you ever do the thing where

797
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:06,085
Speaker 2:  you're wearing noise canceling headphones, like over the ear noise canceling

798
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:09,605
Speaker 2:  headphones and you just kind of take 'em on and off your ears and, and you

799
00:51:09,605 --> 00:51:13,485
Speaker 2:  can sort of hear it pulse the noise in and outside. It feels a little like

800
00:51:13,485 --> 00:51:16,565
Speaker 2:  that as you're talking. It's like a, it, it, it's sort of constantly

801
00:51:16,995 --> 00:51:20,245
Speaker 2:  picking up and letting go of the background noise in a way that is like,

802
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:24,485
Speaker 2:  it, it's, it works, but it's also like a little unnerving as I'm listening

803
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:27,605
Speaker 2:  to it. I think if I was just holding up my phone to my head, it wouldn't

804
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:30,645
Speaker 2:  really bother me. But I'm on like, pretty good headphones in a pretty good

805
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:34,525
Speaker 2:  situation here. And it is like I'm hearing stuff that I was not hearing the

806
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:38,365
Speaker 2:  AirPods. Yeah, it's really interesting. Okay, so yeah, this is,

807
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:42,085
Speaker 2:  we're we're gonna Google like a, like a gently passing grade.

808
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,805
Speaker 2:  I would say, this is not like a disaster. I can hear you,

809
00:51:46,185 --> 00:51:49,845
Speaker 2:  but I can, I can safely already say Google is not going to win

810
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:53,965
Speaker 2:  this evaluation. They do look good though. They're, they do look very

811
00:51:53,965 --> 00:51:57,565
Speaker 2:  nice. They're super small in your ears. That's, it's really nice. And they're,

812
00:51:57,675 --> 00:52:00,805
Speaker 2:  they seem very comfortable from, from what I saw in your review. Very, very

813
00:52:00,805 --> 00:52:01,085
Speaker 2:  comfortable. Very

814
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:04,445
Speaker 8:  Comfortable. I've still got that Mentos look, which you know, is what it

815
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:06,845
Speaker 8:  is. But yeah, you can barely see in your ears anymore, which

816
00:52:06,845 --> 00:52:09,645
Speaker 2:  Is nice. Yeah, when you're head on, I can, I can basically not see them at

817
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:12,805
Speaker 2:  all. That's really cool. Alright, let's switch to the next one. Let's do,

818
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:15,485
Speaker 2:  I don't know, you pick surprise me. What are we doing?

819
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:19,685
Speaker 8:  Let's do Samsung. Get the big three out of the way. Yeah,

820
00:52:19,965 --> 00:52:21,405
Speaker 2:  I love it. All right, let's switch.

821
00:52:26,065 --> 00:52:27,605
Speaker 2:  All right. Samsung buzz. How we doing?

822
00:52:27,935 --> 00:52:31,605
Speaker 6:  These are the Buds three pro. They have stems now just like the AirPods

823
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,725
Speaker 6:  Pro do. So hopefully that makes them a little bit crisper. Clearer.

824
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:38,445
Speaker 6:  Oh my, that was loud. So

825
00:52:38,565 --> 00:52:42,325
Speaker 2:  I didn't hear that at all. This is okay. This is the opposite of what we

826
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,045
Speaker 2:  just heard from Google. This is, this is actually super fun. I'm glad we

827
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:49,005
Speaker 2:  did this in this order because basically the AirPods are the

828
00:52:49,005 --> 00:52:51,925
Speaker 2:  middle. Google is all the way at the end of the spectrum of like, let's make

829
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:55,485
Speaker 2:  this sound kind of as natural as possible, even if it means getting noise

830
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:59,565
Speaker 2:  in and you are just compressed to within an inch of your

831
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:03,125
Speaker 2:  life. But there is no background noise. Like it, it is interesting. It sounds

832
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,685
Speaker 2:  like you are in a silent room.

833
00:53:05,035 --> 00:53:07,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's super loud there. Someone's like suning dishes and stuff over

834
00:53:07,765 --> 00:53:11,165
Speaker 6:  there. So If, you can't hear that. That's impressive. Do I sound like intelligible

835
00:53:11,165 --> 00:53:11,405
Speaker 6:  though?

836
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:15,565
Speaker 2:  Intelligible? Yes. Okay. You almost don't sound like

837
00:53:15,805 --> 00:53:16,165
Speaker 2:  yourself.

838
00:53:17,715 --> 00:53:21,605
Speaker 2:  Like it, it sort of sounds like If you, If you like held up

839
00:53:21,605 --> 00:53:24,725
Speaker 2:  a pillow to your mouth and then had a phone call. Like that's kind of what

840
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:27,565
Speaker 2:  you sound like right now. Okay. I can hear everything you're saying. Yeah,

841
00:53:28,065 --> 00:53:31,925
Speaker 2:  but I mean, it is it, you are processed to death,

842
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:36,165
Speaker 2:  but again, I, I cannot overstate the extent to which I'm not hearing anything

843
00:53:36,165 --> 00:53:38,605
Speaker 2:  but your voice right now. That's kind of wild actually. Yeah.

844
00:53:39,345 --> 00:53:43,285
Speaker 6:  Huh. That's fun. Yeah, and these have been pretty good so far from

845
00:53:43,285 --> 00:53:46,205
Speaker 6:  my voice calls and talking to people I've heard like similar feedback to

846
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:48,885
Speaker 6:  that, that I sound processed but clear. So,

847
00:53:49,115 --> 00:53:52,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And this is, this is a, this is a fun test case because

848
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:57,045
Speaker 2:  normally with these headphones, at least my experience has been that they

849
00:53:57,045 --> 00:54:00,525
Speaker 2:  process your voice less when they're having to process less background noise.

850
00:54:00,925 --> 00:54:04,765
Speaker 2:  So in theory, when you're in like a perfectly quiet space Right,

851
00:54:04,795 --> 00:54:06,125
Speaker 2:  they should all sound better,

852
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:06,925
Speaker 6:  Right?

853
00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:10,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But they'll sound worse in, so we tried to pick, this is a

854
00:54:10,845 --> 00:54:14,805
Speaker 2:  pretty good, like normal-ish use case to like test them, but not

855
00:54:15,065 --> 00:54:19,005
Speaker 2:  overly so. But yeah, this is, this is solid. I

856
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:22,885
Speaker 2:  take this over Google. Okay. 10 times outta 10. Like, it's just more

857
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:26,445
Speaker 2:  pleasant to listen to you, even though you don't sound amazing, just because

858
00:54:26,445 --> 00:54:29,965
Speaker 2:  there's not that kind of roller coaster volume of

859
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:31,365
Speaker 2:  background noise.

860
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:33,965
Speaker 6:  Interesting. And there's a lot of noise in So If you can't hear any of that.

861
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:37,405
Speaker 6:  That's, that's nice. But yeah, these are these, they're great. They sound

862
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:41,285
Speaker 6:  really nice. They have lights on the stems so you can have 'em

863
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:42,725
Speaker 6:  light up when you're talking to people. You know,

864
00:54:42,735 --> 00:54:45,605
Speaker 2:  These are the ones that Samsung just went full AirPods, right? Yes. Like

865
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:48,845
Speaker 2:  they just, they just did AirPods. Absolute. But like the Samsung way. Yeah.

866
00:54:49,435 --> 00:54:50,175
Speaker 6:  Silver. I

867
00:54:50,175 --> 00:54:52,215
Speaker 2:  Don't even mean that as an insult. Like it just is what it is. That's just

868
00:54:52,215 --> 00:54:55,095
Speaker 2:  what Samsung does. Yeah. Yeah. In terms of like

869
00:54:56,465 --> 00:55:00,025
Speaker 2:  pleasant to listen to and wear all day, which has been your favorite of the

870
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:03,465
Speaker 2:  bunch. If you're gonna just like do your life wearing headphones, do you

871
00:55:03,465 --> 00:55:03,825
Speaker 2:  have a favorite?

872
00:55:05,485 --> 00:55:08,665
Speaker 6:  I'd probably say a tie between these

873
00:55:10,165 --> 00:55:13,705
Speaker 6:  and the pixel boats. Honestly, those are newer. So I'm So I just kinda used

874
00:55:13,705 --> 00:55:17,585
Speaker 6:  to those. These I've used a ton and yeah, they feel like AirPods Pro

875
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:21,785
Speaker 6:  and you know, they're stable, they fit well, they sound really nice. They

876
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:25,705
Speaker 6:  do all the Samsung ecosystem tricks, so, you know,

877
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:28,545
Speaker 6:  they're not super original, but at this point

878
00:55:29,335 --> 00:55:31,905
Speaker 6:  they're all the same. So yeah. But yeah.

879
00:55:32,785 --> 00:55:33,835
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah, I'm

880
00:55:33,835 --> 00:55:35,555
Speaker 6:  Good to hear that. You can hear me very clearly. That's

881
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:38,755
Speaker 2:  I'm impressed. Yeah, like you sound very clear, but you don't sound very

882
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:40,995
Speaker 2:  good. And if I have to make that trade, I'll make that trade, you know what

883
00:55:40,995 --> 00:55:43,715
Speaker 2:  I mean? Like, I'd love to have it both ways, but I will, I will pick this

884
00:55:43,985 --> 00:55:47,355
Speaker 2:  over the alternative. Fair. All right, let's, let's switch, let's do,

885
00:55:48,235 --> 00:55:49,835
Speaker 2:  let's do pose next. You tell

886
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,275
Speaker 6:  Mes next? Yeah, let's do it. All right,

887
00:55:51,605 --> 00:55:52,075
Speaker 2:  Let's switch.

888
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:58,115
Speaker 2:  All right. Bose time. How we doing?

889
00:55:58,665 --> 00:55:58,955
Speaker 6:  Just

890
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,155
Speaker 8:  Have a brand new quiet comfort

891
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:03,875
Speaker 6:  Here for those second generation. You're already laughing. That's not a good

892
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:07,595
Speaker 2:  Time. Was I just very loud in your ears? Just then you like startled as I

893
00:56:07,595 --> 00:56:09,155
Speaker 2:  said something. Oh, okay. No, that was good.

894
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:10,555
Speaker 6:  Okay. Just making sure,

895
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:14,435
Speaker 8:  Make sure I can hear you too. Just came out this past wheat

896
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:19,235
Speaker 8:  and they have really good, super good noise cancellation. Multiple from

897
00:56:19,235 --> 00:56:22,715
Speaker 8:  those through smaller than faster, but cheaper.

898
00:56:22,945 --> 00:56:26,805
Speaker 8:  1 7 9. Same as the AirPod four. You have tips obviously,

899
00:56:26,805 --> 00:56:28,125
Speaker 8:  whereas the AirPod four do not,

900
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:32,165
Speaker 8:  but so far I like to apply the best.

901
00:56:32,895 --> 00:56:34,145
Speaker 6:  Okay. Sound.

902
00:56:35,345 --> 00:56:38,185
Speaker 2:  I don't, I don't wanna be hyperbolic here. This is awful.

903
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:40,185
Speaker 6:  It's

904
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:44,065
Speaker 2:  So bad. This is the first time I can't

905
00:56:44,065 --> 00:56:47,905
Speaker 2:  understand some of the words that you're saying. And, and again,

906
00:56:47,945 --> 00:56:51,745
Speaker 2:  I wonder if an experience, I've had So I have a pair of Bs like over

907
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:55,665
Speaker 2:  ear quiet comforts and the, the impression that I get every

908
00:56:55,665 --> 00:56:58,945
Speaker 2:  time I use them is kind of what I was saying before, that the mic is, it's

909
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:02,705
Speaker 2:  never good, but it's fine when there's not a lot of

910
00:57:02,705 --> 00:57:06,425
Speaker 2:  noise. But Bose seems to so aggressively prioritize

911
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:10,265
Speaker 2:  noise cancellation over audio quality that when you get

912
00:57:10,265 --> 00:57:13,945
Speaker 2:  into bad sound, it will just destroy everything else in the name of noise

913
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:16,785
Speaker 2:  cancellation. So I'm guessing you're sitting there and it's like not very

914
00:57:16,785 --> 00:57:17,705
Speaker 2:  loud to you and it all sounds

915
00:57:19,075 --> 00:57:19,615
Speaker 6:  Not so much

916
00:57:20,085 --> 00:57:22,895
Speaker 2:  It's, it's just ruining it pretty high. Yeah.

917
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:28,575
Speaker 2:  It's doing a decent job of suppressing the background noise. It's actually

918
00:57:28,685 --> 00:57:31,695
Speaker 2:  like, it's better now than it was when we started, which is interesting.

919
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:34,055
Speaker 2:  It's like, it, it's, it took the processing a minute to like figure it out,

920
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:37,455
Speaker 2:  but it seems to have cut a bunch of the background noise. Okay. But you sound

921
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:37,855
Speaker 2:  like trash

922
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:42,055
Speaker 6:  Sounds absolute trash. It's really these important

923
00:57:42,055 --> 00:57:43,495
Speaker 6:  meetings. That's good to know.

924
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:47,335
Speaker 2:  Yeah. This is, this is not the one to take a zoom call in a coffee shop with

925
00:57:47,365 --> 00:57:50,855
Speaker 2:  that is like, basically the, the two reasons we do this test are like,

926
00:57:51,765 --> 00:57:55,465
Speaker 2:  are you the worst? If you're on a video call with these and, you know,

927
00:57:55,675 --> 00:57:58,625
Speaker 2:  grand theories about how we talk to AI and all that stuff, like, I really

928
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:01,785
Speaker 2:  do believe microphones matter. This one will fail at both of those tests.

929
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,105
Speaker 2:  And I feel very confident about that.

930
00:58:03,235 --> 00:58:06,105
Speaker 6:  Yikes. Big yikes. Okay. Well they're good at everything else

931
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:07,505
Speaker 6:  so far.

932
00:58:08,215 --> 00:58:11,585
Speaker 2:  Yeah, these are good listening headphones. Like Bose Bose makes very good

933
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:15,145
Speaker 2:  headphones to listen to. Please don't call me from these

934
00:58:15,655 --> 00:58:17,585
Speaker 6:  Ever again. Okay.

935
00:58:19,385 --> 00:58:22,145
Speaker 2:  All right. Let's, let's get off this one as quickly as we can. Yeah. Let's,

936
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,465
Speaker 2:  let's go to the next one. What gonna do next?

937
00:58:23,905 --> 00:58:26,425
Speaker 6:  Let's do the nothings the funky open ones. Sweet.

938
00:58:26,425 --> 00:58:26,785
Speaker 2:  Love it.

939
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:27,345
Speaker 6:  Do that

940
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:27,625
Speaker 8:  Right now.

941
00:58:33,445 --> 00:58:37,345
Speaker 2:  All right. Nothing. The, nothing ear open. That's what they're called,

942
00:58:37,345 --> 00:58:38,025
Speaker 2:  right? How we do it.

943
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:41,785
Speaker 6:  It's, yeah. These are the first call I actually had on these period.

944
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:42,305
Speaker 6:  So

945
00:58:43,215 --> 00:58:43,705
Speaker 2:  It's an honor.

946
00:58:43,705 --> 00:58:45,105
Speaker 6:  It's one experience for us both.

947
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:49,905
Speaker 2:  I kind of like how those look in your ears. I have to say it's a little,

948
00:58:49,975 --> 00:58:53,745
Speaker 2:  it's they're, they're a little more like deliberately space agey

949
00:58:53,745 --> 00:58:56,985
Speaker 2:  than anything else you've tried. They've got the, the sort of ear hook

950
00:58:58,645 --> 00:59:02,425
Speaker 2:  and slight Yeah. They just, they just look like you're wearing some kind

951
00:59:02,425 --> 00:59:06,345
Speaker 2:  of futuristic star trekky headset. Okay. Which is not the worst

952
00:59:06,345 --> 00:59:06,705
Speaker 2:  thing in the world.

953
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:12,425
Speaker 6:  Some people love this for like bike riding and that kind of, those kind of

954
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:16,105
Speaker 6:  activities. I'm not an open earbud guy, but I can see the appeal. Like I,

955
00:59:16,225 --> 00:59:18,745
Speaker 6:  I can hear everything in this room right now. That's just kind of absurd.

956
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:22,765
Speaker 6:  So like, you sound pretty quiet compared to like all this right racket from

957
00:59:22,765 --> 00:59:26,565
Speaker 6:  the moon, but how does the voice quality compare to Pretty

958
00:59:26,655 --> 00:59:30,405
Speaker 2:  Solid? Actually, I would put this kind of right in the

959
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:34,365
Speaker 2:  AirPods range. I'm getting a little bit of the background noise. Like I can

960
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:37,845
Speaker 2:  tell you're in a coffee shop, unlike the Samsungs

961
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:41,885
Speaker 2:  where it was like truly just deathly quiet. I can,

962
00:59:42,075 --> 00:59:45,765
Speaker 2:  it's clear you're somewhere, but I'm only catching kind of

963
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:49,245
Speaker 2:  bits and pieces of the background noise. Like I can tell there's a, there's

964
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:52,845
Speaker 2:  a woman talking somewhere near you. Yeah, but I'm only catching like,

965
00:59:53,245 --> 00:59:56,005
Speaker 2:  snippets, like syllables of it instead of like the whole conversation.

966
00:59:57,185 --> 01:00:01,005
Speaker 2:  And I can hear you pretty clearly actually this, I'm, I'm, I'm sort of impressed

967
01:00:01,025 --> 01:00:01,445
Speaker 2:  by these.

968
01:00:02,105 --> 01:00:04,725
Speaker 6:  See, I'm not sure where the mics are in this particular, like, there's like

969
01:00:04,725 --> 01:00:08,685
Speaker 6:  a stem that runs down here, so who knows? But they're pretty funky. They're

970
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:12,605
Speaker 6:  fun, they're interesting. But it's good to know If, you're gonna make

971
01:00:12,605 --> 01:00:16,005
Speaker 6:  phone calls on your bike or wherever you might be, or in these

972
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:20,045
Speaker 6:  people will be able to understand you. I'm getting so many looks at this

973
01:00:20,045 --> 01:00:23,725
Speaker 6:  coffee shop, doing this call being that guy who I see

974
01:00:23,725 --> 01:00:24,245
Speaker 6:  every day.

975
01:00:25,795 --> 01:00:28,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll only keep you a couple more minutes, I promise.

976
01:00:28,205 --> 01:00:31,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But I think the part of the reason I'm, I'm interested in these is

977
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:34,885
Speaker 2:  like, you, you, I hear from people all the time who are like, yeah, I'm trying

978
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:38,765
Speaker 2:  to do more phone calls while I'm walking. Right? It's just the like,

979
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:41,245
Speaker 2:  like I work from home now. I sit in my basement all day and I'm trying to

980
01:00:41,245 --> 01:00:43,805
Speaker 2:  do more of that too. Just get out and it's like, oh, we're gonna talk for

981
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:46,285
Speaker 2:  a half hour. I'm gonna just wander around the neighborhood for a half hour.

982
01:00:46,285 --> 01:00:50,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And that's one reason that a open ear is useful. Like,

983
01:00:50,205 --> 01:00:53,405
Speaker 2:  I think for this particular case in a coffee shop, open ear headphones are

984
01:00:53,605 --> 01:00:57,165
Speaker 2:  actually the wrong answer. So like, for this purpose, you probably wouldn't

985
01:00:57,185 --> 01:01:00,605
Speaker 2:  use these. Yeah. Even though they sound okay, but for like

986
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:04,845
Speaker 2:  general sort of day-to-Day life, like it's the same reason I like the, the

987
01:01:04,945 --> 01:01:08,325
Speaker 2:  RayBan meta smart glasses, right? Like I can just sort of have a conversation

988
01:01:08,355 --> 01:01:12,285
Speaker 2:  into my sunglasses in a way that sort of works. And I feel like

989
01:01:12,285 --> 01:01:15,365
Speaker 2:  this is appealing to me for the same reason. And they sound pretty good.

990
01:01:15,475 --> 01:01:19,205
Speaker 2:  Cool. It's not, it's not the best one, but it is, it's kind of right in that

991
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:23,245
Speaker 2:  sweet spot middle with the, the AirPods that I, I'm, I'm sort of impressed

992
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:23,405
Speaker 2:  with.

993
01:01:23,885 --> 01:01:26,725
Speaker 6:  Interesting. Okay. Good to know. Should I switch back to the AirPods for

994
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,605
Speaker 6:  the conclusion or? Yeah, let's,

995
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:31,085
Speaker 2:  Let's switch back. Now that I've heard all of them, let's go back to the

996
01:01:31,085 --> 01:01:33,125
Speaker 2:  AirPods and we can, we can, we can pick a favorite here.

997
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:34,445
Speaker 6:  Alright, let's do it. All right.

998
01:01:39,785 --> 01:01:41,565
Speaker 2:  All right. So we're back on the AirPods four.

999
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:46,165
Speaker 6:  We are, and these still sounds pretty serviceable.

1000
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:50,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. This, it's such a boring answer, but I think of this

1001
01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:53,605
Speaker 2:  round, this is actually probably my favorite. I think

1002
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:58,485
Speaker 2:  the, there's a little more background noise here than there was on

1003
01:01:58,485 --> 01:02:02,285
Speaker 2:  the nothings, but it's also a little less, I'm

1004
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:05,445
Speaker 2:  realizing like a, a little bit of consistent background noise

1005
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:08,805
Speaker 2:  is actually less annoying than, than

1006
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:12,805
Speaker 2:  background noise. Yeah. It's like this, you just kind of have that low

1007
01:02:13,635 --> 01:02:16,565
Speaker 2:  tone behind you all the time. And so it's actually easier for me to pick

1008
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:19,525
Speaker 2:  out your voice, whereas like the pixel buds which kept coming in and out

1009
01:02:19,525 --> 01:02:22,365
Speaker 2:  were like giving me a headache trying to figure out what was going on.

1010
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:27,045
Speaker 2:  But I'm curious. Eric Gomez our producer. Hi, Eric is here.

1011
01:02:27,415 --> 01:02:31,325
Speaker 2:  Hello. You have been listening to and making all of this work. What do you

1012
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:33,085
Speaker 2:  make of all of this? You're the, you're the audio expert here.

1013
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:38,085
Speaker 9:  Definitely impressed by the Samsung,

1014
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:42,205
Speaker 9:  but the quality is, yes, it's being squished

1015
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:45,805
Speaker 9:  and compressed to death, but at least you're not picking up anything

1016
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:50,845
Speaker 9:  going on in the background at all. And it's pretty, you know,

1017
01:02:50,845 --> 01:02:53,965
Speaker 9:  it's, it's clear enough and it's coherent enough to be able to have a good

1018
01:02:53,965 --> 01:02:57,725
Speaker 9:  conversation. And I'm really surprised by the pixel buts.

1019
01:02:57,725 --> 01:02:58,605
Speaker 9:  They're just not,

1020
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,445
Speaker 2:  Just not impressive. Yeah.

1021
01:03:01,955 --> 01:03:05,405
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I'm really disappointed in that. You know,

1022
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:09,965
Speaker 9:  I, I think Google did a good job in terms of hardware this, this round, but

1023
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:13,845
Speaker 9:  I'm just a little disappointed by the quality of the mic on that, on, on

1024
01:03:13,845 --> 01:03:15,125
Speaker 9:  these pixel buts, So,

1025
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:18,965
Speaker 2:  I do wonder, I mean, Welch, you mentioned that they're smaller

1026
01:03:19,345 --> 01:03:22,925
Speaker 2:  and thus just further away from your mouth. And I wonder at some point if

1027
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:26,885
Speaker 2:  that just be, is like an insurmountable physics problem? Like the, the things

1028
01:03:26,885 --> 01:03:30,845
Speaker 2:  with stems tend to be better because they have stems. Like it just is

1029
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:31,805
Speaker 2:  a, seems to be a fact.

1030
01:03:32,965 --> 01:03:35,445
Speaker 6:  I think So I mean, I don't wanna see everybody do stems. So that would be

1031
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:38,165
Speaker 6:  boring. So I, hope they can find a way to like, you know, like use machine

1032
01:03:38,325 --> 01:03:42,005
Speaker 6:  learning or AI or whatnot to like find some way to fix this problems.

1033
01:03:42,815 --> 01:03:45,205
Speaker 6:  Maybe the pixel bullets will sound better on like phone calls with clear

1034
01:03:45,205 --> 01:03:47,685
Speaker 6:  call line. Like so far I haven't gotten so many complaints there, so that

1035
01:03:47,685 --> 01:03:51,365
Speaker 6:  might, that might make a difference versus just like, just overall audio

1036
01:03:51,485 --> 01:03:55,325
Speaker 6:  mode. But yeah, it's clearly that all

1037
01:03:55,325 --> 01:03:59,005
Speaker 6:  that Samsung and Apple are kind of the head honchos here and

1038
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:01,765
Speaker 6:  the rest are kind of okay at best.

1039
01:04:02,275 --> 01:04:06,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. The wi the winner for most improved is Samsung for sure. I think

1040
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:09,805
Speaker 2:  the, the last time we did this, I think Samsung came in last and it was,

1041
01:04:09,865 --> 01:04:13,405
Speaker 2:  it was the one that was like borderline unintelligible.

1042
01:04:13,985 --> 01:04:17,565
Speaker 2:  And, and I think Samsung here is either in first or second place

1043
01:04:17,565 --> 01:04:21,445
Speaker 2:  depending on just kind of what you like, like the, the thing for

1044
01:04:21,445 --> 01:04:25,325
Speaker 2:  me of that sort of eerie quiet, super compressed just doesn't

1045
01:04:25,325 --> 01:04:28,365
Speaker 2:  sound as good as what I'm hearing now from the AirPods, which just feels

1046
01:04:28,445 --> 01:04:31,925
Speaker 2:  a little more natural. It's like if I were sitting across from you at a coffee

1047
01:04:31,925 --> 01:04:34,805
Speaker 2:  shop, that's what it would sound like. Okay. But I can also understand that

1048
01:04:34,865 --> 01:04:38,845
Speaker 2:  if what's clear is also, if there is one that you are gonna trust in awful

1049
01:04:38,855 --> 01:04:42,485
Speaker 2:  situations to keep you intelligible, it's probably the Galaxy Buds, right?

1050
01:04:42,485 --> 01:04:44,405
Speaker 2:  Eric? Is that, is that your takeaway here?

1051
01:04:44,595 --> 01:04:46,845
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I I I would have to agree with

1052
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:49,165
Speaker 2:  That. They're like the worst case scenario buds.

1053
01:04:49,275 --> 01:04:51,445
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Don't, don't use 'em. Good

1054
01:04:51,445 --> 01:04:54,405
Speaker 6:  To know for the future, whenever I'm stranded somewhere and I carry around

1055
01:04:54,405 --> 01:04:57,965
Speaker 6:  like several pairs of beer buds at all times, so it's nice to know that those

1056
01:04:57,965 --> 01:04:58,565
Speaker 6:  are the ones.

1057
01:04:58,655 --> 01:05:01,085
Speaker 9:  Don't don't call 9 1 1 with those buds. Yeah.

1058
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:06,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They'll be like, this is fine. You can't hear anything. Yeah. All right,

1059
01:05:06,045 --> 01:05:09,845
Speaker 2:  good. Well we, we've, we've done it. I just, I would love for somebody

1060
01:05:09,845 --> 01:05:13,085
Speaker 2:  to just like blow my mind here. That's, that's everyone's charge for next

1061
01:05:13,085 --> 01:05:16,085
Speaker 2:  time. It's just like, do slightly better. We're still at a point where the,

1062
01:05:16,085 --> 01:05:19,725
Speaker 2:  the RayBan Meadow ones are the like, best sounding ones we've tested

1063
01:05:20,615 --> 01:05:20,965
Speaker 6:  Maybe

1064
01:05:21,345 --> 01:05:24,685
Speaker 2:  In the history of this segment on The Vergecast. Still

1065
01:05:24,685 --> 01:05:27,325
Speaker 6:  Haven't ever tried those myself, but I want one of those nuclear colors.

1066
01:05:27,955 --> 01:05:28,365
Speaker 2:  They look

1067
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:29,725
Speaker 6:  Awesome. Awesome. Glasses look awesome.

1068
01:05:29,915 --> 01:05:33,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I have two pairs now and I don't want one of them. So you

1069
01:05:33,845 --> 01:05:34,405
Speaker 2:  can have one of

1070
01:09:34,815 --> 01:09:37,715
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the hotline as always. The number is

1071
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:41,435
Speaker 2:  8 6 6 VERGE one one. The email is vergecast at The Verge dot com.

1072
01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:45,475
Speaker 2:  You can hit me up personally on threads or on signal. We try to answer at

1073
01:09:45,475 --> 01:09:49,035
Speaker 2:  least one hotline question on the show every week. And actually I think we're

1074
01:09:49,035 --> 01:09:52,875
Speaker 2:  due for like a full hotline episode. We've gotten a lot of fun stuff. We're

1075
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:56,275
Speaker 2:  in deep gadget season right now, so we've gotten a lot of gadget questions.

1076
01:09:57,095 --> 01:09:59,915
Speaker 2:  We will probably get to all of those at some point in the very near future,

1077
01:10:00,215 --> 01:10:03,875
Speaker 2:  but for now we have a question that feels so, so very birge Casty.

1078
01:10:04,045 --> 01:10:04,595
Speaker 2:  Let's hear it.

1079
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:09,515
Speaker 10:  Hey Birge, this is Jeff from North Carolina. I was

1080
01:10:09,515 --> 01:10:12,835
Speaker 10:  listening to your latest episode on Meta's New Glasses and

1081
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:17,235
Speaker 10:  I'm wondering, I remember, I believe it was Sky Galloway made a

1082
01:10:17,235 --> 01:10:20,795
Speaker 10:  comment that any product that you're wearing on your body that makes you

1083
01:10:20,795 --> 01:10:24,515
Speaker 10:  less attractive will never succeed. I'm wondering If,

1084
01:10:24,935 --> 01:10:28,715
Speaker 10:  you think with the Vision Pro and then now the Meta Smart Glasses,

1085
01:10:28,985 --> 01:10:32,875
Speaker 10:  this will apply that If, you don't look cool in them. No one's gonna

1086
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:35,755
Speaker 10:  buy them. Love the show. Thanks very much. Bye.

1087
01:10:36,555 --> 01:10:39,295
Speaker 2:  All right. There is only one person on earth who can answer this question.

1088
01:10:39,775 --> 01:10:43,055
Speaker 2:  The Scott Galloway of The Vergecast. I call him sometimes brutal,

1089
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:44,295
Speaker 11:  Brutal

1090
01:10:44,835 --> 01:10:45,855
Speaker 2:  Ne left tell. Why would

1091
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:47,655
Speaker 11:  She invite me here to insult me to my face?

1092
01:10:50,395 --> 01:10:50,855
Speaker 2:  Hey buddy,

1093
01:10:51,285 --> 01:10:52,415
Speaker 11:  This is my own show.

1094
01:10:54,815 --> 01:10:56,975
Speaker 2:  I didn't even prepare you for this. You didn't even get to listen to this

1095
01:10:56,975 --> 01:10:59,535
Speaker 2:  ahead of time. This was just, I, this is everything I wanted to. Hey, would

1096
01:10:59,535 --> 01:10:59,655
Speaker 2:  you

1097
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,895
Speaker 11:  Like to walk into your own house? Me slapped in the face.

1098
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:04,695
Speaker 11:  Amazing.

1099
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:08,575
Speaker 2:  So I. Love this question for two reasons. One, because I think it's a good

1100
01:11:08,695 --> 01:11:12,375
Speaker 2:  question and two, because it, it threatens the very core of

1101
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:16,365
Speaker 2:  Neli Patel's theory of wearable bullshit, which is just this, this

1102
01:11:16,365 --> 01:11:19,085
Speaker 2:  just says, actually it doesn't even matter if it doesn't make you look cool.

1103
01:11:19,235 --> 01:11:23,085
Speaker 2:  It's out So I want, I want to know your thoughts on, on this particular take

1104
01:11:23,085 --> 01:11:23,845
Speaker 2:  with these devices.

1105
01:11:24,675 --> 01:11:28,005
Speaker 11:  Well, you'll recall that the, the matrix of wearable bullshit has a

1106
01:11:28,975 --> 01:11:32,925
Speaker 11:  minus 100 face penalty. Right? Which

1107
01:11:32,925 --> 01:11:36,645
Speaker 11:  is basically what we're talking about here because you can put all

1108
01:11:36,645 --> 01:11:40,425
Speaker 11:  kinds of stuff on your body that makes you look uncool. People wear

1109
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:43,865
Speaker 11:  fanny packs all day long. Fair first walking around. They're not even wearing

1110
01:11:43,985 --> 01:11:45,105
Speaker 11:  'em on their Fannie from what I'm told.

1111
01:11:45,975 --> 01:11:47,745
Speaker 2:  Yeah, they're slings now. Yeah.

1112
01:11:47,855 --> 01:11:51,545
Speaker 11:  It's, it's watches. Incredibly subjective fashion choices, true

1113
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:56,385
Speaker 11:  clothing itself, shoes, the, the way people talk about shoes in this

1114
01:11:56,385 --> 01:11:56,625
Speaker 11:  world.

1115
01:11:58,365 --> 01:12:01,465
Speaker 11:  All, all kinds of ideas about things you put on your body. It's really just,

1116
01:12:02,365 --> 01:12:06,005
Speaker 11:  do you have it on your face that sets people a flame,

1117
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:09,285
Speaker 11:  right? That's the thing we're talking about here. Is it on your face? Is

1118
01:12:09,285 --> 01:12:13,125
Speaker 11:  it in your way? And the, the matrix of wearable

1119
01:12:13,285 --> 01:12:17,055
Speaker 11:  bullshit is fids versus utility. And then

1120
01:12:17,055 --> 01:12:20,895
Speaker 11:  there's just like this like big penalty for face somewhere in there

1121
01:12:20,895 --> 01:12:24,055
Speaker 11:  that brings you way below the line. And then you have to offer vastly more

1122
01:12:24,055 --> 01:12:28,015
Speaker 11:  utility to get back above the line so that people wear it every day. Regular

1123
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:28,495
Speaker 11:  glasses

1124
01:12:30,315 --> 01:12:33,375
Speaker 11:  on your face, they take the penalty, but they're pretty useful to most people.

1125
01:12:33,925 --> 01:12:37,775
Speaker 11:  True. So they, they come back up and now we've, you know, over decades

1126
01:12:37,985 --> 01:12:41,815
Speaker 11:  we've turned glasses into fashion accessories. Well, okay, so that's

1127
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:42,295
Speaker 11:  made this choice

1128
01:12:42,485 --> 01:12:45,855
Speaker 2:  That, that's the thing that I keep thinking about, thinking about this. 'cause

1129
01:12:45,855 --> 01:12:49,775
Speaker 2:  there, there's basically two ways to look at this. One is these things

1130
01:12:49,775 --> 01:12:53,615
Speaker 2:  will never be cool and the only way they're ever going to work

1131
01:12:53,795 --> 01:12:57,575
Speaker 2:  is if we make them so phenomenally useful that it doesn't matter.

1132
01:12:57,745 --> 01:13:01,335
Speaker 2:  Right. And I feel like, I don't know, like wired headphones is probably a

1133
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,975
Speaker 2:  good example of that, right? Like, I don't know that a, a pair of ear

1134
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:08,775
Speaker 2:  EarPods is like cool, but they're like simple and they're useful and we all

1135
01:13:08,775 --> 01:13:12,735
Speaker 2:  just kind of gut over it, right? That that crossed the threshold with

1136
01:13:12,735 --> 01:13:16,615
Speaker 2:  utility, not with cool. The other option is that in some way

1137
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:21,415
Speaker 2:  someone figures out how to make these things actually objectively

1138
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:25,375
Speaker 2:  cool and then, and then it flips, right? Like in glasses,

1139
01:13:26,405 --> 01:13:29,895
Speaker 2:  some people like how they look in glasses better than how they look without

1140
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:33,535
Speaker 2:  glasses. Like that's a real thing. We have made them a fashion object and

1141
01:13:34,525 --> 01:13:37,935
Speaker 2:  that seems like a much harder road for any kind of technology,

1142
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:42,095
Speaker 2:  but is maybe the actually most effective way to get there. It's just make

1143
01:13:42,095 --> 01:13:45,775
Speaker 2:  them objectively cool. Figure out how to make it like iconically awesome

1144
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:49,735
Speaker 2:  to have ski goggles on your face and then none of the rest of it even

1145
01:13:49,735 --> 01:13:50,295
Speaker 2:  matters. But,

1146
01:13:50,315 --> 01:13:52,895
Speaker 11:  But this is, I think what Apple tried with the Vision Pro. They tried to

1147
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,775
Speaker 11:  make it cool and it fell on its face. 'cause it just, we can't be,

1148
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:57,695
Speaker 11:  it

1149
01:13:57,695 --> 01:13:58,375
Speaker 2:  Just isn't.

1150
01:13:59,045 --> 01:14:03,015
Speaker 11:  Well ski go, there are some ski goggles. Like cool. I I've certainly seen

1151
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:07,655
Speaker 11:  like sweet pictures of eighties people wearing ski

1152
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:11,565
Speaker 11:  goggles. True. They look cool as hell. Have you ever seen the movie ski

1153
01:14:11,565 --> 01:14:15,285
Speaker 11:  school highly recommended? Anyway, my my point

1154
01:14:15,425 --> 01:14:19,285
Speaker 11:  is one, you should watch ski school. Two, even

1155
01:14:19,345 --> 01:14:22,765
Speaker 11:  the people who think they look better in glasses that don't, don't

1156
01:14:23,985 --> 01:14:27,595
Speaker 11:  have not created enough of a market for like clear glasses. Like there's

1157
01:14:27,635 --> 01:14:31,275
Speaker 11:  a little bit of interesting for clear glasses. Yeah, right? Like on prescription

1158
01:14:31,575 --> 01:14:34,635
Speaker 11:  or non-prescription clear glasses that you just wear as a fashion accessory

1159
01:14:34,705 --> 01:14:38,685
Speaker 11:  like a little bit, but it's as a signifier as part of

1160
01:14:38,685 --> 01:14:41,605
Speaker 11:  another outfit, right? It's supposed to be part of another vibe that you're

1161
01:14:41,605 --> 01:14:45,405
Speaker 11:  sending out, right? Not just, I wear these every day, all

1162
01:14:45,405 --> 01:14:47,085
Speaker 11:  day. Like my shoes Right?

1163
01:14:47,145 --> 01:14:50,125
Speaker 2:  As pure fashion statement, right? There's not much to, and

1164
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:53,885
Speaker 11:  So when you just, I think for a tech product you need to vastly increase

1165
01:14:53,885 --> 01:14:57,805
Speaker 11:  the utility of the thing. Like AirPods, they're so useful and I care

1166
01:14:57,805 --> 01:15:00,445
Speaker 11:  about them so much and they provide me so much value every single day as

1167
01:15:00,485 --> 01:15:03,645
Speaker 11:  a product that I will overcome the fact that

1168
01:15:04,355 --> 01:15:07,085
Speaker 11:  they're in my ears all the time and people can see them 'cause they're white

1169
01:15:07,585 --> 01:15:11,245
Speaker 11:  and like regular over the ear headphones or fashion

1170
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:13,885
Speaker 11:  statements in different ways, right? They look different. There's different

1171
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:17,605
Speaker 11:  ways you can style 'em. There's different ways you can wear them that, remember

1172
01:15:17,605 --> 01:15:21,405
Speaker 11:  when Beats came out, the beats were not the best sounding headphones. Like

1173
01:15:21,615 --> 01:15:25,085
Speaker 11:  Jimmy Ivy and Dr. Dre had one idea for what headphones should sound like

1174
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:28,685
Speaker 11:  and it was super base heavy. Right? And they were a fashion

1175
01:15:28,685 --> 01:15:31,405
Speaker 11:  statement at first 'cause it came in all the colors. Like they were the

1176
01:15:31,405 --> 01:15:35,325
Speaker 11:  first headphones to like really push that idea. And they were a phenomenon

1177
01:15:35,465 --> 01:15:38,885
Speaker 11:  in their time just for that. I think with smart glasses

1178
01:15:39,345 --> 01:15:41,645
Speaker 11:  yep. You gotta make the form factor smaller. Yep. They've gotta be,

1179
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,645
Speaker 11:  yep. They've gotta look more like regular glasses. You've gotta solve the

1180
01:15:46,645 --> 01:15:50,525
Speaker 11:  battery, you've gotta bring the fids way down and the value way up.

1181
01:15:50,525 --> 01:15:54,405
Speaker 11:  They gotta be able to do more things and then somewhere in

1182
01:15:54,405 --> 01:15:58,285
Speaker 11:  there you might overcome the penalty of it being on your face. But I

1183
01:15:58,285 --> 01:16:02,045
Speaker 11:  still think that the core tenant holds, which is if it's really, really

1184
01:16:02,105 --> 01:16:05,965
Speaker 11:  useful, people get over the fids and part of FIDS is

1185
01:16:05,965 --> 01:16:07,245
Speaker 11:  like, is this shit on my face?

1186
01:16:07,655 --> 01:16:08,005
Speaker 2:  Right?

1187
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:12,165
Speaker 11:  And whether or not that you want to interpret that in the Galloway fashion

1188
01:16:12,225 --> 01:16:16,165
Speaker 11:  of does this make me more attractive That it's, it is up to you

1189
01:16:16,225 --> 01:16:20,165
Speaker 11:  to decide if that is the type of utility you desire from a a product

1190
01:16:20,595 --> 01:16:22,645
Speaker 2:  Fair. And I guess to be fair, like

1191
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:25,685
Speaker 11:  Post Malone is out here being like, you know what? Face tattoos. That sounds

1192
01:16:26,205 --> 01:16:26,405
Speaker 11:  right.

1193
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:30,165
Speaker 2:  Listen, some things are attractive to some people. Every

1194
01:16:30,585 --> 01:16:34,205
Speaker 2:  no accounting for taste. No one is attracted to Division Pro. I think is

1195
01:16:34,265 --> 01:16:37,685
Speaker 2:  is basically the only true statement I can make at this. Yeah. Particular

1196
01:16:37,685 --> 01:16:38,285
Speaker 2:  moment in time.

1197
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:43,805
Speaker 2:  I, okay, so the, the a hundred point deductible is on a scale

1198
01:16:43,805 --> 01:16:45,805
Speaker 2:  that deduction, it's, it's an Apple. It's not like a,

1199
01:16:46,035 --> 01:16:47,005
Speaker 11:  It's not like a tax return,

1200
01:16:47,615 --> 01:16:51,525
Speaker 2:  Right? I apologize. The hundred point deduction is, is like,

1201
01:16:51,525 --> 01:16:55,285
Speaker 2:  it's, it's apple chart crime, it's out of nothing. But what I wonder

1202
01:16:55,345 --> 01:16:59,165
Speaker 2:  is, is have we, have we not hit it enough? Like

1203
01:16:59,245 --> 01:17:03,205
Speaker 2:  should it be a 200 point deduction? Like I am starting to think that this

1204
01:17:03,205 --> 01:17:06,845
Speaker 2:  thing might be harder to surmount even than I had thought.

1205
01:17:07,285 --> 01:17:10,485
Speaker 2:  'cause even like I look at the Orion glasses, which are smaller and much

1206
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:13,325
Speaker 2:  closer to being normal glasses and then somebody puts 'em on their face and

1207
01:17:13,325 --> 01:17:16,245
Speaker 2:  they still look kind of stupid. Like they're cool 'cause they're cool technology,

1208
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:20,245
Speaker 2:  whatever, but like in no way are they like cool looking glasses.

1209
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:24,445
Speaker 2:  And that is like the bleeding edge of the bleeding edge of where we are in

1210
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:28,285
Speaker 2:  terms of being able to make these things awesome. Like should we be,

1211
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:32,205
Speaker 2:  should we be dinging these things harder for their face wearing

1212
01:17:32,705 --> 01:17:34,525
Speaker 2:  issues for the foreseeable future?

1213
01:17:35,075 --> 01:17:38,485
Speaker 11:  Well, I would say one of the most fiddly things about the Orion is that

1214
01:17:38,485 --> 01:17:41,605
Speaker 11:  you need to work at Facebook and apparently have $10,000 in order to have

1215
01:17:41,605 --> 01:17:45,525
Speaker 11:  one. Yeah. Ums pretty fiddly. It's very fiddly. Like whether or not it's

1216
01:17:45,525 --> 01:17:49,005
Speaker 11:  in your face, like doesn't matter. Like it, it's, it's a product you can't

1217
01:17:49,005 --> 01:17:52,925
Speaker 11:  buy. You need to grow crystal lenses in the basement of your underground

1218
01:17:53,245 --> 01:17:57,085
Speaker 11:  Hawaiian layer apparently to have them very fiddly. Like you're just in

1219
01:17:57,085 --> 01:17:59,845
Speaker 11:  the hole and then you're a little bit further in the hole. I think a better

1220
01:17:59,845 --> 01:18:03,525
Speaker 11:  example is the RayBan glasses that Meadow is doing where their

1221
01:18:03,525 --> 01:18:07,505
Speaker 11:  utility is not that high. Right? Like they

1222
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:11,385
Speaker 11:  can take some photos, they can do some AI stuff. People actually like the

1223
01:18:11,385 --> 01:18:14,905
Speaker 11:  photos. People like listening to music on them, but they're not very

1224
01:18:15,045 --> 01:18:15,465
Speaker 11:  fiddly.

1225
01:18:16,485 --> 01:18:16,935
Speaker 2:  That is

1226
01:18:16,935 --> 01:18:19,495
Speaker 11:  True. They're just, they're just ray bands that have to, they're

1227
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:20,455
Speaker 2:  Mostly glasses. Yeah.

1228
01:18:20,455 --> 01:18:23,535
Speaker 11:  And so even they can overcome the face penalty

1229
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:28,045
Speaker 11:  because their fids is so low. Right. And then, and then

1230
01:18:28,045 --> 01:18:30,645
Speaker 11:  you get whatever utility you get out of it and they, they kind of just curve

1231
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:34,335
Speaker 11:  right back up to glasses maybe a little bit under regular glasses

1232
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:38,175
Speaker 11:  because they have a little more fids to them. But

1233
01:18:38,175 --> 01:18:40,895
Speaker 11:  they, they're, I think they're just on the same curve as regular glasses,

1234
01:18:40,945 --> 01:18:44,615
Speaker 11:  which also take the a hundred point face fids de deduction. Right.

1235
01:18:45,035 --> 01:18:48,815
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna be so interested to see how the clear ones end up doing in the

1236
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:51,215
Speaker 2:  real world that like limited edition one that they came out with because

1237
01:18:51,755 --> 01:18:55,695
Speaker 2:  my like threads algorithm is filled with people who are obsessed with

1238
01:18:55,695 --> 01:18:58,375
Speaker 2:  it. My threads algorithm is also filled with like nerds. And so, and

1239
01:18:58,375 --> 01:19:00,095
Speaker 11:  That's also owned I would point out by meta.

1240
01:19:00,475 --> 01:19:04,095
Speaker 2:  It is also one by meta. That's a very good point. So I think the, the question

1241
01:19:04,095 --> 01:19:07,255
Speaker 2:  of like, I, I have a pair here that are essentially

1242
01:19:07,555 --> 01:19:11,535
Speaker 2:  indistinguishable from normal Wayfairs. Like you would never look at me twice

1243
01:19:11,535 --> 01:19:14,855
Speaker 2:  wearing them. They just look like Wayfairs. That is a huge victory. I think

1244
01:19:14,855 --> 01:19:18,615
Speaker 2:  the, the clear ones look a little more like gadgets and So I think

1245
01:19:19,035 --> 01:19:22,775
Speaker 2:  how those sort of percolate out into the world is gonna be really

1246
01:19:23,015 --> 01:19:25,895
Speaker 2:  interesting because there is this like all the way at the other end of that

1247
01:19:26,015 --> 01:19:29,615
Speaker 2:  spectrum is Google glass, which is like the gadgets gadget of all time.

1248
01:19:29,615 --> 01:19:33,015
Speaker 11:  And it also offered almost no utility. Right? I just, everyone forgets this

1249
01:19:33,015 --> 01:19:36,855
Speaker 11:  about Google Glass. You had a little display in your face that was not very

1250
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:37,575
Speaker 11:  useful at all.

1251
01:19:37,835 --> 01:19:40,495
Speaker 2:  No, it like told you you had a text message. Yeah. And I'm like, my phone

1252
01:19:40,555 --> 01:19:41,855
Speaker 2:  buzzes when that happens this far.

1253
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:44,015
Speaker 11:  You were just in the hole. It was like, and it would be like turn left.

1254
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:47,135
Speaker 11:  It's like when you were doing Google apps. Yeah. And it's just, none of

1255
01:19:47,135 --> 01:19:51,095
Speaker 11:  this is useful at all. So I, the, the, the real thing

1256
01:19:51,095 --> 01:19:54,935
Speaker 11:  that I think that the Raybans have accomplished is they've

1257
01:19:54,935 --> 01:19:58,135
Speaker 11:  gotten closer to the curve is of regular glasses.

1258
01:19:59,035 --> 01:20:02,295
Speaker 11:  What's really interesting is the clear ones you're talking about have the

1259
01:20:02,295 --> 01:20:05,895
Speaker 11:  next generation of transitions lenses in them, gen S they're called,

1260
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:09,765
Speaker 11:  which are supposed to go from sunglasses to clear much faster than

1261
01:20:09,765 --> 01:20:13,605
Speaker 11:  before. And the idea is that that will make you wanna wear them all the

1262
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:13,725
Speaker 11:  time.

1263
01:20:15,465 --> 01:20:19,185
Speaker 11:  I don't know, you know like, are people gonna buy these way

1264
01:20:19,185 --> 01:20:21,265
Speaker 11:  things that look like Wayfairs and then just like wear 'em around their

1265
01:20:21,265 --> 01:20:24,985
Speaker 11:  office because they're getting so much value out of wearing the meta

1266
01:20:25,085 --> 01:20:27,905
Speaker 11:  ray bands. And I think the answer is no. I think you're still on the same

1267
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:31,865
Speaker 11:  curve as just regular sunglasses. So we'll see. I think that's the most

1268
01:20:32,435 --> 01:20:36,265
Speaker 11:  successful of these products because they've gotten to the

1269
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:39,665
Speaker 11:  same sort of value equation as a regular set of sunglasses.

1270
01:20:40,755 --> 01:20:43,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think that's right. And that's, that's a good example of, I don't

1271
01:20:44,045 --> 01:20:48,005
Speaker 2:  know that like your sunglasses generally make you look like cooler

1272
01:20:48,065 --> 01:20:51,845
Speaker 2:  and more attractive, but they are like useful and they look good.

1273
01:20:52,245 --> 01:20:55,245
Speaker 11:  I think historically in, in the history of culture, people have thought

1274
01:20:55,245 --> 01:20:56,765
Speaker 11:  sunglasses make them look cool and attractive.

1275
01:20:57,225 --> 01:21:00,085
Speaker 2:  No, they just like make you mysterious 'cause nobody can see what you're

1276
01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:01,445
Speaker 2:  looking at and that Yeah.

1277
01:21:01,835 --> 01:21:03,005
Speaker 11:  Sexy and dangerous.

1278
01:21:04,105 --> 01:21:05,085
Speaker 2:  How do you feel about your sunglasses?

1279
01:21:06,505 --> 01:21:09,565
Speaker 11:  I'm just saying I think this is how most people feel about sunglasses.

1280
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:14,005
Speaker 2:  That's no, that's fair. So maybe, maybe we're onto something here that there's

1281
01:21:14,005 --> 01:21:17,165
Speaker 2:  maybe the new, the the, the whatever seventh

1282
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:20,885
Speaker 2:  dimension of the, the theory of wearable bullshit.

1283
01:21:21,325 --> 01:21:24,605
Speaker 11:  I think I'm down to just two. It's two in the face deduction,

1284
01:21:25,525 --> 01:21:27,985
Speaker 2:  But there's also like a sexiness quotient.

1285
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:32,465
Speaker 11:  No, I disagree. Two all too subjective. It's fids versus

1286
01:21:32,495 --> 01:21:34,345
Speaker 11:  utility and then face.

1287
01:21:34,685 --> 01:21:38,545
Speaker 2:  So do we put sexiness under utility? Is one of the utility like

1288
01:21:38,745 --> 01:21:41,825
Speaker 2:  a possible utility? Just it makes me look hot as a hell per

1289
01:21:41,825 --> 01:21:44,985
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Perceived utility. It's all, it's all in there. Which is why face

1290
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:48,465
Speaker 11:  is such a wait is face, a fiddly face is utility

1291
01:21:48,465 --> 01:21:49,065
Speaker 11:  deduction.

1292
01:21:49,495 --> 01:21:50,465
Speaker 2:  Okay. I think that's right.

1293
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:52,615
Speaker 11:  That

1294
01:21:52,615 --> 01:21:54,815
Speaker 2:  Seems, no, it's a fiddly deduction face is very fiddly.

1295
01:21:55,115 --> 01:21:55,935
Speaker 11:  I'm never gonna get this right.

1296
01:21:57,715 --> 01:22:01,535
Speaker 11:  It just depends on which axis is which. Whichever one brings you down

1297
01:22:01,585 --> 01:22:05,375
Speaker 11:  below that curve like hard and then you've gotta like, you've gotta

1298
01:22:05,435 --> 01:22:09,295
Speaker 11:  pay it off with utility. So it is a, it is a utility deduction.

1299
01:22:09,765 --> 01:22:10,055
Speaker 2:  Okay.

1300
01:22:10,545 --> 01:22:13,575
Speaker 11:  Right. You put it on your face, you suddenly need to deliver vastly more

1301
01:22:13,575 --> 01:22:15,175
Speaker 11:  utility to get back above the curve. Right.

1302
01:22:15,195 --> 01:22:18,815
Speaker 2:  And one of those utilities can be sexy looking

1303
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:19,495
Speaker 11:  Hot. Yeah.

1304
01:22:19,955 --> 01:22:23,535
Speaker 2:  All right. There we go. We've solved it. And as always If, you

1305
01:22:23,925 --> 01:22:27,775
Speaker 2:  listeners can figure out how to graph this for us. Please,

1306
01:22:27,775 --> 01:22:30,295
Speaker 2:  dear God, we'll let you sponsor the lightning round for free.

1307
01:22:30,915 --> 01:22:31,135
Speaker 11:  You

1308
01:22:31,135 --> 01:22:31,775
Speaker 2:  Can figure out how to

1309
01:22:31,775 --> 01:22:35,215
Speaker 11:  Do this. We've mentioned it before. So there's regular glasses. This is

1310
01:22:35,215 --> 01:22:39,015
Speaker 11:  the, the first thing to put on your chart is regular glasses, which

1311
01:22:39,035 --> 01:22:42,615
Speaker 11:  are quite fiddly, especially If. you need them to see

1312
01:22:43,315 --> 01:22:47,095
Speaker 11:  the fact that If you lose them you can no longer see is really quite fiddly.

1313
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:50,535
Speaker 11:  Yes. Agreed. Like you gotta keep them clean. You can't lose 'em, you don't

1314
01:22:50,535 --> 01:22:54,095
Speaker 11:  want to scratch 'em. You gotta, you gotta wear 'em all the time. Very fiddly

1315
01:22:54,445 --> 01:22:58,255
Speaker 11:  utility off the chart. You're, you're, you're way above the curve

1316
01:22:58,435 --> 01:23:01,455
Speaker 11:  of success on this, on this whatever quadrant chart we're doing.

1317
01:23:02,885 --> 01:23:05,685
Speaker 11:  AirPods also in the chart. Good, good thing to graph right? People like

1318
01:23:05,805 --> 01:23:09,005
Speaker 11:  'em, but they make you look like you have AirPods in your ears. Apple watch

1319
01:23:09,365 --> 01:23:12,325
Speaker 11:  first gen versus the current gen, first gen. Ooh, that's a good one. So

1320
01:23:12,325 --> 01:23:16,205
Speaker 11:  fiddly. Yep. Not a lot of utility. So fiddly below

1321
01:23:16,205 --> 01:23:20,045
Speaker 11:  the curve and they, they, they evened it out to where they are now. So

1322
01:23:20,045 --> 01:23:22,565
Speaker 11:  like that's the chart, right? You just gotta, if you're gonna put something

1323
01:23:22,565 --> 01:23:25,805
Speaker 11:  on your body, it's gotta be so useful. It's worth the time and attention.

1324
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:30,415
Speaker 11:  And then you've got face, face deduction,

1325
01:23:32,965 --> 01:23:34,735
Speaker 2:  Face deductions, the, the title of Neli,

1326
01:23:35,195 --> 01:23:35,695
Speaker 11:  The face penalty.

1327
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:39,855
Speaker 2:  All right, we did it Neli. Thank you as always.

1328
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:43,575
Speaker 11:  I'm still mad about the Scott Galloway thing. I wanna be very clear with

1329
01:23:43,575 --> 01:23:43,815
Speaker 11:  this.

1330
01:23:45,235 --> 01:23:48,015
Speaker 2:  All right, that is it for the Vergecast. Thank you to everybody who was on

1331
01:23:48,015 --> 01:23:50,615
Speaker 2:  the show today, and thank you as always for listening. There's lots more

1332
01:23:50,615 --> 01:23:54,255
Speaker 2:  on everything. We talked about all of Jen's coverage of matter and thread

1333
01:23:54,555 --> 01:23:58,535
Speaker 2:  and the video doorbells. She actually wrote about a smart door just yesterday.

1334
01:23:58,625 --> 01:24:02,535
Speaker 2:  Great stuff. All that is on the website. All of Chris's reviews of

1335
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:05,855
Speaker 2:  these various headphones are on the website. I think the, the

1336
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:09,815
Speaker 2:  wearable theory is mostly a vergecast thing. So, you know,

1337
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:14,175
Speaker 2:  keep it locked here for all of the updates on

1338
01:24:14,465 --> 01:24:18,455
Speaker 2:  Eli's insane wearables theory that basically doesn't make any sense. And

1339
01:24:18,455 --> 01:24:22,415
Speaker 2:  If you have thoughts, questions or feelings or anything else you wanna talk

1340
01:24:22,415 --> 01:24:25,255
Speaker 2:  about. Other headphones you want us to try other ways to put terrible audio

1341
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:28,735
Speaker 2:  on The Vergecast. You can always email us at vergecast at The Verge dot com
