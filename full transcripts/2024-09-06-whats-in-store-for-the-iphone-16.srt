2
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:46,275
Speaker 3:  society. There are no members,

3
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:49,915
Speaker 4:  The wrongest one we've ever done. I was like, I don't

4
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:51,355
Speaker 5:  Wanna be a member of that. I don't want that

5
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:54,275
Speaker 3:  Flagship. We're still looking for our first member If. you could sign up

6
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:58,275
Speaker 3:  today. That would be much appreciated, but we are not

7
00:01:58,275 --> 00:01:58,555
Speaker 3:  in it.

8
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:03,795
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you have to join. We just cover the society. We are not members of

9
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:04,235
Speaker 4:  the Society.

10
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,475
Speaker 3:  We're the official podcast of the fine Woven Appreciation Society, but we,

11
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:12,195
Speaker 3:  we've never joined. Hi, I'm friend Eli David. Pierce is here. Hello.

12
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,715
Speaker 3:  Alex Kranz is here. Hey, what's up? This is a big one. This is the Apple

13
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:19,635
Speaker 3:  iPhone preview episode. Next week is the event. A

14
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:22,475
Speaker 3:  bunch of us will be there. David noted out.

15
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:24,475
Speaker 4:  That's largely correct.

16
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:28,475
Speaker 3:  David was like, screw it. I've seen these phones before. The rectangles,

17
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,475
Speaker 3:  he said angrily.

18
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:33,635
Speaker 3:  But there's a lot of talk about we're expecting a new iPhone, a new watch,

19
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:36,155
Speaker 3:  AirPods. We're gonna talk about all the rumors, all the things we're expecting.

20
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:39,115
Speaker 3:  It's also IFA in Germany.

21
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:43,795
Speaker 3:  They've covered this thing for 15 years. I'm like, it's Germany, right? We

22
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:47,275
Speaker 3:  got a team out there looking at just a wild collection of gadgets, including,

23
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:50,755
Speaker 3:  I just saw this, a laptop whose lid rotates by itself.

24
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,795
Speaker 4:  Whoa. Like, like rainbow room style. It just sort of slowly spins around

25
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:56,075
Speaker 4:  as

26
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,275
Speaker 3:  You use it. No, it's like a classic 2 1 1 where you like open it, You can

27
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:01,245
Speaker 3:  like flip it around and turn it into a tablet, but they're like, what if

28
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:02,285
Speaker 3:  that, but you didn't have to do it.

29
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:04,045
Speaker 4:  Oh, I like that.

30
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:05,085
Speaker 6:  And it goes,

31
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:10,565
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it, it doesn't, none of it seems reliable or good, but

32
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,245
Speaker 3:  that's right. That's what's happening in Germany today. So we, we had a whole

33
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:17,605
Speaker 3:  lightning round of gadgets and then we got another lightning round unsponsored.

34
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:21,845
Speaker 3:  Although I will say to the one person who sent us email saying, I

35
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:25,885
Speaker 3:  now have an entire corporate marketing budget. We're gonna spend your corporate

36
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:28,805
Speaker 3:  marketing budget. Yeah. This is what happens when you do a, a show for effectively

37
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,005
Speaker 3:  15 years. The people get jobs.

38
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:38,965
Speaker 3:  So there's there, there's some people who sent some emails. We're,

39
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:41,645
Speaker 3:  we're excited about this. Alright, we gotta talk about Apple. Let's start.

40
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:44,565
Speaker 3:  There's, there's a lot of rumors I would say,

41
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,965
Speaker 3:  but we're at the, the top line is they're iterating all of their core products.

42
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:53,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's a, it's a weird moment. So you said that there's a lot of rumors

43
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:57,045
Speaker 4:  and my, my immediate reaction was like kind of,

44
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,045
Speaker 4:  because it, it's a weird year in the sense that if there is something

45
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:04,885
Speaker 4:  big coming, we don't know anything about it. Like there's not even,

46
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:08,725
Speaker 4:  there's not even light rumors that there might be something big and

47
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:11,925
Speaker 4:  every year there's like the, maybe this'll be, and there's just none of that.

48
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,285
Speaker 4:  So either this is gonna be a pretty straightforward Apple event

49
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:19,685
Speaker 4:  or we actually don't have that much information and I, so obviously I

50
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,485
Speaker 4:  hope it's the second thing.

51
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:24,325
Speaker 6:  It's kind of rude though because like action button on all models, that feels

52
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:25,445
Speaker 6:  like a big deal. No

53
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:26,285
Speaker 4:  It doesn't. That's it.

54
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,285
Speaker 6:  I don't have an action button on it. So it does,

55
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:32,605
Speaker 3:  It's huge for me. What I meant by a lot of rumors, I didn't mean

56
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:36,565
Speaker 3:  a lot of important rumors. I just meant the volume of rumors

57
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:40,365
Speaker 3:  is high. Yes. The number of things that people are saying will happen

58
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,325
Speaker 3:  is larger than normal in my opinion.

59
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:44,365
Speaker 4:  I think that's right.

60
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:47,525
Speaker 3:  But none of them add up to like earth shattering.

61
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,505
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Except for the action button, which If you are on an iPhone

62
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:55,545
Speaker 6:  14 pro like I am is very exciting of

63
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,545
Speaker 3:  All of the rumored buttons. You think it's that one?

64
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:01,425
Speaker 4:  Okay. Wait, can we actually talk about this for a second? Yeah. So I, I posted

65
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:05,345
Speaker 4:  on the site the other day a really great shortcut that someone uses,

66
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:09,145
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry, I'm forgetting who it was, where they had set it up so that

67
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,585
Speaker 4:  like, they figured out quicker than I did. That You can use the action button

68
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,305
Speaker 4:  to open the camera and then again to take a picture. So You can use it like

69
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:19,465
Speaker 4:  as a basically press and hold and then press and you have immediately taken

70
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:22,905
Speaker 4:  a picture. I think that's awesome. I So I posted this on the site being like,

71
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,585
Speaker 4:  this is a really cool use of the action button. Do you use the action button?

72
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:30,265
Speaker 4:  And the overwhelming response I got from people is I never ever, ever, ever

73
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:33,705
Speaker 4:  use the action button because I, that it existed. I don't care about it at

74
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:37,665
Speaker 4:  all. So Neli, you I know. Set it up to do a

75
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:40,705
Speaker 4:  chat GPT thing. Do you actually like use the action button all the time?

76
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,585
Speaker 3:  It's, it has reached gimmick status.

77
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:45,825
Speaker 4:  Okay. So

78
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:48,705
Speaker 3:  We should just contextualize this. What I say of all of the rumor buttons,

79
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:52,145
Speaker 3:  they're rumored to be adding a camera button, a dedicated camera button

80
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:56,305
Speaker 3:  to the pro, and then bring the action button to all the models. So we'll

81
00:05:56,305 --> 00:06:00,045
Speaker 3:  get to that. My use of action right now is, it's linked to the chat GBT

82
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:04,245
Speaker 3:  shortcut where you press it and it's slow. I I,

83
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:07,845
Speaker 3:  there's nothing about this. It's fast. You press it, chat GBT launches, it

84
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,885
Speaker 3:  flashes up some message. It's like checking connection and then a wheel spins

85
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:13,765
Speaker 3:  and you're, it's already gone. You've already been like, I don't care about

86
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:17,285
Speaker 3:  the question I was gonna ask anymore. And then You can ask it a question

87
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:20,805
Speaker 3:  and it can listen to you. That's a little dicey as well. If you're in a loud

88
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:23,885
Speaker 3:  environment or people are talking, it's not great at that. But the thing

89
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:27,405
Speaker 3:  at the end of all that, you ask it a question, natural language, and then

90
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:30,605
Speaker 3:  it just tells you an answer in natural language. And sometimes that answer

91
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,925
Speaker 3:  is a pure hallucination and sometimes it's not. And You can close that window

92
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,045
Speaker 3:  and just read it, which is much faster than listening to the voice. And all

93
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:39,805
Speaker 3:  of that feels like a little glimpse into the future. I'll give you an example.

94
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:44,645
Speaker 3:  Max and I are playing Untitled Goose game together, which is amazing. Extraordinarily

95
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:48,125
Speaker 3:  fun. If, you don't know this game. It came out years ago. You're, you're

96
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:52,085
Speaker 3:  just a a, you know, a Ms. Grant Goose just getting

97
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:55,645
Speaker 3:  into trouble, just honking at stuff. It's enormously

98
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,805
Speaker 3:  fun. It's like Grand Theft Auto, but you're a goose. I don't know how else

99
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:00,005
Speaker 3:  to describe it. That's perfect.

100
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:03,685
Speaker 4:  That belongs in that category of games that there is no way to say it in

101
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:06,645
Speaker 4:  words. That sounds good. Yeah. But yet it is amazing. But

102
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,965
Speaker 3:  If, you have a, like a 6-year-old, you're like, this is a great video game.

103
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:12,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like one you usually like run around honking at stuff. Yeah, it's great

104
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:15,805
Speaker 3:  rules. So we're having fun and I, we couldn't figure out some puzzle and

105
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:19,685
Speaker 3:  I just asked Chad g bt like, where is this thing in this game? and it

106
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:23,645
Speaker 3:  just told me the answer with like bullets. That's cool. And there's a whole

107
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:27,845
Speaker 3:  universe of moral complaints you could lodge at opening Eye for scraping

108
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:31,645
Speaker 3:  all of the work and all of the labor of a million video game journalists

109
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,845
Speaker 3:  who publish the explainers and it's all in the background, but the thing

110
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:37,685
Speaker 3:  just worked. And so that is really something. There's something there and

111
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:41,205
Speaker 3:  I, I hope all the people get paid for all their work in whatever way.

112
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:45,125
Speaker 3:  But that one use of the action button to me is the most important use of

113
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,605
Speaker 3:  the action button. Like can you have a natural

114
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:52,645
Speaker 3:  language voice assistant? Can you actually add a new kind of

115
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:56,845
Speaker 3:  input mechanism to a computer? Yeah. If, and, and that

116
00:07:56,845 --> 00:08:00,765
Speaker 3:  one's really janky and weird, but You can very, very clearly see how oh

117
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,365
Speaker 3:  You can make that a million times better. And I think we're, we're expecting

118
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,965
Speaker 3:  to see Apple add these features to Siri. I don't know if it'll be on this

119
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:09,085
Speaker 3:  phone or at this event, but You can just see how it's gonna get there.

120
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:12,205
Speaker 6:  So. I. I think the reason I'm excited about it's 'cause of the books Palmer,

121
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:16,125
Speaker 6:  it also has a button like this You can program and because I have one

122
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:17,645
Speaker 6:  I've actually used it. We, God

123
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:18,805
Speaker 3:  Did we catch the books? Palm

124
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,885
Speaker 6:  So I. I'm So. I'm speed running. I'm speed running today.

125
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:23,125
Speaker 3:  Seven minutes since we started the show. Alright,

126
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:27,045
Speaker 6:  We haven't gotten into the remarkable yet. Don't worry. I'm ready. But

127
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:31,285
Speaker 6:  with, with the action button, can you do like just go to home or go to

128
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:32,765
Speaker 6:  use it as a back button?

129
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:37,885
Speaker 3:  No. So, I I, I You can set it to run shortcuts and then You can shut it,

130
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,565
Speaker 3:  set it to run like what, five or six different system level things like turn

131
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:44,405
Speaker 3:  on the flashlight. Yeah. I don't think it has os level navigational

132
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:44,965
Speaker 3:  capabilities.

133
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,285
Speaker 6:  Nevermind. I'm less excited this but

134
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:51,005
Speaker 3:  Sucks. I think maybe with some of the assistive features in

135
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,965
Speaker 3:  iOS you might be able to do some of this stuff but it's not like top level

136
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:55,325
Speaker 3:  functionality. Yeah,

137
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:59,165
Speaker 4:  You could probably rig up a shortcut to go home's, but that's a deeply weird

138
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:03,285
Speaker 4:  use case. Yes. But I think, yeah like back as a system gesture.

139
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,525
Speaker 4:  I'm not sure you could do. Maybe you could but again that would be a like

140
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,485
Speaker 4:  weird shortcut hack that's not just sort of a thing that You can, You can

141
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:09,605
Speaker 4:  attach

142
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:13,445
Speaker 3:  To or it's buried in some, some set of assistant technology. Yeah.

143
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:13,605
Speaker 4:  That's

144
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,765
Speaker 3:  Specific technology configurations And a lot of times what Apple does, which

145
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:21,525
Speaker 3:  I think is really interesting and and honestly really cool, they pioneer

146
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:25,605
Speaker 3:  or they test new ways of using the products

147
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,485
Speaker 3:  as assistive technologies first and then they bring them to everyone. 'cause

148
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,165
Speaker 3:  you know the, the thing to say about assistive technology is, is making things

149
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:37,045
Speaker 3:  more accessible is actually better for everybody. So the things like

150
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:39,805
Speaker 3:  pinchy pinch on the watch started out as an assistive technology.

151
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:44,045
Speaker 3:  There's a bunch of other stuff across iOS that start off as assistive technology

152
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:45,965
Speaker 3:  and there's like a lot of them. Yeah like

153
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:47,845
Speaker 6:  The mouse on the iPad started

154
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:50,765
Speaker 3:  Great. The mouse definitely. That's a great

155
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,045
Speaker 4:  One. The double tap on the back to do stuff is also another one that started

156
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:55,645
Speaker 4:  as an assisted thing. There's a lot of it that starts.

157
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:58,885
Speaker 3:  Yeah, there's a lot for, so it's like there's, that system is so configural

158
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:02,525
Speaker 3:  I'm not a, I'm just saying I'm not a hundred percent sure but if it was gonna

159
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,405
Speaker 3:  be somewhere it would be in there. I think Yeah

160
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:05,045
Speaker 4:  That makes

161
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:08,325
Speaker 3:  Sense. But it's, they've limited what You can do with the action button into

162
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:11,845
Speaker 3:  the system level. So just a handful of things. And then You can run shortcuts

163
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:16,125
Speaker 3:  so when I push it, it runs the chat GPT shortcut. Right.

164
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,805
Speaker 3:  Which is fine but it's not like I push it and the computer

165
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,605
Speaker 3:  knows what I want as it's like I'm gonna run the shortcut that opens this

166
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:22,925
Speaker 3:  other thing.

167
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,925
Speaker 4:  This is where I say again that shortcuts is a failed experiment and

168
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:30,205
Speaker 4:  Apple should be ashamed of itself for not doing better with shortcuts. Yes.

169
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:33,965
Speaker 4:  'cause what you just said is either You can do one of four things or you

170
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:37,685
Speaker 4:  have to have a master's degree in computer engineering to be able to do anything

171
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,405
Speaker 4:  else with your phone. Well

172
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,685
Speaker 3:  What's supposed to happen, well to be clear, what's supposed to happen is

173
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:45,725
Speaker 3:  the, the app developer ship the shortcuts, right? So the the My chat GB shortcut

174
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:49,405
Speaker 3:  is from OpenAI, right? They're like here it is, we've added it to your system

175
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:51,965
Speaker 3:  library shortcuts. And what they want you to do is map it to the action button.

176
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:55,965
Speaker 3:  So like they're using the the pathway to get to

177
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:59,485
Speaker 3:  that button that Apple provides. But you still have to know a bunch of things

178
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:04,125
Speaker 3:  about shortcuts and it OpenAI built the shortcut and it is there and You

179
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:08,045
Speaker 3:  can, instead of being like I'm looking at the list of things it

180
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:10,285
Speaker 3:  can do and one of them is open chat GPT.

181
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:14,005
Speaker 4:  Right? Right. Exactly. Like there's a, one of the things that You can do

182
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:17,285
Speaker 4:  on the Mac that I think is the better version of this is basically just

183
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,365
Speaker 4:  walk it through a menu set. Like You can set up a keyboard shortcut to anything,

184
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:25,965
Speaker 4:  any menu in any app on a Mac just by saying I want it to be

185
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:29,925
Speaker 4:  this command. I'm like that's how shortcuts should work and it just doesn't.

186
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:32,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's kind of like that. Just way more complicated. So

187
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:34,645
Speaker 3:  I'm looking at the actual list of the action button by the way it's You can

188
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:37,245
Speaker 3:  turn on silent and ring, which is the classic Mute switch. Mute

189
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:38,245
Speaker 4:  Button. Yeah. Boring

190
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:42,245
Speaker 3:  You can switch a focus mode, which is one of those features that other

191
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:45,085
Speaker 3:  people are super into or do not care about.

192
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:49,045
Speaker 3:  Classic. And by the way, focus months have been this way since like Paulo

193
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:52,165
Speaker 3:  List devices 'cause that's where they came from. So.

194
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:56,165
Speaker 4:  I have mine set up to turn Do not disturb on and off. And actually that was

195
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:59,925
Speaker 4:  great. Basically just as like a shut my phone up thing I like I

196
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:03,485
Speaker 4:  changed nothing in Do not Disturb except I turn all the notifications and

197
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:03,885
Speaker 4:  sounds off.

198
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:07,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So you You can and the idea that you're gonna push a hard button on

199
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:11,005
Speaker 3:  your phone to switch focus modes is like very fascinating to me. But sure

200
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,085
Speaker 3:  You can watch the camera which is, I think this is the reason everybody sets

201
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:18,045
Speaker 3:  it to camera 'cause of the default choices, it's the thing that makes the

202
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:21,005
Speaker 3:  most sense for the most people. For sure. You can have it turn on the flashlight,

203
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:24,405
Speaker 3:  which is just like if you're If, you wanna seem like an old dad.

204
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:28,445
Speaker 3:  Set that button to flashlight. You can launch voice memo, which is cool.

205
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,885
Speaker 3:  You can run the translator. There's a magnifier which was fun to play with

206
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,885
Speaker 3:  for a day. And then it turned out You can do a shortcut and then You can

207
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:37,605
Speaker 3:  add the other accessibility features or You can set us no action. So just

208
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:41,045
Speaker 3:  of these choices, I think it makes sense why

209
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,245
Speaker 3:  camera is by far the most important one. Yeah. and it also why

210
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:48,965
Speaker 3:  it makes sense that am Apple is rumored to be adding a dedicated camera button

211
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:50,845
Speaker 3:  to the pro phone. But the,

212
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:54,925
Speaker 4:  So this is the reason I ask though is because I think we're at a

213
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:59,205
Speaker 4:  such a deep point of maturity with these devices that again this is

214
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:01,805
Speaker 4:  purely anecdotal just based on my own experience of talking to other people.

215
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:05,045
Speaker 4:  But I don't think the attach rate of the action button is that high.

216
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,285
Speaker 4:  And I think in part because it's the button that is too high on the phone.

217
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:11,965
Speaker 4:  Like I will die on that hill. They put the button in the wrong place. Yeah.

218
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:16,325
Speaker 4:  But partly it's just because we all know how to do all those things on our

219
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:20,165
Speaker 4:  phones already. Right. And if I launch the camera a hundred times

220
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:20,605
Speaker 4:  a day,

221
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:26,485
Speaker 4:  Learning a new pathway to get there is actually more work than

222
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:29,445
Speaker 4:  it's cracked up to be. And I think one of the things that Apple is doing

223
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:33,485
Speaker 4:  this year with its software is making all those bits and pieces more

224
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,405
Speaker 4:  customizable. So You can do more stuff in the control center and You can

225
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:39,205
Speaker 4:  do more stuff on the lock screen and You can change the two things at the

226
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:43,045
Speaker 4:  bottom that were flashlight and camera. Now those are customizable and Apple

227
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:46,125
Speaker 4:  has this idea that like, okay, we're gonna give more people more tools to

228
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,045
Speaker 4:  do stuff however they want. And I wonder how big the group of

229
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:52,325
Speaker 4:  people who are going to make those changes and be thrilled about them is

230
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:55,685
Speaker 4:  versus the number of people who are just like, you know what, we're

231
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,025
Speaker 4:  17 years into the iPhone, I kind of know how to do things. None

232
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:02,905
Speaker 4:  of this actually matters. And I think the camera button is gonna be the most

233
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:06,345
Speaker 4:  interesting version of that because if the rumors are true, it's not just

234
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,225
Speaker 4:  gonna be a shutter button, it's actually gonna be like pressure sensitive.

235
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:12,705
Speaker 4:  So you'll be able to like press once to press half press to focus and then

236
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:15,505
Speaker 4:  press to take the photo, which is like a genuine

237
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:20,425
Speaker 4:  value add on top of anything You can do on the phone. Now it's just janky

238
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:20,745
Speaker 4:  to

239
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,065
Speaker 3:  Do it. They also, there's a rumor that it'll be touch sensitive for Zoom.

240
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:24,385
Speaker 3:  So You can slide your finger back. Oh

241
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:25,385
Speaker 4:  I didn't see that. That's

242
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:26,785
Speaker 6:  Cool. Wait, they're gonna put

243
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:28,545
Speaker 4:  In If. you can slide on it to Zoom. Yeah

244
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:31,225
Speaker 3:  That is the rumor. Like I said, there's a lot of rumors I

245
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,425
Speaker 6:  Wait but Apple's gonna put in like a fancy button

246
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:39,425
Speaker 6:  but no headphone jack. Like they, they found the room

247
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,145
Speaker 6:  for the button. Did that just to hurt me Alex? I did. I did.

248
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean at this point the If, you

249
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:51,605
Speaker 3:  believe that the future of this, the technology industry is multimodal

250
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:55,565
Speaker 3:  AI then having immediate access to a camera so the phone

251
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:58,965
Speaker 3:  can look at things. If, you believe the future of the industry is ar having

252
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,885
Speaker 3:  immediate access to the phone, You can see why you're like, okay, I need,

253
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:05,365
Speaker 3:  I need to make this a button. Yeah. What's harder to understand is why the

254
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:09,285
Speaker 3:  action button persists if the adoption rate is so low. Yeah. and it, it's

255
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,045
Speaker 3:  like funny to me that one of those options isn't just open an app.

256
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:17,085
Speaker 3:  Right. If I had a button on my phone that just open threes, I'd be this button

257
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:17,365
Speaker 3:  rules.

258
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:20,565
Speaker 4:  Well and You can do that with shortcuts. Right. But this is, this is where

259
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:22,285
Speaker 4:  I go back to like shortcuts as a experiment.

260
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:25,605
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You have to dive through this other system as opposed to, I don't know,

261
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:29,565
Speaker 3:  like I think a lot of people tend to use like one app a lot.

262
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:33,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And the idea that this, you can't just like make this button open that

263
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:36,645
Speaker 3:  app from the jump from your lock screen is kinda weird. And I, I think it's

264
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,365
Speaker 3:  Apple is just sort of restricting that a little

265
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:43,725
Speaker 3:  too much. And so I'm hopeful that what we see is the action button gets more

266
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:47,565
Speaker 3:  useful in one way and they move all the camera usage

267
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:49,085
Speaker 3:  to the other button. Mm.

268
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Because otherwise it's the touch bar again, isn't it?

269
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:55,565
Speaker 3:  Otherwise you're gonna have two camera buttons on your phone. Like I Yeah,

270
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:58,205
Speaker 3:  there's just gonna be a lot of people with pro phones who have effectively

271
00:15:58,205 --> 00:15:59,285
Speaker 3:  two camera buttons on their phone.

272
00:15:59,415 --> 00:15:59,765
Speaker 4:  Right.

273
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:03,855
Speaker 6:  They're like, this one's when I'm feeling spicy. This one when I'm feeling

274
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:04,535
Speaker 6:  not spicy.

275
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,335
Speaker 4:  This is the Nudies button and the non nudies button. Wow guys.

276
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:13,175
Speaker 3:  I mean I was 18 I I believe that there's gonna be like password protected.

277
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:15,695
Speaker 4:  So there we go. We did it.

278
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:19,615
Speaker 3:  We finally understand what's driving iPhone development. It's these two.

279
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:24,815
Speaker 3:  We'll be announcing some subscription offerings later in the show.

280
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:30,695
Speaker 3:  So those are the, the highlight features of the, the two buttons coming to

281
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:33,335
Speaker 3:  the fence. Like I think that's what everyone is expecting. That's the leaks.

282
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:37,415
Speaker 3:  We've seen case leaks where the case manufacturers are having to deal with

283
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,615
Speaker 3:  this potential capacitive touch sensitive button on the pro phones.

284
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:44,255
Speaker 3:  Then obviously we're seeing camera upgrades

285
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:49,455
Speaker 3:  potentially a new ultra wide camera on the Pro, potentially a big Zoom upgrade

286
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:53,135
Speaker 3:  on the Pro Max I would say, the thing that I'm looking for most

287
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:57,535
Speaker 3:  is processing upgrades. I don't know if Apple's gonna talk about this.

288
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:02,015
Speaker 3:  I think iPhone photos are, they're, they're just starting to look a little

289
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:05,935
Speaker 3:  wild. And I think people are noticing, I think like lots of people are

290
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:09,335
Speaker 3:  noticing, I think we talked to the Hali developers

291
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:13,135
Speaker 3:  process Zero, their like minimal processing

292
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:17,215
Speaker 3:  system in that app is like a huge hit. And I think

293
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:19,735
Speaker 3:  it's just people are like, oh, photos with shadows are pretty good.

294
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:23,335
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like what if my photo looked the way I thought it was gonna look when

295
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,095
Speaker 4:  I took it? Like what a crazy idea that would be.

296
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:28,575
Speaker 3:  So I'm, I'm really curious to see if Apple responds to any of this anyway.

297
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:32,495
Speaker 3:  'cause the trend for all of these cameras, I think they all kind of look

298
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:35,775
Speaker 3:  the same now and they all for a minute. Do you remember like when Google

299
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:38,535
Speaker 3:  first did the Pixel, they were talking about what artists they were inspired

300
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:38,775
Speaker 3:  by.

301
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:39,775
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah.

302
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:43,335
Speaker 3:  And like they were like paintings and shadow and use of contrast and

303
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:47,415
Speaker 3:  there was this notion that cameras would have different looks and they

304
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:51,405
Speaker 3:  were like, wait a minute, what if we do Coney Island? Yeah. And now

305
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:55,365
Speaker 3:  they're all incredibly bright. Yeah. Across the board there's like no dynamics.

306
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:58,285
Speaker 3:  So I'm just interested to see if Apple starts to dial us back. 'cause I've

307
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,005
Speaker 3:  heard the criticism

308
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:04,515
Speaker 3:  when the criticism is in both like Kyle Chaco writing in the New Yorker

309
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:08,635
Speaker 3:  and Alex Earl sing her beach videos look gray. Like

310
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,795
Speaker 3:  the criticism has hit like the full spectrum of American life.

311
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:16,915
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. Well and especially for Apple, which has for so long

312
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:20,755
Speaker 4:  kind of hung its hat on being the one down the middle right. Where,

313
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:24,515
Speaker 4:  where Google and Samsung both got very kind of opinionated about what their

314
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:28,435
Speaker 4:  photos were gonna look like. Apple's whole thing was like realism and, and

315
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:31,195
Speaker 4:  and beauty and everything was gonna be great. And and their idea was like,

316
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:33,715
Speaker 4:  we're just gonna, we're gonna touch it up but we're not gonna change it.

317
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:36,795
Speaker 4:  And I feel like they've, they've tipped over that line over the last couple

318
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:40,475
Speaker 4:  of years. Particularly with the fifteens. I think. Yeah. That like, I like

319
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:44,195
Speaker 4:  the photos less on the iPhone 15 than almost any

320
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,955
Speaker 4:  iPhone before it. Yeah.

321
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:49,755
Speaker 3:  I have an upgrade. Becky has a 13 and it used to be that I made sure she

322
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:52,315
Speaker 3:  had the new one every year. 'cause we did, what do we do? We take pictures

323
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:55,555
Speaker 3:  of her kid. Yeah. So there's like, we should always just have the best one

324
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:59,475
Speaker 3:  and we just stopped at the 13. Like it is the most restrained of

325
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:02,835
Speaker 3:  the modern ones, but it's still not that restrained. So I. I'm just curious

326
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:06,515
Speaker 3:  about this like You can, You can throw hardware specs at this

327
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:10,355
Speaker 3:  camera, but it's the processing pipeline that is actually more interesting

328
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,395
Speaker 3:  now. And I, I don't know how they're gonna talk about it. I don't know if

329
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:17,355
Speaker 3:  they're gonna diverge on the regular and the pro, I'm, I'm just very curious

330
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,795
Speaker 3:  to see where this goes. Can you

331
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:22,675
Speaker 6:  Imagine the pro like good photos, the regular is

332
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,395
Speaker 6:  just like no day glow. We don't believe in highlights or we, we take the

333
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,915
Speaker 6:  highlights crank all the way to the top.

334
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:31,435
Speaker 4:  Well honestly there's a, there's a version of that that I think is completely

335
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,915
Speaker 4:  possible because a bunch of the rumors about the camera are about the camera

336
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,515
Speaker 4:  hardware that Apple is getting increasingly good at doing

337
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:42,475
Speaker 4:  teeny tiny optical zoom lenses inside of the iPhone stack

338
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:46,475
Speaker 4:  and that it's able to actually build better optics

339
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,395
Speaker 4:  into the phone. And in theory if You can do better optics, You can do less

340
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:54,355
Speaker 4:  processing, which gives Apple more leeway to say we're gonna do

341
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:57,635
Speaker 4:  less in your photos are gonna still look good. Whereas If, you go down to

342
00:19:57,635 --> 00:20:01,315
Speaker 4:  the base level phones, it's just not gonna be as good. And so it is by

343
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:04,835
Speaker 4:  definition gonna have to do more work. So like if Apple's gonna have a process

344
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:08,835
Speaker 4:  zero type thing, I can absolutely imagine it being a pro only

345
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,595
Speaker 3:  So I have heard almost the exact opposite.

346
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:15,435
Speaker 4:  Really? I just made that up. It just seems logical. But have you heard actual

347
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:16,995
Speaker 4:  stuff about this? Yeah,

348
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:20,115
Speaker 3:  I I I've just been talking to some folks and

349
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,995
Speaker 3:  we have to see how it goes with the new phone. You are correct that Apple's

350
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:26,835
Speaker 3:  getting better at optics, they're getting better at doing the thing inside

351
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:30,115
Speaker 3:  the phone, like building the actual camera hardware. But they're

352
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:34,235
Speaker 3:  ruthlessly optimizing it to collect as much light as they can.

353
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:35,315
Speaker 4:  Oh

354
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:38,355
Speaker 3:  Interesting. Everything else, they're kind of letting go because they can

355
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:41,715
Speaker 3:  fix it in the pipeline. So Apple's view of this is much like Google's view

356
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:44,595
Speaker 3:  is they're not building a camera. They're building a whole integrated imaging

357
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:48,205
Speaker 3:  pipeline and you know, it has some goal And. if you can

358
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:52,125
Speaker 3:  compensate for everything else except light collection,

359
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:55,565
Speaker 3:  then you should just ruthlessly prioritize light collection. 'cause that's

360
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:59,325
Speaker 3:  the thing. It's the most important thing. And then You can fix fringing

361
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:03,405
Speaker 3:  or distortion or whatever else might happen at your lens level

362
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:07,165
Speaker 3:  because you have all the light. Right. So You can, You can mathematically

363
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,525
Speaker 3:  correct a bunch of errors that you get in the actual hardware, but You can

364
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,045
Speaker 3:  never really mathematically correct for I didn't get enough light.

365
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:16,485
Speaker 4:  That's fascinating. So you're basically just turning it into like a big data

366
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:19,645
Speaker 4:  problem and it's like, okay the, the more, the more light we can throw at

367
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:23,285
Speaker 4:  this problem, the better we can do. Which I would not say makes me hopeful

368
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:25,965
Speaker 4:  for the idea that we are going to get something that looks less processed

369
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,045
Speaker 3:  Over time. This is why I was having this conversation. So it was right after

370
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:31,445
Speaker 3:  we published Sarah's piece about not being ready for AI image

371
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:35,605
Speaker 3:  like editing everywhere and you kind of get to this place where the

372
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:38,885
Speaker 3:  iPhone is already like kind of like doing a lot of sharpening and text and

373
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:42,845
Speaker 3:  people see the text is weird. If you over zoom on an image, You

374
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:46,125
Speaker 3:  can see it, it like invents faces in weird ways. They're not quite faces

375
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:49,605
Speaker 3:  and people are like, what is happening here? And it's like, oh, that's just

376
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:53,525
Speaker 3:  a bunch of image processing just gone awry. Yeah. And So I, I'm just very

377
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:57,445
Speaker 3:  curious with this phone in particular. Apple's not shipping

378
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,725
Speaker 3:  a bunch of Apple intelligence, but they're right on the cusp of it.

379
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:04,605
Speaker 3:  So this is kind of the last phone that's gonna take pictures,

380
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:09,405
Speaker 3:  right? Like straightforward pictures and then every phone after this is gonna

381
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:12,205
Speaker 3:  be like pictures with Apple intelligence or like whatever the next thing

382
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,765
Speaker 3:  is. And I'm just curious to see if they pull it back a little bit

383
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,925
Speaker 3:  so they can go forward in a different direction or if they just stay it with

384
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:24,635
Speaker 3:  the like have you seen the sky look at the sky?

385
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:29,115
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean it, it all does make me think of like, do you remember that

386
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:32,995
Speaker 4:  art project we talked about? I don't know God a year or so ago that it was,

387
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:35,435
Speaker 4:  it was the camera but it didn't have a lens. But every time you hit the shutter

388
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:39,275
Speaker 4:  it would like collect your location and mapping data about where you were

389
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,115
Speaker 4:  in all the satellite imagery and then stitch that into a photo that feels

390
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:47,015
Speaker 4:  increasingly close to where all of this is going. Like

391
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:50,935
Speaker 3:  I would like to remind you specifically David Pierce that when I

392
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:53,775
Speaker 3:  wanted to spend five hours talking about Samsung taking photos of the moon,

393
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:57,735
Speaker 3:  you were like ba and now you have just described the moon situation.

394
00:22:57,915 --> 00:22:58,135
Speaker 3:  No,

395
00:22:58,135 --> 00:22:59,735
Speaker 4:  No, no. When, when you said

396
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:00,415
Speaker 3:  You

397
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:03,695
Speaker 4:  Wanted to do that, we all bought tacos and then did it at Southwest. Southwest

398
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:04,215
Speaker 4:  for an hour and

399
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:08,055
Speaker 3:  A half. Well yeah, it's true. You all right? I had to pour some tequila into

400
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:11,495
Speaker 3:  David and then we talked about yeah that's Samsung generating images of the

401
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:15,455
Speaker 3:  moon instead of taking photos of the moon philosophical conundrum because

402
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:18,095
Speaker 3:  every photo of the moon is technically exactly the same 'cause the moon doesn't

403
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:21,975
Speaker 3:  change. Right. Again, we could spend five hours talking about the

404
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:22,135
Speaker 3:  moon,

405
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,255
Speaker 4:  But No, but it really, all that stuff increasingly feels less like

406
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:31,575
Speaker 4:  a, a weird thing and more like just where all of this inevitably is going.

407
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:32,055
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

408
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:36,055
Speaker 3:  And like I said, I think this camera in particular is just a, a

409
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:40,015
Speaker 3:  moment like it is for sure that the next camera will have

410
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:43,135
Speaker 3:  a bunch of AI stuff built into it. Yes. This one, they're not shipping a

411
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:46,565
Speaker 3:  bunch of it yet. So what's it, what's it gonna be? What's, what does this

412
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:48,965
Speaker 3:  destination look like and is it the final destination?

413
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:52,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well and Apple's already starting to do some of the, the like AI post-processing

414
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:55,525
Speaker 4:  stuff where You can move things around and remove them from photos. It's,

415
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:58,965
Speaker 4:  it has a lot of the stuff we've been talking about Google doing and I think

416
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:02,925
Speaker 4:  it's, it's gonna be really interesting to see and A how good that stuff is

417
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:06,565
Speaker 4:  on this camera and B, how close it is in the pipeline

418
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:11,005
Speaker 4:  because like Google and others have been putting it in other apps

419
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,805
Speaker 4:  and and making it like a slight sideline feature

420
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:19,005
Speaker 4:  Apple. We will see how quickly this becomes like just a normal part of the

421
00:24:19,005 --> 00:24:20,885
Speaker 4:  image taking process. Its gonna be fascinating.

422
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:25,365
Speaker 3:  Other stuff we we're seeing rumors, again,

423
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:29,405
Speaker 3:  lots of rumors that there's gonna be colors, like saturated colors instead

424
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:33,365
Speaker 3:  of all the pale stuff. Particularly in the regular 16. I think the pro

425
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:37,045
Speaker 3:  will probably still come in some muted colors. Mark Erman thinks there's

426
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:40,085
Speaker 3:  gonna be a gold. Yeah. Have been wanting angle gold iPhone back,

427
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:44,325
Speaker 3:  some minor improvements to screens, displays of the rumor. But the big rumor

428
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:47,245
Speaker 3:  is that everything's gonna get a little bit bigger. So 6.3 on the

429
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,885
Speaker 3:  little iPhone and 6.9 on

430
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:54,965
Speaker 3:  on the, on the maxes, which is fascinating. You know they already do the

431
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:58,845
Speaker 3:  plus size phones at 6.7 so we will, we'll just see where they land

432
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:02,765
Speaker 3:  on a bunch of screen sizes, but I think they're trying to differentiate the

433
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:06,685
Speaker 3:  plus from the max. 'cause I, big phones are just a

434
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:10,565
Speaker 3:  thing people like as much as we complain about them, people love a big phone,

435
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:12,765
Speaker 4:  But that has to have a maximum, right? Yeah.

436
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:16,645
Speaker 6:  Like people's hands, right. Have maximums. Like we're not, we

437
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:18,245
Speaker 6:  can't all palm a basketball

438
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:20,365
Speaker 3:  But some of us can and

439
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:22,165
Speaker 6:  And they will have a phone finally.

440
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:26,085
Speaker 3:  Many people aspire to apparently. Well obviously

441
00:25:26,085 --> 00:25:27,045
Speaker 3:  the next turn is folding,

442
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:28,125
Speaker 4:  Right?

443
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:32,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah, well that's what 25, 26 I think was what they were saying.

444
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,325
Speaker 4:  That's what we keep hearing. Yeah. And that it might be a flip before it's

445
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,445
Speaker 4:  a fold because that is the correct and good thing. And flip phones are better

446
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:38,965
Speaker 4:  than full

447
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:40,125
Speaker 6:  Phones. They're both good, they're different.

448
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:44,005
Speaker 3:  I, we, there's pixel line fold in the office. Chris Walch has one and I was

449
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,125
Speaker 3:  looking at it the other day and I was like, this phone rules, like it is

450
00:25:46,165 --> 00:25:49,005
Speaker 3:  a beautiful piece of hardware. Yeah. And I was like, they got the aspect

451
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,765
Speaker 3:  ratio on the front, right? And he was just like, yeah, I never unfold it.

452
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,885
Speaker 3:  I was like, well this is the problem.

453
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:55,485
Speaker 6:  So

454
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:59,245
Speaker 4:  Like what's funny is I was, I was at the doctor the other day

455
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:03,405
Speaker 4:  and my, when the guy checking me in found out what I did, we started

456
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:07,245
Speaker 4:  talking about tech and he had Motorola's new razor with the big

457
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:10,005
Speaker 4:  screen on the front and he said exactly the same thing. He was like, this

458
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:12,405
Speaker 4:  phone's so awesome. I never even opened it up. And I was like,

459
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:13,925
Speaker 6:  What do you have it?

460
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:17,005
Speaker 4:  You just have like an original iPhone basically.

461
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:20,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You just want the binky of having a giant phone If you need it. Right?

462
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:23,325
Speaker 3:  Just like everyone needs has the, the binky of wanting an Android tablet.

463
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:26,885
Speaker 3:  There's one thing that's deeply reassuring in all technology. It's the state

464
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:30,645
Speaker 3:  of Android tablets that that will always work the

465
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:34,365
Speaker 3:  absolutely great that's, I mean that's the phone, those are the phone rumors,

466
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:37,845
Speaker 3:  right? We're we're expecting slightly bigger screens action button on the

467
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:41,785
Speaker 3:  regular 16 camera button on the pro, you

468
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:44,885
Speaker 3:  know, some upgrades to wifi and blah blah blah. But really it's,

469
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:47,485
Speaker 3:  we're at, we're adding buttons to everything.

470
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:51,085
Speaker 6:  They might change the camera, right? Like they might change the positions

471
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:51,565
Speaker 6:  of the cameras.

472
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:56,445
Speaker 3:  I yeah, the rumor is that they'll do that to make spatial video support better.

473
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:58,805
Speaker 3:  But like, I

474
00:26:58,805 --> 00:26:58,885
Speaker 4:  Think

475
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,085
Speaker 6:  You don't think that's a reason?

476
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:04,245
Speaker 3:  I think they just rotate the cameras every couple years. Yeah, I think there's

477
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:07,085
Speaker 3:  just a wheel with three camera lenses on it and they spin it and they're

478
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:10,405
Speaker 3:  like, all right, that's it this year. Like it looks different now. I mean

479
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:12,805
Speaker 3:  there's, there's reasons to orient these cameras in all kinds of ways, but

480
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:17,205
Speaker 3:  I think they strive to make obvious visual changes more often than

481
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:20,805
Speaker 3:  we think because the dumb consumer

482
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,365
Speaker 3:  psychology is, if it looks different, you think it's different, then you

483
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:27,245
Speaker 3:  open it up and it's iOS and you're like, well nothing here has really changed.

484
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:29,085
Speaker 3:  So we'll see.

485
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:33,365
Speaker 4:  I do think there are, there are two interesting AI upgrades

486
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:36,645
Speaker 4:  that have been rumored. One is obviously the new chip.

487
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:41,845
Speaker 4:  We, we saw the M four in the iPad and that was

488
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:44,885
Speaker 4:  like a whole big AI story. The rumor for this one is that it's, it's still

489
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:48,565
Speaker 4:  gonna be Acer chips but presumably there will be a whole big like, oh my

490
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:51,125
Speaker 4:  God, look how fast it is. AI story about this one.

491
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:56,445
Speaker 4:  Yet again we're in a place where it's like when was the last time you

492
00:27:56,445 --> 00:28:00,245
Speaker 4:  needed all of the horsepower of your iPhone? No one does ever for

493
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,365
Speaker 4:  anything. Who knows? And then the other one, the

494
00:28:03,385 --> 00:28:04,325
Speaker 6:  For chatt PT.

495
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:08,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right. Shortcuts does take all of your processing power. Yeah,

496
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:12,165
Speaker 4:  that's real. And then the other one is a rumor I was just reading earlier

497
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:15,885
Speaker 4:  about apparently there there's some indication that there's going to be a

498
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:19,605
Speaker 4:  much improved microphone, which for me is a person who

499
00:28:19,715 --> 00:28:23,645
Speaker 4:  uses Siri all the time for like reminders and random

500
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:27,805
Speaker 4:  nonsense. And if indeed Siri is going to be like the

501
00:28:27,835 --> 00:28:31,245
Speaker 4:  core of Apple intelligence as a lot of people are expecting and big redesign

502
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:35,045
Speaker 4:  coming this year, like better microphone goes a really long

503
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:38,885
Speaker 4:  way towards making a lot of that stuff really work. Yeah. Which I think

504
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:42,085
Speaker 4:  would be very cool. But like the question then is like, is it have, have

505
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,965
Speaker 4:  you made like a very slightly better microphone or did did Apple like solve

506
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:47,725
Speaker 4:  something here that I I'm, I'm gonna be very clear,

507
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:50,405
Speaker 3:  They're gonna claim they solve something no matter what. For sure. I'll be

508
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:54,285
Speaker 3:  clear about that. But again, If, you think the future of input

509
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:58,405
Speaker 3:  is multimodal AI where the computer You can just talk to a computer

510
00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:02,285
Speaker 3:  where it can see stuff. These are little upgrades that actually add up to

511
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:06,045
Speaker 3:  an idea a hundred percent the whole idea, which is there are more ways

512
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:09,365
Speaker 3:  to communicate with this computer about what you want and it will have more

513
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:13,045
Speaker 3:  ways to communicate back at you. But Apple intelligence isn't shipping it.

514
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,005
Speaker 3:  I mean that's actually the question we're these products right? Is you're

515
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:19,485
Speaker 3:  gonna announce new iPhones, you're gonna announce basically a bunch of iterative

516
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:23,325
Speaker 3:  upgrades that seem really nice and then the big software turn

517
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,605
Speaker 3:  that makes them worth buying that Apple I think is banking on driving a huge

518
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:31,375
Speaker 3:  upgrade cycle isn't gonna be here. Right? We're not

519
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:34,975
Speaker 3:  expecting that into potentially all the way into next September. Like

520
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:39,135
Speaker 3:  the rollout of iOS 18 Apple intelligence features

521
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:43,645
Speaker 3:  is just gonna take a long time. Particularly like the big ticket ones. What

522
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:46,485
Speaker 3:  now? Like what, what are we gonna get today? Like we're not getting the

523
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:50,765
Speaker 3:  apps can plug into Siri so You can talk to Siri and have it executed.

524
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:54,245
Speaker 3:  Bunch of actions across Wrap. Like that's not, that's probably a year right?

525
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:57,645
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So what are we gonna get today? Is it summarizing notifications? Like

526
00:29:58,485 --> 00:29:59,525
Speaker 3:  I don't think that's good enough.

527
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:03,645
Speaker 4:  Those are already seeing people on the beta get the summarized

528
00:30:03,645 --> 00:30:07,085
Speaker 4:  notifications is so funny 'cause it's so not

529
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:11,165
Speaker 4:  helpful. Yeah. Like so many of these things are like I send somebody

530
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:15,245
Speaker 4:  a 70 word long text message and it summarizes it in 58 words.

531
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:19,245
Speaker 4:  Like what if we accomplished here? Like this is nothing we're not

532
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:20,845
Speaker 4:  doing, we're not doing anything anyone. So

533
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:24,325
Speaker 6:  Copy editor is very pleased with that though. Yeah. I guess like 20 words.

534
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,285
Speaker 6:  That's nice. Cut.

535
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:28,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah and I think with all of this again, like we're still very much in this

536
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:32,485
Speaker 4:  place of what is any of this for right? And I think

537
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:36,245
Speaker 4:  the, the thing that has been true about Apple forever is it has done a better

538
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:40,285
Speaker 4:  job of telling the what this is for story than anybody else. And

539
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:44,125
Speaker 4:  even with the iPhone it does a very good job of explaining to you why you

540
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:48,045
Speaker 4:  need all of the incredible processing power

541
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:50,405
Speaker 4:  on your phone that you're never gonna use. It's why they have the games on

542
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:53,045
Speaker 4:  stage, it's why they did the AR stuff on there for years. Like they, they

543
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:56,805
Speaker 4:  do a very good job of being like, here is a thing we built and here's why

544
00:30:56,805 --> 00:31:00,765
Speaker 4:  it's going to matter in your life. And I don't think that quite landed

545
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,165
Speaker 4:  at WDC

546
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:07,705
Speaker 4:  whatever did land is not shipping yet. And so like this is just

547
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:11,545
Speaker 4:  another crack at that same story for Apple and both how it has

548
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:15,105
Speaker 4:  refined that story over the last few months And whether it has figured anything

549
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:18,465
Speaker 4:  out to me is like the big question of this event. And

550
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:21,825
Speaker 3:  I'll add one more thing to it and the amount of times Apple

551
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:26,065
Speaker 3:  and other companies have shot themselves in the foot trying to tell

552
00:31:26,065 --> 00:31:26,625
Speaker 3:  that story.

553
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:27,305
Speaker 4:  Totally.

554
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:31,145
Speaker 3:  Because you know, Google got in trouble with, for the Gemini ad at the Olympics

555
00:31:31,145 --> 00:31:34,905
Speaker 3:  where the dad asked the AI to write a letter on behalf of a little girl to

556
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:38,505
Speaker 3:  Olympian and everyone's like, this is garbage. Like don't do this. Apple

557
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:42,305
Speaker 3:  has had a number of ad related controversies lately and then

558
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:46,665
Speaker 3:  one of their demos for summaries is Apple Intelligence

559
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:50,425
Speaker 3:  summarizing the Steve Jobs think difference speech. Oh

560
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:51,025
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's right

561
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:55,065
Speaker 3:  From the ad. You know, it's like here's the crazy ones. What like

562
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:58,745
Speaker 3:  don't, don't summarize that. Like no that's the art,

563
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:02,625
Speaker 3:  you know like even though it's a commercial, like people regard that in a

564
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,625
Speaker 3:  very emotional way and being like, here's what we can do now. We can make

565
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:09,265
Speaker 3:  that dumber. It's not actually the message we're trying to send. Right. And

566
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:12,945
Speaker 3:  So I think Apple's looking at all of this and saying, okay,

567
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:17,025
Speaker 3:  this is the real shot to communicate to customers. WWC is for

568
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:20,345
Speaker 3:  developers and hardcore nerds and you're listening to the show and that's

569
00:32:20,345 --> 00:32:23,545
Speaker 3:  you. That's just you. But

570
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:25,065
Speaker 4:  We love you to be clear. We love you. That's

571
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:25,585
Speaker 3:  That's us.

572
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:26,105
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

573
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,945
Speaker 3:  Right. And that's the first cut where they can be technical and they can

574
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:32,625
Speaker 3:  talk about token sizes and APIs and all this stuff. They talk about wc,

575
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:36,585
Speaker 3:  the iPhone event is we're gonna put this thing on local

576
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:39,550
Speaker 3:  news broadcasts around the country to be like, look what it can do.

577
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:44,465
Speaker 3:  And they, I don't think they know besides like,

578
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:48,745
Speaker 3:  read my boss's email and give me the bullet points of it. Erase people or

579
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:51,945
Speaker 3:  Right. If I had a shortcut, if I set the shortcut button to just be like,

580
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:55,305
Speaker 3:  no, but nice I could, I could just motor through my inbox.

581
00:32:56,525 --> 00:33:00,225
Speaker 3:  You know, it's actually really good. Right? Like that would be great. But

582
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:04,205
Speaker 3:  can they tell that story? Like, I don't know So I

583
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:06,725
Speaker 3:  think that's gonna be a real question 'cause the features aren't shipping

584
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:10,365
Speaker 3:  yet. Right. And so you're still kind of concocting these demos

585
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:13,445
Speaker 3:  about stuff that doesn't exist yet for a phone that might not be able to

586
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:16,125
Speaker 3:  do it. And that is I think a real puzzle. But

587
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,805
Speaker 6:  It also seems like they may potentially plow through a little

588
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:23,805
Speaker 6:  bit of this because we're seeing like a lot of other devices rumored like

589
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:26,405
Speaker 6:  more than I usually think of for an Apple event.

590
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,485
Speaker 3:  Right. So that's the phone. So I just wanted to wrap up on the phone. Like

591
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:32,285
Speaker 3:  the phone has a question mark in it, which is like how are they gonna talk

592
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:36,245
Speaker 3:  about AI features aren't there? The rest of them are,

593
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:40,805
Speaker 3:  except for the AirPods, which I think we're expecting some amount of redesign.

594
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:45,485
Speaker 3:  The Apple watch seems like a another bump. Right?

595
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:46,125
Speaker 3:  But

596
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,485
Speaker 6:  There may be three getting bumped.

597
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:52,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's the one spot where it seems like if there is going to be

598
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:56,525
Speaker 4:  something new and exciting, it's gonna be in

599
00:33:56,525 --> 00:34:00,325
Speaker 4:  the watch. Like there's been some, is there a, you know, apple Watch

600
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,045
Speaker 4:  series 10 series X

601
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:07,565
Speaker 4:  wild thing to happen? I think that there's probably not, but there's been

602
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:10,325
Speaker 4:  like a little bit of smoke around. Maybe there are some surprises in the

603
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:13,485
Speaker 4:  Apple Watch line coming this year because it's the anniversary. Well

604
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:17,405
Speaker 6:  The big rumor was that they were gonna get blood pressure monitoring or

605
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:21,205
Speaker 6:  sleep apnea detection and both of those are sound pretty

606
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:22,605
Speaker 6:  dead in the water for this year

607
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:26,325
Speaker 3:  Because they're in a giant lawsuit with the company. Yeah. Stealing because

608
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:26,525
Speaker 3:  they're

609
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:30,005
Speaker 6:  In a giant lawsuit and like blood pressure monitoring. They haven't gotten

610
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:34,125
Speaker 6:  FDA clearance or anything. Right. And and they have to, you

611
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:37,845
Speaker 6:  can't just be like, yeah we can test your blood pressure no FDA approval.

612
00:34:38,165 --> 00:34:42,085
Speaker 6:  That's not gonna happen. So yeah, it sounds like they, they were trying

613
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:45,525
Speaker 6:  to line a bunch of stuff up for the, the 10, the Apple Watch 10 and it just

614
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:45,725
Speaker 6:  sort

615
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:50,525
Speaker 3:  Park. Yeah. So I guess it feels like what we're gonna get is a very minor

616
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:54,525
Speaker 3:  bump to the Ultra because basic, I mean look the, the Apple

617
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,965
Speaker 3:  watch has like the best lock-in story of all time. Yes. Yep. If, you have

618
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:01,055
Speaker 3:  an iPhone, You can only buy this product. That's it.

619
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:04,055
Speaker 3:  There it is. Unless you're, you know, unless you're one of the people who

620
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:07,945
Speaker 3:  wants to buy a Garmin, in which case you buy a Garmin and use it sometimes,

621
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,425
Speaker 3:  but then you might still have an Apple watch like good luck. Weird. Right?

622
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:15,265
Speaker 3:  So like their need to competitively upgrade these products is very

623
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:19,025
Speaker 3:  low and then the products are really good, which is just a pretty

624
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:21,945
Speaker 3:  disastrous one-two punch of wanting to see like huge upgrades.

625
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,385
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It does seem like the, we're gonna get a bigger

626
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:30,945
Speaker 4:  regular watch to be the size of the ultra,

627
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:35,505
Speaker 4:  which is both cool and sort of alarming. Like I hate

628
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:40,215
Speaker 4:  truly hate that we are going to normalize these gigantic screens on

629
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:43,455
Speaker 4:  our wrist. Like Neli, I can read your watch through Riverside right now.

630
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:47,055
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I can see what's on your watch that can't pos this is not good.

631
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:50,055
Speaker 4:  How are we doing this? It's just, this is just what we

632
00:35:50,055 --> 00:35:52,495
Speaker 3:  Decided. I stare down Tim Cook's watch at every event. I'm like, what,

633
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:53,455
Speaker 4:  What's

634
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:53,855
Speaker 3:  On there buddy?

635
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:59,615
Speaker 3:  Look, if they I'm at like, make the Apple watch ultra black and I'll buy

636
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,575
Speaker 3:  a new one, great. That's what I want. This

637
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:04,375
Speaker 4:  Might happen, this product might happen. There's been some rumors about colors.

638
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,255
Speaker 3:  But yeah, there there's this rumor that we'll see the Apple Watch series

639
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:10,535
Speaker 3:  10 or the Series X, which is the 10th anniversary and it have like magnetic

640
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:14,575
Speaker 3:  bands and be thinner and be the design jump. And I,

641
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:19,055
Speaker 3:  I strongly think that in a time of sort of like declining

642
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:22,735
Speaker 3:  sales and up and like upward going services revenue

643
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:25,895
Speaker 3:  that Apple's desire to do that is quite low.

644
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:26,655
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

645
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:30,135
Speaker 3:  Because again, the product has like perfect lock in. Like what are you gonna

646
00:36:30,135 --> 00:36:33,615
Speaker 3:  do? Right? Like Tim Cook's staring you at me like, all right, you're leaving

647
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:37,175
Speaker 3:  with an iPhone, would you like to buy AppleCare a set of AirPods and an Apple

648
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:38,855
Speaker 3:  watch? 'cause you can't buy anything else.

649
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:44,175
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I doubt it's very popular to first buy a watch and then

650
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:48,815
Speaker 4:  buy an iPhone. Right? So it's not like they're trying to sell some, who is

651
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:48,975
Speaker 4:  that

652
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:49,215
Speaker 6:  Person?

653
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:53,295
Speaker 4:  This is what I mean. They're not like the, the, the impetus to get people

654
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:56,775
Speaker 4:  in if you're trying to make the Apple Watch great, is you're like, okay,

655
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:59,415
Speaker 4:  there are a bunch of people who will switch for an Apple watch. And I don't

656
00:36:59,415 --> 00:37:03,055
Speaker 4:  think that exists. I think like the, the Apple watch is not the first thing,

657
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:06,735
Speaker 4:  right? So, I feel like there's one, it's either the iPad or the iPhone. It

658
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,135
Speaker 3:  Is the first thing's one tiny category. And I'm only saying this 'cause it's

659
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:12,935
Speaker 3:  like the third day of elementary school here. Parents are buying Apple watches

660
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:14,815
Speaker 3:  for their kids who don't have phones. Fair. That's

661
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:14,855
Speaker 4:  Real

662
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:17,735
Speaker 3:  As tracking devices, it's texting devices and then you just, you're in the

663
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,135
Speaker 3:  ecosystem

664
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:20,535
Speaker 3:  then they got you.

665
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:24,375
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's something. And that is that, that I think is like the beginning

666
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,415
Speaker 4:  of something potentially big and interesting,

667
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,735
Speaker 4:  but that feels very new and yeah.

668
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:32,615
Speaker 3:  We'll, we'll see, like I said, I, I think we're gonna see upgrades to the

669
00:37:32,615 --> 00:37:35,335
Speaker 3:  Apple watch. I just think they're, it's all gonna be pretty iterative. That

670
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:38,815
Speaker 3:  is my bet. There is this rumor that you'll see the big upgrade. We'll see

671
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:42,735
Speaker 3:  how it goes. Yeah. The AirPods seem like the bigger change. Yes. Right. We're

672
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:43,655
Speaker 3:  expecting new AirPods,

673
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:48,735
Speaker 3:  AirPods four maybe AirPod, maybe new AirPods Pro.

674
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:52,055
Speaker 3:  and it seems like that's where you're gonna get the design change. And I

675
00:37:52,055 --> 00:37:54,655
Speaker 3:  think that is partially because that there's still open competition there.

676
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:57,415
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like You can get other Bluetooth EarPods

677
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:00,135
Speaker 4:  And there are in fact lots of really good ones out there.

678
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:04,175
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So You can see a little competition is, and obviously AirPods haven't

679
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:05,215
Speaker 3:  changed in a long time, but

680
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:09,055
Speaker 6:  If they change the design, what are all of those like horrible

681
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:11,215
Speaker 6:  knockoffs at seven 11 gonna do

682
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:15,575
Speaker 4:  Immediately change. The good news about that industry is, boy it does it

683
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:17,095
Speaker 4:  adapt? Yeah. Yeah.

684
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:21,255
Speaker 3:  Exactly. The, the factory in Shenzhen across from Apple's factory in

685
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:23,255
Speaker 3:  Shenzhen is on Red alert.

686
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:28,415
Speaker 3:  So AirPods four might have noise canceling.

687
00:38:29,645 --> 00:38:32,655
Speaker 3:  They, they'll be more of an open ear design. They'll sit on your ear instead

688
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:35,525
Speaker 3:  of like all the way in the way that the pros do like

689
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:38,725
Speaker 4:  That, which would be a big deal, right? If the the, the A NC plus

690
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:43,205
Speaker 4:  the like hang on your ear instead of stick in it. Super hard

691
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:46,445
Speaker 4:  to do. Chris Welch was pointing out in our slack the other day that lots

692
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:48,885
Speaker 4:  of companies have tried this and basically no one has ever done it very well.

693
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:53,765
Speaker 4:  As somebody who hates the ear blocking of the AirPods Pro. Like

694
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:57,525
Speaker 4:  I just don't, I just don't like 'em. Yeah. It feels bad. My ear, they make

695
00:38:57,525 --> 00:39:01,325
Speaker 4:  my ears like hot and pressure. I don't like it. So I use the hangy ones,

696
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:04,125
Speaker 4:  but then I don't get any of the noise cancellation. So if You can get, if

697
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,645
Speaker 4:  You can get the best of both worlds there, that's pretty awesome. Yeah. But

698
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,845
Speaker 4:  super hard to do. Technically

699
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:13,045
Speaker 3:  I'm looking And then the AirPods three maybe we'll see, they'll add some

700
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:16,965
Speaker 3:  more sensors to complete the health story that

701
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:20,045
Speaker 3:  Apple's trying to tell all of this stuff. Potentially a new case.

702
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:24,285
Speaker 3:  We'll see what I don't know is whether they're gonna upgrade the

703
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:27,405
Speaker 3:  AirPods Max, which they have not touched in a million years. Yeah, right.

704
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,365
Speaker 3:  What do they I'll use lightning.

705
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:32,925
Speaker 6:  Oh there we go. So they'll just get like A-U-S-B-C upgrade

706
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:36,205
Speaker 3:  Or they can make him not weigh 5,000 pounds. That's a choice. They

707
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:38,925
Speaker 6:  Can, they'll take out some of those weights, those Beats weights,

708
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:43,085
Speaker 3:  Those p Man, I forgot the Beats used to put weights in the headphones. They

709
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:45,845
Speaker 3:  could make the case good. There are lots of things You can do with your AirPods

710
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:46,245
Speaker 3:  mask. I

711
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:46,805
Speaker 6:  Love the little purse.

712
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:51,445
Speaker 3:  That's adorable. Hey, here, would you like your headphones to be dirty?

713
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:53,525
Speaker 6:  They sure will.

714
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:56,965
Speaker 3:  We, we've, we've forgotten to put them in a case in this case. We'll see.

715
00:39:57,005 --> 00:40:00,805
Speaker 3:  I mean, you know, there's a spatial audio story to be told here, but it seems

716
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:04,605
Speaker 3:  like of all the things that we expect to change that AirPods

717
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:08,005
Speaker 3:  lineup is the most ripe for actual change. Yeah.

718
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,885
Speaker 3:  Because it's a thing that You can, well one people lose them and then when

719
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:14,645
Speaker 3:  you lose them you might buy new headphones and when you buy new headphones

720
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,285
Speaker 3:  you actually have choices in the market.

721
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:21,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well and again, if Apple is trying to tell this like big multimodal

722
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:25,725
Speaker 4:  AI story, headphones actually end up being really important. And

723
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:29,645
Speaker 4:  my big hope for AirPods Max has been that like,

724
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:34,085
Speaker 4:  that could be a place where Apple can start to do more like local AI

725
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:38,005
Speaker 4:  processing inside of your headphones. Like give me the, the AirPods

726
00:40:38,025 --> 00:40:41,485
Speaker 4:  max that can do some of that stuff just inside of the headphones. Like I

727
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:44,405
Speaker 4:  want an AirPods max that has all the

728
00:40:45,325 --> 00:40:48,965
Speaker 4:  software of an Apple watch in my headphones. That's, is that a bad idea?

729
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:52,565
Speaker 4:  Probably, but that's what I want. I wanna just be able to run with headphones

730
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:55,525
Speaker 4:  and nothing else. And they could do that in the max. Would

731
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:58,965
Speaker 6:  You tap on the little ear cup and send a heartbeat to your wife?

732
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:02,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I just send my heartbeat to Neli like three or four times a day. It's

733
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:06,285
Speaker 3:  True. It's really weird. Yeah. Have you ever gotten a weird blacked out video

734
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:08,405
Speaker 3:  of just thumps and you're like, oh, David loves me.

735
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:14,605
Speaker 3:  The other rumor is, I, I sincerely doubt this will happen,

736
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:18,325
Speaker 3:  but an M four Mac mini is on the list of things I

737
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:19,925
Speaker 6:  Like. That's October. I

738
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:22,405
Speaker 3:  That's October I think. I think we'll see you Max in October. That's, that's

739
00:41:22,405 --> 00:41:23,045
Speaker 3:  been the schedule, right?

740
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:23,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

741
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:27,245
Speaker 6:  I'll be shocked. But you know, if they don't do anything with the phone,

742
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,125
Speaker 6:  it would make sense to do the M four. There's

743
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:34,085
Speaker 4:  Just been a lot of smoke about the Mac Mini, which is weird. So I I

744
00:41:34,085 --> 00:41:37,405
Speaker 4:  think like we're obviously due for a refresh of

745
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:41,605
Speaker 4:  MacBooks, right? The the M four is out there. It's time for

746
00:41:41,605 --> 00:41:43,765
Speaker 4:  all of this from like the studio on down.

747
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:49,045
Speaker 4:  But the mini is the only one that anyone is talking about right now. Which

748
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:51,765
Speaker 4:  is maybe just like a function of the rumor mill and the way that these things

749
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:55,685
Speaker 4:  work and an October event is not that far away. So it, it could very well

750
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:59,405
Speaker 4:  be, but the, this one is particularly just sort of out in the

751
00:41:59,405 --> 00:41:59,965
Speaker 4:  ether right now.

752
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:03,565
Speaker 6:  Mini's also the one that's getting a major case redesign, right? Like the

753
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,165
Speaker 6:  other ones aren't getting big case redesigns.

754
00:42:05,165 --> 00:42:08,005
Speaker 3:  And that is that if If you believe it's gonna get a big case redesign. It

755
00:42:08,005 --> 00:42:10,365
Speaker 3:  is definitely happening in October. Yeah,

756
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:11,005
Speaker 6:  That's

757
00:42:11,005 --> 00:42:13,725
Speaker 3:  Good. Apple is very good at being like, look at this thing. Yeah,

758
00:42:13,795 --> 00:42:14,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. One

759
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:15,285
Speaker 3:  Thing at a time.

760
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:18,885
Speaker 6:  I think it's really likely that we're just seeing a lot of smoke right now

761
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:22,285
Speaker 6:  because there's a lot of leaks because it's a whole new case, but it's gonna

762
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:23,325
Speaker 6:  happen in October. Not

763
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:27,385
Speaker 3:  That's my bet. Yeah. Is that Apple wants all of your attention to be on the

764
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:31,065
Speaker 3:  iPhone, which makes all the money and the services component of the iPhone,

765
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:33,745
Speaker 3:  which makes all the money and that is what you're gonna pay attention to.

766
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:36,465
Speaker 3:  And then in October we can talk about whether or not they're gonna make a

767
00:42:36,545 --> 00:42:40,185
Speaker 3:  a M four Mac mini or a 27 inch chime mac or whatever. I'm just saying that

768
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:43,745
Speaker 3:  'cause I desperately want a new 27 in Chime mac just trying to speak it into

769
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:44,345
Speaker 3:  the world. That's

770
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:47,105
Speaker 4:  How I feel about the M four Mac mini. Like give it to me now please.

771
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,465
Speaker 4:  The rumor is that it's gonna be like closer to the sides of an Apple TV and

772
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:55,065
Speaker 4:  it's just gonna have a bunch of USBC ports. Like Yes, that's, yes,

773
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:55,825
Speaker 4:  that's

774
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:56,465
Speaker 6:  It. That's all you

775
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:58,985
Speaker 4:  Have to do. Inject that into my veins right now.

776
00:42:59,335 --> 00:43:00,865
Speaker 6:  Make it under a thousand dollars please.

777
00:43:01,825 --> 00:43:03,505
Speaker 3:  I feel like I use all the ports in this Mac mini.

778
00:43:04,285 --> 00:43:07,945
Speaker 4:  Oh, I use all the ports and I have a dongle in my Mac Mini like it's, it's

779
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:08,225
Speaker 4:  a, yeah, I have

780
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:11,185
Speaker 3:  Thunderbolt four dock plugged into a Mac Mini because I use all the ports

781
00:43:11,185 --> 00:43:14,105
Speaker 3:  in the Mac Mini. Yeah. All right, we'll get, I'm telling you that's October.

782
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:16,585
Speaker 3:  We'll talk about this again another time. I think you're right. That is it.

783
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:19,905
Speaker 3:  I mean that's the list of things. David, you have some prompts here to which

784
00:43:19,985 --> 00:43:21,945
Speaker 3:  I will answer both with the same answer.

785
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:25,585
Speaker 4:  Yeah, this is, well, so we, we play a version of this game every year, which

786
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:29,465
Speaker 4:  is basically just before we get off the Apple stuff, we're, we're gonna

787
00:43:29,495 --> 00:43:33,145
Speaker 4:  give ourselves something to be held to. So we, we each had to come up with

788
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:37,705
Speaker 4:  a prediction that you think genuinely will happen neli,

789
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:41,785
Speaker 4:  you have to think it's going to happen. Oh. That we haven't yet talked about.

790
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:45,625
Speaker 4:  And then one thing that you're desperately hoping for but have no evidence

791
00:43:45,645 --> 00:43:49,505
Speaker 4:  is real. I'll go first and then, and then

792
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:53,345
Speaker 4:  just to give you guys time to, to think about this, my prediction

793
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:55,465
Speaker 4:  that I think will happen that we haven't talked about is I think we're gonna

794
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:57,145
Speaker 4:  get a Ted Lasso season four trailer. God

795
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:57,905
Speaker 6:  Dammit. That was mine.

796
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:01,705
Speaker 4:  I don't know what it's gonna be. It might just be Jason Sudeikis just like

797
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:04,905
Speaker 4:  saying four words because they haven't shot anything. This is how

798
00:44:04,905 --> 00:44:07,505
Speaker 3:  We do trailers now, right? Yeah. It's like it'll be the back of his head.

799
00:44:07,785 --> 00:44:10,625
Speaker 4:  I mean, do you remember the Apple event where like they all just stood on

800
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:14,105
Speaker 4:  stage and said, we're making a TV show. I made fun of that for a year and

801
00:44:14,105 --> 00:44:15,905
Speaker 4:  then they made all of those shows. So the See

802
00:44:15,905 --> 00:44:19,585
Speaker 6:  Apple, he's not gonna be in it very much. He's he, he

803
00:44:19,745 --> 00:44:20,145
Speaker 6:  apparently like

804
00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:21,185
Speaker 4:  What's he doing now? Do

805
00:44:21,185 --> 00:44:22,785
Speaker 3:  You think it's gonna be called like Dead lasso?

806
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:26,745
Speaker 6:  Well the rumor is it's probably, it's gonna be about a

807
00:44:26,775 --> 00:44:28,305
Speaker 6:  woman's football team.

808
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:30,105
Speaker 3:  It's really Come

809
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:33,485
Speaker 4:  On. It's just Ted Lasso in the Severance Universe. It's called Dead Lasso.

810
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:34,365
Speaker 6:  He's just dead.

811
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:40,005
Speaker 6:  But yeah, I've just, I'm just very excited about Ted

812
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:40,485
Speaker 6:  Lasso.

813
00:44:40,955 --> 00:44:44,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah, but he's not gonna be there and and like any good company, they're

814
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:45,805
Speaker 3:  like, let's just go back to the, well they just

815
00:44:45,805 --> 00:44:49,165
Speaker 6:  Signed all those people in the last few weeks. It feels like this is where

816
00:44:49,165 --> 00:44:50,005
Speaker 6:  they're gonna answer it. Apple

817
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:52,725
Speaker 4:  Is just speed running the TV industry, right? Yeah. Like they've pissed off

818
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:55,445
Speaker 4:  George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Congratulations. Now they're bringing back

819
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:59,045
Speaker 4:  the hits. Like this is just what you do. Great job them. And then the thing

820
00:44:59,065 --> 00:45:02,925
Speaker 4:  I'm desperately hoping for but have no evidence is real is I

821
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:05,925
Speaker 4:  want a cellular connected set of AirPods.

822
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:10,885
Speaker 4:  I want, I want a thing. I will switch to Apple Music you

823
00:45:11,035 --> 00:45:14,285
Speaker 4:  like as God is my witness. I will switch to Apple Music. If, you just let

824
00:45:14,285 --> 00:45:17,765
Speaker 4:  me stream directly to my headphones. That's all I want.

825
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,725
Speaker 4:  Is that a bad idea? Yes. But I want it anyway. I don't care.

826
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:21,725
Speaker 3:  Would

827
00:45:21,725 --> 00:45:22,085
Speaker 6:  You, would you

828
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:24,085
Speaker 3:  Like text from it? You directly to the brain? Yeah.

829
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:27,205
Speaker 4:  Just, alright, ela you go, what do you got

830
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:32,125
Speaker 3:  My prediction. One thing that I'm hoping that will happen and we haven't

831
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:32,645
Speaker 3:  talked about,

832
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:35,525
Speaker 4:  No one thing you think will happen that we haven't talked about.

833
00:45:35,665 --> 00:45:36,685
Speaker 3:  Oh wait, it

834
00:45:36,685 --> 00:45:37,205
Speaker 6:  Has to be real,

835
00:45:38,015 --> 00:45:38,365
Speaker 3:  Right?

836
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:40,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You have to think it's gonna happen.

837
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:45,785
Speaker 3:  Okay. Apple TV home screen upgrade.

838
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:46,715
Speaker 6:  Oh,

839
00:45:46,815 --> 00:45:47,395
Speaker 4:  Ooh, okay.

840
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:48,995
Speaker 6:  That's a good

841
00:45:48,995 --> 00:45:51,755
Speaker 3:  They're they're due. It won't happen. They're due. It won't do, they would've

842
00:45:51,755 --> 00:45:55,235
Speaker 3:  announced it at wwc, but they're way overdue

843
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:58,795
Speaker 3:  on just scooting that stuff around. Yeah.

844
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:03,435
Speaker 4:  Can I just say, by the way, I bought an Apple TV because it was on sale from

845
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:07,515
Speaker 4:  Verizon for $90 for some reason plugged it into my

846
00:46:07,855 --> 00:46:11,715
Speaker 4:  crappy TCL Roku tv. Set it so that it just goes straight

847
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:14,915
Speaker 4:  to that input when I turn on the TV and now suddenly my TV viewing experience

848
00:46:14,915 --> 00:46:18,715
Speaker 4:  is like 75% better. Yeah, you got rid of Ro boy. Is Roku bad now?

849
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:20,995
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And boy did the Apple TV make it better?

850
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:23,635
Speaker 3:  I don't think we've talked about this very much in the show, but our own

851
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:27,515
Speaker 3:  will Joel, our senior creative director, will, Joel has a Roku tv

852
00:46:27,775 --> 00:46:31,075
Speaker 3:  and the thing happened to him where it just started motion smoothing this

853
00:46:31,075 --> 00:46:34,235
Speaker 3:  also happened to be at my sister's house over the 4th of July where her Roku

854
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:37,995
Speaker 3:  TVs just turned on motion smoothing. So he wrote about it and he wrote, the

855
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,555
Speaker 3:  people in the forum are all mad about this motion smoothing just being turned

856
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:44,395
Speaker 3:  on on Roku TVs. We have not yet written the follow-up, but they got back

857
00:46:45,115 --> 00:46:48,595
Speaker 3:  to him somewhat irritatedly, and they're like, we have not turned

858
00:46:48,595 --> 00:46:52,355
Speaker 3:  on motion smoothing. We've turned on

859
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:55,115
Speaker 3:  like per frame interpolation, which is motion smoothing. Yep.

860
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:55,875
Speaker 4:  It's

861
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:55,955
Speaker 6:  The

862
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:57,235
Speaker 4:  Same thing. Same thing. It's

863
00:46:57,235 --> 00:47:01,035
Speaker 3:  The same. They're like, we're not motion smoothing. We're going into the

864
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:04,915
Speaker 3:  spaces between frames and making up additional frames. And it's like, that's

865
00:47:04,915 --> 00:47:08,355
Speaker 3:  motion smoothing. That's one. So he's gotta write it up. But Roku has secretly

866
00:47:08,355 --> 00:47:11,115
Speaker 3:  turned on motion, smoothing on, on millions of TVs with no ways turn off.

867
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:15,115
Speaker 3:  And now they're denying they even did it. Throw 'em out, get all lets, yep.

868
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:18,315
Speaker 6:  They're too busy counting that ad money they get. They don't, they don't

869
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:18,395
Speaker 6:  care.

870
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:21,955
Speaker 3:  All right. That's my prediction. We haven't talked about that. I, on the

871
00:47:21,955 --> 00:47:24,515
Speaker 3:  closest that I think is real. Can I say the one thing that will definitely

872
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:28,235
Speaker 3:  not happen? Yeah. Apple will definitely not announce a single

873
00:47:28,235 --> 00:47:30,525
Speaker 3:  other car maker, maker has taken them up on Next generation.

874
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:36,925
Speaker 4:  Okay. I like this. Fair. Is this the one that you're hoping for but have

875
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:40,685
Speaker 4:  no evidence is real? Someone please. One other car maker do CarPlay.

876
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:45,685
Speaker 3:  I mean, I will say the decoder inbox right now is full of car makers who

877
00:47:45,685 --> 00:47:48,365
Speaker 3:  are like, let us justify what we won't, we're not doing this anymore, which

878
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:48,405
Speaker 3:  is

879
00:47:48,405 --> 00:47:50,805
Speaker 4:  Weird. Wait, who would you like it to be? If. you could If, you could be

880
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:55,245
Speaker 4:  CEO for a day and make somebody adopt the new car play for either good or

881
00:47:55,245 --> 00:47:57,285
Speaker 4:  chaos reasons. Which car maker would you want it to

882
00:47:57,285 --> 00:48:01,205
Speaker 3:  Be? It would be Honda or Toyota, in my opinion. Okay. Who have some of

883
00:48:01,205 --> 00:48:05,125
Speaker 3:  the ugliest in-car interface designs? O of all the

884
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:08,685
Speaker 3:  mainstream cars. It's like, just tell your designers that

885
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,885
Speaker 3:  lowercase letters exist.

886
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:11,765
Speaker 6:  They refuse.

887
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:15,845
Speaker 3:  Like why are, we're we're just doing all cap software. Everybody, all

888
00:48:15,845 --> 00:48:19,725
Speaker 3:  the time. Like just lowercase. That's the

889
00:48:19,725 --> 00:48:21,165
Speaker 3:  level we're working at with Honda and Toyota.

890
00:48:22,005 --> 00:48:23,605
Speaker 4:  I like it. All right. Cranz, what do you got?

891
00:48:23,905 --> 00:48:27,245
Speaker 6:  All right. So my prediction that I think will happen was also Ted Lasso,

892
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:28,245
Speaker 6:  so we covered

893
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:29,805
Speaker 4:  It. Oh, okay. Well now you have to come up with the new one. Yeah. Ready

894
00:48:29,805 --> 00:48:30,125
Speaker 4:  to go. I

895
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:32,645
Speaker 6:  Wrote it. I wrote it down. I wanna be very clear. I didn't make it up.

896
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:36,645
Speaker 4:  Do you think Jason Sudeikis will be there? That's the

897
00:48:36,645 --> 00:48:38,685
Speaker 6:  Real question. No, I don't think he will be. I think if they have anyone

898
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:42,205
Speaker 6:  it'll be Hannah Watting because like she has never turned down a,

899
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:46,125
Speaker 6:  a press tour. That's right. She, if somebody's like, Hey, you wanna show

900
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:47,005
Speaker 6:  up? She's like, I'm here for you.

901
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,325
Speaker 4:  Maybe she'll be the musical act at the end.

902
00:48:49,865 --> 00:48:52,365
Speaker 3:  We should get Hannah Wat can we get her to come on The. Vergecast

903
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:53,685
Speaker 6:  She, yeah, she I bet she would.

904
00:48:54,785 --> 00:48:56,965
Speaker 4:  She seems like good people. Yeah, lets do it. Yeah, she seems fun. We'll

905
00:48:56,965 --> 00:48:58,005
Speaker 4:  make it happen. Leah. Let's get that done.

906
00:48:58,955 --> 00:48:59,445
Speaker 3:  Chop chop.

907
00:49:01,425 --> 00:49:03,845
Speaker 4:  All right. And one thing you're hoping for would have no evidence is real

908
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:07,365
Speaker 6:  RayBan meta glasses, but Apple.

909
00:49:07,785 --> 00:49:08,005
Speaker 4:  Mm.

910
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:12,925
Speaker 6:  Just because I really like the RayBan meta glasses, but the meta

911
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:17,325
Speaker 6:  AI sucks. I wanna talk to Siri. She's also suck. Or excuse

912
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:20,485
Speaker 6:  me, Siri also sucks and is not gendered,

913
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:25,385
Speaker 6:  but it sucks in a more familiar way.

914
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:29,065
Speaker 4:  Well, it sucks in a way that actually accesses other apps on my phone.

915
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:30,385
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like, like I, whereas

916
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:33,625
Speaker 4:  Meta sucks, like in its on it all by itself. Yeah. It just sucks over here.

917
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:37,825
Speaker 6:  Meta's like, I can play your Spotify. That's it. Like,

918
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:37,985
Speaker 6:  well

919
00:49:39,095 --> 00:49:42,865
Speaker 3:  Stop. I didn't do my no evidence for, which is the only thing I

920
00:49:42,995 --> 00:49:46,985
Speaker 3:  every, I predict this at every Apple event I have for a decade. Just make

921
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:47,305
Speaker 3:  a tv.

922
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:53,105
Speaker 3:  Just make a tv. It's you're, what are you doing guys? You

923
00:49:53,205 --> 00:49:56,745
Speaker 3:  you love services businesses. Do you know what every TV maker is doing right

924
00:49:56,745 --> 00:50:00,425
Speaker 3:  now? They're just doing services. They're giving 'em away for free. You could

925
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:03,825
Speaker 3:  charge real money. Tim You can be like, I don't know, this TV costs

926
00:50:03,825 --> 00:50:07,585
Speaker 3:  $3,000 and people would buy it and still pay for your weird new cable bundle

927
00:50:07,585 --> 00:50:09,825
Speaker 3:  that you're making. But not saying that you're making

928
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,465
Speaker 6:  Yeah, but they gotta spend all their money on the weird cable bundle. They

929
00:50:12,465 --> 00:50:13,945
Speaker 6:  can't afford the TVs. Apple

930
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:17,825
Speaker 4:  Releases an iPad at studio display size.

931
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:19,425
Speaker 4:  Is that a television?

932
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:21,265
Speaker 3:  What is a tv?

933
00:50:22,865 --> 00:50:25,745
Speaker 3:  I mean, every TV is just an Android tablet.

934
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:27,405
Speaker 6:  Okay. But like

935
00:50:27,795 --> 00:50:28,685
Speaker 4:  Feeling good one.

936
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:32,485
Speaker 6:  I feel like the tablet is larger than the child holding it. It's, it goes

937
00:50:32,485 --> 00:50:33,565
Speaker 6:  into TV territory

938
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,965
Speaker 3:  That's pretty dependent on the size of the child.

939
00:50:36,355 --> 00:50:37,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah, but like

940
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:40,845
Speaker 3:  Who else? So wait, you're saying as my child gets older Yeah. It

941
00:50:41,025 --> 00:50:43,245
Speaker 3:  it some point it stops seeing a tv. It's the

942
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:44,325
Speaker 4:  Tablet diagonal

943
00:50:46,035 --> 00:50:49,485
Speaker 3:  Like size of child versus size of tablet. Exactly. And then age is like the

944
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:50,205
Speaker 3:  Z axis.

945
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:53,165
Speaker 4:  Okay.

946
00:50:53,585 --> 00:50:57,045
Speaker 3:  In in four dimensional space. This is a TV is what you're trying to say.

947
00:50:57,315 --> 00:50:57,805
Speaker 6:  Exactly.

948
00:50:58,345 --> 00:51:01,405
Speaker 3:  I'm just saying make a tv. It is, it is almost comical

949
00:51:02,395 --> 00:51:05,525
Speaker 3:  that the one category that they could thoroughly dominate,

950
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:09,125
Speaker 3:  they are just like, eh, healthcare.

951
00:51:10,355 --> 00:51:13,805
Speaker 4:  Well, and what's funny is, for all the reasons it actually never

952
00:51:30,165 --> 00:51:30,725
Speaker 3:  I beg If you.

953
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:32,325
Speaker 4:  Gene Munster needs this.

954
00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:05,405
Speaker 3:  Okay, we're back. We're already over.

955
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:09,805
Speaker 3:  We've had a lot of people asking lately how long the show's supposed to be

956
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:11,525
Speaker 3:  and the answer is we're never gonna tell you.

957
00:55:13,345 --> 00:55:17,125
Speaker 3:  That's the it's the joke. Yeah. You will notice the show is almost

958
00:55:17,435 --> 00:55:21,165
Speaker 3:  very consistently the same length, but we're always over our minds.

959
00:55:21,165 --> 00:55:21,925
Speaker 4:  We are always over.

960
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:25,245
Speaker 3:  It's never as long as it's supposed to be. The other thing that is true,

961
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:28,005
Speaker 3:  as I make the show longer with this fan thing about how long the show is

962
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:31,965
Speaker 3:  gonna be when we make it shorter, everyone yells at us. But then

963
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:34,245
Speaker 3:  when we ask people for feedback on the show, they tell us to make it shorter.

964
00:55:34,705 --> 00:55:38,365
Speaker 3:  So we're just trapped in like a paradox loop of feedback

965
00:55:39,175 --> 00:55:42,525
Speaker 3:  where the show can only ever be this long, but it's never long enough and

966
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:43,725
Speaker 3:  it's also too long. Yep.

967
00:55:43,825 --> 00:55:46,525
Speaker 4:  The other thing people need to understand is you're, you're just doing this

968
00:55:46,545 --> 00:55:50,045
Speaker 4:  all the time. Like ELA is just sitting in front of a microphone talking about

969
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:53,885
Speaker 4:  things all the time. We just occasionally record it and then and then ship

970
00:55:53,885 --> 00:55:56,925
Speaker 4:  it. So it can be as long as we want. Yeah. But it's also just always

971
00:55:56,995 --> 00:56:00,925
Speaker 3:  Imagine what our meetings are like. Let's drop in on Neil. I've birch

972
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:01,645
Speaker 3:  casting the no one.

973
00:56:04,075 --> 00:56:07,925
Speaker 3:  Alright. It's IFA, which is a German word for gadget show.

974
00:56:09,515 --> 00:56:13,165
Speaker 3:  Sure. We got a team there. There's a million gadgets being

975
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:16,725
Speaker 3:  announced. I think we should do this as a lightning round. We should just

976
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:20,245
Speaker 3:  go through 'em all except the first one. There's no chance we're gonna get

977
00:56:20,245 --> 00:56:22,925
Speaker 3:  through this enlightening round fashion. No, because it is the remarkable

978
00:56:23,095 --> 00:56:26,845
Speaker 3:  Paper pro, which Alex's headline is, is as outrageous

979
00:56:27,025 --> 00:56:29,325
Speaker 3:  as it is luxurious. Alex, what is going on here?

980
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:33,165
Speaker 6:  Okay, so they took the gallery e ink

981
00:56:33,165 --> 00:56:35,125
Speaker 6:  display and then they, which

982
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,445
Speaker 3:  Everyone, everyone remembers the gallery. Everybody

983
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:38,965
Speaker 6:  Knows this classic, everybody knows gallery. Duh. It's a well

984
00:56:39,425 --> 00:56:42,085
Speaker 3:  The street. Oh day talked about the gallery when Mom's

985
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:44,125
Speaker 4:  Fault earlier and it was like, oh the gallery. What's up with gallery?

986
00:56:44,445 --> 00:56:47,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like when I go to the grocery store people are like, do you think gallery's

987
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:51,005
Speaker 6:  coming this year? And I can say yes. It finally came.

988
00:56:51,185 --> 00:56:54,965
Speaker 6:  So, so there's two types, there's two ways to do color, E color on E

989
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:58,845
Speaker 6:  ink. One is you push the black and white ink pixels in the

990
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:02,925
Speaker 6:  e ink against a color filter. That's how Kaleido works. That's how

991
00:57:02,925 --> 00:57:06,445
Speaker 6:  like anything from books or Cobo and probably

992
00:57:06,705 --> 00:57:10,365
Speaker 6:  if Amazon ever does it, that's what they'll use as Kaleido. 'cause it works

993
00:57:10,365 --> 00:57:14,205
Speaker 6:  really, really fast. Then there's gallery which looks way, way better.

994
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:17,565
Speaker 6:  The color is way, way cooler because they get rid of the filter and all the,

995
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:21,765
Speaker 6:  the pixels being moved are actual color pixels of cyan, yellow

996
00:57:21,785 --> 00:57:25,525
Speaker 6:  and magenta. And that's what they did here. And

997
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,365
Speaker 6:  usually you don't wanna do that 'cause it's slow and sucks but

998
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:33,205
Speaker 6:  it's fast. How do you make it fast? They made it fast when I asked. They

999
00:57:33,205 --> 00:57:36,125
Speaker 6:  were like, we can't tell you trade secrets.

1000
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:39,205
Speaker 4:  Coco. That's like the magic sauce here is they figured out how to refresh

1001
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:39,965
Speaker 4:  it quickly. Cocaine.

1002
00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:41,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. That, that's totally Your display

1003
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:41,885
Speaker 3:  Has cocaine in

1004
00:57:41,885 --> 00:57:44,645
Speaker 6:  It. They call it the canvas tech stack.

1005
00:57:45,985 --> 00:57:49,845
Speaker 6:  And, and I don't know, I'm not entirely like, I have some theories of what

1006
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:52,085
Speaker 6:  they've done. I've been playing with it a lot. I'm gonna keep playing with

1007
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:55,605
Speaker 6:  it, but it just, it works. But there's like a really

1008
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,565
Speaker 6:  obnoxious flashing problem with anything that you write in color.

1009
00:57:59,315 --> 00:58:02,925
Speaker 6:  Anytime you write in color, it like has to refresh the entire display. Ooh.

1010
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:05,005
Speaker 6:  As soon as you stop writing, that sucks.

1011
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:06,725
Speaker 4:  Don't love that. Yeah.

1012
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:09,125
Speaker 6:  But then for just regular writing it works perfectly.

1013
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,205
Speaker 4:  But it looks great. I mean like you, you've just been like holding it up

1014
00:58:12,205 --> 00:58:15,325
Speaker 4:  in, into the camera as we've been talking and like the screen looks awesome.

1015
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:15,845

00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:19,485
Speaker 6:  Me, I'm gonna pull up another photo 'cause I just keep doing that.

00:58:19,555 --> 00:58:23,325
Speaker 6:  Poor Liam was at the office the other day and I was like, Liam look. And

1020
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:29,765
Speaker 4:  Nice.

1021
00:58:30,235 --> 00:58:31,125
Speaker 6:  It's just real pretty.

1022
00:58:33,155 --> 00:58:37,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's one of those Don't buy it. Please. Please don't buy this. This

1023
00:58:37,045 --> 00:58:40,685
Speaker 6:  is, this is not for normal people. But this is such like, the fact that they

1024
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:41,925
Speaker 6:  pulled it off is really cool.

1025
00:58:42,675 --> 00:58:42,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1026
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:47,085
Speaker 4:  So to your don't buy it point like Dave,

1027
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:48,445
Speaker 3:  It's like I'm gonna buy it. I

1028
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:52,405
Speaker 4:  Do, I I want it more than I am proud of. So the thing

1029
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:56,685
Speaker 4:  remarkable has done really well is like relentlessly focus on

1030
00:58:56,685 --> 00:59:00,125
Speaker 4:  of doing a very small thing really, really well. Yep. Right. Like or the

1031
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:03,485
Speaker 4:  remarkable tablet all the way back to the first one is like a thoroughly

1032
00:59:03,725 --> 00:59:07,365
Speaker 4:  mediocre reading experience and just like deeply lovely to write on. Yep.

1033
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:11,885
Speaker 4:  The the keyboard case. I have only used a little. You've used it a lot more

1034
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:16,605
Speaker 4:  is wonderful by all accounts. So it's like as a,

1035
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:19,725
Speaker 4:  as a note taking machine, this thing is really expensive. It's what,

1036
00:59:19,725 --> 00:59:21,490
Speaker 4:  $579? Yeah.

1037
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,925
Speaker 6:  It starts at 5 79 without the case. Like the typing case is

1038
00:59:24,925 --> 00:59:25,565
Speaker 6:  like 2 29.

1039
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:27,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So you're looking at like a $900.

1040
00:59:27,895 --> 00:59:30,925
Speaker 6:  Don't don't do that. But also thing all way here. Also do it. Yeah.

1041
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:34,845
Speaker 4:  But that's the thing. And I'm like it, I just, I even If you don't

1042
00:59:34,845 --> 00:59:37,725
Speaker 4:  buy it. I appreciate that. Remarkable is just like we are going to make digital

1043
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:42,365
Speaker 4:  handwriting note taking. Awesome. And have like done it. Like kudos to you.

1044
00:59:42,565 --> 00:59:46,525
Speaker 4:  Remarkable. Yeah. You did the damn thing. Great job. I have a re

1045
00:59:46,665 --> 00:59:50,605
Speaker 4:  the remarkable two here and I love it. I never write by hand because my handwriting

1046
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:53,365
Speaker 4:  is awful and I find myself using this thing just 'cause it's really nice

1047
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:54,205
Speaker 4:  to write on. Well and

1048
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:57,565
Speaker 6:  It's actually pretty, I also have awful handwriting 'cause it's a child.

1049
00:59:57,605 --> 01:00:01,365
Speaker 6:  I wanted to be a doctor and I thought you had to have bad handwriting. But

1050
01:00:01,425 --> 01:00:05,005
Speaker 6:  it actually does a really good job of of, of taking that and putting it into

1051
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:07,925
Speaker 6:  text If you do to do it. Like it It does, it sucks. It sucks a little bit,

1052
01:00:07,925 --> 01:00:11,645
Speaker 6:  but not like awful. And it's just like, it does the one thing

1053
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:15,445
Speaker 6:  really, really, really well. and it does it, it executes it so wonderfully

1054
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:19,645
Speaker 6:  and it takes this technology that I never thought I would see being used

1055
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:22,325
Speaker 6:  this way and doing it remarkably

1056
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:24,925
Speaker 6:  very well and it very good.

1057
01:00:24,975 --> 01:00:25,485
Speaker 3:  We're gonna

1058
01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:29,205
Speaker 6:  Move on now. It's Yeah, it's great. I I did, I did the dad jokes, so

1059
01:00:29,745 --> 01:00:32,005
Speaker 3:  That's good. Well, you're gonna review it, I assume. Yeah.

1060
01:00:32,035 --> 01:00:35,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I did like kind of a mini review of it. I, I, I've only spent about

1061
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:38,045
Speaker 6:  six, six or seven days with it at this point. I wanna spend more time with

1062
01:00:38,045 --> 01:00:41,725
Speaker 6:  it, but it's, it's a remarkable tablet. If you've used another one,

1063
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:43,765
Speaker 6:  it'll be the exact same thing. Only now it's color.

1064
01:00:44,595 --> 01:00:48,525
Speaker 3:  Okay. Honor announced a super thin foldable IFA. It's

1065
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:51,485
Speaker 3:  very cool. and it, what we're seeing, and I'll I'll put it right next to

1066
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:55,725
Speaker 3:  Huawei, announced a trifold phone. And also

1067
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:59,765
Speaker 4:  I forgot that the thing IFA does, like when IFA is at its best IFA is the

1068
01:00:59,765 --> 01:01:02,805
Speaker 4:  time where they're like, oh you silly Americans. You don't get to have the

1069
01:01:02,805 --> 01:01:05,285
Speaker 4:  good gadgets. Yeah. Yeah. and it always makes me sad, right?

1070
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:07,965
Speaker 3:  It's like you have lockdown cell networks that prevent you from having the

1071
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:11,085
Speaker 3:  cool phones. You know, I, I think I said earlier, the pixel line fold

1072
01:01:11,945 --> 01:01:15,885
Speaker 3:  is great. It's like the end of that road. I, I think the same with

1073
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:19,805
Speaker 3:  the newest Samsung folds. Like they, they're done. They, we figured out

1074
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:22,085
Speaker 3:  how to do that thing. They look as good as they're gonna look. The hardware

1075
01:01:22,085 --> 01:01:24,845
Speaker 3:  is great. The form factors are getting there. And now they're like, what

1076
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:25,845
Speaker 3:  If you folded it twice.

1077
01:01:27,565 --> 01:01:31,095
Speaker 3:  Like what If, you made them thinner. Like we're just adding these refinements

1078
01:01:31,095 --> 01:01:34,895
Speaker 3:  now to the, the form factor. I'm not sure that the form factors

1079
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:38,255
Speaker 3:  were the revolution in the phone industry that everyone was hoping they would

1080
01:01:38,255 --> 01:01:41,655
Speaker 3:  be. But I think the trifold is really interesting, right? Like

1081
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:45,615
Speaker 3:  what if You can get to a landscape tablet in this form factor is like kind

1082
01:01:45,615 --> 01:01:48,015
Speaker 3:  of wild. Yeah. Especially If. you can make it thinner. You can fold it yet

1083
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:48,495
Speaker 3:  one more time.

1084
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:52,015
Speaker 6:  They didn't actually show it. Right? Like they, like they showed cl

1085
01:01:52,215 --> 01:01:56,015
Speaker 6:  glimpses of it while Andy Lau is just thinking about how much he loves movies.

1086
01:01:56,365 --> 01:02:00,055
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think the, the official reveal of it is I think the day after

1087
01:02:00,795 --> 01:02:04,495
Speaker 4:  the iPhone event. Yeah. So we'll, we'll have that to talk about next week

1088
01:02:04,685 --> 01:02:08,095
Speaker 4:  also. But yeah, there's, there's a video that, we'll, we'll put it in the

1089
01:02:08,095 --> 01:02:10,775
Speaker 4:  show notes you should look at. It is just, you get a brief look at it closed

1090
01:02:10,775 --> 01:02:14,215
Speaker 4:  and then a brief look at it open and it's like very thin and very cool and

1091
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:18,195
Speaker 4:  very futuristic. I have lots of questions. Yep. What about

1092
01:02:18,195 --> 01:02:20,830
Speaker 4:  creases? What if instead of one crease, you had two creases, wouldn't that

1093
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:21,885
Speaker 4:  be so fun? Probably not

1094
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:26,845
Speaker 3:  The big disagree. The definitely sells a crease TCL. We love an

1095
01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:28,685
Speaker 3:  ePaper phone. Apparently it's

1096
01:02:28,685 --> 01:02:29,245
Speaker 6:  Not ink

1097
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:31,685
Speaker 3:  Here in the B Palma fan club.

1098
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:33,365
Speaker 4:  Welcome. Yeah.

1099
01:02:33,385 --> 01:02:36,085
Speaker 3:  All Kranz. This is just your segment. What I know, I'm so

1100
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:36,245
Speaker 6:  Happy.

1101
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:39,725
Speaker 3:  What kind wacky, inefficient display technology do we have here?

1102
01:02:39,795 --> 01:02:40,285
Speaker 3:  They're

1103
01:02:40,285 --> 01:02:43,005
Speaker 6:  They're not the only ones doing this. Like a whole bunch of people at EFA

1104
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:46,965
Speaker 6:  this year are like, we're doing Color E ink. And you're like, are you?

1105
01:02:46,965 --> 01:02:50,245
Speaker 6:  And they're like, we're doing electronic paper. And you're like, okay, is

1106
01:02:50,245 --> 01:02:54,125
Speaker 6:  that just an LCD and you took the light out? And they're like, yes. That's,

1107
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:57,805
Speaker 6:  that's that's what it is. Yeah. With next paper.

1108
01:02:57,835 --> 01:03:00,765
Speaker 6:  Next paper always loves to call it that All they're doing is putting a mat

1109
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:04,525
Speaker 6:  finish on the display. That's about it. In this case

1110
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:08,405
Speaker 6:  there's a button and the button will turn everything monochrome and make

1111
01:03:08,405 --> 01:03:09,685
Speaker 6:  it look more like a book's Palmer.

1112
01:03:09,795 --> 01:03:12,325
Speaker 4:  Wait, but Alex, you, you forgot the best part. What is, what is the button?

1113
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,645
Speaker 4:  What is the mode? The button engages.

1114
01:03:14,915 --> 01:03:17,445
Speaker 6:  It's like maximum E Ink. Right? Maximum

1115
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:18,325
Speaker 4:  Ink. It's Max ink mode.

1116
01:03:18,905 --> 01:03:19,805
Speaker 3:  Max ink mode.

1117
01:03:20,065 --> 01:03:20,925
Speaker 4:  Max ink mode.

1118
01:03:22,815 --> 01:03:25,645
Speaker 4:  Don't gimme regular amounts of ink. Give me max ink.

1119
01:03:26,105 --> 01:03:29,925
Speaker 6:  But then there's no ink at all. It's fine. I'm fine with it.

1120
01:03:29,925 --> 01:03:33,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But, but yeah, TCL L's been doing

1121
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:37,325
Speaker 6:  this next paper thing for five years now and it's,

1122
01:03:37,475 --> 01:03:39,685
Speaker 6:  it's, it's not fancy. This

1123
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:43,525
Speaker 3:  Is their moment. We the, the B Palma finally kicked the door down

1124
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:47,245
Speaker 3:  and it, now the next cycle is everyone's gonna have a Max Ink mode phone.

1125
01:03:47,345 --> 01:03:47,805
Speaker 3:  But you are,

1126
01:03:47,805 --> 01:03:51,045
Speaker 6:  You are seeing like, like I heard it when I spoke with the folks at Remarkable.

1127
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:55,285
Speaker 6:  We're seeing it in a lot of the announcements out of IFA. This idea of of

1128
01:03:55,285 --> 01:03:59,205
Speaker 6:  drawing our attention away from the screen and and doing, doing a dumber

1129
01:03:59,205 --> 01:04:02,565
Speaker 6:  screen. A a a simpler screen is is really

1130
01:04:03,245 --> 01:04:03,845
Speaker 6:  starting to take off.

1131
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:07,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's ever and it iss funny 'cause the iPhone is like what If you screen

1132
01:04:07,265 --> 01:04:11,245
Speaker 3:  was alive. Yeah. It's trying to bang you and then everyone

1133
01:04:11,245 --> 01:04:14,405
Speaker 3:  else is like, what if it looked more like paper? And I'm not sure how that,

1134
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:17,385
Speaker 3:  those are two very different directions to Yeah.

1135
01:04:17,385 --> 01:04:20,985
Speaker 6:  I don't think they're ever gonna meet up. I don't, I think what's gonna happen

1136
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:23,985
Speaker 6:  is a bunch of old people are gonna get e ink stuff and a bunch of young people

1137
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:27,705
Speaker 6:  are gonna get the phones that bang you. I got real ageist there.

1138
01:04:28,145 --> 01:04:30,025
Speaker 6:  I don't know where I am on that spectrum yet.

1139
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:33,985
Speaker 3:  I would say, my instinct is that recent history is that it's actually old

1140
01:04:34,055 --> 01:04:36,745
Speaker 3:  half weird relationships with technology. But we'll see how that goes. This

1141
01:04:36,775 --> 01:04:40,105
Speaker 3:  this is true. Alright, one last gadget in this section and we should talk

1142
01:04:40,105 --> 01:04:43,945
Speaker 3:  about the wave of lunar lake laptops that just hit, this is my

1143
01:04:44,065 --> 01:04:47,785
Speaker 3:  favorite one of all of efa. It is DGI has a new selfie drone.

1144
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:51,265
Speaker 3:  It's $190. It's called the neo You can launch it from the pond of your hand.

1145
01:04:51,615 --> 01:04:55,545
Speaker 3:  4K 30 You can do pre-programmed stuff. Thomas Kar has a video of it hitting

1146
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:59,505
Speaker 3:  a tree and staying alive and completing its little pre-programmed. Do a circle

1147
01:04:59,505 --> 01:05:03,385
Speaker 3:  around me, flight path, all that's whatever. Great. I mean I'm, I'm a

1148
01:05:03,385 --> 01:05:07,145
Speaker 3:  sucker for these. I will probably buy one but it has

1149
01:05:07,835 --> 01:05:11,625
Speaker 3:  voice controls and the voice. The act,

1150
01:05:11,765 --> 01:05:15,705
Speaker 3:  the, the wake word for the voice controls is, hey fly.

1151
01:05:21,905 --> 01:05:24,405
Speaker 6:  That's what my brother said to a hamster one time before he threw it.

1152
01:05:24,685 --> 01:05:27,765
Speaker 3:  I just love the idea that, and it's really small so like to, there's a photo

1153
01:05:27,765 --> 01:05:31,005
Speaker 3:  of Thomas putting it in his pocket and the idea that you're gonna pull out

1154
01:05:31,005 --> 01:05:33,805
Speaker 3:  a drone for your pocket, hold it out and be like, hey fly and it's gonna

1155
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:37,445
Speaker 3:  take off and like do a a 360 around you. This is all I've ever wanted from

1156
01:05:37,445 --> 01:05:41,325
Speaker 3:  technology. I dunno if it's gonna work, you know, we gotta see it.

1157
01:05:41,915 --> 01:05:44,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But I love that. That's the wake word they chose.

1158
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:47,925
Speaker 4:  It's very good. And I, I appreciate like Thomas wrote it as if

1159
01:05:48,105 --> 01:05:51,525
Speaker 4:  it is, it's two separate sentences. It's like you're, you're, you point at

1160
01:05:51,525 --> 01:05:53,405
Speaker 4:  it and you go, hey fly.

1161
01:05:55,115 --> 01:05:58,485
Speaker 4:  Like you're just, you are demanding that it fly and I love that.

1162
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:03,565
Speaker 3:  Very confusing. Of course it's DGI, so it's a drone itself is is

1163
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:07,485
Speaker 3:  1 99, but then you gotta buy the battery thing and the the

1164
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:09,525
Speaker 3:  handhold controller and you're gonna end up spending a lot of money. And

1165
01:06:09,525 --> 01:06:13,245
Speaker 3:  this happens to me every two years on the dot. And then I use the

1166
01:06:13,245 --> 01:06:15,165
Speaker 3:  thing twice and put it away. But that's life.

1167
01:06:15,235 --> 01:06:19,005
Speaker 4:  It's, it's so funny to me that this thing and the new GoPro launched in the

1168
01:06:19,005 --> 01:06:21,685
Speaker 4:  same week because I have the exact same opinion about both of them, which

1169
01:06:21,685 --> 01:06:24,765
Speaker 4:  is that no one cares. Yeah. There's this like small group of people they

1170
01:06:24,765 --> 01:06:27,845
Speaker 4:  have already hit whatever product market fit they're ever going to find.

1171
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:31,405
Speaker 4:  and we had this idea that action cameras were gonna be a mainstream thing

1172
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:34,005
Speaker 4:  and then we had this idea that drones are gonna be a mainstream thing and

1173
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:37,485
Speaker 4:  they just aren't. And that's okay. And I think this one will be fun because

1174
01:06:37,485 --> 01:06:41,405
Speaker 4:  it's $200 and it seems to be very easy and very resilient. So like if,

1175
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:43,845
Speaker 4:  if there's ever going to be a new group of people who buys these,

1176
01:06:44,705 --> 01:06:47,325
Speaker 3:  The one Wait, I just want to, I just want to, I want to push back just ever

1177
01:06:47,345 --> 01:06:51,205
Speaker 3:  so gently on this. 'cause I, I broadly agree with you. I watch a lot of car

1178
01:06:51,205 --> 01:06:55,085
Speaker 3:  videos on YouTube and the presence of action cameras and drones that

1179
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:58,605
Speaker 3:  You can destroy has made car videos on YouTube infinitely better.

1180
01:06:59,065 --> 01:07:01,725
Speaker 3:  So I would just like to say, I think they should keep going.

1181
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:06,005
Speaker 4:  Oh, I think they should keep going also. But I think this idea that like,

1182
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:10,285
Speaker 4:  I mean this, this thing that DJI just shipped is, is the snap

1183
01:07:10,455 --> 01:07:14,445
Speaker 4:  pixie? Yeah. Like it just is that, but it works with not Snapchat and

1184
01:07:14,515 --> 01:07:18,485
Speaker 4:  thus we'll be more successful. But like there's this idea that, oh

1185
01:07:18,485 --> 01:07:22,325
Speaker 4:  if we just make a a little flying selfie camera, easy

1186
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:24,525
Speaker 4:  to use, everybody will want it. Just not true.

1187
01:07:24,755 --> 01:07:27,685
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Especially there's just like, imagine, I don't know,

1188
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:31,885
Speaker 3:  Lollapalooza with 15,000 people at the Chapel run show being like, hey

1189
01:07:31,985 --> 01:07:32,205
Speaker 3:  fly

1190
01:07:34,305 --> 01:07:34,645
Speaker 6:  At once.

1191
01:07:36,665 --> 01:07:40,325
Speaker 6:  You just hear the v as all those little engines take off.

1192
01:07:40,865 --> 01:07:41,085
Speaker 4:  No,

1193
01:07:41,325 --> 01:07:44,925
Speaker 3:  I hope it does. And I hope So I hope they pay some artist to write a song

1194
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:48,685
Speaker 3:  called hey fly with for the drone. It's my dream. All right.

1195
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:52,885
Speaker 3:  Lunar lake. So there just to color in Lunar lake a little bit, this is Intel's

1196
01:07:52,885 --> 01:07:56,845
Speaker 3:  newest laptop chip. They need to compete with windows going on arm and the

1197
01:07:56,845 --> 01:08:00,685
Speaker 3:  new Qualcomm chips, the A IPC that Qualcomm is doing. There's a lot of

1198
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:03,885
Speaker 3:  color about Intel, which is having its struggles lately. That most important

1199
01:08:04,005 --> 01:08:07,965
Speaker 3:  thing to know is that I think Lunar Lake is being made by TSMC. Like

1200
01:08:07,965 --> 01:08:10,725
Speaker 3:  Intel isn't making their own chip, which is a big deal.

1201
01:08:12,215 --> 01:08:15,845
Speaker 3:  Like just a huge monumental deal. But like, here's the next wave of these

1202
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:20,445
Speaker 3:  laptops. They have big promises about battery life and performance obviously

1203
01:08:20,445 --> 01:08:23,365
Speaker 3:  and performance per what? But the reason is 'cause someone else is making

1204
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,845
Speaker 3:  the chips on the pro on the, on the most advanced process node. So it just

1205
01:08:26,925 --> 01:08:30,085
Speaker 3:  a weird, these are like historical computers.

1206
01:08:30,805 --> 01:08:33,725
Speaker 3:  'cause they're the ones that might signal like the end of Intel as we know

1207
01:08:33,725 --> 01:08:33,845
Speaker 3:  it.

1208
01:08:34,315 --> 01:08:34,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1209
01:08:35,535 --> 01:08:39,365
Speaker 3:  Weird. And then I just need to point out the Lenovo auto Twist

1210
01:08:39,665 --> 01:08:42,685
Speaker 3:  AI PC is a motorized two in one.

1211
01:08:43,435 --> 01:08:46,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Wait, I still, I'm looking at a picture of this thing and I still don't

1212
01:08:46,285 --> 01:08:47,045
Speaker 4:  understand how it works.

1213
01:08:48,045 --> 01:08:52,005
Speaker 3:  I think Lenovo was like, well we've already put one gimmick in here with

1214
01:08:52,105 --> 01:08:53,885
Speaker 3:  ai. What about a second gimmick?

1215
01:08:54,945 --> 01:08:58,885
Speaker 6:  Lenovo just likes to see what they can do. Lenovo loves a gimmick sometimes,

1216
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,645
Speaker 6:  especially for a big show. Oh

1217
01:09:00,995 --> 01:09:04,965
Speaker 4:  Wait, so this is basically like apple's center stage

1218
01:09:04,965 --> 01:09:07,685
Speaker 4:  thing where the camera will follow you but it's for the whole screen. Yeah,

1219
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:07,965
Speaker 4:  the whole

1220
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:11,885
Speaker 3:  Screen just like spins around on the base looking at you with

1221
01:09:11,925 --> 01:09:13,165
Speaker 3:  a, with the power of ai.

1222
01:09:13,225 --> 01:09:16,925
Speaker 4:  Oh man. Okay. Now what needs to happen is Razor needs to make

1223
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:21,045
Speaker 4:  a circular treadmill desk that you just walk around all day

1224
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:23,885
Speaker 4:  while your screen slowly follows you in circles.

1225
01:09:25,105 --> 01:09:26,445
Speaker 4:  And then everyone will, if

1226
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:29,085
Speaker 6:  The treadmill also charges the screen Now we're

1227
01:09:29,085 --> 01:09:30,605
Speaker 4:  Talking. Yeah. Not Yeah. Hell yeah. Yeah.

1228
01:09:30,825 --> 01:09:33,805
Speaker 3:  So our, our folks spent time with it. And I just wanna read this sentence.

1229
01:09:34,145 --> 01:09:37,525
Speaker 3:  The concept unit responded to voice commands within a second or two,

1230
01:09:38,145 --> 01:09:41,645
Speaker 3:  but the motors are slow. Taking about 10 seconds to transform

1231
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:45,565
Speaker 6:  If. you watch the vi the video is just like, it's so slow. You're like

1232
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,405
Speaker 6:  Sure. Yeah. Thanks Lenovo.

1233
01:09:48,665 --> 01:09:51,605
Speaker 3:  All right. And then Acer had a couple as well, right? Alex, what's going

1234
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:51,885
Speaker 3:  on? These

1235
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:55,685
Speaker 6:  They have one that's called project Dual play Of course. And Acer I love

1236
01:09:55,685 --> 01:09:59,125
Speaker 6:  because I always forget that they're like, they make okay laptops, they make

1237
01:09:59,745 --> 01:10:03,685
Speaker 6:  really wild gaming laptops. And this one has just got like a controller

1238
01:10:03,685 --> 01:10:03,885
Speaker 6:  in it.

1239
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:05,885
Speaker 3:  No, sure. Like you do.

1240
01:10:06,595 --> 01:10:10,005
Speaker 4:  It's not even Alex, you're not even doing it justice. Imagine if

1241
01:10:10,505 --> 01:10:14,445
Speaker 4:  the track pad underneath your keyboard on your laptop just

1242
01:10:14,445 --> 01:10:18,405
Speaker 4:  popped out and became a game controller. Yes. That rules

1243
01:10:18,595 --> 01:10:22,565
Speaker 4:  dude. Like no notes on that idea. I love it. So I feel

1244
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:25,405
Speaker 4:  like so much. Where do the joysticks go? What do you do with the buttons

1245
01:10:25,405 --> 01:10:26,285
Speaker 4:  when it's docked? I have a lot of

1246
01:10:26,605 --> 01:10:29,725
Speaker 3:  Questions. There are no pictures of this thing with the controller docked

1247
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,845
Speaker 3:  is the mouse. Yeah. I don't

1248
01:10:30,845 --> 01:10:31,245
Speaker 4:  Understand it.

1249
01:10:31,425 --> 01:10:33,925
Speaker 3:  How thick is it? How it happens? If, you need to use a mouse

1250
01:10:35,255 --> 01:10:36,085
Speaker 3:  while gaming.

1251
01:10:36,705 --> 01:10:38,915
Speaker 6:  You don't, you just keep going.

1252
01:10:39,995 --> 01:10:42,035
Speaker 3:  I guess the middle of the controller is still a track pad.

1253
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:46,395
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I But again amazing. I love it. No, no, it's,

1254
01:10:46,395 --> 01:10:49,195
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's, it's my favorite thing that's happened. I kept thinking how to

1255
01:10:49,195 --> 01:10:49,355
Speaker 6:  display.

1256
01:10:49,355 --> 01:10:52,155
Speaker 3:  Display The top of the keyboard releases a controller and causes two five

1257
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:56,155
Speaker 3:  watt speakers to pop out from the sides of the laptop. Oh, I thought there

1258
01:10:56,815 --> 01:10:57,515
Speaker 3:  PC card slots.

1259
01:10:58,225 --> 01:11:01,275
Speaker 4:  They're little, they they look like little handles that you would grab.

1260
01:11:01,385 --> 01:11:03,075
Speaker 3:  This is great. I would buy this tomorrow but this thing has to be

1261
01:11:03,615 --> 01:11:04,355
Speaker 6:  Be so thick.

1262
01:11:05,175 --> 01:11:06,555
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah. I don't, that's not the point.

1263
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:07,475
Speaker 6:  I know.

1264
01:11:07,895 --> 01:11:11,195
Speaker 3:  The point is that when you take out the game controller built into the keyboard

1265
01:11:11,345 --> 01:11:14,885
Speaker 3:  deck, two little speakers pop out and RGB lights light up. I

1266
01:11:14,885 --> 01:11:18,645
Speaker 6:  Hope they go p when they do it. I wanna see the person playing this at

1267
01:11:18,925 --> 01:11:19,165
Speaker 6:  Starbucks.

1268
01:11:20,285 --> 01:11:20,575
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

1269
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,375
Speaker 6:  This great. Leaving their whole tower behind. They're ringing this thing,

1270
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:24,855
Speaker 6:  they're playing Fortnite with their friend.

1271
01:11:25,605 --> 01:11:28,415
Speaker 3:  Okay. And then here I just wanna end with talking about Intel and Qualcomm

1272
01:11:28,515 --> 01:11:32,495
Speaker 3:  one one more time. Yeah. Acer announced a bunch of 14 inch laptops. Some

1273
01:11:32,495 --> 01:11:36,135
Speaker 3:  have Lunar Lake, some have the new Snap track and X some have the A MD rise

1274
01:11:36,135 --> 01:11:40,095
Speaker 3:  in AI 300, which is quite a name it claims all of them

1275
01:11:40,285 --> 01:11:41,735
Speaker 3:  have 24 hours of battery life.

1276
01:11:42,235 --> 01:11:44,975
Speaker 6:  That's not surprising, right? Do

1277
01:11:44,975 --> 01:11:45,535
Speaker 3:  You believe this?

1278
01:11:46,275 --> 01:11:50,215
Speaker 4:  No big battery life has been like one of the ongoing claims at

1279
01:11:50,355 --> 01:11:53,655
Speaker 4:  efa. Like Dell has said it's battery life is getting better with all these

1280
01:11:53,655 --> 01:11:57,495
Speaker 4:  things. Like if this is true, it's awesome, right?

1281
01:11:57,495 --> 01:12:01,295
Speaker 4:  Like if, if we're gonna get to the point where all of these things do these

1282
01:12:01,295 --> 01:12:05,215
Speaker 4:  like table stakes things very well, but then in Intel, Qualcomm and a MD

1283
01:12:05,215 --> 01:12:07,495
Speaker 4:  get to compete and sort of do the different things that each of them does.

1284
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:10,415
Speaker 4:  Well that's amazing. I have

1285
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:14,495
Speaker 4:  absolutely zero reason to believe that that is actually the case. Yeah.

1286
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:17,575
Speaker 3:  I also wanna point out that these claims are fundamentally unmeasurable.

1287
01:12:18,675 --> 01:12:22,535
Speaker 3:  So for the Intel Swift AI laptop, it's the quote

1288
01:12:22,535 --> 01:12:26,415
Speaker 3:  is 29 hours of video playback, 23 hours of web browsing. The

1289
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:30,095
Speaker 3:  A MD is 19 hours of web browsing, 27 hours of video playback. And the Qualcomm

1290
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:32,975
Speaker 3:  one is 19 and a half hours of web browsing and 28 hours of video playback.

1291
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:37,415
Speaker 3:  I'm just pointing out this requires someone to watch videos for over

1292
01:12:37,615 --> 01:12:41,495
Speaker 3:  a full day on three different computers and or browse the web for

1293
01:12:41,495 --> 01:12:44,895
Speaker 3:  nearly a full day. And I don't, I am very

1294
01:12:44,925 --> 01:12:46,335
Speaker 3:  motivated to test these claims.

1295
01:12:46,765 --> 01:12:48,535
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Well also I think probably, I

1296
01:12:48,545 --> 01:12:51,335
Speaker 3:  Dunno if I can do it without breaking the labor law of the United States.

1297
01:12:51,855 --> 01:12:52,775
Speaker 6:  I, I suspect in

1298
01:12:52,775 --> 01:12:54,095
Speaker 3:  Some kind of clockwork or situation.

1299
01:12:54,255 --> 01:12:57,255
Speaker 6:  No, you use a GoPro. I used to have to do these tests and we would just point

1300
01:12:57,295 --> 01:13:00,895
Speaker 6:  a GoPro at it and then the next morning come in and like be like, okay, let's

1301
01:13:00,895 --> 01:13:04,735
Speaker 6:  see if it recorded it and sometimes it didn't and you're like, okay, I guess

1302
01:13:04,735 --> 01:13:08,495
Speaker 6:  I test again. This will be fun. Let's chart fast. This

1303
01:13:08,495 --> 01:13:10,015
Speaker 3:  Is the market for GoPros David. Yeah.

1304
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:10,495
Speaker 6:  That's the market.

1305
01:13:10,495 --> 01:13:12,335
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You scream, hey fly and then it,

1306
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:14,935
Speaker 6:  You just stares at a computer

1307
01:13:14,935 --> 01:13:15,735
Speaker 4:  Covers and watches

1308
01:13:16,115 --> 01:13:18,855
Speaker 3:  Top doing a video playback, I don't even know, 24 hours of video playback

1309
01:13:18,855 --> 01:13:20,935
Speaker 3:  as a useful stat for anyone in the world.

1310
01:13:21,935 --> 01:13:25,895
Speaker 6:  I think it was once and I think there was a lot of reviewing reviewers who

1311
01:13:25,895 --> 01:13:29,095
Speaker 6:  were using video playback as like the primary way to do battery testing

1312
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:33,855
Speaker 6:  for a very long time. And so like but also 24 hours

1313
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:38,015
Speaker 6:  isn't a lot nowadays. Like given the size of these batteries. Yeah. These

1314
01:13:38,275 --> 01:13:42,115
Speaker 6:  things should be able to like do this. It

1315
01:13:42,115 --> 01:13:45,075
Speaker 6:  should be relatively easy for them to do this if they put a big enough battery

1316
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:45,835
Speaker 6:  in the laptop.

1317
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:50,235
Speaker 3:  No, IIII and I, I certainly understand why in the beginning when video

1318
01:13:50,515 --> 01:13:52,515
Speaker 3:  playbook was like particularly chip

1319
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:53,675
Speaker 6:  Bound hard. Yeah, it makes sense.

1320
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:57,115
Speaker 3:  It was hard to do. So it was like a very heavy task. All video playback now

1321
01:13:57,115 --> 01:14:00,635
Speaker 3:  on these, on these computers is being routed to an ultra efficient,

1322
01:14:00,635 --> 01:14:03,915
Speaker 3:  specialized part of a chip that is doing it for almost no power. Yep.

1323
01:14:03,915 --> 01:14:07,715
Speaker 4:  Well the only reason they're useful is because they're apples to

1324
01:14:07,715 --> 01:14:10,875
Speaker 4:  apples. Right. Like thi this is a thing we've dealt with for forever for

1325
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:14,685
Speaker 4:  like as long as The Verge has existed. How do we benchmark battery

1326
01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:18,605
Speaker 4:  life in a way that is both real and actually

1327
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:22,605
Speaker 4:  like objective apples to apples. It's impossible. You can't do it. There's

1328
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:24,765
Speaker 4:  just no way. So you have to do the thing where you're like, I ran this test

1329
01:14:24,765 --> 01:14:28,685
Speaker 4:  that doesn't mean anything but is at least one-to-one and then I

1330
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:31,925
Speaker 4:  just use it like a person and try to report battery life. Yes. This is

1331
01:14:32,645 --> 01:14:33,525
Speaker 4:  a thing that does that If you

1332
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:36,685
Speaker 3:  Have ever angrily commented in one of our laptop reviews about why we continue

1333
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:40,165
Speaker 3:  to play shadow of the Tomb Raider. It is exactly for this reason.

1334
01:14:40,195 --> 01:14:43,965
Speaker 3:  Totally. It's just, we, we just picked a game and that's the game. That's

1335
01:14:43,965 --> 01:14:47,325
Speaker 3:  it works on everything Monica picked quite honestly, Monica shouldn't pick

1336
01:14:47,325 --> 01:14:50,565
Speaker 3:  that game. And now we're gonna play shadow of the Tomb Raider a couple times

1337
01:14:50,685 --> 01:14:51,925
Speaker 3:  a year for the rest of our lives.

1338
01:14:52,185 --> 01:14:55,685
Speaker 6:  It had some challenging like graphic

1339
01:14:55,895 --> 01:14:59,845
Speaker 6:  stuff. There was like the tres locks, the res the

1340
01:14:59,845 --> 01:15:00,445
Speaker 6:  hair, yeah.

1341
01:15:30,285 --> 01:15:30,565
Speaker 6:  it is,

1342
01:15:31,035 --> 01:15:32,285
Speaker 3:  It's actually worse than Intel on

1343
01:16:40,645 --> 01:16:41,765
Speaker 3:  I don't know what happens next.

1344
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:42,605
Speaker 6:  Well they're trying to

1345
01:20:08,235 --> 01:20:12,165
Speaker 3:  Fios was not its future. Sold off a bunch of Fios assets and customers embed

1346
01:20:12,165 --> 01:20:14,965
Speaker 3:  everything on little technology we like to call 5G,

1347
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:19,045
Speaker 3:  which you will recall was supposed to enable everything from robot surgery,

1348
01:20:19,765 --> 01:20:23,605
Speaker 3:  which never happened to self-driving cars, which only happened in two cities

1349
01:20:23,605 --> 01:20:27,485
Speaker 3:  with no 5G involved to you just name it, you just name it. Remember remember

1350
01:20:27,485 --> 01:20:31,365
Speaker 3:  5G by the way, the, the camera button on the iPhone 16 pro,

1351
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:34,285
Speaker 3:  it's supposed to be where the millimeter wave in 10 is right now.

1352
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:36,565
Speaker 4:  Perfect.

1353
01:20:36,885 --> 01:20:38,925
Speaker 3:  I don't know where the millimeter wave is gonna go or if it's even gonna

1354
01:20:38,925 --> 01:20:42,205
Speaker 3:  still be there, but do you remember all this? Sure do. Yeah.

1355
01:20:42,975 --> 01:20:46,925
Speaker 3:  Turns out 5G accomplish nothing. And now Verizon is gonna

1356
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:50,525
Speaker 3:  spend $20 billion to buy Frontier,

1357
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:55,285
Speaker 3:  which it sold a bunch of F assets to Hans Vesper. The CEO of

1358
01:20:55,395 --> 01:20:58,805
Speaker 3:  Verizon says the acquisition of Frontier is a strategic fit. It'll build

1359
01:20:58,805 --> 01:21:01,965
Speaker 3:  on Verizon's two decades of leadership at the forefront of fiber. And it's

1360
01:21:01,965 --> 01:21:04,925
Speaker 3:  an opportunity to become competitive in more markets in the United States.

1361
01:21:04,925 --> 01:21:08,285
Speaker 3:  The two decades of leadership were building the network. It sold the frontier

1362
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:09,965
Speaker 3:  and is now buying again. Yeah,

1363
01:21:10,705 --> 01:21:14,525
Speaker 4:  So, so Verizon was like what if

1364
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:18,125
Speaker 4:  really fast wired internet was not important and then

1365
01:21:19,845 --> 01:21:23,325
Speaker 4:  realized a decade later that very fast wired internet is actually like pretty

1366
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:23,725
Speaker 4:  important.

1367
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:27,445
Speaker 3:  But India, they're an investor at our parent company Box media. I am often

1368
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:31,725
Speaker 3:  accused of being hopelessly biased in favor of wired

1369
01:21:31,725 --> 01:21:35,525
Speaker 3:  connections. It comes up on the show a lot that I think wired

1370
01:21:35,525 --> 01:21:39,165
Speaker 3:  connections are good and reliable. Headphones for example, as

1371
01:21:39,365 --> 01:21:41,445
Speaker 3:  Alex painfully brought up earlier,

1372
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:45,485
Speaker 4:  I think two of the official stances of The Vergecast are, are more buttons

1373
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:48,085
Speaker 4:  are better and plug it in. Yeah, it'll be fine. Yeah.

1374
01:21:48,085 --> 01:21:51,405
Speaker 3:  Wire connections are better than wireless ones. Yeah. Yeah. When I covered

1375
01:21:51,405 --> 01:21:54,045
Speaker 3:  starlink, I was accused of being in the pocket of Bing, Comcast. 'cause I

1376
01:21:54,045 --> 01:21:57,485
Speaker 3:  pointed out that wired ethernet is more liable than sending

1377
01:21:58,165 --> 01:22:01,645
Speaker 3:  internet to space, which seems obvious on space.

1378
01:22:02,185 --> 01:22:02,405
Speaker 3:  Big

1379
01:22:02,405 --> 01:22:03,285
Speaker 4:  Comcast. Gotcha.

1380
01:22:04,195 --> 01:22:08,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Right. So I basically Verizon was like all in on its

1381
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:11,085
Speaker 3:  own 5G bet high in its own supply. They thought this was gonna do whatever

1382
01:22:11,085 --> 01:22:13,485
Speaker 3:  it was gonna do and they started selling off these assets because they thought

1383
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:16,965
Speaker 3:  they weren't durable. And the reality is over and over and over again

1384
01:22:17,275 --> 01:22:20,845
Speaker 3:  that in particular wired internet connections are what people want.

1385
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:24,685
Speaker 3:  Like pe If, you give people the choice between some

1386
01:22:25,025 --> 01:22:25,445
Speaker 3:  weirdo

1387
01:22:27,205 --> 01:22:30,685
Speaker 3:  wireless line of sight, ir tin can

1388
01:22:31,565 --> 01:22:35,005
Speaker 3:  internet connection or like fiber to their house. They will always pick the

1389
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:38,965
Speaker 3:  fiber. And so it's just been more durable over time and it doesn't, I don't

1390
01:22:38,965 --> 01:22:42,525
Speaker 3:  think that actually is a knock on 5G. Like I know

1391
01:22:42,615 --> 01:22:45,005
Speaker 3:  we're gonna get emails 'cause we always get emails people, a lot of people

1392
01:22:45,005 --> 01:22:48,005
Speaker 3:  have like 5G home internet connections now. Yeah. Because they have no access

1393
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:50,765
Speaker 3:  to the other thing and the 5G Home internet connection is an upgrade. It's

1394
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:50,885
Speaker 3:  the same

1395
01:22:50,885 --> 01:22:53,765
Speaker 4:  Thing with Starlink If you had, if your options are nothing and Starlink

1396
01:22:53,925 --> 01:22:54,645
Speaker 4:  starlink is great,

1397
01:22:54,705 --> 01:22:58,165
Speaker 3:  But if your options are starlink or 5G Home, internet or fiber,

1398
01:22:59,245 --> 01:23:02,765
Speaker 3:  a lot of people pick the fiber and the fiber is really useful. So it's just

1399
01:23:02,765 --> 01:23:05,685
Speaker 3:  like Verizon just got high and it's UNP supply and it, it's spending $20

1400
01:23:05,685 --> 01:23:06,165
Speaker 3:  billion to go a circle.

1401
01:23:06,345 --> 01:23:09,405
Speaker 4:  You know what's nuts? This is, this is a total tangent that we shouldn't

1402
01:23:09,405 --> 01:23:12,365
Speaker 4:  go down, but just a thing I realized as you were explaining that is like

1403
01:23:12,505 --> 01:23:15,525
Speaker 4:  you just described what's happening to the whole tech industry and AI right

1404
01:23:15,525 --> 01:23:18,325
Speaker 4:  now. Yeah. Everybody's like, what if we threw away everything we were good

1405
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:21,845
Speaker 4:  at because AI is going to change everything about everything forever. And

1406
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:24,285
Speaker 4:  it's like, you wanna know, you wanna know what happens when it doesn't Is

1407
01:23:24,635 --> 01:23:28,605
Speaker 4:  this, you spend $20 billion to undo

1408
01:23:28,745 --> 01:23:30,605
Speaker 4:  your own weird ideas about

1409
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:34,485
Speaker 3:  Future. They, they sold these customers to Frontier in 2015 for 10

1410
01:23:34,485 --> 01:23:37,525
Speaker 3:  and a half billion dollars and it's rebuying them for $20 billion. Frontier

1411
01:23:37,525 --> 01:23:38,605
Speaker 3:  made outta abandoned. Yeah.

1412
01:23:38,885 --> 01:23:42,605
Speaker 6:  I mean did did they go bankrupt in the interim there and then have to go

1413
01:23:42,745 --> 01:23:43,805
Speaker 6:  do a whole restructuring?

1414
01:23:44,515 --> 01:23:44,805
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1415
01:23:44,805 --> 01:23:47,085
Speaker 4:  Who, who among us hasn't gone bankrupt at one point or another? Yeah.

1416
01:23:47,175 --> 01:23:50,405
Speaker 3:  Especially If you, especially if you're a cable company, CEO, this is just

1417
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:54,245
Speaker 3:  like what you do. Yeah, this is true. I you're sending the bankruptcy forms

1418
01:23:54,245 --> 01:23:57,845
Speaker 3:  from your yacht, you know, you're, you're fine. Alright Dave, what's yours?

1419
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:02,765
Speaker 4:  I just wanna talk briefly about Snapchat. So

1420
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:06,565
Speaker 4:  Alex Heath was on the show with me two weeks ago I

1421
01:24:07,305 --> 01:24:11,005
Speaker 4:  think. And one of the things he said was basically like Snapchat is

1422
01:24:11,075 --> 01:24:14,405
Speaker 4:  both more popular than ever and also maybe in more trouble as a business

1423
01:24:14,405 --> 01:24:18,365
Speaker 4:  than ever. And I think there is no better way to look at that

1424
01:24:19,085 --> 01:24:22,485
Speaker 4:  than a note Evan Spiegel posted on the company website that we reported

1425
01:24:23,275 --> 01:24:27,085
Speaker 4:  on that one of the things it's going to do is start putting ads in your

1426
01:24:27,135 --> 01:24:30,925
Speaker 4:  chat lists. Which to me is one of the things that has been

1427
01:24:31,075 --> 01:24:35,045
Speaker 4:  like untouchable in a messaging app forever. Like ads in

1428
01:24:35,045 --> 01:24:38,645
Speaker 4:  the messages and ads between the threads in my

1429
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:42,685
Speaker 4:  inbox have been two things that companies are very afraid of doing. Like

1430
01:24:42,685 --> 01:24:46,045
Speaker 4:  Google does it in your Gmail a little and everybody hates it and it sucks.

1431
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:50,365
Speaker 4:  But like Snap is about to start putting ads in your chats like

1432
01:24:50,715 --> 01:24:54,565
Speaker 4:  with your friends. And basically Evan Spiegel's reason for

1433
01:24:54,655 --> 01:24:58,325
Speaker 4:  doing it was like, our business is bad

1434
01:24:58,505 --> 01:25:02,485
Speaker 4:  and investors are mad at us about it. And it's just the whole thing, just

1435
01:25:02,485 --> 01:25:06,405
Speaker 4:  like reeks of desperation from Snapchat. And I just, I think that

1436
01:25:06,405 --> 01:25:10,085
Speaker 4:  is fascinating. Like this company is absolutely ubiquitous

1437
01:25:10,215 --> 01:25:13,685
Speaker 4:  among like a certain generation of internet users. It is everywhere

1438
01:25:14,575 --> 01:25:18,565
Speaker 4:  among like my, my high school age nephews. Like Snapchat is how

1439
01:25:18,565 --> 01:25:21,965
Speaker 4:  you live your life at that age right now. And yet this company just cannot

1440
01:25:21,965 --> 01:25:25,645
Speaker 4:  figure out how to make any money. Yeah. And it's, it's just a really, really

1441
01:25:25,645 --> 01:25:25,965
Speaker 4:  strange

1442
01:25:26,105 --> 01:25:30,045
Speaker 3:  And they can't do the one thing that they should do, which is charge a

1443
01:25:30,045 --> 01:25:31,005
Speaker 3:  fee. Right.

1444
01:25:31,035 --> 01:25:34,485
Speaker 4:  Because my nephews are 17 that they're not gonna do that.

1445
01:25:35,025 --> 01:25:38,245
Speaker 4:  And Evan Spiegel's quote is, the growth of our digital advertising business

1446
01:25:38,265 --> 01:25:41,525
Speaker 4:  is one of the most important inputs to our long-term revenue potential. And

1447
01:25:41,525 --> 01:25:45,405
Speaker 4:  investors are concerned that we aren't growing faster. Like if, if

1448
01:25:45,405 --> 01:25:49,045
Speaker 4:  you're a, if you're a CEO of a big tech company writing like a, here's why

1449
01:25:49,045 --> 01:25:52,845
Speaker 4:  we're doing a product thing, that's not what you say. And when you've gotten

1450
01:25:52,845 --> 01:25:56,645
Speaker 4:  to the point where that's what you have to say that like you, you are deep

1451
01:25:56,645 --> 01:25:57,685
Speaker 4:  down the road of like,

1452
01:25:58,635 --> 01:25:58,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

1453
01:25:59,115 --> 01:26:01,565
Speaker 4:  What choice do I have like this? That is where Snap is.

1454
01:26:02,175 --> 01:26:05,925
Speaker 3:  Yikes. Put Snap on the Go 90 Scale. The Go 90 scale of Doom

1455
01:26:05,925 --> 01:26:08,885
Speaker 3:  streaming services I understand is not about Snapchat but

1456
01:26:09,695 --> 01:26:10,885
Speaker 4:  We're very close. 75.

1457
01:26:11,035 --> 01:26:11,805
Speaker 3:  75.

1458
01:26:11,985 --> 01:26:15,285
Speaker 4:  Wow. I think, I think Snap Snapchat as its

1459
01:26:15,865 --> 01:26:19,725
Speaker 4:  own public company as is at, is at a

1460
01:26:19,725 --> 01:26:23,365
Speaker 4:  75. And I think if we were in a different world of

1461
01:26:23,675 --> 01:26:27,285
Speaker 4:  antitrust regulation and big tech questions, snap

1462
01:26:27,925 --> 01:26:29,645
Speaker 4:  probably would've been bought by somebody at this point.

1463
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:33,165
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah. Google would've bought and killed Snapchat by now. Within a heartbeat.

1464
01:26:33,435 --> 01:26:37,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So I. I think I'm 75 might be a little high, but

1465
01:26:37,195 --> 01:26:39,645
Speaker 4:  only because of like bigger macro reasons.

1466
01:26:40,545 --> 01:26:43,845
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna say 65 I think. I think it's so sticky.

1467
01:26:44,665 --> 01:26:48,445
Speaker 4:  It is so sticky. It's you like you cannot overstate how much people

1468
01:26:48,515 --> 01:26:49,725
Speaker 4:  love Snapchat. Yeah. But

1469
01:26:49,725 --> 01:26:52,885
Speaker 6:  It's only sticky for the people who actually use it and not enough people

1470
01:26:52,905 --> 01:26:53,885
Speaker 6:  use it. It's not growing.

1471
01:26:54,065 --> 01:26:57,325
Speaker 4:  No, but like tons of people use it. It's again, it is more popular than ever.

1472
01:26:57,395 --> 01:27:01,165
Speaker 4:  It's huge. It just can't make any money. Like this is, this to me is the

1473
01:27:01,165 --> 01:27:02,365
Speaker 4:  fun. Like, but it's not

1474
01:27:02,515 --> 01:27:04,365
Speaker 6:  That huge. Is it? Like how many people

1475
01:27:04,365 --> 01:27:07,285
Speaker 4:  Are using it? I think it's like 800 million. Like it's huge. Oh that is,

1476
01:27:07,285 --> 01:27:11,205
Speaker 4:  it is sufficiently large. It's just that teens sending

1477
01:27:11,205 --> 01:27:15,045
Speaker 4:  each other silly selfies is not a monetizable business

1478
01:27:15,045 --> 01:27:17,925
Speaker 4:  is that they're sending each other learning it. And so what they're gonna

1479
01:27:17,925 --> 01:27:18,605
Speaker 4:  do is they're gonna ruin

1480
01:27:18,605 --> 01:27:20,525
Speaker 3:  It. It all comes back to this idea, doesn't it Alex?

1481
01:27:20,805 --> 01:27:24,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The question now is basically for Snap is going to be how bad

1482
01:27:24,625 --> 01:27:28,325
Speaker 4:  can we make this before you leave? And that's like, that's a sad place for

1483
01:27:28,325 --> 01:27:30,885
Speaker 4:  a company to have to get to. and it really feels like that's where Snap has

1484
01:27:30,885 --> 01:27:31,605
Speaker 4:  gotten. Yeah.

1485
01:27:32,245 --> 01:27:35,125
Speaker 3:  I will say if they don't light up some kind of actual

1486
01:27:36,045 --> 01:27:39,485
Speaker 3:  subscription, it, they will be past

1487
01:27:39,655 --> 01:27:41,925
Speaker 3:  65 or 75 very quickly. I think they have to

1488
01:27:41,925 --> 01:27:44,485
Speaker 4:  Like charge 20. I mean there's, there's, you know, Snapchat plus is like,

1489
01:27:44,675 --> 01:27:48,605
Speaker 4:  it's a thing. Sure. But there there's never really

1490
01:27:48,605 --> 01:27:49,605
Speaker 4:  been any energy behind that.

1491
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:50,665
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1492
01:27:51,485 --> 01:27:52,625
Speaker 6:  Ugh. That's sad.

1493
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:54,185
Speaker 3:  All right. Kranz, what you got

1494
01:27:55,105 --> 01:27:59,025
Speaker 6:  Bringing on the sadness was Concord. Concord, you may have heard about it

1495
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:02,825
Speaker 6:  in the last eight years because it was this, it was gonna be a new live

1496
01:28:02,825 --> 01:28:06,665
Speaker 6:  service game from Sony and they spent over eight years making

1497
01:28:06,685 --> 01:28:09,945
Speaker 6:  it and then it came out and they've already pulled it within a month. Yeah.

1498
01:28:10,445 --> 01:28:14,145
Speaker 6:  and it coming out because just nobody was playing it. It hit at the wrong

1499
01:28:14,145 --> 01:28:16,865
Speaker 6:  time. It didn't have any of the cool features.

1500
01:28:17,855 --> 01:28:21,745
Speaker 6:  Like when it started, I don't think Fortnite and Pub Underground

1501
01:28:21,745 --> 01:28:25,225
Speaker 6:  were even really a thing for most people. And that's all happened

1502
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:29,975
Speaker 6:  since then. So it came out at the wrong time. It's been, it had a

1503
01:28:29,975 --> 01:28:33,775
Speaker 6:  disastrous launch and now it's been so

1504
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:34,375
Speaker 4:  Bad. Is it bad? Like

1505
01:28:34,725 --> 01:28:35,015
Speaker 6:  Just

1506
01:28:35,015 --> 01:28:36,415
Speaker 4:  Boring. What was the problem? Okay.

1507
01:28:36,475 --> 01:28:39,375
Speaker 6:  It was just boring. Yeah. and it was just like, there's been such a glut

1508
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:43,335
Speaker 6:  of these free to play live services video games. Everybody thought

1509
01:28:43,335 --> 01:28:46,455
Speaker 6:  that this was gonna be how they were gonna make all of their money. And over

1510
01:28:46,455 --> 01:28:49,935
Speaker 6:  time it's been like, oh wait, no. A few of 'em will do it and some will carve

1511
01:28:50,095 --> 01:28:53,735
Speaker 6:  out their little fiefdoms, some will be Fortnite, which, you know,

1512
01:28:54,055 --> 01:28:57,495
Speaker 6:  everyone under the age of 14 plays and otherwise it's like

1513
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,725
Speaker 6:  there's not a lot of room for this because there's a finite number of people

1514
01:29:01,745 --> 01:29:05,605
Speaker 6:  who wanna play video games and then that group gets smaller and smaller the

1515
01:29:05,605 --> 01:29:08,885
Speaker 6:  more specific the games are and then you need a lot of people to play it

1516
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:12,565
Speaker 6:  in order to make it interesting. And then this happens. Well,

1517
01:29:12,565 --> 01:29:16,325
Speaker 4:  But I also feel like it it, if I rewind a few years ago, the big

1518
01:29:16,355 --> 01:29:19,925
Speaker 4:  idea in the industry was like, okay, live service games are the thing

1519
01:29:20,585 --> 01:29:23,725
Speaker 4:  and what's gonna happen is, is the same thing that happens in the gaming

1520
01:29:24,005 --> 01:29:26,085
Speaker 4:  industry, right. There's gonna be a big one and then there's gonna be a next

1521
01:29:26,085 --> 01:29:28,205
Speaker 4:  big one and then there's gonna be a next big one and there's gonna be a next

1522
01:29:28,205 --> 01:29:31,565
Speaker 4:  big one. and it turns out like no there's, it's just gonna be Fortnite and

1523
01:29:31,565 --> 01:29:34,485
Speaker 4:  League of Legends the whole time. Yeah. And Minecraft is gonna keep being

1524
01:29:34,485 --> 01:29:38,165
Speaker 4:  huge and Roblox is gonna keep being like, it's, it's just been the same

1525
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:41,885
Speaker 4:  handful of giants for so long now.

1526
01:29:42,425 --> 01:29:46,285
Speaker 4:  And I like it is, it is astounding to me how big those games still are

1527
01:29:46,545 --> 01:29:49,325
Speaker 4:  and how much saying power they've had and it just feels like all these companies

1528
01:29:49,715 --> 01:29:53,485
Speaker 4:  made the right, they like bet on the right industry and were just

1529
01:29:53,485 --> 01:29:55,645
Speaker 4:  completely wrong about how it was gonna go. Yeah.

1530
01:29:55,955 --> 01:29:59,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. In this case they were just way too late. Like Concord eight years

1531
01:29:59,825 --> 01:30:03,045
Speaker 6:  in development for a live service

1532
01:30:03,735 --> 01:30:05,645
Speaker 6:  video game is just, that's way too long.

1533
01:30:05,825 --> 01:30:09,245
Speaker 4:  And also isn't the lesson from PUG just like ship your shitty game and it'll

1534
01:30:09,245 --> 01:30:09,805
Speaker 4:  be fine. Yeah.

1535
01:30:10,365 --> 01:30:11,365
Speaker 6:  Ship it and go sort of

1536
01:30:13,085 --> 01:30:16,925
Speaker 3:  Ship your game with an innovative new business model and a dynamic

1537
01:30:17,185 --> 01:30:19,845
Speaker 3:  new gameplay mechanic before anyone else and then you'll be fine.

1538
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:20,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah, sure.

1539
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:21,165
Speaker 6:  And then con

1540
01:30:21,395 --> 01:30:23,285
Speaker 3:  It's spend eight years doing this to not Yeah. That

1541
01:30:23,315 --> 01:30:23,965
Speaker 4:  That sounds as

1542
01:30:23,965 --> 01:30:25,445
Speaker 3:  Good as Fortnite is a different lesson, but

1543
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:29,525
Speaker 6:  It sounds like this may be like teaching, this may be that one of those learning

1544
01:30:29,525 --> 01:30:32,845
Speaker 6:  moments for the video game industry. They may be going, oh wait, we don't

1545
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:36,525
Speaker 6:  need to do this. But I mean, EA still exists so presumably we'll get

1546
01:30:36,725 --> 01:30:37,525
Speaker 6:  a ton more of these

1547
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:41,605
Speaker 3:  As someone who just bought the new Madden, which is so hard. Yeah.

1548
01:30:41,845 --> 01:30:44,885
Speaker 3:  I will say that no one's learning anything. I will say Sony, by the time

1549
01:30:44,885 --> 01:30:47,925
Speaker 3:  you're listen to this Astro bot will be out for the PS five. And that game

1550
01:30:47,925 --> 01:30:50,205
Speaker 3:  by all accounts looks to be the game of the year.

1551
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:51,565
Speaker 4:  People are obsessed with

1552
01:30:51,565 --> 01:30:52,565
Speaker 6:  With this game. They love

1553
01:30:52,565 --> 01:30:55,285
Speaker 3:  It. Yeah. I, I bought the control. I've been playing Astros playroom with

1554
01:30:55,285 --> 01:30:58,285
Speaker 3:  Max. Oh nice. And So I, we bought the controller because she's obsessed and

1555
01:30:58,285 --> 01:31:00,965
Speaker 3:  I'm very excited by this game. And it's like a totally different lesson.

1556
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:04,845
Speaker 3:  Like what If, you made a jewel like platformer with a lovable

1557
01:31:04,845 --> 01:31:07,605
Speaker 3:  character that had innovative gameplay mechanics, the

1558
01:31:07,605 --> 01:31:08,125
Speaker 6:  Nintendo

1559
01:31:09,205 --> 01:31:12,005
Speaker 3:  Playbook. Yeah. and it's a what if we made Mario again? And I understand

1560
01:31:12,005 --> 01:31:13,965
Speaker 3:  saying Make Mario again is like

1561
01:31:14,355 --> 01:31:16,765
Speaker 4:  Fine. Nobody ever thought of that. That's weird.

1562
01:31:16,865 --> 01:31:20,245
Speaker 3:  You thought of making Jurassic Park again exactly the way it was when I was

1563
01:31:20,245 --> 01:31:22,725
Speaker 3:  eight. That's gonna save the movie industry.

1564
01:31:24,265 --> 01:31:27,485
Speaker 3:  But it's funny that Sony is doing both things at the same time. Yeah. And

1565
01:31:27,545 --> 01:31:30,845
Speaker 3:  one of them is gonna be a way bigger hit than the other. Yeah. Yep. All right,

1566
01:31:30,845 --> 01:31:33,445
Speaker 3:  here's my last one. I just wanna call this out. We are deeply committed to

1567
01:31:33,645 --> 01:31:37,605
Speaker 3:  covering the Fedi verse and all things open social web. And this one is

1568
01:31:37,605 --> 01:31:40,725
Speaker 3:  very small, but I think it has glimmers of a big idea.

1569
01:31:41,445 --> 01:31:44,925
Speaker 3:  It's called Sub Club, it's from the company, it makes Mammoth, the Masson

1570
01:31:44,925 --> 01:31:48,885
Speaker 3:  client. It's paid social feeds. So

1571
01:31:49,105 --> 01:31:53,085
Speaker 3:  one of the things I think about all the time is people subscribe to on

1572
01:31:53,165 --> 01:31:56,725
Speaker 3:  a platform or four four media or all of our friends who have substack or

1573
01:31:56,725 --> 01:32:00,645
Speaker 3:  ghosts or whatever. And the way that that dynamic

1574
01:32:00,645 --> 01:32:03,245
Speaker 3:  usually works is the social media is the marketing to get you to subscribe

1575
01:32:03,245 --> 01:32:06,965
Speaker 3:  to a newsletter. But the social media is often the content, right? Like it's

1576
01:32:06,965 --> 01:32:10,685
Speaker 3:  the thing and no one has figured out how to like monetize a feed

1577
01:32:11,545 --> 01:32:15,485
Speaker 3:  at all. And you know, you like paid Twitter

1578
01:32:15,695 --> 01:32:18,285
Speaker 3:  posts like never took off like that. There was that button there and there's

1579
01:32:18,285 --> 01:32:22,205
Speaker 3:  some of this on some of the platforms, there's some kind of premium subscription

1580
01:32:22,205 --> 01:32:25,165
Speaker 3:  stuff, but none of it happens at scale. And certainly none of it supports

1581
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:28,805
Speaker 3:  anybody at scale. I think the idea of the open social

1582
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:32,325
Speaker 3:  internet interconnected, federated networks, having this built into them

1583
01:32:32,325 --> 01:32:33,685
Speaker 3:  from the beginning is super powerful.

1584
01:32:35,345 --> 01:32:38,165
Speaker 3:  And the idea that you subscribe to some creator and as part of it you get

1585
01:32:38,165 --> 01:32:40,805
Speaker 3:  authenticated into one of their feeds that You can subscribe to anywhere

1586
01:32:40,825 --> 01:32:44,205
Speaker 3:  as opposed to just on Twitter or just on YouTube or just on Instagram. That's

1587
01:32:44,205 --> 01:32:46,645
Speaker 3:  a big deal. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if this one's gonna go anywhere.

1588
01:32:46,705 --> 01:32:50,525
Speaker 3:  I'm exci. I'm just excited to see the ecosystem is starting to generate

1589
01:32:50,525 --> 01:32:54,485
Speaker 3:  these new ideas about what could you do if all of

1590
01:32:54,645 --> 01:32:58,605
Speaker 3:  these networks actually work together. And one of those ideas is like what

1591
01:32:58,605 --> 01:33:01,285
Speaker 3:  If you could pay creators directly and what you've got is also their social

1592
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:05,005
Speaker 3:  media and not just like links to this stuff that you pay for

1593
01:33:05,005 --> 01:33:06,045
Speaker 3:  somewhere else. Yeah.

1594
01:33:06,195 --> 01:33:09,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This ecosystem is like finally starting to productize in really exciting

1595
01:33:09,645 --> 01:33:12,405
Speaker 4:  ways. And like the other thing that launched this week was

1596
01:33:13,545 --> 01:33:17,525
Speaker 4:  reader, the RSS reader app. R-E-E-D-E-R. The guy who

1597
01:33:17,715 --> 01:33:21,565
Speaker 4:  made it, it's like the best RSS app that exists made

1598
01:33:21,605 --> 01:33:25,245
Speaker 4:  a new one that is all just following feeds. So You can, like, instead of

1599
01:33:25,245 --> 01:33:28,965
Speaker 4:  it being an RSS feed from a website, You can now follow, like You can get

1600
01:33:29,805 --> 01:33:33,725
Speaker 4:  a YouTube subscription in there and You can get MAs on feeds in there. And

1601
01:33:33,725 --> 01:33:36,445
Speaker 4:  it's, it's another one where like you, you put a bunch of feeds in that are

1602
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:39,885
Speaker 4:  all these different things and it just renders in this one multimedia timeline.

1603
01:33:40,065 --> 01:33:42,605
Speaker 4:  And it's one of those things that like turns your brain onto like, oh, I

1604
01:33:42,605 --> 01:33:45,125
Speaker 4:  get it now. Yeah. And like what you're talking about is the idea of like,

1605
01:33:45,395 --> 01:33:49,085
Speaker 4:  what if, what if I could pay for just your stuff,

1606
01:33:59,925 --> 01:34:02,445
Speaker 4:  that's that's the stuff man. Yeah. That's the thing that

1607
01:34:34,885 --> 01:34:38,445
Speaker 3:  just see them across the ecosystem. Like, oh, this is where investment is,

1608
01:34:38,445 --> 01:34:42,365
Speaker 3:  that isn't, we're gonna spend a trillion dollars stealing everything on the

1609
01:34:42,525 --> 01:34:46,445
Speaker 3:  internet to train. Oh yeah. Like this is much more like, what

1610
01:34:46,445 --> 01:34:50,125
Speaker 3:  if it was sustainable to make things for other people on the internet, which

1611
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:53,925
Speaker 3:  is just not, there hasn't been this kind of very

1612
01:34:53,925 --> 01:34:56,885
Speaker 3:  sincere engagement in that for a while yet. Okay. Yeah.
