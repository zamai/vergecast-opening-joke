Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, Alex Cranz, and David Pierce discuss takeaways from WWDC, this week's gadget news, and Elon Musk dropping his lawsuit against OpenAI.

2
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:57,455
Speaker 5:  Verge cast for you.

3
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:01,375
Speaker 4:  I don't, I don't want to go too far down this road. I'm saying this is why

4
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,255
Speaker 4:  you should do bangs.

5
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:07,295
Speaker 2:  Yeah. David would rock some bangs. I

6
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:10,895
Speaker 5:  Would say there are several things preventing me from growing good bangs

7
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:13,335
Speaker 5:  and I'm happy to talk about them anytime you want. That's a whole,

8
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:17,135
Speaker 4:  Except for right now, David gets bangs. That's what AI is for. If

9
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:20,295
Speaker 4:  someone can make an AI generated image of David with bangs like that, I have

10
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:24,135
Speaker 4:  very like bouncy curly hair. There's a lot of stuff in my hair to make it

11
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:27,735
Speaker 4:  not do that. Yeah. But we watched the fall guy and I came out of the bathroom

12
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:31,735
Speaker 4:  the other day with just like full floppy bangs. Yeah. And I was like,

13
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:35,455
Speaker 4:  back, should I do this? And she was like, no. She was like, just

14
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:36,175
Speaker 4:  don't just

15
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,615
Speaker 2:  Sit you right back into the bathroom. Yeah.

16
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:41,815
Speaker 5:  I appreciate that. You like me And most men watch Ryan Gosling for an

17
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:43,975
Speaker 5:  hour and a half and then it's like, what if I changed everything about myself?

18
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:45,375
Speaker 2:  Could I, could

19
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:49,335
Speaker 5:  I be more like him if everything about me was different? I've had a lot of

20
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,175
Speaker 5:  those moments recently.

21
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,055
Speaker 4:  Becky met me when I had blonde highlights in my hair.

22
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,975
Speaker 4:  So I think there was, that's an immediate, she's like, I can't go back there.

23
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:03,925
Speaker 4:  I, I've, I suffered through this already. No thank you. Alright. A lot to

24
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:07,485
Speaker 4:  talk about. We promised an entire episode of the show,

25
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:11,845
Speaker 4:  not about the AI stuff. Apple announced at wwc. There has also

26
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:15,645
Speaker 4:  been a ton of gadget news. We're going through that and then lightning round

27
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:20,045
Speaker 4:  unsponsored. And I've seen the tweets from people who are like, I'm trying

28
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:23,845
Speaker 4:  to sponsor the lightning round. Quite frankly, you've gotta just

29
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:27,165
Speaker 4:  bring a suitcase of money to our office directly. Yeah. You're not trying

30
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,845
Speaker 4:  hard enough. That's all I'll say. You can't just be tweeting at me or posting

31
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:33,445
Speaker 4:  on threads. Yeah. Physical money in a suitcase. A good

32
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:37,165
Speaker 4:  suitcase. Yeah. I don't want Amazon. Alphabet soup

33
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:37,925
Speaker 4:  suitcases.

34
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,245
Speaker 2:  We wanna see you in the lobby. Just make

35
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:44,165
Speaker 4:  Icons Samsonite to me. You know, like good suitcase.

36
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:46,565
Speaker 4:  That's actually, it's not the money in the suitcase.

37
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:50,605
Speaker 2:  You just want the suitcase. Do do you need a new suitcase? This

38
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:54,765
Speaker 4:  Here not sponsored by a suitcase company. I don't know any other luggage.

39
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:58,365
Speaker 4:  France American tourist or topo. Do they make topo? Yeah,

40
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:01,405
Speaker 4:  I, I would say away, but we wrote that story about away one time and they

41
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:02,125
Speaker 4:  threatened to sue us.

42
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:06,895
Speaker 4:  She doesn't work there anymore. She's not the CEO Anyway, that's deep VERGE

43
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:09,575
Speaker 4:  lore. We can set that aside. Okay. So we should talk about all the other

44
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:12,775
Speaker 4:  stuff from WWC that isn't ai. But first we should mention two quick things

45
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:16,375
Speaker 4:  about Apple ai. Apple intelligence, if you will. Oh yeah.

46
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:20,295
Speaker 4:  One we talked last week about the confusion over who was paying who

47
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:24,695
Speaker 4:  and the way Apple was treating open ai, which was just a plugin to their

48
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:28,655
Speaker 4:  system to basically do all the risky stuff. Apple will do a

49
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:32,415
Speaker 4:  very small set of things and then if you're like, this might create

50
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:35,335
Speaker 4:  horrible brand risk for us by telling you lies. So like, would you like to

51
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:38,935
Speaker 4:  use chat GPT? Yep. And then they had said, well

52
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:42,495
Speaker 4:  eventually we'll plug Gemini into this and maybe some other models. So it,

53
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:46,175
Speaker 4:  it seemed like they were just extending the capability of their system and

54
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:49,895
Speaker 4:  we couldn't tell who was paying who. Mark Erman has reported no one's paying

55
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:52,415
Speaker 4:  anyone. Apple is paying open eye and exposure.

56
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:57,015
Speaker 4:  And the, the idea here sort of makes sense.

57
00:04:57,805 --> 00:05:01,735
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like everyone in media starts there. Yeah. You get paid in

58
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:02,935
Speaker 2:  exposure. This is just like,

59
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,375
Speaker 4:  I haven't paid crayons in a year. Yeah.

60
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:08,295
Speaker 2:  I I I just live off of like McDonald's that I steal from

61
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:08,935
Speaker 2:  dumpsters.

62
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:12,935
Speaker 4:  It's great. No, but the, the idea right, is

63
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:16,775
Speaker 4:  people will see the chat GBT logo, they'll see the capabilities,

64
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:21,215
Speaker 4:  they'll want to go and log in. This is where it gets real fuzzy. And then

65
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:25,215
Speaker 4:  they will pay for chat GPT the

66
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:28,975
Speaker 4:  20 bucks a month or whatever and then Apple will take

67
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:32,095
Speaker 4:  30%. It's always, it's always in the background.

68
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:36,615
Speaker 4:  What's Apple's plan? 30%. Yeah, that's that. You

69
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:40,455
Speaker 4:  walk into an Apple store, 30% show up with a Samsonite. You know, like

70
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:44,215
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's Tim Cook's vibe. Yeah. And I don't

71
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:48,375
Speaker 4:  know if that's going to work for a few reasons. One, I asked very

72
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:52,015
Speaker 4:  specifically while we were at wwc, is there gonna be an interface for people

73
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:55,615
Speaker 4:  to sign up for the chat GBT subscription?

74
00:05:56,155 --> 00:06:00,035
Speaker 4:  And the answer very clearly was no. Yeah. Can confirm

75
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:04,075
Speaker 4:  you the the Safari is available to you. You, you may go and sign

76
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:06,715
Speaker 4:  up over there. Okay. So they need to build the flow,

77
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:11,505
Speaker 4:  which means Apple has to upsell you to someone else's product inside of its

78
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,465
Speaker 4:  own interfaces and then take 30%.

79
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,025
Speaker 4:  Hmm. Lots of question marks there.

80
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:21,385
Speaker 5:  Does that exist anywhere? I'm trying to think of a version of that

81
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:25,185
Speaker 5:  that exists currently on iOS and I can't think of one where you're

82
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:29,145
Speaker 5:  buying someone else's product inside of an Apple product and how that

83
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:31,065
Speaker 5:  flow would work. I don't think that exists. Oh,

84
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,945
Speaker 2:  Streaming the, for like some of the streaming

85
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:36,785
Speaker 5:  Channels. That's fair. That's probably the closest analog. Yeah. That kind

86
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,545
Speaker 5:  of, that kind of for that's all I got. Yeah.

87
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:42,945
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I don't know. It's, it's new. Right. But so, but the economics as

88
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:47,025
Speaker 4:  reported by Mark Urman would look like, you use this stuff,

89
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:51,065
Speaker 4:  you like it so much, you say to yourself, I wish this robot would re

90
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:51,665
Speaker 4:  remember me.

91
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:57,395
Speaker 4:  And then you go pay the money. So it has a, it has faithfulness, which is

92
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,355
Speaker 4:  the thing you would basically pay for at this point. Aren't

93
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:02,235
Speaker 2:  People kind of like getting fed up with paying the robot for money?

94
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:06,515
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I don't know. I think the, the question here, how this works out is

95
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:10,795
Speaker 4:  if you're getting the basic version for free, which you

96
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:14,715
Speaker 4:  are the full GPT-4 oh all of its features somehow for

97
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:18,555
Speaker 4:  free, what you are not getting is, does

98
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:22,395
Speaker 4:  it remember you, can you use the chat GPT app on

99
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:26,315
Speaker 4:  your phone for free? I think not. I think you get to use it inside of Apple's

100
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,595
Speaker 4:  experiences for free. Okay. That's

101
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,955
Speaker 5:  Right. All of the custom instructions stuff doesn't work. It seems like the

102
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:34,715
Speaker 5:  custom GPTs wouldn't work. So there is a lot of stuff like

103
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:38,555
Speaker 5:  the, the access you would get as far as we know through

104
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:42,475
Speaker 5:  the OS level thing is very limited. And so the,

105
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:46,235
Speaker 5:  the upsell for chat GPT seems plausible. What seems

106
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:50,915
Speaker 5:  wild to me is how expensive the customer acquisition cost

107
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:54,835
Speaker 5:  there is gonna be. If I'm OpenAI, I, I can see two things going

108
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:58,515
Speaker 5:  on here. One is that OpenAI is

109
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:01,675
Speaker 5:  going to launch a search product, which I think everybody believes to be

110
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:02,915
Speaker 5:  true and seems to be true.

111
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:08,475
Speaker 5:  And it's possible that that is going to be part of this, right? That like

112
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:12,235
Speaker 5:  maybe one thing Apple will be happy to do is kick you to the web

113
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:16,275
Speaker 5:  through open AI's search product. And one very good thing you can do

114
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:19,715
Speaker 5:  there is have ads. So it's, there's like, there is maybe a version of that

115
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:23,515
Speaker 5:  that is like a direct correlation to Apple's Google deal where when you

116
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:26,715
Speaker 5:  search, you look at ads and Apple gets some of that revenue.

117
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:30,355
Speaker 5:  That's very straightforward. That product doesn't exist. We have no idea

118
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:33,675
Speaker 5:  what it's gonna look like. So who knows? We'll see the other one is

119
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:38,635
Speaker 5:  this is just like OpenAI spending a tremendous amount of money

120
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:42,595
Speaker 5:  giving you free stuff in the hopes that it can find some way to get you

121
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:46,275
Speaker 5:  to pay. And I think it's gonna be so fascinating to see

122
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:50,635
Speaker 5:  how Apple implements that because you'll be able to tell everything you've

123
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:53,995
Speaker 5:  ever wanted to know about Apple's priorities by when it tries to upsell you.

124
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:57,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You know what I mean? Like if the first time you do it Apple's like

125
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,085
Speaker 5:  wouldn't it be better if you had then it's like, oh, this is a 30% company

126
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:03,405
Speaker 5:  like this is, this is what you're after. You are immediately trying to get

127
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:06,485
Speaker 5:  me to pay more money to do a thing that you have promised me is baked into

128
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:09,805
Speaker 5:  the operating system. Or if Apple is like happy to push this all the way

129
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:13,765
Speaker 5:  out and just make it a teeny tiny box you can find in Safari if you want

130
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:17,645
Speaker 5:  to. That's very different. And I think that that tension

131
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:21,525
Speaker 5:  between these two companies and that product is going to be so weird and

132
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:24,605
Speaker 5:  so interesting. If this is the actual business dynamic here

133
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:28,485
Speaker 4:  And it ramps up even higher if you can just switch it to Google, Gemini or

134
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:32,325
Speaker 4:  whatever next model right, in China they have to use or whatever models come

135
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:36,045
Speaker 4:  out of Europe or whatever. Like the idea that there's this other architecture

136
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:40,605
Speaker 4:  beyond Apple intelligence that these companies can plug into and that will

137
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:44,445
Speaker 4:  drive them customers sort of also implies that Apple believes

138
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:48,005
Speaker 4:  the economics of all these problems are subscriptions. Yep. You plug Google

139
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:52,085
Speaker 4:  Gemini into this, how is Google gonna make money? Well, it's not Apple paying

140
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:55,005
Speaker 4:  Google. It's hopefully they, you sign up for

141
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:59,445
Speaker 4:  Gemini at $20 a month. Right? I don't know if that's the way it will

142
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:00,765
Speaker 4:  actually play out. I think there

143
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:03,925
Speaker 2:  Well there's not, I mean I think there's not a lot of

144
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:09,045
Speaker 2:  risk for Apple in, in this right now. Like if they're paying for

145
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:13,085
Speaker 2:  exposure, then if chat GPT is just sucks and nobody uses it,

146
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:17,045
Speaker 2:  right. Which probably won't happen but could then it's

147
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:20,125
Speaker 2:  fine. Apple's like, okay, yeah, there's something that will we'll close down

148
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,365
Speaker 2:  in a couple of years when everybody stops talking about it. But if it like

149
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:26,445
Speaker 2:  actually takes off, okay, they make money and it's just like, okay, we get

150
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:30,125
Speaker 2:  free money now. Like it doesn't feel like there's a huge risk for Apple in

151
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:30,285
Speaker 2:  this.

152
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:33,605
Speaker 5:  You know who you sound like Alex. Cranz is everyone who argues that Apple

153
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:36,445
Speaker 5:  is a monopoly that needs to be broken up by antitrust law. Like

154
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:38,205
Speaker 2:  That's true. I do. I

155
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,725
Speaker 5:  Totally agree. Like this is all, it's, it's Apple is an incredible leverage

156
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,685
Speaker 5:  point where it has the distribution and nobody else does. And if you're

157
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:48,925
Speaker 5:  open AI and you wanna get in front of a lot of people who are not otherwise

158
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:52,885
Speaker 5:  likely to go to your website or your app, this

159
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,605
Speaker 5:  is your move. And that gives Apple all the power in the world.

160
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:59,405
Speaker 2:  This is huge for open ai, right? Like, like they, they have that first mover

161
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:03,125
Speaker 2:  advantage and that's it scale everything else. Everybody,

162
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:07,085
Speaker 2:  all the other, their competitors just have it all. So, so like they

163
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:07,525
Speaker 2:  need this

164
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:11,245
Speaker 4:  Well except that their, their big competitor is Google and Apple

165
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:14,525
Speaker 4:  has been very clear that Google is coming to the same plugin system. Yeah,

166
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:15,365
Speaker 2:  But not yet.

167
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:19,205
Speaker 4:  But, but now that it chips, so this is my second point. So that was 0.1 on

168
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:23,045
Speaker 4:  Apple intelligence is it appears we understand the

169
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:26,405
Speaker 4:  economics based on Mark's reporting. No one's really repeated it.

170
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,765
Speaker 4:  Apple's not saying it doesn't seem like anyone

171
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:33,765
Speaker 4:  at OpenAI is running around growing about a windfall of profits.

172
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,615
Speaker 4:  That's what we know so far. So it's,

173
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:40,255
Speaker 5:  I will say though, everyone at OpenAI is running around pretty aggressively

174
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,935
Speaker 5:  overstating the extent to which they're involved in all of this. There have

175
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:46,655
Speaker 5:  been a bunch of people tweeting, like we're so excited to be working with

176
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:50,255
Speaker 5:  Apple to help power all of the AI experiences on the iPhone. And it's like

177
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:53,885
Speaker 5:  Easy Buddies like Yeah. Is that accurate? A like last resort

178
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:57,845
Speaker 5:  checkbox kind of situation here. Like let's, let's pump the brakes on what's

179
00:11:57,845 --> 00:11:58,245
Speaker 5:  happening here.

180
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:01,845
Speaker 4:  We're so excited to bring Voice of Scarlet Johansen Siri,

181
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:07,005
Speaker 5:  But only if you get past three popups, it's gonna be great. You're gonna

182
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:07,165
Speaker 5:  love it.

183
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:11,285
Speaker 4:  So that's one is right, we, we seemingly understand the economics

184
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:15,685
Speaker 4:  two actually directly. Right. So what you just said, Alex, it is

185
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:19,645
Speaker 4:  important I think to note that no one has seen

186
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:23,405
Speaker 4:  this work yet. Yeah. There have been some briefings.

187
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,365
Speaker 4:  I we've talked a bunch of reporters. Apple had briefings that showed a bunch

188
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:28,685
Speaker 4:  of stuff on Rails. Great.

189
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:34,005
Speaker 4:  Very cool. Love a controlled demo. Yeah. But having

190
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:37,965
Speaker 4:  just gone through this with the Vision Pro and

191
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:41,845
Speaker 4:  the Rabbit and the Humane Pen and everything else,

192
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:47,085
Speaker 4:  I would just caution everyone that there are only

193
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:50,965
Speaker 4:  two kinds of news where the truth just comes out.

194
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,605
Speaker 4:  One is sports and one is tech products.

195
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:58,245
Speaker 4:  One team wins or loses in you just that you get an answer

196
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:02,685
Speaker 4:  or the gambling economy forces the wrong answer. But that's actually,

197
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,765
Speaker 4:  that's whatever, that's another thing happens over there. But like at the

198
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:08,285
Speaker 4:  end you get a result, right? It's like there's not a lot of dispute about

199
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:12,295
Speaker 4:  what happened at the end of the Super Bowl intact. The products work or

200
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:16,215
Speaker 4:  they don't. And then real people get them and then all bets are

201
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:19,855
Speaker 4:  off. And I've said this a million times now in the show this year, all bets

202
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:22,655
Speaker 4:  are off. Once you start shipping the thing to thousands or millions of people,

203
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:27,705
Speaker 4:  they're just gonna do stuff you never expected. They're gonna break it in

204
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:30,825
Speaker 4:  extremely esoteric ways. They're definitely not gonna read the instruction

205
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:34,505
Speaker 4:  manual. Nope. All of your great ideas just

206
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,785
Speaker 4:  fall apart once like millions of regular people get this stuff. Apple is

207
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,655
Speaker 4:  gonna ship this to a billion people. The Oprah line.

208
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,655
Speaker 4:  They're in a billion pockets. Y'all. That's what Oprah said when they announced

209
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:49,215
Speaker 4:  Apple TV Plus, why'd you make this deal with a, with with Tim Cook and Apple,

210
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:52,175
Speaker 4:  Oprah. They're in a billion pockets. That's a real quote. You can go look

211
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:52,695
Speaker 4:  it up. Yeah,

212
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:53,255
Speaker 5:  I

213
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,175
Speaker 4:  Remember you put this in a billion pockets. Some

214
00:13:57,345 --> 00:14:00,935
Speaker 4:  weird stuff is gonna start. I guarantee you some weird stuff is gonna start

215
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:04,415
Speaker 4:  happening. Tim Cook said to the Washington Post opinion

216
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:08,335
Speaker 4:  section, they're not a hundred percent sure they can stop AI hallucinations

217
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:12,375
Speaker 4:  and he would never make a claim. 'cause why? 'cause why you can't,

218
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,855
Speaker 4:  don't, don't worry about hallucinations, it's fine. Just, it's just gonna

219
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,775
Speaker 4:  lie to you. Sometimes that's what you expect from your iPhone. It's just

220
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:21,215
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Some creative lies. Kevin Rus was at the event just waiting to see

221
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:25,055
Speaker 4:  if everyone intelligence would make love to him, by the way. I saw him at

222
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:28,895
Speaker 4:  the event. I, I apologize directly to Kevin for getting so much mileage

223
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:32,735
Speaker 4:  outta that joke. And he is like, no, everyone is. So I I love, I love you

224
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:32,935
Speaker 4:  Kevin,

225
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:37,055
Speaker 5:  Including his family. He said, so that's, it's good for everybody.

226
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:37,415
Speaker 5:  Yes.

227
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:41,535
Speaker 4:  Rest, rest is assure he knows I continue to make the joke. We haven't

228
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:45,215
Speaker 4:  concretely seen the phone handoff from local

229
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,975
Speaker 4:  inference to the private cloud inference that Apple wants.

230
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:52,245
Speaker 4:  Like we just haven't seen any of this work

231
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,325
Speaker 4:  outside of a very controlled context. And I'm just,

232
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:58,565
Speaker 4:  just, just reminding everyone gently,

233
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,985
Speaker 4:  the AI economy so far has largely run on

234
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:07,905
Speaker 4:  hype and then they ship it and it's like you should put some

235
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:11,945
Speaker 4:  glue on your pizza. Yeah. And I'm not saying

236
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:15,145
Speaker 4:  Apple doesn't have a better track record than everyone else. I'm not saying

237
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:19,065
Speaker 4:  that people, it's wrong to, to believe that

238
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:21,945
Speaker 4:  they can out execute most of their competitors. Apple can definitely out

239
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:25,785
Speaker 4:  execute most of its competitors. The last time the company out

240
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:29,665
Speaker 4:  executed most of its competitors, it shipped the Vision Pro, which is easily

241
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:33,705
Speaker 4:  the most technologically advanced VR headset ever made. Yep. It's still

242
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:37,385
Speaker 4:  a VR headset, right? Like it has all of the problems of the category.

243
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:41,225
Speaker 4:  It does not have a bunch of really novel solutions to them. Right. And it's

244
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:44,185
Speaker 4:  just the best engineered, most complete version of the thing that it is.

245
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,105
Speaker 4:  We have yet to see it. So I'm just, yeah.

246
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:50,785
Speaker 2:  Didn't Apple also have like the disclaimer of like, sometimes it lies Oops.

247
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:51,105
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

248
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:54,145
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. It's, it's right in the interface. Chatt sometimes check this info

249
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:54,345
Speaker 4:  just

250
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:54,945
Speaker 2:  Built right in.

251
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:58,385
Speaker 4:  So I'm not saying it's not gonna work. I I just want to call that out gently.

252
00:15:59,295 --> 00:15:59,585
Speaker 4:  Like

253
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:00,305
Speaker 2:  Gently

254
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:04,505
Speaker 4:  It, we, we have months to go like maybe even a year or more

255
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:08,345
Speaker 4:  to go before all of the features we saw demoed at WWC

256
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:12,425
Speaker 4:  ship shipped to thousands if not millions or billions of

257
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:16,105
Speaker 4:  people. And then a bunch of stuff that

258
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:20,465
Speaker 4:  no one anticipated happening is gonna happen at massive scale. I'll give

259
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:23,745
Speaker 4:  you an example. Casey and Platformer wrote, apple is now in the business

260
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:26,705
Speaker 4:  of content moderation at scale. And I wrote back, I was like, they have the

261
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:29,665
Speaker 4:  app store. He was like, no, no, no, no. Someone's gonna ask this thing to

262
00:16:29,665 --> 00:16:32,905
Speaker 4:  draw a gun and Apple won't do it. And then Tim Cook is gonna end up in front

263
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:36,785
Speaker 4:  of Congress. Like, that is the level of chaos that is

264
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:39,585
Speaker 4:  coming for these systems and they have to bear the pressure.

265
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:43,425
Speaker 4:  And so it doesn't mean they've won, it doesn't mean they're ahead or behind.

266
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:47,465
Speaker 4:  It just means like, we came off a very good show

267
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:52,515
Speaker 4:  and now we have to get the thing. And I keep saying

268
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:55,515
Speaker 4:  like, there's only two categories where you definitively know at the end

269
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,355
Speaker 4:  if it worked or not. It's sports and tech. Like

270
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:02,635
Speaker 4:  I would even say like a lot of people when I bring up this comparison, say

271
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:06,275
Speaker 4:  politics 'cause there's elections look around man. Like

272
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:09,315
Speaker 4:  a lot of people don't think that's one of the categories anymore.

273
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,715
Speaker 2:  I I think this will probably be the same thing too. Yeah. I think, I think

274
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:16,115
Speaker 2:  a lot of people are gonna debate it because, you know, well I I've heard

275
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:19,715
Speaker 2:  this a lot. I I'm very vocal about thinking hallucinations are an enormous

276
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:23,555
Speaker 2:  problem and everybody is glossing over them and should stop. Yeah.

277
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,035
Speaker 2:  And I get a lot of comments being like, don't worry about it.

278
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,995
Speaker 4:  The goalposts on hallucinations have fully moved. Yeah. I've noticed this

279
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:34,275
Speaker 4:  recently. We just had the CEO of cohere on decoder. He's one of the

280
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:37,835
Speaker 4:  people who wrote Attention is all you need at Google. The paper that

281
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:41,355
Speaker 4:  famously described Transformers, which Google loves reminding everyone up.

282
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:45,595
Speaker 4:  And I was like, can you, can you fix it? Like can you, if if you program

283
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:49,645
Speaker 4:  a computer and it delivers some answer to you and sometimes it's wrong,

284
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:53,045
Speaker 4:  like that seems like a bad computer. And he was like, well you get stuff

285
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:53,445
Speaker 4:  wrong too.

286
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:59,405
Speaker 4:  Sure. And he's not that's a totally correct answer. That's, but

287
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:03,285
Speaker 4:  it's like that's why I have a computer Yeah. Is to be far

288
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:04,525
Speaker 4:  more reliable than Yeah. My

289
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:07,925
Speaker 5:  Computer does the math correctly. Like that's, I feel pretty good about that

290
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,165
Speaker 4:  Every single time. Yeah. The example I gave him was

291
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:15,965
Speaker 4:  like, I would not let an LLM like an F 22 cannot be flown without a computer.

292
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,285
Speaker 4:  Like it just can't, like a human being cannot operate an F 22 fast enough

293
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:23,525
Speaker 4:  to keep it stable in flight. And it's like he would just not give it to an

294
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:23,725
Speaker 4:  L

295
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:29,445
Speaker 4:  He did make the point that the, the rate of hallucinations is coming down

296
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:32,885
Speaker 4:  and importantly in, in the context of Apple, apple intelligence is doing

297
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:36,885
Speaker 4:  such little stuff that they've scoped down what they

298
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:40,565
Speaker 4:  want it to do, what they wanna be responsible so far. And then

299
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:42,765
Speaker 4:  anything else is chat GBT, which can lie to you. Which

300
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:46,725
Speaker 2:  Just, I think that's a smart way to do it. So like I think chatt

301
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,765
Speaker 2:  PT is being hugely irresponsible by being like, yeah, use this for everything.

302
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:53,485
Speaker 2:  Sure. But Apple, that is a much more responsible like approach,

303
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:56,685
Speaker 2:  right. Saying, you know what, it's bad at that. So we're just not gonna let

304
00:18:56,685 --> 00:19:00,605
Speaker 4:  It, that we've, we've let some of series, we've improved some of series pro

305
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:01,765
Speaker 4:  natural language process. Well

306
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,125
Speaker 2:  What if it like hallucinates meetings for you?

307
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:08,565
Speaker 4:  Oh, that'd be great. Because if we, if we, if I could, if I could

308
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:12,445
Speaker 4:  incorporate a lying robot into my meeting scheduling, I

309
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:15,845
Speaker 4:  take it. But, and speaking of scoped all the way down, this is another really

310
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,965
Speaker 4:  important piece that I, I didn't even think about while we were there, but

311
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:21,765
Speaker 4:  Gen two E has a piece coming up on the site, but it'll be up by the time

312
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:22,245
Speaker 4:  you read this.

313
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:27,365
Speaker 4:  The new Apple Intelligence, the new Siri won't work on the

314
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:30,605
Speaker 4:  HomePod, it won't work on the Apple tv and it appears it will not work with

315
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:31,045
Speaker 4:  HomeKit.

316
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:34,485
Speaker 5:  Wait, it won't work with HomeKit at all. Like the devices thing makes sense.

317
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:38,405
Speaker 5:  But to not even be part of HomeKit is really fascinating and seems bad.

318
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:42,525
Speaker 4:  It'll like fall back to the old Siri. So you'll be like, turn

319
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:45,485
Speaker 4:  on the lights and I'm like, dude, it's not gonna not work. But the whole

320
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:49,405
Speaker 4:  complicated orchestration piece, right? Well where you're like, I'm just

321
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:53,365
Speaker 4:  talking to my phone and stuff is happening. I don't, it's of fuzzy. We

322
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:54,125
Speaker 4:  don't know yet. Is

323
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,925
Speaker 2:  All of this AI ification of Siri gonna

324
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:01,525
Speaker 2:  improve the fact that Siri doesn't understand me half the time?

325
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:04,845
Speaker 4:  Yes. Hey, so I think this is like the thing that they're gonna fix. Yeah.

326
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:07,405
Speaker 2:  That that like this, my impression is that they're gonna fix that. But like

327
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:11,285
Speaker 5:  That is the thing I'm most confident about with New Siri is that like

328
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:14,925
Speaker 5:  text to speech and speech to text have gotten very, very, very good, very

329
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:18,805
Speaker 5:  fast. And I think if Apple can't do

330
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:22,645
Speaker 5:  that better with Siri, it would, it's just a gigantic failure. Like

331
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:26,605
Speaker 5:  I have a lot of faith in Siri recognition being very good

332
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:29,685
Speaker 5:  and the transcription stuff being very good. Yeah. Like there's no excuse

333
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,965
Speaker 5:  for that stuff not to be very good anyway. But is it the state of the art

334
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,485
Speaker 5:  on that is really good. Does

335
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:36,925
Speaker 2:  This mean that it would work or not work with HomeKit? I guess we'll just

336
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:37,285
Speaker 2:  have to see.

337
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:41,485
Speaker 4:  Right? So I, the, I think that you pick up your phone, you open Siri and

338
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:44,965
Speaker 4:  you say turn open the garage door that appears like it will not get

339
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:48,565
Speaker 4:  routed through the Apple intelligence version. The command will get recognized

340
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:50,645
Speaker 4:  and it'll go to like, okay, whatever was happening. And

341
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:54,205
Speaker 2:  Hopefully they've kind of like made all of Siri smarter

342
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:56,565
Speaker 5:  In that respect. And then old Siri will say, here's what I found on the web

343
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:58,405
Speaker 5:  for turn on garage lights. Yeah.

344
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:01,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So we, again, we don't know 'cause it hasn't shipped, but the idea

345
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:05,085
Speaker 4:  that home kit is not yet part of this appears to be

346
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:09,645
Speaker 4:  like what Jen has. Like that's what she's writing about. And I think that's

347
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,545
Speaker 4:  really fascinating because so much of what you want Siri

348
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:17,225
Speaker 4:  to orchestrate all the examples they gave. Right. The the canonical example

349
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:20,585
Speaker 4:  is tell me what time to leave for the airport to go to my daughter's dance

350
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:24,305
Speaker 4:  recital. Right. And it's always this like made up very

351
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:28,145
Speaker 4:  transactional thing you want to do. Yeah. Right. Like, I'm gonna go to

352
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:32,145
Speaker 4:  a place 'cause I'm cool. I I have a family and a means of

353
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:35,505
Speaker 4:  transportation. I leave the house. My daughter's in dance class.

354
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:39,225
Speaker 4:  It's, this is all very normal. You

355
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:40,825
Speaker 2:  Sleep in a race car bed.

356
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:43,425
Speaker 4:  Exactly. I've got a phone,

357
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:48,955
Speaker 4:  but like one thing you would want to do is like, tell me when to leave the

358
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:52,555
Speaker 4:  office to catch the train. Also turn on my thermostat. Yeah.

359
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:56,595
Speaker 4:  Right. It is like you would just add that in or like a very common thing

360
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:58,915
Speaker 4:  people script in the home kit is like, turn on the lights by the time I get

361
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:02,395
Speaker 4:  home. Like you can see how you would want to have this more

362
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:06,275
Speaker 4:  complicated conversation about stuff in your house. And it,

363
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:08,715
Speaker 4:  I that all feels like not yet.

364
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:11,795
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well and that's also one of the big things they're talking about with

365
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:15,355
Speaker 5:  Apple intelligence is context awareness and the, the

366
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:19,555
Speaker 5:  deep rabbit hole of context awareness is like inside of your smart home,

367
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:22,795
Speaker 5:  right? Like knowing where you are and what you're doing and how you're feeling.

368
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:26,275
Speaker 5:  Like that's the, that's how we get all this stuff going down the road.

369
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:30,155
Speaker 5:  So I I'm actually surprised that that wouldn't be like a

370
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:33,955
Speaker 5:  flagship feature of this, but they really didn't come up at all during the

371
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,515
Speaker 5:  keynote. So I guess I'm not tracked. Yeah.

372
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:39,115
Speaker 4:  And that is more or less what Jen's entire piece is about. But by the way,

373
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:42,715
Speaker 4:  there's also another piece in Business Insider that came out today just before

374
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:46,675
Speaker 4:  we started recording about the Alexa unit at Amazon that

375
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:50,515
Speaker 4:  is like ringing the bell about how bad Alexa is at this

376
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:54,035
Speaker 4:  stuff and how Amazon is underinvested in it. And the, the pivot is just not

377
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:58,075
Speaker 4:  easy to do. Yeah. Like you can't have had this thing and

378
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:01,875
Speaker 4:  be like, we're gonna turn it off and here's a somewhat unreliable,

379
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:06,115
Speaker 4:  extremely horny robot. Like you're just gonna like brick a bunch of Alexa

380
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:09,715
Speaker 4:  devices that people depend on. So it, it is a very hard pivot

381
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,915
Speaker 4:  and I, you know, because Apple is Apple, they can just do it. Especially

382
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:13,075
Speaker 4:  because

383
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:18,265
Speaker 4:  Siri, like, I feel like most people are like, oh, Siri is bad. Yeah.

384
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:22,305
Speaker 4:  Here's a newer horny or fine, let's try that out for a while. Whereas I

385
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:26,265
Speaker 4:  think Alexa exists in your house in nowhere, in no

386
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:29,385
Speaker 4:  other context and you cannot break people's houses in that way. Right.

387
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:33,025
Speaker 4:  Okay. That's enough on the AI stuff. There's a bunch of other stuff that

388
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:35,785
Speaker 4:  we promised people we would talk about from dub dub.

389
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:38,345
Speaker 4:  You wanna do the small updates? Yeah.

390
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:41,065
Speaker 2:  There's, there's a bunch of stuff that we found like that people have found.

391
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:44,665
Speaker 2:  Some of it we, we already talked about like the, the, the buttons, the volume

392
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:48,005
Speaker 2:  buttons. When you press 'em, there's like a cool little animation and now

393
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:50,565
Speaker 2:  that I've seen it, it looks sick, but it it

394
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:52,405
Speaker 4:  Does. But they're, they're definitely gonna take the buttons off the phone.

395
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:52,645
Speaker 4:  I

396
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,005
Speaker 2:  I I don't wanna talk about it.

397
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:58,165
Speaker 2:  I'm fine. It's okay. But also

398
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:03,205
Speaker 2:  bilingual typing is gonna be a thing that's very cool now, which I'm

399
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:07,165
Speaker 2:  super, super excited about because like some of us speak a little

400
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:11,085
Speaker 2:  Spanglish and it, it sucks when it tries to auto correct you

401
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:15,005
Speaker 2:  and you're like, no, I, I know I'm bad at Spanish, but like, come on, I knew

402
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:18,125
Speaker 2:  this one. So, and it won't just work in Spanish, it'll work with a lot of

403
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,485
Speaker 2:  other languages. And so that's gonna be like really, really cool. Also, the,

404
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:25,125
Speaker 2:  the, the light is like the flashlight only on the iPhone

405
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:29,065
Speaker 2:  15 pro. You'll be able to like control the, the

406
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:31,305
Speaker 2:  beam of it and like the brightness of it, the

407
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:34,785
Speaker 5:  Interface for it looks awful. Yeah. Cool feature. But it looks

408
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,905
Speaker 5:  insane to try and manage.

409
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:40,865
Speaker 2:  I am excited to watch people use that in the movie theater when

410
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:44,185
Speaker 2:  they're trying to find their seats. That's gonna be a really fun time. If

411
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:47,145
Speaker 2:  somebody, if they can make like a shortcut to just do like a movie theater

412
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:51,105
Speaker 2:  mode that would rule the widgets are gonna be a little easier to customize.

413
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:55,065
Speaker 2:  Which I think we kind of, we saw a little bit of that during the, the event,

414
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:58,945
Speaker 2:  but it'll be nice. Wes, our, our

415
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:03,625
Speaker 2:  like Vision pro lover on staff is

416
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,465
Speaker 2:  super excited that he will, can see his keyboard now.

417
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:11,195
Speaker 2:  Yeah. When he like, if he puts the headset on, he'll be able to see his keyboard.

418
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,595
Speaker 2:  Whereas before I guess he just like typed an oblivion and hoped he was right.

419
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:15,075
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

420
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:17,795
Speaker 4:  That's very much the Vision Pro experience until recently.

421
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,395
Speaker 2:  So less

422
00:25:19,395 --> 00:25:22,915
Speaker 4:  Oblivious. Also you can use any Bluetooth mouse you want. Yes. Which

423
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:26,315
Speaker 4:  incredible future update for a 3,500 computer

424
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:29,795
Speaker 2:  Now you can use your own inputs on your computer.

425
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,915
Speaker 5:  I mean, as we heard Tim Cook say to Marquez this week, he loves the Magic

426
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:37,835
Speaker 5:  Mouse and it's perfect. And nothing has ever been wrong with it. So it's

427
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,595
Speaker 5:  surprising that they would allow this at all. Frankly,

428
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,195
Speaker 4:  That he didn't. I'm sorry he didn't, I I don't want to be hetic about this.

429
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:47,515
Speaker 4:  That was more information about the Magic Mouse than existed in Tim Cook's

430
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:50,915
Speaker 4:  brain at that time. I encourage everyone to go watch that clip. It's on.

431
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:54,475
Speaker 4:  We posted Marquez's tweet of that clip. He was like, rank

432
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:57,795
Speaker 4:  product launches and you did a bunch of easy ones and you see

433
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:01,435
Speaker 4:  like the devil on Marquez's shoulder like Magic Mouse.

434
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:05,995
Speaker 4:  And he and you just the grin on his face. It's very good. And then Tim Cook.

435
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:10,355
Speaker 4:  Very good. I interview a lot of CEOs. I watched them scramble and

436
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:13,275
Speaker 4:  you just, the dust in that man's brain

437
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:17,995
Speaker 4:  where he was like, what's in this file cabinet? Is it anything? He was like,

438
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:21,755
Speaker 4:  magic mouse. And then yeah, I, he came up with ergonomics.

439
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:24,795
Speaker 4:  He's like, what's a word I can say about mouse? Yeah. It wasn't, we love

440
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:25,475
Speaker 4:  the magic mouse.

441
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:27,555
Speaker 5:  That's true. It was ergonomics.

442
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:28,155
Speaker 4:  Definitely.

443
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:28,795
Speaker 5:  Good. Are they bad?

444
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:31,915
Speaker 4:  The ergonomics? He's like, it doesn't stab you when you hold it. That's the

445
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:32,755
Speaker 4:  apple design,

446
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:39,235
Speaker 2:  Low bar, low bar that I sat there. There's also gonna be some new

447
00:26:39,235 --> 00:26:42,635
Speaker 2:  wallpapers that are like very retro looking and, and look kind of cool. I

448
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:46,125
Speaker 2:  personally love the one that's the, the green and and gray. Of course you

449
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,445
Speaker 2:  do. Yeah. I like bring me back to that eighties monitor experience. Right.

450
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:49,765
Speaker 2:  We

451
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:49,925
Speaker 4:  Know,

452
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:50,925
Speaker 2:  You know, you

453
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,565
Speaker 4:  Know, after last week everyone else knows too.

454
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,765
Speaker 2:  I just, sometimes there's like listeners who might have skipped an episode.

455
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:59,645
Speaker 2:  Why, but I want, I want them to know as well. So, but they, they're like

456
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:03,285
Speaker 2:  animated, they look really sick. So you gotta we, we did a whole story

457
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:06,605
Speaker 2:  kind of chronicling a lot of these things and and there's a video in there

458
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:09,525
Speaker 2:  and it just looks, it looks dope. Yeah. Like it, it,

459
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:13,045
Speaker 4:  The Susan Care wallpaper, she was original Mac designer. They have a lot

460
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:14,565
Speaker 4:  of her iconography. It's very cool.

461
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:18,205
Speaker 2:  It's very, very cool. And then now when somebody leaves you a

462
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:22,155
Speaker 2:  voicemail, it'll like just transcribe it so

463
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:25,195
Speaker 2:  it looks almost like a text in your phone. So that'll be

464
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:30,055
Speaker 2:  really cool if the transcription actually works because if it's

465
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:34,175
Speaker 2:  anything like the Google transcription, it does not understand my mom.

466
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:36,135
Speaker 4:  Interesting.

467
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:40,615
Speaker 2:  It also, my, my my best friend who says mayor,

468
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:44,735
Speaker 2:  mayor, the same way that the horse

469
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:49,385
Speaker 2:  and the, the, the office. Those came up the same way as

470
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:52,785
Speaker 2:  Siri. She was telling me yesterday cannot comprehend that.

471
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:56,385
Speaker 4:  Wait. She often talks about mayors and horses. She

472
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,065
Speaker 2:  Often talks about

473
00:27:57,395 --> 00:27:59,185
Speaker 4:  Mares and the problem is that they're

474
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:02,585
Speaker 2:  Confused. Yeah. And so it's always like, yeah, there's a lot of mares in

475
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:04,865
Speaker 2:  your area. And she's like, cool.

476
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:09,745
Speaker 4:  Okay. So just to confirm, you have a friend who calls you and

477
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:13,425
Speaker 4:  leaves you voicemails about the number of horses in your area.

478
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:14,945
Speaker 2:  In her area.

479
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:19,305
Speaker 4:  And the problem that we have identified is that Siri

480
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:22,105
Speaker 4:  thinks that she's talking about local elected officials. Yeah.

481
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:22,545
Speaker 2:  It's

482
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:25,865
Speaker 4:  Just checking that. I understand. I, like I said, Tim, if you're listening

483
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:27,705
Speaker 4:  that's right up there with magic master ergonomics,

484
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:30,945
Speaker 2:  It's up there a problem to solve. Like let's fix it. Well it just, it struggles

485
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:34,865
Speaker 2:  with like, she was telling me she's got a really strong Texas accent and

486
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:38,665
Speaker 2:  it like, like Siri does not comprehend her. Yeah, that makes sense. But then

487
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:42,585
Speaker 2:  she's got, she speaks Spanish and she has like a, a lovely Mexican accent

488
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:46,345
Speaker 2:  in Spanish and it, it understands it perfectly. So a lot of times she's just

489
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:49,865
Speaker 2:  like, I'm just gonna talk to Siri in Spanish. Wow. Because otherwise it's

490
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:51,945
Speaker 2:  gonna be like, let's talk about elected officials.

491
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:55,145
Speaker 4:  I don't know how to say female horse in Spanish, but if I did rest short,

492
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:55,985
Speaker 4:  I'd be doing it right now.

493
00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:59,385
Speaker 2:  Same. I don't know either. And I'm gonna try to keep it that way. Put it

494
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:03,185
Speaker 2:  in post it's fine for as long as possible. Don't don't tell me. My friend

495
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:06,065
Speaker 2:  will tell me and I don't care. So,

496
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:11,385
Speaker 2:  but, but there's also, there there're gonna be, there's more

497
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:15,305
Speaker 2:  options for charging too. So I guess you're gonna be able to like change

498
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,625
Speaker 2:  how you want your phone to charge. Oh

499
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,665
Speaker 4:  Right. Like limits, like to save the battery,

500
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:22,105
Speaker 2:  Which is nice because we've been able to do that on

501
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:26,125
Speaker 4:  Computers. Yeah. A lot. A lot of Android features here. I wouldn't just,

502
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:29,605
Speaker 2:  Yes. Or and yeah. Like everybody, thanks Apple. I

503
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:33,645
Speaker 2:  appreciate you bringing parody. So there's still a lot more.

504
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:36,365
Speaker 2:  I know people are really looking into it and if you see something who will

505
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:39,045
Speaker 2:  like tag one of us? Mainly David.

506
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:40,565
Speaker 4:  There's just a lot of like

507
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:45,045
Speaker 5:  This cool stuff you full quality of life stuff. Like

508
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:49,525
Speaker 5:  the, now if you, if you paste a link into messages, it'll show you the link

509
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:53,245
Speaker 5:  preview before it sends the message. That's good. Which is like, it's one

510
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:57,165
Speaker 5:  of those things that's like, am I gonna send a link that is 90,000 letters

511
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,925
Speaker 5:  long or is it gonna do the nice preview thing and now, you know, before you

512
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:03,645
Speaker 5:  send it, there's just, there's just a million of those and I think that's

513
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:06,565
Speaker 5:  great. I will say the one I'm most excited about is that you can make the

514
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:10,445
Speaker 5:  app icons bigger and get rid of the label underneath it. Yeah. So

515
00:30:10,445 --> 00:30:13,445
Speaker 5:  instead of saying like having the Safari logo and then saying Safari under

516
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,045
Speaker 5:  it, you can have a bigger Safari logo in it doesn't say safari under it.

517
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:16,685
Speaker 5:  It

518
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:17,045
Speaker 2:  Looks nice.

519
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:21,565
Speaker 5:  Unbelievable. This is the stuff like I really, I cannot shake the

520
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:25,125
Speaker 5:  idea that Apple had a whole two hour long ww

521
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:27,725
Speaker 5:  DC planned. That would've just been all this stuff. And they would've told

522
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,645
Speaker 5:  us about all of it and it would've been a very normal WW DC And then at the

523
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:33,925
Speaker 5:  very end they were like, we have to do a chat GPT thing and just like blew

524
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:37,845
Speaker 5:  it all up. I'm sure that's not what happened, but like we're finding out

525
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:41,725
Speaker 5:  about much more of what's going on on these platforms than we typically do

526
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:43,205
Speaker 5:  after the keynotes.

527
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:46,365
Speaker 2:  And Apple is, the last few years they were doing kind of a thing, right?

528
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:50,285
Speaker 2:  Where one year it'd be like small updates, like they're nice but

529
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:52,565
Speaker 2:  smaller. And then the next year it'd be like, oh, there's some really sick

530
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:56,245
Speaker 2:  stuff in here. And this year was kind of gonna be one of those years

531
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:59,725
Speaker 2:  where it's like, okay, we had a kind of smaller year last year. Really six

532
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:03,285
Speaker 2:  stuff this year. And then now also Apple intelligence.

533
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:07,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So I, I I think I'm, I'm totally in this like

534
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,205
Speaker 2:  theory with you, this conspiracy, David,

535
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:13,845
Speaker 5:  All of my productivity nerd friends are so excited that you can now see

536
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:17,565
Speaker 5:  reminders inside of calendar. Ugh. Ugh.

537
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:20,045
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna get's so much done. You guys

538
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,005
Speaker 4:  Don't even know the installer audience is freaking out. They, you,

539
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,165
Speaker 5:  They literally are. It's very exciting.

540
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:30,405
Speaker 4:  Well, what's interesting, j Peters, j Peterson, The Verge, who's back from

541
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:34,205
Speaker 4:  parental leave. Congratulations Jay. He wrote that The AI

542
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:37,445
Speaker 4:  upgrade cycle is here for Apple. So a lot of this stuff would've never driven

543
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:41,885
Speaker 4:  an incremental upgrade. Yep. You've got an iPhone 13, you can see reminders

544
00:31:41,885 --> 00:31:45,505
Speaker 4:  and calendar. You're not buying an iPhone 16 except

545
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:49,865
Speaker 4:  now maybe Apple Intelligence is gonna make you excited to buy a new phone.

546
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:51,425
Speaker 4:  And Apple's kind of banking on this.

547
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:56,105
Speaker 2:  I mean they, they they need to that like, that that cycle has gone

548
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:59,265
Speaker 2:  down. Right. Like people just don't upgrade as often anymore. Yeah. Unless

549
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,545
Speaker 2:  they're VERGE listeners, in which case they're like, who,

550
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:05,105
Speaker 4:  Who is doing, doing that? Yeah. We have eight gigs of ram. Yeah. Disgusting.

551
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:06,345
Speaker 2:  Gross.

552
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:09,825
Speaker 4:  I have more mares than that at home. Which ones?

553
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:12,025
Speaker 2:  Eric Adams is

554
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:14,865
Speaker 4:  Like, who's there? Eric Adams does not have a gigs of ram.

555
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:19,025
Speaker 4:  I don't know exactly what kind of insult that is, but I know it to be true.

556
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:24,865
Speaker 4:  No, but the, the idea that these features that are

557
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:28,385
Speaker 4:  cool that we're excited about, again, I think regular people

558
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:32,785
Speaker 4:  are gonna experience and be happy about the theming. Yeah. Get ready for

559
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:36,505
Speaker 4:  just a wave of just bananas themes and all the phones

560
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:39,605
Speaker 4:  around you. 'cause people are excited about those things. They're not gonna,

561
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:43,165
Speaker 4:  if Apple gated theming to the next generation of phones, one that would be

562
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:46,645
Speaker 4:  outrageous. Two, it would not inspire one person to buy a new phone. Yeah.

563
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:50,485
Speaker 4:  But if they gate, you can talk to Siri naturally to the next generation of

564
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:53,245
Speaker 4:  phones and it can do all this stuff for you and we can make ads about it

565
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:56,845
Speaker 4:  and market these new capabilities that might drive the cycle.

566
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,125
Speaker 4:  So you can see why they sort of like put all this stuff aside. Yeah.

567
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:03,045
Speaker 2:  Like, because they did it for that, they did it for the watch. The watch

568
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:07,765
Speaker 2:  is like the new update is not gonna work with the series four and the series

569
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:11,605
Speaker 2:  five. So it's just like, I think iPads two

570
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:14,405
Speaker 2:  are affected if the iPad doesn't have an M1 in, it's not gonna get a lot

571
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:15,845
Speaker 2:  of the, the AI features. Oh

572
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:16,725
Speaker 4:  They finally got me.

573
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:17,925
Speaker 2:  They got you. Or

574
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:19,245
Speaker 4:  Did they You

575
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:20,645
Speaker 2:  Go get it. It's so good. We'll find

576
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:20,925
Speaker 4:  Out.

577
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:26,165
Speaker 2:  Zero regrets. Spend all of your money irresponsibly on

578
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:26,605
Speaker 2:  iPads.

579
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,725
Speaker 4:  Just, I've, I've bought so many speakers this year. I can't be buying iPads

580
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:31,405
Speaker 4:  too. Are you kidding me? Your wife's

581
00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:31,885
Speaker 2:  Like, no,

582
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:33,565
Speaker 4:  It's no more stuff. Please.

583
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:38,645
Speaker 2:  But yeah, I like it. It's very interesting that they're pushing it this way.

584
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:41,845
Speaker 2:  But they also got me, 'cause I'm on an iPhone 14 pro and I'm like, okay,

585
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:45,445
Speaker 2:  you're gonna do it. Yeah. And I was gonna, I was gonna hold out for the folding

586
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:49,005
Speaker 2:  one. I just, in my heart of hearts, I fully believe it's any day now.

587
00:33:49,465 --> 00:33:53,125
Speaker 2:  And I mean any year now, not day. But

588
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:54,885
Speaker 2:  instead I'll get it.

589
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:58,845
Speaker 5:  Do we think Apple is running out of things to take 30% of, and

590
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:00,245
Speaker 5:  that's, that's why we're back

591
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:04,085
Speaker 4:  Here. I think the European Union is taking away things that

592
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,205
Speaker 4:  can take 30% from

593
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:08,965
Speaker 5:  Fair, which is, which is then its spins back to now we have to keep selling

594
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:12,405
Speaker 5:  you an iPhone every year because Apple has been on this run

595
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:16,605
Speaker 5:  for good or for bad of saying, you know, hold onto your hardware

596
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:18,965
Speaker 5:  longer. Like, you know, you know the thing Amazon has always said, like,

597
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:21,605
Speaker 5:  we don't make money when you buy your hardware. We make money when you use

598
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:25,565
Speaker 5:  it. Apple has always been a hardware company but has increasingly made money

599
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,605
Speaker 5:  when you use it. And so I think they've always pushed you to make new stuff,

600
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:32,085
Speaker 5:  but, or to buy new stuff rather. But I don't think it has been as

601
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:35,245
Speaker 5:  existentially important for you to upgrade your iPhone every year. As long

602
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:38,965
Speaker 5:  as Apple keeps getting 30% of everything you do. But I mean

603
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:41,765
Speaker 2:  They were still feeling the pressure on this. This was like something we'd

604
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:45,165
Speaker 2:  see earnings after earnings after big iPhones. They'd be like, okay, they

605
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:47,765
Speaker 2:  did it, but not as many people bought it this year. But it's fine because,

606
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:48,045
Speaker 2:  you know.

607
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:51,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But I don't know that I, I think we, everybody kind of got used to

608
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:53,885
Speaker 5:  that and it was, it was the services revenue was coming up to

609
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:58,325
Speaker 2:  Supplant it. I think we got used to that. I think Tim Cook was always probably

610
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:01,365
Speaker 2:  looking for, okay, what's that thing that can drive the next upgrade? Well

611
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,245
Speaker 5:  Sure he invested $10 billion in a car and is now trying to build like home

612
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:04,765
Speaker 5:  robots.

613
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,765
Speaker 5:  Tim's got a lot of plans. They

614
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:10,045
Speaker 4:  Don't have, they got a lot of plans. Yeah. They don't have like post phone

615
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:11,405
Speaker 4:  hardware plans. Right. Yeah.

616
00:35:11,495 --> 00:35:14,405
Speaker 5:  Right. But yeah, so that's kinda my point is like, I think it, it does seem

617
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:17,725
Speaker 5:  like Apple in a very real way is back to we have to sell you an iPhone as

618
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:20,685
Speaker 5:  often as possible and it feels like the move for a bunch of years has been

619
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,565
Speaker 5:  away from that and now it is like back to that in a real way. Yeah.

620
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:27,405
Speaker 2:  As someone who loves gadgets. I love that. Maybe there'll be like cool stuff.

621
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:28,005
Speaker 2:  Do

622
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:31,805
Speaker 5:  You think that's why Apple made the iPhone 15 Pro scratch so easily, which

623
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:35,245
Speaker 5:  is why mine is scratched to bits and now I desperately need a new one in

624
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:35,445
Speaker 5:  September.

625
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:39,445
Speaker 4:  If they would just make a phone whose battery consistently landed, lasted

626
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:43,165
Speaker 4:  for a whole day, six months into its, I'd be very happy. Yeah. But my 15

627
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:47,005
Speaker 4:  pro is like, I'm done, I'm out. You want screen time controls.

628
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:50,885
Speaker 4:  What if I don't turn on? That's, I think about that. Okay, well we

629
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:53,925
Speaker 4:  should take a break. One more thing I wanna call out something I noticed

630
00:35:54,895 --> 00:35:58,755
Speaker 4:  and we were talking about customizing control center. See all this? They

631
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:02,275
Speaker 4:  added one control from one app that I thought was very interesting, which

632
00:36:02,295 --> 00:36:06,185
Speaker 4:  was the FordPass app. And you can lock your

633
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:10,025
Speaker 4:  doors and start your car, turn on the AC right from

634
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:13,945
Speaker 4:  control center 'cause FordPass has a thing. And then Jim Farley, see you

635
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:17,345
Speaker 4:  Ford tweeted, we're excited to partner with Apple and blah blah, blah.

636
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:23,075
Speaker 4:  I I think there, I think there's, there's there's GM walked away from

637
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:26,075
Speaker 4:  CarPlay towards getting tighter.

638
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:30,195
Speaker 2:  Are you, are you saying that they're gonna make an Apple

639
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:32,075
Speaker 2:  like Ford's making the Apple car?

640
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:33,355
Speaker 4:  GMs

641
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:36,595
Speaker 5:  Not making, you just did the, the Brian Windhorst on ES espn. Like, hey,

642
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:37,395
Speaker 5:  let's, let's see,

643
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:40,075
Speaker 4:  Here's what's happening. Don't I don't have it. Do you understand? Would

644
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:43,675
Speaker 4:  I don't have it all the way. I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm,

645
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:47,155
Speaker 4:  I'm suggesting that if somebody does know this information, they should tell

646
00:36:47,155 --> 00:36:49,595
Speaker 4:  me this information in a way that I can report it. So

647
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:53,195
Speaker 5:  There's a Skunk Works team inside of Ford that is building good cars

648
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:54,875
Speaker 5:  instead of stupid ones. Is this

649
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:55,915
Speaker 2:  Ford Red? What if

650
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:56,595
Speaker 5:  That's just

651
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:59,915
Speaker 4:  Apple? Hold on. There actually is the skunkworks team inside of Ford. I know.

652
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:01,035
Speaker 5:  This is what I'm saying. What if all of

653
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:02,115
Speaker 4:  Those people run by Doug Field

654
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:03,235
Speaker 5:  Are just apple moles?

655
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,795
Speaker 4:  No, I, I am saying GM walked away from CarPlay

656
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:11,075
Speaker 4:  and the other giant American automaker is like, what if we

657
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:15,035
Speaker 4:  integrate more tightly with Apple software and that is suggestive

658
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:17,915
Speaker 4:  that they might do something else. And if you are a person who might know

659
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:18,915
Speaker 4:  what that something else is,

660
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:21,515
Speaker 2:  They're gonna bundle a phone with a car.

661
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:25,715
Speaker 4:  It's, they're gonna, they're gonna buy Verizon, whatever.

662
00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:27,395
Speaker 4:  Look, you know.

663
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:30,035
Speaker 5:  Right. Buy an iPad, get a Mustang. Look at, here

664
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:31,195
Speaker 4:  We go. I would do that

665
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:36,315
Speaker 4:  as a person with a used iPad and a used Mustang

666
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:40,115
Speaker 4:  if I That's there's your Supercycle. Yeah. And you know, if you know what

667
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,035
Speaker 4:  I'm, we gotta take a break. We're right back.

668
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:22,595
Speaker 4:  The Vergecast. In case you missed,

669
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:56,285
Speaker 2:  just

670
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:57,485
Speaker 5:  Give, gimme it. Yeah.

671
00:41:58,035 --> 00:41:58,325
Speaker 2:  Cool.

672
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:02,365
Speaker 5:  It's so weird. Anyway, but I think the way more interesting

673
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:05,085
Speaker 5:  thing is Phil Spencer, who runs Xbox at Microsoft

674
00:42:06,585 --> 00:42:10,125
Speaker 5:  has been, I would say like aggressively and loudly

675
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:14,165
Speaker 5:  hinting that Microsoft is going to build a handheld gaming device for a long

676
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,685
Speaker 5:  time. And then just said out loud in an interview, I believe with IGN

677
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:22,165
Speaker 5:  quote I think we should have a handheld too. So like, there it

678
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,765
Speaker 5:  is. He was basically like, this is, this is a a time we're doing

679
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,205
Speaker 5:  software, we're talking about games. They also talked about bringing more

680
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:32,325
Speaker 5:  games to other platforms, which made a lot of Xbox people mad in the way

681
00:42:32,325 --> 00:42:36,005
Speaker 5:  that it did before. But he's just, they're just making a handheld

682
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:37,245
Speaker 5:  like it's just coming. I

683
00:42:37,245 --> 00:42:40,445
Speaker 2:  Think the, the big difference here is we've heard these rumors about a handheld

684
00:42:40,445 --> 00:42:43,285
Speaker 2:  from them for ages, right? Like when they were really pushing cloud

685
00:42:44,225 --> 00:42:47,485
Speaker 2:  gaming right after the, the Xbox series X was launched,

686
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:51,325
Speaker 2:  everybody was like, okay, yeah, they're gonna do like a cool cloud console.

687
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:55,405
Speaker 2:  And then that didn't happen because of the cloud gaming stuff just didn't

688
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:58,445
Speaker 2:  kind of take off as they wanted. Right? There was that there was also the

689
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:01,005
Speaker 2:  streaming box and it got killed. And so all this stuff got killed a couple

690
00:43:01,005 --> 00:43:04,125
Speaker 2:  of years ago and then it's like, okay, you're, you're gonna make a handheld

691
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,845
Speaker 2:  now. Cool. You've been saying that for like half a decade at this point,

692
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:12,325
Speaker 2:  but the difference now is it sounds like it's gonna run Windows and

693
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:16,205
Speaker 2:  that rules the dream. And as someone who uses these little consoles,

694
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:20,205
Speaker 2:  that's awesome because the current version of like windows on one of these

695
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:22,285
Speaker 2:  little game consoles sucks. Now

696
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:26,525
Speaker 4:  What makes us confident that Microsoft can overcome the nature of running

697
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:27,605
Speaker 4:  Windows on a handheld,

698
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:28,925
Speaker 2:  Nothing. Okay.

699
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:29,925
Speaker 4:  Have you heard about our,

700
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,005
Speaker 5:  Our Lord and Savior arm processors?

701
00:43:32,515 --> 00:43:32,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

702
00:43:32,845 --> 00:43:34,445
Speaker 2:  I mean it is like, like it is the arm

703
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,405
Speaker 4:  Processor and we think the games, well, I guess you can res 'em down, right?

704
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:39,565
Speaker 4:  You you don't have to, you're not trying to run 'em at full quality anything.

705
00:43:39,565 --> 00:43:39,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like

706
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:43,805
Speaker 2:  The, the steam deck automatically res this stuff down. Right? And, and

707
00:43:43,805 --> 00:43:46,685
Speaker 2:  so the the idea here is that it would do this, we've also, we were hearing

708
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:50,125
Speaker 2:  rumors about like Nvidia getting back into the arm stuff. They used to do

709
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:54,085
Speaker 2:  the, the te grow, which notably powers the Switch. There's

710
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:57,685
Speaker 2:  also Media tech, you know, everybody knows Media Tech. There's,

711
00:43:57,685 --> 00:44:00,245
Speaker 4:  There's a media tech processor within 50 yards of you right now. Yeah.

712
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:03,365
Speaker 2:  Probably within like five 50 inches

713
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:06,165
Speaker 4:  That a threat. I'm just saying like, there's everywhere you are, there's

714
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:09,725
Speaker 4:  a Media Protect processor. They're gonna, if you're that TV right there guarantee

715
00:44:09,725 --> 00:44:10,325
Speaker 4:  you there's behavior

716
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:13,085
Speaker 2:  A hundred percent. You guys can't see it, but there's a TV there and it definitely

717
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:16,525
Speaker 2:  has media tech in it. Yeah. But, but media tech is also like gonna be doing

718
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:20,365
Speaker 2:  the processor stuff and, and doing arm processors and there's even rumors

719
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:20,445
Speaker 2:  that

720
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:23,365
Speaker 4:  Be No, just to be clear, they already are. They already do because they're

721
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:25,645
Speaker 4:  everywhere. They're Yeah. But they wanna make good ones. Yeah.

722
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:30,725
Speaker 2:  Thank you. Thank you. That is an important clarification. They already make

723
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:34,245
Speaker 2:  arm processors now they wanna make the ones that don't suck and,

724
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,365
Speaker 2:  and there's rumors that they might be partnering with Nvidia. There's something

725
00:44:37,365 --> 00:44:39,645
Speaker 2:  happening there. So like the potential for

726
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:43,725
Speaker 4:  That is the media tech Nvidia combo is like,

727
00:44:44,945 --> 00:44:48,125
Speaker 4:  oh boy, that dude probably has a lot of money, right? Like that's not a

728
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:49,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

729
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:50,965
Speaker 2:  That, that is Nvidia being like the

730
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:52,525
Speaker 5:  Rock and Kevin Hart, is that what you're saying?

731
00:44:52,895 --> 00:44:56,685
Speaker 4:  Right. Yeah. There's a movie called She's Out of my league.

732
00:45:00,315 --> 00:45:03,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah, this is accurate. This is accurate. But, but I think that's kind of

733
00:45:03,305 --> 00:45:06,525
Speaker 2:  all is is what's driving some of this

734
00:45:07,315 --> 00:45:11,165
Speaker 2:  like hype for a new Xbox handheld console is there's a lot of

735
00:45:11,165 --> 00:45:14,645
Speaker 2:  potential that could change, but they also have to make windows

736
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:18,915
Speaker 2:  not suck visually. Yeah. Like I don't, I don't care about how it runs.

737
00:45:18,935 --> 00:45:19,875
Speaker 2:  It needs to not suck

738
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:23,515
Speaker 5:  Visually. Like they just run, run the Xbox app, like done.

739
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:27,195
Speaker 5:  That's, it's just sitting there like all that software is just sitting there.

740
00:45:27,255 --> 00:45:30,475
Speaker 5:  That's true. Microsoft could do it and it just hasn't for some reason.

741
00:45:30,745 --> 00:45:34,515
Speaker 4:  Well, I mean theoretically the Xbox itself is running a

742
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:36,195
Speaker 4:  version of Windows, right? Remember, right?

743
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:37,155
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah it does. Yeah.

744
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:40,915
Speaker 4:  And they just cut it down to run one app. Well,

745
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:41,555
Speaker 5:  Right.

746
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:45,275
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They could do that again and then all of these other consoles which

747
00:45:45,465 --> 00:45:48,755
Speaker 2:  suck so much with full windows on them could suck less

748
00:45:49,385 --> 00:45:53,075
Speaker 2:  that. That's what I really want. If you can tell there's stuff already out

749
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:56,875
Speaker 2:  there that's really sick and the software is garbage.

750
00:45:56,985 --> 00:45:57,275
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

751
00:45:57,275 --> 00:45:59,795
Speaker 5:  So that's the thing, right? And I think to me the reason this is very exciting

752
00:45:59,795 --> 00:46:00,155
Speaker 5:  is that

753
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:05,755
Speaker 5:  we really haven't had Sony or Microsoft

754
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:09,955
Speaker 5:  make a really truly like first class

755
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:12,275
Speaker 5:  competitive handheld lately.

756
00:46:12,545 --> 00:46:15,475
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm sorry. In a long time. P was a and

757
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:16,835
Speaker 2:  The Vida, I mean come

758
00:46:16,835 --> 00:46:19,275
Speaker 4:  On. The PSP was incredible.

759
00:46:19,935 --> 00:46:21,395
Speaker 5:  It was, I I don't doubt it.

760
00:46:21,785 --> 00:46:22,315
Speaker 4:  Know that vi

761
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:23,915
Speaker 5:  Six 50 years ago,

762
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:26,475
Speaker 5:  that was fair.

763
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:28,395
Speaker 2:  Did you watch a lot of movies on your PSP?

764
00:46:28,855 --> 00:46:32,635
Speaker 4:  No. No, no, no. But it had a Sony disc format, like a custom UMVI

765
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:33,075
Speaker 2:  Believe. Yes.

766
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:34,875
Speaker 5:  Those are the days Good. It was right up there

767
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:36,435
Speaker 4:  With the mega base.

768
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,035
Speaker 4:  By the way, shout out to all the people wandering through best wise sending

769
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:44,715
Speaker 4:  me photos of UL T speakers. There's a Sony marketing person

770
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:48,715
Speaker 4:  who's like, this is off the charts and that's because of us. The chart

771
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:52,275
Speaker 4:  was flatline below. Just to be clear, the chart has gone to five boop,

772
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:54,595
Speaker 4:  but we're doing it, we're making a difference.

773
00:46:56,545 --> 00:46:56,835
Speaker 4:  Just

774
00:46:56,835 --> 00:47:00,035
Speaker 5:  They're like, it's so weird. Nobody ever presses the button yesterday. Six

775
00:47:00,155 --> 00:47:02,715
Speaker 5:  people pressed the button. What's happening there?

776
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:08,235
Speaker 5:  But yeah, that was, that was all the Xbox stuff. My guess would be

777
00:47:09,385 --> 00:47:12,595
Speaker 5:  it's, there's, there's, I just feel like if you're Phil Spencer, you don't

778
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:15,875
Speaker 5:  say that if there's not something happening. Yeah. He is relatively near

779
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:19,075
Speaker 5:  future consider Yeah. Yeah. And he's been, he's been sort of sneaky about

780
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:22,915
Speaker 5:  this. Like he's liked tweets and, and has sort of intimated

781
00:47:22,915 --> 00:47:25,835
Speaker 5:  that this is a thing that he thinks is interesting. But I think you look

782
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:29,075
Speaker 5:  at the continued success of the steam deck, the fact that

783
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:32,525
Speaker 5:  Nintendo has a switch to coming that everybody's very excited about like

784
00:47:33,515 --> 00:47:37,005
Speaker 5:  this, this idea is not going away. Like I think

785
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:40,725
Speaker 5:  handheld gaming is going to be the next big thing for a very long time.

786
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:44,285
Speaker 5:  And it seems very clear that Microsoft also believes that. But they will

787
00:47:44,285 --> 00:47:48,245
Speaker 5:  also happily ship you a white version of the same thing they already have

788
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,525
Speaker 5:  seven months from now. If that's what you'd rather have. Congratulations

789
00:47:52,045 --> 00:47:55,885
Speaker 4:  Microsoft, Phil has been very direct being like, we did not do

790
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:59,245
Speaker 4:  well in this generation of the console wars. This is why we had to go buy

791
00:47:59,245 --> 00:48:01,925
Speaker 4:  Activision. Right. And like figure out a way to compete.

792
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:06,325
Speaker 4:  We just did an episode of Dakota with Ash Parish about the gay market and

793
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:10,045
Speaker 4:  she was like, desktop PC gaming is going down. And then a million

794
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:14,005
Speaker 4:  people wrote us an email to point out that it's going up if you

795
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:14,765
Speaker 4:  count the steam deck,

796
00:48:16,655 --> 00:48:20,165
Speaker 4:  right? Like that's where the growth is. Yeah. At part of the market. So if

797
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:23,845
Speaker 4:  you're Phil and you're like, okay, we're not gonna magically

798
00:48:23,855 --> 00:48:27,765
Speaker 4:  start a new console generation tomorrow and win against Sony and its various

799
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:31,485
Speaker 4:  advantages. We are looking at Nintendo

800
00:48:31,695 --> 00:48:34,965
Speaker 4:  gonna launch a switch to, I really hope they call it the Super Nintendo Switch

801
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:38,125
Speaker 4:  by the way. That'd be great. That will be a dominant moment. Where are we

802
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,725
Speaker 4:  growing? Where's the action? The Action is immobile good? We bought Candy

803
00:48:40,725 --> 00:48:42,685
Speaker 4:  Crush. Settled. Yep.

804
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:43,165
Speaker 2:  Well,

805
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:46,245
Speaker 4:  And, and then the action is in these handhelds where we're getting growth

806
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:50,205
Speaker 4:  against PCs, gaming PCs are a thing. Like we can maybe get some action

807
00:48:50,205 --> 00:48:50,405
Speaker 4:  there.

808
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:54,645
Speaker 2:  And also a lot of, like the switches success has been on the backs of indie

809
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:57,885
Speaker 2:  developers. Right. And, and Microsoft actually has a pretty good relationship

810
00:48:57,885 --> 00:49:01,085
Speaker 2:  with indie developers. They, they put a lot of these games out on, on their,

811
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:04,285
Speaker 2:  the Xbox in general. And people are like, I would like to play that on a

812
00:49:04,285 --> 00:49:08,205
Speaker 2:  handheld and maybe not the Switch. Right. And that would be like, oh,

813
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,885
Speaker 2:  I can play big triple A Xbox games that aren't

814
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:15,765
Speaker 2:  exclusive because Xbox apparently doesn't make exclusive games anymore. And

815
00:49:15,825 --> 00:49:18,405
Speaker 2:  you can play like Hades two. That would, that'd be sick.

816
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:22,405
Speaker 4:  Well, I think ex the exclusive game strategy didn't sell off Xboxes. Yeah.

817
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,525
Speaker 4:  It's like the other way around. Yeah. They're like, oh fine, just play our

818
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:26,525
Speaker 4:  games in your PS five.

819
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:27,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They, they

820
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:29,565
Speaker 4:  Didn't didn't buy, buy some stuff in this game. We'll be happy.

821
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:32,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Because all the ones that they wanna make exclusive, the FTC will be

822
00:49:32,685 --> 00:49:33,525
Speaker 2:  like, I'm sorry, what?

823
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:37,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Now, now they got other problems. Yeah. Anyway. I I And the idea that

824
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:40,485
Speaker 4:  they made a white one and they just won't sell it is like, this is your big

825
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:43,405
Speaker 4:  holiday marketing push. You are gonna build demand for the white one.

826
00:49:43,735 --> 00:49:47,245
Speaker 5:  Kills me. Kills me. Anyway, the the next one

827
00:49:47,845 --> 00:49:50,645
Speaker 5:  I wanna talk about while we're just rolling through gadgets here is Jabra,

828
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:54,725
Speaker 5:  which put me on a real like, emotional rollercoaster this week. It launched

829
00:49:55,045 --> 00:49:58,245
Speaker 5:  a pair of headphones, two pairs of headphones, the Elite 10 and Elite eight

830
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,885
Speaker 5:  active new versions of it with a very cool feature that I was very excited

831
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:04,485
Speaker 5:  to talk about on this show. And then promptly announced that they're not

832
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:08,125
Speaker 5:  making headphones anymore. Like within a couple of hours they were like,

833
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,565
Speaker 5:  here's this dope new thing that we made. Nevermind. We're out. Goodbye.

834
00:50:10,915 --> 00:50:13,685
Speaker 2:  Well, they're still making it. It's still, it's still gonna come, but that's

835
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:13,805
Speaker 2:  it.

836
00:50:14,415 --> 00:50:14,765
Speaker 5:  Right?

837
00:50:15,435 --> 00:50:16,765
Speaker 2:  They're they're closing the door behind

838
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:18,725
Speaker 5:  Them. Yeah. They're like, they'll support these for the next few years. And

839
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:22,525
Speaker 5:  on the one hand I'm like, okay, do I need like, ongoing software support

840
00:50:22,525 --> 00:50:26,045
Speaker 5:  from my Bluetooth headphone manufacturer? Like, not really. But on the other

841
00:50:26,045 --> 00:50:30,005
Speaker 5:  hand, like the, the last death nails of

842
00:50:30,245 --> 00:50:33,485
Speaker 5:  a company's headphone lineup seem like a silly thing to recommend to people.

843
00:50:33,485 --> 00:50:34,005
Speaker 5:  Wait, what's

844
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:34,445
Speaker 4:  The cool feature?

845
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:38,405
Speaker 5:  So the cool feature is they, these are wireless earbuds and they

846
00:50:38,405 --> 00:50:41,765
Speaker 5:  come in a case and you can plug in the case to an audio source.

847
00:50:42,745 --> 00:50:45,205
Speaker 5:  You can, with a, a head, you can plug it into a headphone jacker.

848
00:50:45,485 --> 00:50:46,445
Speaker 4:  They're a Bluetooth transmitter.

849
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:49,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They, they're a Bluetooth transmitter. And so they'll, they'll turn

850
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:53,565
Speaker 5:  any wired thing into a Bluetooth thing that then streams directly to

851
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:54,165
Speaker 5:  your earbuds.

852
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:58,325
Speaker 2:  This would've been great. Unbelievable. Like years ago when planes still

853
00:50:58,465 --> 00:50:58,685
Speaker 2:  had

854
00:50:59,465 --> 00:50:59,885
Speaker 4:  No, they do

855
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,525
Speaker 2:  Not an Well, you're fancy.

856
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:06,485
Speaker 5:  You fly Dude, Alaska, I was on a united flight yesterday and

857
00:51:06,545 --> 00:51:09,965
Speaker 5:  not only did they have a screen, the screens had Bluetooth and you could

858
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:13,885
Speaker 5:  pair your AirPods to the screen. But if you had ever done

859
00:51:13,885 --> 00:51:16,845
Speaker 5:  it before on a united flight, the first thing you had to do was go in and

860
00:51:16,845 --> 00:51:20,685
Speaker 5:  forget it in order to then go repair it. So the,

861
00:51:20,685 --> 00:51:24,005
Speaker 5:  this poor flight attendant had to give us like a four minute speech about

862
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:28,005
Speaker 5:  how to connect your AirPods to the screen in front of you. But it's a thing

863
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:30,285
Speaker 5:  you could do it, it was the first time I'd ever encountered that and it was

864
00:51:30,285 --> 00:51:30,725
Speaker 5:  very exciting.

865
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:33,725
Speaker 2:  Well, and now I'm just disappointed in Alaska and American. Then

866
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:37,605
Speaker 5:  I guess United is a, is a trash airline with one good plane was,

867
00:51:37,885 --> 00:51:39,205
Speaker 5:  I would say my experience so far.

868
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:40,405
Speaker 2:  You were just on the one plane.

869
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:41,885
Speaker 5:  It was on the one good plane.

870
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:46,365
Speaker 4:  Wait, can I issue a very, very small complaint about Delta? Yes,

871
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:49,165
Speaker 4:  please. And actually in general, a thing that I think should be legal. 'cause

872
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:53,045
Speaker 4:  I flew home on Delta. Yeah. They had Infinity War, but not end

873
00:51:53,045 --> 00:51:55,605
Speaker 4:  game. Hmm. And I, 'cause you get on the plane, you're like, I gotta kill

874
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:59,485
Speaker 4:  five hours. And that's sitting right there for you. You nod in and out.

875
00:51:59,645 --> 00:52:02,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I was telling Alex I had one too many drinks in the plane home.

876
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,725
Speaker 4:  You know, it was one of those fights that started in the afternoon, but ended

877
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,845
Speaker 4:  late in the evening. Oh yeah. And you're just like, I'm just gonna ride this

878
00:52:07,845 --> 00:52:08,405
Speaker 4:  way. You just

879
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:08,645
Speaker 2:  Go,

880
00:52:09,385 --> 00:52:12,405
Speaker 4:  You, you have to have both. I think Lena Khan should get involved. You have

881
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:15,565
Speaker 4:  to have both. Yeah. That is consumer protection right there.

882
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:18,645
Speaker 4:  Even though I've seen both of these movies five,

883
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:19,845
Speaker 2:  I was like, do you know what happens?

884
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:24,965
Speaker 4:  I, I believe you know, the Avengers do a good

885
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:25,245
Speaker 4:  job.

886
00:52:27,765 --> 00:52:28,565
Speaker 5:  I mean, it's largely crap.

887
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:31,765
Speaker 2:  Eli recaps movies, new second of the podcast.

888
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:35,645
Speaker 4:  In the first one, they don't do a good job. And in the second

889
00:52:35,825 --> 00:52:38,085
Speaker 4:  one they do a good job. Yeah.

890
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:42,845
Speaker 2:  That, that was a really good spoiler free

891
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:45,725
Speaker 2:  recap. I appreciate

892
00:52:45,725 --> 00:52:47,885
Speaker 4:  It. Well, I did spoil the first one, but if you haven't seen the first one

893
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:50,805
Speaker 4:  here, what you do get on Delta. 'cause that's all they got that

894
00:52:53,425 --> 00:52:56,165
Speaker 4:  I'm actually, well, I was talking to Chris Welch about this story yesterday

895
00:52:56,165 --> 00:52:59,725
Speaker 4:  and Liz Lipato was there and she was like, I believe that taking the headphone

896
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:03,485
Speaker 4:  jack away from phones led to the

897
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,365
Speaker 4:  proliferation of people just listening to stuff out loud on their phones.

898
00:53:06,585 --> 00:53:06,805
Speaker 4:  Mm.

899
00:53:07,235 --> 00:53:07,525
Speaker 2:  It's

900
00:53:07,525 --> 00:53:09,365
Speaker 5:  True. That's such a Liz Lipato take. Yes

901
00:53:09,365 --> 00:53:09,885
Speaker 4:  It is. It's

902
00:53:09,905 --> 00:53:13,445
Speaker 2:  No, but she's, she's correct because the Path train people are like, no

903
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:16,605
Speaker 4:  Gonna, yes. Like whatever. My headphones are dead. I don't wanna dink around

904
00:53:16,605 --> 00:53:17,445
Speaker 4:  with these. I'm just listening.

905
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:20,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you're you're gonna enjoy whatever I'm enjoying and suck it if you

906
00:53:20,925 --> 00:53:21,125
Speaker 2:  don't.

907
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:24,925
Speaker 4:  All right. New idea for a phone. No speakers, just headphone

908
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:25,845
Speaker 4:  jacks. Yes.

909
00:53:25,845 --> 00:53:29,485
Speaker 5:  Thinking that. Yeah. There's your courage. Apple. Don't get rid of the

910
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:33,285
Speaker 5:  headphone Jack. Get rid of the speakers. Yeah. Give me a power button

911
00:53:33,385 --> 00:53:36,365
Speaker 5:  and no speakers on my phone. Done. Let's do this. I'm ready.

912
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:40,365
Speaker 4:  It's the opposite. It's like the Schiller nightmare. He is like, wakes up

913
00:53:40,365 --> 00:53:43,085
Speaker 4:  in a cold sweat. He is like, what's happening?

914
00:53:44,445 --> 00:53:47,525
Speaker 4:  Speaking of weird phones, the The Light Phone. People

915
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:51,205
Speaker 4:  love talking about this phone. They do not love buying it.

916
00:53:52,555 --> 00:53:56,165
Speaker 4:  From what I can understand. They love looking at it and talking about it.

917
00:53:56,165 --> 00:53:57,565
Speaker 4:  David, you saw it. The Light Phone three.

918
00:53:57,885 --> 00:54:01,365
Speaker 5:  I haven't seen it. I've seen it over Zoom, but I, I talked

919
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:05,645
Speaker 5:  to Kait, the co-founder of the company, and I've talked to him a bunch

920
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:09,605
Speaker 5:  over the years. The weird thing about The Light Phone two

921
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:13,925
Speaker 5:  was that it was never a huge hit, but also according

922
00:54:13,925 --> 00:54:17,845
Speaker 5:  to him, it has sold more units every year. It has been around. This

923
00:54:17,845 --> 00:54:21,805
Speaker 5:  thing is five years old and it's sold more this past year than it

924
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:24,405
Speaker 5:  did in its first year, which I think is fascinating and is not something

925
00:54:24,405 --> 00:54:28,285
Speaker 5:  you normally see from a phone. And they're in this position now

926
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:32,315
Speaker 5:  of the, the sort of intellectual idea that

927
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:34,875
Speaker 5:  I would like to change my relationship with my smartphone, I think is bigger

928
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:38,835
Speaker 5:  than ever. We are also more invested in our

929
00:54:38,915 --> 00:54:41,835
Speaker 5:  smartphones than ever. And so what they tried to do was basically figure

930
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:45,795
Speaker 5:  out, okay, how do we get away from the idea that like

931
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:49,715
Speaker 5:  what you need is a phone that doesn't do anything at all and give you a phone

932
00:54:49,715 --> 00:54:53,355
Speaker 5:  that just does the right things and not the wrong things. And actually that

933
00:54:53,355 --> 00:54:57,035
Speaker 5:  is like the dream of the sort of minimalist smartphone and has been forever.

934
00:54:57,495 --> 00:55:01,475
Speaker 5:  And there are a lot of people who say, oh, why do you need any

935
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:04,995
Speaker 5:  of this stuff? Just like, have more discipline and be more responsible on

936
00:55:04,995 --> 00:55:07,715
Speaker 5:  your phone. To which I say that's a stupid argument.

937
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:13,155
Speaker 5:  It's true. But it's also like, if, if, if just discipline was the

938
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,635
Speaker 5:  answer to all of our problems, like the world would be a really different

939
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:19,595
Speaker 5:  place. And what it actually is is like the one

940
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:23,515
Speaker 5:  good thing about the social dilemma, which is an otherwise

941
00:55:23,835 --> 00:55:27,595
Speaker 5:  I think disaster of a documentary was that it

942
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:31,115
Speaker 5:  framed the idea as like you against thousands of engineers trying to destroy

943
00:55:31,115 --> 00:55:34,475
Speaker 5:  you. And I think that is like a pretty correct way to think about your smartphone.

944
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:38,035
Speaker 5:  And so light phone's idea is like, how do we just reset that balance? Right?

945
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:42,035
Speaker 5:  So they've, they added a camera but gave that camera much less to

946
00:55:42,035 --> 00:55:45,995
Speaker 5:  do. They added NFC, but they're only gonna do payments with it. They

947
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:49,915
Speaker 5:  have a better screen. But because apparently people were having

948
00:55:49,915 --> 00:55:53,475
Speaker 5:  trouble with E Inc. Like one of the things Kai said to me was that the single

949
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,915
Speaker 5:  biggest issue people had with the phone that like

950
00:55:56,915 --> 00:56:00,875
Speaker 5:  50% of the reason people returned it or stopped using it was because of the

951
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:03,675
Speaker 5:  refresh rate of E Inc. Yeah. Which I thought was really interesting. There's

952
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:06,675
Speaker 5:  just something about it that just didn't work for people. So instead they

953
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:09,875
Speaker 5:  switched to a Matt Ed, which should refresh much faster, should be much easier

954
00:56:09,895 --> 00:56:13,675
Speaker 5:  to type on, should look a lot better, but should have some of those same

955
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:17,315
Speaker 5:  kind of monochrome, not quite so blaring

956
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:18,435
Speaker 5:  properties and

957
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:21,075
Speaker 2:  Battery like support. Right. Because

958
00:56:21,105 --> 00:56:23,980
Speaker 5:  It's all we'll see about battery The Light Phone two, two lasted forever.

959
00:56:24,395 --> 00:56:28,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This thing is, it's substantially bigger, so it definitely has

960
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:32,165
Speaker 5:  more battery, but it does run that screen, but it's not doing

961
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:35,045
Speaker 5:  all that much with it most of the time. Well, yeah. And it's, and since it's

962
00:56:35,085 --> 00:56:37,725
Speaker 5:  ol lead, it should only have to power some of the pixels and not the others.

963
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:41,125
Speaker 5:  So I, I reasonably high hopes for this thing, but

964
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:44,605
Speaker 5:  at least according to the traffic to our website, people are very interested

965
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:45,765
Speaker 5:  in this thing. It

966
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:49,645
Speaker 2:  Looks like I don't need it and I want it. I will never use

967
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:51,845
Speaker 2:  it. I know that, but I'm still like, oh,

968
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:56,205
Speaker 4:  This is, so I would love to get to a place where I could just take

969
00:56:56,405 --> 00:56:58,725
Speaker 4:  a phone outta the house depending on my mood.

970
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:04,615
Speaker 4:  Like sunglasses. Yeah. And it would just like have my phone number and take

971
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:08,095
Speaker 4:  my messages and like, I don't think any of the carriers or

972
00:57:08,865 --> 00:57:12,695
Speaker 4:  smartphone operating system vendors or smartphone makers want that to happen.

973
00:57:13,635 --> 00:57:16,055
Speaker 4:  And it, it's funny 'cause if it did happen, I would buy like six phones.

974
00:57:16,435 --> 00:57:16,935
Speaker 4:  So the,

975
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:20,935
Speaker 5:  The reason, it's, it's the carriers. I, I have been like meaning to write

976
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:24,335
Speaker 5:  a piece and I need to just sit down and write it that the reason dumb phones

977
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:28,415
Speaker 5:  won't work is because Verizon won't let them. I've had this moment

978
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:32,615
Speaker 5:  recently actually where I, I got the new iPad Pro and

979
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:35,775
Speaker 5:  just turned it on, logged into my iCloud account and all of a sudden I had

980
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:39,575
Speaker 5:  LTE on it and it was like the most magical

981
00:57:39,745 --> 00:57:43,415
Speaker 5:  experience. And it was, it was my data, it's connected to my account that

982
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:46,695
Speaker 5:  it was just like, it was like, oh, because all this EIM stuff works,

983
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:51,215
Speaker 5:  I just have all of my stuff on this new device and it is

984
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:55,175
Speaker 5:  connected through my account. And it's like, oh, that's how all of this should

985
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:58,655
Speaker 5:  work. And it just super doesn't, and even you go to a place like Europe where

986
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:00,895
Speaker 5:  like physical sim cards are much more important and you can just pop your

987
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:04,335
Speaker 5:  sim out and pop it into another thing and that kind of works. It's just not

988
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:08,295
Speaker 5:  how it works in the US and it sucks. And, and so as a result,

989
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:12,015
Speaker 5:  I think what light is trying to do is buy a phone that

990
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:16,255
Speaker 5:  actually becomes your primary device. Yeah. Like I think The,

991
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:20,415
Speaker 5:  Light, Phone plus laptop or light phone plus iPad

992
00:58:20,515 --> 00:58:23,375
Speaker 5:  is very much the thing that they're going for. They want you to have this

993
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:27,175
Speaker 5:  sort of simple minimal thing that goes in your pocket that has like

994
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:31,135
Speaker 5:  music and podcasts and directions and that's about it. And then if you wanna

995
00:58:31,135 --> 00:58:34,495
Speaker 5:  do more stuff, you sit down at something else. And I think in a certain way

996
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:37,415
Speaker 5:  that's actually like a much healthier way to use technology and to think

997
00:58:37,415 --> 00:58:41,255
Speaker 5:  about all of that. But it's probably, I mean, it's not probably,

998
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:43,535
Speaker 5:  it is definitely still not realistic for most people.

999
00:58:43,835 --> 00:58:47,775
Speaker 2:  Did they show you like the photo app? That's, I I just wanna know,

1000
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:50,375
Speaker 2:  is it showing photos in color or monochrome?

1001
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:53,895
Speaker 5:  I don't know. That's a really good question. I would assume it's showing

1002
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:57,815
Speaker 5:  them in monochrome. Yeah, because what, and he said

1003
00:58:57,815 --> 00:59:01,775
Speaker 5:  this very pointedly that they don't want you spending a lot

1004
00:59:01,775 --> 00:59:04,855
Speaker 5:  of time on your device looking at your photos. Apparently the thing that

1005
00:59:04,855 --> 00:59:07,095
Speaker 5:  they heard, one of the biggest reasons they put the camera on was to have

1006
00:59:07,495 --> 00:59:10,215
Speaker 5:  a QR code scanner that makes sense. And these people like to take pictures

1007
00:59:10,295 --> 00:59:13,735
Speaker 5:  of receipts and it's just like the little sort of toolsy things you need

1008
00:59:13,735 --> 00:59:16,975
Speaker 5:  to do with a camera rather than, I want a thing to take lots of beautiful

1009
00:59:16,975 --> 00:59:20,175
Speaker 5:  photos. They're like, their ideas again. Like you should not be looking at

1010
00:59:20,175 --> 00:59:23,445
Speaker 5:  your screen very often. Often. And even when you're looking at something

1011
00:59:23,445 --> 00:59:27,405
Speaker 5:  through it, you're still looking at it. Right. And so, yeah, the

1012
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:30,765
Speaker 5:  way he described it is like, it's about documenting, not about like

1013
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:35,005
Speaker 5:  fiddling. And so my, I, again, I haven't seen it, this thing's not shipping

1014
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:38,765
Speaker 5:  till next year, which is a real bummer, but Yeah, exactly.

1015
00:59:40,065 --> 00:59:44,045
Speaker 5:  But I think the, the idea definitely seems to be like, get

1016
00:59:44,045 --> 00:59:45,685
Speaker 5:  in and get out as quickly as possible.

1017
00:59:47,275 --> 00:59:50,935
Speaker 4:  I'm utterly fascinated by this, but it the, I just am laughing at the idea

1018
00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:54,855
Speaker 4:  that a good computing outcome is you have a pretty useless phone and then

1019
00:59:54,855 --> 00:59:58,735
Speaker 4:  an iPad and at some point you're just like, none of this shit can do anything.

1020
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:03,735
Speaker 4:  I mean, iPad is probably the wrong idea. I'm gonna sit down with this iPad

1021
01:00:03,795 --> 01:00:05,655
Speaker 4:  and not do a whole lot,

1022
01:00:08,195 --> 01:00:09,535
Speaker 2:  Not looking at Instagram on it.

1023
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:14,615
Speaker 4:  It's very good. I but but the idea that you would like pick up a phone and

1024
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:18,135
Speaker 4:  be like, push a button that's like, this is my phone right now. Take my calls,

1025
01:00:18,165 --> 01:00:21,575
Speaker 4:  send my messages. Yeah. You should be able to get there. Yes.

1026
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:26,295
Speaker 4:  But you, you can switch between laptops more easily than you can switch between

1027
01:00:26,295 --> 01:00:30,135
Speaker 4:  phones and some of it's carriers 'cause of phone numbers and where you gonna

1028
01:00:30,135 --> 01:00:33,255
Speaker 4:  route calls and some of it is RCS and iMessages and all that sort of thing.

1029
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:33,575
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But like,

1030
01:00:33,615 --> 01:00:36,935
Speaker 5:  I mean, even switching WhatsApp devices is a pan. It's gotten better

1031
01:00:37,515 --> 01:00:38,695
Speaker 5:  but it's still tough.

1032
01:00:39,675 --> 01:00:42,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But that is like ultimately the dream. And

1033
01:00:43,605 --> 01:00:47,125
Speaker 4:  I dunno, maybe Apple needs to make the cut down phone or just make it easier

1034
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,325
Speaker 4:  to put an iPhone into a mode like this. Apple

1035
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:53,245
Speaker 2:  Will never do that unless they can figure out the app. 30%. Yeah, just

1036
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:55,365
Speaker 4:  30%. Just like Tim for

1037
01:00:55,365 --> 01:00:59,205
Speaker 5:  $20 a month, we'll give you a chill phone inside of your

1038
01:00:59,205 --> 01:00:59,365
Speaker 5:  phone.

1039
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:02,805
Speaker 4:  You know, am GI given the interest in The, Light, Phone. Yeah.

1040
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:06,285
Speaker 5:  It's real. It might worth, it's worth a shot. So. Alright. Yeah, we should

1041
01:01:06,285 --> 01:01:09,125
Speaker 5:  keep going. Alex, the next thing on my list is literally, I should have just

1042
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:12,965
Speaker 5:  put these two links as just ask Crans. Is

1043
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:16,445
Speaker 5:  any of this anything, two different chip stories?

1044
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,045
Speaker 5:  One is basically media tech. Our, the, the

1045
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:24,645
Speaker 5:  flower of The Verge, our favorite chip company

1046
01:01:26,585 --> 01:01:30,285
Speaker 5:  is claiming it's out here doing Qualcomm level things and

1047
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:34,085
Speaker 5:  everybody is out here basically being like, we now have fast chips too.

1048
01:01:34,595 --> 01:01:38,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And then there was this company Flow Computing that just published

1049
01:01:38,485 --> 01:01:41,605
Speaker 5:  a white paper being like, we haven't made any of these chips, but we know

1050
01:01:41,605 --> 01:01:44,525
Speaker 5:  how to make chips that are a hundred times faster. Yeah.

1051
01:01:44,825 --> 01:01:48,565
Speaker 2:  The the, the flow thing is interesting in that they're basically

1052
01:01:48,565 --> 01:01:52,325
Speaker 2:  saying, we wanna compete with Arm and you, you

1053
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:52,925
Speaker 2:  buy our

1054
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:58,405
Speaker 2:  engineering that we have never actually proven. Oh. And then you go and you

1055
01:01:58,605 --> 01:01:59,525
Speaker 2:  engineer and do cool stuff.

1056
01:01:59,525 --> 01:02:01,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's my idea too. So

1057
01:02:01,365 --> 01:02:01,485
Speaker 2:  I

1058
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:04,845
Speaker 4:  Look, if you want to make a chip that's a hundred times faster, you just

1059
01:02:04,845 --> 01:02:07,205
Speaker 4:  come talk to me and then you do the work. Yep.

1060
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:11,245
Speaker 2:  But, but, but Neely's gonna be like, yeah, that looks good. Yeah.

1061
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:13,845
Speaker 2:  Good job. Good

1062
01:02:13,845 --> 01:02:16,485
Speaker 4:  Job. But you have an idea for a building. Thank you for building, if you

1063
01:02:16,485 --> 01:02:19,845
Speaker 4:  bring your architect to me, I will describe that building to them an extraordinary

1064
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:20,485
Speaker 4:  deep step. Well it's

1065
01:02:20,485 --> 01:02:23,525
Speaker 2:  Kinda like they are the architects and now they're looking for someone to

1066
01:02:23,525 --> 01:02:24,245
Speaker 2:  go build the building.

1067
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:27,845
Speaker 4:  No, that's, that's normal. That's much more normal than I think what this

1068
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:28,005
Speaker 4:  is.

1069
01:02:28,475 --> 01:02:31,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. I guess it is in a weird spot, huh? Yeah. And I don't know what

1070
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:32,085
Speaker 2:  the comparison is.

1071
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:35,085
Speaker 4:  It's, it's one level away from like we've done it. Yeah. and more like we

1072
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,925
Speaker 4:  have an idea we we for how to do it. Yeah.

1073
01:02:38,105 --> 01:02:40,725
Speaker 2:  We, we know the architect firm we wanna hire

1074
01:02:41,905 --> 01:02:42,125
Speaker 4:  And

1075
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:46,205
Speaker 2:  And it's you and it's you. And then also can you find someone to build this.

1076
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:50,165
Speaker 2:  Yes. So yeah, that one is very interesting. Their, their claims are really,

1077
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:53,165
Speaker 2:  really big. I know a lot of people are talking about it right now and trying

1078
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:57,125
Speaker 2:  to figure out if it is an anything and I think it's a little bit of the

1079
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,325
Speaker 2:  verdict is still out there.

1080
01:02:58,465 --> 01:03:02,325
Speaker 4:  So, but the idea here is that they have a new thing Yeah. Parallel

1081
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:06,215
Speaker 4:  processing unit that it can be inside or outside the

1082
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:10,145
Speaker 4:  chip and you can run parallel

1083
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:13,825
Speaker 4:  workloads through that much faster Right. Than any other chip that exists

1084
01:03:13,825 --> 01:03:15,945
Speaker 4:  today. Right. This is the core of the claim.

1085
01:03:16,365 --> 01:03:20,305
Speaker 2:  Yes. But, and it's also weird 'cause parallel processing is having

1086
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:23,905
Speaker 2:  kind of a moment right now or like people are re rethinking it.

1087
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:28,665
Speaker 2:  So there's just, I I wanna say verdict is still a little

1088
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:29,505
Speaker 2:  out on this

1089
01:03:31,745 --> 01:03:34,755
Speaker 2:  just because most of like, I I know enough to be like, Hmm,

1090
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:40,195
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I'm gonna stay in that head space until proven otherwise. Yeah. But

1091
01:03:40,235 --> 01:03:43,275
Speaker 5:  I think the, the media tech thing potentially

1092
01:03:44,355 --> 01:03:47,435
Speaker 5:  exciting. Like there's no reason everyone couldn't start making good arm

1093
01:03:47,435 --> 01:03:50,755
Speaker 5:  chips. Like if this is the thing that's out there, more power to

1094
01:03:50,955 --> 01:03:54,475
Speaker 2:  'em. Look, anytime somebody is saying, Hey let's compete, that's always good.

1095
01:03:54,475 --> 01:03:57,995
Speaker 2:  Right? Even though it's media tech and they are not known for their super

1096
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:02,355
Speaker 2:  powerful processors. This is, it's it's gonna be

1097
01:04:02,825 --> 01:04:05,675
Speaker 2:  kind of cool because they're saying that that they'll be as fast, they'll

1098
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:09,395
Speaker 2:  be capable of doing copilot PCs and that means that they have to do at

1099
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:13,355
Speaker 2:  their NPU has to do at least 40 tops. And while we

1100
01:04:13,355 --> 01:04:15,755
Speaker 2:  still don't fully understand what Tops means in this context,

1101
01:04:17,425 --> 01:04:21,275
Speaker 2:  that is still like 40 is the number Microsoft gave everybody.

1102
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:24,635
Speaker 2:  Sure. And so if, if media tech can get there when, like even Apple, the M

1103
01:04:24,635 --> 01:04:26,435
Speaker 2:  four, they were claiming 38. So

1104
01:04:28,485 --> 01:04:31,865
Speaker 2:  if Media Tech can do that, cool. Great.

1105
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:35,265
Speaker 2:  Will companies put this in? We'll see. What

1106
01:04:35,265 --> 01:04:36,945
Speaker 5:  Are your thoughts on tops in this context? Neli.

1107
01:04:37,925 --> 01:04:38,465
Speaker 4:  Wow you guys,

1108
01:04:42,265 --> 01:04:45,985
Speaker 4:  I know what you can do with 13 Tops. Yeah. I've been given

1109
01:04:46,085 --> 01:04:47,465
Speaker 4:  an answer. You

1110
01:04:47,465 --> 01:04:48,265
Speaker 2:  Go to Fire Island.

1111
01:04:58,455 --> 01:05:00,105
Speaker 5:  Well there's the title of the episode today.

1112
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:04,265
Speaker 4:  No, no I do, I actually have a real non Yeah.

1113
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:06,625
Speaker 2:  What what is

1114
01:05:07,065 --> 01:05:08,025
Speaker 4:  13 family friendly answer.

1115
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:11,665
Speaker 2:  What is 13 trillions operations per second.

1116
01:05:11,965 --> 01:05:14,305
Speaker 4:  So we had, we had, someone wrote to us

1117
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:18,765
Speaker 4:  not about the other interpretation of what you can do with an incremental

1118
01:05:18,765 --> 01:05:21,605
Speaker 5:  Talk. Well we should say lots of people wrote to us about the other interpretation.

1119
01:05:21,805 --> 01:05:21,965
Speaker 5:  Thank

1120
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:24,645
Speaker 4:  You guys. Yeah. Lots of people made jokes about one thing.

1121
01:05:26,165 --> 01:05:29,685
Speaker 4:  Although I will say that no, regardless of context, no one has said what

1122
01:05:29,685 --> 01:05:33,605
Speaker 4:  you can do going from 35 to 38, just saying that's fair. Hasn't been proven

1123
01:05:33,605 --> 01:05:36,885
Speaker 4:  out yet. But hey, the Raspberry Pi has

1124
01:05:37,285 --> 01:05:41,125
Speaker 4:  13 trillion operations for set. We were like, why? And so we got a

1125
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:44,725
Speaker 4:  an email from Scott and he's like, look, there are lots of

1126
01:05:44,985 --> 01:05:48,205
Speaker 4:  iot applications where you have a sensor and then you have like something

1127
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:51,885
Speaker 4:  like a camera and you want to know what happened. So the sensor

1128
01:05:51,955 --> 01:05:55,605
Speaker 4:  detects motion in a parking lot and you're like, is that the right car? And

1129
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:59,085
Speaker 4:  you can take a picture of the camera so the sensor fires the camera and then

1130
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:02,965
Speaker 4:  you gotta send a bunch of data somewhere to do image recognition. And

1131
01:06:02,965 --> 01:06:06,325
Speaker 4:  if you can bring it down to the edge, you're only sending bytes of data instead

1132
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:07,245
Speaker 4:  of megabytes of data. Hmm.

1133
01:06:07,675 --> 01:06:08,645
Speaker 2:  Okay. That's

1134
01:06:08,645 --> 01:06:09,965
Speaker 5:  Cool. That's a good one. That's

1135
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:10,645
Speaker 4:  A good one. That's

1136
01:06:10,645 --> 01:06:11,525
Speaker 2:  Extremely good. Yeah.

1137
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:13,165
Speaker 4:  Good. I'll take it. Here we

1138
01:06:13,165 --> 01:06:13,725
Speaker 5:  Go. Yeah,

1139
01:06:15,085 --> 01:06:18,325
Speaker 4:  I think the idea that there is some sort of like race

1140
01:06:19,425 --> 01:06:23,285
Speaker 4:  to put all of like that's great. That's a great workload.

1141
01:06:23,365 --> 01:06:26,965
Speaker 4:  I like, I like it. Yeah. You can see how people can do all this stuff in

1142
01:06:26,965 --> 01:06:30,225
Speaker 4:  all kinds of places, but Microsoft is like,

1143
01:06:30,815 --> 01:06:33,945
Speaker 4:  this is how many you need. Yeah. My Microsoft and they haven't de they have

1144
01:06:33,945 --> 01:06:37,465
Speaker 4:  not done even that example, we can detect a car.

1145
01:06:38,855 --> 01:06:42,625
Speaker 4:  Like that's the, that's fundamentally the example. We, this computer

1146
01:06:42,645 --> 01:06:46,065
Speaker 4:  can now recognize a car in a parking lot. Microsoft has not come up with

1147
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:49,185
Speaker 4:  one of those things on a Windows PC for consumers that matters yet.

1148
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:51,185
Speaker 2:  I can recognize a car in a parking lot too.

1149
01:06:51,685 --> 01:06:54,305
Speaker 4:  So many people can recognize a car in a parking lot. Yeah.

1150
01:06:54,465 --> 01:06:54,905
Speaker 2:  A lot of them.

1151
01:06:55,735 --> 01:06:59,065
Speaker 4:  It's true. But Microsoft is just out there being like,

1152
01:06:59,835 --> 01:07:02,975
Speaker 4:  you need this many 'cause it's gonna unlock what exactly

1153
01:07:03,555 --> 01:07:06,775
Speaker 2:  The future down the line. Don't, not right now. Just

1154
01:07:07,475 --> 01:07:08,375
Speaker 2:  the future. Just look over

1155
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:08,495
Speaker 4:  That

1156
01:07:10,085 --> 01:07:14,015
Speaker 5:  Last thing we should talk about before we take a break is this bit of Google

1157
01:07:14,165 --> 01:07:16,695
Speaker 5:  news that is either

1158
01:07:18,045 --> 01:07:21,765
Speaker 5:  a small piece of news that ultimately doesn't matter that much or

1159
01:07:22,225 --> 01:07:26,205
Speaker 5:  the like little tiny butterfly flap of something sort

1160
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:30,085
Speaker 5:  of enormous. And basically the news is Google

1161
01:07:30,085 --> 01:07:34,005
Speaker 5:  announced that it's going to be putting a lot more of the underlying

1162
01:07:34,035 --> 01:07:37,325
Speaker 5:  Android stack inside of Chrome os. So essentially

1163
01:07:38,265 --> 01:07:42,005
Speaker 5:  slowly but surely they're going to build Chrome OS to

1164
01:07:42,205 --> 01:07:45,165
Speaker 5:  resemble Android in such a way that they can build stuff faster that will

1165
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:49,485
Speaker 5:  work on both platforms. I find this fascinating because there are

1166
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:53,445
Speaker 5:  lots of rumors that say essentially, well I mean there have been rumors for

1167
01:07:53,455 --> 01:07:57,045
Speaker 5:  Jesus like a decade saying that Google is going to merge

1168
01:07:57,385 --> 01:08:00,685
Speaker 5:  Chrome OS and Android. Isn't that, was that fuchsia? I can never remember

1169
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:04,405
Speaker 5:  all the code names. Okay. So there was fuchsia, which was I think even showed

1170
01:08:04,525 --> 01:08:08,245
Speaker 5:  up on like a random Nest device or something and then that got killed. But

1171
01:08:08,245 --> 01:08:11,045
Speaker 5:  these things have been separate projects that should never have been separate

1172
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:14,765
Speaker 5:  projects. And then there have been rumors that there's going to be some

1173
01:08:14,885 --> 01:08:18,445
Speaker 5:  combination of them that gives you like a desktop mode on your Android phone

1174
01:08:18,445 --> 01:08:21,885
Speaker 5:  that essentially looks like Chrome os. And it's just all these little pieces

1175
01:08:22,025 --> 01:08:25,325
Speaker 5:  are coming together that is like, maybe we're actually gonna get this

1176
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:29,325
Speaker 5:  cross device single thing combination that we should have had a really long

1177
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:29,685
Speaker 5:  time ago.

1178
01:08:30,775 --> 01:08:33,275
Speaker 4:  Boy, do I disagree with you? Really tell me. Yeah.

1179
01:08:33,525 --> 01:08:33,875
Speaker 2:  Fight.

1180
01:08:34,385 --> 01:08:37,555
Speaker 4:  Well I mean it, it all just comes down to like how complicated you want a

1181
01:08:37,555 --> 01:08:41,395
Speaker 4:  Chromebook to be in the end, right? So like an Android phone

1182
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:46,515
Speaker 4:  is a lot, right? It has like a full app model. It has a bunch of capabilities.

1183
01:08:47,575 --> 01:08:51,195
Speaker 4:  It is just a, it has interface. Metaphors a

1184
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:55,795
Speaker 4:  right, it's, it's more of a computer arguably than a Chromebook. Yeah. Which

1185
01:08:56,145 --> 01:08:59,795
Speaker 4:  initially was Linux running Chrome. Yep. And the whole

1186
01:08:59,965 --> 01:09:03,875
Speaker 4:  model was like, all you need is a browser. Then I think

1187
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:06,675
Speaker 4:  they realized, and I, and I think that's great. I think for a lot of people

1188
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:10,555
Speaker 4:  that is actually what you need. Yep. But then you gotta add things like windowing

1189
01:09:10,635 --> 01:09:12,995
Speaker 4:  and background apps and blah, blah, blah blah, blah. And you end up being

1190
01:09:12,995 --> 01:09:16,675
Speaker 4:  like, ah, shit, we made a computer. Like now this thing is just windows with

1191
01:09:16,675 --> 01:09:20,635
Speaker 4:  the app model. Instead of win 32 is Chrome. And then you're

1192
01:09:20,635 --> 01:09:23,115
Speaker 4:  like, ah, but we have this other thing. We should let it run Android apps.

1193
01:09:23,495 --> 01:09:26,435
Speaker 4:  Oh we need to put Google now in here because that's what we decided to announce

1194
01:09:26,435 --> 01:09:30,315
Speaker 4:  it. I you're like whatever. And you just like end up junking up Chrome os.

1195
01:09:31,405 --> 01:09:34,425
Speaker 4:  And so then you come to this like final place where you're like, it's just

1196
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:35,385
Speaker 4:  an Android laptop.

1197
01:09:36,175 --> 01:09:36,465
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1198
01:09:37,295 --> 01:09:40,945
Speaker 4:  Okay. Like fine. But you're just, I think you're just so

1199
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:44,465
Speaker 4:  far afield of the initial vision for that product.

1200
01:09:45,285 --> 01:09:46,825
Speaker 2:  But the initial vision for that product

1201
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:52,605
Speaker 2:  was kind of bad in that. Not, not, not like the, the just

1202
01:09:52,675 --> 01:09:55,645
Speaker 2:  this is a browser go forth. I think that was a great vision.

1203
01:09:56,395 --> 01:10:00,335
Speaker 2:  Execution was bad because it was always like,

1204
01:10:00,595 --> 01:10:03,855
Speaker 2:  oh, the idea was that it's only the browser, therefore it's super cheap.

1205
01:10:04,715 --> 01:10:08,455
Speaker 2:  But that cheapness also meant your monitor was garbage. Yep.

1206
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:11,615
Speaker 2:  Your keyboard was garbage. Everything was garbage. And so people kept saying,

1207
01:10:11,615 --> 01:10:14,935
Speaker 2:  well I want a more power. Like I don't want it to be garbage. I would like

1208
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:17,615
Speaker 2:  a pretty display. And they're like, okay, well that's gonna cost you more

1209
01:10:17,615 --> 01:10:19,055
Speaker 2:  money. And so it just kind of creeped up.

1210
01:10:19,105 --> 01:10:22,095
Speaker 5:  Right. And then you go, oh, what? But it's only a browser. Why would I pay

1211
01:10:22,095 --> 01:10:24,175
Speaker 5:  all that money? And then back it

1212
01:10:24,175 --> 01:10:28,135
Speaker 2:  Was, it was always this, this fight back and forth. And so it was, I think

1213
01:10:28,135 --> 01:10:30,895
Speaker 2:  for a long time it's been like, well just, just make it Android guys. Come

1214
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:34,535
Speaker 2:  on. Like stop, stop messing around. You're not, you're not doing this other

1215
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:37,975
Speaker 2:  thing. That was a really cool idea. That doesn't

1216
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:42,255
Speaker 2:  actually exist in a world where you have different partners who want money

1217
01:10:42,315 --> 01:10:44,975
Speaker 2:  for the things they provide you to put into that computer.

1218
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:48,295
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, look, I is one of the few people in the world who's ever bought

1219
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:52,255
Speaker 4:  a thousand dollars Chromebook Pixel. It worked really well when

1220
01:10:52,255 --> 01:10:56,215
Speaker 4:  you threw Windows, like high-end windows horsepower at it.

1221
01:10:56,215 --> 01:11:00,175
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like that Chromebook Pixel I believe an I five. Yeah. Like 16

1222
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:01,335
Speaker 4:  gigs of ramp. That

1223
01:11:01,335 --> 01:11:01,655
Speaker 2:  Thing was

1224
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:05,135
Speaker 4:  So good. It was beast. It was, it was great for its time. It's still going.

1225
01:11:05,155 --> 01:11:08,495
Speaker 4:  My mom still uses it, but no one's gonna spend that much money. 'cause then

1226
01:11:08,495 --> 01:11:12,375
Speaker 4:  you think you need a, a whole computer. But I would challenge you, I'm looking

1227
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:16,045
Speaker 4:  at my Mac right now, it's running Chrome and then like mostly electronics.

1228
01:11:16,045 --> 01:11:16,245
Speaker 4:  Oh

1229
01:11:16,245 --> 01:11:18,405
Speaker 2:  My God. The files, you gotta, you're

1230
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:20,365
Speaker 4:  Just, that's just screenshots. You can make 'em go away.

1231
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:23,805
Speaker 2:  Oh my God. That was, it's really upsetting. Oh, that's be okay. I'm

1232
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:27,245
Speaker 4:  Better now. It was just, it was just an open stack of screenshots. But like

1233
01:11:27,305 --> 01:11:31,245
Speaker 4:  the only native app really in my doc is Lightroom. And like most people

1234
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,525
Speaker 4:  are not running Lightroom. Yeah. And you just look at that, you're like,

1235
01:11:33,525 --> 01:11:36,925
Speaker 4:  oh, this is just a bunch of electron apps. Fine.

1236
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:41,085
Speaker 4:  But I don't think Google, I mean Google like, what else do I have to say?

1237
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:44,285
Speaker 4:  Like, is there, they never ran the idea to completion and used the ecosystem.

1238
01:11:44,505 --> 01:11:48,405
Speaker 4:  So now they're shuffling up all those teams. Right. Dave Burke, who ran

1239
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:52,325
Speaker 4:  Android for a long time is gone as that's today that news broke

1240
01:11:52,325 --> 01:11:55,685
Speaker 4:  today. Hiroshi, who was in charge of the whole thing left.

1241
01:11:56,595 --> 01:12:00,145
Speaker 4:  Right. He's, he's off finding himself on some other projects at Google

1242
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:04,705
Speaker 4:  and like they're, they're just shuffling up those teams and this seems like

1243
01:12:04,705 --> 01:12:08,505
Speaker 4:  a natural outcome of that. Yeah. You'll recall like they, a

1244
01:12:08,505 --> 01:12:11,225
Speaker 4:  year ago or two years ago, they were like, Android tablets are gonna make

1245
01:12:11,225 --> 01:12:14,545
Speaker 4:  a comeback 'cause of folding devices. Hmm.

1246
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:18,745
Speaker 5:  Hey, the Pixel tablet is cooler than people think. That's, that's my hot

1247
01:12:18,745 --> 01:12:22,625
Speaker 5:  take for the day. But I will say, I mean on this front, I think go the Google

1248
01:12:22,735 --> 01:12:26,705
Speaker 5:  sort of stated reason for doing this is it lets them roll out AI stuff across

1249
01:12:26,705 --> 01:12:30,545
Speaker 5:  these two platforms faster. And I think that's fair,

1250
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:33,505
Speaker 5:  right? Like you, you look at some of the stuff Google's already doing with

1251
01:12:33,505 --> 01:12:37,145
Speaker 5:  Chromebook plus devices like the, it has the generative AI

1252
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:41,025
Speaker 5:  wallpaper and the magic editor in Google photos. Like that's stuff you

1253
01:12:41,025 --> 01:12:44,825
Speaker 5:  want to do on device as much as you can. And so building that

1254
01:12:44,855 --> 01:12:47,705
Speaker 5:  into the stack for both of those platforms makes a lot of sense.

1255
01:12:48,935 --> 01:12:52,665
Speaker 5:  Nila, to your point, I'm, I'm very bullish about this combination for

1256
01:12:52,695 --> 01:12:56,185
Speaker 5:  Android phones and I'm very skeptical about it for Chromebooks. Yeah. So

1257
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,265
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm kind of with you in that, like, the idea of being able to

1258
01:13:00,095 --> 01:13:03,705
Speaker 5:  blow up my Android phone, whether it's for Android tablets or

1259
01:13:03,705 --> 01:13:07,505
Speaker 5:  foldable devices or whatever, like a thing that gets more chromeo se the

1260
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:11,385
Speaker 5:  bigger it gets, I find very compelling. But a, a Chromebook that looks

1261
01:13:11,385 --> 01:13:15,225
Speaker 5:  more like Android is an experiment that Google has tried many times and it

1262
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:16,545
Speaker 5:  has typically gone very badly.

1263
01:13:16,955 --> 01:13:19,505
Speaker 4:  Right. 'cause Android developers do not want to put their apps on a laptop

1264
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:20,665
Speaker 4:  in that way. Right.

1265
01:13:20,765 --> 01:13:24,425
Speaker 5:  And, and it's, and it requires a huge amount of work to do it well. And when

1266
01:13:24,425 --> 01:13:26,865
Speaker 5:  you don't do it well, it kind of sucks and it mostly doesn't get done well.

1267
01:13:26,925 --> 01:13:30,825
Speaker 5:  And I, I yeah. So I agree. I think this is a, a thing that for

1268
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,825
Speaker 5:  Chromebooks is gonna be complicated

1269
01:13:35,045 --> 01:13:38,345
Speaker 5:  if we are in fact getting this sort of big combined

1270
01:13:38,895 --> 01:13:42,865
Speaker 5:  user interface thing that might happen here or Google

1271
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:45,745
Speaker 5:  is telling the truth and this is just like the bottom of the tech stack so

1272
01:13:45,745 --> 01:13:49,265
Speaker 5:  that they can get Gmails help me write to run

1273
01:13:49,455 --> 01:13:52,265
Speaker 5:  4% faster on your Chrome. Yeah. I just, which is fine.

1274
01:13:52,655 --> 01:13:56,065
Speaker 2:  Love the idea that they're gonna put like full Android on a, on a Chromebook

1275
01:13:56,085 --> 01:14:00,025
Speaker 2:  and then just completely dumb it down. Just like No, you only open the

1276
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,705
Speaker 2:  Chrome app. That would be hysterical.

1277
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:03,465
Speaker 4:  They've they've been there before. Yeah.

1278
01:14:03,525 --> 01:14:07,465
Speaker 5:  You know what's funny about that is the Chrome app for Android is so,

1279
01:14:07,725 --> 01:14:11,565
Speaker 5:  so, so much worse than Chrome on Chromebooks that

1280
01:14:11,565 --> 01:14:15,525
Speaker 5:  like that what an unbelievable Chromebook down downgrade that would be if

1281
01:14:15,525 --> 01:14:15,805
Speaker 5:  they did

1282
01:14:15,805 --> 01:14:19,165
Speaker 4:  That. Yeah. Because they had to make Chrome on Chromebook a real browser.

1283
01:14:19,295 --> 01:14:21,285
Speaker 4:  Right. 'cause that is the application model.

1284
01:14:21,285 --> 01:14:23,045
Speaker 5:  It's the best version of Chrome that exists in the world.

1285
01:14:23,155 --> 01:14:27,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I know a lot of designers who run Figma in expensive Chromebooks. Hmm.

1286
01:14:27,025 --> 01:14:30,925
Speaker 4:  Oh interesting. And expensive is like a but they, but

1287
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:34,445
Speaker 4:  they just like don't have MacBooks anymore. They're just like, we just run,

1288
01:14:34,545 --> 01:14:38,325
Speaker 4:  we live in Figma. We might as well have a Chromebook or some of 'em have

1289
01:14:38,325 --> 01:14:41,685
Speaker 4:  Chrome boxes that Chrome desktop fancy monitors and that's just the end of

1290
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:44,925
Speaker 4:  that. And it's like, that's the application model. And if you bring a browser

1291
01:14:44,945 --> 01:14:48,925
Speaker 4:  of that capability to a phone or a tablet, you

1292
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:52,805
Speaker 4:  can't take your 30% anymore. Yep. And that, and that's why the iPad

1293
01:14:52,805 --> 01:14:55,485
Speaker 4:  browser sucks everybody. Yep. All the way around.

1294
01:14:56,625 --> 01:15:00,525
Speaker 4:  And that's also why Android tablets have the not great version of

1295
01:15:00,525 --> 01:15:03,525
Speaker 4:  Chrome. Instead of the Chromebook version of Chrome. There's no reason a

1296
01:15:03,885 --> 01:15:07,845
Speaker 4:  powerful Samsung tablet shouldn't run full on Chrome. Same

1297
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:10,925
Speaker 4:  business pressure exists. Yeah. Anyway, that's totally separate. It's

1298
01:15:10,925 --> 01:15:11,125
Speaker 11:  Fine.

1299
01:15:12,345 --> 01:15:14,405
Speaker 4:  30% Bring me a suitcase

1300
01:15:16,325 --> 01:15:20,165
Speaker 4:  actually. Apple and Google. I would pay a subscription fee for a full

1301
01:15:20,195 --> 01:15:23,485
Speaker 4:  desktop class browser on my mobile devices. That'd be one thing

1302
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:27,365
Speaker 4:  You want to get me to pay a subscription fee for Apple One or Google One.

1303
01:15:28,305 --> 01:15:30,205
Speaker 2:  But what if it's the same garbage?

1304
01:15:30,945 --> 01:15:32,805
Speaker 4:  No, it has to be the good. It has to be the good browser.

1305
01:15:33,315 --> 01:15:34,725
Speaker 11:  Alright. Arc.

1306
01:15:35,755 --> 01:15:39,325
Speaker 5:  What if instead of a browser, it's just a chat bot that lies to you?

1307
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:41,245
Speaker 5:  Can I interest you in that

1308
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:41,915
Speaker 4:  horniness in the history of The

1309
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:29,515
Speaker 4:  I'll sell out. You just tell me what to say. You show up. No one's

1310
01:18:29,515 --> 01:18:32,275
Speaker 4:  fired the gun. It's a problem. All right, David, what's your lightning round

1311
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:32,475
Speaker 4:  item?

1312
01:18:33,795 --> 01:18:37,755
Speaker 5:  I think I wanna talk about this survey that Pew did about how

1313
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:41,515
Speaker 5:  people get news on social media platforms. We've talked

1314
01:18:41,745 --> 01:18:45,395
Speaker 5:  obviously a lot about this. This is like, the only thing anyone on

1315
01:18:45,395 --> 01:18:49,315
Speaker 5:  Threads ever talks about is news on threads. Because Adam, Ari like keeps

1316
01:18:49,315 --> 01:18:52,235
Speaker 5:  saying how much he hates news, but loves news but hates it, but doesn't want

1317
01:18:52,235 --> 01:18:55,475
Speaker 5:  it, but loves it. And so Pew did a study

1318
01:18:55,825 --> 01:18:59,635
Speaker 5:  basically looking at four platforms. So it was X,

1319
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:02,635
Speaker 5:  TikTok, Facebook and Instagram and essentially asked people,

1320
01:19:03,735 --> 01:19:07,475
Speaker 5:  do you get news on this platform? And is it like a primary reason

1321
01:19:07,935 --> 01:19:11,835
Speaker 5:  you come here? And the numbers are sort

1322
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,355
Speaker 5:  of fascinating. Like in almost every case, like I'm looking at this now,

1323
01:19:14,585 --> 01:19:18,435
Speaker 5:  over 80% of people on all platforms see news content

1324
01:19:18,735 --> 01:19:21,795
Speaker 5:  on all four of those platforms. So like on on X

1325
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:26,435
Speaker 5:  they call it news related content. And it's, it's sort of like news and news

1326
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:30,555
Speaker 5:  adjacent things. And 92% of people on X reported seeing

1327
01:19:30,555 --> 01:19:34,235
Speaker 5:  it. It was 90 and 91 for TikTok and Facebook, Instagram the lowest at 82%.

1328
01:19:34,735 --> 01:19:38,675
Speaker 5:  All huge numbers. But in almost every

1329
01:19:38,675 --> 01:19:42,635
Speaker 5:  case, most people said it's not the primary reason they

1330
01:19:42,635 --> 01:19:46,155
Speaker 5:  go to the platform. X was the exception. Two thirds of people said it was

1331
01:19:46,155 --> 01:19:49,515
Speaker 5:  either a, I think it was a major or minor reason to go. But

1332
01:19:49,895 --> 01:19:53,875
Speaker 5:  TikTok, Facebook and Instagram all somewhere between like 30 and 40% of people

1333
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:56,995
Speaker 5:  said that's even a reason they think about going to those platforms,

1334
01:19:57,605 --> 01:20:01,035
Speaker 5:  which I just think is very telling. Right. We talk a lot about news and these

1335
01:20:01,275 --> 01:20:04,155
Speaker 5:  companies keep telling us news is a tiny percentage of what people do and

1336
01:20:04,155 --> 01:20:06,675
Speaker 5:  people don't actually care and they're not here for news. And the only people

1337
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:10,085
Speaker 5:  who care about news are the people who report on the news. And everybody

1338
01:20:10,085 --> 01:20:14,045
Speaker 5:  should just shut up about the news for once. And this was, I just thought

1339
01:20:14,045 --> 01:20:17,965
Speaker 5:  this was a really interesting way of looking at that. And Pew

1340
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:21,405
Speaker 5:  has also come out and said over and over and over again that for young people

1341
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:24,405
Speaker 5:  in particular, TikTok is where they're seeing a lot of their news. Even if

1342
01:20:24,405 --> 01:20:28,245
Speaker 5:  they're not seeking it out, that's how news finds them. So there's like a,

1343
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:31,805
Speaker 5:  there's just the amount of like accidental news consumption that is happening

1344
01:20:31,805 --> 01:20:35,205
Speaker 5:  on social media right now, just fascinates me. Especially in an election

1345
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:38,365
Speaker 5:  year. All of this is gonna get very weird. I just thought it was really interesting.

1346
01:20:38,365 --> 01:20:41,725
Speaker 2:  Well, particularly because the news isn't always

1347
01:20:43,925 --> 01:20:45,085
Speaker 2:  packaged well.

1348
01:20:46,065 --> 01:20:46,885
Speaker 4:  No. Right?

1349
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:50,765
Speaker 2:  Like, like it's always, it's it's frequently packaged in to, to get you

1350
01:20:50,765 --> 01:20:51,845
Speaker 2:  as upset as possible.

1351
01:20:52,065 --> 01:20:54,365
Speaker 4:  Can I, can I just like roll this into my lightning red item?

1352
01:20:54,395 --> 01:20:55,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, go for it.

1353
01:20:56,305 --> 01:21:00,245
Speaker 4:  So mine is a bunch of Elon stuff. So one is just a victory

1354
01:21:00,265 --> 01:21:04,165
Speaker 4:  lap for me. Elon drops his lawsuit against opening. I shocking. 'cause he

1355
01:21:04,165 --> 01:21:06,845
Speaker 4:  didn't have a contract and I super told you so. And you can't

1356
01:21:06,845 --> 01:21:09,325
Speaker 5:  Reach a contract. You don't have would, would you say that's a fair legal

1357
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:12,725
Speaker 4:  Reason and that literally, I, when back looks at that post hundreds of comments

1358
01:21:12,725 --> 01:21:15,285
Speaker 4:  being like, you can assemble a contract on it. And it's like, no, you can't.

1359
01:21:15,985 --> 01:21:18,045
Speaker 4:  You just can't. You have, and if you could, you you would

1360
01:21:20,425 --> 01:21:22,245
Speaker 5:  If he wanted to he would. He. Yeah.

1361
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:26,125
Speaker 4:  Right. I'm just saying he he did, he didn't.

1362
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:30,565
Speaker 4:  So whatever, if you wanna sue someone, come up with

1363
01:21:30,605 --> 01:21:34,485
Speaker 4:  a good idea. One, but two bunch of

1364
01:21:34,485 --> 01:21:38,325
Speaker 4:  stuff about SpaceX this week, the culture at SpaceX, that actions

1365
01:21:38,325 --> 01:21:41,925
Speaker 4:  towards women at SpaceX, the, the sexist culture at SpaceX

1366
01:21:43,305 --> 01:21:46,845
Speaker 4:  in two stories. Yeah. One, the Wall Street Journal big expose,

1367
01:21:47,345 --> 01:21:50,845
Speaker 4:  talked to a number of people and then the, the second one,

1368
01:21:51,485 --> 01:21:54,605
Speaker 4:  a lawsuit from former SpaceX employees saying it's a culture of harassment.

1369
01:21:55,425 --> 01:21:59,325
Speaker 4:  We wrote them both up. Right. What you do. And the headline

1370
01:21:59,345 --> 01:22:02,925
Speaker 4:  we wrote on the Wall Street Journal one was not as just

1371
01:22:03,615 --> 01:22:07,525
Speaker 4:  aggressive as people wanted. And I got tweets about it and I was like,

1372
01:22:07,665 --> 01:22:11,285
Speaker 4:  we have to be really careful when we write these headlines, especially

1373
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:15,605
Speaker 4:  when it's not our reporting. Right. We're we're talking about a Wall Street

1374
01:22:15,605 --> 01:22:19,165
Speaker 4:  Journal story. And if you look at the Wall Street Journal story, the journal

1375
01:22:19,165 --> 01:22:23,125
Speaker 4:  story is very carefully reported and it's mostly about

1376
01:22:23,225 --> 01:22:27,045
Speaker 4:  one woman, an intern who lawyered up with

1377
01:22:27,105 --> 01:22:31,005
Speaker 4:  the same lawyer as Elon and SpaceX to

1378
01:22:31,145 --> 01:22:34,855
Speaker 4:  refute the story. And she sent a bunch of affidavits in

1379
01:22:35,225 --> 01:22:38,975
Speaker 4:  which confirms some of the reporting of the story. But she's like, none of

1380
01:22:38,975 --> 01:22:41,895
Speaker 4:  this is true. Which is weird. Like the construction of that story is weird.

1381
01:22:42,395 --> 01:22:45,815
Speaker 4:  And the thing you're saying, David, is like people encounter their news and

1382
01:22:45,815 --> 01:22:48,775
Speaker 4:  then the thing Alex is saying is that news is not, that news is not packaged

1383
01:22:48,845 --> 01:22:52,775
Speaker 4:  well. Right. What everyone wanted us to say was

1384
01:22:52,775 --> 01:22:52,935
Speaker 4:  like,

1385
01:22:54,605 --> 01:22:55,375
Speaker 2:  Elon did look.

1386
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:58,575
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Look at, look at how bad this is. And indeed there's a lot of bad stuff

1387
01:22:58,575 --> 01:23:01,255
Speaker 4:  in there if you rolling around your own company being like, will you have

1388
01:23:01,255 --> 01:23:04,855
Speaker 4:  my babies? Don't do that. And then you retaliate against the women who say

1389
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:08,725
Speaker 4:  no. Like that is very bad when the president of your company who's a woman,

1390
01:23:09,135 --> 01:23:12,645
Speaker 4:  retaliates against a woman who was helping to plan your birthday party

1391
01:23:13,275 --> 01:23:16,765
Speaker 4:  because she suspected that the phone call from the husband to the woman

1392
01:23:17,145 --> 01:23:20,925
Speaker 4:  was evidence of an affair as opposed to the planning of a birthday

1393
01:23:20,925 --> 01:23:24,605
Speaker 4:  party. That's bananas. Yeah. Maybe that should have been our

1394
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:28,725
Speaker 4:  headline like birthday party affair situation at SpaceX

1395
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:29,365
Speaker 4:  Bananas.

1396
01:23:31,385 --> 01:23:34,885
Speaker 4:  But this tendency to overread the news for maximum

1397
01:23:34,955 --> 01:23:38,765
Speaker 4:  emotional value or to assign some emotional value

1398
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:42,725
Speaker 4:  to something, even if that's not what the evidence of the news, like that

1399
01:23:42,725 --> 01:23:46,445
Speaker 4:  is the thing social media does. It is in particular the thing that

1400
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:50,125
Speaker 4:  Threads does because that is how you get engagement in that algorithm. So

1401
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,325
Speaker 4:  there's no news there. Adam Ary is like,

1402
01:23:52,705 --> 01:23:53,285
Speaker 2:  We refuse.

1403
01:23:53,715 --> 01:23:57,045
Speaker 4:  He's like, we, we just want, you know, people to talk about politics or he's

1404
01:23:57,045 --> 01:23:59,045
Speaker 4:  like, we don't want people to talk about politics. We just want 'em to talk

1405
01:23:59,045 --> 01:24:02,525
Speaker 4:  about, you know, things that are not politics, like sports and fashion. And

1406
01:24:02,525 --> 01:24:02,845
Speaker 4:  it's like,

1407
01:24:04,605 --> 01:24:08,205
Speaker 4:  I don't, okay. There's no politics in sports famously. Yeah. No one, no

1408
01:24:08,205 --> 01:24:08,605
Speaker 4:  politics

1409
01:24:08,605 --> 01:24:10,125
Speaker 2:  There and, and either of those ever,

1410
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:13,005
Speaker 4:  Nothing about the fashion industry has anything to do with the way the world

1411
01:24:13,005 --> 01:24:16,125
Speaker 4:  works. No. Anyhow, all I'm saying is that then you look at the Threads algorithm

1412
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:19,525
Speaker 4:  and it's like just rage bait like that is

1413
01:24:19,525 --> 01:24:21,285
Speaker 4:  algorithmically what it will show you. Yep.

1414
01:24:21,905 --> 01:24:23,965
Speaker 2:  And like old rage bait lately. Yeah.

1415
01:24:24,305 --> 01:24:28,205
Speaker 4:  And I just like that little bit where it's like our, the

1416
01:24:28,205 --> 01:24:30,205
Speaker 4:  people that are being serviced here, being careful

1417
01:24:31,795 --> 01:24:34,135
Speaker 4:  and maybe we were too careful and we'll accept that criticism when it's,

1418
01:24:34,415 --> 01:24:38,255
Speaker 4:  I don't think you can, that our story is written by Liz, by the way, like

1419
01:24:38,915 --> 01:24:42,735
Speaker 4:  The Virgin and Liz Lipato are too easy on Elon Musk is a very hard case

1420
01:24:42,835 --> 01:24:46,375
Speaker 4:  to make. Yeah. Based on our work, we are careful

1421
01:24:46,485 --> 01:24:50,415
Speaker 4:  because we want our shots to land and we're especially careful when it's

1422
01:24:50,415 --> 01:24:54,135
Speaker 4:  other people's reporting. Right. That's just the way it goes. But I would

1423
01:24:54,135 --> 01:24:57,535
Speaker 4:  just say like, what social media has done is allowed a lot of people

1424
01:24:58,155 --> 01:25:01,175
Speaker 4:  who don't have to practice that care to participate in the media ecosystem,

1425
01:25:01,175 --> 01:25:01,815
Speaker 4:  which is great.

1426
01:25:03,395 --> 01:25:04,415
Speaker 4:  But it is also like

1427
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:09,505
Speaker 4:  weird. Like people, I think people are confused. So you accidentally encounter

1428
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:13,475
Speaker 4:  a lot of news, but you, you, there's not the part of the other

1429
01:25:13,535 --> 01:25:16,675
Speaker 4:  end where it's like, I know how this was made or I

1430
01:25:17,415 --> 01:25:20,035
Speaker 4:  am being careful. It's like if you optimize for engagement, you will get

1431
01:25:20,035 --> 01:25:20,435
Speaker 4:  engagement.

1432
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:24,475
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And oftentimes that engagement is done to like, it, it, it's just really

1433
01:25:24,545 --> 01:25:28,395
Speaker 2:  explosive. Right. Like it is, it's just, I I see it on, on TikTok a lot

1434
01:25:28,675 --> 01:25:31,395
Speaker 2:  'cause I went through and was like, we were hearing a bunch of different

1435
01:25:31,395 --> 01:25:33,955
Speaker 2:  news was popping up on TikTok. So I went and like searched that news. So

1436
01:25:33,955 --> 01:25:37,715
Speaker 2:  now my feed is just all of that news and the stuff, the

1437
01:25:37,915 --> 01:25:40,355
Speaker 2:  rhetoric is really heated. The rhetoric is very different than how you would

1438
01:25:40,515 --> 01:25:43,475
Speaker 2:  normally report on a story where you would be really cautious and careful

1439
01:25:43,475 --> 01:25:46,235
Speaker 2:  without every single part of it. Instead it's just like, yeah, these people

1440
01:25:46,505 --> 01:25:50,475
Speaker 2:  suck. This is evidence, right. Let's just get into it. And I'm like,

1441
01:25:50,475 --> 01:25:54,275
Speaker 2:  well no, you can't. That's not how you cover this

1442
01:25:54,395 --> 01:25:56,635
Speaker 2:  stuff. And there's a lot of reasons we cover it that way. Both because we

1443
01:25:56,635 --> 01:26:00,315
Speaker 2:  wanna be accurate and and honest and because we wanna like Yeah. Yeah. There's

1444
01:26:00,315 --> 01:26:03,965
Speaker 2:  just a bunch of reasons to do it and, and these people don't seem to have

1445
01:26:03,965 --> 01:26:05,005
Speaker 2:  the same concerns.

1446
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:08,085
Speaker 5:  Well, and there's also, I think one of the things that really jumped out

1447
01:26:08,085 --> 01:26:11,885
Speaker 5:  to me in this Pew study was that I think across

1448
01:26:12,285 --> 01:26:16,165
Speaker 5:  platforms, somewhere between like half and three quarters

1449
01:26:16,165 --> 01:26:19,885
Speaker 5:  of people said they pretty frequently

1450
01:26:20,025 --> 01:26:23,845
Speaker 5:  see inaccurate news on those platforms. And at some point the

1451
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:27,365
Speaker 5:  only response to that is just total nihilism. Yeah. Right. Like,

1452
01:26:27,665 --> 01:26:31,525
Speaker 5:  you just assume nothing is real, everything is chaos. You, you

1453
01:26:31,525 --> 01:26:34,365
Speaker 5:  can't trust anything. You can't believe anything. This all came to you by

1454
01:26:34,565 --> 01:26:37,125
Speaker 5:  accident. Right? Like it's, it's killing the idea of sit, like sitting down

1455
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:41,045
Speaker 5:  and reading the news like that as a behavior that people do on purpose

1456
01:26:41,865 --> 01:26:45,445
Speaker 5:  is dying because this stuff is just bombarding at you all the time. And so,

1457
01:26:46,035 --> 01:26:49,525
Speaker 5:  like, it's hard to be a news consumer now. And so I think all these people,

1458
01:26:49,525 --> 01:26:52,085
Speaker 5:  especially when these things are coming up, they're used to that inflamed

1459
01:26:52,285 --> 01:26:55,005
Speaker 5:  rhetoric. They're used to have this stuff being wrong anyway. And so you,

1460
01:26:55,065 --> 01:26:57,125
Speaker 5:  you don't know the provenance, you don't know how this stuff works. You don't

1461
01:26:57,125 --> 01:27:00,165
Speaker 5:  know the story. It's just all sort of happening around you. And it's like,

1462
01:27:00,165 --> 01:27:02,925
Speaker 5:  how on earth are you supposed to make heads or tails of anything? Yeah. In

1463
01:27:02,925 --> 01:27:03,805
Speaker 5:  that ecosystem.

1464
01:27:04,155 --> 01:27:07,805
Speaker 4:  Wait, what is the, what is the source of truth? Right? Like, and all these

1465
01:27:08,005 --> 01:27:10,845
Speaker 4:  platforms wanna say they don't wanna be arbiters of truth. Mark Zucker famously,

1466
01:27:10,845 --> 01:27:13,405
Speaker 4:  I don't wanna be the arbiter of the truth, but then you need a place to go.

1467
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:17,245
Speaker 4:  Right? And that's what media institutions are supposed to be. I'm not saying

1468
01:27:17,745 --> 01:27:21,645
Speaker 4:  any of us do a good job of this. Like that is the thing that we have

1469
01:27:21,645 --> 01:27:24,845
Speaker 4:  allowed to wither away in the, in the platform era. But it's stories like

1470
01:27:24,845 --> 01:27:27,365
Speaker 4:  this. Like if you go look at the comments of the Wall Street Journal article,

1471
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:30,725
Speaker 4:  the comments are full of people being like, this is just a hit piece. Right.

1472
01:27:30,725 --> 01:27:34,205
Speaker 4:  Like their own comments section is a disaster of people being like, I don't

1473
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:37,845
Speaker 4:  even, I don't even read this. I think it's bullshit because we have now conditioned

1474
01:27:37,845 --> 01:27:41,085
Speaker 4:  a bunch of people 'cause of social media to believe that everything is overdone

1475
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:45,605
Speaker 4:  or sensationalized or just done for outrage or just done for

1476
01:27:45,605 --> 01:27:49,125
Speaker 4:  clicks. And in this case, what you're looking at is,

1477
01:27:49,545 --> 01:27:53,445
Speaker 4:  boy, the culture at SpaceX appears to be a disaster. Like from

1478
01:27:53,585 --> 01:27:57,525
Speaker 4:  top to bottom there are a whole bunch of very

1479
01:27:57,525 --> 01:28:00,565
Speaker 4:  unhappy women. There are women who have been retaliated against

1480
01:28:01,425 --> 01:28:02,885
Speaker 4:  by the most senior women at the company.

1481
01:28:03,055 --> 01:28:06,885
Speaker 2:  Which none of this is like, when I first saw this story, I was like, oh,

1482
01:28:06,885 --> 01:28:09,685
Speaker 2:  didn't we cover this already? Yeah. Because, because we've seen this story

1483
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:13,645
Speaker 2:  from SpaceX before. Lauren Gresh used to cover it a lot for

1484
01:28:13,645 --> 01:28:16,685
Speaker 2:  us. And, and to just see it crop up again, it's like, oh,

1485
01:28:17,705 --> 01:28:20,645
Speaker 4:  And now there's all this additional reporting Yeah. In the journal where

1486
01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:24,525
Speaker 4:  it's like, I just like, again, I, if you're listening to this and

1487
01:28:24,525 --> 01:28:26,725
Speaker 4:  you're thinking about starting a company, one thing you should not do is

1488
01:28:26,725 --> 01:28:29,925
Speaker 4:  walk around your company asking employees if they will have your children

1489
01:28:30,915 --> 01:28:31,725
Speaker 2:  Just don't do it.

1490
01:28:32,025 --> 01:28:35,565
Speaker 4:  It feels like a very basic rule that we have to lay out at this time. Yeah.

1491
01:28:35,755 --> 01:28:39,445
Speaker 4:  It's not a rule that appears to apply to Elon

1492
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:43,525
Speaker 4:  against whom there are credible allegations that a woman who

1493
01:28:43,525 --> 01:28:47,125
Speaker 4:  accused him of sexual harassment he responded to by offering her a horse.

1494
01:28:48,465 --> 01:28:51,085
Speaker 4:  It does come back to horses a lot. It always does. On this episode first.

1495
01:28:51,545 --> 01:28:55,245
Speaker 5:  Oh, on that note, Alex, I actually have a question for you. What's your lightning

1496
01:28:55,245 --> 01:28:55,605
Speaker 5:  round thing?

1497
01:28:56,585 --> 01:28:58,965
Speaker 2:  My lightning round thing is also related to horses.

1498
01:29:01,115 --> 01:29:04,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. 'cause did you guys ever, did you guys go to Alamo Draft House? Either

1499
01:29:04,325 --> 01:29:05,765
Speaker 2:  one of you Draft house fans?

1500
01:29:05,765 --> 01:29:09,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah, all the time. They're, they just opened one like a mile from me

1501
01:29:09,415 --> 01:29:12,085
Speaker 5:  maybe a year ago. And it's now my go-to movie theater.

1502
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:16,205
Speaker 2:  So I'm, I'm gonna be be real old right now in, in

1503
01:29:16,205 --> 01:29:20,165
Speaker 2:  my twenties. I spent a lot of time in Austin, Texas, which is

1504
01:29:20,165 --> 01:29:23,965
Speaker 2:  where Alamo Drafthouse started. I went to a lot of screenings, went to a

1505
01:29:23,965 --> 01:29:26,445
Speaker 2:  lot of parties, went to a lot of things, sort of knew Tim League, the,

1506
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:29,365
Speaker 5:  Is that the one that's also like a movie museum? And they have like the most

1507
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:31,685
Speaker 5:  incredible collection of old stuff from movies.

1508
01:29:32,425 --> 01:29:34,045
Speaker 2:  The, the Alamo Drafthouse there. I think

1509
01:29:34,045 --> 01:29:34,245
Speaker 5:  It is.

1510
01:29:34,965 --> 01:29:37,165
Speaker 2:  I don't, I could be wrong. One of them might be there. There's a bunch of

1511
01:29:37,165 --> 01:29:41,085
Speaker 2:  different ones. Say they've, some have come, they've gone. It is

1512
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:44,445
Speaker 2:  great. Every time I go to Austin now I'm like, oh, that draft house is closed.

1513
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:48,605
Speaker 2:  And I once saw people run for their lives because they didn't want to talk

1514
01:29:48,605 --> 01:29:52,365
Speaker 2:  to the audience because we were so mad at them about the movie. It was super

1515
01:29:52,365 --> 01:29:56,245
Speaker 2:  cool. Poughkeepsie tapes. But, but so Alamo

1516
01:29:56,245 --> 01:30:00,045
Speaker 2:  draft drafthouse famous, famous institution, one of like, kind of the core

1517
01:30:00,615 --> 01:30:04,525
Speaker 2:  movie theater franchises and very terminally

1518
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:08,445
Speaker 2:  online. It ran its own blog for years. Badass Digest. It

1519
01:30:08,725 --> 01:30:12,645
Speaker 2:  really, it was famously huge friends with Harry Knowles who is like the

1520
01:30:13,045 --> 01:30:16,485
Speaker 2:  original movie blogger. We don't talk about him anymore. You can go

1521
01:30:16,485 --> 01:30:20,405
Speaker 2:  Wikipedia y and and they have been in

1522
01:30:20,405 --> 01:30:23,445
Speaker 2:  a lot of trouble the last few years. There was allegations of

1523
01:30:24,695 --> 01:30:28,325
Speaker 2:  labor issues there and sexual harassment and, and lots of

1524
01:30:28,455 --> 01:30:32,125
Speaker 2:  sorts of things. And then COVID hit and they, like every movie

1525
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:35,645
Speaker 2:  theater friend company got bodied

1526
01:30:36,245 --> 01:30:40,005
Speaker 2:  really, really badly. They filed for bankruptcy in 2020. One whole new

1527
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:44,405
Speaker 2:  like reorg happened, got in a bunch of investors. Tim League was still

1528
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:48,125
Speaker 2:  in charge. Then last week I believe

1529
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:51,765
Speaker 2:  they suddenly closed a whole bunch of their theaters in Dallas.

1530
01:30:51,945 --> 01:30:55,805
Speaker 2:  And that was a real bummer because I was planning to go to them and

1531
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:59,045
Speaker 2:  it was, it's fine. I'm through it. And then this week they announced that

1532
01:30:59,115 --> 01:31:02,965
Speaker 2:  Sony has purchased them. So, so yeah. Alamo is now

1533
01:31:02,965 --> 01:31:06,565
Speaker 2:  gonna be completely owned by Sony. I assume you're gonna see some Sony movies

1534
01:31:06,565 --> 01:31:09,125
Speaker 2:  there, but you should probably still see all the other ones. 'cause like

1535
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:12,925
Speaker 2:  Disney still has the, the biggest market share of, of

1536
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:16,725
Speaker 2:  films. And I don't think Disney like, excuse me. I don't think Alamo is gonna

1537
01:31:16,725 --> 01:31:19,695
Speaker 2:  be like, no, we're not gonna screen a Star War.

1538
01:31:21,045 --> 01:31:24,295
Speaker 4:  Well, I think the, you know, Netflix owns a bunch of theaters and they do

1539
01:31:24,295 --> 01:31:27,775
Speaker 4:  limited theatrical runs. 'cause they gotta keep the stars happy and get them

1540
01:31:27,845 --> 01:31:28,455
Speaker 4:  star awards

1541
01:31:28,485 --> 01:31:30,015
Speaker 2:  Also. Yeah. That's, it's all for awards.

1542
01:31:31,055 --> 01:31:34,375
Speaker 4:  I think Sony actually wants to like, have a chain of movie theaters. I think

1543
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:35,015
Speaker 4:  it's very different.

1544
01:31:35,235 --> 01:31:39,135
Speaker 2:  It it is very different. Like Sony is just like, no, we want this to be a

1545
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:43,195
Speaker 2:  business again. And there was a reason it

1546
01:31:43,195 --> 01:31:46,595
Speaker 2:  wasn't allowed to be a business. And, and the, the ramifications of the paramount

1547
01:31:46,595 --> 01:31:50,435
Speaker 2:  decree were huge. Right? Like we got independent film, we got, we got

1548
01:31:50,435 --> 01:31:53,675
Speaker 2:  more queer film, we got more women in films, more people of color in films.

1549
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:58,235
Speaker 2:  There was just like miscegenation was illegal to, to show on film. And

1550
01:31:58,235 --> 01:32:01,085
Speaker 2:  then the Paramount Decree came out and they started to soften those rules

1551
01:32:01,205 --> 01:32:05,125
Speaker 2:  a little. It took a long time. But there's just, the paramount decree was

1552
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:08,805
Speaker 2:  very, very important for competition in the filmmaking industry.

1553
01:32:08,945 --> 01:32:12,285
Speaker 2:  And the fact that it has gone now has always been kind of a bummer. Even

1554
01:32:12,285 --> 01:32:16,245
Speaker 2:  though streaming has really taken a lot of that audience and Sony's like,

1555
01:32:16,245 --> 01:32:19,815
Speaker 2:  okay, we're just gonna follow back and it's 19 30 80.

1556
01:32:19,965 --> 01:32:23,735
Speaker 4:  Well, yeah, but just to make the argument times have radically changed. Yeah.

1557
01:32:23,745 --> 01:32:26,415
Speaker 4:  There is not a booming theatrical business anymore. It's true. True. It seems

1558
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:30,295
Speaker 4:  to be declining. Does Almo Drafthouse even exist unless the

1559
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:33,055
Speaker 4:  studio like Sony shows up? Like Sony doesn't have a streamer. Yeah, they

1560
01:32:33,055 --> 01:32:36,895
Speaker 4:  have crunchy roll. They got Sony picture core. Oh, it's like

1561
01:32:37,235 --> 01:32:37,895
Speaker 4:  Bravia core.

1562
01:32:38,715 --> 01:32:42,495
Speaker 2:  Wow. Just like rise up, just really hurting yourself there.

1563
01:32:42,835 --> 01:32:43,055
Speaker 2:  But

1564
01:32:43,445 --> 01:32:45,975
Speaker 4:  They were like, do you wanna watch Madame Webb at 80 megabits per second?

1565
01:32:45,975 --> 01:32:47,495
Speaker 4:  Did you? And I said, no, sir, I do watch

1566
01:32:47,515 --> 01:32:50,615
Speaker 5:  The only way to do that's gonna be at an Alamo draft house from on. Yeah.

1567
01:32:50,615 --> 01:32:52,575
Speaker 2:  It's gonna like at 2:00 AM a little drunk.

1568
01:32:53,595 --> 01:32:56,535
Speaker 5:  No, I think the answer to your question, Eli, is no, it doesn't. And and

1569
01:32:56,535 --> 01:33:00,175
Speaker 5:  I think the, like, the idea that we have to, you know,

1570
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:04,135
Speaker 5:  protect the movie industry from the big bad studios and

1571
01:33:04,135 --> 01:33:07,815
Speaker 5:  theaters is like such a long gone phenomenon at this point.

1572
01:33:08,195 --> 01:33:08,735
Speaker 2:  No, I disagree.

1573
01:33:08,925 --> 01:33:12,455
Speaker 5:  What we desperately need is someone with real money

1574
01:33:12,955 --> 01:33:15,135
Speaker 5:  trying to get everyone back into movie theaters.

1575
01:33:15,885 --> 01:33:18,295
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But I don't think it should be the movie theater. I don't think it

1576
01:33:18,295 --> 01:33:19,775
Speaker 2:  should be the people making the movies,

1577
01:33:20,155 --> 01:33:21,775
Speaker 5:  But no one else is incentivized to do

1578
01:33:21,775 --> 01:33:24,015
Speaker 2:  It. But like Alamo's issues were

1579
01:33:25,635 --> 01:33:28,615
Speaker 2:  not necessarily, like some of the Alamo's issues were declining viewership.

1580
01:33:28,615 --> 01:33:32,375
Speaker 2:  That's totally true. A lot of Alamo's issues were overextending

1581
01:33:32,535 --> 01:33:35,695
Speaker 2:  themselves. They've got a theater in Fi Dye and I can always get a ticket

1582
01:33:35,715 --> 01:33:38,975
Speaker 2:  to see a movie there because no one goes to the see the movies in fi d

1583
01:33:39,715 --> 01:33:40,255
Speaker 2:  Why? That's

1584
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:43,215
Speaker 5:  All the financial industry movie theaters now. That's everywhere. That's

1585
01:33:43,215 --> 01:33:43,775
Speaker 2:  Not true. That's,

1586
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:47,335
Speaker 4:  It's like a handful of blockbusters that get sold out. And then no other

1587
01:33:47,335 --> 01:33:48,135
Speaker 4:  movies like

1588
01:33:48,425 --> 01:33:52,015
Speaker 2:  Alamo has famously been very good at programming big events around their

1589
01:33:52,015 --> 01:33:55,535
Speaker 2:  other movies and, and they were really, really good at it. But they've overextended

1590
01:33:55,535 --> 01:33:59,495
Speaker 2:  themselves. They never recover from 2021. And I don't

1591
01:33:59,495 --> 01:34:03,375
Speaker 2:  think it necessarily needed to be Sony that went and did this. Right.

1592
01:34:03,495 --> 01:34:06,135
Speaker 2:  I don't think it should be these movie theaters because they are already

1593
01:34:06,365 --> 01:34:10,095
Speaker 2:  control, they're already so vertically integrated. We shouldn't just add

1594
01:34:10,095 --> 01:34:14,055
Speaker 2:  more on and give up. We should in fact say, Hey, you shouldn't be

1595
01:34:14,055 --> 01:34:17,535
Speaker 2:  able to own everything all the way down because it does

1596
01:34:17,935 --> 01:34:21,815
Speaker 2:  actually measurably make the entire industry worse and

1597
01:34:21,815 --> 01:34:22,335
Speaker 2:  less creative.

1598
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:27,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I just, they they didn't buy a MC, they bought Elmo Drafthouse. I

1599
01:34:27,045 --> 01:34:27,285
Speaker 4:  know. And

1600
01:34:27,525 --> 01:34:29,885
Speaker 2:  They're, I went there so

1601
01:34:29,885 --> 01:34:32,885
Speaker 4:  Much. Right. Like, I, I, I'm, I'm with you and I'm usually the one who's

1602
01:34:32,885 --> 01:34:36,405
Speaker 4:  like the most pro diversified competition on the show. Is

1603
01:34:36,405 --> 01:34:37,965
Speaker 2:  This just me being super film nerd? We

1604
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:38,445
Speaker 4:  Are. No, I don't,

1605
01:34:38,445 --> 01:34:41,925
Speaker 5:  I don't so diversified though. Like, the idea that the movie theaters is

1606
01:34:41,925 --> 01:34:44,605
Speaker 5:  this like, gigantic business that we can't possibly let the studios back

1607
01:34:44,605 --> 01:34:48,565
Speaker 5:  into is just not how it works anymore. Like, it, it,

1608
01:34:48,665 --> 01:34:52,365
Speaker 5:  if anything, we should be saying Sony can't own a streaming service.

1609
01:34:52,475 --> 01:34:56,285
Speaker 5:  Like that's the, that's the scarier way to take too much control of the

1610
01:34:56,565 --> 01:34:59,285
Speaker 2:  Industry right now. Right. What's already happening in the industry, I think.

1611
01:34:59,285 --> 01:35:00,325
Speaker 5:  Right. So be mad about that. I

1612
01:35:00,325 --> 01:35:01,805
Speaker 2:  Just, again, why, I mean, I'm mad about that. I,

1613
01:35:02,285 --> 01:35:05,045
Speaker 4:  I just, again, I just want to remind everyone that the streaming companies

1614
01:35:05,045 --> 01:35:08,885
Speaker 4:  that Sony owns are Crunchy Roll and Sony Pictures core, which

1615
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:10,045
Speaker 4:  I use because it

1616
01:35:10,045 --> 01:35:12,085
Speaker 5:  That is crackle erasure and I will not stand for it.

1617
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,525
Speaker 4:  It streams at 80 megabits per second. Does Crackle still

1618
01:35:16,525 --> 01:35:19,645
Speaker 4:  exist? Only leads to so many televisions? No, it does not. Sir. Crackle has

1619
01:35:19,645 --> 01:35:20,565
Speaker 4:  long since gone 90.

1620
01:35:21,865 --> 01:35:25,325
Speaker 5:  No. How dare you. I can still make a free account on crackle.com sir,

1621
01:35:25,425 --> 01:35:25,965
Speaker 4:  To do what?

1622
01:35:26,525 --> 01:35:29,805
Speaker 2:  I don't know. You can watch. There's, there's the, the Alfred from Batman

1623
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:33,765
Speaker 2:  prequel where like Alfred, I never watched it, but

1624
01:35:34,085 --> 01:35:35,845
Speaker 2:  apparently he, he solves crimes. I

1625
01:35:35,845 --> 01:35:36,605
Speaker 4:  Swear to God. Crackle.

1626
01:35:36,865 --> 01:35:40,525
Speaker 5:  No Crackle still exists. I had to, what? I'm, I'm literally on their website

1627
01:35:40,525 --> 01:35:42,525
Speaker 5:  and I'm not positive it still exists, which is tele,

1628
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:43,845
Speaker 2:  Are any of those things real? But

1629
01:35:43,845 --> 01:35:46,325
Speaker 5:  It's here. I can watch, I can watch

1630
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:48,205
Speaker 2:  You have to name a movie that actually exists.

1631
01:35:49,485 --> 01:35:52,845
Speaker 5:  Dominion, can I interest you in season one episode one of Dominion Creek?

1632
01:35:53,985 --> 01:35:57,125
Speaker 2:  That's not true. That's, that's ai. Okay. You have to give me something that

1633
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:57,645
Speaker 2:  doesn't sound like AI

1634
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,325
Speaker 5:  Made it. Abandoned Colon Angelique's Isle. How about that?

1635
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:06,645
Speaker 5:  What about ICU? But it's spelled EYE and it appears to

1636
01:36:06,645 --> 01:36:07,645
Speaker 5:  have Yl Stallone in it.

1637
01:36:08,195 --> 01:36:10,005
Speaker 2:  Okay. That's a real person.

1638
01:36:10,065 --> 01:36:12,325
Speaker 5:  All of this is fake. I don't believe this website is real.

1639
01:36:14,925 --> 01:36:17,875
Speaker 5:  Sorry, I have to stop looking@crackle.com. This is too much. I'm enjoying

1640
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:18,355
Speaker 5:  this too much.

1641
01:36:19,495 --> 01:36:19,995
Speaker 2:  Oh man.

1642
01:36:20,825 --> 01:36:23,995
Speaker 4:  Okay. Everybody gets on there. I see what happened here. I just want to point

1643
01:36:24,015 --> 01:36:27,955
Speaker 4:  out Sony exited Crackle and sold it to

1644
01:36:28,035 --> 01:36:30,475
Speaker 4:  a company called Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment.

1645
01:36:30,975 --> 01:36:34,115
Speaker 5:  Ooh. Which also owned Red Box and I think is also in the middle of going

1646
01:36:34,115 --> 01:36:34,635
Speaker 5:  out of business.

1647
01:36:34,975 --> 01:36:38,955
Speaker 4:  I'm just going to, just gonna say that counts as going 90. All

1648
01:36:38,955 --> 01:36:39,035
Speaker 4:  right.

1649
01:36:41,465 --> 01:36:45,315
Speaker 4:  It's not, it is. SEO honeypot now for

1650
01:36:45,315 --> 01:36:48,315
Speaker 4:  Self-help content fully gone. 90,

1651
01:36:50,075 --> 01:36:52,395
Speaker 4:  although it's now David's preferred streaming service. From what I understand

1652
01:36:52,575 --> 01:36:55,715
Speaker 2:  You, you watch Ghost Squad, it's something called Crossbo Angel.

1653
01:36:55,715 --> 01:36:55,955
Speaker 4:  Click on

1654
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:56,955
Speaker 5:  Is my favorite movie.

1655
01:36:56,985 --> 01:36:59,795
Speaker 4:  When you click on the crackle FAQ, this is a real thing that I did. I clicked

1656
01:36:59,795 --> 01:37:02,715
Speaker 4:  on the FAQ assuming that it would tell me who owned Crackle, but instead

1657
01:37:02,715 --> 01:37:06,115
Speaker 4:  it showed me a list of trending support topics. And one of them.

1658
01:37:06,415 --> 01:37:10,035
Speaker 4:  Number two, on the list of trending support topics in the crackle

1659
01:37:10,075 --> 01:37:13,475
Speaker 4:  FAQ. How many Vizio devices can I add to my crack? What?

1660
01:37:18,185 --> 01:37:21,635
Speaker 4:  This is real, I'm not, I'm not kidding at all. Well, the other one is, how

1661
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:24,755
Speaker 4:  do I troubleshoot issues my Xbox Series S? So I think we know a lot about

1662
01:37:24,825 --> 01:37:27,035
Speaker 4:  this. Yep. Version of Crackle.

1663
01:37:28,065 --> 01:37:28,285
Speaker 2:  Mm.

1664
01:37:28,785 --> 01:37:32,725
Speaker 4:  You, yeah. All right. Crackle has gone 90, that's one thing we've

1665
01:37:32,725 --> 01:37:35,765
Speaker 4:  learned about this. I'm with you that consolidation is bad. I just,

1666
01:37:35,765 --> 01:37:39,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's, yeah. I think I mainly just bummed to see Amazon or I'm mainly

1667
01:37:39,365 --> 01:37:43,285
Speaker 2:  just bummed to see Alamo go this way. I spent a lot of time there in my twenties

1668
01:37:43,285 --> 01:37:47,265
Speaker 2:  seeing some of the worst movies. And like two, I got to see

1669
01:37:47,565 --> 01:37:50,185
Speaker 2:  Otto's Mur Mero. Yeah.

1670
01:37:51,555 --> 01:37:54,865
Speaker 2:  Metropolis there at a 24 hour movie festival.

1671
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:59,845
Speaker 2:  Colorized absolutely spectacular. But I also saw Poughkeepsie

1672
01:37:59,845 --> 01:38:03,405
Speaker 2:  tapes and again, we, we chased the filmmakers out of the theater

1673
01:38:03,475 --> 01:38:03,965
Speaker 2:  because

1674
01:38:03,965 --> 01:38:06,765
Speaker 4:  We don't so much. I'm saying when I was in law school, I got absolutely hammered

1675
01:38:06,765 --> 01:38:09,885
Speaker 4:  with my friends and went and saw a broken li, broken Lizards Club dread at

1676
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:13,405
Speaker 4:  an animal drop pass. You can have experiences at movie theaters. Oh my

1677
01:38:13,405 --> 01:38:13,965
Speaker 2:  God, it's

1678
01:38:13,965 --> 01:38:17,045
Speaker 4:  Great. All right, that's it. We gotta, we gotta re wrap this up. We are like

1679
01:38:17,045 --> 01:38:20,925
Speaker 4:  500 years over time. There's still so much to say about Crackle.

1680
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:23,445
Speaker 2:  I was like, that's, we're just in a whole episode about it.

1681
01:38:23,535 --> 01:38:27,205
Speaker 4:  We'll do that next week. By the way, one thing we didn't get to the is

1682
01:38:27,585 --> 01:38:31,485
Speaker 4:  as we speak, the Tesla vote to give Elon is money or

1683
01:38:31,485 --> 01:38:34,565
Speaker 4:  not is money is still ongoing. It looks like he might win.

1684
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:36,565
Speaker 4:  We'll cover that on
