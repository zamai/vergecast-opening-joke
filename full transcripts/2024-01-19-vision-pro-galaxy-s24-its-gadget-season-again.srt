00:00:00,835 --> 00:00:04,655
Speaker 1:  The enduring appeal of Donald Trump explained by fan

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:04,935
Speaker 1:  culture.

4
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,415
Speaker 2:  It's human nature to, to love being in a community of people who are all

5
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:13,295
Speaker 2:  excited about the same thing you are. Whether that's people getting excited

6
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:17,175
Speaker 2:  about Jesus on a Sunday morning, or people getting excited about Taylor

7
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,215
Speaker 2:  Swift on a Saturday night.

8
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:23,095
Speaker 1:  What happens when supporters become stands? That's

9
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:24,215
Speaker 1:  this week on the weeds.

10
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:34,355
Speaker 4:  The Great Pacific garbage patch is made up of over a trillion pieces of

11
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:37,995
Speaker 4:  plastic. But two scientists recently stumbled on

12
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:41,875
Speaker 4:  something else, something that seemed impossible.

13
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:45,515
Speaker 2:  Both of us were just like, you know, like what?

14
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:46,795
Speaker 5:  It was an

15
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,955
Speaker 2:  Uhoh moment. It blew our minds

16
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:53,755
Speaker 4:  This week on unexplainable. What do you do when the garbage threatening life

17
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:57,355
Speaker 4:  in the ocean becomes its own ecosystem?

18
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,715
Speaker 4:  Listen to unexplainable new episodes every Wednesday.

19
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:08,195
Speaker 6:  Hello and Welcome. To Vergecast, the flagship podcast, spatial Computing,

20
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:12,355
Speaker 6:  A form of computing that is all around you at all times.

21
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:14,035
Speaker 6:  And see center

22
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:17,875
Speaker 8:  It sneaks up on you.

23
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,995
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's Apple's Dream is to have

24
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:25,035
Speaker 6:  just Eddie Van Halen just creeping, creeping

25
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:28,755
Speaker 6:  eruption. Hi, I'm Mila. I'm your friend. David Pierce is here.

26
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:32,795
Speaker 8:  Hi don. Don't know how to follow eruption, but here we are. I

27
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:35,675
Speaker 6:  Guess. I mean, isn't that, that's the, that's the goal of all computing.

28
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:39,315
Speaker 6:  The purpose of computers is to make great art and emotional experiences.

29
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:43,315
Speaker 6:  I strongly believe this to be true. And what you, to do that most

30
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:46,835
Speaker 6:  effectively, you have to design state of the art.

31
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:51,035
Speaker 6:  4K ole displays, micro ole displays, two micron pixels.

32
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:55,515
Speaker 6:  You have to convince the entire music industry to support Dolby Atmos.

33
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:59,515
Speaker 6:  And then you have to convince people to wear the ski goggles so that

34
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:02,635
Speaker 6:  Jimmy Page can just creeping, creeping.

35
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:05,995
Speaker 6:  Think about it,

36
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:11,155
Speaker 6:  you know, like 20 years from now, that reference won't make any sense. And

37
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:14,315
Speaker 6:  we'll be like, and then Halsey will be creeping. Creeping. And that will

38
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:17,595
Speaker 8:  NELI. I gotta tell you, none of what you just said made any sense. Now

39
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:18,995
Speaker 6:  So,

40
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:20,355
Speaker 8:  So we're, we're starting. I

41
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:24,275
Speaker 6:  Just imagine today's pop stars in the context of that joke. Like

42
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:28,235
Speaker 6:  the point of technology is for Taylor Swift to just creep

43
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,075
Speaker 6:  up on you from behind. Alex. Cranz is here. Hi Alex.

44
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:35,355
Speaker 7:  I'm just wondering what the shoe situation is like. Like do they have to

45
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,675
Speaker 7:  think about the shoes they wear when they creep up on you? Is that part of

46
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,195
Speaker 7:  the spatial audio experience?

47
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:43,955
Speaker 6:  Yes, it's a hundred percent true that Jimmy Page has to wear very

48
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,155
Speaker 6:  quiet ninja shoes. The shoes with the toes.

49
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:52,155
Speaker 6:  Yeah. In Bill Atmos, for some reason Victoria's Song has

50
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:53,235
Speaker 6:  chosen to join us today.

51
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:57,835
Speaker 9:  I, I'm here and I don't know why Radiohead isn't doing the creeping.

52
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:01,525
Speaker 6:  They were, I mean like Shoegaze was a, a very quiet

53
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:02,645
Speaker 6:  form of

54
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:07,805
Speaker 6:  the shoe. I mean like they had to look at their shoes. That's the joke that

55
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:08,405
Speaker 6:  I'm trying to make.

56
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:16,035
Speaker 6:  That's, that's what I'm saying. Because they had so many guitar pedals. This

57
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:19,715
Speaker 6:  is an entire genre of music that was named after

58
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:22,035
Speaker 6:  Nerds looking at their feet.

59
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,655
Speaker 8:  Apple and Apple's bringing it back. Apples. That's, that's, that's where

60
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:28,895
Speaker 8:  we got

61
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:31,935
Speaker 6:  Her. Alright. Quite a lot happened this week. Actually. The real reason Victoria

62
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,935
Speaker 6:  is here is 'cause she and I went and saw the Vision Pro.

63
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:39,135
Speaker 6:  I saw it for the second time. Victoria saw it for the first time. There's

64
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,615
Speaker 6:  a lot to talk about with that demo

65
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:45,495
Speaker 6:  why Apple gave a whole bunch of the same demo over again to a lot of people.

66
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:49,735
Speaker 6:  Then Samsung had Galaxy unpacked. They announced the S 24, which is full

67
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:53,295
Speaker 6:  of ai. There's a smart Ring v covers,

68
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:56,495
Speaker 6:  wearables we gotta talk to to her about the smart ring. I got a lightning

69
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:59,335
Speaker 6:  round by the way, mark Zuckerberg just sort of appeared on our website this

70
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:03,295
Speaker 6:  week creeping, creeping and announced that Meta is the purpose

71
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:07,135
Speaker 6:  of Meta is now to build a GI, which you will recall. He

72
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,655
Speaker 6:  renamed the entire company Meta to build the Metaverse. Didn't rename the

73
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:13,695
Speaker 6:  company this time, but he just sort of appeared and said, Alex Heath, it's

74
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:16,415
Speaker 6:  a GI now. And Alex said what? We'll talk about that as well.

75
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,695
Speaker 8:  Can you imagine how cool a move it would be if he just renamed the company

76
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,975
Speaker 8:  like AI Incorporated? Yes.

77
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,575
Speaker 6:  That's all in want. I mean we're not, we're not far off.

78
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:28,615
Speaker 9:  It took me so long to call it Meta from Facebook. It's

79
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:32,055
Speaker 9:  not gonna make it a second Leap to AI be amazing incorporated.

80
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:36,095
Speaker 6:  There's some moves you only get to pull once in renaming the

81
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:39,895
Speaker 6:  company is one of those moves. Like you gotta this clock restarts.

82
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:42,815
Speaker 6:  Yeah, you got another 15 years before you can be like, you know what, actually

83
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:46,415
Speaker 6:  Meta was the wrong name, but we can talk about all that. Let's start

84
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:48,015
Speaker 6:  with the Vision. Pro.

85
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:52,215
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well and I actually, I, I think we should start with your experience

86
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:56,175
Speaker 8:  having this experience NELI Envy because this was a

87
00:04:56,175 --> 00:05:00,055
Speaker 8:  weird hands-on experience. Like we, we get a lot of these

88
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:03,815
Speaker 8:  where we sit in a room and somebody gives us a demo of a thing. But the two

89
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:07,255
Speaker 8:  of you had this odd experience where for the first time,

90
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:10,295
Speaker 8:  this is very strange and I hadn't really thought about it until it happened.

91
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:14,335
Speaker 8:  Regular humans were photographed wearing the Vision

92
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,935
Speaker 8:  Pro and so all over the internet this week, this has like become a meme of

93
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:20,575
Speaker 8:  a bunch of like reporters doing the pinchy pinch gesture.

94
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:25,495
Speaker 8:  And there's been like, you know, drips and drabs of information about how

95
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:29,175
Speaker 8:  this actually went. But I think the way Apple is rolling this thing out and

96
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:32,335
Speaker 8:  showing it to people is actually really interesting. So can you guys just

97
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:35,935
Speaker 8:  sort of tell the story of your day with the Vision Pro V It was your experience.

98
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:37,855
Speaker 8:  So like walk us through it to begin with here.

99
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:42,175
Speaker 9:  Yeah, so you know, I had read Eli's writeup of the

100
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:44,335
Speaker 9:  demo he got at WW DC So I

101
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,055
Speaker 8:  Eli's Fever Dream Hands, hands-on,

102
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:50,855
Speaker 9:  You know, this is my fever Dreams hands-on this time around. 'cause

103
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:55,015
Speaker 9:  literally 24 hours after it happened I was like, did that actually happen

104
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,925
Speaker 9:  or did I fever dream this all up? I, I wasn't entirely

105
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:02,725
Speaker 9:  sure but I felt like the imprint, the ghost imprint of the Vision Pro

106
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:06,765
Speaker 9:  on my forehead for a full 24 hours afterwards. So

107
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:10,645
Speaker 9:  yeah, it did happen. But yeah, NELI was the only one who wasn't pinchy pinching

108
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:12,085
Speaker 9:  in the photos. So can

109
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:15,925
Speaker 6:  I, I'll just, I'm just gonna say this very directly. The purpose of this

110
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:19,925
Speaker 6:  is very clear. Apple wanted to be in control of the first photos of

111
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:23,645
Speaker 6:  people wearing the Vision Pro. I am fundamentally

112
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:27,085
Speaker 6:  uncomfortable with the trade that we made here and that everyone else made

113
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:30,565
Speaker 6:  because we went to the thing. They didn't tell us they were going to give

114
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:34,205
Speaker 6:  us photos to walk out with. We did the demo. Demo is really interesting.

115
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:37,645
Speaker 6:  I'm always excited to see a new piece of technology. There's an enormous

116
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:41,125
Speaker 6:  amount of new ideas in the Vision Pro to contend with fun to look at it again.

117
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:43,245
Speaker 6:  And they're like, oh we're gonna take your picture. Do you want a photo?

118
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:46,805
Speaker 6:  And I was like, yeah. And it didn't occur to me until I walked outta there

119
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:50,965
Speaker 6:  that Apple took my photos. They selected which

120
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:54,845
Speaker 6:  photos they were gonna airdrop to me and then they did the same

121
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,805
Speaker 6:  thing for everyone else. So we ran the photos. I think it is interesting

122
00:06:57,805 --> 00:07:01,705
Speaker 6:  to look at pictures of people in the headset. No one has seen

123
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:03,825
Speaker 6:  that outside of Apple's marketing before. Yeah.

124
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:07,745
Speaker 8:  And this has been kind of a closely guarded thing for seven months now. We

125
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:10,985
Speaker 8:  really have not seen pictures of people in the headset until now.

126
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:14,945
Speaker 7:  We have. but it was all like models in a gorgeously lit home.

127
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,785
Speaker 6:  Well excuse me, Alex.

128
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:19,985
Speaker 8:  Well right. We've seen ads of people in a headset. Yeah,

129
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:24,265
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Neela and I are gorgeously lit models still models like,

130
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,705
Speaker 7:  Sorry, sorry to all the models on this podcast.

131
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,865
Speaker 6:  All I was saying is we were in a gorgeously lit home. Yeah,

132
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:33,465
Speaker 7:  You were. It was

133
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:35,945
Speaker 6:  Beautiful. But there's something weird there, right? Especially 'cause it's

134
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:38,945
Speaker 6:  a picture of me and I, there's a and a picture of V and everybody else.

135
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:43,345
Speaker 6:  There's some assumption there that that is our photo.

136
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:47,865
Speaker 6:  Right? That right. but it is Apple's photo. It's an Apple's photo of me

137
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:51,345
Speaker 6:  that they got to pick. Right. And I know, you know, I know a bunch of other

138
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,065
Speaker 6:  people who had this experience, they were trying to make funny faces. They

139
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:56,545
Speaker 6:  were doing funny hand gestures and Apple just didn't give those photos to

140
00:07:56,545 --> 00:08:00,345
Speaker 6:  them. Weird. That's a weird thing that is part of this. And it's because

141
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:03,665
Speaker 6:  Apple wanted to con, wanted to control those first set of photos.

142
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:06,545
Speaker 6:  That's fair. That's Apple's prerogative. It's their product. It's not launched

143
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:10,555
Speaker 6:  yet. I will just remind everyone, once

144
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:14,435
Speaker 6:  people buy this thing, all betts are off. Right. And like so this is

145
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:18,315
Speaker 6:  that pre-moment. Yeah. Where everyone's getting excited about an idea

146
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:21,995
Speaker 6:  that has a boundary. Right. And the boundary is still being very much set

147
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:25,115
Speaker 6:  by what Apple is saying and doing and allowing to be seen about this thing.

148
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:29,395
Speaker 6:  And eventually that boundary will disappear. And that to me, that's the

149
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:33,515
Speaker 6:  fun part. I keep saying that is actually the fun part. Some dummy is gonna

150
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:37,355
Speaker 6:  try to drive a cyber truck with a Vision Pro on their face. I know it's gonna

151
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:40,115
Speaker 6:  happen. I know the economics of YouTube and I know what it, that platform

152
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:43,795
Speaker 6:  rewards and like that will be crazy. And that is totally not

153
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:47,595
Speaker 6:  contemplated by what it's now. And so you're filling all the space between

154
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,195
Speaker 6:  what you are seeing and the dummy on YouTube driving the cyber truck with

155
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,955
Speaker 6:  Vision Pro with like your imagination. Which is the best part of any product

156
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:57,365
Speaker 6:  that is, by the way, the same thing is happening to the Rabbit R one right

157
00:08:57,365 --> 00:09:00,925
Speaker 6:  now. That is a product that people are paying money so their imaginations

158
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,605
Speaker 6:  can run wild and then the actual product will do something or not do something.

159
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,565
Speaker 6:  Yep. So I, just having like worn it once and then

160
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:11,285
Speaker 6:  worn it the second time and then seeing that explosion of imagery.

161
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:15,765
Speaker 6:  I was like, oh, apple got what it wanted out of this. It got to control this

162
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:19,445
Speaker 6:  first set of photos. And some of the photos legitimately look extraordinarily

163
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:22,925
Speaker 6:  cool. Like the dude from Cool Hunting and the hoodie. Yeah, yeah. It's cool.

164
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:26,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I I think those were in la I think they did demos in New York and LA

165
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,805
Speaker 6:  and I, I'm, I'm just gonna say this, I the

166
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:31,605
Speaker 9:  LA got the better, they got the better photos. All the all like we,

167
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,285
Speaker 9:  we saw our photos and we were like, oh, oh okay. You know, these are our

168
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:39,005
Speaker 9:  photos. Yeah, sure. And then we saw the LA photos and I was like,

169
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,285
Speaker 9:  excuse me. They have like really cool angles and everything like that. I

170
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:46,805
Speaker 9:  just look like, I look like I'm saying one does not simply

171
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:50,645
Speaker 9:  walk into virtual more door that is like, that is

172
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,805
Speaker 9:  what I look like in that thing. But you know, NELI was

173
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:57,885
Speaker 9:  the only one in New York who looked remotely cool because he was just sitting

174
00:09:57,885 --> 00:09:59,285
Speaker 9:  there refusing to pinchy pinch.

175
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:02,645
Speaker 6:  I did not, I loved it. There are two things I didn't play along with. And

176
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:06,565
Speaker 6:  if you look at these photos you can, you can just see that I'm a bratt.

177
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:10,565
Speaker 6:  I didn't do the hand gesture and I refused to tuck the cable

178
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:13,845
Speaker 6:  behind my back. Which did they ask you to tuck the cable behind your back?

179
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,405
Speaker 6:  They're when do you wanna tuck the cable? And I was like, no, I'm gonna hold

180
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:19,365
Speaker 6:  the battery pack in my hand. And they, what photos did we

181
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,525
Speaker 6:  receive? You cannot see me holding the battery pack in my hand.

182
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:26,245
Speaker 6:  The guy in the hoodie that cable was running down the back of his hoodie,

183
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:31,165
Speaker 9:  He legitimately stuck that battery pack down his hoodie just because like

184
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:34,405
Speaker 9:  you can't see the wires. Like that was immediately the first thing I clocked

185
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:38,245
Speaker 9:  in his photo besides like, wow, why does he get to look like Kylo

186
00:10:38,365 --> 00:10:42,205
Speaker 9:  Ren in vr? And I look like I'm telling

187
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:44,085
Speaker 9:  hobbits that they can't walk into virtual mortar

188
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:48,805
Speaker 6:  Anyhow. I I don't wanna like over index on it. Again, it is Apple's

189
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:52,045
Speaker 6:  product. It is their launch. That's how they wanna communicate about it.

190
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:56,405
Speaker 6:  Ev like I keep saying eventually people are gonna get the things and all

191
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,285
Speaker 6:  betts are off and that's fine. Like that's the gap. And I, I

192
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,085
Speaker 6:  personally think that this, this period in between

193
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:07,085
Speaker 6:  is when people get the most excited and I'm certainly not gonna tell people

194
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:10,005
Speaker 6:  not to be excited. Right? Sure. But I do think it is,

195
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:14,965
Speaker 6:  it's just important to note like, oh that is that I didn't take that photo.

196
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:18,365
Speaker 6:  That photo is not editorially controlled by me. We were given the photos

197
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,525
Speaker 6:  and you know, I'm a huge snob about these things as everyone knows all the

198
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,125
Speaker 6:  time. I'm constantly talking about what a huge disclosure. I didn't take

199
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:29,085
Speaker 6:  that photo. Right. The second piece and I'm actually, I

200
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:32,885
Speaker 6:  think this is where the gap between the experiencing it for the first time

201
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,885
Speaker 6:  and me experiencing it for the second time. There's some people who have

202
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:39,565
Speaker 6:  gotten this demo four times now. Wow. Is Apple is basically running the same

203
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:43,165
Speaker 6:  demo over and over again. They're not meaningfully different than the last

204
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:46,725
Speaker 6:  time. So the second time I found myself paying way more attention

205
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:51,295
Speaker 6:  to the hardware. Like the first time I was like, oh my gosh, the eye tracking

206
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,965
Speaker 6:  works that is extraordinarily impressive. Like I'm just, I've got my hands

207
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:58,045
Speaker 6:  on my sides, I'm clicking my fingers together. That just works. That is crazy

208
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:02,005
Speaker 6:  impressive. And this time I was like, okay, I'm wearing a headset on my

209
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:05,925
Speaker 6:  face. I'm absolutely looking at a screen and I'm

210
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,885
Speaker 6:  wondering what this thing can do and where its limits are. And they're, that

211
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:13,205
Speaker 6:  second time they were just more perceptible. I still dunno what they are.

212
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,925
Speaker 6:  'cause I was in a totally controlled 30 minute demo loop

213
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:20,805
Speaker 6:  with like a lot of people watching me and people around me watching what

214
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:24,525
Speaker 6:  I was watching on their iPads. Which is just a weird way to live

215
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:24,965
Speaker 6:  and

216
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,845
Speaker 8:  Kind of coming in and out of your vision as they want to. That's always fun.

217
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:28,125
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

218
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But the, the part where it's like you're, you're using the computer

219
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:33,525
Speaker 6:  and they can see what your eyes are looking at. Yeah. 'cause they're, they're

220
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:37,405
Speaker 6:  monitoring you on the iPad. It's like I didn't, I didn't push the

221
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:40,765
Speaker 6:  boundaries of the Vision Pro in that experience. I was like, yeah, I know

222
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:44,565
Speaker 6:  I'm looking at it. And that's a webpage. But It works like that. Things

223
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:48,365
Speaker 6:  still works even when you're trying to perceive the limits of

224
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:52,285
Speaker 6:  the hardware, which is really interesting. V I'm curious, how did you, you

225
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,165
Speaker 6:  this was like your first blush at it, you had kind of a different experience.

226
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:59,325
Speaker 9:  Yeah, so like, like I said, I read your thing about it,

227
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:03,325
Speaker 9:  but actually experiencing it for yourself, you're not prepared for two 4K

228
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:07,605
Speaker 9:  like screens being zoomed into your eyes and just like your

229
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:11,525
Speaker 9:  brain trying to like square that. There was

230
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:15,365
Speaker 9:  like a large part of it where I was like, oh my God, I can actually see where

231
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:19,285
Speaker 9:  my eyes are going. And like cognitively that was very

232
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,925
Speaker 9:  strange. And then, you know, a lot of it I just felt like,

233
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:26,405
Speaker 9:  you know, they were laughing at me 'cause I kept feeling like turning my

234
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,245
Speaker 9:  head all around and trying to move through the space and they were like,

235
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:33,205
Speaker 9:  ha ha you know, doesn't it look lifelike? And yes, but

236
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:37,125
Speaker 9:  also there were parts where my eyes started going

237
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,805
Speaker 9:  into overload. Like overload. My eyes were just darting around all of the

238
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:44,525
Speaker 9:  places. And that's when I think I started coming up against some limitations

239
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:47,885
Speaker 9:  that you were talking about where I realized, oh this is a screen

240
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:52,165
Speaker 9:  because you know, foveated rendering it's a thing and if your eyes are

241
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,965
Speaker 9:  going at 20 million miles a minute, it's very hard for it to catch up with

242
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:59,845
Speaker 9:  you. So there were parts where I was like, oh, I don't understand

243
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:03,045
Speaker 9:  why it looks so blurry when I'm looking at this one thing.

244
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:07,805
Speaker 9:  Oh it's because it hasn't caught up to my eyes going 20,000 miles a a

245
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,005
Speaker 9:  minute. 'cause I, I literally was just going like,

246
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:15,605
Speaker 9:  like my eyes hurt after a while because it was going

247
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,645
Speaker 9:  so fast. 'cause there was just so many different things to look at and trying

248
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:22,045
Speaker 9:  to see if, like, if I look at it a different way, is it gonna change? Oh

249
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:26,285
Speaker 9:  yes and no. So it's, it's really hard to describe what

250
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:30,125
Speaker 9:  it's like and what you're seeing in there, but it's,

251
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,765
Speaker 9:  it's very high res is one thing I can say.

252
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:36,125
Speaker 8:  I mean vi that kind of makes it sound like you didn't have a super good time

253
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,325
Speaker 8:  inside of this thing. Like I think there's an interesting thing for us

254
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,045
Speaker 8:  as, as reporters where you go in being like, I'm gonna ask questions of this

255
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:47,045
Speaker 8:  thing where like if I'm just like a regular person who bought it, I'm just

256
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:50,925
Speaker 8:  gonna put it on my head and see what happens. Did you? But like I

257
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:54,455
Speaker 8:  feel like most people's first experience, like NELI you were talking about

258
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:58,025
Speaker 8:  comes away with like the holy shit that was cool

259
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,425
Speaker 8:  and the like just the sheer technology, the, the pinchy pinch gesture,

260
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:05,465
Speaker 8:  the eye tracking. Like you just come away from being very impressed. It doesn't,

261
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:09,345
Speaker 8:  I didn't get the read that you came from it sort of blown away by your first

262
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:10,185
Speaker 8:  experience with it.

263
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:13,745
Speaker 9:  I think it's 'cause I had time to sit with it. Right. It's like when you're

264
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:17,345
Speaker 9:  in the moment you're just kind of like, oh my God I can see

265
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:21,465
Speaker 9:  the texture of the rock on this volcano that I'm sitting on. That

266
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,265
Speaker 9:  is not something I was expecting. I literally was just like, oh my God that

267
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:28,145
Speaker 9:  rock is so textured. Not a thing I was thinking about. But

268
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:31,865
Speaker 9:  then, you know, and I think it also has to do with the physicality

269
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:35,625
Speaker 9:  of the device. The longer the demo goes on, the more

270
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:39,025
Speaker 9:  aware you are that you're wearing something on your face. 'cause it's quite

271
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:43,065
Speaker 9:  heavy is what I'll say. Like I, at the end of my 30 minute

272
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:46,945
Speaker 9:  demo, I started getting a tension headache because I really did feel

273
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,785
Speaker 9:  it just like pressing on my face. And if you look at the pictures of the

274
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:53,785
Speaker 9:  journalists and if you look right here where the nose

275
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:58,345
Speaker 9:  meets like your nasal labial flow folds is like the correct term.

276
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:02,025
Speaker 9:  But if you look at that part right underneath the ski goggles, you can see

277
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:05,825
Speaker 9:  it pressing on a lot of people quite hard. You can see it in my photos

278
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:09,585
Speaker 9:  and you can see it in quite a few people's photos. So

279
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:13,785
Speaker 9:  like that was just a thing that kept bringing me back to the, to the

280
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:17,665
Speaker 9:  fact that I was wearing something on my head and taking me out of like

281
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:21,585
Speaker 9:  the wonder of all of it. Because there are parts where you're just blown

282
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:25,465
Speaker 9:  away. Like it is, I'm a Star Wars nerd, it is kind of cool to be in the

283
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:28,585
Speaker 9:  Disney Plus app and be like, oh I'm on tattooing Ooh, I'm watching a new

284
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:32,425
Speaker 9:  Hope. And that's kind of cool. But then you know, you think about it

285
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,225
Speaker 9:  for a bit, right? And it's sort of like, oh you kind of come down and I'm

286
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:40,105
Speaker 9:  curious NELI, for your experience be being the second time around, did

287
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:43,985
Speaker 9:  it just like wear off that quickly? 'cause I saw Marquez brownie's tweet

288
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:47,345
Speaker 9:  where he was like, first time, oh my god, wow. Second time still cool and

289
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:50,345
Speaker 9:  wow. But wow it's a little heavier. And the third time all he was thinking

290
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:53,105
Speaker 9:  about was the weight of it on his, on his head. So I'm just curious,

291
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:57,505
Speaker 6:  I'm so hesitant to say

292
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:01,945
Speaker 6:  fully formed thoughts about this thing because no one

293
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:05,825
Speaker 6:  has ever spent time with it without a babysitter ever.

294
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:08,785
Speaker 6:  And I, you know, this was in our comments and this is like the oldest thing

295
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:11,625
Speaker 6:  in the world and it's on threads. People are like, these reviews are great.

296
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:15,545
Speaker 6:  I'm like, these are not reviews at all. Like, not even a little

297
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:18,785
Speaker 6:  bit. This is the most highly controlled experience you can have in the best

298
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:22,665
Speaker 6:  possible circumstances. And yes, some people have had the experience more

299
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:26,425
Speaker 6:  than once. So they are beginning to form thoughts. Like

300
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:30,145
Speaker 6:  Marquez I think has had the experience four times. Other people

301
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:34,345
Speaker 6:  who did the spatial video demos earlier, or I guess

302
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,585
Speaker 6:  late last year, they've had the experience four or five times. Like

303
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:41,265
Speaker 6:  yes, you can begin to form some thoughts even if you just repeat an experience

304
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:44,905
Speaker 6:  over and over again. But I still don't know what it's like

305
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:48,985
Speaker 6:  to virtual screen a Mac into it and try to use this as a

306
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:52,725
Speaker 6:  computer monitor, which is a thing they really want you to do. I still don't

307
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:55,525
Speaker 6:  really know what it's like to browse the web in it. And they showed us, I,

308
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:59,365
Speaker 6:  we v and I both got to open Safari and go to The Verge by punching the dumb

309
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:02,845
Speaker 6:  virtual keyboard that makes no sense. Which we should absolutely talk about

310
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:06,565
Speaker 6:  more. And so I'm just very hesitant to say,

311
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:10,085
Speaker 6:  okay, this is what I'm beginning to think because that the

312
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:13,845
Speaker 6:  circumstances are, were so deeply controlled

313
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:18,415
Speaker 6:  that it's like, yeah, I think the thing's heavy, but I wasn't doing anything

314
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:21,895
Speaker 6:  like that immersive. Right. I wasn't, we are constantly context shifting.

315
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,655
Speaker 6:  Even in the demo. They're like, look at this thing, look at that thing. Here's

316
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,655
Speaker 6:  an F1 car. Take the wheels off you're done with the F1 car. Like they're

317
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:27,895
Speaker 7:  Moving you.

318
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,015
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They're just like showing you all the things you can do.

319
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:33,815
Speaker 9:  It's like taking a tour, you know, it's like, and now look at this and now

320
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:37,775
Speaker 9:  look at that and now look at this. So like just it, it is hard to sit

321
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:41,135
Speaker 9:  with any one experience more than like for a hot second because

322
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:45,175
Speaker 9:  you're getting shepherded through like a tour of what they

323
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:45,695
Speaker 9:  want you to see.

324
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:49,375
Speaker 6:  For example, they showed us photos and videos that were shot on the Vision

325
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:53,375
Speaker 6:  Pro in, in spatial video. And who am I, what, where am I

326
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:56,215
Speaker 6:  instinct. I was like, I'm gonna evaluate the quality of this camera. And

327
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:59,255
Speaker 6:  then seven seconds later we were onto the next thing, right? And I was like,

328
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:01,815
Speaker 6:  I have some feelings about this but I haven't spent any time with it. Right.

329
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:05,455
Speaker 6:  Like that, that's weird. And I just don't want to like, I'm trying very hard

330
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:09,055
Speaker 6:  to, to be careful. But the one thing I will

331
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:12,965
Speaker 6:  say is, boy is it obvious you're looking at a screen?

332
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:14,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I

333
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,365
Speaker 6:  Do have. Which is the thing they don't want you to think about.

334
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:20,005
Speaker 7:  I do have one evaluation question for you though. Joanna mentioned that she

335
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:23,725
Speaker 7:  was using a different strap this time and it felt a little lighter.

336
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:26,765
Speaker 7:  It was a little more pleasant for her to use. Joanna Stern friend of ours

337
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:30,445
Speaker 7:  from Washington Wall Street Journal, were you guys using the same strap?

338
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:32,405
Speaker 7:  Like no. Were you using a different strap this time?

339
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:36,725
Speaker 9:  No. So like, it was weird because they gave me the fabric

340
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,565
Speaker 9:  strap because when you set the thing up, you do like the face id thing

341
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:44,445
Speaker 9:  where you move your head around in a circle twice and that supposedly like

342
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:48,565
Speaker 9:  scans and gives you an estimate of like the fit for the light seal.

343
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:52,605
Speaker 9:  And so when I walked into the room, it was ready for me. I did not get a

344
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,885
Speaker 9:  choice as to which head strap I was gonna use. And I got the fabric strap,

345
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:57,845
Speaker 6:  The solo strap. The big, yeah,

346
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:01,565
Speaker 9:  Yeah, the solo strap. They showed me the other strap that

347
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:05,365
Speaker 9:  Joanna was and some of the other people were wearing. But I didn't

348
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:09,205
Speaker 9:  get to try it out. All I got told was that one gives more support,

349
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:12,845
Speaker 9:  which by the end of the 30 minutes I was like, I could have used more of

350
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,325
Speaker 9:  that support. Yeah. 'cause my hair was just

351
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:19,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah, because that's what you guys used when you tried it out at WWDC and

352
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:20,285
Speaker 7:  David. Yeah.

353
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:23,605
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well and that's, I mean, that, that's true of, of all the headsets

354
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:27,165
Speaker 8:  we've tried, right? Like you're, you're definitely making a compromise

355
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:31,125
Speaker 8:  between something that looks better and is easier to

356
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,845
Speaker 8:  adjust and put on versus something that ultimately lands in a more

357
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:38,805
Speaker 8:  comfortable place. Like the quest, you can, you can either get the

358
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:42,085
Speaker 8:  one strap or the strap that goes overhead or you can get the elite strap.

359
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:45,965
Speaker 8:  That's even more like, I think ultimately the answer is probably lots of

360
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:49,045
Speaker 8:  different versions of this, of this. And so it's, it's odd that Apple has

361
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,805
Speaker 8:  controlled it in the way that it has. But Neil, to your point, I think

362
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:56,485
Speaker 8:  your, your instincts are good and fair and right

363
00:20:57,585 --> 00:21:00,485
Speaker 8:  except that there's now a huge number of people as you're listening to this

364
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:04,125
Speaker 8:  podcast are having to decide whether to spend $3,500 pre-ordering this thing.

365
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:07,485
Speaker 8:  There are likely to be supply constraints. There's not gonna be a lot of

366
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:11,085
Speaker 8:  them. So for us to just say, oh wait a few weeks until everybody has it and

367
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:14,005
Speaker 8:  then you'll be able to get one is actually not helpful because by a few weeks

368
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,485
Speaker 8:  from now, it might be months from now before you can actually get one.

369
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:19,925
Speaker 6:  I feel like the people who are gonna spend $3,500 in the newest Apple gadget,

370
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,765
Speaker 6:  that money is already committed. They

371
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:22,245
Speaker 8:  Already know.

372
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:26,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You know, like, I, I think that, I mean

373
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,565
Speaker 6:  v is an actual reviewer. Like the, the thing that reviews do

374
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:35,805
Speaker 6:  now in 2024 is not always help people make

375
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,685
Speaker 6:  purchase decisions like some, sometimes it is. But for something like this,

376
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:43,645
Speaker 6:  it's actually the, to put it in a cultural context almost as much

377
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:46,965
Speaker 6:  as help people decide whether to buy it. 'cause there's Infiniti, there will

378
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,205
Speaker 6:  be infinity content about it.

379
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:51,085
Speaker 8:  I don't know that I agree in this case though. 'cause I think whether you

380
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:55,005
Speaker 8:  should buy a new phone or not, people mostly know the answer, right?

381
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:57,285
Speaker 8:  Like you're, you're gonna buy what you're gonna buy. And I think if there's

382
00:21:57,285 --> 00:22:00,085
Speaker 8:  something like wildly new and different, we have a responsibility to talk

383
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,605
Speaker 8:  about it. In this case, it's like we've been talking about most people have

384
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:07,045
Speaker 8:  no context for this thing. They have no experience of it. They have no idea

385
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:07,805
Speaker 8:  what it is.

386
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:12,165
Speaker 6:  I totally disagree with you. I totally disagree with you. Okay. Because Apple

387
00:22:12,225 --> 00:22:16,085
Speaker 6:  has been extraordinarily successful. It making sure people don't talk

388
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,525
Speaker 6:  about this thing like a VR headset. And it is

389
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:24,045
Speaker 6:  absolutely a VR headset. I just look at it, look at the

390
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:27,515
Speaker 6:  pictures. You can, there are pictures now I

391
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:29,955
Speaker 8:  Feel like you just agreed with what I said. People have no idea what this

392
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:30,115
Speaker 8:  thing

393
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,835
Speaker 6:  Is. No, they absolutely do. The Quest two, there are Quest twos everywhere.

394
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:36,675
Speaker 6:  The Quest three is not as popular as it should be. The Quest two is all over

395
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:40,355
Speaker 6:  the place all the time. I've put people in Quest

396
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:44,395
Speaker 6:  in our Quest two that I own and watched them get blown away by how textured

397
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:47,995
Speaker 6:  the dinosaur is. Like this is not so out there.

398
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:48,475
Speaker 6:  So

399
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:51,875
Speaker 8:  You're saying even people who don't think they know what this thing is, know

400
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,235
Speaker 8:  it more closely than they realize.

401
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:57,515
Speaker 9:  I, I'm gonna 100% agree with NELI on that because I walked into

402
00:22:57,515 --> 00:23:01,275
Speaker 9:  the going like I don't know what to expect. And the more I spent time

403
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:05,115
Speaker 9:  with it, I was like, oh, I've used a bunch of Apple products before. Actually

404
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:08,755
Speaker 9:  this feels quite familiar. Like I kind of do know what I'm using because

405
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:11,355
Speaker 9:  like you have the digital crown on the Vision Pro.

406
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,485
Speaker 9:  I have worn every single Apple watch since the Apple Watch series two.

407
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:20,725
Speaker 9:  So that was super familiar. And then, you know, on the other side there's

408
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:24,565
Speaker 9:  a flat side button that you use to take spatial photos and video that's just

409
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:28,485
Speaker 9:  the side button from the Apple watch. Like everything inside the, the

410
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:32,245
Speaker 9:  experience as well. It's like, it's like launching launchpad on your

411
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:36,365
Speaker 9:  Mac. If you've used Apple products, you kind of know Yeah what

412
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:40,245
Speaker 9:  it's like it's just Apple but make it vr. That's

413
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:42,485
Speaker 9:  kind of what what the Vision Pro is.

414
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:45,580
Speaker 6:  I point out, by the way, you should read that as a compliment to Apple's

415
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:49,485
Speaker 6:  designers, right? They took this very esoteric concept, they took the

416
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:53,365
Speaker 6:  best of their concepts from other products, they married them together and

417
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,645
Speaker 6:  they made it all seem very obvious it's Apple at its best. Like that's what

418
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,605
Speaker 6:  that company is good at. But I'm saying just conceptually, if you have

419
00:24:00,955 --> 00:24:04,725
Speaker 6:  worn another VR headset, and I'm confident that people listening to the show

420
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:08,685
Speaker 6:  have worn other VR headsets. We have been covering these products for a

421
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:12,405
Speaker 6:  decade, right? There's a decade of context for this thing.

422
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,285
Speaker 8:  Sure. But then how do you explain the fact that Apple is giving people 30

423
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:19,605
Speaker 8:  minute demos in a store in order to be able to do this? Like I just don't

424
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:19,845
Speaker 8:  because

425
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:23,885
Speaker 7:  Oh no, no I know this because not everybody has used VR headsets.

426
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:27,605
Speaker 7:  They are really like in, if you don't have access to one, if you don't have

427
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:31,285
Speaker 7:  a friend, if, if you don't have a friend who works at The Verge, you probably

428
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:34,685
Speaker 7:  don't have access to one. You probably haven't tried it. And so for a lot

429
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:37,845
Speaker 7:  of people, this will be one of their first experiences with VR outside of

430
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:41,805
Speaker 7:  like the horrible experience you see at a mall

431
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:45,725
Speaker 7:  or an arcade. And for it sounds like it is probably

432
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:49,085
Speaker 7:  one of the best VR experiences that you guys, that everybody on this call

433
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:52,565
Speaker 7:  has experienced. Including like those, what was it, the Vijo that's like

434
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:55,645
Speaker 7:  a thousand dollars, $1,500 headset. Like talk

435
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:58,445
Speaker 6:  About things people have no experience with. Right. You know the Vijo,

436
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:02,445
Speaker 7:  That's the only one I've used. I don't use any other headset before.

437
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:04,445
Speaker 8:  Yeah. This is better than that. Thank you. I can say fairly confidently,

438
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:08,925
Speaker 7:  It's just me out there using my bar Jo. But, but it, it's like a lot of people

439
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:12,165
Speaker 7:  probably they understand VR conceptually they might have used like a, a,

440
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:15,885
Speaker 7:  a garbage version and Apple is hoping that their version is so advanced

441
00:25:15,995 --> 00:25:19,965
Speaker 7:  it's so much improved that that it's something different. don don't

442
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:22,645
Speaker 7:  know if that's true. I haven't tried it. I don't know if that's true. It

443
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:26,365
Speaker 7:  sounds like so far from every one of you got your experiences

444
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:30,765
Speaker 7:  it's better, but it's not like, well we don't even need to call this

445
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:34,245
Speaker 7:  VR anymore, which is what Apple very much wants us to all hope.

446
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:38,045
Speaker 8:  I So do not buy the premise that most people understand VR conceptually.

447
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:38,885
Speaker 8:  I just don't,

448
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:42,285
Speaker 7:  No, don don't think they I don't think they do. I I I agree with you there

449
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:45,525
Speaker 7:  where I think like people probably understand conceptually this is a VR headset

450
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,045
Speaker 7:  but also don't understand conceptually what vr

451
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:51,925
Speaker 6:  Isn. Wait lemme try to split the difference. Let me, lemme try

452
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:56,565
Speaker 6:  don don't know if I'm gonna be successful. Lemme try. Okay. I think people

453
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:59,885
Speaker 6:  understand VR headsets. That's where I disagree with David. I think Ready

454
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:03,805
Speaker 6:  Player one is a movie that Steven Spielberg made. Like that's

455
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:07,725
Speaker 6:  a real thing that exists. People understand it. You can, Meta sells these

456
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:11,525
Speaker 6:  things. Every Christmas people buy VR headsets and they play

457
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:12,525
Speaker 6:  games. A few,

458
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:13,445
Speaker 8:  A few people do.

459
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:14,285
Speaker 6:  A few people.

460
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:15,845
Speaker 7:  40 million. 40 million I think

461
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:19,925
Speaker 6:  Quite a lot in the scheme of things, right? Like we've talked a lot on, on

462
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:23,765
Speaker 6:  the show about how supernatural is the thing that drives the

463
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:27,645
Speaker 6:  most me Quest sales to women and people over 40. Like sure

464
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:31,045
Speaker 6:  that's a growing business for them. So much so that the FTC tried to stop

465
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:34,725
Speaker 6:  them from buying it. So like there's just a thing there that is interesting,

466
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:38,685
Speaker 6:  right? There is some acknowledgement of the product category

467
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:42,365
Speaker 6:  by by some larger group of people and it has been around for a long time

468
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:45,645
Speaker 6:  and there is culture built around it, like Ready Player one other things.

469
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:50,325
Speaker 6:  Then there's Apple saying this is not a VR headset, this is spatial computing,

470
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:54,295
Speaker 6:  this is the future. It is, you know, I, one of the things that

471
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:58,135
Speaker 6:  I'm curious to think about when we actually get these things outside of control

472
00:26:58,135 --> 00:27:00,135
Speaker 6:  is like, what is the delta between

473
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:04,975
Speaker 6:  $400 Quest three and a $3,500

474
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:08,935
Speaker 6:  Vision Pro? I, it is impossible to know right now. Like we, you

475
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:11,415
Speaker 6:  have to just like sit there and look at both of them and experience both

476
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:12,135
Speaker 6:  of them and find out

477
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:12,935
Speaker 7:  It's the Vargo,

478
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:16,135
Speaker 6:  It's the var the thing right in the middle is the VJO a thousand dollars.

479
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:20,215
Speaker 6:  But you know, the, the, the Quest line is basically a

480
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:24,125
Speaker 6:  mid-range Android smartphone on your face. The Vision Pro

481
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,765
Speaker 6:  is an M two processor on your face. They're different. They're gonna have

482
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:31,525
Speaker 6:  different capabilities. Are the screens meaningfully different? I, I don't

483
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,645
Speaker 6:  know the answers to these questions,

484
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:38,225
Speaker 6:  but Apple's positioning this thing is not competing with the Quest three.

485
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:42,865
Speaker 6:  And the thing that jumped out at me in these demos is how few of

486
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:46,665
Speaker 6:  them were actually ar, right? Like they, the the Disney

487
00:27:46,735 --> 00:27:50,305
Speaker 6:  Plus app, they're putting you on tattooing, they're putting you in the Avengers

488
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:53,825
Speaker 6:  Tower. Those are straight up VR experiences. It doesn't matter what room

489
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:57,345
Speaker 6:  you're in, when you watch a spatial video that you, I

490
00:27:57,415 --> 00:28:01,305
Speaker 6:  brought in some spatial video that I shot of Max on my iPhone 15

491
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:05,345
Speaker 6:  Pro. You can watch it or you can like put it in like a theater setting. And

492
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:09,225
Speaker 6:  I was like watching like video and hala like, and it was awesome,

493
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:13,425
Speaker 6:  right? Like the thing they do in that demo, you're watching a

494
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,065
Speaker 6:  video and it will take this, the highlights of that video and

495
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:20,925
Speaker 6:  reflected onto the clouds below the mountain. It's so,

496
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:24,845
Speaker 6:  it's like so cool still a hundred percent a rendered VR

497
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:28,475
Speaker 6:  experience. Like where I'm like,

498
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:31,395
Speaker 6:  where's the ar? And they're like, here's a full-size F1 car in the room with

499
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:32,235
Speaker 6:  you just rip

500
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:35,555
Speaker 9:  Off the car, the the wheels off the ar the Alpha Romeo.

501
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:39,835
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They're like here's an Aston Martin F1 car in Jig space,

502
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:42,435
Speaker 6:  which is a cool app. And it's like, well one, okay, So I need a room that's

503
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:45,715
Speaker 6:  big enough to hold a car and then I'm gonna look at this car.

504
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:51,275
Speaker 6:  What now? Like where's the stuff, like where's the thing

505
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:55,115
Speaker 6:  where you're augmenting reality, where you're creating computing in space?

506
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:55,875
Speaker 6:  I would point

507
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,955
Speaker 8:  Out Apple's also not calling it an AR headset,

508
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:00,315
Speaker 6:  Right? They're saying spatial computing, Apple's

509
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:02,555
Speaker 8:  Trying to invent this other thing that currently means nothing.

510
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:07,355
Speaker 6:  Well it has some sort of definition, right? It's,

511
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:08,915
Speaker 6:  it's been around for a minute. Apple

512
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:12,555
Speaker 7:  Is spinning one, I just wanna correct I said Meta Quest two sold

513
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:16,355
Speaker 7:  40 million headsets. I'm wrong. It's sold 20 million as of

514
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,555
Speaker 7:  2023. So half of that.

515
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:20,955
Speaker 6:  All right. So my argument's a little weaker than it was before.

516
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:25,235
Speaker 7:  Sorry. Sorry about that. 20 million people have tried it at least probably.

517
00:29:25,275 --> 00:29:29,115
Speaker 7:  I mean we could say up to 40 if you count like the virtual boy

518
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:33,275
Speaker 7:  and the Quest one, David's like, no, we're not doing that math.

519
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:34,075
Speaker 7:  Refuse.

520
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:34,755
Speaker 6:  Putting

521
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:38,715
Speaker 9:  That aside, just putting that aside. How many people have tried iPhones?

522
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:42,205
Speaker 9:  How many people have tried MacBooks? Like I, what I really think Apple is

523
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:46,085
Speaker 9:  selling here is the apple ness of it. Like by calling it, you know, apple

524
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,965
Speaker 9:  always does stuff. It's like they give a different name for something that

525
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:52,685
Speaker 9:  we already know by another name. So by calling it spatial computing, they're

526
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:55,325
Speaker 9:  just going like, oh, but Apple's doing it now. Right? Can

527
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:58,765
Speaker 6:  I, but let me just, can I 20 million is, I, I understand it's not everybody.

528
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:03,205
Speaker 6:  The Xbox One, as of September, 2023 has

529
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:07,005
Speaker 6:  sold 33 million units and there's not a person on

530
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,765
Speaker 6:  earth that you're like, do you know what an Xbox is? And they're like, what

531
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:10,965
Speaker 6:  are you talking about? Yeah.

532
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:12,925
Speaker 8:  'cause we've had video game consoles for 40

533
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:16,205
Speaker 6:  Years and you've had VR headsets for a decade and

534
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:17,405
Speaker 8:  No one has tried them.

535
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:19,445
Speaker 11:  Like

536
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,645
Speaker 7:  20 million people

537
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:24,365
Speaker 8:  Six months after Atari came out. You think everybody on Earth knew what a

538
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,165
Speaker 8:  game console was?

539
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:30,215
Speaker 6:  Maybe. I mean, look, I wasn't born, they made the movie The Wizard about

540
00:30:30,215 --> 00:30:30,535
Speaker 6:  the first.

541
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:37,015
Speaker 8:  I just, I think like a, I think the way Apple markets its products

542
00:30:37,195 --> 00:30:40,935
Speaker 8:  at the beginning has next to nothing to do with what those

543
00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:44,695
Speaker 8:  products ultimately are. Like if you go back to 2007 and the iPhone 2010

544
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:48,175
Speaker 8:  and the iPad 2015 and the Apple Watch, like the way they talk about those

545
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:51,895
Speaker 8:  products Yeah. Is nothing like what they became, it just isn't.

546
00:30:52,075 --> 00:30:55,935
Speaker 8:  And So I think I I posted after you guys posted your pictures

547
00:30:55,935 --> 00:30:58,855
Speaker 8:  just being like saying basically if Apple can make these things cool to wear

548
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:02,295
Speaker 8:  in public, it'll be the marketing coup of the century. And I got, I mean,

549
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:05,095
Speaker 8:  dozens of replies from people being like, Apple's not marketing that way.

550
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,095
Speaker 8:  I was like, I don't give a shit what Apple is marketing it with. Like, I,

551
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:11,015
Speaker 8:  the five minutes after that thing goes on sale, somebody is going to take

552
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:14,615
Speaker 8:  this thing into a coffee shop and go on a run where, and that's like, that's

553
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:17,015
Speaker 8:  how this stuff works. You buy it, you do whatever the hell you want with

554
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:20,855
Speaker 8:  it. And I like, we have so

555
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:24,815
Speaker 8:  few answers still about what you're going to do inside of this thing

556
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:28,375
Speaker 8:  or how you use it or what it's like, or if it's a better monitor than my

557
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:28,615
Speaker 8:  monitor

558
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:32,295
Speaker 7:  Now David, that's not true. We're gonna have Fruit Ninja

559
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:33,895
Speaker 11:  Disney

560
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,775
Speaker 7:  Plus Disney plus. Yeah. Like a wealth of

561
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:38,255
Speaker 7:  opportunities.

562
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:38,975
Speaker 6:  Fantastic. How?

563
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:43,695
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I will say that I do think they expect people to take it

564
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,935
Speaker 9:  out into the world just because when I was getting my demo, like one of the

565
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:49,575
Speaker 9:  use cases they were ta talking to me about, I was like, you're gonna be on

566
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:53,375
Speaker 9:  a plane and you're still gonna be able to interact with your stewardess when

567
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:56,295
Speaker 9:  she asks you for whether you want a drink or a snack.

568
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:00,255
Speaker 6:  I'm dying to wear this thing on a plane. I've never wanted to do anything

569
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:04,015
Speaker 6:  more. I'm gonna go on like a status run just to collect my

570
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:07,815
Speaker 6:  whatever horrible new system Delta is doing now and wear, wear this headset

571
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:08,535
Speaker 6:  and

572
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:10,055
Speaker 8:  You're gonna have to charge it six times.

573
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:15,935
Speaker 6:  So we should talk about that. The, the, this is the stuff that is legitimately

574
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:19,975
Speaker 6:  new and like, honestly like a little silly and like in

575
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:23,935
Speaker 6:  the best way. So you're in a VR experience and we should just call it that

576
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:27,015
Speaker 6:  you're in a virtual environment inside the headset. You know, someone walks

577
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:30,935
Speaker 6:  up to you and you look at them, they just sort of fade into

578
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:31,615
Speaker 6:  view and then you

579
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:32,455
Speaker 9:  Can see it. It's really weird.

580
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:36,575
Speaker 6:  It's, it's odd in this actually this very funny moment in my demo,

581
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,005
Speaker 6:  I was like playing with this, right? Right. 'cause there's, I'm sitting on

582
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:43,805
Speaker 6:  a couch, there's people around me, the Apple people are around me and I forget

583
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:47,685
Speaker 6:  that they're all watching what I'm doing. So I just kept looking at

584
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:50,365
Speaker 6:  them to make them fade into view. And eventually one of them was just like,

585
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:54,205
Speaker 6:  looked up at me like, what are you doing? Because I was just staring at them.

586
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:57,885
Speaker 6:  You'd be like, are you, are you gonna appear? And they're like, and then

587
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,085
Speaker 6:  they appeared and they were looking at me.

588
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,765
Speaker 7:  How, how similar is it to that moment in Lord of the Rings where Gandalf

589
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:07,445
Speaker 7:  just slowly appears in like from the whiteness in front of

590
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:11,765
Speaker 9:  It. It's kind of like that. Like I just, the thing that came to my mind was

591
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:15,605
Speaker 9:  a Casper, the friendly ghost, just very slowly ghost of

592
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:19,605
Speaker 9:  VR future coming into your, into your periphery.

593
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:22,205
Speaker 9:  And it's very strange. Like don don't Hello

594
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:22,765
Speaker 7:  Devon Sowell,

595
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:26,725
Speaker 9:  They're kind of semi-transparent and just floating in the middle of

596
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:30,885
Speaker 9:  a volcano. Yeah. And it's, it's weird. But then

597
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:34,525
Speaker 9:  like viewing it from the outside because you know, we can't see ourselves

598
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:38,605
Speaker 9:  like the, I think the photo is the only like concept that I have of what

599
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:42,205
Speaker 9:  I look like in that thing. But you, we did get to see another person using

600
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:45,565
Speaker 9:  it and get a look at eyesight and that was just,

601
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:48,965
Speaker 9:  I I I'm still processing what eyesight looks like.

602
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:52,245
Speaker 7:  That's the, that's the, the, the eyes appearing on the front of the display.

603
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:55,805
Speaker 6:  And so the reason we weren't able to do that is to, to do that they've gotta

604
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:59,685
Speaker 6:  create what's called a persona for you. This is your, your virtual head that

605
00:33:59,685 --> 00:34:03,605
Speaker 6:  will appear in FaceTime calls. don don't. That's the only way

606
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:07,525
Speaker 6:  to describe what it is. And then that virtual face, when

607
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,405
Speaker 6:  you are in the headset and you start talking to someone, your eyes

608
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:13,645
Speaker 6:  show up on the front display of the headset.

609
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:16,125
Speaker 8:  It's fancy googly eyes. Like we we get it.

610
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:19,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's it's, it's weird. It's weird 'cause it's obviously a render of

611
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:19,925
Speaker 6:  eyes

612
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:23,965
Speaker 9:  And it's like a render of your eyes. Yeah. So like when you blink, it

613
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:26,525
Speaker 9:  blinks when your eyes are open, they're open. Did

614
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:29,125
Speaker 6:  You try to make eye contact with the person who's giving you the demo? I

615
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:33,685
Speaker 6:  I have never stared in another person's eyes the way that I stared into

616
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:36,685
Speaker 6:  that person's eyes and they were virtualized and I was like, are you looking

617
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:37,925
Speaker 6:  at me? Because I'm looking at you.

618
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:42,845
Speaker 9:  Huh? It's, it's, it's weird and like there's different cues that

619
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:46,725
Speaker 9:  happen with eyesight. So like if they're looking at

620
00:34:46,725 --> 00:34:49,525
Speaker 9:  you, you can tell they're looking at you, but if they're not looking at you

621
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:53,205
Speaker 9:  but their googly eyes are looking at you, you can kind of tell because there's

622
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:56,885
Speaker 9:  like a blue flash that comes up and that's supposed to signal to you that

623
00:34:56,995 --> 00:35:00,685
Speaker 9:  they're not focusing on you. They're doing other things within the headset.

624
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:03,925
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And if they're fully immersed, you don't see the the eyes at all. It's

625
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:06,285
Speaker 9:  just like that shimmer. This is that appears

626
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:09,005
Speaker 6:  Creating all new ways, unsettling ways to be rude to someone at a bar.

627
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:09,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

628
00:35:11,665 --> 00:35:15,285
Speaker 8:  But Apple's marketing says no one's gonna take it to a bar. Eli. Sure. No

629
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:15,845
Speaker 8:  one's gonna do that.

630
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,165
Speaker 9:  They're 100% gonna take it to a bar.

631
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:18,605
Speaker 6:  Here's

632
00:35:18,605 --> 00:35:20,205
Speaker 8:  The thing, Eli specifically is going to take it

633
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:24,165
Speaker 6:  To a bar. I'm gonna be hammered in this headset 24 7 on a plane. I live in

634
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,405
Speaker 6:  the sky now. Everybody just flying around wasted.

635
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:31,685
Speaker 6:  I'm dying to see two people in two headsets try to communicate

636
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:36,145
Speaker 6:  to each other. Yes. Like just think about the enormous amount of signal

637
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:39,645
Speaker 6:  processing that that needs to take place in order for those two people to

638
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:43,005
Speaker 6:  make eye contact. Right. You've gotta put on two headsets.

639
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:47,685
Speaker 6:  They both have to capture a virtual depiction of you.

640
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:52,685
Speaker 6:  Then it has to take a real time video of your eyes, process

641
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:56,565
Speaker 6:  that into a 3D model of your face, display that on

642
00:35:56,565 --> 00:36:00,205
Speaker 6:  a front screen, which is then captured by a camera in the second

643
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:04,165
Speaker 6:  headset, which then has to re-render that into reality to

644
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:08,045
Speaker 6:  display it to someone else's eyes, which are in turn being captured and displayed

645
00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:11,205
Speaker 6:  on a 3D rendering of that. And it's like, you could just take the headsets

646
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:15,165
Speaker 6:  off, but I'm dying. I'm absolutely dying to make this

647
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:16,845
Speaker 6:  happen and just be like, this was a lot of work.

648
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:20,485
Speaker 9:  So like if we were in the room and we were both wearing the Vision Pro and

649
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:24,365
Speaker 9:  talking to each other, would we just like materialize in each other's

650
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:25,485
Speaker 9:  screen while and would you be

651
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:26,005
Speaker 6:  Wearing the headset

652
00:36:26,145 --> 00:36:29,285
Speaker 9:  On the screen? Would we be wearing the headset and would I be seeing you

653
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:33,205
Speaker 9:  wearing the headset with your eyesight on in my screen

654
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:35,965
Speaker 9:  that's just like, it's breaking my brain. Or would it

655
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:39,445
Speaker 6:  Be the digital avatar when I say these were tightly controlled 30 minute

656
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:43,365
Speaker 6:  demos. What I mean is I asked to have that experience and I was met with

657
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:44,205
Speaker 6:  almost dead silence.

658
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:49,525
Speaker 6:  Nope. That's just not a thing that we're gonna, and I was like, okay, like

659
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:53,245
Speaker 6:  I understand like eventually I keep saying this, eventually people are gonna

660
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:57,005
Speaker 6:  get them. We will get a review unit by hook or by crook and we will

661
00:36:57,135 --> 00:37:00,925
Speaker 6:  spend time with this thing asking some questions right now that

662
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:04,365
Speaker 6:  fill the gap between everyone's imagination

663
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:08,725
Speaker 6:  and reality. And that gap. I I just gonna keep

664
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:12,525
Speaker 6:  underlining it. That gap is magical. Like that's the fun part of

665
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:15,845
Speaker 6:  like liking technology. You're like, you can imagine what these things can

666
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:19,405
Speaker 6:  do. And I'm, the reason I keep pointing at VR

667
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:22,885
Speaker 6:  headsets is like there's actually something you can ground these experiences

668
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:26,485
Speaker 6:  with that exists today at scale. They might not be as good,

669
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:31,285
Speaker 6:  but the gap between, I have a Quest Pro sitting here, the gap between

670
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:34,445
Speaker 6:  a Quest pro, which we did not give a good review to, and the Vision Pro

671
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:39,405
Speaker 6:  we, that's the thing to evaluate. It's not here's a magical new

672
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:43,035
Speaker 6:  experience. No, that's a headset. You can look at the pictures and you can

673
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:46,515
Speaker 6:  say, okay, this is a VR headset that contains a lot of ideas about the future

674
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:50,315
Speaker 6:  of computing for sure. but it very much has some of the

675
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:53,755
Speaker 6:  limitations that are inherent to this form factor. Like for example,

676
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:55,475
Speaker 6:  having to be on your head.

677
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:01,555
Speaker 6:  Like that's just a limitation of this form factor that is easily

678
00:38:01,565 --> 00:38:03,755
Speaker 6:  comparable to everything else that's ever been in this form factor.

679
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:09,035
Speaker 9:  I think one other question I have is like with the experience, like we're

680
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:12,155
Speaker 9:  grounding it in VR headsets that we've had, right? But the thing is that

681
00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:16,115
Speaker 9:  most of like 900000% of my experiences in

682
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:20,035
Speaker 9:  regular regular VR headsets is gaming. And there was

683
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:23,995
Speaker 9:  not a single gaming demo to be had in the Vision Pro. So

684
00:38:24,015 --> 00:38:27,715
Speaker 9:  that's kind of one thing that's been in the back of my head is just like,

685
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:31,595
Speaker 9:  okay, the obvious use case for VR is gaming in

686
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:35,565
Speaker 9:  this point in time. But I don't think we've heard a lot about

687
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:39,205
Speaker 9:  gaming in the Vision. Pro. We've heard about it like as entertainment and

688
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:43,205
Speaker 9:  some sort of productivity platform. But are am

689
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:45,045
Speaker 9:  I really gonna do that?

690
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:49,285
Speaker 7:  Well Meta bought all the good gaming companies for That's true. That's real.

691
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:52,445
Speaker 7:  So so that's part of it. And then like we we're getting Fruit Ninja and I

692
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:55,845
Speaker 7:  have no doubt Fruit Ninja is gonna have you with a virtual sword

693
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:58,725
Speaker 7:  cutting the stuff yourself, right? No, it's

694
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:01,125
Speaker 9:  Gonna be pinching. I'm gonna be pinching the fruit, pinching,

695
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:04,725
Speaker 7:  Pinching the kiwi. But like that's, that's what I, because I was looking

696
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:07,885
Speaker 7:  at that too. 'cause that's what I care about. No disrespect to everyone who

697
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:11,245
Speaker 7:  wants to have all of their meetings in a room with everybody wearing a headset.

698
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:15,565
Speaker 7:  You cannot wait. I, I I, I wanna, I wanna spend $3,500 on a sick gaming

699
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:19,045
Speaker 7:  headset. I don't but games.

700
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:21,445
Speaker 6:  It's called Vargo Games and it's now Alex.

701
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:25,685
Speaker 7:  Oh my God. I'm gotta go get a Vargo. The best experience.

702
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:30,045
Speaker 8:  I love that we're getting away from the pronunciation of that product just

703
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:33,165
Speaker 8:  a little bit. Every single time we say it, it just gets a, we get a little

704
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,125
Speaker 8:  further away from it.

705
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:35,805
Speaker 7:  Virgo. That's actually the day.

706
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:39,645
Speaker 8:  Love it. Yeah, it's the Virgo headset. It's the, it's the Vigo Morstein

707
00:39:39,645 --> 00:39:40,325
Speaker 8:  headset. All

708
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:43,005
Speaker 6:  This is, as much as we know about the Vision Pro we got, we did get to see

709
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,325
Speaker 6:  the Disney Plus app. There are some other drama. Netflix is not gonna make

710
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:49,285
Speaker 6:  an app for this thing that news broke this week. They're just like, use the

711
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:52,965
Speaker 6:  web browser. That's fine. That's weird. It sounds

712
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:57,205
Speaker 6:  like app developers as a whole have not rushed to this platform yet,

713
00:39:57,205 --> 00:40:01,145
Speaker 6:  which is fine. The platform doesn't

714
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:04,185
Speaker 6:  exist yet. I I wouldn't expect a bunch of app developers to be ready to ship

715
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:08,125
Speaker 6:  on day one, but there are some big questions about what this

716
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:11,885
Speaker 6:  thing is for how it actually works. It's $3,500 to get one.

717
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:15,885
Speaker 6:  You have to go, you have to either go to a store or upload your prescription

718
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:19,645
Speaker 6:  after scanning your face. Like there's a lot of steps between now

719
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:23,125
Speaker 6:  and lots of people having them. And I I think there's just a lot of caution

720
00:40:24,145 --> 00:40:25,565
Speaker 6:  in the, in the middle of all of that.

721
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,965
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And I think for the, the funny position Apple is in right now is it,

722
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:32,965
Speaker 8:  it's having to reckon with the fact that it's Apple and it's very

723
00:40:32,965 --> 00:40:36,765
Speaker 8:  hard for Apple to quietly launch a product. But

724
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:40,645
Speaker 8:  fundamentally this is, this is like a public beta of a thing, right? Like

725
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:43,765
Speaker 8:  Apple does not think this is the final version of this. It's not

726
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:47,845
Speaker 8:  what anyone believes is going to be where we're headed

727
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:52,285
Speaker 8:  overall in a decade. And this is the kind of thing that like

728
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,525
Speaker 8:  Snapchat would call like the next Rev of spectacles and still be like, this

729
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:59,165
Speaker 8:  is just a fun thing we're messing around with. And Apple because it's, apple

730
00:40:59,305 --> 00:41:02,645
Speaker 8:  has to come out and say this is the future. We've solved everything. This

731
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:06,605
Speaker 8:  is perfect. And it just puts you in a funny position as a marketing enterprise.

732
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:10,605
Speaker 6:  Here's a question I'll leave everyone because again, we, none of these reviews

733
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:14,005
Speaker 6:  stop calling them reviews. It's driving me bananas. Clearly

734
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:17,605
Speaker 6:  you people actually have to review them, whether it's us or whoever, whatever

735
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:21,005
Speaker 6:  reviewer you trust, like whatever independent reviewer you trust to spend

736
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,405
Speaker 6:  a lot of time with something and give you an opinion, go trust them. I hope

737
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:28,045
Speaker 6:  it's us. You know, we, we try really hard, but whoever, it's the question

738
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:31,855
Speaker 6:  that's gonna be embedded in all those reviews is if

739
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:35,405
Speaker 6:  Apple thinks the future is ar, which Tim Cook has said over and over and

740
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:39,295
Speaker 6:  over again and then this is a simulator of an AR

741
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:43,135
Speaker 6:  device, which is kind of the framework that I'm just gonna start with, right?

742
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:47,075
Speaker 6:  This is a simulator of the thing they want to make. Well then showing

743
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:49,995
Speaker 6:  us all these VR experience, having a light seal

744
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,155
Speaker 6:  blocking you off from the real world and putting you on top of the volcano

745
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:58,105
Speaker 6:  or an Avengers tower, that's not ar right? That is,

746
00:41:58,105 --> 00:42:01,465
Speaker 6:  those are VR experiences and there's a real tension in this product

747
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:05,825
Speaker 6:  between the things a VR headset is inherently good at, especially when you

748
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:09,705
Speaker 6:  spend all the money on it and the AR simulator it might wish to

749
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:13,665
Speaker 6:  be. And I, I truly do not know how they will pick those paths.

750
00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:16,585
Speaker 6:  'cause if you just want a pair of glasses or you just wanna a pair of contact

751
00:42:16,585 --> 00:42:20,465
Speaker 6:  lenses, which you know is the end state that they have talked about

752
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:20,985
Speaker 6:  in the past,

753
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:25,385
Speaker 6:  wow, you're not gonna be able to block off flight and put everybody in Avengers

754
00:42:25,385 --> 00:42:25,545
Speaker 6:  Tower.

755
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:31,825
Speaker 6:  So like how, how do you, how do you get from here to there if everything

756
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:32,985
Speaker 6:  good about this product is vr?

757
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:36,505
Speaker 7:  I mean that's the same challenge that Meta's facing, right? Who's who said

758
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:39,185
Speaker 7:  the same thing, AR is our future, this is where we're going. All of this

759
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:42,905
Speaker 7:  stuff is just a step on the way to ar I think they're just, I think

760
00:42:42,965 --> 00:42:46,585
Speaker 7:  meta's just more open about this than, than Apple is. I think Apple is in

761
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:50,265
Speaker 7:  the exact same place Meta is with only their high-end

762
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:54,145
Speaker 7:  headsets gonna probably sell better and perform better.

763
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:58,265
Speaker 7:  But otherwise, I think ultimately it's, it's, it's very similar space of

764
00:42:58,365 --> 00:43:01,385
Speaker 7:  we we're not there yet. The, the technology doesn't exist. The things we

765
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:05,225
Speaker 7:  wanna do to make AR cool isn't possible yet. So we're gonna do

766
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:09,585
Speaker 7:  the, we're gonna do a really good VR headset because that's the way you start

767
00:43:09,585 --> 00:43:13,145
Speaker 7:  to normalize the stuff that's gonna be necessary for ar. But

768
00:43:13,695 --> 00:43:16,905
Speaker 7:  Apple's much quieter about it because they want us all to think that they've

769
00:43:16,905 --> 00:43:20,385
Speaker 7:  created a new form of computing when everybody knows they just made a really

770
00:43:20,385 --> 00:43:21,065
Speaker 7:  cool VR headset.

771
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:24,545
Speaker 6:  Well, no, if you listen to David, no one on earth has ever heard of a VR

772
00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:25,345
Speaker 6:  headset before.

773
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,825
Speaker 8:  That's definitely what I said. That's right. Well and ultimately

774
00:43:30,745 --> 00:43:34,265
Speaker 8:  this is the first VR headset anyone has ever tried on in the history of the

775
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:38,305
Speaker 8:  universe. Apple actually invented the term vr. Just this. No,

776
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:41,225
Speaker 8:  I think ultimately what, what all these companies seem to be saying is that

777
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,225
Speaker 8:  VR is a feature of ar, right? Like those two things are not mutually exclusive

778
00:43:45,485 --> 00:43:49,345
Speaker 8:  and ultimately you want both. But the

779
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:53,305
Speaker 8:  thing we can do right now is pretty good vr, there's not

780
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:56,825
Speaker 8:  much evidence yet that we can do pretty good ar And I think,

781
00:43:57,665 --> 00:44:01,065
Speaker 8:  I think to Alex's point, like Meta's pretty open about that. Some of the

782
00:44:01,065 --> 00:44:04,825
Speaker 8:  other headset makers are pretty open about that. And Apple, just by virtue

783
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:08,825
Speaker 8:  of the way the company operates, is not allowed to say it's

784
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:12,745
Speaker 8:  bad at anything. So instead it's going to keep imagining new futures

785
00:44:12,745 --> 00:44:16,185
Speaker 8:  that it has invented even as it goes through the same stages as everybody

786
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:16,705
Speaker 8:  else. Yeah,

787
00:44:16,985 --> 00:44:20,905
Speaker 6:  I feel even that we had demos, we replay this thing again, I'm just

788
00:44:20,985 --> 00:44:23,105
Speaker 6:  gonna keep repeating this and we should move on to talk about what's going

789
00:44:23,105 --> 00:44:25,945
Speaker 6:  on with the Apple Watch and the Galaxy ring. Yeah. 'cause we, we do have

790
00:44:25,985 --> 00:44:28,905
Speaker 6:  V here, but we don't know anything yet.

791
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:33,445
Speaker 6:  Even the people I know who, who've worn this thing five times, they don't,

792
00:44:33,445 --> 00:44:37,205
Speaker 6:  they don't know anything. It's, we have to take these things outside of

793
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:41,125
Speaker 6:  Apple's control. We have to try to wear them on airplanes and

794
00:44:41,185 --> 00:44:44,245
Speaker 6:  behind cyber truck wheels. Can you imagine the cyber truck wiper in this

795
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:47,165
Speaker 6:  thing? Do you think the cyber truck wiper moves too fast for the Vision Pros

796
00:44:47,165 --> 00:44:48,565
Speaker 6:  cameras? I'm dying to know

797
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:54,005
Speaker 6:  there's a whole other thing that happens when a product is actually released

798
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:58,085
Speaker 6:  that is the important thing and that I'm just gonna keep everybody focused

799
00:44:58,105 --> 00:45:01,925
Speaker 6:  on that because you, you cannot know right now. And that to me

800
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:05,925
Speaker 6:  is utterly fascinating. Like it is kind of the best moment. 'cause

801
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:09,285
Speaker 6:  anything is possible and everyone can have all the dreams they want. And

802
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:12,285
Speaker 6:  then you're gonna put on the headset in your weird rendered eyes, you're

803
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:15,405
Speaker 6:  gonna look into the eyes of someone you love and you're gonna be like, am

804
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:17,565
Speaker 6:  I still cool? And there's gonna be an answer

805
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:19,325
Speaker 7:  If you ask that question. No.

806
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:23,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This is what I do with every piece of new technology. I just look at

807
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:25,885
Speaker 6:  someone directly in the eyes and say, am I still cool?

808
00:45:27,365 --> 00:45:29,885
Speaker 6:  And that person is always Becky and she's always like, you never were.

809
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:32,045
Speaker 11:  Yeah.

810
00:45:33,225 --> 00:45:36,405
Speaker 6:  All right. Very quickly, let's talk about what's going on with the Apple

811
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:40,365
Speaker 6:  Watch, which it's somewhat simple I guess V

812
00:45:40,715 --> 00:45:41,005
Speaker 9:  Walk,

813
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:42,205
Speaker 6:  Its band again. It's banned again. It's

814
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:46,125
Speaker 9:  Banned again. So, you know, it's just been kind of a back and forth

815
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:50,085
Speaker 9:  where, this is really funny again because usually I think Apple is so

816
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:53,685
Speaker 9:  used to winning that it, the fact that it's losing a lot

817
00:45:53,955 --> 00:45:57,205
Speaker 9:  against Massimo right now is just kind of very

818
00:45:58,285 --> 00:46:01,725
Speaker 9:  fascinating to watch. Just because, so earlier this week Bloomberg

819
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:06,765
Speaker 9:  was suggesting that, you know, apple is going to drop the

820
00:46:06,815 --> 00:46:10,805
Speaker 9:  blood oxygen feature from the Watches in order to get around the

821
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:14,805
Speaker 9:  ITC ban. And that basically US Customs and

822
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:18,645
Speaker 9:  Borders was like, yeah that works, that's cool. That totally awesome. But

823
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:22,565
Speaker 9:  that wasn't confirmed right at the beginning of this week. And then yesterday

824
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:26,765
Speaker 9:  basically we heard that the Federal Appeals Court was like, yeah, we're not

825
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:30,725
Speaker 9:  gonna extend the stay on this ban. So starting today 5:00 PM

826
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:35,205
Speaker 9:  ban's back on, you can't sell this stuff. And then, you know, late last

827
00:46:35,205 --> 00:46:39,125
Speaker 9:  night, apple was like, haha, guess what guys? We're gonna sell versions without

828
00:46:39,145 --> 00:46:42,765
Speaker 9:  the blood oxygen feature. So that's how we're getting around that those went

829
00:46:42,765 --> 00:46:46,485
Speaker 9:  on sale today. So that's, that's currently where we're at

830
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:50,325
Speaker 9:  with the Apple Watch band. And it's just, it's just like, just

831
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:53,925
Speaker 9:  pay Massimo. Like you could just end this, you could license this.

832
00:46:54,285 --> 00:46:58,085
Speaker 6:  A deeply funny cline of this story is it Massimo added a new

833
00:46:58,085 --> 00:47:01,725
Speaker 6:  board member this week and it's Bob ch Oh yeah. X Disney,

834
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:04,605
Speaker 6:  CI. That's about, it's fantastic. It's pretty good. He's gonna make it tech,

835
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:07,965
Speaker 6:  it's pretty good. He's gonna make it tech's pretty good. He, since leaving

836
00:47:07,965 --> 00:47:11,605
Speaker 6:  Disney, his, I, I think he was always bald, but he's gotten more

837
00:47:11,605 --> 00:47:14,645
Speaker 6:  aggressively bald in a particular way. The photo of him that's like he's

838
00:47:14,645 --> 00:47:18,405
Speaker 6:  joining Mass Award is like, oh, Thanos is on the board now. Like that's

839
00:47:18,405 --> 00:47:19,165
Speaker 6:  very much the vibe.

840
00:47:21,245 --> 00:47:25,165
Speaker 6:  It's, it's pretty good. This is just a Right, the, the

841
00:47:25,285 --> 00:47:27,765
Speaker 6:  ban is still temporary 'cause Apple has an appeal going

842
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:32,365
Speaker 6:  and the hardware is still in there. It's just not accessible by the software.

843
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:35,285
Speaker 6:  And the, your point has always been like this is the least useful piece of

844
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:35,445
Speaker 6:  the Apple

845
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:39,405
Speaker 9:  Watch. It is. It is the least useful as of right now.

846
00:47:39,495 --> 00:47:43,445
Speaker 9:  Piece of tech in most smart Watches to be quite frank because

847
00:47:43,675 --> 00:47:47,325
Speaker 9:  like what are you using blood oxygen for, right? And

848
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:51,165
Speaker 9:  COVID, everyone was all on pulse oximeters because you could tell whether,

849
00:47:51,265 --> 00:47:54,085
Speaker 9:  you know, you were, your lungs were working, whether they were breathing.

850
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:58,045
Speaker 9:  But the thing that people have to realize is that these are not

851
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:02,045
Speaker 9:  FDA cleared pulse oximeters, right? They're wellness gadgets. You are

852
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,285
Speaker 9:  taking a spot check at any given second

853
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:09,855
Speaker 9:  as to how much blood oxygen you have in a second, you have

854
00:48:09,855 --> 00:48:13,775
Speaker 9:  to sit there for 15 seconds. Still. You can't move for it to

855
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:17,655
Speaker 9:  tell you what this estimate of your blood oxygen is. And for the vast

856
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:21,775
Speaker 9:  majority of people who are not having any kind of lung issues

857
00:48:21,955 --> 00:48:25,815
Speaker 9:  or whatever, if you're a healthy 99.9% of the time

858
00:48:25,835 --> 00:48:29,335
Speaker 9:  is it's gonna be over 95. And you're gonna find out I don't have to worry

859
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:32,695
Speaker 9:  about anything. The other use case for pulse,

860
00:48:33,105 --> 00:48:37,055
Speaker 9:  pulse oximeters within these smart Watches is to tell you

861
00:48:37,055 --> 00:48:40,815
Speaker 9:  whether you have breathing disturbances at night. So you're just gonna get

862
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:45,415
Speaker 9:  an average in the morning of what your SP O2 level was.

863
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:49,255
Speaker 9:  And for 99% of people who are healthy, you are gonna see that it's either

864
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:53,575
Speaker 9:  above 95%, you're good, or it's gonna be below that and you're

865
00:48:53,575 --> 00:48:57,295
Speaker 9:  gonna be like, oh, I'm a side sleeper, so it messed up. Therefore,

866
00:48:57,455 --> 00:49:01,135
Speaker 9:  I can't really trust that because if you are a side sleeper, it is going

867
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:04,975
Speaker 9:  to tell you that it's lower. Like Garmin tell me regularly that my SPO

868
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:08,815
Speaker 9:  two level at night is 91%, which is, that's, that's like

869
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:11,695
Speaker 9:  you should be going to the hospital if you start getting to those levels.

870
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:15,815
Speaker 9:  So it is not really all that trustworthy. The only thing

871
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:19,535
Speaker 9:  is, like in the mid to long term, these companies are looking at Pulse

872
00:49:19,815 --> 00:49:23,695
Speaker 9:  oximeters as a way to detect sleep apnea. The only company that's

873
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:27,895
Speaker 9:  remotely close is Withings. And even they're not saying it's sleep apnea,

874
00:49:27,895 --> 00:49:31,855
Speaker 9:  right? They're saying breathing disturbances, which may indicate

875
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:35,495
Speaker 9:  at some point that you may be inclined to sleep

876
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:39,575
Speaker 9:  apnea, so maybe you should go to a doctor. So it's, it's really not that

877
00:49:39,575 --> 00:49:42,935
Speaker 9:  serious of a feature right now. It's, it's just not So

878
00:49:42,965 --> 00:49:46,375
Speaker 7:  Keep buying the wa If you were planning to buy a watch the Apple Watch, you

879
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:47,575
Speaker 7:  can still just go buy it,

880
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:51,575
Speaker 9:  You can still go buy it, it's fine. The SE is not impacted.

881
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,295
Speaker 9:  And you know, it's really funny 'cause whenever I recommend products

882
00:49:55,635 --> 00:49:59,255
Speaker 9:  for most people, I say, you're gonna be fine with the se, you're, it's totally

883
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:02,655
Speaker 9:  good for you. And they're all, they just have fomo. They just want all the

884
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:04,855
Speaker 9:  stuff. Yeah, it's cool looking. Yeah.

885
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:08,255
Speaker 6:  What if I need to light up an 80 decibel siren in the middle of the woods?

886
00:50:09,565 --> 00:50:10,935
Speaker 7:  Come on. Se can't do that.

887
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,535
Speaker 9:  No, no, I can't do that. But neither can the regular series nine.

888
00:50:15,605 --> 00:50:17,695
Speaker 9:  It's only the Ultra that's gonna be doing that for

889
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:18,535
Speaker 6:  You with it. What, what do think have Victoria?

890
00:50:18,925 --> 00:50:22,095
Speaker 9:  Well, I know you have the Ultra, I know you have the Ultra,

891
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:26,855
Speaker 6:  The, you also got to try the actual Massimo smartwatch at CSS with

892
00:50:27,185 --> 00:50:30,365
Speaker 9:  The features. Yes. So they're calling it the Freedom, which is just like,

893
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:34,245
Speaker 9:  okay, are you serious? That's a wow. Yes. It's called the Freedom. It's 46

894
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:38,445
Speaker 9:  millimeters. It's a big chunky boy. And they told me like a bazillion

895
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:42,405
Speaker 9:  times So, I have to say it, it's an early prototype. It might not look like

896
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:46,245
Speaker 9:  this when it comes out later this year, but you know, it's

897
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:50,045
Speaker 9:  kind of the, they, they, they were very much telling me that

898
00:50:50,045 --> 00:50:53,805
Speaker 9:  they're putting out a smart or smartwatch. So this is a smartwatch that's

899
00:50:53,805 --> 00:50:56,485
Speaker 9:  gonna have timers, it's gonna have notifications, it's gonna work with your

900
00:50:56,485 --> 00:50:59,685
Speaker 9:  phone more fluidly, it's gonna have a better app experience. It's gonna have

901
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:03,365
Speaker 9:  health tracking experiences, which sounds a awful lot like an Apple Watch,

902
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:07,285
Speaker 9:  right? So they keep telling me that the reason they're putting out this

903
00:51:07,285 --> 00:51:11,205
Speaker 9:  watch is so that it can tout its sensor accuracy because

904
00:51:11,665 --> 00:51:15,245
Speaker 9:  all these companies be out here according to Massimo with

905
00:51:15,245 --> 00:51:18,965
Speaker 9:  sensors that are not accurate, that are not giving you the, the actual

906
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:22,285
Speaker 9:  results that you can trust. But they're gonna give you the health results

907
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:25,845
Speaker 9:  that you can trust and it's gonna be smarter. So, you know, you sit there

908
00:51:25,845 --> 00:51:29,285
Speaker 9:  and you're like, so you're trying to kill Apple, right? This is the Apple

909
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:33,125
Speaker 9:  Watch killer. And they're like, no, this is, this is about us. This is about

910
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:36,965
Speaker 9:  us and our sensor accuracy. And you know, of course they have to say that,

911
00:51:37,105 --> 00:51:40,805
Speaker 9:  but you just look at this thing and you're like, I see you are coming

912
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:44,605
Speaker 9:  for the consumer wearable space. And they're not the only medical tech company

913
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:48,405
Speaker 9:  doing that. You know, at CES I saw Murano. Murano is a medical

914
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:51,805
Speaker 9:  tech company and they're coming out with a smart ring that has also got,

915
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:55,365
Speaker 9:  you know, they're in the last stages of FDA clearance for their particular

916
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:59,125
Speaker 9:  sensors. In the past, I've seen medical tech companies come out with

917
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:03,085
Speaker 9:  like Omron, they had a blood pressure smartwatch at

918
00:52:03,145 --> 00:52:06,565
Speaker 9:  CES. So it's, it's not the first time that the medical community has been

919
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:10,325
Speaker 9:  like, we can try hardware, we can make that work. Yeah. But

920
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:13,805
Speaker 9:  it's, it's just very interesting given the backdrop of the Apple Watch band

921
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:16,685
Speaker 9:  that massimo's out here and they're like, Hey, we got hardware too.

922
00:52:17,355 --> 00:52:21,205
Speaker 7:  Well, speaking of rings, there was also the big Samsung announced that

923
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:24,685
Speaker 7:  they're gonna do a smart ring. Now, is it gonna be as cool as, as

924
00:52:25,315 --> 00:52:28,405
Speaker 7:  Aura and Ano and everybody else hopping in the space now?

925
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:32,365
Speaker 9:  Well the the cool thing about the Galaxy ring is that they were like, hello,

926
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:36,005
Speaker 9:  we're here. And then there's a ring and it's spinning in space and there's

927
00:52:36,005 --> 00:52:38,445
Speaker 9:  stars on it and it looks gorgeous. And they're like, the

928
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:40,965
Speaker 8:  Video was sick. Yeah, if you haven't seen the video, you should go watch

929
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:43,965
Speaker 8:  it. The little like reveal video of it is, is pretty badass.

930
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:46,845
Speaker 9:  Very cool. And then they're like, and we will give you no details. Yeah.

931
00:52:47,305 --> 00:52:51,205
Speaker 9:  And, and I, you know, and I was looking at that. I was like, okay, but

932
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:55,205
Speaker 9:  also this is clearly gonna be a sleep tracking or a

933
00:52:55,285 --> 00:52:58,885
Speaker 9:  competitor just because, you know, at CES and I wrote the story

934
00:52:59,185 --> 00:53:03,005
Speaker 9:  at CES, there were a buttload of smart rings, more smart rings than

935
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:06,965
Speaker 9:  I've ever seen in my life at CES at all different price points

936
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:11,005
Speaker 9:  at all different like feature sets. So for Samsung to come out here

937
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:14,685
Speaker 9:  and be like, yeah, we're also getting on the Smart Ring train.

938
00:53:15,645 --> 00:53:18,805
Speaker 9:  I think this is the year of the Smart Ring. I really do. And you know, it's

939
00:53:18,805 --> 00:53:22,685
Speaker 9:  one thing to go to CES and say ano nobody, unless

940
00:53:22,685 --> 00:53:24,965
Speaker 9:  they read my work, nobody knows what ano is.

941
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:30,205
Speaker 9:  If I say Zep and Amaz Fit or a Maze Fit this budget

942
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:33,805
Speaker 9:  thing that has basically replaced Fitbit in that, for that market,

943
00:53:34,075 --> 00:53:36,925
Speaker 9:  they're coming out with a smart ring, people are like gonna be like, okay,

944
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:39,125
Speaker 9:  you wearable nerd. Sure, sure. You're saying

945
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:42,725
Speaker 6:  No, no, this episode of Virgin Cast, we got Vargo, we got Marano.

946
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:47,285
Speaker 6:  I want to call out Shelly, it's a DIY smart home company. We're just name,

947
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:48,365
Speaker 6:  let's just name little companies.

948
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:52,325
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So you know, like if I say that there's a bunch of small companies

949
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:55,645
Speaker 9:  out here that are putting out smart rings, this is gonna be a thing. People

950
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:59,445
Speaker 9:  are gonna be like, okay, v Pat, pat, you know, you're a wearable nerd. Of

951
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,885
Speaker 9:  course you think that's gonna happen. So for Samsung to come out and be like,

952
00:54:03,185 --> 00:54:07,125
Speaker 9:  hi guys, we got a Galaxy ring. I'm just super vindicated

953
00:54:07,265 --> 00:54:10,925
Speaker 9:  in my seat over here just going like, yes. See I told you, I told you

954
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:15,005
Speaker 9:  smart rings are gonna be a thing. This is a thing that people are really

955
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:18,445
Speaker 9:  thinking about and it's because there's a huge segment of the population

956
00:54:18,595 --> 00:54:22,125
Speaker 9:  that is really mad that they have to charge their smart Watches

957
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,245
Speaker 9:  if they want sleep tracking. So the obvious answer here is that you

958
00:54:26,245 --> 00:54:29,765
Speaker 9:  have a smart ring, which is gonna be more accurate for that

959
00:54:29,905 --> 00:54:33,645
Speaker 9:  anyway because the bottom of your finger is more accurate for heart rate

960
00:54:33,805 --> 00:54:37,205
Speaker 9:  tracking. It's more accurate for blood oxygen tracking and the battery's

961
00:54:37,205 --> 00:54:41,125
Speaker 9:  gonna last longer than your Galaxy watch that lasts maybe two days if you're

962
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:44,565
Speaker 9:  really good about battery management. So, I really

963
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,005
Speaker 9:  think that this is their answer to that.

964
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:50,565
Speaker 6:  Also, just from a market perspective, the wrist has been claimed.

965
00:54:50,945 --> 00:54:54,805
Speaker 6:  Yep. Yes. You cannot replace the thing that's on many people's wrists. So

966
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:57,405
Speaker 6:  you're like, ah, let's try fingers. Ah,

967
00:54:58,035 --> 00:55:01,845
Speaker 9:  There's that. And I, I am just curious because the one thing

968
00:55:02,105 --> 00:55:05,485
Speaker 9:  at CES that stood out to me was a maze fit with their ring was just like,

969
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:09,485
Speaker 9:  this is gonna be a standalone, but also it could be a companion

970
00:55:09,485 --> 00:55:13,365
Speaker 9:  wearable for your wearable. So it's gonna work with their smart Watches.

971
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:17,565
Speaker 9:  And I think if s Samsung really wants to be smart about it, they'll do

972
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:21,045
Speaker 9:  the same. They'll be like, okay, this is your smart ring and it's gonna work

973
00:55:21,045 --> 00:55:24,605
Speaker 9:  with your smartwatch. We've spent the last two years ready

974
00:55:24,605 --> 00:55:25,845
Speaker 9:  working really, really

975
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:28,845
Speaker 6:  Hard ready? Can I just tell you on the sleep track? Can my, my, my graph

976
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:32,725
Speaker 6:  of the wearable success formula, it's just 15 more axes

977
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:36,765
Speaker 6:  just sprouted off that graph. I was diligent and I

978
00:55:36,765 --> 00:55:39,805
Speaker 6:  didn't, I didn't say anything about the Vision Pro and the graph,

979
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:44,845
Speaker 6:  but now we're like, we got wearables on top of wearables, the

980
00:55:44,985 --> 00:55:46,445
Speaker 6:  we need exponent in this thing.

981
00:55:47,105 --> 00:55:50,325
Speaker 9:  I'm telling you, this is where we're headed because not everyone wants a

982
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:54,285
Speaker 9:  wearable that's gonna be, you know, an extension of their phone. Right.

983
00:55:54,445 --> 00:55:58,125
Speaker 9:  A lot of people who are going for the smart ring, they don't want the

984
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:02,085
Speaker 9:  notifications, they don't want their kind of, I think it's the next evolution

985
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:06,045
Speaker 9:  of the fitness band, which is like RIP. Yeah, it's gone. The smartwatch has

986
00:56:06,045 --> 00:56:07,005
Speaker 9:  devoured it completely.

987
00:56:07,385 --> 00:56:11,045
Speaker 6:  I'm telling you. So, so the, the, the dorkiness cost is going down the curve

988
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:16,205
Speaker 6:  see, and then the, the cost cost is low. Smart

989
00:56:16,205 --> 00:56:19,645
Speaker 6:  rings we're up in the upper right depending on how they look and whether

990
00:56:19,645 --> 00:56:23,485
Speaker 6:  or not you have to refer to them as the Galaxy ring, which depending on who

991
00:56:23,485 --> 00:56:26,245
Speaker 6:  you are, either a huge positive or a huge negative

992
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:30,325
Speaker 9:  From like the, the one person who I saw online who got to see the actual

993
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:33,725
Speaker 9:  prototype. It's supposedly very light. It supposedly looks nice.

994
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:38,405
Speaker 9:  We'll see the render. It looks like an aura ring, but yeah, make it

995
00:56:38,585 --> 00:56:42,285
Speaker 9:  Galaxy. So we'll, we'll see. 'cause a lot of people will look at an aura

996
00:56:42,285 --> 00:56:46,005
Speaker 9:  ring and be like, oh that looks really cool. And then other people will be

997
00:56:46,005 --> 00:56:48,965
Speaker 9:  like, that is so chunky. Get it the f away from me.

998
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:53,565
Speaker 9:  Absolutely not. But you know, on the design front, I think smart

999
00:56:53,565 --> 00:56:57,085
Speaker 9:  rings are starting to evolve a bit. I saw the EV ring. It's very cool. It

1000
00:56:57,085 --> 00:57:00,845
Speaker 9:  has a little gap up top. So when you're bloated and you can't

1001
00:57:00,905 --> 00:57:04,845
Speaker 9:  get your ring off, it can still come off. That's I'm just saying Samsung,

1002
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:08,885
Speaker 9:  that's right out there. You can copy that and make the Galaxy ring next

1003
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:09,485
Speaker 9:  level. So

1004
00:57:09,485 --> 00:57:13,325
Speaker 6:  Well that's the Galaxy ring to powered by ai. Alright, speaking of AI and

1005
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:17,245
Speaker 6:  Galaxy S, we gotta let you go. We gotta take a break. We found way

1006
00:57:17,245 --> 00:57:20,925
Speaker 6:  over in the first segment. That's how we're doing today. bvi, thank you so

1007
00:57:20,925 --> 00:57:23,085
Speaker 6:  much for coming on. We're gonna take a break. We're gonna be back and talk

1008
00:57:23,085 --> 00:57:26,605
Speaker 6:  about the rest of Galaxy unpacked and the S3 four. We'll be right back.

1009
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:32,695
Speaker 12:  Something strange is happening in Hollywood. I'm not talking

1010
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:35,895
Speaker 12:  about that guy that got to host the Golden Globe. Yo, I got

1011
00:57:35,915 --> 00:57:36,135
Speaker 6:  The

1012
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:40,255
Speaker 12:  Gig 10 days ago. I'm talking about the secret musicals.

1013
00:57:40,965 --> 00:57:44,495
Speaker 6:  What was that? The lord? It's the Queen Bee Regina George. Don't look her

1014
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:45,055
Speaker 6:  in the eye.

1015
00:57:46,395 --> 00:57:49,455
Speaker 13:  You could be really hot if we change like everything.

1016
00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:53,535
Speaker 12:  A new Mean Girls movie comes out today. It promises it is not your

1017
00:57:53,575 --> 00:57:57,455
Speaker 12:  Mother's Mean Girls, which rude. But also what does that mean?

1018
00:57:57,955 --> 00:58:01,615
Speaker 12:  The trailer never tells you. But check out this footage from a recent screening

1019
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:10,215
Speaker 12:  that audience groaning when not Lindsay Lowen, Katie

1020
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:13,815
Speaker 12:  Heron starts singing. They're bummed because they didn't want a musical,

1021
00:58:14,285 --> 00:58:17,975
Speaker 12:  they didn't necessarily know they were getting a musical, but they got

1022
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:21,935
Speaker 12:  a musical. And it's not just Mean Girls Why Hollywood

1023
00:58:22,035 --> 00:58:25,655
Speaker 12:  is hiding its musicals this week on Today Explained.

1024
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:33,135
Speaker 6:  All right, we're back. There's more Samsung to talk about. You. ready?

1025
00:58:34,005 --> 00:58:35,615
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I'm ready. Phones.

1026
00:58:35,755 --> 00:58:39,735
Speaker 6:  Phones. So it's fascinating that Samsung chose to do the Galaxy event

1027
00:58:40,775 --> 00:58:41,935
Speaker 6:  a week after CES.

1028
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,095
Speaker 7:  I is

1029
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:47,055
Speaker 6:  It, it's fascinating. Google showed up at the Samsung event more

1030
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:51,935
Speaker 6:  assertively, I guess more loudly than they did at cs. Yep.

1031
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:52,935
Speaker 7:  Yes, that's true.

1032
00:58:53,205 --> 00:58:56,855
Speaker 6:  Just quite a lot of dynamics there, right? Yeah. Samsung can attract a bunch

1033
00:58:56,855 --> 00:59:00,575
Speaker 6:  of attention without css, so it makes sense, but it, Google put a lot of

1034
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:03,895
Speaker 6:  its AI features in the S 24 this year, which is really interesting.

1035
00:59:04,045 --> 00:59:07,975
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Empowered by the Google Gemini, right? Like the, the the large language

1036
00:59:07,975 --> 00:59:11,615
Speaker 7:  model that a lot of the generative stuff is gonna be doing is Google Gemini,

1037
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:14,255
Speaker 7:  which I don't think is surprising. I know some people were like, why wasn't

1038
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:18,175
Speaker 7:  it chat GPT or, or Microsoft, whatever Microsoft is doing, and it

1039
00:59:18,175 --> 00:59:22,125
Speaker 7:  makes sense, Google makes Android, they work closely together.

1040
00:59:22,745 --> 00:59:25,365
Speaker 7:  Why wouldn't they use the people who are already doing this stuff in their

1041
00:59:25,365 --> 00:59:25,765
Speaker 7:  own phones?

1042
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:29,365
Speaker 8:  Google and Samsung also desperately need each other to compete with Apple.

1043
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:33,245
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Like neither, neither one of them can beat Apple on their

1044
00:59:33,245 --> 00:59:36,525
Speaker 8:  own. They've both tried and both have failed and

1045
00:59:37,185 --> 00:59:40,725
Speaker 8:  the way to do it is together and it's working pretty well. But

1046
00:59:41,305 --> 00:59:45,205
Speaker 8:  my big takeaway from this event is I am super, super bearish on

1047
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:48,645
Speaker 8:  the future of the Pixel now. Yes, same Google clearly

1048
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:52,525
Speaker 8:  believes Samsung's phones are the flagship Android phones now

1049
00:59:52,825 --> 00:59:54,805
Speaker 8:  and that it should treat them as such. That,

1050
00:59:54,805 --> 00:59:55,685
Speaker 7:  That was my vibe too.

1051
00:59:56,565 --> 01:00:00,525
Speaker 6:  I just wanna point out that Samsung strikes so little fear into

1052
01:00:00,525 --> 01:00:04,005
Speaker 6:  Apple's heart that Tim Cook refuses to pronounce the name Samsung

1053
01:00:04,005 --> 01:00:04,605
Speaker 6:  correctly.

1054
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:05,765
Speaker 7:  What, what does he

1055
01:00:05,765 --> 01:00:09,725
Speaker 6:  Say? He says Samsung every time. Every time. And

1056
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:12,125
Speaker 6:  I can't tell if it's, it's a diss. I can't tell if he just doesn't know.

1057
01:00:12,245 --> 01:00:15,245
Speaker 6:  I, it's just go listen to him say it sometime.

1058
01:00:15,865 --> 01:00:16,325
Speaker 7:  That's a

1059
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:20,245
Speaker 6:  Diss. Tizen has caused no fear in this man's brain like

1060
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:24,125
Speaker 6:  that you can do the EEG and you're like, Tizen and nothing lights up.

1061
01:00:24,475 --> 01:00:25,245
Speaker 7:  He's like, Tizin.

1062
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:31,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's like, that's like a a a, an older southern person does. They

1063
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:33,645
Speaker 7:  always like to be like, oh I just forgot the name. Is that how you're supposed

1064
01:00:33,645 --> 01:00:36,685
Speaker 7:  to pronounce it? And they never, they refuse to learn.

1065
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:39,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's very good. Yeah. Anyway. But I agree with you David, is that's

1066
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:42,445
Speaker 6:  my way of saying I agree with you. Like it needs to be the combo platter.

1067
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:45,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. And I think Apple, there's a lot, you know, between Apple and

1068
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:48,725
Speaker 6:  Google and the search deal and all this stuff, but on their own, I think

1069
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:52,525
Speaker 6:  Apple's like what And that's, they, they are both still very reactive to

1070
01:00:52,525 --> 01:00:55,525
Speaker 6:  Apple in that particular way. But we should talk about the S 24 'cause it

1071
01:00:56,505 --> 01:00:59,365
Speaker 6:  is meaningfully ahead of the iPhone in certain ways. Yeah. Alex

1072
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:02,845
Speaker 8:  And this will almost certainly be the Android phone of 2024. Right, right.

1073
01:01:02,845 --> 01:01:05,205
Speaker 8:  Like it's wild to say that the second week of January, but I think we can

1074
01:01:05,205 --> 01:01:05,405
Speaker 8:  fairly,

1075
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:08,525
Speaker 6:  This will be the benchmark, at least the United States. This will be the

1076
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:08,965
Speaker 6:  benchmark. Yeah.

1077
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:12,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah. 'cause they don't, they don't do the note, like the note isn't kind

1078
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:15,205
Speaker 7:  of the big landmark anymore for them. It is, it is this S series. And so

1079
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:19,085
Speaker 7:  we got the S 24, which is continues to be kind of the smallest one.

1080
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:23,045
Speaker 7:  It's small, it's 6.2 inch display, like that's

1081
01:01:23,165 --> 01:01:26,925
Speaker 7:  enormous. But, and then there's the S 24 plus, which is

1082
01:01:26,945 --> 01:01:30,765
Speaker 7:  6.7 inch display and then the S 24 Ultra,

1083
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:34,165
Speaker 7:  which can't have the same size display. So it is

1084
01:01:34,185 --> 01:01:38,085
Speaker 7:  6.8 inches. Way bigger. Just, just yeah,

1085
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:41,725
Speaker 7:  just a tiny, tiny bit bigger. Same with the batteries. Like the S 24 is like

1086
01:01:41,725 --> 01:01:45,525
Speaker 7:  a 4,000 milliamp battery. And you're like, okay cool. And the S 24 plus is

1087
01:01:45,775 --> 01:01:49,605
Speaker 7:  4,900. Cool. And then just a little bit

1088
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,485
Speaker 7:  bigger, the S 24 ultras at 5,000

1089
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:57,445
Speaker 7:  and, and big, big cameras here. Like I'm, I'm curious for you guys, you guys

1090
01:01:57,445 --> 01:02:01,125
Speaker 7:  geek out, you in particular DLI geek out about these cameras a lot more than

1091
01:02:01,165 --> 01:02:05,005
Speaker 7:  I do. The, the backside of the S 24 and the S 24 plus

1092
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:08,405
Speaker 7:  is both a 50 mega sal wide camera

1093
01:02:08,995 --> 01:02:12,645
Speaker 7:  with a 12 megapixel Ultra wide and a 10 megapixel

1094
01:02:13,655 --> 01:02:17,645
Speaker 7:  three x optical zoom and the 30 x space zoom. So you're getting kinda the

1095
01:02:17,645 --> 01:02:21,445
Speaker 7:  same camera package in both of those. And then the S 24 Ultra

1096
01:02:22,065 --> 01:02:25,685
Speaker 7:  is totally, it feels totally different. It's a 200 megapixel wide,

1097
01:02:26,595 --> 01:02:30,405
Speaker 7:  same Ultra wide, same tele zoomo, but then a 50

1098
01:02:30,675 --> 01:02:34,445
Speaker 7:  megapixel tele five x zoom instead of the space zoom. Which

1099
01:02:34,445 --> 01:02:36,965
Speaker 7:  like that feels cool.

1100
01:02:37,345 --> 01:02:40,485
Speaker 8:  And that's the one, so one of the things that Samsung said about that Zoom

1101
01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:44,285
Speaker 8:  camera is that because they took it from the S

1102
01:02:44,285 --> 01:02:48,245
Speaker 8:  23 Ultra, which had a 10 x zoom, they actually took it down to five. But

1103
01:02:48,245 --> 01:02:51,645
Speaker 8:  because they upped the resolution so much, what Samsung claimed, at least

1104
01:02:51,645 --> 01:02:55,205
Speaker 8:  to Alison Johnson on our team is that you'll get more image quality at 10

1105
01:02:55,245 --> 01:02:58,365
Speaker 8:  x zoom just because you have so many more pixels to play with. even that

1106
01:02:58,365 --> 01:03:02,285
Speaker 8:  you're doing digital cropping and digital zoom is not a

1107
01:03:02,285 --> 01:03:04,205
Speaker 8:  thing, it's just cropping your photos and

1108
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:09,245
Speaker 8:  everyone should know that. But the, the thesis at least is that you're still

1109
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:12,125
Speaker 8:  getting higher image quality just because it's capturing so much more light

1110
01:03:12,425 --> 01:03:16,125
Speaker 8:  in the 50 megapixel sensor. So I think that the math of that is

1111
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,525
Speaker 8:  fascinating and I'm really curious to see how that stacks up in reviews.

1112
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:20,615
Speaker 8:  But the cameras are nuts.

1113
01:03:20,955 --> 01:03:24,695
Speaker 6:  So, I think there's the math and there's also just the caution

1114
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:28,815
Speaker 6:  to the wind AI processing that Samsung is doing. Sure.

1115
01:03:28,815 --> 01:03:31,855
Speaker 6:  Like why will those photos look good? Because Samsung's like, make 'em look

1116
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:35,415
Speaker 6:  good and the AI's like your wish is my command. Here's some shit I made up.

1117
01:03:36,955 --> 01:03:37,605
Speaker 6:  What is a photo?

1118
01:03:38,035 --> 01:03:39,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Moon's everywhere

1119
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:40,005
Speaker 6:  We're,

1120
01:03:40,005 --> 01:03:41,805
Speaker 8:  This took longer than I expected, honestly.

1121
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:44,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I was really impressed with Eli. I was like, I should have like a little

1122
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:45,485
Speaker 7:  clock time here.

1123
01:03:46,275 --> 01:03:49,045
Speaker 6:  Well, we'll come back to that. 'cause there there's one particular, what

1124
01:03:49,045 --> 01:03:52,005
Speaker 6:  is a photo rabbit hole that we should fall down? But there's there's a bunch

1125
01:03:52,005 --> 01:03:53,445
Speaker 6:  of other AI stuff here going on.

1126
01:03:53,555 --> 01:03:54,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah. There is like

1127
01:03:54,445 --> 01:03:55,285
Speaker 6:  Google powered AI stuff.

1128
01:03:55,315 --> 01:03:58,365
Speaker 7:  Yeah. There's a ton of stuff. Like they're, they're going all in on translation,

1129
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:01,845
Speaker 7:  which was for the longest time. That was a really cool Pixel feature was

1130
01:04:01,845 --> 01:04:05,605
Speaker 7:  that you could kind of translate things on the fly and, and transcribe things

1131
01:04:05,705 --> 01:04:09,605
Speaker 7:  as well. And, and that's coming to, to the Samsung, the S 24

1132
01:04:09,825 --> 01:04:13,725
Speaker 7:  lineup. And then on like the image side of things, there's a lot

1133
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:17,125
Speaker 7:  of photo editing that you're gonna be able to do. Now you're, you can just

1134
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:20,165
Speaker 7:  like circle something and it should get rid of it. Kind of that Photoshop

1135
01:04:20,165 --> 01:04:24,045
Speaker 7:  demo we see all the time now on the S 24, which is

1136
01:04:24,045 --> 01:04:27,525
Speaker 7:  both cool and hilarious 'cause people were like using it to circle out like

1137
01:04:28,255 --> 01:04:28,925
Speaker 7:  watermarks.

1138
01:04:29,395 --> 01:04:32,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Samsung's own attempt to make, you know, things are AI copyright or

1139
01:04:33,025 --> 01:04:35,885
Speaker 6:  AI generated was to put a watermark and then you can tell the AI to remove

1140
01:04:35,885 --> 01:04:36,845
Speaker 6:  the watermark. It's

1141
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:40,005
Speaker 7:  Beautiful. Perfect. No, no, it's beautiful.

1142
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:43,725
Speaker 7:  Those were like the kind things that I was particularly excited about just

1143
01:04:43,725 --> 01:04:47,405
Speaker 7:  because I love to not have to open Photoshop anymore. The

1144
01:04:47,545 --> 01:04:50,685
Speaker 7:  the, the longer I can go without opening it, the better for me.

1145
01:04:50,885 --> 01:04:53,405
Speaker 8:  I will say the one that really got me was the idea of being able to make

1146
01:04:53,445 --> 01:04:57,005
Speaker 8:  a 120 frames per second slow motion video out of anything.

1147
01:04:57,965 --> 01:04:58,965
Speaker 6:  This is the rabbit hole.

1148
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:01,365
Speaker 8:  It was this your rabbit hole. This is the rabbit hole. Oh, I thought the

1149
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:04,245
Speaker 8:  rabbit hole was gonna be the thing where you can, you can move the horizon

1150
01:05:04,505 --> 01:05:08,245
Speaker 8:  on a photo and it'll fill the edges instead of having to crop the edges.

1151
01:05:08,245 --> 01:05:11,245
Speaker 8:  When you take your, like you take a rectangular photo and you turn it a little

1152
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:14,085
Speaker 8:  to correct the horizon, you're gonna have these empty spaces in the corners.

1153
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:18,565
Speaker 8:  The S 24 will generatively fill those corners to

1154
01:05:18,565 --> 01:05:20,085
Speaker 8:  make it still feel like a rectangle. Yeah. But

1155
01:05:20,085 --> 01:05:23,925
Speaker 7:  I can do that in Photoshop. Like I definitely never, ever done

1156
01:05:23,925 --> 01:05:24,965
Speaker 7:  that in Photoshop.

1157
01:05:25,245 --> 01:05:28,965
Speaker 8:  Alex we have had the, can you do this in Photoshop and does that negate all

1158
01:05:28,965 --> 01:05:31,805
Speaker 8:  of this argument? Yes. So many times, and I'm bringing it back and I think

1159
01:05:31,805 --> 01:05:33,645
Speaker 8:  that it does, but we have to let NELI have this

1160
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:38,125
Speaker 6:  No filling in the edges. Like whatever, because the edges are usually not

1161
01:05:38,145 --> 01:05:41,925
Speaker 6:  the subject of your photo. Right. So like, am I lying about

1162
01:05:41,925 --> 01:05:45,685
Speaker 6:  whether there's a little bit more water there? Maybe

1163
01:05:45,705 --> 01:05:47,565
Speaker 6:  I'm lying, maybe who cares? Right? Like it's

1164
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:48,845
Speaker 7:  A little more all, what

1165
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:52,685
Speaker 8:  Is it? This is so much more like blase than you were about the Pixel

1166
01:05:52,685 --> 01:05:53,005
Speaker 8:  eight.

1167
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:54,645
Speaker 6:  I've been beaten down, man, I

1168
01:05:54,645 --> 01:05:57,765
Speaker 8:  Can move someone over on a bench. That's outrageous. But there's more water

1169
01:05:57,765 --> 01:05:58,445
Speaker 8:  over there. Yes.

1170
01:05:58,445 --> 01:06:01,445
Speaker 6:  They keep, they keep moving The light are levels of outrage. I'm, this is

1171
01:06:01,445 --> 01:06:05,005
Speaker 6:  nuance real time nuance is being developed also. That's so boring.

1172
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:09,165
Speaker 6:  I do think that's not a photo. It's just not I trying to gin someone up

1173
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:13,045
Speaker 6:  into an outrage cycle over, there's a little more water even. I can't

1174
01:06:13,045 --> 01:06:14,285
Speaker 6:  do that. But all right.

1175
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:15,765
Speaker 7:  The a hundred frames per

1176
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:18,485
Speaker 6:  Second, I, I took 50 frames and I made all the people look at me in a way

1177
01:06:18,485 --> 01:06:22,445
Speaker 6:  that never happened. It's still dangerous territory to me. Yeah. The

1178
01:06:23,065 --> 01:06:26,965
Speaker 6:  the Ultra slow motion. The most dangerous territory.

1179
01:06:27,075 --> 01:06:30,725
Speaker 6:  Because now this thing is generating entire frames that

1180
01:06:31,135 --> 01:06:34,845
Speaker 6:  never happened. Right. Entire frames and

1181
01:06:35,045 --> 01:06:38,525
Speaker 6:  creating a video, a slow motion video, which people are more

1182
01:06:38,755 --> 01:06:42,645
Speaker 6:  attuned to thinking is real than any. Watch this back in slow motion, let's

1183
01:06:42,645 --> 01:06:46,085
Speaker 6:  see what really happened. And every other frame is a lie.

1184
01:06:47,265 --> 01:06:50,695
Speaker 6:  Right? If you, if you go from 30 frames a second to

1185
01:06:50,815 --> 01:06:54,775
Speaker 6:  120 frame slow motion over the same duration, boy that's, that's

1186
01:06:54,815 --> 01:06:58,785
Speaker 6:  a lot of frames that never happened. And, and Samsung's

1187
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:00,825
Speaker 6:  like, yeah, we put a watermark on it and then you can be like, yeah, I get

1188
01:07:00,825 --> 01:07:04,585
Speaker 6:  rid of the watermark. It goes away. Like this is,

1189
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:08,105
Speaker 6:  when I say this is the, what is a photo apocalypse? Like this is more apocalyptic.

1190
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:08,865
Speaker 6:  What is a photo shit?

1191
01:07:09,165 --> 01:07:12,625
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna throw a wrench in this because the TV companies weren't they already

1192
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:14,665
Speaker 7:  doing a lot of this already? Yeah.

1193
01:07:14,935 --> 01:07:17,065
Speaker 8:  This is just what interpolation is. Yeah.

1194
01:07:17,175 --> 01:07:19,865
Speaker 7:  Just making up frames and sticking them in there. Only it's now the people

1195
01:07:19,865 --> 01:07:21,905
Speaker 7:  who are like, we're gonna invent the moon. Well

1196
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:25,105
Speaker 6:  Wait, wait, it, it really depends. Like there's a lot, there's a lot of different

1197
01:07:25,105 --> 01:07:28,785
Speaker 6:  ways TV companies have done this. The dumbest way they've done it is like

1198
01:07:28,785 --> 01:07:32,065
Speaker 6:  three, two pull downs where you have a refresh rate on a TV of 60 hertz whatever,

1199
01:07:32,245 --> 01:07:36,105
Speaker 6:  and you're throwing 24 frames per second content up there and you just double

1200
01:07:36,205 --> 01:07:39,535
Speaker 6:  the frames. Right? Right. You do three frames of something, then two frames,

1201
01:07:39,535 --> 01:07:43,135
Speaker 6:  that's a three, two pull down. Like that's fine. You're just showing sort

1202
01:07:43,135 --> 01:07:45,815
Speaker 6:  of double the frames to match your refresh rate. Then there's a little bit

1203
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:48,575
Speaker 6:  of the AI upscaling that is occurring on TVs right now.

1204
01:07:50,005 --> 01:07:53,825
Speaker 6:  Fine. That's weird. But there, like,

1205
01:07:53,825 --> 01:07:57,465
Speaker 6:  there's something else happening there that is not this thing

1206
01:07:57,755 --> 01:08:01,185
Speaker 6:  where you're like, I am gonna capture this video or I'm gonna insert any

1207
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:04,425
Speaker 6:  video into this editor and it will now create a slow motion video.

1208
01:08:05,365 --> 01:08:09,265
Speaker 6:  It will actually generate outside of real time other frames.

1209
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:13,105
Speaker 6:  Whereas a TV is like, I'm gonna play back this video to you and

1210
01:08:13,565 --> 01:08:17,285
Speaker 6:  in real time and an ephemeral way, I will throw away this data when I'm done

1211
01:08:17,285 --> 01:08:21,005
Speaker 6:  with it. Create new detail or create frames in the middle. Like there are

1212
01:08:21,005 --> 01:08:24,965
Speaker 6:  very few TVs in the market today. None I think that

1213
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:28,205
Speaker 6:  you can just feed a video signal to, and it will create a slow motion video

1214
01:08:28,265 --> 01:08:29,805
Speaker 6:  and claim that that is a correct slow signal.

1215
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:33,325
Speaker 7:  So is the difference for you. One goes real fast and one goes real slow.

1216
01:08:33,705 --> 01:08:37,325
Speaker 6:  The difference for me is this thing generates files that you can then pass

1217
01:08:37,325 --> 01:08:41,125
Speaker 6:  around. Okay. As information. Whereas a TV is just doing

1218
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,365
Speaker 6:  dis different display tricks.

1219
01:08:42,545 --> 01:08:45,645
Speaker 8:  In theory, if you scroll frame by frame through one of these 120 frames or

1220
01:08:45,645 --> 01:08:49,525
Speaker 8:  second videos, you will land on a series of frames that never

1221
01:08:49,555 --> 01:08:52,005
Speaker 8:  existed in the world. Yeah.

1222
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:55,485
Speaker 6:  You will land on a series of moments that are entirely generated.

1223
01:08:55,695 --> 01:08:58,525
Speaker 6:  Right. And you will not be able to trust those moments.

1224
01:08:58,785 --> 01:09:02,485
Speaker 8:  And that trips over some line that like, it takes

1225
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:05,205
Speaker 8:  the eyes from this photo and the eyes from this photo and the eyes from this

1226
01:09:05,205 --> 01:09:08,085
Speaker 8:  photo and puts them all into one photo because that's where all the eyes

1227
01:09:08,085 --> 01:09:11,845
Speaker 8:  looked best. Like that at least is those pixels were real and

1228
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:15,485
Speaker 8:  captured and existed in the world. Putting them together is one thing,

1229
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:20,085
Speaker 8:  but with this, you're actually creating something no Pixel of which

1230
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:22,085
Speaker 8:  was captured in the real world.

1231
01:09:22,265 --> 01:09:25,965
Speaker 6:  Yes. 0% of those pixels that were captured. I'll just give, I I,

1232
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,045
Speaker 6:  I'll give you an example. It's the NFL playoffs.

1233
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:33,405
Speaker 6:  Was it a catch? Right? Like, here's a real thing that like people argue about

1234
01:09:33,405 --> 01:09:36,485
Speaker 6:  all the time. What is this a catch and what do we do? We crop in, we slow

1235
01:09:36,485 --> 01:09:39,525
Speaker 6:  motion and now we're like, we're gonna let a computer

1236
01:09:40,265 --> 01:09:43,525
Speaker 6:  decide whether that ball hit the ground somewhere in the middle and

1237
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:46,565
Speaker 8:  It's gonna have to guess where a football went, which is not following a

1238
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:47,885
Speaker 8:  normal trajectory. I feel like

1239
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:49,645
Speaker 7:  That's not gonna happen.

1240
01:09:50,665 --> 01:09:54,005
Speaker 6:  Why not? Wait, I'm sorry. If you, if football fans are gonna like,

1241
01:09:54,555 --> 01:09:55,725
Speaker 6:  like literally on the

1242
01:09:55,885 --> 01:09:56,885
Speaker 7:  Football plans, it's

1243
01:09:56,885 --> 01:09:58,365
Speaker 8:  Not convinced until you said that example.

1244
01:09:58,505 --> 01:10:01,805
Speaker 6:  Now they're gonna hold up there in Samsung phones to the tv, capture the

1245
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:04,685
Speaker 6:  video of the replay and say, make this slower. And they're gonna post that

1246
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:07,725
Speaker 6:  to wherever and argue about a bunch of fake images.

1247
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:08,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But

1248
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:09,605
Speaker 6:  Aren't they literally fake images

1249
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:13,325
Speaker 7:  Also? But there's gonna be a ref who's gonna have a very fancy camera

1250
01:10:13,945 --> 01:10:14,485
Speaker 7:  who would be like,

1251
01:10:14,785 --> 01:10:16,165
Speaker 6:  That's wrong there. Those refs

1252
01:10:16,165 --> 01:10:17,765
Speaker 7:  Are not too trust. Do I trust refs too much?

1253
01:10:17,835 --> 01:10:20,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's like just one example. I'll just, it's the lowest stakes example.

1254
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:24,965
Speaker 6:  Although given the prevalence of sports betting also a very high stakes

1255
01:10:24,965 --> 01:10:28,805
Speaker 6:  example. Right now America, that's just one thing. It's an election

1256
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:32,685
Speaker 6:  year, right? What if don don't know, Trump stumbles over some stairs or Biden

1257
01:10:32,685 --> 01:10:36,245
Speaker 6:  stumbles over some stairs or appears to stumble over some stairs and a bunch

1258
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:40,085
Speaker 6:  of people on either side want to take video of that and then create a bunch

1259
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:43,965
Speaker 6:  of fake frames. Or it looks like they stumbled more than they did, or they

1260
01:10:43,995 --> 01:10:47,685
Speaker 6:  slow it down. And as we know, things in slow motion appear way more dramatic

1261
01:10:47,685 --> 01:10:50,845
Speaker 6:  than real time. And you send that out and now you have a slow motion video.

1262
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:55,195
Speaker 6:  Many of the frames of which never happened. Like

1263
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:59,275
Speaker 6:  that is the apocalypse. 'cause people are inclined to trust

1264
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:03,235
Speaker 6:  slow motion video to say what really happened. And here

1265
01:11:03,235 --> 01:11:06,875
Speaker 6:  there's nothing, there's no, all the stuff we've heard about content, authenticity,

1266
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:10,755
Speaker 6:  all the whatever, Samsung's like, whatever, you can just do it.

1267
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:14,525
Speaker 6:  No watermarks, no cryptographic signature, none of this other stuff. Like

1268
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:18,365
Speaker 6:  it's just, here's some AI stuff and it just had like heatless

1269
01:11:18,985 --> 01:11:22,165
Speaker 6:  and what I keep saying, the what, what is a photo apocalypses here? It's

1270
01:11:22,165 --> 01:11:26,125
Speaker 6:  like, oh, it's this stuff. Yeah. Where actually the end state is no

1271
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:29,725
Speaker 6:  one trusts any media because they all know how easy it is to generate anything.

1272
01:11:30,065 --> 01:11:33,205
Speaker 6:  And then now you're, that's a really weird place to end up.

1273
01:11:33,295 --> 01:11:36,285
Speaker 8:  We're getting there really fast. I see. I think too, I've, I've, I've just

1274
01:11:36,285 --> 01:11:39,445
Speaker 8:  consistently been amazed by how quickly just in my own life

1275
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:44,285
Speaker 8:  people are adopting that sort of reflexive skepticism of like, oh, this

1276
01:11:44,285 --> 01:11:48,165
Speaker 8:  is a picture. It's probably fake. It's like the burden of proof is now

1277
01:11:48,165 --> 01:11:51,965
Speaker 8:  like proof that it's real, not proof that it's fake. It's very strange.

1278
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:55,325
Speaker 6:  Right. This is a deep fake. Yeah. This is just a, people argue all the time,

1279
01:11:55,425 --> 01:11:58,005
Speaker 7:  It feels bad, but also at the same time, if it means we never have to see

1280
01:11:58,005 --> 01:12:01,965
Speaker 7:  the shark swimming in the highway water ever again. Like, oh,

1281
01:12:01,965 --> 01:12:04,725
Speaker 6:  You will. Oh yeah. It's not that people aren't just gonna hit like on social

1282
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:08,645
Speaker 6:  media or there won't be grifters. Like Yeah. If we could get to a place

1283
01:12:08,645 --> 01:12:12,605
Speaker 6:  of pure skepticism where that stuff faded fine, but this

1284
01:12:12,605 --> 01:12:16,525
Speaker 6:  stuff is already out there. I'll give you an example. In during the

1285
01:12:16,525 --> 01:12:19,725
Speaker 6:  Kyle Rittenhouse trial, which was in Wisconsin, So I paid attention to it.

1286
01:12:20,595 --> 01:12:24,125
Speaker 6:  Kyle Rittenhouse, his lawyers argued that some of the photographic evidence

1287
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:28,045
Speaker 6:  could not be used because the iPhone

1288
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:32,165
Speaker 6:  has AI in it. Right. We co I think we covered this on the show and they,

1289
01:12:32,165 --> 01:12:36,085
Speaker 6:  they won like the, you know, the, the local prosecutors in Kenosha, Wisconsin

1290
01:12:36,115 --> 01:12:39,725
Speaker 6:  were not ready for that argument. Surprise, surprise. And they were just

1291
01:12:39,725 --> 01:12:41,685
Speaker 6:  like, yeah, we're gonna exclude this evidence because we're not ready to

1292
01:12:41,685 --> 01:12:44,925
Speaker 6:  have a bunch of experts come in here and say, what is a photo? That's years

1293
01:12:45,025 --> 01:12:48,365
Speaker 6:  ago, this happened years ago, and now we have

1294
01:12:48,595 --> 01:12:52,045
Speaker 6:  Samsung phones that can take any video and

1295
01:12:52,045 --> 01:12:55,895
Speaker 6:  interpolate frames that never happened. What are you

1296
01:12:55,895 --> 01:12:58,775
Speaker 6:  gonna do when that stuff hits a courtroom? What are you gonna do when that

1297
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:02,535
Speaker 6:  stuff, when there, when there is like dramatic amounts of money

1298
01:13:02,835 --> 01:13:06,535
Speaker 6:  in sports books on the line and you want to claim that the refs are

1299
01:13:06,655 --> 01:13:10,455
Speaker 6:  rigged. Like there, there's no responsibility here. Like

1300
01:13:10,455 --> 01:13:13,615
Speaker 6:  we are just past the point of no return with what is a photo. Because the

1301
01:13:13,615 --> 01:13:17,015
Speaker 6:  answer for a Samsung video is like, these are not, these are not videos that

1302
01:13:17,015 --> 01:13:17,375
Speaker 6:  you can trust.

1303
01:13:17,865 --> 01:13:20,775
Speaker 8:  Right? No, no. I I think you're right. And I, I do think we're pretty clearly

1304
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:23,935
Speaker 8:  past the point of no return on this. And I think we

1305
01:13:25,085 --> 01:13:28,815
Speaker 8:  have to figure out what the next thing is, right? Whether it's a watermark,

1306
01:13:28,815 --> 01:13:31,895
Speaker 8:  whether it's the cryptographic stuff you're talking about, like we've been

1307
01:13:32,015 --> 01:13:35,095
Speaker 8:  threatening to do the metadata episode for forever and like that's the thing

1308
01:13:35,165 --> 01:13:38,935
Speaker 8:  because it, it we're, we're long past the

1309
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:41,495
Speaker 8:  thing where you can

1310
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:45,455
Speaker 8:  straightforwardly trust every single thing that you capture just because

1311
01:13:45,485 --> 01:13:48,695
Speaker 8:  it's light projecting onto sensors. Right. Like, we've been past that for

1312
01:13:48,695 --> 01:13:52,455
Speaker 8:  a long time. And I think I I, this strikes me as

1313
01:13:53,535 --> 01:13:56,495
Speaker 8:  I, like I take your point about the football example, which I actually think

1314
01:13:56,495 --> 01:13:59,295
Speaker 8:  is a really good one. Like a ball is moving unpredictably,

1315
01:14:00,165 --> 01:14:04,135
Speaker 8:  literally the camera is going to guess where it went and it's gonna get

1316
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:07,975
Speaker 8:  it wrong sometimes. And that's bananas. But I

1317
01:14:07,975 --> 01:14:11,605
Speaker 8:  don't know, this doesn't strike me as like an entirely new field of

1318
01:14:12,495 --> 01:14:14,485
Speaker 8:  scary stuff in this way.

1319
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:18,445
Speaker 7:  I kind of agree with NELI in that it does feel like the, the,

1320
01:14:19,145 --> 01:14:22,965
Speaker 7:  the bar has been raised on like this or lowered the bar

1321
01:14:22,965 --> 01:14:26,725
Speaker 7:  has moved significantly in one direction or another, depending on,

1322
01:14:26,785 --> 01:14:30,765
Speaker 7:  on your point of view in that it's a, it's now so, so much easier

1323
01:14:30,945 --> 01:14:34,685
Speaker 7:  to make fake stuff with your phone. Like, like this phone, the S

1324
01:14:34,685 --> 01:14:38,645
Speaker 7:  24 Sure. Has put Photoshop in your pocket in a way that wasn't there

1325
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:42,165
Speaker 7:  before. And Photoshop has often been like that. That's been a massive tool

1326
01:14:42,165 --> 01:14:46,005
Speaker 7:  for misinformation since, since it's inception. And, and now

1327
01:14:46,475 --> 01:14:49,445
Speaker 7:  anybody can go and they can circle something and get rid of it or they can

1328
01:14:49,445 --> 01:14:53,245
Speaker 7:  film something and have a computer decide which way the ball goes.

1329
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:57,525
Speaker 7:  And that just wasn't possible before this. So it's like

1330
01:14:57,525 --> 01:15:01,285
Speaker 7:  really cool stuff. I'm really excited about it from like a personal

1331
01:15:01,285 --> 01:15:04,965
Speaker 7:  perspective as someone who likes to make stupid things horrified

1332
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:07,205
Speaker 7:  for it on like a societal

1333
01:15:07,805 --> 01:15:10,395
Speaker 8:  Level. Yeah. I also think one of the, one of the debates we had around the

1334
01:15:10,395 --> 01:15:14,355
Speaker 8:  Pixel was there where the sort of ease threshold is. Yeah. 'cause I think,

1335
01:15:14,495 --> 01:15:16,915
Speaker 8:  and this is where the Photoshop thing comes in, right? Just because you can

1336
01:15:16,915 --> 01:15:20,755
Speaker 8:  do complicated things in Photoshop, it changes it when it

1337
01:15:20,755 --> 01:15:23,595
Speaker 8:  is just a button you can press in the camera app on your phone. I think we

1338
01:15:23,595 --> 01:15:27,395
Speaker 8:  all agree on that. Yeah. And the thing about this one is it's, it's gonna

1339
01:15:27,395 --> 01:15:30,835
Speaker 8:  be just complicated enough to do what you're describing NELI. That I think

1340
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,635
Speaker 8:  that might be the reason it bothers me less is like, not only do you have

1341
01:15:33,635 --> 01:15:37,555
Speaker 8:  to shoot this video, you're gonna then have to run it through

1342
01:15:37,555 --> 01:15:41,195
Speaker 8:  this process to get you the 120 frames per second thing. You're gonna have

1343
01:15:41,195 --> 01:15:44,435
Speaker 8:  to find a frame that looks good that was generated, which it usually won't.

1344
01:15:44,515 --> 01:15:47,475
Speaker 8:  'cause if you shoot something at 120 fan for a second, each individual frame

1345
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:51,395
Speaker 8:  usually kind of looks like shit. And then you're gonna have to take that

1346
01:15:51,395 --> 01:15:55,355
Speaker 8:  thing, isolate it out, and then go do something with it. And that, that to

1347
01:15:55,355 --> 01:15:58,955
Speaker 8:  me is like more steps than the pick somebody up off a bench and move them

1348
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:02,865
Speaker 8:  over there. That that second thing actually alarms me

1349
01:16:02,865 --> 01:16:06,665
Speaker 8:  more just because it is so simple and straightforward to do that people

1350
01:16:06,815 --> 01:16:08,625
Speaker 8:  will do it and a lot.

1351
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:12,105
Speaker 7:  But that's spoken from someone who probably doesn't have like a thousand

1352
01:16:12,105 --> 01:16:14,225
Speaker 7:  dollars writing on the next Green Bay Packers game.

1353
01:16:14,825 --> 01:16:18,585
Speaker 6:  I don't, I don't gamble. I spend all my money on, on limousines. You know,

1354
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:18,785
Speaker 6:  there's

1355
01:16:18,785 --> 01:16:19,665
Speaker 7:  People out there is

1356
01:16:19,665 --> 01:16:20,425
Speaker 6:  Much better use of money

1357
01:16:20,965 --> 01:16:24,865
Speaker 7:  Who Who knows who those folks are. But, but there is like, like I think the

1358
01:16:24,865 --> 01:16:27,705
Speaker 7:  incentives are low enough probably gonna be a low enough for a lot of folk

1359
01:16:27,805 --> 01:16:31,465
Speaker 7:  or high enough for a lot of folks that that little extra effort isn't gonna

1360
01:16:31,465 --> 01:16:35,145
Speaker 7:  be as big an impact for them. And we're seeing the same thing with DeepFakes,

1361
01:16:35,145 --> 01:16:38,345
Speaker 7:  right? Like DeepFakes were something that we kind of could be like whatever.

1362
01:16:38,935 --> 01:16:42,825
Speaker 7:  It's it's, it's hard to do and it's gotten so much easier to do a

1363
01:16:42,825 --> 01:16:46,385
Speaker 7:  deep fake now Oh yeah. To do a really good one. That, that that misinformation

1364
01:16:46,385 --> 01:16:49,905
Speaker 7:  potential has really skyrocketed. And it feels like the S 24

1365
01:16:50,485 --> 01:16:54,345
Speaker 7:  brings us to that place in a beautiful package brought to you by

1366
01:16:54,345 --> 01:16:56,745
Speaker 7:  Samsung. That was my Tim Cook impression.

1367
01:16:57,605 --> 01:16:59,945
Speaker 8:  That's good. That's gonna work. Yeah. Samsung, I think you have to hit song

1368
01:16:59,945 --> 01:17:00,585
Speaker 8:  harder. Samsung.

1369
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:02,105
Speaker 7:  Sorry, Samsung I listen. It's like people

1370
01:17:02,205 --> 01:17:02,985
Speaker 8:  Who say say tv,

1371
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,425
Speaker 6:  I'm just telling you go listen to it.

1372
01:17:07,075 --> 01:17:10,845
Speaker 6:  Other little bits and bobs, AI wise of the S 24 line,

1373
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:14,205
Speaker 6:  Google is bringing a bunch of Gemini model stuff to it. You can have circle

1374
01:17:14,205 --> 01:17:18,165
Speaker 6:  stuff to search on the phone, which is finally,

1375
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:19,965
Speaker 6:  finally used for circling.

1376
01:17:20,605 --> 01:17:24,495
Speaker 7:  I love that It called Allison out. Like she tried to get,

1377
01:17:24,495 --> 01:17:28,095
Speaker 7:  she tried to like cheat it. She's like, aha, try a picture of like

1378
01:17:28,365 --> 01:17:31,335
Speaker 7:  this fake plant. You're gonna tell me it's real. And it's like, that's a

1379
01:17:31,335 --> 01:17:33,775
Speaker 7:  fake plant. It costs $9. And she's like, rude

1380
01:17:34,285 --> 01:17:37,935
Speaker 8:  Dude. Google lens is really good. Yeah. Like it's, it's a remarkable

1381
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:42,215
Speaker 8:  part of Google search that I feel like doesn't get talked about as, as an

1382
01:17:42,315 --> 01:17:45,575
Speaker 8:  AI product in the way that it should. It's really good now. And they now

1383
01:17:45,575 --> 01:17:49,455
Speaker 8:  have the multi search stuff where you can take a picture and then ask a question

1384
01:17:49,505 --> 01:17:53,175
Speaker 8:  about that picture and it'll like the, the example they gave is like, you

1385
01:17:53,175 --> 01:17:55,855
Speaker 8:  take a picture of a backgammon board and say, how do I play this game? And

1386
01:17:55,855 --> 01:17:58,375
Speaker 8:  it'll figure out that it's backgammon and then use Gemini to tell you how

1387
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:00,335
Speaker 8:  to play backgammon. That stuff is cool.

1388
01:18:00,645 --> 01:18:00,935
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1389
01:18:01,435 --> 01:18:04,695
Speaker 8:  And that's real like future of search stuff. And that's where all, so the

1390
01:18:04,815 --> 01:18:08,175
Speaker 8:  circle search comes in, you're like, oh, I see this bag in a video that seems

1391
01:18:08,175 --> 01:18:11,775
Speaker 8:  cool. Circle the bag, send it to Google, buy the bag. What's

1392
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:15,695
Speaker 6:  Interesting to me, all the generative AI stuff here is either image

1393
01:18:15,695 --> 01:18:19,455
Speaker 6:  editing, which comes with its own obvious philosophical dilemmas or

1394
01:18:19,455 --> 01:18:19,775
Speaker 6:  it's like

1395
01:18:21,325 --> 01:18:24,935
Speaker 6:  sort of LLM stuff, right? Like search for something. It'll talk to you about

1396
01:18:24,935 --> 01:18:28,535
Speaker 6:  it. You can, there's Magic compose and all this stuff in here. The middle

1397
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:32,135
Speaker 6:  piece that Samsung was kind of reaching for with Bixby

1398
01:18:32,675 --> 01:18:36,415
Speaker 6:  is not here. Right. Which is what we saw with the rabbit R one at

1399
01:18:36,475 --> 01:18:38,855
Speaker 6:  css where it's like you tell your phone to do something and it just like

1400
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:41,985
Speaker 6:  does it, and if you will recall

1401
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:45,905
Speaker 6:  Samsung's attempted differentiation with Bixby, its voice

1402
01:18:45,905 --> 01:18:49,585
Speaker 6:  assistant whose name sounded like a dog wearing shoes was that you would

1403
01:18:49,585 --> 01:18:52,585
Speaker 6:  be like, set some settings and Bixby would go like set some settings for

1404
01:18:52,585 --> 01:18:56,425
Speaker 6:  you in a way that Siri and Google Assistant kind of can't. And it's, it's

1405
01:18:57,025 --> 01:18:59,745
Speaker 6:  striking to me they have not closed this loop on that phone. 'cause that's

1406
01:18:59,745 --> 01:19:01,105
Speaker 6:  what you would expect because

1407
01:19:01,105 --> 01:19:04,065
Speaker 7:  We saw it wasn't just Rabbit. We saw this with like, a lot of the TV companies

1408
01:19:04,065 --> 01:19:07,585
Speaker 7:  were like, we've got AI in our tv. Oh really? What does it do? It makes your,

1409
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:11,625
Speaker 7:  your picture prettier. Right. Figures figures it out. And so you'd think

1410
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:14,625
Speaker 7:  Samsung would do this. And I I I'm kind of like, is there, is there something

1411
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:17,185
Speaker 7:  happening with Google and the relationship with Google that's like kind of

1412
01:19:17,945 --> 01:19:21,305
Speaker 7:  restricting that? Or is it just they haven't gotten there yet?

1413
01:19:22,515 --> 01:19:26,315
Speaker 8:  I think it's just harder work than people reckoned with. Like the, the idea

1414
01:19:26,505 --> 01:19:28,515
Speaker 8:  that I could tell my phone to

1415
01:19:30,155 --> 01:19:33,995
Speaker 8:  whatever turn on Bluetooth doesn't seem that hard. but it is

1416
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:37,915
Speaker 8:  actually, it's, it's a Leap beyond just understanding what Bluetooth is,

1417
01:19:37,915 --> 01:19:41,795
Speaker 8:  right? You have to have a different kind of access to my system and a different

1418
01:19:41,795 --> 01:19:45,155
Speaker 8:  kind of access to the tools and the stuff that I actually wanna do.

1419
01:19:45,695 --> 01:19:49,235
Speaker 8:  And this was the problem with a lot of these things that, that have come

1420
01:19:49,235 --> 01:19:52,115
Speaker 8:  out first, the tech sucked, but Right. Like they had it built in the right

1421
01:19:52,115 --> 01:19:55,675
Speaker 8:  direction, but it wasn't very good. And now we have LLMs, which are much

1422
01:19:55,675 --> 01:19:59,395
Speaker 8:  better at understanding what you mean, but are

1423
01:19:59,455 --> 01:20:03,315
Speaker 8:  not connected to the metal in the same way. And I think the, the

1424
01:20:03,315 --> 01:20:05,635
Speaker 8:  next phase of this is to put those two things together, right? Like yeah,

1425
01:20:05,775 --> 01:20:08,900
Speaker 8:  Google has made a lot of noise, noise about Gemini being built into Android

1426
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,765
Speaker 8:  more and more over time. And I'm, I'm sure that's coming. But right now

1427
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:16,525
Speaker 8:  Gemini is like built into Google photos more than it is built into

1428
01:20:16,525 --> 01:20:20,485
Speaker 8:  Android. And so the next phase of that is to just pull it down a level in

1429
01:20:20,485 --> 01:20:24,325
Speaker 8:  the stack. But that's just, it's harder work than it seems like it ought

1430
01:20:24,325 --> 01:20:27,285
Speaker 8:  to be. but it is sort of surprising that no one has really gotten there yet.

1431
01:20:27,555 --> 01:20:29,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I just haven't closed the loop. It's like, I need, I want you to

1432
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:32,765
Speaker 6:  play this song and it's gonna like click around in Spotify for you. Yeah.

1433
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:36,485
Speaker 6:  This is the device where that actually makes sense. The rabbit I think captured

1434
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,805
Speaker 6:  a lot of imagination, but that's still what it is doing.

1435
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:39,885
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And So

1436
01:20:40,365 --> 01:20:40,925
Speaker 7:  I got a clicky wheel,

1437
01:20:41,015 --> 01:20:44,725
Speaker 6:  Right? What if I just still had my big screen in great camera and it could

1438
01:20:44,725 --> 01:20:48,165
Speaker 6:  still do that for me? Yeah. I'm eager to see that we're closed. Okay. We

1439
01:20:48,165 --> 01:20:52,125
Speaker 6:  should take a break. We are just way over. We just, it's

1440
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:54,885
Speaker 6:  just ridiculous. Show this week we're gonna take a break. We're gonna come

1441
01:20:54,885 --> 01:20:58,005
Speaker 6:  back with the lightning round and then we're gonna go for another, another

1442
01:20:58,005 --> 01:20:59,245
Speaker 6:  hour or so. We'll be, actually be great.

1443
01:20:59,825 --> 01:21:00,045
Speaker 8:  We

1444
01:21:03,745 --> 01:21:07,205
Speaker 6:  All right. We're back. It's time for a lightning round. I'll tell you

1445
01:21:07,645 --> 01:21:11,605
Speaker 6:  sme, the obscure refrigerator company that Cranz called out last week

1446
01:21:12,505 --> 01:21:16,125
Speaker 6:  did not sponsor us this week. So now upsetting. We're just gonna name some

1447
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:16,965
Speaker 6:  other companies as we go.

1448
01:21:17,945 --> 01:21:21,645
Speaker 7:  I'm going all in on Iowa, which was like a stereo company.

1449
01:21:21,865 --> 01:21:24,245
Speaker 7:  Oh, I like that. I didn't know they were around anymore.

1450
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:27,805
Speaker 6:  That was, that's the Sony Subbrand. Yeah, they did. They get spun off.

1451
01:21:28,525 --> 01:21:31,125
Speaker 7:  I don't know if they spun off, but they were, they had a big presence at

1452
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:34,765
Speaker 7:  CES and Liam and I both were like, they're still around. That was my first

1453
01:21:34,785 --> 01:21:38,165
Speaker 7:  stereo. It was a big moment for us. Call

1454
01:21:38,355 --> 01:21:41,805
Speaker 6:  Sony. Well I've now clicked on a button labeled Iowa Legacy.

1455
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:46,765
Speaker 6:  Oh, they spun off from Sony. Literally when you click on Iowa Legacy

1456
01:21:46,825 --> 01:21:49,805
Speaker 6:  it says our company has no association with Sony Corporation.

1457
01:21:51,195 --> 01:21:55,045
Speaker 7:  Well that, so so you guys like, come on, get your name out there.

1458
01:21:55,305 --> 01:21:56,245
Speaker 7:  Hit us up. Yeah.

1459
01:21:56,245 --> 01:22:00,165
Speaker 6:  Lightning round. Sponsored by Could be you Iowa, very

1460
01:22:00,365 --> 01:22:03,125
Speaker 6:  precious about, you know, disclosures and all that sort of thing. This I

1461
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:03,405
Speaker 6:  will sell

1462
01:22:03,405 --> 01:22:04,085
Speaker 8:  Except in the lightning

1463
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:07,045
Speaker 6:  Round. Except in the lightning round. We will sell it to anyone first come,

1464
01:22:07,045 --> 01:22:09,325
Speaker 6:  first served. All right, Cranz, what's your lightning round?

1465
01:22:10,265 --> 01:22:14,085
Speaker 7:  So CNN is had a major restructuring this week and normally

1466
01:22:14,395 --> 01:22:17,765
Speaker 7:  that doesn't feel like a Vergecast thing, but a lot of this, this

1467
01:22:18,005 --> 01:22:21,845
Speaker 7:  restructuring was because they realized people use their phones a lot and

1468
01:22:21,845 --> 01:22:25,765
Speaker 7:  they're not watching cable TV as much and that's a virgie thing. So

1469
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:29,725
Speaker 7:  they are combining all the different news apparatuses or news

1470
01:22:29,775 --> 01:22:33,445
Speaker 7:  operations. So that means their digital operation, their TV

1471
01:22:33,475 --> 01:22:37,165
Speaker 7:  operation and their so, or their streaming operation are all gonna be

1472
01:22:37,365 --> 01:22:41,285
Speaker 7:  combined into one big mega operation. And then they're gonna have a spinoff

1473
01:22:41,285 --> 01:22:45,245
Speaker 7:  of like, what are the other places we can advance ourselves? And also

1474
01:22:45,245 --> 01:22:48,405
Speaker 7:  we gotta figure out the phone. That seems really important.

1475
01:22:48,945 --> 01:22:52,325
Speaker 6:  You should put CNN on phones. It's pretty good. It's

1476
01:22:52,325 --> 01:22:55,165
Speaker 8:  Just bundling and unbundling ma Yeah. Bundling. Bundling. Giving a few years

1477
01:22:55,165 --> 01:22:58,125
Speaker 8:  in every newsroom is gonna start to be like, we need specific teams for each

1478
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:01,725
Speaker 8:  of these. What's our Vision Pro strategy? Like that's, we're it's, we're

1479
01:23:01,725 --> 01:23:04,365
Speaker 8:  headed back down that road before too long. I'm I'm sure of it.

1480
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:08,485
Speaker 6:  So there, there's some context here. One reason that CNN is always a ver

1481
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:12,405
Speaker 6:  story is that the modern CNN is owned by Warner Brothers Discovery, a company

1482
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:16,165
Speaker 6:  that came into existence from the merger of Warner Brothers in Discovery,

1483
01:23:16,565 --> 01:23:19,725
Speaker 6:  surprise Warner Brothers sold to Discovery by at and

1484
01:23:19,845 --> 01:23:23,565
Speaker 6:  TA company that used to own CNN

1485
01:23:24,395 --> 01:23:25,085
Speaker 6:  That was cool.

1486
01:23:25,395 --> 01:23:26,965
Speaker 7:  They could have had it on the phones.

1487
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:31,245
Speaker 6:  They could at and t bought all of Warner Brothers in a Pitch

1488
01:23:31,355 --> 01:23:35,205
Speaker 6:  that they described as quote a vision deal. And the vision was

1489
01:23:35,205 --> 01:23:39,045
Speaker 6:  that they would preload garbage Warner Brothers apps into mid range

1490
01:23:39,045 --> 01:23:42,845
Speaker 6:  Android phones in at and t stores. This is true. I'm not making

1491
01:23:42,845 --> 01:23:46,765
Speaker 6:  this up. Yeah. Anyway, they sold it to, they sold, they

1492
01:23:46,865 --> 01:23:50,445
Speaker 6:  got conned into making a grayscale four three Justice League by Zach

1493
01:23:50,605 --> 01:23:54,485
Speaker 6:  Snyder. They, they sold the whole kitten caboodle to, to discovery.

1494
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:58,855
Speaker 6:  Who installed this guy, Chris Licked, who was supposed

1495
01:23:58,855 --> 01:24:02,775
Speaker 6:  to revitalize CNNI would say that was a disaster. But now they

1496
01:24:02,775 --> 01:24:06,375
Speaker 6:  have a new guy, Mark Thompson, who used to be the CEO of the New York Times.

1497
01:24:06,395 --> 01:24:09,615
Speaker 6:  He led the big digital transformation there. He hired another executive from

1498
01:24:09,615 --> 01:24:13,215
Speaker 6:  The Times and they're going to, now they're going figure out phones.

1499
01:24:13,485 --> 01:24:17,255
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's, it's not like super encouraging that in his memo

1500
01:24:17,255 --> 01:24:20,815
Speaker 7:  announcing this big restructuring and, and their, their need to focus on

1501
01:24:20,815 --> 01:24:24,535
Speaker 7:  phones was, he said, I don't think anyone's yet cracked the code on how that

1502
01:24:24,535 --> 01:24:28,135
Speaker 7:  translates truly translates to a new, to a great news

1503
01:24:28,135 --> 01:24:32,095
Speaker 7:  experience. That's not kind of what you wanna hear from the guy who's like,

1504
01:24:32,095 --> 01:24:35,815
Speaker 7:  we're gonna fix things with phones. But he, he seems to also recognize that

1505
01:24:35,815 --> 01:24:39,645
Speaker 7:  he hasn't figured it out yet and he's working on it. So Don

1506
01:24:39,645 --> 01:24:42,645
Speaker 7:  don't know. I like the honesty. I appreciate the honesty personally.

1507
01:24:44,185 --> 01:24:47,965
Speaker 7:  So I, I'm excited. Like given what he did with the New York Times app,

1508
01:24:47,965 --> 01:24:50,965
Speaker 7:  that's, that's honestly one of my favorite apps that I use on my phone pretty

1509
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:54,845
Speaker 7:  much daily. I I'm, I'm willing to, to see what happens. I'm,

1510
01:24:54,865 --> 01:24:55,285
Speaker 7:  I'm curious.

1511
01:24:57,135 --> 01:25:00,495
Speaker 8:  C CNN is weird because CNN is on one hand

1512
01:25:01,275 --> 01:25:05,215
Speaker 8:  wildly successful digitally like cnn.com. However big you

1513
01:25:05,215 --> 01:25:08,695
Speaker 8:  think it is, it's much bigger than that. Yeah. cnn.com is huge.

1514
01:25:09,235 --> 01:25:13,135
Speaker 8:  Yep. but it doesn't feel sort of crucial

1515
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:16,455
Speaker 8:  in the way that some other news sources feel crucial. Like the New York Times

1516
01:25:16,455 --> 01:25:20,095
Speaker 8:  has done a really good job of making itself like central to the universe.

1517
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:21,855
Speaker 8:  And I think if I'm Mark Thompson, that's probably

1518
01:25:21,855 --> 01:25:25,415
Speaker 6:  What's Wait what's that? They, they don't need to know that you feel that

1519
01:25:25,415 --> 01:25:29,135
Speaker 6:  way. Alright. They're fine, they're doing fine. Their own people do the

1520
01:25:29,135 --> 01:25:30,095
Speaker 6:  crossword every day their own.

1521
01:25:31,755 --> 01:25:35,215
Speaker 8:  But, and I think the idea that they feel like no one has cracked

1522
01:25:35,355 --> 01:25:37,895
Speaker 8:  mobile devices is really interesting. 'cause I also kind of feel like that's

1523
01:25:37,895 --> 01:25:41,735
Speaker 8:  true. Everybody just built apps and you can have good apps and push notifications

1524
01:25:41,735 --> 01:25:45,575
Speaker 8:  are the best thing anybody has found to get people in. But like I now

1525
01:25:45,575 --> 01:25:48,615
Speaker 8:  get a push notification from the New York Times every time anyone on Earth

1526
01:25:48,805 --> 01:25:52,735
Speaker 8:  dies it feels like. Yeah. And the, we're just in this weird place

1527
01:25:52,735 --> 01:25:56,415
Speaker 8:  of like, what is the push, what is the pull, what is the experience supposed

1528
01:25:56,415 --> 01:25:59,655
Speaker 8:  to look like? Is it just a list of articles whenever I open the app, like

1529
01:26:00,095 --> 01:26:04,085
Speaker 8:  I think it's cool that they're coming at this from the idea that no

1530
01:26:04,085 --> 01:26:07,845
Speaker 8:  one has solved this and the answer is not just like send more push notifications

1531
01:26:07,845 --> 01:26:10,565
Speaker 8:  so people open our app more often. don don't know what the answer is either.

1532
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:11,565
Speaker 8:  But I think it'll be fun to watch.

1533
01:26:11,965 --> 01:26:15,445
Speaker 7:  I mean if they improve on what AP News does where it te sends you a push

1534
01:26:15,445 --> 01:26:17,565
Speaker 7:  notification and then you click on it and then they're like, we don't have

1535
01:26:17,565 --> 01:26:20,845
Speaker 7:  a story up yet. Here's our front page. Oh perfect. My favorite

1536
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:24,725
Speaker 7:  experience with a push notification for news, I'll be happy. Like

1537
01:26:24,865 --> 01:26:28,725
Speaker 7:  the bar is kind of low. I I think if they put a some

1538
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:29,925
Speaker 7:  thought into it and do something cool.

1539
01:26:30,275 --> 01:26:33,445
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And especially CNN has gone through this weird thing where there was

1540
01:26:34,025 --> 01:26:37,165
Speaker 8:  CNN plus where they were gonna do a whole streaming service that died immediately

1541
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:41,125
Speaker 8:  when the Warner Brothers Discovery thing happened. What was it? Was it

1542
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:42,125
Speaker 8:  around for like a

1543
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:44,405
Speaker 7:  Couple of weeks? It was around for a week, right? It was a week. Okay. It

1544
01:26:44,405 --> 01:26:47,565
Speaker 7:  was like a week and then it got Zv was like this is stupid and got rid of

1545
01:26:47,565 --> 01:26:51,405
Speaker 7:  it. And then now there's CNN max, which is on max

1546
01:26:51,465 --> 01:26:55,205
Speaker 7:  the streaming channel and it has all the things that, whereas

1547
01:26:55,405 --> 01:26:59,165
Speaker 7:  CNN plus was like, we think you'll really like the CNN brand and we're not

1548
01:26:59,165 --> 01:27:00,285
Speaker 7:  gonna carry anything over from

1549
01:27:00,285 --> 01:27:03,405
Speaker 8:  The channel. Jake Tapper had a book club on CNN Plus like Sure. Right. I

1550
01:27:03,405 --> 01:27:05,405
Speaker 8:  don't think that was gonna work, but I wish we had gotten to see a little

1551
01:27:05,405 --> 01:27:06,485
Speaker 8:  bit more of it Play out.

1552
01:27:06,485 --> 01:27:09,685
Speaker 7:  Yes. CNN max is like, we're just gonna put like CNN

1553
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:14,325
Speaker 7:  on your TV and I appreciate that as someone who cuts the

1554
01:27:14,575 --> 01:27:14,925
Speaker 7:  cords

1555
01:27:15,395 --> 01:27:18,765
Speaker 8:  Good. But I think the idea of like, we're just gonna stream a cable channel

1556
01:27:18,785 --> 01:27:22,445
Speaker 8:  to your phone and that'll do it is also not the answer. Right. And I think

1557
01:27:22,735 --> 01:27:26,485
Speaker 8:  every content company is going to have to come up with some version of that

1558
01:27:26,485 --> 01:27:29,885
Speaker 8:  answer and they're having to do it very quickly. So I, think it's TikTok,

1559
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:33,885
Speaker 8:  CNN coming at this from like, we are a gigantic digital presence. How do

1560
01:27:33,885 --> 01:27:37,605
Speaker 8:  we turn that into TV money? It's gonna be really interesting

1561
01:27:37,825 --> 01:27:39,085
Speaker 8:  and I have no idea what it looks like.

1562
01:27:39,675 --> 01:27:40,205
Speaker 7:  Same. Yeah.

1563
01:27:40,675 --> 01:27:42,845
Speaker 6:  Alright. David, what's your lightning round?

1564
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:47,485
Speaker 8:  Mine is, so Apple and Epic have been fighting for a

1565
01:27:47,485 --> 01:27:50,645
Speaker 8:  very long time. The Supreme Court just declined to hear it. I promise we're

1566
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:53,405
Speaker 8:  not gonna talk about this for a long time. So basically what happened is

1567
01:27:53,405 --> 01:27:56,845
Speaker 8:  that, that for all intents and purposes is now over

1568
01:27:57,815 --> 01:28:01,725
Speaker 8:  Apple has to allow developers to link to other places

1569
01:28:01,725 --> 01:28:05,365
Speaker 8:  that people can pay for apps. But what Apple did is put in rules

1570
01:28:05,435 --> 01:28:08,965
Speaker 8:  that say, even if you do that, we're now going to collect 27%

1571
01:28:09,225 --> 01:28:12,205
Speaker 8:  of what people buy when they click on the link and go pay you somewhere else

1572
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:16,605
Speaker 8:  instead of 30%. And so all the people who are mad about Apple's 30%

1573
01:28:16,665 --> 01:28:20,645
Speaker 8:  tax are now predictably just as mad about Apple's 27% tax

1574
01:28:21,355 --> 01:28:25,005
Speaker 8:  when you pay for something else. And it's gone into this fascinating place

1575
01:28:25,005 --> 01:28:28,845
Speaker 8:  where it's like App Apple has always said, we don't think this is just

1576
01:28:28,885 --> 01:28:32,805
Speaker 8:  a payment processing thing. We think you're paying us 30% for all of the

1577
01:28:32,805 --> 01:28:36,285
Speaker 8:  other things that we provide and all the other people who make these apps.

1578
01:28:36,665 --> 01:28:36,885
Speaker 8:  At

1579
01:28:36,885 --> 01:28:39,845
Speaker 6:  This point it's you're paying, you're paying the money for the right to have

1580
01:28:39,845 --> 01:28:40,845
Speaker 6:  an application on their phone.

1581
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:44,005
Speaker 8:  Yeah, no, that, that's, that's basically Right. And Apple would not say it

1582
01:28:44,005 --> 01:28:46,845
Speaker 8:  quite like that, but that's basically the argument. It's

1583
01:28:46,845 --> 01:28:49,365
Speaker 6:  Our phone. They, they feel very strongly it's their phone. But

1584
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:52,965
Speaker 8:  All these companies from Epic to Spotify to, you know, everybody else in

1585
01:28:52,965 --> 01:28:56,525
Speaker 8:  this coalition for app fairness, match.com and all these other folks, they

1586
01:28:56,525 --> 01:29:00,445
Speaker 8:  are equally pissed. And so we're just gonna have this same fight

1587
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:04,445
Speaker 8:  again with slightly different rules, which is now, instead of paying

1588
01:29:04,545 --> 01:29:08,485
Speaker 8:  in an app and giving Apple 30%, you pay on the web in

1589
01:29:08,485 --> 01:29:11,925
Speaker 8:  an app and you pay 27% and that

1590
01:29:12,425 --> 01:29:16,285
Speaker 8:  is just, it's just going to start this whole fight all over again. And I

1591
01:29:16,285 --> 01:29:17,525
Speaker 8:  think it's fascinating. Oh

1592
01:29:17,525 --> 01:29:20,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So Epic is going just to walk through the procedural

1593
01:29:21,515 --> 01:29:25,325
Speaker 6:  nightmare here. Yeah. There was the trial which we covered, apple

1594
01:29:25,425 --> 01:29:29,365
Speaker 6:  won almost all of the claims except the one California state law

1595
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:33,005
Speaker 6:  claim that basically made their anti steering

1596
01:29:33,005 --> 01:29:36,765
Speaker 6:  provision illegal. The thing where you can't tell anyone else that you can

1597
01:29:36,765 --> 01:29:40,005
Speaker 6:  go buy stuff elsewhere. Right. Apple appealed that Epic appealed that they

1598
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:42,725
Speaker 6:  got all the way to appealing the Supreme Court, which said, no, we don't

1599
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:46,645
Speaker 6:  want to, we, we've got other things in our minds, the

1600
01:29:46,645 --> 01:29:50,245
Speaker 6:  Supreme Court ladies and gentlemen, that means the case is over and this

1601
01:29:50,305 --> 01:29:53,605
Speaker 6:  one ruling that Apple lost, you cannot have the anti steering provision

1602
01:29:54,665 --> 01:29:58,245
Speaker 6:  exists. Right. And Apple is basically doing what you would call malicious

1603
01:29:58,245 --> 01:30:02,165
Speaker 6:  compliance. Right. They have, they have found a way to comply with

1604
01:30:02,165 --> 01:30:05,525
Speaker 6:  the letter of the law and absolutely not its spirit. By doing this

1605
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:09,405
Speaker 6:  27% thing, if any purchase happens on the web within seven days of someone

1606
01:30:09,645 --> 01:30:12,565
Speaker 6:  clicking that link, you have to audit it. It's great. I mean, it's crazy.

1607
01:30:13,445 --> 01:30:17,125
Speaker 6:  And so Epic is mad and they have said they're gonna go back to the

1608
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:20,205
Speaker 6:  trial court and say, this is not what you intended to have happening. Right.

1609
01:30:20,205 --> 01:30:23,205
Speaker 6:  Like, this cannot be the outcome you anticipated when you wrote that ruling.

1610
01:30:23,225 --> 01:30:23,925
Speaker 6:  And we'll see what happens.

1611
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:27,365
Speaker 8:  Malicious compliance is exactly the correct way to put it. Yeah. It's it's

1612
01:30:27,495 --> 01:30:30,685
Speaker 8:  delightful. It's so petty. It is ridiculous.

1613
01:30:30,835 --> 01:30:34,765
Speaker 6:  Look, I, I get that there's like lots of money involved here and, but

1614
01:30:34,765 --> 01:30:38,285
Speaker 6:  Apple is like doing, they're doing some stuff that is dangerous for their

1615
01:30:38,285 --> 01:30:41,925
Speaker 6:  reputation. Yeah. With app developers here with, with these games. And I

1616
01:30:42,945 --> 01:30:45,565
Speaker 6:  Ooh I there's something, there's something there that's dangerous.

1617
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:49,405
Speaker 8:  Well, and that's happening while like do the, the whole hey thing That

1618
01:30:49,465 --> 01:30:53,365
Speaker 8:  became a fiasco, what two summers ago is that was a

1619
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,565
Speaker 8:  mini fiasco again, this time because Apple rejected Hay's Calendar app,

1620
01:30:57,045 --> 01:31:00,045
Speaker 8:  there have been rumblings that an antitrust case against Apple is coming

1621
01:31:00,185 --> 01:31:03,565
Speaker 8:  sooner rather than later this year. Like the, the,

1622
01:31:04,145 --> 01:31:08,085
Speaker 8:  the smoke is pretty ugly when it comes to the Apple versus developers

1623
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:10,085
Speaker 8:  fight at this moment in time. Yeah,

1624
01:31:10,855 --> 01:31:11,205
Speaker 6:  We'll

1625
01:31:11,285 --> 01:31:13,885
Speaker 8:  See. And it's gonna get, we're gonna get a lot more fairly quickly I

1626
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:17,205
Speaker 7:  Think, which is not great when you have a giant new totally

1627
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:21,605
Speaker 7:  like architecture that you're trying to get people to adopt. Yeah. And

1628
01:31:21,605 --> 01:31:24,445
Speaker 7:  develop for probably not the best time to piss off all your developers.

1629
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:27,765
Speaker 6:  And by the way, the argument from app developers has always been yes, the

1630
01:31:27,765 --> 01:31:30,765
Speaker 6:  phone is very valuable. We are the ones who made it valuable. Right?

1631
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:31,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1632
01:31:31,275 --> 01:31:34,005
Speaker 6:  Like there's an app for that is a real way that they market the phone. Yeah.

1633
01:31:34,495 --> 01:31:38,325
Speaker 6:  We'll see. Okay. Mine is, I just wanna call out Alex

1634
01:31:38,335 --> 01:31:41,845
Speaker 6:  Heath interviewed Mark Zuckerberg on the site that published literally today

1635
01:31:41,845 --> 01:31:45,205
Speaker 6:  as we were, we were setting down to tape this episode. Zuckerberg's thing

1636
01:31:45,205 --> 01:31:49,005
Speaker 6:  is beta's pivoting to building a GI, artificial

1637
01:31:49,005 --> 01:31:52,965
Speaker 6:  general intelligence. He's doing that pretty obviously to make

1638
01:31:52,965 --> 01:31:56,725
Speaker 6:  sure that Meta can compete for talent. This is like

1639
01:31:56,745 --> 01:31:59,300
Speaker 6:  the thing that all these companies are thinking about. All the hottest talent

1640
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:02,885
Speaker 6:  in the industry is going to go build a GI somewhere or the other. And Meta

1641
01:32:02,885 --> 01:32:05,325
Speaker 6:  wants to be in the game and I just wanna call this out,

1642
01:32:07,025 --> 01:32:10,965
Speaker 6:  he, part of their cell is, he's like, we have more Nvidia H

1643
01:32:10,965 --> 01:32:14,045
Speaker 6:  one hundreds than anyone. They have 340,000 Nvidia H one

1644
01:32:14,045 --> 01:32:14,725
Speaker 8:  Hundreds, which is nuts.

1645
01:32:15,025 --> 01:32:18,725
Speaker 6:  And I just think it is incredible. We have arrived at a place where the CEO

1646
01:32:18,725 --> 01:32:22,125
Speaker 6:  of a company like Meta is like, we have more GPUs than anyone else. You should

1647
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:23,925
Speaker 6:  come work here. I

1648
01:32:23,925 --> 01:32:25,005
Speaker 8:  Think that's, come play with my GPUs.

1649
01:32:25,445 --> 01:32:28,085
Speaker 6:  I think that's pretty good. I just, I, there's a part of me that's like,

1650
01:32:28,305 --> 01:32:32,005
Speaker 6:  that's the funniest part of this whole story is part of the Pitch is like

1651
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:35,045
Speaker 6:  they've got, they've got more GPUs. We

1652
01:32:35,045 --> 01:32:37,965
Speaker 7:  Got so many GPUs in this office. You come right over.

1653
01:32:38,275 --> 01:32:41,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Pretty good. But you should read the whole thing. There is, you know,

1654
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,405
Speaker 6:  Alex rightfully pushed back. He said, look, you, you just changed the name

1655
01:32:44,405 --> 01:32:45,125
Speaker 6:  of the company to Meta.

1656
01:32:46,845 --> 01:32:50,765
Speaker 6:  Zuckerberg's answer to this is like, it's not the huge change.

1657
01:32:50,835 --> 01:32:53,485
Speaker 6:  It's that in the virtual world to connect with other people. Maybe you'll

1658
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:57,405
Speaker 6:  be talking to Agis in virtual characters and and don don't know man. You

1659
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:58,565
Speaker 6:  can go read it yourself. Well

1660
01:32:58,565 --> 01:33:00,805
Speaker 7:  You need to talk to somebody in there and there's not a lot of people.

1661
01:33:01,235 --> 01:33:03,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Here's a quote, I don't know how to more unequivocally state that we're

1662
01:33:03,845 --> 01:33:06,765
Speaker 6:  continuing to focus on reality labs in the Metaverse. They're still spending

1663
01:33:06,765 --> 01:33:10,685
Speaker 6:  $15 billion a year on it and Zuckerberg sees the future

1664
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:14,005
Speaker 6:  when virtual worlds are generated by AI and filled with AI characters in

1665
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:14,765
Speaker 6:  a company. Real people.

1666
01:33:15,425 --> 01:33:16,405
Speaker 7:  So ready player one

1667
01:33:16,635 --> 01:33:20,045
Speaker 8:  That tracks for me. I really don't think that is a

1668
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,845
Speaker 8:  justification from Zuckerberg. I mean it's a small one but I, I don't think,

1669
01:33:24,605 --> 01:33:27,005
Speaker 8:  I don't think the company's saying we're in on the metaverse and then saying

1670
01:33:27,005 --> 01:33:30,445
Speaker 8:  we're in on AI means like 180 degree

1671
01:33:30,695 --> 01:33:34,565
Speaker 8:  pivot you to make the Metaverse work is going to require

1672
01:33:34,805 --> 01:33:38,525
Speaker 8:  a huge amount of really sophisticated ai. I don't know if it

1673
01:33:38,525 --> 01:33:42,485
Speaker 8:  involves Tom Brady playing a character who will talk with me in

1674
01:33:42,525 --> 01:33:46,405
Speaker 8:  a messaging app. But like again, I think a thing

1675
01:33:46,405 --> 01:33:50,285
Speaker 8:  I've been saying a lot is like we need more terms than just ai. We call everything

1676
01:33:50,465 --> 01:33:54,245
Speaker 8:  AI and actually AI is a million different things and

1677
01:33:55,985 --> 01:33:59,645
Speaker 8:  having a lot of GPUs you can use to do stuff is gonna be pretty useful in

1678
01:33:59,645 --> 01:34:00,085
Speaker 8:  the metaverse.

1679
01:34:00,465 --> 01:34:03,005
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna start putting how many GPUs we have in our trouble station?

1680
01:34:04,155 --> 01:34:07,645
Speaker 6:  There's like five. It's they're good. 1440 p

1681
01:34:08,145 --> 01:34:08,925
Speaker 6:  You're gonna like it.

1682
01:34:10,445 --> 01:34:13,445
Speaker 6:  I agree. I just think the idea that the top line is not still a metaverse

1683
01:34:13,705 --> 01:34:14,605
Speaker 6:  is really interesting.

1684
01:34:14,905 --> 01:34:15,565
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah. Yeah. To

1685
01:34:15,565 --> 01:34:18,765
Speaker 6:  Build a great metaverse we need to build basically a GI is a coherent story.

1686
01:34:19,175 --> 01:34:23,165
Speaker 6:  We're ag we're we're doing it now is like there's, there's a little

1687
01:34:23,165 --> 01:34:24,645
Speaker 6:  bit of flip floppiness.

1688
01:34:24,645 --> 01:34:27,925
Speaker 8:  Oh totally. And he is definitely saying we're an AI company that is also

1689
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:31,045
Speaker 8:  building the metaverse. Not we're a metaverse company that is building AI

1690
01:34:31,045 --> 01:34:33,845
Speaker 8:  in order to get there. And that's like, that's the thing you say because

1691
01:34:33,845 --> 01:34:36,565
Speaker 8:  the Metaverse has been real bad for your stock price over the last couple

1692
01:34:36,565 --> 01:34:36,765
Speaker 8:  of years

1693
01:34:37,785 --> 01:34:41,605
Speaker 6:  And because Apple's about to put out the Vision Pro Yeah. Which it feels

1694
01:34:41,605 --> 01:34:45,485
Speaker 6:  like the next turn. Like it's more if you thought

1695
01:34:45,485 --> 01:34:48,925
Speaker 6:  we talked about the Vision Pro too much today. Just wait until we actually

1696
01:34:48,925 --> 01:34:49,325
Speaker 6:  get one.

1697
01:34:49,795 --> 01:34:50,085
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1698
01:34:50,345 --> 01:34:53,485
Speaker 6:  And we surround ourselves with Iowa speakers and Smeg refrigerators.

1699
01:34:53,485 --> 01:34:55,605
Speaker 8:  Yeah. When does this thing go on sale? February 2nd.

1700
01:34:56,605 --> 01:34:57,765
Speaker 6:  February 2nd. Okay. Yeah, it's

1701
01:34:57,765 --> 01:35:00,805
Speaker 8:  Coming at some point in the near future we're going to have a lot more to

1702
01:35:00,805 --> 01:35:02,525
Speaker 8:  say about this and I'm sorry in advance.

1703
01:35:03,045 --> 01:35:06,565
Speaker 6:  Alright. Please send us an email if you think people have heard of VR headsets

1704
01:35:06,565 --> 01:35:10,285
Speaker 6:  before, you can address them to David at The Verge dot com And we would love

1705
01:35:10,285 --> 01:35:12,365
Speaker 6:  to know Verge has at The Verge dot com would be great. I

1706
01:35:12,365 --> 01:35:15,285
