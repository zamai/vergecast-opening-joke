Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz follow up on all the rest of the gadgets and tech seen at CES 2024.

2
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:55,345
Speaker 2:  Hello and welcome to Our Chest, the flagship podcast of Affectionate

3
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:55,825
Speaker 2:  Intelligence.

4
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:59,305
Speaker 4:  Aw. Aw. Yeah. That's so nice. It's really cute. That's how I describe you

5
00:00:59,305 --> 00:00:59,905
Speaker 4:  most of the time.

6
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:04,625
Speaker 2:  It's an all-knowing kind of cobbly intelligence. The affectionate intelligence

7
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:08,025
Speaker 2:  is how LG is branding. Its AI washing machines.

8
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:09,255
Speaker 5:  Uhoh.

9
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:13,775
Speaker 2:  Huh? So they don't have, you know, you go to the LG booth. Yeah. LG makes

10
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:17,575
Speaker 2:  everything. Yes. So here's our washing machines. Here's our little

11
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,055
Speaker 2:  robot guy. And all the AI stuff is affectionate intelligence.

12
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,285
Speaker 4:  Okay. 'cause it's ai. Because it's ai it's also ai.

13
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:25,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

14
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:26,325
Speaker 5:  It's like pers instead of personal

15
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:29,205
Speaker 2:  Intelligence. It's not like chat GBT, which will lie to you and then try

16
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:30,005
Speaker 2:  to bang you. Yeah.

17
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:30,725
Speaker 5:  It's,

18
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,165
Speaker 2:  This is much more, it's just gonna

19
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,565
Speaker 5:  Make sure your, your sweaters are dry.

20
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:35,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:36,315 --> 00:01:37,205
Speaker 4:  I've given, LG has

22
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:40,485
Speaker 2:  A little robot, so we, we should, LG and Samsung both have little robots.

23
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:43,565
Speaker 2:  We'll talk about Bali 'cause David, and I'm gonna have to see Bali in action.

24
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:47,645
Speaker 2:  The LG robot is so silly. Like they're not even

25
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,645
Speaker 2:  pretending that this will be a real product. It

26
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:50,285
Speaker 5:  Doesn't even have arms.

27
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Just like, it's just like a little thing that walks around and and

28
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:57,485
Speaker 2:  makes squeaky noise about you. It's cute. It is Very cute. So it's day

29
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:01,565
Speaker 2:  two of Vergecast at CES. We're sitting here at the Kia connected home right

30
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:05,125
Speaker 2:  in front of the show floor at css. I'm your friend NELI. David Pierce is

31
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,965
Speaker 2:  here. Hello. Alex Fran is here. Hey. The. Verge team is everywhere across

32
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:12,765
Speaker 2:  the show floor. Yes. If you are on our site or you're on TikTok or whatever

33
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:16,925
Speaker 2:  you've seen, we've got reporters everywhere. They're making themselves

34
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:20,565
Speaker 2:  sick at laser shows. It has been quite an experience here at cs. I would

35
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:21,445
Speaker 2:  say. It's been a good show.

36
00:02:21,705 --> 00:02:25,525
Speaker 4:  It has been a good show. It's been, I would say not as like

37
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:29,525
Speaker 4:  full of wildness as CES sometimes is.

38
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:33,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like there are very few sort of bonkers off the

39
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:36,965
Speaker 4:  wall new things as there sometimes are.

40
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:41,285
Speaker 4:  But in terms of like actual cool things that might be actually cool in

41
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:44,845
Speaker 4:  the actual world, like Yeah, it's been pretty good. Then there's more here

42
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,205
Speaker 4:  than I expected actually. Yeah,

43
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:50,045
Speaker 2:  There's, and it's a lot of iteration has occurred, right? Yeah. And then

44
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:54,005
Speaker 2:  you can like slap chap GPT on it. And the test I

45
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:57,925
Speaker 2:  always use at CS is the local news test. Like, how ridiculous is

46
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:01,885
Speaker 2:  CSS by how many things break through the barrier of local

47
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:05,525
Speaker 2:  news programming? Oh, that's good. Mm. And that one that I always remember,

48
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:09,645
Speaker 2:  the, the baseline product for this test is the year there

49
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:13,405
Speaker 2:  was the Smart Fork. And it would tell you if you were eating

50
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:17,325
Speaker 2:  too fast. Yep. It didn't actually work. But poor

51
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,795
Speaker 2:  Joanna Stern was at a BC at the time. Yeah.

52
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,115
Speaker 2:  And so she was just like on every local news broadcast in America being like,

53
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:28,715
Speaker 2:  it's a smart fork. There's not a lot of smart fork at css.

54
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,955
Speaker 4:  There was so much enthusiasm for the smart fork. There was like, it was,

55
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:35,835
Speaker 4:  it was such earnest belief that this was a good

56
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:38,355
Speaker 4:  idea. That just these were simpler times.

57
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,995
Speaker 2:  But that's how you, that's how I measure CSS is like what's, is there garbage

58
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:45,595
Speaker 2:  that breaks through to the local news or is there meaningful

59
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:49,515
Speaker 2:  technology that is, and like there's a lot of meaningful technology. There's

60
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:50,555
Speaker 2:  a little bit of local news garbage

61
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:54,395
Speaker 4:  This year. It's the, it's the e Ink toilet, right? I

62
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:58,075
Speaker 2:  Think it's the, the e ink toilet. The sort of transparent display situation.

63
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:01,555
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But there is, gee should watch the video. Jen Tuy went and looked at

64
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:05,355
Speaker 2:  an ink toilet from Kohler. You get the feeling to Kohler

65
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:08,995
Speaker 2:  has like maybe more r and d money than it knows what to do with Kohler.

66
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,035
Speaker 4:  Have you been to Kohler's booth?

67
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:10,635
Speaker 2:  I have not yet.

68
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:14,635
Speaker 4:  Kohler's Booth has all kinds of stuff and then don

69
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:18,075
Speaker 4:  don't know. 15 just running showers. Yeah.

70
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,555
Speaker 4:  All going into like a pond. There's just a pond. but it's

71
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,035
Speaker 5:  Soothing. It's very soothing. Like you walk into it and you're like, I'm

72
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:24,555
Speaker 5:  in a little garden.

73
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:28,315
Speaker 2:  Take bath. Look. I'm from Wisconsin. Kohler literally owns a company town

74
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:31,915
Speaker 2:  called Kohler, Wisconsin. I wish Kohler nothing but the best. You know,

75
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:35,275
Speaker 2:  pump some of that water back into the local economy, if you know what I'm

76
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,155
Speaker 2:  saying. Every year Kohler's, like this time the toilet has more

77
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:42,315
Speaker 2:  technology in it. Yes. It's pretty great. Okay. So I. Think we're gonna break

78
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,875
Speaker 2:  the show up into three segments. If you watched our earlier show this week,

79
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:50,315
Speaker 2:  David's Gambit was, that was the Screens show. And this is meant

80
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:52,075
Speaker 2:  to be the not screen show

81
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:55,395
Speaker 4:  In, despite the fact that many of the things we're gonna talk about have

82
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,595
Speaker 2:  Screening. Almost everything we're gonna talk about has screens here.

83
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,155
Speaker 4:  My methodology is not to be questioned, but

84
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:02,395
Speaker 2:  It's products that are screen products.

85
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,435
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That are like about the screens. And then

86
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:08,335
Speaker 2:  Now, and then this show is all the products that are products

87
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,815
Speaker 2:  that have screens. I

88
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:13,295
Speaker 4:  Mean, we have e ink toilets now. Like everything has screens. There were,

89
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:16,535
Speaker 4:  we've, we wrote stories about headphone cases that have screens on them now.

90
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:19,855
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like you just cannot avoid screens anymore. But they're like,

91
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,775
Speaker 4:  not the point of the thing. Right. They're just like, one of the gadgets

92
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:24,775
Speaker 4:  we're gonna talk about, they're literally

93
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:26,095
Speaker 2:  Gonna show you ads. Literally

94
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:29,895
Speaker 4:  The question was, why did you put a screen on this? And his answer

95
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:33,215
Speaker 4:  was, eh, screens are cheap. That's literally what it was. And so it's like,

96
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:35,335
Speaker 4:  that's just, screens are cheap and they're everywhere.

97
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:38,855
Speaker 2:  Okay. So we're gonna talk about some gadgets then. We should talk about a

98
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:42,735
Speaker 2:  bunch of standards that hit pretty important moments at the show. Yeah.

99
00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:42,895
Speaker 2:  Which

100
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:46,935
Speaker 4:  Actually kind of is the story Yeah. Of CES this year. It's like there

101
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:50,495
Speaker 4:  are big standards that are gonna start to be everywhere that are like here

102
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:51,695
Speaker 4:  in a really meaningful way. Yeah.

103
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:55,415
Speaker 2:  Like wifi seven had a moment. Thunderbolt five is here. This was a

104
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:59,645
Speaker 2:  smart home stuff. Alex had an A TSC 3.0 adventure, which is pretty

105
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:02,245
Speaker 2:  good. It was wonderful. It's a magic. And then we should talk about some

106
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:05,325
Speaker 2:  cars. 'cause there's tons of Cs always has tons and tons of cars at it. And

107
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,805
Speaker 2:  we'll just go through all the Carney. Well let's start with gadgets. And

108
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:11,725
Speaker 2:  I wanna start David, with what is undeniably the breakout gadget hit of

109
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:15,325
Speaker 2:  the show, which you have seen? Yes. And talk to the founder of The Rabbit.

110
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:16,045
Speaker 2:  R one.

111
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:20,085
Speaker 4:  This thing came out of absolutely nowhere. Yeah. And I think probably has

112
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:23,765
Speaker 4:  been the most talked about single device

113
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Of the show. It's either that or the transparent TVs. Yeah. But so

114
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:31,085
Speaker 4:  this thing is basically, it's just dedicated AI

115
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,925
Speaker 4:  hardware, right? It's like, if you've ever seen the, the panic play date,

116
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,125
Speaker 4:  that little console with the, the, yeah. Crank the crank.

117
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,285
Speaker 4:  It's feels just like that. It's like colorful and orange. It has a button

118
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:45,005
Speaker 4:  on the side and a camera and a scroll wheel. And it was made by teenage

119
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:47,605
Speaker 4:  engineering. And so it's like lovely. And all the buttons feel really good.

120
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:51,925
Speaker 4:  But the shtick is, it's an AI gadget. And this company Rabbit, which

121
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:55,765
Speaker 4:  has kind of an interesting history, its founder has worked on AI stuff

122
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:59,485
Speaker 4:  for a really long time. He's on the board of teenage engineering. So he's

123
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:03,205
Speaker 4:  like connected to this world. They built this whole big new

124
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:07,205
Speaker 4:  thing where instead of a large language model like chat GPT, which is fundamentally

125
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:11,085
Speaker 4:  about, like you input something and you get text back, this is

126
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,445
Speaker 4:  about like doing stuff, right? So their idea is you should be able to say,

127
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:19,125
Speaker 4:  I want to accomplish any goal. I want to listen to music. I need a ride

128
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:23,045
Speaker 4:  here. Order me something, book me flights on something, whatever.

129
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:27,085
Speaker 4:  And have it all be like accomplishable with all of the services

130
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:31,085
Speaker 4:  you use. But inside of what amounts to an assistant,

131
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:36,435
Speaker 4:  1 million, billion unanswered questions about that. So many. But it's

132
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:40,315
Speaker 4:  $199. It's a like adorable little gadget. And the

133
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,315
Speaker 4:  two reactions that everybody seems to have are either this

134
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:46,995
Speaker 4:  thing doesn't do anything that my phone doesn't do, why on earth would I

135
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:50,955
Speaker 4:  want it? And this thing doesn't do anything my phone doesn't do. And

136
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:51,995
Speaker 4:  oh my God, I want it so bad.

137
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:56,115
Speaker 2:  That's me. Yeah. It is very cute. Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:59,355
Speaker 2:  I think people are just reacting to the idea that they could purchase a gadget.

139
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:03,755
Speaker 2:  The questions are just in infinite. Yes. Yes.

140
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:06,395
Speaker 2:  Or like, for example, it's $200.

141
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:11,515
Speaker 2:  There's no recurring fee. Right. There's no subscription service. Right.

142
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,795
Speaker 2:  They, they, this thing can't be making money. Like just from the jump. It's

143
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:15,915
Speaker 2:  like,

144
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:17,075
Speaker 4:  It seems impossible. Yeah.

145
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:20,835
Speaker 2:  They have to run a cloud service. There's no way that they're making enough

146
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,035
Speaker 2:  money on the upfront sale to run the cloud service.

147
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,115
Speaker 5:  They had to pay like teenage engineering to do all the design work. Like,

148
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:29,355
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. Another question I have, and I encourage everyone to go watch

149
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:33,275
Speaker 2:  this. They put it out in what is a, can only be described

150
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,515
Speaker 2:  as a fake Apple keynote.

151
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:36,035
Speaker 4:  Oh, very much so. Yeah.

152
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:39,995
Speaker 2:  He's, he's standing there on a stage. don don't know if there's an

153
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:41,115
Speaker 2:  audience, but it doesn't appear there.

154
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:43,875
Speaker 4:  So I. Can I actually describe the scene to you? 'cause it's very funny. So

155
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:47,915
Speaker 4:  this wasn't on the show floor, it was kind of a secret thing.

156
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,075
Speaker 4:  Like I found out about it from like a relatively

157
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,755
Speaker 4:  sketchy email that was just like, we're launching the future of everything.

158
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:58,645
Speaker 4:  And I, I was like, well, all right. Like, I gotta, we'll just find out. It

159
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:02,325
Speaker 4:  was deep. I mean deep like it, like a mile and a half

160
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,445
Speaker 4:  walk from the front door of the wind to this like tiny little meeting

161
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,205
Speaker 4:  room in the back of the wind where this keynote was. And

162
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:14,045
Speaker 4:  it was set up. It was like in a ballroom. And you know, on the one side you

163
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:17,165
Speaker 4:  have tables for people to stand out and coffee and stuff. And on the other

164
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:21,045
Speaker 4:  side, maybe four rows of seats. And then this

165
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:25,085
Speaker 4:  big screen, and Jesse Lou, the founder standing in front of that, and

166
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:28,645
Speaker 4:  that's where they shot the whole thing. And it looks so polished and so

167
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:31,805
Speaker 4:  professional. And it's literally just him standing in a casino ballroom

168
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:34,645
Speaker 4:  talking in front of a screen. Yeah. It was very impressive.

169
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But you were in that audience.

170
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:37,405
Speaker 4:  I was in that audience.

171
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:40,685
Speaker 2:  So that was live. I thought that was a production, but no, you were there.

172
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,245
Speaker 2:  It was live. All right. So that's the experience you had. Yeah. The experience

173
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:47,045
Speaker 2:  I had was what appears to be a pre-produced

174
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,405
Speaker 2:  version of the presentation you were given, which

175
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:54,165
Speaker 4:  Now that I'm looking at it is even more aply than the thing. Right.

176
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:57,525
Speaker 2:  It looks like a fake Apple keynote. That's the introducing R one video on

177
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:00,165
Speaker 2:  their channel. Right. And the thing about this that caught me, and I'm wondering

178
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:03,845
Speaker 2:  if you saw this inaction is in the video,

179
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:08,285
Speaker 2:  he's like, asks it to do something and you look at the animation of

180
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:12,205
Speaker 2:  the Rabbit jumping, which is adorable. Yeah. But you never actually see

181
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:15,565
Speaker 2:  it do the thing. Right. He's like, success. And you're like,

182
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:19,765
Speaker 2:  what happened? But you like held it and got to use it.

183
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:20,765
Speaker 2:  Did it, did it work?

184
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:22,765
Speaker 4:  Y yes and no. Oh.

185
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:23,885
Speaker 2:  Oh,

186
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:27,965
Speaker 4:  Well, I did get to hold it, it did work. But we were

187
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:31,885
Speaker 4:  on horrible hotel wifi, which I can vouch for being horrible.

188
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:36,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So it kind of came and went in terms of actually being able to do anything

189
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:39,605
Speaker 4:  at all. And obviously a device like this can't do much offline period, because

190
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,885
Speaker 4:  everything it's doing is happening in the cloud. So after about

191
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:46,405
Speaker 4:  10 minutes of everybody's sort of playing with it, getting to try stuff,

192
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:50,805
Speaker 4:  he literally like disconnected it and just was handing it around to

193
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,885
Speaker 4:  people. But at one point it, Rick rolled somebody, somebody was holding in

194
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:56,125
Speaker 4:  their hand, that's pretty good. And, and never gonna give you up started

195
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,005
Speaker 4:  playing. That's pretty good. I think that might've been when they took it

196
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:58,925
Speaker 4:  offline for good. They're

197
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,045
Speaker 2:  Like, no, we're done. That's how it reacts to losing its connection. It's

198
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,925
Speaker 2:  like he was, you're gonna like this. So again, like

199
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:06,885
Speaker 4:  Added to the list of unanswered questions about this

200
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:10,725
Speaker 4:  thing is like, does it actually work? Because I think you're,

201
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:13,765
Speaker 4:  you're right. And a bunch of people had this reaction of like, you see him

202
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:17,645
Speaker 4:  talk into it Clever cut. You see it work

203
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:19,045
Speaker 4:  and it's like, well, yeah. And

204
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:19,285
Speaker 2:  What does it

205
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:24,015
Speaker 5:  Do? Like, like Who knows. I hate trying to understand that.

206
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:27,735
Speaker 2:  Okay. So, I I have. Okay. I'm just gonna say my ideas. Okay. And then David

207
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:29,935
Speaker 2:  can tell me if I'm okay. Yeah. How's that? That's how we'll structured this

208
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:33,815
Speaker 2:  because I, I don't think David actually knows either. Yeah. I

209
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:36,215
Speaker 4:  Think I, I bet I know slightly more than you, but only slightly.

210
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:41,535
Speaker 2:  So my understanding of this is that it is using

211
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:45,295
Speaker 2:  the apps for you. Right. And this is not a new idea.

212
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:49,015
Speaker 2:  Yeah. If you are a decoder listener, we've had like

213
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:53,295
Speaker 2:  robotic process automation episodes or big enterprises

214
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,925
Speaker 2:  basically bring in computers to use their old computers for them.

215
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:00,805
Speaker 2:  And like, these are big companies that do this work. And that's at the corporate

216
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:03,805
Speaker 2:  level. It's enterprise that this is a, a known thing. Yeah. We're gonna use

217
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:06,765
Speaker 2:  some machine learning and some computer vision, and we're gonna use Windows

218
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:10,245
Speaker 2:  3.1 instead of updating the hospital building system. Right. There's a real

219
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:13,565
Speaker 2:  thing that happens. There is a company called Cavo that I loved ages ago.

220
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Were, yeah, we talked about it last week. And they were gonna do machine

221
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:20,085
Speaker 2:  vision to like click around on your TV interface for you. Right.

222
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:23,205
Speaker 2:  They, they failed it. It didn't go well as we talked about last week. Yeah.

223
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:26,205
Speaker 4:  But not because you can't do it technically, like it is a possible thing

224
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:26,685
Speaker 4:  to do. It is

225
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:30,405
Speaker 2:  A thing you can do. Yeah. So this gadget, the

226
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:33,925
Speaker 2:  hardware seems less important than whatever is happening in the cloud.

227
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:35,525
Speaker 4:  Yes. Oh, very much so. The

228
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:39,325
Speaker 2:  The hardware is just like a little bitty cute thing you can ask questions

229
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,885
Speaker 2:  of. Yeah. And then somewhere in the cloud it appears they're spinning up

230
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:46,645
Speaker 2:  like Android virtual machines that have your Spotify

231
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:50,805
Speaker 2:  app or whatever on it. Right. And then it's clicking around on a little

232
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:54,605
Speaker 2:  Android phone, like a virtual Android phone in the cloud and then delivering

233
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:55,205
Speaker 2:  you the result

234
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:56,685
Speaker 5:  Onto the little

235
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:57,285
Speaker 2:  Guy onto the

236
00:12:57,285 --> 00:13:01,205
Speaker 4:  Little thing. So that is also, I think my

237
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:04,885
Speaker 4:  understanding of like the most likely way for it to work. What that doesn't

238
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:09,205
Speaker 4:  do is jive at all with what Rabbit says about

239
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,765
Speaker 4:  privacy, which is that it doesn't store your credentials. Yeah. Yeah. And

240
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:14,765
Speaker 4:  so there's, there's like a total disconnect there that I just don't understand.

241
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:18,485
Speaker 4:  And what I do know is they have this training mode where you can like teach

242
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:22,005
Speaker 4:  Rabbit how to do something for you. Like one of the examples, Jesse, the

243
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:25,805
Speaker 4:  CEO gives is how to remove a watermark from Photoshop. And the way that you

244
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,645
Speaker 4:  do it is you literally go into Rabbit Hole, which is like their adorably

245
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:32,285
Speaker 4:  named portal for getting all your apps. Really. It's very good. Good name.

246
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:36,725
Speaker 4:  Like the, the whole branding of this is excellent. You go into

247
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:40,245
Speaker 4:  it and you, like you said, you boot up a virtual Windows machine, you load

248
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:44,165
Speaker 4:  Photoshop and this is all like rabbit's, computers not yours,

249
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:47,965
Speaker 4:  right? Yeah. So you're, you load up Photoshop and then you narrate aloud

250
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:52,205
Speaker 4:  what you're doing as you're teaching the model how to do it. So you go through

251
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:55,205
Speaker 4:  the process and you say, and then you, you go over here and you select the

252
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:58,125
Speaker 4:  lasso, and then you select you, you lasso around the watermark, and then

253
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,725
Speaker 4:  you click this and that and that, and you remove the watermark and that's

254
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:04,285
Speaker 4:  how you train the model. So in terms of like how to actually

255
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:08,525
Speaker 4:  interact with the underlying model, your metaphor is exactly right.

256
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:12,805
Speaker 4:  Then what happens after that? Yeah. I do not know because like once I

257
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:16,645
Speaker 4:  give it my Spotify credentials, Rabbit says unambiguously

258
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,845
Speaker 4:  that it does not then keep my Spotify credentials and I have no idea.

259
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. How it cannot be.

260
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:25,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. At some point it just has to have a token to log into Spotify on your

261
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:26,645
Speaker 2:  behalf. Right? Right.

262
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:30,965
Speaker 5:  Are we sure it's absolutely gonna be in the cloud or is it gonna be in

263
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:33,725
Speaker 5:  the cloud than talking to your phone and in the cloud talking to your

264
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:34,005
Speaker 2:  Laptop?

265
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:36,485
Speaker 4:  It's not talking to your devices. That I know for sure. But

266
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:40,405
Speaker 2:  Do they have a rack of like mid-range Android phones? Yeah. Maybe

267
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:43,445
Speaker 2:  like hot dog fingers just banging away on 'em. Like

268
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:46,925
Speaker 4:  Beepers thing with the Mac Minis getting into your iMessages. Yeah, yeah.

269
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:50,005
Speaker 2:  There, this is just a big question I have about this whole product. Right.

270
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:53,565
Speaker 2:  Which is, it sounds really cool. What if you had an assistant that could

271
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:57,165
Speaker 2:  use a computer for you? Right? Yeah. Very good. Yeah. Right. And You don't,

272
00:14:57,165 --> 00:15:00,765
Speaker 2:  and you don't have to re-architect all these apps and services. You don't

273
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:04,685
Speaker 2:  need Adobe's permission. Maybe I Yeah. Big question

274
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:08,285
Speaker 2:  mark there. But you have a computer in the cloud, it's loaded up with

275
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,305
Speaker 2:  legal apps and services. Who knows

276
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:17,425
Speaker 2:  it's not Alex's Plex server. It's a computer in the cloud and a

277
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:20,505
Speaker 2:  robot's gonna click around on it for you and then do the work for

278
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:24,345
Speaker 5:  You. And that just means that the pri like, that just can't work with,

279
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,425
Speaker 5:  with the privacy claims.

280
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,665
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah. It's, it's very difficult to, and they

281
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:31,745
Speaker 4:  Also very clear about the privacy claims. Like it's, they're either just

282
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:32,905
Speaker 2:  Boldly

283
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:36,785
Speaker 4:  Lying or there is some clever turn that we don't know

284
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:40,025
Speaker 4:  yet and they're not really talking about yet. Yeah, yeah. But, but it's not,

285
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:43,945
Speaker 4:  they're not doing the like, you know, sketchy, you know, deflect when

286
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:45,625
Speaker 4:  you ask questions of the like No, they're, they're

287
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,425
Speaker 2:  Just very

288
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:50,025
Speaker 4:  Straightforward about like, we do not store your stuff. So, and I'm like,

289
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:50,345
Speaker 4:  how

290
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:54,345
Speaker 2:  I'll do the same sort of exercise as we did with the humane AI pin. Yeah.

291
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:57,785
Speaker 2:  Right. You're like, here's the demo. So one of the demos was Spotify music,

292
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:01,625
Speaker 2:  right? Yeah. Okay. To make that work, they need your Spotify credentials.

293
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:05,605
Speaker 2:  Then they've got log into Spotify somewhere somehow.

294
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:10,645
Speaker 2:  We don't know where or how, we don't know if they have a virtual Android

295
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:14,485
Speaker 2:  computer or virtual Windows computer. We don't know how your

296
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:18,725
Speaker 2:  $200 one-time payment is paying for that server cost. Right.

297
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:22,405
Speaker 2:  That's just the beginning. Yeah. Then they've logged into Spotify,

298
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,325
Speaker 2:  their large action model has clicked around Spotify and

299
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:31,005
Speaker 2:  found the song you want from the artist you want, which even

300
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:34,925
Speaker 2:  Spotify search is not great at. Correct. So that's

301
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,445
Speaker 2:  the, there's a whole problem there, right. It's gonna navigate the Spotify

302
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:40,285
Speaker 2:  interface, which is more and more geared towards like

303
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:45,405
Speaker 2:  what if you listen to a podcast. Yeah. Right? So like two different

304
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:48,565
Speaker 2:  computers are gonna be hostile to each other in that specific way.

305
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,005
Speaker 2:  Then it's gonna stream the audio from Spotify.

306
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:56,765
Speaker 2:  Spotify's audio is DRM to hell and back because it's a streaming

307
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,725
Speaker 2:  service. So now it's accepting a DRM audio stream, and then

308
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,405
Speaker 2:  it's gonna send it to your Rabbit,

309
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,925
Speaker 2:  it's gonna send it to your headphones. That little

310
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:12,125
Speaker 2:  transcoding step where it re-broadcast the DRM audio

311
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:16,405
Speaker 2:  is, I would call it a pickle. Yeah, yeah. If you will.

312
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:16,925
Speaker 2:  I think

313
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:20,885
Speaker 5:  There's just like a vague whiff of vapor you think So to

314
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:24,685
Speaker 5:  this, this thing. Like, it just, there's, there's too many things where it's

315
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,925
Speaker 5:  like, no, that doesn't compute. That's not how computers, that's good. Yeah.

316
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:31,125
Speaker 5:  That's good. Yeah. There's, there, this is just not how computers work. This

317
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,125
Speaker 5:  is just not how like any of these services work.

318
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:38,225
Speaker 5:  How, and the fact that they're not saying how, but they do have this really

319
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:39,545
Speaker 5:  gorgeous hardware. Like, well,

320
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:43,385
Speaker 2:  So I do think the, how it's not such a leap. The how.

321
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:47,345
Speaker 2:  Okay. Right. Because machine vision to operate a computer interface

322
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:51,325
Speaker 2:  has been deployed in other contexts. Right. The thing that gets me is the

323
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:51,685
Speaker 2:  cost.

324
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:53,965
Speaker 5:  Right? No, it's, it's the cost. Like

325
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:57,925
Speaker 2:  If you call Microsoft to come do a big RPA integration in your healthcare

326
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:01,885
Speaker 2:  system, that is millions of dollars. Yes. It is.

327
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:03,405
Speaker 2:  Not $200. Yes.

328
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:05,685
Speaker 5:  One time payment of $200

329
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,125
Speaker 2:  A one time payment of $200. Like that. I, I'm just dying to know. And then

330
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,725
Speaker 2:  they sold, which is to their credit, they sold vastly more than they thought

331
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:16,085
Speaker 2:  they were gonna sell. They sold out of their first run of 10,000 units in

332
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:20,205
Speaker 2:  a day, maybe hours even. Yeah. So they, they've just signed up to

333
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:24,125
Speaker 2:  run a pretty large set of what, 10,000 virtual machines at

334
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:24,285
Speaker 2:  least.

335
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:28,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you know, we used to see that a lot in the

336
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,925
Speaker 5:  Kickstarter days. Yeah. And then eventually you'd get an email saying, my

337
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,805
Speaker 5:  bad. Yeah. And, and, and I like this has that

338
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:39,685
Speaker 5:  kind of feeling to me because the privacy situation and like, and the cost

339
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:43,675
Speaker 5:  are two things. Like you need to explain, there's, there's a big

340
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:47,595
Speaker 5:  missing piece here and you haven't disclosed it. And I kind of need

341
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:50,395
Speaker 5:  to understand that. Yeah. even that I do, I would a hundred percent have

342
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,555
Speaker 5:  spent $200 on it if I'd gotten in, like

343
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:53,955
Speaker 2:  They're gonna open up another wrap. Yeah.

344
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:56,675
Speaker 5:  Seem hardware seem very confident itself. I'm like, I just wanna play with

345
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:57,915
Speaker 2:  That. Yeah. I love a teenage engineering device.

346
00:18:57,985 --> 00:19:00,395
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Like that's pretty cheap for, for us teenage

347
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:04,355
Speaker 4:  Engineering like to everybody in March. Like this is Right by all

348
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:06,795
Speaker 4:  accounts, their version of this thing is like ready.

349
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:11,155
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And, and again, I think that to Alex's point, like the how of it,

350
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:14,875
Speaker 2:  it's not like other people couldn't have come up with this idea. I think

351
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,195
Speaker 2:  their challenges are can you, because it actually work, is it brittle or

352
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:21,675
Speaker 2:  does it really flexible? Right. Spotify changes the interface.

353
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:26,315
Speaker 2:  Will it actually survive that Photoshop moves some buttons around, will it

354
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:29,475
Speaker 2:  survive that? That's got a run on Windows. By the way, you're not, they're

355
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:32,675
Speaker 2:  running Photoshop on like an Android phone, like a mid-range Android phone

356
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:33,635
Speaker 2:  with a hotdog finger Your

357
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:36,075
Speaker 5:  Hands. Well I, I mean they could be using like Azure or they could be using

358
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:37,515
Speaker 5:  AWS Right. Just

359
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:40,235
Speaker 2:  Put all just cost after cost after cost. Right. Totally.

360
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:43,595
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm just like, can I just read you a few sentences from their privacy

361
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:47,755
Speaker 4:  webpage, which is actually like a useful summary of everything we've been

362
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:50,675
Speaker 4:  talking about. So it says, when you interact with Rabbit oss, you'll be assigned

363
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:54,195
Speaker 4:  a dedicated and isolated environment on our cloud for your own large

364
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,915
Speaker 4:  action model. Which more or less Yeah.

365
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:57,315
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

366
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,995
Speaker 4:  Jives about machine. When our rabbits perform tasks for you,

367
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:04,035
Speaker 4:  they will use your own accounts that you have securely granted as control

368
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:07,595
Speaker 4:  over through our Rabbit hole web portal. We do not store your passwords for

369
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:11,395
Speaker 4:  these services. I literally don't see how those two sentences can both be

370
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:11,755
Speaker 4:  true. Because

371
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:15,355
Speaker 2:  You don't need the password persistently. Yeah. You need it for like a, a

372
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:17,955
Speaker 2:  second to get the off, off token.

373
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:22,195
Speaker 4:  True. If you're running Spotify's API, not if

374
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:25,115
Speaker 4:  you're logging in on a new machine that I'm spinning up every single time.

375
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:25,395
Speaker 4:  No,

376
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:29,035
Speaker 2:  But it says you have access to a machine, they're you, they're giving you

377
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:30,675
Speaker 2:  a little cloud computer that is yours.

378
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:34,545
Speaker 4:  So for these 10,000 people who bought $200 Rabbit

379
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:37,385
Speaker 4:  R ones, they also bought a computer. Yeah.

380
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:39,385
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's, this is what I'm asking. Yeah. It

381
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,305
Speaker 4:  Doesn't make any sense. I

382
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,025
Speaker 5:  Mean that's what it sounds like, like it sounds like they're saying we personally

383
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:47,885
Speaker 5:  aren't gonna have like your code everywhere. Instead our

384
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:51,805
Speaker 5:  cloud, like your little cloud computer that we manage is gonna have

385
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:55,485
Speaker 5:  it. Right. And it little splitting cares there a Rabbit

386
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:55,805
Speaker 5:  joke.

387
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well and this is, this is why if you're a lot of these companies, you

388
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:02,245
Speaker 4:  try to build a thing where you can tap into APIs. Like there are lots of

389
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:06,525
Speaker 4:  ways to interact with Spotify, not through Spotify, right? Yeah, yeah. Because

390
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:09,725
Speaker 4:  Spotify has open APIs for this stuff and you can plug in and they do a good

391
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:13,085
Speaker 4:  job of the authentication tokens. Rabbit is explicitly going a different

392
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:13,565
Speaker 4:  direction.

393
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:17,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So Spotify's a good example because it, it's a very simple, you

394
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:21,405
Speaker 2:  could put the Spotify API on this device, run it right locally.

395
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,765
Speaker 4:  Spotify will happily let you do this thing that is

396
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:26,645
Speaker 2:  Describing, here's a next computer, it's going ping Spotify and Stream. Right.

397
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:27,445
Speaker 2:  May and maybe that's what they're doing.

398
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:28,685
Speaker 4:  Every smart speaker, is that

399
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:32,725
Speaker 2:  Right? And they're cheap. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You go to the second most

400
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,885
Speaker 2:  complicated example and like I said, I'm just running this down the way that

401
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:37,965
Speaker 2:  we ran down Humane, because obviously Humane is a thing that people are gonna

402
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:41,325
Speaker 2:  compare this to Humane, by the way, which laid off 4% of its staff this week.

403
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:45,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And tried to play some games with Alex Heath when he broke that

404
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:47,885
Speaker 2:  story. Pretty shady. Humane anyway. Not

405
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:48,045
Speaker 4:  Great.

406
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:51,765
Speaker 2:  Not great. So the other example

407
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:56,085
Speaker 2:  was booking a flight. Yep. Which is easily the most complicated

408
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:59,325
Speaker 2:  thing you can do with computer. Yes. And when I talk about hostile interfaces

409
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:03,365
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. Which the interfaces to book a flight are openly hostile to you.

410
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,645
Speaker 2:  Like all over the place all the time. Prices are changing, it's unclear

411
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:11,325
Speaker 2:  what you're buying. The door might fall off the plane. It's just a real,

412
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:15,565
Speaker 2:  the hard time in air travel, this thing has to go. You say like, book

413
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:19,365
Speaker 2:  me a flight to Seattle. This thing has to go find

414
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:22,765
Speaker 2:  a website to do that on. Then it

415
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:25,965
Speaker 4:  Has to, it has to understand a vast amount about your preferences and what

416
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:28,885
Speaker 4:  you want and what you fly and what seats, like the amount it have to know

417
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:31,805
Speaker 4:  about you before it even starts the rest of this process. Right. Is really

418
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:32,045
Speaker 4:  complicated.

419
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,845
Speaker 2:  If you are a United person and I'm a Delta person and you are American. American,

420
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:36,965
Speaker 2:  yeah. It's rough.

421
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:43,685
Speaker 2:  And that's three entirely different websites for the large action model

422
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:48,325
Speaker 2:  to understand and be able to navigate. And then it has to condense those

423
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:52,445
Speaker 2:  into a coherent response that works on the interface

424
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:56,245
Speaker 2:  of the Rabbit. Yeah. And the airlines by the way, hate this and

425
00:22:56,245 --> 00:23:00,205
Speaker 2:  always have. Yes. Like they just don't want there to be a,

426
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:03,125
Speaker 2:  a layer of abstraction over their websites. They don't like it.

427
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:06,725
Speaker 2:  That's, and then, and then it has to actually do a good job of booking you

428
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:10,125
Speaker 2:  a flight. Right. And it has to have your credit card So I can pay

429
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:14,085
Speaker 5:  And your frequent flyer miles your like preferred seat area. Like

430
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:17,205
Speaker 5:  do you want first class? It's a lot that's gotta do. Yeah.

431
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:20,765
Speaker 2:  I don know. I like, I love this thing. I'm, it seems like we're gonna get

432
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:21,645
Speaker 2:  one soon. Yeah.

433
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:24,765
Speaker 4:  I think sooner rather than later we'll start to get a real idea of what this

434
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:25,325
Speaker 4:  thing actually is.

435
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:29,285
Speaker 2:  But I'm just like, if you just like run the examples, just how would you

436
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:31,165
Speaker 2:  do this? Yeah. Just step by step. You know, a funny way,

437
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:34,765
Speaker 4:  I would be more bullish on this thing if it was $400 than I am at

438
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:35,405
Speaker 4:  $200.

439
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:39,205
Speaker 2:  I'd be more bullish on it if it was $200 and it was 30 bucks a month. Yeah.

440
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:42,565
Speaker 2:  But at least I would understand. Okay. Like, I understand how this company

441
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,165
Speaker 2:  can persist. Yeah. The way it's structured now is like we make a big splash.

442
00:23:45,395 --> 00:23:47,685
Speaker 2:  There's a part of me who believes that they started this company, they got

443
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:50,685
Speaker 2:  all this interest, and then we're right. We're sitting right next to the

444
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:54,485
Speaker 2:  Google booth here at the Kia connected home. They're gonna sell it to Google

445
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,405
Speaker 2:  in a year. 'cause there's so much interest in ai and then Google will shut

446
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:58,445
Speaker 2:  it down in two years. This thing running

447
00:23:58,515 --> 00:23:59,965
Speaker 4:  Bard would be so much less exciting

448
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:04,965
Speaker 2:  Like that. I just don't, don don't understand the economics of this service.

449
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:07,685
Speaker 2:  but it is very exciting. It looks very cool. I understand people are excited

450
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:08,245
Speaker 2:  and it is

451
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:10,845
Speaker 4:  Like a whole thought about ai. Yeah. Which I appreciate. Yeah. Like they,

452
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:14,165
Speaker 4:  they, they built a thing that is like a full vision and I think that's cool.

453
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:14,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And

454
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:18,285
Speaker 2:  It is bringing some tech that we have seen in the enterprise context to consumers.

455
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:22,805
Speaker 2:  So, I have more, I think I have more faith that's It's not a hundred percent

456
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:25,205
Speaker 2:  faith, it's maybe 5% more faith than you Alex.

457
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:29,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Like the hardware is so, and the the, the

458
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:32,445
Speaker 5:  concept is so, so good execution. I'm just like,

459
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:33,445
Speaker 5:  no.

460
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:34,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

461
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:38,125
Speaker 5:  And I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I want it to work. I want this all to work.

462
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,885
Speaker 5:  I would love a $200, no additional fees, just

463
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:45,085
Speaker 5:  like does everything for me. That's magic. That sounds great. But that's

464
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:47,645
Speaker 5:  magic. And generally magic is not real. Yeah.

465
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:49,885
Speaker 2:  So, well I went to the sphere last night. Oh,

466
00:24:50,245 --> 00:24:50,885
Speaker 5:  Sorry. Sorry.

467
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:53,845
Speaker 2:  David. David and I went to the sphere.

468
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:59,285
Speaker 2:  Boy, I was just, I'm in love with the sphere. Yeah. We should

469
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,845
Speaker 2:  be a sphere in every town in America. We can

470
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:01,925
Speaker 5:  See it from here. It's beautiful.

471
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:05,165
Speaker 2:  It is. It it is better farther away than up close. Oh

472
00:25:05,265 --> 00:25:06,165
Speaker 4:  Yes. Oh absolutely.

473
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:10,245
Speaker 2:  And then even inside in the screen you can see lines and like,

474
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:11,485
Speaker 5:  You're

475
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:12,965
Speaker 2:  Like, eh, I was like, there's dead pics.

476
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:13,685
Speaker 5:  It's not imax.

477
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:18,685
Speaker 2:  And then also we did not see two we saw Yeah. Darren Aronofsky's postcard

478
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:22,565
Speaker 2:  from Earth, which is just the weirdest thing you can see if you are

479
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:22,925
Speaker 2:  sober.

480
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:24,725
Speaker 5:  Oh, you,

481
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:27,525
Speaker 2:  Oh there are people there who are not sober, who are like, yes.

482
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:30,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That feels like a shrooms event. Yeah.

483
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:34,045
Speaker 2:  That's real. Adam and Eve Rie. Yeah. Like at the end of it, like they get

484
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:37,525
Speaker 2:  off, I'm, I'm gonna spoil postcard from That's fine.

485
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:41,405
Speaker 2:  It's mostly a reason to show you like videos of elephants. It's gonna be

486
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:45,165
Speaker 2:  fine. At the end of it, they, the Adam and Eve get off their spaceship and

487
00:25:45,165 --> 00:25:48,845
Speaker 2:  the voices are like, you are here for a reason. The reason is

488
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:52,645
Speaker 2:  obviously to bang and populate the planet around. Like, it's like very

489
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:56,405
Speaker 2:  obvious. Get to it. What the reason is, it's good.

490
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:59,245
Speaker 2:  I I it's a love story. You should go to earth,

491
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:03,855
Speaker 2:  which humanity has left in this. Okay. Liam is telling me. Gotta wrap this

492
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:07,615
Speaker 2:  up. I love the sphere there. You know, like the water tower

493
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:10,735
Speaker 2:  in your town. If you're in a town in America with a water tower, go to your

494
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,135
Speaker 2:  local town meeting and be like, we should turn our water tower into a sphere.

495
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:16,135
Speaker 2:  Yes. Just a huge,

496
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,335
Speaker 4:  It's only gonna cost $2.3 billion

497
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:19,295
Speaker 2:  Probably.

498
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:20,735
Speaker 5:  Don't worry about hail. You'll be fine.

499
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:24,575
Speaker 2:  You gonna say it was not full last night? Oh it was

500
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:26,175
Speaker 2:  in fact mostly empty. Yeah.

501
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:26,495
Speaker 4:  Oh.

502
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,695
Speaker 2:  But it is that because people like, I was just like

503
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:33,855
Speaker 2:  magnetically drawn to the screen regardless of what was on the screen. I

504
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:37,615
Speaker 2:  would've been happy. Postcard from Earth I think is not drawn a crowd. No.

505
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:40,535
Speaker 2:  Anyhow. Alright, we gotta take a break. We're gonna come back. We're gonna

506
00:26:40,535 --> 00:26:43,845
Speaker 2:  talk about some gadgets. We talk about some standards. css, stay tuned at

507
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:44,805
Speaker 2:  The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

508
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:27,485
Speaker 1:  more details.

509
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:36,835
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Vergecast day two at css, the Kia connected home.

510
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:40,835
Speaker 2:  It's actually like CSS day four. It's just the second Vergecast. Yeah. I've

511
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:43,675
Speaker 2:  been doing this for 15 years and I still have no idea how to number any of

512
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:44,675
Speaker 2:  these things. No, yeah. We've

513
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:48,355
Speaker 4:  Been here for eight days. It's CES day three. Yeah. None of it makes any

514
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:48,555
Speaker 4:  sense.

515
00:27:48,955 --> 00:27:50,235
Speaker 5:  I spent the whole day thinking it was Friday.

516
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:53,915
Speaker 2:  The only thing that makes sense is the fear. David Giant.

517
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,675
Speaker 2:  Ridiculous.

518
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:59,315
Speaker 2:  When you walk into the sphere, we, oh my God.

519
00:28:00,985 --> 00:28:04,315
Speaker 2:  Like the lobby of the sphere is like bathed in blue light. There's like bad

520
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:07,955
Speaker 2:  robots talking about the future at you and you're like, oh, you just made

521
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:11,715
Speaker 2:  like a, like an Epcot center. Yeah. Like you went to the, the warehouse

522
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:13,955
Speaker 2:  of old Epcot technologies. Do

523
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,555
Speaker 5:  You ride on a little train and get to see like the cave thing?

524
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:18,355
Speaker 2:  No, they ran outta money well before that happened.

525
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:21,355
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's what the, the postcard from Earth is supposed to be, I guess.

526
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:25,715
Speaker 2:  Yeah, right. The spaceship Earth where you go up. Yeah. Right. No, there's

527
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:28,515
Speaker 2:  a definite vibe at the sphere where you're like, well this is where they

528
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:31,995
Speaker 2:  ran outta money. They built the screen and they're like, Hmm, this carpet

529
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,715
Speaker 5:  Just porta-potties everywhere.

530
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,555
Speaker 2:  If you are in Vegas, please, if you're listening to this and you ever come

531
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:41,315
Speaker 2:  to Vegas, you just go look at the screen. It's insane screen.

532
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:44,235
Speaker 2:  Don't look at postcard from Earth, I think is

533
00:28:44,235 --> 00:28:46,595
Speaker 4:  What I would say. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I think Phish is coming like

534
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:47,995
Speaker 4:  in April, go see Phish. That's,

535
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:49,555
Speaker 2:  That's the move that's appropriate. Yeah. Oh, that's

536
00:28:49,555 --> 00:28:49,795
Speaker 5:  Very good.

537
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:52,795
Speaker 2:  Actually speaking, we, we gotta talk about standards. There's a bunch of

538
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:56,435
Speaker 2:  standards news here at css, but speaking of just screen

539
00:28:57,355 --> 00:29:00,995
Speaker 2:  mishaps, you and I both saw Samsung, Bali demos,

540
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:02,075
Speaker 4:  Poor

541
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,355
Speaker 2:  Bali, and we saw different, had a tough week, different mishaps. What was

542
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:07,315
Speaker 2:  yours? Okay. From I first tell people at Bali, so

543
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:11,315
Speaker 4:  Bali is the sort of little rolling home

544
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:15,475
Speaker 4:  robot that Samsung is making. We saw it last year. Yeah. And we saw a new

545
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:19,235
Speaker 4:  version of it this year. And its new thing is basically it's a, it's a

546
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:21,595
Speaker 4:  robot assistant projector. Yeah. So

547
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,235
Speaker 2:  It like, so last year had no projector, right?

548
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:27,075
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay. And this year the demo is actually sort of convincing.

549
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:29,635
Speaker 4:  It's like this little thing that will follow you around and you're like,

550
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:32,235
Speaker 4:  oh, I'm doing a workout and it'll project your workout on the wall. And then

551
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:34,595
Speaker 4:  he went to do sit ups and so it started projecting on the ceiling the, the

552
00:29:34,595 --> 00:29:37,355
Speaker 4:  workout on the ceiling. And I was like, that's awesome. And it's, it can

553
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:39,875
Speaker 4:  make calls for you. It knows your schedule. It's just like, it's a little

554
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:43,605
Speaker 4:  adorable smart speaker that just kind of like ambles around your house. Like

555
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:47,325
Speaker 4:  I'm into it. I look. Yeah. The demo I saw. So they were doing these as

556
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:50,045
Speaker 4:  shows like once an hour? Yeah. It was like Bali will appear

557
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:55,045
Speaker 4:  and Bali comes out. They do the first half of the demo, it's going fine.

558
00:29:55,385 --> 00:29:59,085
Speaker 4:  And then Bali is supposed to, I believe the first time

559
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:02,365
Speaker 4:  it went wrong, Bali was supposed to make a phone call. And what Bali is supposed

560
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:06,165
Speaker 4:  to do is project the phone call like up on the wall so you can see who you're

561
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:09,925
Speaker 4:  talking to, whatever Bali projected it upside down

562
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:13,725
Speaker 4:  and about three inches off the ground. So all you could see was the word

563
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:17,765
Speaker 4:  like flower shop upside down on the wall.

564
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:22,005
Speaker 4:  And then Bali went around to try and, you know, help him see his calendar

565
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:25,725
Speaker 4:  upside down and teeny tiny. And then for the last part of the demo,

566
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,725
Speaker 4:  rolls it back over to the wall. And the guy's like, oh, show me what's in

567
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:33,005
Speaker 4:  my fridge. So I can decide what to make. Leaving aside that his fridge is

568
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:33,565
Speaker 4:  literally white,

569
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,365
Speaker 2:  He was standing in front of the, the fridge

570
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:37,205
Speaker 4:  Next to him. Yeah. Like he could've reached out with his left hand and opened

571
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:41,165
Speaker 4:  the fridge and said, he's like, Bali, what's inside the fridge? Bali projects.

572
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:42,245
Speaker 4:  Nothing on the wall.

573
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:43,405
Speaker 2:  Just

574
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:47,165
Speaker 4:  Nothing. And this poor guy who clearly has a script to follow stands there

575
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:48,885
Speaker 4:  and he goes, Hmm, So, I have some apples.

576
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:54,125
Speaker 4:  And and that was the moment that like the panic level among all the Samsung

577
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:57,205
Speaker 4:  employees just started to display. And the demo ended very quickly after

578
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:57,565
Speaker 4:  that. Yeah.

579
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:01,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's over. I saw the same Bali show.

580
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:06,205
Speaker 2:  I thought the call the flower shop demo was very funny. It just, in the same

581
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:09,765
Speaker 2:  way we were talking about the Rabbit, he's like, what's on my calendar? And

582
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:12,645
Speaker 2:  Bali was, show's a calendar. It's like, it's your anniversary. And he is

583
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:16,045
Speaker 2:  like, okay, call the flower shop. And he just says, call the flower shop

584
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:20,125
Speaker 2:  you. And if you've ever done a search in your life, you know Yeah. That is

585
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,725
Speaker 2:  not a thing you can just instruct any assistant to do. There's not

586
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:25,165
Speaker 4:  A thing on Google Maps called the flower shop. Yeah.

587
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:29,205
Speaker 2:  It's like 10,000 sponsored listings later. And

588
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:32,485
Speaker 2:  he calls the flower shop, he makes a phone and like this is, you know, it's,

589
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:35,085
Speaker 2:  yeah, it's a demo. It's fake, but whatever. But he is like, I need a dozen

590
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:38,765
Speaker 2:  roses. And like, come in Right your way and hang up. Oh. I was like, that's

591
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:42,285
Speaker 2:  not how that works. No. At all. And then he's like, I'm gonna make dinner.

592
00:31:42,385 --> 00:31:46,365
Speaker 2:  He does the apple thing. And then in mine, the mishap was he went to go watch

593
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:49,125
Speaker 2:  a cooking video and Bali was supposed to, oh, I didn't even

594
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:49,525
Speaker 4:  Get that far.

595
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:53,605
Speaker 2:  He shut yours down Mine. He was like, I'm gonna do some cooking.

596
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:57,565
Speaker 2:  And they, it was supposed to project it above the kitchen sink,

597
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:01,685
Speaker 2:  but Bali missed and presented it teeny tiny in the side of the cabinet

598
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:04,925
Speaker 2:  and it just kept going as though that wasn't happening. Just keep,

599
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:07,005
Speaker 5:  Like looking down, double checking all your, your

600
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:09,765
Speaker 2:  Instructions. It was very, it's very good. I love the idea of boli. I think

601
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:13,365
Speaker 2:  it's, it's, it would be very fun. Yeah. To have a little projector that follows

602
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,485
Speaker 2:  you around showing you things. Yeah. My

603
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:17,205
Speaker 4:  Favorite thing about it was every time he would ask it a question, it would

604
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:21,005
Speaker 4:  project little arrows on the ground. Yeah. As telling you like, follow me

605
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,965
Speaker 4:  over to this wall. So I can show you. And it was great. And he's just like

606
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:27,045
Speaker 4:  chasing this little ball around the living room. The whole, it was so

607
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,325
Speaker 2:  Good. There's a real, the workout demo. Yeah. Did this happen?

608
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:34,405
Speaker 2:  It sounds like your demo was much higher stakes than mine. Mine mostly went

609
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:37,445
Speaker 2:  fine. The workout demo is like, it's time for my workout and he is like stretching

610
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,405
Speaker 2:  and he's standing in front of a television. Yeah. And, and said Bali rolled

611
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:45,205
Speaker 2:  to the left of the television, projected the workout video on the wall next

612
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:48,805
Speaker 2:  to tv, which everyone has just a wide blank wall next to tv. Yeah, same.

613
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:52,725
Speaker 2:  And then just insisted on making us watch Meghan Trainor video on the

614
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:56,165
Speaker 2:  television. So I think this isn't what I want at all.

615
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:01,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I don't want this experience. Yeah. It's very good. All right. So that's

616
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:05,205
Speaker 2:  Bali. It was good. It's cute. Yeah, it's cute.

617
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:09,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right. We should talk about some, some standards. So lots of smart

618
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:13,245
Speaker 2:  home stuff happening at css. Eating toilets, you know,

619
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:16,285
Speaker 2:  clumsy projector, robots, what have you.

620
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:21,205
Speaker 2:  Let's start with just some smart home stuff. So Jen Tuy is here, our smart

621
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:25,245
Speaker 2:  home reviewer. She's killing it as always. Yep. Basic stuff.

622
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:29,165
Speaker 2:  So matter and Thread are always a big deal. It's css. We're into what year?

623
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:33,085
Speaker 2:  35 of trying to make matter or thing. It's gonna happen this year, this

624
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:33,445
Speaker 5:  Year's for

625
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,925
Speaker 2:  Sure. The big news around matter is that

626
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:40,645
Speaker 2:  Matter is supposed to work with a wireless standard called Thread.

627
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:45,285
Speaker 2:  Thread is built into all kinds of things. Now the iPhone 15 Pro has

628
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:49,005
Speaker 2:  a Thread radio in it for totally mysterious reasons. But the Apple TV has

629
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:52,765
Speaker 2:  it, nest tubs have it. The issue is that Thread is

630
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,885
Speaker 2:  supposed to form a low power mesh network in your house.

631
00:33:57,425 --> 00:34:01,125
Speaker 2:  So you get an Apple tv, you've got a Thread device, you get a Nest Hub, you

632
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:05,005
Speaker 2:  get an arrow. They all sort of form one pretty good resilient

633
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:09,125
Speaker 2:  Thread network. And up until yesterday

634
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:13,565
Speaker 2:  the specification did not allow that to happen. Right? Yes. So instead they

635
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:16,725
Speaker 2:  would all create their competing little networks. Yeah. Yeah. And you would

636
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:19,325
Speaker 2:  have like this fight, like my Arrow has a different Thread network running

637
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:22,445
Speaker 2:  in my house Right. Than my Apple tv. And I just shut the Thread radios off

638
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:25,605
Speaker 2:  my arrow. 'cause this is useless. Yeah. That is bad because there's more

639
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:28,205
Speaker 2:  arrows in my house than Apple TVs.

640
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:33,485
Speaker 2:  And so they should, that should just be the good network. Right. But you

641
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:36,565
Speaker 2:  can't pass the credential. It's like all just a mess. So the news here at

642
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:40,565
Speaker 2:  TSS is that Thread, the Thread group, which definitely

643
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:42,805
Speaker 2:  sounds like a consulting company that Jason born works for.

644
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:48,245
Speaker 2:  They've, they've murdered a number of high value targets and they've also

645
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:53,085
Speaker 2:  released a specification that lets all of those devices pass

646
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:56,005
Speaker 2:  credentials to one another. Which Jen specifically has been saying is the

647
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:59,045
Speaker 2:  thing that needs to happen. Yeah. Nothing has shipped with it yet. It's a

648
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:01,725
Speaker 2:  software update. They've all gotta do it. But this is some like baseline

649
00:35:01,915 --> 00:35:04,805
Speaker 2:  spec news at CSS that I think is very important. 'cause it's gonna get you

650
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:08,605
Speaker 2:  to the place where you, in your house, you have a wifi network for high

651
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,645
Speaker 2:  power usage, high data usage, and a Thread network

652
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:16,605
Speaker 2:  for smart locks and light switches. We'll see.

653
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:20,565
Speaker 5:  Fingers crossed. As someone who relies on a Thread network.

654
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:21,805
Speaker 2:  What's the other Thread Network Fingers?

655
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:26,405
Speaker 5:  The light for the entryway. So I can climb up the stairs at night. Whoa.

656
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:28,485
Speaker 5:  At my apartment, I like to be able to see.

657
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:30,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it seems reasonable. Yeah.

658
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:32,085
Speaker 5:  Sometimes it doesn't work. And I'm like, okay,

659
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:35,645
Speaker 2:  Cool. I've got the Schlagg door locks on the Thread network with the Apple

660
00:35:35,705 --> 00:35:39,405
Speaker 2:  tv. Yeah. don don't know why. Yeah. I just like knowing it's on a

661
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:42,165
Speaker 2:  different network than the wifi feels. Yeah. Like these batteries last 30%

662
00:35:42,165 --> 00:35:46,085
Speaker 2:  longer. Nailed it. These were more expensive than the other smart robot.

663
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:50,885
Speaker 2:  Then there's a bunch of just sort of like basic stuff standards wise as it

664
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:54,805
Speaker 2:  comes to smart homes. So with Matter, matter is extending, it's

665
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:58,765
Speaker 2:  gonna do robot vacuums this year. It just keeps getting bigger.

666
00:35:58,785 --> 00:36:02,605
Speaker 2:  Yes. And then Deere Suite, Amazon announced that instead of

667
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:05,765
Speaker 2:  using Chromecast or Airplay, it will now support

668
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:10,485
Speaker 2:  casting content from Prime Video with Matter,

669
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:13,325
Speaker 2:  which no one else supports it. It's

670
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:17,165
Speaker 4:  One of those things that it's like if we had all decided to do this a long

671
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:21,125
Speaker 4:  time ago, yeah. The world would be a better place. Yeah. Like this, it

672
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,725
Speaker 4:  is patently absurd that you have 11 different

673
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:27,965
Speaker 4:  technologies just to send a thing from your phone to your television. Yeah.

674
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:32,205
Speaker 4:  But like the, we're out on that one. Yeah. And so now we're in the like,

675
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:32,405
Speaker 4:  it's

676
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:35,285
Speaker 2:  Like people are like, Dora keyboards are better than K. And it's like, that's

677
00:36:35,285 --> 00:36:35,685
Speaker 2:  great for you.

678
00:36:35,685 --> 00:36:37,725
Speaker 4:  It's irrelevant. Yeah. Yeah. I don't care anymore. That's

679
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:39,765
Speaker 2:  Cool. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. We should put the accelerator on the left.

680
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:43,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. don don't know. Maybe. Maybe we should have done that in 1915.

681
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:44,965
Speaker 2:  Right. But we didn't. Yeah,

682
00:36:45,515 --> 00:36:49,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah, exactly. And so now you have yet another way to send Prime

683
00:36:49,255 --> 00:36:52,525
Speaker 4:  video to things. Yeah. Which I'm sure tons of people do all

684
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,165
Speaker 2:  The time. Right. So Amazon makes its own TVs.

685
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:54,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

686
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:56,205
Speaker 2:  They can insist on it.

687
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:58,685
Speaker 5:  Really popular set top box too.

688
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:00,365
Speaker 2:  Really? Yeah. The Fire TV is popular. Like

689
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:04,045
Speaker 5:  I wanna joke about this thing a lot. But also Amazon's like right behind

690
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:08,205
Speaker 5:  Roku with one of the most popular. Yeah. Like set top situations.

691
00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:08,685
Speaker 5:  So

692
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:13,245
Speaker 2:  I excited for Andy Jassy to have a meeting with Tim Cook where he is like,

693
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:17,925
Speaker 2:  we'd love for you to support Matter casting and the iOS So

694
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:19,685
Speaker 2:  I don't think that's gonna happen. I just

695
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:21,125
Speaker 5:  Assume he'll close his laptop.

696
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:25,245
Speaker 2:  Tim Cook just nope. Puts on his Vision Pro. He's like, I am on the top

697
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:26,485
Speaker 2:  of a volcano now, sir.

698
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,885
Speaker 4:  He just puts on the screensaver thing on the outside.

699
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,285
Speaker 2:  It's like, I'm done. This

700
00:37:30,285 --> 00:37:31,005
Speaker 4:  Meeting's over just,

701
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:33,005
Speaker 2:  Just looking at Tim Cook's dead

702
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:34,485
Speaker 4:  Virtual eyes while

703
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,405
Speaker 2:  He just disassociate from this conversation. That's

704
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:37,965
Speaker 5:  Exactly what's

705
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:41,605
Speaker 2:  Gonna happen. That sounds about right. So similar note, LG is

706
00:37:41,605 --> 00:37:45,565
Speaker 2:  supporting Google Cast. This is a big announcement. Samsung is not,

707
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,725
Speaker 2:  this is very good. This the

708
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:51,285
Speaker 4:  Silliest thing. Yeah. Like so Google has

709
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:55,245
Speaker 4:  nearby share. I'm like, there's a 100% chance I'm gonna get all these names

710
00:37:55,245 --> 00:37:59,205
Speaker 4:  wrong. Google has nearby share, Samsung has quick share. Google is

711
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:02,765
Speaker 4:  now renaming nearby Share to Quick Share and just giving it to Samsung. Yeah.

712
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:04,005
Speaker 2:  They're just gonna put 'em together.

713
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:06,845
Speaker 4:  And then LG is just off to the side being like, we don't have any of this

714
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:07,725
Speaker 4:  anymore. Yeah.

715
00:38:08,305 --> 00:38:11,565
Speaker 2:  We don't make phones, but we're gonna use Google Cast and I, our TVs Samsung

716
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:14,405
Speaker 2:  is like, we're partnering with Google on Quick Share, but we're not gonna

717
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:18,285
Speaker 2:  put Google cast on. It's just a mess. Like this whole thing is a mess.

718
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:22,245
Speaker 2:  Which is why basically Airplay two continues to

719
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,405
Speaker 2:  be the thing that people like gravitate to. And then Google Cast is

720
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:30,045
Speaker 2:  a thing that on Android thing, people gravitate to. Yep. Except for Amazon

721
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:33,285
Speaker 2:  Prime video. And then lastly, just on, on Smart Home

722
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:37,285
Speaker 2:  gadgets. We still live in a world of hubs and bridges. They're

723
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:40,565
Speaker 2:  inescapable, but the thing that's happening is they're all kind of

724
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:45,005
Speaker 2:  converging. And you, the idea that you'll have just one kind of main Hub,

725
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:45,845
Speaker 5:  Thank God

726
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:49,845
Speaker 2:  In your house, it's not quite there yet. But Aqara, which is sort of an

727
00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:53,605
Speaker 2:  upstart smart home company. I've got Aqara, a Smart lock as in

728
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:57,685
Speaker 2:  addition to my, my Sage. Super expensive Thread ones

729
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:01,045
Speaker 2:  for no reason. They're very good. They go on sale every

730
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,045
Speaker 2:  constantly

731
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:03,645
Speaker 5:  On sale. Are you They're motion sensors. They're great.

732
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:06,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And they're a really interesting company. They've got an interesting

733
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:09,845
Speaker 2:  proximity sensor, but they've got a new Hub. The Hub M three. We've been

734
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:13,805
Speaker 2:  talking about it for a year or more. It's a ZigBee Hub. So

735
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:17,405
Speaker 2:  for all of Aqara ZigBee devices, it's also a Thread border router. And it

736
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:21,045
Speaker 2:  is a matter controller if you wanna be a matter thing. So this is the thing

737
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:24,925
Speaker 2:  that should be able to control like queue lights and eve shades

738
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,485
Speaker 2:  and work with your Nest thermostat and

739
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:31,045
Speaker 5:  Not require you to use Home Assistant. 'cause Home Assistant has a similar

740
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:35,045
Speaker 5:  Hub, but it requires you to use home assistant. And a lot of

741
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:36,085
Speaker 5:  people aren't as nerdy as

742
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:38,285
Speaker 2:  Myself. A lot of home assistant stands are about to get real mad at you.

743
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:38,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

744
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:42,525
Speaker 5:  I mean I, I'm one of you. I, I use home assistant. I I love it. I have the

745
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:45,765
Speaker 5:  home assistant yellow, but like a lot of people don't want that.

746
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:47,805
Speaker 5:  Something a little more turnkey. This is

747
00:39:47,945 --> 00:39:50,525
Speaker 4:  Non sick hacker version. Yeah.

748
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:54,365
Speaker 2:  If It works, if it It works, I just wanna point out threat didn matter. Like

749
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:57,765
Speaker 2:  every year at TSS we track like, okay, there's a bunch of smart home products.

750
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:02,205
Speaker 2:  These standards are growing, the big companies are still all

751
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:04,725
Speaker 2:  over the place with things like as simple as like I'm watching a video on

752
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:08,685
Speaker 2:  my phone, I want on tv still a mess. Right? Like still fundamentally

753
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:12,605
Speaker 2:  a mess. Unless you are pretty firmly in the Apple ecosystem, which is Apple's

754
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:16,125
Speaker 2:  argument. Right. To be fair, this is app like stay in this prison

755
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:20,405
Speaker 2:  and we will care for you three hots of caught and consistent,

756
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:23,565
Speaker 2:  reliable video casting. That's the Apple way,

757
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:27,605
Speaker 2:  but it's getting better. And some of these products are interesting. Okay.

758
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:31,125
Speaker 2:  So that's the smart home stuff. You wanna talk about wifi seven? Or actually

759
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:31,845
Speaker 2:  you wanna talk about atsc?

760
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:33,965
Speaker 5:  I'll talk about ATSC 3.0 forever.

761
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:38,165
Speaker 2:  This is, I mean, this is Alex's baby. Yeah. You saw a pretty cool demo. Yeah,

762
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:41,805
Speaker 5:  I saw a really cool demo. A TSC 3.0 famously came out many, many years ago

763
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:46,085
Speaker 5:  and nothing happened because no one wanted to spend the money

764
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:50,005
Speaker 5:  to upgrade all of their broadcast towers to a TSC 3.0

765
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:53,725
Speaker 5:  because it's expensive. And all you would get was like slightly higher quality.

766
00:40:54,305 --> 00:40:58,045
Speaker 5:  And they're like, well, why would I wanna do that? That's dumb. Yeah. And

767
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:01,965
Speaker 5:  so this company Roxy thinks it's figured out a way, which is

768
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:02,685
Speaker 5:  that it's

769
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:03,725
Speaker 2:  Roxy with an I by the

770
00:41:03,725 --> 00:41:05,285
Speaker 5:  Way. Yeah. It's Roxy with an I. Very important,

771
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:06,005
Speaker 2:  Very important.

772
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:10,285
Speaker 5:  ROXI. So it's, it's good. Yeah. They also do like a music app. And

773
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:13,405
Speaker 5:  so they're bringing that music app as a channel. And so right now, as we're

774
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:17,205
Speaker 5:  recording, if you're in Vegas and you happen to have an A TSC 3.0

775
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:18,605
Speaker 5:  tuner on your tv,

776
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:19,325
Speaker 4:  You almost certainly don't,

777
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:24,405
Speaker 5:  You could if you recently bought an lg, but not this year's, just last year.

778
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,885
Speaker 4:  Right. If you're one of three people in Vegas, to whom this applies,

779
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:30,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You can go and you can, you can watch this channel and, and then you

780
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:34,525
Speaker 5:  can pause the music on the channel. You can skip tracks, you can choose other

781
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:38,445
Speaker 5:  like stations within the channel itself, all in the channel,

782
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:42,645
Speaker 5:  all broadcast. And I was like, okay, well do you need wifi? And they

783
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:46,205
Speaker 5:  said wifi will like increase the quality, the visual quality. But otherwise,

784
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:48,965
Speaker 5:  like the interactivity, no, You don't need it. Really. It's all broadcast.

785
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:49,525
Speaker 5:  So I. Like

786
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:51,085
Speaker 2:  That was just not how I'd expect that to work. Yeah.

787
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:54,125
Speaker 5:  And I was like, oh, cool. They're, they're claiming that they basically put,

788
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:58,085
Speaker 5:  they called it a transitory app, just a little tiny app

789
00:41:58,085 --> 00:42:01,925
Speaker 5:  that goes onto the TV and operates on the TV while you're on the

790
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:05,085
Speaker 5:  channel. And then it, it leaves the short term memory once you leave the

791
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:05,205
Speaker 5:  channel.

792
00:42:05,865 --> 00:42:09,725
Speaker 2:  So at 3.0 increases the bandwidth. Yeah. It's a digital signal spec inside

793
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:12,005
Speaker 2:  the digital signal. The spec has the storage in there. They can send you

794
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:15,765
Speaker 2:  the bits to run a little baby app. Yeah. That's pretty neat. How does it

795
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:18,645
Speaker 2:  send a signal back to the TV station if you wanna like buy So like

796
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:20,885
Speaker 5:  It, so they're, they're having to use AWS they're going through servers.

797
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,765
Speaker 5:  So, so that all is happening. And the money side of it was

798
00:42:24,765 --> 00:42:28,245
Speaker 5:  my other question there. They figured out instead of using broadcast ads,

799
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:32,165
Speaker 5:  which I guess don't make as much money, they can use streaming TV ads. Okay.

800
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:35,445
Speaker 5:  So, so they can use a more lucrative ad on it. And they're partnering with

801
00:42:35,445 --> 00:42:39,325
Speaker 5:  Sinclair who has like 40% of broadcast standard. Like they own

802
00:42:39,455 --> 00:42:43,005
Speaker 5:  40% of broadcast stations in the United States they can't own anymore because

803
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:47,405
Speaker 5:  then they'd be a monopoly. So that's the only reason they haven't

804
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:51,325
Speaker 5:  purchased more. They're partnering with it, they're super excited about

805
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:55,245
Speaker 5:  it and they're insisting that it's gonna be on all, in

806
00:42:55,245 --> 00:42:59,045
Speaker 5:  every market that has a TSC 3.0 Wow. By the end of

807
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:02,725
Speaker 5:  this quarter. Wow. I'm really curious about that. Because there's a 60% of

808
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:06,485
Speaker 5:  markets that don't, that aren't completely owned by Sinclair. So, but

809
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:10,165
Speaker 5:  they're like, no, no, no, we got this. So the guy was like very, very emphatic

810
00:43:10,165 --> 00:43:13,925
Speaker 5:  about that. So we'll see if that actually happens. But like,

811
00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:17,165
Speaker 5:  this is cool. I would love to be able to, you know, you could think about

812
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:20,325
Speaker 5:  it like Max could theoretically not your child, but

813
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:25,245
Speaker 2:  Because I mean I love her dearly and every now and again, I regret naming

814
00:43:25,245 --> 00:43:26,165
Speaker 2:  her Max, but go ahead.

815
00:43:26,195 --> 00:43:29,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. She could become a new broadcast channel, but like theoretically

816
00:43:29,545 --> 00:43:33,165
Speaker 5:  Max could like be on this, their, their examples were QVC or something like

817
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:34,405
Speaker 5:  that. Of course. Like yeah, you could,

818
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:36,325
Speaker 2:  There's always, there's always transactions buy stuff.

819
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:40,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Transaction, buy stuff, choose the weather, skip skip to your, your

820
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:44,005
Speaker 5:  actual weather on the station while still watching the news, that sort of

821
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:47,845
Speaker 5:  thing. So, so like this has been a promise for a very long time and

822
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:51,525
Speaker 5:  nobody's actually like shipped it. And so that's why this is really, really

823
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:52,245
Speaker 5:  exciting. So

824
00:43:52,245 --> 00:43:54,165
Speaker 2:  This is like over-the-Air Interactive television

825
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,365
Speaker 5:  Over-the-Air Interactive television.

826
00:43:55,505 --> 00:43:56,245
Speaker 2:  No internet required.

827
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:58,885
Speaker 5:  No internet required. And that's I think super crucial because there's so

828
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:02,765
Speaker 5:  many people in the United States who don't have easy, cheap access to internet.

829
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So like, they don't get to go watch all the cool stuff we get to watch.

830
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:10,165
Speaker 5:  And this would theoretically, if everybody adopted it would

831
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:11,005
Speaker 5:  give them more opportunities.

832
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:15,045
Speaker 4:  It is super cool. I think all of the interactive stuff though, I wonder about

833
00:44:15,045 --> 00:44:19,005
Speaker 4:  because like on the streaming side of it, there's

834
00:44:19,005 --> 00:44:22,965
Speaker 4:  no reason that hasn't been possible for forever. Yeah. And still

835
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:26,245
Speaker 4:  nobody has to, like, Amazon cannot figure out how to do a good job of letting

836
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:30,045
Speaker 4:  you be like, I would like to buy the chips in this ad. Please. Yeah. Like,

837
00:44:30,265 --> 00:44:33,565
Speaker 4:  you're showing me a commercial for Fritos, please allow me to buy these Fritos.

838
00:44:33,825 --> 00:44:37,565
Speaker 4:  Amazon doesn't know how to do that yet. And so the idea that they're all

839
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:38,525
Speaker 4:  gonna figure this out on,

840
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:41,325
Speaker 2:  They're doing that with Prime video. They're getting there. They're

841
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:42,445
Speaker 5:  Getting slowly.

842
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:43,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

843
00:44:43,205 --> 00:44:46,565
Speaker 5:  I I, I suspect that one. Like, like, but this is my point right now. It's

844
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:50,085
Speaker 5:  just gonna be this Roxy Mu music app. That's all we're gonnas or the Roxy

845
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:54,005
Speaker 5:  Music Channel. That's all we're we're gonna see. You

846
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:56,845
Speaker 5:  know, maybe they could work with QVC and QVC and them could put their heads

847
00:44:57,005 --> 00:44:58,205
Speaker 5:  together and, and, and figure this out.

848
00:44:58,235 --> 00:45:01,845
Speaker 2:  Okay. But here's my question. Yeah. It's, it's always QVC. It's always shopping,

849
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:02,685
Speaker 5:  It's always QVC. Right.

850
00:45:02,685 --> 00:45:06,325
Speaker 2:  The other thing you do with at T three Bruno is improve the picture quality.

851
00:45:06,595 --> 00:45:06,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

852
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,085
Speaker 4:  Well and that's the part I think is exciting.

853
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:09,445
Speaker 2:  Please someone

854
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:09,805
Speaker 4:  Improve

855
00:45:09,805 --> 00:45:09,885
Speaker 2:  The,

856
00:45:10,025 --> 00:45:12,525
Speaker 4:  To your point about the broadband stuff, the idea that just a, you're gonna

857
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:15,925
Speaker 4:  be able to send what amounts to streaming services over broadband

858
00:45:16,345 --> 00:45:18,405
Speaker 4:  is really exciting for all the reasons we're talking about. Broadcast over

859
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:22,045
Speaker 4:  broadcast, sorry. Yeah. Is super exciting. And then also the fact that the

860
00:45:22,045 --> 00:45:25,405
Speaker 4:  picture quality could be better. But I just wonder if any of the stakeholders

861
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:29,445
Speaker 4:  involved in this care enough about ATSC three anymore to pick this fight.

862
00:45:29,595 --> 00:45:31,765
Speaker 4:  It's like the matter casting. Like we should have done this a decade ago

863
00:45:31,765 --> 00:45:32,565
Speaker 4:  and everything would be better.

864
00:45:32,685 --> 00:45:36,165
Speaker 5:  Sinclair needs it. Like if Sinclair doesn't figure this out. Yeah.

865
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:40,605
Speaker 5:  Broad. Like they're done, you know, 10 years from now broadcast TV is

866
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,765
Speaker 5:  dead. Like last year we, we did a lot of reporting about how people were

867
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:47,565
Speaker 5:  watching less broadcast tv. Right. So I, it's, it's on its last legs. It

868
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:51,485
Speaker 5:  needs something. And if this can, can get those companies and a lot of

869
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:54,205
Speaker 5:  these streaming companies own broadcast networks. Right? Like, like a, B,

870
00:45:54,205 --> 00:45:58,085
Speaker 5:  C True. Or Disney does. Yeah. Paramount does. I think believe Max owns a

871
00:45:58,085 --> 00:46:01,845
Speaker 5:  lot of cable channels. Like there is certainly opportunity for these people

872
00:46:01,985 --> 00:46:04,325
Speaker 5:  and the fact that this company is figured out Yeah, just tech,

873
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:07,165
Speaker 2:  This is lucrative spectrum. Yeah. You should be able to do something good

874
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:10,645
Speaker 2:  with it, right? Yeah. Ideally you increase the picture quality and stop broadcasting

875
00:46:10,765 --> 00:46:11,165
Speaker 2:  football in seven.

876
00:46:11,165 --> 00:46:12,005
Speaker 5:  Instead you're gonna buy.

877
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:16,245
Speaker 2:  But instead we're doing Qvs. Yeah. It's great. Alright, let's talk about

878
00:46:16,245 --> 00:46:19,245
Speaker 2:  some other standards. By the way, you should go watch just the Glee on Alex's

879
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:23,125
Speaker 2:  face. That's the Best's a video. Just watch the video. The way that

880
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,565
Speaker 2:  I felt at the sphere, Alex felt demoing ATTs three

881
00:46:28,105 --> 00:46:30,925
Speaker 5:  On our activity. I had such stopped to watch 'cause I think I was just that

882
00:46:30,925 --> 00:46:32,605
Speaker 5:  excited. Yeah. People are like coming

883
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:35,285
Speaker 2:  Into a bit later today. I'm gonna go look at some party speakers. Yeah. And

884
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:37,325
Speaker 2:  I feel like I'm gonna be the most excited person to go through the party

885
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:38,165
Speaker 2:  speaker tour. They're gonna

886
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:41,685
Speaker 5:  Just join you. People are just gonna follow you, feel your enthusiasm.

887
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:42,445
Speaker 2:  And they're like, why?

888
00:46:44,675 --> 00:46:48,365
Speaker 2:  Just some other quick standards to talk about Q2. That's the magnetic

889
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:52,725
Speaker 2:  wireless standard. That is basically mag safe. It's here. There's some

890
00:46:52,725 --> 00:46:53,245
Speaker 2:  products.

891
00:46:53,995 --> 00:46:57,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there's a lot of it. It's, it's the good news is less about like a

892
00:46:57,365 --> 00:47:00,205
Speaker 4:  specific product and more about, it just feels like everybody has decided

893
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:03,005
Speaker 4:  to embrace QE two, which is awesome. Yeah. And it's gonna be good.

894
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:04,325
Speaker 2:  Including Apple, which is like the big one,

895
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:07,005
Speaker 4:  Right? Including Apple. Like we're gonna start to see a lot of Android phones

896
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:09,845
Speaker 4:  with it this year everybody thinks that new Pixel is gonna have it. Like

897
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:13,805
Speaker 4:  the, the momentum on this is super real and happening

898
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:16,605
Speaker 4:  fast to the point where I think like, and we've talked a lot on this show

899
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:20,245
Speaker 4:  about how cool it will be when we have a bunch of unified systems for

900
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:23,205
Speaker 4:  accessories. Yeah. And we're getting it with USBC. We're getting it with

901
00:47:23,325 --> 00:47:25,485
Speaker 4:  Q2. Like it's, it's gonna be good things. Yeah.

902
00:47:25,485 --> 00:47:29,205
Speaker 2:  So we've got some photos of docs from Satechi and other companies. There's

903
00:47:29,285 --> 00:47:32,525
Speaker 2:  a Belkin thing that works with Apple's new DO kit. Yeah.

904
00:47:32,665 --> 00:47:34,725
Speaker 4:  And So I absolutely forgot Doc Kit was a thing.

905
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:38,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I know. Apple is like, we made an accessory standard and you're so

906
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:41,725
Speaker 2:  used to being like, and that'll be, yeah. One company will try it, but now

907
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:45,445
Speaker 2:  because of USBC and G two companies are free to try it. It's like

908
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:49,245
Speaker 2:  less costly in a way. Yeah. So Belkin made a doc,

909
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:53,325
Speaker 2:  a camera doc, you put it on it and Doc hit Motorize is

910
00:47:53,325 --> 00:47:56,565
Speaker 2:  the doc while you're in FaceTime mode. So it like follow you around

911
00:47:57,245 --> 00:47:59,965
Speaker 2:  I don dunno if that's cool. I think it's cool that it, the people made a

912
00:47:59,965 --> 00:48:00,725
Speaker 2:  thing. Yeah. Yeah.

913
00:48:00,755 --> 00:48:01,645
Speaker 5:  That part's really cool.

914
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,005
Speaker 2:  Is this funny thing that's David is,

915
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Is this anything I will say I hate, I hate the

916
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,925
Speaker 4:  webcams that automatically move to keep you in the center of the frame. Yeah.

917
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:13,845
Speaker 4:  It is the worst experience to be on a call with somebody while their camera

918
00:48:13,985 --> 00:48:16,645
Speaker 4:  is constantly moving every time they move their head. But

919
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:18,325
Speaker 5:  It's like, it's just panning zoom. No.

920
00:48:18,675 --> 00:48:19,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah,

921
00:48:19,365 --> 00:48:21,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Or pan and scan. Right. But like, if

922
00:48:21,045 --> 00:48:23,405
Speaker 4:  You watch something that is constantly panning and scanning,

923
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:27,685
Speaker 2:  Hey, it sucks. Hey Bella porch built an entire TikTok career off that

924
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:31,445
Speaker 2:  effect man. Whatcha doing? Fair enough. Alright.

925
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:34,685
Speaker 2:  Alex, what is going on with wifi seven? It's, it's everywhere. It's like

926
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:35,645
Speaker 2:  having a moment. It

927
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:37,885
Speaker 5:  It's having a moment. It's, it's faster. Yeah.

928
00:48:38,795 --> 00:48:39,085
Speaker 2:  Okay.

929
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:43,605
Speaker 2:  but it, it's faster because you can like do a thing, right? Like,

930
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:46,725
Speaker 2:  like it can like use multiple radio channels at the same time.

931
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:49,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's faster. It can use multiple radio channels. And the big thing

932
00:48:49,645 --> 00:48:50,005
Speaker 5:  is that

933
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:53,045
Speaker 2:  Like I don know what you, what other feature you want from wifi other than

934
00:48:53,045 --> 00:48:54,245
Speaker 2:  faster. No

935
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:55,805
Speaker 5:  One wants anything else from wifi, but

936
00:48:55,805 --> 00:48:57,525
Speaker 2:  It's also a delivery service. Go fast.

937
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:02,005
Speaker 5:  It's now interactive. You can connect to QVC with it and buy all

938
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:02,565
Speaker 5:  sorts of things.

939
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:04,365
Speaker 4:  You can look at Max on it now.

940
00:49:04,895 --> 00:49:05,445
Speaker 2:  Which one?

941
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:10,165
Speaker 5:  All of them. But yeah, I think the big thing is is that it's gonna

942
00:49:10,165 --> 00:49:13,965
Speaker 5:  be smarter about how it handles your, your traffic. Yeah. So if

943
00:49:13,965 --> 00:49:17,285
Speaker 5:  you're on the five gigahertz and it's, it's getting jammed with stuff, it'll

944
00:49:17,285 --> 00:49:21,125
Speaker 5:  switch you over automatically to six. And this is just like, like the,

945
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:23,965
Speaker 5:  but the main thing is it's just, it's faster. It, it's, it's getting a lot

946
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:27,285
Speaker 5:  faster. It's getting smarter about how it handles all those packets. Yeah.

947
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:31,405
Speaker 5:  And you can prob like, you're gonna find laptops with it now

948
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:34,405
Speaker 5:  because a bunch of the laptops announced it to the point where I was like,

949
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,885
Speaker 5:  oh, I guess it's just everywhere now. It's the cheaper laptops don't have

950
00:49:37,885 --> 00:49:41,805
Speaker 5:  it. But anything like, like the XPS line has it. Yeah. A lot. All,

951
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:45,285
Speaker 5:  almost all of the gaming laptops that were announced have it. So is

952
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:48,525
Speaker 4:  It just all the stuff with the new Intel stuff happen?

953
00:49:48,525 --> 00:49:51,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It seems like primarily all the new Intel, but you still have to have

954
00:49:51,165 --> 00:49:54,445
Speaker 5:  like the wifi chip and, and that's expensive. Right. And so like sometimes

955
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:56,645
Speaker 5:  they're like, no, we're not gonna put the new wifi in. Yeah, that's fair.

956
00:49:56,745 --> 00:50:00,645
Speaker 5:  But but yeah. So, so it's gonna be available this year. I'm

957
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:03,485
Speaker 5:  hesitant to tell people to go out and buy those wifi seven routers. I think

958
00:50:03,485 --> 00:50:04,885
Speaker 5:  you can still, you can still,

959
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:08,485
Speaker 2:  Well they've only just started certifying. Yeah. So you can buy them now.

960
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:11,565
Speaker 2:  But they're uncertified and the promises that a software update will certify

961
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:11,645
Speaker 2:  that.

962
00:50:11,645 --> 00:50:15,485
Speaker 5:  Right. We just got, what's it? Wifi six E. Yeah. Like last year or

963
00:50:15,605 --> 00:50:19,525
Speaker 5:  something. I only know that because I bought a wifi six router and

964
00:50:19,525 --> 00:50:22,405
Speaker 5:  then it was immediately then out six E and I was very bitter about it.

965
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:25,565
Speaker 4:  That's how I feel too. I just bought new arrows and their wifi six because

966
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,285
Speaker 4:  I was like, who needs six E? Like that's barely

967
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:28,165
Speaker 5:  Anything. Yeah. Now they're seven and

968
00:50:28,165 --> 00:50:30,365
Speaker 4:  I'm seven. I'm like, I'm two generations behind now.

969
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:34,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So this is all just, this is like the wifi companies are

970
00:50:34,225 --> 00:50:36,685
Speaker 5:  are doing what the TV companies did where they just wanna make you jealous

971
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:40,085
Speaker 5:  every year. Yeah. So you're like, okay, I guess I better go spend $3,000

972
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:40,845
Speaker 5:  on a new router.

973
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:45,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I would wait until there's the second generation routers

974
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,445
Speaker 2:  when things calm down. Yeah. The last thing you want is for there to be software

975
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:52,245
Speaker 2:  instability in your network infrastructure fair. So like, unless

976
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:56,045
Speaker 2:  you need for some reason like a two gigabit per second

977
00:50:56,475 --> 00:50:57,205
Speaker 2:  wifi link.

978
00:50:57,665 --> 00:51:01,165
Speaker 5:  If you live like in an apartment, which we all do by yourself, really small.

979
00:51:01,595 --> 00:51:05,445
Speaker 5:  Your routers old. You see one of these like giant 'cause

980
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:08,805
Speaker 5:  it's always gonna be all like the giant gaming routers. Yeah. You wanna spend

981
00:51:08,805 --> 00:51:12,565
Speaker 5:  five or four or $500 on that thing. You know, I'm not gonna

982
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:16,525
Speaker 5:  judge you. I've done that not for seven, but I've definitely done that. But

983
00:51:16,525 --> 00:51:18,285
Speaker 5:  otherwise probably, probably wait

984
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,445
Speaker 2:  Year zero, max seven is not four or $500. It's like,

985
00:51:23,385 --> 00:51:26,165
Speaker 5:  Oh no, I'm thinking like the gaming, the gaming ones are also like, they

986
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:28,365
Speaker 5:  usually start at four or 500 but then they immediately go up.

987
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:31,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The a single Euro max seven is $600 and the three pack is

988
00:51:31,845 --> 00:51:33,285
Speaker 2:  $1,700. That's a region.

989
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:33,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

990
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:34,725
Speaker 5:  Wait, just, just wait.

991
00:51:35,015 --> 00:51:36,845
Speaker 4:  Don't spend that much money on row. Like

992
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:40,645
Speaker 5:  It's fast. But is it that much faster than six As

993
00:51:40,645 --> 00:51:43,925
Speaker 5:  particularly because you're still gonna be like hampered by the fact that

994
00:51:44,465 --> 00:51:47,765
Speaker 5:  you have to pay your ISP who probably is gonna give you garbage

995
00:51:48,325 --> 00:51:52,045
Speaker 5:  internet. So unless you're just moving a lot of big files on your Plex server,

996
00:51:52,545 --> 00:51:53,485
Speaker 5:  you're probably fine.

997
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:55,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. My local network is,

998
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:57,765
Speaker 2:  Is like I'm pre-ordering a 1700. All right. I haven't

999
00:51:57,765 --> 00:51:58,125
Speaker 5:  Pre-ordered it,

1000
00:51:58,205 --> 00:52:01,765
Speaker 2:  I swear. but it, it's wifi seven is here. It seems like it's gonna be the

1001
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:05,205
Speaker 2:  next Yep. Yep. Like six E seems very transitory. Yes. I also have a six E

1002
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:09,165
Speaker 2:  network and I feel very annoyed. Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Next year. Next

1003
00:52:09,165 --> 00:52:13,045
Speaker 2:  year. And then lastly, on the standards front, I'll say

1004
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:15,405
Speaker 2:  The Verge team was the most irrationally excited about this.

1005
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:21,165
Speaker 2:  I don't know why, but Thunderbolt five is here and we have

1006
00:52:21,165 --> 00:52:25,095
Speaker 2:  a lot of pictures of US PC ports. Ports with stickers on

1007
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:28,855
Speaker 2:  them that indicate they support Thunderbolt five. They're just

1008
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:32,455
Speaker 2:  pictures of US PC ports. Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't run pictures of

1009
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:36,175
Speaker 2:  USPC ports here at The Verge, I am perhaps the most guilty

1010
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:40,375
Speaker 2:  of publishing photo supports on our website and excitedly telling people

1011
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:43,655
Speaker 2:  that the future is here. I've done it a lot, but I'm just telling you it,

1012
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:47,095
Speaker 2:  it's not even a different shape of port. Yeah. It's

1013
00:52:47,095 --> 00:52:49,975
Speaker 2:  A-U-S-B-C port with a sticker on it. Their Thunderbolt five, Thunderbolt

1014
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:53,815
Speaker 2:  five offers 240 watt charging, 120 gigabit

1015
00:52:53,815 --> 00:52:57,455
Speaker 2:  per second data transfer and up to it will support monitors up to 540

1016
00:52:57,505 --> 00:52:59,735
Speaker 2:  hertz refresh rates on the new versions.

1017
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:03,975
Speaker 5:  Can you bring a 200? It's a good 40 watt charger on a plane. That's like

1018
00:53:04,005 --> 00:53:05,375
Speaker 5:  past FAA rules, right?

1019
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:08,295
Speaker 2:  No, that's the battery size. You can't bring more than a hundred watt, hundred

1020
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:09,455
Speaker 2:  watt hour battery. Okay.

1021
00:53:09,455 --> 00:53:10,015
Speaker 5:  So this is fine.

1022
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,095
Speaker 2:  But yeah, you can put two of those together,

1023
00:53:14,155 --> 00:53:17,895
Speaker 2:  but you need it for some of the GPUs that you need to support 540 hertz

1024
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:21,535
Speaker 2:  refresh rates. Yeah. So this is just the next standard. There are some laptops

1025
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,895
Speaker 2:  here. Again, you can look at the photos of the ports with the stickers on

1026
00:53:23,975 --> 00:53:26,845
Speaker 2:  'em on the website. But Thunderbolt five is here

1027
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:31,965
Speaker 2:  and Sean talked to the person Intel responsible for Mr. Thunderbolt,

1028
00:53:31,985 --> 00:53:35,405
Speaker 2:  who he referred to in print on our website as Mr. Thunderbolt. Wow. Sick.

1029
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:39,285
Speaker 2:  And I refuse to learn his real name. Intel's Mr. Thunderbolt, when asked

1030
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:42,885
Speaker 2:  of Apple would support Thunderbolt five simply said to Sean, well they support

1031
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:43,765
Speaker 2:  every other one.

1032
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:48,285
Speaker 2:  That's all you need to know. Yeah. We also have a photo of a Thunderbolt

1033
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:51,885
Speaker 2:  five cable. It looks like a Thunderbolt cable. I,

1034
00:53:52,545 --> 00:53:55,405
Speaker 2:  I'm telling you like our whole team is so excited. Like there was like a

1035
00:53:55,405 --> 00:53:58,805
Speaker 2:  hunt to get that first picture of a Thunderbolt five like our

1036
00:53:58,895 --> 00:54:02,805
Speaker 4:  Weeks ago. We made a whole virtual episode about how stupid USBC is.

1037
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:07,005
Speaker 4:  This is not stupid. USBC. This is the good USBC. Yeah. So

1038
00:54:07,005 --> 00:54:08,445
Speaker 4:  like we should be excited about this. It

1039
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,165
Speaker 2:  Goes fast. I'm excited about it. It's very good. Yeah. All right, we gotta

1040
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:14,725
Speaker 2:  take a break. That was the standards lightning round here at The. Vergecast.

1041
00:54:14,725 --> 00:54:17,045
Speaker 2:  Episode two, CES day four. Still

1042
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:17,925
Speaker 4:  Unsponsored. Still

1043
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:20,565
Speaker 2:  Unsponsored. Well no, we're here at the Kia connected home.

1044
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:21,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

1045
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:25,245
Speaker 2:  That's true. Very good. We'll be back. We got another car lightning

1046
00:54:25,245 --> 00:54:28,765
Speaker 2:  round to come in. David's rubric of things that are not screens

1047
00:54:29,755 --> 00:54:30,725
Speaker 2:  cars is next.

1048
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:33,205
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

1049
00:55:14,805 --> 00:55:16,125
Speaker 1:  E nine for more details.

1050
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:25,015
Speaker 2:  Alright, we're back. CES Vergecast

1051
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:29,135
Speaker 2:  two day four. Month

1052
00:55:29,355 --> 00:55:32,575
Speaker 2:  one. Our 12 year

1053
00:55:32,575 --> 00:55:33,375
Speaker 3:  2024.

1054
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:38,695
Speaker 2:  Last little lightning round of CSS coverage. This show over the

1055
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:42,575
Speaker 2:  years has become a car show. There's just cars everywhere. We're literally

1056
00:55:42,575 --> 00:55:46,175
Speaker 2:  sitting in the Kia connected home. There's cars all around us.

1057
00:55:47,585 --> 00:55:51,055
Speaker 2:  Every kind of car tech that you can think of is being demoed here. I saw

1058
00:55:51,135 --> 00:55:54,735
Speaker 2:  a power steering pump on the show floor the other day. The Bosch booth. Wow.

1059
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:57,895
Speaker 2:  Sure. They're like, here's a thing. And I was like, that's consumer technology

1060
00:55:58,015 --> 00:56:00,895
Speaker 2:  I suppose, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Consumers love steering wheels. It's,

1061
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:05,015
Speaker 2:  yeah, literally every piece of the car is being re-contextualized

1062
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:08,895
Speaker 2:  to be connected, to be smart, to be an EV. David, run us through some of

1063
00:56:08,895 --> 00:56:10,535
Speaker 2:  the highlights here. So the, that

1064
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:13,935
Speaker 4:  Thing you said is actually kind of why I think the car stuff is really interesting

1065
00:56:13,935 --> 00:56:17,895
Speaker 4:  because it feels like we got a bunch of cars. There's like

1066
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:21,095
Speaker 4:  new versions of existing cars, right. There's a lot of that at CES every

1067
00:56:21,095 --> 00:56:25,045
Speaker 4:  year. There's a lot of that this year. This year felt unusually also.

1068
00:56:25,075 --> 00:56:28,845
Speaker 4:  Like we got a bunch of things that are shaped like

1069
00:56:28,845 --> 00:56:31,125
Speaker 4:  cars that are barely cars. Yes.

1070
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:31,445
Speaker 2:  Yes.

1071
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:34,925
Speaker 4:  And I think like the, the Sony Afeela, which is probably the first one we

1072
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,885
Speaker 4:  should talk about, is to me the closest version of that thing. This is like

1073
00:56:38,735 --> 00:56:42,605
Speaker 4:  borderline not a car, it just looks like a car, but it's like a,

1074
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:46,485
Speaker 4:  it's like a lounge area that runs

1075
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:50,405
Speaker 4:  places theoretically. But the car part seems to be the least important

1076
00:56:50,465 --> 00:56:53,885
Speaker 4:  and least fleshed out part of this car. They've spent a lot of time thinking

1077
00:56:53,885 --> 00:56:54,445
Speaker 4:  about the seats.

1078
00:56:54,635 --> 00:56:54,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1079
00:56:55,665 --> 00:56:58,245
Speaker 4:  And that's about it. And I just think that's weird. We're in this like strange

1080
00:56:58,355 --> 00:57:01,965
Speaker 4:  time with cars where like Honda has this very cool

1081
00:57:02,665 --> 00:57:06,485
Speaker 4:  new concept series called Honda. Zero. Hyundai and

1082
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:08,965
Speaker 4:  Kia are doing interesting stuff there all over the place. There's just like

1083
00:57:08,965 --> 00:57:12,205
Speaker 4:  a Bugatti chilling on the floor. Yeah. For reasons that I don't totally understand.

1084
00:57:13,465 --> 00:57:16,445
Speaker 4:  but it just feels like a lot of the cars here aren't cars.

1085
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:17,885
Speaker 4:  It's a

1086
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:20,805
Speaker 2:  Tank. My just a tank. You saw a tank. There's

1087
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:22,645
Speaker 5:  Like a little like tiny tank over,

1088
00:57:23,045 --> 00:57:26,245
Speaker 2:  There's a company here called Dodge Brothers with e-bikes, but they've bought

1089
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,965
Speaker 2:  a Dodge Challenger and everyone's like, what's this for? And they're like,

1090
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:32,125
Speaker 2:  we just brought it to get attention. It's like, it's a very good, just a

1091
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:35,445
Speaker 2:  good comment. So, the way I always thought about this for years, was it css?

1092
00:57:35,445 --> 00:57:38,845
Speaker 2:  We saw the future of the inside of cars and then the Detroit auto shows in

1093
00:57:38,845 --> 00:57:41,045
Speaker 2:  a few weeks here and won't, that's where we'll see the outside of cars. Oh,

1094
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:44,565
Speaker 2:  I like that. The thing that is, I think not the case anymore.

1095
00:57:45,365 --> 00:57:49,285
Speaker 2:  'cause I think what is happening in a big way is the outside

1096
00:57:49,285 --> 00:57:52,005
Speaker 2:  cars are going retro. There's cool design stuff like these Honda concepts

1097
00:57:52,005 --> 00:57:55,805
Speaker 2:  are really cool. The inside of cars. That

1098
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:59,605
Speaker 2:  is what is selling the cars now. So if you just think like, I love watching

1099
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:02,645
Speaker 2:  car reviews on YouTube. You watch Doug Deira, you watch Forest Auto reviews.

1100
00:58:03,295 --> 00:58:06,565
Speaker 2:  Miles Summerall is on the Mkb HT team. I saw him the other day. He makes

1101
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:09,685
Speaker 2:  great TikTok car reviews. Everyone's like flipping buttons and counting cup

1102
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:12,845
Speaker 2:  holders and like pushing. Right. Like quirks and future because that's where

1103
00:58:12,845 --> 00:58:16,285
Speaker 2:  you spend your time because you're inside the car. Yeah. So that whole thing

1104
00:58:16,305 --> 00:58:19,885
Speaker 2:  has moved to the Detroit. 'cause that's how you're gonna sell cars now. Right?

1105
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:20,605
Speaker 2:  It's like And is

1106
00:58:20,605 --> 00:58:23,885
Speaker 4:  That just because Es especially as things go

1107
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:28,045
Speaker 4:  EV, like the the experience of what it's gonna be like to drive this thing

1108
00:58:28,475 --> 00:58:32,285
Speaker 4:  just compresses to the point where like driving an EV is gonna be like driving

1109
00:58:32,285 --> 00:58:33,325
Speaker 4:  an EV is gonna be their driving

1110
00:58:33,325 --> 00:58:36,445
Speaker 2:  EV and you see how a car companies called talk about mobility. Yeah. 'cause

1111
00:58:36,445 --> 00:58:38,045
Speaker 2:  they're like, you're gonna get in the car, it's gonna drive you where you

1112
00:58:38,045 --> 00:58:41,925
Speaker 2:  wanna go. And in the meantime you'll be a wash and a sea of Sony IP

1113
00:58:42,955 --> 00:58:44,965
Speaker 2:  just transacting. You'll be

1114
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:46,765
Speaker 5:  Spider-Man just flipping a car spider across

1115
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:48,405
Speaker 2:  The car. Spider Man's flying around the car and you're gonna be watching

1116
00:58:48,465 --> 00:58:51,965
Speaker 2:  our streaming service. If you could put Bravia Co in the Sony Feela Fila

1117
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:55,765
Speaker 2:  I'll, I'll buy it. Yeah. I 80 megabits per second in the So

1118
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:58,045
Speaker 4:  I guarantee you that's a thing.

1119
00:58:58,865 --> 00:59:01,405
Speaker 2:  Do you think it, because I'm in css, I've been wondering this all week.

1120
00:59:02,855 --> 00:59:06,325
Speaker 2:  Braco usage has to have dropped by like 200% because I'm not at home

1121
00:59:06,495 --> 00:59:07,925
Speaker 4:  Who's watching Spiderman? Yeah.

1122
00:59:09,425 --> 00:59:13,325
Speaker 2:  Anyhow, so the feel is really interesting 'cause I kind of get

1123
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:17,045
Speaker 2:  what Sony needs from Honda. Can you make us a car? Right. And what I've been

1124
00:59:17,045 --> 00:59:20,045
Speaker 2:  wondering is like what does Honda get from Sony? And the answer is a universe

1125
00:59:20,045 --> 00:59:23,885
Speaker 2:  of screens and content. But that is, it just doesn't

1126
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:25,525
Speaker 2:  feel like enough to sell me a car. I mean,

1127
00:59:26,225 --> 00:59:30,125
Speaker 5:  But also most of the car makers, most not all are garbage

1128
00:59:30,545 --> 00:59:32,645
Speaker 5:  at like the software side of things. So, right.

1129
00:59:32,645 --> 00:59:36,325
Speaker 2:  So that you see why Honda would turn to noted software? Oh yeah. Experience

1130
00:59:36,565 --> 00:59:37,685
Speaker 2:  provider Sony.

1131
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:40,725
Speaker 5:  I mean if you're garbage edit it makes sense.

1132
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:43,965
Speaker 2:  Can you imagine if the, like the interface of the Sony feel has the same

1133
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:46,005
Speaker 2:  menu structure as like any Sony camera.

1134
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:51,245
Speaker 5:  You just spend 45 minutes every time you get in your car where you even go

1135
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:53,165
Speaker 2:  Anywhere. Terrific image quality you have to

1136
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:54,805
Speaker 4:  Format before you go into drive.

1137
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:58,485
Speaker 5:  You brought the wrong format card. Sorry. No

1138
00:59:58,485 --> 01:00:01,565
Speaker 2:  Driving. It's, it's actually memory. No driving. We're doing, we're doing

1139
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:05,325
Speaker 2:  weird Sony memory formats. So that's a Fila, which is interesting. You look

1140
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:09,245
Speaker 2:  at the pictures, but it is very much, it's less about the car and more about

1141
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:12,645
Speaker 2:  will you watch a bunch of Sony content on these Sony screens?

1142
01:00:13,345 --> 01:00:17,125
Speaker 2:  And I think the answer is, well I have a phone, so

1143
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:21,005
Speaker 2:  no. And it will just, it's not, it's the most vaporware with vapor

1144
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:24,925
Speaker 2:  cars. Like this year instead of a picture of it. You can like look at one

1145
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:26,045
Speaker 2:  that's,

1146
01:00:26,045 --> 01:00:28,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah you can, you can sit in the passenger seat now.

1147
01:00:28,805 --> 01:00:30,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. but it, but it's not

1148
01:00:30,565 --> 01:00:32,285
Speaker 4:  Anywhere close. but it's still, I guess that's part of what is like leaving

1149
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:35,645
Speaker 4:  me cold with lot stuff is it doesn't really feel like any of this is getting

1150
01:00:35,835 --> 01:00:39,765
Speaker 4:  more real year after year. Like I think we're in

1151
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:42,965
Speaker 4:  a phase with car design that I think is not gonna last forever. Where everybody

1152
01:00:42,965 --> 01:00:46,325
Speaker 4:  is just designing cars that are like the capital F future.

1153
01:00:47,045 --> 01:00:49,725
Speaker 4:  You know what I mean? Like everything looks like a Blade runner prop now.

1154
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:54,165
Speaker 4:  And that's fun. But eventually we'll like start making EVs that look like

1155
01:00:54,165 --> 01:00:57,485
Speaker 4:  cars again. Like that will, that will happen. We'll come back to it. We'll

1156
01:00:57,485 --> 01:01:00,725
Speaker 4:  see. Fingers don't think so. You think we're just gonna stay in this like

1157
01:01:01,345 --> 01:01:05,165
Speaker 2:  Air 3000? All depends on autonomy. I think right now we're, we're on the

1158
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:08,325
Speaker 2:  cusp of what feels like a really fun design renaissance and cars. Cars are

1159
01:01:08,325 --> 01:01:11,965
Speaker 2:  real ugly for a long time. Oh yeah. Like the angry

1160
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:16,125
Speaker 2:  robot car was just everywhere for a minute. Yeah. And now

1161
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:19,285
Speaker 2:  there's like some very cool like smoothed out ture designs are EV all over

1162
01:01:19,285 --> 01:01:23,245
Speaker 2:  the place. The Honda ones. You're talking about Hyundai and Kia

1163
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:26,885
Speaker 2:  that what's, there's that Hyundai N concept that kinda looks like Laureate.

1164
01:01:26,885 --> 01:01:27,765
Speaker 2:  Like that stuff is really cool.

1165
01:01:29,505 --> 01:01:32,885
Speaker 2:  You know we're sitting above an E nine. People keep coming in looking at

1166
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:36,845
Speaker 2:  the E nine. You can just see like car companies are getting the new

1167
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,845
Speaker 2:  Prius. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a surprisingly cool looking car. Yeah. Finally

1168
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:43,845
Speaker 2:  it's dog slow and surprisingly cool looking car. We were just on the

1169
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:47,165
Speaker 2:  cusp of what I think is a good moment for car design. And it's because you

1170
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:51,605
Speaker 2:  can re, the EV stuff lets you repackage cars and think about them in a different

1171
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:54,685
Speaker 2:  way. Right. And they want them to look different from what came before. 'cause

1172
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:57,485
Speaker 2:  they wanna signal to consumers like these aren't just cars. And then on top

1173
01:01:57,485 --> 01:02:00,765
Speaker 2:  of that you might get to autonomy, which is a real coin flip and one that

1174
01:02:00,765 --> 01:02:03,845
Speaker 2:  will happen. And then you get to really repackage the car into the thing

1175
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,205
Speaker 2:  that looks nothing like a car. So,

1176
01:02:05,245 --> 01:02:08,565
Speaker 4:  I. I totally agree with that. But like this Honda

1177
01:02:08,915 --> 01:02:12,445
Speaker 4:  concept is just the Batmobile, like they just made the

1178
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:12,925
Speaker 4:  Batmobile.

1179
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:14,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There's a lot of that going around

1180
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:17,525
Speaker 4:  Here. I think. I just think we might have swung the pendulum a little far.

1181
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:18,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah.

1182
01:02:18,445 --> 01:02:19,565
Speaker 5:  I mean it's a, a concept like,

1183
01:02:19,665 --> 01:02:21,565
Speaker 4:  But now I'm looking at the picture of this and this thing's hot. So like

1184
01:02:21,635 --> 01:02:22,885
Speaker 4:  it's hot. Maybe I'm wrong. It's hot.

1185
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:25,565
Speaker 5:  It's a hot, I I had that on my wall when I was like eight. Right,

1186
01:02:25,565 --> 01:02:28,245
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. But but those are, these are all concepts. They're all like

1187
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,245
Speaker 2:  out in the world and you look at what's actually being asked css, it's like

1188
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:35,045
Speaker 2:  BMW put an L Lmm in the voice assistant. Okay. There's a bunch of

1189
01:02:35,145 --> 01:02:39,005
Speaker 2:  AR features and then you BMWs it's like why? Yeah. Right.

1190
01:02:39,445 --> 01:02:43,005
Speaker 2:  Volkswagen is letting you talk to chat GBT inside the car, which I am told

1191
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:46,965
Speaker 2:  people have just been doing anyway on like the streets of

1192
01:02:46,965 --> 01:02:47,725
Speaker 2:  San Francisco. Alarming.

1193
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:49,045
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna try it. My road trip,

1194
01:02:49,315 --> 01:02:53,205
Speaker 2:  Like someone told me yesterday, like more people, more tech people in

1195
01:02:53,205 --> 01:02:57,005
Speaker 2:  San Francisco are driving around just chatting to

1196
01:02:57,005 --> 01:02:59,565
Speaker 2:  chat GPT instead of listening to podcasts, then you think,

1197
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:03,205
Speaker 5:  Don't they have like siblings, parents

1198
01:03:03,455 --> 01:03:04,165
Speaker 5:  loved ones?

1199
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:07,005
Speaker 4:  This makes me think of like every once in a while there's like an app that

1200
01:03:07,005 --> 01:03:10,525
Speaker 4:  comes out that's like, turn all of your emails into a daily podcast. And

1201
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,685
Speaker 4:  I'm like, who wants that? And then it's it's these people it turns out Yeah.

1202
01:03:14,255 --> 01:03:16,125
Speaker 2:  Where we are. I just love the idea that people are getting outta the car

1203
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,885
Speaker 2:  is just woefully misinformed. Yeah. Just utterly be like,

1204
01:03:20,165 --> 01:03:23,045
Speaker 2:  I know a lot of facts. This robot may, but none of the numbers are Right.

1205
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:25,005
Speaker 5:  Whole list of books that don't exist that they're gonna read.

1206
01:03:25,555 --> 01:03:28,125
Speaker 2:  Exactly. They're like ready to read books that have never been written.

1207
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:34,885
Speaker 2:  On the flip side of that, there is a lot of just infrastructure here at

1208
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:38,885
Speaker 2:  CSS Intel. I, I think this can only be read as

1209
01:03:38,925 --> 01:03:41,765
Speaker 2:  a threat. Intel had a whole keynote where they announced a bunch of AI stuff

1210
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,765
Speaker 2:  and then the quote is, we are bringing the A IPC to the car.

1211
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:45,685
Speaker 5:  Right.

1212
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:49,565
Speaker 2:  Whether you like it or not. And Intel wants this to be a big market

1213
01:03:49,565 --> 01:03:53,485
Speaker 2:  for them. You can see that they would like to bring a car makers

1214
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:56,525
Speaker 2:  to use their chips. They're so, they're very late. Nvidia is very dominant

1215
01:03:56,705 --> 01:03:59,845
Speaker 2:  and all over the cars. But this notion that the car should be one sort of

1216
01:03:59,845 --> 01:04:03,165
Speaker 2:  unified computer from the body control module all the way infotainment stack,

1217
01:04:03,245 --> 01:04:06,925
Speaker 2:  I think Intel sees as an opportunity. And then

1218
01:04:07,215 --> 01:04:10,925
Speaker 2:  let's just end here. We should just talk about Will I am

1219
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:12,205
Speaker 2:  the Mercedes?

1220
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:15,845
Speaker 4:  Do we have to

1221
01:04:16,905 --> 01:04:20,845
Speaker 2:  So I was sent a video by a good friend of the Mercedes event, which

1222
01:04:20,905 --> 01:04:24,725
Speaker 2:  I'm told was very expensive to produce and Will I am comes out and he

1223
01:04:24,725 --> 01:04:27,245
Speaker 2:  wrapped a song about cars.

1224
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:33,005
Speaker 2:  It he just did it. Yeah. I love this for you. And the feature they announced

1225
01:04:33,985 --> 01:04:37,605
Speaker 2:  is that this is actually cool. I dunno if you've seen this video or any demos

1226
01:04:37,605 --> 01:04:41,565
Speaker 2:  of it. It's an interactive musical experience in the car. So it's

1227
01:04:41,565 --> 01:04:45,325
Speaker 2:  like playing a track and Will I am obviously chosen all the samples and if

1228
01:04:45,325 --> 01:04:47,445
Speaker 2:  you speed up the track, it's more exciting.

1229
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:48,685
Speaker 5:  Oh, I don't want that.

1230
01:04:49,345 --> 01:04:52,325
Speaker 2:  And it, it feels like it's just gonna make you drive really fast.

1231
01:04:52,565 --> 01:04:55,645
Speaker 5:  I was, I was like, my car just screaming at me as I drive down the road.

1232
01:04:55,675 --> 01:04:58,045
Speaker 4:  Have you ever, have you seen the movie Baby Driver? Yeah. Yeah.

1233
01:04:58,115 --> 01:04:58,405
Speaker 2:  Like

1234
01:04:58,405 --> 01:05:01,685
Speaker 4:  The, the thing in that movie that's so cool is the music is matched up to

1235
01:05:01,685 --> 01:05:05,045
Speaker 4:  what's going on. So like he's, he's steering on beat and drifting on beat

1236
01:05:05,225 --> 01:05:08,925
Speaker 4:  and it just, it rips dude. Yeah. Like it's so fun the whole time. I'm

1237
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,165
Speaker 4:  like, I could do that. Imagine

1238
01:05:10,465 --> 01:05:13,645
Speaker 5:  You watch that, you watch Fast and Furious, you get in this car

1239
01:05:14,355 --> 01:05:17,845
Speaker 5:  immediate accident, like you're going a hundred miles per hour

1240
01:05:18,525 --> 01:05:21,165
Speaker 5:  straight out. You're like, I can drift around this corner in my neighborhood

1241
01:05:21,165 --> 01:05:21,325
Speaker 5:  and

1242
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:23,005
Speaker 4:  It's just where I am yelling at you the whole way home.

1243
01:05:24,225 --> 01:05:27,965
Speaker 2:  So it's the MBUX sound drive or Mbu sound drive.

1244
01:05:29,065 --> 01:05:31,885
Speaker 2:  It links the music that you're listening to is driving. So it's a bunch of

1245
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:35,645
Speaker 2:  tracks, bunch of samples and things like energy

1246
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:39,525
Speaker 2:  recuperation, acceleration, steering, braking and turning all

1247
01:05:39,825 --> 01:05:43,685
Speaker 2:  linked to what is being played. And

1248
01:05:43,685 --> 01:05:47,405
Speaker 2:  will I am refer to this as the automotive orchestra. Cool.

1249
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:49,965
Speaker 4:  Okay. I love it. There was a thing a bunch of years ago, and it's possible,

1250
01:05:49,985 --> 01:05:53,405
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna get all of the details of this wrong, where I think it was Spotify

1251
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:58,045
Speaker 4:  did a thing with Tiesto that had basically like adaptive

1252
01:05:58,645 --> 01:06:02,605
Speaker 4:  Tiesto songs to your workout so that like the, the faster you were

1253
01:06:02,605 --> 01:06:06,325
Speaker 4:  moving, the faster Tiesto would go. Yeah. And I tried it out and it was like,

1254
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:09,285
Speaker 4:  it was pretty cool 'cause it like keeps up with the beat as you're running

1255
01:06:09,345 --> 01:06:11,485
Speaker 4:  and you like you, it kinda, you fall into the right pace.

1256
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:15,725
Speaker 4:  A hundred percent. Everyone is gonna crash their cars as soon as they start

1257
01:06:15,725 --> 01:06:16,285
Speaker 4:  you. Well,

1258
01:06:16,385 --> 01:06:19,045
Speaker 2:  So there's other things that happen too. For example, if it's raining and

1259
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:22,925
Speaker 2:  you turn on your windshield wipers, it'll play lo-fi beats at you so

1260
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:24,405
Speaker 2:  you can drive home sadly in the rain.

1261
01:06:24,745 --> 01:06:25,245
Speaker 5:  So you drive

1262
01:06:25,275 --> 01:06:29,205
Speaker 2:  Slow. I was in loved ones. My Mercedes Benz. If you get

1263
01:06:29,205 --> 01:06:29,445
Speaker 2:  in the

1264
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:32,325
Speaker 4:  Car and you like roll into the McDonald's, drive through, like what does

1265
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:32,565
Speaker 4:  it start

1266
01:06:32,565 --> 01:06:36,045
Speaker 2:  Playing? Mercedes wants sound drive to be an open music platform so that

1267
01:06:36,045 --> 01:06:39,365
Speaker 2:  any musician create their own auditory soundscape for driving,

1268
01:06:39,855 --> 01:06:43,845
Speaker 2:  using the Mbu operating system. Can you, this is like why I

1269
01:06:43,845 --> 01:06:47,365
Speaker 2:  am at CES. Yeah. I want to be very clear, this specific

1270
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:51,605
Speaker 2:  nonsensical idea with Will I am just mash it all. I'm

1271
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:54,605
Speaker 2:  surprised to have him put the words AI in this in any way, shape or form.

1272
01:06:55,385 --> 01:06:57,845
Speaker 5:  I'm just imagining being a kid in this car. You know when you'd sit in the

1273
01:06:57,845 --> 01:07:01,365
Speaker 5:  back and you'd like, when it's raining on your car, you're just thinking

1274
01:07:01,365 --> 01:07:05,085
Speaker 5:  really heavy thoughts in the back of the car as a little kid. But now you'll

1275
01:07:05,085 --> 01:07:07,685
Speaker 5:  have this soundtrack going with it. Yeah. Like the lo-fi soundtrack.

1276
01:07:08,485 --> 01:07:12,165
Speaker 4:  I just wanted to like play me depressing music while I like

1277
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:16,045
Speaker 4:  shove Taco Bell in my face on a long road trip. Like what's, what's the vibe

1278
01:07:16,045 --> 01:07:16,765
Speaker 4:  there? One hand

1279
01:07:16,765 --> 01:07:18,165
Speaker 5:  On the wheel. Exactly. Tacos

1280
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:18,405
Speaker 4:  In the

1281
01:07:18,405 --> 01:07:21,565
Speaker 2:  Other hand like Yeah, the one where will I am is like you got broken up with

1282
01:07:21,565 --> 01:07:21,765
Speaker 2:  dude.

1283
01:07:23,385 --> 01:07:25,965
Speaker 2:  You can, you can buy a taco and a burrito. You know what I'm saying?

1284
01:07:27,795 --> 01:07:30,285
Speaker 2:  Like that crunch wrap alone. Ain't gonna, ain't gonna take this home.

1285
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:35,365
Speaker 2:  We've all been there. Alright, that's the Vergecast Day

1286
01:07:35,545 --> 01:07:38,365
Speaker 2:  two, episode two, day four

1287
01:07:39,425 --> 01:07:43,045
Speaker 2:  at CES 2024, right? Yeah. Seems good. It was a good

1288
01:07:43,265 --> 01:07:46,165
Speaker 2:  css. Yeah. Yeah. I will say it was good. Good. And I got to go sit in this

1289
01:07:46,165 --> 01:07:49,725
Speaker 2:  sphere. A almost religious experience capped off by

1290
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:51,325
Speaker 2:  an almost religious movie.

1291
01:07:54,245 --> 01:07:57,285
Speaker 2:  Thank you for joining us. Thank you to Kia for letting us use our Space studio

1292
01:07:57,285 --> 01:08:00,485
Speaker 2:  shows. Thank you. The whole Verge team has just been killing it this week.

1293
01:08:00,485 --> 01:08:01,885
Speaker 2:  Please read the site. Check

1294

Speaker 4:  Out our best of CES stuff. The best is up

1295
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:06,685
Speaker 2:  As you're hearing this. It's coming right now. It's going up. TikTok channel

1296
01:08:06,685 --> 01:08:10,205
