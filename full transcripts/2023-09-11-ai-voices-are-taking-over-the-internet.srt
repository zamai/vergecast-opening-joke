Description: In part one of The Vergecast's AI mini series, David Pierce dives into the boom of voice synthesis and artificially generated speech. The process is a lot more accessible for everyone, but how realistic can it sound?

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,400
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Neurological Engines

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,320
Speaker 2:  for overdubbing. I'm David Pierce and hang on one second. Actually, I

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,280
Speaker 2:  just gotta finish something. Once upon a time, a white snake and a

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,640
Speaker 2:  green snake living in a remote mountain became immortal and obtained

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,600
Speaker 2:  superpowers after centuries of practice. Okay,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,560
Speaker 2:  sorry. I'm back, and before you worry that I just like had a stroke or

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,640
Speaker 2:  something live on the microphone, I should tell you that I'm actually in

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,600
Speaker 2:  the middle of training an AI to mimic the sound of my voice. This

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,320
Speaker 2:  one is on the iPhone. It's called Personal Voice and products like this

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,400
Speaker 2:  are what we're gonna talk about today. The idea of being able to

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,360
Speaker 2:  create your own AI voice clone has been around for a while.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,080
Speaker 2:  We actually talked a bunch about it on this show in 2021. I'll link to it

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,960
Speaker 2:  in the show notes. A lot of it holds up really well, but over the last couple

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,560
Speaker 2:  of years it's gotten both drastically easier to make a vocal

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,800
Speaker 2:  AI and the results have gotten drastically better. You can even

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,840
Speaker 2:  do it on your phone like I'm doing now with just a few minutes of really

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,880
Speaker 2:  awkward reading of sentences. Here's what mine sounds like. Hi, I am

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
Speaker 2:  David Pierce's, ai iPhone voice. I'm kind of like David, but kind of not.

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,240
Speaker 2:  So today on the show we're going to dive into the boom of voice ai

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,120
Speaker 2:  and then we're gonna try to figure out if I can actually make something that

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,080
Speaker 2:  sounds like me. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,890
Speaker 3:  Support for this show comes from a w s. Innovations in

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,770
Speaker 3:  machine learning and AI have completely changed the game, but

25
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,610
Speaker 3:  as with any cutting edge technology, it's important to stay ahead of the

26
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,570
Speaker 3:  curve or you risk getting left behind. Amazon Web Services

27
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,410
Speaker 3:  can help your small business stay ahead of the competition. A w

28
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,450
Speaker 3:  s provides a framework for businesses to navigate the fast changing landscape

29
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,570
Speaker 3:  and helps businesses harness the emerging capabilities of AI and

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,210
Speaker 3:  machine learning. It's time to imagine how a w s can

31
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,450
Speaker 3:  transform your business. Go to AWS is how.com

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,290
Speaker 3:  to learn more.

33
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,010
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Before we get too deep into the world of AI voices,

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,490
Speaker 2:  let's try and quickly understand why this is such a big thing right now.

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,330
Speaker 2:  And as far as I can tell, there are basically three reasons this kind of

36
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,250
Speaker 2:  tech is booming. The first is because audio in general is

37
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,970
Speaker 2:  booming with podcasts and voice messages and those generated

38
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,410
Speaker 2:  spoken captions you hear on TikTok and all sorts of other things.

39
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,850
Speaker 2:  If you think about it, you probably hear the internet a lot more than you

40
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,810
Speaker 2:  used to, and like any other creative feature on the internet, a lot of

41
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,650
Speaker 2:  tools exist to help you make it. One app we use is called

42
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,490
Speaker 2:  Script. It's an app that a lot of people use for editing audio and video.

43
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,610
Speaker 2:  It has this feature called Overdub Voices and one of the script's coolest

44
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,480
Speaker 2:  features in general is that you can edit audio and video basically by editing

45
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,240
Speaker 2:  text. You import a file, it gives you a transcript, and if you

46
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,760
Speaker 2:  delete the word in the transcript, it'll also try and

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Speaker 2:  seamlessly delete the from the actual audio file. It's not

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Speaker 2:  perfect, but it works pretty well and it kind of feels like magic to use

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Speaker 2:  it with overdub. Descrip can go even further. Let's say you

50
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,880
Speaker 2:  forgot something or you stumbled on a word or transition, you can

51
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,680
Speaker 2:  now make an AI copy of your own voice and insert new

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Speaker 2:  audio just by typing the text you want to appear. So let's say I say

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,480
Speaker 2:  the sentence, the iPhone came out in 2007 when Steve Jobs announced

54
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,320
Speaker 2:  it as three things, a wide screen iPod, a revolutionary mobile

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,000
Speaker 2:  phone, and a breakthrough internet communicator. Alright, let's just hear

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,840
Speaker 2:  that sentence back. The iPhone came out in 2007 when

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,560
Speaker 2:  Steve Jobs announced it as three things. A widescreen iPod, a

58
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,360
Speaker 2:  revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communicator. Wait,

59
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Speaker 2:  sorry, I got that slightly wrong. He called it a breakthrough internet communications

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,960
Speaker 2:  device. I could rerecord that whole thing or I could just go into the

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,880
Speaker 2:  script, retype the transcript, and here's what I get. The iPhone

62
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,440
Speaker 2:  came out in 2007 when Steve Jobs announced it as three things,

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,800
Speaker 2:  a widescreen iPod, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet

64
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,040
Speaker 2:  communications device. It's not bad. I wouldn't wanna

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,880
Speaker 2:  listen to a whole hour of that voice, I don't think, but in small

66
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,600
Speaker 2:  bits, and especially in the context of something larger, I'm not even sure

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,160
Speaker 2:  you'd always notice it there. There are other apps out there like podcasts

68
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,520
Speaker 2:  all doing the same kind of thing, and I suspect you're gonna see tools like

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,160
Speaker 2:  this show up anywhere that people make audio.

70
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,560
Speaker 2:  Okay, so that's the first use case. The second is kind of the flip side.

71
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,480
Speaker 2:  There are also a bunch of tools out there using AI voices to read written

72
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,840
Speaker 2:  stories out loud. The Atlantic, for instance, is working with a company called

73
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,800
Speaker 2:  11 Labs to have an AI narrator read some of the stories

74
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,440
Speaker 2:  on the website.

75
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,720
Speaker 4:  For years, the American approach to protein has been a never ending

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,840
Speaker 4:  quest for more. On average, each person in the United States

77
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,800
Speaker 4:  puts away roughly 300 pounds of meat a year.

78
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,080
Speaker 2:  Again, it's not perfect and I don't know that it always sounds like a person,

79
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,320
Speaker 2:  but I kind of can't believe how good it's, it wasn't that

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,800
Speaker 2:  long ago by the way that these generated voices sounded like

81
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,920
Speaker 2:  flat tone less robots like, here's Sophia, the robot from

82
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,600
Speaker 2:  2016 that was considered to be one of the most advanced robots ever created

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,600
Speaker 2:  on The Tonight Show.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,120
Speaker 5:  I traveled to over 25 countries, appeared on the cover of

85
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,840
Speaker 5:  Cosmopolitan Magazine, met German Chancellor Anger La

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,720
Speaker 5:  Merkel, and the actor Will Smith and became Twitter friends with Chrissy

87
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,120
Speaker 5:  Tegan,

88
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,640
Speaker 2:  And here is that same thing Sophia said, which I just typed into the generator

89
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,200
Speaker 2:  on the 11 Labs website. I picked a voice name, grace, put this in there,

90
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,760
Speaker 2:  click generate, and after about 10 seconds, this is what came out.

91
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,680
Speaker 6:  I traveled to over 25 countries, appeared on the cover of

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,480
Speaker 6:  Cosmopolitan Magazine, met German chancellor Angela Merkel

93
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,560
Speaker 6:  and the actor Will Smith and became Twitter friends with Chrissy Teigan.

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,760
Speaker 2:  I mean, it's night and day right? I think you're gonna start to see this

95
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,280
Speaker 2:  everywhere, articles, whole websites, entire books,

96
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,480
Speaker 2:  all read aloud, all using generated AI and the product itself

97
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
Speaker 2:  is actually starting to be pretty good.

98
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,480
Speaker 2:  It is also, of course, a huge ethical and legal disaster

99
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,920
Speaker 2:  all the way back in 2019 again, before the tech was nearly as good

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,800
Speaker 2:  as it is now. A bunch of publishers sued Audible over a feature called

101
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,280
Speaker 2:  Audible Captions, which would read a book aloud to you as you look to the

102
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,920
Speaker 2:  page. It seems like a normal useful feature, right?

103
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,280
Speaker 2:  Also seems like an existential threat to the entire idea and industry of

104
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
Speaker 2:  audiobooks. Audible and the publishers settled in 2020, but that was

105
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,120
Speaker 2:  only the beginning of the bigger questions here, some audiobook

106
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,240
Speaker 2:  narrators have worried that their voices are being used to train algorithms

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,160
Speaker 2:  that might someday replace them, and they're not really wrong. All this

108
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,120
Speaker 2:  is not at all theoretical. If you go into the Apple Books app and search

109
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,960
Speaker 2:  for AI narration, you'll find a bunch of audio books that say they are narrated

110
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,360
Speaker 2:  by Apple Books. Apple says that that means that they are quote

111
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,280
Speaker 2:  narrated by a digital voice based on a human narrator. Here's just a

112
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,200
Speaker 2:  sample from a book called Language of Love by Kristin Ethridge. A lot of

113
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,560
Speaker 2:  these AI narrated books are romance novels by the way, for whatever reason,

114
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,680
Speaker 2:  and this one sounds to my ears, shockingly like a human red audiobook,

115
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,120
Speaker 8:  He raised his fist and wrapped on the solid wood. After about 30

116
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,040
Speaker 8:  seconds of silence, the distinct sound of the lock turning broke

117
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,880
Speaker 8:  through a woman of average heights stepped into the sliver of

118
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,280
Speaker 8:  an opening.

119
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,920
Speaker 2:  The other version of this that you might have heard about or even encountered

120
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,840
Speaker 2:  without knowing is celebrity AI voices. Like there was a pretty

121
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,360
Speaker 2:  big backlash a couple of years ago when a documentary about Anthony Bourdain

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Speaker 2:  called Roadrunner, which came out after Bourdain's death, trained an

123
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,200
Speaker 2:  AI model on his voice and then used it to generate narration for the film.

124
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,560
Speaker 2:  The director Morgan Neville said that he only used the AI to say words that

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,360
Speaker 2:  Bourdain himself had written, which was an ethical choice for him, and I

126
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Speaker 2:  guess I can see where he's coming from. I still don't know whether any of

127
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
Speaker 2:  that feels okay to me or awful. It's all really

128
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,800
Speaker 2:  complicated and examples like this exist everywhere. AI helped

129
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,000
Speaker 2:  Val Kilmer speak after he lost his voice due to throat cancer. Lots of celebrities

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,840
Speaker 2:  trained AI to do things like give you Waze directions. All this too

131
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,720
Speaker 2:  is pretty controversial. One of the things Hollywood is on strike about right

132
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,680
Speaker 2:  now is AI's potential to scan their likeness so that they never need to

133
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,560
Speaker 2:  be actually used in films again. Imagine an AI trained on

134
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,240
Speaker 2:  Morgan Freeman's voice that could narrate every documentary ever without

135
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,960
Speaker 2:  paying Freeman a dime. This stuff all gets really messy really

136
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,920
Speaker 2:  fast. Okay, and Then, we have the third and probably most

137
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,480
Speaker 2:  newly mainstream use case here, accessibility.

138
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,000
Speaker 2:  Apple launched a new feature this year in iOS 17 called Live Speech,

139
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,640
Speaker 2:  which you can use to type something and have it said out loud in phone calls

140
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,480
Speaker 2:  or even for in-person conversation, and when you pair it with personal voice.

141
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,120
Speaker 2:  Another new feature this year, the one I was testing up at the beginning

142
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,080
Speaker 2:  of the show, you can create an AI version of your own voice just

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,560
Speaker 2:  by recording yourself, talking into your phone, and then use that to generate

144
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,440
Speaker 2:  your live speech. It's all a little like the incredibly powerful

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,240
Speaker 2:  system that the late Stephen Hawking had, which let him speak through a computer.

146
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,880
Speaker 9:  A cat offers a list of predictions based on an analysis of

147
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,560
Speaker 9:  the English language in my previous usage.

148
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,840
Speaker 2:  Okay, again, not to keep belaboring this point, but that video is from eight

149
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,320
Speaker 2:  years ago. Think about how much better a system like Hawkings would sound

150
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
Speaker 2:  today. Although I have to say I do love how much Hawking

151
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,560
Speaker 2:  embraced that robotic sound and made it his own.

152
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,960
Speaker 9:  It has become my trademark and I wouldn't change it for

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,680
Speaker 9:  a more natural voice with a British accent.

154
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,480
Speaker 2:  Samsung is building a similar feature with Bixby so that you can now speak

155
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,440
Speaker 2:  with your own voice through your Galaxy. Phone works kind of the same way

156
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,520
Speaker 2:  and on a similar line, lots of people have used screen readers for years,

157
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,440
Speaker 2:  which are able to speak aloud, whatever's on a screen. Those are also getting

158
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,560
Speaker 2:  vastly better, both because the voices are improving and because AI systems

159
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,000
Speaker 2:  are getting much better at actually understanding the contents of

160
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,200
Speaker 2:  webpage and apps and anything else you're looking at. All of that is super

161
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,800
Speaker 2:  exciting and I'm also really into the idea of being able to use machine

162
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,520
Speaker 2:  translation in these voices to be able to speak simultaneously in

163
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,120
Speaker 2:  lots of languages someday, not that far from now. This podcast

164
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,360
Speaker 2:  with my voice could be available in basically any language on

165
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,240
Speaker 2:  earth. That's really cool. It's also a really hard problem and we're definitely

166
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,120
Speaker 2:  not there yet, but in general, being able to speak with your own voice,

167
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,760
Speaker 2:  even when you can't do that, is a big deal. It's complicated

168
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,200
Speaker 2:  ethically and morally and legally and in so many other ways,

169
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,800
Speaker 2:  but it's a big deal nonetheless.

170
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,000
Speaker 2:  Alright, we need to take a quick break and then when we come back, we're

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,960
Speaker 2:  gonna investigate what it takes to actually make an AI voice and see if

172
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,280
Speaker 2:  it's really possible to do it well. We'll be right back.

173
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,500
Speaker 3:  Support for this show comes from a w s. We are living

174
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,260
Speaker 3:  in the future and artificial intelligence is completely transforming

175
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,420
Speaker 3:  how business is done, but without an experienced developer on your team,

176
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,540
Speaker 3:  how can you make the most of these emerging technologies? Amazon

177
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Speaker 3:  Web Services can help. A w s has been democratizing

178
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,260
Speaker 3:  access to AI and machine learning for companies and customers.

179
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,540
Speaker 3:  They've invested $100 million to build their generative AI

180
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,500
Speaker 3:  innovation center to help customers understand and deploy generative

181
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,140
Speaker 3:  AI to predict trends and prototype with data-driven design.

182
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,780
Speaker 3:  Just imagine how a w s can transform your business. learn

183
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,380
Speaker 3:  more at a w ss is how.com.

184
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,100
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Let's make some AI voices, shall we?

185
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,700
Speaker 2:  The idea with most of these systems is basically the same because the way

186
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Speaker 2:  you train an AI model in general is just to give it lots and lots and lots

187
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,540
Speaker 2:  of data and just kind of watch it churn through and see what it learns.

188
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,660
Speaker 2:  But in the systems I've been trying, there is one important distinction.

189
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,380
Speaker 2:  Some tools like Descrip, just ask for a huge batch of audio.

190
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,900
Speaker 2:  They'll give you a script if you want it, but really the goal is just to

191
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,100
Speaker 2:  upload hours and hours and hours of the sound of your voice and see what

192
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,900
Speaker 2:  happens. Others go one step further and we'll ask you to record

193
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,780
Speaker 2:  yourself saying a series of specific and often weird and often

194
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,020
Speaker 2:  thoroughly random things. So like when I open up podcast to create

195
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,620
Speaker 2:  my digital AI voice, it had a lot of really specific instructions.

196
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,940
Speaker 2:  Okay, now time to do 70 sentences. Here we go.

197
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,520
Speaker 2:  Everything seems better. In summer. I asked my

198
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,760
Speaker 2:  dad if he could help me look at that lovely cat

199
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,080
Speaker 2:  That he had it 70 sentences later, I waited a while and

200
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,320
Speaker 2:  the next day I got an email saying my digital voice was ready. You wanna

201
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,200
Speaker 2:  hear it? Hi, I'm David Pierce, except not

202
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,160
Speaker 2:  really. I'm an AI bot, but I've been trained to sound like David

203
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,120
Speaker 2:  Pierce. Is this convincing? That one's not great,

204
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,560
Speaker 2:  not super impressed, but let's give it a little more to work with and see

205
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,800
Speaker 2:  how we do. While we're on the subject of ethically dubious things, I'm gonna

206
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,680
Speaker 2:  grab the text of one of my favorite TV moments ever. It's

207
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,680
Speaker 2:  a Dwight Shroud speech from the office.

208
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,760
Speaker 10:  What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight.

209
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,760
Speaker 10:  Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the chandelier. It's priceless.

210
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,000
Speaker 10:  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,840
Speaker 10:  father's business. She's Tiffany. I say, no, we make love all

212
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,320
Speaker 10:  night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.

213
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,160
Speaker 10:  I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her

214
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,320
Speaker 10:  besides, I like the cold. 30 years later, I get a postcard. I have

215
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,760
Speaker 10:  a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting.

216
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,280
Speaker 10:  I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the trod. She's

217
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,320
Speaker 10:  been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I

218
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,680
Speaker 10:  don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the

219
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Speaker 10:  chandelier.

220
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,400
Speaker 2:  I mean, it's just like 60 perfect seconds. I love it so much. Let's have

221
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,520
Speaker 2:  ai David take a run at that speech. Here goes, what is my perfect

222
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,600
Speaker 2:  crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the

223
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,400
Speaker 2:  fall? No. I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As

224
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,280
Speaker 2:  I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop.

225
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,400
Speaker 2:  It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say, no, we make

226
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,840
Speaker 2:  love all night. Okay, so I hear that and it's like,

227
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,120
Speaker 2:  yeah, that sounds like me, but it also doesn't sound like a human, if

228
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,800
Speaker 2:  that makes sense. in general, podcast was really easy to use, but

229
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,710
Speaker 2:  I'm not terribly impressed with the outcome. So now let's try script,

230
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,510
Speaker 2:  which is I think in general a significantly more sophisticated piece of

231
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,430
Speaker 2:  audio software. It too is a process. So I go to

232
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,230
Speaker 2:  voices. Yeah, we're creating a new voice. Alright,

233
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,150
Speaker 2:  we'll do a few recent Friday Verge casts. How about

234
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,990
Speaker 2:  that? Preparing and uploading. Okay, it

235
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,830
Speaker 2:  finally uploaded all my stuff. Let's go. We click Submit Training data and

236
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,030
Speaker 2:  now it says, ready to create your overdub voice record your voice Id press

237
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,750
Speaker 2:  record and read the statement below. All right, let's do it. We hit stop.

238
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,070
Speaker 2:  We submit it. We are uploading. It says, putting the finishing touches on

239
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,350
Speaker 2:  your training project. Your voice is now training. We'll email you when it's

240
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,070
Speaker 2:  done. Here we go. I ended up submitting about four

241
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,310
Speaker 2:  hours of my own voice to make this happen because luckily, I already have

242
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,430
Speaker 2:  hours of my voice recorded from just being on The Vergecast and

243
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,590
Speaker 2:  like with podcast. It took a while to process everything and then I got an

244
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,990
Speaker 2:  email that my voice was ready, which is a very funny email to receive. Here's

245
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,950
Speaker 2:  what it sounded like. Hi, I'm David Pierce, the ai, David Pierce,

246
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,190
Speaker 2:  the descrip version of ai, David Pierce. How do I sound?

247
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,390
Speaker 2:  All I hear in that is that I feel like that's what I might sound like if

248
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,190
Speaker 2:  I'd gone to like a really fancy New England boarding school and

249
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,110
Speaker 2:  also had a really, really nasty head cold, but I don't think in general

250
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,030
Speaker 2:  that one sounds like me at all really, but let's try it again with our

251
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,630
Speaker 2:  Dwight Fruit speech. What is my perfect crime? I break into

252
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,310
Speaker 2:  Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.

253
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,510
Speaker 2:  It's priceless. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where

254
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,110
Speaker 2:  the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the

255
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,950
Speaker 2:  trod. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another

256
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,550
Speaker 2:  lover. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stash the

257
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,390
Speaker 2:  chandelier. The strange thing about this one is the intonation, the

258
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,270
Speaker 2:  kind of ebb and flow of the sentences here. It's really not bad. It's

259
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,990
Speaker 2:  a little stilted, but it does move more or less like you would

260
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,790
Speaker 2:  expect a human to talk. It just doesn't sound right and it

261
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,350
Speaker 2:  seems to skip a bunch of words and sentences when it doesn't quite know what

262
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,150
Speaker 2:  to do. My takeaway is basically descrip is fine for those little filler words

263
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,430
Speaker 2:  like we were doing earlier, but that's about it.

264
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,390
Speaker 2:  I would say in general so far my takeaway is that these things aren't amazing,

265
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,390
Speaker 2:  but they're decent and honestly it's really easy to make them like much easier

266
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,150
Speaker 2:  than I expected. So let's keep going. Let's do a couple more.

267
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,390
Speaker 2:  11 Labs, the company we've talked about a bunch so far has the simplest process

268
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,550
Speaker 2:  of any that I've seen. You just sign up, upload a few minutes of audio. It

269
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,590
Speaker 2:  actually explicitly says you only need about five minutes and that anything

270
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,350
Speaker 2:  more is just overkill and you're off and running. So I added some Vergecast

271
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,230
Speaker 2:  stuff about 15 minutes and all because You know I'm an overachiever and

272
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,070
Speaker 2:  then just waited a while. This one only took a couple of minutes and we were

273
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,830
Speaker 2:  up and running. Hi, it's AI David Pierce again. This time I'm made by 11

274
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,830
Speaker 2:  Labs, but I'm still me sort of. I think You know what I mean.

275
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,470
Speaker 2:  I'm not gonna lie it, that one kind of gave me goosebumps. It goes a little

276
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,200
Speaker 2:  fast like I don't think that's how you'd say that sentence, but this is way

277
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,080
Speaker 2:  better than anything else I've tried or even heard, and it took a grand total

278
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,080
Speaker 2:  of about 90 seconds to put together. What's weird though is

279
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,960
Speaker 2:  that it's not always this good. I clicked generate again with the same

280
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,640
Speaker 2:  text and it spit back something subtly different and I think

281
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,760
Speaker 2:  slightly worse. Hi, it's AI David Pierce again. This time I'm

282
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,960
Speaker 2:  made by 11 labs, but I'm still me sort of. I think You know what I mean.

283
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,880
Speaker 2:  Again, really good, better than anything else we've tried, but not quite

284
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,560
Speaker 2:  as good as that first one, which is odd. It's just that pause in the first

285
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,280
Speaker 2:  one right before the word sort of is like exactly how I

286
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,960
Speaker 2:  would've said that in real life. I still kind of can't get over it. It freaked

287
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,440
Speaker 2:  me out. Anyway, let's try this model with our Dwight True Speech.

288
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,640
Speaker 2:  What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for

289
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,280
Speaker 2:  the vault? No. I go for the chandelier. It's priceless.

290
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,080
Speaker 2:  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop.

291
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,240
Speaker 2:  It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say, no,

292
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,520
Speaker 2:  we make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape

293
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,400
Speaker 2:  in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go

294
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,000
Speaker 2:  to Canada. I don't trust her besides, I like the cold.

295
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,680
Speaker 2:  30 years later I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the

296
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,920
Speaker 2:  chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany

297
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,960
Speaker 2:  to meet me in Paris by the ero. She's been waiting for me all these

298
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,800
Speaker 2:  years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I

299
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,880
Speaker 2:  don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

300
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,400
Speaker 2:  That one's not perfect and it seems to me that it got a little worse

301
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,240
Speaker 2:  as it went on. The cadence got a little less human and a little more just

302
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,840
Speaker 2:  kind of robot monotone. Everything takes the same time to say

303
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,960
Speaker 2:  You. know what I mean? But I bet I could use that voice on almost anyone

304
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,920
Speaker 2:  for a minute or two and get away with it. What is my perfect crime? Okay,

305
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,560
Speaker 2:  let's try one more. This is the Apple personal voice feature. The one that's

306
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,760
Speaker 2:  gonna come to lots of people's iPhones. I suspect a lot of people are gonna

307
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,680
Speaker 2:  set this up pretty soon. This one took by the way, the longest by far of

308
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,400
Speaker 2:  any to set up, so the first thing I have to do is decide, do I wanna share

309
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,120
Speaker 2:  across devices? Sure. Do I wanna allow apps to request to

310
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,160
Speaker 2:  use? Why would I want that? Creating my personal voice. I'm gonna

311
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Speaker 2:  read 150 phrases aloud, which may take about 15 minutes. Then

312
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
Speaker 2:  it's gonna generate it, and then we'll go from there. All right. Let's see.

313
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,560
Speaker 2:  That was the best movie I've ever seen. Are you still hungry?

314
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,920
Speaker 2:  It's a beautiful day today. It's an extension of the nearby sea.

315
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,520
Speaker 2:  Her style of painting shows the influence of the French artists.

316
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,730
Speaker 2:  Then once it was set up, it also took the longest to finish. Your phone has

317
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,650
Speaker 2:  to be charging and not in use because all the training happens on your device

318
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,250
Speaker 2:  and takes up a huge amount of energy. I love that it happens on device. That's

319
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,090
Speaker 2:  good for privacy reasons, it's good for lots of reasons, but it does take

320
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,610
Speaker 2:  a while. So it took a couple of days, but I eventually had my voice ready

321
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,570
Speaker 2:  to go. Hi, I am David Pierce's, ai iPhone voice. I'm kind

322
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,450
Speaker 2:  of like David, but kind of not. Are we? Our phones? Are our phones

323
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,480
Speaker 2:  us Ordinarily, I think I would've been impressed by that,

324
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,800
Speaker 2:  but after hearing that 11 labs, one, I'm kind of meh on this

325
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,480
Speaker 2:  one. Let's try the Dwight TR test. 30 years later, I get a

326
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,400
Speaker 2:  postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the

327
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,360
Speaker 2:  story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the TRO cero.

328
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,240
Speaker 2:  She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover.

329
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,520
Speaker 2:  I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I

330
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,460
Speaker 2:  stashed the chandelier. Still pretty okay, right? It kind of works, but

331
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,340
Speaker 2:  nobody's gonna confuse this with human David and in general. I

332
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,940
Speaker 2:  actually think that might be okay.

333
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,660
Speaker 2:  AI voices are one of those things where the better they get the stranger

334
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,380
Speaker 2:  they get. Seriously, that feeling I got listening to the first time

335
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,980
Speaker 2:  11 labs spit out that thing saying I'm David Pierce was

336
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,860
Speaker 2:  genuinely kind of disconcerting. It raises all these big questions

337
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,740
Speaker 2:  that like with so many things about ai, we've really only begun

338
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,580
Speaker 2:  dealing with what does it mean that I can create a replica

339
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,180
Speaker 2:  this good and that they're only going to get better and easier over time?

340
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,220
Speaker 2:  What responsibilities do I have as the person who made it and is using it

341
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,540
Speaker 2:  even though it's my voice? What responsibilities do other people have?

342
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,860
Speaker 2:  What responsibilities do the services who make these voices for me have now

343
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,740
Speaker 2:  that they have this incredibly personal thing of mine on their

344
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,700
Speaker 2:  servers? We're having a lot of debates over AI music right now. Obviously

345
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,780
Speaker 2:  as artists', voices are being used to train models that can make pretty convincing

346
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,700
Speaker 2:  songs in just about anyone's voice. You go on YouTube and you can

347
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,660
Speaker 2:  hear AI Taylor Swift sing almost anything. You can hear ai Patrick from

348
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,620
Speaker 2:  SpongeBob sing almost anything. All of that is going to

349
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,500
Speaker 2:  spawn like a decade of interesting court cases and ethical debates.

350
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,780
Speaker 2:  But those same issues are coming just for you and me in our everyday lives.

351
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,980
Speaker 2:  How do we use these tools? How do we talk about the fact that they exist

352
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,540
Speaker 2:  and how we're using them? Is it even possible to get the good,

353
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,580
Speaker 2:  helpful, democratizing things from them without all the deep fakes

354
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,220
Speaker 2:  and downsides? I don't know, but I do know it's well past time

355
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,340
Speaker 2:  we started talking about it because the tech is really good right now and

356
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,100
Speaker 2:  it's getting better really fast.

357
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,700
Speaker 2:  Alright, that is enough AI talk for one day. We're gonna be back

358
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,500
Speaker 2:  next week to talk even more about AI music because I think that is one of

359
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,540
Speaker 2:  the most interesting things in this space right now. Not just because of

360
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,380
Speaker 2:  the big heady debates about it all, but because I think there are really

361
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,180
Speaker 2:  interesting ways that AI can both help people make music

362
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,180
Speaker 2:  and totally change all of our ideas about what music even

363
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,340
Speaker 2:  is. It's gonna be fascinating. We will also be back in

364
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,660
Speaker 2:  this feed on Wednesday too, with a big episode all about this week's Apple

380
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,390
Speaker 3:  cutting edge technologies, let alone knowing how to use them effectively.
