00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,520
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of non-exclusive distribution

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Speaker 2:  deals. I'm your friend David Pierce. It's about 5 25 in the

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,900
Speaker 2:  morning and I am out on a walk with my eight month old

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,310
Speaker 2:  son and my dog because somehow along the way they

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,280
Speaker 2:  conspired and colluded to decide that this is the time that we get up and

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,360
Speaker 2:  go for a walk. I would've picked a different time, but

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,260
Speaker 2:  unfortunately I didn't get a vote. So every morning we get up, Arthur

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,250
Speaker 2:  has a snack, and then naps in his stroller, Freeda sniffs every leaf within

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,760
Speaker 2:  eight miles of our house. And I listen to

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,450
Speaker 2:  podcasts, so if you make an incredibly long and kind of

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,440
Speaker 2:  wacky podcast, just know that I'm probably listening and

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,260
Speaker 2:  I love you for it. Anyway, speaking of wacky podcasts,

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,160
Speaker 2:  we have a great show for you today. We're gonna talk about sports, which

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,760
Speaker 2:  we don't do a ton of on this show, but I think at this moment in

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
Speaker 2:  time, if you want to understand what's going on in streaming and

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,310
Speaker 2:  maybe with the future of entertainment in general, one

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,940
Speaker 2:  good way to understand it is to look at a couple of things going on in sports.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,190
Speaker 2:  So we're gonna dig in and see if we can figure out where all this is headed.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,740
Speaker 2:  Then we're gonna talk to Alex Winter, who you might know as an actor from

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,480
Speaker 2:  the Bill and Ted movies, or as a director from things like the

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,440
Speaker 2:  Deep Web and the Panama Papers. He just directed a new documentary

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,160
Speaker 2:  called The YouTube Effect, all about basically what YouTube has done to the

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,440
Speaker 2:  world, good and bad, and he has some really interesting ideas and thoughts

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,880
Speaker 2:  about where it's all headed. So we're gonna talk to him about that too. All

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,800
Speaker 2:  that is coming up in just a sec, but I think, yeah, Arthur just fell

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,880
Speaker 2:  asleep in his stroller, so I have a little more walking to do, but I'll be

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,720
Speaker 2:  back in the studio in just a minute. This is The Vergecast. We'll see you

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,390
Speaker 2:  in a sec.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,730
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. I'm in the studio. I've had several gallons of

31
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,510
Speaker 2:  coffee, let's get to it. So You know how they say that porn

32
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,240
Speaker 2:  is the forefront of the internet. It's the place that a surprising amount

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,880
Speaker 2:  of technical innovation happens before it ever actually gets to the rest

34
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,540
Speaker 2:  of the web. That's also how I feel about sports and TV

35
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,410
Speaker 2:  sports are the most valuable, the most expensive, the most watched

36
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,150
Speaker 2:  thing on television. And so what happens in the sports media

37
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,720
Speaker 2:  landscape dictates a huge amount about how the whole

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,600
Speaker 2:  entertainment world actually works. And the sports watching world is

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,480
Speaker 2:  in an unusual amount of fluxx right now. There's a lot going

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,280
Speaker 2:  on here, and I promise you don't have to be a sports fan to understand all

41
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,240
Speaker 2:  the stuff we're about to get into or care about what happens to ESPN because

42
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,100
Speaker 2:  this stuff matters to everybody. That's kind of the whole point.

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,210
Speaker 2:  You could make the case that what happens to ESPN will affect

44
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,660
Speaker 2:  everything everyone watches for a long time to come.

45
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,980
Speaker 2:  Anyway, we should sort through this all. So I grabbed the Verges, Richard

46
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,840
Speaker 2:  Lawler and my co-host Neli Patel to talk all of this through. Oh, but

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,740
Speaker 2:  before I bring them in a quick thing, we recorded this a few days

48
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,600
Speaker 2:  ago, and just to prove how fast this is all moving, a few things

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,440
Speaker 2:  have already changed since we chatted. We talk a bit in the

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,120
Speaker 2:  conversation. You're gonna hear about ESPN being reluctant to get into

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,800
Speaker 2:  betting, which it has been for a long time. Well, ESPN is now into

52
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,580
Speaker 2:  betting. It signed a big deal with Pen Entertainment to launch a gambling

53
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,080
Speaker 2:  app called ESPN Bet that's gonna be interesting to watch in the coming

54
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,040
Speaker 2:  months. Disney also just released earnings, which were pretty mixed this

55
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,900
Speaker 2:  quarter. One big thing that happened was that Disney plus subscribers were

56
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,880
Speaker 2:  way down in India in large part because Disney lost the rights to Indian

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,800
Speaker 2:  Premier League. Cricket matches sports. I'm telling you, they dictate

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,480
Speaker 2:  everything. Like I said, this is all changing really fast and however it

59
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,000
Speaker 2:  shakes out, the future of sports will have a lot to say about the future

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,980
Speaker 2:  of entertainment. So let's just get into it. Richard Lawler. Hello.

61
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,780
Speaker 2:  Hey, NELI. Hello. Hey, there are these two things going

62
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,160
Speaker 2:  on. There's a big story about the future of ESPN and there's a big story

63
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,400
Speaker 2:  about the future of college football that the three of us have been following

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,190
Speaker 2:  a lot over the last few weeks. And I think it turns out that those two stories

65
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,020
Speaker 2:  between them kind of tell the whole story

66
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,630
Speaker 2:  of what's happening in the streaming business and kind of like in the

67
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,060
Speaker 2:  tech industry and in the whole world of entertainment right now.

68
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,910
Speaker 2:  So I wanna both like explain what's going on and see if we can figure out

69
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,640
Speaker 2:  what to make of it. Does that make sense? Does this sound good? Am I, am

70
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,360
Speaker 2:  I totally insane here? How do we feel?

71
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,500
Speaker 6:  I think your goal to try to explain what's going on in college football

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,460
Speaker 6:  is optimistic, doomed, perhaps

73
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,280
Speaker 6:  doomed, but confident. And I've always appreciated your confidence,

74
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,590
Speaker 6:  David.

75
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,320
Speaker 2:  Well, the good news is I have decided to foist this goal upon

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,260
Speaker 2:  Richard

77
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,960
Speaker 7:  And I have been waiting. Yeah,

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,100
Speaker 2:  You have been in a Slack thread. Just drop in tweets for like two weeks now.

79
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,710
Speaker 2:  So now, now is your moment. Explain to us what's happening in college football.

80
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,600
Speaker 7:  This is the only thing that I wanna talk about because I think what it

81
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,320
Speaker 7:  comes down to is that crypto killed the PAC

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,200
Speaker 7:  12. Oh God. And not in the way that you would've thought like a year

83
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,670
Speaker 7:  ago. Like I thought that crypto would kill

84
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,000
Speaker 7:  college football because we would have too many shady sponsors giving kids

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,580
Speaker 7:  money that they didn't know the source of. And like everybody went to jail.

86
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,820
Speaker 7:  And I was wrong. I, I will admit it, I was wrong about crypto.

87
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,930
Speaker 2:  You're not wrong yet. There's still time on that one

88
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,710
Speaker 7:  Could happen. But in case you don't remember, the economy went

89
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,640
Speaker 7:  kind of bad last year. A lot of big companies had to kind

90
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,580
Speaker 7:  of reevaluate their plans. Banks crashed. It was a whole thing.

91
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,880
Speaker 7:  We came through it. The bad news is not everyone is spending money like they

92
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,440
Speaker 7:  were kind of thinking that they would two years ago. And how does that connect

93
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,840
Speaker 7:  to college football? Because when you look at these conferences, they sign

94
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Speaker 7:  their TV rights deals years in advance. And what happened to the PAC

95
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,620
Speaker 7:  12 specifically is that last year they were kind of in line to

96
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,360
Speaker 7:  You know renegotiate their TV broadcast deal, I think starting for like 2024

97
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,270
Speaker 7:  or 2025 and on. And what they expected,

98
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,960
Speaker 7:  they, they had some decent offers on the table from the various broadcast

99
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,920
Speaker 7:  networks you have like the CCBs to Fox, the the ESPNs and whatever bidding

100
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,910
Speaker 7:  against each other. But they didn't set up a deal at that time because

101
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,320
Speaker 7:  they were looking at it. They thought that maybe they could get a better

102
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,150
Speaker 7:  deal in a year from someone like Disney, from like Disney and

103
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,920
Speaker 7:  ESPN bidding against someone like Amazon. However, back to

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,800
Speaker 7:  that home economic upset thing that I talked about, and all

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,920
Speaker 7:  the big tech companies suddenly tightening their, their wallets and those

106
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,380
Speaker 7:  offers weren't there this year. And so when the various college presidents

107
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,180
Speaker 7:  met You know specifically for the PAC 12 to look at their deal, they got

108
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,980
Speaker 7:  an offer and the best offer they got apparently, according to reports from

109
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,740
Speaker 7:  You know C N B C Sports Business Journal and others was from Apple

110
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,480
Speaker 7:  tv. And Apple was trying to set up a deal sort of like it has for m l s

111
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,400
Speaker 7:  where they agreed to pay a certain amount and they agreed to pay more if

112
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,640
Speaker 7:  they get a certain number of subscribers to add this, this particular sports

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,600
Speaker 7:  package onto their Apple TV plus subscription, which is great, but

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,740
Speaker 7:  it's risky because if enough people don't add it, you don't get all the money.

115
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,840
Speaker 7:  And so the, the presidents were like, yeah, no, we need to be on linear TV

116
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,920
Speaker 7:  because that's what recruits have and recruits want to be on the networks

117
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,420
Speaker 7:  that their parents have so they can play there so that you can recruit kids

118
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,060
Speaker 7:  to be good so that people wanna watch your games. And it's a whole snowball

119
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,700
Speaker 7:  effect.

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,150
Speaker 6:  Can I just pause there that colleges believe

121
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,530
Speaker 6:  that teenagers across America have linear tv.

122
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,280
Speaker 7:  Their grandparents, their grandparents do their

123
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,520
Speaker 6:  Grandparents. All right, that's fine. I just wanna, I wanna circle that because

124
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,110
Speaker 6:  that's important.

125
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,200
Speaker 2:  There's a twist on that that I, I've been reading a bunch about that I was

126
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Speaker 2:  gonna bring up later. But I, I think is, is really interesting and worth

127
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Speaker 2:  mentioning, and this is another piece of like the technical chaos that we're

128
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,660
Speaker 2:  going through right now is these name, image and likeness rights. So

129
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,640
Speaker 2:  as of very recently, players can now benefit from their name,

130
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,070
Speaker 2:  image, and likeness. They can get sponsorship deals. And one of the things

131
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,780
Speaker 2:  that universities and like students are saying

132
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,560
Speaker 2:  is we want the best players and what the best players want is the best

133
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,160
Speaker 2:  distribution because if they are on the things they get watched the most,

134
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,940
Speaker 2:  they'll get more money in their n I L deals.

135
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,040
Speaker 2:  So the kids who want the most money will go to the schools that have the

136
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,920
Speaker 2:  most distribution, which will mean that they get more good kids to

137
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,880
Speaker 2:  come. And so it becomes this crazy spiraling thing where it's like, if we

138
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,600
Speaker 2:  just get a lot of TV ratings, we're gonna get good players because that's

139
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,130
Speaker 2:  how the players make more money. And it just like spins in this insane circle

140
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,920
Speaker 2:  where suddenly being on linear TV means more money for

141
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,280
Speaker 2:  college football players. And it just like, it just blows my mind in a whole

142
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,640
Speaker 2:  bunch of different directions as, as this is going. But so Richard back to

143
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,780
Speaker 2:  the story here. So basically what this has led to is like the entirety of

144
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,160
Speaker 2:  the college football universe has like exploded into a thousand pieces over

145
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,580
Speaker 2:  the last two weeks.

146
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,360
Speaker 7:  So the landscape of college football, of college sports has changed. We've

147
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,520
Speaker 7:  been, we've gotten used to the kind of the conference system. We know what

148
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,400
Speaker 7:  the big ones are and now there's a few less of those big ones.

149
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,250
Speaker 7:  The PAC 12 is basically gone, it's down to four teams after this year.

150
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,240
Speaker 7:  We'll see if it survives or, or if those teams stick around or, or bring

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,000
Speaker 7:  in some new teams. The A c C could be next. So you're gonna end up with kind

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,260
Speaker 7:  of the big 10, the big 12, the s e c. And

153
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,300
Speaker 6:  Can we, can we just back up for one second? I, I grew up, I went to a big

154
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,000
Speaker 6:  10 school that was the center of my universe for like a

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,980
Speaker 6:  minute. But I think most people don't understand that the conferences

156
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,820
Speaker 6:  and college sports are the, they're like

157
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,510
Speaker 6:  how the competition between the colleges is organized. So

158
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,120
Speaker 6:  there's a conference like the Big 10 and it goes and

159
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,040
Speaker 6:  negotiates her TV rights and money and it splits those up against all the

160
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,440
Speaker 6:  schools in the Big 10. And what's happening is the smaller conferences are

161
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
Speaker 6:  going away and the bigger conferences are getting bigger and there's fewer

162
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,150
Speaker 6:  of them so that they can go negotiate for more money

163
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,360
Speaker 6:  from a smaller pool. Is that what that's what it feels like is happening

164
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,190
Speaker 6:  to me.

165
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,310
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And and that is exactly what's happening that you and especially because

166
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,160
Speaker 7:  they want more geographic reach, they want more alumni reach, they

167
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,140
Speaker 7:  want to be able to negotiate better deals and being able to have teams in,

168
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,760
Speaker 7:  for example, Los Angeles for the Big 10 now means that you can negotiate

169
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,240
Speaker 7:  for much more money because you have teams in New York and Los Angeles that

170
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,060
Speaker 7:  doesn't make sense in terms of competition or location or history or heritage

171
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,040
Speaker 7:  or anything like that. But it does make sense in terms of money. So, so that's

172
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,640
Speaker 7:  why, why they're doing that and also why they can't count because they haven't

173
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,320
Speaker 7:  had 10 teams for a long time. It's like a

174
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,950
Speaker 6:  Long time.

175
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The Big 10 is gonna be 18 teams just to deal with that. But yeah,

176
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,680
Speaker 2:  I think to your point, this used to be and was for a long time like

177
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,140
Speaker 2:  a regional thing, right? Like I'm in Virginia, which is a c C country

178
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,813
Speaker 2:  and here it's a lot of schools from Virginia and North Carolina and South

179
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:16,790
Speaker 2:  Carolina and Georgia and all these teams are kind of centered around

180
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,840
Speaker 2:  each other. And the idea was like, those are the rivalries. So these teams

181
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,680
Speaker 2:  have been playing each other for decades. That's like all the teams that

182
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,580
Speaker 2:  your college hates are probably the ones in your conference. And now as

183
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,560
Speaker 2:  far as I can tell, the whole reason this is all getting blown up is

184
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
Speaker 2:  because these teams are chasing the big TV deals that

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,680
Speaker 2:  already exist that got made before the economy turned around.

186
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,440
Speaker 2:  Richard. Is it more complicated than that? It really feels like if

187
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,960
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm looking around and I'm saying, oh, there's a whole lot of money

188
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,200
Speaker 2:  going to the big 10 every year. If I go to the Big 10, I will get a slice

189
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,030
Speaker 2:  of that. If I say in the PAC 12 where the deal is up next year,

190
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,720
Speaker 2:  that deal is probably going to be a lot smaller. Smaller because the business

191
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,360
Speaker 2:  looks a lot worse than it used to.

192
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,940
Speaker 7:  I think that's true, but I, I think it's a little more complicated than that.

193
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,400
Speaker 7:  And sometimes I'm not sure that I get it myself because I'm looking at the

194
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,320
Speaker 7:  way that these leagues look and I think they're still operating under the

195
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,140
Speaker 7:  idea that they're going to be able to get big deals from the tech companies

196
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,100
Speaker 7:  to, to compete with whoever's left in traditional tv and that that that money

197
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,040
Speaker 7:  is kind of still going to be there, but just by getting bigger, that is

198
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,800
Speaker 7:  the way that you get more money and by being part of the, the bigger whole

199
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,320
Speaker 7:  and that that really is kind of how it has always worked. That's why the

200
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,080
Speaker 7:  Big 10 has had schools. That's why Michigan and Ohio State deal with

201
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,190
Speaker 7:  Iowa and Minnesota.

202
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,310
Speaker 6:  It's rough.

203
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,800
Speaker 2:  Richard

204
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,960
Speaker 6:  Lives in Michigan. I think it's important for everyone on this podcast to

205
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,520
Speaker 6:  know that Richard lives in Michigan. If

206
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,340
Speaker 2:  You're from Iowa or Minnesota, just know that we, we love you too. We,

207
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,700
Speaker 7:  We love you. You just don't have that many people who watch tv.

208
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,760
Speaker 6:  But no, this, this gets to harder the matter actually that statement, not

209
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Speaker 6:  a lot of people watch TV because when you, when you were regional, right?

210
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,740
Speaker 6:  You had regional sports networks, so you had no choice if you wanted tv

211
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,320
Speaker 6:  but to sign up for your local cable system or put up an antenna that was

212
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,000
Speaker 6:  the eighties, right? Those are your two choices. And that meant the cable

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,980
Speaker 6:  system could go and sign a deal with the Big 10, distribute

214
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,960
Speaker 6:  big 10 games. And it was unlikely that they needed a deal to

215
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,760
Speaker 6:  go distribute PAC 10 games because it was unlikely that people in the

216
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
Speaker 6:  Midwest wanted to watch college football from the west coast. And when they

217
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,820
Speaker 6:  did, it was national games and there was a lot of money involved for everybody.

218
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,760
Speaker 6:  Now that's broken, right? If you wanna watch anything, you have the

219
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,120
Speaker 6:  internet which destroys that regional scarcity, which has made

220
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,760
Speaker 6:  everything vastly cheaper. And those regional

221
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,680
Speaker 6:  cable companies are no longer the wealthy middlemen in

222
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,240
Speaker 6:  the middle of all of this. And in fact, their television

223
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,180
Speaker 6:  distribution business is headed inevitably to zero.

224
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,720
Speaker 6:  And particularly over the pandemic seems to have taken a lot of shocks, bringing

225
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,600
Speaker 6:  it closer to zero in a way that no one's even denying it anymore. Like maybe

226
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,460
Speaker 6:  five or 10 years ago people would deny cord cutting was a thing

227
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,300
Speaker 6:  and that's over. And so now what you have is, okay, maybe Apple or

228
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,240
Speaker 6:  Amazon has the pockets to support these kinds of TV deals.

229
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,620
Speaker 6:  Richard, your point is they don't seem that interested in it.

230
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,280
Speaker 7:  No. And and like Apple of course we know that Apple has basically infinite

231
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,400
Speaker 7:  money. They could spend whatever they want to get a PAC 12 deal. They just

232
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,560
Speaker 7:  don't want to and they don't have to, right? And so they're like, we'll,

233
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,130
Speaker 7:  we'll give you a deal where maybe if you attract enough viewers,

234
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,800
Speaker 6:  Apple famously did not buy Sunday ticket, which is actually

235
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,680
Speaker 6:  like a crown jewel sports streaming package. And they didn't

236
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,520
Speaker 6:  do it. They were right. They were in the, the driver's seat. They were gonna

237
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,160
Speaker 6:  take it and then they didn't go. Something happened between Apple and the

238
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,870
Speaker 6:  N F L and the N F L went with Google, which is a much

239
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,190
Speaker 6:  more normal cable deal on YouTube tv.

240
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,500
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think the example there is actually really instructive because

241
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,640
Speaker 2:  one of the things that it broke down. Do you remember that whole kerfuffle

242
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,400
Speaker 2:  about how the deal broke down over VR rights? Yeah. What, what

243
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,320
Speaker 2:  Apple wants from these companies is basically complete control, right? Like

244
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,960
Speaker 2:  what the m l s gave to Apple was everything for

245
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,920
Speaker 6:  $250 million

246
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,400
Speaker 2:  A year, which was like a multiple of what the, the MLS had gotten before.

247
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,520
Speaker 2:  So it was a huge number, but Apple now completely

248
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,400
Speaker 2:  controls the ML S'S broadcast. If you wanna watch the

249
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Speaker 2:  ML s, you are going to subscribe to Apple. Which is why when Lion o

250
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,320
Speaker 2:  Messi the best soccer player in the world went to the M L s, apple reportedly

251
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,160
Speaker 2:  like gave, it gave messy a special deal to be part of that

252
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,020
Speaker 2:  because it was a win for the M L s, which is directly a big win for Apple.

253
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,270
Speaker 2:  That's where we get to the ESPN side of this, which I think is the other

254
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,120
Speaker 2:  half of what's happening right now, which is ESPN more than any other

255
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,880
Speaker 2:  single company is the one paying all of that money and, and has

256
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,840
Speaker 2:  essentially in a lot of ways run out or

257
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,680
Speaker 2:  is starting to run out because of what you were just talking about Eli. We

258
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,080
Speaker 2:  were At this point a few years ago where everybody was kind of looking at

259
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,180
Speaker 2:  the cable business going, eventually this will

260
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,800
Speaker 2:  die. A lot of people subscribe to cable. That number is slowly dwindling.

261
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,480
Speaker 2:  There's still a lot of money in it. Someday in the future we're gonna have

262
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,440
Speaker 2:  to worry about what that transition looks like. That day in the future came

263
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,820
Speaker 2:  much faster I think, than anybody expected. And we are like deep in the thick

264
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,540
Speaker 2:  of everyone is canceling cable right now.

265
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,280
Speaker 6:  You know what's, what's fascinating for me is all of that is based on

266
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,440
Speaker 6:  physical scarcity. I love ranting about competition on the show. I will,

267
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,040
Speaker 6:  I will try not to do it too much. But you were stuck with Time

268
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,620
Speaker 6:  Warner or Comcast or whoever because they had the actual wires in the ground

269
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,080
Speaker 6:  to your house. Yep. And that that meant that they could do whatever they

270
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,600
Speaker 6:  wanted. Disclosure Comcast and the investor in the last meeting,

271
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,680
Speaker 2:  Whatever. And we all like football. That's a disclosure I guess. Yeah.

272
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,320
Speaker 7:  I have not watched football in years. It's too dangerous. Yeah.

273
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,800
Speaker 6:  'cause the lions do No, no it's

274
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,600
Speaker 7:  Not because the lions suck. That's not, that's not it. They've won a

275
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,230
Speaker 7:  playoff game in my lifetime.

276
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,200
Speaker 6:  They're never gonna win again. Jordan left forever. The end of the, the story

277
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,790
Speaker 6:  here is the scarcity went away and we have

278
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,520
Speaker 6:  basically rebuilt all these cable bundles, right? YouTube TV is a cable

279
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,970
Speaker 6:  bundle. Hulu with live TV is a cable bundle, whatever. But the

280
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,840
Speaker 6:  cable companies utterly failed to do that for their

281
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,600
Speaker 6:  customers. I think this market looks different. If there was a

282
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,360
Speaker 6:  great Xfinity app or there was a great Time Warner app and

283
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,780
Speaker 6:  that's where you were still getting your programming from and they were competing

284
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,740
Speaker 6:  and they just blew it and now there's YouTube tv and YouTube

285
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,430
Speaker 6:  TV is national. That might be the pot of money. It is

286
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,080
Speaker 6:  growing really fast. David's reported on that. And it just seems like

287
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,880
Speaker 6:  there's an opportunity here for like people like bundles

288
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,840
Speaker 6:  like it signing up for different streaming services sucks. And no one

289
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,480
Speaker 6:  has really seizes that moment except for YouTube tv, which is becoming more

290
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,990
Speaker 6:  and more just a very standard cable package.

291
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,780
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I saw this amazing tweet the other day from, it was River

292
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,620
Speaker 2:  AAV Blues tweeted it. It said you have to subscribe to four different services

293
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,220
Speaker 2:  to watch the next five Yankees game Sunday Peacock

294
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,830
Speaker 2:  Monday off day Tuesday, the Yes Network, which is the regional Yankees network.

295
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,590
Speaker 2:  Wednesday, Amazon Prime Video. Thursday. Yes, Friday Apple TV

296
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,520
Speaker 2:  plus like that is deranged. Like that is not how any of this is

297
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,200
Speaker 2:  supposed to work. And there are a lot of people who continue

298
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,850
Speaker 2:  to subscribe to Cable just because it is the best, best place to get sports,

299
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,280
Speaker 2:  right? Like that is and has been for a long time. The best reason to have

300
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
Speaker 2:  cable is if you're a sports fan because it's gonna have the most stuff for

301
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,080
Speaker 2:  frankly the lowest price and it's all in one place. And that's very useful.

302
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,560
Speaker 2:  And that's what a lot of these other bundles like YouTube TV are building

303
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,880
Speaker 2:  towards, right? Like that's why YouTube spent all that money on Sunday ticket.

304
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,680
Speaker 2:  It's reportedly paying $2 billion a year. Yep. And it's because if you can

305
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,510
Speaker 2:  have a good sports package, people will pay a lot of money for it. But

306
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,880
Speaker 2:  ESPN, I think more than almost anybody is stuck in this really

307
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,760
Speaker 2:  complicated place where sports is still a really

308
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,560
Speaker 2:  good business on cable tv. ESPN is still wildly profitable. It has been funding

309
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,520
Speaker 2:  Disney for years and it still makes a lot of money. But that

310
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,440
Speaker 2:  number is going down, it's going down really fast. And

311
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,400
Speaker 2:  ESPN is now at a point where it has been pretty publicly saying that at some

312
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,310
Speaker 2:  point we're gonna go direct to consumer with flagship ESPN, right?

313
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,880
Speaker 2:  ESPN Plus exists, it's mostly like little sports and documentaries and people

314
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,540
Speaker 2:  don't really care. But like the thing will be when like all

315
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,040
Speaker 2:  of the big sports that ESPN pays billions of dollars for like the

316
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,820
Speaker 2:  college football stuff that we're talking about moves exclusively

317
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,300
Speaker 2:  to streaming. And if ESPN does that, they're walking away from this gigantic

318
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,560
Speaker 2:  pot of money that is the cable business. And if it does that, it will kill

319
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,400
Speaker 2:  the rest of the cable business because all the people who watch sports will

320
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,600
Speaker 2:  no longer wanna be there. So it stuck in this place and like Bob Iger did

321
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,560
Speaker 2:  this interview with C N B C where it, it sort of just sounds like they're

322
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,310
Speaker 2:  throwing up their hands at me like we have no idea what to do here.

323
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,000
Speaker 6:  That interview that Iger did with C N B C and people should go watch it,

324
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,470
Speaker 6:  it's recent. He talked about the strikes. Every answer was like a

325
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,680
Speaker 6:  nuclear bomb that went off.

326
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Speaker 2:  It really

327
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,760
Speaker 6:  Was. I suspect we'll not be hearing from Bob Iger again for some time, but

328
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,490
Speaker 6:  his answer about ESPN was eventually we'll go direct to consumer. His answer

329
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,440
Speaker 6:  about whether Disney should sell parts of itself were yes, eventually

330
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,040
Speaker 6:  we should sell parts of our linear, other linear networks because we need

331
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,980
Speaker 6:  to become a new kind of company. And what has funded

332
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,950
Speaker 6:  all of Disney this whole time has been ESPN, Disney

333
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,920
Speaker 6:  owns Marvel, Disney owns Fox and the rest of the Marvel universe,

334
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,740
Speaker 6:  all the stuff that Disney bought, Lucasfilm, all of that was funded

335
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,870
Speaker 6:  by excess cash from ESPN. And in that number coming

336
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,840
Speaker 6:  down has made it so that boy Marvel needs to make a lot of money all

337
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,520
Speaker 6:  the time. And like you can see how they got to, we'll just flood

338
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,350
Speaker 6:  Disney Plus with Marvel stuff because they were watching the ESPN cable revenue

339
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,740
Speaker 6:  come down and they needed all those subscribers to go to Disney Plus

340
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,640
Speaker 2:  And they're just not going to, and even if they do, the finances don't seem

341
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,860
Speaker 2:  like they work. Yeah.

342
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,280
Speaker 7:  And and I think that's one of the, the main things is that really none of

343
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,240
Speaker 7:  the math works on this for ESPN, for Disney, for streaming, for all of

344
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,280
Speaker 7:  it. And no one is quite sure what's going to happen in the future. And when

345
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,600
Speaker 7:  you look at ESPN, people have said, oh, I would love to have ESPN and be

346
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,280
Speaker 7:  able to get that without cable. In the future, if and when it happens, you

347
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,060
Speaker 7:  might be paying like 30, 40 bucks a month for e, for just ESPN.

348
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,300
Speaker 7:  So

349
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,800
Speaker 6:  Let me, here, I'll throw this out there. Lemme spin out a version of the

350
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,320
Speaker 6:  future for you Richard. You get to a place where it

351
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,010
Speaker 6:  is nonsensical for YouTube tv,

352
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,960
Speaker 6:  let's say to have lifestyle programming on it. Anything

353
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,660
Speaker 6:  that is not time sensitive, right? It is nonsensical

354
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,600
Speaker 6:  for M T V to exist showing episodes of ridiculousness all

355
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,340
Speaker 6:  day and all night.

356
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,840
Speaker 2:  You end up basically being like sports news in the Oscars, right?

357
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,400
Speaker 6:  It's just live stuff. Like basically YouTube TV is there for things that

358
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,960
Speaker 6:  are really important when they're live and that is basically like the news

359
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,590
Speaker 6:  networks, sports programming and award shows.

360
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

361
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,680
Speaker 7:  Remember those bad shows on sci-fi network? Yeah. You're not gonna have any

362
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,460
Speaker 7:  more of those. Well,

363
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,080
Speaker 6:  But you can see how that there's pressure on the system.

364
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,820
Speaker 6:  Like I think if you pulled any listen and said what, what would you pay for

365
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,490
Speaker 6:  on a cable system? It's like that list in some order of priority,

366
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,400
Speaker 6:  right? Things that are live, there's, we've lost another plane and

367
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,600
Speaker 6:  C N N is gonna go wall-to-wall coverage on planes and

368
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,640
Speaker 6:  submarines and you just need that thing. You just gotta flip it on. It's

369
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,720
Speaker 6:  there, it's the Super Bowl. You need to flip it on. It's there. Everything

370
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,160
Speaker 6:  else moves to constellation of streaming

371
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,670
Speaker 6:  services. Like the future of Max is a streaming service

372
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,080
Speaker 6:  appears to be reality tv, right? Like that's what David SLO

373
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,960
Speaker 6:  wants. You get to that split and maybe that's fine. It just seems

374
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,680
Speaker 6:  like no one can get out of their way or leave the money on the

375
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,640
Speaker 6:  table to get to that end point. Like I would happily pay for

376
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,590
Speaker 6:  a YouTube TV that was cheaper and totally focused on live coverage.

377
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,500
Speaker 6:  It's the other way around than it used to be, right? You would pay for ESPN

378
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,640
Speaker 6:  and you would get like C n N along for the ride and people would be like,

379
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,600
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna pay for all these channels I don't need, it's just the order

380
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,360
Speaker 6:  of what channels you don't need has radically changed because now

381
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,120
Speaker 6:  you're prioritizing live stuff.

382
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,100
Speaker 2:  I sort of buy that theory and I think to some extent that is kind of

383
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,650
Speaker 2:  the world Disney is hoping comes to fruition, right? That

384
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,540
Speaker 2:  eventually ESPN Plus can get all the best stuff that's

385
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,520
Speaker 2:  on ESPN. A, B, C is a thing that Disney owns and doesn't know what

386
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,840
Speaker 2:  to do with. It gets a lot of the news coverage and award shows. Like that's

387
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,560
Speaker 2:  kind of what Max is talking about doing with C n N. There's like, there's

388
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,400
Speaker 2:  a version in which you can put those things together in a way that kind of

389
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,110
Speaker 2:  makes sense. I just think you'd have to charge so much money for it

390
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,000
Speaker 2:  that you wouldn't get nearly the number of people you need to make that

391
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,340
Speaker 2:  financially work.

392
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,360
Speaker 7:  And that's really the issue is like how, how do you make, how do you make

393
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,180
Speaker 7:  it work? Because the magic of ESPN and it its magic money pile

394
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,570
Speaker 7:  was that it was getting like 10, $15 a month from every single

395
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,080
Speaker 7:  cable subscriber in the United States.

396
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,080
Speaker 2:  A hundred million people at one point. Whether they watched sports or not,

397
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,200
Speaker 2:  were just giving that to ESPN every month. Didn't

398
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,140
Speaker 7:  Matter. And it was that money was actually making everything else go.

399
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,060
Speaker 7:  And so when you suddenly take that out, when you don't have that ESPN

400
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,980
Speaker 7:  in kind of any package, if it's by itself, if it's in the Disney bundle

401
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,960
Speaker 7:  or wherever, it's not propping everything else up. So how much is there

402
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,640
Speaker 7:  to pay for? How much is there to pay for ESPN? How much is there to pay for

403
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,360
Speaker 7:  everything else? How does it get balanced out? You have Max, they've been

404
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,080
Speaker 7:  talking over the last few days really about their sports programming that

405
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,520
Speaker 7:  they hope to build up. You've had Netflix, they're going to broadcast this

406
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Speaker 7:  weird, or at least they were before the strike planning to broadcast this

407
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,360
Speaker 7:  weird like, like celebrity sports tournament as maybe they get into

408
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,960
Speaker 7:  sports because there was a report they bid for F one, so they, they probably

409
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,980
Speaker 7:  bid for something else. Apple tv, we know that they're doing sports deals.

410
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,760
Speaker 7:  But do you do those as a part of your main package or as an add-on and

411
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,040
Speaker 7:  people don't get the add-ons like, like we already know that. So how much

412
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,110
Speaker 7:  money is there really?

413
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,080
Speaker 2:  Well and this, this is where we go back to the college football thing is

414
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,960
Speaker 2:  college football people don't want a Netflix deal. Like they would

415
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,320
Speaker 2:  take it as part of another bigger deal, but they don't want that deal because

416
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,280
Speaker 2:  they want to be on linear television. They want to be in the biggest places

417
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,520
Speaker 2:  that people are watching. And even if there was a quote that I think it was

418
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,880
Speaker 2:  the president of the University of Washington gave to ESPN right after all

419
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,280
Speaker 2:  the PAC 12 stuff broke down where he was basically like Apple TV doesn't

420
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,320
Speaker 2:  give us enough reach. They could give us all the money in the known universe,

421
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,080
Speaker 2:  right? They don't give us enough reach And, and this is like, this is sort

422
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,140
Speaker 2:  of the story of the whole business right now. I was listening to the podcast,

423
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,640
Speaker 2:  the Town which is Pucks, Matt, Melanie, it's a really great podcast about

424
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,210
Speaker 2:  all things like the entertainment business. And he was talking to Rich Greenfield

425
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,080
Speaker 2:  who's an a very smart analyst on this stuff. And Rich's big theory was

426
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,880
Speaker 2:  that what every other content maker should do is have the

427
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,720
Speaker 2:  first run of their shows on Netflix. Because Netflix has the

428
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,560
Speaker 2:  biggest distribution. And if you want your IP to work, if you want stuff

429
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,420
Speaker 2:  to merchandise like Disney because it needs people to care about

430
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,120
Speaker 2:  its characters and watch them and see them and go care about the rides and

431
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,200
Speaker 2:  buy their toys, should actually be putting its stuff on Netflix before it

432
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,560
Speaker 2:  puts it on Disney Plus. And that's never gonna happen. But I actually think

433
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,680
Speaker 2:  is an incredibly interesting point that

434
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,540
Speaker 6:  Is bonkers.

435
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,360
Speaker 2:  It will never happen for a million reasons. But in the sense that it's like

436
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,280
Speaker 2:  if what I want is for people to care about my shows, it actually makes a

437
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,880
Speaker 2:  lot of sense that you should put them in the place where most people will

438
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,760
Speaker 2:  see them. And so for the football and sports people in general who

439
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,200
Speaker 2:  hold all the cards in all of these negotiations because they are the live

440
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,160
Speaker 2:  thing that people care about, increasingly like the only one, they're just

441
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,100
Speaker 2:  gonna go where the biggest audience is. And this has been ESPN's problem.

442
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,800
Speaker 2:  If it cancels its cable network and just goes to streaming, it will stop

443
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,480
Speaker 2:  getting these deals. Even if it has all the money in the world, it will stop

444
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,320
Speaker 2:  getting these deals because it loses the size and scope of

445
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,960
Speaker 2:  what it can offer. And so like that's just another reason that it's like

446
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,420
Speaker 2:  what do you even do?

447
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,700
Speaker 6:  So there, there's another piece to this, which I think is important to note.

448
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,180
Speaker 6:  The big tech companies suck at broadcasting sports.

449
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,720
Speaker 6:  Yes. Watching a football game, being broadcast by Amazon is a

450
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Speaker 6:  chore. Not only because for whatever reason

451
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,760
Speaker 6:  Karmically, they get the worst football games in like broadcast

452
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,240
Speaker 6:  history last season, some of the worst games ever played were on

453
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,040
Speaker 6:  Amazon. That's not Amazon's fault. I'm just saying that's karma. They're

454
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,010
Speaker 6:  also just not good at it yet. Right? The pageantry of a

455
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,440
Speaker 6:  major national broadcast football game is a

456
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,070
Speaker 6:  thing that helps those athletes get their endorsement deals.

457
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,800
Speaker 6:  That is the scaffolding for the big advertisers to come

458
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,910
Speaker 6:  in and put big fancy ads next to premium

459
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,440
Speaker 6:  programming. And you look at a baseball game on Apple, they've gotten a little

460
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,000
Speaker 6:  bit better but's, still a pretty low rent operation, for example. They're

461
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,900
Speaker 6:  not in four K yet. Just putting that out there, that's, it's amazing to me.

462
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,400
Speaker 6:  You look at Amazon, Amazon is ready to broadcast those games in four K. They

463
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,480
Speaker 6:  own an entire streaming service that can do it. They haven't done it yet.

464
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,880
Speaker 6:  Maybe they'll do it this season. And they're You know they're not paying

465
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,740
Speaker 6:  the money for the biggest name broadcasters like

466
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,260
Speaker 6:  the Troy Aikman's and Joe Bucks of the world are they're, they're

467
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,920
Speaker 6:  on ESPN, right? They're doing Monday Night football on ESPN because that

468
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,420
Speaker 6:  is the best distribution for them. I mean Al Michael's basically retired

469
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,120
Speaker 6:  to Amazon. It's like more or less, yeah, he seems very bored. It,

470
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,600
Speaker 6:  there's just a piece of that puzzle where there's a product to be made here.

471
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,360
Speaker 6:  There's a literal show to be put on. And the

472
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,320
Speaker 6:  athletes and the coaches and the owners of the teams and the people who run

473
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,240
Speaker 6:  the conferences, they wanna be part of the fanciest show. And the tech

474
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,920
Speaker 6:  companies bizarrely have, they paid a lot of money and they're kind of cheaping

475
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,360
Speaker 6:  out on the show part of it, which is fascinating to me. They don't know how

476
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,480
Speaker 6:  to

477
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,320
Speaker 7:  Build the stage. Yeah, like, like that. That's a skill and, and something

478
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,160
Speaker 7:  that is, has been built up in these networks over the years, they, they just

479
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,400
Speaker 7:  have the institutional knowledge and the people to build the stage. And I

480
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,200
Speaker 7:  think that what David mentioned about like reach, it's not just like what

481
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,560
Speaker 7:  you think of like, oh they have x number of viewers when they're talking

482
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,600
Speaker 7:  about reach, especially for these college presidents who run these high,

483
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,580
Speaker 7:  these high profile universities who want to be seen, who want to be on

484
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,380
Speaker 7:  on that top level. It's that ESPN and linear TV

485
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,280
Speaker 7:  is just on and it's everywhere. And when you're on there, it

486
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,640
Speaker 7:  means that everyone is going to see you every week and they're never going

487
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,520
Speaker 7:  to forget about your university, university of Western, blah blah

488
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,880
Speaker 7:  blah is very important. And you've heard of it and you've heard of it your

489
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,980
Speaker 7:  whole life and You know it because they had a good football team 15 years

490
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,630
Speaker 7:  ago and if they're on Apple tv, that doesn't happen. The, I think the other

491
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,080
Speaker 7:  part of what, what you mentioned when you talked about like Disney and going

492
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,040
Speaker 7:  on Netflix for the first season, like Formula One I think is a great example

493
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,000
Speaker 7:  of that because they had that drive to survive that boosted the profile of

494
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,280
Speaker 7:  the sport in the United States because so many people have Netflix and they

495
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,660
Speaker 7:  started watching this sport that they've never paid attention to because

496
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,560
Speaker 7:  it comes on at 3:00 AM And they were like, actually I love this and I need

497
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,640
Speaker 7:  to see more of it. And because they were on the biggest distribution platform,

498
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,200
Speaker 7:  they got a huge boost and you could see that happen. Well, but

499
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,180
Speaker 6:  That show is also really fascinating. So we should talk about Drive Thrive

500
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,360
Speaker 6:  for a minute. We should disclose that. There's another version of that show

501
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,240
Speaker 6:  about golf called Full Swing the Vox Media makes, which is great, you should

502
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,080
Speaker 6:  watch it. The Drive Survive is this fascinating phenomenon because it is

503
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,040
Speaker 6:  owned by one company, right? Liberty Media owns F one,

504
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,540
Speaker 6:  they own the whole league and they're the ones who told their

505
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,400
Speaker 6:  entire league, you are gonna participate in this show. And the only

506
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,320
Speaker 6:  teams in the first season that could say no were the winning teams, right?

507
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,120
Speaker 6:  Like Mercedes and Ferrari said no and everyone else sort of

508
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,830
Speaker 6:  participated. And then those teams saw how much

509
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,020
Speaker 6:  play the drivers were getting, the league was getting and they came around

510
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,700
Speaker 6:  in the second season and participated and now everybody has to participate.

511
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,520
Speaker 6:  And the show is like turning into like a meta show. Like everyone's constantly

512
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,440
Speaker 6:  talking about the show on the show, which is very funny. Yep. Yes. That did

513
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,880
Speaker 6:  boost the profile of the league. But it's fascinating because it, it happened

514
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,640
Speaker 6:  because it's owned by one company. They could just make the deal and

515
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,600
Speaker 6:  instruct all the participants like, you're doing this and

516
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,360
Speaker 6:  this is a strategy would open explicit strategy of boosting our

517
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,980
Speaker 6:  profile. We're gonna turn you into reality television.

518
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,860
Speaker 6:  And every episode is basically Top Gun, right? A bunch of rich people

519
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,680
Speaker 6:  run around, they're beautiful. And then there's a race. The stakes of the

520
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,770
Speaker 6:  race are falsely amplified, which is great. I love it. Everyone should watch

521
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,080
Speaker 6:  Drive, survive. You see Netflix doing this with other, other sports. They've

522
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,920
Speaker 6:  done it with tennis, they've done it with golf. Like I said, they try

523
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,720
Speaker 6:  to do it with N F L with this new show quarterback. But because the N F L

524
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,480
Speaker 6:  insisted on making the show themselves, it's not as good. Yeah, right. It's

525
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,160
Speaker 6:  like, it's like very interesting. That Alone is like the league is

526
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,440
Speaker 6:  so involved in it on that, on that front that N F L films made

527
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,360
Speaker 6:  quarterback that the show isn't as good. And I think there's just

528
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,130
Speaker 6:  something there about trying to replicate these models

529
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,790
Speaker 6:  where like eventually you have like generational copy

530
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,440
Speaker 6:  loss. Like you make a copy of a copy of a copy and you start with Drive to

531
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,320
Speaker 6:  Survive and you end with quarterback, you're like, we made too many copies.

532
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,920
Speaker 7:  You've, you've seen that with Drive to Survive the subsequent seasons, as

533
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,280
Speaker 7:  you mentioned, it's gotten very meta, like even when you're in the season

534
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,870
Speaker 7:  that people are like, oh man, this is going to be on drive to survive. And

535
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,820
Speaker 7:  what you end up with is when it actually comes out, it's completely disappointing

536
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,140
Speaker 7:  or not in there in the way that people were expecting it. And it's just,

537
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,680
Speaker 7:  you can't, you can't do it again. You can't go back to that first one. Yeah.

538
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Speaker 6:  I just think there's something fascinating about that cycle. 'cause drive

539
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,720
Speaker 6:  to Survive happens after the season and it, they

540
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,400
Speaker 6:  release it before the next season. It just creates a cast of

541
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,110
Speaker 6:  characters. It creates a set of things to follow in a way that I think

542
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,920
Speaker 6:  kind of segues into more conversation about ESPN. That's what ESPN

543
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,880
Speaker 6:  is every day, right? Every day ESPN is just, I

544
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,680
Speaker 6:  mean it is basically just a 24 hour podcast that is interrupted by broadcasts

545
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,700
Speaker 6:  of major sports.

546
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,120
Speaker 2:  But it is increasingly becoming not that right? Like ESPN has gone through

547
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,680
Speaker 2:  a bunch of layoffs over the last couple of years, including some of its really

548
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,910
Speaker 2:  high profile talent. And it seems like what ESPN has

549
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,700
Speaker 2:  decided is that we are a place that airs sports

550
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,040
Speaker 2:  and Stephen A. Smith, like they, they have a couple of really big name people

551
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,910
Speaker 2:  that they really care a lot about and everything else that isn't

552
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,080
Speaker 2:  live sports.

553
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,880
Speaker 7:  I think that the counterpoint to that is that they just signed Pat McAfee

554
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,730
Speaker 7:  and gave him all of the money that they took from laying off all of these

555
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,080
Speaker 7:  other

556
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,230
Speaker 6:  People.

557
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,520
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

558
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,040
Speaker 6:  Right. They took an independent podcaster and they said, okay, you're the,

559
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,810
Speaker 6:  you're the new face of ESPN. And Pat took that deal that I

560
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,490
Speaker 6:  watch a show mostly. 'cause Aaron Rogers experience was as

561
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,260
Speaker 6:  David and Richard know, very traumatizing for me over these past few years.

562
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,180
Speaker 6:  But Pat took that deal, oh, he left his gaming company deal

563
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,040
Speaker 6:  and said, ESPN is like the natural fit for what I do. And I think that goes

564
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,720
Speaker 6:  back to the prestige, right? It's the, it's still the

565
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,990
Speaker 6:  top. And so you might take the discount on

566
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,560
Speaker 6:  attaching yourself to the brand that is at the top and it also has the

567
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,440
Speaker 6:  massive distribution. I, I think that question like what is ESPN going to

568
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,360
Speaker 6:  be is really stuck in that tension of, okay, there's gonna be

569
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,800
Speaker 6:  YouTube TV and this is where a bunch of sports need to happen, so we're gonna

570
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,000
Speaker 6:  collect the sports and resell them YouTube tv and that's gonna be the cable

571
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,680
Speaker 6:  deal of old, or this is a network full of

572
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,270
Speaker 6:  personalities talking about sports and it's comfort

573
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,320
Speaker 6:  viewing for you to just have on in the background all the time. I don't think

574
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,580
Speaker 6:  they've made that decision.

575
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,640
Speaker 7:  One answer that was supposed to be there for like what ESPN and some of these

576
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,520
Speaker 7:  other sports networks is supposed to be is something that you mentioned there,

577
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,260
Speaker 7:  gambling and gaming that was supposed to help fill the hole

578
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,920
Speaker 7:  and was expected to Pat McAfee, as you said, I think had his show with FanDuel

579
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,800
Speaker 7:  or, or one of these other gaming companies. And ESPN had

580
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,120
Speaker 7:  been talking about betting, we wrote about it last year that gambling was

581
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,020
Speaker 7:  going to be a huge business for these TV networks, for fubu,

582
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,000
Speaker 7:  for everyone else. And it just has not worked out that way. Bob Iger

583
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,950
Speaker 7:  has not talked about gambling except for like one small quote in a time interview.

584
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,840
Speaker 7:  Ever since he came back, FUBU TV launched GA gambling kind of

585
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,480
Speaker 7:  features on their, their network, on their streaming network. They're gone,

586
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,140
Speaker 7:  they're out of that business. Fox shut down their Fox Bet app.

587
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,160
Speaker 7:  The gambling companies are not making as much money as people expected. Some

588
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,220
Speaker 7:  of them are losing money because it's so expensive to acquire customers.

589
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,560
Speaker 7:  And so that's another element of why everything has suddenly changed and

590
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,020
Speaker 7:  flipped up so quickly because that was supposed to help kind of bridge that

591
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,860
Speaker 7:  linear TV to streaming gap and it just didn't happen. Yeah,

592
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,280
Speaker 6:  It turns out people want to gamble in casinos not on ESPN dot

593
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,900
Speaker 6:  com

594
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,880
Speaker 2:  And that it's more fun to gamble when you're getting stimulus checks than

595
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,850
Speaker 2:  it is when the economy is bad. Also,

596
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,600
Speaker 7:  Nerds aren't as good at running casinos as they think it's really hard to

597
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,360
Speaker 7:  make money. They found out. Yeah. Alright.

598
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,600
Speaker 2:  But we, we, we should wrap this up, but I I am curious, like if we cast this

599
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,040
Speaker 2:  out a couple of years, right? I think we're, we're in this interesting place

600
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,653
Speaker 2:  where like the N F L did this big deal a couple of years ago for like $110

601
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,760
Speaker 2:  billion. All these college sports have giant deals. There's,

602
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,240
Speaker 2:  they're forever coming up. The next big one is the N B A, which a lot of

603
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,240
Speaker 2:  people think is gonna sign a gigantic deal that's gonna change the way the

604
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,860
Speaker 2:  N B A works. But also ESPN is competing with like the

605
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,840
Speaker 2:  Warner Brothers discoveries of the world and some of these tech companies

606
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,960
Speaker 2:  to get it. Like if we fast forward a couple of years, let's just talk about

607
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,633
Speaker 2:  ESPN specifically. Richard give me like 20,

608
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:53,030
Speaker 2:  25 predictions for what ESPN looks like.

609
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,520
Speaker 7:  Frankly, I'm a bit worried. The N B A thing is a a great point because it's

610
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,640
Speaker 7:  something I've been thinking about. I, I watched the N B A I love the N B

611
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,880
Speaker 7:  A I would love N B A tv. I love the transactions, I love the games, all of

612
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,720
Speaker 7:  it. And they are expecting a huge broadcast deal. You

613
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,280
Speaker 7:  know, as you said, you have Disney still, you have Warner, you have all the,

614
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,120
Speaker 7:  all the tech companies, but I don't know who is going to pay that. I don't

615
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,960
Speaker 7:  know if they're going to have to expand their international deals or what

616
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,560
Speaker 7:  they're going to have to do to find this money so that they can pay all,

617
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,000
Speaker 7:  all of the players in Boston who maybe made the, the all N B A team once

618
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,080
Speaker 7:  $300 million or something like that. But that's where we are. And I just,

619
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,000
Speaker 7:  I don't know if we're going to have the same sports landscape that

620
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,640
Speaker 7:  we had, the the kind of thing that that we grew up with. The place where

621
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,440
Speaker 7:  I saw that Barry Sanders was retiring and it still traumatizes me to this

622
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,340
Speaker 7:  day. It just, I, I don't know. I'll probably hear about it on a podcast

623
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,240
Speaker 7:  and that that's going, that's going to be it. It's just podcasts and streaming.

624
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,150
Speaker 7:  That's my prediction.

625
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,440
Speaker 2:  Neil, what about you?

626
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,400
Speaker 6:  I think I agree with that. I think the idea that sports is the last thing,

627
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,030
Speaker 6:  driving the monoculture is gonna get pulled

628
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,880
Speaker 6:  into a smaller handful of leagues. Like Apple really wants m

629
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,460
Speaker 6:  l s to happen in the United States. Yeah. And signing messy is a great deal

630
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,960
Speaker 6:  and I've now seen a bunch of messy highlights on my TikTok

631
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,790
Speaker 6:  feed. I haven't signed up for Apple TV to watch the M l s. It's just like,

632
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,160
Speaker 6:  that hasn't converted me yet, but they've instituted it into the culture

633
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,760
Speaker 6:  in a way that's interesting now, but it's still the big moments, right?

634
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,560
Speaker 6:  Like the N F L still dominates American sports and that

635
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,320
Speaker 6:  is the thing that I think will continue to just drive a bunch of stuff as

636
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,920
Speaker 6:  people wanting N F L style deals. And I just dunno if they're there.

637
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,600
Speaker 6:  I I think the audience has fractured enough that that bet

638
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,360
Speaker 6:  that everyone will pay for ESPN and that will spend money and out

639
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,000
Speaker 6:  into all the leagues that enable lots of things to happen that's

640
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,880
Speaker 6:  gone, right? And more people are gonna spend more money on watching the

641
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,360
Speaker 6:  Witcher on Netflix or whatever, like the, the fandoms are gonna, are gonna

642
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,720
Speaker 6:  fracture and be in more competition with more kinds of things in a way that

643
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,560
Speaker 6:  I think is probably exciting over the long run just because I think

644
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,020
Speaker 6:  we'll get more kinds of new upstart

645
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,830
Speaker 6:  sports emerging or more opportunities like the

646
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,750
Speaker 6:  emergence of F one has been great for racing fans.

647
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,280
Speaker 6:  Like they ran a NASCAR race in Chicago because they were like, we need to

648
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,270
Speaker 6:  do some exciting stuff to capture the attention of a new class of race

649
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,200
Speaker 6:  fans. And that was the coolest race I've ever seen, right? It was, and

650
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,960
Speaker 6:  I was in Chicago that weekend, so it was very loud. That's cool, right? Like

651
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,440
Speaker 6:  a little kick in the pants to all these leagues, to not just milk money out

652
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,130
Speaker 6:  of big fat broadcast deals is great. But I think that moment

653
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,910
Speaker 6:  where all of my friends in school were always watching

654
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,620
Speaker 6:  ESPN and kind of always talking about the same things

655
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,180
Speaker 6:  that's gone. That's, that's gotta be gone.

656
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,080
Speaker 2:  I'm with you. I think the thing that is remarkable about

657
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,000
Speaker 2:  ESPN is that it continues to be as close to like a one-stop sports shop as

658
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,960
Speaker 2:  kind of anything else. And that's just, I I agree. I think that's gonna die.

659
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,820
Speaker 2:  Like I don't see the leagues making less money, at least

660
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,920
Speaker 2:  not in the relative, immediate future. They're just gonna keep making more

661
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,680
Speaker 2:  money and the deals are gonna keep going up. And so what's gonna happen,

662
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,900
Speaker 2:  I was reading a bunch about all the different deals that have been happening

663
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,760
Speaker 2:  and there was this big big 10 deal to go back to college football that

664
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,240
Speaker 2:  happened a couple of years ago. It was a seven and a half billion dollars

665
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,160
Speaker 2:  deal for seven years and it happened across three different

666
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
Speaker 2:  networks because basically no one network could afford this whole deal. And

667
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,380
Speaker 2:  so now if you wanna watch Big 10 football, you're gonna have to like

668
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,240
Speaker 2:  do a puzzle every Saturday morning to figure out what channel your game is

669
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,160
Speaker 2:  gonna be on. You can't just like know where your sports are. And I

670
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,680
Speaker 2:  think that's where we're headed is like we're gonna get more sports, more

671
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,480
Speaker 2:  places, but it is gonna be like vastly more distributed and going

672
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,680
Speaker 2:  forward, if you wanna watch the N F L, you're gonna need like 11 different

673
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,520
Speaker 2:  subscriptions because no one company ESPN or otherwise is gonna be

674
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,400
Speaker 2:  able to afford it. My my hottest take at the end of this is

675
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,200
Speaker 2:  that I think YouTube stands to be the biggest winner of all of this because

676
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,960
Speaker 2:  I think YouTube TV is like going to keep looking like a really compelling

677
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,880
Speaker 2:  sports bundle to a lot of people. But also the thing that YouTube does where

678
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,540
Speaker 2:  you can subscribe to other streaming services through YouTube

679
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,360
Speaker 2:  is going to be really powerful. So it's like, okay, I might have to

680
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,320
Speaker 2:  get Paramount Plus and Peacock and

681
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,040
Speaker 2:  Netflix and N F L plus or whatever the

682
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,000
Speaker 2:  hell all of that. I might have to get to watch sports, but YouTube wants

683
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,840
Speaker 2:  to be this sort of interface through which I can do that. So it's gonna be

684
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,720
Speaker 2:  expensive and annoying, but I will at least have a single location for

685
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,480
Speaker 2:  all of it. And I think that is gonna end up being the biggest fight is like

686
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,280
Speaker 2:  the collector on top of the subscriptions. And I think over the course of

687
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,200
Speaker 2:  the next like decade, YouTube looks pretty good there. Amazon's also gonna

688
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,590
Speaker 2:  try pretty hard to win that fight, but I I I would, I would bet on YouTube

689
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,390
Speaker 2:  more than anybody else in this space.

690
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,600
Speaker 6:  Expensive and annoying. Welcome to the future of tv. Yeah, right. It's, it's

691
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,440
Speaker 6:  very obvious like we're just headed back to cable companies and it, it

692
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,080
Speaker 6:  is I think important to note that none of the existing cable

693
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,800
Speaker 6:  companies built any of this stuff that is just recapitulating the

694
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,980
Speaker 6:  bundles. They were always worried about losing. Yeah,

695
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,840
Speaker 2:  No, I think, I think it's exactly right and it's, it's a shame because I

696
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,440
Speaker 2:  think as a, as a like fan and viewer, and this is true of the whole

697
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,040
Speaker 2:  streaming industry right now, it's like it's all gonna get worse before it

698
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,080
Speaker 2:  gets better. Yeah. It's, it's just, it just is where it's, there's too much

699
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,620
Speaker 2:  money and too much stuff and none of it makes any sense anymore.

700
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,440
Speaker 6:  And that's why I think you should subscribe to Alex Kranz, this Plex

701
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,360
Speaker 6:  server. Just put it out

702
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,990
Speaker 2:  There. All the good stuff. True cable bundle. Alright,

703
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,720
Speaker 2:  well we will come back, I'm sure during football season and be sad about

704
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,480
Speaker 2:  why we can't watch any of the games, but thank you both. We need to take

705
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,680
Speaker 2:  a break and then we're gonna come back and talk to Alex Winter, the director

706
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,240
Speaker 2:  of the new documentary, the YouTube Effect. See you a

707
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,330
Speaker 2:  sec.

708
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,270
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So there's this new documentary out called the YouTube

709
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,850
Speaker 2:  Effect that I found totally fascinating.

710
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,710
Speaker 8:  How did it go?

711
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,850
Speaker 9:  I feel

712
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,730
Speaker 10:  I'm Brookes and I'm an internet celebrity. I am.

713
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,930
Speaker 8:  Hi, how's it going everyone? Welcome back to my channel.

714
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,030
Speaker 2:  If you followed YouTube over the years, or even listened to this show, as

715
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,870
Speaker 2:  we've talked about YouTube over the years, there's not a ton about the

716
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,670
Speaker 2:  history of the doc shows that will surprise you, but it's still a really

717
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,540
Speaker 2:  good look at how YouTube became YouTube and really what YouTube has

718
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,510
Speaker 2:  done to the world, both good and bad. I'd liked the YouTube Effect

719
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,190
Speaker 2:  because it's not one of those like loud screeds against the

720
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,630
Speaker 2:  internet or a rosy story about disruptors changing

721
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,930
Speaker 2:  everything. It's both those things and it's a bunch of other things. And

722
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,730
Speaker 2:  it made me think a lot about what actually makes YouTube

723
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,470
Speaker 2:  unique on the web. There's something different about it and I've

724
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:28,230
Speaker 2:  always had trouble putting my finger on what that thing is and the doc did

725
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,330
Speaker 2:  a pretty good job of trying to figure it out. So I called up Alex Winter,

726
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,570
Speaker 2:  the director of the documentary to talk about it,

727
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,350
Speaker 11:  The sort of monetization of propaganda and misinformation and

728
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,710
Speaker 11:  disinformation is really what the film is about at his heart. You

729
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,410
Speaker 2:  Might recognize Alex from the Bill and Ted movies, he plays Bill

730
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,190
Speaker 2:  and a lot of other shows and movies he's done over the years. More

731
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,950
Speaker 2:  recently he's also directed a number of documentaries about things like the

732
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,830
Speaker 2:  Silk Road and the Panama Papers. He's just a guy who knows a thing

733
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,790
Speaker 2:  or two about how video works and why it's effective from a bunch

734
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:03,630
Speaker 2:  of different angles. So as soon as we got on the line, that's just what we

735
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,750
Speaker 2:  started talking about. One of the things that really jumped out to me was

736
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,590
Speaker 2:  there are a couple of little spots in the movie where you talk

737
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:14,470
Speaker 2:  about video as a medium and specifically sort of YouTube as

738
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,190
Speaker 2:  a medium. And I think one of the things we debate a lot internally at The

739
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,110
Speaker 2:  Verge is a this question of like, is this a

740
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,950
Speaker 2:  platform problem or a society problem? Right? And I think I, I'm pretty resolute

741
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,470
Speaker 2:  on the answer is both, but platforms play a real role and we, we can sort

742
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,280
Speaker 2:  of litigate that as much as you want, but I think think there's,

743
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,800
Speaker 11:  There's just inarguable. Yeah, I mean that's come on, that's inarguable

744
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,420
Speaker 11:  unless you're bananas, right? Yeah,

745
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,360
Speaker 2:  But I, I think the, the really interesting question to me is kind

746
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,040
Speaker 2:  of what is special about YouTube as a place, right? Because if you wanna

747
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,800
Speaker 2:  talk about algorithms on Facebook and Twitter and TikTok and

748
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,420
Speaker 2:  elsewhere, I think this idea of algorithmic recommendations is really interesting.

749
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,400
Speaker 2:  But there's something different about like the style and structure of

750
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,260
Speaker 2:  a YouTube video even that makes it Yes. Different. Can you explain

751
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,420
Speaker 2:  how you think about that?

752
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,880
Speaker 11:  Yes. In fact, I would say that I had an inkling about this going into the

753
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,080
Speaker 11:  film and obviously being able to immerse myself in it and go meet everyone

754
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,320
Speaker 11:  who was the smartest people in the world about these issues, which is what

755
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,140
Speaker 11:  I always go seek out, did give me some concrete answers

756
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,020
Speaker 11:  in this area that were very illuminating. And some of them

757
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,510
Speaker 11:  are common sense and some of them aren't. I went into the film feeling,

758
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,880
Speaker 11:  feeling exhausted by hearing about the algorithm and I kept, I was

759
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,440
Speaker 11:  thinking You know, I know I know enough about technology and the way

760
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,220
Speaker 11:  technology is spoken about to, to be, to be skeptical

761
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,690
Speaker 11:  of so much weight being put on anything that

762
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,230
Speaker 11:  fuzzy.

763
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:38,460
Speaker 2:  Everybody talks about the algorithm, like it's like the villain in the story

764
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,360
Speaker 2:  and it's like, that's

765
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,430
Speaker 11:  Actually not, yeah. And, and You know to me, you could be very cruel and

766
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,600
Speaker 11:  like stop anyone mid-sentence and say, can you just stop and tell me what

767
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,050
Speaker 11:  you think an algorithm is? And they would, they would spout utter nonsense,

768
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,740
Speaker 11:  right? So You know, most people don't know what an algorithm is at all,

769
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,760
Speaker 11:  who are even using this term all the time. They don't even know what it

770
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,520
Speaker 11:  is. They don't even know how it works. Most people don't even know that

771
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,440
Speaker 11:  the recommended algorithm in YouTube has largely been remedied

772
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,420
Speaker 11:  and has been not doing what it used to do for a very long time.

773
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,300
Speaker 11:  And so I started to to examine what is it that to

774
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,720
Speaker 11:  to exactly to your point, because YouTube has more views than any

775
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,680
Speaker 11:  other platform that we debate, it gets a lot less attention. And

776
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,200
Speaker 11:  I think largely 'cause it's overwhelming to people sometimes some of it's

777
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,840
Speaker 11:  lobbying power, like they, they spend a lot of money to get people to look

778
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,240
Speaker 11:  elsewhere, but we spend a lot more time looking at meta and a lot more time

779
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,820
Speaker 11:  looking at what used to be Twitter and, and TikTok and other platforms.

780
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,620
Speaker 11:  But you're talking about 4.6 billion views a day on YouTube

781
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,720
Speaker 11:  You know number two most viewed website after Google being number one, both

782
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,680
Speaker 11:  owned by the same company. So that's immediately

783
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,800
Speaker 11:  what makes it special is scale, right? As you guys well

784
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,750
Speaker 11:  know, scale is everything on the internet and

785
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,280
Speaker 11:  YouTube has far more scale than any of these other platforms in terms of,

786
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,240
Speaker 11:  of interactivity. And then you get to the video component and how the

787
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,860
Speaker 11:  video component works specifically. That's different than any other platform

788
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,540
Speaker 11:  in terms of how long these videos are,

789
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,320
Speaker 11:  how promoted and viral, a very select group

790
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,200
Speaker 11:  of influencers are on all sides of, of aisles and, and thought,

791
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,960
Speaker 11:  which is one of the things about YouTube I love, right? You can have Stephen

792
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,800
Speaker 11:  Crowder over here and Natalie Wynn and Contra Points over here and they're

793
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,520
Speaker 11:  both doing great and one of them is You know trying to promote

794
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,320
Speaker 11:  Civil War and the other one's kind of trying to stop Civil War, right? But,

795
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,060
Speaker 11:  but they're both getting, getting a lot of traction. They both have

796
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,880
Speaker 11:  the parasocial connection of, golly gee whizz, I'm your

797
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,660
Speaker 11:  buddy hanging out in my, in my bedroom talking into my webcam.

798
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,520
Speaker 11:  You feel You know me, but you don't at all. Hugely powerful

799
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,830
Speaker 11:  component. So I think for me it's the trifecta of

800
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,560
Speaker 11:  massive scale parasocial connection of

801
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,420
Speaker 11:  these influencers and the power of that monetized for

802
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,280
Speaker 11:  ad dollars, right? So it's an ad-based model, business

803
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,160
Speaker 11:  model that is gonna push You know, I wouldn't say without an algorithm's

804
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,580
Speaker 11:  help. 'cause I think that's going overboard. 'cause algorithms obviously

805
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,390
Speaker 11:  do things, but it's really not a technological issue.

806
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:09,360
Speaker 11:  It's a, it's a business model issue. You could change algorithms and

807
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,970
Speaker 11:  you would still have these influencers gaining enormous traction

808
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:16,920
Speaker 11:  given the way salacious content catches fire going back to

809
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,840
Speaker 11:  yellow journalism You know in the 1890s. And then you attach the

810
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,560
Speaker 11:  monetization to that and then you attach like whoever's funding

811
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,380
Speaker 11:  those influencers and giving them the power to be online

812
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,100
Speaker 11:  all the time in a powerful way and message correctly. Natalie

813
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,040
Speaker 11:  really is like a, a You know, a one woman band. People like Crowder

814
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,760
Speaker 11:  and Shapiro, I mean those are You know huge entities with a lot of money

815
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,520
Speaker 11:  behind them. So I think it's that trifecta and I think that makes YouTube

816
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,200
Speaker 11:  special in many good ways. I think that the way

817
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,960
Speaker 11:  they've, they've legitimately constructed a business model that

818
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,880
Speaker 11:  allows creators to actually earn a living, going back to SMASH and some

819
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,760
Speaker 11:  of the earliest players on the platform, I think has changed the world in

820
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,600
Speaker 11:  many ways for the better. I think it has democratized culture.

821
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,560
Speaker 11:  I think it has opened up people's ability to have a

822
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,320
Speaker 11:  voice, You know L G B T Q people in, in marginalized communities, people

823
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,960
Speaker 11:  in small foreign countries who would never get You know on any broad

824
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,800
Speaker 11:  based entertainment platform. And I think a lot of that stuff is good. I

825
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,240
Speaker 11:  think obviously the Dangerous You know we talk about quite a bit in the

826
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,710
Speaker 11:  film.

827
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I think the, the intersection of those three things you talked

828
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,570
Speaker 2:  about is sort of forever fascinating to me. It's like YouTube

829
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:31,480
Speaker 2:  introduces mid-roll ads and so videos get longer so that they can have

830
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,760
Speaker 2:  mid-roll ads and the thus the structure of those videos change and the way

831
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,320
Speaker 2:  that people respond to 'em changes and then YouTube starts rewarding long

832
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,200
Speaker 2:  watch time so they make their videos even longer. Yeah. And so it just,

833
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,960
Speaker 2:  these things like cycle each other forever and ever. And it's just super

834
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,230
Speaker 2:  fascinating. But I think the, the parasocial thing was the thing that like

835
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,060
Speaker 2:  kept sticking with me as I was watching the doc. Like I was watching with

836
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,880
Speaker 2:  my wife and we got to the section about Ryan, the, the kid

837
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,627
Speaker 2:  who like does the toy stuff, made $22 million

838
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,200
Speaker 2:  wildly famous and super successful. And she was just like, why would kids

839
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,120
Speaker 2:  wanna watch this kid on YouTube? And it was a moment of being like, oh,

840
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,960
Speaker 2:  right, we're old people who don't get it. And also like these people like

841
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,520
Speaker 2:  think he's their friend in like a really real way. Like they have an

842
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,280
Speaker 2:  actual relationship in a way that like, I don't know if you

843
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,220
Speaker 2:  rewind 20 years, people liked and cared about movie stars but

844
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,680
Speaker 2:  didn't perceive them the same way. And I feel like we're still reckoning

845
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,460
Speaker 2:  with this idea that like I can watch somebody on my screen who I

846
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,360
Speaker 2:  now in some real way believe that I know

847
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,840
Speaker 2:  because I've been inside their house and I've seen them eat dinner in a way

848
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,590
Speaker 2:  that like watching somebody on a movie never did.

849
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:40,960
Speaker 11:  Yeah. And they're looking at a, they're looking at you, they're looking

850
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,820
Speaker 11:  at a webcam and you're often watching them on your phone or

851
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,420
Speaker 11:  on your laptop. I'm not in a sort of ritualistic

852
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,360
Speaker 11:  way of like, here is an icon a hundred feet tall on

853
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:56,060
Speaker 11:  a movie screen that I've like gotten in my car and driven to the movie theater

854
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,600
Speaker 11:  and gone to like bought popcorn and then for being presented with this

855
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,280
Speaker 11:  towering figure. It's the literal opposite of that and every

856
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,480
Speaker 11:  conceivable way. And in fact that's part of what we're dealing with with

857
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,380
Speaker 11:  a strike right now is like the advent of streaming has,

858
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,010
Speaker 11:  has broken that ritual to a degree that we're losing movie

859
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:17,870
Speaker 11:  stars. And and people don't feel that that

860
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:21,510
Speaker 11:  sort of opposite type of connection, that kind of epic connection

861
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:25,240
Speaker 11:  with with or interest in someone that you feel is larger than life that

862
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,840
Speaker 11:  you don't know. So, and Ryan You know just so it's been said, it's it's

863
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,520
Speaker 11:  a couple hundred million dollars a year, so Oh, sorry. It's it's a

864
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,480
Speaker 11:  vast sum. Sure. And they've been doing that year after year for a

865
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,880
Speaker 11:  long time. So I mean you are talking about an enormous,

866
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,790
Speaker 11:  enormous audience and, and that has gotten

867
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:47,620
Speaker 11:  Hollywood scare You know because it, it is, they're drawing numbers that

868
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,280
Speaker 11:  are not comparable in terms of what, what, especially in the streaming world,

869
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,720
Speaker 11:  which is, doesn't really monetize so well. So I think that the Parasocial

870
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,060
Speaker 11:  thing can't be understated. I think the work that Becca Lewis out of Stanford

871
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,880
Speaker 11:  has done and other people is really significant work. And it, it was

872
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,440
Speaker 11:  very important to me when I was making the doc 'cause it kind of answered

873
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,110
Speaker 11:  the question I had about, okay, if the algorithm isn't the secret sauce,

874
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:13,040
Speaker 11:  what is, Hmm. And I think the secret sauce is really the parasocial relationships

875
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,910
Speaker 11:  and I think it's what draws people to YouTube. I think it what makes people

876
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:20,800
Speaker 11:  feel like it's what's influential, but it's also a big part of what's

877
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,720
Speaker 11:  caused the societal impact because it's really much more than

878
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,840
Speaker 11:  just a political pundit saying go do this. It's someone that you think is

879
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,620
Speaker 11:  like your best friend saying go do this.

880
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,840
Speaker 2:  Was YouTube just first into that fray or is there something about it that

881
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,640
Speaker 2:  is still different? Because like TikTok plays on the same sorts of

882
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,080
Speaker 2:  things now, but I feel like maybe just doesn't have the history to pull that

883
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,600
Speaker 2:  off. Instagram was always kinda the opposite. It's like this airbrushed version

884
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,300
Speaker 2:  of everybody's life. Like why is it that after all these years, no one else

885
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,960
Speaker 2:  has figured out how to do this the way that YouTube has done it?

886
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,280
Speaker 11:  I think that it would be possible to have competitors in a marketplace.

887
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,240
Speaker 11:  I don't think TikTok is one for a number of of obvious reasons. The

888
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,640
Speaker 11:  way their algorithm works, the way their videos work, the way they don't

889
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,480
Speaker 11:  monetize creators. They're, they don't

890
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,420
Speaker 11:  have the scale that YouTube has. They don't have a Google behind them. Right.

891
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,900
Speaker 11:  And we chart this in the movie. It's the reason we spend time in the film

892
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,800
Speaker 11:  and act one charting the, the actual business growth of

893
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,600
Speaker 11:  YouTube because I think it's very important. And I think

894
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,100
Speaker 11:  that Susan Waki and other people's

895
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,020
Speaker 11:  vision in 2005, 2006, I think

896
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,090
Speaker 11:  you have to credit that vision. I think that, and especially given how much

897
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:34,840
Speaker 11:  flax she got and they got for, for buying YouTube for

898
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,560
Speaker 11:  1.6 plus billion dollars, which sounds like nothing now, but at the time

899
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,380
Speaker 11:  was like a preposterously large amount of money. Yeah. It was just, it was

900
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,180
Speaker 11:  an unimaginable, unimaginable number in the internet. A era of, of

901
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,010
Speaker 11:  that, of that time when, I mean when Apple was still this kind of ailing

902
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:52,920
Speaker 11:  company trying to get a foothold back in the business and

903
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,820
Speaker 11:  the prescience that they had of understanding that Google was becoming

904
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,490
Speaker 11:  a dominant figure in what was gonna be the You know

905
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:04,320
Speaker 11:  jockeying for the very few lanes of, of the highway, which

906
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,060
Speaker 11:  was true. Only few companies did survive and, and take those lanes and

907
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,990
Speaker 11:  Google is one of them. In fact they're the largest in terms of user interaction.

908
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:15,460
Speaker 11:  Apple I guess has a bigger market cap, but Google has a lot more people

909
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,680
Speaker 11:  using its tools. So I think that their vision

910
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,540
Speaker 11:  was not complete. It wasn't like we see the whole picture. But I do

911
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,300
Speaker 11:  think that that they knew that if you harness a video

912
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,820
Speaker 11:  platform that worked, that had a UI that people were responding to, which

913
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,380
Speaker 11:  I think was was not happening with Google Play. You harness that to the

914
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,510
Speaker 11:  Lar You know to one of the largest tech companies on the planet with enormous

915
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:40,020
Speaker 11:  reach and influence and lobbying power, which is

916
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,840
Speaker 11:  important that you would be able to dominate the market in that space

917
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,650
Speaker 11:  and that more people, you'd be able to create an entertainment infrastructure

918
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:51,300
Speaker 11:  that people would want to use. 'cause they did start to monetize their influencers

919
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,060
Speaker 11:  immediately. This wasn't like You know Masha was making money almost

920
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,540
Speaker 11:  immediately in the, in the early days of YouTube. Right. And other people

921
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,180
Speaker 11:  obviously that's, that was our, our ta use case in the movie. So I think

922
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,980
Speaker 11:  that's really important because I think that, and it's one of the things

923
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,760
Speaker 11:  that we get at is one of the problems. It's sort of how we wrap the movie

924
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,320
Speaker 11:  up. Not to spoil it for folks who are gonna go see it, but like You know

925
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,660
Speaker 11:  Google is a monopoly is one of the largest monopolies on the

926
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,540
Speaker 11:  planet. YouTube dominates the space because it

927
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,120
Speaker 11:  has the benefit of Google's monopoly power. I don't think that

928
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,980
Speaker 11:  if, if Google got broken up or if there

929
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,880
Speaker 11:  were other You know equally large tech companies, I think you would

930
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,860
Speaker 11:  see competitors in this space. And I do think honestly and You know, I'm

931
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,620
Speaker 11:  curious what, what you all think and, and You know what you think about

932
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:40,500
Speaker 11:  this given your understanding of this space. I do think it's where we're

933
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,580
Speaker 11:  headed, even though I don't think it's happening anytime soon. I do think

934
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,500
Speaker 11:  we're headed into a more fractured space You know in

935
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,890
Speaker 11:  terms. And I think that's a healthy thing where like it isn't just three,

936
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:54,860
Speaker 11:  four companies running everything and there is

937
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,740
Speaker 11:  more choice and there is more competition which gives way to

938
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,700
Speaker 11:  more policy and healthier regulation. I think it's gonna be a bit of a dog

939
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,460
Speaker 11:  fight 'cause who wants to give up dominance? But I do think we're heading

940
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,240
Speaker 11:  that way. And I think what's interesting to me is what Twitter, what Elon

941
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,030
Speaker 11:  Musk's kind of disastrous takeover of Twitter has

942
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:17,900
Speaker 11:  shown is that the public, everyone, I, I was interesting to watch people

943
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,300
Speaker 11:  who I, who were smart but I knew hadn't spent a lot of time online when

944
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,960
Speaker 11:  must did that. They were like, oh this is, I was kind of getting tired of

945
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,800
Speaker 11:  social media anyway, so this is kind of the end. I'm gonna probably back

946
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,720
Speaker 11:  off and not do this anymore. And within two weeks those same people were

947
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,460
Speaker 11:  like on Mastodon on post right on eventually on

948
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,720
Speaker 11:  Fred's. Like they figured out what a lot of us knew for years, which is

949
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,800
Speaker 11:  like, you don't need to be on one platform, it's okay. Right, right. You

950
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,480
Speaker 11:  can communicate cross platform. So I think that that's the

951
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,150
Speaker 11:  future on some level.

952
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:48,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I I agree in most cases actually, and we, we've talked about it a lot

953
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,490
Speaker 2:  on the show actually is I think we are headed in kind of an

954
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,800
Speaker 2:  unbundling phase and it's where I think like things like Mastodon and the

955
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,270
Speaker 2:  sort of decentralized social media stuff is really interesting. We're headed

956
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:02,220
Speaker 2:  back towards like protocols being really interesting and exciting

957
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,940
Speaker 2:  and I think the future of social is definitely lots of places not one place.

958
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,600
Speaker 2:  And I think that's probably a good thing. I don't know about YouTube though

959
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,240
Speaker 2:  because the thing, the thing that jumps out to me even as you talk about

960
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,910
Speaker 2:  it, is there's no good reason for anyone to want to leave

961
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:19,400
Speaker 2:  YouTube. It's monetizing really well for everyone

962
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,280
Speaker 2:  involved. It's the best platform technically. It's a very

963
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,950
Speaker 2:  good search engine. It has a very good video player, like short of

964
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:30,160
Speaker 2:  some sort of spectacular own goal from Google At this

965
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,980
Speaker 2:  point I have a really hard time imagining what it would take to

966
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,710
Speaker 2:  unwind YouTube at this moment.

967
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:40,360
Speaker 11:  Yeah, and I agree with you. I mean I think that there at this moment, and

968
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,870
Speaker 11:  I think in the immediate future and even the not so immediate future,

969
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:47,230
Speaker 11:  they're it Yeah, tell me, don't get me, this is not changing tomorrow unless

970
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,180
Speaker 2:  Elon Musk buys YouTube and then all Betts are off and coddling this

971
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:55,160
Speaker 11:  And then just calls it X and and we all just go home and we do just get

972
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,000
Speaker 11:  off the internet and give up. But no, I I don't think it's gonna change

973
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,600
Speaker 11:  anytime soon. I mean I feel pretty firmly that they are an

974
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,560
Speaker 11:  entrenched entity and that they have the power. I don't know

975
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,720
Speaker 11:  if they have the desire, but they have the power to eat Hollywood without

976
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,280
Speaker 11:  blinking. Right? Yeah. And You know they could gobble up every single one

977
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,240
Speaker 11:  of these conglomerates and not bat an eye. I don't necessarily think that

978
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,000
Speaker 11:  they wanna do that. I think their forays into that level of

979
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,320
Speaker 11:  content distribution, which they played with in the

980
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,280
Speaker 11:  past was not particularly fruitful for them and they don't seem to need

981
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,400
Speaker 11:  it. Right. Right. But they could do it in a heartbeat. I don't think Google's

982
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,840
Speaker 11:  or YouTube are going to, is going to get smaller over the next few years.

983
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,920
Speaker 11:  I think it's gonna continue to get bigger, but I do think that there's going

984
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,400
Speaker 11:  to be pushback and I do think that harms are going to

985
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,680
Speaker 11:  increase and I think the general public will eventually, even though I think

986
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,640
Speaker 11:  they don't understand the internet, even lawmakers don't understand the

987
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,460
Speaker 11:  situation so well today. You know a lot of younger people are coming up

988
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,440
Speaker 11:  in law and government and, and in tech who absolutely do

989
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,990
Speaker 11:  understand much better what's going on. So I think we will stop,

990
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,310
Speaker 11:  hopefully stop seeing like really bad

991
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:06,260
Speaker 11:  legislation being put forward. Like Csosa and other You know forms of

992
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,280
Speaker 11:  really misguided attempts to dismantle section two

993
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,000
Speaker 11:  30. I think we'll stop seeing things like that soon and see a

994
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,800
Speaker 11:  shift towards legislation and policy ideas, even if they don't get implemented

995
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,110
Speaker 11:  right away, that at least make more sense.

996
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:21,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I think that's right and I I do think, think it's gonna be good

997
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,560
Speaker 2:  when a generation of people who grew up with this stuff becomes the one legislating

998
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,840
Speaker 2:  this stuff. That's, that's gonna go a very long way. But I think the, the

999
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,200
Speaker 2:  thing about YouTube, I I'm fascinated by YouTube just like as a, as a product

1000
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,150
Speaker 2:  because not only does it continue to be this sort of dominant video place,

1001
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,910
Speaker 2:  it's also making big plays into essentially being a cable bundle.

1002
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,560
Speaker 2:  It's a music app now. It's, it really is, like you've said, sort

1003
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,120
Speaker 2:  of becoming all things to all people in a way that I, I don't even think

1004
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,020
Speaker 2:  most people see yet. Like it has football now. Yeah. YouTube has football.

1005
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,640
Speaker 2:  How did that happen? And one of the things you've said in other interviews

1006
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,280
Speaker 2:  I was listening to is that one of the things you thought was funny is that

1007
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,860
Speaker 2:  nobody can quite explain YouTube and because it's hard to explain

1008
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:03,720
Speaker 2:  that's why like Susan Waki was never dragged in front of

1009
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,200
Speaker 2:  Congress because like it's not, it's not social media, it's not

1010
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,120
Speaker 2:  entertainment. It's too big to understand in the

1011
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,510
Speaker 2:  course of doing this. Have you come up with like a good metaphor for YouTube?

1012
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:14,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

1013
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,920
Speaker 11:  I it is Google's media front end. That's what it is. Okay. You know,

1014
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,160
Speaker 11:  I mean it 'cause it's me, it's all media. I mean it's like You know, like

1015
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,790
Speaker 11:  Howard Stern used to say I'm the king of all media. I mean YouTube

1016
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:29,720
Speaker 11:  YouTube is truly the king of all media. And it's, it's absolutely

1017
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,840
Speaker 11:  true. It's not just lobbying power though. I think that they are very good

1018
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,800
Speaker 11:  at spinning a narrative that keeps people off their back because they

1019
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,240
Speaker 11:  don't understand how to define it and they don't go to any lengths to define

1020
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,820
Speaker 11:  it. But no, I mean it's on top of everything you just stated, it's also

1021
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,680
Speaker 11:  You know I've got a, a kid in middle school that's his search engine. He

1022
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,320
Speaker 11:  doesn't search on Google, he searches on YouTube, which is terrifying to

1023
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,920
Speaker 11:  librarians who tell them that because they're like, oh my God, but it's

1024
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,720
Speaker 11:  all wrong information. I'm like, it may be, but that's where they're You

1025
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,140
Speaker 11:  know he is writing a term paper. He's got YouTube up. He doesn't have Google

1026
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:02,740
Speaker 11:  up. Right. Or Wikipedia much to my chagrin sometimes.

1027
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,640
Speaker 11:  But You know, at least he's not like You know listening to Andrew Tate for

1028
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,200
Speaker 11:  like You know how to write his paper, but fair. Yeah. But it You know, but

1029
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,020
Speaker 11:  it's also our repo You know it's our library Alexandria. I mean it's a repository

1030
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:15,340
Speaker 11:  for pretty much all of recorded human history, right. Is that's on YouTube

1031
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,320
Speaker 11:  and almost nowhere else. When I, when I'm looking for content of my own

1032
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,000
Speaker 11:  that I've created over the years, that's the only place I find it. Like

1033
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,880
Speaker 11:  it's literally the best archive tool for, from those

1034
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,120
Speaker 11:  of us in the arts as well. And not just in the movie business but in all

1035
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,940
Speaker 11:  areas of the arts as you said, and including in music. I watched

1036
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,920
Speaker 11:  my el my now eldest son You know who's now outta college. I mean, as

1037
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,630
Speaker 11:  he was coming up he sort of went from watching a TV

1038
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,760
Speaker 11:  when he was like seven or eight to watching a TV with a laptop You know

1039
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,540
Speaker 11:  on his lap to not watching the TV. And then, and then

1040
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,440
Speaker 11:  all of his music was all YouTube like all the time. Even though we

1041
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,740
Speaker 11:  had Spotify, we had all these other things. And this was probably

1042
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,940
Speaker 11:  2006, 2007 like early days of YouTube

1043
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:02,800
Speaker 11:  2008. And that was very fascinating to me. So I sort of watched the evolution

1044
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,630
Speaker 11:  of YouTube through my son's eyes because he was getting pulled

1045
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:10,520
Speaker 11:  into its multiple uses. I would say the least use I've

1046
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,340
Speaker 11:  seen my kids using it for is social. Like You know they're on Discord

1047
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:18,040
Speaker 11:  or they're on Twitch or they're in other areas where they can create their

1048
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,040
Speaker 11:  own servers and talk, talk to the people they want to talk to. As you said,

1049
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,640
Speaker 11:  social is for most internet users who are savvy, it's moved off

1050
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,380
Speaker 11:  of these siloed platforms I think a while ago.

1051
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,960
Speaker 11:  But I, I do think that that the You know, if we're looking at the labor

1052
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,880
Speaker 11:  strike we're in right now and, and Hollywood, I think that the, one of the

1053
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,800
Speaker 11:  areas of disconnect between You know my gang, the sort of the unions,

1054
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,640
Speaker 11:  I mean all three of the unions that were up for contract negotiation, sag,

1055
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,600
Speaker 11:  W J D G A and the A and P T P is that, I don't know how

1056
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,480
Speaker 11:  well the, the unions understand the level of threat that the A and P T

1057
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,320
Speaker 11:  P are under, right from larger tech

1058
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,120
Speaker 11:  entities, some of whom right are in the A M B G B like Apple or Amazon or

1059
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,040
Speaker 11:  whatever. But those are just little tiny pieces of their portfolio, right?

1060
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:06,000
Speaker 11:  Like Apple's business is not making movies and neither is Amazon. They have

1061
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,440
Speaker 11:  a little side hustle,

1062
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,360
Speaker 2:  Right? But they can essentially swallow the movie business anytime they feel

1063
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,380
Speaker 2:  like it completely.

1064
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,560
Speaker 11:  And and so like all this talk of AI and like You know

1065
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,380
Speaker 11:  negotiating contracts and like You know getting terms in

1066
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:22,040
Speaker 11:  or even regulation like You know who are you

1067
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,660
Speaker 11:  regulating against and who is really the power

1068
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,840
Speaker 11:  and You know the, the disruption that's

1069
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,800
Speaker 11:  coming over the next five to 10 years. To

1070
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,560
Speaker 11:  your point about YouTube's growth is largely gonna be coming from these

1071
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,440
Speaker 11:  big monopoly tech companies that are going to shape in whatever they way

1072
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,470
Speaker 11:  they want the future.

1073
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:45,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean it's really interesting and I that that way of framing it is

1074
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,680
Speaker 2:  really interesting to me. 'cause I think You know, one of the things we've

1075
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,600
Speaker 2:  heard a lot about from the union side is, is this fear that

1076
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,480
Speaker 2:  essentially AI will make real people irrelevant kind of in every step of

1077
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,280
Speaker 2:  the process, right? We'll be able to digitize extras so that they won't need

1078
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,400
Speaker 2:  them in the background anymore. We'll use chat G B T to generate scripts.

1079
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,280
Speaker 2:  I think those are real fears. Not necessarily founded in like how

1080
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,560
Speaker 2:  this tech works right now, but we're on a path where that seems reasonable

1081
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,500
Speaker 2:  and I'm, I'm curious how you feel about that. But also at the same time

1082
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,320
Speaker 2:  all of the studios and distributors like you're talking about also fear

1083
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,880
Speaker 2:  being made irrelevant by technology. Yeah. And they're just afraid they're

1084
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,360
Speaker 2:  gonna get eaten by these, this handful of big companies that has so much

1085
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,340
Speaker 2:  money to throw at whatever they feel like that they could all just go away

1086
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,920
Speaker 2:  and become a rounding error in Apple's budget. And it's just fascinating

1087
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,860
Speaker 2:  to think that everybody is afraid of tech but in completely different ways.

1088
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:37,380
Speaker 2:  And that's kind of why all of this becomes so hard to sort out.

1089
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,130
Speaker 11:  It does and it also creates multiple conflicting conversations that

1090
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:45,080
Speaker 11:  don't make it easier to have resolution, which is why the strike is

1091
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,600
Speaker 11:  going on so long in in, in one area. 'cause there's other areas obviously

1092
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,560
Speaker 11:  in terms of residuals and pay structures based on streaming, which is also

1093
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,120
Speaker 11:  a result of big tech and their influence on, on the

1094
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,240
Speaker 11:  entertainment industry, which is why we're in the streaming investor that

1095
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,120
Speaker 11:  we're in in the first place. But no, I think that that's absolutely right.

1096
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,160
Speaker 11:  I think that there's an existential concern on the part of the creative

1097
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,520
Speaker 11:  community that AI and sort of big

1098
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,480
Speaker 11:  technological advances 'cause some of those, even though they're, they're

1099
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,680
Speaker 11:  put under the bucket of AI aren't really about ai, they're about other things

1100
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,390
Speaker 11:  that are called ai but that these advances are going to

1101
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:22,320
Speaker 11:  replace all workers with, with robots You know, some of which is

1102
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,240
Speaker 11:  true. My fears are actually a little less grandiose, a little

1103
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,920
Speaker 11:  more mundane in ways that workers will get replaced by by sort of AI

1104
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,570
Speaker 11:  type technology. 'cause a lot of it will will be centered around

1105
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:37,520
Speaker 11:  scheduling and budgeting and using You know like how

1106
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,560
Speaker 11:  a lot of lawyers are gonna get replaced by certain types of AI at a certain

1107
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,000
Speaker 11:  You know. I had this conversation with Lawrence Luting at Harvard. We had

1108
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,800
Speaker 11:  a, I called him to sort of get his framing. He was like, look, mostly it's

1109
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,880
Speaker 11:  going to eat up lawyers and we have too many lawyers anyway, so I'm not

1110
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,640
Speaker 11:  particularly worried about it, but, but You know. But there are

1111
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,560
Speaker 11:  obviously these technologies are gonna get used to cut corners and

1112
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,210
Speaker 11:  costs by companies at the expense of workers. So yes,

1113
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:04,680
Speaker 11:  labor-wise we are gonna have shrinkage. I wouldn't be blase about it. We

1114
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,120
Speaker 11:  are gonna have shrinkage based on the advances in technology. We've all

1115
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,080
Speaker 11:  known that's coming, been coming for a long time. There's actually, there's

1116
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,910
Speaker 11:  very little we can do about it other than You know have

1117
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,750
Speaker 11:  extremely blunt contract terms that kind of

1118
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,570
Speaker 11:  shackle the studios or your work or your boss or whatever from

1119
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:26,460
Speaker 11:  using these tools that exist because a lot of these tools are open source.

1120
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:30,040
Speaker 11:  So there's very little you can do to You know. I hear so much talk in my

1121
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,040
Speaker 11:  industry like, we gotta stop them from ingesting our material. I'm like,

1122
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,710
Speaker 11:  that's not possible. Right. You will not stop them from ingesting your material.

1123
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:38,040
Speaker 11:  They they will do that and

1124
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,870
Speaker 2:  There are a hundred thems now.

1125
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,480
Speaker 11:  Well yeah, there's th it's like Napster, right? It's whack-a-mole, right?

1126
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,430
Speaker 11:  You know. Yeah. And you're gonna have a kid in, in Taiwan with an open source

1127
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:50,280
Speaker 11:  tool that's making Star Wars all day long. And You know with

1128
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,960
Speaker 11:  me starring Meryl Streep and, and You know Humphrey Bogart and

1129
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,320
Speaker 11:  that's absolutely gonna happen. So You know there are contract

1130
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,960
Speaker 11:  negotiations that you can get into. There is also, as you well

1131
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,700
Speaker 11:  know, there are realities about what these, these technologies can

1132
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:08,400
Speaker 11:  do and there are fears about their

1133
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,840
Speaker 11:  potential that we're, that we're not at yet about what they can do. And

1134
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,740
Speaker 11:  I think it's important to try to stay focused on what they can actually

1135
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,240
Speaker 11:  do because we do still need people to tell these

1136
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,200
Speaker 11:  stories. And we do still need to, to document human beings to tell

1137
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,070
Speaker 11:  most of these stories. And AI will, will You know and

1138
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:31,030
Speaker 11:  it's present and even it's potentially immediate future

1139
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:35,010
Speaker 11:  self will create mostly garbage or sort of regurgitated

1140
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,460
Speaker 11:  maybe curiosities. I'm more concerned about it being used

1141
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,960
Speaker 11:  for You know calculation type stuff that will cut the workforce. Things

1142
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,720
Speaker 11:  that I know AI can do and do quickly that

1143
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,460
Speaker 11:  will You know will shove a lot of people out of the workforce.

1144
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,280
Speaker 11:  But I think generally the bigger concerns I have are the concerns the A

1145
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,000
Speaker 11:  M P G P are having, which is huge disruption to the

1146
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,840
Speaker 11:  overall industry from these tech companies. And I think that's a

1147
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,850
Speaker 11:  much bigger threat that will create much bigger

1148
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,070
Speaker 11:  disruption.

1149
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:07,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think you're right. And I think one of the things I've heard you

1150
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,560
Speaker 2:  say and and you can sort of feel in the YouTube Effect is you're,

1151
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,040
Speaker 2:  you're interested in scale as a thing, right? That's like what happens when

1152
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,840
Speaker 2:  things get huge I think is a really interesting question. And is one you've

1153
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,130
Speaker 2:  explored in a bunch of different places, do you buy the idea that

1154
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:25,060
Speaker 2:  these platforms and these companies are just too big that eventually you

1155
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:28,960
Speaker 2:  hit a tipping point of that kind of scale where it's impossible to be

1156
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,040
Speaker 2:  a good citizen of the internet and do content moderation? Well and I think

1157
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,200
Speaker 2:  that there's one school of thought that says these are the companies that

1158
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,000
Speaker 2:  have the resources to do this stuff well. And there's another school of thought

1159
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,190
Speaker 2:  that says this is just too much stuff. Even if YouTube tries its hardest

1160
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:44,000
Speaker 2:  with all the available resources, it is not going to be able to successfully

1161
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,880
Speaker 2:  solve the problems that it has. Which side of that do you fall on?

1162
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,800
Speaker 11:  I fall on the side that there is plenty of room for

1163
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,600
Speaker 11:  accountability and no one should expect perfection. I think

1164
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,120
Speaker 11:  a, a good example is YouTube was

1165
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:01,700
Speaker 11:  removing content that pushed the stop the steal

1166
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,640
Speaker 11:  lie until about two weeks ago. And then they, they reversed their

1167
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,570
Speaker 11:  policy and began to let that content back on platform

1168
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:13,310
Speaker 11:  right As we head into an election cycle, which is

1169
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:17,090
Speaker 11:  bananas. Yes. That's a really good example of content

1170
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:20,950
Speaker 11:  moderation that is doable that they were doing and then

1171
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:24,320
Speaker 11:  decided to stop doing. I don't think that the problem, I think they're too

1172
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,420
Speaker 11:  big for You know in general. They're too big in terms of not allowing competition

1173
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,100
Speaker 11:  and other reasons that monopolies are bad. But I don't think they're too

1174
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,680
Speaker 11:  big to self-regulate. I think that they don't self-regulate because it's

1175
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,600
Speaker 11:  not profitable to self, it's a business model issue. So as we

1176
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,010
Speaker 11:  talked about at the very beginning of this conversation, salacious content

1177
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:45,970
Speaker 11:  draws eyeballs, eyeballs, dry draw, eye add dollars, and that

1178
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:49,790
Speaker 11:  makes everybody lots of money. You know how are you gonna boot Stephen

1179
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:53,320
Speaker 11:  Crowder off your platform when he is got 4 million

1180
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,970
Speaker 11:  subscribers and you can tag that You know adds to that and everyone

1181
01:09:56,970 --> 01:10:00,080
Speaker 11:  makes lots of money and goes home happy And you go before your, your board

1182
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,920
Speaker 11:  or your shareholders and say, You know stock is up. So I think it's a business

1183
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,280
Speaker 11:  model capitalist thing I that makes a different, that's why we need, that's

1184
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,520
Speaker 11:  why it took us so long to get the automakers to start putting seat belts

1185
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,100
Speaker 11:  in their cars. It's the same old thing with industry over and over again.

1186
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,960
Speaker 11:  And it does require policy. It just does. 'cause no, no company, just like

1187
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,480
Speaker 11:  a little kid, you give a kid a You know bag of candy and tell 'em to share

1188
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,840
Speaker 11:  with everyone else in the sandbox. They just aren't going to do that. It's

1189
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,460
Speaker 11:  just not the way human beings are wired. So they have to have a teacher

1190
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:31,200
Speaker 11:  or a parent or someone say, You know now Eddie, I'm going to take some of

1191
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,080
Speaker 11:  those away and give them to the other kids. And I think that's kind of where

1192
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:35,910
Speaker 11:  we're at.

1193
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:39,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah. We need more grownups is not a bad diagnosis of a lot of things in

1194
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,910
Speaker 2:  life right now. Yeah,

1195
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:42,860
Speaker 11:  Exactly. Yeah.

1196
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:46,120
Speaker 2:  All right, awesome. Well Alex, thank you again. I really enjoyed the documentary

1197
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,000
Speaker 2:  and this was, this was really fun. I really appreciate you coming on and

1198
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,550

Speaker 11:  Yeah, likewise. Yeah, thanks for having me.

1200
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:53,800
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

1201
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,520
Speaker 2:  we're gonna answer a question from The Vergecast

01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,550
Speaker 2:  hotline.

1203
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,750
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's do the hotline. Tom Warn is here to help us

1205
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:16,240
Speaker 2:  shortly what we have here. But first the hotline is 8 6 6

Speaker 2:  Verge one, one call. Ask us all your deepest darkest questions. We do at

1207
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:23,350
Speaker 2:  least one every week. It's very fun. This time we have a

1208
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:27,270
Speaker 2:  Windows question which we don't get a lot of from Jim. Let's hear it real

1209
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:29,090
Speaker 2:  fast.

1210
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:33,070
Speaker 13:  Hi, this is Jim. I'm calling asking about Windows 11. I

1211
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:36,110
Speaker 13:  seem to have kind of memory hold everything I've ever heard about it. Is

1212
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:39,170
Speaker 13:  it actually time to upgrade to Windows 11? Just lemme know.

1213
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,210
Speaker 13:  Thanks.

1214
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:43,550
Speaker 2:  So fairly straightforward question, right? Like is it time to upgrade to

1215
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:46,590
Speaker 2:  Windows 11, which is like the funniest Windows question of all time. Everybody's

1216
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:49,910
Speaker 2:  like, I have Windows from 11 years ago slash Windows

1217
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:53,750
Speaker 2:  95, do I need to upgrade? But it, it sent me down this weird rabbit

1218
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:57,330
Speaker 2:  hole of, I kind of forgot about Windows 11

1219
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:01,150
Speaker 2:  and, and I kind of feel like Microsoft is perfectly happy with that being

1220
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:03,750
Speaker 2:  the case. But let's just start at the very top, like answer the question

1221
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:07,460
Speaker 2:  what do we think? Is it, is it time for everyone to be on Windows 11?

1222
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,940
Speaker 14:  This, this is one of those questions where it's like You know when someone

1223
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:13,820
Speaker 14:  asks you what's the best laptop And you're like,

1224
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:17,590
Speaker 14:  well that's like a, a very big question. So I guess the the

1225
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:21,450
Speaker 14:  basic answer is it depends what you use your laptop for or your, your

1226
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:25,170
Speaker 14:  PC for wherever you need to upgrade or not. But on the flip side, it's like

1227
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:29,110
Speaker 14:  if you upgrade you're not gonna like lose anything potentially. I

1228
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:33,070
Speaker 14:  mean I think initially when Windows 11 came out there were some issues

1229
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:36,770
Speaker 14:  particularly around the taska, but they've, they've kind of improved that

1230
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:39,790
Speaker 14:  so you're not gonna lose some of that functionality and stuff. So yeah,

1231
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,670
Speaker 14:  I think my general very quick answer to that and we'll obviously go very

1232
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:47,350
Speaker 14:  deep into it, but the very quick answer is yeah, it's probably time to upgrade

1233
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:50,830
Speaker 14:  now. I think it's it's it's a good time to upgrade now after, after, what

1234
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,020
Speaker 14:  is it? Two years now? Yeah.

1235
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:55,930
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It does seem like, I mean the, the sort of standard operating procedure

1236
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:59,550
Speaker 2:  for Windows was like wait for two security patches, right? And then it was

1237
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:02,590
Speaker 2:  like, then it was like okay you can update. And it feels like we're well

1238
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:06,390
Speaker 2:  past that. We're to the point now where like if you get Windows 11, assuming

1239
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:10,340
Speaker 2:  your computer can support it, whatever, it's not going to be broken.

1240
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,940
Speaker 14:  Yeah. It used to be like wait for service packs and we've essentially had

1241
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:17,920
Speaker 14:  the, those service packs used to be You know once a year and, and they kind

1242
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,800
Speaker 14:  of changed them into updates now essentially is the naming of them. So

1243
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,120
Speaker 14:  it'd be like the 2022 H two update,

1244
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,030
Speaker 14:  which which sounds very like a code name, but it just means

1245
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:32,500
Speaker 14:  it's the second half of the year. So essentially we've had a couple of those

1246
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,420
Speaker 14:  and we've had a bunch of sort of updates in between as well. So Microsoft

1247
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,110
Speaker 14:  has, has been doing all sorts really. So when I first reviewed

1248
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:44,020
Speaker 14:  Windows 11, I think the main negatives I had about it was

1249
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:47,560
Speaker 14:  it was a bit inconsistent. It felt like a work still in

1250
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,160
Speaker 14:  progress and there was some missing stuff around the task bar like for power

1251
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:55,140
Speaker 14:  users and just a, a bunch of stuff related to to to how you

1252
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:59,080
Speaker 14:  say, say you like drag and drop files into Photoshop and, and work on

1253
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,600
Speaker 14:  them. Like some of that stuff was just missing and it was just, it just

1254
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,480
Speaker 14:  felt like a little bit of a work in progress. So, and I think like two years

1255
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:09,320
Speaker 14:  later it's still a work in progress but it's got

1256
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:13,160
Speaker 14:  better. So like some of the UI stuff that was a bit inconsistent

1257
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,040
Speaker 14:  where they didn't have dark mode in certain places, like they've added it

1258
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,560
Speaker 14:  to like the task management for example and places where it just hasn't

1259
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,800
Speaker 14:  had it for years. So it, it's, it's getting there with the inconsistency

1260
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,740
Speaker 14:  front and like I mentioned the taskforce a lot better now. Stuff like

1261
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,720
Speaker 14:  if you use a tablet for example, you've got a tablet that you're thinking

1262
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,600
Speaker 14:  of upgrading to Windows 11, the touch experience is a lot better now than

1263
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,440
Speaker 14:  it was when it first shipped. And they've done stuff like add tabs to file

1264
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:41,400
Speaker 14:  explorer, like tabs in apps like Notepad and those sort of like small little

1265
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:45,000
Speaker 14:  things. You might not notice them like immediately. But I think it's one

1266
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,400
Speaker 14:  of those cases where if you upgraded to Windows 11, you started using that

1267
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,560
Speaker 14:  stuff and then you went and used Windows 10, you'd be like, huh, where's

1268
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,080
Speaker 14:  my tabs gone? You know. Like it's stuff you get used to when when they do

1269
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:55,480
Speaker 14:  that. So

1270
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's what my experience too is there's, there's not a ton about it

1271
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,940
Speaker 2:  that is like immediately sort of slam dunk life changing

1272
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:05,910
Speaker 2:  and it seems like copilot, which I think is coming this fall

1273
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:09,840
Speaker 2:  just to Windows 11. Yes, that's right. Might be that thing. But until

1274
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,460
Speaker 2:  then it, it does seem like it's, it's like whatever the opposite of death

1275
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,440
Speaker 2:  by a thousand cuts is right? It's like a, a lot of tiny little things that

1276
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,080
Speaker 2:  add up to like it, my experience with Windows 11 over time has gotten

1277
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:24,000
Speaker 2:  meaningfully better but not, I couldn't point you to like one specific

1278
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,190
Speaker 2:  thing that has totally changed my life about it.

1279
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:29,240
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And I think that that's exactly it. Like there's, there's not something

1280
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,640
Speaker 14:  I can say right, you should get 11 because it's gonna do this for you. But

1281
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,360
Speaker 14:  you could say You know there's this tiny bunch of things that add

1282
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,140
Speaker 14:  up into being like a meaningful update that you will

1283
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:43,940
Speaker 14:  get used to. There'll be some changes like the start button changes

1284
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:47,320
Speaker 14:  to the center, you can move it back to the left. There's some stuff to sort

1285
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,320
Speaker 14:  of get used to when you first sort of upgrade but once you're used to all

1286
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,880
Speaker 14:  those sort of changes, I think it does improve the way you use Windows for

1287
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,840
Speaker 14:  sure. Like if it is, it's definitely, it's not the horror update that you

1288
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,780
Speaker 14:  usually get.

1289
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,560
Speaker 2:  It is amazing to me how much I think Vista and

1290
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,320
Speaker 2:  Windows eight have like left this scary taste in people's mouths

1291
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,000
Speaker 2:  about upgrading. 'cause I also feel like it's just just true that it's good

1292
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,200
Speaker 2:  to update for like security reasons, right? Yeah. And I feel like that was

1293
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,440
Speaker 2:  my immediate answer to this is like you should always try to be on the latest

1294
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:20,320
Speaker 2:  version of software because it will be better and safer and more secure if

1295
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,160
Speaker 2:  nothing else that's a victory. And I think that's true, but I

1296
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,000
Speaker 2:  also think people's reluctance to upgrade their perfectly

1297
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,320
Speaker 2:  functional piece of software and gadget is

1298
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:35,160
Speaker 2:  well-founded. And I think over the years every company has

1299
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,470
Speaker 2:  given people reasons not to upgrade.

1300
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:40,480
Speaker 14:  Yeah. You know what, you don't want something that's working fine to just

1301
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,700
Speaker 14:  randomly break because you've updated Windows and Windows usually in that

1302
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:47,320
Speaker 14:  in the past has been a bit clunky when you've updated it. So, but the, the

1303
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:51,200
Speaker 14:  other aspect though is can you even upgrade to Windows 11? Like that's,

1304
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,040
Speaker 14:  that's the sort of bigger question because you might have hardware that

1305
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,800
Speaker 14:  just isn't compatible. So obviously Microsoft cut the, the list of

1306
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,390
Speaker 14:  processes only to ones that were available in the sort of last,

1307
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:05,350
Speaker 14:  well by now like four four to sort of five years also. So

1308
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:09,200
Speaker 14:  talking roughly 2018 onwards I believe in the processes

1309
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,560
Speaker 14:  both on Intel and a md. So you might even be thinking, oh we're not upgrade

1310
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,530
Speaker 14:  to Windows 11 being, might not actually be able to like in an official capacity.

1311
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:19,480
Speaker 14:  There are workarounds out there and all that sort of stuff, but who knows

1312
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,720
Speaker 14:  when those are stopped working and they're not officially supported and

1313
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,960
Speaker 14:  stuff. So, so you might be thinking I wanna upgrade, I've heard good things

1314
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,860
Speaker 14:  about Windows 11, but you'd have to get a new PC technically

1315
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:33,000
Speaker 14:  to, to upgrade officially. Which obviously that's good for Microsoft bottom

1316
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,440
Speaker 14:  line 'cause they sell another Windows license and it's good for OEMs and

1317
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,040
Speaker 14:  stuff, but it's not good for consumers, right. Whereas in the past Windows,

1318
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,680
Speaker 14:  you've able to upgrade pretty much freely. You know, unless you've got a

1319
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,520
Speaker 14:  really ancient pc, you're going back You know 10 or more years. But we

1320
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,440
Speaker 14:  we're seeing increasingly people like the look of Windows 11 and

1321
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,440
Speaker 14:  then they're like, I can't upgrade. So that's, that's definitely another

1322
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,480
Speaker 14:  part of this question is like, you might like the look of it, but you need

1323
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,140
Speaker 14:  to go check to actually see if your system is actually capable of that.

1324
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:00,670
Speaker 14:  So

1325
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:04,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah, and it does seem to me that like if you're in a position where you

1326
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,480
Speaker 2:  can get another year out of your computer before you upgrade, but you

1327
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,440
Speaker 2:  can't yet get Windows 11, like wait a year, right? Like there's nothing to

1328
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,880
Speaker 2:  me so great about Windows 11 that you have to sort of rush out to buy a computer

1329
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,760
Speaker 2:  to get it. But also if you can get it, it's, it's better. You should get

1330
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,680
Speaker 2:  it. For me, honestly, just the part where they've designed most of the

1331
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:27,560
Speaker 2:  settings menus in a new way and nothing falls back to like 20 year

1332
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:31,240
Speaker 2:  old Windows designs when you click on a folder worth it alone, it

1333
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:35,080
Speaker 2:  just, it's so much better. It just makes me so happy. It's, it's a, it's

1334
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,600
Speaker 2:  a nice little thing and there's a lot of things like that like we were talking

1335
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,110
Speaker 2:  about that it, it feels worth it but don't break the bank for it.

1336
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:44,640
Speaker 14:  Yeah, like one of the small additions they did do is when you, when you're

1337
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,160
Speaker 14:  like multitasking with different apps and you're trying to like lay them

1338
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:51,080
Speaker 14:  out, there's like a nice feature that will sort of really guide you

1339
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,140
Speaker 14:  through laying them out in the, in in the perfect way, like snap assist

1340
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:57,770
Speaker 14:  and I think that is, that's definitely worth upgrading for

1341
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:01,560
Speaker 14:  alone. And, and the tab stuff really depends how you use your PC and

1342
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,490
Speaker 14:  what PC you have. Laptop or, or tablet or desktop pc.

1343
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:08,430
Speaker 14:  There, there are some like stuff stuff, there's some stuff in there for

1344
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:11,680
Speaker 14:  like on the gaming side like we've been saying, it's not one of those sort

1345
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,960
Speaker 14:  of like big features where you go, you should upgrade for this, but there

1346
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,650
Speaker 14:  is some improvements to window mode performance and latency for gaming,

1347
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:22,550
Speaker 14:  which is actually kind of useful if you have like a massive ultra wide monitor

1348
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:26,190
Speaker 14:  that you run a game on in a window, you'll get all the sort of

1349
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:30,100
Speaker 14:  latency performance improvements rather than having to run it full screen

1350
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:33,440
Speaker 14:  in that way. And a lot of games aren't obviously optimized to, to run those

1351
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,320
Speaker 14:  sort of ultra wide monitors. So, so there's some, there's some improvements

1352
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,040
Speaker 14:  there as well if you're thinking on the gaming side. So yeah, it's way too

1353
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:44,000
Speaker 14:  many to to list but it's, it's a bunch of of improvements that sort of

1354
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,780
Speaker 14:  all add up

1355
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:48,630
Speaker 2:  And like you said, we're pretty much out of reasons to be afraid to upgrade.

1356
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:52,230
Speaker 2:  Like I think if, if you can do it, it's time. You're good, you're safe.

1357
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:56,100
Speaker 14:  Yeah, I think so. Like yeah I think unless you really love the

1358
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,960
Speaker 14:  old look of Windows, like the old start menu, you really love

1359
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,300
Speaker 14:  those live tiles, which I can't imagine as many people

1360
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,870
Speaker 2:  If you're the one person who loves live tiles.

1361
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:09,630
Speaker 14:  Yeah, yeah. Like if you're in that very small category of people,

1362
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:12,920
Speaker 14:  then sure you might wanna hold off and if you're on a Windows 10 PC and

1363
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,380
Speaker 14:  you're like, everything's working fine, what do I really need? Then sure

1364
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,360
Speaker 14:  You know you can hold off 'cause you're probably gonna buy a new PC at some

1365
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,280
Speaker 14:  point, which will then have probably Windows 12 by that point. So I

1366
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,440
Speaker 14:  wanna see what they do with that. So, 'cause there's, there are rumors of

1367
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,340
Speaker 14:  Windows 12 and they're gonna do some like AI stuff with the chips and stuff.

1368
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:34,260
Speaker 14:  So there's gonna be new hardware coming probably next year that will enable

1369
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,480
Speaker 14:  all that sort of stuff. So that's another potential reason to hold off if

1370
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,120
Speaker 14:  you're thinking about getting a new machine. But I think if you've, if you've

1371
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,840
Speaker 14:  got a machine where you're, you're curious about Windows 11 and you see

1372
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,700
Speaker 14:  all the improvements and you are like stuck on Windows 10, you're like,

1373
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,600
Speaker 14:  I'm not getting any new features here. 'cause nothing is changing, it's

1374
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,190
Speaker 14:  just, it stays as it is then I think you're probably good to upgrade.

1375
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:57,120
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. I like it. All right. Well Jim, I hope that helps Tom. Thank

1376
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,400
Speaker 2:  you. Appreciate it. No

1377
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,870
