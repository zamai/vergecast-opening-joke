00:00:01,615 --> 00:00:05,505
Speaker 1:  Support for this episode comes from Amazon Web Services. The

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:09,025
Speaker 1:  strength of your organization has everything to do with your applications,

4
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:12,865
Speaker 1:  from your back office operations to the applications that connect you to

5
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:16,505
Speaker 1:  your customers and partners. AWS continually innovates their

6
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,985
Speaker 1:  infrastructure and services so you can build, run and scale

7
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:23,865
Speaker 1:  applications in the cloud on premises and at the edge. That's

8
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:27,225
Speaker 1:  why millions of organizations trust AWS for every

9
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:31,105
Speaker 1:  application, wanna develop and deploy secure applications faster

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,705
Speaker 1:  so you can optimize costs and free up time to innovate for your customers.

11
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:38,665
Speaker 1:  Choose AWS and Power virtually any application

12
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:39,425
Speaker 1:  you can imagine.

13
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:47,805
Speaker 3:  Welcome To, The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Network attached storage.

14
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:51,765
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend David Pierce and This is the fourth in our four part series

15
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,965
Speaker 3:  all about connectivity. Over the last few weeks we've dug into the ways we

16
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:58,805
Speaker 3:  connect to content, to each other and to audiences. And

17
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:02,005
Speaker 3:  this week I wanna talk about something a little different. I wanna talk about

18
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:05,845
Speaker 3:  software, how software connects us, how we connect to software,

19
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:10,045
Speaker 3:  and how software connects to other software. And that story, at least

20
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:13,005
Speaker 3:  for our purposes today, starts with the computer I bought a little while

21
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:16,605
Speaker 3:  ago. I bought it on Amazon with essentially no research but I bought it.

22
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:20,565
Speaker 3:  It's called the B Link mini pc. It has 12th generation Intel chips,

23
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:24,405
Speaker 3:  16 gigs of Ram, 500 gigs of SSD storage. It's a fine little

24
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:28,245
Speaker 3:  computer and it's just this little box of a thing about the size of

25
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:32,205
Speaker 3:  like two of the boxes. The iPhone comes in, it's pretty small and I just

26
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:36,245
Speaker 3:  hit it immediately off in the corner of my desk. I bought this thing because

27
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:40,285
Speaker 3:  I wanted to test a theory. That theory is that maybe self-hosting is

28
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:44,245
Speaker 3:  the future of technology. Over the last two decades really we've been

29
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:48,085
Speaker 3:  on this race toward cloud software in which all of the apps and

30
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:52,165
Speaker 3:  platforms and data you use are stored not on your computer but on a

31
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:56,005
Speaker 3:  server somewhere in a Google or Amazon or Microsoft warehouse.

32
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:59,045
Speaker 3:  There are a lot of good reasons for that shift. There are a lot of good things

33
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:02,885
Speaker 3:  about cloud software and there are also a lot of reasons to think cloud

34
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,845
Speaker 3:  software is not going anywhere anytime soon. Here is Peter Van Hardenberg

35
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:10,245
Speaker 3:  who works at a research lab called Ink and Switch explaining the upsides.

36
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:11,165
Speaker 3:  I think pretty well.

37
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,805
Speaker 4:  The idea of the cloud was that hey, it turns out that actually shipping software

38
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:19,125
Speaker 4:  onto people's computers is a huge pain in the neck. It's out of date,

39
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:23,365
Speaker 4:  you can't fix it if it breaks, you have no idea what's happening.

40
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:27,085
Speaker 4:  There's all these problems and I think the biggest thing just from like a,

41
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:30,685
Speaker 4:  like a brass test tax perspective, it's not a technical problem. It was like

42
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:34,445
Speaker 4:  a, an onboarding problem. Cloud software gets users easier.

43
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:38,685
Speaker 3:  We're gonna come back to Peter in a minute I promise. But cloud software

44
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:42,365
Speaker 3:  for all the things, it makes easier and more useful also has lots of

45
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:45,405
Speaker 3:  downsides. It doesn't work offline for one thing because it's not really

46
00:02:45,505 --> 00:02:49,285
Speaker 3:  on your device at all. Also, if that software's developer

47
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:53,125
Speaker 3:  goes away or pivots to something else or just decides not to deal

48
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:57,085
Speaker 3:  with you anymore, the software you rely on can just disappear.

49
00:02:57,465 --> 00:03:00,805
Speaker 3:  The cloud software world is convenient and great, but it's just

50
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:04,805
Speaker 3:  fragile and it is so fundamentally not yours. So

51
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:08,765
Speaker 3:  like I said, I had this theory that self-hosting might be the answer at least

52
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:12,485
Speaker 3:  for important stuff. I figured maybe I should stop relying on cloud services

53
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:16,405
Speaker 3:  and instead build a system that lets me access my own stuff from anywhere

54
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:20,485
Speaker 3:  through tools that I control. So, I bought this B link and started

55
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:24,365
Speaker 3:  setting stuff up. It went poorly. The main thing I discovered

56
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:28,285
Speaker 3:  is that self-hosting is hard. I'm not the world's most technically

57
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:32,205
Speaker 3:  capable person, but I know my way around a computer and still I could

58
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:36,045
Speaker 3:  barely get things up and running. If you wanna like set up a Plex server

59
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:39,485
Speaker 3:  so you can get at your movie collection from anywhere, that's pretty easy.

60
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:43,605
Speaker 3:  But at least in my experience so far, there's essentially nothing else out

61
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:47,485
Speaker 3:  there that is that easy. One great guide I found is from an author and

62
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:51,365
Speaker 3:  entrepreneur named Derek Sives who created a really handy step-by-step system

63
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:55,365
Speaker 3:  for registering a domain, setting up your own cloud storage and

64
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:59,325
Speaker 3:  routing everything from files to email to your calendar, all to that

65
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:02,965
Speaker 3:  system. He calls this guy Tech Independence, which I really like and it is

66
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:06,805
Speaker 3:  really useful. You can get through it without knowing a ton going in, but

67
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:10,085
Speaker 3:  it is so much work and it requires a lot of

68
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:14,045
Speaker 3:  technical sophistication just in the sense of you have to know what

69
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,965
Speaker 3:  terminal is and how to open it, And what to type in and just time and

70
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:21,885
Speaker 3:  energy. It's just a lot. I won't lie to you. I built about halfway

71
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:25,485
Speaker 3:  through the process, I ran into a thing with the FTP server and just gave

72
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:29,125
Speaker 3:  up. One tool I did manage to set up is called Image. It's a

73
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:32,605
Speaker 3:  self-hosted alternative to Google Photos. I was thinking about it at the

74
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,165
Speaker 3:  beginning of this process and realized that if all my cloud stuff were to

75
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:40,045
Speaker 3:  disappear tomorrow, the photos I lost would be the worst part. So

76
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:44,005
Speaker 3:  I wanted to switch them over to something that wouldn't go away and

77
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:47,205
Speaker 3:  image is actually a great tool. It has a nice mobile app, it has lots of

78
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:51,405
Speaker 3:  features, it's a pretty passable Google Photos replacement. But by the

79
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:55,045
Speaker 3:  time I downloaded Docker and was worrying about virtual machines and

80
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,805
Speaker 3:  containers, it was eating all the memory on my computer. I was just back

81
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:02,605
Speaker 3:  to feeling totally over my head. I did eventually get it working, but

82
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:06,285
Speaker 3:  I can't imagine most people are gonna wanna do all of that work. Image was

83
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:10,205
Speaker 3:  created by this guy named Alex Tran and I kept wondering how he felt

84
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:13,645
Speaker 3:  about the setup process. So I called him up and asked him. He told me that

85
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:17,085
Speaker 3:  he started working on Image in the first place because his wife wanted a

86
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:20,605
Speaker 3:  tool like Google Photos but didn't wanna pay for Google Photos, which as

87
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:23,845
Speaker 3:  far as I'm concerned is like an extremely universal opinion on the internet.

88
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:27,845
Speaker 3:  So he set out to build something that was self-hosted and easy

89
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:29,525
Speaker 3:  and he found nothing.

90
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:33,685
Speaker 5:  So when I first started Image, I used image as the

91
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:37,685
Speaker 5:  opportunity for me to learn about You, know how to build nice

92
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:41,685
Speaker 5:  software, how to build good soft software. So I structured it in a way of

93
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:45,565
Speaker 5:  using Docker. Using Docker is actually coming from the idea

94
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:49,565
Speaker 5:  from the community on the self-hosted subreddit that everything should

95
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:52,925
Speaker 5:  be running from Docker because of the ease of

96
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,325
Speaker 5:  development and maintenance. At the time I didn't have a lot, lot of

97
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:01,205
Speaker 5:  experience with Docker, so it's nice, it's perfect for for me to learn how

98
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:05,125
Speaker 5:  to build a Docker image, how to put that into a deployable way.

99
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:09,285
Speaker 5:  So I put everything into Docker Compose and at first

100
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:12,725
Speaker 5:  there were a bunch of setting that you have to do before

101
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:17,445
Speaker 5:  running the docker compose up com command to bring up

102
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:21,245
Speaker 5:  the whole application. And over time that has been

103
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:25,325
Speaker 5:  simplified and now we basically move all of the, anything that you can

104
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:29,365
Speaker 5:  configure through the command, through the environment variable.

105
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:32,925
Speaker 5:  Now you can do it directly inside image. So it's cut out that

106
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:37,165
Speaker 5:  initial configuration to the point now that the only thing that you need

107
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:40,925
Speaker 5:  to change when you're setting up a new MS server is the

108
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:44,925
Speaker 5:  location where you want to sort a file and then you just do docker, compose

109
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:46,165
Speaker 5:  up and then it would run.

110
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:50,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I found the, the, the install package on your website even, which was

111
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:54,605
Speaker 3:  surprisingly simple. I was, I was impressed with how quickly I got

112
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:55,085
Speaker 3:  up and running.

113
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:59,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah, this has gone through a lot of improvement and for

114
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:03,285
Speaker 5:  sure this is coming from the team that has experience with a lot of

115
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:07,245
Speaker 5:  deployment, so I'm really thankful for, for them to help me learn.

116
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:07,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

117
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:11,485
Speaker 3:  That's awesome. But do you think just the fact that it requires

118
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,805
Speaker 3:  Docker kind of immediately rules out most people,

119
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:19,285
Speaker 3:  like I, I don't think I'm gonna convince my wife to like even

120
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:23,205
Speaker 3:  know what Docker is in order to set up a photo server, right? Is

121
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:27,165
Speaker 3:  that just kind of the, the cost of doing software this

122
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:31,045
Speaker 3:  way? Like is there, is there a world in which all of this can be made

123
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:34,725
Speaker 3:  simpler and easier over time and start to feel like

124
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:39,045
Speaker 3:  You know you can install and set up a a server just like installing and

125
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:39,925
Speaker 3:  setting up another app?

126
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:43,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there are a lot of re requests for for that. But from

127
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,845
Speaker 5:  my point of view, when when you are doing something, especially for

128
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,805
Speaker 5:  self-hosting, right, and now when it come to your really important

129
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:55,805
Speaker 5:  data like photo, the person who managed the server

130
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:59,645
Speaker 5:  should have some technical knowledge about managing

131
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,845
Speaker 5:  the server. I think it is a, something that

132
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:07,805
Speaker 5:  self-hosting person should learn is to

133
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:11,605
Speaker 5:  how to use Docker. Because now when you go into the

134
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,205
Speaker 5:  the awesome self-hosted GitHub repository,

135
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,685
Speaker 5:  most of the application you see can be run from Docker

136
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:23,645
Speaker 5:  because it's just make the development easier, more mainstream

137
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:27,085
Speaker 5:  and also the deployment easier and more mainstream.

138
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:31,245
Speaker 5:  For example, you can deploy it on Dian,

139
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,845
Speaker 5:  Ubuntu or Fedora the same way

140
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:38,845
Speaker 5:  without worry about which package should be

141
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:41,885
Speaker 5:  compatible with my digital or with this version.

142
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:46,045
Speaker 5:  Everything is just, just work from the containerization

143
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:46,645
Speaker 5:  standpoint.

144
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:50,965
Speaker 3:  What's your sense of kind of the, the state of the self-hosting movement

145
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,885
Speaker 3:  in general now that you're in it now you've been talking to people. I feel

146
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:58,485
Speaker 3:  like there's been this little crowd of people who really believe in

147
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:02,165
Speaker 3:  self-hosting and they're, they're mostly very technical and they understand

148
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:06,005
Speaker 3:  how to make it work and they know all of the different sort of underlying

149
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:09,565
Speaker 3:  systems and they spend a lot of time in terminal. But I don't feel like the

150
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:13,445
Speaker 3:  self-hosting world has ever quite gotten out of that. But part of me thinks

151
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:17,685
Speaker 3:  it might be starting to happen. Being able to kind of have your stuff

152
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:21,125
Speaker 3:  on your device but access it from anywhere is starting to be a slightly more

153
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,325
Speaker 3:  mainstream thing. What are you seeing, do you think like

154
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:26,525
Speaker 3:  self-hosting is about to hit the big time?

155
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:30,405
Speaker 5:  The reason sentiment is that a lot more people

156
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:34,885
Speaker 5:  are starting to concern more about their privacy with all the story

157
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:38,925
Speaker 5:  that about the third party or the services

158
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:42,885
Speaker 5:  that you use can access your data. So more and more people are starting

159
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:46,445
Speaker 5:  to be noticing that and I, I think

160
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:50,245
Speaker 5:  the more people are starting noticing that, then they will start to find

161
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:54,045
Speaker 5:  a way to get back that control of the data

162
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,605
Speaker 5:  and it would be a good drive to get

163
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:02,525
Speaker 5:  people to look into self-hosting more. But of course this is a

164
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,605
Speaker 5:  very technical field, right? You would need to have some

165
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:10,405
Speaker 5:  IT knowledge, some computer knowledge as well as

166
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:14,325
Speaker 5:  networking et cetera. So that's why it's

167
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:18,045
Speaker 5:  not that easy for other people to get into but someone to

168
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:21,845
Speaker 5:  really be interested in this So I still feel

169
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:25,725
Speaker 5:  like there's some maybe a long way to go in order to get more and more

170
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,685
Speaker 5:  people to get into self-hosting, but with the trend

171
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:33,445
Speaker 5:  of You know high paying CS degree,

172
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:37,845
Speaker 5:  high paying CSS jobs so more people get into computer

173
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,405
Speaker 5:  science so it's exposed them more to these things.

174
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,725
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's gonna be interesting to see if the trend is that more

175
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:48,045
Speaker 3:  people gain these skills or if that these

176
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:52,165
Speaker 3:  tools and systems become simpler and it'll probably be a little of

177
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:55,965
Speaker 3:  both, right? Like do you think there is a path for You know the people

178
00:10:56,105 --> 00:11:00,005
Speaker 3:  who just don't have the interest or expertise to care about Docker

179
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:04,165
Speaker 3:  to maybe in a few years be able to make use of a tool like this? It seems

180
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,765
Speaker 3:  like we're we're kind of one really great user interface

181
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:11,325
Speaker 3:  invention away from this stuff being easier. Do you think there's a way to

182
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:11,565
Speaker 3:  get there?

183
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:16,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we always looking for a way to make it simpler, but as

184
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:19,885
Speaker 5:  of right now, I think with the limitation of the tool that we have and the

185
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:23,445
Speaker 5:  tool that we have access to in order to serve, to

186
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,325
Speaker 5:  fulfill the purpose of high performance, easy to

187
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:31,645
Speaker 5:  maintain right now I don't see a tool better than Docker unless

188
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:35,645
Speaker 5:  we have some invention down the road in this space that compete with

189
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:39,485
Speaker 5:  Docker and to make thing even more streamlined and easier. That

190
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:43,445
Speaker 5:  would be really cool thing to have. But as of right

191
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:47,085
Speaker 5:  now I don't see the al alternative. If you do know

192
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:48,445
Speaker 5:  anything, please let me know.

193
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:54,045
Speaker 3:  By the time I'd finished talking to Alex, I'd sort of given up on the idea

194
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:57,685
Speaker 3:  that self-hosting can be a mainstream solution for people who want

195
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:01,405
Speaker 3:  more ownership and control of their stuff seriously. Just the fact that

196
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:05,525
Speaker 3:  Docker an app that's all about containerized application development might

197
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:09,365
Speaker 3:  become a mainstream thing that people know how to use just seems

198
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:12,885
Speaker 3:  wrong to me. I just don't think that's gonna happen. I don't think it's necessarily

199
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:17,045
Speaker 3:  impossible to make self-hosted systems that are user-friendly and simple.

200
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:20,725
Speaker 3:  I think Plex is actually a really good example of how to do it right, but

201
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:24,525
Speaker 3:  there's just not much else out there that qualifies right now. But as I was

202
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,805
Speaker 3:  asking around trying to figure out what might work if self-hosting doesn't,

203
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,685
Speaker 3:  I heard about this concept that a few people mentioned to me. It's called

204
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:35,405
Speaker 3:  Local First software and when we come back from a quick break, we're gonna

205
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:39,325
Speaker 3:  talk about why local first software might just be the best of both worlds.

206
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:40,165
Speaker 3:  We'll be right back.

207
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:50,675
Speaker 1:  Thank you to Amazon Web Services for sponsoring Vergecast

208
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:55,155
Speaker 1:  AWS has been innovating infrastructure for over 15 years

209
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:59,275
Speaker 1:  so you can build and run secure performance applications faster and

210
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:03,235
Speaker 1:  more economically. That's why AWS pioneered serverless technology

211
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:06,435
Speaker 1:  in 2014 with the launch of AWS Lambda.

212
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:10,475
Speaker 6:  Lambda allows developers to supply snippets of code in

213
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:14,275
Speaker 6:  various languages like Java or Python or otherwise and we

214
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,835
Speaker 6:  run it on their behalf using AWS's power of

215
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:18,475
Speaker 6:  infrastructure.

216
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:22,955
Speaker 1:  AJ NIR is Lambda's general manager with AWS Serverless services

217
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:27,275
Speaker 1:  customers can offload most operational responsibilities to AWS

218
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:31,115
Speaker 1:  and get built-in high availability, scalability and security best

219
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,435
Speaker 1:  practices by default

220
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:36,275
Speaker 6:  And, what that means is they can get a, what we would call a production grade

221
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:40,075
Speaker 6:  application up and running in factors of time that are three to five

222
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:41,595
Speaker 6:  times shorter than it used to be in the past.

223
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:46,275
Speaker 1:  AJ will be back later in the show to tell you more about how AWS

224
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:50,155
Speaker 1:  serverless technologies make it easy to scale and manage cloud applications.

225
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:52,995
Speaker 1:  Reimagine your applications with AWS

226
00:13:56,805 --> 00:14:00,585
Speaker 3:  All, right? We're back. Okay, local first software, let's go back 40

227
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:04,585
Speaker 3:  years or so to the early days of the computer era. Computers were

228
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:08,625
Speaker 3:  huge and boxes and beige and made by a bunch of companies that mostly

229
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,505
Speaker 3:  don't exist anymore. Back then cloud services weren't a thing. Nobody was

230
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:16,025
Speaker 3:  running all their software on servers anywhere because none of that existed.

231
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:20,225
Speaker 3:  People acquired software by like going to a store and buying

232
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:24,105
Speaker 3:  a box that had a disc of some kind in it that you plugged into your computer

233
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:28,345
Speaker 3:  to install a program. That all sounds sort of quaint now. Like can you

234
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:31,345
Speaker 3:  imagine getting in the car and driving to Target every time you wanted to

235
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:35,185
Speaker 3:  get a new app on your phone? Hard pass. It's all much better now. But that

236
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:38,625
Speaker 3:  approach did have one really nice side effect. Your software was

237
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:42,425
Speaker 3:  yours, it was installed on your computer locally.

238
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:46,225
Speaker 3:  If the company that made your game went out of business, you might not get

239
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:49,825
Speaker 3:  updates but your game would still run fine on your computer. If the

240
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:53,765
Speaker 3:  developer of your productivity app made some horrible UI change you hate,

241
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:57,565
Speaker 3:  no problem, just don't buy the next version. That's how software worked for

242
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:01,445
Speaker 3:  a long, long time. One way to think about it is that our computers used to

243
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:05,285
Speaker 3:  be the home for our software and now they're just the way that we access

244
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:09,125
Speaker 3:  software that lives somewhere else. That difference feels small but it

245
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:12,965
Speaker 3:  actually totally changes the way we think about what our devices actually

246
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:16,485
Speaker 3:  do. Which brings us back to Peter from before. Remember the cloud services

247
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:20,525
Speaker 3:  guy from Ink and Switch, he is a big believer and promoter of the idea

248
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:24,485
Speaker 3:  of local first software, which he thinks can combine the best of all

249
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:28,205
Speaker 3:  of the last four decades of software. Basically in a local first

250
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:32,005
Speaker 3:  world, your apps live on your device just like they did 40 years ago.

251
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:35,765
Speaker 3:  They are yours. Your software belongs to you and you can access them

252
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:39,765
Speaker 3:  offline or without worrying that they'll still be around tomorrow. But you

253
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:43,165
Speaker 3:  can also connect that software to the cloud and get all of the collaboration

254
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:47,005
Speaker 3:  and multi-device sync and in general the convenience benefits

255
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:50,245
Speaker 3:  of having it in the cloud. This sounds like the best of both worlds, right?

256
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:53,965
Speaker 3:  This is how it should all work. I think So I called up Peter to ask him

257
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:57,925
Speaker 3:  how It works, why he's such a big believer in the idea and why

258
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,405
Speaker 3:  software didn't turn out that way in the first place. He started by telling

259
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:05,325
Speaker 3:  me a story about a music app that I certainly had not thought about in

260
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:09,045
Speaker 3:  a long time and I bet you haven't either. It's called R-D-O-R-D-O

261
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:12,885
Speaker 4:  Was a great piece of software but the offline mode for the RDO

262
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:16,885
Speaker 4:  app was like a whole other program from the main app. It had

263
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:19,525
Speaker 4:  different features, it behaved in different ways, it had different bugs.

264
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:22,885
Speaker 4:  And I just remember this feeling of like why

265
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:27,445
Speaker 4:  was the song I just listened to and the playlist I was just looking

266
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:30,925
Speaker 4:  at where did they go when I went into offline mode

267
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:34,765
Speaker 4:  because I had them here. And so in a sense what was happening is that this

268
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,205
Speaker 4:  app was deleting my data, right? And like there's a more sophistic like I'm

269
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,725
Speaker 4:  a developer, these are my friends who built this app, I've worked on this

270
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:44,205
Speaker 4:  stuff. I know the real answer is more complicated, which is that like You

271
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:48,125
Speaker 4:  know the kind of normal way of building apps in this era is that

272
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:52,125
Speaker 4:  you have a server which is where the software really lives and the

273
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,205
Speaker 4:  thing that you hold on your, in your hand or the thing that you have on your

274
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:58,645
Speaker 4:  computer in front of you, that's not really the program that's just like

275
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:02,445
Speaker 4:  a mask in front of the program and it talks to the program on your behalf

276
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:06,005
Speaker 4:  and it presents like a pretend version of the program. That's what you use.

277
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:09,405
Speaker 4:  And I had this feeling of like especially though if you have an offline mode

278
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,805
Speaker 4:  then you need to have the program. 'cause you can't talk to the program when

279
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:16,765
Speaker 4:  there's no internet, right? But it's crazy 'cause everybody's building like

280
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:20,645
Speaker 4:  this sophisticated program that running it in the cloud and then on

281
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:24,205
Speaker 4:  the mobile app in the device for offline mode, they run smaller worse

282
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:27,565
Speaker 4:  versions of it that don't actually work the same way. And I was just like,

283
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:31,365
Speaker 4:  how about this? How about we write the program, we run it on our computers

284
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,645
Speaker 4:  and then we talk to the cloud to get the data and then we have the data in

285
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:38,485
Speaker 4:  our computers whether they're in our pockets or on our laptops or

286
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:42,165
Speaker 4:  whatever. 'cause like when you go in an airplane or in a taxi

287
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:46,445
Speaker 4:  or take Muni and your computer just turns into a paperweight, that

288
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:50,365
Speaker 4:  sucks. And not only that but like I was a huge fan of RDO. I know

289
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:53,805
Speaker 4:  a lot of people who loved RDO. You can't use it anymore, right? You can't

290
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:57,485
Speaker 4:  use it anymore because you never had it. I can still run winamp,

291
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:01,645
Speaker 4:  I can go and download winamp and I can run winamp today. I can find

292
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:05,405
Speaker 4:  all those sweet skins from the 1990s. I can use Winamp but r d's gone

293
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:09,045
Speaker 4:  forever. And as I got deeper into this stuff, the more I started to think

294
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:13,005
Speaker 4:  about that and the more I realized that like not only is this just

295
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,285
Speaker 4:  an inconvenience for me it's it's a disappointment, right? Like RIP Google

296
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:20,725
Speaker 4:  Reader or whatever your favorite cloud software that's gone. But like

297
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:24,965
Speaker 4:  we are in a dark age of software. And I mean that not in like the

298
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:28,685
Speaker 4:  sense that the software is bad. What I mean is that every piece of

299
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:31,765
Speaker 4:  software that runs today that's built the way we build software, everything

300
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:35,605
Speaker 4:  we built on Heroku where we used You know I used to work, all that stuff

301
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:39,565
Speaker 4:  is going to disappear irrevocably soon. And

302
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:42,645
Speaker 4:  everything that we've built and everything that we've done in this era, all

303
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:46,085
Speaker 4:  of our collective communal work will be lost.

304
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,525
Speaker 3:  The thing you're describing though, where it sort of matches

305
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,965
Speaker 3:  the best of those two things, this idea of local first software, how did

306
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:57,885
Speaker 3:  we not get to that sooner that that seems like anyone sort of looking

307
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:01,725
Speaker 3:  at this for a long time should have thought what if I had the app on my device?

308
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,405
Speaker 3:  Like RDO is such an interesting example, right? Like the people at RDO did

309
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:09,045
Speaker 3:  they just not think someday this will all be gone. Wouldn't it be nice like

310
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,205
Speaker 3:  this is one of the things I go back and forth with with all this software

311
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,485
Speaker 3:  is I understand all the reasons it's easier to build cloud first software

312
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:18,045
Speaker 3:  and that it's more you make more money doing it. That that all makes sense

313
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,645
Speaker 3:  but but part of me wonders like is the reason just that people don't care

314
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:22,605
Speaker 3:  about the flip side?

315
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:26,485
Speaker 4:  I don't think that's it. I think there are a few elements here but

316
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:30,005
Speaker 4:  a lot of it comes, there's two things. There's a technical challenge and

317
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:33,845
Speaker 4:  there's a narrative dimension. Okay? The narrative dimension is

318
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:37,565
Speaker 4:  that You know everybody wants to build the next big

319
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:41,485
Speaker 4:  startup and make a billion dollars venture capitalists are

320
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:45,285
Speaker 4:  telling everybody that's how to build software. Everybody thinks that

321
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,405
Speaker 4:  they have to build for Google scale, they're gonna need

322
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:52,165
Speaker 4:  Cassandra, they're gonna have a billion users, they're gonna be You know

323
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:55,565
Speaker 4:  it, this ends the rocket ship, You know just hop on. And like

324
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:59,325
Speaker 4:  when you approach building software with this mindset,

325
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:03,245
Speaker 4:  then you reach for the tools that other people who have done this task have

326
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:07,005
Speaker 4:  used. And so a big part of it as well is that like You know

327
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,925
Speaker 4:  there's like a, the term is path dependence, right? Like we started

328
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:13,965
Speaker 4:  making cloud software and we're like oh this is great. And then we just kept

329
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:17,205
Speaker 4:  piling more and more energy onto that trying to solve the problems of it.

330
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:21,285
Speaker 4:  And there was very little investment on this other axis.

331
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,725
Speaker 4:  You know there was like the offline first movement, which I think You know

332
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:28,645
Speaker 4:  is a closely related precursor but like the narrative has

333
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,085
Speaker 4:  been like well why do you want that? The cloud solves all our problems, right?

334
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:35,725
Speaker 4:  Like internet is everywhere. You've got wifi at home, you've got wifi, you

335
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:39,045
Speaker 4:  make a hotspot with your phone, everyone's got internet all the time. What's

336
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:42,965
Speaker 4:  the big deal? Just wait. It'll be there. And so first that's not true. I

337
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:45,925
Speaker 4:  mean there is internet more and more places. But the other thing is this

338
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:49,805
Speaker 4:  kind of like the consequences of the cloud took a long time to become clear.

339
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:54,005
Speaker 4:  Hmm. Right? When we started working on Heroku You know

340
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:57,005
Speaker 4:  and back in the day there wasn't killed by

341
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,765
Speaker 4:  google.com right? We didn't have a history of apps that had come and

342
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:03,965
Speaker 4:  gone and now we're lost because we hadn't had time to go through that sort

343
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:07,765
Speaker 4:  of generational cycle. So I think a lot of the problems have

344
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:10,845
Speaker 4:  You know as so often as the case have emerged over time, right? If you look

345
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:14,605
Speaker 4:  at the oil era, nobody was like hey this awesome energy source might

346
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,685
Speaker 4:  turn out to have some consequences someday. People are like this is amazing.

347
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:20,565
Speaker 4:  I can go see my aunt and I don't have to like feed a horse to get there.

348
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:21,205
Speaker 4:  That's

349
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:24,805
Speaker 3:  Very fair. And it does seem like You know, you mentioned the narrative side

350
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:28,245
Speaker 3:  and the technological side and it does seem like with sort of the,

351
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:32,645
Speaker 3:  I don't know, manifesto of local first software, you did try to get at

352
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:36,045
Speaker 3:  both of those. 'cause I think one of the questions I came into this with

353
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:39,925
Speaker 3:  was like to what extent is the kind of heady case

354
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:43,125
Speaker 3:  for data ownership and

355
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,445
Speaker 3:  longevity and the idea of like having a space on the

356
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:50,525
Speaker 3:  internet that's mine. How far does that really get you? And I feel like you

357
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:53,805
Speaker 3:  do make some of that case and I'm curious how broadly effective you think

358
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:56,845
Speaker 3:  that case can be. But then there is also like at some point you just have

359
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:59,765
Speaker 3:  to build better products And I feel like one thing I'd liked about the way

360
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:03,525
Speaker 3:  you guys approached it is you also make the case that this is a way to make

361
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:04,165
Speaker 3:  better products.

362
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:08,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think these kinds of philosophical perspectives

363
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:12,445
Speaker 4:  will motivate a certain audience but I think that when you

364
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:15,925
Speaker 4:  make the right thing, the easy thing people will do it. It's as simple as

365
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:19,725
Speaker 4:  that. If it's cheaper and easier to build software local

366
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:23,485
Speaker 4:  first, then people will do it. And so what we do is we just

367
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:27,165
Speaker 4:  focus on that problem which is You know we care about some of these things

368
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,565
Speaker 4:  and we know there are people who care about some of these things and that's

369
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:32,885
Speaker 4:  great and there are like people with privacy concerns like activists and

370
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:36,645
Speaker 4:  so on. But like I think when you look at those narrow

371
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:40,485
Speaker 4:  niche markets, those those audiences, they're great people with real problems

372
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:44,325
Speaker 4:  and it's great to be able to help people who have those problems. But like

373
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:48,285
Speaker 4:  we all want software that works. We all hate when the thing doesn't

374
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:52,125
Speaker 4:  go, when the keystrokes are too slow and you hit submit and you get a

375
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,605
Speaker 4:  spinner. Like, and if we can just make it easier to build software in a way

376
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:59,325
Speaker 4:  where that just doesn't happen or happens less, then I think

377
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:02,445
Speaker 4:  everybody will be happy. So just make the right thing the easy thing you

378
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:05,965
Speaker 4:  were saying, oh earlier like is it harder to build software this way? It's

379
00:23:05,965 --> 00:23:09,725
Speaker 4:  impossible to build software the way we build software. It's

380
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:13,325
Speaker 4:  costs a fortune to build software the way we build software. You need to

381
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,405
Speaker 4:  learn Kubernetes. There's like literally like

382
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:20,445
Speaker 4:  203 letter acronym services that constitute Amazon

383
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,925
Speaker 4:  web services. And then on top of that you have to learn go multi-cloud and

384
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:27,485
Speaker 4:  learn how to do it on Google and Microsoft as well. It's

385
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:31,445
Speaker 4:  impossible to build software today the way we build software, it's like

386
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:35,605
Speaker 4:  you wanna like go to the grocery store and you gotta use

387
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:39,645
Speaker 4:  all the technology to build an aircraft carrier to get there. What

388
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:43,605
Speaker 4:  we need is bicycles, right? But all we're building is aircraft carriers and

389
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:46,885
Speaker 4:  this is like the Jonathan Edwards line, right? We were promised bicycles

390
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:50,805
Speaker 4:  for the mine but we got aircraft carriers instead. Yeah. Like it's so

391
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:54,405
Speaker 4:  complicated to build anything in the cloud. And then on top of that, once

392
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:58,125
Speaker 4:  you do, you figure out your GraphQL and whether you use Postgres or

393
00:23:58,255 --> 00:24:02,165
Speaker 4:  Mongo and like what front end framework and node or

394
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:06,245
Speaker 4:  go on the backend and do you need to use auth zero? Do you need to use this?

395
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,245
Speaker 4:  Do you need like all these cloud services, you put it all together, you get

396
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:12,005
Speaker 4:  the damn thing running and now you gotta pay every month to keep the thing

397
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:15,325
Speaker 4:  online and when anything falls over, you get paged in the middle of the night,

398
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:19,165
Speaker 4:  woken up, it's impossible to build software and if you do you're gonna regret

399
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:21,325
Speaker 4:  it 'cause it's gonna cost you a fortune and wake you up.

400
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:25,725
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And most of the pieces of that equation you have absolutely no

401
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:29,285
Speaker 3:  control over. Like I, I'm reminded of this every time AWS goes down

402
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:33,205
Speaker 3:  and it's like oh the internet dies whenever a Wix has an issue. Like

403
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,805
Speaker 3:  fundamentally we rely on Amazon to keep its data centers up

404
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:39,965
Speaker 3:  to like live our lives and that's bonkers.

405
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:44,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah And also hilarious is just that like we've so totally

406
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:47,445
Speaker 4:  broken the internet as this like mesh network

407
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:51,845
Speaker 4:  that literally if you and I were in the same room recording this call,

408
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:56,045
Speaker 4:  all of our data would probably be bouncing off of US East one in Ashburn,

409
00:24:56,325 --> 00:25:00,045
Speaker 4:  Virginia and back to each other's laptops just so that we could collaborate.

410
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:03,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's wild. I think there's a bunch of other interesting problems.

411
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:07,885
Speaker 4:  I mean like there's interesting challenges around like You know the

412
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:11,205
Speaker 4:  networking stuff, right? It's called a browser not a keeper.

413
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:15,645
Speaker 4:  All this app that I'm looking at right now as we're talking, when I close

414
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:18,685
Speaker 4:  and open the tab, it's not gonna be saved. I can't come back to this work.

415
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:22,965
Speaker 4:  And the browser really assumes that you're just kind of grazing as you use

416
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:26,605
Speaker 4:  your computer but it's become the main platform for software. And so then

417
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:30,045
Speaker 4:  there's Electron which is like a wrapper around a browser with a bunch of

418
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:33,045
Speaker 4:  bells and whistles. But like all this stuff feels kind of unsatisfying and

419
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:36,805
Speaker 4:  I think You know it's tough when like the incentives

420
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:41,005
Speaker 4:  of the organization that builds the most important piece of software on your

421
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:44,765
Speaker 4:  computer are to sell you ads. Like the platform

422
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:48,525
Speaker 4:  we all live every day in is run by an ad company

423
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:51,805
Speaker 4:  and You know lots of great people at Google, they care about these problems

424
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:55,525
Speaker 4:  but like there's just an incentive structure here that's not

425
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:58,925
Speaker 4:  favorable for solving these problems. Yeah. And so there's, there's some

426
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:02,525
Speaker 4:  of that dimension. But I think in terms of like value and

427
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:06,725
Speaker 4:  priority, I think one thing that we are really interested in at

428
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:10,525
Speaker 4:  in Can switch is what we call malleable software after Philip S's

429
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:14,485
Speaker 4:  PhD. And this is this idea that like we live in this weird

430
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:18,165
Speaker 4:  world where like computers again are meant to be this like very powerful

431
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:21,925
Speaker 4:  compositional informational environment but increasingly like

432
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:24,965
Speaker 4:  all of the software we use are these like closed boxes

433
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,325
Speaker 4:  that are given to you by somebody else and you can't do anything with You

434
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:33,205
Speaker 4:  know and So I like to think of the ideal computing

435
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:37,045
Speaker 4:  environment as being like a wood shop or a kitchen. Like in my

436
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:41,005
Speaker 4:  kitchen I can make Indian food or Japanese food. I can go and like

437
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:44,965
Speaker 4:  reheat some leftovers and like I have not too many kitchen

438
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:48,005
Speaker 4:  gadgets but like you can go a long way with a chef's knife and a cutting

439
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:51,965
Speaker 4:  board and like You know a stand mixer. Yeah You know to measuring

440
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:55,685
Speaker 4:  screens like you, you can do a lot with like a few good elements

441
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:59,725
Speaker 4:  but like the software world is very much like You know, oh this note taking

442
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:03,285
Speaker 4:  app. Can't open the notes from that note taking app And So I think a lot

443
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:06,365
Speaker 4:  about like once we have local first software for us this is really just the

444
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:09,885
Speaker 4:  first step, right? If the software is local first and you have the software,

445
00:27:10,235 --> 00:27:14,165
Speaker 4:  then just like if you bring shelving home from Ikea, You know you can decide

446
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,645
Speaker 4:  whether or not you wanna put all the shelves in or if you wanna set it up

447
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:20,205
Speaker 4:  on its side or upright if you want to cut the legs off the chairs

448
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:23,445
Speaker 4:  'cause you're short You know you wanna paint it a different color to match

449
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:27,205
Speaker 4:  your space. We're really interested in this problem of like once

450
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:30,925
Speaker 4:  we have the software, can we start to actually use it? Can we make it our

451
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:34,805
Speaker 4:  own? As we see the local first movement start to build steam, we see

452
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:38,445
Speaker 4:  so many people getting involved. Our vision is starting to look forward

453
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:42,605
Speaker 4:  to like the next frontier which is actually empowering users to

454
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:47,365
Speaker 4:  not have to care about these things but to be able to care about these

455
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:51,205
Speaker 4:  things, right? And in your home, if you have a challenge you might go to

456
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:53,845
Speaker 4:  the hardware store and buy the things and fix it for yourself or you might

457
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:57,565
Speaker 4:  hire a handyman or maybe you live in an apartment and you call your super

458
00:27:57,755 --> 00:28:01,565
Speaker 4:  sure right? But whatever that relationship you have to that space is,

459
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:05,205
Speaker 4:  it's something that you can have agency and make choices about. And we think

460
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:08,645
Speaker 4:  that all computing environments should have those properties and we wanna

461
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,605
Speaker 4:  start figuring out how to bring that next to the broader world and and that's

462
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:16,325
Speaker 4:  kind of where we think about where this goes after we start to see local

463
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:17,285
Speaker 4:  first software take off.

464
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:21,985
Speaker 3:  This is all kind of heady I know, but the app that I was thinking about

465
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:25,905
Speaker 3:  that helped me understand the idea is this note taking app called Obsidian.

466
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:29,225
Speaker 3:  You might have used it, it's pretty popular. It's a great app. Big fan Obsidian

467
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:32,465
Speaker 3:  is above all just an app you download to your computer that reads and writes

468
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:36,105
Speaker 3:  text files. If you boil it all the way down, that's what it's the company

469
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:40,025
Speaker 3:  offers a service for syncing your files. But that's a separate thing. And

470
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:42,865
Speaker 3:  if obsidian goes outta business, you can always sync through Google Drive

471
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:46,545
Speaker 3:  or Dropbox or lots of other things. And Obsidian is built on a

472
00:28:46,545 --> 00:28:50,345
Speaker 3:  plugin system. So the main app is really basic but you can add all kinds

473
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:54,065
Speaker 3:  of functionality just by downloading a bit of code or even writing some yourself.

474
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:57,785
Speaker 3:  If obsidian ever goes away, you'll still have the app. If a plugin ever

475
00:28:57,785 --> 00:29:01,465
Speaker 3:  disappears, you'll still have the version that you installed. And if for

476
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:04,865
Speaker 3:  some reason way down the road the app ever stops working entirely,

477
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,505
Speaker 3:  you'll still have your folder of text files because that's all it is anyway

478
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:12,425
Speaker 3:  and you can just take them somewhere else. Obsidian the company is building

479
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:16,305
Speaker 3:  new tools for sharing and publishing and lots of other stuff because again,

480
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:19,305
Speaker 3:  the cloud is a good thing. There are lots of upsides but you don't have to

481
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:22,585
Speaker 3:  use any of them. And if obsidian goes away you'll still have obsidian

482
00:29:23,015 --> 00:29:26,505
Speaker 3:  that is local first software right there. I love it. All, right? We have

483
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,905
Speaker 3:  to take one more break and then we have one more big idea about software

484
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:30,585
Speaker 3:  to talk about. We'll be right back.

485
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,235
Speaker 7:  Fox Creative,

486
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:42,365
Speaker 1:  This is advertiser content brought to you by Amazon Web Services.

487
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:47,605
Speaker 1:  AJ Nir from AWS says there's an easy way to understand the

488
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:49,685
Speaker 1:  benefits of serverless app development.

489
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:54,045
Speaker 6:  So, I. Think about serverless closer to the concept of wireless,

490
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:57,645
Speaker 1:  Meaning the servers are there, you just don't have to think about it.

491
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,725
Speaker 6:  They become our problem to worry about.

492
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:03,965
Speaker 1:  That means no infrastructure to provision or manage no operating

493
00:30:03,965 --> 00:30:07,845
Speaker 1:  systems to install, upgrade or patch AWS takes care of it all

494
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:08,245
Speaker 1:  for you.

495
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,845
Speaker 6:  A lot of the innovation we see in the market today I don't believe would

496
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:15,485
Speaker 6:  have been possible if something like cloud services did not exist as the

497
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:16,045
Speaker 6:  accelerant.

498
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:20,205
Speaker 1:  That's because serverless technologies from Amazon help customers

499
00:30:20,205 --> 00:30:23,685
Speaker 1:  across industries do two very important things. First,

500
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:27,685
Speaker 1:  serverless technologies eliminate operational overhead so your teams

501
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:31,205
Speaker 1:  can release quickly, get feedback and iterate to get to market faster.

502
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:34,445
Speaker 6:  The customer is always gonna pick the one who meets their needs faster.

503
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:38,645
Speaker 1:  Second, AWS serverless solutions reduce total

504
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:42,485
Speaker 1:  cost of ownership with a pay for value billing model. So you never

505
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:44,125
Speaker 1:  pay for resources, you don't need

506
00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:47,885
Speaker 6:  The total cost of ownership and infrastructure costs are lower than what

507
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:50,765
Speaker 6:  they would do if they were building on their own. I continue to marvel that

508
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:54,525
Speaker 6:  when we see companies that are built by one and two people that are serving

509
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:58,285
Speaker 6:  millions of customers and helping millions of people around the world do

510
00:30:58,285 --> 00:31:02,165
Speaker 6:  things better. And those are the kind of accelerations that happen when customers

511
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:02,965
Speaker 6:  use cloud services.

512
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:07,325
Speaker 1:  Learn how a Wix serverless technologies can help you

513
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:10,085
Speaker 1:  accelerate innovation and lower TCO if your

514
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:13,765
Speaker 1:  applications@go.aws slash every

515
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:14,085
Speaker 1:  app

516
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:22,765
Speaker 3:  All, right? We're back as I was working on this episode and trying to figure

517
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:26,525
Speaker 3:  out what it means to take back some control of our software and our

518
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:30,405
Speaker 3:  devices. I was also reading a new book called The Internet Con by Cory

519
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:34,525
Speaker 3:  Dro. If you've never heard of Cory, he's an activist and author and blogger

520
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:38,045
Speaker 3:  and he's been thinking about the way that the internet should work for a

521
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:41,805
Speaker 3:  really long time. And this book is basically a step-by-step guide

522
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:45,685
Speaker 3:  for how to take down the tech giants. He argues, as he often does,

523
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:49,765
Speaker 3:  that the internet is run by a few huge companies. That's a problem and

524
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:53,685
Speaker 3:  we should stop it. Most of that is a conversation for another day. And

525
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:56,885
Speaker 3:  I don't agree with all of Corey's thoughts on the subject, but it's a really

526
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:59,885
Speaker 3:  good book. It's really interesting and worth reading. The thing that jumped

527
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:03,645
Speaker 3:  out at me most about it was Corey's specific idea for how to

528
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:07,605
Speaker 3:  improve our tech situation. He doesn't argue for breaking up the tech giants

529
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,445
Speaker 3:  or reinventing capitalism altogether, though I suspect he'd be cool with

530
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:15,005
Speaker 3:  both of those things. He actually makes the case that interoperability different

531
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:18,845
Speaker 3:  apps and platforms being compatible with one another is pretty close

532
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:22,645
Speaker 3:  to a one stop fix for everything. Ever since I read the book, I

533
00:32:22,645 --> 00:32:25,765
Speaker 3:  haven't been able to stop thinking about that idea that maybe instead of

534
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:29,165
Speaker 3:  going back to having all my data only on my device or

535
00:32:29,475 --> 00:32:33,405
Speaker 3:  only using software that works offline, the solution is just to make it so

536
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:37,485
Speaker 3:  easy to move between services that a few of them going away wouldn't

537
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:41,045
Speaker 3:  make a difference. I guess like if the whole internet goes down, you're still

538
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:44,885
Speaker 3:  in trouble, but we're in big trouble anyway if the internet goes down. Anyway,

539
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:48,925
Speaker 3:  I wanted to understand why Corey thought interop was the answer. Like

540
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:52,885
Speaker 3:  the answer So I called him up to figure it out. The biggest picture thing

541
00:32:52,885 --> 00:32:56,605
Speaker 3:  you talk about is interoperability and the idea that what we should do is

542
00:32:56,865 --> 00:33:00,685
Speaker 3:  by hook or by crook, open all these platforms to each other

543
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:04,485
Speaker 3:  and to others. And then I think if I'm not misunderstanding, this

544
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:08,525
Speaker 3:  web standards are the fastest way to get there, right? Like I, I've, I feel

545
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:11,085
Speaker 3:  like I've spent the last year or so talking to people and betting on the

546
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:14,085
Speaker 3:  idea that like the open web can be the solution to a lot of our

547
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:18,725
Speaker 3:  platform problems. If only we allowed it to be you're, you're making a face.

548
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:19,325
Speaker 3:  Tell me what you think

549
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:22,485
Speaker 8:  So I would say. It's not quite web standards are how we get there. 'cause

550
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:26,365
Speaker 8:  first of all, web standards are mandatory. So we've all seen ver

551
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:29,925
Speaker 8:  versions of embrace and extend So. I would say that there has to be a

552
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,645
Speaker 8:  two-pronged approach. One is rules about what you must do.

553
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:37,165
Speaker 8:  So we might say to Facebook, you have to open up a gateway and that might

554
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:39,525
Speaker 8:  be through legislation but it might be through a settlement, right? Like

555
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:42,765
Speaker 8:  Facebook and Twitter and all these other companies, they're just incapable

556
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:46,245
Speaker 8:  of coloring within the lines. They're just like pathological cheaters. Yeah.

557
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:50,285
Speaker 8:  And so they're all already under multiple FTC consent

558
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:54,205
Speaker 8:  decrees and European Commission consent decrees and whatever. And they're

559
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:57,925
Speaker 8:  all violating them and they're all eventually going to be

560
00:33:57,925 --> 00:34:01,485
Speaker 8:  dragged into a situation where they're gonna seek a settlement. And so we

561
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:04,165
Speaker 8:  might as a settlement say, oh you have to stand up these gateways.

562
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:07,645
Speaker 3:  But like in theory the the eus legislation about interoperability between

563
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,805
Speaker 3:  messaging apps, that's the kind of thing you're talking about, right? Yeah.

564
00:34:09,805 --> 00:34:09,965
Speaker 3:  And

565
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,325
Speaker 8:  The digital markets act, it's not just messaging apps, it's a whole bunch

566
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:16,925
Speaker 8:  of different platforms. They're just starting with messaging, which sure

567
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:20,325
Speaker 8:  we can talk about this later, I think is a mistake. They should be starting

568
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:23,565
Speaker 8:  with social media messaging if they screw it up is gonna like expose

569
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:27,685
Speaker 8:  dissidents and other people to leaks in their messaging. And yeah, it's like

570
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:31,445
Speaker 8:  the next Jamal Khashoggi who's murdered the way Jamal Khashoggi was

571
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:35,365
Speaker 8:  by someone exploiting a defect in the instant messaging tools that he

572
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,925
Speaker 8:  uses to lu him to his death is gonna discredit this whole project. I, it's

573
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:42,725
Speaker 8:  a huge mistake, but it's not just those mandates, right? Like 'cause that's

574
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:46,645
Speaker 8:  gonna roll out over 10 years. In the in parallel there's like Facebook violating

575
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:50,485
Speaker 8:  its consent decree. Google does violating consent decree, Twitter violating

576
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:54,365
Speaker 8:  all of these other rules. You know and they're gonna in

577
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:57,645
Speaker 8:  parallel with this. Someone might just say like, okay, well if you wanna

578
00:34:57,825 --> 00:35:01,565
Speaker 8:  not be fined 10 x your market cap and

579
00:35:01,635 --> 00:35:05,245
Speaker 8:  live to fight another day, you're gonna have to consent to standing up this

580
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:08,725
Speaker 8:  interoperable gateway. Twitter is gonna have to offer a activity pub gateway

581
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:12,365
Speaker 8:  or something. Right? And the problem with that is it's very hard to

582
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:16,285
Speaker 8:  administer that remedy. And we're getting into some wonky sort of

583
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:20,125
Speaker 8:  public administration stuff here. But like say we say to Facebook,

584
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:24,445
Speaker 8:  you have to stand up a gateway to activity pub so people can leave, go to

585
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:28,125
Speaker 8:  a masto on server, but still be connected to the people that matter to them

586
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:31,365
Speaker 8:  and the customers and the communities and all the things that they're sort

587
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:34,805
Speaker 8:  of glued to Facebook by. But then Facebook shuts down that gateway

588
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:37,885
Speaker 8:  and says, we shut it down. 'cause we thought there was another Cambridge

589
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:42,045
Speaker 8:  Analytica that was stealing a billion users data, which is a thing that actual

590
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:45,485
Speaker 8:  future Cambridge Analytica are gonna try to do, right? Sure. They're gonna

591
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:49,325
Speaker 8:  try to exploit this APO, we just saw You know 23 and me get scraped for

592
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:53,205
Speaker 8:  however many million ashkenazis genetic records. And it is

593
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:57,165
Speaker 8:  just like a, as an Ashkenazi person, a very creepy sentence to say You know.

594
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:00,645
Speaker 8:  And so we are gonna want them to like have an intrusion detection system

595
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:04,645
Speaker 8:  in a firewall and security engineers. But how do you distinguish the pretext

596
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:07,885
Speaker 8:  from the reality, right? When, when, when Facebook says, oh we're shutting

597
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:11,645
Speaker 8:  this down once a week because we're worried about VULs

598
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:15,965
Speaker 8:  and act of attacks when everybody understands Facebook's

599
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,725
Speaker 8:  infrastructure is to a first approximation of Facebook employee and

600
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:23,445
Speaker 8:  you're like deposing these people and spending like years arguing about whether

601
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:27,285
Speaker 8:  this was a pretext or not. In the meantime, the new market

602
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:30,045
Speaker 8:  entrance, these Mastodon servers or whatever it is that have stood up to

603
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:33,965
Speaker 8:  like welcome in Facebook refugees that were evacuating from Facebook,

604
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:37,645
Speaker 8:  those users are learning that they can't rely on them. The

605
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,125
Speaker 8:  financiers, the banks or the individuals who funded them are learning that

606
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,805
Speaker 8:  you shouldn't fund these projects. And the people who started them are learning

607
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,405
Speaker 8:  that it's not a, it's not a fruitful thing to do with their time. It's a

608
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,365
Speaker 8:  waste of their time. So you also need to

609
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:55,325
Speaker 8:  legalize the stuff that Facebook did to MySpace. So when Facebook started,

610
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:59,325
Speaker 8:  everybody was MySpace user and they didn't just say, Hey come

611
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:03,165
Speaker 8:  hang out on Facebook. We have a better user interface. Eventually your

612
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:05,845
Speaker 8:  friends might show up and in the meantime you could admire our great color

613
00:37:05,845 --> 00:37:09,365
Speaker 8:  choices. They said like, here's a bot, give it your login,

614
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:12,885
Speaker 8:  give it your password, it'll go to MySpace several times a day.

615
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:16,685
Speaker 8:  Impersonate you log in, scrape your inbox, put it in your Facebook inbox

616
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:20,445
Speaker 8:  and let you autopilot your responses back out to Facebook. So you to MySpace

617
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:23,965
Speaker 8:  so you can eat your cake and have it too. So what if we re legalize that

618
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:26,925
Speaker 8:  conduct? 'cause You know when people try to do that to Facebook like Power

619
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:30,765
Speaker 8:  Ventures did or OG app or other other tools that have popped

620
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:33,845
Speaker 8:  up to do this to Facebook. Facebook just soos them into like radioactive

621
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:37,445
Speaker 8:  rubble, right? Computer fraud abuse Act, DMC 1201

622
00:37:37,485 --> 00:37:41,045
Speaker 8:  tortious interference with contract, patent, trademark, copyright, all these

623
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:44,965
Speaker 8:  other kind of this thicket of what we call ip, but which is like the

624
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:48,885
Speaker 8:  right to control the conduct of your customer's critics and and competitors.

625
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:53,005
Speaker 8:  And so You know if we re legalize that conduct, then

626
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:56,565
Speaker 8:  those new market entrants who Facebook locks out of their API

627
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:01,005
Speaker 8:  could fall back to scraping bots, reverse engineering and other tools.

628
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:04,685
Speaker 8:  Now that's gorilla warfare with Facebook in general. I think

629
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:08,765
Speaker 8:  Facebook will lose that over the long run because for Facebook to

630
00:38:09,115 --> 00:38:12,805
Speaker 8:  just successfully defend this, they need to make zero mistakes

631
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:16,085
Speaker 8:  and to successfully attack their defenses, you need to find one mistake.

632
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:20,045
Speaker 8:  And so that will privilege them. But I also think Facebook

633
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:23,725
Speaker 8:  would all other things being equal prefer a managed

634
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:27,885
Speaker 8:  solution where the API is reliable to a situation where they cannot

635
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:31,685
Speaker 8:  use the law to stop these adversarial inter operators because

636
00:38:31,715 --> 00:38:35,525
Speaker 8:  Gorilla warfare represents an unquantifiable risk to Facebook

637
00:38:35,865 --> 00:38:39,765
Speaker 8:  and shareholders do not like surprises. And we saw Facebook

638
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:43,125
Speaker 8:  lose a quarter of a trillion dollars after their first

639
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:47,725
Speaker 8:  report of 2022 to their shareholders when they revealed that

640
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:51,925
Speaker 8:  they, it wasn't even contraction, it was less growth than they'd anticipated

641
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:55,645
Speaker 8:  among US users. And the people who bore the brunt of that

642
00:38:56,175 --> 00:39:00,005
Speaker 8:  stock crash were the managers who made the decisions

643
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,245
Speaker 8:  that led to the reduction in users, right? Because they're the ones whose

644
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:07,285
Speaker 8:  portfolios are primarily stuffed with Facebook stock, right? More than anyone

645
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:10,485
Speaker 8:  else. They're the least diverse shareholders, right? And so

646
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:14,885
Speaker 8:  if we say to Facebook to the decision makers at Facebook,

647
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:19,285
Speaker 8:  if you break your API you will have to contend with Gorilla warfare and

648
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:23,245
Speaker 8:  that Gorilla Warfare will produce the surprises that will make you personally

649
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:27,165
Speaker 8:  significantly poorer. Then I think we align their incentives. But of

650
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,485
Speaker 8:  course no one ever lost money by betting on the hubris of

651
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:35,085
Speaker 8:  tech executives. Yeah. So if they do go ahead and do this, then we

652
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:38,765
Speaker 8:  have a fallback. That's what I mean by like an administrative remedy,

653
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:42,565
Speaker 8:  right? A an actual plan that looks at what Facebook is doing that

654
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:45,805
Speaker 8:  harms people, what stops people from getting out of harm's way, what will

655
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:49,885
Speaker 8:  moderate those harms? And what we'll do when Facebook takes a

656
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:53,845
Speaker 8:  countermeasure to recover its super normal profits

657
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:56,605
Speaker 8:  at the expense of everyday users. And how we will counter that

658
00:39:57,425 --> 00:40:00,365
Speaker 3:  One, like much lower stakes thing you're making me think about is like I'm,

659
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:04,125
Speaker 3:  I'm an obsessive user of note taking apps and I switch between them constantly.

660
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:06,245
Speaker 8:  Are you an Evernote casualty? Oh

661
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:09,165
Speaker 3:  Yes. And this is kind of, this is actually where I was going is one of the

662
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:12,605
Speaker 3:  first things you do if you build a note taking app is you build an Evernote

663
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:15,605
Speaker 3:  importer because there are a lot of people who have hated Evernote because

664
00:40:15,605 --> 00:40:19,125
Speaker 3:  it's been very bad for 10 years who are stuck there because they have thousands

665
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,365
Speaker 3:  of notes and they wanna leave. And Evernote makes you, makes you export in

666
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:26,005
Speaker 3:  this like EN ex file that is proprietary,

667
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:30,325
Speaker 3:  but also everyone else has figured out how to manage it. And So

668
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:34,405
Speaker 3:  I can now with two clicks pull all of my Evernote notes into some other app

669
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:37,725
Speaker 3:  which has made it possible to leave Evernote for tons and tons of people

670
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:40,725
Speaker 3:  who otherwise would not have been allowed out. And what it is in social is

671
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:44,645
Speaker 3:  like I'm stuck in Evernote for the rest of my life because it is so

672
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:48,005
Speaker 3:  hard to switch that I will put up with whatever nonsense there is

673
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:51,805
Speaker 3:  just to be here. And like the note taking is such a smaller version of it

674
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,525
Speaker 3:  but is like that's how it should work.

675
00:40:53,905 --> 00:40:57,685
Speaker 8:  That's a great example because one of the reasons that that's true is that

676
00:40:57,685 --> 00:41:01,525
Speaker 8:  Evernote started late or started early if Evernote started later when

677
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:05,285
Speaker 8:  they were, when there were better developed, more reliable and

678
00:41:05,315 --> 00:41:09,285
Speaker 8:  more widely understood strategies for blocking that reverse engineering

679
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:13,245
Speaker 8:  You know if they, if they were encrypting those databases, then bypassing

680
00:41:13,245 --> 00:41:17,205
Speaker 8:  the encryption would be unlawful. If you could only access

681
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:20,565
Speaker 8:  those databases through an app that blocked scraping and

682
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:24,445
Speaker 8:  autopiloting, then they could use terms of service violations to stop you

683
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:27,485
Speaker 8:  from running something locally that just iterated through every note you

684
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,125
Speaker 8:  had and then spit it out. Right? So like it shows you that while

685
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,800
Speaker 8:  mandates are important, right? We, we, we we could, if Evernote were large

686
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,485
Speaker 8:  enough and, and enough of a hazard, you could imagine a future in which Evernote

687
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:42,365
Speaker 8:  was legally required to offer you an export tool, but

688
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,525
Speaker 8:  you don't actually need it. Some of the time, some of the time rival firms

689
00:41:47,025 --> 00:41:50,525
Speaker 8:  can just work this out. And that's what Apple did with, with

690
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,045
Speaker 8:  Microsoft Office. You know, they, they, I was, I tell the story in the book,

691
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:57,725
Speaker 8:  I was a, a freelance CIO running You know the

692
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:01,685
Speaker 8:  networks for all these small and medium companies and a typical company would

693
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,045
Speaker 8:  have a 20 people with Windows PCs and a designer with a Mac.

694
00:42:05,545 --> 00:42:09,525
Speaker 8:  And if you tried to send that designer a Word file, an Excel file or an office

695
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:13,525
Speaker 8:  file and they tried to open it to my Mac office, it would either not work

696
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:17,125
Speaker 8:  or then after they made changes and saved it, it would be corrupt or You

697
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:20,805
Speaker 8:  know some variation. All you had to do is like wave the Mac office floppy

698
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:24,605
Speaker 8:  around and files would spontaneously corrupt. And I just started, like first

699
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:28,245
Speaker 8:  I put PCs on those designer's desks that they used as dedicated office works

700
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,925
Speaker 8:  stations. And then when that became unwieldy, I put big graphics cards in

701
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:35,805
Speaker 8:  their PCs and got them Quirk and Adobe for, for their PC

702
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:39,765
Speaker 8:  and threw away their Mac and Apple figured out this was happening. And so

703
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:43,885
Speaker 8:  they just got engineers to reverse engineer office. And so we

704
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:47,565
Speaker 8:  get iWork suite pages numbers in Keynote that reads and writes the

705
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,205
Speaker 8:  Microsoft office files. And then the really interesting thing is what Microsoft

706
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:55,205
Speaker 8:  did because after a few rounds of aggressively

707
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:58,445
Speaker 8:  changing those file formats and incurring their own engineering expenses,

708
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:02,325
Speaker 8:  because then they have to update all their own Windows software, they sued

709
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:06,245
Speaker 8:  for peace and they standardized the office file formats, which

710
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:09,885
Speaker 8:  is why we have the X at the end of the XLSX and PPTX and Doc X,

711
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:13,765
Speaker 8:  which stands for XML. And this is why you can now past

712
00:43:13,775 --> 00:43:17,165
Speaker 8:  style text between Word Google Docs,

713
00:43:17,585 --> 00:43:21,525
Speaker 8:  web forms, You know Medium has a parser for it, right? Like if

714
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:25,285
Speaker 8:  you're composing on medium, I bet your CMS does, I know The

715
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:28,885
Speaker 8:  Verge has got its own CMS that you guys built from scratch, but you probably

716
00:43:28,885 --> 00:43:32,445
Speaker 8:  just imported a, like a reference library for parsing out those things. So

717
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:36,405
Speaker 8:  you can compose in Word or docs and it just works. Yep. And so like at

718
00:43:36,445 --> 00:43:39,645
Speaker 8:  a certain point when you have to use engineers to block

719
00:43:39,645 --> 00:43:43,525
Speaker 8:  interoperability instead of lawyers, then you just give

720
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:47,485
Speaker 8:  up because lawyers solve the problem forever, right? Lawyers teach every

721
00:43:47,715 --> 00:43:51,205
Speaker 8:  financier, every entrepreneur and every user don't trust

722
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:55,005
Speaker 8:  interoperable solutions engineers. They have to fight and

723
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:58,365
Speaker 8:  fight and fight and eventually they lose in these wars of attrition.

724
00:43:58,945 --> 00:44:02,765
Speaker 8:  And so once you take away the lawyers, the company's sue for

725
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,005
Speaker 8:  peace,

726
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:07,645
Speaker 3:  At least as far as I can tell, like Mastodon and sort of what the

727
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,605
Speaker 3:  whole activity Pub world represents is like the closest ex

728
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:15,365
Speaker 3:  extent thing to the kind of interoperability that you're talking

729
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:15,645
Speaker 3:  about.

730
00:44:15,915 --> 00:44:19,605
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And Activity Pub came out of the W three C at the same time as

731
00:44:19,845 --> 00:44:23,645
Speaker 8:  all this bad standardization was happening. And it, the reason

732
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:27,525
Speaker 8:  that this good standard emerged without being interfered with

733
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:31,525
Speaker 8:  I think is that the big tech companies didn't believe it would

734
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:34,365
Speaker 8:  matter enough to sabotage it. It wasn't like they couldn't, it's just that

735
00:44:34,365 --> 00:44:37,885
Speaker 8:  they chose not to and they could have submarined all kinds of

736
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:41,805
Speaker 8:  proprietary advantages and so on into it and they just didn't. And as a

737
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:45,365
Speaker 8:  result, we got this thing that just kind of snuck in under the radar. 'cause

738
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:49,245
Speaker 8:  no one thought it was important. It's a bit like what happened with the web

739
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:53,485
Speaker 8:  itself, right? Where like nobody took the web seriously enough when the web

740
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:57,405
Speaker 8:  came along. The fight was between AOL and CompuServe and

741
00:44:57,405 --> 00:45:01,245
Speaker 8:  just like nobody took it seriously enough. So Tim Burners Lee was able

742
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:04,805
Speaker 8:  to make a thing that Microsoft didn't extinguish the way they were going

743
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:08,645
Speaker 8:  after Rival online services. And then by the time the web took off

744
00:45:08,645 --> 00:45:12,245
Speaker 8:  enough, they tried afterwards, right? It became a success. And

745
00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:15,405
Speaker 8:  Microsoft tried all these variations that You know, if you remember, there

746
00:45:15,405 --> 00:45:18,765
Speaker 8:  was a time when MSN meant something new every six months. Yeah. 'cause they

747
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:22,645
Speaker 8:  would relaunch MSN as some proprietary thing that was like

748
00:45:22,645 --> 00:45:26,365
Speaker 8:  the web, but not the web. It was Blackbird at one time. All this stuff. They

749
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:29,845
Speaker 8:  were just trying to lure people into locking into a proprietary technology

750
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:33,765
Speaker 8:  stack to extinguish the web. And like it just snuck in under

751
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,925
Speaker 8:  the radar. Nobody was paying attention to it. And then all of a sudden it

752
00:45:36,925 --> 00:45:40,325
Speaker 8:  was there and it was like too big to kill. And

753
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:44,085
Speaker 8:  You know, I think that activity pub kind of fits that, that window, it just

754
00:45:44,365 --> 00:45:45,805
Speaker 8:  snuck in when no one was looking.

755
00:45:46,315 --> 00:45:50,165
Speaker 3:  What do you make of the fact that like Adam er is constantly

756
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:53,885
Speaker 3:  saying that Threads, which is not currently federated, very much a closed

757
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:57,685
Speaker 3:  platform is going to be part of, like, is that a, is that a company c change

758
00:45:57,685 --> 00:46:00,205
Speaker 3:  or is that just a guy saying the right thing at the right moment?

759
00:46:00,915 --> 00:46:04,725
Speaker 8:  Well, I, I think that even people of Goodwill can

760
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:09,045
Speaker 8:  talk themselves into doing bad things. Like let's

761
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:12,885
Speaker 8:  stipulate that Messer is completely sincere, right? But in

762
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:16,605
Speaker 8:  two years there's 400 million daily

763
00:46:16,655 --> 00:46:20,525
Speaker 8:  users of threads and they just rationalize

764
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:24,725
Speaker 8:  that, opening those users up to federation would expose them

765
00:46:24,725 --> 00:46:28,645
Speaker 8:  to risks that Facebook is currently able to defend them from, that

766
00:46:28,645 --> 00:46:32,445
Speaker 8:  they have the You know moderation tools and the other things

767
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:35,805
Speaker 8:  that are needed to prevent disinformation harassment and so on. And that

768
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:39,525
Speaker 8:  federating will expose new risks to those users. And it's just

769
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:40,605
Speaker 8:  unfair to those users,

770
00:46:40,975 --> 00:46:43,725
Speaker 3:  Which to some extent is not untrue. Sure.

771
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:47,205
Speaker 8:  Particularly if you have a bunch of users who become accustomed to

772
00:46:47,595 --> 00:46:51,205
Speaker 8:  certain practices that don't take account of the

773
00:46:51,495 --> 00:46:54,805
Speaker 8:  risks, but also the benefits of federation. And so you just drop them into

774
00:46:54,805 --> 00:46:58,565
Speaker 8:  the deep end. And so the way that you protect your future

775
00:46:58,675 --> 00:47:02,245
Speaker 8:  weak self is for your present day strong self to do something

776
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:06,205
Speaker 8:  that is irrevocable in that service. So like we call these

777
00:47:06,315 --> 00:47:10,125
Speaker 8:  Ulysses pacs, right? Ulysses in the, in the tail, he's a hacker.

778
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:13,445
Speaker 8:  He doesn't wanna fill his ears with wax when they sail through the sea of

779
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:17,005
Speaker 8:  the sirens to prevent their calls from luring him to his death in the sea.

780
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:20,285
Speaker 8:  He wants to hear them. So in this moment of strength, before he is hearing

781
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:23,805
Speaker 8:  the sirens call, he has the sailors lash him to the mast and says, whatever

782
00:47:23,845 --> 00:47:27,765
Speaker 8:  I do don't untie me so that I can live through this. I can experience the

783
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,885
Speaker 8:  benefits of my strength even in a moment of weakness. And we've all done

784
00:47:30,885 --> 00:47:33,645
Speaker 8:  versions of this, right? You throw away the Oreos the night you go on a diet,

785
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:37,605
Speaker 8:  right? That's a form of Ulysses Pact. Open source licenses are a form of

786
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:41,045
Speaker 8:  Ulysses Pact. 'cause they're all irrevocable, right? Every time an IP lawyer

787
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:44,565
Speaker 8:  who hasn't, who isn't familiar with open source first encounters

788
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:48,885
Speaker 8:  on open or a free license like the GPL or even the BSD license or whatever,

789
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:52,365
Speaker 8:  they go like, oh, this is, this is dumb. They everyone must have missed this.

790
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:56,045
Speaker 8:  This should have a way for you to revoke the license later. And if you change

791
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:59,605
Speaker 8:  your mind, and that is not a bug, it's a feature.

792
00:47:59,955 --> 00:48:03,805
Speaker 8:  Because when your investors come to you and say, well

793
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:07,765
Speaker 8:  this was cute, but if you want the 150 people you convinced to quit

794
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:11,365
Speaker 8:  their jobs and put their kids' college funds on the line to come work for

795
00:48:11,365 --> 00:48:15,045
Speaker 8:  you to have a job next week, you're gonna make this open source proprietary

796
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:19,045
Speaker 8:  next week. And you can just say like, you're the boss, but I can't,

797
00:48:19,195 --> 00:48:23,165
Speaker 8:  like, I just can't. And so you're for Facebook to say, well

798
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:27,085
Speaker 8:  someday this will be open. Trust us given the company's track

799
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:30,885
Speaker 8:  record as bananas, right? 'cause Facebook in 2006,

800
00:48:30,895 --> 00:48:34,845
Speaker 8:  their pitch to MySpace users was like, you love

801
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:38,805
Speaker 8:  your friends, but did You know that the evil, crappy and Australian billionaire

802
00:48:38,805 --> 00:48:42,085
Speaker 8:  who owns MySpace, Rupert Murdoch spies on you with every hour that God sends

803
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:45,925
Speaker 8:  Facebook is the service that will never spy on you. That was their pitch

804
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:49,445
Speaker 8:  in 2006, right? We are the surveillance free social media

805
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:53,485
Speaker 8:  platform and we always will be. And in 2008, they pulled their users

806
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:56,925
Speaker 8:  and said, we're gonna start spying on you. Is this okay with you? And they

807
00:48:56,925 --> 00:49:00,485
Speaker 8:  said no, and they did it anyway. Right? So like, as

808
00:49:00,485 --> 00:49:04,125
Speaker 8:  George Bush taught us, right? Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice. We

809
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:07,605
Speaker 8:  don't get fooled again. Right? And, and You know what would be a more

810
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:11,205
Speaker 8:  compelling thing than promising to federate federating.

811
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:15,205
Speaker 8:  Right? And if they're not federated, then all it is is a

812
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:19,165
Speaker 8:  latent capability. And like computers are touring complete universal Von

813
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:22,405
Speaker 8:  Neumann machines. So every capability is latent in every

814
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:26,205
Speaker 8:  service, right? Like, unless there's some means by which

815
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:30,245
Speaker 8:  users can discipline executives who take bad choices,

816
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:34,965
Speaker 8:  then we should expect those executives to fall prey to the same folly

817
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,925
Speaker 8:  and rationalization that all of us are capable of.

818
00:49:38,235 --> 00:49:41,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I think it, it sounds like you're of the mind of there are sort

819
00:49:41,485 --> 00:49:45,325
Speaker 3:  of two approaches. One is to essentially mandate that threads federates

820
00:49:45,325 --> 00:49:49,205
Speaker 3:  like put into law that if you, you have to have activity pub. The other one

821
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:53,205
Speaker 3:  is blow open enough holes or make it legal for people to

822
00:49:53,205 --> 00:49:57,165
Speaker 3:  blow open holes in such a way that someone else will do

823
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,605
Speaker 3:  it for them. And there's nothing that threads can do about it.

824
00:49:59,885 --> 00:50:03,325
Speaker 8:  I think this is more like two part epoxy, right? Adversarial interoperability,

825
00:50:03,345 --> 00:50:07,325
Speaker 8:  the right to reverse engineer and stuff. The the at EFF we call this

826
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:10,885
Speaker 8:  ComCom competitive compatibility. 'cause adversarial interoperability is

827
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:11,565
Speaker 8:  so hard to say.

828
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:12,685
Speaker 3:  ComCom is very good. Yeah,

829
00:50:12,745 --> 00:50:16,365
Speaker 8:  ComCom is great. So ComCom is great but it is unstable,

830
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:20,205
Speaker 8:  right? Because you are finding a blind spot in the intrusion

831
00:50:20,205 --> 00:50:23,845
Speaker 8:  detection system or the anti automation stuff and you're exploiting it and

832
00:50:23,845 --> 00:50:24,645
Speaker 8:  you're making it work.

833
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:28,285
Speaker 3:  You're playing a cat and mouse game with thousands of engineers designed

834
00:50:28,285 --> 00:50:29,125
Speaker 3:  to stop you.

835
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:32,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean they have to make no mistakes. You have to find one mistake.

836
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:36,405
Speaker 8:  You can stockpile 20 vulnerabilities and roll them out one after another

837
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:39,765
Speaker 8:  as they plug one and then the other. There are lots of ways that this will

838
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:43,605
Speaker 8:  be advantageous, but it is unstable. You know in the days when mints

839
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:47,365
Speaker 8:  started, You know they were scraping like 6,000 different bank websites

840
00:50:47,905 --> 00:50:51,485
Speaker 8:  and if the bank took active countermeasures to block them that they couldn't

841
00:50:51,685 --> 00:50:55,005
Speaker 8:  overcome, what they would do is if you were a mint user, they would just

842
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:58,805
Speaker 8:  pop up a message that says like, sorry Bank of America customer, we are no

843
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,765
Speaker 8:  longer capable of scraping this account. Here is the phone number of the

844
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:05,685
Speaker 8:  lawyer who sent us the c and d for Bank of America. Call them up

845
00:51:05,685 --> 00:51:08,325
Speaker 8:  and tell them you're a Bank of America customer who wants to access your

846
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:11,725
Speaker 8:  own financial data, right? So there are lots of ways around this and

847
00:51:11,765 --> 00:51:15,605
Speaker 8:  mandates. On the other hand, You know formal, formal requirements. As we

848
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:19,125
Speaker 8:  said, they're hard to enforce or administer, but they are very strong, right?

849
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:22,965
Speaker 8:  If firms actually huge to a standard, the standard works You know you

850
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:26,885
Speaker 8:  never buy AUSB cigarette lighter adapter

851
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:30,405
Speaker 8:  at a, in a fishbowl at a gas station only to find that it doesn't work in

852
00:51:30,405 --> 00:51:34,285
Speaker 8:  your cigarette lighter receptacle in your car. It just standards really work

853
00:51:34,385 --> 00:51:38,325
Speaker 8:  but they're brittle. So you have something that is very flexible but

854
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:42,405
Speaker 8:  but also doesn't hold very well. And then you have something that

855
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:46,205
Speaker 8:  is very strong but is easy to break and you combine the

856
00:51:46,225 --> 00:51:49,365
Speaker 8:  two and you get two part epoxy. Something that is

857
00:51:49,925 --> 00:51:53,845
Speaker 8:  resilient but strong. And that's, that's why I think we need to combine

858
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:56,405
Speaker 8:  both of these approaches and that's why we need to understand that what tech

859
00:51:56,405 --> 00:52:00,165
Speaker 8:  has done through its regulatory capture is on the one hand get broad

860
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:04,045
Speaker 8:  latitude to abuse us and on the other hand create broad prohibitions on

861
00:52:04,045 --> 00:52:08,005
Speaker 8:  self-help. And we need to reverse that circumstance so that we have broad

862
00:52:08,245 --> 00:52:11,725
Speaker 8:  prohibitions on abusive conduct by tech firms, whether they're large or small.

863
00:52:11,985 --> 00:52:15,605
Speaker 8:  And we have broad latitude as users to take measures to help ourselves.

864
00:52:16,895 --> 00:52:20,805
Speaker 3:  After all this time and effort and Amazon purchases and docker

865
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:24,925
Speaker 3:  downloads, I've now built a couple of things that stick. I have a Plex server

866
00:52:25,015 --> 00:52:29,005
Speaker 3:  which rules and I now use it all the time. I also now have all my notes in

867
00:52:29,005 --> 00:52:32,565
Speaker 3:  a collection of text files and I'll never use another note taking app that

868
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:36,005
Speaker 3:  doesn't read and write to that folder of text files stored on my computer.

869
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:39,565
Speaker 3:  The two apps I'm switching between right now, if you're curious are note

870
00:52:39,565 --> 00:52:42,885
Speaker 3:  plan and obsidian. Obsidian like we were talking about is super powerful.

871
00:52:43,145 --> 00:52:46,485
Speaker 3:  But note plan's just really pretty So I just keep coming back to it. I also

872
00:52:46,485 --> 00:52:50,125
Speaker 3:  still have image running, but Docker takes up too much memory on my computer

873
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,965
Speaker 3:  most of the time. So I mostly don't use it. I did rig up a way to use

874
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:57,845
Speaker 3:  my B Link mini PC as a universal file backup for all my stuff,

875
00:52:58,105 --> 00:53:01,125
Speaker 3:  but I also still have everything in Google Drive too because cloud services

876
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:04,245
Speaker 3:  are great. It's much easier to get at my stuff in Google Drive. I just like

877
00:53:04,245 --> 00:53:07,565
Speaker 3:  having options and I like that my stuff works now even when

878
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:11,285
Speaker 3:  AWS or Google Cloud doesn't or when I'm on the train and don't have any wifi

879
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:15,125
Speaker 3:  at all. I'm not really doing all this for big moral reasons

880
00:53:15,345 --> 00:53:18,605
Speaker 3:  or because I'm afraid the cloud is going to get sentient and rule us all

881
00:53:18,705 --> 00:53:22,365
Speaker 3:  or because I think we should destroy the tech giants. I just like my stuff

882
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:25,260
Speaker 3:  being my stuff and I don't think that's too much to to ask.

883
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:30,565
Speaker 3:  Alright, that's it for The Vergecast today. Thanks so much to everyone who
