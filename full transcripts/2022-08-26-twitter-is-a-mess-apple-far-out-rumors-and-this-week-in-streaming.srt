18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,510
Speaker 4:  Hello, and welcome to the broadcast. The flagship podcast of

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,560
Speaker 4:  audience measurement, where we get into Dows M Dows. Our

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,430
Speaker 4:  Dow is F Dows F Dallas, I think is a real theme of this week. Hi, I'm your

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,270
Speaker 4:  friend Nila. The host of the ship. David Pierce is here. Hi,

22
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,120
Speaker 5:  I count as precisely one user. That's the only thing

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,580
Speaker 4:  I know. No one's ever monetized you in your life. David,

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,790
Speaker 4:  Alex Kranz is here.

25
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,060
Speaker 6:  I'm just feeling bad for David never being monetized.

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,570
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What is a daily user? If you're not a monetized double dailies, or

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,530
Speaker 4:  do you even have that?

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,820
Speaker 6:  We don't want you

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,450
Speaker 4:  A lot going on this week. There's an apple event that is officially announced.

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,810
Speaker 4:  Now on the seventh, we got to talk about that. Speaking of

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,650
Speaker 4:  endows Ilan versus Twitter and reached new Heights of absurdity this

32
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,130
Speaker 4:  week, it was such a gadget news. Chris Welch has a big scoop on any Sono

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,790
Speaker 4:  speaker. We should talk about Eve prices are everywhere. The Peloton CEO

34
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,210
Speaker 4:  is doing metaphors about ships. All in all is shaping up to be a perfect

35
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,870
Speaker 4:  for a chest. You know, when the CEOs are doing ship metaphors,

36
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,650
Speaker 4:  you're in for a ride. Let's start though with apple, other streaming

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,460
Speaker 4:  news, Alex put a bunch of streaming news in here. I mean, this is

38
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,330
Speaker 4:  just a chef's kiss of a rundown. I love it. Let's start with

39
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,170
Speaker 4:  apple though. The event is called far out. We are assuming

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,950
Speaker 4:  based on long historical record, this is the iPhone 14 event.

41
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,270
Speaker 4:  There is a lot of rumors, speculation that feels very solid. That we'll see

42
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,760
Speaker 4:  a watch in the mix. What are we thinking here? Maybe two

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,540
Speaker 5:  Or three,

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,220
Speaker 4:  Even three. What would be the three?

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,850
Speaker 5:  Oh, and I guess it's just too. There's the new watch. And then the, the gigantic

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,840
Speaker 5:  new watch

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,240
Speaker 6:  It's different sizes. That's why you're thinking three, the

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,980
Speaker 5:  Apple watch pro max.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,210
Speaker 4:  Well, wait, so that there's an update to the watches that we know in love,

50
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,020
Speaker 6:  Right? So that's two watches cause it's two different sizes.

51
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,980
Speaker 4:  Okay. Yes, I

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,800
Speaker 5:  Was right. Three watches. It's is it one watch or is it three watches?

53
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,890
Speaker 4:  No. Okay. So wait, wait, wait, let me, let me just, this is my, my theory

54
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,280
Speaker 4:  of the case here. The iPhone, every size of the iPhone is a different iPhone

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,820
Speaker 4:  model. Yeah. Right? I mean, that's how they've done it. The iPhone mini and

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,810
Speaker 4:  the iPhone 10 R and the iPhone promo, and they're all different and

57
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,360
Speaker 4:  they're primarily distinguished on screen size. So the different models,

58
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,470
Speaker 4:  the watch is a, that there is the apple watch for,

59
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,340
Speaker 4:  and then the apple watch se or whatever. And they each come in two sizes,

60
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,940
Speaker 4:  which is actually a very interesting split and Apple's lineup. It's more

61
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,840
Speaker 4:  like the Mac book than the iPad or whatever. So I think it's two

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,810
Speaker 4:  watches, right? We're expecting a regular update to the apple watch.

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
Speaker 4:  And then this like sports, or

64
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,100
Speaker 6:  Like the Garmin competitor, you can shoot it with a gun. Don't

65
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,210
Speaker 6:  shoot it with a gun, please.

66
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,690
Speaker 4:  Some YouTuber right now is taking notes. Being like, I got an idea for a

67
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,020
Speaker 4:  video,

68
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,770
Speaker 6:  Caulking the firearm, getting ready to go

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
Speaker 4:  Yelling at their brews, like get in the garage, find the guns. We've got

70
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,300
Speaker 4:  to get ready for this apple watch to come out,

71
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,320
Speaker 6:  Find me bullets. But yeah. So, so yeah, there's going to be this other one

72
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,160
Speaker 6:  then it's meant to go after the Garmin folks, it's meant to be for like

73
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,520
Speaker 6:  rugged outdoor enthusiasts who all love their

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,480
Speaker 6:  garments, passionately wear these ugly devices. And hopefully

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,080
Speaker 6:  the apple device will be a little bit, I'm sorry to every garment user, but

76
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,940
Speaker 6:  you know, your devices are

77
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,370
Speaker 4:  Ugly in a way that now is become a brand

78
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,830
Speaker 6:  Like the, well, even the apple watch, the apple watch, we all kind of thought

79
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,310
Speaker 6:  was maybe ugly. And then we're like, no, the apple watch is cool. So it's,

80
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,480
Speaker 6:  it's very much like that.

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,070
Speaker 5:  Did we get, I'm not sure we got to that point. I think it's just like,

82
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,850
Speaker 5:  we just decided it's fine. It's just there. It's just like a,

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,840
Speaker 5:  it's like you have a large glass rectangle on your wrist. Like, I don't know

84
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,570
Speaker 5:  that anyone is going to look at it and be like, that is a beautiful object,

85
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,870
Speaker 5:  but like, it's fine. It's good enough. And I feel like Garmin, it took a

86
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,530
Speaker 5:  while to get there, but it now, like it has this connotation of like, yeah,

87
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,620
Speaker 5:  I wear an ugly watch, but like I'm faster than you. You don't want to fight

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,010
Speaker 4:  Every time I see a Garmin person I'm like that person can climb a mountain.

89
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,090
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Which may or may not be true. I haven't done any research to

90
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,150
Speaker 4:  validate. I don't just walk up to people. And like, I've noticed your watch.

91
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,140
Speaker 4:  What's your top speed.

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,510
Speaker 6:  I think every garment owner wants you to assign a climate mountain,

93
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,400
Speaker 6:  regardless of if they have

94
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,390
Speaker 4:  Again, this is like why you buy vehicles for off-roading that don't forgot

95
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,990
Speaker 4:  for it. Like, okay, fine. So we are expecting a big

96
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,530
Speaker 4:  sports watch. Here's my question about that, because I think that is

97
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,320
Speaker 4:  fundamentally more interesting than the iPhone at this point, because it

98
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,250
Speaker 4:  represents an entry into a new category for apple, which is

99
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,910
Speaker 4:  traditionally when apple has the most new ideas. And then over time, they

100
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,810
Speaker 4:  have to whittle those down to reality. I submit to you the

101
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,590
Speaker 4:  apple watch itself, which as you will remember, was announced with

102
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,580
Speaker 4:  enormous fanfare about the digital crown, which Tim cook

103
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,360
Speaker 4:  likened to the mouse. And multitouch in

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,320
Speaker 4:  terms of input devices that would revolutionize the world. It's a wheel.

105
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,850
Speaker 4:  It's a, it's an, I never used it

106
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,200
Speaker 6:  Revolutionized

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,630
Speaker 4:  Well. I mean, literally I feel revolutionized when I turn the dial,

108
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,850
Speaker 4:  I mean, who hasn't turned the digital crown and thought to myself, this will

109
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,550
Speaker 4:  revolutionize computing on the order of the mouse.

110
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,440
Speaker 4:  Anyhow, the big watch is like a new product category for them. It can't

111
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,710
Speaker 4:  just be more apple watch. Right? They've got to do some new

112
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,220
Speaker 4:  sensors. They've got to do some new activity

113
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,030
Speaker 4:  proofing. They've got to add new sports to it.

114
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,670
Speaker 4:  They've got to make the battery lasts a lot longer. That's the main thing

115
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,610
Speaker 4:  I hear from garment. The garment owners I know in my life say two things

116
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,300
Speaker 4:  about the apple watch one. It just looks too delicate. Even if it's not too

117
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,090
Speaker 4:  delicate for the things they do, right. It's like waterproof. It's dustproof

118
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,210
Speaker 4:  whatever they think it's too delicate. And they've got their garments, which

119
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,020
Speaker 4:  look like tanks. And then to the battery life isn't good enough for camping

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,990
Speaker 4:  or whatever it is you want to do with your garment. So those feel like the

121
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,320
Speaker 4:  two things apple has to solve from a hardware design standpoint and on the

122
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,010
Speaker 4:  software side, you've got to make it easier to use while you're running.

123
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,090
Speaker 4:  Like all the things like Garmin's interface is like dead

124
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,860
Speaker 4:  simple compared to an apple watch.

125
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,940
Speaker 6:  I mean, I don't know if they're going to do that. It's got a two inch display,

126
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,550
Speaker 6:  like that's the rumor, right? That it's going to have a two inch display.

127
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,210
Speaker 6:  It's going to be huge. I wonder if Blaby, they're not competing with garment

128
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,080
Speaker 6:  as much as offering a really sturdy counterpoint to garment, like rather

129
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,750
Speaker 6:  than saying, we're going to do everything Garmin does, but better. Maybe

130
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,240
Speaker 6:  they're going to be like, we're going to do everything you want your garment

131
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,850
Speaker 6:  to do, but totally differently. Isn't that cooler.

132
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,750
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I kind of think the move here is to make the apple watch, do more

133
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,410
Speaker 5:  stuff. And they're going to like put a big screen on it, which is going to

134
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,400
Speaker 5:  help with battery life just because there's just more place to put batteries.

135
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,980
Speaker 5:  So I think to some extent, like that problem will solve itself with better

136
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,640
Speaker 5:  chips and more space. But then on this big screen, like if I'm apple, I'm

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,360
Speaker 5:  going way further down the road of like, how do we make this a totally

138
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,690
Speaker 5:  self-sufficient device with this interesting. You don't need your phone.

139
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,840
Speaker 5:  You don't need anything else. Just like take this thing and climb a mountain.

140
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,810
Speaker 5:  I don't know if that's where they're going, but that's what I would be doing

141
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,110
Speaker 5:  with this. It's like, how do you appeal to like the ultra power users and

142
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,860
Speaker 5:  the ultra fitness people is like, give them this giant thing that

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,320
Speaker 5:  does not need another device to be useful. That's what I mean.

144
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,190
Speaker 4:  Let me unearth some David Pierce history from your

145
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,500
Speaker 4:  interregnum between stints at the verge.

146
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,180
Speaker 5:  That dark days we call this

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,330
Speaker 4:  David for a long time was one of the most notable

148
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,170
Speaker 4:  traders@theverge.com. And he left us to go to a, a technology

149
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,980
Speaker 4:  oriented print magazine. This is a true story, is a great magazine.

150
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,240
Speaker 4:  We all know it. We all love it. And I refuse to name it like Voldemort.

151
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,950
Speaker 4:  And while he was there, he wrote a big feature on the apple watch. Yep.

152
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,090
Speaker 4:  Whose thesis was? This thing is going to replace

153
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,570
Speaker 4:  your phone.

154
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,310
Speaker 5:  That was not my thesis. That was, that was not my thesis. That

155
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,300
Speaker 5:  was Apple's thesis. That was not some grand theory of

156
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,990
Speaker 5:  the case. That was what apple told me over and over and over on the

157
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,710
Speaker 5:  record was that this device, the headline of that story was

158
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,460
Speaker 5:  iPhone killer and apple hated it. And I was like, do you know what the

159
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,310
Speaker 5:  problem is with this headline is it's the store. It's what you said

160
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,290
Speaker 5:  on the record. Like here are the quotes.

161
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,760
Speaker 4:  I would point out that I didn't even get to the middle of my version of the

162
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,330
Speaker 4:  story before David corrected me, but this,

163
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,260
Speaker 5:  Sorry. Keep going.

164
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,550
Speaker 4:  No, I think you might understand why I brought this up. I have

165
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,050
Speaker 5:  A feeling where you're going with this. Yeah.

166
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,460
Speaker 4:  Well, so apple pushed back against the story. After it came up the show read

167
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,560
Speaker 4:  it. It's a good story. David's excellent writer, even though he worked for

168
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,550
Speaker 4:  the enemy, but it has back love. And again, this story came out. It was great.

169
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,750
Speaker 4:  There was pushback from apple. This is not actually what we're doing. The

170
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,900
Speaker 4:  two things are together for obvious reasons, right? Apple saying, they're

171
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,930
Speaker 4:  going to cannibalize the phone when the phone is their biggest source of

172
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,770
Speaker 4:  revenue is not what they want apple thinking in its mind, oh, this thing

173
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,370
Speaker 4:  will grow to be independent of a phone. And then it's

174
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,390
Speaker 4:  total market will be as big as the phone market, as opposed to

175
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,840
Speaker 4:  just a percentage of people who have phones makes all the sense in the world.

176
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,290
Speaker 4:  That's right. But they haven't done that. The watch got a little bit more

177
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,190
Speaker 4:  independent in its app model. Like a little bit the app, something remote

178
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,400
Speaker 4:  controls of your phone apps, but that's kind of where it, they added obviously

179
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,880
Speaker 4:  cellular connectivity. That's kind of where it stopped. And it's been stopped

180
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,780
Speaker 4:  there for a couple of years. So David, your thesis is now big screen. Big

181
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,260
Speaker 4:  battery can go a couple of days. They obviously still have cell

182
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,120
Speaker 4:  connectivity. They're going to make the turn.

183
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,170
Speaker 5:  I mean, it seems like this is a moment you could do it. Right? Like

184
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,440
Speaker 5:  apple, I spent the last couple of years getting developers to move more of

185
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,350
Speaker 5:  their stuff onto the watch. So it's already more self-sufficient than it.

186
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,890
Speaker 5:  Once was like, for the longest time, you couldn't like

187
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,910
Speaker 5:  download Spotify things for when you were away from your

188
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,090
Speaker 5:  phone or on a run, which was just like absurd. Right. But a lot of those

189
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,840
Speaker 5:  problems have been solved.

190
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,560
Speaker 6:  It was like a Spotify thing too. Right? Like it was, it was one of their

191
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,190
Speaker 6:  deals, I think with Samsung where the, the agreement was,

192
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,850
Speaker 6:  you can't, you can only do downloads with us. You can't do it with any other

193
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,330
Speaker 6:  companies. Yeah.

194
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,180
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, and there were like a million versions of that rate. Whereas like,

195
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,510
Speaker 5:  for me it was podcasts. Like I listened to podcasts when I run and none of

196
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,050
Speaker 5:  my podcast apps would download podcasts onto my watch. And it's just like,

197
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,590
Speaker 5:  this is dumb. But anyway, so they've solved a bunch of those problems and

198
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,710
Speaker 5:  the processor is getting better. And I think like one thing that's really

199
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,700
Speaker 5:  happened is a lot of people now have wireless headphones, which

200
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,180
Speaker 5:  can in theory, correct. Connect directly to your watch and voice

201
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,660
Speaker 5:  dictation is now very good. And I think like the biggest thing you have to

202
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,750
Speaker 5:  solve, if you want this thing to be self-sufficient is communication. Right?

203
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,150
Speaker 5:  Like that is the thing. Most people do most of the time on their phones.

204
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,970
Speaker 5:  And so it's like, if you're ever going to start to push now, it feels like

205
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,210
Speaker 5:  there's more of a case to actually start to do some of that stuff. Then there

206
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:24,570
Speaker 5:  was,

207
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,040
Speaker 6:  But the problem is the wireless headphones. Aren't very

208
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,790
Speaker 6:  good. Like they're, they're, they're good enough. Right? They're good enough

209
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,180
Speaker 6:  to listen to when you're like going on a run or walking your dog or whatever.

210
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,140
Speaker 6:  I use my AirPods daily. Would they still have a lot of pain points

211
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,130
Speaker 6:  that you don't have with a phone? Right. Like earlier today I was trying

212
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,670
Speaker 6:  to do an airport huddle with our, how tos editor

213
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,840
Speaker 6:  Barbara go. Great. And then we both had on wireless headphones in both of

214
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,810
Speaker 6:  our wireless headphones, decided to stop like connecting to our devices

215
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,650
Speaker 6:  in the middle of the huddle. Like I was easy. I could

216
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,910
Speaker 6:  put them away and just say, Hey, I'm on speaker. Let me continue to make

217
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,780
Speaker 6:  this case a deal while we talk great. If I'm on my watch, I have to be

218
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,710
Speaker 6:  like, hold on, hold on. Like, do I go speaker on my watch that works in

219
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,130
Speaker 6:  the house. Doesn't work in like out in public. Like

220
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,220
Speaker 4:  No speaker works out in public.

221
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,370
Speaker 5:  Yes. Speakers bad everywhere.

222
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,300
Speaker 6:  Right. But you take your phone and you can put it to your ear and then

223
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,140
Speaker 6:  jam your other finger into your other ear and be like, what's that can't

224
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,040
Speaker 6:  do that with a watch.

225
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,120
Speaker 5:  No, that's totally true.

226
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,380
Speaker 4:  By the way, just, just to put this out there for people. If you ever get

227
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,390
Speaker 4:  a phone call, you don't want to take, I'm not saying this ever happens to

228
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,840
Speaker 4:  me. One thing you can say, regardless of circumstance that no one can check

229
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,420
Speaker 4:  is, Hey, I'm on my watch. Can I call you back?

230
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,910
Speaker 4:  And everyone immediately understands that they should hang up the phone.

231
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,580
Speaker 4:  It's pretty good. And then it's just a matter of how badly do you want to

232
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,570
Speaker 4:  burn that relationship,

233
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,740
Speaker 4:  but Hey, I'm on my watch. Can I call you back? Everyone's like, oh yeah,

234
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,350
Speaker 4:  no, please, please. Don't do that. I want to talk to me.

235
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,830
Speaker 6:  This is explaining a lot of our conversations Nila.

236
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,050
Speaker 4:  So I think my question is like, okay, so you add some downloads, right? You've

237
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,650
Speaker 4:  got a big battery. And the apple stated reason for not

238
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,320
Speaker 4:  allowing a lot of these things to happen is we're protecting the battery

239
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,280
Speaker 4:  life. Yes. There are other quieter reason is we want to self

240
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,150
Speaker 4:  preference, the music app instead of Spotify and Spotify tried to

241
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,360
Speaker 4:  turn a weakness into a strength by saying, you can, we've signed a deal to

242
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,600
Speaker 4:  let you download on Samsung. And it's like, you're just dancing,

243
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,170
Speaker 4:  whatever, but that's come to an end. Right? Like the Spotify app is more

244
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,100
Speaker 4:  full-featured you can do things on the watch now that make it feel like a

245
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,690
Speaker 4:  true app platform. Yeah.

246
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,070
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

247
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,560
Speaker 4:  See, now you got a bigger battery. It can be even true wrap platform. Do

248
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,460
Speaker 4:  you want, when you're going off grid to run up the mountain to have a

249
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,150
Speaker 4:  fully featured slack app on your watch, because that is like,

250
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,920
Speaker 4:  what did I replace this for?

251
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,190
Speaker 6:  I don't want to do that when I'm down on the ground.

252
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,420
Speaker 4:  Right. But what I'm saying is you can put your phone away, your

253
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,380
Speaker 4:  watches on your body. So it's like your solve this problem of getting

254
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,250
Speaker 4:  rid of your phone. And then you've created an entirely new class

255
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,540
Speaker 4:  of notification management problems that are literally strapped to

256
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:07,990
Speaker 4:  your body.

257
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,740
Speaker 6:  Terrible. Yes.

258
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,520
Speaker 5:  This is like the fundamental problem of the watch, which is the thing that

259
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,210
Speaker 5:  it was originally pitched as is like it frees you from your phone actually

260
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,810
Speaker 5:  sucks because what I can do is leave my phone somewhere else

261
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,560
Speaker 5:  and that's good. And if I don't want to get notifications, I just don't look

262
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,460
Speaker 5:  at my phone. A thing that buzzes my body is harder to

263
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,280
Speaker 5:  ignore in that sense. And this is like going to get even crazier when you

264
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,880
Speaker 5:  start getting into like AR glasses and all that stuff. But I think that is

265
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,180
Speaker 5:  like the fundamental unsolved problem of the watch is

266
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,290
Speaker 5:  basically how to like ratchet it up and down depending on what you want it

267
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,340
Speaker 5:  to do. And you just

268
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,380
Speaker 4:  Can't, that's what the digital crown is for

269
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,570
Speaker 6:  The focus modes. It's all about the focus

270
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,550
Speaker 4:  On my God. If they add focus modes to the crown,

271
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,050
Speaker 5:  Oh God, that's probably coming.

272
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,440
Speaker 6:  It's happening. Yeah.

273
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,780
Speaker 4:  You turn, turn the volume up on life and

274
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,200
Speaker 4:  any rural it back down,

275
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,370
Speaker 5:  I throw an idea. Both of you stage manager for the apple watch and you

276
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,590
Speaker 5:  scroll through the piles with the digital crap.

277
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,430
Speaker 4:  No, you know that I do the thing where, when I'm talking to someone, I want

278
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,490
Speaker 4:  to like indicate that I'm paying attention. I flip my phone over on the table.

279
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,030
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's like, this is how much I'm paying attention to you. It's still

280
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,580
Speaker 4:  here. It's not out of my sight.

281
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,930
Speaker 5:  Right. Cause that would be, but it's

282
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,920
Speaker 4:  Upside down and it's like, you pick up your watch. You just like roll

283
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,630
Speaker 6:  Making eye contact as you slowly roll the crowd.

284
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,040
Speaker 4:  All right. So those are the watches. We, we, I am very curious to see what

285
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,740
Speaker 4:  happens with this bigger sport watch. I think there's a big opportunity there

286
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,670
Speaker 4:  for apple to reinvent a bunch of it, right? Because it's a bigger display

287
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,180
Speaker 4:  is what you do, wacky or things in software. And then this new use

288
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,630
Speaker 4:  case of targeting Garmin means they have to

289
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,530
Speaker 4:  capture those users by trying to appeal to them. So I'm excited about that.

290
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,610
Speaker 4:  We should talk about the phones. It's it's funny that like, they're

291
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,310
Speaker 4:  gonna, what they're gonna fix. The camera's not fixed. Let me say again.

292
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,830
Speaker 4:  It's funny that I'm like, they're going to make the camera slightly better.

293
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,730
Speaker 4:  They're going to processor faster to no purpose

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
Speaker 6:  Blur, trying to read into the invitations and assume that we're going to

295
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,710
Speaker 6:  get astrophotography

296
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,400
Speaker 4:  And have the invitations that meant anything in the past like five years.

297
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,970
Speaker 6:  No, but what if it does this time? Like I think that's, I think that's the

298
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,850
Speaker 6:  fear it's not ever just like, no, we got to say it's doing something. Cause

299
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,080
Speaker 6:  we want to be able to be like a called it.

300
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,490
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I dunno.

301
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,850
Speaker 5:  We should do a retrospective on that. Actually go back through the last like

302
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,390
Speaker 5:  20 invitations and try to figure out if they actually turned into anything.

303
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,260
Speaker 5:  Cause if not, it is a truly masterful, ongoing

304
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,820
Speaker 5:  bit from apple. Yeah.

305
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,640
Speaker 6:  And we have to cut this whole part. This is too good. A story.

306
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,540
Speaker 4:  No, keep it. If you're out there and you want to write this, this incredibly

307
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,530
Speaker 4:  tedious story, send us any, we'll pay you to

308
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:42,890
Speaker 4:  do it.

309
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,120
Speaker 4:  No, it's a great story. I just, it's a lot of invitations to look at and

310
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,580
Speaker 4:  then be like, Hmm, did this blob

311
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,200
Speaker 4:  actually mean anything?

312
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,630
Speaker 4:  It's like, look at all the AR blobs. Once again,

313
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,620
Speaker 5:  It seemed like the phones, there are two things I would say that seemed potentially

314
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,850
Speaker 5:  interesting. I don't know. I think the, the

315
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,660
Speaker 5:  rumor is there's going to be either less notch or no notch and

316
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,620
Speaker 5:  potentially just a smaller, like whole punch for

317
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,160
Speaker 5:  all the sensors and cameras and stuff, which I don't know, people are excited

318
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,520
Speaker 5:  about. I literally, I have reached a point where I absolutely have no feelings

319
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,970
Speaker 5:  about notches and if, if they could make it bigger and I would say, okay,

320
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,100
Speaker 5:  and they could make it smaller. And I would say, okay. And then just move

321
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,280
Speaker 5:  on with my life. The one I think is potentially very interesting is the always

322
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,240
Speaker 5:  on display, which is another one where it's like, I've seen a lot of

323
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,930
Speaker 5:  people start to do interesting stuff with lock screen widgets in iOS

324
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,830
Speaker 5:  16, which I think is going to be very cool. And that plus a display

325
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,550
Speaker 5:  that's always on. It's like, I think there could start to be some interesting

326
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,830
Speaker 5:  stuff that like, what can your phone do when you're not even touching? It

327
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,790
Speaker 5:  is a pretty interesting idea, but that may end

328
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,480
Speaker 5:  up being as much an iOS 16 thing as a iPhone 14 thing. So

329
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,690
Speaker 5:  I don't know, but that's the thing I'm by far, most curious about,

330
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,580
Speaker 4:  So always on screen plus the new widgets and they're doing and Iowa

331
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,180
Speaker 4:  16, which include things like live updating sports scores.

332
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,560
Speaker 4:  You can kind of get a little like always on widget display. You

333
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,160
Speaker 4:  can tie that to a Mac that seems like fascinating to me. I'm assuming that's

334
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,720
Speaker 4:  only coming to the pro models.

335
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,720
Speaker 6:  How is the program to be the one to, by this time?

336
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,490
Speaker 4:  I mean, I always buy the pro because it always has.

337
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I've never been a pro person, but this is the year that seems like

338
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,990
Speaker 5:  it's, the pro is going to be like demonstrably better other than just like

339
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,030
Speaker 5:  the one slightly better camera that didn't normally has.

340
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,990
Speaker 6:  I'm an updated my phone since I'm on, I'm still on the 11. So whatever is

341
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,800
Speaker 6:  coming out, I'm going to be getting some variation of it.

342
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,950
Speaker 4:  The 11 had, I think one of the wackiest iPhone cameras. So all time

343
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,120
Speaker 4:  even taking some extremely Samsung photos this whole time, that was like,

344
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,390
Speaker 4:  that was the first one that had smart HTR. Right. And they just, they were

345
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,250
Speaker 4:  like, what if shadows didn't exist?

346
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,570
Speaker 6:  So it just goes, my dog always looks so surprised

347
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,690
Speaker 6:  that can just doesn't have any like contour to his face in the photo.

348
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,870
Speaker 4:  Every time I look at photos from that year, I'm like, what what's going on

349
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,780
Speaker 4:  with this camera? It's time out.

350
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,060
Speaker 4:  So we just running the rumors are always on display on the pro 48

351
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,900
Speaker 4:  megapixel rear camera that obviously do pixel binning to get it down to 12

352
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,890
Speaker 4:  or whatever, larger sensor to collect more light, great notch

353
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,580
Speaker 4:  situation, maybe a processor upgrade. That is like,

354
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,630
Speaker 4:  if they actually significantly upgrade the camera in that way, add the always

355
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,260
Speaker 4:  on. Sure. It makes sense. Here's the one that I think is actually going to

356
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,890
Speaker 4:  generate all the sales. You all know my theory about big sheet screens. The

357
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,730
Speaker 4:  regular iPhone 14 will come with a max

358
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,630
Speaker 4:  version, 6.7 inch display version. So it will be cheaper, but have the

359
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,140
Speaker 4:  big screen,

360
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,740
Speaker 5:  Big phone.

361
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,790
Speaker 4:  And it's like, oh, this is when they win. Right? Like this is the one, this

362
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,340
Speaker 4:  is going to be the mountain. Like we can all complain about phone sizes,

363
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,820
Speaker 4:  all we want. And then we, I think we have an Alison piece on the site today.

364
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,720
Speaker 4:  Like as we speak

365
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,730
Speaker 6:  It help reinforce the

366
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,200
Speaker 4:  Vote with their dollars man. And they vote for big cheap screens. They

367
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,950
Speaker 4:  can walk into the store and be like that 48 inch old TV looks

368
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,760
Speaker 4:  beautiful in this TCL series four that

369
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,720
Speaker 4:  is never even heard of the word. Black is huge. I'm

370
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,410
Speaker 4:  going with grays. Let's do the grays. Like every time

371
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:16,830
Speaker 4:  the

372
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,940
Speaker 5:  Motion is so smooth,

373
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,950
Speaker 4:  Like big cheap screens always win. It is a law of the

374
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,610
Speaker 4:  universe. And so to me, that is actually the,

375
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,840
Speaker 4:  whatever you tell people, the pro is a better camera, but they look at bigger

376
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Speaker 4:  screen for less money and they're going to pick the bigger screen every time.

377
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,890
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But like, that's what we're looking at, right? Like, oh,

378
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,000
Speaker 6:  Maybe some AirPods.

379
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,250
Speaker 4:  Oh, I've been on the iPhone. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to bring and come here.

380
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,530
Speaker 4:  But I mean, I find, it looks like that's what we're looking at. And then

381
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,290
Speaker 4:  yes, AirPods,

382
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,020
Speaker 6:  We're getting some new AirPods pro it sounds like maybe

383
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,920
Speaker 5:  I think there's a decent chance. AirPods pro ended up

384
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,760
Speaker 5:  being like the thing people are the most excited about, about the

385
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,750
Speaker 5:  new launches. Especially if they can add some of the like fitness stuff

386
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,590
Speaker 5:  into it and whatever sensors that are going to put into it, it's like

387
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,500
Speaker 5:  they, they might add the fins that are in the beets, which will make them

388
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,340
Speaker 5:  fit in a lot more people's ears comfortably. Like I, that, that

389
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,590
Speaker 5:  might be the kind of thing that everybody comes out being like, oh, those

390
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,990
Speaker 5:  phones are cool. But like all my God, I'm going to buy the hell out of those

391
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,180
Speaker 5:  AirPods. Like I, this might, that might happen.

392
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,560
Speaker 6:  I love the current ones. Like I'm on my second pair of them.

393
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,460
Speaker 6:  Because at some point all AirPods just stop. Right?

394
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,100
Speaker 6:  You all have this experience. They just stop working.

395
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,150
Speaker 5:  Oh, for me, the law is I will lose them on the 90th day that I

396
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,580
Speaker 5:  owed them. They will, they just poof out of existence.

397
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,240
Speaker 6:  I see. I haven't lost them. I'm convinced there's some like

398
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,200
Speaker 6:  cash and Bluetooth that doesn't get automatically cleared.

399
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,400
Speaker 6:  So all Bluetooth headphones have like a limited lifespan because of this

400
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,610
Speaker 6:  cash I've been told, this is probably not true.

401
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,650
Speaker 6:  But I, I convinced because like 18 months in, it's like, okay,

402
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,010
Speaker 6:  time to start looking for some new ones. So I'm very excited because I'm

403
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,820
Speaker 6:  at like 19 months right now. So this is for me personally,

404
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,660
Speaker 6:  huge news.

405
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,290
Speaker 4:  You're extremely made up cash theories pushed to the limit.

406
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,280
Speaker 4:  Yes,

407
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,800
Speaker 6:  I get it. I gotta to make it. I can believe in

408
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,520
Speaker 4:  Me. So these AirPods, you know, some fitness features cause they might have

409
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,060
Speaker 4:  motion sensors in them. Some of this wingtip

410
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,080
Speaker 4:  design holding ears better. Here's the big one. There's hints that they'll

411
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,220
Speaker 4:  support. Lossless audio

412
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,640
Speaker 6:  Title, title. This is your moment.

413
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,620
Speaker 4:  Well, apple music has losses now to do that. You need to

414
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,400
Speaker 4:  get beyond Bluetooth. And this is where apple makes the

415
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,130
Speaker 4:  turn and does proprietary wireless protocol for their pods.

416
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,840
Speaker 6:  If it doesn't suck, like I'm I'm I tend to be totally against

417
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,620
Speaker 6:  proprietary stuff. But apple has made a much better Bluetooth

418
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,310
Speaker 6:  radio than anybody else out there. Right? Like it just is hands down

419
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,290
Speaker 6:  better at communicating with your device

420
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,700
Speaker 4:  Because it is proprietary.

421
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,540
Speaker 6:  Right. And so if they want to go even more proprietary and it means I don't

422
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,960
Speaker 6:  have to be like, hold on, Barbara, let me smooth this huddle over to

423
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,850
Speaker 6:  speakerphone I'm in.

424
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I feel like apple has made very clear that it does

425
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,830
Speaker 5:  not give one single crap about connecting your

426
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,640
Speaker 5:  AirPods to your Android phone or your windows computer. And I feel like

427
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,090
Speaker 5:  apple is going to be perfectly happy to be like, this thing will work with

428
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,870
Speaker 5:  your apple devices and nothing else. And you all can

429
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,340
Speaker 5:  go screw yourselves.

430
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,200
Speaker 6:  Can you imagine if they cared?

431
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,530
Speaker 4:  They care a lot. They're like Bluetooth is we're serious about it. Anybody's

432
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,340
Speaker 4:  Bluetooth works. They have to pretend to care because European

433
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,940
Speaker 4:  regulators wandering the capitals of Europe are like hall. I

434
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,760
Speaker 4:  constantly, because of inter-operability

435
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,500
Speaker 4:  I don't, I don't know This. I think that's they do

436
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,910
Speaker 4:  codec and codec. It's like, it's great. Everyone loves thing it all the time.

437
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,900
Speaker 4:  That's what they talk about in France. It's cheese and interoperability between

438
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,290
Speaker 4:  codex.

439
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,960
Speaker 4:  Anyhow, they have to pretend, but they've also like

440
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,010
Speaker 4:  insane. Lock-in on the phone because of their headphones. And

441
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,890
Speaker 4:  no one else can compete in the hedge fund market against apple because of

442
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,700
Speaker 4:  the proprietary nature of AirPods. I'm going to tell the audience now that

443
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,660
Speaker 4:  our producer Liam is insistent that we get through the show in an hour

444
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,110
Speaker 4:  this week, but he wants us to do it. And so he's put a timer on the screen

445
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,980
Speaker 4:  that has now turned red, which signals that we have to wrap

446
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,360
Speaker 4:  the iPhone preview segment up. Please address your complaints to Liam about

447
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,520
Speaker 4:  the giant red timer. I think you would love to hear from you.

448
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,380
Speaker 4:  It's okay. We're going to have plenty more time to talk about apple too.

449
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,190
Speaker 4:  Yes. We got to go to the gun. We're sending an army this time. It's like

450
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,180
Speaker 4:  five of us are going, so we'll have much more apple to come

451
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Speaker 4:  when that event hits on the seventh. All right, we're gonna take a break.

452
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,810
Speaker 4:  Come back. We'll talk a little bit streaming and a little bit Elan versus

453

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,260
Speaker 4:  We're back got some Elon versus Twitter talking about, but let's start with

482
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,860
Speaker 4:  streaming. Streaming wars are back in full effect because of

483
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,670
Speaker 4:  whatever is going on at HBO and whatever is going on in Netflix,

484
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,240
Speaker 4:  which is real quick. Let's start with HBO, HBO plus

485
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,170
Speaker 4:  discovery, discovery, Warner, media, whatever it's called again, the

486
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,800
Speaker 4:  slogan is the stuff dreams are made of which literally sounds like they found

487
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,250
Speaker 4:  some dirt.

488
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,570
Speaker 4:  If there's there's gold in here, like

489
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,960
Speaker 5:  It's like the corn kid on Tik TOK. Like that's what he would come up with

490
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,680
Speaker 5:  as his tagline.

491
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,690
Speaker 4:  I know the quote is in reference to a classic movie, but just imagine

492
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,140
Speaker 4:  having to walk into that company every day and people are like, the stuff

493
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:22,980
Speaker 4:  dreams are made of

494
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,090
Speaker 5:  Tap the sign on the wall, that's it? The stuff dreams are made up every morning

495
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,300
Speaker 4:  And it's like, I'm an accountant. Like what am I supposed to do here?

496
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,980
Speaker 4:  Okay. But they're in a really strange spot, right?

497
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,700
Speaker 4:  Tons of debt, firing people more layoffs to

498
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,290
Speaker 4:  come there.

499
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,840
Speaker 6:  One of market cap is down

500
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,170
Speaker 4:  At and T bought Warner brothers like something over a hundred dollars a share

501
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,920
Speaker 4:  like 1 0 9. And right now the combined company is trading at 14. So

502
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,320
Speaker 4:  weird times over at that company,

503
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,570
Speaker 4:  they, I think they're going to, there's a rumor today. I think in puck

504
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,800
Speaker 4:  that the new streaming platform will be called HBO discovery, which is not

505
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,370
Speaker 4:  the right name.

506
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,170
Speaker 6:  It's HBO disco is right there.

507
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
Speaker 4:  It's super right there. They could just call it disco.

508
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,200
Speaker 4:  It's horrible. It's like that's 100% the

509
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,850
Speaker 4:  fake version of Disney plus,

510
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,060
Speaker 4:  but they had, they had house of the dragon this last week. It's here,

511
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,480
Speaker 4:  Alex. It says here that it was their biggest ever premiere.

512
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,950
Speaker 6:  It was their biggest ever 10, 10 million people like

513
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,950
Speaker 6:  tuned in to watch it in the United States. I think what's going to be really

514
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,790
Speaker 6:  interesting is how many people tune in for episode two? Like

515
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,360
Speaker 6:  most of the reaction was, yeah, that was some game of Thrones I watched and

516
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,930
Speaker 6:  it wasn't like super enthusiastic, but it also wasn't super like this is

517
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,710
Speaker 6:  horrible. So the CBS made an entire

518
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,580
Speaker 6:  business out of making that kind of content and like being the most

519
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,240
Speaker 6:  successful linear broadcast network in

520
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,570
Speaker 6:  history. So it's certainly possible that everybody can be like, yeah, I'll

521
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,260
Speaker 6:  keep watching this.

522
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,710
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, if you can run law and order SVU, basically at the same episode,

523
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,100
Speaker 5:  over and over for 25 years, like why not game of Thrones? And that appears

524
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,880
Speaker 5:  to be where you're headed, but I will say like, did you guys see that video

525
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,490
Speaker 5:  that was going around that somebody shot in New York where they were looking

526
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,730
Speaker 5:  into the windows of an apartment building and you could see all the TVs changing

527
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,800
Speaker 5:  at the same time because everybody was watching house of dragon.

528
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,960
Speaker 4:  So that video was from now and not from actual game of Thrones.

529
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,340
Speaker 5:  It's possible. It's fake. I don't care. Hope it's real. And if it is

530
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,430
Speaker 5:  really it's like, it is definitely true that like the house of the dragon

531
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,570
Speaker 5:  it's, it's been like the stranger things territory of like, there are like

532
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,090
Speaker 5:  a handful of shows. I feel like everyone I know pays attention to, and

533
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,910
Speaker 5:  this kind of got there on the first day, which was pretty impressive.

534
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,290
Speaker 6:  It was pretty weird. Like Charles, our entertainment critic, and I

535
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,100
Speaker 6:  both got screeners for the new house, with the dragons and

536
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,940
Speaker 6:  we both watched it and we were like, yep, we've seen it all. And so

537
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,630
Speaker 6:  we, we watched it, he wrote his review, went upgrade, we completely

538
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,290
Speaker 6:  forgot about it. And so like Sunday night, I was like, why w why is

539
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,220
Speaker 6:  Twitter like kind of quiet? Just cause everybody was watching house of dragons.

540
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,800
Speaker 6:  Like I just forgot the rest of the world was what's tuning in.

541
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,850
Speaker 4:  So that's what you want. Maybe that's HBO's entire promise is we can quiet

542
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,720
Speaker 4:  down Twitter for an hour a week. We will. And that's their service to America

543
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,170
Speaker 4:  and the world.

544
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,170
Speaker 6:  Can we just like, no stop. Don't do that.

545
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,600
Speaker 4:  The one thing about house is already going to say whatever, it's a game of

546
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,050
Speaker 4:  Thrones show. It's fine. There is horrifying scenes,

547
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,560
Speaker 4:  truly disgustingly, horrifying

548
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,010
Speaker 6:  Scenes.

549
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,770
Speaker 4:  Yeah. There's some wig issues. You know, there's a sad guy with a naked

550
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,440
Speaker 4:  lady. Like everything you expect from game of Thrones, like I've just described

551
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,890
Speaker 4:  almost every episode of game of Thrones. You have the CGI

552
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,490
Speaker 4:  budget is like where the show is theoretically more

553
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,160
Speaker 4:  expensive to make the game of Thrones. That's what they've been saying. Yeah.

554
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,000
Speaker 4:  But that opening fly, overseen where the dragon goes around the tower as

555
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,120
Speaker 4:  like, this is a cut scene from a PC game from 2012.

556
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,380
Speaker 5:  I had exactly, literally I would've put the year, like two years later,

557
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,000
Speaker 5:  but I had exactly the same reaction

558
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,830
Speaker 4:  As an

559
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,940
Speaker 5:  Assassin's creed cuts.

560
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,680
Speaker 6:  But like where did the money see? I I'm assuming the money went to the

561
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,430
Speaker 6:  CGI because like, it didn't go like the costuming is like, eh,

562
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,620
Speaker 5:  You got to pay the dragons. Dragons are expensive.

563
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,600
Speaker 6:  Like the wigs are bad. Like this cast is not like, I, I'm

564
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,490
Speaker 6:  not seeing this cast just pulling in big numbers financially.

565
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,220
Speaker 4:  It was one time when they were walking up a staircase and there was like,

566
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,210
Speaker 4:  you know, chandelier burning with fire. It's totally in the background. No

567
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,600
Speaker 4:  one else noticed this. I rewatched it three times

568
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,890
Speaker 4:  because of the fake smoke from the fire was that like blocky, pixelated

569
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,700
Speaker 4:  smoke of like fake smoke. And I was like, I

570
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,450
Speaker 4:  know we can do it's 20, 22. Like this looks like an Eddy

571
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,320
Speaker 4:  64. Yeah. I hope they do better. Although I

572
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,070
Speaker 4:  will say like GPU shortages of visual aesthetic is maybe coming

573
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,520
Speaker 4:  around.

574
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,520
Speaker 4:  All right, David, do you want to talk? I have to surprise you with this YouTube

575
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,060
Speaker 4:  TV story.

576
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,900
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So, okay. So there was this YouTube TV story. There was a report that

577
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,050
Speaker 5:  YouTube TV is going to let you watch four channels at a time. And it was

578
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,920
Speaker 5:  a, like a private thing that YouTube told a bunch of its partners.

579
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,160
Speaker 5:  And they had some new ideas about shorts and stuff. But this struck me as

580
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,380
Speaker 5:  one of those things. We like, we put it on the site. I was like, oh, that's,

581
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,310
Speaker 5:  that's neat. And then it was like gigantically popular as a story. This is

582
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,250
Speaker 5:  like one of our most read stories this week about like a relatively small

583
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,240
Speaker 5:  feature that is on YouTube TV. And I don't understand why it was so

584
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,320
Speaker 5:  popular, but apparently you do.

585
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,550
Speaker 4:  I do. Cause I looked college football, Twitter ate

586
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,680
Speaker 4:  the story, breakfast like

587
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,820
Speaker 4:  hundreds and hundreds of people were like F yeah, YouTube

588
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,810
Speaker 4:  TV. This is all I've ever wanted. And they definitely did

589
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,680
Speaker 4:  it for sports fans. Yeah. But it's like this one, sometimes the

590
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,250
Speaker 4:  story finds an audience in a way that you will never expect. And this one

591
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,790
Speaker 4:  just landed on college football, Twitter, and everyone's like, we did it.

592
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,750
Speaker 6:  Is it like specific like divisions? Is it just all

593
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,890
Speaker 6:  college football, Twitter?

594
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,670
Speaker 4:  I didn't look that deeply. I think the thing that's interesting here is

595
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,960
Speaker 4:  college football is a sport. You have access to

596
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,950
Speaker 4:  multiple games at once. All the time on Saturdays. Yeah. Right.

597
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,580
Speaker 4:  So like going from channel to channel to see different

598
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,570
Speaker 4:  games is relatively easy. And then it's an easy jump to, I can

599
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,330
Speaker 4:  see how this feature would help me watch more. College football cannot do

600
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,570
Speaker 4:  that with the NFL. Right. It's very hard to get access to lots of games in

601
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,140
Speaker 4:  the NFL. So Sunday ticket, the steam

602
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,130
Speaker 4:  powered app that I use to watch Packers games as some

603
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,060
Speaker 4:  multi-screen features, the ESPN app has multi-screen features,

604
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,750
Speaker 4:  but they don't actually have the content. It's very rare that you're going

605
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,620
Speaker 4:  to watch. You're going to open the ESPN app, watch whatever they have Monday

606
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,740
Speaker 4:  night football. Now I think it all changed. They have eight men on Monday

607
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,670
Speaker 4:  night football now, right?

608
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's right. They just paid him crazy amount of money. Yeah.

609
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,190
Speaker 4:  And Joe Buck. So they, it's very rare. They're going to open Monday night

610
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,490
Speaker 4:  football and then also be like, well, what else is on ESPN? And it's like

611
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,240
Speaker 4:  curling. Right. But it just doesn't seem like that's this what screen

612
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,690
Speaker 4:  experience you want. I will say the world Excel championships are an ESPN

613
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,480
Speaker 4:  two, which is something that you can, you can just go watch on television.

614
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,370
Speaker 4:  There is incomprehensible. It's like people being like, did you see that

615
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,430
Speaker 4:  formula? He had that in his back pocket the whole time. It's like Denny.

616
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:22,850
Speaker 4:  It's a real thing.

617
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
Speaker 5:  I felt the same way about watching it, that I did about watching ballet,

618
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,120
Speaker 5:  which is sitting there and being like, I'm confident. This is very impressive.

619
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,260
Speaker 5:  And I don't understand any of what's happening. I'm sure this is good

620
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,890
Speaker 5:  and hard. I just need another beer. If I'm going to keep watching

621
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,200
Speaker 5:  basically how I feel

622
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,390
Speaker 4:  Can we should do a live reactive. You watching both ballet and the world

623
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,020
Speaker 4:  Excel chains

624
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,010
Speaker 5:  And people are

625
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,860
Speaker 4:  Like, what's the look on David's face. All right. So that's

626
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,790
Speaker 4:  streaming. Let's talk about Twitter and Ilan a lot

627
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,290
Speaker 4:  going on with the Twitter deal on this week,

628
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,660
Speaker 6:  Mainly Twitter.

629
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,100
Speaker 4:  Well, there was a hearing on discovery, then there's a whistleblower. David,

630
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,740
Speaker 4:  you wanna take us through it?

631
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,940
Speaker 5:  Sure. So, and to your point, Alex, the one of the big open questions of the

632
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,900
Speaker 5:  week was how much this was about Elan. Cause basically the, the like very

633
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,740
Speaker 5:  short version of what happened is Peter Zico. Who's better known in the hacker

634
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,460
Speaker 5:  community as much this like long-term beloved

635
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,490
Speaker 5:  white hat, hacker who everybody believes in, who was briefly the head of

636
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,820
Speaker 5:  security at Twitter then turned whistleblower. And there was this big

637
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,780
Speaker 5:  disclosure this week in which he basically said Twitter as a company

638
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,710
Speaker 5:  is like a total security disaster. Like too many people have access to

639
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,160
Speaker 5:  too much stuff. A bunch of their stuff is not up to date. They're just not

640
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,860
Speaker 5:  running correctly. He was like this whole thing. And then buried in there.

641
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,650
Speaker 5:  He also said, I think in as many words, Twitter is lying to Elon Musk

642
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,490
Speaker 5:  about its spots. So that became a whole thing. But then sort of

643
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,600
Speaker 5:  aside that there's also this big open question about like Twitter as

644
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,720
Speaker 5:  a security nightmare, which has FTC implications because Twitter has basically

645
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,200
Speaker 5:  promised to get its act together in the past. And it brought back all this

646
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,770
Speaker 5:  stuff from two years ago, when all these famous people's accounts on Twitter

647
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,890
Speaker 5:  were hacked by what turned out to be like a couple of teenagers and then

648
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,550
Speaker 5:  used Bitcoin scams to not make very much money. It was like the worst hack

649
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,360
Speaker 5:  of all time, but they did it. And yeah, he basically was

650
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,690
Speaker 5:  like, Twitter is a mess. And I said so internally and they fired me for it.

651
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,600
Speaker 5:  So I have no choice, but to say it publicly. And then Elon Musk showed up

652
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,450
Speaker 5:  and was like, monetizeable daily active users.

653
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,060
Speaker 5:  And now here we are.

654
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,530
Speaker 4:  Okay. So unpacking that just a little bit inside of Mudges filing

655
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,370
Speaker 4:  with the sec, he did it through a law firm called whistleblower

656
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,360
Speaker 4:  aid. So he gets formal whistleblower protections also means he's really not

657
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,240
Speaker 4:  talking to that many people. Right? Here's the filings you can deduce from

658
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,210
Speaker 4:  them what you will. That means the filings are a fun read. They really,

659
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,530
Speaker 4:  Everything it's here are all of his feelings, including

660
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:47,070
Speaker 4:  feelings like Twitter is a for-profit company. And it's like,

661
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,120
Speaker 4:  yeah, nailed it. Right. Accurate.

662
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,370
Speaker 4:  So there's this part of the filings where mage talks about

663
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,310
Speaker 4:  monetize well daily active users, which is the number of Twitter reports

664
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,120
Speaker 4:  and its earnings because it's the number that counts and all it's a made

665
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,780
Speaker 4:  up number. No one else uses this metric. Twitter uses this metric

666
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,530
Speaker 4:  because it only makes money on ads. So the number of

667
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,610
Speaker 4:  users that it has that are potentially seeing

668
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,480
Speaker 4:  ads is the number that is related to how much money it can

669
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,330
Speaker 4:  make, which is what investors care about. Right? So that means if you use

670
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,230
Speaker 4:  all their Twitter clients, you're not a monetized daily active user because

671
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,510
Speaker 4:  Twitter ads aren't coming in through there, you're not getting them promoted

672
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,260
Speaker 4:  tweets and all this stuff.

673
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,660
Speaker 4:  It means that bots don't count because bots don't buy anything.

674
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,010
Speaker 5:  Bots don't log into Twitter.

675
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,840
Speaker 4:  And so you just got this like mushy definition of what it

676
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,920
Speaker 4:  monetize with daily active user is right. Twitter's claim,

677
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,180
Speaker 4:  is it 5% of its monetized will daily active

678
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,020
Speaker 4:  users are bots. And it that's the number of cares about right,

679
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,130
Speaker 4:  not 5% of all Twitter users. So there are probably

680
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,060
Speaker 4:  many total, there are more things on Twitter and a

681
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,960
Speaker 4:  huge percentage of those are bots is anybody who has interacted with

682
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,190
Speaker 4:  Twitter can probably attest to

683
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,880
Speaker 5:  It is weird because what it says is basically Twitter is saying out of all

684
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,810
Speaker 5:  of our users who aren't bots, less than 5% of them are bots, which is like,

685
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,520
Speaker 5:  seems transparently accurate. Right? But then Elon Musk is saying,

686
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,180
Speaker 5:  well, other people use Twitter who are bots. And

687
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,230
Speaker 5:  Twitter's like, yes, that's. So like everybody is just

688
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,160
Speaker 5:  sort of talking past each other about different things. And Twitter is saying,

689
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,790
Speaker 5:  well, a is true. And Elon Musk is saying, well, what about B? And Twitter's

690
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,590
Speaker 5:  like, well, I dunno, Hey, we just like,

691
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,600
Speaker 4:  And mage is like the Kool-Aid man, all of your liars

692
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,450
Speaker 4:  and thieves and the bots are everywhere. Right. And one of his lines is

693
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,080
Speaker 4:  like Twitter executives get bonuses for growing

694
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,280
Speaker 4:  users and they don't get bonuses for reducing bots. Right.

695
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,210
Speaker 4:  Which on the first cut seems like a totally reasonable thing

696
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,780
Speaker 4:  to say. And then a second cut. You're like, well of course they get bonuses

697
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,560
Speaker 4:  for growing. The number of monetized users tell it

698
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:02,770
Speaker 5:  Works

699
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,960
Speaker 4:  Everywhere because that's what makes them the money.

700
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:05,620
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

701
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,280
Speaker 4:  And if they hold it at 5% and then they can have infinity bots, as long as

702
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,460
Speaker 4:  the number of money go, the money number comes up.

703
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,870
Speaker 4:  So Elan obviously seizes on this. He's making a lot of noise. I think

704
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,290
Speaker 4:  fundamentally the, the mage whistleblower

705
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,160
Speaker 4:  complaint, like actually validates Twitter's version of events

706
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,210
Speaker 4:  in terms of bots, not all the other stuff, not all the, the government of

707
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,140
Speaker 4:  India has installed agents inside of Twitter to spy on Indian

708
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,070
Speaker 4:  Twitter users who might be dislike. That's very bad, not the too

709
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,030
Speaker 4:  many Twitter employees have password access to everyone's DMS. That

710
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,510
Speaker 4:  seems very bad by the way, Twitter for its part has said all this as a false

711
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,020
Speaker 4:  narrative in Mike's context, which is what you say. I feel like they could

712
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,860
Speaker 4:  have just searched on Twitter for what executives say when accusations are

713
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,190
Speaker 4:  made against her company and just copied and pasted it. And you say, this

714
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,850
Speaker 4:  is a false narrative.

715
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,690
Speaker 5:  It's a really great way to cast dispersions without actually refuting

716
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,800
Speaker 5:  anything like false narrative doesn't mean anything and lacks important context

717
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,890
Speaker 5:  means like we're trying as hard as we can.

718
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,410
Speaker 5:  Okay. That doesn't

719
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,440
Speaker 4:  To be fair. That's what Twitter is saying. Yeah. And then Ilan is seizing

720
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,350
Speaker 4:  on this being like everything I said is true. And then there was a discovery

721
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,070
Speaker 4:  motion in the Delaware Chancery court or favorite court in America, by the

722
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,130
Speaker 4:  way, there's an amazing Twitter account called Chancery daily, which has

723
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,060
Speaker 4:  just been a daily news account for the Chancery court for years.

724
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,280
Speaker 4:  And they're like welcome to the Thunderdome.

725
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,550
Speaker 4:  Cause it's a Lightspeed hardcore courts. So like this, this Twitter

726
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,830
Speaker 4:  accounts absolutely worth the follow because they think the whole thing is

727
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,550
Speaker 4:  so funny. So they have a hearing about discovery. Elan's

728
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,300
Speaker 4:  lawyers request everything. They're like, we can't

729
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,390
Speaker 4:  trust anything Twitter's ever said. We want all the data from the firehose.

730
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,470
Speaker 4:  Joyner says, that's ridiculous, David. I believe the court said Elan was

731
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,040
Speaker 4:  a big dummy.

732
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,940
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The court essentially cited with Twitter. There's this amazing

733
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,570
Speaker 5:  line where they basically said, if we were to do

734
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,990
Speaker 5:  what Musk and his lawyers are asking for Twitter would have to produce

735
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,160
Speaker 5:  trillions and trillions of pages of evidence and data points

736
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,240
Speaker 5:  on it. It was like every possible thing that 200 million users could have

737
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,840
Speaker 5:  maybe done. And it was basically just like, this is lunacy. We're not doing

738
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,280
Speaker 5:  this. So essentially what

739
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,030
Speaker 4:  The specific phrase, by the way, from the court defendants data requests

740
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,380
Speaker 4:  are absurdly broad.

741
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,040
Speaker 5:  There you go.

742
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:21,850
Speaker 4:  That's good.

743
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,230
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So essentially where they landed is basically like they're going to

744
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,070
Speaker 5:  give Elon Musk and his lawyer, his access to the process that Twitter

745
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,980
Speaker 5:  runs in order to make these determinations, which seems to be,

746
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,100
Speaker 5:  I think probably what Twitter would have expected because Twitter has basically

747
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,910
Speaker 5:  been through this process. Like we do a magical process to

748
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,550
Speaker 5:  figure out how many spam bots there are, but we don't keep any data. And

749
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,830
Speaker 5:  we're not going to tell you anything about it, but you should definitely

750
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,430
Speaker 5:  trust us for real. It's totally fine. So like Twitter has definitely obfuscated

751
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,640
Speaker 5:  in the course of trying to figure out how these numbers work, which I would

752
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,510
Speaker 5:  remind everyone is like actually totally material to what happened. And Elon

753
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,420
Speaker 5:  Musk had a lot of time to do due diligence and waved it. And we don't need

754
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,200
Speaker 5:  to do that again. But

755
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,510
Speaker 4:  Now it's an important to explain that a little bit. That's actually,

756
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,890
Speaker 6:  That's my favorite part of all of this.

757
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,890
Speaker 4:  He's doing a good job of convincing everyone that bots are important, but

758
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,760
Speaker 4:  they are not.

759
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,630
Speaker 5:  No, the crux of this deal is that Elon Musk,

760
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:15,860
Speaker 5:  who initially said that fixing the bot problem was one of the reasons

761
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,460
Speaker 5:  he wanted to buy Twitter, agreed to buy Twitter and signed a binding agreement

762
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,030
Speaker 5:  that had nothing to do with spam bots. There were no bot

763
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,270
Speaker 5:  contingencies in the agreement Elon Musk signed to buy Twitter

764
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,970
Speaker 6:  Waived like the right to even care about it.

765
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,930
Speaker 5:  Yes. So all of this is totally immaterial and seems to be Elon Musk, basically

766
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,540
Speaker 5:  trying to negotiate down the amount and he's going to have to pay to walk

767
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,470
Speaker 5:  away from this deal. Like I, that seems like by a wide margin, the

768
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,530
Speaker 5:  most likely outcome here is that he will write a very big check and walk

769
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:46,190
Speaker 5:  away. Who knows because it's Elon Musk always assumed the most insane thing

770
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,680
Speaker 5:  is going to happen. So I assume this will go to trial and he'll end up owning

771
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,280
Speaker 5:  Twitter. Like who knows that is the most insane thing. But anyway, where

772
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,790
Speaker 5:  this landed essentially is what it seems like the judge is saying is

773
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,840
Speaker 5:  Twitter needs to be more transparent about the process it runs, but Elon

774
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,740
Speaker 5:  Musk cannot ask Twitter to basically give him everything that has ever happened

775
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,560
Speaker 5:  to anyone in the history of Twitter, which I think is reasonably,

776
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,550
Speaker 4:  I would point out that most of the Island's wealth is in Tesla stock and

777
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,480
Speaker 4:  we didn't cover, this was not a new with us. Tesla had a three for one stock

778
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,200
Speaker 4:  split like today, which was announced ages ago,

779
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,100
Speaker 4:  but

780
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,850
Speaker 6:  Well, and he just sold them bunch. He sold like billions and it was like,

781
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,470
Speaker 6:  it's, it's it's for reasons to worry about it. Everybody's

782
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,930
Speaker 4:  Got Twitter money,

783
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,370
Speaker 6:  Twitter money.

784
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,240
Speaker 4:  So we'll see. I mean, there's just a lot tied up in finances in the market

785
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,050
Speaker 4:  and all this stuff that is like, oh, it's like my CNBC brain,

786
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,220
Speaker 4:  not my Vergecast brain, but I, David, I agree with you. The outcome

787
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,010
Speaker 4:  here is he pays a lot of money to walk away. Like I don't think he wants

788
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,580
Speaker 4:  to own Twitter in the end. I think Twitter maybe has taken a hard look in

789
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,260
Speaker 4:  the mirror and been like, we are a shit show

790
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,960
Speaker 4:  what I feel on a so we'll see. But

791
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,500
Speaker 4:  Chancery daily anchor, like literally this account is having the most fun.

792
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,520
Speaker 4:  It's my new favorite Twitter and also David and Addie and

793
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,240
Speaker 4:  Liz, right this week in Elan, our pop-up Elon Musk

794
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,050
Speaker 4:  newsletter, which has quickly become a must read because there's so

795
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,580
Speaker 4:  much Elon going on lately

796
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,750
Speaker 6:  So much. Yes.

797
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,400
Speaker 4:  I think today, Starlink and T-Mobile have an event right. Where they announced

798
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,250
Speaker 4:  some kind of partnership

799
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:21,020
Speaker 5:  And Starling also is randomly lowering the prices for some

800
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,110
Speaker 5:  people. Like, I think Thomas Ricker got an email where Starlink was just

801
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,930
Speaker 5:  like your stuff's cheaper now. And he was like meat. Yeah. And that was the

802
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,290
Speaker 5:  end of that

803
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,060
Speaker 4:  Interaction. I did not get that email from store,

804
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,250
Speaker 5:  But yeah, it just, the Elon Musk chaos is relentless

805
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,820
Speaker 5:  and it's never going to go away. Addie's most recent version

806
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,780
Speaker 5:  of this weekend on which is about all of this modern

807
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,650
Speaker 5:  sizable daily active user nonsense is very good and clear and a

808
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,180
Speaker 5:  good read. We'll put it in the show notes for sure.

809
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,140
Speaker 4:  The clock is red. Again. Liam has turned his camera on. He's smiling, but

810
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,950
Speaker 4:  it's not smiling. That means he's, he's mad at you. You know the

811
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,910
Speaker 4:  smile right before they eat. Yeah, that's fine. We got to take a

812
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,910
Speaker 4:  break. We'll be back with a little bit of a lightning round. We'll be right

813
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,090
Speaker 4:  back.

830
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,090
Speaker 4:  All right. We're back sliding around time, Liam. It started the clock. The

831
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:17,330
Speaker 4:  best part about the clock I have to say is, I don't know how long it's set

832
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,250
Speaker 4:  for. So it just turns red,

833
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,080
Speaker 6:  Yellow. First orange,

834
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,560
Speaker 5:  Whenever Liam gets bored, he just takes it to red and says, shut up

835
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,550
Speaker 4:  Three minutes of this is enough. We're done. Vergecast over. All right.

836
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,830
Speaker 4:  Lightning round Alex, which got

837
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,760
Speaker 6:  Well, Chris Welch found yesterday. I was in the office with Chris Welch and

838
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,880
Speaker 6:  he said, Hey, Alex, check slack. There's a scoop. You need to edit. And I

839
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,400
Speaker 6:  went, oh, and then I clicked. And I was like, Hey Chris, you wrote a scoop.

840
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,450
Speaker 6:  That's what happened? So he got a scoop, a little scoop magnet

841
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,850
Speaker 6:  getting all the scoops. That's not a word. Is it scoop

842
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,060
Speaker 4:  Mac?

843
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,430
Speaker 5:  Chris Welch appears to just live in that

844
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:53,360
Speaker 4:  Side of size. We're on the clock. Okay. Who knows when this is going to

845
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:53,900
Speaker 4:  turn red?

846
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,170
Speaker 6:  Sorry, Liam. Any minute he's going to turn a red. I finished talking

847
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,120
Speaker 6:  do speaker. Basically. It sounds like Sonos is going to be Sonus

848
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,020
Speaker 6:  is working on a new speaker. That's all the reporting that Chris Welch got

849
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,770
Speaker 6:  and it looks like it will probably replace the play five,

850
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,700
Speaker 6:  which is the like kind of its flagship speaker that hasn't been

851
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,120
Speaker 6:  replaced in the years. I think it's the only one that hasn't had like a big

852
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,630
Speaker 6:  update and it's going to have a

853
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,500
Speaker 6:  lot of speakers in it, firing in a lot of directions instead of just

854
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,370
Speaker 6:  like speakers, firing one direction. As most of

855
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,930
Speaker 6:  them do this, going to fire, like forward to the

856
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,620
Speaker 6:  sides up. So it'll also have some Atmos support

857
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,820
Speaker 6:  and it looks like it's, there's just going to be a smaller one

858
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,750
Speaker 6:  as well. More like the Sonos one that will do the same thing

859
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,740
Speaker 6:  with the up firing speakers. So it feels very Atmos intense.

860
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,740
Speaker 6:  And it's going to be called right now. It's code named the Optimo

861
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,890
Speaker 4:  Two, which really implies there's an Altima one. Yes

862
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:54,580
Speaker 5:  It does.

863
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,230
Speaker 6:  We don't know what that is. Unfortunately,

864
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,590
Speaker 5:  I can't figure it out about this speaker is where it goes. Cause it's like,

865
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,710
Speaker 5:  if it's going to do this sort of firing in all directions thing, it's like,

866
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,920
Speaker 5:  it's very sort of home potty in that sense. And so it's like, maybe it's

867
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,760
Speaker 5:  a, you know, you put it next to your TV and use it for music

868
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:13,720
Speaker 5:  or is it like a semi soundbar thing? And it does surround sound

869
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,670
Speaker 5:  all by itself. Like what is this thing going to be?

870
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,960
Speaker 6:  I think I'm supposed to do all of the things like what he was looking at.

871
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,470
Speaker 6:  A lot of the stuff he's gotten suggests that this is going to be one of the

872
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,410
Speaker 6:  best sounding speakers they've made. Sonus is very good at making speakers.

873
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,100
Speaker 6:  That sound really, really good. And this one is

874
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,090
Speaker 6:  something that you'll be able to put, you know, use it as that soundbar get

875
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,690
Speaker 6:  three of them up front and you and a sub woofer. And you've got 3.1

876
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,010
Speaker 6:  surround sound, right? Yeah.

877
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,130
Speaker 4:  Well, you'll have 3.1 0.2 surround sound,

878
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,850
Speaker 6:  Right? Cause you've got the, the Atmos upward firing speakers.

879
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,020
Speaker 6:  So I think that's the plan here is, is most of the

880
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,680
Speaker 6:  money that Sonos is making nowadays is in that home theater space. That's

881
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,800
Speaker 6:  really where it's moved. It's moved away from speakers in every room of the

882
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,400
Speaker 6:  house to TV. Let's do that better. And this could

883
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,700
Speaker 6:  theoretically help that without having a big ugly soundbar

884
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,460
Speaker 4:  Every now and again, I find myself reading our site like a reader, and then

885
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,420
Speaker 4:  I have these moments. So there's a line here. The verge is viewed early

886
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,260
Speaker 4:  work in progress, images of Optimo too. And I was like, wait, that's

887
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,220
Speaker 4:  me. I viewed this images. You saw the person

888
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,150
Speaker 4:  I hooked them together.

889
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:24,850
Speaker 4:  So the Kong is like a really interesting like case, right? Cause it had all

890
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:28,690
Speaker 4:  these, the big home hub, not the little one and all these drivers in it.

891
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,830
Speaker 4:  And apple was really intent on doing beam forming. It would

892
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,940
Speaker 4:  measure the echoes in your room in real time. It would use the

893
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,900
Speaker 4:  walls and like send some frequencies of the walls to create like a full

894
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,710
Speaker 4:  surround sound. And like they said, a lot of things about the home pod

895
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,440
Speaker 4:  in the end, it was just a nice sounding speaker.

896
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,800
Speaker 5:  It did sound good though. It was a ridiculous product, but it sounded really

897
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,070
Speaker 5:  good.

898
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,870
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Two of them sounded infinitely better than one, which I think was there

899
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:59,680
Speaker 4:  miss factually, it was like, it was fine. It that

900
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,580
Speaker 4:  my thing with the home pod was always, if you are the sort of person

901
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,270
Speaker 4:  who has the capacity to listen to a home pod and a

902
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,290
Speaker 4:  Sonos five and whatever the else, like in a line, you'll put

903
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,830
Speaker 4:  the home pod in the top two. But if you are not doing that

904
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:18,490
Speaker 4:  specific exercise, you cannot tell the difference between them

905
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,450
Speaker 5:  Fair,

906
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,300
Speaker 4:  Right? Like expensive speakers of that class are all just kind of different

907
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,290
Speaker 4:  in all kinds of the same. This feels like not that to me,

908
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,380
Speaker 4:  because I think it is aimed at that big Atmos music market.

909
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,880
Speaker 4:  That is a differentiator for Sonos. Very few products

910
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,780
Speaker 4:  do Atmos music. So we'll see. I don't think it's actually targeted at

911
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,740
Speaker 4:  TV stuff. And then I think that might, yeah, they've got soundbars for that.

912
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,400
Speaker 4:  And that's like their big sandbar sales are down because TV sales are down

913
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:50,120
Speaker 4:  and you buy a sandbar when you buy a new TV and rarely people upgrade their

914
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,070
Speaker 4:  sound, but the clock turned yellow. I'm freaking out.

915
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:59,150
Speaker 4:  I think this is a music speaker, like a high end music speaker to do like

916
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,170
Speaker 4:  Atmos audio, which I think is, it will be interesting for

917
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,540
Speaker 4:  Sonos to try to convince, play five customers to upgrade.

918
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,890
Speaker 6:  So now we're going to have led Zeppelin's descend from a wire above

919
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,820
Speaker 4:  Jimmy page to sneaking up behind you. That's all.

920
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,880
Speaker 4:  Anybody's, that's all anybody's ever wanted

921
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,140
Speaker 4:  by the way, USB-C line in potentially on this device, which is

922
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,460
Speaker 4:  wacky. All right, I'll do. What's my lightning round.

923
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,880
Speaker 4:  Oh, I got to talk about Peloton. All right. Let me just read you this quote.

924
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,970
Speaker 4:  There will be no further discussion because the clock's yellow.

925
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,280
Speaker 4:  This is the CEO, the new CEO of Peloton Barry

926
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,270
Speaker 4:  McCarthy. He's writing a letter to shareholders. This is how the letter

927
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,080
Speaker 4:  ends in high school. I spent three months working on a cargo

928
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,950
Speaker 4:  ship after midnight on my second voyage, I was asleep. When the

929
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,670
Speaker 4:  alarm for the general quarters woke me, my reporting station was on the bridge

930
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,270
Speaker 4:  and sentence. Next sentence. Fear is a great motivator,

931
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,860
Speaker 4:  long story. The ship is leaning. The captains, trying to turn the ship

932
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,340
Speaker 4:  around. We saved two men's lives at night. They'd been lost at sea in the

933
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,150
Speaker 4:  Mediterranean for several days of fortunate. Happy ending. Peloton is

934
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,780
Speaker 4:  like that. Cargo ship we've sounded the alarm everyone's at their

935
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,650
Speaker 4:  station. We continue to add new inputs to evolve our go-to market strategy

936
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,130
Speaker 4:  to restore growth. When will the ship respond? Is the question.

937
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,560
Speaker 4:  Our goal is fiscal year 23.

938
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,610
Speaker 5:  Does he think he just invented the idea of a big

939
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,320
Speaker 5:  ship being hard to turn into that that's a useful metaphor for business?

940
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:39,050
Speaker 5:  Like has he, he just, but he's been on a

941
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:39,830
Speaker 5:  ship.

942
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,440
Speaker 4:  I just know that when big companies wait, what was the burning? Who is the

943
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,010
Speaker 4:  burning platform? Nokia guy, hold on. Oh my God. The clock's yellow.

944
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:52,490
Speaker 4:  Ah,

945
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:54,830
Speaker 5:  Steven ILA.

946
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,700
Speaker 4:  Yes. Longtime Vergecast listeners will remember the last time we

947
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,570
Speaker 4:  discussed ocean metaphors for companies. It was our

948
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,440
Speaker 4:  boy, Steven Elop who left Microsoft,

949
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,130
Speaker 4:  became the CEO of Nokia and then sold Nokia to Microsoft

950
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,170
Speaker 4:  in a move. No one saw it coming.

951
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,090
Speaker 5:  He scared

952
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,310
Speaker 4:  Kenny Elof again, but he sent a memo that was like two people are

953
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:23,060
Speaker 4:  standing on a burning oil platform in the middle of the frigid sea, and their

954
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,910
Speaker 4:  choices to be engulfed in flames or jump into the frozen ocean.

955
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,260
Speaker 4:  And we Nokia are using windows phone, which in this

956
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,540
Speaker 4:  metaphor was the frozen ocean,

957
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:40,170
Speaker 4:  big, big burning platform vibes from Barry McCarthy. Anyway, we'll see,

958
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,170
Speaker 4:  Peloton is lost like a billion dollars this quarter. And they're like, we're

959
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,130
Speaker 4:  on track. Very good.

960
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,060
Speaker 5:  It's a real, like, like trust the process move.

961
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,020
Speaker 5:  Like there was this NBA team, the Philadelphia 76, who sucked so bad for

962
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,980
Speaker 5:  like six years. And they were like, trust us. We're going to be good eventually.

963
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,800
Speaker 5:  And then they weren't is this alert at the end of that?

964
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,860
Speaker 4:  That's my process. There was, they threw a lot of games to get draft picks

965
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,000
Speaker 4:  and then blew the draft.

966
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:03,930
Speaker 5:  Correct?

967
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You have to do a good thing at the end of the process, which is what

968
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,840
Speaker 5:  Peloton

969
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,550
Speaker 4:  Fear is a great motivator.

970
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,400
Speaker 4:  Got to read this. It's just like the hardest cut in the middle of this paragraph.

971
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,970
Speaker 5:  Terrific.

972
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,350
Speaker 4:  All right, David what's yours.

973
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,730
Speaker 5:  Mine is this news that came out just before we started recording that Ford

974
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,330
Speaker 5:  is hiking the price for the 2023 Mustang Mach II by as much as

975
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,320
Speaker 5:  $8,000. And this is part of a bigger thing where there was a

976
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,590
Speaker 5:  study that the average price of an electric vehicle has gone up like almost

977
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,130
Speaker 5:  50%. And this is bad for like a lot of

978
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:41,880
Speaker 5:  like climate change. We need more electric vehicles reasons, but it's particularly

979
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,660
Speaker 5:  bad for me because I have to buy a car. And every

980
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,650
Speaker 5:  single day it feels like I just like watch more of my money, disappear into

981
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,980
Speaker 5:  the car buying process. And I haven't even bought a car yet. It's not great.

982
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,310
Speaker 4:  Well, one, you got to buy a card for the end of the year because the tax

983
00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:00,210
Speaker 4:  credit situation next year is going silent. So I'm also like,

984
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,550
Speaker 4:  okay, I gotta do. I gotta go buy an Evie.

985
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Are you deaf doing?

986
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,850
Speaker 5:  I don't know. This is like an ongoing debate with my wife because we don't

987
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,030
Speaker 5:  really, we don't have a driveway. So our like overnight charging infrastructure

988
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:15,900
Speaker 5:  is less than ideal, but like two years from now, David is going to

989
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,640
Speaker 5:  feel really stupid if I don't buy an Evie. So I don't know. I'm I'm

990
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,160
Speaker 5:  torn.

991
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,240
Speaker 6:  That's why I at least, cause I was like, oh, I really want Eve. But I live

992
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,550
Speaker 6:  in New York city and it's not great.

993
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,100
Speaker 4:  So, oh my God.

994
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,510
Speaker 6:  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I guess it was great.

995
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,110
Speaker 6:  Nevermind. Keep going.

996
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,360
Speaker 4:  What kind of podcast for nerds is that's wait, it's this

997
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,590
Speaker 4:  podcast for nerds?

998
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,930
Speaker 4:  Well, she got to buy one because we got a great explainer from Andy. That's

999
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:49,410
Speaker 4:  getting way more complicated. Especially if the cars aren't made like

1000
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:52,830
Speaker 4:  fewer cars will qualify next year because some of them aren't made in the

1001
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:56,670
Speaker 4:  United States, like the V6, the BMWs, and then

1002
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,730
Speaker 4:  a few years from now. If the batteries are made in United States, nothing

1003
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,850
Speaker 4:  will qualify. So there's like a race. I was at a car dealer today this morning,

1004
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:06,840
Speaker 4:  actually, because I decided that I should not buy it like a $10,000 beater,

1005
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,020
Speaker 4:  BMW and buy something that might put my family in.

1006
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,280
Speaker 5:  I really like imagining you every morning, just swinging by. And they like,

1007
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,820
Speaker 5:  they see you coming and they're like, make me lies here. And you like know

1008
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,070
Speaker 5:  all the people at the dealership by name. Now,

1009
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:20,580
Speaker 6:  Hear

1010
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,310
Speaker 4:  Him watching a car dealer, go from thinking that I'm an easy mark to being

1011
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:28,150
Speaker 4:  like, oh my God, dude, this guy, Thomas, I have no cars to sell

1012
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,860
Speaker 4:  just this week a Jeep, which has still not shipped the hybrid grand Cherokee

1013
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,270
Speaker 4:  sent everyone hats. Did

1014
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:34,930
Speaker 5:  They announce it again?

1015
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,650
Speaker 4:  They've announced it again. This week they sent everyone hats who had

1016
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,250
Speaker 4:  pre-ordered. Some of the clock went from red to blue, which is, I don't know

1017
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,880
Speaker 4:  what's going on. It's even worse when it's down, it

1018
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,720
Speaker 4:  starts roping. But you got to buy a car

1019
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,030
Speaker 4:  before the new year. If you want the credit, because next year it's going

1020
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:56,020
Speaker 4:  to go sideways. But there are no cars to buy also Ford going up

1021
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,170
Speaker 4:  by $8,000 when they are now guaranteed to get more

1022
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:03,010
Speaker 4:  $7,500 tax credits, every dealer is going to say, it's the

1023
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,010
Speaker 4:  price went up, but just cross it out. You're getting it right back. And I

1024
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:09,760
Speaker 4:  think that's fairly cynical on Ford's part. Yes, we'll see. But

1025
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,580
Speaker 4:  the wrong is that you can't buy any of these cars. Like what are we even

1026
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,180
Speaker 4:  complaining about?

1027
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,260
Speaker 5:  There seems to be no better insight. Like it's it's the chip shortage keeps

1028
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,980
Speaker 5:  going. The people are like, everybody bought too much stuff. It's like,

1029
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,100
Speaker 5:  we're this doesn't seem like it's going to get any better. Like shortly.

1030
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,790
Speaker 4:  The problem with EVs is not so much the trip shortage it's battery shortage.

1031
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:31,450
Speaker 4:  Ford has no battery capacity. That's the problem that needs to solve. That's

1032
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:35,020
Speaker 4:  actually why the future tax credits are pegged to battery manufacturing.

1033
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,750
Speaker 4:  The United States, because the government's like, we know you need battery

1034
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,420
Speaker 4:  capacity. You better put it here. If you want these credits, you have the

1035
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,550
Speaker 6:  Chip shortage. I started to go away. Right?

1036
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,510
Speaker 4:  That's tough. I don't know the answer. I ask people. The

1037
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,410
Speaker 4:  CEO of arm is going to be indicators in the podcast that we don't talk about

1038
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:50,820
Speaker 4:  it. The show

1039
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,150
Speaker 5:  Never heard of it.

1040
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,820
Speaker 4:  It took me the whole episode. This time, Liam. Lena's not just on the clock.

1041
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:55,960
Speaker 4:  Right?

1042
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,170
Speaker 6:  Good. Where did you work? What was the magazine you worked at that we're

1043
00:57:59,170 --> 00:57:59,530
Speaker 6:  not allowed

1044
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,020
Speaker 5:  To name? I don't know who, who can remember.

1045
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,590
Speaker 4:  Let's see if anybody can sell me an electric car, please play

1046
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,770
Speaker 4:  whatever it is. As long as I can plug it into something

1047
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,850
Speaker 6:  On the Dakota,

1048
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,830
Speaker 4:  We're a new whole episode where a car salesman just has to deal with me.

1049
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,840
Speaker 4:  It'll be maybe our best episode.

1050
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,090
Speaker 5:  So I love

1051
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:22,350
Speaker 4:  It. Like listening to the sound of a car salesman or

1052
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,930
Speaker 4:  salesperson, listening to the sound of a car salesperson's voice. When I

1053
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:29,380
Speaker 4:  ask exactly which version of adaptive cruise control the car has

1054
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,190
Speaker 4:  is, they're just like, I don't know, man. And then I say something like,

1055
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,890
Speaker 4:  can you take a picture of the cruise control stock and send it to me? And

1056
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:39,490
Speaker 4:  they're like, what? Because that's the level on habits.

1057
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,770
Speaker 5:  And then you say things like, oh, well, when the Ford CEO was on decoder,

1058
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,940
Speaker 5:  he told me and they're like, what?

1059
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,910
Speaker 4:  It's real bad. Anyway, that's our show. The clock is turning all

1060
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,570
Speaker 4:  kinds of colors. Now Liam's gone from smiling to frown and God

1061
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:00,070
Speaker 4:  he's very cute from, yeah, that's it.

1062
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,910
Speaker 4:  That's the show you can tweet at us. David is at Pierce. Alex is Alex H

1063
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,780
Speaker 4:  Kranz I'm at reckless. You can go read that story. The

1064
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:11,140
Speaker 4:  iPhone killer, which David just had another emotional reaction to when I

1065
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,440
Speaker 4:  said it, you really were in a world of shit for like a month after that store.

1066
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,180
Speaker 5:  Oh it was it. Yeah. Yeah. It was. It helped to have quotes.

1067
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:19,900
Speaker 5:  I'll just say that

1068
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:20,620
Speaker 4:  From the record.

1069
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,550
Speaker 5:  I didn't say it. Yeah. Kevin Lynch

1070
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,700
Speaker 4:  Did. Why are we, why do we hammer home about being on the record so much?

1071
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,600
Speaker 4:  Cause it's not our fault. All right. That's it. There's a bunch of

1072
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,080
Speaker 4:  great stuff on the verge. Love more coverage coming up of the upcoming apple

1073

Speaker 4:  event. What's next week on the Wednesday episode, David

Speaker 5:  We're off next.

1075
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,320
Speaker 4:  Okay. What was this week on Wednesday episode David,

1076
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,520
Speaker 5:  This week we spent the whole episode talking about the stream deck and

1077
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,450
Speaker 5:  buttons because the Vergecast let's button and it was a

1078
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,420
Speaker 5:  very fun episode. And Eva, did you wanna have a stream deck? You should listen

1079
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,820
Speaker 5:  to it. Although there's like a 40% chance you will end up buying a stream

1080
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:53,540
Speaker 5:  deck at the end of it. Yes.

1081
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,600
Speaker 4:  It's very true. Someone sent us a picture of a rack Mount street back in

1082
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,420
Speaker 4:  now. That's all I want in the world and crap again. All right, that's it.

1083
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:00,740
Speaker 4:  We did it Leah
