00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,960
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of glassholes.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,280
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am currently in my, I don't know, we

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,240
Speaker 2:  call it the utility room, but it's the room with like my washer and the furnace

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,920
Speaker 2:  and also it's like where we keep all of our extra paper towels, whatever

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
Speaker 2:  we call that room. That's where I am. I just finished my latest

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,320
Speaker 2:  home improvement project, which was to replace a bunch of

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,160
Speaker 2:  doorknobs over the course of the last two years since we bought a house.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,800
Speaker 2:  I've gone from like I can put together Ikea furniture and feel

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,120
Speaker 2:  unnecessarily proud of myself for a week level handy to

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,880
Speaker 2:  I can watch a bunch of YouTube videos about that and probably figure out

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,240
Speaker 2:  how to take it apart and out of the wall and put it back together and back

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,960
Speaker 2:  in the wall again. Feels like big progress. I'm not really sure it's actually

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,280
Speaker 2:  all that big progress. But anyway, I just replaced a bunch of doorknobs,

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,880
Speaker 2:  which I truly cannot recommend enough as a project to give you

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,040
Speaker 2:  more pleasure than it was work like. Now every time I hold onto

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,360
Speaker 2:  that doorknob I'm like, I did this even though it was like unscrewing four

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,200
Speaker 2:  screws and screwing four screws back in again. And by the way, if you have

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,080
Speaker 2:  more ideas for home improvement projects that are very little work

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,320
Speaker 2:  and make you feel very proud of yourself for a long time, please send them

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,920
Speaker 2:  my way. I'd love to hear all about them. Anyway, we have an awesome show

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,680
Speaker 2:  coming up for you today. We're gonna talk about the right to repair fight

23
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,680
Speaker 2:  that has happened in California. There's a new law there that I actually

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,640
Speaker 2:  think it's a big deal for the whole way that we buy and repair and

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,280
Speaker 2:  use our electronics. We're also gonna talk about the new smart glasses

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,080
Speaker 2:  from Meta and Ray Ban. I think these are fascinating. You've heard me talk

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,920
Speaker 2:  about why I think smart glasses are interesting really for the last few weeks

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,440
Speaker 2:  since Amazon launched the new echo frames and Meta has these new smart glasses.

29
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,240
Speaker 2:  This is just a device category I find totally fascinating.

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,640
Speaker 2:  Vs. Song has been reviewing them for us. We're gonna talk to her and get

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,040
Speaker 2:  the whole rundown. And of course we're gonna get to The Vergecast Hotline.

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,440
Speaker 2:  We have a fun one today, which is a question I have also had. All that is

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,920
Speaker 2:  coming up in just a second. But first I just realized all of the batteries

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,480
Speaker 2:  to my drill are now dead because I don't use this thing enough and should

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,160
Speaker 2:  probably charge it more often. So I'm gonna go plug a bunch of stuff in and

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,320
Speaker 2:  then we're gonna get to it. This is The Vergecast. See you in a sec.

37
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,870
Speaker 3:  It's not just sci-fi anymore. Virtual reality for work is here.

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,230
Speaker 3:  Mixed reality for work is here and companies everywhere are using them

39
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,030
Speaker 3:  both to transform how they operate. Architects are able to walk

40
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,870
Speaker 3:  through buildings and mixed reality before they're even built. Coworkers

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,670
Speaker 3:  from opposite ends of the earth are working shoulder to shoulder in VR spaces

42
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,190
Speaker 3:  and all sorts of workers from pilots to underwater welders are getting trained

43
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,430
Speaker 3:  in a virtual environment that's safer and more cost effective.

44
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,990
Speaker 3:  That's metaphor work, giving you VR and tech to work smarter,

45
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,030
Speaker 3:  closer, safer together. Learn more at for work

47
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,300
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Let's talk about glasses first because like I said, I am

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,200
Speaker 2:  totally fascinated by this whole category. Are smart glasses the

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,600
Speaker 2:  future? Are they nothing? I don't know, but I do know this.

50
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,520
Speaker 2:  Nobody is pushing the idea of smart glasses harder than Meta right now.

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,520
Speaker 2:  I really think that Meta believes that smart glasses something that looks

52
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,840
Speaker 2:  like a pair of glasses but is just absolutely loaded with technology

53
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,320
Speaker 2:  is the future in a very real way. It's new smart glasses, which it made

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,160
Speaker 2:  in partnership with RayBan just went on sale. They start at 299 bucks.

55
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,040
Speaker 2:  They look pretty nice. They are very much not that tech filled

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,640
Speaker 2:  future of everything, but Meta says they're vastly better than the last model.

57
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,640
Speaker 2:  The stories for everything from taking phone calls to taking video. The

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,960
Speaker 2:  Verges Victoria song has the smart glasses and she's been wearing them all

59
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,000
Speaker 2:  over New York for the last few days. So I called her up to see what life

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,960
Speaker 2:  is like as a smart glasses wearer in 2023 v Welcome

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,920
Speaker 2:  back. Hello. The listeners should know that what happened when we got

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,200
Speaker 2:  on this call to do this was you showed up wearing the smart glasses

63
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,160
Speaker 2:  and immediately took them off, which on the one hand is like you're, you're

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,120
Speaker 2:  sitting inside of your house wearing sunglasses, which is bad news, but also

65
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,720
Speaker 2:  like says something about the state of smart glasses that you could only

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,600
Speaker 2:  handle being on camera with them on for about eight seconds before it all

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:07,920
Speaker 2:  fell apart.

68
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,080
Speaker 4:  Well a lot of this was because You know it's sunglasses and

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,960
Speaker 4:  I'm indoors and my computer screen is not so blinding that

70
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,920
Speaker 4:  I need that and my vision is not good at all. So this is

71
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,880
Speaker 4:  like I'm gonna blame Meta for sending me the sunglasses version instead

72
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,800
Speaker 4:  of the one with clear lenses or transition lenses. That's fair. But it

73
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,360
Speaker 4:  kind of, it does kind of get to the issue of this whole

74
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,120
Speaker 4:  smart glasses, smart sunglasses divide. I

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Speaker 4:  just had these on So. I could take a tiny little clip 'cause we're gonna

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,280
Speaker 4:  do a social video like day in the life and this is part of my day in the

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,320
Speaker 4:  life. So that, that was it. That's all.

78
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,120
Speaker 2:  I love that for you. So let's start with big feelings about smart glasses.

79
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,920
Speaker 2:  So you've had these things for several days now. You've been like running

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,480
Speaker 2:  around using them in your real life, trying to like immerse yourself in smart

81
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,160
Speaker 2:  glasses life as much as you can in order to do this review really well.

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,360
Speaker 2:  What have you found about like how the world and the idea of smart

83
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,640
Speaker 2:  glasses interact?

84
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,840
Speaker 4:  I feel like we're in a weird middle because You know I've been using smart

85
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,760
Speaker 4:  glasses for years. I've used several iterations of these audio

86
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,840
Speaker 4:  smart glasses before and some of the ones that You know were

87
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,800
Speaker 4:  more full featured, like having a secondary display in your eyes

88
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,880
Speaker 4:  and usually it's just You know they're

89
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,760
Speaker 4:  fine up until you find the friction in your daily life where

90
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,680
Speaker 4:  you're just like, okay, it's just too much work to use these versus

91
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,080
Speaker 4:  my phone versus my normal paragraph of glasses.

92
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,440
Speaker 4:  So I will say that with these that friction,

93
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,760
Speaker 4:  it takes longer to get there. There are reasons why you would wanna put it

94
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,480
Speaker 4:  on your face. Whereas in the past I've always been like, no,

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,280
Speaker 4:  why? Why would I reach for the smart one unless I have a very

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,360
Speaker 4:  specific instance. But I've used a bunch in my career and

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,880
Speaker 4:  I have to say that these are the ones that have thus far kind of

98
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,920
Speaker 4:  fit into my life the best though. There are a lot of a lot

99
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,680
Speaker 4:  of caveats to that. Like a lot of like asterisk, asterisk, asterisk,

100
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Speaker 4:  asterisk. Yeah.

101
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,520
Speaker 2:  And Liz, I wanna get to those in a minute. But like the thing that jumps

102
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,160
Speaker 2:  out to me the most, and I got a brief demo of this before the launch

103
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,840
Speaker 2:  where we just kind of got to like try them on on like the roof of a building

104
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,080
Speaker 2:  in New York and play with them for a few minutes. And the thing that jumped

105
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,040
Speaker 2:  out to me the most was just that they look like sunglasses, which is such

106
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,920
Speaker 2:  a stupid obvious thing to say. But like we've been talking about these devices

107
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,720
Speaker 2:  for a long time and like you said, you've, we've tried the Bose ones and

108
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,120
Speaker 2:  Amazon has the echo frames, which it's also sort of pushing in the looks

109
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,880
Speaker 2:  more like glasses realm, but like Meta's working with

110
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,000
Speaker 2:  RayBan here and I'm even looking at the ones sitting on your head right now

111
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,920
Speaker 2:  and like if I didn't look for a long time, which no one is going to,

112
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,080
Speaker 2:  people don't like really spend a lot of time staring at other people's glasses,

113
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,040
Speaker 2:  they just look like glasses. And that strikes me as like very, very

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,400
Speaker 2:  important. They're like easily the most stylish smart glasses

115
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,400
Speaker 2:  I've seen. Has that been your experience so far?

116
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,680
Speaker 4:  They're pretty on par I think with like the Bose soprano, which is like the,

117
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,560
Speaker 4:  the nicer looking version. Okay. Of the Bose tempo, the non

118
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,440
Speaker 4:  Deron version,

119
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,080
Speaker 2:  It's a technical term. The non giron version, the

120
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,400
Speaker 4:  The non giron version. Do I look like a giron? Like that's one of the, the

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
Speaker 4:  main criteria I grade these.

122
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,280
Speaker 2:  It's a good technology test actually for like all wearables like the the

123
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,880
Speaker 2:  Gioni factor like one to 10. I feel like that's a good one.

124
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,560
Speaker 4:  So these are very not Gioni like, but what I will say is most

125
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,880
Speaker 4:  consumer smart glasses, they go for the very boxy Warby

126
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,760
Speaker 4:  Parker Wayfair vibe because that's like, I think

127
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,320
Speaker 4:  that's what they've kind of identified as the most universally

128
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,960
Speaker 4:  flattering, although it's still not flattering for everyone. The most

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,480
Speaker 4:  universally flattering form factor that they can go with. And

130
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,480
Speaker 4:  it was a very smart choice for Meta to team up with RayBan

131
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,280
Speaker 4:  or Esther Luxottica, their parent company because You know

132
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,080
Speaker 4:  Raybans, everyone finds them to be like even if you don't like them,

133
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,080
Speaker 4:  they're kind of iconic in terms of fashion. So yeah, these are

134
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
Speaker 4:  probably in the top two of best looking

135
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,560
Speaker 4:  audio slash camera sunglasses I've ever

136
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,800
Speaker 4:  worn Low bar since we're all kind of going for the same

137
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,920
Speaker 4:  vibe. But what I will say is you have so many more style options with

138
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,240
Speaker 4:  this than you do with others. So that I think is a huge

139
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,000
Speaker 4:  underrated plus with these glasses because You know

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,880
Speaker 4:  we don't talk about it enough in terms of wearables 'cause we're geeky people.

141
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,760
Speaker 4:  We love to talk about the specs and everything like that, but how they look

142
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,040
Speaker 4:  and the design is such an integral and crucial part

143
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,840
Speaker 4:  of smart glasses more so than any other piece of wearable technology because

144
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,080
Speaker 4:  it's on your face. Yeah. And we're a vain creature.

145
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,360
Speaker 4:  We are a vain peoples. Like if I put something on my face, it

146
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,560
Speaker 4:  better look good. I don't wanna look like a duvass. Like I,

147
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,720
Speaker 4:  this is the money maker, right? This is how people see us, this is how people

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,360
Speaker 4:  perceive us. No one's gonna wear these things if they're like,

149
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,920
Speaker 4:  I look like the kid from a Christmas story. Or like You know the, the

150
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,800
Speaker 4:  kid who shoots his eye out with the BB gun, right? No one wants to look like

151
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,680
Speaker 4:  that. No one wants to look like a really dorky person. You wanna

152
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,520
Speaker 4:  look good, you wanna look Kingsman Exy in a,

153
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,440
Speaker 4:  in a nice little suit wearing his dapper little smart glasses. That's what

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,720
Speaker 4:  you want.

155
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,200
Speaker 2:  Dude, I have spent so many years now telling people that like,

156
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,400
Speaker 2:  forget ready Player one, forget Minority Report, forget her.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,680
Speaker 2:  Kingsman is the future of technology that we should all hope for.

158
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,560
Speaker 2:  Like just look at that movie and that's, that's what I want. I wanna

159
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,480
Speaker 2:  look like that. I want green avatars of people sitting around a table while

160
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,440
Speaker 2:  we have a meeting. Like give me Kingsman or give me nothing I could

161
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,160
Speaker 2:  not agree with you more.

162
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,840
Speaker 4:  There are parts of like actually where I was testing these where I was like,

163
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,600
Speaker 4:  oh shit, I'm exy from the second

164
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,400
Speaker 4:  movie because there is the, oh crap, I got these

165
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,760
Speaker 4:  smart glasses playing music. Okay, I have to take them off now because I

166
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,720
Speaker 4:  touched them accidentally. But Kingsman, he

167
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,440
Speaker 4:  in the second movie, he's at like a dinner and he's just taking pictures

168
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,240
Speaker 4:  and recording things and I really felt like that this time around because

169
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,440
Speaker 4:  that's what I was doing on my commute one day and I felt like such

170
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,640
Speaker 4:  a spy, like an incog. I was like, oh my god, I'm taking pictures. And people

171
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,640
Speaker 4:  don't know, right? It's, it's totally like freaky. And they

172
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,320
Speaker 4:  have these little LEDs that are on the outside that are

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
Speaker 4:  supposed to signal when you're taking a video and when you're taking a photo

174
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,760
Speaker 4:  And, what I found is that It works indoors. Especially

175
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,560
Speaker 4:  if you are an ethical person and you're like, Hey I have this device and

176
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,520
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna do these things with it, but when I'm outside, boom. Yeah.

177
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,920
Speaker 4:  As to whether you can see it easily and

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Speaker 2:  It requires like looking at you while you do it. Which

179
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,720
Speaker 2:  most of the time, again, no one is I I'm glad you brought that up and I

180
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Speaker 2:  like I start with that because like not only do I think the way that it looks

181
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,160
Speaker 2:  is important to the way It works, I think it's the whole thing, right? And

182
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,760
Speaker 2:  I think we've, we've talked about it like, oh you have to have cool technology

183
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,840
Speaker 2:  and they have to look cool. No, no, no. If it doesn't look cool, none of

184
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,440
Speaker 2:  the rest of it matters, right? Like I think that's what we learned from Google

185
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,120
Speaker 2:  Glass. That's what we're learning with the VR headsets. Like if you don't

186
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,080
Speaker 2:  have something that is at least inoffensive that no one is going to

187
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,560
Speaker 2:  look at you when you walk by on the street, like that's the baseline. The

188
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,360
Speaker 2:  better part of it is you get to the like You know I, I feel like

189
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,640
Speaker 2:  where Apple got with like the wired headsets back in the day where they could

190
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Speaker 2:  just do a silhouette and you saw nothing but the white wire and you knew

191
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,600
Speaker 2:  exactly what it was and you've like made something iconic. That's what you

192
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,920
Speaker 2:  want with all of this. But none of it matters. If it doesn't look cool, no

193
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
Speaker 2:  one's gonna wear these things, especially on their face if you can't make

194
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,360
Speaker 2:  them fashionable and stylish and make people actually want to wear them

195
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,360
Speaker 2:  even features aside. And the good news is I think belatedly, everyone

196
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,320
Speaker 2:  now knows that because of the way that Google Glass went. So I'm, I'm

197
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,000
Speaker 2:  optimistic about the road all of these are on, but you brought up the camera

198
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,080
Speaker 2:  and I think the two reason these things exist is

199
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,560
Speaker 2:  one for the sort of audio stuff which I think is interesting. Making calls,

200
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,880
Speaker 2:  playing music, that kind of thing. And the camera and Meta obviously made

201
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,000
Speaker 2:  a big deal about the camera. It's where they put in a lot of the engineering

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Speaker 2:  work you can do the live streaming, all that stuff. We have not had good

203
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,560
Speaker 2:  luck with face cameras in the past being like good

204
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,360
Speaker 2:  cameras that you actually take videos and photos you want to do things

205
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
Speaker 2:  with. How did these turn out? How, how did, how do you feel?

206
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,640
Speaker 4:  Surprisingly good really to the point where you're angry

207
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,960
Speaker 4:  because the original Ray band stories looked like potato

208
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,880
Speaker 4:  vision, anything you took a picture on it kind of looked like

209
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,400
Speaker 4:  a potato, right? Yeah. Like there's just nothing you could do about it. It's

210
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,320
Speaker 4:  fuzzy. It looks like circa 2010 level phone

211
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,200
Speaker 4:  camera. This I think you could get away with saying, oh an

212
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,880
Speaker 4:  iPhone took this photo. Like it's that good.

213
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,720
Speaker 4:  There's caveats again. Like there's a little fisheye

214
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,160
Speaker 4:  distortion going on with everything you take and you really

215
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,720
Speaker 4:  can't think about it until you've worn it. But

216
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,160
Speaker 4:  there's a real p o v factor to all the photos

217
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,920
Speaker 4:  and videos that you take with this. So if you're on a phone, you can see

218
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,520
Speaker 4:  what you're filming. You know when you're off kilter, You know,

219
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,520
Speaker 4:  like to kind of just micro adjust while you're doing things. Yeah. There,

220
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,400
Speaker 4:  that's not necessarily what you're gonna be thinking about when you have

221
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,680
Speaker 4:  glasses 'cause you're not seeing the footage as it's being taken in real

222
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,640
Speaker 4:  time. So there's a lot of photos that I took where I'm

223
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,560
Speaker 4:  like, oh I'm doing the puppy dog tilt where my head is like tilt tilted

224
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,640
Speaker 4:  to a side 'cause I'm looking at something and that was actually a behavior

225
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,720
Speaker 4:  I didn't know I did until I was like re-looking at my footage. I was

226
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,560
Speaker 4:  like, oh I, I tilt my head a lot when I'm looking at things or when I'm

227
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,320
Speaker 4:  trying to suss things out. The other stuff is like I have

228
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,920
Speaker 4:  curtain bangs, which are You know if you don't know fashion curtain

229
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,000
Speaker 4:  bangs are face length framing bangs. I have a lot of ruined

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,400
Speaker 4:  photos of my cats because there's just hair like

231
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,440
Speaker 4:  obscuring part of their cute face. So now I have to do this thing where it's

232
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,120
Speaker 4:  like when I put these glasses, the new is to swoosh back my

233
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,840
Speaker 4:  bangs so that they don't ruin any footage. And that's not something

234
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,240
Speaker 4:  I ever thought about before. Or when I'm walking and taking

235
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,360
Speaker 4:  video and I'm talking with someone, like it was very funny watching

236
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,320
Speaker 4:  this footage back because you can just see me look straight every so

237
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,280
Speaker 4:  often while my partner was talking sometimes at like the most crucial

238
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,640
Speaker 4:  interesting parts. Because what I'm doing is trying not to fall flat on my

239
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,760
Speaker 4:  face. I'm trying to see where I'm going. I'm not trying to walk into a tree

240
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,040
Speaker 4:  like Looney tune style. So there's just kind of a real

241
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,280
Speaker 4:  found footage quality to the videos that I've taken thus far.

242
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,400
Speaker 4:  And it's a muscle memory that you have to learn, you have to retrain

243
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,520
Speaker 4:  yourself entirely to film in this context. But

244
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,320
Speaker 4:  it's still like in terms of video quality and photo quality,

245
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,000
Speaker 4:  you could share it very easily and no one would know that

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,720
Speaker 4:  it was taken on a potato camera. It's shareable, it's share ready,

247
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,400
Speaker 4:  which is pretty freaky when you think about it.

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,480
Speaker 2:  Well yeah, it's, it's interesting to think about taking photos kind of at

249
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,080
Speaker 2:  your eye level, which is essentially where the cameras are, right? They're

250
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,440
Speaker 2:  kind of like just above and outside your eyes, right as you're wearing the

251
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,680
Speaker 2:  glasses, that seems like it would be very natural. It takes a picture of

252
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,400
Speaker 2:  what you're looking at, but you never really think about all the work your

253
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,480
Speaker 2:  brain is doing when you're looking at something that the camera can't then

254
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,520
Speaker 2:  do to do things like solve for head tilt. Like your brain

255
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,440
Speaker 2:  doesn't think the world goes askew every time you tilt

256
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,800
Speaker 2:  your head to look at something, but your camera's sure going to and the thing

257
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,240
Speaker 2:  where you can't look down because it's gonna screw up your shot. Like

258
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,680
Speaker 2:  in a way it seems like we sort of all understand the like

259
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,000
Speaker 2:  language of how to take a phone photo now. And it seems like doing it

260
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,080
Speaker 2:  without any of that guidance or help or sort of dynamic feedback

261
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,360
Speaker 2:  would be much harder. Like if you found yourself taking pictures you thought

262
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,000
Speaker 2:  were gonna be good at the moment that turned out to be bad just because of

263
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,560
Speaker 2:  the like mechanics of how you shot it. Like if you had stood there and taken

264
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,440
Speaker 2:  a picture with an equivalently good phone camera, would it have turned out

265
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,560
Speaker 2:  better than what you got out of your glasses?

266
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,320
Speaker 4:  Absolutely. So many. I would actually say like the majority of my first day

267
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,040
Speaker 4:  or two of just taking photos, a lot of them ended up being like,

268
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,560
Speaker 4:  no good. 'cause I would look at like what came out and be like, oh the quality

269
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,240
Speaker 4:  is really impressive. Especially I was impressed by the low light but like,

270
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,080
Speaker 4:  oh the, the quality is impressive but I can't use this because it looks like

271
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,120
Speaker 4:  one, I really love a Dutch angle, which I don't, which 'cause my

272
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Speaker 4:  head is tilting. But also there's things like movement. I guess

273
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,760
Speaker 4:  the big sell is that when you're on the go and you see something like, oh

274
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,920
Speaker 4:  your cat is doing something really cute and you just wanna like get it real

275
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,760
Speaker 4:  quick, well you actually have to be quite still. You have to stand still

276
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,440
Speaker 4:  and you have to like click it and you can't move while you do it otherwise

277
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,080
Speaker 4:  you're just gonna get, or unless this is what you want, a very blurred

278
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,400
Speaker 4:  motion shot, right? So a lot of the shots that I took on my first

279
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,440
Speaker 4:  walk, I couldn't actually see what I was taking a photo of Well because

280
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,240
Speaker 4:  I was like, oh that's a beautiful shot of the Queensboro bridge and it's

281
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
Speaker 4:  blurry, right? Or that's a car that I think my partner would

282
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,000
Speaker 4:  love to know what it is. It's yellow and sporty and I don't know what cars

283
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,040
Speaker 4:  are so, oh well I can't see the logo now because it's a little

284
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,240
Speaker 4:  blurry. Like there was a lot of that going on. So once you're

285
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,440
Speaker 4:  aware of it, you can just kind of adjust and be like, oh, if I'm gonna take

286
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,040
Speaker 4:  a picture, I need to stand still. Click wait for the sound

287
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,160
Speaker 4:  and then move on. So it's a little bit of learning how to

288
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,880
Speaker 4:  work with the device in that respect. But the

289
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,960
Speaker 4:  difference is, is that if you do do that, the result of what you're gonna

290
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,880
Speaker 4:  get is a lot better than what we've seen so far in this

291
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,520
Speaker 4:  category. So it's sort of like a, it's sort of a noticeable

292
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,880
Speaker 4:  step in terms of progression forward. So I was, I was quite

293
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,400
Speaker 4:  like shocked and at the same time like, oh this is how I'm gonna have to

294
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Speaker 4:  adjust to use this properly. Yeah

295
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,920
Speaker 2:  That that kind of makes it make sense why all of Meta's marketing material

296
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,880
Speaker 2:  for this is like put on the glasses, start a video and then sit down and

297
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,680
Speaker 2:  play drums or look down while you use your hands to make something. Like

298
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,960
Speaker 2:  there's a very sort of specific moment for it. Like I'm sitting

299
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
Speaker 2:  on the couch and my kid over there does something interesting like that's,

300
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,960
Speaker 2:  that's a moment for it. Whereas I think a lot of the sort of run and gun

301
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,440
Speaker 2:  stuff phones are really good for these might not be, despite the fact that

302
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,560
Speaker 2:  it seems like they would be because they're on your face. It's just a really

303
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,720
Speaker 2:  interesting like tone shift in what these things are actually for

304
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,320
Speaker 2:  versus what it seems like they ought to be for because they're on your face.

305
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah, like I will say that you can get some footage that you could

306
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,680
Speaker 4:  never get with your phone. Like You know anyone who's taken a

307
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,600
Speaker 4:  picture of a kid or an animal before knows that they know what a

308
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,320
Speaker 4:  phone is, right? They change their behavior as soon as the phone comes out.

309
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,800
Speaker 4:  This you can like just click a little button and I've got

310
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,320
Speaker 4:  some really cute footage of my kitten just yawning and making

311
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Speaker 4:  biscuits that he would've not done if I had my phone

312
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,080
Speaker 4:  out because he'd be like, oh, phone time for a snack, chomp chomp on the

313
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,800
Speaker 4:  phone camera. But he's not gonna do that because I have my glasses on. Like

314
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,240
Speaker 4:  those are instances where you're like, oh man, this is so cool.

315
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,760
Speaker 4:  And for me, just like this is very, very specific to smartwatch reviewers.

316
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,520
Speaker 4:  Only the next time the video team asked me to take a social video

317
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,400
Speaker 4:  of myself putting on a watch. Hallelujah. Because

318
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,360
Speaker 4:  do You know how hard it is to hold a phone and prop

319
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,080
Speaker 4:  that up and then put on a watch? It's, it's, it's a two

320
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,440
Speaker 4:  handed job, right? So anytime you wanna take like hands free

321
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,800
Speaker 4:  phone footage, it's not every instance, but depending on

322
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,560
Speaker 4:  who you are, there may be a ton of instances where that's really cool.

323
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,400
Speaker 4:  Like maybe you're a musician and you wanna like film yourself playing

324
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,280
Speaker 4:  piano. Like wow, you can do that now instead of having to wear a GoPro on

325
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,960
Speaker 4:  your face that that's what it is. Like instances where you would be like,

326
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,760
Speaker 4:  man, if only I could stick a phone on my head or a GoPro in my head. This

327
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,840
Speaker 4:  does a really good job of replacing that I think.

328
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,040
Speaker 2:  No, I think that that's really interesting. I, I remember, I think it was

329
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,640
Speaker 2:  Anthony Bourdain a bunch of years ago, talked about how much it

330
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,120
Speaker 2:  changed the kind of show he was able to make when he started using iPhones

331
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,080
Speaker 2:  instead of big giant TV cameras. Just like the vibe in

332
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,600
Speaker 2:  the room is different when you have these phones that people are used to

333
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,160
Speaker 2:  being filmed on and kind of understand what they are as opposed to like big

334
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,000
Speaker 2:  ass shoulder mounted cameras. And I feel like there's a world in which

335
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,840
Speaker 2:  the smart glasses kind of go the same way where it's like it just, you're

336
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,600
Speaker 2:  able to feel more intimate and literally get places

337
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,280
Speaker 2:  and shots you couldn't with any other device because there is now nothing

338
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,920
Speaker 2:  between you and the subject.

339
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,400
Speaker 4:  It's very social oriented. It's not like, oh I'm gonna do

340
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,760
Speaker 4:  a YouTube video movie shot on these glasses. It's

341
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,280
Speaker 4:  very like for your social media, there's like things

342
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,920
Speaker 4:  built within the the Meta view app that make it easy to share to

343
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,440
Speaker 4:  Instagram or like WhatsApp, You know all of Meta's

344
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,760
Speaker 4:  services. But it's just very easy to make that transition

345
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,600
Speaker 4:  and like, I don't livestream but I have like tried out the

346
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,520
Speaker 4:  livestream kind of connectivity. It's freaky how fast

347
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,960
Speaker 4:  it, it just recognizes that I've got a pair of these

348
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,960
Speaker 4:  paired, like I just pull up Instagram reels and

349
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,920
Speaker 4:  it can see that it's there and

350
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,520
Speaker 2:  You just like double tap to switch between cameras, right? That's pretty

351
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,640
Speaker 2:  cool.

352
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,840
Speaker 4:  You just, and like I saw that and I was like wow, there's just a type of

353
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,080
Speaker 4:  content creator that's gonna love doing that.

354
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,560
Speaker 4:  That's not me. But also You know it's kind of

355
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,360
Speaker 4:  weird to kind of test that because you're going live in a live stream

356
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,280
Speaker 4:  and then people are just gonna have questions. So that's not a thing I've

357
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,600
Speaker 4:  been able to really explore yet. But just having it there,

358
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,920
Speaker 4:  being able to recognize it without me having to go through a really

359
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,320
Speaker 4:  long setup process that was like, ooh,

360
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,600
Speaker 4:  that's interesting. Where you come up against a wall of

361
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,440
Speaker 4:  like, okay, that's not how people are going to use this is who, who

362
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,240
Speaker 4:  really is using Instagram reels for this type of

363
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,120
Speaker 4:  content. It's TikTok talkers are the ones who are gonna

364
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,160
Speaker 4:  want this type of like livestream capability built within the glasses

365
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,080
Speaker 4:  and it's kind of limited to reels. So that feels

366
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,920
Speaker 4:  like arbitrary ecosystem guarding when you consider, like

367
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,880
Speaker 4:  if you didn't do that, if you worked with TikTok to make it

368
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,040
Speaker 4:  a compatible thing, this would like sell like hotcakes immediately.

369
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,400
Speaker 4:  So

370
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,520
Speaker 2:  I mean, I'm not one tiny bit surprised that Meta is

371
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,280
Speaker 2:  doing that, but it also makes me hope that somebody else comes out and says

372
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,720
Speaker 2:  like we are the content agnostic one. Right? And it's like we, you can,

373
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,760
Speaker 2:  if you could share as easily to like shorts and TikTok and

374
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,360
Speaker 2:  reels and go live on Twitch and YouTube and TikTok and wherever else,

375
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,360
Speaker 2:  that becomes a pretty cool creator tool in a way that there really

376
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,000
Speaker 2:  isn't anything other than phones right now that do that. And I think

377
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,160
Speaker 2:  that could be very cool. But I, I frankly I would've been shocked if Meta

378
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,240
Speaker 2:  had opened this stuff up more than it has. Yeah,

379
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah, absolutely. Like it makes sense. Like people gonna put their

380
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,600
Speaker 4:  ecosystems first always. It's just one of those things where you're like,

381
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,640
Speaker 4:  yeah, but that's not the reality of how content creators work.

382
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,120
Speaker 4:  So that's just one of those things where it's like maybe down the line

383
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,240
Speaker 4:  we'll see that happen. Maybe Beta wants to be the one who

384
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,880
Speaker 4:  makes that particular hardware for everyone to use. So

385
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,120
Speaker 4:  You know, I get it

386
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,280
Speaker 2:  If I know anything it's that someone in the EU is already writing smart

387
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,160
Speaker 2:  glasses interoperability rules. So it's, it's it's gonna happen.

388
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,320
Speaker 2:  What about the, the like headphone replacement piece of this? I think

389
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,320
Speaker 2:  one of the reasons I'm the most excited about these is for audio and

390
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,840
Speaker 2:  calls and microphone stuff. How do these do

391
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,040
Speaker 4:  So I think you sound great when you wear them and you take videos like

392
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,000
Speaker 4:  there is a new microphone in the nose and I thought that was

393
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,840
Speaker 4:  kind of silly at first, but you do really sound a lot more present and

394
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,160
Speaker 4:  clear.

395
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,160
Speaker 2:  It's a really smart place to put a microphone. Actually I had not thought

396
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,000
Speaker 2:  about it until they explained it but like that is such a close place

397
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,760
Speaker 2:  to your mouth and it's such a like they can just plain it straight downwards.

398
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,680
Speaker 2:  Like it's very clever. I was, I had high hopes for it. So, I'm glad It works.

399
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,920
Speaker 4:  I sound so clear in all the videos I took, even if there was wind out, wind

400
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,440
Speaker 4:  outside. That's great. And you, you sound more like the narrator when you

401
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,920
Speaker 4:  do it that way. Hmm. Just because it does record in stereo. So when you put

402
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,720
Speaker 4:  it on and you listen to the videos that you took, you do sound like the

403
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,840
Speaker 4:  main character of your video. Oh

404
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,160
Speaker 5:  Everyone's gonna know I'm recording because I'm gonna be like swooping my

405
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,440
Speaker 5:  bangs to the side is read for audio as what I'm assuming it does and it does

406
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,760
Speaker 5:  it in stereo. Oh wait, when you listen to it you can

407
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,920
Speaker 6:  Like how is the tous silks

408
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,640
Speaker 6:  like still recording? I'm sorry.

409
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,640
Speaker 4:  Like you can tell that you are the narrator and that you are talking and

410
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,600
Speaker 4:  that if you were talking to someone else, they're over there, right? Like

411
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,080
Speaker 4:  you can tell that which I thought was like a very subtle touch.

412
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,640
Speaker 4:  But You know I wore it on the very loud New York subway

413
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,560
Speaker 4:  and on a tram and in various forms of public transit,

414
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,840
Speaker 4:  they're quite loud on these forms of public transit

415
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,400
Speaker 4:  depending on what train line you take. And like on the four five,

416
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,160
Speaker 4:  I could listen and I could drown everybody out. But if you live in New York,

417
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,800
Speaker 4:  You know the four five is a fancy train. It's well maintained. I

418
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,840
Speaker 4:  also took the N R W and it was, it was a

419
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,760
Speaker 4:  lot harder to like listen to my music in that with everything just screeching

420
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,680
Speaker 4:  and being loud. So it, it really depends on the area you're

421
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,360
Speaker 4:  in. Didn didn't have anyone yelling at me like turn

422
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,280
Speaker 4:  down your audio leakage. So on the, on that respect, no one yelled at me.

423
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,240
Speaker 4:  So it can be really hard to hear other people though when you crank

424
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,080
Speaker 4:  it up really loud. But as far as that goes, it's very similar

425
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,200
Speaker 4:  to other smart glasses with audio components. I do think it has

426
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,040
Speaker 4:  good sound quality. Is it the best sound quality for listening to the

427
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,920
Speaker 4:  base heavy tracks of xo? Not really In ear

428
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,560
Speaker 4:  is always gonna be better than that, but it's good enough for my runs. Is

429
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,040
Speaker 4:  it good enough for a race? No, I wouldn't take it in a race. 'cause in the

430
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,920
Speaker 4:  race they blare their own music and that makes for a bad time

431
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,640
Speaker 4:  if you're very music dependent like I am. So that's just kind of how It works

432
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:09,880
Speaker 4:  there.

433
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,160
Speaker 2:  So hit me with some of the caveats. What sucks about these things? Like are

434
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,840
Speaker 2:  were there specific things that drove you nuts about the way that they work?

435
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,000
Speaker 4:  Battery life, You know battery life. Is it it is what they say it is.

436
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,680
Speaker 4:  It's just You know I have bad eyes. I need

437
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,640
Speaker 4:  a vision like help all the time. I need either glasses or my

438
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,440
Speaker 4:  contacts in terms of these You know if

439
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,080
Speaker 4:  they run out of battery while I'm going about my full day trying to use these

440
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,760
Speaker 4:  as my main driver. That's annoying to charge my main seeking

441
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,840
Speaker 4:  device. You can't really use this as your sole pair of

442
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,600
Speaker 4:  glasses. You are going to need a backup pair because this charges

443
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,400
Speaker 4:  within a case. So you can't even like plug yourself into a wire

444
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:55,160
Speaker 4:  while you're working and have that work. Now you have to plug it into the,

445
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,040
Speaker 4:  to the eyeglass case. So you, you can't just use this as your sole

446
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,280
Speaker 4:  pair of glasses and if you get it as sunglasses

447
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,880
Speaker 4:  you really have to think about what situations you're going to be using this

448
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,680
Speaker 4:  in. If you wanna be indoors, it's really not gonna work for you. And then

449
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,400
Speaker 4:  if like me, you have really, really terrible vision.

450
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,280
Speaker 4:  There's a limit as to what prescription glass RayBan says they

451
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,080
Speaker 4:  support. It's negative six to plus four. I fall outside of that.

452
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,800
Speaker 4:  That really sucks for me. It means I have to keep wearing contacts with these

453
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,400
Speaker 4:  and that makes life kind of difficult to manage because You know the

454
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Speaker 4:  thing I think we don't really talk about with smart glasses is that glasses

455
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,280
Speaker 4:  are in medical device. People need them to see and you

456
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,040
Speaker 4:  need to see at all times. So when you add

457
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,840
Speaker 4:  a charging battery component to that, you're saying that this

458
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,200
Speaker 4:  can't be your, your main glasses all the time. You need a backup.

459
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,760
Speaker 4:  And that's very expensive in the United States, not in Korea,

460
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,920
Speaker 4:  which is why my family all goes to Korea for glasses. But you're asking

461
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,040
Speaker 4:  people to spend like 400 to 700 just

462
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,920
Speaker 4:  to have two pairs of these at any given point in time. Which You know I

463
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,000
Speaker 4:  don't, I don't love that. I think that's a major barrier.

464
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah. This is why transition lenses are the future. I know we were on a few

465
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,920
Speaker 2:  episodes ago and Neli, I talked a lot of crap about transition lenses and

466
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,280
Speaker 2:  the number of people who have told us that actually transition lenses are

467
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,240
Speaker 2:  good. I support you, you are my people and I'm sure my dad was one of

468
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,360
Speaker 2:  them.

469
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,720
Speaker 4:  They are absolutely necessary for smart glasses. I don't think the sunglasses,

470
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,400
Speaker 4:  if you wanna wear them in your daily life, sunglasses are not an option.

471
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,400
Speaker 4:  But if you wanna go outside and not have your eyeballs burn off, if

472
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,840
Speaker 4:  because You know eye health is important and UV rays are damaging,

473
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,040
Speaker 4:  then you can't really have the clear glasses all the time. So you really

474
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,920
Speaker 4:  do need transitions if you want these glasses to be on you at

475
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,560
Speaker 4:  all times and to have a camera at all times.

476
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,280
Speaker 2:  So it seems like we're not all the way there. We haven't sort of fully solved

477
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,800
Speaker 2:  these problems. There's a lot of interesting like software stuff left to

478
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,680
Speaker 2:  do, especially I think in the camera. But it does sound like Meta has

479
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,840
Speaker 2:  probably made the most convincing case yet that like there's something

480
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,840
Speaker 2:  here that the camera can be good, the audio stuff

481
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,840
Speaker 2:  can work. They're working on a bunch of AR stuff that I think is gonna get

482
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,720
Speaker 2:  more interesting over time. But it's like Meta wants the gadget of the future

483
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,960
Speaker 2:  to look a lot like the thing that you're wearing on your head right now,

484
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,040
Speaker 2:  right? Like it's a huge amount of technological work to get there. But I

485
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,920
Speaker 2:  think I'm at least You know 1% more convinced

486
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,720
Speaker 2:  than I was before these that that's plausible.

487
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So what I'm gonna say is I have tested a lot of smart glasses in the

488
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,080
Speaker 4:  past and I've been made fun of consistently and

489
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,000
Speaker 4:  constantly while I wear them. This is the first time where

490
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,280
Speaker 4:  You know I've had people go like, oh hell no, this is a privacy nightmare.

491
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,200
Speaker 4:  Get away from me. But I've had way more people go like, oh my god, that's

492
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,960
Speaker 4:  so cool. I'm buying them. Where do I pre-order? And

493
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,040
Speaker 4:  that I think is huge 'cause I'll be, I'll be real.

494
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,280
Speaker 4:  My husband is the biggest V humble. He keeps

495
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,000
Speaker 4:  me humble. Yeah, because he's always like, that looks stupid. That's dumb.

496
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,200
Speaker 4:  Why would anyone have that?

497
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,720
Speaker 2:  Why do you wear five watches at a time? Yeah.

498
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I have to argue my thesis. But this is the first like pair of smart

499
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,840
Speaker 4:  glasses that I've ever worn that they've gone, holy crap, I'm gonna

500
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,680
Speaker 4:  order my own pair. They're like, they are waiting to order these and

501
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,400
Speaker 4:  so they can have their prescription and they're like super excited about

502
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,240
Speaker 4:  it. That's so weird to me. One Alex Crans had

503
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,200
Speaker 4:  a field day at the office stealing them from me taking the world's

504
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,040
Speaker 4:  blurt photos just running

505
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,240
Speaker 2:  Around. They're so bad.

506
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Speaker 4:  They're so bad. But she ran around the office with these like a child going,

507
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,680
Speaker 4:  oh my god, I'm gonna buy a pair. These are so cool. And it was

508
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,520
Speaker 4:  just like, oh my god, I've never seen someone that excited

509
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,360
Speaker 4:  about a pair of smart glasses I've ever tested in my life. That's

510
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,040
Speaker 4:  something to me. You know Alex

511
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,160
Speaker 2:  Kranz taking bad pictures is the first sign of any, any good gadget category.

512
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah, the oh my god, just so many nostril shots of her on my

513
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,480
Speaker 4:  phone.

514
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,320
Speaker 2:  All, right. V thank you. I want to talk about these more 'cause the, the

515
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,040
Speaker 2:  echo frames are coming out. There's more to do. I think this is like the

516
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,720
Speaker 2:  next phase of these I think is gonna be really interesting. So we're gonna

517
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,600
Speaker 2:  have to, we're gonna have to keep in touch on, on all the smart glasses stuff.

518
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,720
Speaker 4:  Absolutely. We gotta make the Eggsy spy dream a reality. Please,

519
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,960
Speaker 2:  From from your mouth to God's ears. All, right? We gotta take a break, but

520
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Speaker 2:  then we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk about right to repair V.

521
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,240
Speaker 2:  Thank you. We'll be right back.

522
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,010
Speaker 3:  It's not just sci-fi anymore. Virtual reality for work is here.

523
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,490
Speaker 3:  Mixed reality for work is here and companies everywhere are using them both

524
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,410
Speaker 3:  to transform how they operate. Architects are able to walk through

525
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,330
Speaker 3:  buildings and mixed reality before they're even built. Coworkers from

526
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,770
Speaker 3:  opposite ends of the earth are working shoulder to shoulder in VR spaces

527
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:45,290
Speaker 3:  and all sorts of workers from pilots to underwater welders are getting trained

528
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,370
Speaker 3:  in a virtual environment that's safer and more cost effective.

529
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,730
Speaker 3:  That's metaphor work, giving you VR and Mr Tech to work

530
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,490
Speaker 3:  smarter, closer, safer together. Learn

Speaker 3:  more at for work dot Meta dot com

532
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,130
Speaker 2:  All. right. We're back before we get to our next segment. Actually one more

533
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,090
Speaker 2:  quick thing on smart glasses. One thing that's not on the Meta

534
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,410
Speaker 2:  Smartt glasses, at least not yet, is augmented reality.

535
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,450
Speaker 2:  When Meta launched these glasses a few weeks ago, mark Zuckerberg said that

536
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,890
Speaker 2:  in a software update next year, the glasses will turn multimodal. That's

537
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,290
Speaker 2:  the word he used. Here's the way he described how it'll work.

538
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,450
Speaker 7:  So the glasses are gonna be able to understand what you're looking at when

539
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,010
Speaker 7:  you ask them questions. So if you wanna know what the building is that you're

540
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,050
Speaker 7:  standing in front of, or if you want to translate a sign that's

541
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:39,720
Speaker 7:  in front of you to know what it's saying, or if you need help fixing this

542
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,960
Speaker 7:  sad leaky faucet, you can basically just talk to Meta AI and look

543
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,320
Speaker 7:  at it and it'll walk you through it step by step how to do it. So You know

544
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,200
Speaker 7:  I, I think that smart glasses are gonna be an important platform for the

545
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Speaker 7:  future. You know not only because they're the natural way to put

546
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,880
Speaker 7:  holograms in the world. So we can put digital objects You know in our physical

547
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,360
Speaker 7:  space, but also because if you think about it, smart glasses are the ideal

548
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,240
Speaker 7:  form factor for you to let an AI assistant see what you're seeing

549
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,360
Speaker 7:  and hear what you're hearing.

550
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,560
Speaker 2:  The smart glasses obviously don't have a screen, so they'll use your phone

551
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,960
Speaker 2:  as the display for all that stuff. It's basically a companion to your glasses.

552
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,400
Speaker 2:  I actually think that's super clever and a smart way to do AR glasses before

553
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,320
Speaker 2:  it's possible to put all the hardware and software we're gonna need into

554
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,680
Speaker 2:  a decent looking pair of glasses. But the race to watch out for is between

555
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,480
Speaker 2:  that approach and the one taken by a company like X Reil, which used to be

556
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,600
Speaker 2:  called N Reel, you might have heard of it back then, but is now called Xra.

557
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,400
Speaker 2:  For reasons I don't totally understand, doesn't really matter. I've been

558
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,000
Speaker 2:  toying around with X reel's, latest glasses. They're called the air and they're

559
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,680
Speaker 2:  essentially the opposite of the Metas Smartt glasses. They're not smart at

560
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,600
Speaker 2:  all, but they do have a display right now. They're basically a projector

561
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,760
Speaker 2:  on your face. You can plug them into your phone or your game console and

562
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,640
Speaker 2:  see your video on a big virtual screen in front of your eyes. You can

563
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,080
Speaker 2:  plug them into your computer and use them for virtual desktops. They don't

564
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,040
Speaker 2:  do much of anything by themselves. They're just a screen you can put on your

565
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,720
Speaker 2:  face. They're not the most stylish classes. They have displays underneath

566
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,680
Speaker 2:  each lens. So they're big and bulky, but they work pretty well actually.

567
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,320
Speaker 2:  And I've really enjoyed using them for watching shows that I would otherwise

568
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,240
Speaker 2:  stare at on the tiny screen on my phone or even playing games.

569
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,680
Speaker 2:  I plugged mine into my switch and I've been using it that way. It's very

570
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,560
Speaker 2:  cool. So that's really the battle I think. Can someone like X

571
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,640
Speaker 2:  reel add the smarts and the looks faster than Meta can figure out how

572
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,480
Speaker 2:  to get a display into these glasses? I don't know who I'd

573
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,240
Speaker 2:  bet on there. I think probably Meta, but we'll see. And in the

574
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,040
Speaker 2:  meantime, which of those approaches is actually useful to the most

575
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,880
Speaker 2:  people? Is it meta's AI and camera thing or

576
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,640
Speaker 2:  is it having a display on your face? I don't know, but I am absolutely

577
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,600
Speaker 2:  convinced that Meta in particular is ready to see this all the way

578
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,280
Speaker 2:  through. Alex Heath on our team has done some really good reporting on the

579
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,840
Speaker 2:  roadmap. The roadmap is long. Meta is in this for the long haul.

580
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,600
Speaker 2:  It's gonna be super interesting to watch, especially over the next couple

581
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,120
Speaker 2:  of years as everybody tries to figure out what anybody actually wants from

582
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,000
Speaker 2:  these classes. Anyway, sorry. Brief diversion. Let's get

583
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,880
Speaker 2:  to the next segment. Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into

584
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,600
Speaker 2:  law a bill called the Right to Repair Act, which is pretty much what it sounds

585
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,520
Speaker 2:  like. It makes it official that gadgets should be repairable, but it does

586
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,480
Speaker 2:  so in some important specific ways under the law for any electronic

587
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,480
Speaker 2:  made and sold after July 1st, 2021 and costing more than

588
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,080
Speaker 2:  $50. The manufacturer of that device has to make tools, parts,

589
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,480
Speaker 2:  software and documentation available for people who want to repair those

590
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,840
Speaker 2:  devices. Some of these devices you'll be able to repair yourself, others

591
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,240
Speaker 2:  you'll take to a repair shop. And those repair shops, this is important,

592
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,240
Speaker 2:  will be far more equipped and enabled to actually help you than before.

593
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,480
Speaker 2:  This law is a huge win for the right to repair movement, which has been steadily

594
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,600
Speaker 2:  fighting for laws like this all over the US and around the world. So to

595
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,440
Speaker 2:  help figure out what it means And, what it means for how we buy

596
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,480
Speaker 2:  and use and fix our electronics, I grab two people who know very well.

597
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,840
Speaker 2:  The, Verge of Sean, Hollister and iFixit, C E o, Kyle, Wiens,

598
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,480
Speaker 2:  Sean Hollister. Hello.

599
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,840
Speaker 8:  Hi. That's me.

600
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,800
Speaker 2:  Kyle Wiens, Welcome. back to The Vergecast.

601
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,160
Speaker 9:  Hey, thanks for having me back.

602
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,440
Speaker 2:  So there's a lot of right to repair stuff to talk about, but first

603
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,440
Speaker 2:  let's just kind of catch up on where we are. And it seems like this bill

604
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,720
Speaker 2:  that was just signed into California law is like if you, if you were to pick

605
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,480
Speaker 2:  a moment that you won at right to repair, it feels like this would not be

606
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,280
Speaker 2:  a bad one to choose. Is that, is that fair to say? This

607
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,160
Speaker 9:  Is far and away the most broad sweeping bill that we've had. And, and

608
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,800
Speaker 9:  the, the retroactivity is helpful. The, the broad

609
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,360
Speaker 9:  applicability to a variety of products. California had an

610
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,480
Speaker 9:  existing law that we modified, I don't know most people know this, but California

611
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,200
Speaker 9:  has this law called the Beverly Song Warranty Act. That's the best consumer

612
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,280
Speaker 9:  protection law in the world. Really?

613
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,880
Speaker 8:  The Lemon law, right? Yeah.

614
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,680
Speaker 9:  It's, it's the lemon law and it says that you have to be able to get your

615
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,920
Speaker 9:  product service for seven years, which is longer than even Europe and other

616
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,560
Speaker 9:  places. So the right to repair law kind of modifies and improves that lemon

617
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,440
Speaker 9:  law. When

618
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,920
Speaker 8:  We, when we think about the lemon law, most people think of this as like

619
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,520
Speaker 8:  the thing that protects you from buying a shitty used car though, right?

620
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,160
Speaker 8:  People don't know that it has anything to do with their other electronics.

621
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,520
Speaker 9:  Right? But so like in California, apple will repair products for seven years.

622
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,320
Speaker 9:  They don't do that anywhere else in the world. So if you have a six year

623
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,520
Speaker 9:  old MacBook and you walk into an Apple store in New York City, they won't

624
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,560
Speaker 9:  work on it. But if you go into the Apple Store in LA, they will.

625
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,880
Speaker 2:  That's wild. I I genuinely did not know that Apple

626
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,720
Speaker 9:  Has, they have what they call vintage and obsolete and it's in five and seven

627
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,960
Speaker 9:  years and at five years they cut the world off except California and then

628
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,200
Speaker 9:  at seven years they cut California off. Wow. And I think that goes back to

629
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,000
Speaker 9:  just the broader question, like how long should things last? When we talk

630
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,840
Speaker 9:  about right to repair You know you're buying a new thing or The Verge is

631
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,760
Speaker 9:  recommending a product. Well cool, I'm gonna buy it. How long am I gonna

632
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,240
Speaker 9:  use those new AirPods for?

633
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:52,080
Speaker 2:  Well that's actually the thing I was gonna ask 'cause you were involved in

634
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,240
Speaker 2:  this bill from the beginning as far as I understand, right? Like you, you,

635
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,440
Speaker 2:  you were an active participant in crafting this legislation. That's one of

636
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,840
Speaker 2:  the things you have to figure out, right? What is a reasonable amount of

637
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,560
Speaker 2:  time to expect a gadget to work?

638
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,560
Speaker 9:  Absolutely.

639
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,680
Speaker 2:  Seven years seems to be the magic number. Why seven years? Well,

640
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,040
Speaker 9:  Seven years is the default that we'd like to do. Now I should mention California's

641
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,480
Speaker 9:  law, the, the right to repair law is 2021 devices and forward,

642
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,520
Speaker 9:  but that 2021 is kinda a one time date. So the right to repair law over time

643
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,480
Speaker 9:  will get better and better. The kind of compromise we negotiated with

644
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,360
Speaker 9:  Apple was 2021, which is I fund 12 and forward.

645
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,640
Speaker 2:  So why seven years though? Is that like why not, why not 10 or five? Like

646
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,880
Speaker 2:  what, what was it about seven years.

647
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,800
Speaker 9:  Seven years was in the, in the Lemon law historically. So that's kind of,

648
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,360
Speaker 9:  and it, it You know, tailored toward You know electronics type products.

649
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,000
Speaker 9:  I don't think seven years is long enough. I think that's a good place to

650
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,880
Speaker 9:  start. But like I have a 2012 MacBook Pro that still works just fine.

651
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,320
Speaker 9:  So we're going in 11 years on that one. I think we should be talking

652
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,880
Speaker 9:  15 plus years, but you gotta start somewhere.

653
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,880
Speaker 8:  So the existing California law was, it requires the

654
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,120
Speaker 8:  manufacturers to keep the parts around. It requires them to maybe repair

655
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,920
Speaker 8:  them for you if you go get to the repair. You still had to pay them for that

656
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,880
Speaker 8:  repair though. And they didn't necessarily, like Apple didn't necessarily

657
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,720
Speaker 8:  have any obligation to send parts to you to that

658
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,800
Speaker 8:  you could repair it yourself. Right? Right.

659
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,680
Speaker 9:  Yeah. That's, that's the big difference. The big change that we're, we're

660
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,400
Speaker 9:  doing with these right to repair bills is it says manufacturers have to make

661
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,120
Speaker 9:  the same parts tools and information available to consumers

662
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,880
Speaker 9:  and independent repair shops that they have in the Apple store.

663
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,040
Speaker 2:  So walk me through that though, because there's a, there's a letter of that

664
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,800
Speaker 2:  law and there's a spirit of that law and I feel like the spirit of that law

665
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,520
Speaker 2:  is pretty straightforward, right? There are a bunch of tools, there are ways

666
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,440
Speaker 2:  to make these things more fixable. I should have the same access that somebody

667
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,240
Speaker 2:  at Apple does. The letter of that law says that Apple can do to Sean what

668
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,920
Speaker 2:  it did do to Sean, which is ship him like 9,000 pounds

669
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,280
Speaker 2:  worth of equipment in a bunch of pelican cases and say, here you go

670
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,400
Speaker 2:  jackass. You figure it out. And that's like, that's better than nothing.

671
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,920
Speaker 2:  There are tools that exist that you can get access to that you can fix stuff,

672
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,920
Speaker 2:  but there's so much gray between the tools

673
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,960
Speaker 2:  exist and you can have them to like, it is easy and doable for a

674
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,080
Speaker 2:  regular human to fix things. Do we just have to be comfortable in that gray

675
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,320
Speaker 2:  space for a while here

676
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,760
Speaker 9:  Well step back and say, what are we trying to achieve? We're trying to have

677
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,720
Speaker 9:  a robust repair marketplace where products get fixed where they last a long

678
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,920
Speaker 9:  time, where you have local repair shops in their neighborhoods that can fix

679
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:22,000
Speaker 9:  everything that all the gadgets in our lives where You know, maybe we

680
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,960
Speaker 9:  used to have TV repair shops in our neighborhoods. We don't anymore. Maybe

681
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,200
Speaker 9:  those could come back. So it's what we're trying to get at. And then with

682
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,200
Speaker 9:  legislation, you try to approximate You know pointed fixes to try to

683
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,080
Speaker 9:  nudge the world back in that direction. And then the companies can

684
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,480
Speaker 9:  decide if they wanna wholeheartedly embrace that and really work with you

685
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,280
Speaker 9:  to try to address the systemic causes that have resulted in the

686
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,080
Speaker 9:  kind of the repair system breaking down. Or they can engage

687
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,760
Speaker 9:  in You know this sort of compliance with a

688
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,960
Speaker 9:  maximal amount of resistance, which is has been Apple's approach so far.

689
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,520
Speaker 2:  Yes. Rates of repair shenanigans. Yeah.

690
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,760
Speaker 9:  I I call it malicious compliance. Yeah, exactly.

691
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,840
Speaker 8:  Do you think like California has just put every manufacturer on

692
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,760
Speaker 8:  notice for, for all kinds of electronics, not just like laptops and tablets

693
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,320
Speaker 8:  and phones, but like anything over a certain value, right?

694
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,200
Speaker 9:  Anything over 50 bucks. Are

695
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,040
Speaker 8:  You expecting in general an explosion in parts availability for

696
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,920
Speaker 8:  these things? Or do you think there's gonna be explosion in people attempting

697
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,960
Speaker 8:  to sue companies for not making those parts available?

698
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,880
Speaker 9:  That's a good question. I would say You know, we're, we're helping some companies,

699
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,920
Speaker 9:  but I'm kind of shocked at the silence that we're seeing from the middle

700
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,600
Speaker 9:  market from most companies. I mean obviously you've got You know Samsung

701
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,440
Speaker 9:  and Apple and Logitech and some of these companies out in front that,

702
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:40,280
Speaker 9:  that they're paying attention. But the vast majority, I mean, right, I mean

703
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,080
Speaker 9:  there's, there's thousands of these companies and I haven't, I've only seen

704
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,480
Speaker 9:  a handful of parts program announcements, So, I think, I think companies

705
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,240
Speaker 9:  are behind the eight ball and, and need to get on it. You got told January

706
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,680
Speaker 9:  one,

707
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,520
Speaker 2:  How much of this are you trying to do? Like there's a version of this where

708
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,560
Speaker 2:  you could be sitting here thinking like, I just want a gigantic business

709
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,240
Speaker 2:  opportunity for iFixit. I'm going to corner the market on

710
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:04,440
Speaker 2:  human usable repair tools. And now that these things are available in more

711
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,120
Speaker 2:  places, like I'm gonna be a billionaire, my sense would be this is probably

712
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,000
Speaker 2:  too big for iFixit to try and monopolize, but like,

713
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,800
Speaker 2:  are you sitting at this, looking at this as a huge business opportunity for

714
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:15,880
Speaker 2:  you?

715
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,080
Speaker 9:  Well, the debate when we were working at Rachel Perry was like, are we gonna

716
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,680
Speaker 9:  pass laws that put iFixit outta business? Because the idea is the companies

717
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,920
Speaker 9:  need to provide parts, tools, and information on, on their site. Like that's

718
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,760
Speaker 9:  what iFixit does. That's how we've always, right. We we built an alternative

719
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,520
Speaker 9:  ecosystem for Apple products. You can go and get all that from I Fixit now

720
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,040
Speaker 9:  in addition to the i Fixit service manual. You can get Apple and you can

721
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,680
Speaker 9:  get a, a service manual for The, iPhone, So I. Think that's pretty

722
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,480
Speaker 2:  Cool. And just So I understand Apple partnering with I Fixit to sell

723
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,280
Speaker 2:  stuff is not good enough under this law. Is that like Apple has to

724
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,360
Speaker 2:  offer it itself? Is that right? It

725
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,200
Speaker 9:  Would be. It would be. I mean that's how, that's how Samsung and others are

726
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,720
Speaker 9:  complying. I mean they, they have to provide a link to where to go to get

727
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,400
Speaker 9:  it. So if you, if you provide it on iFixit, that would meet the need. Some

728
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,160
Speaker 9:  companies like Samsung is purely going through us. Others like Microsoft

729
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,360
Speaker 9:  is selling parts directly, which is great. I think that's fantastic. That's

730
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,640
Speaker 9:  what we've been asking for all along. So it's really cool to see it starting

731
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,040
Speaker 9:  to happen.

732
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,840
Speaker 8:  Have you gotten an influx of, of people asking you about this? I mean, you've

733
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,320
Speaker 8:  already got Google and Samsung and Valve like very

734
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,520
Speaker 8:  publicly. We've written about it. Other publications have written this is

735
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,400
Speaker 8:  where do you go to get your parts for these devices? Are

736
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,880
Speaker 8:  other manufacturers contacting you and saying Yes, do that for me too?

737
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,120
Speaker 9:  We have some companies that we're working with absolutely. And, and we're

738
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,040
Speaker 9:  we're ready to go to, to help more. But like I said, I I'm surprised we're

739
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,400
Speaker 9:  not hearing from more You know, like pick a random company like, like Bose,

740
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,120
Speaker 9:  right? They, they make a lot of products. They're over ear headphones. They're

741
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,000
Speaker 9:  sold in the every airport. And these batteries were out there after a couple

742
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,960
Speaker 9:  years and bozo no strategy. We're not talking to them. They don't have parts

743
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,520
Speaker 9:  available for the, their quiet comfort headphones. I don't, I mean, they

744
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,840
Speaker 9:  have to do something and, and I would say that's the default for almost all

745
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,280
Speaker 9:  companies. So it's, it's more the exception than the rule that they're talking

746
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,200
Speaker 9:  to us and working with us.

747
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,840
Speaker 2:  I'm curious what you've heard from the companies you've been negotiating

748
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,840
Speaker 2:  with us on this front. 'cause I think about even a company like Apple's probably

749
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,040
Speaker 2:  an easy one to think about, right? Because I think making a MacBook more

750
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,880
Speaker 2:  repairable, pretty straightforward, like not easy, but doable. Like

751
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,680
Speaker 2:  we've, we know what a repairable laptop looks like, one where you can open

752
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,760
Speaker 2:  it up and put in a new battery, right? Like we know what that looks like.

753
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,760
Speaker 2:  Phone less so, but still sort of doable. But like you mentioned

754
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,520
Speaker 2:  AirPods and I'm trying to imagine if I'm Apple, how I

755
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:28,160
Speaker 2:  literally, how I make that tiny little integrated thing with all the stuff

756
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,120
Speaker 2:  in it in a way that complies with these laws. What have you heard

757
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,680
Speaker 2:  from the folks who are trying to do these, especially like You know,

758
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,520
Speaker 2:  smaller wearable things. Like are folks throwing at you saying we can't do

759
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,680
Speaker 2:  the thing that you're asking us to do?

760
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,520
Speaker 9:  No, it's totally doable. I've, I've talked with, I mean So I for the, the

761
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,320
Speaker 9:  Air Pods. I would point to the Samsung Galaxy Buds, which I think The Verge

762
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,360
Speaker 9:  scored. I basically identically did the AirPods and said the sound quality's

763
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,120
Speaker 9:  just as good. So the the galaxy buds you can pop open and swap out the battery

764
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,200
Speaker 9:  easy and and they're like 25 bucks for a set of new batteries. Form 'em.

765
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,960
Speaker 9:  It's great. We sell 'em, you can get them elsewhere. You just pop 'em open,

766
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,040
Speaker 9:  there's a gasket and that's how they all should be. So no, I don't, I don't

767
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,520
Speaker 9:  really accept that you can't make these things fixable. It's just a matter

768
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,320
Speaker 9:  of effort. When we got the Apple Watch, we, we partnered with

769
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,280
Speaker 9:  a watchmaker, a local watchmaker, and we took it apart with him and, and

770
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,400
Speaker 9:  he was just aghast. He's like, are you kidding me? This is the most shittily

771
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,880
Speaker 9:  designed product I've ever seen. And, and the, the

772
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,120
Speaker 9:  architecture hasn't changed. He's like, let's, let's take apart a Rolex and

773
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,200
Speaker 9:  let's look at how you really do this and, and you can seal these things.

774
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,840
Speaker 9:  You can have gaskets and, and the form factor is, is similar, the sizes are

775
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,000
Speaker 9:  similar. These are very small components, but they can be repairable. So

776
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,600
Speaker 9:  there are shortcuts that we take in mass manufacturing these things. But

777
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,480
Speaker 9:  there are paths. So when we, we do a lot of consulting with manufacturers

778
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,440
Speaker 9:  where we, we You know, give them feedback and we also kind of teach them

779
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,400
Speaker 9:  design for repairability practices. And our point is

780
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,560
Speaker 9:  consistently like we can innovate our way into the future here. We can come

781
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,480
Speaker 9:  up with new innovative technologies that make repairing products at,

782
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,640
Speaker 9:  at scale, at the cost that we need to hit possible.

783
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,560
Speaker 8:  How concerned are you with easily repairable versus

784
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,440
Speaker 8:  You know repairable with a lot of knowledge and the parts

785
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,360
Speaker 8:  available because I just watched an amazing, amazing tear down

786
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,600
Speaker 8:  by I fixit of the Meta Quest three and I watched that tear

787
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,560
Speaker 8:  down and I said, wow, that is a tremendous number of screws, 50 screws to

788
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,400
Speaker 8:  get to the battery. All these layers of circuit boards, ribbon cables,

789
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,760
Speaker 8:  all this stuff. I looked at that video and I was of two minds about it. One,

790
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,160
Speaker 8:  oh my god, there's so many layers. Do there really need to be that many layers,

791
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,960
Speaker 8:  that many screws. But the other side of my mind was every one of those steps

792
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,120
Speaker 8:  seems easy. It's just a lot of them. I could do that

793
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,400
Speaker 8:  myself at home. No problem. Yeah,

794
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,520
Speaker 9:  As long as there's documentation you can do it. We just published our repair

795
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,600
Speaker 9:  manual for the new Pixel fold. It's in depth, it's, it's like

796
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,600
Speaker 9:  126 steps to get to the battery. So I'm not gonna

797
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Speaker 9:  recommend that be the first electronics repair you ever try. It's kind of

798
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,320
Speaker 9:  bordering on the edge of possible. I I I think it is possible we're selling

799
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,880
Speaker 9:  a repair kit for it, but I don't expect very many people to take us up on

800
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,040
Speaker 9:  it. You get that with kind of new technologies where

801
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,920
Speaker 9:  there's a lot of complexity. We've been taking, we've taken apart pretty

802
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,600
Speaker 9:  much every VR headset since the Oculus just 'cause I'm fascinated by the

803
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,360
Speaker 9:  category. Clearly it's some element of the future and, and the mechanical

804
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,920
Speaker 9:  design is really interesting and the sensors, and over time

805
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,160
Speaker 9:  you end up with consolidation, you simplify things down. I mean the, the

806
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,040
Speaker 9:  Apple watch You know system on, on chip is they took all the discreet

807
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,960
Speaker 9:  ics and they just bundle 'em together into one silicon package and there

808
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,840
Speaker 9:  is no more visible complexity for a fixer anymore. So you'll get there with

809
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,360
Speaker 9:  the optics on these, on these VE headsets over time.

810
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think one interesting example of that tension that you're

811
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,000
Speaker 2:  describing Sean is, is I think like you, you look at the new surface

812
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:46,520
Speaker 2:  stuff from Microsoft versus like the framework 13. Right. And the,

813
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,760
Speaker 2:  the framework stuff, Sean, which I'm, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on

814
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,800
Speaker 2:  because you've spent a lot of time with these things is, I mean it is designed

815
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,920
Speaker 2:  for a regular person to take it apart and put it together, right? Like that

816
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,640
Speaker 2:  is the point. You should be able to unscrew a thing, pull a thing out, put

817
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,920
Speaker 2:  it back in, screw it back in and you're done. Like that is, that is a sort

818
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,400
Speaker 2:  of end state of right to repair that I think is really interesting. The surface

819
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:10,440
Speaker 2:  stuff is designed sort of deliberately to be harder to do

820
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,680
Speaker 2:  than that. They're trying to find a middle ground between, like you can still

821
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,880
Speaker 2:  get at it, but it's not going to be as simple, which gives us certain

822
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,320
Speaker 2:  affordances that we can have in design and materials and all that stuff.

823
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,720
Speaker 2:  Is it good that we have both of those approaches? Should we all aspire for

824
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,880
Speaker 2:  every gadget to be like the framework where I can just yank a thing out and

825
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,920
Speaker 2:  put another thing back in? Like where do you feel like we should land here?

826
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,400
Speaker 8:  From my perspective, what the companies tend to argue is they tend to

827
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,320
Speaker 8:  argue we get better component density when we don't make

828
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,160
Speaker 8:  things upgradable, modular repairable. And I do think

829
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,360
Speaker 8:  there's, there's, there's definitely a, a gap between something that's simply

830
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,360
Speaker 8:  repairable versus consumer upgradable, like a framework product where

831
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,720
Speaker 8:  everything is its own little module and you can put them in, there's been

832
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,240
Speaker 8:  many, many, many laptops that have had modular parts

833
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,200
Speaker 8:  technically in them, but making them end user, I pull a piece out,

834
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,320
Speaker 8:  I stick another piece in exactly where that went within You know two minutes

835
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:07,720
Speaker 8:  flat and I have a new G P U. That's definitely something new and different

836
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,120
Speaker 8:  and, and, and framework should be applauded for that. But to your question,

837
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,000
Speaker 8:  to your question like that density is less with

838
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,480
Speaker 8:  a framework than it's with a surface. They cram a little bit more into a

839
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,400
Speaker 8:  tighter space in the surface. And I don't think that

840
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,320
Speaker 8:  is enough justification from my perspective. I want the device that

841
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,240
Speaker 8:  is upgradable year after year and modular and eminently repairable.

842
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,480
Speaker 8:  But I can see why they come at it from that perspective and I can see why

843
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,320
Speaker 8:  they might be angry that the laws say, well do we have to redesign

844
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,520
Speaker 8:  our products and think how we're doing our products differently in order

845
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,560
Speaker 8:  to meet the goals of this law? I'd love to hear what Kyle has to

846
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:44,960
Speaker 8:  say about that.

847
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,040
Speaker 9:  Well I would note the retro repair laws in the US don't address design at

848
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,840
Speaker 9:  all. So the companies can continue to design products however they, they

849
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,840
Speaker 9:  are, it just says if you have a repair network for your products, you have

850
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,360
Speaker 9:  to make that competitive. So it's really angling on that competition. You

851
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,760
Speaker 9:  can't have a repair monopoly on your product is what the ca California and

852
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,640
Speaker 9:  these other laws are are tackling in Europe. They're more interested in

853
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,080
Speaker 9:  in mandating device design and banning lightning ports,

854
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,760
Speaker 9:  which You know we could argue about that. But they did it. It was effective.

855
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,520
Speaker 9:  Yep, it worked. Here we are, I've got U S B C port on my iPhone.

856
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,400
Speaker 9:  That's cool. And they're gonna do the same thing with removable batteries

857
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,200
Speaker 9:  on smartphones. They're gonna mandate removable batteries. Again, if you're

858
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,920
Speaker 9:  gonna pick a place to draw a line, I think consumables are a pretty good

859
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,260
Speaker 9:  place to draw a line. They're not saying you can upgrade the ram in in your

860
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,040
Speaker 9:  smartphone, they're just saying the smartphone can't stop working when the

861
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,000
Speaker 9:  You know the most fragile chemically wearing component inside it

862
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,520
Speaker 9:  fails. Which seems like a good, good initial line to draw.

863
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,640
Speaker 2:  Was it intentional to not think about design? 'cause I was, I was thinking

864
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,160
Speaker 2:  about Sean as you were talking. The difference between this and the U S B

865
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,640
Speaker 2:  C thing where they are like that is a proactive decision. They're like this

866
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,720
Speaker 2:  is what your thing is going to do. And the EU is pushing on a lot of that.

867
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,240
Speaker 2:  Right? Even some of the stuff they're doing with messaging apps like mandating

868
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,400
Speaker 2:  that they be interoperable like they are telling people what their products

869
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,320
Speaker 2:  will do and how they will work. And so far in the US the right

870
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,240
Speaker 2:  to repair stuff has not done that. Like it just seems like it's, it's

871
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,760
Speaker 2:  truly poking a bear if you start to tell these companies what they have to

872
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,120
Speaker 2:  do. And it's, it's a minor miracle the EU got as far as it did.

873
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:13,280
Speaker 9:  Yeah, well absolutely. I mean it's interesting that we got so much fight

874
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,080
Speaker 9:  against the right to bear laws as they are. 'cause they're really pretty

875
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,160
Speaker 9:  darn minor. I mean, you saw what Apple had to do to comply. Like it's not,

876
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,360
Speaker 9:  it's not a big tweak, it's just a subtle tweak. Now they, they've fought

877
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,240
Speaker 9:  against us for over 10 years just on a subtle tweak. So we,

878
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,040
Speaker 9:  we decided to focus on, on what was achievable. We talk about

879
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,120
Speaker 9:  in politics, we talk about the Overton window, which is the window of, of

880
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,040
Speaker 9:  what pol politicians can like plausibly do. Politician can't go

881
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,280
Speaker 9:  out and You know do something totally crazy. The society would never put

882
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:40,880
Speaker 9:  up with

883
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,640
Speaker 2:  Debatable.

884
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,760
Speaker 9:  We elect them and then they do the things that are kind of within the scope

885
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,240
Speaker 9:  of what is reasonable, right? So we picked something that was within the

886
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,960
Speaker 9:  scope of, of something that was pretty reasonable. It was really important

887
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,320
Speaker 9:  to us to have bipartisan legislation. It passed almost

888
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:58,240
Speaker 9:  unanimously in California and You know overwhelmingly in in

889
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,000
Speaker 9:  New York and Minnesota and other places. So we, we've been focused on, on

890
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,680
Speaker 9:  bipartisan legislation that that can be consensus based, which means that

891
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,640
Speaker 9:  there'll be laws that will stand the test of time. They won't be easy to

892
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,480
Speaker 9:  overturn. Yeah,

893
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,160
Speaker 2:  I remember you and I talked a bunch of years ago about kind of the, you you

894
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,560
Speaker 2:  were in the like we haven't yet won one, but we're about to win one

895
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:20,480
Speaker 2:  phase of the right to repair fight that there had been a bunch of, almost

896
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,320
Speaker 2:  a bunch of near misses and you're like, it is only a matter of time until

897
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,120
Speaker 2:  we tip over this line and and your thought was we really just need

898
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,520
Speaker 2:  one or two. We don't have to get all 50 states and the federal government

899
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,720
Speaker 2:  to pass a right to repair bill. We need a couple of significant ones to make

900
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,400
Speaker 2:  it so hard for companies to make a million different

901
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,440
Speaker 2:  versions of their gadgets that they're all just gonna play ball. Yeah. And

902
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,240
Speaker 2:  it's gonna work

903
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,920
Speaker 9:  Absolutely. With the California law, we're, we're up to 20% of the US

904
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,400
Speaker 9:  population has passed the right to repair line. I've

905
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,000
Speaker 8:  Heard for many years. You know as California goes, so goes the nation. But

906
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,560
Speaker 8:  then on on the other side of this call, you're telling me that an Apple

907
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,440
Speaker 8:  laptop is handled differently for repairs in California as it is in

908
00:52:59,440 --> 00:52:59,760
Speaker 8:  New York.

909
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:04,000
Speaker 9:  Well be because that that is a business practice and that the, they

910
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,960
Speaker 9:  were able to kind of drive, drive a wedge there. I'm hopeful that You

911
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,120
Speaker 9:  know when, when it comes to things like you have to make the repair manual

912
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,200
Speaker 9:  online to sell your product in California, whether are they gonna like G

913
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,880
Speaker 9:  O I P locate people and only make the repair manuals available in

914
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,360
Speaker 9:  California? No, they're doing it nationwide. And and I think you'll, you'll

915
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,120
Speaker 9:  continue to see that

916
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,400
Speaker 2:  And I would assume part of it is like honestly I would not put it out of

917
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,960
Speaker 2:  the realm of possibility that Apple would geo IP fence the

918
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,760
Speaker 2:  accent. Like I really wouldn't. But the good news of it is that

919
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,680
Speaker 2:  stuff now exists in the world for regular like you, you

920
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,680
Speaker 2:  don't have to hack Apple's servers to get that stuff. It just, once it's

921
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,160
Speaker 2:  out there, it's gonna be out there. Right? And as soon as the version of

922
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,080
Speaker 2:  that manual and the existence of those parts is seen by some portion of

923
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,480
Speaker 2:  the broader internet, it becomes too big to hide in a way that I think works

924
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,360
Speaker 2:  for the movement that you're talking about, right?

925
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:56,040
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I mean getting this information out there, having Samsung say this

926
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,760
Speaker 9:  is how you open the phone. I mean it also by the way, helps guide regulators

927
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,560
Speaker 9:  because when when I go to them and say, Hey, it's hard to open the

928
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:07,280
Speaker 9:  iPad, they're like, okay, sure Kyle. But then when, when we've got Apple

929
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,600
Speaker 9:  service manuals say, which they haven't posted for the iPad yet by the way.

930
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,160
Speaker 9:  But that to show like, hey, the battery is glued in and this is the process

931
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,800
Speaker 9:  and it's this crazy hard, that makes it much easier for regulators, for

932
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,800
Speaker 9:  academics. One of the big challenges I think in regulation and, and

933
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,160
Speaker 9:  honestly product reviews across electronics is, is who's out there taking

934
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,320
Speaker 9:  these things apart? Like when's the last time you guys took something apart

935
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,840
Speaker 9:  while you were reviewing it? And that's not a criticism, it's just it doesn't

936
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,200
Speaker 9:  happen very often. Yeah, it's expensive. You have to get a lot of products.

937
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,320
Speaker 9:  I mean we spent over $10,000 on iPhone fifteens on launch day just

938
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,480
Speaker 9:  to get enough of them so we could pull 'em apart and give you guys some kind

939
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,280
Speaker 9:  of analysis of like, hey, if you swap the screens, the selfie camera stops

940
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,240
Speaker 9:  working. No one would've known that if we hadn't tested it. I'm,

941
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,640
Speaker 8:  I'm gonna plug here and say I totally did take apart the steam deck and the

942
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,360
Speaker 8:  rug ally for my reviews with those products, but yes, doesn't happen all

943
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:56,560
Speaker 8:  the time.

944
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:00,440
Speaker 9:  No, and we super appreciate it and Sean you go more in depth than just about

945
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,720
Speaker 9:  anybody else in the Technosphere, which is really appreciated. We need to

946
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,240
Speaker 9:  see more of that.

947
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,120
Speaker 2:  Sean, can you talk about the steam deck actually because I think in the realm

948
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,320
Speaker 2:  of this sort of next phase of more repairable gadgets, I think Valve with

949
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,960
Speaker 2:  the steam deck is kind of out ahead of a lot of other companies in the way

950
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,720
Speaker 2:  that it's thinking about how this stuff should work. Is that true?

951
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,600
Speaker 8:  Absolutely. I flew to Valves headquarters two years ago in

952
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,840
Speaker 8:  August and I asked them, Hey,

953
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,160
Speaker 8:  are the parts for this going to be replaceable? And like the very first hands

954
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,040
Speaker 8:  on that P had with this thing, this battery in here, it's a small

955
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,640
Speaker 8:  battery. You only get like your two hours of battery life. Maybe

956
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,120
Speaker 8:  this is gonna wear out, it's gonna go lower and lower battery. You're gonna

957
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,800
Speaker 8:  let, let me replace that. Right? And they were like, we have a plan

958
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:49,040
Speaker 8:  to let you repair this device. We will send you more details when they're

959
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,880
Speaker 8:  ready. Which we

960
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,720
Speaker 2:  Have learned to be dubious of over the years.

961
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,200
Speaker 8:  Yes. The Rug alley, we we're still waiting to find out how you repair that

962
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,000
Speaker 8:  one and then it turned out that you were their partner iFixit was their partner

963
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,360
Speaker 8:  for the Steam deck parts and you could buy I think literally

964
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,320
Speaker 8:  every part of this.

965
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,040
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And it takes a long time to set these programs up. So while, while

966
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,560
Speaker 9:  they were, they were showing you off, like we were hammering out the details

967
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,520
Speaker 9:  of logistics of how we get parts out there. But it's been really important.

968
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,440
Speaker 9:  It's been really successful. It's like it really shows that repair takes

969
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,280
Speaker 9:  an ecosystem. It takes a product that can be repaired, which maybe

970
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,680
Speaker 9:  is the challenge with some of the foldables right now is they're a little

971
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,200
Speaker 9:  hard to fix. But then it also takes the parts and tools and the information

972
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,560
Speaker 9:  you have to have that whole ecosystem come together. Otherwise people You

973
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,120
Speaker 9:  know when it breaks, they sort of do the math in their head and they and

974
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,160
Speaker 9:  they decide to buy a new one.

975
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Kyle, can you explain a little more about how partnership like that

976
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,840
Speaker 2:  comes together? 'cause I suspect whether it's with you or with other repair

977
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,960
Speaker 2:  manufacturers around the country, like a lot of people who make electronics

978
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,880
Speaker 2:  are going to be out there trying to figure out how to strike partnerships

979
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,800
Speaker 2:  like this. So when Valve comes to you and they're like, we wanna work with

980
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,560
Speaker 2:  you on some steam deck stuff, what happens?

981
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,480
Speaker 9:  Yeah, so there's, there's a spectrum that the simplest thing is is they come

982
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,040
Speaker 9:  to us and say, Hey, we wanna fix the thing. We say Cool, set us up with your

983
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,400
Speaker 9:  supply chain. Introduce us to your suppliers. We'll buy from them. We'll

984
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,680
Speaker 9:  write the repair manuals, we'll build the store for you. We just kind of

985
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,680
Speaker 9:  take care of everything, okay? Which is what we've been doing historically,

986
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:11,080
Speaker 9:  You know, like we we're the largest resource for how to fix Apple products.

987
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,040
Speaker 9:  We have been for 20 years. We don't work with Apple all, but aside from

988
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,760
Speaker 9:  that You know we build the supply chain and we come up with the tools and

989
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,640
Speaker 9:  we build repair kits. So you get a screen and it comes with the tools you

990
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,960
Speaker 9:  need to do that repair. And that's kind of our happy spot is just let us

991
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,240
Speaker 9:  do everything. But some companies already have the information or like we

992
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,920
Speaker 9:  work with teenage engineering, they've got some really cool audio products

993
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,600
Speaker 9:  and they actually, they wanted to write the repair procedures. So they write

994
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,360
Speaker 9:  the repair guides, they put them on iFixit and then they send us the parts

995
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,240
Speaker 9:  and we're just, at that point, we're just an e-commerce company for them.

996
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,040
Speaker 9:  And that's, that's perfectly fine too. So we're pretty flexible. We work

997
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,440
Speaker 9:  with companies however they want. We'll kind of fill in whatever gaps they

998
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,200
Speaker 9:  need, but we're, we're perfectly capable of of doing everything from soup

999
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:50,480
Speaker 9:  to nuts.

1000
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,840
Speaker 8:  How do you properly size the repair supply chain

1001
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,040
Speaker 8:  pipeline for, for users who wanna buy parts through iFixit? I mean I

1002
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,000
Speaker 8:  know that you haven't always been able to keep all the parts in stock

1003
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,960
Speaker 8:  Yeah. That I would possibly want for a steam deck or, or a Pixel or I

1004
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,080
Speaker 8:  think last time I checked you had like two iPhone mini screens in stock.

1005
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,160
Speaker 8:  If I wanted to replace one of those, like how do you figure that out?

1006
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,360
Speaker 9:  It's hard and, and we don't know how many of the

1007
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,360
Speaker 9:  gizmos are going to sell, how many are going to break. It's really challenging,

1008
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,200
Speaker 9:  right? And so you do the best that you can and then you adapt it over time

1009
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:29,040
Speaker 9:  and the tighter knit the supply chain is the better. Also You know

1010
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,800
Speaker 9:  planning out so All, right? We're gonna stop production of this device and

1011
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,760
Speaker 9:  we're going to You know make the next version of it. But we have to at that

1012
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,720
Speaker 9:  point do what's called a last time buy. You have to buy all the parts that

1013
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,640
Speaker 9:  you're gonna need for the next five or 10 years for the device as you're

1014
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,520
Speaker 9:  just kinda guessing at that point. So we do the best we can and when we

1015
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,960
Speaker 9:  get it wrong, our community lets us know. That's

1016
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,840
Speaker 2:  Fair. Yeah. Sean was was lamenting that the steam deck stuff has

1017
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,760
Speaker 2:  be, has been sort of intermittently hard to get. Yeah, over time

1018
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,280
Speaker 9:  We, I mean we have tools so you sign up on the email list and we'll mail

1019
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,200
Speaker 9:  you the moment that that the part comes back in. But yeah, that doesn't,

1020
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,720
Speaker 9:  that doesn't help when your thing is broken and I don't have the part.

1021
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,600
Speaker 2:  So what's your sense of kind of what happens most

1022
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:11,720
Speaker 2:  immediately here? It feels like long run we might start to

1023
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,320
Speaker 2:  see a change in the way gadgets are made and work. Like your

1024
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,960
Speaker 2:  AirPods might come from a fundamentally different manufacturing process,

1025
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,600
Speaker 2:  but that's gonna take a while because this stuff always takes a while, right?

1026
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:24,760
Speaker 2:  Maybe more immediately like the re rise of the

1027
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,120
Speaker 2:  local repair shop, which seems to be very clearly kind of a goal of this.

1028
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,480
Speaker 2:  Like what do you look for as sort of the first metric of success that like

1029
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,120
Speaker 2:  this is working, this law is having its intended effect here? Well

1030
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,200
Speaker 9:  The first and the most easiest thing is to get companies to publish all their

1031
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Speaker 9:  service information. So that should happen. New York law goes into effect

1032
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,640
Speaker 9:  January one. So at that point, January two you should be looking at companies

1033
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,000
Speaker 9:  and if they're not posting their service information, they're outta compliance,

1034
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,880
Speaker 9:  right? And that having that just that basic level of insight into how are

1035
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,160
Speaker 9:  these things put together then starts to help. Then we hope to layer on on

1036
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,760
Speaker 9:  parts availability and then of the pricing and You know kind of consumer

1037
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,560
Speaker 9:  awareness follows. Like right now people don't fix televisions. You have

1038
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,040
Speaker 9:  a TV that breaks, just get a new one. There's no reason like it's, these

1039
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,880
Speaker 9:  things are not glued together like AirPods, they're pretty easy to fix. If

1040
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,120
Speaker 9:  you have a power supply go out in a tv, it's crazy to buy a new one. But

1041
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,680
Speaker 9:  we have to kind of retrain society that way. Yeah,

1042
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,800
Speaker 2:  Sean is gonna be like deep in manual deep dive heaven

1043
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:22,520
Speaker 2:  for like the first six months of 2024. It's gonna be, he's like a hundred

1044
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,280
Speaker 2:  million pages of of documentation in in Sean's house. It's gonna be amazing.

1045
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,240
Speaker 8:  I have to ask you about parts pairings, You know we can't back when I was

1046
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,280
Speaker 8:  could report on Apple, I have an ethical conflict now, so don't report on

1047
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,480
Speaker 8:  Apple, but back when I did, I received those two suitcases full of

1048
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:41,120
Speaker 8:  Pelican suitcases full of Apple repair tools and I stuck that battery

1049
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,760
Speaker 8:  in my iPhone and then it told me that my battery was not genuine. Yeah.

1050
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,720
Speaker 8:  Until I went through this procedure to make it genuine. And I know that

1051
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,240
Speaker 8:  companies like I fix that they're worried that these manufacturers

1052
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:57,480
Speaker 8:  may decide to require that some part be paired with some other part, either

1053
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:01,640
Speaker 8:  digitally requiring some kind of special authentication that might be difficult

1054
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,280
Speaker 8:  to get or physically where they will only sell you a module

1055
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:08,880
Speaker 8:  that has all these different things on it. Can you really repair a TV if

1056
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,840
Speaker 8:  they say you need to buy the TV main board which has all the

1057
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,840
Speaker 8:  components on it for the entire TV and you're basically buying a whole new

1058
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,280
Speaker 8:  tv, do we want them to You know have buy an entire

1059
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:23,000
Speaker 8:  compute board for a phone or can you buy the individual

1060
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,400
Speaker 8:  pieces?

1061
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:27,360
Speaker 9:  Yeah, so the question here is one around control. Can a manufacturer dictate

1062
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,320
Speaker 9:  where and when devices are repaired? And so if you have a chip

1063
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,440
Speaker 9:  in the part and a chip in the, in the main board, so let's take the display

1064
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,520
Speaker 9:  on the, on The iPhone for example. There's a chip in the, in the display

1065
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,960
Speaker 9:  with a serial number at the factory, they marry or they pair

1066
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,520
Speaker 9:  the serial number in your display, the serial number on your phone. We took

1067
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:48,280
Speaker 9:  two brand new iPhone, 15 pro max units. We swap the screens between them

1068
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,920
Speaker 9:  and you lose a bunch of functionality, you lose true tone, you lose the

1069
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,000
Speaker 9:  front facing camera, which seems like an important feature of a phone.

1070
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,920
Speaker 9:  You lose a lot of these features and you also You know start to get a lot,

1071
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,960
Speaker 9:  a lot of warnings. It's pretty easy to build those kind of locks in.

1072
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,800
Speaker 9:  So that's why we're kind of raising the red flag and saying this is a moment

1073
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,640
Speaker 9:  in technology where we need to pause, we need to evaluate what road do we

1074
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,400
Speaker 9:  wanna go down, do we wanna go down the road where parts are not interchangeable?

1075
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,800
Speaker 9:  Right? I mean for for the entire history of the electronics industry so far,

1076
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,640
Speaker 9:  you have two PCs, you stop the hard drives between them, you can do that

1077
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,480
Speaker 9:  Now we're saying, well you can't even swap screens between two phones. The

1078
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,160
Speaker 9:  entire electronics recycling ecosystem. They don't make money off the

1079
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,800
Speaker 9:  commodity. They don't make money off the gold and the silver in these things,

1080
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,600
Speaker 9:  they make money because 20% of the devices that they get can be fixed and

1081
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,600
Speaker 9:  resold and that subsidizes the rest of the recycling. So when you

1082
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,720
Speaker 9:  insert this poison pill where you say, well no actually you have two broken

1083
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,360
Speaker 9:  phones, you can't combine them and make one that works, that's really gonna

1084
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:49,240
Speaker 9:  sabotage the economics of the electronics recycling and

1085
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,960
Speaker 9:  refurbishment industry. So we need to do something about that. None of the

1086
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,520
Speaker 9:  right to repair laws that have passed so far address this. The California

1087
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:00,480
Speaker 9:  law had some language in it that would've done that and in, in a compromise

1088
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,560
Speaker 9:  to get Apple to support the legislation that was removed. So

1089
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:08,120
Speaker 9:  stay tuned for next year I think. I think I think we're gonna need to do

1090
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,360
Speaker 9:  this. We we cannot stop with right. Repair legislation. We need to keep going

1091
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,080
Speaker 9:  and, and that's the conversation we're having with all the states about next

1092
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,600
Speaker 9:  year's laws.

1093
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:19,560
Speaker 2:  What does keep going look like? I think it, it's very easy to see rights

1094
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,440
Speaker 2:  to repair as kind of a binary thing. Either you're allowed to do it or you're

1095
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,080
Speaker 2:  not, but what you're presenting is a much sort of longer series of steps.

1096
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,800
Speaker 2:  Like what is the step after this?

1097
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:31,480
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So we need to get to a point where repair is practiced

1098
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:35,440
Speaker 9:  regularly on the ground where the TV is not only is fixable,

1099
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,640
Speaker 9:  you can get parts, but the people are and the repair sharps start to come

1100
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,480
Speaker 9:  back. And so we, we can't really stop working on this. We, we have

1101
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,680
Speaker 9:  momentum behind this, but we can't stop until we actually see the, the solutions

1102
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,360
Speaker 9:  start having an effect on the material world. Someone very wise once told

1103
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,080
Speaker 9:  me the earth doesn't care about anything that we say it only ha

1104
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,920
Speaker 9:  caress about when you actually take a shovel and you You know stick it in

1105
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,880
Speaker 9:  the ground and you start doing things. So we need to get right to repair

1106
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,560
Speaker 9:  from this discussion, this intellectual discussion to like practically something

1107
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,160
Speaker 9:  that impacts how long things last. Are there key

1108
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,840
Speaker 8:  States that support parts pairing and other important missing

1109
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,680
Speaker 8:  elements from the current right to repair laws where you think you've got

1110
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,920
Speaker 8:  the momentum to make it happen there?

1111
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:16,120
Speaker 9:  Yeah, so ranger repair bills were introduced in 30 states this year. So I'm

1112
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,040
Speaker 9:  anticipating and like Minnesota is still considering it, the hope would be

1113
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,920
Speaker 9:  to make substantial progress in many of those. That it's not just just core

1114
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,680
Speaker 9:  electronics. We need to solve this for e-bikes, we need to solve this for,

1115
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,760
Speaker 9:  for appliances, for power equipment. There's a broad spectrum

1116
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,880
Speaker 9:  of other products that that need to be covered. So, I would, I would expect,

1117
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,440
Speaker 9:  I mean like Washington is a state where the bill got really close.

1118
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,240
Speaker 9:  Microsoft actually endorsed Washington. It's right to repair Bill and then

1119
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,320
Speaker 9:  Apple killed it. So I think you're gonna see states where they got really

1120
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,920
Speaker 9:  close and Oregon, they were just short one vote. I think there's many states

1121
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,680
Speaker 9:  that going to, you're gonna see move quickly at the beginning of next year.

1122
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,760
Speaker 9:  The the legislative season. By the way You know, you think about in the tech

1123
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,200
Speaker 9:  world we have c e s right after c e s that's when all the legislators get

1124
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,920
Speaker 9:  to work and there's like a two, three month kind of frenzy of activity where

1125
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,680
Speaker 9:  between February, March, April you're gonna see a lot of action.

1126
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,280
Speaker 9:  So

1127
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,080
Speaker 2:  You're, you're like, like California celebratory period was very

1128
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:09,800
Speaker 2:  short, very

1129
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,720
Speaker 9:  Short. I I mean I can tell you all the, the coalition is very busy,

1130
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:17,120
Speaker 9:  very engaged. There's a, there's an active coalition in each state and you

1131
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,160
Speaker 9:  can go if you want check out your state, you can go to oregon.repair.org

1132
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,360
Speaker 9:  and get involved. There's wonderful, I mean this really is a grassroots movement

1133
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:27,840
Speaker 9:  where like I couldn't even tell you where it's gonna happen next. Like what's

1134
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,800
Speaker 9:  gonna happen in Pennsylvania. I dunno there's a great community there that

1135
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,680
Speaker 9:  might might push it forward

1136
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:36,040
Speaker 2:  At the risk of basically asking you to jinx yourself. Does this

1137
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,520
Speaker 2:  feel unstoppable at this point? Like have we, have we tipped into

1138
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,720
Speaker 2:  this is gonna win, it's just a matter of time.

1139
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,200
Speaker 9:  We're we're making very good price. I mean we've moved beyond the, the sky

1140
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,680
Speaker 9:  will fall of this passes stage. There was so long, I mean Apple was wandering

1141
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,000
Speaker 9:  around Sacramento telling legislators, hey, if people can open their iPhone,

1142
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,720
Speaker 9:  they'll puncture the battery and set it on fire. And they told legislators

1143
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,520
Speaker 9:  in Nebraska that if, if they passed rates to repair would turn Nebraska into

1144
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,040
Speaker 9:  a mecca for hackers. And and I think those sort of like sky wolf fall kind

1145
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,440
Speaker 9:  of claims have have clearly been proven wrong.

1146
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,880
Speaker 2:  It's the same fight we're having about the app store. If you're allowed to

1147
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,440
Speaker 2:  do anything, yeah, you will give all of your money to a stranger and also

1148
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,120
Speaker 2:  burn your house down. Right? That's, these are the rules, which

1149
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,960
Speaker 9:  By the way, the app store has banned apps that report battery status.

1150
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,560
Speaker 9:  So Apple's the only, the the only one that can tell you how many cycles are

1151
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,040
Speaker 9:  on your battery.

1152
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,400
Speaker 2:  Interesting. So okay, so we're past that phase. Are there, are there other

1153
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,160
Speaker 2:  sort of obvious roadblocks you're seeing that you still have to get past?

1154
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:34,600
Speaker 9:  So parts pairing is a large one and then I think you

1155
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,800
Speaker 9:  have to look at implementation timeframe. You know going back to 2021, is

1156
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,720
Speaker 9:  that far enough back some challenges around internet access? Should

1157
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,800
Speaker 9:  you be able to fix things if you don't have access to the internet? You know,

1158
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,640
Speaker 9:  if you look at who uses iFixit, we are per capita much

1159
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,000
Speaker 9:  more heavily used in rural areas than in, than in urban areas,

1160
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:56,240
Speaker 9:  right? They're farther from access to to retail locations. I You know

1161
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,800
Speaker 9:  the farther north in Canada you go the more people rely on on iFixit

1162
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,840
Speaker 9:  and So I think making sure that that repair is robust and repeatable

1163
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:07,360
Speaker 9:  and, and that these software diagnostic tools are available to everyone is

1164
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,320
Speaker 9:  really important. It, it impacts far more products than you would think.

1165
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,560
Speaker 9:  Like you think about like an outboard engine on a boat. Traditionally you've

1166
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,560
Speaker 9:  been able to fix that without software. Now it's all software controlled

1167
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,360
Speaker 9:  and you talk to fishermen and they're like, yeah, I can't fix my engine anymore

1168
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,080
Speaker 9:  five years ago I could but I can't fix the one now 'cause I don't have the

1169
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,160
Speaker 9:  software. And and that's increasingly the case across everything of the software

1170
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,480
Speaker 9:  and the technology. It's making these products better in some ways, but they're

1171
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,920
Speaker 9:  not following up with access to the the diagnostic tooling that we need.

1172
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:36,080
Speaker 8:  Have, have you seen any of this? I mean when we're talking about phones,

1173
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,320
Speaker 8:  I mean it's, it's very hard in the United States. There's, there's Apple

1174
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:43,000
Speaker 8:  and there's Samsung is are predominant predominantly the market share of

1175
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,960
Speaker 8:  old phones. Most people buy from them. But when it comes to like outboard

1176
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,880
Speaker 8:  motor for your boat, do you see any kind of pushback in that realm

1177
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,040
Speaker 8:  where consumers, the people buying those things say

1178
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:58,400
Speaker 8:  we're going to buy lower tech products instead of higher tech

1179
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,120
Speaker 8:  products so that we have the ability to repair them on their own. Are there

1180
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,880
Speaker 8:  manufacturers, You know who are intentionally

1181
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:09,280
Speaker 8:  developing more repairable lower tech devices for those those

1182
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:09,720
Speaker 8:  realms?

1183
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,520
Speaker 9:  You can see this in the farm equipment industry. If, if you take a tractor

1184
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,360
Speaker 9:  from 1995, it's, its value is continuing to go up. It's not

1185
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,320
Speaker 9:  going down. The, the kind of pre-computer age of farm equipment

1186
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:25,040
Speaker 9:  is in is in high demand and, and you can, you can see the economics playing

1187
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:29,040
Speaker 9:  out very clearly now I think it's interesting that you haven't

1188
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,040
Speaker 9:  seen manufacturers take advantage of it. So, I haven't seen a manufacturer

1189
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,960
Speaker 9:  like Kubota go out there and say, well we're gonna make a lower tech tractor

1190
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:39,920
Speaker 9:  that's easier to work on and beat John Deere at their own game. It seems

1191
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,480
Speaker 9:  like everyone is still in the cult of technology, the cult of the new, which

1192
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,360
Speaker 9:  is, which is really frustrating because if one of them would break out, I

1193
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,320
Speaker 9:  mean you see the success that framework is having, I think there's, there's

1194
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,960
Speaker 9:  a real opportunity for, for some of these companies to really differentiate

1195
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,240
Speaker 9:  themselves from the the Goliaths.

1196
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,000
Speaker 2:  I think that's right and it also people root for framework in a really interesting

1197
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,560
Speaker 2:  way. Like there is this sense that companies like framework are on this

1198
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:07,920
Speaker 2:  morally right side of history and I hear people in tech

1199
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:11,880
Speaker 2:  who would never buy a framework laptop and don't even care about laptops

1200
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,960
Speaker 2:  who are like, boy I hope that company succeeds because it's like the, they,

1201
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,320
Speaker 2:  their sense is everything is better if we prove that that can work.

1202
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:21,880
Speaker 9:  It's proposing a different trajectory than what seemed was inevitable.

1203
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:26,680
Speaker 2:  What is, what is the single part of a gadget that you are like

1204
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:30,160
Speaker 2:  most excited for everybody to make repairable? Like what do you, if if everybody

1205
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,440
Speaker 2:  just opens up one thing, is it screens? Is it batteries?

1206
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:36,920
Speaker 9:  It's it's batteries. A hundred percent. It's batteries across everything.

1207
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:41,200
Speaker 9:  Batteries are consumable. Having a a a battery glued into a device is like

1208
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,240
Speaker 9:  buying a car with tires that are welded on it's insanity.

1209
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:49,000
Speaker 9:  Go to Home Depot and they're like, hey get the new smoke detector with

1210
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,160
Speaker 9:  a 10 year battery that you never have to change. You just throw the smoke

1211
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,000
Speaker 9:  detector away after 10 years. The smoke detector has a radioactive isotope

1212
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,120
Speaker 9:  at the center of this thing. We don't want to be throwing these away, right?

1213
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,640
Speaker 9:  Like why in the world would we want everything in the world to have this,

1214
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,520
Speaker 9:  this chemical pouch inside it that wears out after three years?

1215
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:10,440
Speaker 9:  It's absolute insanity. We have to move away from glued in

1216
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,840
Speaker 9:  integrated batteries and everything until, I mean if, if we get to a point

1217
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,280
Speaker 9:  where we have some magical new battery technology that lasts for 50 years,

1218
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:20,480
Speaker 9:  okay cool, we can glue batteries in at that point but we're, we're not there

1219
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,320
Speaker 9:  yet. Yeah,

1220
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,920
Speaker 2:  I like thinking batteries as a consumable and otherwise very long lasting

1221
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,800
Speaker 2:  thing is actually I think a really useful frame for how we talk about technology.

1222
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:28,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

1223
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,680
Speaker 9:  Let's take your refrigerator that was gonna last for 30 years and make it

1224
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,320
Speaker 9:  last for two and see how happy you are. That's, that's the world.

1225
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:39,440
Speaker 9:  It just drives me insane and I've been watching the trend and by the way

1226
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,800
Speaker 9:  there are underpinning reasons like there are UL standards that have to change.

1227
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:46,240
Speaker 9:  It's not completely the manufacturer's fault. Where in kind of the system

1228
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,040
Speaker 9:  that has accidentally been designed that really pushes us in the direction

1229
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,560
Speaker 9:  of proprietary battery packs. Even if you do make an interchangeable battery,

1230
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:57,520
Speaker 9:  like what standard is there for interchangeable lithium pouch

1231
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,360
Speaker 9:  cells right there isn't one there? What, what size if I'm like I'm a good

1232
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,960
Speaker 9:  cell phone manufacturer, I'm gonna use the standard battery size, what is

1233
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,360
Speaker 9:  that? And that's a problem that needs to be addressed at an industry level

1234
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:12,360
Speaker 9:  to then enable manufacturers to innovate around interchangeable interoperable

1235
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:12,880
Speaker 9:  batteries.

1236
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,040
Speaker 2:  I like it. All, right? We should let you go Sean Kyle thank you both so much

1237
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,000
Speaker 2:  and Kyle You know congratulations on your gigantic victory and your impending

1238
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,520
Speaker 2:  billionaire status as the c e O of I fixing.

1239
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:28,000
Speaker 9:  This is a win I think for all consumers, everyone who's beening for this

1240
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,120
Speaker 9:  for so long. I mean we owe so much to Reddit and all of the

1241
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,240
Speaker 9:  enthusiastic folks who've written and called their their representatives

1242
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,960
Speaker 9:  over the years, let's not take off the gas now we're we, we got 'em on the

1243
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,240
Speaker 9:  ropes. But we need to keep pushing this until we really

1244
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,320
Speaker 9:  solidify and build a solid foundation that the next wave of technology is

1245
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,560
Speaker 9:  built on. Love

1246
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,520
Speaker 2:  It. Awesome. Thank you both. Appreciate you doing this. Thanks

1247
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,880
Speaker 2:  All. right, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna get to The

1266
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:07,270
Speaker 2:  This one. We got a bunch of like charging questions this week. I

1267
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:10,030
Speaker 2:  guess it's like new gadget time so everybody has lots of charging questions

1268
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:13,070
Speaker 2:  but this one was my favorite And the reason we have brought you in Nathan

1269
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:16,630
Speaker 2:  is because this is right up your alley, let's just play the question first.

1270
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:17,830
Speaker 2:  It comes from Kyle.

1271
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:23,190
Speaker 12:  Hi this is Kyle from Nova Scotia, Canada. I was wondering if there have

1272
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,990
Speaker 12:  been any updates on the Q two wireless charging standard,

1273
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:31,390
Speaker 12:  the MagSafe sort of looking magnet thing from a while back. You guys

1274
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:35,030
Speaker 12:  wrote about how the new iPhone is kind of supporting it but it didn't appear

1275
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:38,990
Speaker 12:  on the Pixel eight. So that's it for major flagships for now.

1276
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,990
Speaker 12:  When we see an Android with Q two, I want my hacky magnet

1277
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,510
Speaker 12:  accessories and car chargers. I've been listening for ajs. Love the show.

1278
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:46,950
Speaker 12:  Thanks.

1279
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:51,150
Speaker 2:  Okay, I love this question because it is so confused and so

1280
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:54,990
Speaker 2:  vague about what Chee two is and when it's coming, which is the exact

1281
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:57,670
Speaker 2:  correct response as far as I can tell to what is going on with chee two.

1282
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:01,830
Speaker 2:  So Nathan, just start quickly at the very beginning, catch me up what

1283
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,590
Speaker 2:  is Q two and why do we care?

1284
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,630
Speaker 11:  Okay, so Q two is the sequel to Qi, which is the wireless charging

1285
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:11,440
Speaker 11:  standard that is in pretty much every phone. Almost everything that charges

1286
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,600
Speaker 11:  wirelessly right now except for smart watches is Qi regular

1287
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:19,760
Speaker 11:  chi, no magnets including The, iPhone. The. iPhone also has MagSafe which

1288
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,640
Speaker 11:  has a ring of magnets to make sure that the charger and the charging

1289
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:27,560
Speaker 11:  coil aligns with the receiver coil because wireless charging is very finicky

1290
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,880
Speaker 11:  if you're off by a couple millimeters, that takes more power. It's less

1291
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,280
Speaker 11:  efficient is you're not gonna get a good lock. The

1292
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,960
Speaker 2:  Thing the iPhone's always really good at is like you get sort of close and

1293
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:39,440
Speaker 2:  then it just like sort of snaps into position. That's MagSafe. Everything

1294
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,720
Speaker 2:  else is Qi. Yes.

1295
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:43,960
Speaker 11:  Okay. MagSafe phones will work with Qi and in fact there's a lot of

1296
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,520
Speaker 11:  magnetic Qi accessories that are not MagSafe certified but they've got

1297
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:51,240
Speaker 11:  the Qi charger and they've got the Ring of magnets and they'll stick to

1298
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,640
Speaker 11:  the back of mag a MagSafe phone and charge it just fine. Okay, that's Q

1299
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,400
Speaker 11:  one. Doesn't include the magnets. Q two is basically generic MagSafe, it's

1300
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,200
Speaker 11:  over the counter MagSafe. Okay. Basically it is wireless

1301
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,680
Speaker 11:  charger with a ring of magnets around it. Apple contributed a bunch to the

1302
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,200
Speaker 11:  new standard. It's run by the Wireless Power Consortium, which

1303
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:13,400
Speaker 11:  is the same group that administers the cheese standard and basically

1304
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:17,360
Speaker 11:  it's got a ring of magnets so it should be incompatible with

1305
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,560
Speaker 11:  MagSafe to some degree in the sense that Apple doesn't have to do anything

1306
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:24,640
Speaker 11:  as far as I know, they don't have to do anything to make QE two work hardware

1307
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,520
Speaker 11:  wise 'cause the magnets, although they're not exactly the same configuration,

1308
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,520
Speaker 11:  apparently they'll work just fine. Okay. So it's something that's already

1309
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:35,240
Speaker 11:  on Apple. It's not officially on the new iPhones because

1310
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:36,960
Speaker 11:  it's not certified yet. This

1311
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,520
Speaker 2:  Is weird, right? So like I remember when the, when The iPhone 15 came out

1312
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,040
Speaker 2:  a few weeks ago, Q two came up, it was

1313
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:43,920
Speaker 11:  Like yes briefly.

1314
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:47,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Sort of mentioned in passing and we tried to figure out like is this

1315
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:52,160
Speaker 2:  the first official QE two phone? And the answer is like kind

1316
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:52,320
Speaker 2:  of,

1317
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,760
Speaker 11:  It probably will be the first official QE two phone. Okay. So it

1318
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,600
Speaker 11:  said the specs said future QE two support and I reached out to the

1319
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:04,560
Speaker 11:  wireless power consortium and I said Hey, what's up with Q two?

1320
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:08,600
Speaker 11:  Like is the standard complete, is it certified? Do we have devices ready

1321
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,520
Speaker 11:  to go? 'cause we've had Q two chargers already have been announced. Okay.

1322
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:16,520
Speaker 11:  And they told me at the time, which was like mid-September when the iPhones

1323
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,480
Speaker 11:  launched, they said they hadn't certified any Q two devices yet because

1324
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,800
Speaker 11:  they were waiting for the test equipment. I see. To be able to certify them,

1325
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,200
Speaker 11:  they need to be able to test them and so forth. That stuff wasn't set up

1326
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,160
Speaker 11:  yet and I pinged him again earlier this week and he

1327
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,280
Speaker 11:  basically told me hold tight.

1328
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:32,000
Speaker 2:  Okay,

1329
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:36,520
Speaker 11:  So I am expecting that there will be QE two chargers and probably

1330
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,640
Speaker 11:  QE two enabled on the iPhones this month, next month maybe.

1331
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:44,640
Speaker 11:  Okay. As for the actual question, which is when will there be Android phones

1332
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,280
Speaker 11:  with Q two? I don't know. Nobody knows.

1333
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:51,280
Speaker 2:  The assumption would be that next year would be the answer to that, right?

1334
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,880
Speaker 2:  There's no good reason not to have it everywhere. Right. This is the new

1335
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,400
Speaker 2:  standard. Everyone who's been supporting Q for a while it feels like, is

1336
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,000
Speaker 2:  there an obvious reason we wouldn't see a flood of Android phones start to

1337
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,280
Speaker 2:  support this over the next year? Or So?

1338
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,280
Speaker 11:  I would say development pipelines. Okay. Like I don't know, T two was officially

1339
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:11,120
Speaker 11:  announced, mentioned at the beginning of 2023. If people

1340
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,880
Speaker 11:  have had time to put the magnets into the design and manufacturing

1341
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:18,320
Speaker 11:  and stuff, I would say probably spring is the earliest we'd see something.

1342
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:22,320
Speaker 11:  And it also like I, I agree there's no reason not to put it in there because

1343
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,480
Speaker 11:  there's a bunch of magnetic chargers out there already.

1344
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:30,040
Speaker 11:  The generic magnetic key chargers you have now that will charge an

1345
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:33,680
Speaker 11:  Android phone actually faster than they'll charge an iPhone. What? Yes,

1346
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:34,880
Speaker 11:  they will. This is why

1347
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,640
Speaker 2:  We get questions about charging because charging doesn't make any sense.

1348
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,280
Speaker 11:  It it doesn't, it's silly. So if you have an official MagSafe

1349
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:45,320
Speaker 11:  certified charger that's got a little chip in it that tells The

1350
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,600
Speaker 11:  iPhone that it's real and The, iPhone will charge at 15 watts.

1351
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:53,120
Speaker 11:  Anything else has just a regular cheat charger and iPhone, iPhone will charge

1352
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:57,040
Speaker 11:  at 7.5 watts and that's an Apple thing because if you take an

1353
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,000
Speaker 11:  Android phone and just sort of hold it to the charger or use

1354
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,320
Speaker 11:  one of the third party cases that gives you a little ring of magnets in

1355
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:06,960
Speaker 11:  the right spot it it can get 10 or 15, whatever it normally supports with

1356
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,800
Speaker 11:  wireless charging, it can support through that. So you'll get companies

1357
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,760
Speaker 11:  that'll be like, hey this is a 15 watt MagSafe charger, it's a 15 watt charger

1358
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:18,960
Speaker 11:  and it's MagSafe compatible. But it will certainly not unless it's certified

1359
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,840
Speaker 11:  by Apple. It actually won't do that on an iPhone. It's like 15 watts and,

1360
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,040
Speaker 11:  and or

1361
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:25,680
Speaker 2:  Right, but not simultaneously.

1362
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,120
Speaker 11:  No. But Q two here we come circling back around Q two,

1363
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:34,000
Speaker 11:  the big advantage of Q two is it will offer magnetic wireless charging at

1364
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,720
Speaker 11:  15 watts on any phone that supports it without having to

1365
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,360
Speaker 11:  pay extra money for the Apple certification. Okay. Including

1366
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,240
Speaker 11:  allegedly iPhones.

1367
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:47,440
Speaker 2:  And the reason this is very exciting it seems to me is that if Q two is what

1368
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,880
Speaker 2:  it is promised, it solves both of the biggest

1369
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,960
Speaker 2:  problems of wireless charging all at once, which is the

1370
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,840
Speaker 2:  like finicky, I put it down, a millimeter off and so it didn't charge problem,

1371
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:02,320
Speaker 2:  which is the single most annoying thing about wireless charging and the fact

1372
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,040
Speaker 2:  that wireless charging is much slower. So if I'm getting reliable connection

1373
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,600
Speaker 2:  to the charger and 15 watts suddenly I

1374
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,120
Speaker 2:  personally can go from like mostly not telling people to buy wireless chargers

1375
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,400
Speaker 2:  for their phones because they're kind of more annoying than they're worth

1376
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,040
Speaker 2:  in a lot of cases to this actually becomes like a

1377
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:20,800
Speaker 2:  tenable system, right?

1378
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,800
Speaker 11:  Yes. I will say that 15 watts is still slower than wired charging in most

1379
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,760
Speaker 11:  cases and both MagSafe and any other wireless charger,

1380
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:32,240
Speaker 11:  there's You know it'll, it'll charge at the max rate when the phone is really

1381
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:36,240
Speaker 11:  low and it'll drop it down as the phone gets closer to

1382
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:39,560
Speaker 11:  a full charge to save the battery a little bit. I don't know what's going

1383
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,320
Speaker 11:  on with The, iPhone 14 pro because it, my battery level is

1384
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:46,240
Speaker 11:  at 88% health after one year. Oof.

1385
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,120
Speaker 2:  That's not great.

1386
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,880
Speaker 11:  But in general, I don't know what's going on there. But in general they

1387
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,200
Speaker 11:  will only charge, they'll only hit the peak wireless charging at like if

1388
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,400
Speaker 11:  they're like under 30% or under 50% it'll taper off.

1389
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,680
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. Okay. So yeah, I think my guess would be, and this is purely

1390
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,520
Speaker 2:  conjecture based on nothing that like maybe next summer is

1391
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:08,280
Speaker 2:  about the time we'll start to see real Qi devices. 'cause the, the things

1392
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,280
Speaker 2:  somebody told me a while ago, CHI is held fairly true. Yeah, sorry, Qi. Yeah.

1393
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,680
Speaker 2:  The things somebody told me that has held pretty true is the pipeline

1394
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:19,680
Speaker 2:  from any announcement to devices is 18 months. So it's

1395
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,600
Speaker 2:  like from new standard exists to, it starts to be lots of places

1396
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:26,920
Speaker 2:  including like from reputable companies whose products you will

1397
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,040
Speaker 2:  actually buy that won't catch fire and come from Amazon with sketchy names

1398
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:33,640
Speaker 2:  is 18 months. And it's not always that it's sometimes a little longer, sometimes

1399
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,600
Speaker 2:  a little shorter, but that's a pretty good like rule of thumb, which would

1400
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,360
Speaker 2:  mean if, if Q two was this January, like summer 2024

1401
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:44,480
Speaker 2:  is when we might start to see a real run of like

1402
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:48,280
Speaker 2:  devices from big name manufacturers with some of this stuff. And the hope

1403
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:51,480
Speaker 2:  would be that they've been working for this longer than we know and it could

1404
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,680
Speaker 2:  be sooner. But I, I'm not necessarily holding my breath on that stuff.

1405
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:59,200
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I would say that probably summer is the soonest I would be curious

1406
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:02,920
Speaker 11:  to know who is gonna make the first move. 'cause if, depending on which

1407
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,400
Speaker 11:  manufacturer it is, do you want to be the company that basically put MagSafe

1408
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,320
Speaker 11:  in your phones? Like admitting Apple was right about something. That's

1409
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:09,880
Speaker 2:  A really good point.

1410
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:13,960
Speaker 11:  On the other hand, now that it's generic and it's not MagSafe, maybe

1411
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,480
Speaker 11:  they're all gonna do it. You're like, yes, this was a great idea, we told

1412
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,240
Speaker 11:  you you should have given it to us or something. Yeah, true. I don't know,

1413
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:23,520
Speaker 11:  is it gonna be Samsung, is it gonna be nothing? Yeah,

1414
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:27,680
Speaker 2:  It's an interesting question. I think my guess would be if I'm Samsung ever

1415
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,560
Speaker 2:  since the note seven, any anything to do with batteries

1416
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:35,600
Speaker 2:  and charging and craziness, I'm gonna be just a little, little slow on,

1417
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:39,080
Speaker 2:  just gonna take my sweet time on all things batteries and charging. So like

1418
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,720
Speaker 2:  maybe, yeah, maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's Google, maybe Apple just

1419
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:46,600
Speaker 2:  in January is like it's Q two now. Don't worry about it. And that's where

1420
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,560
Speaker 2:  we are. But yeah, I think, I think it's coming but it's gonna keep being

1421
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,200
Speaker 2:  confusing for a while unfortunately.

1422
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,320
Speaker 11:  I mean, and the first phones are gonna be Apple are gonna be the iPhones

1423
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,360
Speaker 11:  that are already here because they don't have to do anything hardware wise.

1424
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:01,080
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. All. right. Well Kyle, I hope that helps Nathan. Thank you.
