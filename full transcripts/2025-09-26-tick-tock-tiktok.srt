Description: After more than five years of backing and forthing, secret meetings and loud screeds, it appears the fate of TikTok in the US has finally been decided. Maybe. There are still a lot of unknowns, but we're pretty sure we know the bones of the deal — and we know which of President Trump's allies stand to benefit the most. Before we get to all that, though, David and Jake run through some big news in future gadgets, including the long-awaited-and-maybe-happening combination of Android and ChromeOS and the possibilities for a touchscreen MacBook. Then, The Verge's Liz Lopatto joins to talk TikTok. And Trump. Then, in the lightning round, the three hosts talk through Jimmy Kimmel's return, Nvidia's money problems, a surprising AmEx perk, and much more.




2
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:34,685
Speaker 2:  Welcome

3
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:38,685
Speaker 4:  To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of all of the apps being

4
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:42,405
Speaker 4:  like all of the other apps and all of the devices being like all of the other

5
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:46,365
Speaker 4:  devices. Yeah, it's 2025 and everything is the same. I'm your

6
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,525
Speaker 4:  friend David Pierce. Jake Kakis is here. Hi Jake.

7
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:52,005
Speaker 5:  Hey, what's going? I love when everything is the same. It, you can switch

8
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:56,125
Speaker 5:  between everything and you don't notice. It's great. Yeah.

9
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,325
Speaker 4:  From now on there is Gadget and there is app. And those are the only two

10
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:02,165
Speaker 4:  things we're gonna talk about from, from now on. Yep. And who makes them

11
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:06,085
Speaker 4:  is irrelevant. It's all the same. We're gonna talk a lot about this, but

12
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,965
Speaker 4:  we should say right up top here, it's 10 o'clock in the morning and we don't

13
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:13,845
Speaker 4:  typically record this podcast in the morning, but right now it's 10 o'clock

14
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:16,045
Speaker 4:  in the morning. You And I have some meetings later, so we're recording a

15
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:19,565
Speaker 4:  few hours early. This has some implications for some news we're about to

16
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:23,205
Speaker 4:  get to, but also the vibes are just different. Jake, can we, how, how are

17
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:25,685
Speaker 4:  you feeling at 10 o'clock in the morning making a podcast? What

18
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:29,445
Speaker 5:  David is quietly trying to say is that I just told him I

19
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:33,605
Speaker 5:  haven't had any caffeine that I, I just have been going all night

20
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:37,085
Speaker 5:  long and I'm, I'm plowing into the podcast studio ready to roll.

21
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:41,005
Speaker 5:  So I'm either gonna fall asleep or be like a little delirious on edge.

22
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:45,125
Speaker 4:  Jake is the, the 10 x coder of The Verge who just rolls

23
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:49,005
Speaker 4:  72 straight hours and, and like hacks. Bank of

24
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:52,645
Speaker 4:  America. That's, that's Jake. That's the vibe I want everyone to assume Jake

25
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,165
Speaker 4:  has on The Vergecast at all times.

26
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:56,045
Speaker 5:  Vergecast am, let's go. Really

27
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,525
Speaker 4:  What's upsetting me is I'm drinking coffee during The Vergecast and it's

28
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:02,205
Speaker 4:  just really throwing me off. But anyway, we have a lot of news to talk about

29
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:06,565
Speaker 4:  in a little while. We're gonna talk about the TikTok deal, which I think

30
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:10,485
Speaker 4:  annoyingly between right now as we're recording this. And when you hear this,

31
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:14,245
Speaker 4:  it seems like President Trump is going to issue and sign an executive order

32
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:18,485
Speaker 4:  outlining the deal that we have been hearing pieces about

33
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:22,445
Speaker 4:  for a long time. For there to be some kind of change with

34
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:26,125
Speaker 4:  TikTok And I, I say that vaguely because this is

35
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:28,565
Speaker 4:  still where we are. So Liz Lippa is gonna come on and we're gonna go through

36
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:31,445
Speaker 4:  it because I think even not knowing the executive order, I think we know

37
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:35,965
Speaker 4:  what this is going to be and what it's gonna mean already. So if we're

38
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:39,245
Speaker 4:  dead wrong, we'll be dead wrong. But I don't think so. I think we know what

39
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:43,005
Speaker 4:  this is gonna be. So we'll, we'll talk about it and then obviously come to

40
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:46,125
Speaker 4:  the verse.com for all of our coverage once the executive order comes out.

41
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,645
Speaker 4:  We also have a lot of gadgets to talk about. We're gonna do a lightning round,

42
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,845
Speaker 4:  which is still called the lightning round. Despite the, like I would say,

43
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:53,525
Speaker 4:  surprising enthusiasm of the thunder round fans

44
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:55,925
Speaker 5:  Back, bring it back.

45
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:00,085
Speaker 4:  I believe two things. I believe that all of you are Jake's burners And

46
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:03,245
Speaker 4:  I believe that all of you love the thunder round. And I think that is good

47
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:06,285
Speaker 4:  and beautiful and someday I'll die and Jake can have the thunder round.

48
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:10,505
Speaker 4:  Until then, Jake, we have a lot of gadget news to talk about. Oh,

49
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:13,065
Speaker 5:  It's been a weirdly busy week for

50
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:17,225
Speaker 4:  Gadgets. It has. So the theme of the week, I would say

51
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,705
Speaker 4:  is like gadgets that have been rumored for decade

52
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,825
Speaker 4:  or decades maybe inching closer

53
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:29,065
Speaker 4:  to becoming true. And let me, let me just run down the list and then we're

54
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:32,945
Speaker 4:  gonna kind of hit this one by one. There were a bunch

55
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:36,865
Speaker 4:  of new rumors and speculations and timeline guesses and supply

56
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:40,545
Speaker 4:  chain sources about both a foldable iPhone,

57
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:44,465
Speaker 4:  which the, the general consensus seems to be is going to be

58
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:48,345
Speaker 4:  basically two iPhone errors just stuck together, which is

59
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:51,865
Speaker 4:  kind of what we thought having seen the iPhone air. We

60
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:55,185
Speaker 4:  continue to hear more about touchscreen max, which Apple has been saying

61
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,825
Speaker 4:  pretty loudly for a very long time, is not a thing they're interested in,

62
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,745
Speaker 4:  seems to be a thing they're interested in. Seems like it's real, seems like

63
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:04,265
Speaker 4:  it's coming. We have a bunch of new reporting, particularly from the information

64
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:07,985
Speaker 4:  about what open AI is doing with Johnny Ive and the, the

65
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:12,225
Speaker 4:  io co-brand thing that they're up to. Interesting new hardware coming

66
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,545
Speaker 4:  there. But where I wanna start is with a rumor that you And I have been covering

67
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:19,745
Speaker 4:  legitimately, I think damn near our entire journalism careers. Oh

68
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:23,625
Speaker 4:  yeah. Oh yeah. Which is the combination of Android

69
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,465
Speaker 4:  and Chrome os. Google makes two very successful operating

70
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:31,425
Speaker 4:  systems. One is Android, which runs on phones and TVs and like

71
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:35,185
Speaker 4:  devices everywhere. One is Chrome os, which runs on Chromebooks.

72
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:38,825
Speaker 4:  The middle of those two things. The overlap of the Venn diagram

73
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:43,745
Speaker 4:  is the sort of thing that Google has been talking about for

74
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:47,625
Speaker 4:  forever. And we've heard a bunch of different tries at

75
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,265
Speaker 4:  it. I think there's, we've even seen some evidence of real progress trying

76
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:55,065
Speaker 4:  to combine Android and Chrome os. But this week

77
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,685
Speaker 4:  the news was that Rick Oslo, who runs all of this stuff, he runs devices,

78
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:01,685
Speaker 4:  he runs Android. He is, he's the person in charge of all of the requisite

79
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,485
Speaker 4:  parts to make this happen was at a a Qualcomm event

80
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:09,125
Speaker 4:  talking to I believe Christiano Amon, the CEO of Qualcomm.

81
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:13,165
Speaker 4:  And he said, and I'm quoting, in the past we've always had very

82
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,325
Speaker 4:  different systems between what we're building on PCs and what we're building

83
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:20,125
Speaker 4:  on smartphones. And we've embarked on a project to combine that. We are building

84
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:24,205
Speaker 4:  together a common technical foundations for our products on PCs and desktop

85
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,765
Speaker 4:  operating systems. Jake, how many times would you say we've heard someone

86
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:30,405
Speaker 4:  at Google say roughly that in the last 10 years?

87
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:34,525
Speaker 5:  It feels like it's like every other year because they, they, they say it,

88
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:38,365
Speaker 5:  they're like, we're doing this, it's happening. Chrome Android would be pretty

89
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:42,165
Speaker 5:  interesting. A year goes by, they're like, I have no idea what you're talking

90
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:46,085
Speaker 5:  about. Chrome OS is a wonderful operating system. It's gonna keep going.

91
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:50,245
Speaker 5:  And, And I, they keep forgetting and it feels like

92
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:54,165
Speaker 5:  maybe they're like, no, no, no, it's real. I, I believe it is real this

93
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:58,045
Speaker 5:  time. Why I make this make why? I don't

94
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:01,645
Speaker 5:  know, because they've said it twice in a row. Like that's honestly it like,

95
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:06,005
Speaker 5:  like every other time they just immediately forget. Like they're, the the,

96
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:09,125
Speaker 5:  and it's, it's usually in the past, I feel like it's been like whispers too

97
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:13,445
Speaker 5:  where it'll be like a, it feels like they have like intentionally

98
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:16,965
Speaker 5:  leaked this where they're like, Ooh, something interesting's coming. And

99
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:20,405
Speaker 5:  we're like, it's gonna, it's real. It's happening. And then they're like,

100
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:24,605
Speaker 5:  we, we have one operating system. I don't do we have like,

101
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:28,765
Speaker 5:  this feels like it's real. They ought on stage there. There's a CEO up there.

102
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:32,805
Speaker 5:  It feels legitimate also. Somebody said, where's this

103
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:36,285
Speaker 5:  quote? Yes, I've seen it. It is incredible. Honestly, actually that's,

104
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:41,005
Speaker 5:  that sounds like what you say about like some ancient

105
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:41,565
Speaker 5:  relic.

106
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:44,965
Speaker 5:  I don't know. It also

107
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:48,805
Speaker 4:  That's the inner Jones coming home from a crusader. It's like I've seen it's,

108
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,405
Speaker 4:  it's incredible.

109
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:53,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it is. And it's it, but this is just Chrome os

110
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:55,845
Speaker 5:  that has the Android branding on it instead.

111
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:59,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay, so this is what I wanna talk about. So I think there are, there

112
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,445
Speaker 4:  are two paths forward for this combination, which I, I agree.

113
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:07,405
Speaker 4:  I think is real and and key difference

114
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:10,525
Speaker 4:  I think is plausible this time, right? And this is a lot of stuff we've talked

115
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:13,805
Speaker 4:  about. Arm chips have gotten very good to the point that you can, you can

116
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:17,845
Speaker 4:  run a desktop class experience on top of arm, which is a huge

117
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,845
Speaker 4:  deal if you want to take Android and not

118
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,365
Speaker 4:  completely rebuild it from scratch for desktop PCs, you want something that

119
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:28,285
Speaker 4:  actually like works and is good. I think all of the actual technical

120
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:32,045
Speaker 4:  underpinnings to do that exist, right? Like you can run an ARM-based laptop

121
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:35,165
Speaker 4:  successfully. This is like, it's not an accident that they're doing this

122
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:38,765
Speaker 4:  with Qualcomm, which is leading that in a big way in the like Windows and

123
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,685
Speaker 4:  Android space. But we're getting to the point where the tech to make this

124
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:44,765
Speaker 4:  work In theory kind of works, which was not the case for a long time. But

125
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:48,645
Speaker 4:  there are sort of two paths here. One is basically we are going to

126
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:52,685
Speaker 4:  use sort of the base level Android kernel as the

127
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:55,765
Speaker 4:  infrastructure for all of the rest of this. So rather than having to build

128
00:08:56,385 --> 00:09:00,165
Speaker 4:  two full complete tech stacks, we'll have Chrome os,

129
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:04,005
Speaker 4:  which runs on top of some very base infrastructure of Android. And we'll

130
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:07,045
Speaker 4:  have Android, which runs on top of the very base infrastructure of Android.

131
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:11,885
Speaker 4:  That is like really terrific corporate synergy. That doesn't matter at all

132
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,725
Speaker 4:  to anybody, right? Like fine, build it however the hell you want. No,

133
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:18,685
Speaker 4:  it's, that won't change anybody's actual experience of using the product.

134
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:23,125
Speaker 4:  The other future and the one that Google has sort of poked it

135
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,885
Speaker 4:  wanting to do for a very long time and has even tried some ways to do, is

136
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:31,125
Speaker 4:  actually building a single user facing operating system that is both

137
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:35,205
Speaker 4:  Android and Chrome os. So that whether you're using a laptop or a

138
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:39,085
Speaker 4:  phone or a television, you are using the same operating system with

139
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:42,285
Speaker 4:  the same apps that do the same things everywhere.

140
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,765
Speaker 5:  Which is the dream. That

141
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:44,485
Speaker 4:  Is the dream, right?

142
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:47,285
Speaker 5:  Like that's what you want. Yes. You want to just move from one device to

143
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:51,165
Speaker 5:  the next and everything follows along. And it's

144
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:54,805
Speaker 5:  sort of, it, it's tough for, for Google because they really, I mean

145
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:57,845
Speaker 5:  Chromes is wonderful, But that, that is not like a thing that they have,

146
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:01,645
Speaker 5:  right? Like in the same way that Apple can, you know, move

147
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:05,205
Speaker 5:  your phone calls seamlessly onto your Mac. Like that is an incredible

148
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,765
Speaker 5:  experience. It's completely seamless and

149
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:12,365
Speaker 5:  Google just doesn't have that. I are they gonna get that with Chrome os

150
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:15,085
Speaker 5:  merged with Android? I don't know that they will,

151
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,885
Speaker 5:  but that's like a possibility. And I think that's what what they want to

152
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:19,485
Speaker 5:  pitch here, right?

153
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's why you do it, right? Is to be able to do that kind of thing.

154
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:26,885
Speaker 4:  And this is Samir Samat who runs Android, I

155
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:29,685
Speaker 4:  think this was in July of this year, a couple of months ago,

156
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:34,405
Speaker 4:  basically said those things, I think it was to lance you off

157
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,765
Speaker 4:  a tech radar about this stuff, about why they're wanting to do this stuff

158
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:40,725
Speaker 4:  to actually make it easier for your devices. Not to just do

159
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,845
Speaker 4:  things themselves, but to communicate with each other. And I think this is

160
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:47,845
Speaker 4:  a thing Google has spent a lot of time on, even just simple things like

161
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:51,765
Speaker 4:  Fast Pair with Android, right? Like Google wants to take all of

162
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:55,565
Speaker 4:  the stuff that Apple does with Apple products and let you do it with other

163
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:58,965
Speaker 4:  products. And I think that is In theory a really powerful idea.

164
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:02,845
Speaker 4:  Like if, if you can make something that is that sort of,

165
00:11:03,265 --> 00:11:06,885
Speaker 4:  you know, connected between devices and everything works everywhere and everything

166
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:10,805
Speaker 4:  is optimized, but also transferable, like that's

167
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:13,525
Speaker 4:  the, it's the right idea. That is the thing that we should do. And actually

168
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,605
Speaker 4:  Google is better set up than almost anybody to do it just by virtue the fact

169
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:20,525
Speaker 4:  that it runs Android and everybody already supports Android. The thing

170
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:24,325
Speaker 4:  is, we have seen what it looks like when Google tries to do

171
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:28,285
Speaker 4:  something as simple as run Android apps on Chrome os and it, it both

172
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,285
Speaker 4:  doesn't work and is a bad idea. And I like, I cannot emphasize the

173
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:35,845
Speaker 4:  extent to which those are two different things, right? Like, not only do

174
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:39,405
Speaker 4:  the, are the apps slow and messy and not optimized for the big screen, it

175
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:43,325
Speaker 4:  just kind of sucks. Like running an Android app on a Chromebook

176
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:47,365
Speaker 4:  is a bad user experience. It's nice that it exists, but it is a

177
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:51,125
Speaker 4:  bad user experience. And this is where it's like, I

178
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,885
Speaker 4:  just, I think Google is maybe now for the first time

179
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:58,765
Speaker 4:  reckoning with how hard a project it actually is to make something that

180
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:02,365
Speaker 4:  works everywhere. And it is a full reboot of Chrome OS in particular,

181
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,845
Speaker 4:  not just, we have to make it so that we can run Android on larger screens.

182
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:08,685
Speaker 4:  Like we, that's fine, but that's a totally different thing.

183
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:12,805
Speaker 5:  What's fascinating to me is that this, at this moment, this

184
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:16,685
Speaker 5:  project both feels more possible than ever, right? I think, I think that

185
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:20,165
Speaker 5:  they can probably pretty easily get to a pretty decent

186
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:23,605
Speaker 5:  product and it also feels less important than ever,

187
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,645
Speaker 5:  right? Decks, which is Samsung's desktop version of

188
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:32,245
Speaker 5:  one OS or one ui, whatever, you know, their version of

189
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:35,205
Speaker 5:  Android is. That's been around for years, right?

190
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:39,725
Speaker 5:  It, the idea of putting an, like putting Android

191
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,525
Speaker 5:  into a desktop environment is not new. There's already like traces of that

192
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:47,485
Speaker 5:  in Android. Yep. So, okay, they're gonna put Android on a, a laptop.

193
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:51,285
Speaker 5:  Great. It has windowing, it has apps, it has a browser. I'm sure I can use

194
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:54,605
Speaker 5:  it and it'll be a completely reasonable experience. The same way that I'm,

195
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:58,245
Speaker 5:  I can use iPad OS as a desktop and it's a completely reasonable experience.

196
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,845
Speaker 5:  Turns out there's still a million tiny little things that get in the way

197
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:04,485
Speaker 5:  of it being a really great seamless experience.

198
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,765
Speaker 5:  And I, the desktop also just feels like it is not

199
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:12,925
Speaker 5:  the environment where people are looking for something like new and exciting

200
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:15,485
Speaker 5:  and interesting and different at this moment and

201
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:20,035
Speaker 5:  right. Are they, I I am curious what the competitive

202
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:24,395
Speaker 5:  purpose of this product is going to be. Right? Chrome OS had a very specific

203
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:28,235
Speaker 5:  purpose, right? Laptops are expensive. Chromos came in,

204
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:31,475
Speaker 5:  they're very cheap, they're very affordable. They go into schools, they're

205
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:35,075
Speaker 5:  people's first laptop, they're super easy, they're light, they go, your ghost

206
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:38,555
Speaker 5:  is going on the browser anyway, just use it. What is the point of Android

207
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:40,925
Speaker 5:  as a laptop? I don't know.

208
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:45,085
Speaker 4:  I don't either. And I, I think this is the thing that I am

209
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:49,005
Speaker 4:  increasingly hung up on because again, I, I like, I start

210
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:52,605
Speaker 4:  at this process and I'm like, okay, if you take all the things that I like

211
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,045
Speaker 4:  about Android, right? The, the huge app ecosystem, the

212
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:59,645
Speaker 4:  portability, the good battery optimization, like take all that stuff and

213
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:03,005
Speaker 4:  give me full desktop class Chrome.

214
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:07,815
Speaker 4:  I'm like, sick, that is, that is pretty close to all of the things that I

215
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:11,655
Speaker 4:  want. But then it's like, okay, well what, what hardware do I wanna

216
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:15,615
Speaker 4:  run that on all day? Do you want a thing that looks like a touchscreen

217
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:18,655
Speaker 4:  laptop? Should it be a detachable thing? Should it be like a tablet with

218
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:22,375
Speaker 4:  a great keyboard attachment? And and all of a sudden

219
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:26,215
Speaker 4:  it's like, oh, actually this bet that Google, and as

220
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:29,775
Speaker 4:  we're gonna talk about it in a minute, apple are making, is that actually

221
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:32,695
Speaker 4:  everything should do, everything means

222
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:36,815
Speaker 4:  by default, whatever piece of hardware you buy is going to make a bunch of

223
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:40,695
Speaker 4:  compromises on a bunch of weird usability things. And the idea of

224
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:45,175
Speaker 4:  a laptop that runs Android apps sounds good,

225
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,985
Speaker 4:  but kind of falls apart as soon as you start using it. Which anybody who

226
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:52,925
Speaker 4:  has used Chromos in recent years can tell you. And then on the flip

227
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,725
Speaker 4:  side, like if, if I had full honest to God desktop class

228
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:59,365
Speaker 4:  Chrome on my phone, I don't think that would change anything about my experience

229
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,565
Speaker 4:  using an Android phone. No. And so I I'm, I'm just stuck in this place where

230
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:06,125
Speaker 4:  it's like, yes, I want this thing. And I think the idea of saying we want

231
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,565
Speaker 4:  make it easier for you to do things like move

232
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:13,885
Speaker 4:  files between devices and move, take a phone call on your computer

233
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:17,365
Speaker 4:  and then move it to your phone. Like all of these sort of little usability

234
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:20,245
Speaker 4:  things, I think make a lot of sense. But the idea that there is some

235
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:24,845
Speaker 4:  huge new idea about how we use our devices at the end of this road,

236
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,925
Speaker 4:  I used to believe that, And I'm kind of less and less convinced of it all

237
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:29,165
Speaker 4:  the time.

238
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,805
Speaker 5:  I, I, I think I agree with you, right? Do I

239
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:36,405
Speaker 5:  think they can do this? Do I think that it'll be a completely reasonable

240
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:40,125
Speaker 5:  experience? Absolutely. It's, it's, it's basically there.

241
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:43,925
Speaker 5:  It's not, I I don't think it is going to be a huge challenge for 'em to make

242
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:47,565
Speaker 5:  this happen, but as far as I can see, I don't see a world where this ends

243
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:51,085
Speaker 5:  up as anything other than, okay, now I have an option of getting

244
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:55,485
Speaker 5:  a Dell Premium plus with Android instead of Windows.

245
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:59,765
Speaker 5:  And I think for the average shopper, why are you gonna get it with

246
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:00,165
Speaker 5:  Android?

247
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:04,565
Speaker 4:  I do wonder if all of these companies are still hell bent on the

248
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:07,765
Speaker 4:  idea that if we can just do all of this right.

249
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:12,285
Speaker 4:  Tablets will become the thing I really like. I I really do think that, I

250
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:15,925
Speaker 4:  think, I think Apple continues to believe that if we can just

251
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:20,045
Speaker 4:  turn these three knobs the right way, everybody will

252
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,085
Speaker 4:  want an iPad as their main computer because it is so versatile, because it

253
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:26,925
Speaker 4:  can do so many things. Because it is kind of the, the, you know,

254
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:30,805
Speaker 4:  it's 80% of a phone and 80% of a computer. And that is like a very powerful

255
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:34,645
Speaker 4:  idea. They're like, if we can just solve these little things, we can just

256
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,405
Speaker 4:  do the menu bar, right? We'll put the stoplight in the thing and we'll let

257
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:40,765
Speaker 4:  you window that's gonna make you wanna use it as your main computer. And,

258
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:44,405
Speaker 4:  and it goes to what you said, it's, it's that, and then it's a million little

259
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:48,085
Speaker 4:  things about how I use these devices and live my life. And

260
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,965
Speaker 4:  Android is even wor, I mean, nobody has ever made an Android tablet that

261
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:51,925
Speaker 4:  has been compelling to anyone.

262
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:56,205
Speaker 5:  About a month ago, my MacBook just like suddenly died. And so I was

263
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:59,645
Speaker 5:  like, you know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna use my iPad. And, and you

264
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,445
Speaker 5:  know, I was on the iOS 26 beta, so I had all the new

265
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:06,765
Speaker 5:  windowing stuff, the beauty of Liquid Glass.

266
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:11,445
Speaker 5:  I got a keyboard, I got a mouse all good. And yeah,

267
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:15,445
Speaker 5:  all it like, it, it is, it's incredible how close the experience gets,

268
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:19,285
Speaker 5:  right? I have Windows, it, it has multiple displays.

269
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,965
Speaker 5:  I'm using a mouse and keyboard, I'm tabbing between apps

270
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:28,005
Speaker 5:  and then they're just basic keyboard shortcuts that don't work. Hmm.

271
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:31,885
Speaker 5:  Right. There's basic ways of controlling files that

272
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,125
Speaker 5:  I'm just like not capable of. And it's just these like little things every

273
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:39,405
Speaker 5:  like, you know, 30 seconds that are slowing me down a

274
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:42,725
Speaker 5:  little bit and a little bit and a little bit. And I, I think like

275
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:47,255
Speaker 5:  with Apple, I, I, I sort of see that a little bit more, right?

276
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:51,085
Speaker 5:  There are so many people who are iPhone first, it

277
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:54,925
Speaker 5:  makes sense to, to make a desktop that is very familiar to them

278
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:59,365
Speaker 5:  with Android, you know, the, the, there is a

279
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:03,085
Speaker 5:  default version of that for PCs And I think it is just Windows.

280
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:06,965
Speaker 5:  And I, I think if you are a Windows user, I don't know that you're looking

281
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,965
Speaker 5:  to change. I don't know what you're going to get out of this.

282
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:14,245
Speaker 4:  What's interesting is, I think, I think your your your point about how

283
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:17,325
Speaker 4:  there are a lot of people who like their first experiences than iPhone. I

284
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:20,245
Speaker 4:  think it's globally vastly more true with Android, right? Like there are

285
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:24,045
Speaker 4:  that's true Many more people who only have one device who use Android than

286
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:28,005
Speaker 4:  who use iOS. Like that's just true. But I think we're

287
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:32,045
Speaker 4:  also at a point now where like, I, I actually think Google might have had

288
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:36,005
Speaker 4:  a much better shot at this the first time it tried to do it, you

289
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,405
Speaker 4:  know, that were 10 years ago. But I think you, you look at it now and it's

290
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:43,325
Speaker 4:  like this, this whole sort of globe filled with people who

291
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:46,565
Speaker 4:  came online in like the, the late aughts and early

292
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:50,005
Speaker 4:  2010s that like huge rush of the smartphone market.

293
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,965
Speaker 4:  Those people now have entrenched behaviors. We've been doing this a long

294
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:57,765
Speaker 4:  time now. Yeah. The idea that there are, we can like retrain everyone how

295
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:01,685
Speaker 4:  to do new things was way more true 10 years ago than

296
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:04,525
Speaker 4:  it is now, right? Like I, the the example people always give me, And I really

297
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:07,805
Speaker 4:  like, is the, the Cordy keyboard, like the Cordy keyboard is, is bad

298
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:12,085
Speaker 4:  in, in every meaningful way. It is not the optimal keyboard

299
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:15,565
Speaker 4:  layout except we've all been using it for this long and it's not worth the

300
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:19,085
Speaker 4:  hassle to switch. And so I think this kind of thing where it's like, okay,

301
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:23,085
Speaker 4:  what if my laptop is, is also just a

302
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:26,885
Speaker 4:  collection of apps that, And I don't have a files

303
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:30,685
Speaker 4:  app and where do I download things like that stuff is entrenched now.

304
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:34,245
Speaker 4:  And, and even for the people for whom it was not, when Google first started

305
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:37,565
Speaker 4:  thinking about this, it is now. And so all this stuff like

306
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:41,285
Speaker 4:  Google did write about Chrome os, which has put everything in the browser

307
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:44,405
Speaker 4:  and make everything that, that actually runs against all of the things that

308
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:47,085
Speaker 4:  they're trying to do with Android. And so these things have just been so

309
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,365
Speaker 4:  far apart now that I think even if you can successfully put them together,

310
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:54,165
Speaker 4:  I don't know that that's actually the user behavior people are looking for.

311
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:57,885
Speaker 5:  Well, and to your point, you know, there, there absolutely is like a good

312
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:02,605
Speaker 5:  reason to be able to plug your Android phone into a

313
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:05,525
Speaker 5:  monitor and boom, now it's a desktop experience, right? If that's your only

314
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:09,005
Speaker 5:  device, that's, that's amazing. Sure. That's a, that's a huge upgrade for

315
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:12,245
Speaker 5:  the average person. What drives me crazy here is it's like, oh, okay, so

316
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:16,125
Speaker 5:  Google wants to do, wants to be able to do what Apple does where you can

317
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,405
Speaker 5:  seamlessly move between your phone and your laptop,

318
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:24,085
Speaker 5:  but they don't have, they don't control the operating system. So

319
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:27,205
Speaker 5:  somehow they need a piece of software that is on every single computer in

320
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:30,325
Speaker 5:  the world that allows you to move stuff from Android to your computer. Oh

321
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:34,205
Speaker 5:  wait, that's Google Chrome. Yeah. Everyone uses it just

322
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:38,245
Speaker 5:  Right. I don't understand why to this day

323
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:42,445
Speaker 5:  there is basically no, I, I mean I can't think of any communication between

324
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:46,645
Speaker 5:  my Pixel and Google Chrome, right? If Google Chrome could send

325
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:50,485
Speaker 5:  my notifications from Android, what an upgrade that would be, right?

326
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:54,125
Speaker 5:  If Google Chrome could take my calls from my Android phone, what, why can't

327
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:58,045
Speaker 5:  it do any of this? The, this is what is mind-boggling to

328
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:58,165
Speaker 5:  me.

329
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:01,965
Speaker 4:  I do think it's possible that you might have just pretty neatly described

330
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:05,765
Speaker 4:  the ideal outcome of this combination. Because like, if, if you take

331
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:09,885
Speaker 4:  it, it is Android, but it is the exact Chrome that runs

332
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,285
Speaker 4:  on your computer, which is essentially what ChromeOS is, right? Like it is,

333
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:16,485
Speaker 4:  it is an op a kind of janky file system built around

334
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:21,125
Speaker 4:  the full feature and arguably the best version of the Chrome

335
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,965
Speaker 4:  browser. And if you just, if you just do that

336
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:29,645
Speaker 4:  on top of Android in such a way that it is, it actually communicates

337
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:33,325
Speaker 4:  between devices, that would be amazing. It, like anybody who

338
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:37,365
Speaker 4:  uses Desktop Chrome on two computers can tell you, even that sucks,

339
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:41,605
Speaker 4:  right? Like, if, if I have a tab on my computer And I wanna look at it

340
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:44,725
Speaker 4:  on my other computer, there's a strong chance that's not gonna work the way

341
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,085
Speaker 4:  that it's supposed to. But like,

342
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:46,965
Speaker 5:  This

343
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:49,805
Speaker 4:  Is the thing, the idea, you're right about the idea it's

344
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:53,205
Speaker 5:  Close, it's, it's that that is their operating system. Yes. Right. Why

345
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:56,805
Speaker 5:  I don't understand, I don't understand why Chrome is so

346
00:21:57,505 --> 00:22:00,925
Speaker 5:  siloed in that way when there's so much power

347
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:05,125
Speaker 5:  they could add to it and they, they have just like done nothing

348
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:09,085
Speaker 5:  there. And instead we've just for, for again, like for

349
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,445
Speaker 5:  a decade heard about how Android and Chrome OS might come together,

350
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:16,765
Speaker 5:  And I, it's just, it is fully unclear to me what problem this solves other

351
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:20,605
Speaker 5:  than perhaps simplifying some engineering structure

352
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:21,605
Speaker 5:  inside Google.

353
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:26,205
Speaker 4:  Sure. Yeah. If thi if this is a way to lay off a bunch of now redundant

354
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:29,725
Speaker 4:  end engineers, then that sucks And I don't care. Right?

355
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:33,845
Speaker 4:  I think I, it remains to ve seen, but Google is certainly, I think you're

356
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:37,555
Speaker 4:  right, making enough noise about this, that if they don't

357
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:41,035
Speaker 4:  ship something, it's gonna be the most embarrassing version of this. Yes.

358
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:41,395
Speaker 4:  Yet

359
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:45,595
Speaker 5:  I, I think we are going to get a couple of like iffy

360
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:49,395
Speaker 5:  Android laptops and then we are going to forget about this. Yeah. That is

361
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:52,115
Speaker 5:  my, this might be shortsighted prediction, But that, that is what this feels

362
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:52,715
Speaker 5:  like. Well in

363
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:56,635
Speaker 4:  The context of all of this is Google made a big effort

364
00:22:56,735 --> 00:22:59,715
Speaker 4:  in the Pixel book line, made a couple of really great devices and then stopped

365
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:03,595
Speaker 4:  making them. Yeah. And, and this would be, I mean just the, the

366
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:07,195
Speaker 4:  50000th pivot for Google's hardware ambitions. So like,

367
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:11,835
Speaker 4:  we'll see, let's talk about Apple for a second. On, on the topic of

368
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:16,315
Speaker 4:  convergence touchscreen MacBook, does this, does this

369
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:19,315
Speaker 4:  do anything for you? It seems, it seems real. I think we're gonna get it.

370
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:23,715
Speaker 5:  I, okay. I always thought people were ridiculous. They'd be like, oh my God,

371
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:27,275
Speaker 5:  I've been using my iPad so much that I started swiping on my MacBook. Ha

372
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:31,075
Speaker 5:  ha ha. And then I did it the other day and I'm just like, oh, shoot, they're

373
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:35,035
Speaker 5:  all right. A hundred percent right. It's just,

374
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:39,475
Speaker 5:  I I think when Apple started with this position

375
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:43,275
Speaker 5:  that they were like, it doesn't make sense to have a touchscreen and a laptop.

376
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:46,500
Speaker 5:  Like they're, they're, they're basically Right. It is true. It's

377
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,990
Speaker 4:  Not. Yeah. The gorilla arm thing is real. Yeah.

378
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It is real. And I think back, back in the day, it's like, yeah, like

379
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:55,405
Speaker 5:  that's not a standard mode of interaction. And nowadays I think it's, it's

380
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:58,845
Speaker 5:  just so expected that it's actually weird that the MacBook doesn't have that.

381
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,925
Speaker 5:  And I think like particularly as new users start to try these things

382
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:06,445
Speaker 5:  out, like is it's kind of just bewildering. Why, why wouldn't you?

383
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:10,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. My experience has been, I use my computer

384
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:14,285
Speaker 4:  really differently when I'm just using it versus when it's like a social

385
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,565
Speaker 4:  thing, if that makes sense. So like

386
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:16,125
Speaker 5:  That's very true.

387
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:19,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah. If I'm, if you And I are doing something together, being able to

388
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:23,525
Speaker 4:  reach out and scroll the page or, or that we can both do it.

389
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:27,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Is is actually like cool and valuable and important. And

390
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:29,525
Speaker 4:  I've been thinking about this a lot because we've been, we spent the summer

391
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:33,085
Speaker 4:  house hunting and so like my life was just sending Zillow links back and

392
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:36,725
Speaker 4:  forth to my wife and really being able to sit there and like

393
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,605
Speaker 4:  scroll around and tap on things and, and move stuff around together is really

394
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:43,365
Speaker 4:  valuable. And it's like, there, there's a piece of the iPad experience that

395
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,925
Speaker 4:  is really nice that it is like a device you can put on the table in front

396
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:49,805
Speaker 4:  of two people and sort of use together in a way that a laptop is

397
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:53,565
Speaker 4:  not that at all. Like, I, you And I cannot use a laptop together in any

398
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:57,455
Speaker 4:  kind of like functional way. So just,

399
00:24:57,565 --> 00:25:01,415
Speaker 4:  just for that reason alone, I think a touchscreen Mac

400
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:02,695
Speaker 4:  becomes really interesting.

401
00:25:04,265 --> 00:25:08,215
Speaker 4:  There is a way in which everybody overshoots this and

402
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,615
Speaker 4:  it becomes hugely problematic, right? That like, suddenly it's like, okay,

403
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:15,495
Speaker 4:  what we actually want on the Mac is to run all of your iPad apps in

404
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:19,335
Speaker 4:  a native feeling way on the screen. And that's where the whole

405
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:23,015
Speaker 4:  like, do you really wanna sit there and draw on a screen with the

406
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:27,055
Speaker 4:  stylus on a, on a floppy laptop? Like that's a bad idea. So

407
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:29,895
Speaker 4:  it's like, there, there are a lot of ways this could go sideways, but I think

408
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:34,015
Speaker 4:  just the, the basic theory of it is exactly a Mac, but it has

409
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:37,855
Speaker 4:  a touchscreen. I'm actually into way more so

410
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:40,935
Speaker 4:  than like, let's figure out the exact middle of iPad and Mac for all the

411
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:41,815
Speaker 4:  reasons we were just talking about.

412
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:45,455
Speaker 5:  Completely agree. That's that's all I want. I just want to occasionally be

413
00:25:45,455 --> 00:25:49,415
Speaker 5:  able to scroll a webpage with my finger, like that's which I is

414
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:53,015
Speaker 5:  not revolutionary, but I also don't think this tech is that expensive or

415
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:56,855
Speaker 5:  hard for them to implement at this point in time. It, it just, why

416
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,935
Speaker 5:  not? They've also, I think if you look at what they've been doing on the

417
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:03,975
Speaker 5:  iPad to make the iPad a little bit more Mac like, but work with touch, it's

418
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:07,255
Speaker 5:  like they, they've, they've got the user interface figured out. They can

419
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:09,375
Speaker 5:  bring this to the Mac. It's not gonna be that hard at this point.

420
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:13,375
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And there's like, by the time there's a menu bar and the

421
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,575
Speaker 4:  stoplight menu on an iPad, you've run out of excuses to be like, oh, the

422
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,335
Speaker 4:  toch targets. Like, no, I don't, no one cares. It's gonna be fine. Yeah.

423
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:23,375
Speaker 4:  Last thing we should talk about here before we get away from future gadgets

424
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,015
Speaker 4:  that may or may not exist. So interesting reporting this week from the

425
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,375
Speaker 4:  information about what OpenAI and Johnny Iver up to

426
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:34,295
Speaker 4:  suggesting that basically you, you can look at this news

427
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:38,095
Speaker 4:  a couple of ways. One is they have a bunch of really interesting ideas. They

428
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:41,135
Speaker 4:  might be building a smart speaker to put Chacha PT into. They might be developing

429
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:43,565
Speaker 4:  AI glasses, they're thinking about a voice recorder, they're thinking about

430
00:26:43,565 --> 00:26:43,925
Speaker 4:  a pin.

431
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:48,495
Speaker 4:  That's one way of looking at it. Big ambitions, interesting project. They're

432
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:51,615
Speaker 4:  doing lots of hardware. The other way of looking at it is none of them have

433
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:54,055
Speaker 4:  any idea what to do. So they're just trying everybody else's ideas. They're

434
00:26:54,055 --> 00:26:56,495
Speaker 4:  gonna build all of the things and put JY bt into it and be like, is this

435
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:58,545
Speaker 4:  anything? It's it's one of those,

436
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,545
Speaker 5:  No. Yeah. This is, I would say this is does not inspire confidence, right?

437
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:05,905
Speaker 5:  I I think like when, when they came out and it's like, you know, Johnny and

438
00:27:05,905 --> 00:27:09,305
Speaker 5:  Sam, they're like, we've, we've got a vision. We understand what the future

439
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:13,345
Speaker 5:  of AI hardware is and all those other guys are fools. And if they, they keep

440
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:16,465
Speaker 5:  up that vision, maybe I'll believe them. But this, this reporting suggesting

441
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:20,265
Speaker 5:  that they're tinkering with a bunch of different things. No one has any idea,

442
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:24,465
Speaker 5:  right? Yeah. That we are just going all the way back to the Alexa

443
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:28,065
Speaker 5:  era where Amazon was just like, Alexa in a clock.

444
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:32,225
Speaker 5:  Alexa in a fridge Alexa. Yes. And, and

445
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:36,185
Speaker 5:  you're like, I, I guess a And it, yes, it,

446
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:39,745
Speaker 5:  it does make sense to put Chay bt in some sort of hardware.

447
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:43,505
Speaker 5:  Is it going to be more revolutionary than an Echo speaker?

448
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:48,225
Speaker 5:  I'm not, I'm not sure if there is something out there. And it sure seems

449
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:49,145
Speaker 5:  like maybe they don't either.

450
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:53,345
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I remember when the IO news first came out that Johnny,

451
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:56,865
Speaker 4:  Ivan Open AI were working on some hardware together. There were, there were

452
00:27:56,905 --> 00:28:00,505
Speaker 4:  a lot of sort of different pieces of, of information out there. And

453
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:05,065
Speaker 4:  a lot of folks arrived at sort of the same basic idea of what these

454
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:08,145
Speaker 4:  two were probably making together, which was like a, a little

455
00:28:08,935 --> 00:28:12,785
Speaker 4:  sort of, I don't know, portable sized speaker that you, you

456
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:16,185
Speaker 4:  can, that has a doc that you put it into when you're at your desk and you

457
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:19,345
Speaker 4:  can use it that way. It can be a, a home speaker that you talk to or you

458
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:21,785
Speaker 4:  can like, you know, clip it to your body and wear it around your neck or

459
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:25,625
Speaker 4:  something. So like the idea is that it is a little, a little speaker

460
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:29,305
Speaker 4:  microphone device that then attaches to a bunch of different things. It becomes

461
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:32,985
Speaker 4:  a bunch of different other things. Interesting idea, like you said, been

462
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:36,505
Speaker 4:  done a thousand times by a thousand companies integrating Google Assistant

463
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:39,905
Speaker 4:  and Alexa, like Harman Cardin is out there making this stuff. Yes. You know

464
00:28:39,905 --> 00:28:43,825
Speaker 4:  what I mean? Like that it's just, it's not smart speakers are an

465
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:48,025
Speaker 4:  old idea and they've been a very successful idea, but they're not, this is

466
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:51,785
Speaker 4:  not some like, hugely new novel swing at the

467
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:55,905
Speaker 4:  hardware. And then to look at it and just say, okay, AI glasses, voice

468
00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:58,345
Speaker 4:  recorder pin. Do you know what those three things are? Those are the only

469
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:01,265
Speaker 4:  ideas anybody else has about how these things are supposed to work. Like,

470
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:05,665
Speaker 4:  there, like you said, there are, there is nothing hugely novel

471
00:29:05,775 --> 00:29:09,265
Speaker 4:  here, except I do think it's possible that this

472
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:12,905
Speaker 4:  combination of Johnny Ive and the love from team

473
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:16,785
Speaker 4:  and all of the, like access they'll have to OpenAI

474
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:19,585
Speaker 4:  means they can do it better. Right. And if there, there's a, there's a real

475
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:22,865
Speaker 4:  lesson in like, apple spent a lot of time doing other people's ideas a lot

476
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:26,705
Speaker 4:  better than the rest of them. Maybe that's it. But this, like you said, this

477
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:30,505
Speaker 4:  does not fill me with like gleeful joy about big new

478
00:29:30,545 --> 00:29:31,145
Speaker 4:  ideas they have.

479
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:34,345
Speaker 5:  Well, and that's where it gets really interesting, right? Okay. Let's say

480
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:38,065
Speaker 5:  they make the, the nicest hardware in the market

481
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:42,045
Speaker 5:  for smart glasses. And let's say that chat GBD continues

482
00:29:42,045 --> 00:29:45,445
Speaker 5:  to be the best AI assistant. Th both of these things seem

483
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:47,085
Speaker 5:  very, very plausible to me.

484
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:52,625
Speaker 5:  Does that still mean anything if they cannot get native access to your

485
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:56,465
Speaker 5:  phone? Right. Likes Great question. Ultimately that is still where

486
00:29:56,765 --> 00:30:00,385
Speaker 5:  all your data lives. And if they're going to make a brand new

487
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:04,505
Speaker 5:  platform from scratch, even if you are the company behind chat GPT,

488
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:08,265
Speaker 5:  that is still a big uphill battle. And the AI era

489
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:12,505
Speaker 5:  has very much been a moment of upstarts being able to break

490
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:15,985
Speaker 5:  through by being able to do a bunch of things that these smartphones could

491
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:19,505
Speaker 5:  do without relying on them. But as soon as you

492
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:23,585
Speaker 5:  become a piece of hardware, you need to be able to do more for people.

493
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:27,705
Speaker 5:  You need to be able to do things that obfuscate

494
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:31,625
Speaker 5:  their phone. And it is not clear if they will be able to

495
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:35,465
Speaker 5:  do that in a way that, you know, apple will, even if they don't have

496
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:36,745
Speaker 5:  the best AI assistant

497
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:40,345
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They can connect to the internet. Like it's, yeah, it's such a simple

498
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:43,785
Speaker 4:  thing, right? Like I I, they don't charge me extra to connect to the internet

499
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:47,785
Speaker 4:  is going to be a big hurdle for anyone other than your phone maker

500
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:51,105
Speaker 4:  to climb. I totally agree. And so we, we shouldn't dwell on this 'cause we're

501
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:54,025
Speaker 4:  gonna have actually a lot to talk about in this space next week. Amazon's

502
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:57,945
Speaker 4:  having an event, I believe on Tuesday where we think they're

503
00:30:57,945 --> 00:31:01,745
Speaker 4:  gonna reveal like whatever the next generation of Alexa hardware

504
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:05,225
Speaker 4:  is. This has been teased for a while. Panos Pane is up to stuff. We'll see

505
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:08,905
Speaker 4:  what they're doing. The Google Gemini Smart

506
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:12,905
Speaker 4:  Home stuff is all kicking off next week. So this idea of like non

507
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:16,785
Speaker 4:  phone devices doing AI things is

508
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:19,865
Speaker 4:  spinning up in a pretty big way. And I think we're, we're gonna see a lot

509
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:23,305
Speaker 4:  of new ideas about how all of this stuff works or we're gonna see that actually

510
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:26,425
Speaker 4:  no one has any new ideas about any of this stuff works,

511
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:30,185
Speaker 4:  but that's coming next week. So we, we should, let's, let's come back to

512
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:33,785
Speaker 4:  all this open AI stuff in a week and see who is actually having the most

513
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:37,745
Speaker 4:  interesting theories about any of this. We need to take a break because

514
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,145
Speaker 4:  we have TikTok stuff to talk about. And we cannot let this first cast be

515
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:43,825
Speaker 4:  19 hours long. So we're gonna take a break. We're gonna get Liz

516
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,725
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. Liz Lipato ISS joining us. Hi Liz.

517
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:43,325
Speaker 11:  Hey, how's it going guys?

518
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:46,645
Speaker 4:  Liz, show us the cat. This is, this is the only reason you're here. Show,

519
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,325
Speaker 4:  show us the cat.

520
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,245
Speaker 11:  Oh, okay. Here's Jevs.

521
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:51,535
Speaker 5:  Oh, hey Jevs.

522
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:53,025
Speaker 11:  She's a good girl.

523
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:57,225
Speaker 4:  Jevs is going to be responsible for the low grade rumbling you hear for the

524
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:58,665
Speaker 4:  rest of this podcast. That's

525
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:02,545
Speaker 11:  Chiefs. Yeah, so she is, she is a little disgusted

526
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:06,265
Speaker 11:  with me and has moved from my lap to my feet where that's now where she's

527
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,065
Speaker 11:  sitting. So you may not hear the purring.

528
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:11,665
Speaker 4:  I like this for her. Alright, so you're here to talk about TikTok. And again,

529
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:15,505
Speaker 4:  just to, just to timestamp us right now a little bit, it is 11 o'clock

530
00:36:15,505 --> 00:36:19,345
Speaker 4:  in the morning on Thursday. And this is not normally

531
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,385
Speaker 4:  an important piece of information, but I, there is a decent chance that between

532
00:36:22,405 --> 00:36:26,385
Speaker 4:  now and when you hear this or watch this, there will have been

533
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:30,065
Speaker 4:  a executive order from the Trump administration from the White House about

534
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:33,985
Speaker 4:  a TikTok deal. But I think, and Liz, you, you should correct me if I'm wrong,

535
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:37,065
Speaker 4:  right up at the top, I think we know enough about what is about to happen,

536
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:41,145
Speaker 4:  that we can talk about it. It feels like we've, we've gotten most of the

537
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:44,025
Speaker 4:  information about whatever we're gonna know

538
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:46,885
Speaker 4:  that we can talk about it. Do you agree with that?

539
00:36:48,715 --> 00:36:52,275
Speaker 11:  I also wanna add something to the timestamp, which is that it, okay, eight

540
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:56,035
Speaker 11:  o'clock in the morning And I have had a bunch of caffeine on an empty stomach,

541
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,955
Speaker 11:  so I feel beautiful and I'm gonna live forever

542
00:36:58,265 --> 00:36:59,235
Speaker 4:  Peak, Liz, let's go,

543
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:02,795
Speaker 11:  Let's go. So here's the thing. We have some details about the deal, right?

544
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:06,715
Speaker 11:  Like we, we know that there's a consortium, it's like Oracle

545
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:10,155
Speaker 11:  Andreesen, Horowitz, Susquehanna International Group.

546
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:14,035
Speaker 11:  I think maybe even like the Murdochs are involved somehow,

547
00:37:15,495 --> 00:37:19,075
Speaker 11:  and like Bite Dance retains around 20% and gets

548
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:21,355
Speaker 11:  diluted. We know,

549
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:26,915
Speaker 11:  gosh, what else do we know? We know that like the algorithm gets moved or

550
00:37:26,915 --> 00:37:30,595
Speaker 11:  changed away from Chinese control. Question mark, question mark,

551
00:37:30,835 --> 00:37:33,595
Speaker 11:  question mark. 'cause wasn't that the valuable thing? Question mark, question

552
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:34,675
Speaker 11:  mark, question mark. Let's

553
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:37,715
Speaker 4:  Put a pin in that because I would argue that is actually not a thing we know

554
00:37:37,775 --> 00:37:41,355
Speaker 4:  and is hugely important. So let, let's come back to that. Phenomenal at,

555
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:42,315
Speaker 4:  at the end here. But

556
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:46,035
Speaker 11:  Like, even if none of this is permanent, I still think we're pretty

557
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:49,235
Speaker 11:  justified in talking about it because I just wanna do like a quick speed

558
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:52,635
Speaker 11:  round because we've been talking about the divestiture of

559
00:37:53,015 --> 00:37:56,995
Speaker 11:  TikTok for like five years now at least. So how many

560
00:37:57,715 --> 00:38:00,715
Speaker 11:  previous buyers do you guys remember go? Ooh,

561
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:06,235
Speaker 5:  I I feel like there was like a possibility of Microsoft at one point.

562
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:11,915
Speaker 4:  Oracle came up the first time. Yeah, that's another one. I know there was

563
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,195
Speaker 4:  another one, but those are the only two that are immediately coming to mind.

564
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:18,075
Speaker 5:  Perplexity pretended they were gonna buy it, I think. Oh yeah,

565
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:19,715
Speaker 5:  perplexity. Did Pinterest ever make a

566
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,275
Speaker 11:  Bid? My personal favorite was Walmart.

567
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:24,155
Speaker 11:  Oh, that's

568
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:24,315
Speaker 5:  Good.

569
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:27,555
Speaker 11:  So just with that background in mind,

570
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:30,235
Speaker 5:  This is a very serious Yeah. Venture.

571
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:34,675
Speaker 11:  We're gonna discuss this deal. I, I, I hesitate to tell you how serious

572
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:37,965
Speaker 11:  it is because like, honestly, I don't, I don't know. I don't know.

573
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:41,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So, okay. Can you give us the like

574
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:45,605
Speaker 4:  62nd version of the last five years? Because it, it's, as

575
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:49,285
Speaker 4:  we get to something that might seem like the end of this

576
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,445
Speaker 4:  story, I think it's useful to go back to the beginning of this story, which

577
00:38:52,445 --> 00:38:55,925
Speaker 4:  started in the first Trump administration. Can you just walk us through it

578
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:56,245
Speaker 4:  a little bit?

579
00:38:56,675 --> 00:39:00,605
Speaker 11:  Okay. So we have this like panic about China that's like

580
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:04,445
Speaker 11:  coming up in, you know, during the first Trump administration. And this

581
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:08,045
Speaker 11:  Chinese app has a hole on the nation's youngsters and it's

582
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:11,885
Speaker 11:  terrifying. And who knows what they're doing with their data,

583
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:15,885
Speaker 11:  which like PS for every like country outside of the US

584
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:19,765
Speaker 11:  is what the US is doing with Facebook and Instagram

585
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,965
Speaker 11:  and any, all of these other apps, but whatever, whatever. So there's

586
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:27,245
Speaker 11:  legislation that it has to be sold or it's gonna get banned and then it's

587
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:31,165
Speaker 11:  not sold. And we have these sort of like procession of investors

588
00:39:31,195 --> 00:39:35,045
Speaker 11:  that we had talked through, right? You know, the, the

589
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:38,885
Speaker 11:  maybe deals with Microsoft and Walmart and

590
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:42,565
Speaker 11:  Oracle And I, I'm probably missing a couple.

591
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:47,605
Speaker 11:  And anyway, Donald Trump comes into office as we hit the deadline.

592
00:39:47,945 --> 00:39:51,685
Speaker 11:  And if I remember right, TikTok actually, it's pulled from a bunch of

593
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:55,565
Speaker 11:  app stores because it's like not legal to have

594
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:58,445
Speaker 11:  TikTok in your app store anymore. And so

595
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:03,125
Speaker 11:  then we enter this bizarre territory of like,

596
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:08,805
Speaker 11:  Donald Trump's like, well, we're gonna extend the deadline And

597
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:12,765
Speaker 11:  I promise nobody's gonna prosecute anybody for this

598
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:17,445
Speaker 11:  so you can put it back in the app store. 'cause I guess in the intervening

599
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:20,405
Speaker 11:  years he's changed his mind about TikTok and he loves it now, I don't know.

600
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:25,605
Speaker 11:  And so we've had this deadline that just keeps getting pushed back and

601
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:29,405
Speaker 11:  pushed back. It's like 90 day deadlines where it keeps being

602
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:32,925
Speaker 11:  like another 90 days. Another 90 days,

603
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:35,725
Speaker 11:  which like, by the way,

604
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:41,165
Speaker 11:  I don't know that that's legal either. Like, I don't know that that is

605
00:40:41,345 --> 00:40:41,565
Speaker 11:  how

606
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:45,725
Speaker 11:  anything works in this country, but it seems to be how things work in this

607
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:46,325
Speaker 11:  country now.

608
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:52,165
Speaker 11:  Cool. So that's where we are, is this, you

609
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:54,885
Speaker 11:  know, like this deadline has come up, it's been pushed back another time

610
00:40:55,105 --> 00:40:58,405
Speaker 11:  and we're getting these details of like, this time it's real. This time

611
00:40:58,405 --> 00:40:59,525
Speaker 11:  we have this consortium investors

612
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:04,685
Speaker 11:  and we're, we're really gonna get it done. We're gonna get some stuff signed.

613
00:41:04,905 --> 00:41:08,445
Speaker 11:  And then most recently we've heard about this Oracle deal with this consortium

614
00:41:08,545 --> 00:41:09,125
Speaker 11:  of investors,

615
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:13,365
Speaker 4:  Right? So the the biggest thing I wanna talk about with you in particular

616
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:17,405
Speaker 4:  is this consortium of investors. Because I think I I,

617
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:20,965
Speaker 4:  in a certain way, if, if the Trump administration had just sold

618
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:25,685
Speaker 4:  TikTok to Microsoft, which is like an insane sentence to say out loud,

619
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:29,525
Speaker 4:  but if that had just happened, I think I would, I would understand the dynamic,

620
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,085
Speaker 4:  right? It's like whether this solves the problem that

621
00:41:33,605 --> 00:41:35,885
Speaker 4:  Congress is worried about or that everyone claims they're trying to solve

622
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:40,005
Speaker 4:  debatable, and we should talk about that. But it it, like one big company

623
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:43,805
Speaker 4:  buys this other big company is like, I, I understand that this feels

624
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:47,325
Speaker 4:  different and it feels like it's being done differently. And specifically

625
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:51,005
Speaker 4:  this group of people that are going to be in charge of this app

626
00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:55,245
Speaker 4:  now, which like you mentioned includes Oracle, which is run by

627
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:59,125
Speaker 4:  the one of the richest people in the world. Larry Ellison, who is a very

628
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:01,645
Speaker 4:  long standing friend of Donald Trump.

629
00:42:03,155 --> 00:42:06,805
Speaker 4:  There's also Andreesen Horowitz, which is run by people like

630
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:11,125
Speaker 4:  Mark Andreesen who have been very loud supporters of Donald Trump, silver

631
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,165
Speaker 4:  Lake, like lots of these organizations that are very Trump friendly.

632
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:19,495
Speaker 4:  This all just feels like it is, it is just

633
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:23,375
Speaker 4:  Donald Trump giving TikTok to his friends. And I don't, I

634
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,095
Speaker 4:  don't know how else to put it other than that, but I, I just like, how are

635
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:28,735
Speaker 4:  you looking at the sort of power dynamics at play here?

636
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:33,595
Speaker 11:  Welcome to the gangster tech era, baby. Like that's what we're looking at,

637
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:37,715
Speaker 11:  right? We've talked about this a little bit. All of these tech mos

638
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:41,075
Speaker 11:  who have been cosing up to Donald Trump, because he's been very clear that

639
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:43,675
Speaker 11:  if you're his friend, he'll do stuff for you, but if you're not his friend,

640
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,955
Speaker 11:  he will hurt you. And so we've watched

641
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:49,675
Speaker 11:  Jeff Bezos basically got the Washington Post.

642
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,195
Speaker 11:  We've seen Elon Musk donate an insane amount of money to his

643
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:58,315
Speaker 11:  campaign and then like literally go into the White House and work from

644
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:01,235
Speaker 11:  there for a while. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg

645
00:43:02,615 --> 00:43:06,555
Speaker 11:  do some of the most humiliating like dances I

646
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:10,275
Speaker 11:  think I've ever seen to convince Donald Trump. He's really maga

647
00:43:10,785 --> 00:43:14,635
Speaker 11:  he's really serious about manhood, guys. And so, you know, this

648
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:17,635
Speaker 11:  is, this is, we're watching these guys jockey and like they were all at

649
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:20,675
Speaker 11:  the inauguration. And one of the things that I think is really interesting

650
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:24,675
Speaker 11:  is that they all have different needs and different things they want from

651
00:43:24,675 --> 00:43:27,555
Speaker 11:  the administration. Those needs conflict. And so

652
00:43:28,495 --> 00:43:31,715
Speaker 11:  one of the things that I'm kind of keeping an eye on with the Ellison

653
00:43:32,265 --> 00:43:35,635
Speaker 11:  sale is his relationship

654
00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:39,835
Speaker 11:  with Facebook because the biggest competitor for

655
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,875
Speaker 11:  Facebook, I guess Mark's calling it meta now, I'm sorry,

656
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:44,715
Speaker 11:  I should say meta

657
00:43:45,385 --> 00:43:45,675
Speaker 4:  Sure

658
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:48,635
Speaker 11:  Is TikTok, like TikTok is

659
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:53,355
Speaker 11:  meta's entire argument that they are not engaging in a

660
00:43:53,555 --> 00:43:57,315
Speaker 11:  monopoly and they shouldn't be broken up. And so there's,

661
00:43:57,315 --> 00:44:00,475
Speaker 11:  there's something interesting happening there that I think we're gonna continue

662
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:03,915
Speaker 11:  to see as, as, as this deal goes forward.

663
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:07,755
Speaker 11:  Obviously Andreessen Horowitz has positions with both

664
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,815
Speaker 11:  meta and its should this deal go through its major

665
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,735
Speaker 11:  competitor TikTok? That's fascinating.

666
00:44:15,995 --> 00:44:18,695
Speaker 11:  But beyond that, I mean, it is a really clear signal that if you're friends

667
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:22,615
Speaker 11:  with Donald Trump, you get stuff. And I expect that

668
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:26,335
Speaker 11:  there's going to be sort of some more jockeying to like have private dinners

669
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:29,775
Speaker 11:  with Donald Trump to get more things, especially as we're watching, you

670
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:33,765
Speaker 11:  know, the Google antitrust trial part, whatever taking place

671
00:44:33,765 --> 00:44:37,685
Speaker 11:  where we're trying to determine like whether, you know, it's

672
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:40,845
Speaker 11:  even feasible to break Google up, like what the remedies are, those things.

673
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:45,525
Speaker 11:  IIII think it's a pretty strong signal that we're gonna see

674
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:48,125
Speaker 11:  some court intrigue. Yeah.

675
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:51,525
Speaker 5:  There's also this very perverse thing happening with the ownership where

676
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:55,085
Speaker 5:  we're going from TikTok, which is a, you know,

677
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:58,965
Speaker 5:  ostensibly standalone company that is owned by another Chinese company,

678
00:44:58,965 --> 00:45:02,845
Speaker 5:  which therefore has, you know, pressures on it from the Chinese government

679
00:45:02,945 --> 00:45:06,565
Speaker 5:  to TikTok, which is ostensibly a standalone company owned by a bunch

680
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:10,685
Speaker 5:  of conservative pals of Donald Trump, which

681
00:45:10,685 --> 00:45:14,645
Speaker 5:  was only allowed because the conservative US government

682
00:45:15,235 --> 00:45:19,125
Speaker 5:  made it happen. And so, listen, I'm not trying

683
00:45:19,145 --> 00:45:22,965
Speaker 5:  to draw a line between China and the US being the same

684
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:26,445
Speaker 5:  in those respects, but we do still end up with a version of

685
00:45:26,545 --> 00:45:30,125
Speaker 5:  TikTok that is going to be heavily influenced by its backers

686
00:45:30,765 --> 00:45:34,165
Speaker 5:  and its backers have a very specific point of view in this case.

687
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:38,085
Speaker 11:  You know, it's funny that you mentioned that Jake, because Rupert

688
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:42,165
Speaker 11:  Murdoch's involvement reminds me of a previous Republican administration

689
00:45:43,455 --> 00:45:47,285
Speaker 11:  where Rupert Murdoch got a fast tracked citizenship in order

690
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:51,005
Speaker 11:  to buy more US TV stations.

691
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:56,125
Speaker 11:  I think that was Reagan. So this is not the first time that we've

692
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:59,685
Speaker 11:  seen a Republican administration favoring a media

693
00:45:59,685 --> 00:46:03,205
Speaker 11:  environment that is potentially very friendly to them. And I think given

694
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:07,045
Speaker 11:  what we've seen with Elon Musk's ownership of what the company

695
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:09,405
Speaker 11:  that used to be Twitter now

696
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:13,575
Speaker 11:  XI think there's a, a a, a good reason

697
00:46:13,635 --> 00:46:17,375
Speaker 11:  to be sort of skeptical about what these investors are going to do to

698
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,095
Speaker 11:  TikTok. Well,

699
00:46:18,095 --> 00:46:21,855
Speaker 4:  And I think this is where the Ellison become, I think the, the sort of

700
00:46:21,935 --> 00:46:25,535
Speaker 4:  central figures in this story, right? Because you it at the same time this

701
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,495
Speaker 4:  is happening, you have

702
00:46:29,225 --> 00:46:33,135
Speaker 4:  David Ellison, Larry's son by all accounts with

703
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:36,255
Speaker 4:  this essentially the oversight and financial backing of his father

704
00:46:37,435 --> 00:46:41,295
Speaker 4:  buying Paramount, getting control of CBS

705
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:45,135
Speaker 4:  news rapidly overhauling all of

706
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,095
Speaker 4:  the ways that they think about everything apparently in process to

707
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:53,295
Speaker 4:  acquire Barry Weiss and the free press and put Barry Weiss in some

708
00:46:53,295 --> 00:46:56,335
Speaker 4:  meaningful charge of CBS news, which will change the ideological bent of

709
00:46:56,335 --> 00:47:00,055
Speaker 4:  CBS news in a pretty immediate and huge way. Also

710
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,775
Speaker 4:  bidding for Warner Brothers discovery, which would put them in charge of

711
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:07,855
Speaker 4:  CNN. So you have the same company which rolls up

712
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:10,615
Speaker 4:  to the same person in charge of TikTok,

713
00:47:11,215 --> 00:47:14,815
Speaker 4:  C-B-S-H-B-O-C-N-N, and then

714
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:18,895
Speaker 4:  doing all of these giant deals with AI companies. It's, so you, you, we've

715
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:22,055
Speaker 4:  essentially put one person who is a

716
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:26,295
Speaker 4:  long-term friend and supporter of Donald Trump in charge of the media,

717
00:47:26,365 --> 00:47:30,285
Speaker 4:  like in a, in a real and straightforward way, in a way that never

718
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:33,045
Speaker 4:  would've been possible until right now with this president.

719
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:37,085
Speaker 11:  There's also one more Ellison that I, I think the

720
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:40,925
Speaker 11:  media has forgotten about, and it's Megan Ellison who owns Anna

721
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:44,485
Speaker 11:  Perna pictures, right? So that's one more arm of the sort of

722
00:47:45,455 --> 00:47:49,445
Speaker 11:  media octopus we're talking about. Look, this

723
00:47:49,445 --> 00:47:53,325
Speaker 11:  is the sort of thing that William Randolph Hurst would've like

724
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:55,605
Speaker 11:  loved. Like, this is, this is,

725
00:47:57,185 --> 00:48:00,965
Speaker 11:  you know, yes. Really remarkable stuff. And

726
00:48:00,985 --> 00:48:04,205
Speaker 11:  in a different era we might be talking about antitrust, but obviously that's

727
00:48:04,205 --> 00:48:07,205
Speaker 11:  not going to move forward under Donald Trump. It's one of the reasons the

728
00:48:07,205 --> 00:48:11,085
Speaker 11:  tech moguls preferred him. So I do think that that is a really

729
00:48:11,485 --> 00:48:15,165
Speaker 11:  fascinating thing that Larry Ellison in his old age has

730
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:18,485
Speaker 11:  decided to be William Randolph Hearst. I don't know where that goes.

731
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:20,725
Speaker 11:  And

732
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:25,995
Speaker 11:  I do think it's also interesting because one of the ongoing

733
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:29,675
Speaker 11:  complaints that the tech industry has had about media

734
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:34,715
Speaker 11:  is that the media is too hard on tech. There's too

735
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:38,675
Speaker 11:  much negative reporting, there's too much investigative

736
00:48:38,675 --> 00:48:42,475
Speaker 11:  journalism. We're constantly badmouthing 'em. We're not their

737
00:48:42,475 --> 00:48:42,915
Speaker 11:  friends.

738
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,835
Speaker 11:  And to be real, you know, I don't know that

739
00:48:48,975 --> 00:48:52,675
Speaker 11:  the media should be anybody's friends, but especially friends of the powerful,

740
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:56,675
Speaker 11:  I firmly believe that part of the job is

741
00:48:57,775 --> 00:49:00,045
Speaker 11:  comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable.

742
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:05,885
Speaker 11:  But that is, that has been the ongoing complaint since, I

743
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:07,325
Speaker 11:  don't know, since Theranos, I think

744
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:10,365
Speaker 4:  Was, was the media wrong about Theranos?

745
00:49:11,745 --> 00:49:15,485
Speaker 11:  No. Yeah, that's, that's the problem. Like, as we're

746
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:19,645
Speaker 11:  watching this media environment change and be owned by a tech mogul

747
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:23,885
Speaker 11:  and a group of people who've been very vocal about how they

748
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:27,845
Speaker 11:  don't like the way that reporting on their investments is tanking their

749
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:31,725
Speaker 11:  investments, I begin to wonder separately

750
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:35,565
Speaker 11:  from the political implications about the defanging

751
00:49:36,225 --> 00:49:40,045
Speaker 11:  of the American news media when it comes to doing critical

752
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:42,885
Speaker 11:  reporting on one of the most important industries in our country.

753
00:49:43,425 --> 00:49:46,925
Speaker 4:  All of this stuff is just happening so simultaneously that it's almost bizarre.

754
00:49:46,925 --> 00:49:50,765
Speaker 4:  Like, you, you can't really look at this stuff and not also think about what's

755
00:49:50,765 --> 00:49:54,445
Speaker 4:  going on with Jimmy Kimmel and, and Disney. And there's just this

756
00:49:55,715 --> 00:49:59,645
Speaker 4:  like, it's, it's not even quiet shift. It is, it

757
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:02,965
Speaker 4:  is a naked loud shift in how the government has decided

758
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:07,325
Speaker 4:  to treat the media and to bend it to its own particular

759
00:50:07,325 --> 00:50:08,205
Speaker 4:  will. And

760
00:50:09,825 --> 00:50:13,245
Speaker 4:  the Kimmel thing is like, is and isn't working for the government. I would

761
00:50:13,245 --> 00:50:17,205
Speaker 4:  say Jimmy Kimmel came back to huge ratings, like

762
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:21,645
Speaker 4:  spent a lot of time talking about free speech, but then like a lot

763
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:24,685
Speaker 4:  of people in America didn't see that because companies like Sinclair and

764
00:50:24,685 --> 00:50:27,845
Speaker 4:  Nexstar who either have business dealings or political alignment with the

765
00:50:27,845 --> 00:50:31,285
Speaker 4:  Trump administration continue to not air it. And so we're, we're just in

766
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:35,045
Speaker 4:  this place of like, all of this stuff has moved so

767
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:38,965
Speaker 4:  quickly and so aggressively that I feel like we're, I I'm

768
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:42,765
Speaker 4:  still trying to wrap my head around how gigantic that particular

769
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:45,965
Speaker 4:  shift has been. And, and this is the reason I keep bringing this up in the,

770
00:50:46,065 --> 00:50:49,925
Speaker 4:  in the course of TikTok is like, we spent five years being like, TikTok

771
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:52,325
Speaker 4:  is the future of the media, right? This is how young people get information.

772
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:55,685
Speaker 4:  This is how young people get news. This was the thing that everybody was

773
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:59,525
Speaker 4:  so worried about in the first place all the way back in 2020. The

774
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:03,485
Speaker 4:  idea that this is a crucial information source for young people.

775
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:08,005
Speaker 4:  And one of the big inciting events was, was October 7th. And this question

776
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:11,725
Speaker 4:  of what information are people getting about what's happening in Gaza

777
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,725
Speaker 4:  with Israel and Palestine? What, what are they understanding about

778
00:51:16,315 --> 00:51:20,285
Speaker 4:  this situation and how are they responding? And the, the question of like,

779
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:24,125
Speaker 4:  are people seeing pro-Palestine stuff or pro-Israel stuff

780
00:51:24,505 --> 00:51:27,965
Speaker 4:  on TikTok was like a big part of what people were debating about

781
00:51:28,345 --> 00:51:32,085
Speaker 4:  how quote unquote, China is controlling the

782
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:35,245
Speaker 4:  information flow to people in the United States. That became this whole big

783
00:51:35,245 --> 00:51:38,125
Speaker 4:  thing. And what is actually happening is that has spiraled out into the rest

784
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:42,085
Speaker 4:  of the media and is now coming crashing back to TikTok five years

785
00:51:42,085 --> 00:51:45,785
Speaker 4:  later. And it's just, it, it is

786
00:51:45,975 --> 00:51:49,505
Speaker 4:  like, maybe to some extent this is like the crowning of TikTok is like, yep,

787
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:52,705
Speaker 4:  TikTok is the media now, so we're also gonna give it to Larry Ellison.

788
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,945
Speaker 11:  You know, it's interesting to me

789
00:51:57,035 --> 00:52:00,655
Speaker 11:  how every Republican accusation turns into a confession

790
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:05,095
Speaker 11:  because for years now they've been complaining about PBS

791
00:52:06,975 --> 00:52:09,815
Speaker 11:  and, and, and NPR as state media

792
00:52:11,155 --> 00:52:14,975
Speaker 11:  and you know, those are partially federally funded. So much

793
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,895
Speaker 11:  so that like there we're now seeing public radio stations shutting

794
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:22,815
Speaker 11:  down because their funding has been cut by the federal

795
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:23,815
Speaker 11:  government. But

796
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:29,085
Speaker 11:  you know, those were operations that I think were operating as in good faith

797
00:52:29,225 --> 00:52:32,605
Speaker 11:  as best they could, and they were decentralized and local and

798
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:35,965
Speaker 11:  usually produced for a local community's needs.

799
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:40,765
Speaker 11:  And what we're getting instead is a massive

800
00:52:41,485 --> 00:52:45,325
Speaker 11:  sprawling super corporation owned by Larry Allison who is one of

801
00:52:45,325 --> 00:52:48,885
Speaker 11:  the president's biggest supporters, so it's privatized

802
00:52:48,975 --> 00:52:52,965
Speaker 11:  state media, which, you know, that's not really new.

803
00:52:53,205 --> 00:52:56,845
Speaker 11:  I mean, that's a big part of how Sylvia Berlusconi kept control of

804
00:52:56,855 --> 00:52:59,685
Speaker 11:  Italy for so long was that he was a media mogul.

805
00:53:01,465 --> 00:53:04,685
Speaker 11:  So maybe we we're, we're in our burse era. I don't know.

806
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,805
Speaker 11:  But yeah, I definitely think this is partially the crowning of TikTok. And

807
00:53:08,805 --> 00:53:12,485
Speaker 11:  I also think it may be the end of TikTok because as,

808
00:53:12,785 --> 00:53:16,775
Speaker 11:  as, as I understand it, there is a possibility

809
00:53:16,805 --> 00:53:19,815
Speaker 11:  that people will have to switch to a new app. And

810
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:24,055
Speaker 11:  we all know that like as soon as you introduce that kind of friction,

811
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:28,245
Speaker 11:  people then make a decision and they may not download it.

812
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:32,365
Speaker 4:  Okay. I'm so glad you brought this up because I think, Jake, I think

813
00:53:32,385 --> 00:53:35,485
Speaker 4:  you mentioned this the last time we were talking about those sort of, will

814
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:38,965
Speaker 4:  they, won't they of TikTok and, and you made a ship of thesis

815
00:53:39,685 --> 00:53:43,605
Speaker 4:  reference, which is basically like, if, if you take every part of TikTok

816
00:53:43,665 --> 00:53:47,605
Speaker 4:  and change it, but you still call it TikTok. Is it still TikTok? And this

817
00:53:47,605 --> 00:53:50,805
Speaker 4:  is where I think also the question of what happens to the algorithm becomes

818
00:53:50,805 --> 00:53:54,565
Speaker 4:  really important, right? Because the algorithm at the center of TikTok has

819
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:57,525
Speaker 4:  been one of, if not the biggest

820
00:53:58,525 --> 00:54:00,885
Speaker 4:  question, it was a big part of the reason it got banned, right? The, the

821
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:04,845
Speaker 4:  sort of two arguments against TikTok are, it is an app collecting a lot

822
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:07,845
Speaker 4:  of data on US users, which I find completely

823
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:12,405
Speaker 4:  non-credible because like if you, if you wanna collect a lot of data on US

824
00:54:12,645 --> 00:54:15,445
Speaker 4:  internet users, there are actually infinite ways to do it that are easier

825
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:19,125
Speaker 4:  than creating a really successful social media platform. I don't like, I

826
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:22,765
Speaker 4:  don't buy that at all. The idea of TikTok as

827
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:27,085
Speaker 4:  really important, really powerful disseminator of information with a

828
00:54:27,085 --> 00:54:31,005
Speaker 4:  really, really well tuned and magical feeling algorithm that

829
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:34,445
Speaker 4:  a lot of people have responded to super real and has also become

830
00:54:34,965 --> 00:54:38,765
Speaker 4:  a big part of the underlying debate about what's gonna happen here. So

831
00:54:38,995 --> 00:54:42,965
Speaker 4:  this, I would say at this point, 11:21 AM on Thursday morning,

832
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:47,005
Speaker 4:  the thing we don't know is the fate of the algorithm. And there's been a

833
00:54:47,005 --> 00:54:50,965
Speaker 4:  bunch of reporting kind of on both sides. One says the,

834
00:54:51,105 --> 00:54:54,565
Speaker 4:  the TikTok us, whatever this new thing will be called, will

835
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:58,485
Speaker 4:  license the algorithm from by dance and from

836
00:54:58,485 --> 00:55:02,285
Speaker 4:  China. What that means, who knows, there's also a world in which

837
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:06,925
Speaker 4:  they basically get a copy of the algorithm as it currently exists and then

838
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:10,885
Speaker 4:  sort of fork it and go from there. And then there's a version of it that

839
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:13,205
Speaker 4:  is essentially like they have to rebuild this whole thing from scratch. It

840
00:55:13,205 --> 00:55:16,965
Speaker 4:  just gets to be called TikTok and they get to keep the 170 million United States

841
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:20,725
Speaker 4:  users in any of those cases. It seems very clear to me that the

842
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:24,725
Speaker 4:  TikTok people in the United States experience will be

843
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:28,645
Speaker 4:  completely meaningfully different from day one than

844
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:32,445
Speaker 4:  the TikTok they have been experiencing so far. Jake, am I, am I like

845
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:35,565
Speaker 4:  overstating this? Whether it's, it might be a new app, which I think would

846
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,485
Speaker 4:  be a, a huge gating factor for a lot of people, but like

847
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:43,525
Speaker 4:  TikTok controlled by Oracle is inevitably

848
00:55:43,575 --> 00:55:47,285
Speaker 4:  going to be different than TikTok controlled by, by dance. And the, the extent

849
00:55:47,285 --> 00:55:50,365
Speaker 4:  to which it'll be different, I think remains to be somewhat seen depending

850
00:55:50,365 --> 00:55:53,765
Speaker 4:  on what the algorithmic control actually looks like. But

851
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:57,685
Speaker 4:  it is going to change in a big way immediately.

852
00:55:57,985 --> 00:56:01,565
Speaker 5:  Yes. Well, I think it is number one, optimistic to assume that a Trump press

853
00:56:01,565 --> 00:56:04,485
Speaker 5:  conference is going to be clarifying on this fair.

854
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:09,085
Speaker 5:  However, like a hundred percent right? This is going to

855
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:13,285
Speaker 5:  meaningfully change TikTok, TikTok is not going to be the same, and

856
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:18,005
Speaker 5:  any one of these changes would be a big deal. Will the US users have access

857
00:56:18,065 --> 00:56:21,925
Speaker 5:  to tiktoks from foreign users at all that 'cause that's a huge

858
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:25,765
Speaker 5:  chunk of content and a huge chunk of variety that you won't gain access to.

859
00:56:26,285 --> 00:56:29,725
Speaker 5:  I don't know, maybe it's just some dudes over in Turkey who are

860
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:33,245
Speaker 5:  splicing clips of like the equalizer together,

861
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,925
Speaker 5:  right? Like I don't, I don't know that,

862
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:37,405
Speaker 4:  Is that what you watch on TikTok? Jake? Be honest.

863
00:56:37,805 --> 00:56:41,685
Speaker 5:  I mean, I'm not finished yet, but Right. But it'll

864
00:56:41,805 --> 00:56:45,605
Speaker 5:  find me in the algorithm, right? But like the TikTok algorithm is

865
00:56:45,815 --> 00:56:49,645
Speaker 5:  everything and if it's gonna have less content and their

866
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:53,605
Speaker 5:  algorithm is gonna be changing and like, not for nothing, if the algorithm

867
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:57,485
Speaker 5:  is, I don't know, like getting some, getting some nudges from these new investors,

868
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:02,885
Speaker 5:  things might be changing, right? And there are a million

869
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:05,325
Speaker 5:  alternatives to TikTok at this point. Yeah,

870
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:09,165
Speaker 4:  I I go back and forth on this and I think on the one hand,

871
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:13,825
Speaker 4:  a thing that is different now than it was five years ago is that TikTok is

872
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:17,625
Speaker 4:  not the only kind of game in town on this front. Like to some extent

873
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:22,585
Speaker 4:  reels has done a very good job of just ripping off TikTok

874
00:57:22,595 --> 00:57:26,505
Speaker 4:  Pixel by pixel. YouTube is attempting to do the same thing

875
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:30,065
Speaker 4:  to, I would say varying levels of success. But the idea

876
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:33,785
Speaker 4:  of TikTok, I think is less sort of uniquely

877
00:57:35,425 --> 00:57:39,345
Speaker 4:  Powerful as it once was. At the same time, these other companies

878
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:42,825
Speaker 4:  have had five years now to build a thing that is

879
00:57:42,825 --> 00:57:46,745
Speaker 4:  compelling to people as TikTok. And they have just utterly failed to

880
00:57:46,745 --> 00:57:49,985
Speaker 4:  do it like it is TikTok is, if anything, more

881
00:57:50,585 --> 00:57:54,145
Speaker 4:  culturally central than it has ever been. And so I think I

882
00:57:54,235 --> 00:57:57,265
Speaker 4:  spent time a couple of years ago being like, okay, well, like

883
00:57:57,965 --> 00:58:01,345
Speaker 4:  TikTok hasn't as a lead in building a really great, really compelling algorithm,

884
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:05,265
Speaker 4:  but a it's publishing a lot of information about how it works in order to

885
00:58:05,335 --> 00:58:09,185
Speaker 4:  satisfy US regulators, but it's also

886
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,665
Speaker 4:  just like these leads don't last forever. Other companies catch up, things

887
00:58:11,665 --> 00:58:15,545
Speaker 4:  are gonna change. No one has caught up. TikTok is still winning in a, in

888
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,905
Speaker 4:  a big, huge important way despite all of this chaos. And so

889
00:58:19,505 --> 00:58:23,345
Speaker 4:  I, I think in some ways it is more high

890
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:27,225
Speaker 4:  stakes than ever and it's more unbelievable than

891
00:58:27,225 --> 00:58:30,625
Speaker 4:  ever that Oracle will just show up and keep doing as good a job. I just like,

892
00:58:30,845 --> 00:58:32,665
Speaker 4:  it just seems impossible to imagine to me.

893
00:58:32,665 --> 00:58:35,625
Speaker 5:  Well, I, I, I mean, and that is the question, right? If, if it is an app

894
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:39,505
Speaker 5:  that is merely named TikTok, but it has less content than TikTok and a

895
00:58:39,505 --> 00:58:42,985
Speaker 5:  worse algorithm than TikTok, what you're just describing is Instagram reels.

896
00:58:43,175 --> 00:58:46,745
Speaker 5:  Like, yeah, okay. Like, will will people continue to use that? Like

897
00:58:47,465 --> 00:58:51,345
Speaker 5:  probably will it grow in the same way? Will it be as culturally important

898
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:55,185
Speaker 5:  in the same way? I'm not sure. And And I I the fact that

899
00:58:56,205 --> 00:58:59,185
Speaker 5:  Oracle and Larry Ellison and all these folks are, are going to have like

900
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:03,185
Speaker 5:  a lot of say in it and they a lot of cash to make back from it, like

901
00:59:03,185 --> 00:59:04,225
Speaker 5:  things are going to change.

902
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:06,625
Speaker 11:  I also wanna add, you know,

903
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:11,945
Speaker 11:  there are a bunch of people who have businesses

904
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,545
Speaker 11:  that are based largely on TikTok content, right?

905
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:20,545
Speaker 11:  So you change the algorithms so that like,

906
00:59:20,845 --> 00:59:24,285
Speaker 11:  in any way, you alter this in any way, so that TikTok is less

907
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:28,245
Speaker 11:  compelling. All of those content creators go someplace else because

908
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:31,805
Speaker 11:  they still need to make money. Like there is this real

909
00:59:33,635 --> 00:59:37,445
Speaker 11:  important constituency of people because most people don't

910
00:59:37,795 --> 00:59:41,685
Speaker 11:  post, you know, we're freaks like people who

911
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:44,685
Speaker 11:  post are freaks. Like we're, that's not most of the internet.

912
00:59:46,025 --> 00:59:49,885
Speaker 11:  And so these people who are essentially like the TV channels of

913
00:59:50,105 --> 00:59:51,325
Speaker 11:  TikTok, the professionals,

914
00:59:53,935 --> 00:59:57,745
Speaker 11:  what happens if it's not as compelling to them because that is

915
00:59:57,755 --> 01:00:01,665
Speaker 11:  again, more lost content. And you know, they do have options,

916
01:00:01,955 --> 01:00:05,825
Speaker 11:  right? Like they, there is YouTube shorts, which I'm sure like

917
01:00:05,825 --> 01:00:09,105
Speaker 11:  Google can figure out how to make that more compelling if they think about

918
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,225
Speaker 11:  it for a minute and can actually make a decision through all the layers

919
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:16,145
Speaker 11:  of the bureaucracy there. You know, there's Instagram

920
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:19,505
Speaker 11:  reels. If you think that Mark Zuckerberg isn't going to take advantage of

921
01:00:19,505 --> 01:00:22,945
Speaker 11:  this confusion, you haven't like paid any attention to Meta ever.

922
01:00:24,205 --> 01:00:28,025
Speaker 11:  And then there's also of course the possibility that, you know, something

923
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:31,905
Speaker 11:  else springs up. So, you know, there is also like the potential

924
01:00:31,905 --> 01:00:35,665
Speaker 11:  for throwing the door open to some competitor we haven't imagined

925
01:00:35,805 --> 01:00:36,025
Speaker 11:  yet.

926
01:00:36,295 --> 01:00:40,225
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it seems, I think I it to the extent that this is like a,

927
01:00:40,305 --> 01:00:44,185
Speaker 4:  a super shortsighted strategy on, on

928
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:47,625
Speaker 4:  all sides here, I think it is useful to point out that both

929
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:51,145
Speaker 4:  Donald Trump and Larry Ellison are in their eighties and are, are probably

930
01:00:51,145 --> 01:00:54,465
Speaker 4:  not spending a ton of time worrying about the long-term future of TikTok,

931
01:00:56,085 --> 01:01:00,025
Speaker 4:  but I, yeah, I think we're, we're in this phase where it, it just seems

932
01:01:00,055 --> 01:01:03,905
Speaker 4:  very hard to me to imagine that TikTok just keeps

933
01:01:03,905 --> 01:01:07,625
Speaker 4:  being TikTok at the end of this. And it is like there,

934
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:11,425
Speaker 4:  I I can't figure out what it is. And I think part of what will be so interesting

935
01:01:11,425 --> 01:01:15,345
Speaker 4:  about this transition is figuring out what it was that Bite dance was

936
01:01:15,345 --> 01:01:18,585
Speaker 4:  doing that is so hard to replace because everybody else has been trying to

937
01:01:18,585 --> 01:01:22,505
Speaker 4:  reverse engineer this for five years and no one has done it. And I think,

938
01:01:22,885 --> 01:01:26,865
Speaker 4:  Liz, you're right that Mark Zuckerberg and Co are

939
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:30,545
Speaker 4:  pouring probably more energy into it with more success. Like reels is working

940
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:34,705
Speaker 4:  to the point that like, it's pretty clear that reels is the future of meta

941
01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:38,705
Speaker 4:  in a really important way. That company is all in on reels as a thing.

942
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:42,745
Speaker 4:  Reels is not as good as TikTok. It's just not, And I could not sit

943
01:01:42,745 --> 01:01:46,385
Speaker 4:  here and explain to you why. And I think it's gonna be really interesting

944
01:01:46,385 --> 01:01:50,345
Speaker 4:  to see these very powerful, very rich people try to figure

945
01:01:50,585 --> 01:01:53,825
Speaker 4:  that out in real time before everybody gets bored and goes somewhere else.

946
01:01:53,895 --> 01:01:57,225
Speaker 4:  Because I think the, the timeline to pull that off is short

947
01:01:57,725 --> 01:01:58,825
Speaker 4:  and high risk.

948
01:01:59,385 --> 01:02:03,345
Speaker 11:  I have one other thought here, which is, again, related to Rupert

949
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:06,905
Speaker 11:  Murdoch. I know this is shocking for you guys that I have Murdoch thoughts,

950
01:02:08,845 --> 01:02:12,105
Speaker 11:  but you may remember we're old enough to remember

951
01:02:12,455 --> 01:02:15,985
Speaker 11:  MySpace, which was for a time a really promising

952
01:02:16,825 --> 01:02:19,525
Speaker 11:  social media platform. It was a place where people were, were especially

953
01:02:19,725 --> 01:02:23,565
Speaker 11:  discovering music, right? Like much like TikTok and then

954
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:28,545
Speaker 11:  Rupert Murdoch bought it and Facebook happened

955
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:30,745
Speaker 11:  and MySpace died.

956
01:02:33,405 --> 01:02:37,105
Speaker 11:  And there are any of a number of reasons why that could have

957
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:40,425
Speaker 11:  happened, right? One of them was maybe the way that Facebook got rolled

958
01:02:40,445 --> 01:02:43,785
Speaker 11:  out, one of them was that Facebook was easier for people to interact with

959
01:02:44,335 --> 01:02:48,265
Speaker 11:  because you didn't have to have any skills to like enter your, you

960
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,145
Speaker 11:  know, details into what was essentially like a skinned spreadsheet

961
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:57,155
Speaker 11:  just being real. Yeah. But you know, like there was this sort of market

962
01:02:57,295 --> 01:03:00,195
Speaker 11:  for people to be able to make their own website without having to like learn

963
01:03:00,255 --> 01:03:03,875
Speaker 11:  any kind of HTML or any other sort of coding skills. And that was like the

964
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:04,915
Speaker 11:  market that Facebook won.

965
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:10,345
Speaker 11:  And so I am not saying that Rupert Murdoch's

966
01:03:10,345 --> 01:03:14,105
Speaker 11:  involvement in this deal is a bad oven because maybe it's not.

967
01:03:16,245 --> 01:03:19,585
Speaker 11:  But on the other hand, you know, the, the track record with

968
01:03:20,345 --> 01:03:23,625
Speaker 11:  social media companies for him is not great.

969
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:27,345
Speaker 4:  Do you guys ever follow MySpace Tom on Instagram? MySpace, Tom

970
01:03:27,725 --> 01:03:31,545
Speaker 4:  did life correctly, sold his company to

971
01:03:31,965 --> 01:03:35,385
Speaker 4:  Rupert Murdoch for a ton of money and is now just like a world

972
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:39,345
Speaker 4:  traveling photographer that nobody ever hears about. And it is like my guy

973
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:43,145
Speaker 4:  crushed it. He was everybody's best friend on MySpace and then just disappeared

974
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:46,505
Speaker 4:  off the face of the earth with all of his money. And I just wanna say congratulations

975
01:03:46,505 --> 01:03:50,425
Speaker 4:  to MySpace, Tom, for absolutely getting one over on Murdock. He

976
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:53,305
Speaker 4:  could have been sitting in front of Congress right now answering questions.

977
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:56,785
Speaker 4:  Seriously. This is, this is, yeah. Yeah. I would rather have, I would rather

978
01:03:56,785 --> 01:03:58,505
Speaker 4:  be an Instagram photographer, frankly.

979
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:02,705
Speaker 4:  All right. I think we, we should we, we can leave this alone, Liz, you're

980
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:06,185
Speaker 4:  gonna have to come back when we have more answers, which will be never

981
01:04:07,345 --> 01:04:10,265
Speaker 4:  actually Liz's. Just quickly do this before we, we take a break.

982
01:04:11,905 --> 01:04:15,705
Speaker 4:  I, if you just had to vote right now, real or not real, this is

983
01:04:15,705 --> 01:04:19,285
Speaker 4:  happening or this is not happening. Liz, is this happening or is this not

984
01:04:19,285 --> 01:04:21,325
Speaker 4:  happening? The TikTok deal once and for all.

985
01:04:21,865 --> 01:04:24,725
Speaker 11:  You know, I think this one might happen. I mean, maybe I'm making a fool

986
01:04:24,725 --> 01:04:27,445
Speaker 11:  of myself and somebody's listening to this like Friday on their laughing,

987
01:04:27,465 --> 01:04:30,685
Speaker 11:  but that's what I'm hoping for. I mean, that would be, that would be great.

988
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,725
Speaker 11:  It wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong. But the reason I

989
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:38,605
Speaker 11:  think this one is happening is because it is Donald Trump's

990
01:04:38,605 --> 01:04:42,285
Speaker 11:  cronies and we do see, you know, this pattern which expresses

991
01:04:42,305 --> 01:04:46,245
Speaker 11:  itself through like him pressuring people to, among other things,

992
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,205
Speaker 11:  bring charges against Jim Comey

993
01:04:49,865 --> 01:04:53,805
Speaker 11:  of, of basically, you know, the imperial presidency. And

994
01:04:54,705 --> 01:04:58,645
Speaker 11:  you know, this, this sort of mafioso idea that like if

995
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:02,085
Speaker 11:  you're with me enough, you get some of the spoils of

996
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:06,445
Speaker 11:  American Empire. So that to me suggests that this deal is real.

997
01:05:06,585 --> 01:05:10,525
Speaker 11:  If it weren't Larry Ellison, I'd be a little more skeptical, but

998
01:05:10,765 --> 01:05:14,485
Speaker 11:  I, I think that Donald Trump probably owes Larry Ellison pretty

999
01:05:14,545 --> 01:05:15,285
Speaker 11:  big at this point.

1000
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:17,205
Speaker 4:  Jake, what do you think? I think, think this

1001
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:21,085
Speaker 5:  Is real. My suspicion though is it's probably still gonna be several

1002
01:05:21,115 --> 01:05:25,085
Speaker 5:  more months before any of this actually happens. And my suspicion is

1003
01:05:25,085 --> 01:05:27,765
Speaker 5:  also that a bunch of things are going to change in that time.

1004
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:31,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think, I think I, I tend to agree, I think this is going to happen.

1005
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:36,725
Speaker 4:  I believe it was on September 16th that Trump delayed another 90 days,

1006
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:40,645
Speaker 4:  which I think is telling the, the ban that clearly is

1007
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,685
Speaker 4:  not a ban and was never a ban. And this is all transparently illegal and

1008
01:05:43,685 --> 01:05:46,925
Speaker 4:  ridiculous. I think a deal will get done.

1009
01:05:47,685 --> 01:05:51,085
Speaker 4:  I think it's important to say, I don't think it will solve anybody's actual

1010
01:05:51,165 --> 01:05:55,045
Speaker 4:  problems with TikTok. Like if you were a person who believes in the national

1011
01:05:55,245 --> 01:05:59,045
Speaker 4:  security risks of TikTok, there is nothing that we've learned so far that

1012
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:03,005
Speaker 4:  suggests to me that is going to get better. It might be a different group

1013
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:06,125
Speaker 4:  of people issuing propaganda at you. Hooray.

1014
01:06:06,885 --> 01:06:10,285
Speaker 4:  I don't know. This is, this is just what we're doing now. But anyway, this

1015
01:06:10,285 --> 01:06:13,165
Speaker 4:  is, I think, I think you're both right, that we are certainly not done talking

1016
01:06:13,165 --> 01:06:17,085
Speaker 4:  about whatever the machinations of this deal are going to be. And Liz, I

1017
01:06:17,085 --> 01:06:19,805
Speaker 4:  also, I'm gonna need you to work on a Larry Ellison impression that I would

1018
01:06:19,805 --> 01:06:22,245
Speaker 4:  like you to debut on The Vergecast at some point in the near future.

1019
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:26,205
Speaker 11:  So you feel that, okay, but I'm gonna need a yacht. So

1020
01:06:26,345 --> 01:06:28,845
Speaker 11:  if I can just expense a yacht, that would be great.

1021
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,845
Speaker 4:  That's true. It does it, it will feel disingenuous if you're not doing it

1022
01:06:32,845 --> 01:06:33,565
Speaker 4:  from a yacht.

1023
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:37,525
Speaker 5:  Neli will approve that. We can't, we have to be

1024
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:38,205
Speaker 5:  responsible

1025
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,965
Speaker 4:  As Neli always says, we will compromise our journalistic integrity, but only

1026
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:47,725
Speaker 4:  for boat money. So if you want to give us boat money, get at us.

1027
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:51,165
Speaker 4:  Liz, we, you stick around and do some lightning round with us real fast before

1028
01:06:51,165 --> 01:06:51,325
Speaker 4:  we get

1029
01:06:51,325 --> 01:06:52,325
Speaker 11:  Out. Yeah, absolutely.

1030
01:06:52,835 --> 01:06:54,485
Speaker 4:  Good. All right, we're gonna take a break. We'll be right back.

1031
01:09:23,665 --> 01:09:27,505
Speaker 4:  speaker update. And it's a new party speaker from Anker, the company that

1032
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:30,705
Speaker 4:  you know of as the one who makes all the cool giant batteries that everybody

1033
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:34,665
Speaker 4:  carries around. Anker has made a series of projectors that

1034
01:09:34,665 --> 01:09:38,505
Speaker 4:  are very cool. This one is a projector inside of a

1035
01:09:38,505 --> 01:09:41,625
Speaker 4:  party speaker, and it is the greatest thing I've ever seen. I want you both

1036
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:45,345
Speaker 4:  to just imagine a rolly suitcase that you would roll through an airport.

1037
01:09:45,725 --> 01:09:49,225
Speaker 4:  And then I want you to put four detachable speakers

1038
01:09:49,325 --> 01:09:53,265
Speaker 4:  inside of it, each one looking like something that TSA would have

1039
01:09:53,265 --> 01:09:56,505
Speaker 4:  a lot of thoughts about if you were to roll this through the airport. And

1040
01:09:56,505 --> 01:09:59,385
Speaker 4:  then I want you to imagine right in the middle, a little, a little thing

1041
01:09:59,385 --> 01:10:03,265
Speaker 4:  that opens up to reveal a projector. It is, this is

1042
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:06,425
Speaker 4:  an all in one rolly party speaker

1043
01:10:07,265 --> 01:10:09,905
Speaker 4:  surround sound projector. And it is the greatest idea I've ever heard in

1044
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:13,505
Speaker 4:  my life. It's gonna cost $5,000. It's called the Sound Core

1045
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:17,425
Speaker 4:  Nebula X one Pro. You can get it on Kickstarter now for

1046
01:10:17,435 --> 01:10:21,185
Speaker 4:  $3,000, which is somewhat alarmingly an incredible

1047
01:10:21,185 --> 01:10:25,145
Speaker 4:  deal. But this is the single most ambitions and terrific party speaker

1048
01:10:25,425 --> 01:10:29,105
Speaker 4:  I think I've ever seen. And I will not be buying it, but I love to pieces

1049
01:10:29,415 --> 01:10:30,105
Speaker 4:  that it exists.

1050
01:10:30,985 --> 01:10:34,585
Speaker 5:  I I cannot get behind Eli's love of a, of a typical

1051
01:10:34,715 --> 01:10:38,665
Speaker 5:  party speaker. This thing on the other hand, fully into it, yes,

1052
01:10:38,805 --> 01:10:41,745
Speaker 5:  you listen five grant, you can't put a price on this kind of convenience.

1053
01:10:41,965 --> 01:10:42,185
Speaker 5:  You

1054
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:44,825
Speaker 4:  Can. It's 5,000 bucks. That's the beauty of it.

1055
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:49,145
Speaker 11:  So I I do have a question about the specs here. Okay,

1056
01:10:50,665 --> 01:10:51,765
Speaker 11:  is there a disco ball?

1057
01:10:53,725 --> 01:10:56,905
Speaker 4:  So, okay, I'm actually very glad you brought this up. I will see the one

1058
01:10:57,225 --> 01:11:00,025
Speaker 4:  distinct failing of this thing is there don't appear to be multicolored lights

1059
01:11:00,165 --> 01:11:03,345
Speaker 4:  anyway, which I think you could actually argue

1060
01:11:03,835 --> 01:11:07,705
Speaker 4:  makes it not a party speaker at all. It's just, it's potentially just a very

1061
01:11:07,715 --> 01:11:08,465
Speaker 4:  large speaker.

1062
01:11:10,205 --> 01:11:14,165
Speaker 4:  And that is, that's a real shame. Anker like attempted to make a thing that

1063
01:11:14,165 --> 01:11:18,125
Speaker 4:  is serious and that is a, a huge mistake. I don't believe it will do

1064
01:11:18,145 --> 01:11:21,885
Speaker 4:  any cool lights at you at all. And I find that incredibly upsetting.

1065
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:26,085
Speaker 4:  But you know, for $5,000, there's only so much you can get. My favorite thing

1066
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:29,565
Speaker 4:  about this is there's a graphic on their Kickstarter page that says, it shows

1067
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:33,165
Speaker 4:  the, the Nebula and like a 16.7

1068
01:11:33,435 --> 01:11:35,805
Speaker 4:  foot screen and it's like this is

1069
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:39,565
Speaker 4:  $3,698 versus the traditional cost

1070
01:11:39,785 --> 01:11:43,565
Speaker 4:  of a $4,000 projector, $200 wireless microphones, which

1071
01:11:43,705 --> 01:11:47,645
Speaker 4:  why $3,000 Dolby Atmos speakers, a hundred dollars projector

1072
01:11:47,645 --> 01:11:51,565
Speaker 4:  stand and a $2,000 inflatable screen, which is apparently the other

1073
01:11:51,565 --> 01:11:55,445
Speaker 4:  option for if you wanna like watch movies in your backyard. And that's

1074
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:58,885
Speaker 4:  $9,000. And this, I would say is Anker just really

1075
01:11:58,885 --> 01:12:02,365
Speaker 4:  understanding how real people live their real lives And I respect them for

1076
01:12:02,365 --> 01:12:04,805
Speaker 4:  that. Anyway, that is your party speaker update for the day.

1077
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:08,645
Speaker 4:  Liz, you're up next. What's your first lightning round?

1078
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:11,525
Speaker 11:  So, oh God, we're gonna talk about

1079
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:15,885
Speaker 11:  Brendan Carr. Gentlemen, I'm, I'm,

1080
01:12:16,585 --> 01:12:20,045
Speaker 11:  please, let's hear your thoughts on Brendan Carr. Just the name. 'cause

1081
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:20,805
Speaker 11:  I saw some faces.

1082
01:12:21,385 --> 01:12:24,925
Speaker 4:  Are we doing a neli free episode of America's number one podcast with own

1083
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:27,605
Speaker 4:  podcast? Brendan Carr is a dummy. Is this, is it time?

1084
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:33,485
Speaker 11:  Look, if anybody was gonna do it in the substitute for Neli on Brendan Carr

1085
01:12:33,485 --> 01:12:35,845
Speaker 11:  as a dummy, who, who else was it gonna be? We're

1086
01:12:35,925 --> 01:12:36,005
Speaker 4:  Thrilled

1087
01:12:36,005 --> 01:12:39,845
Speaker 11:  To have you. So, you know, he's got this ongoing war on the first amendment

1088
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:43,525
Speaker 11:  that he mostly seems to be winning. And the latest

1089
01:12:45,075 --> 01:12:47,485
Speaker 11:  iteration of this is

1090
01:12:49,045 --> 01:12:49,445
Speaker 11:  threatening

1091
01:12:51,145 --> 01:12:54,995
Speaker 11:  Disney because he doesn't like

1092
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:58,315
Speaker 11:  something that Jimmy Kimmel said. Disney yanking

1093
01:12:58,845 --> 01:12:59,675
Speaker 11:  Jimmy Kimmel.

1094
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:04,835
Speaker 11:  And then consumer outcry, Disney

1095
01:13:05,275 --> 01:13:09,075
Speaker 11:  reinstating Jimmy Kimmel, Brendan Carr being

1096
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:12,875
Speaker 11:  like, it wasn't a threat really. I

1097
01:13:13,175 --> 01:13:16,915
Speaker 11:  was just saying things on this conservative podcast who knew

1098
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:18,675
Speaker 11:  that anybody would take it seriously.

1099
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:23,635
Speaker 11:  Kimmel by the way, is still not being aired on a number of networks

1100
01:13:24,185 --> 01:13:28,115
Speaker 11:  because Sinclair and Nexstar, they have a blanket ban

1101
01:13:28,115 --> 01:13:31,795
Speaker 11:  on him. So good luck to Jimmy Kimmel out there.

1102
01:13:32,615 --> 01:13:36,235
Speaker 11:  One of the things that happened, of course is the Streisand effect. So Kimmel

1103
01:13:36,235 --> 01:13:39,755
Speaker 11:  came back to huge ratings and just spent the entire episode

1104
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:43,475
Speaker 11:  making fun of Donald Trump. And now the president is threatening him

1105
01:13:43,755 --> 01:13:47,515
Speaker 11:  directly. So that's cool. So that's, that's our, Brendan

1106
01:13:47,585 --> 01:13:51,235
Speaker 11:  Carr is a big dummy update is that he has just

1107
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:55,115
Speaker 11:  platformed Jimmy Kimmel in a huge way. Congratulations Brendan.

1108
01:13:55,535 --> 01:13:55,755
Speaker 11:  Can

1109
01:13:55,755 --> 01:13:59,155
Speaker 4:  I, can I just read you the thing that, that Donald Trump posted on truth

1110
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:02,675
Speaker 4:  social about this, which I think to me is like just a perfect

1111
01:14:03,515 --> 01:14:07,475
Speaker 4:  encapsulation of what the Trump administration is trying to

1112
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:11,365
Speaker 4:  do and why everyone who is giving into it is a doofus. Can I

1113
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:14,765
Speaker 4:  just read you this truth social post. A thing I truly hate doing on this

1114
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:17,885
Speaker 4:  podcast is reading truth social posts out loud. But can I just read this

1115
01:14:17,885 --> 01:14:18,325
Speaker 4:  one to you?

1116
01:14:19,265 --> 01:14:22,465
Speaker 11:  I not only do I want you to read it, I want you to read it in your best

1117
01:14:22,465 --> 01:14:23,625
Speaker 11:  Donald Trump impression

1118
01:14:25,095 --> 01:14:28,625
Speaker 4:  That I will, I will not be doing that. That will, that will, I will get fired

1119
01:14:28,645 --> 01:14:31,905
Speaker 4:  for different reasons if I'm doing that. But here, lemme just read this to

1120
01:14:31,905 --> 01:14:35,065
Speaker 4:  you. It says, I can't believe a b, c fake news gave Jimmy Kimmel his job

1121
01:14:35,065 --> 01:14:38,905
Speaker 4:  back. The White House was told by a BC that his show was canceled. Something

1122
01:14:39,145 --> 01:14:41,745
Speaker 4:  happened between then and now because his audience is gone and his talent

1123
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:45,025
Speaker 4:  was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's

1124
01:14:45,025 --> 01:14:48,945
Speaker 4:  not funny and who puts the network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat

1125
01:14:48,945 --> 01:14:52,225
Speaker 4:  garbage? He has yet another arm of the DNC and to the best of my knowledge,

1126
01:14:52,225 --> 01:14:55,985
Speaker 4:  that would be a major illegal campaign contribution. So just quick pause

1127
01:14:56,045 --> 01:14:59,865
Speaker 4:  for David commentary. All of that is bananas

1128
01:15:00,225 --> 01:15:03,385
Speaker 4:  nonsense craziness. But is like normal bananas, nonsense craziness coming

1129
01:15:03,385 --> 01:15:07,305
Speaker 4:  from President Trump. Like the White House is told by a BC that his

1130
01:15:07,305 --> 01:15:10,345
Speaker 4:  show was canceled, I'm sure is not a real thing.

1131
01:15:11,725 --> 01:15:14,545
Speaker 4:  The his audience is gone, his talent was never there. Very funny in context

1132
01:15:14,605 --> 01:15:17,145
Speaker 4:  of what you just said, Liz, which is that actually what President Trump did

1133
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:21,065
Speaker 4:  was give Jimmy Kimmel the biggest audience maybe he's ever had. All

1134
01:15:21,065 --> 01:15:24,815
Speaker 4:  of this is very funny. So then what he says is, I'm, I'm back to

1135
01:15:24,815 --> 01:15:27,655
Speaker 4:  quoting the President of the United States, which just feels like a relevant

1136
01:15:27,655 --> 01:15:30,415
Speaker 4:  thing to say, I think we're gonna test a, b, c out on this. Let's see how

1137
01:15:30,415 --> 01:15:34,215
Speaker 4:  we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 million. This one

1138
01:15:34,215 --> 01:15:38,015
Speaker 4:  sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers let Jimmy Kimmel rot in

1139
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:41,415
Speaker 4:  his bad ratings. I just, anytime you are sitting in a conference room

1140
01:15:41,725 --> 01:15:44,535
Speaker 4:  from now until the end of the Trump administration, I want you to read out

1141
01:15:44,535 --> 01:15:48,335
Speaker 4:  loud. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 million. This one

1142
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,635
Speaker 4:  sounds even more lucrative. And I the,

1143
01:15:52,495 --> 01:15:56,195
Speaker 4:  if you give him what he want, he will come after you for more over and over

1144
01:15:56,215 --> 01:16:00,075
Speaker 4:  and over. This has been the story. He put it on truth social that

1145
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:03,715
Speaker 4:  what he wants from you is either fey or money, and ideally

1146
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:07,635
Speaker 4:  both the end, he thinks all of the late night hosts are mean to him. And

1147
01:16:07,635 --> 01:16:11,435
Speaker 4:  so he wants to cancel their shows and get money from them. Anything you think

1148
01:16:11,455 --> 01:16:14,635
Speaker 4:  is not one of those two things is wrong because he's the president of the

1149
01:16:14,635 --> 01:16:17,715
Speaker 4:  United States and he's posting about it on truth social. Like it's just,

1150
01:16:17,715 --> 01:16:21,275
Speaker 4:  it's right there in front of you. This is what they're trying to do.

1151
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:22,115
Speaker 4:  That's it.

1152
01:16:22,575 --> 01:16:26,235
Speaker 11:  So I just, I the thing that I wanna add here, because

1153
01:16:26,555 --> 01:16:30,435
Speaker 11:  I think all of that is correct, David, is that also this

1154
01:16:30,775 --> 01:16:34,675
Speaker 11:  man has the glassies of Glass Jaws because if you

1155
01:16:34,705 --> 01:16:35,875
Speaker 11:  just say no

1156
01:16:37,495 --> 01:16:41,465
Speaker 11:  and you just don't do it, he pivots,

1157
01:16:41,845 --> 01:16:44,185
Speaker 11:  he goes and bullies somebody else. And

1158
01:16:45,885 --> 01:16:49,585
Speaker 11:  it would be really nice if anybody

1159
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:53,825
Speaker 11:  who thinks of themselves as a leader of anything, like

1160
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:58,105
Speaker 11:  let's say the Democratic party let perhaps a

1161
01:16:58,225 --> 01:17:02,065
Speaker 11:  CEO of some kind, maybe a university president

1162
01:17:02,615 --> 01:17:06,425
Speaker 11:  were to observe this phenomenon and just

1163
01:17:06,645 --> 01:17:07,145
Speaker 11:  say no,

1164
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:12,215
Speaker 4:  What a, what a concept. Like you'll, you'll notice John Oliver,

1165
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:16,175
Speaker 4:  who I think has done a terrific job of like

1166
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:19,935
Speaker 4:  the thing he said, which is the four words you say to somebody who is bullying

1167
01:17:19,955 --> 01:17:23,655
Speaker 4:  you. Like, this is, fuck you, make me really interesting.

1168
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:27,535
Speaker 4:  Trump is not spending a lot of time posting about how bad John Oliver

1169
01:17:27,835 --> 01:17:31,575
Speaker 4:  is. Truly fascinating. Hmm. I suspect he is probably going to tell

1170
01:17:31,675 --> 01:17:34,975
Speaker 4:  one of the elephants to do something about it if and when they own the company

1171
01:17:34,975 --> 01:17:38,175
Speaker 4:  that runs John Oliver's show. But that's a whole different story.

1172
01:17:38,805 --> 01:17:42,745
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Meanwhile, I really like, I I'm glad you brought this up, Liz

1173
01:17:42,745 --> 01:17:45,665
Speaker 4:  And I I think we should just briefly make sure we do not let Brenda Carr

1174
01:17:45,665 --> 01:17:49,585
Speaker 4:  off the hook for backtracking so hard and

1175
01:17:49,725 --> 01:17:53,585
Speaker 4:  so aggressively and so like cowardly

1176
01:17:54,165 --> 01:17:57,025
Speaker 4:  on the whole easy way or the hard way thing. Because at the beginning of

1177
01:17:57,025 --> 01:18:00,985
Speaker 4:  this, he went on Benny Johnson's YouTube channel and said about the Kimmel

1178
01:18:00,985 --> 01:18:03,985
Speaker 4:  thing, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. And it is very clear

1179
01:18:03,985 --> 01:18:06,985
Speaker 4:  what that means. My guy has been out here threatening to get rid of everybody's

1180
01:18:06,985 --> 01:18:10,105
Speaker 4:  broadcast licenses at the drop of a hat. Like if you, if you wear the wrong

1181
01:18:10,105 --> 01:18:12,745
Speaker 4:  color t-shirt, he's like, I'm gonna take away your broadcast license, I don't

1182
01:18:12,745 --> 01:18:16,665
Speaker 4:  like it. And then this time he is, he gave this really

1183
01:18:16,815 --> 01:18:20,545
Speaker 4:  long meandering answer about how actually the

1184
01:18:20,585 --> 01:18:22,545
Speaker 4:  FCC shouldn't have to be involved at all.

1185
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:27,785
Speaker 4:  And this is the easy way is that they just solve this problem for themselves.

1186
01:18:27,845 --> 01:18:31,745
Speaker 4:  And the hard way is somebody files an FCC complaint and

1187
01:18:31,745 --> 01:18:34,905
Speaker 4:  it's just like, Brendan, if you're, if you're gonna be this guy, be this

1188
01:18:34,925 --> 01:18:38,705
Speaker 4:  guy, don't like woos out the minute somebody cancels Disney

1189
01:18:38,705 --> 01:18:42,695
Speaker 4:  Plus because you're an idiot. Like, ugh. I almost like, I like

1190
01:18:42,855 --> 01:18:44,775
Speaker 4:  him less than I ever have. Now I

1191
01:18:44,775 --> 01:18:48,255
Speaker 11:  Will say this, for some of the other people that we make fun of on the show,

1192
01:18:48,555 --> 01:18:51,095
Speaker 11:  at least they have the courage of their convictions

1193
01:18:51,555 --> 01:18:55,335
Speaker 4:  Commit to the bit. Yes. Yeah, I agree.

1194
01:18:55,515 --> 01:18:58,295
Speaker 4:  All right, well that's, yeah, this week's version of Brendan Carr's dummy,

1195
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:01,855
Speaker 4:  I'm very angry about this whole situation and we're, we're gonna have to

1196
01:19:01,855 --> 01:19:05,655
Speaker 4:  do more of this because it is all increasingly tied together

1197
01:19:06,155 --> 01:19:10,095
Speaker 4:  in ways that feel worse and bad all

1198
01:19:10,095 --> 01:19:12,855
Speaker 4:  of the time. Jake, give us something else to talk about. Okay.

1199
01:19:13,325 --> 01:19:16,625
Speaker 5:  Temperature to, to, I'm gonna take the temperature down.

1200
01:19:17,955 --> 01:19:21,665
Speaker 5:  Maybe it depends if you just bought a new iPhone, there's headlines bound

1201
01:19:21,805 --> 01:19:25,335
Speaker 5:  on the internet about Scratch Gate, which is

1202
01:19:26,205 --> 01:19:30,095
Speaker 5:  this allegation that the, the new iPhone 17 pro

1203
01:19:30,115 --> 01:19:33,535
Speaker 5:  can be very easily scratched. The new models,

1204
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:37,975
Speaker 5:  they have two types of material on the back of the phone. There's a,

1205
01:19:38,325 --> 01:19:42,015
Speaker 5:  there's the ceramic shield coating on a portion of it,

1206
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:45,975
Speaker 5:  and then there's anodized aluminum. And if you scratch

1207
01:19:45,975 --> 01:19:49,865
Speaker 5:  stuff all over it, it it, it gets all dusty and, and it

1208
01:19:49,865 --> 01:19:52,985
Speaker 5:  looks bad. And there's all these photos of, from the Apple Store where people

1209
01:19:52,985 --> 01:19:56,225
Speaker 5:  are like, all these things are like getting nasty after just a day. And then

1210
01:19:56,585 --> 01:19:59,345
Speaker 5:  separately, there's this all, all this stuff about how like the edges are

1211
01:19:59,345 --> 01:20:03,105
Speaker 5:  susceptible scratches. David, I'm curious if you have seen any of these videos,

1212
01:20:03,245 --> 01:20:06,735
Speaker 5:  any of these photos? I, my, my

1213
01:20:07,005 --> 01:20:10,675
Speaker 5:  quick to, I I think this is all extremely overstated

1214
01:20:11,095 --> 01:20:12,035
Speaker 5:  and unimportant.

1215
01:20:12,435 --> 01:20:15,475
Speaker 4:  I can't believe you, you started this by saying the temperature is going

1216
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:18,395
Speaker 4:  to go down. Scratch Gate is real. Jake, is it Scratch

1217
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:18,595
Speaker 5:  Gate all

1218
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:23,035
Speaker 4:  Real exclamation point? I No, I do,

1219
01:20:23,135 --> 01:20:26,795
Speaker 4:  do I think the fact that you can scratch your phone is a bummer and is a

1220
01:20:26,795 --> 01:20:30,765
Speaker 4:  real thing. Yes. Do I think this is like,

1221
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:34,985
Speaker 4:  you know, everyone is canceled because of Scratch Gate? Probably not. Like,

1222
01:20:35,245 --> 01:20:38,905
Speaker 4:  the thing I think is sort of fascinating is the tech woven cases, Apple's

1223
01:20:38,905 --> 01:20:42,505
Speaker 4:  like new material ca seem to be fabulous. All of the tests of them have been

1224
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,825
Speaker 4:  very good. People are really impressed with how they look and how they're

1225
01:20:44,825 --> 01:20:48,585
Speaker 4:  holding up the fine woven was a disaster and tech woven seems to be pretty

1226
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:52,225
Speaker 4:  good. But I have gotten like a shocking number of

1227
01:20:52,285 --> 01:20:56,185
Speaker 4:  signal messages and emails and tips and all kinds of stuff from people being

1228
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:59,865
Speaker 4:  like, I went to the Apple store and all of the display models are scratched

1229
01:20:59,865 --> 01:21:03,745
Speaker 4:  to bits and there seems to be like, it seems to be

1230
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:04,065
Speaker 4:  real.

1231
01:21:04,245 --> 01:21:07,985
Speaker 5:  So I haven't scratched the phone myself, but I, you know,

1232
01:21:08,365 --> 01:21:11,825
Speaker 5:  wa I, I watched the Jerry rig everything video, he goes at that thing with

1233
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:15,545
Speaker 5:  some, some coins and some pics. Most of it apparently is

1234
01:21:15,825 --> 01:21:18,945
Speaker 5:  material transfer from the scratching object onto the phone that you can

1235
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:22,505
Speaker 5:  just wipe off. There's, it's a video. He just wipes the stuff off. It's fine,

1236
01:21:22,655 --> 01:21:25,985
Speaker 5:  it's fine. Just wipe off the phone. I don't know. I haven't tried. Maybe

1237
01:21:26,005 --> 01:21:29,865
Speaker 5:  it gets worse. Travis, our producer in the, he is shaking his head.

1238
01:21:29,865 --> 01:21:33,185
Speaker 5:  He thinks I'm dead wrong on this. So listen, the title

1239
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:35,985
Speaker 4:  Of this episode is going to be Scratch Gate, exclamation Point, scratch Gate.

1240
01:21:36,165 --> 01:21:39,465
Speaker 5:  Listen, if I'm wrong, send me some videos of

1241
01:21:39,925 --> 01:21:43,105
Speaker 5:  wiping off the back of an iPhone. It doesn't come off. And I will, I will

1242
01:21:43,175 --> 01:21:46,225
Speaker 5:  acknowledge that I have aired here,

1243
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:49,585
Speaker 5:  but if not, put a case in your phone, it'll be fine.

1244
01:21:49,845 --> 01:21:50,825
Speaker 4:  Liz, are you a case person?

1245
01:21:51,175 --> 01:21:54,625
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I am. But I just wanted to say there is a real scandal here that I

1246
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:58,385
Speaker 11:  feel no one is covering in the media. So I'm, I'm gonna take my position,

1247
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:02,345
Speaker 11:  you know, 'cause I feel, I feel morally obligated

1248
01:22:02,925 --> 01:22:06,905
Speaker 11:  to speak for the iPhone mini people. As someone who recently

1249
01:22:07,225 --> 01:22:10,865
Speaker 11:  replaced the battery on her iPhone mini because the bones are too big.

1250
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:14,305
Speaker 11:  I just want, you know, there are a lot of us out here who have small hands

1251
01:22:14,405 --> 01:22:17,625
Speaker 11:  and the phones are too large. And it would be so nice

1252
01:22:18,245 --> 01:22:21,505
Speaker 11:  if the mini came back like every five years or so, every time I need to

1253
01:22:21,505 --> 01:22:22,465
Speaker 11:  buy a phone. That's all

1254
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:26,225
Speaker 4:  Agreed a hundred percent. I think all of the people who love the

1255
01:22:26,325 --> 01:22:30,225
Speaker 4:  iPhone Air would've loved it more if it was smaller And I think it would

1256
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:34,185
Speaker 4:  suddenly be everybody's favorite phone. I think the, the thing about this

1257
01:22:34,185 --> 01:22:38,115
Speaker 4:  that is actually a bummer to me is I think we just

1258
01:22:38,595 --> 01:22:42,475
Speaker 4:  continue down the road of needing to baby our phones. And I

1259
01:22:42,475 --> 01:22:46,315
Speaker 4:  think, I think everyone needs to spend more time building phones that

1260
01:22:46,315 --> 01:22:49,555
Speaker 4:  we don't need to worry about. And just the idea that my phone

1261
01:22:50,325 --> 01:22:54,115
Speaker 4:  might get gross because I throw it in my bag or have it in my

1262
01:22:54,435 --> 01:22:57,835
Speaker 4:  pocket is a bummer. And, and these things are just

1263
01:22:58,335 --> 01:23:01,795
Speaker 4:  too mature and too important to be

1264
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:05,725
Speaker 4:  that kind of thing. And we're making real progress on like, my screen doesn't

1265
01:23:05,725 --> 01:23:08,925
Speaker 4:  shatter if I look at it wrong. Like, that's great And I think that's awesome.

1266
01:23:09,105 --> 01:23:12,405
Speaker 4:  But e every single time this happens, it's like two steps forward and one

1267
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:16,285
Speaker 4:  step back. We've invented a new way to screw up your phone And I just think

1268
01:23:16,285 --> 01:23:16,845
Speaker 4:  that's a bummer,

1269
01:23:17,015 --> 01:23:19,645
Speaker 11:  David. The phone gets gross because your hands are filthy.

1270
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:22,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean we are the gross ones. It's really

1271
01:23:22,005 --> 01:23:24,925
Speaker 11:  Right. The call is coming from inside the house, man.

1272
01:23:24,995 --> 01:23:28,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, that's, that's fair. I can't really disagree with that. If you

1273
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:32,605
Speaker 4:  want to rant and rave to Jake about Scratch Gate, please call the

1274
01:23:32,605 --> 01:23:36,045
Speaker 4:  hotline. It's six six version one one. Nothing would make me happier than

1275
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:39,005
Speaker 4:  playing a bunch of angry Scratch Gate voicemails at Jake on next week's episode.

1276
01:23:39,005 --> 01:23:41,845
Speaker 4:  So please call with all of your feelings about Scratch Gate.

1277
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:47,245
Speaker 4:  My next one, Liz, I picked this specifically because I want to talk to you

1278
01:23:47,245 --> 01:23:50,925
Speaker 4:  about it for a minute. I have been sort of against my own

1279
01:23:51,075 --> 01:23:55,045
Speaker 4:  best interests, fascinated by these like digital writing tools for

1280
01:23:55,045 --> 01:23:58,645
Speaker 4:  forever. I have garbage handwriting, I don't write ever. And yet every time

1281
01:23:58,835 --> 01:24:02,485
Speaker 4:  Live Scribe is like, we've built a, we've built a smart notebook, like I

1282
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:06,285
Speaker 4:  will spend $75 on it this time it's

1283
01:24:06,805 --> 01:24:10,645
Speaker 4:  Mont Blanc, which came out with what I can only describe as

1284
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:14,485
Speaker 4:  like a pretty simple digital ink

1285
01:24:14,585 --> 01:24:18,165
Speaker 4:  screen thing and a digital pen. The difference is it is

1286
01:24:18,315 --> 01:24:21,565
Speaker 4:  modeled on a Mont Blanc pen and importantly It costs

1287
01:24:21,595 --> 01:24:25,005
Speaker 4:  $905. It's called the Mont Blanc digital paper.

1288
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:28,885
Speaker 4:  It's a writing tablet. And what I wanna know is, Liz, you are the verges

1289
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:32,725
Speaker 4:  preeminent pen and paper scholar. What do you make of these things? Is this

1290
01:24:32,725 --> 01:24:35,885
Speaker 4:  a good idea? Are you gonna buy a Mont Blanc e Inc tablet?

1291
01:24:36,545 --> 01:24:40,525
Speaker 11:  No, first of all, because I have a bunch of bottles of like

1292
01:24:40,555 --> 01:24:44,445
Speaker 11:  real ink, like actually real ink to use

1293
01:24:44,445 --> 01:24:48,405
Speaker 11:  up. Wow. But I will say as somebody who spends

1294
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:52,005
Speaker 11:  too much time thinking about fountain pens, Mont Blanc is pretty well known

1295
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:55,285
Speaker 11:  in the Fountain Pin community for being incredibly

1296
01:24:55,895 --> 01:24:56,565
Speaker 11:  overpriced.

1297
01:24:58,205 --> 01:25:01,965
Speaker 11:  Interesting. And if you are interested in quality pens, there are

1298
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:05,765
Speaker 11:  a lot better options out there. It's sort of more of a

1299
01:25:05,905 --> 01:25:09,765
Speaker 11:  status symbol than like a real leader in making

1300
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:14,125
Speaker 11:  good pens. And in particular, you know, the, the

1301
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:18,045
Speaker 11:  sort of consensus seems to be that like the peak for Mont

1302
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:21,445
Speaker 11:  Blanc was like, I don't know, the 1960s or the

1303
01:25:21,605 --> 01:25:25,565
Speaker 11:  1970s. So if you are thinking about a Mont Blanc pen, like you should go

1304
01:25:25,565 --> 01:25:29,085
Speaker 11:  on eBay and get a used one and or a lot of them have been refurbished. And

1305
01:25:29,085 --> 01:25:32,845
Speaker 11:  because these are fountain pens and not like modern technology,

1306
01:25:33,475 --> 01:25:37,445
Speaker 11:  they're durable and they don't crumble

1307
01:25:37,445 --> 01:25:41,405
Speaker 11:  after five years and they're meant to last forever. And if you take care

1308
01:25:41,405 --> 01:25:45,285
Speaker 11:  of them, they will. So that's sort of the, the pen and ink

1309
01:25:45,755 --> 01:25:47,085
Speaker 11:  take on Mont Blanc.

1310
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:50,325
Speaker 4:  That is good to know. I think when we publish this, I would say the overwhelming

1311
01:25:50,685 --> 01:25:54,565
Speaker 4:  reaction was A, this is ridiculously expensive and B I'm not

1312
01:25:54,565 --> 01:25:58,245
Speaker 4:  sure I trust Mont Blanc to be a good steward of a digital writing

1313
01:25:58,245 --> 01:26:01,565
Speaker 4:  system for a very long time. And I would say I agree with both of those things

1314
01:26:01,625 --> 01:26:05,085
Speaker 4:  and yet I look at this thing and I'm like, maybe that would make my handwriting

1315
01:26:05,085 --> 01:26:08,805
Speaker 4:  better. Like maybe, maybe, maybe I'll take handwritten

1316
01:26:08,805 --> 01:26:10,805
Speaker 4:  notes forever and everything will be lovely. David,

1317
01:26:10,985 --> 01:26:13,525
Speaker 11:  Can I pen enable you? Can I, can I send you a fountain pun?

1318
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,445
Speaker 4:  I literally, I was thinking about this. You you picked up that thing of ink

1319
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:19,045
Speaker 4:  And I had this moment of being like, literally if you handed that to me,

1320
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:22,765
Speaker 4:  I would have absolutely no idea what to do. I was like, I like,

1321
01:26:22,765 --> 01:26:26,045
Speaker 4:  okay, this is, I'm never gonna touch this again. I'm gonna put it down on

1322
01:26:26,045 --> 01:26:30,005
Speaker 4:  my desk and try not to spill it. But yes, please, nothing would make

1323
01:26:30,005 --> 01:26:33,605
Speaker 4:  me happier than becoming like a, everything about my personality suggests

1324
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:37,565
Speaker 4:  that I should be a real weirdo about pens. So I'm, I'm in, let's, let's

1325
01:26:37,565 --> 01:26:40,325
Speaker 4:  make this happen sometime. Let's do it. All right. Speaking of back to you,

1326
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:42,085
Speaker 4:  Liz, what's your, what's your second lightning round?

1327
01:26:42,315 --> 01:26:45,565
Speaker 11:  It's time to talk about ai. So

1328
01:26:45,905 --> 01:26:49,085
Speaker 11:  Nvidia has, oh God invested in open ai

1329
01:26:50,945 --> 01:26:54,885
Speaker 11:  and it's, here's the thing, I, you know,

1330
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:58,925
Speaker 11:  I I I have this obsession with

1331
01:26:59,185 --> 01:27:03,085
Speaker 11:  how this, this, the money is going here

1332
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:06,965
Speaker 11:  because I just, I, it mm mm If there's just

1333
01:27:06,965 --> 01:27:07,805
Speaker 11:  something that feels

1334
01:27:09,675 --> 01:27:13,345
Speaker 11:  weird to me about Nvidia investing in so many

1335
01:27:13,665 --> 01:27:17,145
Speaker 11:  companies that buy Nvidia chips, like people are handing the same

1336
01:27:17,335 --> 01:27:21,185
Speaker 11:  $5 back and forth and it wasn't just, you know,

1337
01:27:21,735 --> 01:27:25,625
Speaker 11:  open ai, it's core weave too. And there's like this whole ecosystem

1338
01:27:26,055 --> 01:27:29,785
Speaker 11:  that Nvidia is investing in that then turns around and buys a bunch of

1339
01:27:29,925 --> 01:27:33,665
Speaker 11:  Nvidia products. And then OpenAI of course has

1340
01:27:33,725 --> 01:27:37,425
Speaker 11:  its investments in a number of companies that are dependent on the open

1341
01:27:37,605 --> 01:27:41,385
Speaker 11:  AI platform. And there's just this, it's like a

1342
01:27:41,675 --> 01:27:45,105
Speaker 11:  brats nest of money and

1343
01:27:45,105 --> 01:27:48,425
Speaker 11:  investments. And I feel

1344
01:27:48,815 --> 01:27:52,745
Speaker 11:  that this is maybe the best, the best way to like look at it

1345
01:27:52,745 --> 01:27:56,305
Speaker 11:  and think about it. This, this partnership which like

1346
01:27:57,555 --> 01:28:01,425
Speaker 11:  feels kind of vague. Like the partnership, which was announced Monday, says

1347
01:28:01,425 --> 01:28:05,345
Speaker 11:  that OpenAI is going to build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts

1348
01:28:05,345 --> 01:28:08,025
Speaker 11:  of AI data centers with Nvidia systems.

1349
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:12,545
Speaker 11:  And Nvidia intends to invest

1350
01:28:13,085 --> 01:28:16,945
Speaker 11:  100 billion in AI as each gigawatt is deployed.

1351
01:28:17,245 --> 01:28:20,745
Speaker 11:  So like, I wanna be clear about how open this is about being

1352
01:28:20,745 --> 01:28:24,585
Speaker 11:  completely circular. Like this is like in the, the text of the deal.

1353
01:28:25,065 --> 01:28:28,705
Speaker 11:  I am bewildered by this because it feels like I'm watching

1354
01:28:30,415 --> 01:28:34,275
Speaker 11:  it. It feels like I'm watching like a, a, a spring, like start

1355
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:37,435
Speaker 11:  to wind up and get tighter and tighter and tighter.

1356
01:28:39,005 --> 01:28:42,475
Speaker 11:  Which, you know, I maybe, maybe,

1357
01:28:42,925 --> 01:28:46,715
Speaker 11:  maybe I'm just being paranoid, but given

1358
01:28:46,815 --> 01:28:50,715
Speaker 11:  how much of the current economy is dependent

1359
01:28:51,015 --> 01:28:54,835
Speaker 11:  on AI and AI investment, which is

1360
01:28:54,905 --> 01:28:56,195
Speaker 11:  substantial by the way

1361
01:28:58,695 --> 01:29:02,645
Speaker 11:  I am, I'm wondering that like, this seems like a pretty fragile ecosystem

1362
01:29:02,745 --> 01:29:06,285
Speaker 11:  if everybody is constantly, you know, winding

1363
01:29:06,695 --> 01:29:10,445
Speaker 11:  money up with each other. What happens if one part of that

1364
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:11,325
Speaker 11:  system fails?

1365
01:29:13,465 --> 01:29:17,285
Speaker 11:  So just putting that out there that this is yet another

1366
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:21,365
Speaker 11:  sort of winding of the crank of what appears to me

1367
01:29:21,505 --> 01:29:25,045
Speaker 11:  to be a feedback machine. Let's see how it goes.

1368
01:29:25,495 --> 01:29:28,445
Speaker 4:  There was a great Wall Street Journal story this week

1369
01:29:29,385 --> 01:29:32,765
Speaker 4:  and the headline was, Nvidia has a problem colon too much money.

1370
01:29:33,305 --> 01:29:36,925
Speaker 4:  And that is like, if, if that is not an indication of like the

1371
01:29:37,115 --> 01:29:40,685
Speaker 4:  strangeness of this moment that we're in, I don't, I don't know what is,

1372
01:29:40,845 --> 01:29:44,765
Speaker 4:  'cause I think you're right that not only is is the bet on

1373
01:29:45,065 --> 01:29:48,285
Speaker 4:  ai, the thing that is propping everything else up, but it is like specifically

1374
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:52,245
Speaker 4:  Nvidia, I saw somebody characterize the Nvidia open AI investment as

1375
01:29:52,245 --> 01:29:55,525
Speaker 4:  Nvidia giving open AI a $100 billion Nvidia gift card,

1376
01:29:56,325 --> 01:30:00,165
Speaker 4:  which I like very much and feels about right. And it is

1377
01:30:00,165 --> 01:30:03,885
Speaker 4:  just like, it is, it is wild how much of this whole race

1378
01:30:03,945 --> 01:30:07,845
Speaker 4:  is tied up in this one company. And that's not to suggest that

1379
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:11,605
Speaker 4:  like, it, it is on its own. Like I've called in open AI a house of cards

1380
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:14,045
Speaker 4:  that's about to collapse And I still kind of believe that Nvidia doesn't

1381
01:30:14,045 --> 01:30:17,685
Speaker 4:  seem to be that Nvidia seems to just be doing great and have just made a

1382
01:30:17,685 --> 01:30:20,765
Speaker 4:  lot of correct calls all in a row. But it is still weird

1383
01:30:21,475 --> 01:30:25,405
Speaker 4:  that everything is so tied up in this one company, which is now just like

1384
01:30:25,835 --> 01:30:29,805
Speaker 4:  pouring all of the money that it has back into the rest of the industry because

1385
01:30:29,805 --> 01:30:32,485
Speaker 4:  it doesn't know what else to do with all of this money. It's just wild.

1386
01:30:32,865 --> 01:30:36,765
Speaker 11:  So I want to recap some very recent history, which is

1387
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,085
Speaker 11:  not tech history in which you may be unfamiliar with,

1388
01:30:41,225 --> 01:30:44,965
Speaker 11:  but one of the driving forces of the 2008 financial

1389
01:30:44,965 --> 01:30:48,725
Speaker 11:  crisis was the shadow banking system. There were all these money market

1390
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:52,365
Speaker 11:  funds, which worked kind of like a savings account,

1391
01:30:52,505 --> 01:30:55,965
Speaker 11:  but not really that had more money

1392
01:30:56,315 --> 01:30:59,925
Speaker 11:  than they knew what to do with in terms of investments. And that was what

1393
01:30:59,925 --> 01:31:03,845
Speaker 11:  drove the demand for mortgages. That was like the, the initial thing winding

1394
01:31:03,845 --> 01:31:07,655
Speaker 11:  the crank. And so seeing that

1395
01:31:07,835 --> 01:31:11,735
Speaker 11:  Nvidia has more money than it knows what to do with and watching

1396
01:31:11,735 --> 01:31:15,415
Speaker 11:  it make some of these investments. I mean, maybe I just have

1397
01:31:15,485 --> 01:31:19,255
Speaker 11:  like great financial crisis, PTSD

1398
01:31:19,255 --> 01:31:23,055
Speaker 11:  since that happened, you know, very early in my career and very early

1399
01:31:23,075 --> 01:31:23,735
Speaker 11:  in my adulthood.

1400
01:31:26,655 --> 01:31:28,035
Speaker 11:  But I don't like the parallel.

1401
01:31:29,305 --> 01:31:32,435
Speaker 4:  Yeah, listen, it's not, we're not saying it's the same thing, it's just that

1402
01:31:32,435 --> 01:31:34,475
Speaker 4:  it has all the same characteristics, you know what I mean?

1403
01:31:36,855 --> 01:31:38,715
Speaker 11:  Anyway, TBD Yeah, let's see how this goes.

1404
01:31:38,895 --> 01:31:42,675
Speaker 4:  No, I think the, the, yeah, all of the money

1405
01:31:42,815 --> 01:31:46,395
Speaker 4:  is like, I'm, I'm increasingly like, I really like your, your, your

1406
01:31:46,395 --> 01:31:50,075
Speaker 4:  characterization of it as everybody's just passing the same $5 around. And

1407
01:31:50,075 --> 01:31:53,635
Speaker 4:  I think if you look at it like that, it makes a lot of what's happening in

1408
01:31:53,735 --> 01:31:57,635
Speaker 4:  AI seem sort of absurd. And I think that is probably

1409
01:31:57,635 --> 01:32:01,005
Speaker 4:  the correct way to be looking at all of this right now. The the stakes are

1410
01:32:01,005 --> 01:32:03,885
Speaker 4:  super high and it is all nonsense all at the same time. Somehow.

1411
01:32:04,365 --> 01:32:08,205
Speaker 11:  I can't speak to like the tech end of AI because I

1412
01:32:08,205 --> 01:32:11,885
Speaker 11:  am a technology normal. I'm like the only technology normal we employ besides

1413
01:32:11,885 --> 01:32:13,045
Speaker 11:  our features editor. I think listen,

1414
01:32:13,045 --> 01:32:15,885
Speaker 4:  You, you already showed us the thing of fountain pen ink on your desk. Like

1415
01:32:15,885 --> 01:32:17,085
Speaker 4:  we get it. We're,

1416
01:32:17,145 --> 01:32:20,805
Speaker 11:  We understand, but I gotta say I

1417
01:32:21,095 --> 01:32:24,925
Speaker 11:  don't understand the financial end of AI or how it ever makes

1418
01:32:24,925 --> 01:32:28,605
Speaker 11:  money because the thing about software is that you make a thing once and

1419
01:32:28,605 --> 01:32:31,485
Speaker 11:  then you copy it infinity times and you make infinity profit.

1420
01:32:32,745 --> 01:32:36,565
Speaker 11:  And we know from streaming that as, you know, if you're, if you have

1421
01:32:36,565 --> 01:32:40,445
Speaker 11:  something that requires servers as more people use it, like you have to

1422
01:32:40,505 --> 01:32:44,325
Speaker 11:  invest more, more stuff. And the only

1423
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:47,525
Speaker 11:  explanation I've heard for how AI makes money is like, it like

1424
01:32:47,605 --> 01:32:51,525
Speaker 11:  mysteriously gets much cheaper and better very fast. Like, which to me

1425
01:32:51,525 --> 01:32:55,325
Speaker 11:  is like the underpants gnomes explanation of how AI makes money.

1426
01:32:57,155 --> 01:33:00,805
Speaker 11:  Like, it, it, it just mysteriously happens because what I

1427
01:33:01,045 --> 01:33:04,605
Speaker 11:  I kind of see happening is like, if this is a big, if by the way, given

1428
01:33:05,155 --> 01:33:08,885
Speaker 11:  AI's current capabilities, but if AI does become an important part

1429
01:33:09,105 --> 01:33:12,885
Speaker 11:  of the business world or people's personal lives and we,

1430
01:33:12,905 --> 01:33:16,645
Speaker 11:  we have to scale all these data centers up, that's, that's

1431
01:33:16,715 --> 01:33:20,645
Speaker 11:  just so expensive that I don't, I don't understand

1432
01:33:20,705 --> 01:33:21,885
Speaker 11:  how this works financially.

1433
01:33:22,195 --> 01:33:26,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah, if you do tell us, but I won't believe you. Please

1434
01:33:26,235 --> 01:33:27,165
Speaker 4:  just in case you're wondering,

1435
01:33:28,455 --> 01:33:31,965
Speaker 11:  Email me. We, we would, Liz at The Verge tell me how it works financially.

1436
01:33:32,245 --> 01:33:35,085
Speaker 11:  I would love to, like, seriously, I'm not kidding. Like, email me,

1437
01:33:35,085 --> 01:33:37,085
Speaker 4:  Please help my family is starving. Like,

1438
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,245
Speaker 4:  all right Jake, you're up last, what's your, what's your second lightning

1439
01:33:41,245 --> 01:33:41,965
Speaker 4:  round? Okay, David,

1440
01:33:42,765 --> 01:33:46,525
Speaker 5:  I both of you quickly, how much would you pay for a dark mode theme

1441
01:33:46,665 --> 01:33:47,525
Speaker 5:  on your favorite app?

1442
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:51,025
Speaker 4:  You know, I'm the wrong person to ask this question.

1443
01:33:52,005 --> 01:33:54,945
Speaker 5:  Is the answer $900 a year? No.

1444
01:33:55,305 --> 01:33:56,385
Speaker 4:  No it isn't. I can tell you that.

1445
01:33:56,535 --> 01:34:00,345
Speaker 5:  Well then American Express's new platinum card

1446
01:34:00,345 --> 01:34:04,305
Speaker 5:  is not for you. They recently raised the price on

1447
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:07,825
Speaker 5:  their platinum card. It costs $895 a year,

1448
01:34:07,995 --> 01:34:11,785
Speaker 5:  which as is a little more than the $0

1449
01:34:11,815 --> 01:34:15,745
Speaker 5:  that I prefer to pay for a credit card. But to make it a

1450
01:34:15,745 --> 01:34:19,535
Speaker 5:  more appealing offer, they said, Hey, we've got a new app feature.

1451
01:34:19,965 --> 01:34:23,875
Speaker 5:  They have a quote premium theme and it

1452
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:27,715
Speaker 5:  turns the, the app from I think a dark blue to

1453
01:34:27,725 --> 01:34:28,075
Speaker 5:  black

1454
01:34:28,305 --> 01:34:31,715
Speaker 4:  Wait, this is now like a, a cardholder perk. They're like, okay, you get,

1455
01:34:32,055 --> 01:34:35,915
Speaker 4:  you get points at restaurants, you get insurance when you rent a car,

1456
01:34:35,915 --> 01:34:38,635
Speaker 4:  which by the way, one of the best reasons to get an Amex is rental car insurance.

1457
01:34:39,195 --> 01:34:40,955
Speaker 4:  And you get dark mode in the Amex app.

1458
01:34:41,665 --> 01:34:45,315
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you get dark mode. But only if you pay for like one of their finest

1459
01:34:45,315 --> 01:34:45,555
Speaker 5:  cards.

1460
01:34:46,695 --> 01:34:50,685
Speaker 4:  God, I hate things. Okay, I'm looking at this picture And I will say

1461
01:34:51,595 --> 01:34:52,415
Speaker 4:  the app looks sick.

1462
01:34:54,805 --> 01:34:55,735
Speaker 4:  Like they're

1463
01:34:55,735 --> 01:34:59,285
Speaker 5:  Not, listen, they're not wrong. The, you, you get all these points, you get

1464
01:34:59,285 --> 01:35:03,085
Speaker 5:  dark mode. What's not, what's the complaint about you? You'll, you'll make

1465
01:35:03,085 --> 01:35:06,685
Speaker 5:  that $900 a year back in terms of pleasure to your eyes.

1466
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:11,325
Speaker 4:  This is, this is literally, ugh, the platinum app experience introduces

1467
01:35:11,325 --> 01:35:14,285
Speaker 4:  a new premium theme. I'm reading their press release with latent dark modes

1468
01:35:14,285 --> 01:35:17,085
Speaker 4:  that match device settings. The redesigned overview screen brings together

1469
01:35:17,085 --> 01:35:20,365
Speaker 4:  welcome bonus progress tracking and account setup tasks in one dashboard.

1470
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:24,565
Speaker 4:  You know what this is like, this is like when, when BMW is like, we'll

1471
01:35:24,565 --> 01:35:28,405
Speaker 4:  make your car slightly faster but only for $500. This is

1472
01:35:28,405 --> 01:35:30,045
Speaker 4:  awful. This is like,

1473
01:35:30,395 --> 01:35:30,765
Speaker 5:  This is,

1474
01:35:31,045 --> 01:35:34,685
Speaker 4:  Honestly, this is some like Silicon Valley on HBO shit in the worst

1475
01:35:35,485 --> 01:35:35,885
Speaker 4:  possible way.

1476
01:35:36,245 --> 01:35:40,085
Speaker 5:  I, I a hundred percent am in support of this. I love this. I think this is

1477
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:44,085
Speaker 5:  ludicrous. I think this just fully lays out how ludicrous

1478
01:35:44,105 --> 01:35:47,885
Speaker 5:  the entire credit card situation is. I it's love

1479
01:35:48,165 --> 01:35:50,445
Speaker 5:  great. It's great. I love it. I'm sold

1480
01:35:51,805 --> 01:35:55,445
Speaker 4:  A short welcome video, an updated card art, make the experience premium from

1481
01:35:55,445 --> 01:35:59,325
Speaker 4:  the start. This is the worst. This, no, this makes me hate things.

1482
01:35:59,685 --> 01:36:02,725
Speaker 4:  I have a, I have a free American Express card that I'm now gonna have to

1483
01:36:02,725 --> 01:36:04,085
Speaker 4:  get rid of because I hate this so much.

1484
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,805
Speaker 5:  All your friends will know that you've got the cool card when you open up

1485
01:36:07,805 --> 01:36:11,325
Speaker 5:  the, the Amex app and it's all black and you're like, they're like, wish

1486
01:36:11,405 --> 01:36:12,085
Speaker 5:  I could have that.

1487
01:36:12,465 --> 01:36:15,485
Speaker 4:  No. All of your friends know you have the cool card because it's heavy and

1488
01:36:15,485 --> 01:36:18,965
Speaker 4:  metal and makes a sound when you performatively throw it on the table. That's

1489
01:36:18,965 --> 01:36:19,645
Speaker 4:  what I'm paying for.

1490
01:36:19,905 --> 01:36:23,205
Speaker 5:  No, but you don't use the card anymore because you're tapping to pay. It's

1491
01:36:23,205 --> 01:36:26,045
Speaker 5:  true. So you have to open it up, look your point balance in front of your

1492
01:36:26,045 --> 01:36:29,605
Speaker 5:  friends, be like, oh boy, all these points I've got from spending too much

1493
01:36:29,605 --> 01:36:33,525
Speaker 5:  money that I don't have on hotels. And they'll be like, wow,

1494
01:36:33,565 --> 01:36:33,685
Speaker 5:  I

1495
01:36:33,685 --> 01:36:36,445
Speaker 4:  Hate so much that you're exactly correct. That somewhere there was a meeting

1496
01:36:36,445 --> 01:36:39,965
Speaker 4:  where they were like, how, how are our members gonna communicate their status

1497
01:36:40,425 --> 01:36:44,125
Speaker 4:  in a digital world? And somebody was like, make the app black. And they were

1498
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:47,885
Speaker 4:  like, you're a genius. You're promoted $900 a year. This

1499
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:50,065
Speaker 4:  sucks. I don't like it at all.

1500
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:52,745
Speaker 11:  I, I I,

1501
01:36:54,985 --> 01:36:58,935
Speaker 11:  So you know how spam emails are

1502
01:36:59,335 --> 01:37:03,215
Speaker 11:  frequently misspelled so as to make sure that it finds

1503
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:04,695
Speaker 11:  the most credulous target.

1504
01:37:06,605 --> 01:37:10,375
Speaker 11:  This is that. But for credit cards, like the person for

1505
01:37:10,405 --> 01:37:13,855
Speaker 11:  whom $900 is nothing

1506
01:37:14,475 --> 01:37:18,455
Speaker 11:  to spend on a display is the person

1507
01:37:18,485 --> 01:37:21,735
Speaker 11:  they want to have that card. Like the person for whom

1508
01:37:22,285 --> 01:37:26,155
Speaker 11:  $900 is peanuts is, is exactly the

1509
01:37:26,155 --> 01:37:29,715
Speaker 11:  person they want to have that card. So I do think that there is like,

1510
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:33,675
Speaker 11:  there's some status signaling going on. I'm sure there's like a bunch of

1511
01:37:33,795 --> 01:37:37,715
Speaker 11:  I bankers who are like going to be getting this on the first day

1512
01:37:37,815 --> 01:37:41,235
Speaker 11:  so that they can whip it out when they go to whatever the

1513
01:37:41,315 --> 01:37:45,155
Speaker 11:  hotspots are. Now in New York, I haven't lived there in quite some time,

1514
01:37:45,295 --> 01:37:47,995
Speaker 11:  so I was gonna say Cipriani, but I don't even know if that's still open.

1515
01:37:49,855 --> 01:37:53,575
Speaker 11:  But like, you know, this is not just

1516
01:37:53,575 --> 01:37:57,205
Speaker 11:  status signaling. It's, it's it's selection. It's customer

1517
01:37:57,485 --> 01:37:57,685
Speaker 11:  selection.

1518
01:37:58,765 --> 01:38:02,505
Speaker 4:  It is. I will, I all of that is true. And I will say this, this suggests

1519
01:38:02,505 --> 01:38:05,385
Speaker 4:  that American Express only made one mistake in this whole thing, which is

1520
01:38:05,385 --> 01:38:08,345
Speaker 4:  that the background should not be black. It should be gold and it should

1521
01:38:08,345 --> 01:38:11,625
Speaker 4:  be, it should, your phone should be so shiny when you go to pay

1522
01:38:12,215 --> 01:38:16,025
Speaker 4:  with your sick premium card. 'cause who's gonna notice dark mode?

1523
01:38:16,025 --> 01:38:19,585
Speaker 4:  Dark mode just looks like dark mode. But if, if my phone glows gold, like

1524
01:38:19,585 --> 01:38:23,345
Speaker 4:  when Trump mobile does this, it's gonna be gold and it's gonna blow your

1525
01:38:23,345 --> 01:38:25,035
Speaker 4:  mind. You're gonna love it.

1526
01:38:26,805 --> 01:38:30,575
Speaker 4:  Also, somebody sent me an email saying that the Trump

1527
01:38:30,575 --> 01:38:34,455
Speaker 4:  mobile website now lists a bunch of refurbished Samsung and iPhones

1528
01:38:35,115 --> 01:38:38,655
Speaker 4:  as made in the USA, which Trump mobile has just gone

1529
01:38:38,885 --> 01:38:42,855
Speaker 4:  full nonsense. And that website and product are maintained by

1530
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,375
Speaker 4:  no one. And it's all made up.

1531
01:38:45,455 --> 01:38:48,695
Speaker 5:  I believe the phone is supposed to ship this month. So looking forward to

1532
01:38:48,695 --> 01:38:49,495
Speaker 5:  receiving hours.

1533
01:38:50,075 --> 01:38:53,815
Speaker 4:  If you got one, I would, I would, I want to hear from you. I wanna meet you

1534
01:38:53,815 --> 01:38:57,135
Speaker 4:  in person And I have a, I have, we have a lot to talk about. Alright. But

1535
01:38:57,135 --> 01:39:00,775
Speaker 4:  all that is for another show for now. It is, it is time for us to go. We've

1536
01:39:00,775 --> 01:39:03,735
Speaker 4:  gone way over as we are want to do renting. Carr is a dummy. Appears to be

1537
01:39:03,735 --> 01:39:07,335
Speaker 4:  back in just full force. I hate it. But

1538
01:39:07,445 --> 01:39:11,215
Speaker 4:  this is what we do here now. We have a lot coming up next week,

1539
01:39:11,315 --> 01:39:14,095
Speaker 4:  so stick around. We're gonna talk about smart home stuff. Like I said, Amazon

1540
01:39:14,115 --> 01:39:17,895
Speaker 4:  has the big Echo event coming up next week. Google's doing some stuff. Presumably

1541
01:39:17,895 --> 01:39:20,535
Speaker 4:  there will be more TikTok stuff to talk about. So Jake, Liz,
