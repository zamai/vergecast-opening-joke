Description: Apple spent 90 minutes talking about the future of its software, and we're pretty sure only said the word "Siri" once. Nilay and David are joined by The Verge's Victoria Song and Allison Johnson, both of whom were with Nilay at the keynote, to talk about all the news of the day. They talk about the Liquid Glass design language, and why Apple decided to redesign all its software. They talk about Spotlight on the Mac, the new multitasking features on the iPad, the typing indicators on the iPhone, Workout Buddy on the Watch, personas on the Vision Pro, and everything else that Apple announced — or, in a few cases, pointedly didn't announce — on stage. We're just starting to try out some of this software, and it's all likely to change a lot before it hits your devices this fall. And we'll have lots of thoughts along the way.

00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:23,885
Speaker 6:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Liquid Glass.

3
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:28,045
Speaker 6:  And you have to say it like that every single time. I'm m your friend David

4
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:29,645
Speaker 6:  Pierce. Neli Patella is here. Hi Neli.

5
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,285
Speaker 7:  Hello. Here I am.

6
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,245
Speaker 6:  Neli is doing great. Everybody we're having a day. Allison

7
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:36,685
Speaker 6:  Johnson's also here. Hi Allison.

8
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:37,725
Speaker 8:  Hello.

9
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:42,005
Speaker 6:  You guys are in Cupertino for ww DC Keynote

10
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:45,485
Speaker 6:  was today V Song who was also there is gonna join us in a little bit. She's

11
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:49,085
Speaker 6:  still at some meeting, but it's gonna show up. But it was today was

12
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:53,085
Speaker 6:  ww DC day. I found myself sadder not to be there than I expected.

13
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:57,085
Speaker 6:  So just gimme the vibe. Check-in. How's the day been? How do you guys feel?

14
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:59,905
Speaker 6:  Are you alive? Are we okay? We're alive.

15
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:03,665
Speaker 7:  Okay. It was, it was a loose day. There was like not a lot

16
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:04,305
Speaker 7:  going on,

17
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:09,345
Speaker 7:  right? Like the number of new ideas that we have enforced to contend with

18
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:13,625
Speaker 7:  are fairly limited. There's a lot of new feature ideas

19
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:17,585
Speaker 7:  and a lot of, a lot of stuff to talk about, but there's no grand

20
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:22,725
Speaker 7:  big thing that we all have to be like, let me wrap my head around

21
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,685
Speaker 7:  this. There's a menu bar on the iPad, David,

22
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:29,845
Speaker 6:  So a, I would argue that is very much a big thing, but B

23
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,485
Speaker 6:  like last year, that thing was Apple intelligence, right? They were like,

24
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:35,925
Speaker 6:  this is, this is the grand new way of thinking about technology that is going

25
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:36,725
Speaker 6:  to change everything forever.

26
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:41,845
Speaker 6:  This year. There was, there wasn't even all that much Apple

27
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:45,645
Speaker 6:  intelligence this year, which we should talk about. Allison,

28
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,125
Speaker 6:  what, how did you feel? What were the, what were the vibes like in the room?

29
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:52,865
Speaker 8:  The vibes are kind of like, there was a lot of

30
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:56,385
Speaker 8:  curiosity I think, about how Apple would handle or like

31
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,125
Speaker 8:  address any of the Siri Apple intelligence

32
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:04,365
Speaker 8:  stuff, which was, it was interesting. They didn't shy

33
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:08,245
Speaker 8:  away from saying Apple Intelligence, which was

34
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:12,125
Speaker 8:  a little surprising to me. Yeah. They kind of sprinkled it in throughout

35
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,805
Speaker 8:  rather than the big, like it's an Apple intelligence show,

36
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:19,885
Speaker 8:  but we did not hear Siri's name I don't think a single time,

37
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:21,805
Speaker 8:  correct me if I'm wrong.

38
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:23,645
Speaker 6:  I think the answer is once

39
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,565
Speaker 8:  Maybe. Yeah. Okay.

40
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:29,125
Speaker 6:  I would not swear to this, but I think ironically right at the beginning,

41
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,405
Speaker 6:  basically explaining why they weren't going to talk about Siri more. I think

42
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:35,445
Speaker 6:  Craig Federighe said Siri once. Yeah, yeah.

43
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:38,205
Speaker 7:  At the very beginning they said it, you know, all of our plans will come

44
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:38,365
Speaker 7:  true

45
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:39,165
Speaker 6:  Right?

46
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,045
Speaker 7:  In the coming year. Here's what I can tell you, just based on vibes on the

47
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:45,365
Speaker 7:  ground, they are furious that people think that last year

48
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,365
Speaker 7:  they showed a fake Siri.

49
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:49,305
Speaker 6:  Oh, interesting. Wow.

50
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:53,265
Speaker 7:  So they, they want people to know

51
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:57,065
Speaker 7:  that they're gonna do it. It's coming

52
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:02,225
Speaker 7:  and like what they, they showed was real

53
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,365
Speaker 7:  and they just weren't happy with it. And so it's coming.

54
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:09,525
Speaker 6:  But, so it's actually, I feel like it's worse if it worked, right? Because

55
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:12,245
Speaker 6:  it's one thing to be like, here's a cool concept video we think we can make.

56
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:16,325
Speaker 6:  It's another to be like, here is the product, it's done, we've made it. And

57
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:16,525
Speaker 6:  then

58
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:21,505
Speaker 6:  at some point somebody's like, nevermind, actually it sucks. Like that's

59
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:23,665
Speaker 6:  that it all, it's it's, it's weird either way.

60
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,235
Speaker 7:  I don't like, again, the vibes, right? What are the vibes? The vibes are,

61
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:31,995
Speaker 7:  everyone knows that this is the elephant in the room that last year they

62
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:35,715
Speaker 7:  announce this thing. They didn't ship. They were gonna talk about Apple Intelligence

63
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:39,475
Speaker 7:  is here. You know, apple is the royal family. Never complain,

64
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:43,515
Speaker 7:  never explain. Like that's just how they roll. Yeah. And so

65
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:46,395
Speaker 7:  they confidently muscled their way through their, their presentation. They,

66
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:49,875
Speaker 7:  they showed off Liquid Glass, all the stuff they're gonna show off. They

67
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,875
Speaker 7:  showed off a bunch of artificial intelligence features that are expanding

68
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,155
Speaker 7:  and the fact that they didn't ship Siri, they are willing to own up to, but

69
00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:01,145
Speaker 7:  they're, the answer is it wasn't good enough. And we only ship

70
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:04,425
Speaker 7:  things that are good enough. Right. And what I would connect that to is the

71
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:07,985
Speaker 7:  fact that no products that have made the same promises about

72
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:12,965
Speaker 7:  being able to do stuff on your phone for you are good enough.

73
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:17,625
Speaker 7:  Like we haven't seen the smart assistant be good enough anywhere in the

74
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:21,785
Speaker 7:  industry. Right. And whether or not you think that connects to whether like,

75
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:25,105
Speaker 7:  whether AI as we understand it today can actually do it,

76
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:28,745
Speaker 7:  or whether you think everyone is just kind of dumb. There's a little bit

77
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,665
Speaker 7:  of column B and a little bit of column B at at work here. But

78
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,545
Speaker 7:  like, they're, they're, they, they want you to

79
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,825
Speaker 7:  know that their goal is making great products and that's what they're gonna

80
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:43,785
Speaker 7:  do. And that I saw some, you know, some folks in the press just like milling

81
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:47,305
Speaker 7:  around and they're like, there's some quiet tension and uncertainty here

82
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,065
Speaker 7:  because no one knows how they're gonna address it. And then they just muscled

83
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:50,505
Speaker 7:  through their thing.

84
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:55,225
Speaker 6:  I mean, I was, I I will say I was sort of impressed that they at least like

85
00:05:56,135 --> 00:06:00,045
Speaker 6:  half acknowledged it at the beginning. The like, we're still working on

86
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:03,815
Speaker 6:  it. It's taking longer than we thought in the coming year is like, even that

87
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:07,295
Speaker 6:  is more than I expected Apple to do. Like traditionally Apple would just

88
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,855
Speaker 6:  memory hole the whole idea that it had ever spoken the word Siri

89
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:15,815
Speaker 6:  aloud in history and just keep going. And we'd all be like,

90
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:17,335
Speaker 6:  do you know that Siri exists?

91
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,175
Speaker 7:  Well, you know, they walked right, I'm sure we're gonna talk about this,

92
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:23,535
Speaker 7:  but they walked right up to the line of all the things they said Siri would

93
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:27,455
Speaker 7:  be able to do, but in like other formats. So if you

94
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:30,735
Speaker 7:  look at Spotlight search and what it can and can't do now,

95
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:35,295
Speaker 7:  you know, like, oh, why wouldn't I just talk to this? That's the

96
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:38,975
Speaker 7:  Siri you want. And they're, it's not, they have, they just didn't connect

97
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:39,415
Speaker 7:  the dots.

98
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,215
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Or they'll like, take a screenshot and add something to your calendar.

99
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:47,175
Speaker 8:  I'm like, that's that's Siri, right? We're just calling it

100
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,855
Speaker 8:  something else. Or I, it feels like they were a little bit

101
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:55,695
Speaker 8:  hesitant to kind of be like, look, look at this intelligence. They were

102
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:59,655
Speaker 8:  sort of like sprinkling it throughout rather than making

103
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:03,935
Speaker 8:  such a big show of it this time. Maybe just they felt

104
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,975
Speaker 8:  burned by how everything went last year.

105
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:07,815
Speaker 7:  It is fair to say they feel burned.

106
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:12,295
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I would, I could feel that from 3000 miles away. But also,

107
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:15,975
Speaker 6:  Allison, I was thinking about you all day today because y

108
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:19,495
Speaker 6:  you and I have been arguing about AI devices for like two years

109
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:23,495
Speaker 6:  and you keep being like, I don't care about any of the rest of it because

110
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:27,375
Speaker 6:  phones exist and phones are good at doing phones things and phones

111
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:31,255
Speaker 6:  exist and it's fine if you wanna do AI stuff, do it on your phone. And there

112
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:35,215
Speaker 6:  was so much of that energy today to that point, like you're talking about

113
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:38,215
Speaker 6:  Apple was like, we, we didn't, everybody else is out here being like, we've

114
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:41,895
Speaker 6:  invented a, a new paradigm for everything. Johnny, Ivan, Sam Altman, like

115
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:45,535
Speaker 6:  own San Francisco together now. And Apple's just like, do you know as cool

116
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:48,615
Speaker 6:  as your iPhone, what if your iPhone could do more stuff? Did have you heard

117
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:52,175
Speaker 6:  of the iPhone? And there's like, it's like guys, you, where was this

118
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:56,135
Speaker 6:  energy last year? Like you, the iPhone also existed then, but it's like

119
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:59,815
Speaker 6:  this was, it was sort of a very aply way of thinking about this stuff

120
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:02,055
Speaker 6:  again. Yeah. After such a weird diversion last year,

121
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:05,895
Speaker 8:  I think like the, not to jump the gun, but like the,

122
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:10,735
Speaker 8:  the screenshot kind of visual intelligence things is like really

123
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:14,255
Speaker 8:  telling to me. So there, their new thing with visual

124
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:18,095
Speaker 8:  intelligence is it can see what's on your screen and you just summon it

125
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:21,575
Speaker 8:  by taking a screenshot. You, you already know how to take a screenshot with

126
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:24,935
Speaker 8:  your phone, like it's a thing you do and then they kind of

127
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:28,655
Speaker 8:  go from there and that's where you can add something to your calendar or

128
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:32,695
Speaker 8:  whatever. That just feels like that's where these things

129
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:36,215
Speaker 8:  should kind of live and belong. And I think that's how

130
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:41,255
Speaker 8:  ai, you know, as a tool on our phones makes sense to me.

131
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:45,455
Speaker 8:  I do think it's gonna beat, you know, whatever

132
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:50,095
Speaker 8:  pendant screenless thing is coming next, but

133
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:50,775
Speaker 8:  who knows?

134
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:55,055
Speaker 7:  Well a lot of the features they announce today are features that got approximately

135
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,405
Speaker 7:  zero people to switch to an Android phone over the past five years. Sure.

136
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:02,325
Speaker 7:  Like just straightforwardly. These are features that exist on Android phones

137
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:06,405
Speaker 7:  circle, the search exists on Android phone. Like we've covered that.

138
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:09,405
Speaker 7:  Android can now look at what's on your screen and do a Google search based

139
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:13,325
Speaker 7:  on it. Like so often that my joke is that Dieter wrote about

140
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:14,245
Speaker 7:  it in hieroglyphics.

141
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:18,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Was Google now like 2012? Yeah. Yeah. It was like this, this

142
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,405
Speaker 6:  idea is is has been around we we've been doing this.

143
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,995
Speaker 7:  So yeah, I mean I, a lot just a lot of these features are

144
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:31,035
Speaker 7:  old Google ideas, but new ways to kick off searches and,

145
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,875
Speaker 7:  and like see what's on your screen and, and take action on it and which are

146
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,545
Speaker 7:  cool and which are useful. But you know,

147
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:42,705
Speaker 7:  when they announce Apple Intelligence that I think what

148
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:46,625
Speaker 7:  the reason people were focused on, the Siri part of it is 'cause that's what

149
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:50,785
Speaker 7:  looks like the platform shift, however you wanna define that, where

150
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:54,585
Speaker 7:  instead of like touching a screen or using a mouse, you just talk to the

151
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:58,505
Speaker 7:  computer and it does stuff and they're still nowhere in that. Yeah.

152
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:01,625
Speaker 7:  They're a little bit closer to you type to the computer and it does stuff.

153
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:04,705
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Okay. So I wanna get to all the sort of individual platform stuff,

154
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:08,225
Speaker 6:  but I feel like there were a couple of kind of bigger, broader

155
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:11,705
Speaker 6:  ideas Apple had here that we should start with. And the first one is obviously

156
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:15,585
Speaker 6:  Liquid Glass, which every time I say it is a phrase

157
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:18,825
Speaker 6:  I hate a little more. I'm realizing this now as I say it out loud. I just

158
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,465
Speaker 6:  don't enjoy saying that phrase. I

159
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:21,465
Speaker 8:  Don't like it. Alison,

160
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:23,865
Speaker 6:  Can you, you were, you were sitting there taking pictures of this thing.

161
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:27,705
Speaker 6:  Can you explain what Liquid Glass is and looks like having

162
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:28,625
Speaker 6:  seen it in person?

163
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:32,505
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well imagine everything on your phone screen

164
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:37,945
Speaker 8:  is like kind of transparent. I think the idea is like,

165
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:42,225
Speaker 8:  you know, you pull down a notification shade or the control center

166
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:46,025
Speaker 8:  and instead of like a blank slate that sort of

167
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,465
Speaker 8:  launches you in into somewhere else on your phone, it's

168
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:53,385
Speaker 8:  Transparent Glass now and you can still see what was behind

169
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:57,105
Speaker 8:  there. So we saw all kinds of little like menu

170
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:01,185
Speaker 8:  bar things popping up and, and you can still see the apps and the home

171
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:02,425
Speaker 8:  screen behind them.

172
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:09,105
Speaker 8:  A mixed feelings about how that all looks.

173
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:13,025
Speaker 8:  You know, it's, it's all in like early beta right now,

174
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:18,305
Speaker 8:  but it's clearly something Apple is like pushing

175
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:22,305
Speaker 8:  into full force and, and it's coming to the iPhone

176
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,025
Speaker 8:  whether anybody wants it or not.

177
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:28,545
Speaker 6:  Whether you like it or not, it's going Neil, I you

178
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:32,865
Speaker 6:  they the, like, if I remember the timing correctly, the iOS seven

179
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:37,105
Speaker 6:  launch was like a seminal Verge moment

180
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:38,105
Speaker 6:  in the early days.

181
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:43,585
Speaker 6:  Did, did Liquid Glass feel like that all over again? Where

182
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,945
Speaker 6:  you like, we're, we're so back, we're doing this again. Everything's better.

183
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:47,265
Speaker 6:  No,

184
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:51,225
Speaker 7:  I think, I think the answer is no. Iowa seven, remember they went from skew

185
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:55,205
Speaker 7:  amorphism and texture to nothing

186
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:58,605
Speaker 7:  to like what if your, what if your phone was

187
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,085
Speaker 7:  indecipherable?

188
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:05,605
Speaker 7:  Like if you look at our coverage of iOS seven when we came out it, it's harsh,

189
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:10,165
Speaker 7:  but time has judged it to be fair. 'cause I walked it all back

190
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:13,805
Speaker 7:  over the course of the next year and then, you know, to where we are now,

191
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:18,245
Speaker 7:  there's a lot more texture and dimension to iOS.

192
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:21,885
Speaker 7:  Like they've just added it back. They've let people figure out what they're

193
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:25,605
Speaker 7:  looking at on their screens And I get what they're trying to do with Liquid

194
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:28,805
Speaker 7:  Glass, which is reset it once again, not for no reason.

195
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:32,365
Speaker 7:  Right. A lot of their arguments, a lot of their arguments for even the iPad

196
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:35,855
Speaker 7:  stuff is we have so much more processing power now. So

197
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:39,375
Speaker 7:  I get where they're coming from. We have a lot more processing power. We

198
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,775
Speaker 7:  can rethink this interface. We don't have to like throw everything out. We're

199
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:46,295
Speaker 7:  not going from felt textures and, and literally like wooden,

200
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:50,695
Speaker 7:  like that wooden texture you get in like 1970s rec rooms, which was part

201
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:51,775
Speaker 7:  of iOS for a minute. The

202
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:54,655
Speaker 6:  Notes app was a literal torn off legal pad. Like that's, that's what we were

203
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,655
Speaker 6:  doing before iOS seven.

204
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:58,775
Speaker 7:  And there were, you know, there were some arguments there for why that was

205
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:01,815
Speaker 7:  good at that time, but iOS seven was supposed to be a clean break. Like digital

206
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:05,295
Speaker 7:  interfaces are here now. This is the primary way we, we should not be stuck

207
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:08,455
Speaker 7:  in the past Leg. Liquid Glass has nothing to do with not being stuck in the

208
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,215
Speaker 7:  past in many ways. It's very much a reflection of the past in like

209
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:16,095
Speaker 7:  Windows Vista. Yeah. Like this thing has been tried before

210
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:20,055
Speaker 7:  in this way. I, I suspect there's

211
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:23,895
Speaker 7:  a ton of refinement to come between now and September and Apple

212
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,575
Speaker 7:  sort of purposefully, fully

213
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:31,015
Speaker 7:  announces the most extreme version of the idea. And what they announce

214
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:34,175
Speaker 7:  say was the most extreme version of the idea. Like everything is so transparent,

215
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:37,775
Speaker 7:  it's almost unreadable. Yeah. And all the effects are totally overdone and

216
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:41,855
Speaker 7:  Control Center looks at bananas. Like there's no way they're launching this

217
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:45,735
Speaker 7:  version of, of Liquid Glass. The thing I don't

218
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:47,215
Speaker 7:  understand is like, what is the point of it?

219
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:48,975
Speaker 6:  Right? What is this for

220
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:52,415
Speaker 7:  Other than looks different. They did not make a case for why it looks different.

221
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:56,095
Speaker 6:  No. And there are, I so it was funny, I went back and was reading a bunch

222
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,015
Speaker 6:  of our old Vista coverage and the, the thesis

223
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:04,255
Speaker 6:  then was the same as the thesis now for Apple, which is basically like

224
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:08,895
Speaker 6:  you do this kind of translucency stuff in part to sort of anchor people

225
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:13,015
Speaker 6:  where they are in a space, right? Like when you can see the things

226
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,975
Speaker 6:  behind and you get these sort of live updating previews and like, it, it

227
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:19,895
Speaker 6:  just puts you in a place that is a little more understandable. You can kind

228
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:23,855
Speaker 6:  of figure out where you are. And like a lot of this, they said this,

229
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:27,815
Speaker 6:  this is all coming from the Vision Pro, right? Which is a, a

230
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:30,735
Speaker 6:  device with a very specific need, which is to

231
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:31,895
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But why?

232
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:35,335
Speaker 6:  Well, yeah, I, I mean I wrote this in a piece today, like I think it is truly

233
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:38,935
Speaker 6:  wild to be like, we made a vision pro, no one bought it. It's way too expensive.

234
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,335
Speaker 6:  Let's reorient our entire design system around it, which is

235
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:46,575
Speaker 6:  insanity. But like if you are Apple and you're

236
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:50,175
Speaker 6:  betting that the next decade is smart glasses or whatever, then sure

237
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:53,845
Speaker 6:  it does not make sense to me to do this on an iPhone. But again, on a vision

238
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:57,805
Speaker 6:  pro, the idea of like, okay, I need to, I need

239
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:01,245
Speaker 6:  to both show you digital information in the real world but not

240
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:04,565
Speaker 6:  obscure the real world for the digital information. So I have to do this

241
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:07,845
Speaker 6:  kind of glassy translucent thing that feels a little more physical, right?

242
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:10,685
Speaker 6:  Like we've talked about this bunch, everybody's doing this in some direction

243
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:14,645
Speaker 6:  or another. Spaceshipy glass is what Apple has chosen.

244
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:18,765
Speaker 6:  Fine. The way all of this stuff is implemented is just

245
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:22,125
Speaker 6:  bonkers. Like you, you mentioned the, the control center and stuff and there

246
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,765
Speaker 6:  have been all these screenshots going around of the dev beta, which everyone

247
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:27,925
Speaker 6:  immediately installed and started playing with. It's just,

248
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:32,485
Speaker 6:  imagine if you just took the icons from the control center and

249
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:36,125
Speaker 6:  just shoved them onto your home screen. Like that's all it is. There's nothing,

250
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:39,525
Speaker 6:  there's no design. There used to be like the blur behind it. It would blur

251
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:42,925
Speaker 6:  your home screen, none of that. It's just like, here's some icons. It looks

252
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:47,005
Speaker 6:  awful. It's so bad. And I'm sure you're right And I'm

253
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:50,445
Speaker 6:  sure they will frost the glass and everything will be fine. But even some

254
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:53,965
Speaker 6:  of these ideas where they're like you, you pull, you know, as you're scrolling

255
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:58,045
Speaker 6:  the, the URL bar down at the bottom will sort of it, the scroll will

256
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,965
Speaker 6:  go underneath it so it'll actually like reflect the light underneath it.

257
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:04,805
Speaker 6:  All it does in all of the videos that Apple showed is make that

258
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:06,365
Speaker 6:  bar completely unreadable.

259
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:10,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So the argument for skew amorphism is that by making things

260
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:13,805
Speaker 7:  reflect real world objects and textures, you would you

261
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:17,655
Speaker 7:  assign those things, those same qualities. So you open the notes app, it

262
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:20,335
Speaker 7:  looks like a legal pad, you assigned it the same qualities. Sure. As a legal

263
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,975
Speaker 7:  pad in your mind. You open the games app and it's on a felt background and

264
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:27,855
Speaker 7:  you think I should smoke a cigar. Like whatever, whatever those things mean

265
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:31,575
Speaker 7:  to you. The weird thing about this approach

266
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:36,175
Speaker 7:  is that it breaks all those conventions and it literally

267
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:40,155
Speaker 7:  posits a world in which everything is made of class to the point

268
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:43,355
Speaker 7:  where in the video they were showing the designers in the studio.

269
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:47,755
Speaker 7:  And if you believe Apple's video, apple's

270
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,835
Speaker 7:  designers in their studios printed out like giant Lucite blocks and put

271
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:54,355
Speaker 7:  the icons in them to see how they would reflect in the real world.

272
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:57,355
Speaker 6:  That is, I didn't even track that as weird watching that video. Oh my gosh.

273
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:57,435
Speaker 6:  And

274
00:16:57,435 --> 00:17:00,995
Speaker 7:  It's like, well this is very backwards. Like you reverse skew

275
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:04,675
Speaker 7:  amorphism to the world. Yeah. Like you're, you're manufacturing

276
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:08,795
Speaker 7:  Lucite blocks of icons. Like, don't do that because in the real world,

277
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,795
Speaker 7:  not everything is translucent and you get depth and texture by

278
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:16,675
Speaker 7:  putting things over each other all the time. And you're like, this is on

279
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:20,515
Speaker 7:  top of that. And it will, will remain the same color no matter

280
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,595
Speaker 7:  what happens. And on the new iPhone, it's like everything is changing in

281
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:27,405
Speaker 7:  color all the time because everything is over everything else. Right? But

282
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:30,565
Speaker 7:  still transparent or translucent. And there's just something wrong about

283
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:34,525
Speaker 7:  that. Like your brain doesn't accept that. The example I'll give you, which

284
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:38,125
Speaker 7:  is a like ancient history, but it, I think very like funny,

285
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,925
Speaker 7:  inappropriate ancient history. When Steve Jobs first announce Mac OS

286
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:45,865
Speaker 7:  10, the interface back then was called Aqua. And his

287
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,745
Speaker 7:  joke was that it looked so good, it was lickable and all the buttons were

288
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:51,415
Speaker 7:  like pulsing blue and like kind of watery.

289
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:56,455
Speaker 7:  And all of these people on the internet made themes for the old

290
00:17:56,455 --> 00:18:00,385
Speaker 7:  version of Mac os to look like os 10. So you could like buy these

291
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:03,985
Speaker 7:  like theme packs for your like nineties Mac. And I ran them and

292
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:07,105
Speaker 7:  every single one of them had a blue menu bar

293
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:11,905
Speaker 7:  Because they hadn't realized that what, when he was showing it, the

294
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:14,185
Speaker 7:  menu bar is transparent and he just had a blue background.

295
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:16,345
Speaker 6:  Interesting. Oh

296
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:20,505
Speaker 7:  God. So for my God, a year we were all running these themes with this blue

297
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:24,255
Speaker 7:  menu bar. And then we actually got OS 10, like the first probably beta is

298
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:27,295
Speaker 7:  S 10. We installed the things and we went, oh shit, the menu bar translucent.

299
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:31,935
Speaker 7:  And then Apple realize this was a bad idea and now the menu bar is translucent

300
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:34,935
Speaker 7:  again. And you just go back and forth between these like themes and design.

301
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:39,375
Speaker 7:  And one of the reasons you make things not translucent is to give them

302
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,855
Speaker 7:  weight in the design, right? Is to say this is always gonna stay the same

303
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:47,095
Speaker 7:  and this is an anchor for your eyes. And you can just see with

304
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:51,655
Speaker 7:  Liquid Glass, like that's just out the window and they're gonna have to put

305
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:55,455
Speaker 7:  it back. They're gonna have to give you some places to anchor your eyes just

306
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:56,295
Speaker 7:  to get around the phone.

307
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,575
Speaker 6:  Well that's the thing, right? 'cause there, there, I think like you were

308
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:03,855
Speaker 6:  talking about with iOS seven, the idea was like digital

309
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:07,935
Speaker 6:  interfaces are now interfaces. I, I wonder

310
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:11,855
Speaker 6:  if part of the theory here is like you already know how to do everything.

311
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:15,775
Speaker 6:  Your mu your muscle memory is so good that we don't even have to

312
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:19,215
Speaker 6:  remind you where the URL bar goes because your, your thumb is there. So actually

313
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:23,255
Speaker 6:  we're gonna hide all of the interfaces best we can in order

314
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:27,095
Speaker 6:  for you to just see the beauty of the webpage that you're looking

315
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:28,175
Speaker 6:  at. And

316
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:33,665
Speaker 6:  boy is that a bad theory if that is in fact the theory. But that is a

317
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:36,465
Speaker 6:  theory that would lead you to make something like Liquid Glass.

318
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:40,465
Speaker 8:  I think just being at Apple Park today too

319
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:44,745
Speaker 8:  kind of reminds you that Apple is just so committed

320
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:48,465
Speaker 8:  to a look sometimes where it's like, is

321
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:49,305
Speaker 8:  a giant

322
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:54,665
Speaker 8:  circle made of glass? Is that the most practical

323
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:58,265
Speaker 8:  way to organize an office building? No.

324
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:04,705
Speaker 8:  You can, you can see into all parts of it from the outside. That's

325
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:08,265
Speaker 8:  kind of weird. But they're just like, that's their look and they love it.

326
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:12,465
Speaker 6:  You didn't enjoy your 15 minute golf cart ride from the front door to the,

327
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,465
Speaker 6:  the place you were going.

328
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,785
Speaker 7:  The golf cart today had party speakers

329
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:17,865
Speaker 6:  Under

330
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:21,185
Speaker 7:  The seats and the woofers had LEDs and rims and we all like, the first thing

331
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:24,665
Speaker 7:  Alex he said was, look party speakers incredible. Here, I'll, I'll actually,

332
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:28,185
Speaker 7:  Alison And I will extend your metaphor 'cause it is a hundred percent on

333
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,745
Speaker 7:  the nose. They built Apple Park and then a little bit later they had to put

334
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:35,025
Speaker 7:  stickers on all the windows. 'cause people kept walking into them. And this

335
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,145
Speaker 7:  is like a main thing of Apple Park. Now you like see all these little dots

336
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:41,065
Speaker 7:  that they're gonna have to do this with liquid, Liquid Glass. They're gonna

337
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:44,025
Speaker 7:  have to put stickers on the windows. Yeah. So you know where they are in

338
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:44,305
Speaker 7:  space

339
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:48,285
Speaker 8:  Control center's just gonna have some stickers behind it. So so we don't

340
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:48,445
Speaker 8:  run

341
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:49,485
Speaker 6:  Into it. Yeah. People

342
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:52,685
Speaker 7:  Are just be bonking in control center for about a year and they're like,

343
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,925
Speaker 7:  Johnny put the stickers on the thing and it, it's gonna be fine. But like

344
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:59,485
Speaker 7:  that's where we are. And I do think they announce them is

345
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,365
Speaker 7:  in a state that's a little bit more extreme than they understand where they're

346
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:06,045
Speaker 7:  gonna have to go. I, I think Apple wants to be in that position

347
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:10,705
Speaker 7:  where they want people to react to like an extreme version

348
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:14,625
Speaker 7:  of it. So then when they walk it back, it one, they get the

349
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,265
Speaker 7:  big reaction in the beginning, but then it seems like they're taking the

350
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:18,025
Speaker 7:  feedback into account.

351
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:21,185
Speaker 6:  It's like, what do they say the the the thing you say to your kids where

352
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:24,105
Speaker 6:  it's like, oh no, your mom's dead. And they're like, what? And you're like,

353
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:26,545
Speaker 6:  just kidding, but we are getting divorced. And it's like you soften the blow

354
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:26,945
Speaker 6:  that way.

355
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:31,225
Speaker 7:  David, you're talking about I hadn't heard that. I've met your parents.

356
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:32,225
Speaker 7:  They're very happy.

357
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:35,385
Speaker 6:  They're lovely people. Yeah, I have, they're they're, they're doing great.

358
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:37,585
Speaker 6:  That's just, that's a story I've heard, you know, secondhand.

359
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:43,105
Speaker 6:  But no, I, I think it's an interesting theory And I have wondered about

360
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:46,825
Speaker 6:  it a lot whether this was deliberately too much because I,

361
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:50,925
Speaker 6:  I do think with a lot of this stuff, you just can't look

362
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:54,765
Speaker 6:  at control center and be like, yes, that's correct. And so there's some of

363
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:57,765
Speaker 6:  it that is maybe just like, well this is as far as we got, we have to ship

364
00:21:57,765 --> 00:22:01,325
Speaker 6:  the developer beta because ww DC is when it is. But there's also

365
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:05,565
Speaker 6:  something like I, I keep going through the thing trying to find sort of what

366
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:09,405
Speaker 6:  is, what is the thing here. And the only one I've landed on is I think the,

367
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:13,485
Speaker 6:  the way that they've rearchitected the menus where like when you tap

368
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:16,965
Speaker 6:  something to open a menu rather than like opening up a new page, it just

369
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:20,045
Speaker 6:  sort of opens in place, it like radiates out and then you tap it again and

370
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:23,725
Speaker 6:  it goes back in. That I think is very cool. And it is like in service of

371
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:27,165
Speaker 6:  like anchoring you in place and sort of keeping you where you are without

372
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:30,365
Speaker 6:  suddenly dropping you into another menu that looks different only to have

373
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:33,765
Speaker 6:  to go back. That makes a lot of sense to me. That is the only thing about

374
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:37,245
Speaker 6:  Liquid Glass so far that feels like thoughtful and good to me.

375
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:40,485
Speaker 7:  Oh, I have a totally different opinion than you. No, you don't like 'em.

376
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:43,965
Speaker 7:  I saw this in your piece when I was like on my way back to the hotel to record

377
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:45,605
Speaker 7:  this And I was like, I'm gonna disagree with David about this.

378
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:46,165
Speaker 6:  Okay.

379
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,605
Speaker 7:  That's just dynamic user interface. Sure. This is another dream that

380
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,005
Speaker 7:  this industry has been chasing for years. That everything will happen in

381
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,855
Speaker 7:  context, right? Like all the buttons will be there when you need them

382
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:00,615
Speaker 7:  and they'll go away when you, when you don't want them or don't need them.

383
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:05,015
Speaker 7:  And the reality is fundamentally that always

384
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:08,775
Speaker 7:  confuses everyone. So you you have this like idealistic user

385
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:12,135
Speaker 7:  interface designer who's like, I hate, I hate that I've cluttered up the

386
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:16,055
Speaker 7:  screen with all this ui. Microsoft Word has too many menus and buttons

387
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:19,935
Speaker 7:  in the toolbar. We're gonna get rid of all of them and then we will intelligently

388
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:23,975
Speaker 7:  discover what you need exactly when you need it and then you'll push the

389
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:26,775
Speaker 7:  button, it'll be right there and you'll think I'm a genius.

390
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:30,895
Speaker 7:  Whoever the user me, Steve, user interface designer is a genius.

391
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:35,575
Speaker 7:  And then the reality is, you, you'd try to do this and

392
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:39,295
Speaker 7:  you've, you always guess wrong. And then there's no anchors.

393
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:43,415
Speaker 7:  So people don't know where to find the thing unless the

394
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:46,725
Speaker 7:  object that usually triggers the context is on the screen, which gets people

395
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:50,605
Speaker 7:  all turned around not having used like a glass. I don't know that this will

396
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:53,765
Speaker 7:  be the problem, but I was watching the demo And I was like, oh, we're doing

397
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,005
Speaker 7:  the thing. Every, every user interface company

398
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:01,445
Speaker 7:  walks down this path where they're like, it'll just happen in content. You'll

399
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:04,205
Speaker 7:  push the button and all the right menus will be there and then the button

400
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:07,895
Speaker 7:  will go away when you don't need it. And you know, on a

401
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:10,935
Speaker 7:  desktop computer, this problem is a long solved, like just have a menu bar

402
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:14,855
Speaker 7:  and we will just get over the toolbar and we won't try this anymore. And

403
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:18,535
Speaker 7:  I think on mobile, because you have the constrained screen size, the temptation

404
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:22,095
Speaker 7:  is too great. Like, can we make everything disappear?

405
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:26,015
Speaker 7:  If you really look at what Apple is saying about Liquid Glass, if what Google

406
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:29,535
Speaker 7:  is saying about expressive material explosion or whatever it's called

407
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:32,565
Speaker 7:  material expressive material three,

408
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:37,365
Speaker 6:  Listen, I was gonna leave you with material explosion, but it is, it is material

409
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:38,885
Speaker 6:  three expressive. Yes. There you

410
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:42,725
Speaker 7:  Go. See I knew all the, I had most of the phenoms. Right. At the very

411
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:42,885
Speaker 7:  least

412
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:44,485
Speaker 8:  The ingredients were there. That's right.

413
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:48,245
Speaker 7:  If you look at all of it, they're, what they're trying to do is get rid of

414
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:51,325
Speaker 7:  the interface. 'cause the screen is so small, right. Compared to everything

415
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:54,045
Speaker 7:  else. So I get rid of these elements, we'll bring them back when you need

416
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:57,525
Speaker 7:  them. And I understand the temptation And I, again, not having used it,

417
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:02,165
Speaker 7:  it, the thing that always confuses everyone in the end is that the tools

418
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:06,125
Speaker 7:  go away unless a certain object is on screen and

419
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,925
Speaker 7:  that thing is not never guaranteed be on the screen.

420
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:11,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no, I agree. I mean, And I think, again, it goes back to this question

421
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:15,155
Speaker 6:  of like, does Apple just think we all know how to do everything? Because

422
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:18,035
Speaker 6:  like, I even think about the, the camera app in a bunch of these and, and

423
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:19,835
Speaker 6:  we were gonna get to this later, but we're gonna talk about this for a minute

424
00:25:19,855 --> 00:25:23,795
Speaker 6:  now. The super sparse new iPhone

425
00:25:23,795 --> 00:25:27,595
Speaker 6:  camera app that is just like a photo button and a video button and then they're

426
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:31,315
Speaker 6:  like, oh, do you want all the other stuff that's somewhere else? I'm like,

427
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:35,755
Speaker 6:  where I, I would like those things. I don't know. Alison, how did, what

428
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:36,715
Speaker 6:  did you think of that thing?

429
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:40,795
Speaker 8:  I welcome it. I think that the camera app is

430
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:44,715
Speaker 8:  confusing as hell lately. So maybe it was time to kind of

431
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:48,555
Speaker 8:  reset and maybe it is a thing of like, we'll take it one step too far and

432
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:50,915
Speaker 8:  then kind of like relent a little bit. But

433
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:53,435
Speaker 6:  Is it less confusing now or is it just fewer buttons?

434
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:57,555
Speaker 8:  I, you know, I think it, it will be

435
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:01,835
Speaker 8:  one of those things you have to try out, like the thing I'm definitely on

436
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:05,555
Speaker 8:  board with is the kind of like toggle between still photo

437
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:09,115
Speaker 8:  capture and video capture. So you're not like

438
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:12,515
Speaker 8:  scrolling around trying to switch to a video mode. I think that makes a ton

439
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:15,955
Speaker 8:  of sense that the thing that I irritates me

440
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:19,875
Speaker 8:  is that sometimes the setting I'm looking for

441
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:24,755
Speaker 8:  is in the settings menu under camera and it's the, you know, the

442
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:28,595
Speaker 8:  like HDR and 4K or whatever option. And sometimes the setting

443
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:32,355
Speaker 8:  I'm looking for is in the camera app in one of those

444
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:36,275
Speaker 8:  weird, like, tap up here on this little arrow kind of deals.

445
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:41,435
Speaker 8:  So I don't know if they address that in this

446
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:46,245
Speaker 8:  redesign camera app, but I think it is due for

447
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:50,285
Speaker 8:  a shakeup. It just turns into a like never ending kind

448
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:54,005
Speaker 8:  of like sideways scrolling list of modes

449
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:57,005
Speaker 8:  if you just let it, you know, go af year after year.

450
00:26:57,475 --> 00:27:00,845
Speaker 7:  Apple's in a really unique place with the camera app, like industry-wide.

451
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:05,365
Speaker 7:  Because one of the ways the Android side of the house

452
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:09,725
Speaker 7:  tries to lower the switching costs from iPhone to Android is by just

453
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:13,205
Speaker 7:  ruthlessly copying the camera. Yeah. Because if you pick up a new phone and

454
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:17,045
Speaker 7:  you can't use the camera, you're done. And they know it. Sam Byford actually

455
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:20,165
Speaker 7:  wrote a great piece for us ages ago about the,

456
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:24,445
Speaker 7:  the co the ruthless copying of the camera app on Chi, on Chinese Android

457
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:28,405
Speaker 7:  phones in particular. Hmm. And the, the reason is we, we've

458
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:30,845
Speaker 7:  seen this, I think with celebrities taking selfie, I can't remember who it

459
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:34,365
Speaker 7:  was, but there's like some video of a celebrity trying to take a selfie with

460
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:36,205
Speaker 7:  a fan. She can't figure out the Android camera. Oh

461
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:37,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I remember this. Oh yeah,

462
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:38,125
Speaker 8:  Who

463
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:42,125
Speaker 7:  Is that? And they, all the Android manufacturers know what's going on. They

464
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:45,165
Speaker 7:  know that if you pick up a new phone and the camera app is too different

465
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,965
Speaker 7:  and you can't just figure it out, like you're done, you're, you're not even

466
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:51,205
Speaker 7:  like thinking about buying that phone for one more second. So they've all

467
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:54,845
Speaker 7:  ruthlessly copied the camera app. Apple doesn't have this problem, they can

468
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:58,605
Speaker 7:  ruin the camera app and you not gonna leave the iPhone. Right. Like they've

469
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:01,445
Speaker 7:  gotta ruin 10 more things on top of it for you to consider switching it.

470
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:05,685
Speaker 7:  So I think this is them taking advantage of their sort of market position

471
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:10,285
Speaker 7:  and saying, oh, okay, we can, we can clean up this app in some ways that

472
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:14,185
Speaker 7:  make sense. And really, I think most people think about it as video and

473
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:18,065
Speaker 7:  photo and then they have added the formats back to the top, which I

474
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:21,825
Speaker 7:  think is tremendously useful. Yeah. But again, you've got more,

475
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:25,585
Speaker 7:  you know, when they announce it, they're like, and to go to these other modes,

476
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:28,985
Speaker 7:  it's just like one tap away and it's like, oh, so one more tap. Are you suggesting

477
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:32,745
Speaker 7:  it's one more tap? Right. We'll see, I I hope they kind of offer a

478
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:36,425
Speaker 7:  simple mode and a pro mode, but that's a dream. Who

479
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,265
Speaker 6:  Knows if that, yeah. I mean I, I wonder with all of this stuff, like

480
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:43,025
Speaker 6:  how much the design sort of

481
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:47,295
Speaker 6:  accrues back to like, attach rates. Like should I just assume that the fact

482
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:50,375
Speaker 6:  that there's photo and video and nothing else means that almost nobody touches

483
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:54,535
Speaker 6:  anything other than photo and video. And I think intuitively that's probably

484
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:57,975
Speaker 6:  true. And So there is something too, like let's just put the two buttons

485
00:28:57,975 --> 00:29:00,735
Speaker 6:  everybody touches in front of them and people who wanna find other buttons

486
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:02,375
Speaker 6:  will find ways to find other buttons.

487
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:06,335
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Like you, maybe that's can, you can make your picture a

488
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:09,455
Speaker 8:  portrait mode photo after the fact. So you don't need to go looking for that.

489
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:13,495
Speaker 8:  They'll just, you know, you can decide about that, what your photo is

490
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,655
Speaker 8:  after you take it. It's, it's the dream.

491
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:19,215
Speaker 6:  I like default to shooting in portrait because I forget that all the time.

492
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:23,095
Speaker 6:  And that, that's a, that's a useful tip that I should remember. What did

493
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:26,415
Speaker 6:  you guys hear from folks about Liquid Glass? I would say the, the Internet's

494
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:27,295
Speaker 6:  reaction was

495
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:32,855
Speaker 6:  kind of all over the place. Some people who were like, this is the most beautiful

496
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:36,695
Speaker 6:  thing Apple has ever done, look at this water droplet and other people who

497
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:40,295
Speaker 6:  were like liquid ass was a, was a phrase a lot of people were using that

498
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:43,845
Speaker 6:  I very much enjoyed. What was it like in the room? Like was this a

499
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:47,205
Speaker 6:  standup and cheer Liquid Glass moment? Like what, what did it feel like

500
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:51,715
Speaker 8:  To me it kind of felt like, well this is what we're doing. You know,

501
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:56,515
Speaker 8:  there's a little bit, I don't think I got a sense of like, you know,

502
00:29:57,265 --> 00:30:00,995
Speaker 8:  wild appreciation for it or like dislike

503
00:30:01,095 --> 00:30:05,035
Speaker 8:  of it. It just, it feels like a reality

504
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:09,035
Speaker 8:  of like, Apple's gonna show you how you're gonna redesign your

505
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:12,635
Speaker 8:  app and you're gonna find a way to do it.

506
00:30:13,785 --> 00:30:17,595
Speaker 8:  That was just my read on the, on the room today.

507
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:21,155
Speaker 7:  There was just a lot more general sarcasm

508
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:24,995
Speaker 7:  Mm. From the developers I talked to at Dub dub this time.

509
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:27,465
Speaker 7:  There, there's, you know what Apple talk about

510
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:30,465
Speaker 6:  That is not the normal vibe at dub dub. Dub dubs a very like earnest place.

511
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:33,825
Speaker 7:  Although I did. Yeah. I, I was texting back and forth briefly with Walt Mossberg

512
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:38,745
Speaker 7:  mostly he was like, what was that song at the end, which we should talk about.

513
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:42,385
Speaker 7:  But I was like, there's some, you know, they're not a hundred percent app

514
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:45,625
Speaker 7:  here. And he was like, in my long experience covering Apple, the developers

515
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,745
Speaker 7:  are never a hundred percent app. So take it for what it's for fair. That's

516
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:51,665
Speaker 7:  my shout out to it. But like Apple didn't talk about

517
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:56,435
Speaker 7:  app store rates. They didn't talk about coming off of 30 or

518
00:30:56,435 --> 00:31:00,275
Speaker 7:  15%. They didn't talk about web links. There's a

519
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,235
Speaker 7:  whole universe of stuff that developers are unhappy about that they did not

520
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:06,995
Speaker 7:  hear about. Apple talked about running models locally on the phone.

521
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,755
Speaker 7:  Developers are happy about that because that's faster, right? There's lower

522
00:31:10,755 --> 00:31:13,635
Speaker 7:  latency. If you're doing the AI stuff on the phone, it's free,

523
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:18,395
Speaker 7:  which is cool. They like that. But now everything has

524
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:20,715
Speaker 7:  to look different. They're like, I don't know, we're kind of building everything

525
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:23,635
Speaker 7:  and react on the web and like shipping 'em in wrappers and like get over

526
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:27,395
Speaker 7:  it. And like, there's just some real questions over whether this stuff

527
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:31,155
Speaker 7:  comes for free or whether you have to redesign your entire situation

528
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:35,075
Speaker 7:  from the ground up for a set of iOS customers in a design language

529
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:38,875
Speaker 7:  that they might may not like very much while 80% of the world has

530
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:39,435
Speaker 7:  Android phones.

531
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:40,595
Speaker 6:  Right.

532
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:44,475
Speaker 7:  And that's a, that's a bigger set of question marks than Oh on iOS. Like

533
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:47,715
Speaker 7:  we can just run some of our, the stuff on the local AI models for free, which

534
00:31:47,715 --> 00:31:50,195
Speaker 7:  is just a different set of incentives.

535
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:54,675
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. It seems like the upside if you're a developer

536
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:58,715
Speaker 6:  is in, in a Liquid Glass world, everything runs everywhere. Right.

537
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:01,795
Speaker 6:  Which is very clearly what Apple's trying to do here. Right? Like they, they

538
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:05,515
Speaker 6:  talked about this over and over and over that like this is, this is a broad

539
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:08,115
Speaker 6:  system-wide redesign to bring all this stuff together and all this stuff

540
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,635
Speaker 6:  and like fine, all that makes sense. So you can, you can ship an iPhone app

541
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:14,555
Speaker 6:  and it'll work ont VOS and look more or less Right.

542
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:16,435
Speaker 6:  Is something great.

543
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:19,315
Speaker 7:  How long is Thet v os section of this conversation in your notes? David?

544
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,515
Speaker 7:  Is it more than two seconds?

545
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:25,355
Speaker 6:  Would you like to hear all of the notes that I wrote? Fort v os We can do

546
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:28,835
Speaker 6:  this part right now. You're ready? Yeah. More notifications, new

547
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:32,715
Speaker 6:  screensavers, connect to a speaker. That's, that's all I read, that's all

548
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:33,195
Speaker 6:  I got for you.

549
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,245
Speaker 6:  But, but the, the flip side then is I think, I think as far as I can tell,

550
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:42,765
Speaker 6:  and from the little bit I've talked to folks today, this actually is gonna

551
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:46,805
Speaker 6:  ask a lot of people because it's not just like

552
00:32:47,185 --> 00:32:51,045
Speaker 6:  new, you know, animation styles or, or how you move from place to place.

553
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:54,365
Speaker 6:  It's like you have to move where the buttons are in your app and that's,

554
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:58,245
Speaker 6:  that's like a real meaningful thing and the the, they're gonna look

555
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:00,645
Speaker 6:  different and the way that people navigate them is gonna be different. And

556
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,565
Speaker 6:  you're gonna look at the way that something scrolls under your button and

557
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,485
Speaker 6:  you're not gonna like it and you're gonna have to change where the menus

558
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:09,325
Speaker 6:  go. And I think this is like to users, it's gonna

559
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:13,205
Speaker 6:  feel really sort of like a coat of paint. But for developers to do it

560
00:33:13,645 --> 00:33:17,485
Speaker 6:  properly, I think is gonna actually take kind of a lot of sort of

561
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:20,805
Speaker 6:  architectural work. Unless Apple has done a really good job of

562
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:24,525
Speaker 6:  building this stuff into its development kits in a way that you kind of get

563
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:28,245
Speaker 6:  it for free. And I have not heard a ton of optimism that that is the case.

564
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:30,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And especially 'cause you know, they're gonna change it over the next

565
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:34,245
Speaker 7:  six months. Like if you're designing your app and you're like, well everything

566
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:37,725
Speaker 7:  is clear now, So I need to make this make sense. And then Apple makes everything

567
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:41,565
Speaker 7:  slightly more frosted over the next six months. Like Right. I think we're

568
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:43,325
Speaker 7:  in all in for a long period of wait and see here.

569
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:47,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Did you guys see the, the home screen mockups with the clear

570
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:51,245
Speaker 6:  icons? Not a fan. Hmm. Not a fan. Yeah.

571
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:52,365
Speaker 6:  I don't want that

572
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:56,445
Speaker 7:  The, to actually more directly answer your question. I think the vibe

573
00:33:56,445 --> 00:34:00,405
Speaker 7:  online was much meaner than the vibe there. Okay. In the way that everything

574
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,085
Speaker 7:  online is always meaner. Sure. And you show up in person, everyone, they're

575
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,525
Speaker 7:  like, well it turns out I'm a bit of a coward. Like,

576
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:11,165
Speaker 7:  like that's the nature of every online bully that is forced to

577
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:14,045
Speaker 7:  contend with the real world. Like that's what we do. Oh, it turns out I'm

578
00:34:14,045 --> 00:34:18,005
Speaker 7:  gonna wis right out. I mean, you're an Apple's house. Like, everyone's like

579
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:20,325
Speaker 7:  sort of happy they're playing new age music all over the place.

580
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:22,645
Speaker 7:  It's very odd.

581
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:23,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

582
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:26,605
Speaker 7:  And the people who are there are the people wanna be there. But then you,

583
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:29,885
Speaker 7:  I went online, I was like, oh, people are tearing this to shreds.

584
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:34,625
Speaker 7:  And So I think we're just, we're just in for a period of cooling off

585
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:38,305
Speaker 7:  And I do think they're, they just have to change it. If they don't change

586
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:42,185
Speaker 7:  it, I will come, we can rerun this podcast And I will eat my words. There's

587
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,505
Speaker 7:  no way they're not gonna change it.

588
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:46,705
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no, I I think that's right. And one of the things I've enjoyed is there's

589
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:49,865
Speaker 6:  an accessibility feature in the developer beta that's, I think it's just

590
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:53,105
Speaker 6:  called high contrast mode. And it just undoes all of it and looks a thousand

591
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:53,985
Speaker 6:  times better. Yeah.

592
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:54,305
Speaker 7:  It's like,

593
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:57,705
Speaker 6:  It just frosts the glass and it's like, guys just, just frost the glass.

594
00:34:58,095 --> 00:35:01,225
Speaker 6:  It's like, it's fine. What if there was a little bit of color but it didn't

595
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:04,345
Speaker 6:  put the words behind the words so that I couldn't read any of the words anymore.

596
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:05,865
Speaker 6:  Like wouldn't that be great? What we

597
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:09,745
Speaker 8:  Need is a slider. How much, how much frost in the glass.

598
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,985
Speaker 6:  I like that idea. Or like a, like a clicker you can use to un rost and un

599
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:14,905
Speaker 6:  rost the glass at

600
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:18,385
Speaker 7:  Will. Yeah. Oh, that'd be great. Like a, like a privacy screen. Yeah, exactly.

601
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:19,785
Speaker 7:  Like those windows they have. Yeah.

602
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:23,905
Speaker 6:  This is what I'm saying. This is a good idea. So, okay. Before we, before

603
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:27,745
Speaker 6:  we get into the specific platform stuff, Nila, you made a face at me earlier

604
00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:30,985
Speaker 6:  when I said they didn't even talk all that much about Apple intelligence.

605
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:36,945
Speaker 6:  How, what's, what's your sort of overall read on like how much today

606
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:40,955
Speaker 7:  Was an AI day? Like did it feel like an AI day to you maybe in

607
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:44,795
Speaker 7:  the way that it should have the first time? Okay. Right. So everything

608
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:48,435
Speaker 7:  they announce had some little component of machine learning smarts built

609
00:35:48,465 --> 00:35:52,395
Speaker 7:  into it. Right? So so much of what they announce across the board and their

610
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:56,035
Speaker 7:  operating systems are like the phone app is a lot

611
00:35:56,035 --> 00:35:59,755
Speaker 7:  smarter now. It it, you know, like, and these are, again, these are

612
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:03,395
Speaker 7:  android features, but like it'll wait on hold for you and then when the person

613
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:06,355
Speaker 7:  on the other end picks up, it'll say like, I'm coming. And then like, ring

614
00:36:06,355 --> 00:36:10,275
Speaker 7:  you. You just need some AI ish features to pull that

615
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,755
Speaker 7:  off, right. To detect the whole music and wait and like do the thing.

616
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:17,835
Speaker 7:  There's just so much of that throughout the operating system now you're

617
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:21,155
Speaker 7:  like, oh this is, this is, these are table stakes AI features for a phone

618
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:25,115
Speaker 7:  operating system at this point, what they didn't announce was

619
00:36:25,115 --> 00:36:28,355
Speaker 7:  Apple Intelligence, the part where you just talk to Siri and it like does

620
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:32,075
Speaker 7:  stuff for you. Right. Which I'm just gonna keep hammering this point home.

621
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:35,975
Speaker 7:  That's what people want AI to be. They're talking to chat

622
00:36:36,095 --> 00:36:40,055
Speaker 7:  JPT all day long and thinking it's alive. Yeah. So you're like, we

623
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:43,535
Speaker 7:  did AI too. And it's like, what is it? And it's like, well you can

624
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,855
Speaker 7:  screenshot a webpage and then buy a lamp and it's like, well I'm like,

625
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:50,975
Speaker 7:  that's not what we were thinking about. Right, right. Jen Moji is

626
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:54,895
Speaker 7:  not digital. God what was the one today with the two?

627
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:58,855
Speaker 7:  They're like, we combined a, a sloth with a light bulb sloth with a

628
00:36:58,855 --> 00:37:02,815
Speaker 7:  light bulbs to indicate that I was slow to get the joke. Yeah. And it's like

629
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:07,055
Speaker 7:  guys, like first of all, this is a great PhD thesis in modern communication.

630
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:11,215
Speaker 7:  Like this is a trillion dollar company. It's one, it it,

631
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:14,575
Speaker 7:  depending on the stock price, it is the richest company in the history of

632
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:18,535
Speaker 7:  the world, like on any given day. And you're like, we did a sloth and

633
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:21,575
Speaker 7:  a light bulb to indicate that I was allowed for him to get a joke. What is

634
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:25,375
Speaker 7:  going on? Like stop it. Like, no, don't do this.

635
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:29,295
Speaker 7:  What people want is to talk to the computer in a natural language

636
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:33,015
Speaker 7:  interface and have it talk back to them and do stuff for them. That that's

637
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:36,135
Speaker 7:  the only thing that can ever deliver on the promise of something called Apple

638
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:40,035
Speaker 7:  intelligence. Like it just is. And so all this other stuff, it is

639
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,915
Speaker 7:  ai. So there you look down the list of features, right? There are AI features

640
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:46,035
Speaker 7:  through and through, there are machine learning features through and through.

641
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:50,115
Speaker 7:  So I, the, the reason I made the face is one, every time you speak I make

642
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:53,995
Speaker 7:  a face's And I often have to hold myself back from revealing it, but I'm

643
00:37:53,995 --> 00:37:56,515
Speaker 7:  quite tired today. So just kinda that's the tracks. But

644
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:02,675
Speaker 7:  they screwed up last year by, by just sort of like mashing

645
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:06,435
Speaker 7:  up like text generators and writing tools with like,

646
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:10,675
Speaker 7:  you know, super Siri and this year they just talked,

647
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:14,195
Speaker 7:  they didn't talk about that at all and they gave you a sloth with a light

648
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:17,795
Speaker 7:  bulb. And I like, AI is here and it's like we have to get ourselves straight.

649
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:21,915
Speaker 7:  There's exactly one big thing that AI's gonna do and no

650
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:25,395
Speaker 7:  company has shipped it yet at scale in a way that works. And we're all just

651
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:28,195
Speaker 7:  gonna keep working on it and that's fine or whatever. You can have whatever

652
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:31,715
Speaker 7:  feelings you want about it In the meantime, all of this other stuff is actually

653
00:38:31,715 --> 00:38:35,645
Speaker 7:  quite useful and it's, it's kinda like unfair to punish it

654
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:39,805
Speaker 7:  with this isn't digital cause right? Like it is

655
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:44,085
Speaker 7:  genuinely useful that it, the phone can detect more scams

656
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:48,125
Speaker 7:  in messages on and in the phone app and like shunt those people off into

657
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:51,885
Speaker 7:  like a waiting, like you can't be too mad at that stuff, especially when

658
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:54,885
Speaker 7:  it's happening locally on the phone. So I think you see more and more of

659
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:56,925
Speaker 7:  that happening on the phone. They're finding more and more places to use

660
00:38:56,925 --> 00:39:00,845
Speaker 7:  the tools. They're just the only real way you can deliver on something

661
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:04,245
Speaker 7:  called Apple Intelligence is by letting you talk to Siri and having it talk

662
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:04,605
Speaker 7:  back to you.

663
00:39:05,295 --> 00:39:07,965
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. I mean I think I, I was thinking about this a lot with all the

664
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:10,925
Speaker 6:  translation stuff which kept showing up across a bunch of these platforms.

665
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:13,885
Speaker 6:  So they're doing like real time on device

666
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:18,085
Speaker 6:  cross app translation stuff. Whether it's like, you know,

667
00:39:18,085 --> 00:39:21,645
Speaker 6:  translation of lyrics in Apple Music I think was a neat one or

668
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:25,525
Speaker 6:  translation on calls. It's like that's pure AI

669
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:29,405
Speaker 6:  for that stuff to work is pure ai. That is the stuff. And it's like,

670
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:33,605
Speaker 6:  I, I think I like the phrase we shouldn't punish it for not being God.

671
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:37,885
Speaker 6:  It's like, it's true that stuff is like, but it is just, it's

672
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:41,605
Speaker 6:  just software. Like before, before chat GPT

673
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:44,925
Speaker 6:  we would've just called this software, right? And it's like machine learning's

674
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:47,605
Speaker 6:  been around for a long time. We've been doing this for a long time. This

675
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:51,125
Speaker 6:  stuff is, is cool and interesting and useful and it is better because

676
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:55,325
Speaker 6:  these large language models exist. That stuff has been like

677
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:59,245
Speaker 6:  a, a leap in a lot of that technology, but it's not

678
00:39:59,425 --> 00:40:02,685
Speaker 6:  God. And So I think you're right that like Apple should have talked about

679
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:06,245
Speaker 6:  a lot of this stuff this way last year And I think

680
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:10,555
Speaker 6:  the, the vibe probably would've been really different. But instead you promised

681
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,395
Speaker 6:  God how do you, like you can't walk back from promising God to people.

682
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:16,515
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You're gonna talk to Siri and it's gonna remember who you had a meeting

683
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:20,275
Speaker 7:  with while you're like cowering in the anti chamber of the coffee shop. Yeah.

684
00:40:20,455 --> 00:40:24,435
Speaker 7:  That's the ad that they had to pull. Right. And remember that's a lot.

685
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:28,475
Speaker 7:  There's a lot of steps between here and there to pull that off. And that

686
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:31,355
Speaker 7:  has nothing to do with whether you can incrementally, incrementally improve

687
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:35,155
Speaker 7:  the experience you're using the phone today. But that's what everybody

688
00:40:35,155 --> 00:40:38,435
Speaker 7:  wants. Like, and when I say that's what everybody wants, what I mean is chat

689
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:42,365
Speaker 7:  is one of the most popular consumer apps ever. Like maybe the most popular

690
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:45,525
Speaker 7:  consumer app ever. People just wanna talk to their phone in that way. And

691
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:48,565
Speaker 7:  Apple's argument is, well they great, they're doing it on the iPhone today,

692
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:52,725
Speaker 7:  they're downloading the chat GPT app and when you subscribe to it, we take

693
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:56,685
Speaker 7:  30% of that and we're good. Like, what more do you want from us? Yeah.

694
00:40:56,685 --> 00:40:59,725
Speaker 7:  And the pressure is everybody understands, well maybe I can get you to buy

695
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:03,605
Speaker 7:  a different device if that actually occurs. Google very much is like, maybe

696
00:41:03,605 --> 00:41:07,485
Speaker 7:  you'll just say stuff to Google and we'll go and do everything for you. And

697
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:11,165
Speaker 7:  that's the app platform of the future. Apple has to make the turn

698
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:13,325
Speaker 7:  and they haven't expressed how they're gonna make the turn.

699
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:17,535
Speaker 8:  Right? Yeah. If they had kind of set up the Siri

700
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:20,895
Speaker 8:  remembers who you talk to at a party stuff as like

701
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:25,815
Speaker 8:  future, you know, this is kind of the north star where

702
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:29,415
Speaker 8:  we're headed. I think that would've been one thing, but they literally presented

703
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:32,895
Speaker 8:  it like it's here, it can, it's gonna do this, you know,

704
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:37,245
Speaker 8:  any minute now. And that's why it just feels weird to kind

705
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,085
Speaker 8:  of go back into like, oh these are machine learning

706
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:44,605
Speaker 8:  updates. Yeah. You know, it was like, okay, you had us going all the way

707
00:41:44,745 --> 00:41:48,365
Speaker 8:  to like, Siri fixes your social life to like

708
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:52,925
Speaker 8:  we're back at square one now. Like if it had all kind of built

709
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:57,285
Speaker 8:  in in a more linear fashion, I think it it would've made sense. But

710
00:41:57,285 --> 00:42:00,405
Speaker 8:  it's it's a little like whip flashy right now. Yeah.

711
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:02,765
Speaker 7:  Well so that's, I mean I, we will probably come to this when I guess to the

712
00:42:02,765 --> 00:42:06,125
Speaker 7:  Mac, but if you look at what they were showing off in Spotlight, it's right

713
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:06,325
Speaker 7:  there,

714
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:11,745
Speaker 7:  right? You can just search across your Mac, you can, you

715
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:14,905
Speaker 7:  can type in shortcuts to get it to send emails for you. Like all this stuff

716
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:18,745
Speaker 7:  you can do where the puzzle pieces are very

717
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,625
Speaker 7:  clearly in place

718
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:24,785
Speaker 7:  but they just haven't been put together in, in the new Spotlight. You can

719
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:27,905
Speaker 7:  sort of put them together yourself. I don dunno if any of that's gonna work

720
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:28,105
Speaker 7:  either.

721
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:32,745
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Let, let's, let's start talking about the platforms. I that's, that's,

722
00:42:32,745 --> 00:42:35,305
Speaker 6:  we should get into all of that. But first let's take a break. We're

723
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:05,765
Speaker 6:  All right, we're back. V song is here. Hy-Vee welcome. Hi you,

724
00:45:05,765 --> 00:45:08,855
Speaker 6:  you made it out of Apple Park. We're very happy you're here

725
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:09,575
Speaker 13:  In one piece.

726
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,135
Speaker 6:  It's not a small task sometimes. Wait,

727
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:16,095
Speaker 7:  Can I tell a story about being at Apple events with with V when you're live

728
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:16,295
Speaker 7:  logging?

729
00:45:16,995 --> 00:45:18,495
Speaker 13:  Oh my god. Okay, sure.

730
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,015
Speaker 7:  Normally everyone's like, you know, busy, they're focused, they're looking

731
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:25,895
Speaker 7:  down. V is like a, like a mystery science

732
00:45:25,895 --> 00:45:29,335
Speaker 7:  theater, 3000 but of size and moans

733
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:31,735
Speaker 7:  just like ah, ah.

734
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:36,575
Speaker 7:  And it like, especially in like the fitness segments

735
00:45:37,785 --> 00:45:40,495
Speaker 7:  where they're like a personalized health coach will like walk you through

736
00:45:40,495 --> 00:45:43,255
Speaker 7:  all of the data we've been scanning from your body and give and these just

737
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:47,055
Speaker 7:  like the whole time. It's very

738
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:48,295
Speaker 7:  entertaining. It's,

739
00:45:48,685 --> 00:45:52,135
Speaker 13:  Well I'm at least it's entertaining. I am not aware that I'm making those

740
00:45:52,135 --> 00:45:52,975
Speaker 13:  noises half the time.

741
00:45:53,195 --> 00:45:55,255
Speaker 7:  So no, that much is also very clear to everyone.

742
00:45:56,765 --> 00:46:00,255
Speaker 7:  Full involuntary, full body reactions to what see

743
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:04,015
Speaker 6:  Is like the real time audience reaction meter like from one to 10 at all

744
00:46:04,015 --> 00:46:04,535
Speaker 6:  times. It is

745
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:07,615
Speaker 7:  Very good. Hi again. Again, if you have the means, I highly recommend it.

746
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:12,255
Speaker 13:  You know, I think someone reached out to me on Blue Sky And I was like,

747
00:46:12,255 --> 00:46:16,095
Speaker 13:  it's been an honor watching you live blog. And I was like, oh my God. What?

748
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:21,815
Speaker 6:  It's terrifying. My experience of what it looks like to watch someone

749
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:25,575
Speaker 6:  live blog is they just sit there until they sunburn typing on their

750
00:46:25,735 --> 00:46:27,375
Speaker 6:  computer in Apple Park and that's

751
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:31,255
Speaker 13:  The live experience. Oh no, I had three bottles of sunscreen And I

752
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:35,015
Speaker 13:  was making several pale white men who did not bring sunscreen, put

753
00:46:35,015 --> 00:46:36,415
Speaker 13:  sunscreen on their face today.

754
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:39,895
Speaker 7:  I can confirm this Lord's work. Both, both Allison and V said it was their

755
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:42,695
Speaker 7:  mission to get people to our sunscreen today. Yeah. And we did it.

756
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:46,145
Speaker 6:  I'm very proud of both of you. Yeah. Alright, let's talk about platforms.

757
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:50,265
Speaker 6:  So we, we've talked about the big picture stuff. V you missed us having

758
00:46:50,305 --> 00:46:51,625
Speaker 6:  a lot of feelings about Liquid Glass.

759
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:56,345
Speaker 6:  I suspect there will be ample time to have more feelings about Liquid Glass,

760
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:59,345
Speaker 6:  which again, I hate more every single time I say it out loud.

761
00:47:00,635 --> 00:47:04,065
Speaker 6:  Let's talk about the Mac first. I have this in rough order of how interested

762
00:47:04,265 --> 00:47:08,065
Speaker 6:  I am in it personally, but Neli for you, I switched

763
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,305
Speaker 6:  one and two because you, you are just dying to talk about Spotlight.

764
00:47:11,925 --> 00:47:15,625
Speaker 6:  So the, the big news Mac OS 26, it's called

765
00:47:15,915 --> 00:47:19,865
Speaker 6:  Tahoe. It has the new design, it has all the Liquid Glass stuff, but the

766
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:23,425
Speaker 6:  big new feature And I would say potentially the like most

767
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:27,745
Speaker 6:  universally exciting thing at all of WWDC

768
00:47:28,165 --> 00:47:32,095
Speaker 6:  was new Spotlight. Do, do you wanna explain what New Spotlight is and

769
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,895
Speaker 6:  why you're excited about it?

770
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:37,135
Speaker 7:  Yeah, although I think it's a tie. I think it's New Spotlight and the iPad

771
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:38,775
Speaker 7:  stuff. Okay. Those are the things that I heard about.

772
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:41,935
Speaker 6:  That was gonna be my number one. We were gonna do that first, but for you

773
00:47:41,935 --> 00:47:42,495
Speaker 6:  we're doing Spotlight.

774
00:47:43,495 --> 00:47:45,815
Speaker 7:  I think we can move through the new Spotlight pretty quickly. So Spotlight

775
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:49,655
Speaker 7:  is when you hold down command space on a Mac, it initially just started as

776
00:47:49,655 --> 00:47:52,815
Speaker 7:  like a search of all your files and then they started adding more features

777
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:56,135
Speaker 7:  to it. And I could start like search the web and now they're just adding

778
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:59,375
Speaker 7:  the capabilities to take actions across your computer to it

779
00:48:00,035 --> 00:48:03,575
Speaker 7:  in weird ways. Like you can launch shortcuts from it,

780
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:07,215
Speaker 7:  which implies that you have a library of shortcuts, which implies that David

781
00:48:07,235 --> 00:48:10,255
Speaker 7:  has to talk about shortcuts, which implies that David is gonna receive hate

782
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:14,015
Speaker 7:  mail from the many dozens of shortcuts fans that exist in this world.

783
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:14,415
Speaker 7:  Just

784
00:48:14,415 --> 00:48:17,055
Speaker 6:  Know that I hear you and that you're wrong and that's okay.

785
00:48:18,715 --> 00:48:21,535
Speaker 7:  And then you know, it it, they've added stuff they should have had from the

786
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:25,375
Speaker 7:  beginning. Like all of the menu items and whatever app you're using

787
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:28,455
Speaker 7:  are now available on Spotlight. So you can just like start typing a menu

788
00:48:28,455 --> 00:48:31,895
Speaker 7:  command and issue a menu command. And then there's, you know, the, because

789
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,295
Speaker 7:  shortcuts are more powerful and have access to some amount of ai,

790
00:48:36,115 --> 00:48:39,975
Speaker 7:  you can start to take more complicated commands that feel more

791
00:48:39,975 --> 00:48:43,415
Speaker 7:  natural language and you're just inching towards, what I keep describing

792
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:47,295
Speaker 7:  is like a magic command line on your computer where you can just open

793
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:50,535
Speaker 7:  it and type it and tell it what to do and then it off it goes off and does

794
00:48:50,535 --> 00:48:53,935
Speaker 7:  something. And that is so close to just saying what you want to Siri

795
00:48:54,715 --> 00:48:58,655
Speaker 7:  to the point where like the, the technology mechanisms behind the

796
00:48:58,655 --> 00:49:02,415
Speaker 7:  new Spotlight are the same is what they talked about with Super Siri last

797
00:49:02,415 --> 00:49:06,175
Speaker 7:  year. It's the app intense framework where Spotlight is just talking

798
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:10,215
Speaker 7:  to apps through this new framework that eventually Siri will use to

799
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:13,535
Speaker 7:  talk to apps. And so they're, they're inching towards a place

800
00:49:14,065 --> 00:49:18,015
Speaker 7:  where you have like a command line that is not just a, like a

801
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:22,495
Speaker 7:  tape, properly formatted commands command line, but

802
00:49:22,495 --> 00:49:25,815
Speaker 7:  just you open it up and you start typing and stuff starts happening and that's

803
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:29,615
Speaker 7:  awesome. Whether any of this will work or any of developers

804
00:49:29,615 --> 00:49:33,415
Speaker 7:  will support app intents or importantly whether anyone is

805
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:36,415
Speaker 7:  using applications on our Mac that aren't just web apps and a web browser.

806
00:49:36,955 --> 00:49:40,895
Speaker 7:  All of this remains seen. David, I'm very curious for your take

807
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:44,775
Speaker 7:  on this 'cause apps like raycast have existed forever. Like there's a

808
00:49:45,135 --> 00:49:48,895
Speaker 7:  universe of apps that take over command space to do stuff in the

809
00:49:48,895 --> 00:49:52,455
Speaker 7:  productivity world. And I can't tell if all of them just got sherlocked or

810
00:49:52,485 --> 00:49:56,335
Speaker 7:  none of them feel competitive at all or what the, what the overlap

811
00:49:56,335 --> 00:49:56,695
Speaker 7:  really is,

812
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:01,095
Speaker 6:  They will tell you things like, we're so

813
00:50:01,095 --> 00:50:04,055
Speaker 6:  glad the space is expanding and we think this really validates our thesis.

814
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:04,335
Speaker 6:  The

815
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,055
Speaker 7:  Last thing you see before you die. That's

816
00:50:06,055 --> 00:50:09,615
Speaker 6:  Right. We're so glad that others are, are, you know, really believing in

817
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:12,615
Speaker 6:  this thing that we've been, they are all going to be petrified because this

818
00:50:12,615 --> 00:50:16,415
Speaker 6:  is, this is the thing that is now

819
00:50:16,415 --> 00:50:19,815
Speaker 6:  good enough that people might not switch to Raycast or Alfred. Right? So

820
00:50:19,815 --> 00:50:23,615
Speaker 6:  like based on what we've seen these other apps, specifically

821
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,575
Speaker 6:  Raycast and Alfred, which are like the two biggest ones in this space and

822
00:50:26,575 --> 00:50:30,485
Speaker 6:  have been around for a long time and are like enormously powerful, right?

823
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,445
Speaker 6:  They have these huge extension libraries that let you essentially like plug

824
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:37,925
Speaker 6:  them into all kinds of other apps and all kinds of other uses and you can

825
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:41,885
Speaker 6:  essentially do anything on your computer through one of these apps

826
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:45,925
Speaker 6:  if you program it correctly enough. And now Raycast in particular is also

827
00:50:45,925 --> 00:50:49,565
Speaker 6:  like deep into AI stuff. So you can interact with AI models

828
00:50:49,635 --> 00:50:53,605
Speaker 6:  just right through Raycast that way. But it's a lot of

829
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:56,445
Speaker 6:  that is predicated on the fact that Spotlight is really, really bad. And

830
00:50:56,445 --> 00:50:59,325
Speaker 6:  is it like Spotlight, Spotlight is pretty bad. It's a useful like

831
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:05,165
Speaker 6:  me search engine for the stuff on your computer that's like as good as it

832
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:08,725
Speaker 6:  has been for a very long time. And now it's gonna be much better than that

833
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:12,385
Speaker 6:  if this stuff works to the point where a, it might teach people

834
00:51:12,775 --> 00:51:15,665
Speaker 6:  that this is a thing you can do. I don't know if y'all have this experience,

835
00:51:15,665 --> 00:51:19,065
Speaker 6:  but like on my phone I use Spotlight all the time to like find an open apps.

836
00:51:19,885 --> 00:51:23,785
Speaker 6:  But most of the other people in my life when they take my phone don't just

837
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:26,425
Speaker 6:  like instinctively pull down and search for Spotify. They go like hunting

838
00:51:26,445 --> 00:51:30,385
Speaker 6:  for the Spotify logo. And I'm just like, this is just not a, this is just

839
00:51:30,385 --> 00:51:34,265
Speaker 6:  not an ingrained use case. Like Spotlight is not a mainstream tool

840
00:51:34,365 --> 00:51:38,185
Speaker 6:  on any of these platforms. And I think, I think this might be the turn

841
00:51:38,185 --> 00:51:41,825
Speaker 6:  that helps it start to get there. And I just think that's super

842
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:45,465
Speaker 6:  interesting. Like forget what people actually use it for. The idea that this

843
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:49,105
Speaker 6:  is now like a text box becomes the way I interact with my computer.

844
00:51:50,135 --> 00:51:54,115
Speaker 6:  It it, it's the first time that's been true in 40 years And I think that's

845
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:56,715
Speaker 6:  really fascinating. Like v are you, are you a Spotlight person?

846
00:51:57,835 --> 00:52:01,155
Speaker 13:  I am And I was a really big Alfred person for a long time

847
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:05,995
Speaker 13:  and then I just stopped one day. I don't really know why I did, but

848
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:09,635
Speaker 13:  I just did. So yeah, to your point, I use Spotlight

849
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:14,745
Speaker 13:  nonstop on my phone and it's because I have too many freaking apps.

850
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:18,985
Speaker 13:  So like I, we were talking about how bad my eyesight is, I

851
00:52:18,985 --> 00:52:22,305
Speaker 13:  don't have time to look at my giant iPhone screen to, to find a tiny little

852
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:26,105
Speaker 13:  app on the whatever page. So I, yeah, I'm a big Spotlight user,

853
00:52:26,285 --> 00:52:29,505
Speaker 13:  So I mean it does suck. Alfred

854
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:33,815
Speaker 13:  is better. I'm sure I haven't used Raycast, but I'm sure that's also

855
00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:37,775
Speaker 13:  better. So yeah, I'm kind of excited to see how

856
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:41,695
Speaker 13:  it works. I'm just super skeptical that it will work the way

857
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,775
Speaker 13:  I want. 'cause I just feel like anytime they say it's gonna make

858
00:52:45,775 --> 00:52:49,295
Speaker 13:  your life better, I'm like, yeah, I can't wait. This isn't what I wanted

859
00:52:49,705 --> 00:52:52,895
Speaker 13:  close, but eh, so I'm, I'm reserving judgment, but this

860
00:52:52,895 --> 00:52:56,735
Speaker 7:  Is the peril of the magic command line, right? Right. To make

861
00:52:56,735 --> 00:53:00,055
Speaker 7:  it work in a way that makes it useful.

862
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:04,375
Speaker 7:  You have to be able to type anything you want into it. This is why like my

863
00:53:04,405 --> 00:53:08,375
Speaker 7:  like windows and mice and graphical user interfaces took over from old

864
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:11,895
Speaker 7:  school command lines. 'cause you like show a blinking cursor to people that

865
00:53:11,895 --> 00:53:15,415
Speaker 7:  could only accept certain commands like that just made computers

866
00:53:15,415 --> 00:53:17,495
Speaker 7:  inaccessible. You're like, here's some pictures you can move 'em around.

867
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:21,415
Speaker 7:  Like, okay, everybody can use this. You wanna bring it back? It has to

868
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:25,055
Speaker 7:  be able to take whatever you put into it, which is where LLMs and all this

869
00:53:25,145 --> 00:53:28,965
Speaker 7:  AI stuff should shine. And like that's the

870
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,565
Speaker 7:  gap. And that's why I keep saying like, they talked about that stuff and

871
00:53:32,565 --> 00:53:36,405
Speaker 7:  they showed you how it would work and then they didn't connect it to Siri.

872
00:53:36,565 --> 00:53:40,285
Speaker 7:  'cause it, they can't make that promise again because that's also how

873
00:53:40,475 --> 00:53:43,125
Speaker 7:  Siri should work where you just say whatever you want, like figures it out.

874
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:46,845
Speaker 6:  I think it's partly that I also think I, I'm realizing more the more we talk

875
00:53:46,845 --> 00:53:50,805
Speaker 6:  that like the, the Siri reputational hole is

876
00:53:50,905 --> 00:53:54,845
Speaker 6:  so deep for all of this stuff for Apple that if, if it, if it

877
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:58,365
Speaker 6:  were to have connected that to Siri and it was like, oh, you know, Spotlight

878
00:53:58,825 --> 00:54:02,365
Speaker 6:  is gonna let you through Siri, everybody would've immediately been like,

879
00:54:02,485 --> 00:54:05,405
Speaker 6:  oh, this will never work. There's no chances This is a look Tomatoes thrown

880
00:54:05,425 --> 00:54:08,925
Speaker 6:  at the screen. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But So I, So I think, I think like I'm,

881
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:12,205
Speaker 6:  I'm starting to realize maybe Apple is going out of its way to not connect

882
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:16,125
Speaker 6:  this stuff back to Siri in order to maybe convince you that

883
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:20,005
Speaker 6:  it can actually still work because the, the brand whole

884
00:54:21,115 --> 00:54:24,845
Speaker 6:  that Siri has just like burned through Apple is pretty nuts.

885
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:28,365
Speaker 6:  And Siri just went off two times while I was saying that. So I'm sorry to

886
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:32,405
Speaker 6:  everyone watching and listening, this is what we do here. But no, I

887
00:54:32,525 --> 00:54:36,085
Speaker 6:  I think, I think you're right that Spotlight could like

888
00:54:36,345 --> 00:54:39,845
Speaker 6:  it could feel that way now and there's nothing sort of technically

889
00:54:39,845 --> 00:54:42,725
Speaker 6:  impossible about a lot of the stuff Apple is trying to do here. Like the

890
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:46,365
Speaker 6:  app intent thing is very smart. If developers get on board, the the

891
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:49,005
Speaker 6:  commands it was doing are mostly pretty easy. Like what was the example he

892
00:54:49,005 --> 00:54:52,845
Speaker 6:  gave? He typed sm to send a message like that's solved

893
00:54:52,845 --> 00:54:54,245
Speaker 6:  technology. This stuff works.

894
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:58,455
Speaker 7:  It's important to, to kind of pull this apart. There's the

895
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:02,815
Speaker 7:  SM to send a message was they had made like a short, like

896
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:05,655
Speaker 7:  a quick key shortcut, which you can do right now. It's like a text expander,

897
00:55:05,795 --> 00:55:09,535
Speaker 7:  but they had mapped it to a shortcut and then the shortcut could do stuff.

898
00:55:10,075 --> 00:55:13,975
Speaker 7:  So this is like their layers of automation in the Mac that they're

899
00:55:14,085 --> 00:55:15,975
Speaker 7:  like, look at what you can do as a Mac power user.

900
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:19,975
Speaker 6:  So that was hitting Spotlight and shortcuts. I was thinking that was just

901
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:22,415
Speaker 6:  a like a system level thing. Okay. That makes me like a,

902
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:25,815
Speaker 7:  Well so the system level thing, this is where, where I think it got particularly

903
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:28,975
Speaker 7:  confusing the demo on their website right now, if you go to

904
00:55:28,975 --> 00:55:32,575
Speaker 7:  apple.com/os/macs, you can scroll down, you can like look at this thing.

905
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:38,015
Speaker 7:  They open Spotlight, it says biggest Spotlight ever and here's the, the graphic

906
00:55:38,015 --> 00:55:41,775
Speaker 7:  that's animating on the screen and he the IT type send

907
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:46,145
Speaker 7:  and that brings up a list of commands. And so one of them is

908
00:55:46,335 --> 00:55:50,305
Speaker 7:  send in messages and you like click that and then you type

909
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:54,025
Speaker 7:  let's meet at the studio and you click two and then it has a list of

910
00:55:54,135 --> 00:55:57,545
Speaker 7:  like your contacts. So you see like it's

911
00:55:57,575 --> 00:56:01,505
Speaker 7:  prompting you to issue a command that looks an awful lot like

912
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:02,105
Speaker 7:  a shortcut.

913
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:07,765
Speaker 7:  This is a lot of like puzzle pieces, right? And so

914
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:11,605
Speaker 7:  what you, what they're getting at is, okay, all

915
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:15,285
Speaker 7:  the apps in your system will tell Spotlight all of the things they can do

916
00:56:15,545 --> 00:56:19,445
Speaker 7:  and you'll start typing some stuff you want done and we'll like auto complete

917
00:56:20,105 --> 00:56:23,645
Speaker 7:  the actions you want taken the data you want taken in like the,

918
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:27,885
Speaker 7:  the recipients of your message, which is another data in another field. And

919
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:30,805
Speaker 7:  then we'll like send that command into messages, which will then send this

920
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:34,765
Speaker 7:  thing off. And that is just like a hop away from making a

921
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:38,125
Speaker 7:  shortcut, which is itself a hop away from having a quick key assigned to

922
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:41,925
Speaker 7:  it. Like, and so you're, oh we're just stacking all of these capabilities

923
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:46,285
Speaker 7:  and we're making the interface Spotlight and eventually you're gonna be able

924
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:50,085
Speaker 7:  to just say out loud, send this to whoever at what time and

925
00:56:50,085 --> 00:56:53,005
Speaker 7:  like we'll just, we'll just parse it all and do it correctly.

926
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:57,315
Speaker 7:  And there's like a little turn in there that's the natural language turn.

927
00:56:57,615 --> 00:57:00,875
Speaker 7:  But in the meantime it's type as you start typing it, like

928
00:57:01,065 --> 00:57:04,915
Speaker 7:  pre-populates all the commands and prompts you for what you wanna put, like

929
00:57:04,915 --> 00:57:08,115
Speaker 7:  what variables you wanna pass through. This is all very smart, it's very

930
00:57:08,115 --> 00:57:10,315
Speaker 7:  clever if they announce this stuff five years ago, it'd be like, this is

931
00:57:10,315 --> 00:57:14,075
Speaker 7:  the future of computers here in 2025. Johnny

932
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:17,955
Speaker 7:  Ive and Sam Altman are like, what we're doing is we're gonna put Jesus in

933
00:57:17,995 --> 00:57:21,075
Speaker 7:  a necklace. And it's like you're just in a whole different Jesus

934
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:21,555
Speaker 6:  In a

935
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:25,875
Speaker 7:  Right. Like you're just in a whole different context and like I think

936
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,755
Speaker 7:  it's very clever. I the idea that all the commands that are available from

937
00:57:29,755 --> 00:57:33,555
Speaker 7:  all the applications of their computer are sort of just available in a command

938
00:57:33,555 --> 00:57:36,635
Speaker 7:  line that is universally accessible is wild shit.

939
00:57:37,185 --> 00:57:37,475
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

940
00:57:38,135 --> 00:57:42,115
Speaker 7:  But all those application developers have to like do it and then people

941
00:57:42,115 --> 00:57:46,035
Speaker 7:  have to use it. And the thing that's staring 'em in the face is

942
00:57:46,035 --> 00:57:49,875
Speaker 7:  literally chat GPT being like, what would say anything? And I'll lie to you

943
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:53,075
Speaker 7:  until you're happy. Yeah. Like that's, that's just a radically different

944
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:53,795
Speaker 7:  context to be. So

945
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:57,195
Speaker 6:  I will say, by the way, what you just described is, is pure Raycast, like

946
00:57:57,215 --> 00:58:00,955
Speaker 6:  you just described Raycast. And, and the thing that Raycast did that was

947
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:04,355
Speaker 6:  so smart is like you can, you can build extensions that plug into other apps

948
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,115
Speaker 6:  and when you do that, it, it sort of declares a bunch of specific

949
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:11,035
Speaker 6:  actions you can do and things that you can look for and you can map those

950
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:14,275
Speaker 6:  things to keyboard shortcuts. And it is, it is both very

951
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:18,635
Speaker 6:  complicated and also kind of very simple at its core, right? Like what

952
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:22,155
Speaker 6:  you, none of what you just described requires groundbreaking

953
00:58:22,355 --> 00:58:26,075
Speaker 6:  advances in artificial intelligence. That's just computer stuff. Yeah.

954
00:58:26,075 --> 00:58:29,075
Speaker 6:  Right. It's just, it's just here. And there's, there's another thing Spotlight

955
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:31,955
Speaker 6:  can do where when you're in an app, you can invoke Spotlight to search the

956
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:35,835
Speaker 6:  menu inside of that app, which like every Photoshop user

957
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:38,395
Speaker 6:  is going to be thrilled about, right? Because suddenly instead of navigating

958
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:41,915
Speaker 6:  through six trees of menus, I can just search for

959
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:44,955
Speaker 6:  the menu item. I want to click and press enter and click it. Right?

960
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:48,875
Speaker 7:  But the problem with that is every Photoshop user also now largely a

961
00:58:48,965 --> 00:58:52,715
Speaker 7:  Figma user and Figma is an app is expressed inside of a web

962
00:58:52,715 --> 00:58:56,685
Speaker 7:  browser, right? That has no idea that any of this shit is happening, right?

963
00:58:56,685 --> 00:59:00,525
Speaker 7:  Right. And the every electron app, which is like

964
00:59:00,605 --> 00:59:03,605
Speaker 7:  a, you know, cheap and dirty way of getting web apps to look native on a,

965
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:07,205
Speaker 7:  on a Mac or pc And I know the electron, there's some very good electron apps

966
00:59:07,225 --> 00:59:10,485
Speaker 7:  out there. There's some very bad electron app apps. So they're not gonna

967
00:59:10,485 --> 00:59:13,665
Speaker 7:  know about this stuff. They're not gonna do this stuff. And so you really

968
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:17,185
Speaker 7:  just Apple's betting on developers, particularly on the Mac

969
00:59:18,105 --> 00:59:21,105
Speaker 7:  participating in an ecosystem that right now they have no incentive to participate

970
00:59:21,165 --> 00:59:21,285
Speaker 7:  in.

971
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:25,165
Speaker 6:  Right? This whole thing makes way more sense to me on an iPhone honestly,

972
00:59:25,345 --> 00:59:29,205
Speaker 6:  as both as like a, a way I want to use it and as

973
00:59:29,605 --> 00:59:33,205
Speaker 6:  a place you can actually do it because they don't, that same problem does

974
00:59:33,205 --> 00:59:35,485
Speaker 6:  not exist in the same way on the iPhone. Yes,

975
00:59:35,485 --> 00:59:39,245
Speaker 7:  Apple has militant control over it, right. Platform look,

976
00:59:39,305 --> 00:59:42,205
Speaker 6:  You feel about it however you want, but the, the facts on the ground are,

977
00:59:42,275 --> 00:59:46,165
Speaker 6:  it's all native apps. And and like to v's point, I have

978
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,885
Speaker 6:  a million apps, I don't know where any of them are. I would actually like

979
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,125
Speaker 6:  to not have to organize them And I would like to not have to go to them and

980
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:56,045
Speaker 6:  open them and look for them. I would like to just pull down and say,

981
00:59:56,155 --> 00:59:59,605
Speaker 6:  play the song and it'll play the damn song. That's, that's how it should

982
00:59:59,605 --> 01:00:01,725
Speaker 6:  work on my phone. I firmly believe that

983
01:00:02,025 --> 01:00:04,405
Speaker 7:  It kind of works that way on your phone today. Are you,

984
01:00:05,865 --> 01:00:07,445
Speaker 7:  you play you can just say play a song.

985
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:09,245
Speaker 6:  Play the song.

986
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:11,725
Speaker 13:  I gotta test this now too.

987
01:00:12,585 --> 01:00:16,405
Speaker 6:  It it wants me to play it. It just started playing play

988
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:19,245
Speaker 6:  that song by train on Spotify. Oh no, it's a touche.

989
01:00:21,145 --> 01:00:21,645
Speaker 6:  Oh I'm

990
01:00:21,645 --> 01:00:21,925
Speaker 8:  Sorry about

991
01:00:21,925 --> 01:00:22,725
Speaker 6:  That wind this round.

992
01:00:23,475 --> 01:00:25,765
Speaker 7:  Just the the, the computers work today.

993
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,005
Speaker 6:  That one might have been a bad

994
01:00:27,005 --> 01:00:27,285
Speaker 7:  Example

995
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,645
Speaker 6:  But if you wanna play any song other than play that song, you're,

996
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:34,045
Speaker 7:  This is why we need to build digital. God can I have

997
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:35,405
Speaker 7:  $1 trillion please?

998
01:00:36,985 --> 01:00:40,765
Speaker 8:  I'm sort of reminded of like the Google search bar and how

999
01:00:40,795 --> 01:00:44,605
Speaker 8:  that kind of changed over the years where it was, you know, you would just

1000
01:00:44,635 --> 01:00:48,565
Speaker 8:  type things to it and search Google. But then we all learned eventually like,

1001
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:52,165
Speaker 8:  oh it'll do a math equation for you or you can just convert currency

1002
01:00:52,665 --> 01:00:56,565
Speaker 8:  and it sort of like the scope of what the search bar

1003
01:00:56,825 --> 01:01:00,765
Speaker 8:  became changed. And I, I don't know, I can see that

1004
01:01:00,765 --> 01:01:04,205
Speaker 8:  happening with Spotlight. Like I had to train myself to use it.

1005
01:01:05,965 --> 01:01:09,365
Speaker 8:  I just had the muscle memory of like looking for my apps and then once you

1006
01:01:09,825 --> 01:01:13,805
Speaker 8:  use it it was like, no, this is, this is better and other

1007
01:01:13,805 --> 01:01:17,605
Speaker 8:  things pop up too. And if it's gonna start prompting me to like do the thing

1008
01:01:17,725 --> 01:01:21,605
Speaker 8:  I was, I was trying to take three steps to do and it'll

1009
01:01:21,605 --> 01:01:25,165
Speaker 8:  do it in one tap. Like yeah I'll, I'll come back to that.

1010
01:01:25,585 --> 01:01:29,525
Speaker 13:  So what I actually use Spotlight for most on my Mac is

1011
01:01:29,525 --> 01:01:32,365
Speaker 13:  doing equations. So the debt

1012
01:01:32,365 --> 01:01:33,165
Speaker 8:  Tracks. Sure, there you go.

1013
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I'll

1014
01:01:34,245 --> 01:01:36,525
Speaker 13:  Buy that. I don, I don't wanna open a calculator app, I don't wanna type

1015
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:40,125
Speaker 13:  it into another thing. No, I'm just gonna write my little equation while

1016
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:43,845
Speaker 13:  calculating various debts in

1017
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:46,085
Speaker 13:  Spotlight. That's my little calculator friend.

1018
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:50,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that works. And that's like, yeah. And again, there's so much stuff

1019
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:54,325
Speaker 6:  you can plug into this if you can get people A, to put

1020
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:58,085
Speaker 6:  their apps into it and B, to use it. And I think like the reason I'm so

1021
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:01,525
Speaker 6:  interested in this is this feels like the biggest bet on Spotlight as an

1022
01:02:01,525 --> 01:02:05,445
Speaker 6:  interface in kind of that I can ever remember from Apple Spotlight has just

1023
01:02:05,445 --> 01:02:09,365
Speaker 6:  like been there for a long time and it's just like what if, what

1024
01:02:09,365 --> 01:02:12,005
Speaker 6:  if there was a plan for this and this feels like a plan, which I think is

1025
01:02:12,005 --> 01:02:15,845
Speaker 6:  very cool. Other Mac stuff before we move on, stop me if any of this is

1026
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:19,925
Speaker 6:  interesting to any of you. Shortcuts automations, which means you can run

1027
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:23,565
Speaker 6:  a, you consider shortcut to run at a time or when an event happens on your

1028
01:02:23,765 --> 01:02:27,645
Speaker 6:  computer. All my shortcuts nerds get excited. Sorry to

1029
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:30,965
Speaker 6:  everyone else because you'll never learn how to build shortcuts. The journal

1030
01:02:31,065 --> 01:02:32,965
Speaker 6:  app coming into the Mac, people excited about that.

1031
01:02:33,235 --> 01:02:36,925
Speaker 7:  Wait, can I say one thing about shortcuts please? There are new shortcuts

1032
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:40,275
Speaker 7:  that are like LM based. Yeah. So

1033
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:45,195
Speaker 7:  really interesting ideas. Like if an image matching this

1034
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:49,155
Speaker 7:  description shows up in this folder, take this action requires the

1035
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:51,715
Speaker 7:  computer to be able to like look at an image and like decide whether it has

1036
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:55,675
Speaker 7:  a tree in it or whatever you've specified. Fascinating. Then you can be

1037
01:02:55,675 --> 01:02:59,115
Speaker 7:  like, take my notes from the notes app and look at the text

1038
01:02:59,495 --> 01:03:03,355
Speaker 7:  and then transcribe it if it matches whatever. And then summarize that. Like

1039
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:07,715
Speaker 7:  just interesting shortcuts that require you to have access to an LM in

1040
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:11,555
Speaker 7:  specific ways are now just like there whether or not they will be

1041
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:15,235
Speaker 7:  useful or function on time. Right. Which is

1042
01:03:15,715 --> 01:03:19,235
Speaker 7:  a major criticism of shortcuts that some people have and some people do not

1043
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:23,355
Speaker 7:  apparently remains to be seen. But that kind of stuff is like

1044
01:03:23,355 --> 01:03:27,195
Speaker 7:  pretty interesting like image-based workflows that require the computer to

1045
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:30,675
Speaker 7:  understand the contents of the image. I'd say a whole universe of, of new

1046
01:03:30,675 --> 01:03:32,755
Speaker 7:  things that people be able to build. Totally.

1047
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:36,555
Speaker 13:  And I think my problem with like the shortcut stuff is that

1048
01:03:37,545 --> 01:03:41,475
Speaker 13:  it's still not smart enough for me because you still

1049
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:45,075
Speaker 13:  have to be the person putting all of the components

1050
01:03:45,395 --> 01:03:49,355
Speaker 13:  together. You have to be the one defining what things are gonna be used

1051
01:03:49,355 --> 01:03:53,075
Speaker 13:  and then of course you can prompt the shortcut, but then you have to be,

1052
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:56,955
Speaker 13:  you just have to use too much of your brain to make the smart shortcut work,

1053
01:03:56,955 --> 01:04:00,715
Speaker 13:  which is the current problem that I think a lot of people who don't have

1054
01:04:01,395 --> 01:04:05,155
Speaker 13:  functional developer brains and are like good at coding or these

1055
01:04:05,155 --> 01:04:08,995
Speaker 13:  like different logic trees have with shortcuts. 'cause you just don't know

1056
01:04:08,995 --> 01:04:12,155
Speaker 13:  what you can do with it. You don't know how to think in that way. Which

1057
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:15,435
Speaker 13:  has been my problem with shortcuts this entire time. I wanna use shortcuts.

1058
01:04:15,715 --> 01:04:18,355
Speaker 13:  I love it. Like when you go into the little gallery and you're like, ooh,

1059
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:22,035
Speaker 13:  I could, I could do this. This is a little fun. There's no like, you know,

1060
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:25,875
Speaker 13:  I asked Apple and I'm, I was just like, hey, so can the Apple

1061
01:04:25,955 --> 01:04:29,915
Speaker 13:  intelligence just see the things that I do and what I'm doing

1062
01:04:30,015 --> 01:04:33,955
Speaker 13:  on like a bit regular basis and make that suggestion for me? Is

1063
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:37,355
Speaker 13:  that what we're having here? And they're like, no, you still gotta use your

1064
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:41,275
Speaker 13:  little brain and then have the AI help you. It's it's supplemental.

1065
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:44,635
Speaker 13:  And I was like, but that's, that's, that's not what I want. I I wanna turn

1066
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:46,715
Speaker 13:  my brain off and have the shortcut happen.

1067
01:04:47,145 --> 01:04:49,875
Speaker 6:  Yeah, you want the thing that's like every time you download a picture of

1068
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:52,115
Speaker 6:  this, you put it over there. Do you want me to just start doing that for

1069
01:04:52,115 --> 01:04:54,315
Speaker 6:  you? Like that's, that's just sitting right there. Yes.

1070
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:56,645
Speaker 7:  That's just super clippy. Yeah,

1071
01:04:57,205 --> 01:05:00,205
Speaker 6:  I mean that's where we're, that's where we've been going buddy. That's what

1072
01:05:00,205 --> 01:05:01,205
Speaker 6:  I want. That's what we're doing. You know,

1073
01:05:01,275 --> 01:05:04,885
Speaker 13:  It's what we want. And, and and you still have to make the super clippy,

1074
01:05:05,025 --> 01:05:08,485
Speaker 13:  you can't just like offload the making of the super clippy. So I, I think

1075
01:05:08,485 --> 01:05:11,965
Speaker 13:  that's the most disappointing thing about it so far. It's a step in the

1076
01:05:11,965 --> 01:05:15,565
Speaker 13:  right direction. It's just not where I want it to be yet.

1077
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:19,765
Speaker 7:  Well you know, it's, I agree that like either you have automation brain

1078
01:05:19,765 --> 01:05:23,705
Speaker 7:  or you don't, right? Like when I get home, turn on all the lights

1079
01:05:24,205 --> 01:05:27,665
Speaker 7:  is you can just say it out loud and then actually programming any smart home

1080
01:05:27,945 --> 01:05:31,865
Speaker 7:  platform to make that happen requires you to like understand if

1081
01:05:31,865 --> 01:05:33,905
Speaker 7:  then statements in a way that some people are like, I'm just never gonna

1082
01:05:33,905 --> 01:05:36,865
Speaker 7:  do this. And then some people are like, that's my whole personality, right?

1083
01:05:37,005 --> 01:05:40,945
Speaker 7:  And so that's one or the other from what I can tell. And

1084
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:44,745
Speaker 7:  the dream is that, you know, even when you talk to the Alexa people or

1085
01:05:44,745 --> 01:05:47,985
Speaker 7:  whoever that the smart home platforms will start to do that for you.

1086
01:05:48,455 --> 01:05:51,825
Speaker 7:  It's still not the case. And even if you look at sort of where the cutting

1087
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:55,985
Speaker 7:  edge of AI agent stuff is and kinda these new look platforms

1088
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:59,465
Speaker 7:  like N eight N which I'm a little bit obsessed with, it's not,

1089
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:03,905
Speaker 7:  you don't have logic gate automation brain. It's that the

1090
01:06:03,905 --> 01:06:07,505
Speaker 7:  stuff you can put like the legal blocks of the if then statements

1091
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:11,185
Speaker 7:  are vastly more powerful than they were before. And you have all these kids

1092
01:06:11,285 --> 01:06:15,225
Speaker 7:  making tiktoks using NAN to like create agents doing all kinds of wild stuff.

1093
01:06:15,825 --> 01:06:19,505
Speaker 7:  'cause the tools even given are more powerful. Not the tool to author

1094
01:06:19,645 --> 01:06:23,225
Speaker 7:  the automation. And I want like that dynamic I think will always exist.

1095
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:27,675
Speaker 7:  And here I think you're just seeing it play out in shortcuts where the, they

1096
01:06:27,675 --> 01:06:30,555
Speaker 7:  haven't figured out the technology problem of making the people who don't

1097
01:06:30,555 --> 01:06:34,395
Speaker 7:  have automation brain like find this to be a rewarding experience

1098
01:06:34,735 --> 01:06:37,915
Speaker 7:  and maybe they never will. But they're giving more and more powerful tools

1099
01:06:37,975 --> 01:06:41,835
Speaker 7:  to people who are like, I love this. And somehow that has to come

1100
01:06:41,995 --> 01:06:45,875
Speaker 7:  together. 'cause it does feel like the future of all computing is

1101
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:49,795
Speaker 7:  just telling computers what to do and assuming that they will do it and that

1102
01:06:49,995 --> 01:06:53,595
Speaker 7:  requires the backend to work in this way. But in the meantime they're just

1103
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:56,555
Speaker 7:  like, here's some more powerful Legos. Like go build whatever weird Lego

1104
01:06:56,795 --> 01:06:58,275
Speaker 7:  structure you want out of if then statements,

1105
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,875
Speaker 6:  Right? And then two thirds of the world looks at those and goes, what is,

1106
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,395
Speaker 6:  why do I have all these legos in front of me? I'm gonna leave.

1107
01:07:04,495 --> 01:07:07,955
Speaker 7:  And then one third of those people sends David angry emails about shortcuts

1108
01:07:08,455 --> 01:07:12,035
Speaker 6:  And I welcome them. I will, I will as I like to do,

1109
01:07:12,265 --> 01:07:15,835
Speaker 6:  show you the opening screen of a new shortcut and you can tell me what to

1110
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:19,475
Speaker 6:  do about it. The first word is scripting and we're done. All right,

1111
01:07:19,485 --> 01:07:23,205
Speaker 6:  let's talk with the iPad, which I think was the other kind of big hit

1112
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,165
Speaker 6:  moment and is also the thing I have been playing with for the last couple

1113
01:07:26,165 --> 01:07:29,845
Speaker 6:  of hours And I have a lot of feelings about it already. iPad S 26,

1114
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:34,565
Speaker 6:  the same thing, Liquid Glass, lots of new apps, but like

1115
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:38,325
Speaker 6:  v they kind of just made this thing a Mac. Did they just kind of make this

1116
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:39,085
Speaker 6:  thing a Mac? They

1117
01:07:39,085 --> 01:07:42,045
Speaker 13:  Did, they made it a Mac. I, you know, like we've been talking for years

1118
01:07:42,055 --> 01:07:45,845
Speaker 13:  about just let me use Mac os on the iPad and they were like,

1119
01:07:45,985 --> 01:07:49,885
Speaker 13:  no, but kind of. So, you know, I I was

1120
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:53,285
Speaker 13:  watching that through the live log And I was like, da David Pierce is like

1121
01:07:53,285 --> 01:07:57,125
Speaker 13:  screeching at this moment somewhere in, in the us Is it a

1122
01:07:57,125 --> 01:08:00,885
Speaker 13:  happy screech or is it a angry screech? I, I don't know, but it it's a screech

1123
01:08:00,885 --> 01:08:02,205
Speaker 13:  that the screech is happening.

1124
01:08:02,515 --> 01:08:05,605
Speaker 6:  I've just been burned so many times. Speed. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.

1125
01:08:05,605 --> 01:08:09,445
Speaker 6:  Every time Apple is like, we've invented a new way to move windows around

1126
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:12,925
Speaker 6:  And I keep being like, what if you, we, we already invented the only one

1127
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:16,245
Speaker 6:  that needs to exist and it's just put them wherever you want. So I don't,

1128
01:08:16,445 --> 01:08:17,805
Speaker 6:  whatever you invented, I like it less,

1129
01:08:19,355 --> 01:08:20,455
Speaker 6:  but they did it better this time

1130
01:08:20,635 --> 01:08:23,935
Speaker 7:  By the way. I have an answer from some, you know, on the ground conversations

1131
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,815
Speaker 7:  about why, why they tried everything else first. You are not gonna

1132
01:08:27,815 --> 01:08:29,695
Speaker 7:  like it, but this is the answer I was told because

1133
01:08:29,695 --> 01:08:31,095
Speaker 6:  They hate me personally. Yes.

1134
01:08:31,095 --> 01:08:34,975
Speaker 7:  They're like, we're we've run out of ways to torture David Pierce.

1135
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:39,655
Speaker 7:  No, the iPad is a touch device and they were never ever,

1136
01:08:39,685 --> 01:08:43,655
Speaker 7:  ever gonna trade away against the zero lag responsiveness of the touchscreen

1137
01:08:43,655 --> 01:08:47,405
Speaker 7:  on the iPad. And so they were like, it would be too hard to allow

1138
01:08:47,435 --> 01:08:51,325
Speaker 7:  full Mac like multitasking and multi windowing and apps all running

1139
01:08:51,325 --> 01:08:55,165
Speaker 7:  at once because we can trade away against the latency of

1140
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:59,005
Speaker 7:  the Mac interface. Like you can, this happens, you can click on stuff

1141
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:01,765
Speaker 7:  on a Mac of like, nothing happens. You're like, huh, that's weird. If you

1142
01:09:01,765 --> 01:09:05,615
Speaker 7:  touch a screen and nothing happens, you're like, this thing's dead, right?

1143
01:09:05,645 --> 01:09:09,495
Speaker 7:  Like you can see the mouse pointer always moves on a Mac when

1144
01:09:09,495 --> 01:09:13,175
Speaker 7:  the mouse pointer stops moving, you're like, my Mac is dead. The mouse pointer

1145
01:09:13,175 --> 01:09:15,255
Speaker 7:  moves and you click on stuff and nothing happens. You're like, oh, this thing's

1146
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:18,415
Speaker 7:  being slow. You touch an iPad screen, nothing happens. Or it gets dead and

1147
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:21,655
Speaker 7:  there's no other indication that it's still alive. So their, their argument

1148
01:09:21,655 --> 01:09:25,375
Speaker 7:  was, we, we needed this much horsepower on the latest blah blah, blah generation

1149
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,575
Speaker 7:  of blah blah blah, blah blah. So that we could finally allow you to do full

1150
01:09:28,575 --> 01:09:32,225
Speaker 7:  window multitasking in this way. I didn't say you were gonna like it And

1151
01:09:32,225 --> 01:09:35,385
Speaker 7:  I can already see David's face, but I'm telling you this is a thing that

1152
01:09:35,545 --> 01:09:36,785
Speaker 7:  a a few people there told me,

1153
01:09:37,345 --> 01:09:41,225
Speaker 6:  I buy the premise, I don't buy that the technology did not exist

1154
01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:43,305
Speaker 6:  before today. Do you know what I mean?

1155
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:44,545
Speaker 7:  Just like telling you what I heard.

1156
01:09:45,405 --> 01:09:48,545
Speaker 6:  But so the the new multitasking system is is like, it's it's

1157
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:52,825
Speaker 6:  almost freeform multitasking. It is not

1158
01:09:53,015 --> 01:09:56,945
Speaker 6:  exactly. There are a couple of rules you have to follow and it also, a lot

1159
01:09:56,945 --> 01:10:00,865
Speaker 6:  of it as ever depends on the, the actual design of the

1160
01:10:00,865 --> 01:10:04,345
Speaker 6:  apps themselves. I installed the beta and I've been playing around with it.

1161
01:10:04,405 --> 01:10:08,345
Speaker 6:  And if you want to just pull 12 apps in and have them

1162
01:10:08,365 --> 01:10:12,225
Speaker 6:  all sitting on top of each other, you can and it's awesome and no one

1163
01:10:12,225 --> 01:10:15,225
Speaker 6:  should do it because it breaks immediately and it doesn't really,

1164
01:10:15,225 --> 01:10:16,225
Speaker 7:  Doesn't make sense. Well there you go.

1165
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:19,585
Speaker 13:  I was gonna ask, I was gonna ask like what is the maximum window

1166
01:10:20,395 --> 01:10:22,705
Speaker 13:  count that you can have on, on an iPad?

1167
01:10:23,025 --> 01:10:26,865
Speaker 6:  I believe I've had eight at once on the screen so far, which is

1168
01:10:26,865 --> 01:10:30,705
Speaker 6:  already like three or four more than makes any plausible sense to have.

1169
01:10:32,245 --> 01:10:35,745
Speaker 6:  But you, but I did it and it was there and it was working. And that is

1170
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:39,705
Speaker 6:  something, it's a little confusing now because there are,

1171
01:10:40,205 --> 01:10:44,145
Speaker 6:  so the, the, the framework is basically you have, you have your

1172
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:47,625
Speaker 6:  home screen with the app icons and then the, the sort of mental model is

1173
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:51,065
Speaker 6:  there is now just like a screen over here that you put apps on.

1174
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:55,185
Speaker 6:  You can either open an app full screen or you can you, you tap the little

1175
01:10:56,005 --> 01:10:59,385
Speaker 6:  bar in the corner and drag it to whatever size you want it to be and then

1176
01:10:59,725 --> 01:11:02,625
Speaker 6:  it sits there. You can drag another one on top of it. You can change the

1177
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,505
Speaker 6:  size depending on how they've laid the app out. Some of them will only do

1178
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:09,465
Speaker 6:  like iPad size, smaller iPad size and iPhone size. Some will

1179
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:12,865
Speaker 6:  only do one. Some you can like freeform move around as you want to, but they

1180
01:11:12,865 --> 01:11:16,525
Speaker 6:  all just kind of live on this one screen together, right? All the apps.

1181
01:11:16,785 --> 01:11:20,725
Speaker 6:  And then if you, if you tap on the new little menu, it gives

1182
01:11:20,725 --> 01:11:24,445
Speaker 6:  you the, the red, yellow green buttons, you hit the green one, it full

1183
01:11:24,445 --> 01:11:27,885
Speaker 6:  screens it. If you hit the yellow one, it minimizes it

1184
01:11:28,265 --> 01:11:30,725
Speaker 6:  and if you hit the red one, it closes it. And if you were to say, David,

1185
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:33,605
Speaker 6:  what's the difference between minimizing an app on an iPad and closing an

1186
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:37,175
Speaker 6:  app on an iPad? I absolutely could not tell you no idea.

1187
01:11:37,675 --> 01:11:41,615
Speaker 6:  In both cases it just like animated retreats back into the icon

1188
01:11:42,075 --> 01:11:45,815
Speaker 6:  and then when you tap it, it opens again And I don't, I don't know what the

1189
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:46,815
Speaker 6:  difference is. I will say

1190
01:11:46,815 --> 01:11:50,415
Speaker 7:  Apple has never, from the beginning of the

1191
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:54,145
Speaker 7:  three, the stoplight metaphor for the windows, they've never

1192
01:11:54,145 --> 01:11:57,745
Speaker 7:  really known what the other two buttons are for. No. Like they've always

1193
01:11:57,745 --> 01:12:01,625
Speaker 7:  known what red is for. Yes. And the other ones are like, well we have

1194
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:02,225
Speaker 7:  the stoplight

1195
01:12:03,795 --> 01:12:05,385
Speaker 7:  stuff, they're for stuff.

1196
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:09,905
Speaker 8:  It's like when I, you know how you have there, there's clean

1197
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:12,505
Speaker 8:  clothes in your house, there's a dirty clothes and then there's the like,

1198
01:12:12,685 --> 01:12:16,345
Speaker 8:  ah, you know I'm, I might not be done with this. That's like the yellow light

1199
01:12:16,525 --> 01:12:20,265
Speaker 8:  one that's just a little pile on the dresser of

1200
01:12:20,265 --> 01:12:22,345
Speaker 8:  like, maybe I'll use that a

1201
01:12:22,345 --> 01:12:23,905
Speaker 6:  Little bit. It's the one you smell and you're like, I can get away with it.

1202
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:24,465
Speaker 6:  And it is kind

1203
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,105
Speaker 8:  Of, you're like, yeah, this is still okay.

1204
01:12:26,855 --> 01:12:30,465
Speaker 7:  Yeah, the green button in particular for a long time on the Mac was just

1205
01:12:30,465 --> 01:12:30,825
Speaker 7:  like a

1206
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:33,595
Speaker 7:  whatever we think this time. Like

1207
01:12:34,265 --> 01:12:37,675
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Didn't it just sort of, my memory of it is it just randomly changed

1208
01:12:37,695 --> 01:12:39,315
Speaker 6:  the size of the app to whatever it felt like.

1209
01:12:39,345 --> 01:12:42,155
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's what it's, it's just like green means go, you know what I mean?

1210
01:12:42,155 --> 01:12:45,475
Speaker 7:  Like whatever you think go means in this context, it's, that's what might

1211
01:12:45,475 --> 01:12:49,395
Speaker 7:  happen. Yeah. And I think on the iPad you have the same between red and yellow.

1212
01:12:50,775 --> 01:12:52,185
Speaker 7:  It's fine, it's fine. Sure.

1213
01:12:52,255 --> 01:12:54,705
Speaker 6:  It's whatever. But there are a bunch of things about it that I think are

1214
01:12:54,705 --> 01:12:58,345
Speaker 6:  pretty clever. Like it has a little, they demoed this, the sort of little

1215
01:12:58,355 --> 01:13:01,505
Speaker 6:  flick gesture that you can do to, to anchor it to one side of the screen

1216
01:13:01,505 --> 01:13:05,385
Speaker 6:  or the other that works well. But like a lot of apple things you have

1217
01:13:05,705 --> 01:13:09,385
Speaker 6:  to like really learn how to do it. It's like a, you have to do kind of a

1218
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:13,305
Speaker 6:  half flick to like the middle of the side. If you flick it too hard,

1219
01:13:13,485 --> 01:13:15,305
Speaker 6:  it just like bounces off and comes back. Wait,

1220
01:13:15,305 --> 01:13:17,145
Speaker 7:  Do you, are you flicking with your finger or using the mouse?

1221
01:13:18,085 --> 01:13:20,745
Speaker 6:  So you can do it with the mouse but I I I've just mostly been doing it with

1222
01:13:20,745 --> 01:13:22,105
Speaker 6:  my thumbs. So you've

1223
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:24,185
Speaker 7:  Been like steam decking apps all over you.

1224
01:13:24,385 --> 01:13:28,265
Speaker 6:  Yeah, absolutely. But now to your point about the,

1225
01:13:28,325 --> 01:13:31,865
Speaker 6:  the mouse there is now like an honest to God pointer,

1226
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:36,265
Speaker 6:  which makes such a bigger difference than I realized. Like there's been,

1227
01:13:36,285 --> 01:13:38,865
Speaker 6:  you could, you could move a cursor around but it was a little, little circular

1228
01:13:38,955 --> 01:13:42,625
Speaker 6:  thing. Yeah. Now it feels like you have a mouse on the computer and you can

1229
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:46,425
Speaker 6:  click small things now. And it really like

1230
01:13:46,595 --> 01:13:50,065
Speaker 6:  those two things. Plus there's now a preview app which is just for PDFs,

1231
01:13:50,065 --> 01:13:53,105
Speaker 6:  which speaking of like a whole industry that just immediately got sherlocked

1232
01:13:53,105 --> 01:13:56,625
Speaker 6:  like sorry to everybody who built the $10 app for editing PDFs

1233
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:57,785
Speaker 6:  because you're out

1234
01:13:57,785 --> 01:14:00,145
Speaker 7:  Of this, you're fine, you deserve to die and you know it. That's

1235
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:01,185
Speaker 6:  Fair. I don't feel that

1236
01:14:01,385 --> 01:14:05,225
Speaker 7:  Bad. Your weird subscription N-F-T-P-D-F viewer, like

1237
01:14:06,045 --> 01:14:07,705
Speaker 7:  you should have been dead a long time ago. Yeah.

1238
01:14:07,725 --> 01:14:11,525
Speaker 6:  All the free trials I have signed up for to get Acrobat for one day to be

1239
01:14:11,525 --> 01:14:13,885
Speaker 6:  able to edit A-P-D-F-I no longer feel bad. You're

1240
01:14:13,885 --> 01:14:17,445
Speaker 7:  Not seen in the first Batman movie, the 89 Batman where the joker says, I'm

1241
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:20,525
Speaker 7:  glad you're dead and starts cackling. I want you to picture my face, do an

1242
01:14:20,545 --> 01:14:22,925
Speaker 7:  AI of my face doing that A PDF

1243
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:26,405
Speaker 6:  App. Love that for you. So yeah, put those things together. And then there's

1244
01:14:26,405 --> 01:14:30,165
Speaker 6:  a bunch of changes to the files app where now there's a list

1245
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:34,085
Speaker 6:  view. They made a big deal out of a list view once a year. There

1246
01:14:34,085 --> 01:14:37,405
Speaker 6:  is a thing at WW DC where they're like, we've invented a computer feature

1247
01:14:37,435 --> 01:14:37,885
Speaker 6:  from the

1248
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:41,765
Speaker 8:  Seventies. Can, can I say they did a whole screen that was just

1249
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:46,205
Speaker 8:  files in the doc like, like just in bold, like

1250
01:14:46,205 --> 01:14:50,005
Speaker 8:  beautiful print. And I was like, oh well that's going in the live

1251
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:51,205
Speaker 8:  blog 'cause it's so silly.

1252
01:14:51,515 --> 01:14:55,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And then they're like, oh do, we're gonna explain to you how it works

1253
01:14:55,145 --> 01:14:58,885
Speaker 6:  and how it works is exactly like it does on the Mac. You tap on it

1254
01:14:59,105 --> 01:15:02,165
Speaker 6:  and it opens up and shows you the files and then you can click the files

1255
01:15:02,225 --> 01:15:05,565
Speaker 6:  and drag them somewhere. Like Neela, what was the, what was the thing last

1256
01:15:05,565 --> 01:15:09,045
Speaker 6:  year where they were, they were showing some kind of multitasking thing and

1257
01:15:09,045 --> 01:15:12,605
Speaker 6:  Craig Figi was like, he dragged something from one screen to another

1258
01:15:13,305 --> 01:15:16,805
Speaker 6:  on it was like the external display thing and he like it was, it was, it

1259
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:19,605
Speaker 6:  was just his mind was blown that you could have something on one display

1260
01:15:19,605 --> 01:15:22,165
Speaker 6:  and then you could have it on the other display and then it was just like,

1261
01:15:22,165 --> 01:15:23,045
Speaker 6:  we're just doing this again.

1262
01:15:23,575 --> 01:15:27,485
Speaker 7:  There isn't most of the iPad features where they just made the iPad

1263
01:15:27,525 --> 01:15:31,485
Speaker 7:  a Mac were I think targeted specifically at me and my complaints about

1264
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:34,085
Speaker 7:  the iPad over the years. They're like, let's talk about files. And it's like,

1265
01:15:34,085 --> 01:15:36,925
Speaker 7:  yeah dude, I told you do this a decade ago,

1266
01:15:38,545 --> 01:15:42,245
Speaker 7:  but they ended it all by, you know, like a very self-deprecating way,

1267
01:15:42,255 --> 01:15:45,045
Speaker 7:  right? They're like, can you imagine a pointer in a menu bar and Windows?

1268
01:15:45,265 --> 01:15:48,445
Speaker 7:  Who would've thought of these ideas? Like that's true. They know. Yeah, they

1269
01:15:48,445 --> 01:15:52,405
Speaker 7:  know what they're doing. But you know, the opportunity with the iPad

1270
01:15:52,405 --> 01:15:55,915
Speaker 7:  is you get to have these ideas from a fresh start because every year you

1271
01:15:55,915 --> 01:15:59,835
Speaker 7:  can change them app apparently. You know, and like the thing

1272
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:03,715
Speaker 7:  that's holding the iPad back is not the multi window model. It's

1273
01:16:03,715 --> 01:16:07,595
Speaker 7:  that iPad apps are bad. Yes. And until they open up the app store in some

1274
01:16:07,595 --> 01:16:11,425
Speaker 7:  way to solve that problem, well the iPad apps

1275
01:16:11,425 --> 01:16:14,705
Speaker 7:  are still gonna be bad and you can have as many, you know, sort of like cut

1276
01:16:14,705 --> 01:16:17,545
Speaker 7:  down versions of real apps as you want in your iPad in as many windows as

1277
01:16:17,545 --> 01:16:21,425
Speaker 7:  you want. But that's your problem. And they didn't nothing to address that.

1278
01:16:23,715 --> 01:16:27,285
Speaker 6:  No that, I mean that has forever been the thing Apple

1279
01:16:27,435 --> 01:16:30,285
Speaker 6:  just can't figure out how to do for some reason is convince

1280
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:34,925
Speaker 6:  anyone other than like a very specific set of creative tools like

1281
01:16:34,925 --> 01:16:38,645
Speaker 6:  you, you can get honest to God, like professional class creative tools

1282
01:16:38,825 --> 01:16:42,725
Speaker 6:  on the iPad. They're very good and you, you can, if you are a

1283
01:16:42,805 --> 01:16:46,685
Speaker 6:  creative person, you want to do your job. Ironically it is easier

1284
01:16:46,865 --> 01:16:50,765
Speaker 6:  to do your like fancy 3D modeling job on your, on

1285
01:16:50,765 --> 01:16:54,165
Speaker 6:  the iPad than it is to send emails all day on the iPad. Like

1286
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:58,365
Speaker 6:  it's crazy. This is where we are. But I think, I think you're right,

1287
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:01,925
Speaker 6:  but I also think to the extent that what maybe has been

1288
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:06,085
Speaker 6:  gating people from doing that is the sense of like, I can

1289
01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:09,490
Speaker 6:  do a lot of stuff at once and move quickly between things and sort of feel

1290
01:17:10,285 --> 01:17:13,085
Speaker 6:  powerful on an iPad. The way I feel powerful on a Mac.

1291
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:17,505
Speaker 6:  This theoretically at least we'll see how it all actually works. But like

1292
01:17:17,505 --> 01:17:20,985
Speaker 6:  this kind of solves all of my problems in a way that I have not experienced

1293
01:17:20,985 --> 01:17:21,985
Speaker 6:  before with an iPad.

1294
01:17:22,225 --> 01:17:25,825
Speaker 7:  I look forward to the years worth of, I try to use it an iPad to replace

1295
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:27,345
Speaker 7:  my Mac coverage to come.

1296
01:17:27,945 --> 01:17:28,105
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1297
01:17:29,185 --> 01:17:32,185
Speaker 7:  I suspect everyone's gonna end up right back on their max, but yeah.

1298
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:36,425
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I I, I inevitably I am going to write that story in the next three

1299
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:39,905
Speaker 6:  months. So I, I shouldn't, I shouldn't really give anybody any crap. Like

1300
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:43,185
Speaker 6:  I had a second kid and decided to go all in on an iPad is like a thing that's

1301
01:17:43,185 --> 01:17:43,665
Speaker 7:  Coming. It's

1302
01:17:43,665 --> 01:17:44,745
Speaker 6:  A thing that's coming for me. It happens.

1303
01:17:44,775 --> 01:17:45,065
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1304
01:17:46,035 --> 01:17:49,945
Speaker 6:  Let's see. Other stuff in the iPad there

1305
01:17:50,115 --> 01:17:54,065
Speaker 6:  again. Also got a phone app. Is it weird that there's just now a

1306
01:17:54,065 --> 01:17:57,785
Speaker 6:  phone app everywhere? I've been having a lot of like Galaxy brand feelings

1307
01:17:57,785 --> 01:18:00,505
Speaker 6:  about this, but I I maybe it doesn't matter. It just make phone calls, who

1308
01:18:00,505 --> 01:18:01,345
Speaker 6:  cares? Yeah.

1309
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:04,625
Speaker 7:  I think Apple realize that messaging is like a core use case of every kind

1310
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:08,345
Speaker 7:  of computer now. And it's weird to only tie

1311
01:18:08,345 --> 01:18:12,145
Speaker 7:  their ecosystem to the like Cell

1312
01:18:12,195 --> 01:18:16,145
Speaker 7:  Voice network that exists on the phone. 'cause they also

1313
01:18:16,145 --> 01:18:18,825
Speaker 7:  have messages and FaceTime and all this other stuff and they control your

1314
01:18:18,825 --> 01:18:22,025
Speaker 7:  phone and they can just pass like real phone audio to it. Like no one else

1315
01:18:22,025 --> 01:18:23,305
Speaker 7:  limits themself in this way.

1316
01:18:23,685 --> 01:18:26,865
Speaker 13:  But can you imagine the phone app going off on all of your Apple devices

1317
01:18:27,005 --> 01:18:28,585
Speaker 13:  at the same time? Because it's there.

1318
01:18:28,775 --> 01:18:29,665
Speaker 7:  That happens today.

1319
01:18:29,855 --> 01:18:33,225
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it already does. Do you not, does 10 things not ring when you get a

1320
01:18:33,225 --> 01:18:35,225
Speaker 13:  Phone call? I know, but like even more.

1321
01:18:35,415 --> 01:18:37,705
Speaker 7:  Yeah. By the way, they, what the thing they didn't solve anywhere is like

1322
01:18:37,705 --> 01:18:41,425
Speaker 7:  notifications or prioritizing which devices get notifications like

1323
01:18:41,525 --> 01:18:44,985
Speaker 7:  the main problem in their ecosystem as expressed. Ve to your point,

1324
01:18:45,655 --> 01:18:49,185
Speaker 7:  like the phone app goes off everywhere without any sense of what what you

1325
01:18:49,185 --> 01:18:53,115
Speaker 7:  are or like where you are or what you're doing. It would

1326
01:18:53,115 --> 01:18:56,635
Speaker 7:  be nice if they were like, also we've made it so that notifications consistently

1327
01:18:56,635 --> 01:18:59,515
Speaker 7:  show up where you, they need to be no mention of that.

1328
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:03,915
Speaker 6:  The other thing was local video and audio capture. They made like

1329
01:19:03,995 --> 01:19:07,835
Speaker 6:  a real outreach to podcasters in this one. They're like, if you're, if

1330
01:19:07,855 --> 01:19:10,595
Speaker 6:  if you wanna record all your stuff locally while you're on video calls now

1331
01:19:10,595 --> 01:19:10,915
Speaker 6:  you can,

1332
01:19:11,755 --> 01:19:15,315
Speaker 7:  I think this is like, this is a main complaint of creators who use iPads

1333
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:18,395
Speaker 7:  a lot From what I, from what I gather. That's true because app, like we're

1334
01:19:18,395 --> 01:19:22,115
Speaker 7:  recording this in this app called Riverside and like that just is not a choice

1335
01:19:22,255 --> 01:19:25,955
Speaker 7:  on an iPad, right? You have you running a local recording while you're doing

1336
01:19:25,955 --> 01:19:29,435
Speaker 7:  that. It's interesting that they didn't express some API to let two apps

1337
01:19:29,505 --> 01:19:32,715
Speaker 7:  pull audio and video and record them themselves, which is what every Mac

1338
01:19:32,895 --> 01:19:35,835
Speaker 7:  in the world can do. But they're like, we'll do it for you.

1339
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,835
Speaker 7:  And then they made a big demo, they made a big deal out of like, and then

1340
01:19:39,835 --> 01:19:42,195
Speaker 7:  you can share your local files and it's like, yeah, that's what you would

1341
01:19:42,775 --> 01:19:46,715
Speaker 7:  if you recorded my local files. You lemme share them like that. That makes

1342
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:47,155
Speaker 7:  no sense.

1343
01:19:49,095 --> 01:19:52,515
Speaker 7:  But you know, they, what they did is they came after platforms like Riverside

1344
01:19:52,515 --> 01:19:56,435
Speaker 7:  with that. That is the thing that a Riverside would do. There's a bunch of

1345
01:19:56,595 --> 01:20:00,515
Speaker 7:  other ones there, but that's what they, that's what a lot of creators have

1346
01:20:00,515 --> 01:20:04,315
Speaker 7:  asked for on the iPad. This is a great mobile podcasting setup, but for

1347
01:20:04,315 --> 01:20:07,565
Speaker 7:  the fact that I can't actually record locally. Well they've the problem,

1348
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:11,725
Speaker 6:  Right? And I yeah, there's a, there's a real, like do any creators

1349
01:20:12,085 --> 01:20:15,285
Speaker 6:  actually use iPads Road? We could go down right now, but let's let's avoid

1350
01:20:15,285 --> 01:20:19,085
Speaker 6:  that. Alison, you, you are a creator who uses an iPad for everything,

1351
01:20:19,085 --> 01:20:22,485
Speaker 6:  right? This is like, I oh God, you, you did not seem as excited as I was

1352
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:25,525
Speaker 6:  about multitasking. So like, let's just, how do you feel about the

1353
01:20:25,525 --> 01:20:29,125
Speaker 8:  IPad? You know what, before we, before I, so many, many years ago

1354
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:34,005
Speaker 8:  I was between jobs And I had to like give away my work

1355
01:20:34,285 --> 01:20:37,445
Speaker 8:  computer and didn't have a computer for a while and

1356
01:20:38,195 --> 01:20:40,925
Speaker 8:  went to Best Buy. I was like, iPad

1357
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:45,965
Speaker 8:  and a keyboard. This is computer, right? And it was like

1358
01:20:45,985 --> 01:20:49,725
Speaker 8:  all the pieces are here. I like bought it all and, and went back home And

1359
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:54,045
Speaker 8:  I was like, oh no, this is not a computer. This

1360
01:20:54,045 --> 01:20:57,885
Speaker 8:  doesn't let you do the thing you need to do. It just like, is so funny. Like

1361
01:20:58,545 --> 01:21:02,405
Speaker 8:  how many ways Apple will give you this and give you that?

1362
01:21:02,505 --> 01:21:06,085
Speaker 8:  And they're like, well you can record locally 'cause you're a creator

1363
01:21:06,455 --> 01:21:10,325
Speaker 8:  who's traveling with an iPad so you can do this computer thing on

1364
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:13,965
Speaker 8:  your iPad or we'll give you the red, green and yellow buttons

1365
01:21:14,105 --> 01:21:17,885
Speaker 8:  and it, but you know, won't go up to the

1366
01:21:17,885 --> 01:21:21,645
Speaker 8:  line of this is a full computer. It's just, yeah.

1367
01:21:21,705 --> 01:21:25,525
Speaker 8:  It it is a very interesting kind of dance, I think to see them

1368
01:21:25,585 --> 01:21:25,805
Speaker 8:  do.

1369
01:21:26,405 --> 01:21:28,885
Speaker 6:  Somebody once described the difference to me, and this is years ago, but

1370
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:32,725
Speaker 6:  I think it's still true, is when you buy a Mac you buy a computer

1371
01:21:33,225 --> 01:21:35,925
Speaker 6:  and when you buy an iPad you buy a list of things you're allowed to do.

1372
01:21:37,245 --> 01:21:40,365
Speaker 6:  And I, I think about that all the time. Yeah. And I think it's it's so true

1373
01:21:40,365 --> 01:21:43,125
Speaker 6:  that it's like, and the list is getting longer, right? And and to Apple's

1374
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:47,085
Speaker 6:  credit, the list is is more sort of power user friendly than ever. But

1375
01:21:47,085 --> 01:21:51,005
Speaker 6:  it is still a list of things you can do. And it is not, it is

1376
01:21:51,005 --> 01:21:54,925
Speaker 6:  not a computer in in that same way. Let's talk about iOS,

1377
01:21:55,295 --> 01:21:59,205
Speaker 6:  which is shockingly third on the list for me. And I went through this list

1378
01:21:59,225 --> 01:22:03,045
Speaker 6:  and was like, iOS is kind of not that

1379
01:22:03,045 --> 01:22:06,925
Speaker 6:  exci like to me, me, the messages app is the most interesting thing happening

1380
01:22:07,105 --> 01:22:09,005
Speaker 6:  in iOS 26. Well you don't think

1381
01:22:09,065 --> 01:22:12,445
Speaker 7:  The dynamic dynamic clock on the lock screen is worth five minutes of keynote

1382
01:22:12,445 --> 01:22:13,485
Speaker 7:  time. Long

1383
01:22:13,765 --> 01:22:17,685
Speaker 8:  Clock get ready for long clock. Long clock.

1384
01:22:20,955 --> 01:22:21,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1385
01:22:21,885 --> 01:22:25,565
Speaker 7:  I mean it's, but the clock gets dynamically less long when you get notifications

1386
01:22:27,115 --> 01:22:30,965
Speaker 8:  Dynamically less long. Is is a that's a, that's a short,

1387
01:22:30,965 --> 01:22:32,365
Speaker 7:  That's a bad date. That's what that

1388
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:37,925
Speaker 7:  Oh no, well now we're gonna make that

1389
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:38,165
Speaker 8:  Shirt.

1390
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:42,565
Speaker 6:  I love that. Dynamically less long. 20 20, 26

1391
01:22:43,235 --> 01:22:44,245
Speaker 6:  vote vote The Verge.

1392
01:22:47,315 --> 01:22:51,205
Speaker 6:  Well first of all, shout out to Joanna Stern who was on this podcast on

1393
01:22:51,205 --> 01:22:55,085
Speaker 6:  Friday demanding typing indicators in group chats and she got them.

1394
01:22:55,085 --> 01:22:58,165
Speaker 6:  That's chaotic. Yeah. Okay. That's so chaotic. You, you said this in the

1395
01:22:58,165 --> 01:23:01,725
Speaker 6:  live blog And I assumed everyone would be happy about this feature. Why are

1396
01:23:01,725 --> 01:23:02,685
Speaker 6:  you not happy about this feature?

1397
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,005
Speaker 14:  Do do you,

1398
01:23:05,095 --> 01:23:08,275
Speaker 13:  Do you not have group chat drama happening all the time? Have you seen this

1399
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:12,195
Speaker 13:  TikTok series of this woman who just, she is acting out nine

1400
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:15,955
Speaker 13:  people in a group chat and just like the social dynamics

1401
01:23:15,955 --> 01:23:19,795
Speaker 13:  that happen in this group chat typing indicators. What what's gonna

1402
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:23,435
Speaker 13:  happen is you're gonna have the group chat and the side chats going on and

1403
01:23:24,115 --> 01:23:27,715
Speaker 13:  everyone's gonna be ganging up on let's call her Betty. And Betty is just

1404
01:23:27,715 --> 01:23:30,915
Speaker 13:  gonna put a little question in and then she's gonna see 5,000 different

1405
01:23:30,915 --> 01:23:34,835
Speaker 13:  people doing the typing indicator, stopping typing, stopping typing,

1406
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:39,115
Speaker 13:  stopping. Betty's gonna have an anxiety attack breakdown. And then, you

1407
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:42,915
Speaker 13:  know, the, the group chat's going to implode and someone is going to just,

1408
01:23:43,065 --> 01:23:46,235
Speaker 13:  friendships will end over typing indicators as will

1409
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:50,675
Speaker 13:  family relationships. 'cause you're just gonna see someone typing for a

1410
01:23:50,675 --> 01:23:54,355
Speaker 13:  really long time and two family members are gonna go, oh my God, was she

1411
01:23:54,445 --> 01:23:57,075
Speaker 13:  she's typing forever. Was she gonna say something? And then they're gonna

1412
01:23:57,075 --> 01:24:00,955
Speaker 13:  put it in the wrong group chat. Friendships and families will end. I I am

1413
01:24:00,955 --> 01:24:03,555
Speaker 13:  telling you right now, typing indicators are

1414
01:24:03,795 --> 01:24:05,835
Speaker 7:  Dangerous. I've never been happier to be an old dad.

1415
01:24:08,905 --> 01:24:10,755
Speaker 6:  Yeah. My group chats are not that dramatic.

1416
01:24:11,695 --> 01:24:15,035
Speaker 13:  Oh, I, you know what, I love this for you. I think that's blessed.

1417
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:17,035
Speaker 13:  My group chats are cursed.

1418
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:17,675
Speaker 6:  Okay.

1419
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:21,515
Speaker 7:  We're gonna find out if we can turn 'em off or somehow make them bigger and

1420
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:24,555
Speaker 7:  louder. 'cause I think like this, you want to go in one of two directions.

1421
01:24:24,955 --> 01:24:27,275
Speaker 6:  I think four dots for vs group chat. I think

1422
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:30,995
Speaker 8:  That is the indicator. Think the angrier your message, the bigger the indicator

1423
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:34,555
Speaker 8:  gets. It could be really chaotic. I like that. I think just like, where are

1424
01:24:34,555 --> 01:24:38,395
Speaker 8:  we safe from typing indicators like they've crept into

1425
01:24:38,495 --> 01:24:42,155
Speaker 8:  so many messaging apps. It's like everybody's gotta know when I'm typing

1426
01:24:42,315 --> 01:24:45,875
Speaker 8:  a message in Slack And I change my mind. Like I have to consider that

1427
01:24:46,535 --> 01:24:49,635
Speaker 8:  now. Now it's gonna be in the group chat and you have to think about that

1428
01:24:49,635 --> 01:24:53,435
Speaker 8:  dynamic. Yeah, I I can I I think I side with me on this.

1429
01:24:53,695 --> 01:24:54,115
Speaker 8:  That's,

1430
01:24:54,115 --> 01:24:57,435
Speaker 13:  That's, that's exactly it. You know when you're in Slack and then someone

1431
01:24:57,465 --> 01:25:00,515
Speaker 13:  says something and then you just see several people are typing.

1432
01:25:01,395 --> 01:25:04,835
Speaker 13:  T you bring that into the group chat on your phone. Now it's gonna be something.

1433
01:25:04,835 --> 01:25:08,275
Speaker 13:  Someone's gonna say something controversial and then several people typing

1434
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:11,035
Speaker 13:  indicators are happening and then it's, it's just, I, but

1435
01:25:11,035 --> 01:25:14,715
Speaker 6:  That's, that's Eli's dream. Just drop a bomb in the group chat and cause

1436
01:25:14,795 --> 01:25:18,635
Speaker 6:  us several people are typing and he's just like, I did it. Everything. Wait,

1437
01:25:18,825 --> 01:25:22,075
Speaker 6:  real, real quick poll of the group here. Are y'all read receipts people?

1438
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,915
Speaker 6:  No. Do you read receipts on or off? No. Thank

1439
01:25:23,915 --> 01:25:27,875
Speaker 13:  You. No, no. I I I had one instance where I didn't realize they

1440
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:31,355
Speaker 13:  were on And I left someone on red and they crashed out so

1441
01:25:31,785 --> 01:25:35,435
Speaker 13:  hard. And lemme tell you, this was not someone I was seeing, this was not

1442
01:25:35,475 --> 01:25:39,435
Speaker 13:  a friend. This was my like father's friend And I just didn't have an

1443
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:43,195
Speaker 13:  answer for her And I'll be like, I'll answer this later. She crashed out

1444
01:25:43,255 --> 01:25:46,275
Speaker 13:  and sent me so many screenshots going like, I see that you read my message,

1445
01:25:46,275 --> 01:25:48,395
Speaker 13:  you didn't say anything. And I was like, after that, whoa, I have never

1446
01:25:48,395 --> 01:25:51,995
Speaker 13:  had red receipts on because I was just like, there are some people.

1447
01:25:53,055 --> 01:25:53,595
Speaker 7:  Did he tell your dad

1448
01:25:53,745 --> 01:25:57,595
Speaker 13:  This knowledge? No, my dad was dead. So this was after his funeral.

1449
01:25:57,635 --> 01:26:00,955
Speaker 13:  I see. Which made it even more insane. So it was just like, some people,

1450
01:26:01,905 --> 01:26:04,805
Speaker 13:  they don't need to know what you're doing. Yeah. I think they don't need

1451
01:26:04,805 --> 01:26:05,005
Speaker 13:  to know.

1452
01:26:05,105 --> 01:26:08,715
Speaker 7:  That's how you would turn off read receipts forever, I think is the, just

1453
01:26:08,715 --> 01:26:11,115
Speaker 7:  walking through that situation mentally. Yeah. That's you would, that would,

1454
01:26:11,135 --> 01:26:15,115
Speaker 7:  you would turn that off. Yeah. Yeah. I just don't people to know. I I I

1455
01:26:15,115 --> 01:26:16,595
Speaker 7:  prefer to operate with an Air Fisher street.

1456
01:26:16,595 --> 01:26:20,555
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I, it, i I think it accomplishes nothing. I cannot think

1457
01:26:20,555 --> 01:26:24,315
Speaker 6:  of one good thing that would happen in my life because of

1458
01:26:24,315 --> 01:26:27,155
Speaker 6:  read receipts And I, it's, but I, most people

1459
01:26:27,825 --> 01:26:31,235
Speaker 6:  anecdotally based on like what I see texting with people, most people have

1460
01:26:31,315 --> 01:26:34,715
Speaker 6:  'em on And I can't tell if that's just like, you don't see your own read

1461
01:26:34,715 --> 01:26:38,395
Speaker 6:  receipts so people probably don't know or think about it or lots of people

1462
01:26:38,395 --> 01:26:41,115
Speaker 6:  that are like choosing to do it. Alison, you're the only one who hasn't answered

1463
01:26:41,135 --> 01:26:42,755
Speaker 6:  yet suspiciously quiet about reader sleep.

1464
01:26:43,755 --> 01:26:47,635
Speaker 8:  I have them on And I think I don dunno, I feel like I've kind

1465
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:51,515
Speaker 8:  of tuned them out. I sort of appreciate the Android,

1466
01:26:51,745 --> 01:26:55,155
Speaker 8:  like little check mark. It's like, it, it feels

1467
01:26:55,205 --> 01:26:58,635
Speaker 8:  friendlier I think to have the little check mark of like,

1468
01:26:59,095 --> 01:27:02,715
Speaker 8:  yes, you sent this message, message and yes, they, they

1469
01:27:03,195 --> 01:27:06,475
Speaker 8:  received it and looked at it. I'm like, okay, let's leave it at that. We

1470
01:27:06,475 --> 01:27:09,835
Speaker 8:  don't need to get involved in like who read what, you know,

1471
01:27:10,655 --> 01:27:13,915
Speaker 6:  He and Allison are a real like inside of us all. There are two wolves kind

1472
01:27:13,915 --> 01:27:14,675
Speaker 6:  of situation right now.

1473
01:27:15,305 --> 01:27:18,275
Speaker 7:  What I'm no, what I'm telling you is that tech billionaires have taught a

1474
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:21,995
Speaker 7:  generation of Americans to be surveilled and to surveil one another and you

1475
01:27:21,995 --> 01:27:22,635
Speaker 7:  can fight back.

1476
01:27:24,115 --> 01:27:27,795
Speaker 13:  I agree. I like, you don't need to know if I read the message because

1477
01:27:27,935 --> 01:27:31,635
Speaker 13:  you can just send another one. You don't need to know when I read something,

1478
01:27:31,635 --> 01:27:35,475
Speaker 13:  you don't need to know how bad my A DHD is. So things should just be pri

1479
01:27:35,475 --> 01:27:39,235
Speaker 13:  private also, sometimes I just wanna clear the little red notification

1480
01:27:39,235 --> 01:27:42,715
Speaker 13:  badge and I've just like, that's just what I wanna do. Oh, I'm not

1481
01:27:42,745 --> 01:27:45,355
Speaker 13:  sliding you people just read too much into read receipts.

1482
01:27:45,665 --> 01:27:48,675
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I, I agree. Alright, we need to take one more break and then we're

1483
01:27:48,675 --> 01:27:51,195
Speaker 6:  gonna come back and we're gonna do what I'm calling the, the, all the rest

1484
01:27:51,195 --> 01:27:54,395
Speaker 6:  of the stuff. It's gonna be great. Stick around, we'll be right back.

1485
01:30:21,975 --> 01:30:25,695
Speaker 6:  Alright, we're back. Let's talk watch OS and V.

1486
01:30:26,285 --> 01:30:29,935
Speaker 6:  This we're just, the floor is yours here. Would you like to talk about

1487
01:30:29,935 --> 01:30:33,855
Speaker 6:  Workout Buddy for no more than 72

1488
01:30:33,855 --> 01:30:34,095
Speaker 6:  minutes?

1489
01:30:34,525 --> 01:30:38,215
Speaker 7:  Just it just again we're, I just want Alice And I experienced

1490
01:30:38,215 --> 01:30:41,815
Speaker 7:  sitting next to V in real time while this was being announce

1491
01:30:41,995 --> 01:30:45,855
Speaker 7:  it was like literally like a, another show was taking place. It was very

1492
01:30:45,855 --> 01:30:45,975
Speaker 7:  good.

1493
01:30:46,035 --> 01:30:49,855
Speaker 6:  It was a roller coaster. So watch S 26, same new design,

1494
01:30:50,395 --> 01:30:53,855
Speaker 6:  Liquid Glass, lots of stuff going on. Gets a bunch of stuff from from other

1495
01:30:53,855 --> 01:30:56,855
Speaker 6:  ones. And then there is Workout Buddy V How do you feel?

1496
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:01,655
Speaker 13:  That's how I feel about it. Like, yeah, I don't know if you've ever seen

1497
01:31:01,785 --> 01:31:05,375
Speaker 13:  Bob's Burgers and Tina and Bob's burgers, how she just like

1498
01:31:05,565 --> 01:31:09,535
Speaker 13:  sits there sometimes and just makes a low grade home like that. That was

1499
01:31:09,535 --> 01:31:13,135
Speaker 13:  me. That was what was happening while Workout Buddy

1500
01:31:13,395 --> 01:31:17,255
Speaker 13:  was so like, okay, you hear the size now so

1501
01:31:18,275 --> 01:31:22,215
Speaker 13:  it makes sense that Workout Buddy is happening just because if you

1502
01:31:22,215 --> 01:31:25,935
Speaker 13:  look at any major fitness app, the AI is there, it it, it is there

1503
01:31:26,435 --> 01:31:30,055
Speaker 13:  and it is there to tell you how you're doing based on your data.

1504
01:31:30,055 --> 01:31:33,295
Speaker 13:  Because the thing about fitness tracking is that it

1505
01:31:33,975 --> 01:31:37,415
Speaker 13:  generates a lot of data, but no one knows what to do with that data without

1506
01:31:37,415 --> 01:31:41,375
Speaker 13:  the context. And so everyone is just for years now struggling how

1507
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:45,175
Speaker 13:  to give context to your fitness data and help you interpret it. So

1508
01:31:45,205 --> 01:31:49,055
Speaker 13:  this is like the latest take about shoving AI into fitness

1509
01:31:49,125 --> 01:31:52,895
Speaker 13:  tech. Garmin just introduced a subscription and

1510
01:31:52,995 --> 01:31:56,495
Speaker 13:  shoved AI summaries in there. Anyone who has been using

1511
01:31:56,595 --> 01:32:00,485
Speaker 13:  Strava has been like roasting Strava's implementation

1512
01:32:00,485 --> 01:32:04,125
Speaker 13:  of AI summaries in that platform. So,

1513
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:07,965
Speaker 13:  you know, whoop has an AI coach, aura has an AI

1514
01:32:08,115 --> 01:32:11,885
Speaker 13:  advisor, there's just AI buddies everywhere. In the fitness

1515
01:32:11,995 --> 01:32:15,645
Speaker 13:  tech world, it is very annoying because

1516
01:32:15,755 --> 01:32:19,445
Speaker 13:  most of it is just captain obvious insights. So it's just like

1517
01:32:19,585 --> 01:32:23,165
Speaker 13:  you did a run. Okay, cool. Great. Love that

1518
01:32:23,505 --> 01:32:23,725
Speaker 13:  For

1519
01:32:23,725 --> 01:32:27,525
Speaker 7:  Me, I, that specifically was the demo with a Workout Buddy. Yeah. And we

1520
01:32:27,525 --> 01:32:31,485
Speaker 7:  spent Apple spent minutes of its developer's keynote making us watch a video

1521
01:32:31,485 --> 01:32:34,565
Speaker 7:  of a woman running while a voice was like, you're doing great.

1522
01:32:36,305 --> 01:32:39,965
Speaker 7:  Yes. That was the whole, that was the expression of the product

1523
01:32:40,075 --> 01:32:41,805
Speaker 7:  that we all watched. Yeah.

1524
01:32:42,275 --> 01:32:45,765
Speaker 13:  Yeah. So that's Workout Buddy kind of. But

1525
01:32:46,145 --> 01:32:49,765
Speaker 13:  so what I was told is basically that at the beginning of your

1526
01:32:49,765 --> 01:32:53,245
Speaker 13:  workout, it's going to give you some motivational pep talk at the end of

1527
01:32:53,245 --> 01:32:56,445
Speaker 13:  the workout, it's going to give you a summary of what happened,

1528
01:32:56,895 --> 01:33:00,725
Speaker 13:  which you're gonna have in your workout app. Anyway, I don't understand

1529
01:33:00,745 --> 01:33:04,525
Speaker 13:  why we need to have these audio cues, but if anything significant

1530
01:33:04,525 --> 01:33:07,885
Speaker 13:  happens in the workout itself, like if you reach a

1531
01:33:08,245 --> 01:33:11,965
Speaker 13:  milestone or something, you get the little Workout Buddy going like,

1532
01:33:12,425 --> 01:33:16,365
Speaker 13:  Hey great, you did a PR or something like that. It's

1533
01:33:16,365 --> 01:33:20,165
Speaker 13:  meant to be motivational and positive, which

1534
01:33:20,225 --> 01:33:23,525
Speaker 13:  was a question I asked because I was like, like, you know,

1535
01:33:23,835 --> 01:33:27,285
Speaker 13:  different people respond to different types of training and workout

1536
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:31,565
Speaker 13:  motivations. I, for example, bristle at every

1537
01:33:31,565 --> 01:33:35,085
Speaker 13:  single workout instructor who has had the drill sergeant

1538
01:33:35,415 --> 01:33:39,205
Speaker 13:  thing going like, come on, pick it up, you can do it faster. I will go

1539
01:33:39,205 --> 01:33:42,765
Speaker 13:  slower because I'm like, f you, you don't get to tell me how this run is

1540
01:33:42,765 --> 01:33:44,405
Speaker 13:  gonna go. This is my run buddy.

1541
01:33:44,665 --> 01:33:48,205
Speaker 6:  I'm imagining what works for you is is just someone just very quietly being

1542
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:52,165
Speaker 6:  like, you're the worst. Just give up. Who even cares? Why, why

1543
01:33:52,165 --> 01:33:55,045
Speaker 6:  are you even trying just go home, you know? And you're like, shut up, I'm

1544
01:33:55,045 --> 01:33:55,925
Speaker 6:  gonna run 70 miles.

1545
01:33:56,395 --> 01:33:57,565
Speaker 13:  Yeah. You know, honestly, is

1546
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,805
Speaker 7:  There a Workout Buddy that just like gently negs you the whole time?

1547
01:34:00,145 --> 01:34:01,125
Speaker 13:  Oh no, there is not,

1548
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:03,725
Speaker 7:  Not Does workout, does Workout Buddy have personalities or is it always just

1549
01:34:03,725 --> 01:34:05,165
Speaker 7:  like chipper or Apple fitness instructor?

1550
01:34:06,315 --> 01:34:09,965
Speaker 13:  It's kind, I think it's the, the concept is based around

1551
01:34:09,965 --> 01:34:13,645
Speaker 13:  different types of Apple fitness instructor personalities. So

1552
01:34:13,715 --> 01:34:17,245
Speaker 13:  that different like 50 shades of gentle motivation

1553
01:34:17,545 --> 01:34:21,445
Speaker 13:  is what I think the concept is there because, you know, anytime when we

1554
01:34:21,445 --> 01:34:24,205
Speaker 13:  talk about Apple's approach to fitness, it is meant to be inclusive. It

1555
01:34:24,205 --> 01:34:27,165
Speaker 13:  is meant to be. They don't really go into the drill Sergeant,

1556
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:31,965
Speaker 13:  come on, run faster buddy. Like kind of motivation,

1557
01:34:32,365 --> 01:34:35,205
Speaker 13:  which personally I appreciate because that's rude.

1558
01:34:37,025 --> 01:34:40,885
Speaker 13:  I'm just sort of like when I am running And I'm in the zone

1559
01:34:41,355 --> 01:34:45,325
Speaker 13:  when I'm listening to my stray kids talking about God's menu and do do

1560
01:34:45,345 --> 01:34:49,245
Speaker 13:  do doing, I don't wanna hear, Hey, you did a pr

1561
01:34:49,915 --> 01:34:53,725
Speaker 13:  Yeah, that, that's, that's a later insight. I don't need that while I'm

1562
01:34:53,725 --> 01:34:56,765
Speaker 13:  running. But you know, I'll give it a try. I'll see. Maybe, maybe I will

1563
01:34:56,765 --> 01:34:59,165
Speaker 13:  change my mind. I have changed my mind before, but

1564
01:34:59,165 --> 01:35:02,805
Speaker 7:  Well what's the connection to like, hey, you did a PR

1565
01:35:03,065 --> 01:35:06,605
Speaker 7:  or like, here's your time to a mile run a little bit faster. Like that's,

1566
01:35:07,265 --> 01:35:10,525
Speaker 7:  that's just a combination of like doing some math and then having a text

1567
01:35:10,525 --> 01:35:13,645
Speaker 7:  to speech model. But I haven't What's the connection to like, we're collecting

1568
01:35:13,685 --> 01:35:17,055
Speaker 7:  a bunch of data about you, right? Like that's what

1569
01:35:17,575 --> 01:35:20,015
Speaker 7:  I hear what you're saying, like fitness tracking generates a bunch of data

1570
01:35:20,015 --> 01:35:22,775
Speaker 7:  that no one knows what to do with. Isn't that where you would have an AI

1571
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:25,655
Speaker 7:  being like, here are some patterns, do some stuff

1572
01:35:26,845 --> 01:35:28,295
Speaker 13:  Like ostensibly

1573
01:35:28,465 --> 01:35:31,055
Speaker 7:  Don't only run downhill neli, like, you know, like stuff,

1574
01:35:31,955 --> 01:35:35,855
Speaker 13:  But it depends on your goals, right? Because maybe if your

1575
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:39,575
Speaker 13:  goal is to run a half marathon and the half marathon is really

1576
01:35:39,705 --> 01:35:43,495
Speaker 13:  hilly. Yeah, maybe you want an AI saying like, Hey, So I

1577
01:35:43,555 --> 01:35:47,415
Speaker 13:  see that you are avoiding hill intervals. Maybe don't do that

1578
01:35:47,435 --> 01:35:50,855
Speaker 13:  if you wanna have a good time on your run. Yeah, that ostensibly that could

1579
01:35:50,855 --> 01:35:54,615
Speaker 13:  be something that you want. But if the goal is to just

1580
01:35:55,155 --> 01:35:59,135
Speaker 13:  be active, do you really need that? Do you really need to chase

1581
01:35:59,675 --> 01:36:03,375
Speaker 13:  prs? Because I can tell you from a lot of peop you are gonna get injured

1582
01:36:03,395 --> 01:36:07,175
Speaker 13:  if you do any sport for any period of time. And if you're only chasing

1583
01:36:07,475 --> 01:36:10,655
Speaker 13:  prs, if you're only chasing these goalposts, you will burn out and you will

1584
01:36:10,655 --> 01:36:14,415
Speaker 13:  feel terrible about yourself because you will fall off at a certain

1585
01:36:14,415 --> 01:36:18,015
Speaker 13:  point in time. It's a very delicate balance about what actually

1586
01:36:18,295 --> 01:36:22,175
Speaker 13:  motivates people. And like it's sort of also just like taking

1587
01:36:22,175 --> 01:36:25,495
Speaker 13:  your historical data into context, being like, congratulations, you ran

1588
01:36:25,495 --> 01:36:29,455
Speaker 13:  three times and this route and this is this second best thing

1589
01:36:29,455 --> 01:36:33,415
Speaker 13:  that you've done on this segment of this wrap. Do you really meet? Is

1590
01:36:33,415 --> 01:36:37,215
Speaker 13:  that really Yeah. Something that you wanna hear during your run slash walk

1591
01:36:37,215 --> 01:36:40,615
Speaker 13:  slash cycling segment. There's some psychos out there who do love this kind

1592
01:36:40,615 --> 01:36:42,335
Speaker 13:  of granular data. I

1593
01:36:42,335 --> 01:36:46,175
Speaker 6:  Will also say, I think a, a thing that we are quickly learning about AI

1594
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:49,535
Speaker 6:  interactions in general is that that kind of stuff is more meaningful to

1595
01:36:49,535 --> 01:36:53,015
Speaker 6:  more people than I expected. And I, I say that with as little judgment as

1596
01:36:53,215 --> 01:36:56,375
Speaker 6:  possible that like having, having a fake voice in your ear telling you that

1597
01:36:56,375 --> 01:37:00,335
Speaker 6:  you're doing a good job actually means a lot to a lot of people. And

1598
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:03,855
Speaker 6:  I, I am still trying to figure out what to make of that as like a person,

1599
01:37:04,955 --> 01:37:08,775
Speaker 6:  but I think it's true And I think there's something to it. And, and I

1600
01:37:08,775 --> 01:37:11,895
Speaker 6:  also really like the idea of something that would be like just gently rude

1601
01:37:11,895 --> 01:37:14,895
Speaker 6:  to me the whole time. Like what would really work for me is if my Workout

1602
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:18,375
Speaker 6:  Buddy was just like sort of sarcastically be like, oh, great job

1603
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:18,975
Speaker 6:  David.

1604
01:37:19,435 --> 01:37:19,855
Speaker 7:  You're

1605
01:37:20,205 --> 01:37:23,135
Speaker 6:  What a good workout you just did. You ran so fast

1606
01:37:23,305 --> 01:37:26,735
Speaker 7:  After David. I tried to use my iPad as a real computer feature.

1607
01:37:27,025 --> 01:37:29,575
Speaker 7:  We're gonna, we're gonna run. I fell in love with my Workout Buddy.

1608
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:31,535
Speaker 13:  Oh no. Oh

1609
01:37:31,535 --> 01:37:34,295
Speaker 7:  No. Workout Buddy tries to convince David Pierce to leave wife and family.

1610
01:37:35,445 --> 01:37:38,375
Speaker 6:  It's okay. My wife is already successfully mean to me all the time. So it's,

1611
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:38,575
Speaker 6:  it's

1612
01:37:38,795 --> 01:37:42,655
Speaker 7:  No, I know your suggest that a robot tell you to

1613
01:37:42,715 --> 01:37:46,655
Speaker 7:  run faster in that exact personality. I became worried for

1614
01:37:46,655 --> 01:37:46,735
Speaker 7:  you.

1615
01:37:47,435 --> 01:37:48,695
Speaker 6:  Listen, I am who I am,

1616
01:37:49,035 --> 01:37:52,015
Speaker 13:  Eli. This is what it's, I mean, we'll see, I I asked if you could, I asked

1617
01:37:52,015 --> 01:37:55,925
Speaker 13:  if you could like calibrate the Workout Buddy. I didn't

1618
01:37:55,925 --> 01:37:59,485
Speaker 13:  really get a clear answer there, but I think if you could calibrate your

1619
01:37:59,485 --> 01:38:01,245
Speaker 13:  Workout Buddy to be your ideal

1620
01:38:03,005 --> 01:38:06,855
Speaker 13:  companion while you do a workout. Sure. That might help a bunch

1621
01:38:06,855 --> 01:38:07,295
Speaker 13:  of people.

1622
01:38:08,815 --> 01:38:11,135
Speaker 13:  'cause I, I don't know, exercise is, is it only for running of those things?

1623
01:38:11,355 --> 01:38:11,775
Speaker 13:  Is it for

1624
01:38:11,775 --> 01:38:12,375
Speaker 7:  All the workouts?

1625
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:16,255
Speaker 13:  No, no, it's for walks. It's walking. You can have it, I believe

1626
01:38:16,255 --> 01:38:18,895
Speaker 13:  you can do it with cycling. So it's, it's multiple different workout

1627
01:38:18,895 --> 01:38:20,535
Speaker 7:  Types. So all dumb feet exercises?

1628
01:38:21,435 --> 01:38:25,375
Speaker 13:  Yes. All dumb feet cardio exercises. Which, because it

1629
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:29,295
Speaker 13:  makes sense. These are generally solitary activities, right. You can

1630
01:38:29,295 --> 01:38:31,735
Speaker 13:  turn it on and off. It's, it's not like mandatory. Can

1631
01:38:31,735 --> 01:38:34,375
Speaker 7:  You be like, Workout Buddy? I want to get jacked. And then

1632
01:38:35,635 --> 01:38:38,095
Speaker 7:  So just, just cardio, just foot based cardiac,

1633
01:38:38,455 --> 01:38:42,335
Speaker 13:  I think it's just like what I, what I will say is that no very few

1634
01:38:42,485 --> 01:38:46,175
Speaker 13:  apps actually do strength training. Well 'cause it's,

1635
01:38:46,205 --> 01:38:50,135
Speaker 13:  it's just one of those things that is repetitive and boring if

1636
01:38:50,135 --> 01:38:53,655
Speaker 13:  you're doing it well. And also very different

1637
01:38:53,655 --> 01:38:57,455
Speaker 13:  depending on everyone's needs and equipment issues. So, no,

1638
01:38:57,855 --> 01:39:01,815
Speaker 13:  I, I think maybe exactly one app does it well and that's ladder.

1639
01:39:02,315 --> 01:39:05,895
Speaker 13:  But yeah, I don't think strength training is,

1640
01:39:07,205 --> 01:39:10,405
Speaker 13:  I don't even know what a strength training Workout Buddy would be like.

1641
01:39:10,405 --> 01:39:13,685
Speaker 13:  Because what you would want from an AI buddy is prompt cues

1642
01:39:14,425 --> 01:39:17,405
Speaker 13:  or like form check prompt cues. So who, how does it

1643
01:39:18,095 --> 01:39:21,005
Speaker 6:  Doing ears just be like, yo bro, you need a spot? You can

1644
01:39:24,665 --> 01:39:27,885
Speaker 6:  before we, before we move on, anything else in, in watch West 26 do you think

1645
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:28,285
Speaker 6:  is interesting?

1646
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:32,965
Speaker 13:  I, you know, the, the one thing that stood out to me with the Smart stack,

1647
01:39:32,965 --> 01:39:36,725
Speaker 13:  because it is just like a really funny, paradoxical,

1648
01:39:36,915 --> 01:39:40,565
Speaker 13:  paradoxical thing because they're saying that the smart stack is gonna get

1649
01:39:40,595 --> 01:39:43,965
Speaker 13:  even smarter with Apple intelligence so that when you look at the stack,

1650
01:39:44,575 --> 01:39:48,565
Speaker 13:  it'll surface the things that are most useful to you at any given one point

1651
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:51,925
Speaker 13:  in time. And that's such a hard thing to judge because

1652
01:39:52,705 --> 01:39:56,245
Speaker 13:  if it's doing its job really well, you will never notice it.

1653
01:39:56,705 --> 01:40:00,685
Speaker 13:  So that's just like a, I was sitting there going like, how am I gonna test

1654
01:40:00,685 --> 01:40:04,485
Speaker 13:  if this is actually useful to me? I have no idea how I would even notice

1655
01:40:04,485 --> 01:40:08,405
Speaker 13:  it, but maybe that's just how I know it'll be doing its job. So

1656
01:40:08,895 --> 01:40:11,085
Speaker 13:  Smart Stack. Let's see, what

1657
01:40:11,085 --> 01:40:12,725
Speaker 6:  Was the like flippy thing? They

1658
01:40:12,725 --> 01:40:16,525
Speaker 13:  Were like, and now you flip It's new gesture. Okay. Yeah. It's a new

1659
01:40:16,525 --> 01:40:20,485
Speaker 13:  gesture wrist flick. We gotta, we gotta workshop a

1660
01:40:20,485 --> 01:40:24,445
Speaker 13:  new name for this gesture. I like flippy flip is flippy flip,

1661
01:40:24,445 --> 01:40:27,805
Speaker 13:  pinchy pinch, flippy flip. Yeah. So, okay, so in the live blog I was like

1662
01:40:27,805 --> 01:40:29,965
Speaker 13:  twisty twist, but I think I like flippy flip better.

1663
01:40:30,345 --> 01:40:33,125
Speaker 6:  Pinchy pinch and flippy flip. Pinchy pinch and flippy flip. That's good.

1664
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:35,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There we go. Think So. I love it. All right, well problem solved. All

1665
01:40:35,965 --> 01:40:39,645
Speaker 6:  right now TVOS we already did. I will remind you

1666
01:40:39,675 --> 01:40:43,045
Speaker 6:  more notifications, new screensavers, connect to a speaker. The end.

1667
01:40:44,745 --> 01:40:46,925
Speaker 6:  That's, that's it. That's all I got for you. Fully out

1668
01:40:46,925 --> 01:40:49,285
Speaker 7:  Of ideas. No one has any more ideas for TV UIs

1669
01:40:50,675 --> 01:40:53,885
Speaker 6:  Literally they, like, they do the Bento boxes at the end of everyone that

1670
01:40:53,885 --> 01:40:56,845
Speaker 6:  just has a bunch of the features and like half of them were just shows on

1671
01:40:56,845 --> 01:40:59,125
Speaker 6:  Apple TV Plus like, what are we doing?

1672
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:03,405
Speaker 6:  visionOS is the, the last platform we should talk about.

1673
01:41:04,665 --> 01:41:07,085
Speaker 6:  The big thing here I think is widgets. Oh, I was

1674
01:41:07,085 --> 01:41:08,165
Speaker 7:  Gonna say connect to a speaker,

1675
01:41:08,995 --> 01:41:10,645
Speaker 6:  Connect to speaker, question mark.

1676
01:41:13,605 --> 01:41:17,205
Speaker 6:  VII would like you to just briefly convince me as probably the person among

1677
01:41:17,205 --> 01:41:19,325
Speaker 6:  the four of us who have spent the most time in a vision Pro.

1678
01:41:21,145 --> 01:41:21,765
Speaker 13:  Yes. What

1679
01:41:21,765 --> 01:41:23,645
Speaker 6:  An honor the widgets is cool and good.

1680
01:41:25,405 --> 01:41:26,805
Speaker 6:  I will allow you 11 seconds.

1681
01:41:29,635 --> 01:41:29,925
Speaker 13:  Okay.

1682
01:41:31,725 --> 01:41:35,485
Speaker 13:  I guess. Okay, So I guess the one thing is that every single time you have

1683
01:41:35,845 --> 01:41:38,925
Speaker 13:  a, you know what, I, I I can't do it. All right, cool. Widgets, I guess

1684
01:41:38,925 --> 01:41:41,765
Speaker 13:  the widget wall clock. Yay clock. Yeah. The

1685
01:41:41,765 --> 01:41:42,325
Speaker 6:  Widgets are a little

1686
01:41:42,395 --> 01:41:46,165
Speaker 7:  Like augmented reality ish. Like they're not augmented

1687
01:41:46,165 --> 01:41:49,445
Speaker 7:  reality. You know, that's the new term. I just made up

1688
01:41:49,555 --> 01:41:50,965
Speaker 6:  Augmented reality ish. Yeah,

1689
01:41:51,045 --> 01:41:53,885
Speaker 7:  I like that. Like they, they look like they're on the wall, but they're not

1690
01:41:54,085 --> 01:41:57,475
Speaker 7:  actually augmented reality. They're just like, you know what I mean? They're

1691
01:41:57,475 --> 01:41:59,035
Speaker 7:  just like pictures. They don't, yeah.

1692
01:41:59,335 --> 01:41:59,595
Speaker 6:  Do you

1693
01:41:59,675 --> 01:42:02,395
Speaker 7:  Remember that they're not interacting with reality, that they just, they're

1694
01:42:02,395 --> 01:42:03,355
Speaker 7:  just stuck up there, you know? Do

1695
01:42:03,355 --> 01:42:05,435
Speaker 6:  You remember that Facebook event a bunch of years ago where Marcus Zuckerberg

1696
01:42:05,435 --> 01:42:08,915
Speaker 6:  was like, the future is, you're not gonna have a TV on your wall.

1697
01:42:09,055 --> 01:42:12,595
Speaker 6:  You're gonna have an AR tv that you look at through your glasses that you're

1698
01:42:12,595 --> 01:42:15,275
Speaker 6:  gonna like buy for a dollar in the app store and you'll put that on the wall.

1699
01:42:15,275 --> 01:42:18,595
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This, I, I saw this And I was like, oh my God was Mark Zuckerberg,

1700
01:42:18,595 --> 01:42:22,315
Speaker 6:  right? Like, is the future of wall clocks widgets in my Vision Pro,

1701
01:42:22,905 --> 01:42:23,995
Speaker 6:  this is what we're doing here.

1702
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:27,795
Speaker 7:  There's one big vision os feature that we should talk about for just like

1703
01:42:27,795 --> 01:42:31,155
Speaker 7:  half a second. And it is actually the feature they needed to launch with,

1704
01:42:31,685 --> 01:42:35,155
Speaker 7:  which is guest access and like shared support.

1705
01:42:35,735 --> 01:42:39,355
Speaker 7:  So now you can like, let someone else set up a, the Vision OS device for

1706
01:42:39,355 --> 01:42:43,035
Speaker 7:  themselves. They, all of those settings, it's saved to their phone. And then

1707
01:42:43,035 --> 01:42:46,835
Speaker 7:  if they go to any other Vision OS device running what is now called Vision

1708
01:42:47,015 --> 01:42:47,795
Speaker 7:  OS 26,

1709
01:42:48,175 --> 01:42:52,075
Speaker 13:  We just skipped 24, 24 different vision oss

1710
01:42:53,155 --> 01:42:54,195
Speaker 13:  straight to Vision 26.

1711
01:42:54,705 --> 01:42:58,635
Speaker 7:  They can say, I, I've got one. And like, send

1712
01:42:58,635 --> 01:43:01,635
Speaker 7:  the data from their phone to the, the headset and it will just be ready for

1713
01:43:01,635 --> 01:43:05,275
Speaker 7:  them. And they should have had this from the beginning. And what's amazing

1714
01:43:05,275 --> 01:43:09,115
Speaker 7:  about this is that they, they announce this

1715
01:43:09,115 --> 01:43:12,695
Speaker 7:  feature in the context of enterprise use because it's

1716
01:43:12,695 --> 01:43:15,815
Speaker 7:  enterprises who want this feature. Businesses who are like, we have lots

1717
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:18,135
Speaker 7:  of shared headsets that go out in the field. People need to switch between

1718
01:43:18,135 --> 01:43:20,855
Speaker 7:  them all the time. They're not, we're not buying one for everybody, but they,

1719
01:43:20,855 --> 01:43:24,495
Speaker 7:  it's also for consumers. I made sure that it's also for consumers, but you

1720
01:43:24,495 --> 01:43:27,495
Speaker 7:  can see where the action is on the Vision Pro. It's, it's in the enterprise.

1721
01:43:27,805 --> 01:43:31,295
Speaker 6:  It's like fancy architecture firms. I assume that that's what I think of

1722
01:43:31,295 --> 01:43:32,175
Speaker 6:  when I think of the Vision Pro.

1723
01:43:32,525 --> 01:43:36,455
Speaker 13:  This is so funny because I literally just got a text message from our dearly

1724
01:43:36,455 --> 01:43:40,415
Speaker 13:  departed Wes Davis, who is a Vision pro owner with

1725
01:43:40,415 --> 01:43:43,255
Speaker 13:  his own money. And he said, the widgets are good.

1726
01:43:44,075 --> 01:43:44,295
Speaker 7:  So

1727
01:43:44,765 --> 01:43:47,655
Speaker 13:  Whoa. So there you go. But also think of

1728
01:43:47,655 --> 01:43:49,535
Speaker 6:  All the money he's saving on wall clocks. You know what I mean?

1729
01:43:49,925 --> 01:43:53,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. The wall clocks are how you pay for the Vision Pro. If you buy, you

1730
01:43:53,405 --> 01:43:56,245
Speaker 7:  can buy now buy up to 350 fewer wall clocks.

1731
01:43:57,925 --> 01:44:01,285
Speaker 13:  I mean, to be fair, the one of the issues that I've had with the, the Vision

1732
01:44:01,345 --> 01:44:05,325
Speaker 13:  Pro is like, let's say I have all my big screens in the room that I

1733
01:44:05,325 --> 01:44:09,285
Speaker 13:  want, and in the perfect allocation it, I have to kind of

1734
01:44:09,525 --> 01:44:12,765
Speaker 13:  re-put them up every single time I put the headset on, which is annoying.

1735
01:44:12,825 --> 01:44:16,445
Speaker 13:  And the fact that I can remember where things are supposed to go. Now, I,

1736
01:44:16,565 --> 01:44:20,445
Speaker 13:  I do think for the vision, pro power users is a, is a good thing. But what

1737
01:44:20,485 --> 01:44:24,165
Speaker 13:  I am actually most excited about are the persona updates because

1738
01:44:24,405 --> 01:44:28,285
Speaker 13:  I really just want to see how cursed or how

1739
01:44:28,715 --> 01:44:32,645
Speaker 13:  much more or less cursed the new personas are. That got a huge

1740
01:44:32,645 --> 01:44:36,485
Speaker 13:  round of applause from the audience during the, the keynote.

1741
01:44:37,185 --> 01:44:41,125
Speaker 13:  But I really just, as soon as I get home And I get that headset, I'm gonna

1742
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:45,045
Speaker 13:  call Wes and I'm just gonna be like, is your mustache finally capable

1743
01:44:45,465 --> 01:44:46,005
Speaker 13:  of moving?

1744
01:44:46,305 --> 01:44:47,285
Speaker 8:  Is it free? Because

1745
01:44:48,355 --> 01:44:52,205
Speaker 13:  It's, it's, is it, is it finally capable of moving? Can, can your

1746
01:44:52,205 --> 01:44:55,845
Speaker 13:  mouth now move? Yeah. Without your mustache being a

1747
01:44:55,845 --> 01:44:58,965
Speaker 13:  static weird thing. I, I'm excited.

1748
01:44:59,265 --> 01:45:01,605
Speaker 7:  The folks on the ground, there're very excited about the persona updates.

1749
01:45:01,725 --> 01:45:04,205
Speaker 7:  I did not get to see them, but people are very excited about them.

1750
01:45:04,885 --> 01:45:08,805
Speaker 8:  I think even if they're like better, they're worse in a way. Like,

1751
01:45:09,245 --> 01:45:12,885
Speaker 8:  I don't know, what they showed us was like, like

1752
01:45:13,085 --> 01:45:16,605
Speaker 8:  rendered better. It looked more like a person, but it was also

1753
01:45:16,725 --> 01:45:17,285
Speaker 8:  creepier.

1754
01:45:17,585 --> 01:45:20,725
Speaker 7:  Oh, they're deep in the uncanny valley. Also, the demo was two people

1755
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:24,765
Speaker 7:  sitting next to each other on a couch wearing headsets watching a show together

1756
01:45:25,105 --> 01:45:28,645
Speaker 7:  and interacting with their personas, which is just full

1757
01:45:28,685 --> 01:45:31,805
Speaker 7:  dystopia. Like, yeah, that sucks,

1758
01:45:31,805 --> 01:45:32,885
Speaker 8:  Man, that's so weird.

1759
01:45:33,385 --> 01:45:36,645
Speaker 7:  I'm out on that. That's some real, that's $7 worth of equipment

1760
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:40,645
Speaker 8:  So that we don't have to talk to, we have widget wall clocks and then a persona

1761
01:45:40,665 --> 01:45:44,445
Speaker 8:  of your partner that you can look at instead of looking at their own

1762
01:45:44,675 --> 01:45:47,125
Speaker 8:  face. So, okay, got it. Every

1763
01:45:47,275 --> 01:45:50,445
Speaker 7:  Part of the, the Vision Pro from the very beginning has required Apple to

1764
01:45:50,445 --> 01:45:54,325
Speaker 7:  take itself deadly seriously in a way that is incompatible

1765
01:45:54,465 --> 01:45:58,445
Speaker 7:  the reality of people wearing headsets with external battery

1766
01:45:58,455 --> 01:46:02,325
Speaker 7:  packs connected with the water to them. Like, and

1767
01:46:02,705 --> 01:46:05,925
Speaker 7:  it, one of my first briefings with them when they were like talking about

1768
01:46:05,925 --> 01:46:08,445
Speaker 7:  it, I was like, have you guys ever like talked to each other, both wearing

1769
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:12,405
Speaker 7:  headsets with the eyes on, was it funny? And they're like, we don't

1770
01:46:12,405 --> 01:46:15,165
Speaker 7:  laugh at each other's work. And I was like, I don know, people laugh at night

1771
01:46:15,165 --> 01:46:19,045
Speaker 7:  work all the time. Like, whatcha talking? Like it's a workplace. Like

1772
01:46:19,435 --> 01:46:23,365
Speaker 7:  have you seen The Office? Like I didn't talk. The culture of laughing

1773
01:46:23,365 --> 01:46:27,005
Speaker 7:  at each other at work is like well established, but like the Vision Pro

1774
01:46:27,315 --> 01:46:31,125
Speaker 7:  rejects that as, as a product because it's so inherently silly.

1775
01:46:31,415 --> 01:46:35,325
Speaker 7:  Apple has to take it deadly seriously and be like, yes, two people will sit

1776
01:46:35,565 --> 01:46:39,205
Speaker 7:  together on a couch wearing their vision pros watching a show together and

1777
01:46:39,385 --> 01:46:42,975
Speaker 7:  con conducting business in their personas. And you're like, good luck.

1778
01:46:43,615 --> 01:46:45,935
Speaker 7:  Like sure. Yeah.

1779
01:46:47,395 --> 01:46:51,205
Speaker 13:  Oh my god. Wes just tried to FaceTime me from his

1780
01:46:51,205 --> 01:46:55,165
Speaker 13:  vision pro. Oh God. He's, he's, oh no, he, he's so excited. Anyway,

1781
01:46:55,365 --> 01:46:57,885
Speaker 6:  You're gonna have to report back. Yeah, this is gonna be great. All right.

1782
01:46:57,895 --> 01:47:01,685
Speaker 6:  Bunch more things then we're gonna get outta here. We talked a little bit

1783
01:47:01,685 --> 01:47:05,605
Speaker 6:  about the AirPods camera control thing. I missed this part of

1784
01:47:05,705 --> 01:47:09,405
Speaker 6:  the keynote. Did we get a sense of how you take the picture with your

1785
01:47:09,475 --> 01:47:12,475
Speaker 6:  AirPods? No, nothing. No, I

1786
01:47:12,475 --> 01:47:15,475
Speaker 7:  Missed it. No, this is more creator stuff where it's like you can start the

1787
01:47:15,475 --> 01:47:18,955
Speaker 7:  capture by clicking your AirPod and then again immediately begin talking

1788
01:47:18,975 --> 01:47:22,755
Speaker 7:  to camera. So I think we, when we were talking about it last, we were thinking

1789
01:47:22,755 --> 01:47:25,955
Speaker 7:  about it because we're old dads about like taking the group photo at the

1790
01:47:26,075 --> 01:47:29,235
Speaker 7:  Grand Canyon. And what they were talking about is a bunch of Zoomers who

1791
01:47:29,235 --> 01:47:29,795
Speaker 7:  are like, Hey guys,

1792
01:47:30,455 --> 01:47:34,195
Speaker 6:  How to start the TikTok video. Right? Yeah. Okay. It

1793
01:47:34,195 --> 01:47:38,115
Speaker 6:  also, they introduced studio quality recording for the AirPods, which I

1794
01:47:38,115 --> 01:47:41,835
Speaker 6:  will just say as someone who makes a podcast on which we use AirPods, you're

1795
01:47:41,835 --> 01:47:43,035
Speaker 6:  lying. And I don't believe you

1796
01:47:43,695 --> 01:47:46,595
Speaker 7:  By the way, the, the claim there wasn't even what you would expect the claim

1797
01:47:46,615 --> 01:47:46,915
Speaker 7:  to be

1798
01:47:48,565 --> 01:47:51,345
Speaker 7:  you. 'cause if they had just been like, here's what we're gonna do. We're

1799
01:47:51,345 --> 01:47:53,705
Speaker 7:  gonna take your AirPods audio, we're gonna ai the shit out of 'em and make

1800
01:47:53,825 --> 01:47:56,265
Speaker 7:  'em sound good, you'd be like, all right, that's gonna be weird. Yeah, there

1801
01:47:56,265 --> 01:47:59,265
Speaker 7:  might be some artifacts or like whatever, we will like check it out. But

1802
01:47:59,265 --> 01:48:02,065
Speaker 7:  they were just like, no, we've just made AirPods Suji quality. It's like,

1803
01:48:03,055 --> 01:48:03,275
Speaker 7:  how,

1804
01:48:06,575 --> 01:48:09,035
Speaker 7:  why did you do that the first time? Did you turn up the base slider? Like,

1805
01:48:09,065 --> 01:48:09,755
Speaker 7:  what did you do?

1806
01:48:11,855 --> 01:48:13,505
Speaker 6:  Yeah, they just magically sound better though.

1807
01:48:13,505 --> 01:48:17,225
Speaker 7:  They, they got one of those like 1980s, like 24 band parametric

1808
01:48:17,605 --> 01:48:21,265
Speaker 7:  EQs and just like turned up at the whole right side. Like how

1809
01:48:22,285 --> 01:48:23,225
Speaker 7:  not unclear.

1810
01:48:24,295 --> 01:48:28,005
Speaker 6:  Don't believe you. All right, next one. There's the new games

1811
01:48:28,145 --> 01:48:31,965
Speaker 6:  app, which they, they kind of skimmed past in a way. I was a little surprised

1812
01:48:31,965 --> 01:48:35,525
Speaker 6:  by. We expected there to be a lot of noise about like Apple's, you know,

1813
01:48:35,545 --> 01:48:39,005
Speaker 6:  annual huge play into gaming. And this kind of was that, but

1814
01:48:39,805 --> 01:48:43,725
Speaker 6:  I don't know, I didn't get the sense that this was a huge

1815
01:48:44,185 --> 01:48:47,565
Speaker 6:  new initiative from Apple to try and make gaming work so much as it is just

1816
01:48:47,565 --> 01:48:49,205
Speaker 6:  like a place to find all the games you have on saw.

1817
01:48:49,395 --> 01:48:53,125
Speaker 7:  Well, so there's a, John Gerber posted his read on this, which

1818
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:56,845
Speaker 7:  lightly tracks with mine, which is they are making the

1819
01:48:56,845 --> 01:49:00,285
Speaker 7:  games app like a separate app store and app

1820
01:49:00,285 --> 01:49:04,245
Speaker 7:  experience so that eventually when the regulators come for app

1821
01:49:04,245 --> 01:49:07,245
Speaker 7:  store fees, they can be like game, we're gonna treat games differently and

1822
01:49:07,245 --> 01:49:10,245
Speaker 7:  all the other apps differently. 'cause we make all our money Candy

1823
01:49:10,245 --> 01:49:13,245
Speaker 6:  Crush Whale. 'cause they compete with Xbox and PlayStation and Yeah.

1824
01:49:13,385 --> 01:49:17,285
Speaker 7:  And those all the same fees. And they made this tiny distinction in the keynote.

1825
01:49:17,465 --> 01:49:21,365
Speaker 7:  It was, it went by in a flash, but they made a distinction between app store

1826
01:49:21,365 --> 01:49:22,645
Speaker 7:  games and Apple Arcade games.

1827
01:49:23,945 --> 01:49:24,445
Speaker 6:  Oh, interesting.

1828
01:49:24,505 --> 01:49:27,645
Speaker 7:  So even games from the App store versus Apple Arcade games and it's like,

1829
01:49:27,645 --> 01:49:30,805
Speaker 7:  oh, you think, you think about these differently. Which kinda makes sense.

1830
01:49:30,925 --> 01:49:33,165
Speaker 7:  'cause Apple Arcade games are another subscription and all this other stuff,

1831
01:49:33,305 --> 01:49:37,125
Speaker 7:  but they're just the, the first hints that they're, they're

1832
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:38,485
Speaker 7:  peeling things apart.

1833
01:49:39,195 --> 01:49:41,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Interesting. Okay.

1834
01:49:42,665 --> 01:49:44,565
Speaker 6:  The tabs came back to the Photos app

1835
01:49:45,765 --> 01:49:49,445
Speaker 7:  Announce, by the way, joy Streets of the internet, Craig, it was like many

1836
01:49:49,445 --> 01:49:50,685
Speaker 7:  of you enjoyed tabs in the old

1837
01:49:52,465 --> 01:49:56,365
Speaker 13:  I'm just the, the Satan Elmo G where he's just like, the

1838
01:49:56,375 --> 01:50:00,365
Speaker 13:  fires behind him and the arms are up. That's, I just, I really hated how

1839
01:50:00,365 --> 01:50:04,045
Speaker 13:  they changed the Photos app. So thank God. Yes.

1840
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:08,045
Speaker 13:  Many people enjoy tabs. I am one of them and I'm happy,

1841
01:50:08,695 --> 01:50:12,445
Speaker 13:  happy. I won't, we'll see. I I I think I'll be happy with it. So,

1842
01:50:12,625 --> 01:50:16,085
Speaker 13:  yay. We enjoyed knowing how to look for the thing we're looking for.

1843
01:50:18,775 --> 01:50:22,755
Speaker 6:  Man, I don't, this, this whole backlash has made me absolutely convinced

1844
01:50:22,755 --> 01:50:26,555
Speaker 6:  that I'm using photos wrong because I opened the

1845
01:50:26,555 --> 01:50:30,035
Speaker 6:  app, it showed me all my photos and that was fine. And now,

1846
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:33,915
Speaker 6:  now I open the app and it shows me all my photos and it's still fine. So

1847
01:50:33,915 --> 01:50:36,675
Speaker 6:  like, I'm, I'm doing it wrong and we'll, we'll figure this out together,

1848
01:50:36,955 --> 01:50:40,805
Speaker 6:  I think. But I, I'm, I'm lost. All right. We're almost

1849
01:50:40,805 --> 01:50:44,445
Speaker 6:  done here. Apple Maps will now learn the

1850
01:50:44,505 --> 01:50:48,365
Speaker 6:  routes you take on your commute and such. And we will try to

1851
01:50:48,365 --> 01:50:51,125
Speaker 6:  automatically help you with them when, like, if you're gonna hit traffic

1852
01:50:51,185 --> 01:50:54,565
Speaker 6:  you don't know about, even if you don't plug in the directions, it will try

1853
01:50:54,565 --> 01:50:57,485
Speaker 6:  to alert you to take a different route. I think that's very cool. I also

1854
01:50:57,485 --> 01:51:01,125
Speaker 6:  don't use Apple Maps for anything ever. So here we are.

1855
01:51:01,265 --> 01:51:04,845
Speaker 7:  The one place Apple Maps is absolutely superior to Google Maps

1856
01:51:05,065 --> 01:51:08,965
Speaker 7:  is the state of New Jersey. And if they could just get Apple Intelligence

1857
01:51:09,545 --> 01:51:12,925
Speaker 7:  to force me to use Apple Maps when I travel to New Jersey,

1858
01:51:14,105 --> 01:51:15,525
Speaker 7:  I'd be, that's all it's for. I

1859
01:51:16,245 --> 01:51:17,405
Speaker 13:  I live in New Jersey,

1860
01:51:17,825 --> 01:51:18,605
Speaker 7:  I'm sorry, against

1861
01:51:18,625 --> 01:51:22,525
Speaker 13:  My will, but I don't think that Apple Maps is good in

1862
01:51:22,525 --> 01:51:22,925
Speaker 13:  New Jersey.

1863
01:51:23,155 --> 01:51:25,165
Speaker 7:  It's, no, it's good. I have, I have one specific way, I have lot of thoughts.

1864
01:51:25,265 --> 01:51:27,285
Speaker 7:  I'm just, I'm just putting this out there. It's good. In one specific way

1865
01:51:27,285 --> 01:51:31,205
Speaker 7:  Google could catch up tomorrow. Driving New Jersey is

1866
01:51:31,245 --> 01:51:34,965
Speaker 7:  a series of like nonstop events. Yes. Right. You're

1867
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:37,965
Speaker 7:  merge on this highway, immediately change five lanes to merge onto another

1868
01:51:37,965 --> 01:51:41,205
Speaker 7:  highway, then another highway, then another highway, then 15th Highway. We've

1869
01:51:41,205 --> 01:51:45,085
Speaker 7:  named this place the Garden State for some unbelievable reason. But

1870
01:51:45,085 --> 01:51:48,525
Speaker 7:  this is the experience of being here. And Google Maps just does not

1871
01:51:48,755 --> 01:51:52,365
Speaker 7:  acknowledge that every action will be followed by a series of

1872
01:51:52,375 --> 01:51:54,045
Speaker 7:  45 other actions

1873
01:51:54,265 --> 01:51:58,125
Speaker 6:  Two seconds later. Yeah. Google is always like, turn in a hundred feet

1874
01:51:58,265 --> 01:52:01,165
Speaker 6:  and then you turn and then it's like, oh, 75 feet ago you were supposed to

1875
01:52:01,165 --> 01:52:01,845
Speaker 6:  turn again. That's

1876
01:52:01,845 --> 01:52:05,165
Speaker 7:  A cool thing. And so Apple Maps, at least Apple Maps is like this. Some things

1877
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:08,885
Speaker 7:  are gonna happen to you and you're gonna get through them together as a family.

1878
01:52:09,025 --> 01:52:12,525
Speaker 7:  And it's like, this still sucks. Mm. I still hate it.

1879
01:52:13,175 --> 01:52:16,405
Speaker 7:  Sorry. So like, every time I've ever driven New Jersey, my wife and I have

1880
01:52:16,405 --> 01:52:19,645
Speaker 7:  gotten into a fight and Apple Maps has reduced the fights like by

1881
01:52:19,945 --> 01:52:20,605
Speaker 7:  10%.

1882
01:52:20,795 --> 01:52:24,485
Speaker 13:  This is, this is fa this is fascinating data because

1883
01:52:24,915 --> 01:52:28,845
Speaker 13:  obviously my spouse And I drive in New Jersey all the time and

1884
01:52:29,275 --> 01:52:33,045
Speaker 13:  they switch between Apple Maps and Google Maps

1885
01:52:33,225 --> 01:52:33,445
Speaker 13:  and

1886
01:52:35,725 --> 01:52:39,695
Speaker 13:  it's, it's a lot. The only thing I think actually

1887
01:52:39,705 --> 01:52:43,575
Speaker 13:  Apple Maps has over Google Maps is that if you have an

1888
01:52:43,575 --> 01:52:46,845
Speaker 13:  Apple watch, it'll like, if you have to cues for when you're supposed to

1889
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:50,245
Speaker 13:  take the next action. So yes, in that sense it is superior,

1890
01:52:50,295 --> 01:52:54,005
Speaker 13:  especially in Jersey where there is a right lane exit every

1891
01:52:54,075 --> 01:52:57,805
Speaker 13:  five seconds. And you have to know the difference between this

1892
01:52:57,805 --> 01:53:01,685
Speaker 13:  right lane exit versus the one right before driving in jersey's just a

1893
01:53:01,995 --> 01:53:03,045
Speaker 13:  shit show, Joe. You

1894
01:53:03,045 --> 01:53:06,645
Speaker 7:  See what I'm saying? And so if Apple could use its trillions of dollars

1895
01:53:07,145 --> 01:53:11,045
Speaker 7:  and its data centers and its intelligence to somehow improve this,

1896
01:53:11,685 --> 01:53:14,485
Speaker 7:  I think, I think they would take massive share in one state in the union

1897
01:53:14,485 --> 01:53:16,405
Speaker 7:  from Google. That's all I'm saying.

1898
01:53:17,765 --> 01:53:21,725
Speaker 8:  I have a very v specific question when it's doing that haptic thing

1899
01:53:21,725 --> 01:53:25,085
Speaker 8:  on your wrist and it's like tapping you, is there different

1900
01:53:25,835 --> 01:53:29,205
Speaker 8:  taps for the direction you're supposed to turn? It like freaks me out a little

1901
01:53:29,205 --> 01:53:32,845
Speaker 8:  bit. I'm like, ah, is is this supposed to be telling me like turn left or

1902
01:53:32,845 --> 01:53:33,605
Speaker 8:  turn right? Like

1903
01:53:34,205 --> 01:53:38,085
Speaker 13:  I don't use Apple Maps when I drive the, the, the

1904
01:53:38,085 --> 01:53:41,925
Speaker 13:  spouse does because they swear it will reduce the number of

1905
01:53:41,925 --> 01:53:45,245
Speaker 13:  times that they miss the exit. Which,

1906
01:53:45,865 --> 01:53:48,605
Speaker 13:  you know, this is getting too much into my marriage. But I think if they

1907
01:53:48,605 --> 01:53:52,325
Speaker 13:  just turned on the audio cues, they would miss 20%

1908
01:53:52,325 --> 01:53:52,925
Speaker 13:  fewer returns.

1909
01:53:53,105 --> 01:53:53,845
Speaker 8:  Oh well you're right

1910
01:53:54,055 --> 01:53:54,405
Speaker 13:  Buddy.

1911
01:53:54,545 --> 01:53:54,765
Speaker 7:  But

1912
01:53:54,765 --> 01:53:55,605
Speaker 13:  For driving they insist.

1913
01:53:55,985 --> 01:53:57,685
Speaker 6:  You are also in my driving buddy.

1914
01:53:58,635 --> 01:54:00,845
Speaker 13:  This buddy actually.

1915
01:54:01,345 --> 01:54:03,805
Speaker 7:  And every time you get the turn right it's like you did great.

1916
01:54:04,265 --> 01:54:05,165
Speaker 6:  You so good.

1917
01:54:05,225 --> 01:54:05,445
Speaker 8:  Yes.

1918
01:54:05,955 --> 01:54:07,365
Speaker 13:  Yeah. You know what? Didn't

1919
01:54:07,525 --> 01:54:07,765
Speaker 6:  A personal

1920
01:54:07,765 --> 01:54:09,885
Speaker 13:  Record didn't work. Workout Buddy. We need a driving buddy. Driving buddy.

1921
01:54:09,885 --> 01:54:13,205
Speaker 13:  Just for your jersey specifically for marriages in Jersey. Just anybody

1922
01:54:13,425 --> 01:54:16,485
Speaker 13:  in a marriage in Jersey trying to get somewhere on time.

1923
01:54:17,465 --> 01:54:18,525
Speaker 13:  You need driving buddy?

1924
01:54:19,045 --> 01:54:22,845
Speaker 7:  I can feel David like knowing that this podcast needs to wrap up. 'cause

1925
01:54:22,885 --> 01:54:26,725
Speaker 7:  V And I are just complaining about New Jersey now, but that's it's

1926
01:54:26,725 --> 01:54:30,565
Speaker 6:  Day. It was, the show ended like a half hour ago. Yeah. No, it's,

1927
01:54:30,645 --> 01:54:34,485
Speaker 6:  I this is, this is, I'm learning a lot about why I need to just

1928
01:54:34,485 --> 01:54:37,925
Speaker 6:  switch to ways is the thing that I'm taking away from all of this. Waze just

1929
01:54:37,925 --> 01:54:39,885
Speaker 6:  has me drive through neighborhoods and everything goes fine.

1930
01:54:42,545 --> 01:54:46,285
Speaker 6:  The, there was some new stuff for like digital IDs in Apple Wallet,

1931
01:54:46,285 --> 01:54:48,725
Speaker 6:  which I bring up only so that Neli can remind people.

1932
01:54:49,255 --> 01:54:51,445
Speaker 7:  Never, never hand your phone to a cop. Don't do it.

1933
01:54:51,445 --> 01:54:55,285
Speaker 6:  There you go. That's a good one. I also have another one

1934
01:54:55,305 --> 01:54:59,205
Speaker 6:  for our good friend Neli Patel. We got some CarPlay updates. Are you so

1935
01:54:59,205 --> 01:55:02,685
Speaker 6:  excited about CarPlay the car? Neli Patel, America's number one lover of

1936
01:55:02,685 --> 01:55:04,965
Speaker 6:  CarPlay. Do you have any thoughts?

1937
01:55:06,205 --> 01:55:09,765
Speaker 7:  I I've asked Apple to, you know, send me home with an Aston Martin

1938
01:55:11,465 --> 01:55:12,245
Speaker 6:  For journalism.

1939
01:55:12,665 --> 01:55:16,125
Speaker 7:  So far they haven't said no. I would not say

1940
01:55:16,475 --> 01:55:20,085
Speaker 7:  that they've said yes, but we're in a liminal place

1941
01:55:20,415 --> 01:55:21,805
Speaker 7:  where, you know, hope is alive.

1942
01:55:22,275 --> 01:55:23,725
Speaker 6:  Schrodinger's Aston Martin

1943
01:55:25,475 --> 01:55:28,645
Speaker 7:  CarPlay Ultra is its own beast. And I, I don't know what's gonna happen there.

1944
01:55:29,475 --> 01:55:33,445
Speaker 7:  It's by the way, Jeep Stellantis, the company owns Jeep broke its

1945
01:55:33,685 --> 01:55:37,205
Speaker 7:  software relationship with Amazon a couple weeks ago. And of all of the companies

1946
01:55:37,205 --> 01:55:40,685
Speaker 7:  that should like, screw it, like just glue an iPhone to your dashboard,

1947
01:55:41,355 --> 01:55:44,645
Speaker 7:  call it a day. Like they should just do it. Most of the other car companies

1948
01:55:44,645 --> 01:55:48,365
Speaker 7:  are still like in a real wait and see the, but the CarPlay updates,

1949
01:55:49,115 --> 01:55:52,125
Speaker 7:  they're, they're fine, they're good. You get tap back emojis. Like mostly

1950
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:54,805
Speaker 7:  what you should send is a response to a text message while you're driving

1951
01:55:54,905 --> 01:55:55,685
Speaker 7:  is a thumbs up.

1952
01:55:56,225 --> 01:55:56,445
Speaker 6:  Yes.

1953
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:59,645
Speaker 7:  If they made that easier, that's great, right? To just emoji respond to text

1954
01:56:00,105 --> 01:56:03,445
Speaker 7:  so you're not like talking and you know, screwing on a serial, all that stuff.

1955
01:56:04,505 --> 01:56:08,445
Speaker 7:  But it's, it's, it's never been more clear that CarPlay is just a

1956
01:56:08,445 --> 01:56:12,405
Speaker 7:  second monitor for your phone than looking at the set of updates. 'cause

1957
01:56:12,405 --> 01:56:15,165
Speaker 7:  they're just like, it, we changed how the phone looks. So CarPlay looks different

1958
01:56:15,165 --> 01:56:19,085
Speaker 7:  now. Like we've made some widgets move around, added some features. They're

1959
01:56:19,085 --> 01:56:22,525
Speaker 7:  like, oh, this is just a second monitor for your iPhone running on your car

1960
01:56:22,525 --> 01:56:26,485
Speaker 7:  display. And like that's what it is and it's what it should be. And I think

1961
01:56:26,485 --> 01:56:30,445
Speaker 7:  people are generally happy with that. But this the

1962
01:56:30,475 --> 01:56:34,285
Speaker 7:  fact that CarPlay Ultra is over there and it's like we've, we've added

1963
01:56:34,285 --> 01:56:37,205
Speaker 7:  the climate controls to it has never seemed less important.

1964
01:56:38,335 --> 01:56:41,185
Speaker 7:  Like it just doesn't matter. Like what you want is a second monitor for your

1965
01:56:41,185 --> 01:56:45,025
Speaker 7:  phone running in your car display. And I, it it is more of that than it has

1966
01:56:45,025 --> 01:56:48,625
Speaker 7:  ever been before. I'm hoping to go home with an Aston Martin and Apple if

1967
01:56:48,625 --> 01:56:52,505
Speaker 7:  you want to convince me otherwise I'm, you know, black is great. I will accept

1968
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:52,705
Speaker 7:  silver.

1969
01:56:53,395 --> 01:56:56,745
Speaker 6:  We've been looking for a reason to do The Vergecast Road trip and I'm just

1970
01:56:56,745 --> 01:56:59,945
Speaker 6:  saying that the Aston Martin with CarPlay Ultra is, is the solution to all

1971
01:56:59,945 --> 01:57:00,465
Speaker 6:  our problems. Yeah,

1972
01:57:00,525 --> 01:57:03,225
Speaker 7:  The whole, we have an ethics policy. I can't actually accept the Aston Martin.

1973
01:57:03,805 --> 01:57:05,825
Speaker 7:  You understand what it's, it's a joke. We

1974
01:57:05,825 --> 01:57:09,625
Speaker 6:  Can't have it forever. But you can long-term loans exist. That's what

1975
01:57:09,625 --> 01:57:12,545
Speaker 13:  You're saying. There are review units of cars, so

1976
01:57:12,885 --> 01:57:16,875
Speaker 7:  That's true. I know that people, I know that the review, there's like a

1977
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:20,315
Speaker 7:  review warehouse in in the Northeast. I'm friendly with them. But

1978
01:57:20,315 --> 01:57:22,875
Speaker 6:  If you think about it, like you have to drive it long enough that you're

1979
01:57:22,875 --> 01:57:26,835
Speaker 6:  no longer amazed by the novelty of an Aston. And that's like at least a year

1980
01:57:27,435 --> 01:57:31,395
Speaker 6:  before you can even really properly review CarPlay Ultra. Yeah. As, as

1981
01:57:31,675 --> 01:57:35,195
Speaker 6:  software divorced from the existence of the Aston. So it's it's gonna be

1982
01:57:35,195 --> 01:57:37,755
Speaker 6:  fine. We're gonna make this work for you. All right. We need to get outta

1983
01:57:37,755 --> 01:57:40,955
Speaker 6:  here, but I I do just want to just check in one last time y'all were there,

1984
01:57:41,995 --> 01:57:44,385
Speaker 6:  y'all, y'all have been through all this. We've talked through a lot of the

1985
01:57:44,385 --> 01:57:45,305
Speaker 6:  news. There was a lot of stuff.

1986
01:57:46,875 --> 01:57:50,455
Speaker 6:  My sort of overall takeaway is that like if it, if it wasn't in the shadow

1987
01:57:50,455 --> 01:57:54,135
Speaker 6:  of last year and it wasn't in the shadow of sort of everything else

1988
01:57:54,155 --> 01:57:57,535
Speaker 6:  that's been going on with Apple that like from a pure,

1989
01:57:57,755 --> 01:58:01,245
Speaker 6:  here's the new stuff coming to your devices world,

1990
01:58:02,235 --> 01:58:05,365
Speaker 6:  this was like a fine wwdc.

1991
01:58:05,955 --> 01:58:09,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Not, not the greatest we've ever seen. Not bad. And, and what

1992
01:58:09,815 --> 01:58:13,605
Speaker 6:  makes all of it weird is all of the other stuff happening around Apple,

1993
01:58:14,015 --> 01:58:16,845
Speaker 6:  which is really unusual for Apple, which is a company that has like lived

1994
01:58:16,845 --> 01:58:20,365
Speaker 6:  in its own bubble for as long as we've all been doing this. Was that your

1995
01:58:20,365 --> 01:58:23,885
Speaker 6:  read too? Like good not great. Your phone's probably gonna be fine

1996
01:58:24,115 --> 01:58:26,285
Speaker 6:  once they walk back. All the Liquid Glass ness.

1997
01:58:27,595 --> 01:58:31,445
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Is that like a, like a off year where you are

1998
01:58:31,445 --> 01:58:34,685
Speaker 13:  just going, you're following up Vision Pro, you're following up Apple Intelligence

1999
01:58:34,705 --> 01:58:38,565
Speaker 13:  and now it's this stuff that's just kind of how it

2000
01:58:38,565 --> 01:58:39,125
Speaker 13:  felt like

2001
01:58:39,625 --> 01:58:43,525
Speaker 6:  The big three. Yeah. Vision Pro bad

2002
01:58:43,635 --> 01:58:47,285
Speaker 6:  Siri, windows Vista is the, the true legacy of that. I don Moist Vista.

2003
01:58:47,935 --> 01:58:49,205
Speaker 6:  Moist Vista. No

2004
01:58:49,415 --> 01:58:49,765
Speaker 7:  Gross.

2005
01:58:52,255 --> 01:58:54,405
Speaker 7:  Moist Vista is not a great, I

2006
01:58:54,405 --> 01:58:57,325
Speaker 6:  Feel I don we will not be making that t-shirt. I can tell you that. Really

2007
01:58:57,325 --> 01:58:59,245
Speaker 7:  Unhappy that I'm actually, the more I think about it,

2008
01:59:01,535 --> 01:59:04,655
Speaker 7:  I think, I don't think you can ignore the other stuff. The rest of this industry

2009
01:59:05,275 --> 01:59:08,855
Speaker 7:  is chasing an uncertain technology that might not

2010
01:59:09,195 --> 01:59:13,035
Speaker 7:  be the future. It just might not be, but which

2011
01:59:13,035 --> 01:59:16,875
Speaker 7:  has a lot of capabilities towards like an entire new

2012
01:59:17,165 --> 01:59:20,915
Speaker 7:  model of applications. That's just a thing that's happening out there.

2013
01:59:21,585 --> 01:59:24,915
Speaker 7:  Like Sundar Hai coming under coder. I mean like the web is a series of databases

2014
01:59:24,935 --> 01:59:28,875
Speaker 7:  and like my agents can just go ping the databases and Kevin Scott from

2015
01:59:29,995 --> 01:59:32,555
Speaker 7:  Microsoft coming on and being like MCP is the future And I can re-architect

2016
01:59:32,555 --> 01:59:36,515
Speaker 7:  the Open web based on these new protocols and the kids on TikTok using

2017
01:59:36,675 --> 01:59:40,075
Speaker 7:  NAN to make new automations out of all these tools. Like there's something

2018
01:59:40,435 --> 01:59:44,275
Speaker 7:  actually happening there. Like some big thing is actually

2019
01:59:44,275 --> 01:59:47,875
Speaker 7:  happening there and all of the app action And we like app

2020
01:59:47,875 --> 01:59:51,835
Speaker 7:  development right now is happening with those kinds of tools

2021
01:59:52,825 --> 01:59:56,765
Speaker 7:  on the web in like really weird ways. It might come to

2022
01:59:56,765 --> 02:00:00,525
Speaker 7:  nothing. And I think Apple's point of view is like we

2023
02:00:00,525 --> 02:00:01,685
Speaker 7:  don't do, comes to nothing

2024
02:00:03,215 --> 02:00:06,105
Speaker 7:  like they're like, we make great products. When they're finished, we ship

2025
02:00:06,105 --> 02:00:08,625
Speaker 7:  them except for the fact that like

2026
02:00:10,145 --> 02:00:13,445
Speaker 7:  for, you know, over a decade now, all of the hottest apps have launched on

2027
02:00:13,445 --> 02:00:17,405
Speaker 7:  the phone and that at a developer's conference, what you

2028
02:00:17,405 --> 02:00:21,125
Speaker 7:  want is lots of new reasons to make cool apps on the phone.

2029
02:00:21,665 --> 02:00:25,285
Speaker 7:  And Yeah, I I don know there's just a gap there that is like worth

2030
02:00:25,775 --> 02:00:29,655
Speaker 7:  thinking about longer than it was just fi like yeah, they just did, they

2031
02:00:29,655 --> 02:00:31,655
Speaker 7:  revved all the stuff. Here's all the stuff they worked on for the last year

2032
02:00:31,655 --> 02:00:35,535
Speaker 7:  here. It's, but last year they're like, Siri will be

2033
02:00:35,535 --> 02:00:39,135
Speaker 7:  your best friend. Right? And they, they haven't shipped it yet. And

2034
02:00:39,135 --> 02:00:42,855
Speaker 7:  meanwhile like, you know, coming off of io you know, like here's Google

2035
02:00:42,855 --> 02:00:45,815
Speaker 7:  being like, here's all these new ways to think about using your computer

2036
02:00:46,475 --> 02:00:50,055
Speaker 7:  all like, and it's a bunch of Google stuff. Something will just come to nothing.

2037
02:00:50,895 --> 02:00:54,855
Speaker 7:  Project Mariner were they run Chrome in the cloud and click around the web

2038
02:00:54,855 --> 02:00:58,655
Speaker 7:  for you. Like, ooh, I don, I don't know man, but like,

2039
02:00:58,655 --> 02:01:02,255
Speaker 7:  there's just all these shots at what are new ways of using

2040
02:01:02,535 --> 02:01:06,495
Speaker 7:  computers that are taking place, including Johnny. Ive going to go work on

2041
02:01:06,495 --> 02:01:10,455
Speaker 7:  new devices at OpenAI. Like all that stuff is happening. People see a

2042
02:01:10,455 --> 02:01:13,975
Speaker 7:  way around the next turn. I don't know, like, I don't know if LMS are the

2043
02:01:13,975 --> 02:01:17,895
Speaker 7:  way through it, I really don't. But Apple just being like, yeah, we're, we're

2044
02:01:17,895 --> 02:01:20,975
Speaker 7:  we're taking a beat. It's just kind of off. Like there's something there

2045
02:01:21,005 --> 02:01:24,825
Speaker 7:  that, I don't know how anybody makes the next great device,

2046
02:01:25,645 --> 02:01:28,625
Speaker 7:  but everyone else is taking shots at it and Apple's like, no, no, the phone

2047
02:01:28,625 --> 02:01:29,025
Speaker 7:  will win.

2048
02:01:29,735 --> 02:01:32,855
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's weird. Like this, this part of the reason I ask this question

2049
02:01:32,855 --> 02:01:36,815
Speaker 6:  is that Apple is sort of, it felt like a return to like

2050
02:01:37,595 --> 02:01:40,625
Speaker 6:  pre pandemic Apple WWCs

2051
02:01:41,485 --> 02:01:44,985
Speaker 6:  and Apple is the only company left on this particular

2052
02:01:45,245 --> 02:01:49,225
Speaker 6:  island. Yeah. Like it, it is so unlike every other conversation we're

2053
02:01:49,225 --> 02:01:51,865
Speaker 6:  having about technology. Allison, what was your read?

2054
02:01:52,545 --> 02:01:56,425
Speaker 8:  I, it just kind of like, I understand why Apple

2055
02:01:56,565 --> 02:02:00,385
Speaker 8:  had to jump in AI last year and like

2056
02:02:00,385 --> 02:02:04,065
Speaker 8:  make the big Apple intelligence announcement, but it, it does feel

2057
02:02:04,065 --> 02:02:08,025
Speaker 8:  backwards now that I think about it of like, if this had been

2058
02:02:08,565 --> 02:02:12,545
Speaker 8:  our kind of first step into like, you know, it's not just machine

2059
02:02:12,705 --> 02:02:16,425
Speaker 8:  learning, it's intelligence and it's gonna do these things for you and you're

2060
02:02:16,425 --> 02:02:19,465
Speaker 8:  gonna take a screenshot and it's gonna put it on your calendar and be like,

2061
02:02:19,465 --> 02:02:23,145
Speaker 8:  great, I'm on board. You know, and then work up to the

2062
02:02:23,605 --> 02:02:27,545
Speaker 8:  series, your best friend stuff. It, it, it couldn't be that

2063
02:02:27,545 --> 02:02:31,425
Speaker 8:  way, you know? And Google has shipped a ton of stuff that

2064
02:02:32,245 --> 02:02:35,945
Speaker 8:  is in the Gemini is your best friend track.

2065
02:02:37,085 --> 02:02:40,465
Speaker 8:  So I, it's just a weird kind of a, a

2066
02:02:41,165 --> 02:02:44,745
Speaker 8:  no win position for Apple, I guess. But

2067
02:02:45,895 --> 02:02:49,865
Speaker 8:  some, some interesting stuff I'm like excited to play with. I think.

2068
02:02:50,455 --> 02:02:54,345
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I like we, the idea that Gemini is going to win the

2069
02:02:54,345 --> 02:02:57,225
Speaker 6:  race to be your best friend is a deeply terrifying state of affairs.

2070
02:02:58,805 --> 02:03:02,665
Speaker 6:  But it, like you, you might not be wrong. Alright. You guys have

2071
02:03:02,665 --> 02:03:06,345
Speaker 6:  been sitting here with me long enough. You need to go do other things in

2072
02:03:06,345 --> 02:03:09,705
Speaker 6:  Cupertino. I think you're gonna see the F1 movie. This is, this is the thing

2073
02:03:09,705 --> 02:03:12,745
Speaker 6:  that's gonna happen. It's the rumor. This is not today. This is, this is

2074
02:03:12,745 --> 02:03:16,425
Speaker 6:  what they say. Yeah. Alright. Thank you all for being here. Safe travels

02:03:31,145 --> 02:03:35,065
Speaker 6:  add them to my own shortcuts and use them every single day. Until
