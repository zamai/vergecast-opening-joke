Description: Some products are so successful they become snynonymous with their whole category — nobody asks for a facial tissue, they ask for a Kleenex, you know? Today's episode is, at least in part, about two of those products. First, The Verge's Jennifer Pattison Tuohy joins the show to chart the rise and fall of the Roomba, the robot vacuum that practically invented the category and yet seems to have been left behind. Can iRobot get its robot back on its feet? After that, Kobo CEO Michael Tamblyn discusses the state of e-readers, what it's like to always be "the best non-Amazon option," and what we all want from devices that aren't our smartphone. Finally, The Verge's Chris Welch helps us answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11, or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about which TV you should buy in 2025. It's a complicated question, but there are answers.


2
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:06,755
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the E Inc. Tech Stack.

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:10,515
Speaker 1:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am currently spending my morning going

4
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:14,475
Speaker 1:  around my basement putting little tiny pieces of electrical tape

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:18,715
Speaker 1:  on all of the glowing lights in this room. So my parents were here this

6
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:22,515
Speaker 1:  weekend and there are just lights everywhere.

7
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:26,595
Speaker 1:  I discovered this is the guest room where people sleep. And I realized that

8
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:30,155
Speaker 1:  even when you turn off all the lights in this room, there's stuff just

9
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:33,795
Speaker 1:  glowing everywhere. Like I have computer speakers that have this

10
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:37,915
Speaker 1:  really unnecessarily bright green light. I have the thing that

11
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:40,075
Speaker 1:  I plug my mic and headphones into, and it has

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,155
Speaker 1:  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

13
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:48,075
Speaker 1:  different things illuminated right now. Why? I have a

14
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:51,595
Speaker 1:  Meta Quest three back there that I think has five lights that are on at all

15
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:55,035
Speaker 1:  times. My TV glows when it's off for no reason.

16
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:59,435
Speaker 1:  Thank you TCL for that terrible decision. There's just a lot of

17
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:03,355
Speaker 1:  lights and I think that is bad. And so I'm going around

18
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:06,715
Speaker 1:  and just putting little tiny pieces of tape on every single one that I can

19
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:10,435
Speaker 1:  find, and we're gonna put darkness back in this room and I'm very excited

20
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:13,355
Speaker 1:  about it. And also, if you're a product maker and you find yourself at some

21
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:17,115
Speaker 1:  point being like, oh, should I have a green light on this? That glows

22
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:20,995
Speaker 1:  24 hours a day? The answer is no. Just just stop it. Go find

23
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:24,915
Speaker 1:  something else to do. That is, that is the only thing I have learned is that

24
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:28,115
Speaker 1:  you don't need the green lights and we can all move on with our lives anyway.

25
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,275
Speaker 1:  We are not here on The Vergecast to talk about lights, at least not more

26
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:35,075
Speaker 1:  than you know we normally do. On this podcast today, we're gonna do two things.

27
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:39,475
Speaker 1:  First, we're gonna talk to Jen Tui about the story of iRobot and

28
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:43,275
Speaker 1:  the Roomba, because in a certain way, that story has come to an end and

29
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:45,955
Speaker 1:  it's been a really interesting one and we're gonna talk through as much of

30
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:49,875
Speaker 1:  it as we can. Then I'm gonna talk to Michael Tamlin, who is the CEO of Cobo

31
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:54,075
Speaker 1:  about EIN and e-readers and what people

32
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:57,595
Speaker 1:  want from a device that isn't their smartphone. I really enjoyed talking

33
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,555
Speaker 1:  to Michael and I think you'll enjoy hearing it. We also have a really fun

34
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:03,595
Speaker 1:  hotline question. Lots to get to. So much going on.

35
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:07,475
Speaker 1:  News continues to be nuts, but we're gonna have some fun today. All that

36
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:11,235
Speaker 1:  is coming up in just a second, but first, I'm sure there's like 85 more lights

37
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:14,755
Speaker 1:  and so I have more electrical taping to do. This is The Vergecast, we'll

38
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:15,115
Speaker 1:  be right back.

39
00:03:56,865 --> 00:04:00,855
Speaker 1:  March 11th says, iRobot launches eight new Roombas and finally adds

40
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:04,415
Speaker 1:  LIDAR mapping. Great, exciting. Cool. We love a new robot vacuum.

41
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:09,095
Speaker 1:  The next day, like 17 hours later, iRobot tells

42
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:12,975
Speaker 1:  investors its future is in doubt. How? How? How does that make

43
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:16,375
Speaker 1:  sense? How do you put these two stories next to each other? iRobot making

44
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:20,455
Speaker 1:  RUS forever super successful. Biggest name in the whole space. It is the

45
00:04:20,455 --> 00:04:23,735
Speaker 1:  thing everybody calls all the other devices. It's the, it's the Kleenex or

46
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:27,415
Speaker 1:  the Google of robot vacuums. And yet iRobot

47
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,215
Speaker 1:  is, is falling apart. This company can't keep up anymore.

48
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:35,255
Speaker 1:  How did this happen? How did we get here? And how is it this company

49
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:40,015
Speaker 1:  that both set this market off to what it is and doesn't seem to

50
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:43,495
Speaker 1:  be able to keep up? Jen Tuy wrote both of those articles that I just read

51
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:46,895
Speaker 1:  the headlines of and she is gonna help me dig into

52
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:50,575
Speaker 1:  the history of this company and how it all went wrong.

53
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:54,215
Speaker 1:  So let's get into it. Jen Chewy, welcome to the show.

54
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:55,815
Speaker 7:  Hello. Happy to be here.

55
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:59,815
Speaker 1:  I don't know if we're here to do like a, a funeral for the Roomba

56
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:03,735
Speaker 1:  or A-A-A-A-A retrospective or like a

57
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:07,495
Speaker 1:  celebration of life or a something, but I wanna, I wanna talk about Roomba,

58
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:10,965
Speaker 1:  which I feel like is, is going through

59
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:16,085
Speaker 1:  a bit of a challenging time right now after a very long, and I

60
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:19,405
Speaker 1:  would say epic run of being a really fascinating

61
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:22,165
Speaker 1:  gadget. But it's tough times in Roomba land right now.

62
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:26,565
Speaker 7:  It is. It's been, it's been a hard week. Well, an exciting week and then

63
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:30,445
Speaker 7:  a hard week last week where they launched a bunch of new robots

64
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:34,405
Speaker 7:  and then the next day said, we might go out of business. So it was kind of

65
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:35,445
Speaker 7:  like one of those woof

66
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's a real shot chaser moment there.

67
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,325
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So it's it and it's sad. It's sad times. I mean, I remember buying,

68
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:46,685
Speaker 7:  I think when I've moved into my first home, I, a long time ago

69
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:52,165
Speaker 7:  we got a rumor and I was so excited and so I've had rumors in my life

70
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:56,125
Speaker 7:  for decades and yeah, they're still in my life. They're not gone

71
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:56,365
Speaker 7:  yet.

72
00:05:57,475 --> 00:06:01,365
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So let, let's just start at the very beginning before there

73
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:05,005
Speaker 1:  was the Roomba, there was the company that made the Roomba

74
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:09,085
Speaker 1:  called iRobot. But if I understand correctly, this company did not like set

75
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:12,725
Speaker 1:  out to build vacuums. Like what was iRobot before?

76
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:14,525
Speaker 1:  It was the Roomba company?

77
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah, so they originally were founded, so actually it's a

78
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,685
Speaker 7:  Silicon Valley tale that based in Massachusetts. Mm,

79
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,845
Speaker 7:  okay. So they are f it was founded by 3M IT

80
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:29,765
Speaker 7:  grads. They were grad students, I believe when they actually founded it.

81
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:33,765
Speaker 7:  So they were roboticists, it was Colin Angle, Helen

82
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:37,285
Speaker 7:  Greener and Rodney Brooks. And it was, it was founded in

83
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:41,365
Speaker 7:  1990. Oh wow. And you're right, the idea wasn't, they weren't even

84
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:45,285
Speaker 7:  thinking about vacuums for your house at the time. They were basically

85
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:49,125
Speaker 7:  trying to sort of start making robots of any type because in the nineties

86
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,845
Speaker 7:  we didn't really have, you know, beyond maybe dishwashers and washing

87
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,645
Speaker 7:  machines that we didn't have robots in our home. But there also

88
00:06:56,645 --> 00:07:00,365
Speaker 7:  weren't a lot of really single purpose interesting robots in

89
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:05,005
Speaker 7:  spaces that could use them. So they were kind of looking to fill gaps

90
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:09,085
Speaker 7:  with building robots that could help specifically in areas

91
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:12,925
Speaker 7:  where people can't go or don't want to go. I mean, they were a startup,

92
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:17,045
Speaker 7:  most of their original robots were developed in partnership with different

93
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:20,525
Speaker 7:  organizations. So they worked with NASA and actually helped develop the

94
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,965
Speaker 7:  original Miles Rover. They worked with the US government,

95
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:29,245
Speaker 7:  darpa, to develop a stair climbing robot

96
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:33,205
Speaker 7:  that could go into, into rubble, into

97
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:37,045
Speaker 7:  places that humans couldn't go try and help. You know, things like

98
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:40,485
Speaker 7:  bum disposal, hazmat, search and rescue. Oh wow. Those types of things where

99
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,525
Speaker 7:  having a robot put them in a dangerous situation that would be better than

100
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:47,765
Speaker 7:  putting a human in. So they did a lot of really interesting things.

101
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:51,965
Speaker 7:  Again, startups. So they were working with organizations that could help

102
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:55,885
Speaker 7:  fund them. So they spent about 12 years building robots for the military,

103
00:07:56,025 --> 00:08:00,005
Speaker 7:  law enforcement, energy sector, industrial cleaning, even some

104
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:00,325
Speaker 7:  toys.

105
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:04,285
Speaker 1:  And this is in the nineties, so like way ahead of the game on a lot of this

106
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:08,445
Speaker 7:  Way ahead of the game. Okay. Yes, exactly. And really they were

107
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:12,005
Speaker 7:  very, very innovative. I mean, none of these robots were, and actually this

108
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:15,725
Speaker 7:  was something that Colin Angle, the CEO was kind of quite specific

109
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:19,445
Speaker 7:  about. He was never trying to build the humanoid robot. He was,

110
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:23,445
Speaker 7:  they were always trying to build a purpose robot like a

111
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:27,045
Speaker 7:  robot to solve a problem or to, to come, you know, be

112
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:31,405
Speaker 7:  able to do something that humans didn't want to or shouldn't

113
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:31,525
Speaker 7:  do.

114
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,805
Speaker 1:  Interesting. Wait, that's very funny because I think the, the Rosie

115
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:39,685
Speaker 1:  the robot comparison to Roomba in particular from, you know,

116
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,445
Speaker 1:  Rosie, the robot from the Jetsons, this is like everybody's idea of the

117
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:47,405
Speaker 1:  like robot helper around the house. And I feel like that has been put next

118
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:51,285
Speaker 1:  to Roomba for as long as I can remember. But

119
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:53,845
Speaker 1:  you're telling me that's not ever what actually they were trying to build?

120
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:58,005
Speaker 7:  No, in fact, when I was doing some research for today, I was, I found

121
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,885
Speaker 7:  some old interviews and, and they, iRobot specifically

122
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:05,445
Speaker 7:  said the idea of trying to build a humanoid

123
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,125
Speaker 7:  robot that would push a vacuum around is just so

124
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:13,045
Speaker 7:  difficult. Like, huh. It's just not really realistic and it'd be so

125
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:16,885
Speaker 7:  expensive. Which we've all, and we've seen this 30 years later and

126
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:20,805
Speaker 7:  the sort of nascent attempts of humanoid robots that the concept

127
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:24,965
Speaker 7:  is just not that viable. And even if some, even if you

128
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,965
Speaker 7:  can build it, which you can, 'cause we've seen humanoid robots, you know,

129
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:30,565
Speaker 7:  your average American consumer isn't gonna be spending, you know,

130
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:34,965
Speaker 7:  $15,000 if on a robot to,

131
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:38,965
Speaker 7:  to push a vacuum around their house. It makes much more sense to take

132
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:42,885
Speaker 7:  technology and solve a specific problem, such as floor cleaning.

133
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:46,845
Speaker 7:  And, and this is where they, so actually they first started in

134
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:50,325
Speaker 7:  the floor cleaning realm. They had an engineer, his name was

135
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:54,125
Speaker 7:  Joe Jones, who's also from MIT, who had been tinkering with

136
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,085
Speaker 7:  developing a floor sweeping robot for years. His original prototype

137
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:01,885
Speaker 7:  before he started working for iRobot was built from Legos. Oh wow. So,

138
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:05,925
Speaker 7:  but he'd been with them for a while and he was like, Hey, I've got this idea.

139
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:10,165
Speaker 7:  And they formed, they had already started working with a couple companies

140
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:13,965
Speaker 7:  to try and build automatic floor sweeping robots in

141
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:17,485
Speaker 7:  like warehouses. You know, again, solving a problem. Like we have this,

142
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,965
Speaker 7:  this large space, we need it cleaned and it costs a lot to hire a person

143
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:25,925
Speaker 7:  to do it. So if we could build a robot, we, you know, so they had been working

144
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,845
Speaker 7:  on that partnership with SC Johnson I think it was,

145
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:33,445
Speaker 7:  and then that didn't work out, but they ended up working with a few different

146
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:37,445
Speaker 7:  companies who sort of helped them focus in and

147
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:41,405
Speaker 7:  then realize actually this is what we can do. We can build a small

148
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:45,485
Speaker 7:  circular disc that just rolls around your house and sucks

149
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:49,445
Speaker 7:  up dirt and, which is apparently a much more complicated and

150
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:53,165
Speaker 7:  difficult thing to do than it sounds. So it took them a while. But yeah,

151
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:56,885
Speaker 7:  eventually in 2002, so 12 years after

152
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:00,925
Speaker 7:  first founding the company, they launched the first

153
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:05,485
Speaker 7:  consumer robot vacuum in the us. There had

154
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:09,005
Speaker 7:  been one prior in the U in Europe from Electrolux,

155
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,445
Speaker 7:  but it didn't last long. And then, yeah, the sort of, the main thing it

156
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:17,685
Speaker 7:  featured was bump sensors. So basically it would bump around your house

157
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:21,565
Speaker 7:  if you everyone remembers. I mean some of them still do that and cliff

158
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:24,765
Speaker 7:  sensors so that it wouldn't throw itself down the stairs or off a balcony

159
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:28,885
Speaker 7:  and Yeah. That, that was, and that was only $200

160
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,365
Speaker 7:  in 2002. Oh wow.

161
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:34,365
Speaker 1:  I assumed it was gonna be like three grand. Yeah, those first

162
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:37,045
Speaker 7:  Ones interesting. I mean that's what, that was the push really. This has

163
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:40,925
Speaker 7:  to be a consum robot, a consumable so that people can afford it.

164
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:44,725
Speaker 7:  Although the next one, and I think the one I ended up buying got a lot more

165
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,125
Speaker 7:  expensive. I'm not really sure what happened in between.

166
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:50,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah, Roombas haven't been $200 in a very long time.

167
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:56,205
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So they, that was sort of the entry into the market and

168
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:57,245
Speaker 7:  it was very successful.

169
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:00,805
Speaker 1:  Part of the reason I'm so fascinated by Roomba is like, It is, It is the

170
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:04,765
Speaker 1:  Kleenex of this space, right? Like everybody calls all the other ones Roombas.

171
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:08,725
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I think that has been true, certainly for as long as

172
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:11,965
Speaker 1:  I can remember and have been paying attention to this space. So like did

173
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:15,685
Speaker 1:  iRobot get that just by being first and having a cool product name? Or was

174
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:19,245
Speaker 1:  it like, did they invent something sort of spectacular

175
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:22,605
Speaker 1:  and new that made this thing amazing From the very beginning?

176
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:27,365
Speaker 7:  They did invent technology that had never been invented before. Okay.

177
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:31,765
Speaker 7:  So yes. And, and they did something very smart, which I'm sure most companies

178
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:35,645
Speaker 7:  do, but they patented everything. Mm. So

179
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:39,725
Speaker 7:  they have like thousands of patents, patents, patents,

180
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,685
Speaker 7:  sorry, my US English, UK English, going back and forth. We'll allow it. Yeah.

181
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:48,565
Speaker 7:  So they, and they, they have one patent in particular that was

182
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:52,645
Speaker 7:  basically for the entire robot vacuum system that Oh,

183
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:56,325
Speaker 7:  okay. That really meant, that was one of the reasons why we did not see

184
00:12:56,725 --> 00:13:00,485
Speaker 7:  a lot of competition for a long time. They actually

185
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:04,525
Speaker 7:  very fierce, fiercely enforced those patents as well. So

186
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:08,605
Speaker 7:  they were, they had a lot, they had has had some competition come along,

187
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:13,245
Speaker 7:  but they either, you know, were sort of shot down or got

188
00:13:13,245 --> 00:13:13,525
Speaker 7:  bought.

189
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,365
Speaker 1:  One of the questions I had for you was like, why did all the competition

190
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:21,005
Speaker 1:  take so long to appear? I, is that the answer that

191
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:24,925
Speaker 1:  essentially I robot manage to own the idea of a

192
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:26,445
Speaker 1:  robot vacuum for a long time?

193
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:30,805
Speaker 7:  I think so. I mean, I'm not a patent law expert, but it does seem

194
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:33,885
Speaker 7:  that that is sort of what, what happened. It took, I mean a lot of these

195
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:37,445
Speaker 7:  patents I think expired in the last few years, which is one reason why you've

196
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:41,165
Speaker 7:  seen a resurgence or you see more and more robots arriving.

197
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:44,485
Speaker 7:  I, I did find a really interesting anecdote, apparently

198
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:48,685
Speaker 7:  there was, it was sometime in like

199
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,605
Speaker 7:  2020, there was a, my

200
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:56,565
Speaker 7:  Genie was a, a Chinese company that had a robot that they launched

201
00:13:57,025 --> 00:14:00,765
Speaker 7:  and it enforced its patents and it sued them. And apparently people

202
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:04,645
Speaker 7:  came and ripped the robots off the show floor at

203
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:08,565
Speaker 7:  efa. Whoa. Once they'd won the patent battle because yeah,

204
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:12,205
Speaker 7:  they really did enforce it, you know, and okay, fair enough.

205
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:15,165
Speaker 7:  It's their intellectual property and people were copying them and you can

206
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:18,045
Speaker 7:  see people have copied them. If you look today at all the robots out there,

207
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:23,325
Speaker 7:  they all look basically like Roombas. They, no one's

208
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:27,165
Speaker 7:  really come up with a brand new design. There is a company we've

209
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:30,685
Speaker 7:  covered called Matt that has sort of come up with a, a, a new

210
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:34,805
Speaker 7:  look for the robot vacuum and a new, it has different

211
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:38,605
Speaker 7:  technology uses entirely camera based. And it, it

212
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:42,765
Speaker 7:  actually looks like has one of those like, looks like a pro, a

213
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:45,885
Speaker 7:  traditional vacuum in the front. Like it has a little head that it pushes

214
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,485
Speaker 7:  around. But yeah, things, I mean, shark, ninja,

215
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:53,765
Speaker 7:  Dyson, Samsung, they all came out with, if you look at

216
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:57,605
Speaker 7:  those, their, their robot vacuums are, are different looking than all the

217
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:01,365
Speaker 7:  big companies. You're, you might be used to seeing like Robo rock and Ecova

218
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:04,725
Speaker 7:  because they, I think deliberately had to design around

219
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:09,445
Speaker 7:  avoiding iRobots patents. That's why we have those, those

220
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:13,125
Speaker 7:  products came out looking a little different. Like the first Samsung one

221
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,645
Speaker 7:  looked like a, a storm trooper.

222
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:16,365
Speaker 1:  Oh I remember that.

223
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:20,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And the Dyson ones are very unique and very purple.

224
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:24,765
Speaker 7:  And then Nito was the other one and it came out with a square

225
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:29,725
Speaker 7:  robot, which actually makes more sense when you think

226
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:33,005
Speaker 7:  about trying to get into corners. But I've heard from many people that square

227
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:36,565
Speaker 7:  robots have significant navigation issues. And that is something I personally

228
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:40,325
Speaker 7:  experienced when testing a nito. And then sadly Nito went out of business

229
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:43,685
Speaker 7:  a few few years ago. It was another US based

230
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:47,925
Speaker 7:  company and it very much suffered, I think from a lot of the same market

231
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:51,845
Speaker 7:  pressures that iRobot has suffered from. But iRobot was in a much stronger

232
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:55,925
Speaker 7:  position to deal with those for longer than I think

233
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,045
Speaker 7:  Nito was, unfortunately.

234
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:00,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So let, let's talk about those market pressures actually. 'cause I

235
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:03,885
Speaker 1:  think that's kind of the next, that turn in the Roomba story, right? It

236
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:08,005
Speaker 1:  it's sort of won the market. It was the market for

237
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:11,965
Speaker 1:  like, I don't, 10 years maybe. Yeah. Somewhere up to

238
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:15,605
Speaker 1:  almost 10 years I'm thinking like, I don't know, 2010 ish.

239
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:18,885
Speaker 1:  I feel like it was, it was the Roomba's world and we all just lived in it.

240
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:22,805
Speaker 1:  And then kind of slowly and then all at once this, this

241
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:26,605
Speaker 1:  market went from just room the Roomba

242
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,885
Speaker 1:  to, oh my God, look at all of these robot vacuums.

243
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:33,645
Speaker 1:  Yes. What, what happened? How did that, where did that all come from?

244
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah, so just sort of from a robot's perspective, they

245
00:16:38,145 --> 00:16:42,085
Speaker 7:  had decided to really focus just on consumer robots. So

246
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:46,005
Speaker 7:  they got rid of their military and exploratory

247
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:49,605
Speaker 7:  space arm. They sold that off and really focused on the

248
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,365
Speaker 7:  Roombas and produced one or two new models

249
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,965
Speaker 7:  every year. Which at that time, you know, 20 this, you know, we're going

250
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:00,845
Speaker 7:  from like 20 13, 20 14, 20 15, 20 16. We, we

251
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:04,605
Speaker 7:  had a new one pretty much every year, each one improving on the last,

252
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:07,805
Speaker 7:  they added wifi in

253
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:11,445
Speaker 7:  20 13, 20 14, around there with the eight 80 and the

254
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:15,365
Speaker 7:  900 they added and the nine 80. They were,

255
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:17,405
Speaker 7:  the naming has never got better. Oh

256
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:20,965
Speaker 1:  I know. Terrible. It's so funny 'cause they, they nailed it with Roomba,

257
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:24,325
Speaker 1:  like Roomba unbelievably great name and then it all just fell apart.

258
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:28,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So they added a lot of interesting technology. They were trying to

259
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:32,805
Speaker 7:  always make it better. I think kind of a pinnacle moment was like 2018 when

260
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:36,205
Speaker 7:  they introduced the I seven and this was the first one that could remember

261
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:40,445
Speaker 7:  where it had been. So it stopped just bouncing randomly

262
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:44,365
Speaker 7:  around your house. You actually would create a map for you so you

263
00:17:44,365 --> 00:17:48,285
Speaker 7:  could send it to clean specific areas and specific rooms and didn't

264
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:50,725
Speaker 7:  get confused just 'cause you picked it up and moved it. I dunno if you've

265
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:53,165
Speaker 7:  ever had that experience with the robot vacuum. Oh yeah. But you put, you

266
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:56,165
Speaker 7:  pick it up 'cause it like, you know, ran into your shoe and then it's just

267
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,845
Speaker 7:  like, I don't know where I'm, save me.

268
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:03,725
Speaker 7:  So that, that was the I seven. And then they also introduced the auto empty

269
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,605
Speaker 7:  dock, which was a game changer.

270
00:18:06,475 --> 00:18:09,725
Speaker 1:  Like, it, it, it really truly was. It was, I have, I have one of those

271
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:13,445
Speaker 1:  upstairs and that was the first time I was like, okay, I will spend whatever

272
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:16,605
Speaker 1:  it costs to get one of these things because now

273
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:20,685
Speaker 1:  I don't have to do any work. Nice. I just like every, every once in a while

274
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:24,605
Speaker 1:  I have to take the bag out and otherwise my, my floors are just fine.

275
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:28,005
Speaker 1:  Like, it really was life changing. That one innovation

276
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:32,165
Speaker 7:  That was when I came back to the Roomba because the one I had had, I

277
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:34,685
Speaker 7:  think in 2003 or oh four,

278
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,805
Speaker 7:  I would come home from work and it would've stopped somewhere and not made

279
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:43,765
Speaker 7:  it anywhere. And you had to buy the little towers to stop it from going certain

280
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:47,645
Speaker 7:  places and it was just too complicated unless you had like

281
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:51,245
Speaker 7:  nothing in your house. But then they just, you know,

282
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,925
Speaker 7:  they have done a lot to make the robot

283
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:59,165
Speaker 7:  actually, I mean they, they say their words are complete its mission. 'cause

284
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,965
Speaker 7:  that was, you know, it, it's a great technology but if it doesn't finish

285
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:05,525
Speaker 7:  what it started, it's becomes a frustrating technology. Yep.

286
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,965
Speaker 7:  So yes. So it, they had gradually been increasing

287
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:14,125
Speaker 7:  the development on the robot coming up with interesting new elements for

288
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,725
Speaker 7:  it starting to, IM implement AI machine learning.

289
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:22,285
Speaker 7:  I mean robot vacuums really are some of the beginnings of AI in the home,

290
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:26,245
Speaker 7:  which is an interesting maybe side note but, and then

291
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,565
Speaker 7:  by 2019 it had an estimated 88% market share. So I mean we're

292
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:32,405
Speaker 7:  talking Whoa. Completely dominant.

293
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,765
Speaker 1:  Okay. So that's even later than I expected. Yeah,

294
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:39,525
Speaker 7:  It was still very Wow. Okay. Very dominant. And then

295
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:43,605
Speaker 7:  the pandemic was sort of like a double-edged sword

296
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:48,285
Speaker 7:  it, from what I understand, you know, I think by this point

297
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,685
Speaker 7:  it, you know, we'd sold something like 30 million robots. So that's a

298
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:56,525
Speaker 7:  significant number. Yeah. And like you say, it was the Kleenex, you know,

299
00:19:56,845 --> 00:20:00,645
Speaker 7:  everyone referred to anything that rolled around your house and sucked up

300
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:04,405
Speaker 7:  dirt as a Roomba, whether wherever it came from. And then, you know, we were

301
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:07,965
Speaker 7:  starting to see Chinese competition come in. We still had a lot of

302
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:12,165
Speaker 7:  competition in America as well. Nito and Shark

303
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:16,005
Speaker 7:  Ninja and a couple others. And then pandemic hit

304
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:20,125
Speaker 7:  and there was this huge surge. 'cause remember we're all back home.

305
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,405
Speaker 7:  We're all our home. Sure. And we're all wanting to look after our home and

306
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:26,325
Speaker 7:  clean our home because we're spending all our time in our home. But also

307
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:28,925
Speaker 7:  you are all in, when you're in your home and your robot vacuum's running,

308
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:33,605
Speaker 7:  you're not a happy person. No. Because they can be really annoying.

309
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:38,125
Speaker 7:  So it was kind of a double-edged sword. And then the other thing that hit

310
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:42,085
Speaker 7:  it was the tariffs, which apparently they

311
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:46,285
Speaker 7:  had to pay millions of dollars in tariffs. So there was kind of like this

312
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,485
Speaker 7:  moment where they were doing really, really well and then suddenly they were

313
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:53,885
Speaker 7:  sort of squashed. And this was right around the time that the Chinese

314
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,605
Speaker 7:  manufacturers were really ramping up. And I, again, not,

315
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:00,205
Speaker 7:  I don't know the particulars of the patent law, but I think right around

316
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:04,125
Speaker 7:  this time too, there was some patents that had expired. So it was possible

317
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:08,245
Speaker 7:  for a lot of these manufacturers to come in and do very similar things

318
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:12,125
Speaker 7:  and for a lot less money. One thing Roomba didn't do

319
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:16,125
Speaker 7:  as it increased its technology and made its

320
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:20,325
Speaker 7:  mission complete was make prices cheaper.

321
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:24,565
Speaker 7:  There were never, like you said, I don't think, we never, we ever saw a $200

322
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:28,365
Speaker 7:  Roomba again until, I mean there was some of it's very low

323
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:32,165
Speaker 7:  end models you could get for around that price, but they didn't have mapping

324
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:36,645
Speaker 7:  that you still needed to buy a hundred dollars tower things to keep it out

325
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:39,005
Speaker 7:  of rooms. Yeah. I don't count that as a $200 Roomba. Yeah.

326
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:44,085
Speaker 7:  That point. Yeah. It's just not worth it. So yeah. And then

327
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:47,925
Speaker 7:  we got, so Robo Rock arrived in the

328
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,125
Speaker 7:  US in 2018. Ecova had come along

329
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:56,045
Speaker 7:  a little bit before that. That's the dBot robots. And then, and then from

330
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:59,845
Speaker 7:  then on we just, like every month there was a new robot

331
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:03,285
Speaker 7:  vacuum manufacturer. We got dreamy, we had Shark Ninja

332
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:07,765
Speaker 7:  NARAL Anchor came out with their UFI brand. TP Link has their tap

333
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:11,565
Speaker 7:  brand now. I mean there there are, there are dozens of them. And also

334
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:15,245
Speaker 7:  Samsung has been working in this space too. So they just, there was

335
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:18,725
Speaker 7:  competition coming from all angles. And there is where,

336
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:23,325
Speaker 7:  I mean what went wrong, did they not innovate? Right? That's what people

337
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,445
Speaker 7:  say a lot. There was a key difference

338
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:31,085
Speaker 7:  between Roombas and all of the competition. And that was how

339
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:34,805
Speaker 7:  they navigated. So Roombas had developed a

340
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:38,685
Speaker 7:  technology for, so all robot vacuums use something called

341
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:42,525
Speaker 7:  simultaneous localization and mapping slam Roomba

342
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:45,605
Speaker 7:  used Vlam, which is visual, simultaneous location

343
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:49,885
Speaker 7:  localization and mapping. Okay. With a camera on the

344
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,245
Speaker 7:  top of the robot that looked up in the sky. And that's why you always had

345
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,285
Speaker 7:  to have the lights on when you ran your roombas a while ago. Oh sure.

346
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:59,605
Speaker 7:  And this was how they mapped and navigated your home. The new

347
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:02,925
Speaker 7:  manufacturers coming in or used lidar, which is again

348
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:07,365
Speaker 7:  the same technology, but not using cameras, using lasers.

349
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:11,125
Speaker 7:  Right. And it's just like, I mean it's like self-driving cars. And when Roomba

350
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,965
Speaker 7:  started that technology was really expensive. So I think they

351
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:18,285
Speaker 7:  looked for a different way to implement navigation.

352
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:22,805
Speaker 7:  But the market has very much shifted entirely to lidar. And

353
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:26,805
Speaker 7:  I would hear, I would always hear complaints from readers about why doesn't

354
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,085
Speaker 7:  Roomba have lidar? Why doesn't Roomba have lidar? And I think what started

355
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:33,445
Speaker 7:  to happen is that every other robot had it and Roomba didn't. And I think

356
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:37,365
Speaker 7:  a lot of people started to think, well I want the lidar, I want the

357
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:40,965
Speaker 7:  little tower. And so there was a kind of shift, I don't know if, I don't

358
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:44,725
Speaker 7:  personally agree that Lidar is better, but this could, that could be an

359
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:48,925
Speaker 7:  entirely an entire, whole podcast for sure. But

360
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:52,645
Speaker 7:  I, I actually think Roomba's mapping has got very, very good. It doesn't

361
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:55,805
Speaker 7:  get lost like a lot of the lidar robots don't do. And it doesn't try and

362
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:59,565
Speaker 7:  escape like a lot of the lidar radars do because they think

363
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:04,125
Speaker 7:  they use navigation. I said with lasers, so if it can

364
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:08,045
Speaker 7:  see out a door or out a window, it thinks that's a room.

365
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:12,365
Speaker 7:  And if you don't set the map to tell it not to go that way, it

366
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:16,325
Speaker 7:  will, it will jump the fence and go and just go off Oh boy.

367
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:20,165
Speaker 7:  Into the distance. Cool. So yeah, that and,

368
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:24,045
Speaker 7:  but that, that's definitely been an area where I think, I don't know if they

369
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,365
Speaker 7:  made the wrong choice there by not going with Lidar sooner.

370
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:31,725
Speaker 7:  Side note, there are new RO robots that came out last week or use

371
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:35,525
Speaker 7:  lidar. Oh, interesting. We'll get to that. Yeah. And then

372
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:39,525
Speaker 7:  they also, so one thing they were very insistent on,

373
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:43,325
Speaker 7:  and I talked to the CEO Colin Eng about this when these

374
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:46,645
Speaker 7:  products started to come out, was that the idea of a

375
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:50,285
Speaker 7:  combination robot vacuum and robot mop was like an

376
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:54,125
Speaker 7:  abomination. They said back to this single purpose idea,

377
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:57,565
Speaker 7:  they had a robot vacuum and they had a robot mop and they said, these work

378
00:24:57,565 --> 00:25:01,445
Speaker 7:  really well together, buy them both. Let the robot vacuum and

379
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:05,365
Speaker 7:  then the robot mop. And in some ways that was a

380
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:09,165
Speaker 7:  good solution, more expensive. And the Bravo jet had

381
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,925
Speaker 7:  some issues, like it couldn't get over a transition that was like this high.

382
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:15,405
Speaker 7:  So if you had anything in your house, it wasn't gonna, any kind of transition

383
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:19,365
Speaker 7:  in your house, it was gonna be stuck in one room. And so it really stuck

384
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:23,285
Speaker 7:  to that idea for a long time as these other companies came in with these

385
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:27,045
Speaker 7:  dual purpose robots, which not great

386
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:31,165
Speaker 7:  initially at doing both of those things. So I think Roomba felt

387
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:34,565
Speaker 7:  like, well we were right, ours are better. Sure. But also yours are three

388
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:38,485
Speaker 7:  times the price, right? So this is where the market forces come

389
00:25:38,485 --> 00:25:42,445
Speaker 7:  in. If you can get a robot vacuum that can mop for $400,

390
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:46,485
Speaker 7:  why would you buy two separate devices to do the same thing? So Right.

391
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:50,325
Speaker 7:  That's an area where they sort of fell down. I think that they were focusing

392
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:54,125
Speaker 7:  much more on the software than on the hardware. I think they felt like we've,

393
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,925
Speaker 7:  we've solved the hardware. Our vacuums are cleaning your house. Now

394
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,405
Speaker 7:  we're gonna make them do it better

395
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:04,765
Speaker 7:  by, by using software, by using things like AI powered

396
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:09,085
Speaker 7:  obstacle detection to avoid getting tripped up by cables and

397
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:13,525
Speaker 7:  pet poop and anything else that might be lying around your house. And that,

398
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,685
Speaker 7:  you know, that was a great innovation and now all the other robot manufacturers

399
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:19,805
Speaker 7:  have copied that and are working on that. But I still think

400
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:24,285
Speaker 7:  iRobot has the best in that class. They were also

401
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:28,205
Speaker 7:  working towards this kind of larger smart home vision. They

402
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:31,965
Speaker 7:  had bought a air purifier company, they were

403
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,885
Speaker 7:  working, I they released their iRobot os

404
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,965
Speaker 7:  they call it. So they had like an operating system for their robot vacuums

405
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:42,965
Speaker 7:  that gave all these extra levels of intelligence.

406
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,165
Speaker 7:  Things like dirt detect, carpet detect

407
00:26:46,765 --> 00:26:50,685
Speaker 7:  things that just make the robot able to do more. But I

408
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:54,485
Speaker 7:  think that's, those are harder cells to a consumer who has to

409
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:58,245
Speaker 7:  sort of read through the fine print or really understand what the

410
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:01,845
Speaker 7:  benefit is of a dirt detect. I mean,

411
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,685
Speaker 7:  it's neat when the robot finds something that's like a pile of dirt

412
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:09,525
Speaker 7:  instead of just plowing through it. Like most will, it'll stop and go back

413
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:12,805
Speaker 7:  and forth and back and forth, you know, and that, that's what you want.

414
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,885
Speaker 7:  But again, versus a product that has

415
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,405
Speaker 7:  more bells and whistles, more visible bells and whistles

416
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:25,205
Speaker 7:  and higher suction power. And to be fair, I mean It is still

417
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:29,685
Speaker 7:  one of the dominant in the market except it's just that the, the pie

418
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:33,725
Speaker 7:  got a lot smaller. I mean his, it's slice of the pie got a lot

419
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:37,125
Speaker 7:  smaller. So the pie, you know, a lot more people came in and now it's like

420
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,925
Speaker 7:  13. And actually they just released one industry

421
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:44,605
Speaker 7:  analysis company released some statistics today to show that for the first

422
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:48,565
Speaker 7:  time Robo Rock is now globally has a

423
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:52,445
Speaker 7:  larger market share than iRobot. So just continuing that downward trend.

424
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:56,565
Speaker 7:  But back to my point is that Roomba has, I

425
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:59,925
Speaker 7:  think they focused very much like I said on the software

426
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:03,365
Speaker 7:  rather than developing the hardware. And then when they got caught behind

427
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:07,365
Speaker 7:  on the hardware side, they tried too little

428
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:11,405
Speaker 7:  too late with their dual, their combo mopping robots that came out.

429
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:15,845
Speaker 7:  They never really FI mean they, they were kind of ingenious. They have this

430
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:19,565
Speaker 7:  little auto robotic arm that lifts up

431
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,845
Speaker 7:  and scoots itself under the robot and goes and mops and then when

432
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:27,645
Speaker 7:  it hits a carpet, it lifts the ro the arm back up over the top of the robot.

433
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:31,565
Speaker 7:  Oh, that's cool. And vacuums and that's neat. But the, the mop is like

434
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:33,285
Speaker 7:  two millimeters wide.

435
00:28:35,345 --> 00:28:38,885
Speaker 7:  So it's takes a really long time to mop a big downstairs

436
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:42,925
Speaker 7:  hardwood floor area compared to like the latest R robo rocks

437
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:46,845
Speaker 7:  or dreamies that have these giant spinning mop pads,

438
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:50,165
Speaker 7:  which as of last week Rumbas now have,

439
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:52,685
Speaker 7:  you can see a trend here

440
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:56,925
Speaker 1:  Trend. Yeah. So I, I do wanna get to what launched last week, but I think

441
00:28:56,925 --> 00:29:00,365
Speaker 1:  there's one more piece of the transition here.

442
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:04,085
Speaker 1:  Take me through the, the Amazon iRobot saga quickly.

443
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:08,325
Speaker 7:  Yes. So about, so right around the time

444
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:12,605
Speaker 7:  iRobot was starting to see a drop in revenue

445
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:17,445
Speaker 7:  was starting to struggle a little bit and see a huge

446
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:22,365
Speaker 7:  pressure from the mark Chinese manufacturers and others entering the market.

447
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:24,645
Speaker 7:  So right after the pandemic really,

448
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:28,845
Speaker 1:  Was this right around the time you first had a house full of robot

449
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:32,525
Speaker 1:  vacuum? Yes. I tracked this by like how many vacuums are in the picture that

450
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:35,445
Speaker 1:  Jen posts in Slack. And I feel like that was right around the time. It's

451
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:38,965
Speaker 1:  like there are just a dozen of these running around Jen's living room. It

452
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:42,925
Speaker 7:  Is, It is. I, when the robot uprising happens, I

453
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:43,885
Speaker 7:  am the first go

454
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:48,245
Speaker 1:  A hundred percent. It's been so nice knowing you, but that's absolutely correct.

455
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:53,045
Speaker 7:  Yeah. There are more robots than people in my house by a long

456
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:57,605
Speaker 7:  shot and pets more robots than people and pets. Although my newest

457
00:29:57,745 --> 00:30:01,485
Speaker 7:  pet actually is starting to enjoy riding on them, which I'm so excited about.

458
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:05,365
Speaker 1:  Oh, you're, well then the, the one pet's fine king of the robots.

459
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:07,445
Speaker 1:  Yes. Then the rest of you are toes.

460
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:12,165
Speaker 7:  But yeah, so like around 2022 I think is when it first, when iRobot

461
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:15,885
Speaker 7:  actually first saw its dec a decline in

462
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:19,965
Speaker 7:  revenue and an operating loss. Okay. And so this was

463
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:23,485
Speaker 7:  when things started to go a little south. And I think, I don't know

464
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,725
Speaker 7:  exactly what's, you know, the timeline of, you know, how

465
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:31,525
Speaker 7:  long they'd been in talks. I mean Amazon and iRobot had always had quite

466
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:34,885
Speaker 7:  a close relationship. iRobot was one of the first companies to

467
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:38,685
Speaker 7:  successfully, and it did it very well implement Alexa voice

468
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:42,485
Speaker 7:  control. So they'd obviously been sort of partnering for a few years,

469
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:47,245
Speaker 7:  but it, it, I think it was 22 that

470
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,805
Speaker 7:  our robot was beginning to dip. And I can, I think you can imagine they were

471
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:54,685
Speaker 7:  like, well, you know, we've had a good run. We've been here almost 30

472
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:57,605
Speaker 7:  years. This is the time to kind of,

473
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:02,725
Speaker 7:  we need an an not an exit, but at least you know, we, we need

474
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:06,445
Speaker 7:  help to push to the next level. I think as I mentioned,

475
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:10,685
Speaker 7:  the hardware was an issue like developing and being able

476
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:14,605
Speaker 7:  to manufacture more impressive hardware. They,

477
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:17,725
Speaker 7:  they focused on the software, but they hadn't really pushed on the hardware

478
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:21,165
Speaker 7:  front. So they needed, I think they needed a cash injection. They had spent

479
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:24,765
Speaker 7:  so much time on r and d and a lot of their money went towards r and d.

480
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:27,645
Speaker 7:  But then you need the money, you need the capital to actually go out and

481
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:31,525
Speaker 7:  build this, this type of product. And sure, a natural partner for that

482
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,885
Speaker 7:  is a big multi-billion dollar corporation like

483
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:39,525
Speaker 7:  Amazon. Right. So, but then there was an awful lot of

484
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:43,205
Speaker 7:  concern when Amazon announced it was going to buy iRobot

485
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:47,125
Speaker 7:  that this would cause, well there were two big concerns. There was a privacy

486
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,925
Speaker 7:  concern and there was a regulatory concern

487
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:54,995
Speaker 7:  around whether this would kind of exterminate the

488
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:58,955
Speaker 7:  competition. My take is the competition was very

489
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:02,955
Speaker 7:  well established already and I don't, I mean iRobot had seen its

490
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:06,795
Speaker 7:  shared drop from, as we said, like almost 90% down to that.

491
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:10,595
Speaker 7:  I think at the point where iRobot, where Amazon was going to buy it was down

492
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:14,435
Speaker 7:  to like 33%. So it had taken a big

493
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:17,035
Speaker 7:  tumble even though it was still the market leader. Right. It was nowhere

494
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,835
Speaker 7:  near as dominant as it had been before.

495
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:22,435
Speaker 1:  And all signs were pointing to more competition, not less over

496
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:26,235
Speaker 7:  Time. Exactly. Yes. Yeah. I mean new robot, we so dreamy had just

497
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:30,035
Speaker 7:  entered the market in 2022 and that's now one of the top three.

498
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:34,115
Speaker 7:  So we've got or top four. So you've got Robo Rock, iRobot,

499
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:38,195
Speaker 7:  Ecova and Dreamy and then all the others. So yeah, it

500
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:41,965
Speaker 7:  was very much at a sort of tipping point for the company.

501
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,845
Speaker 7:  And I, Amazon came in with a

502
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:48,725
Speaker 7:  $1.7 billion deal, which

503
00:32:49,075 --> 00:32:52,845
Speaker 7:  then for the next, I think it was almost two years until it actually

504
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:57,485
Speaker 7:  fell apart under regulatory scrutiny. And it took the, it was the

505
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:01,525
Speaker 7:  EU specifically that caused the biggest delay in this. And that

506
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:05,565
Speaker 7:  two years of not knowing where the company was going, I

507
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:08,965
Speaker 7:  think really put a toll on production

508
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:12,365
Speaker 7:  manufacture. They had to take out a $200 million loan.

509
00:33:12,915 --> 00:33:16,485
Speaker 7:  They were really struggling and

510
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:19,645
Speaker 7:  without a clear path for the future. And then when the deal fell apart

511
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:24,125
Speaker 7:  is when everything kind of fell apart. The companies laid off almost half

512
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:28,165
Speaker 7:  its workforce. They had to the, the CEO Colin Eng,

513
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:32,565
Speaker 7:  he exited left and then they took over.

514
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:36,605
Speaker 7:  They had a new CEO come in. I think Colin Eng said this

515
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:40,445
Speaker 7:  when he, when he exited, he said, we need someone

516
00:33:40,445 --> 00:33:44,405
Speaker 7:  here who knows how to turn around the company in a financial, from a

517
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:47,845
Speaker 7:  financial perspective. And that is what the new CEO has been doing

518
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:52,485
Speaker 7:  by stripping back all of their other focus. So they don't, they, they got

519
00:33:52,485 --> 00:33:56,205
Speaker 7:  rid of all of the other elements that they had gone into in terms of

520
00:33:56,825 --> 00:34:00,165
Speaker 7:  the air purifiers. They'd also tried to do a robot lawnmower. They got rid

521
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:03,925
Speaker 7:  of anything that wasn't focused on cleaning your home, cut back on

522
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:07,285
Speaker 7:  research and development. I mean, it was like they basically gutted the company

523
00:34:07,305 --> 00:34:11,125
Speaker 7:  and just turned it to streamline on creating the

524
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:15,005
Speaker 7:  core product in the hope, I believe the understanding to sort of

525
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:18,205
Speaker 7:  bring its fortunes back. And this is where the new

526
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,845
Speaker 7:  product line has come from. So

527
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:24,885
Speaker 1:  I you've, you've traced two lines that I think are super interesting and

528
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:28,565
Speaker 1:  exactly land us on this recent announcement. 'cause on the one hand you have

529
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:33,565
Speaker 1:  Roomba, which was sort of, it was the thing and for a bunch of reasons

530
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:37,205
Speaker 1:  that I think were kind of the company's fault and kind of

531
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:40,245
Speaker 1:  outside of its control. Like the, the thing that happens where you get locked

532
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,045
Speaker 1:  up during two years of an acquisition that ultimately falls apart Yeah. Is

533
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:46,245
Speaker 1:  crushing. Yeah. Like we have seen companies go through it and It is hard

534
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:49,965
Speaker 1:  and It is there, there is only so much of it that you can actually do anything

535
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:53,925
Speaker 1:  about. But that's, so that's all happening. And meanwhile at the exact

536
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:57,925
Speaker 1:  same time, the rest of this market coming out of China and

537
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:01,845
Speaker 1:  elsewhere is growing faster than ever. The best is Yeah. Going totally wild.

538
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:03,885
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like you're saying, every time you turn around, there's a new company

539
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:06,645
Speaker 1:  with any name you've never heard of selling you one of these things, new

540
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:10,565
Speaker 1:  ideas, new products, the market's growing really fast. And it

541
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:14,445
Speaker 1:  seems like basically iRobot hires a new CEO who turns around

542
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,205
Speaker 1:  and goes, just make those Yeah, that's and that's how and that's where we

543
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:17,285
Speaker 1:  are.

544
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:22,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. He was like, I don't know if he said this, but my

545
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:25,965
Speaker 7:  impression is, okay, fine, you did great to this point, it's not

546
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:28,685
Speaker 7:  working anymore. Let's just start from scratch because that's what these

547
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:32,485
Speaker 7:  new robots look like. And it's like they've thrown away all of the innovation

548
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:36,565
Speaker 7:  and all of, in the hardware that Roomba had worked

549
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:40,445
Speaker 7:  on over the years, the software it seems like is still there, but

550
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:44,405
Speaker 7:  entirely new hardware. They are using a new

551
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:47,885
Speaker 7:  manufacturer too. And oh my goodness, these robots look like every other

552
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:50,925
Speaker 7:  robot out there that it makes it very hard for me to believe that these are

553
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:55,485
Speaker 7:  original designs. I mean, when I actually asked

554
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:58,445
Speaker 7:  iRobot this question, they said, well, they already copied us.

555
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:02,445
Speaker 7:  That's why we look like them because they copied us originally. I'm like,

556
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:06,565
Speaker 7:  yes, that was true like five years ago. But these new

557
00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:10,045
Speaker 7:  robots that Roomba launched this last week have the spinning mop pads. They

558
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:13,405
Speaker 7:  have the auto wash empty dry

559
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:17,645
Speaker 7:  docks, which Roomba did not have. And that's exactly

560
00:36:17,715 --> 00:36:21,365
Speaker 7:  what, you know, robo Rock invented that essentially. And the new Rob, the

561
00:36:21,365 --> 00:36:24,925
Speaker 7:  new Roomba docs look a lot like the original robo rock docs. So

562
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:29,165
Speaker 7:  it's, and they, I mean, from a business perspective, it's probably the right

563
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:32,765
Speaker 7:  move. It's what people are asking for. People want lidar,

564
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:36,165
Speaker 7:  they want suction specs like we were talking about when they're looking on

565
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:39,765
Speaker 7:  Amazon at which robot they're gonna buy. That's what they've been trained

566
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:44,365
Speaker 7:  to, to look for. But It is, it just feels like this,

567
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:48,245
Speaker 7:  I mean, robot vacuums have become commodities. Right? Right. That's

568
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:52,005
Speaker 7:  what, that's what's happened. And Ro Roomba is like, well we can still

569
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:56,045
Speaker 7:  salvage some of our business because we have a

570
00:36:56,045 --> 00:36:59,725
Speaker 7:  name that everyone recognizes. And now if we do

571
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:03,885
Speaker 7:  what everyone else is doing and less expensive, they are coming

572
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:07,765
Speaker 7:  in significantly lower than the competition right now. But then the

573
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:10,245
Speaker 7:  competition has arms. But

574
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:14,925
Speaker 7:  that's a separate thing, right? So yeah, there's, if they're able to turn

575
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:18,405
Speaker 7:  the company around, perhaps they could go back to the sort of

576
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:22,285
Speaker 7:  innovation and the spirit of entrepreneurship and,

577
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:25,685
Speaker 7:  and really exciting things that the company was able to do over the last

578
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:29,605
Speaker 7:  30 years and maybe invent the next great thing, you know, the stair

579
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:30,685
Speaker 7:  climbing robot vacuum.

580
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:36,405
Speaker 7:  But the competition is just so fierce. It's, it's really hard to

581
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:39,805
Speaker 7:  see a, a, a strong pathway for them. I think

582
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,965
Speaker 7:  I would like to have seen what happened if Amazon had bought the company.

583
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:48,165
Speaker 7:  I know there were, and I alluded this to this before, significant

584
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,845
Speaker 7:  concerns around things like privacy. These robot vacuums have cameras in

585
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:55,805
Speaker 7:  your home, roombas know everything about your

586
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:59,085
Speaker 7:  home, where, how many rooms you have, what furnace you have.

587
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:03,285
Speaker 7:  And this is probably one reason why Amazon wanted to buy them for that kind

588
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:07,245
Speaker 7:  of data. But when you take from the smart home

589
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:11,165
Speaker 7:  perspective, when you take that data and pair it with a

590
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:15,045
Speaker 7:  smart home platform with a voice assistant that's getting smarter

591
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:19,565
Speaker 7:  such as Alexa and the new Alexa plus, you could just see where that

592
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:23,445
Speaker 7:  symbiosis could have come together. And the what, that's

593
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:27,325
Speaker 7:  what the smart home needs is context. You need to know that I'm standing

594
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:31,365
Speaker 7:  in the kitchen and I've just dropped a pan of baked beans

595
00:38:31,365 --> 00:38:34,765
Speaker 7:  on the floor and you say, you know, Alexa clean up the beans

596
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:38,525
Speaker 7:  and it knows that you're in the kitchen because it has all of that context

597
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:42,485
Speaker 7:  from Right. Things like the Roomba, the maps, and then the Roomba just

598
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:46,365
Speaker 7:  trundles over and sucks up the beans, although it can't do that yet. But

599
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:49,485
Speaker 7:  that could have been the next innovation wet. Right. Vacuuming.

600
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:53,445
Speaker 7:  So I would, I would love to have seen where it could have gone.

601
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:57,005
Speaker 7:  There is still a chance that Roomba will get bought by

602
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:01,645
Speaker 7:  company. That's sort of the next, so the CEO

603
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:05,005
Speaker 7:  said in the last, in the financial reports that they last launched last week,

604
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:08,965
Speaker 7:  that the two biggest ways out of their current situation

605
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:12,805
Speaker 7:  is for lots of people to buy the new robots or

606
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:16,925
Speaker 7:  for it to get bought. And I wouldn't be surprised to see

607
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:20,605
Speaker 7:  a robot manufacturer actually come in and, and take them. I mean they did

608
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:24,485
Speaker 7:  actually used to have a partnership briefly with Ecova. So that could be

609
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:25,365
Speaker 7:  Oh, interesting one.

610
00:39:27,205 --> 00:39:29,325
Speaker 7:  I mean, Amazon's not gonna be allowed to buy, none of the big smart home

611
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:32,685
Speaker 7:  companies are gonna be allowed to buy it. So their, their pool has definitely

612
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:37,885
Speaker 7:  shrunk, but Right. And also you can buy them, basically buy them for parts

613
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:40,005
Speaker 7:  right now. So probably a really good deal.

614
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:43,085
Speaker 1:  Well, it's the name, right? It it really, it's the name does feel like everything

615
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:46,525
Speaker 1:  you just described is that this company has sort of

616
00:39:47,015 --> 00:39:50,925
Speaker 1:  nuked everything about itself that was unique except for the

617
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:54,725
Speaker 1:  name Roomba. But at this point, I, I think you're right that all of

618
00:39:54,915 --> 00:39:58,085
Speaker 1:  this market has become so commoditized

619
00:39:58,785 --> 00:40:02,645
Speaker 1:  and yet everybody still calls them Roombas. Right. Which, which is very powerful.

620
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:06,565
Speaker 1:  And so I think the, the theory you just described, right, where it's like,

621
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:09,805
Speaker 1:  okay, we're gonna come back all the way down to the market and we're just

622
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:12,445
Speaker 1:  gonna make the thing everybody else is making, but we're gonna call it Roomba.

623
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:17,085
Speaker 1:  It might work. Like I don't, I find that argument sort of a bummer,

624
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:20,125
Speaker 1:  right? Like it's, it's not a, it's not an interesting way to make product,

625
00:40:20,265 --> 00:40:23,885
Speaker 1:  but it might work. Yeah. And I, I can see how this company would get there.

626
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:27,565
Speaker 1:  I just think given the history of this company and the things they have been

627
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:31,485
Speaker 1:  trying to do, that's just sort of unfortunate because, and this is the

628
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:35,045
Speaker 1:  last thing I wanna talk about before I let you go. The, the, the thing you

629
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:38,245
Speaker 1:  just described, that this is the, the centerpiece of the smart home. That

630
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:41,605
Speaker 1:  this is the thing that gives the context that knows where you are and what

631
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:45,485
Speaker 1:  is going on. Like that's how we get to Rosie the

632
00:40:45,495 --> 00:40:49,445
Speaker 1:  robot, right? Like the thing iRobot didn't wanna build it has sort of

633
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:53,125
Speaker 1:  been building towards for 30 years

634
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:57,165
Speaker 1:  it, whether it wanted to or not, this is, this is what they're doing, right?

635
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:59,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And they, they've talked about wanting to build the, the operating

636
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:02,765
Speaker 1:  system for the smart home and be the centerpiece of the thing. The thing

637
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:06,525
Speaker 1:  that can move around inside of your house is so powerful.

638
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:09,285
Speaker 1:  Like you and I have talked about this before. If, if there is a thing that

639
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:12,885
Speaker 1:  can reach me physically, that becomes an incredibly

640
00:41:13,245 --> 00:41:16,325
Speaker 1:  powerful addition to my smart home. And so what I wonder is,

641
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:21,285
Speaker 1:  without iRobot pushing on this in the way that I think

642
00:41:21,285 --> 00:41:24,405
Speaker 1:  the company has sort of uniquely been able to for a really long time,

643
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:29,225
Speaker 1:  who is like, are, are we just at the point where a robot vacuum is a robot,

644
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:32,985
Speaker 1:  vacuum is a robot vacuum And, and we're going to just bail on the

645
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:35,925
Speaker 1:  idea that actually this is the robot that runs your smart home

646
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,805
Speaker 1:  because the Roomba can't do it.

647
00:41:39,895 --> 00:41:43,865
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean, so Amazon had started to, we, Amazon had its robot

648
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:47,705
Speaker 7:  the astro, which was basically this kind of idea. But if

649
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:51,585
Speaker 7:  it had been a vacuum, it would've been a much better product. Yeah. It

650
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:54,825
Speaker 7:  would've done things if it'd also be right because this is the problem. And

651
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:58,065
Speaker 7:  this was, this goes back to what Colin Angle said when he originally launched

652
00:41:58,365 --> 00:42:02,225
Speaker 7:  the company. It was like, robots need to have a purpose. They're not,

653
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:06,065
Speaker 7:  there's no point if it's just a personality in your home, right? I mean we've

654
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,745
Speaker 7:  seen that with all the robotic companies that have gone out of business

655
00:42:09,745 --> 00:42:12,905
Speaker 7:  because they, they built robots that didn't really do anything, but they

656
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,785
Speaker 7:  look cute or they had a personality. And so yeah, the, the

657
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:20,745
Speaker 7:  kind of the idea of having a robot in your home that is going to be

658
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:24,025
Speaker 7:  useful. I'm in two minds. I don't really personally think

659
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:27,465
Speaker 7:  the full humanoid robot is something anyone really wants,

660
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:32,665
Speaker 7:  but, you know, and I think it's a long way away as well. And I think we all

661
00:42:32,665 --> 00:42:36,385
Speaker 7:  would like something that can do the function of a Rosie the robot sooner

662
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:39,945
Speaker 7:  in our lifetimes, ideally. Yeah. So I think

663
00:42:41,085 --> 00:42:43,945
Speaker 7:  the next, I mean there there are a lot of companies that, that could step

664
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:46,865
Speaker 7:  up in this space. I think it could come from one of these robot manufacturers

665
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:50,385
Speaker 7:  we saw at CES this year, switch bot came out with its

666
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:54,865
Speaker 7:  multi-modal multifunctional robot vacuum that pushed different

667
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:58,705
Speaker 7:  devices around the house. So an air purifier, it

668
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:02,625
Speaker 7:  could bring you a drink, it could move your iPad around for

669
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:05,945
Speaker 7:  you. I mean it was kind of gimmicky, but it was, it's the starting point

670
00:43:06,925 --> 00:43:10,615
Speaker 7:  of a multifunctional robot that

671
00:43:10,615 --> 00:43:14,535
Speaker 7:  perhaps whether Colin Angle and iRobot didn't want to

672
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:18,455
Speaker 7:  develop the Rosie the robot originally. I think they've definitely built

673
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:22,135
Speaker 7:  the foundations for it and it's the intelligence that's important as much

674
00:43:22,155 --> 00:43:26,095
Speaker 7:  as the function and that, you know, really is where they laid the foundations

675
00:43:26,095 --> 00:43:29,975
Speaker 7:  because the machine learning that these robots, the difference between the

676
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:33,415
Speaker 7:  one that I had in my home in 2003 and the ones I have in my home

677
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:37,735
Speaker 7:  today is exponential. And they are so much smarter.

678
00:43:38,835 --> 00:43:42,735
Speaker 7:  And that you can see the long in the long tail of where that

679
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:45,535
Speaker 7:  could take us could be really exciting and really interesting.

680
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:48,495
Speaker 1:  All right Jen, thank you so much for doing this to me. This was really fun.

681
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:50,495
Speaker 7:  You're welcome. Thanks. I enjoyed myself.

682
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:55,055
Speaker 1:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna

683
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:58,615
Speaker 1:  talk about e-readers love talking about e-readers. We'll be right back.

684
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:19,165
Speaker 1:  goods had changed. They deleted this tool that would let you easily

685
00:46:19,685 --> 00:46:23,565
Speaker 1:  download your books to put them on a new device and also at

686
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:24,005
Speaker 1:  the same time

687
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:05,525
Speaker 1:  I just forget I'd get his read on things. And we started by talking about

688
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:09,205
Speaker 1:  devices because one of the things I find odd about e-readers

689
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:13,525
Speaker 1:  is that they're both wonderful devices and very good at the thing that they

690
00:47:13,525 --> 00:47:17,365
Speaker 1:  do well. But it doesn't seem like they've changed in a sort of

691
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:20,845
Speaker 1:  meaningful way in a really long time. Like if you look at your

692
00:47:21,015 --> 00:47:24,925
Speaker 1:  phone now and your phone eight years ago, they're very

693
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,405
Speaker 1:  different. And your laptop or your smartwatch or pick another gadget,

694
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:32,965
Speaker 1:  e-readers have changed in small ways but don't feel like they've changed

695
00:47:32,985 --> 00:47:36,125
Speaker 1:  in big ways in a really, really, really, really, really long time.

696
00:47:36,785 --> 00:47:37,925
Speaker 1:  And I just asked Michael why

697
00:47:38,915 --> 00:47:42,595
Speaker 11:  I, I think there are a couple of factors. One is just screen innovation

698
00:47:42,615 --> 00:47:45,275
Speaker 11:  is super hard and screen innovation,

699
00:47:45,965 --> 00:47:49,675
Speaker 11:  especially in this low power ePaper space that we're in

700
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:54,075
Speaker 11:  is even harder both because of the constraints.

701
00:47:54,225 --> 00:47:58,155
Speaker 11:  Like your, you know, the whole idea is you should have a screen that

702
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:02,035
Speaker 11:  you can charge once, you know, in weeks and it, you know,

703
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:06,195
Speaker 11:  continues to work. And at the same time, unlike say

704
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:10,955
Speaker 11:  OLES or LCD panels or anything else, the volumes aren't

705
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:14,955
Speaker 11:  giant. Hmm. So it's not like you're amortizing research out

706
00:48:15,065 --> 00:48:18,195
Speaker 11:  over 400 million screens a year.

707
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:22,675
Speaker 11:  Sure. So, so it's like us and our friends in Seattle and a few folks in

708
00:48:22,675 --> 00:48:26,595
Speaker 11:  China and like we are the market that are, that

709
00:48:26,595 --> 00:48:30,195
Speaker 11:  are creating the volume for this. So there's a certain incrementality to

710
00:48:30,195 --> 00:48:33,995
Speaker 11:  the innovation that comes from that. But then beyond that, there was just

711
00:48:34,025 --> 00:48:37,755
Speaker 11:  this slow ramp on getting black and white

712
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:41,355
Speaker 11:  better. So if we look back over the last 10 years, you'll see this

713
00:48:41,745 --> 00:48:45,675
Speaker 11:  kind of slow marching forward of we had Ian Pearl screens and then we had

714
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:49,675
Speaker 11:  Ian Carter screens, we had part 1100 Carta 1200, like sort of these little

715
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:53,435
Speaker 11:  steps while they were also working on color.

716
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:56,955
Speaker 11:  And so like a lot of the color technology we're seeing in the market now

717
00:48:57,615 --> 00:49:00,555
Speaker 11:  has been in labs and in

718
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:04,235
Speaker 11:  manufacturing paths now for like four or five years.

719
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:08,435
Speaker 11:  It's just that they couldn't get that combination of performance and price.

720
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:12,195
Speaker 11:  Right. So, you know, we had screens that look

721
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:16,115
Speaker 11:  like the screens that we now have out in the market with

722
00:49:16,115 --> 00:49:19,795
Speaker 11:  like Cobo, Libra color, Cobo Clara color, those screens are around,

723
00:49:20,095 --> 00:49:23,675
Speaker 11:  you know, three years ago or more. But they were still astronomically expensive.

724
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:27,595
Speaker 11:  Hmm. And so until they could get the manufacturing right and they could

725
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:31,235
Speaker 11:  get the yields right and they could get the prices right, we just couldn't

726
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:34,635
Speaker 11:  offer them at a price that anybody would find really interesting. But what's

727
00:49:34,745 --> 00:49:38,675
Speaker 11:  kind of cool now is there's a whole bunch of stuff that's

728
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:42,395
Speaker 11:  just sitting on the horizon that not just from

729
00:49:42,425 --> 00:49:45,955
Speaker 11:  like yank the manufacturer, but from all of these other companies that have

730
00:49:45,955 --> 00:49:49,875
Speaker 11:  started to work on low power screens. And so you have some contenders now

731
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:52,715
Speaker 11:  and contenders mean competition, right? Competition means things start to

732
00:49:52,715 --> 00:49:56,675
Speaker 11:  move faster and you start to get some price pressure. So I think after having

733
00:49:57,035 --> 00:50:00,755
Speaker 11:  y almost like a decade of very incremental progress,

734
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:05,315
Speaker 11:  we now start to see a whole like, we're gonna have some really exciting

735
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:09,275
Speaker 11:  years over the next few years as all of this stuff lands. So you get that

736
00:50:09,295 --> 00:50:13,075
Speaker 11:  far then can you get to something that is getting closer to

737
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:17,755
Speaker 11:  the kinds of refresh rates that you see in LCD panels, for

738
00:50:17,755 --> 00:50:20,875
Speaker 11:  example. And then like then you can make the interactions on the screens

739
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:24,835
Speaker 11:  better than you can make them right now. But it's interesting 'cause I

740
00:50:24,835 --> 00:50:28,815
Speaker 11:  don't ever see us coming to a place where you have like

741
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:32,575
Speaker 11:  the, the regular screen panel world and the,

742
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:36,895
Speaker 11:  the, the einer ePaper world converging because

743
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:40,655
Speaker 11:  the use cases are so different and not just for, you know, people like

744
00:50:41,035 --> 00:50:44,935
Speaker 11:  you and I who have a Samsung frame and like, you know, like are

745
00:50:44,935 --> 00:50:48,495
Speaker 11:  willing to make certain compromises in our TVs, but the

746
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:52,415
Speaker 11:  the extent to which you want a low power device on one side

747
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:56,495
Speaker 11:  and you want perfect color fidelity on

748
00:50:56,495 --> 00:51:00,295
Speaker 11:  the other, right. Just kind of the, the technology just diverges

749
00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:01,735
Speaker 11:  as you're trying to solve those two problems.

750
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:06,575
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And it, it does seem like part of the, I don't know if it's

751
00:51:06,575 --> 00:51:10,335
Speaker 1:  a challenge or not, but sort of the truth of this market is just that everyone

752
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:14,255
Speaker 1:  decided a while ago to make a certain set of decisions. Like

753
00:51:14,255 --> 00:51:17,735
Speaker 1:  we, we hit a price point pretty quickly with a lot of this stuff where I

754
00:51:17,735 --> 00:51:20,135
Speaker 1:  think it's like, my, my question to you on the screen stuff is gonna be,

755
00:51:20,135 --> 00:51:24,055
Speaker 1:  well, why not just sell one of these awesome color screens that was

756
00:51:24,055 --> 00:51:27,975
Speaker 1:  available in a $600 Cobo? And I, I assume

757
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:30,895
Speaker 1:  the response is because absolutely nobody would buy it, which is like, fair

758
00:51:30,895 --> 00:51:34,775
Speaker 1:  enough. That is true. Sure. But I think it's, it's a really interesting

759
00:51:34,865 --> 00:51:38,055
Speaker 1:  piece of this because I think like you look at almost any other category

760
00:51:38,055 --> 00:51:42,015
Speaker 1:  and there's this like massive price banding depending on how new the

761
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,975
Speaker 1:  technology is and how many features you get and how much stuff you get. And

762
00:51:44,975 --> 00:51:48,775
Speaker 1:  the, the sort of acceptable set of prices in e-readers is so

763
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:52,655
Speaker 1:  comparatively tiny that I feel like it does force you into kind

764
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:56,095
Speaker 1:  of strange boxes where you're like, okay, we have to get oh yeah, this sweet

765
00:51:56,125 --> 00:52:00,095
Speaker 1:  spot of technology in order to have

766
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:03,135
Speaker 1:  it hit this price point. Because if we, if we raise it a hundred dollars

767
00:52:03,235 --> 00:52:06,935
Speaker 1:  to do this amazing new thing, nobody will buy it. There's just no other market

768
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:07,575
Speaker 1:  really like that.

769
00:52:07,915 --> 00:52:11,535
Speaker 11:  And Well, it's true. And I mean some of that I think we are

770
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:15,255
Speaker 11:  responsible for in some ways, when Cobo came into 2010, we

771
00:52:15,575 --> 00:52:19,535
Speaker 11:  repriced the E Inc market. So we were the first ones to bring

772
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:22,935
Speaker 11:  in a sub hundred and $50 e-reader, right? Up until then

773
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:26,255
Speaker 11:  e-readers were 250, 350, you know,

774
00:52:26,255 --> 00:52:29,615
Speaker 11:  $400. And part of that was just wanting

775
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:34,015
Speaker 11:  it to be accessible, not to this super narrow

776
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:37,935
Speaker 11:  niche of enthusiasts, but just like, let's make this

777
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:42,535
Speaker 11:  a general part of the book market. Hmm. And then even again, we

778
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:45,735
Speaker 11:  were the ones who went, okay, well having done that, let's now look at premium

779
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:48,655
Speaker 11:  e readers, so let's make the screens bigger and let's put waterproofing

780
00:52:48,655 --> 00:52:51,935
Speaker 11:  on them and you know, and all of that kind of stuff. So to walk that price

781
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,815
Speaker 11:  point up again, but you're right, there is a, there's a

782
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:59,735
Speaker 11:  certain limit that you bump into where you've kind of got like the

783
00:52:59,735 --> 00:53:03,495
Speaker 11:  bottom of the iPad market and the top of the, the e-reader market.

784
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:07,095
Speaker 11:  And there's a, there's a certain point of friction in there that psychologically

785
00:53:07,095 --> 00:53:11,015
Speaker 11:  people seem to bump into and, and so that in a way becomes like the pricing

786
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:15,015
Speaker 11:  box that we work in. But it's, but there's

787
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:18,975
Speaker 11:  also something about, I think selling a single purpose device. Like

788
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:22,735
Speaker 11:  we really just do want this to do one thing. And I do think that

789
00:53:23,165 --> 00:53:26,565
Speaker 11:  affects people's, like mental pricing math a little bit.

790
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:30,045
Speaker 11:  And you're also selling a small thing. So it's, you know, it's not like

791
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:33,605
Speaker 11:  we're, you know, we're selling a, you know, a giant 4K television that's

792
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:36,725
Speaker 11:  going to, that's gonna cover someone's wall. But

793
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:40,355
Speaker 11:  we do have some of that same kind of value

794
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:44,955
Speaker 11:  psychology going on. Like a person who reads an on an

795
00:53:44,995 --> 00:53:48,915
Speaker 11:  e-reader isn't a person who reads one book a year, mostly, like they're

796
00:53:48,915 --> 00:53:52,515
Speaker 11:  a person who reads a book every week. And so you are selling to that

797
00:53:53,035 --> 00:53:56,835
Speaker 11:  enthusiast the same way that someone will ditch

798
00:53:57,055 --> 00:54:00,555
Speaker 11:  the, you know, the earbuds that come with their phone and buy great

799
00:54:00,555 --> 00:54:03,675
Speaker 11:  headphones, you know, because they love listening to music. So you've got,

800
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:07,515
Speaker 11:  like, you've got some of that enthusiast logic going on,

801
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:11,155
Speaker 11:  but it only allows us to push it so far. So yeah, we work with it.

802
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:15,035
Speaker 1:  If the goal is we, you're reading books and I, I want to come back to why

803
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:17,275
Speaker 1:  it's just books, because I don't think it's just books and I want to convince

804
00:54:17,275 --> 00:54:20,995
Speaker 1:  you that it's not. But if It is just books, how

805
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:23,875
Speaker 1:  big do you think that is? Like what does that mean you have to do? Well,

806
00:54:23,985 --> 00:54:27,875
Speaker 11:  Sure. And just to touch on, on what you were saying earlier, I,

807
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:31,755
Speaker 11:  I also have a theory on why we've ended up with

808
00:54:32,385 --> 00:54:35,875
Speaker 11:  this space being defined the way It is. And it's from some very particular

809
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:39,835
Speaker 11:  technology choices that got made in about like interesting 2010. So we can

810
00:54:39,835 --> 00:54:43,595
Speaker 11:  come back to that. Okay. But like, you know, what has to be done

811
00:54:43,745 --> 00:54:47,555
Speaker 11:  well with this comes so

812
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:50,955
Speaker 11:  much to like, what is the experience that people want to have when they

813
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,595
Speaker 11:  pick one of these up? You know, this is the kind of thing we actually do

814
00:54:53,755 --> 00:54:56,275
Speaker 11:  research on and we like bring people together and we interview them and

815
00:54:56,275 --> 00:54:59,955
Speaker 11:  we survey them and you really have like

816
00:55:00,995 --> 00:55:04,955
Speaker 11:  four-ish, you know, kinds of customers. You know, you know, you have those

817
00:55:04,955 --> 00:55:08,875
Speaker 11:  people who are reading for Escape who are just like, you know,

818
00:55:09,135 --> 00:55:12,915
Speaker 11:  the, you know, fiction or a biography. It's taking

819
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:16,235
Speaker 11:  me away. It's taking me out of this place and putting me somewhere else.

820
00:55:17,295 --> 00:55:21,165
Speaker 11:  And that requires both an extremely

821
00:55:21,555 --> 00:55:25,285
Speaker 11:  inobtrusive technology sitting behind it. Like you just have to get everything

822
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:28,285
Speaker 11:  out of the way and an absolute

823
00:55:29,155 --> 00:55:32,765
Speaker 11:  rock solid reliability in the experience itself because any

824
00:55:32,915 --> 00:55:36,525
Speaker 11:  problem jars you out of that moment. And you go from having

825
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:40,725
Speaker 11:  a beautiful moment to an annoying moment, like in an instant. And then

826
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:43,725
Speaker 11:  you've got the, you know, you have the people who are

827
00:55:44,395 --> 00:55:47,885
Speaker 11:  reading more for information or for education

828
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:52,245
Speaker 11:  and that's a different set of technology problems as

829
00:55:52,245 --> 00:55:55,125
Speaker 11:  well as a different set of interactions. Like the reason that we started

830
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:59,085
Speaker 11:  putting stylists in e-readers came from

831
00:55:59,095 --> 00:56:02,605
Speaker 11:  interviews that we were doing nonfiction readers and we were trying to solve

832
00:56:02,635 --> 00:56:06,405
Speaker 11:  this like sales mystery of why are eBooks so

833
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:10,445
Speaker 11:  overweighted into fiction, relative

834
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:12,925
Speaker 11:  to nonfiction. Oh, fascinating. 'cause we could kind of like, we can kind

835
00:56:12,925 --> 00:56:16,125
Speaker 11:  of look at what happens in a regular physical store

836
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:20,365
Speaker 11:  and how they sell, and then we look at what we're selling, like fix it so

837
00:56:20,365 --> 00:56:24,165
Speaker 11:  much higher. And as we to people when I'm, when

838
00:56:24,185 --> 00:56:27,205
Speaker 11:  I'm reading something to engage with it for information,

839
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:32,005
Speaker 11:  I'm not just trying to like put myself in the story. I'm actively

840
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:35,005
Speaker 11:  engaging with it. I'm highlighting and I'm making notes in the margins and

841
00:56:35,065 --> 00:56:38,845
Speaker 11:  I'm like, I'm trying to kind of consume it and extract things from it

842
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:42,725
Speaker 11:  at the same time. And that's hard for me to do with an ebook unless

843
00:56:42,785 --> 00:56:46,085
Speaker 11:  we give you some extra tools to do that. So let's make

844
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:50,005
Speaker 11:  highlighting and notes and all of this stuff become a

845
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:53,885
Speaker 11:  thing that you can do as easily. Plus like there's some benefits to that.

846
00:56:54,275 --> 00:56:56,485
Speaker 11:  It's not just stuck on the page. You can take it off and do something else

847
00:56:56,485 --> 00:57:00,125
Speaker 11:  with it. So different use cases for different kinds of readers.

848
00:57:00,545 --> 00:57:04,365
Speaker 11:  And there are some, as we dig into that, that also explain

849
00:57:04,365 --> 00:57:08,125
Speaker 11:  places where eBooks just haven't become as popular,

850
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:12,605
Speaker 11:  like reading for children. And we thought, okay, color screens

851
00:57:12,605 --> 00:57:16,445
Speaker 11:  amazing and finally get children's books. No, and not

852
00:57:16,445 --> 00:57:19,885
Speaker 11:  because they don't look good, you know, and we also have them on apps. You

853
00:57:19,885 --> 00:57:23,165
Speaker 11:  could read them on an iPad or an Android tablet or whatever. No, because

854
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:27,365
Speaker 11:  children's books live in the gift economy and they're what parents give

855
00:57:27,365 --> 00:57:31,325
Speaker 11:  to children. And you want to walk into a child's room and see books

856
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:34,245
Speaker 11:  all around you as a sign that you are a good parent and they may grow up

857
00:57:34,245 --> 00:57:38,165
Speaker 11:  to be literate one day. And like all, all of that

858
00:57:39,235 --> 00:57:42,565
Speaker 11:  kind of works against the idea of having that be something that you read

859
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:46,525
Speaker 11:  in digital. And that's okay. And the same with all of those books that

860
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:46,805
Speaker 11:  are

861
00:57:48,335 --> 00:57:52,245
Speaker 11:  loved for the object that they are as much as for the content

862
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:54,925
Speaker 11:  that they have. You know, the books that you have on your coffee table and

863
00:57:54,925 --> 00:57:58,885
Speaker 11:  have on your shelves exist with a whole different set of

864
00:57:58,885 --> 00:58:02,725
Speaker 11:  values behind them in addition to the stuff that's in them. And it's funny,

865
00:58:02,785 --> 00:58:06,605
Speaker 11:  if you look at a bookstore, you can kind of look at

866
00:58:06,605 --> 00:58:10,005
Speaker 11:  how the books themselves are produced and get a sense of their likelihood

867
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:13,725
Speaker 11:  of getting consumed in digital. Like the more cheaply

868
00:58:13,725 --> 00:58:17,565
Speaker 11:  it's put together, like, you know, the romance novel and the,

869
00:58:17,905 --> 00:58:21,685
Speaker 11:  you know, crime thriller that's just got covers wrapped around it. It's

870
00:58:21,685 --> 00:58:25,405
Speaker 11:  all about the story. Those have gone to digital much more quickly

871
00:58:25,675 --> 00:58:29,285
Speaker 11:  than the beautiful book that's about, you know, architecture and

872
00:58:29,565 --> 00:58:33,365
Speaker 11:  Sure. Yeah. So different use cases kind of drive you into digital

873
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:37,285
Speaker 11:  in different ways. And it's also why print has

874
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:41,525
Speaker 11:  coexisted much more that like kind of harmoniously with

875
00:58:41,525 --> 00:58:45,445
Speaker 11:  digital than the other big format shifts that we've seen like with music

876
00:58:45,445 --> 00:58:46,005
Speaker 11:  and with video.

877
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:50,545
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Is there, is there a world in which you think

878
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:54,465
Speaker 1:  digital eventually takes that whole spectrum? Like I, I think

879
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:58,385
Speaker 1:  about EII have a 2-year-old and we have a hundred million books in his room.

880
00:58:58,385 --> 00:59:01,745
Speaker 1:  Awesome. And all the ones he likes best are the ones where it's like the

881
00:59:01,745 --> 00:59:05,105
Speaker 1:  train pops up off the thing and he can play with it as he moves. And it's

882
00:59:05,105 --> 00:59:09,065
Speaker 1:  like, I, I'm never getting that on an e-reader or an iPad or anything. Like,

883
00:59:09,065 --> 00:59:12,785
Speaker 1:  there's no screen that physically can do that thing that turns out to be

884
00:59:12,785 --> 00:59:15,785
Speaker 1:  very important. So is there, is there a spectrum of this where you're like,

885
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:19,305
Speaker 1:  okay, in this giant sort of sweep of what a book can be,

886
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:22,645
Speaker 1:  we think digital can do sort of, of, you know, the middle two thirds or whatever?

887
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:26,725
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I, I think there's a long-term and a midterm view to it. Like

888
00:59:26,785 --> 00:59:30,205
Speaker 11:  the long-term view is like, do you still believe that

889
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:34,405
Speaker 11:  50 years from now we're gonna be cutting down trees and pressing ink into

890
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,685
Speaker 11:  them and that's gonna be the way that we move reward around.

891
00:59:38,265 --> 00:59:42,165
Speaker 11:  And I think if you take the timeline out that far, people go,

892
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:46,125
Speaker 11:  eh, probably not. And so then you're just arguing about where

893
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:49,565
Speaker 11:  the inflection points are. That might kind of tip you over to that. Sure.

894
00:59:49,615 --> 00:59:53,565
Speaker 11:  There will definitely always be some physical books that people wanna have

895
00:59:53,765 --> 00:59:56,845
Speaker 11:  'cause they're beautiful and because they say something about who we are

896
00:59:56,945 --> 00:59:59,005
Speaker 11:  and they create an environment that we like.

897
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,725
Speaker 1:  Well that's the stuff you're talking about where like the object is actually

898
01:00:01,725 --> 01:00:05,685
Speaker 1:  more important than the book. Like almost calling it a book. And it's the

899
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,845
Speaker 1:  same with like a lot of coffee table books and stuff, right? Like, it's not,

900
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:12,205
Speaker 1:  that's a piece of art as much as It is like a bunch of words in a

901
01:00:12,205 --> 01:00:13,605
Speaker 1:  row on pages or

902
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:17,365
Speaker 11:  The design is a part of the content and the, and the

903
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:20,285
Speaker 11:  design amplifies the message that the author's trying to send.

904
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:25,325
Speaker 11:  What was cool about seeing publishing react to digital, like

905
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:29,285
Speaker 11:  through the 2010s and into the 2020s was all of a sudden, like everybody

906
01:00:29,285 --> 01:00:33,045
Speaker 11:  stepped up their game on making books just more

907
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:36,925
Speaker 11:  beautiful physically. So like you, you know,

908
01:00:36,985 --> 01:00:40,925
Speaker 11:  you didn't have walls of cheap paperbacks anymore. Like, and, and now even

909
01:00:40,925 --> 01:00:44,045
Speaker 11:  more you've got the idea of books as collectibles and you've got special

910
01:00:44,045 --> 01:00:47,485
Speaker 11:  editions and all this other stuff, and it's, it's publishers

911
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:51,045
Speaker 11:  frantically trying to figure out the balance between keeping bookstores

912
01:00:51,295 --> 01:00:55,285
Speaker 11:  alive and relevant while more things go to online. And then

913
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:59,325
Speaker 11:  eBooks are in there, like carving out certain segments. So they're doing

914
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:02,605
Speaker 11:  a delicate dance. And then at the same time we're trying to say, well, hey,

915
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:05,525
Speaker 11:  we just put out color screens and all of a sudden cookbooks look gorgeous

916
01:01:06,385 --> 01:01:10,165
Speaker 11:  in on an eReader. And they do. And so there was a segment

917
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:14,005
Speaker 11:  where we kind of couldn't like really meet the customer where they wanted

918
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:17,965
Speaker 11:  to be, and now we can. And so all of a sudden you see, you know, more

919
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,005
Speaker 11:  digital cookbook sales happening, which is cool.

920
01:01:20,865 --> 01:01:24,275
Speaker 1:  Yeah. What are you seeing in terms of what color in particular is doing?

921
01:01:24,275 --> 01:01:27,915
Speaker 1:  Because I think one thing I've heard from book people over the years is that

922
01:01:27,915 --> 01:01:31,795
Speaker 1:  part of the challenge of e-readers is that they're so customizable

923
01:01:31,795 --> 01:01:34,595
Speaker 1:  in the sense that screens are different and people pick different font sizes

924
01:01:34,595 --> 01:01:38,395
Speaker 1:  and people pick different colors and margins. And so attempting to be

925
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:41,795
Speaker 1:  sort of opinionated and thoughtful about ebook design was kind of a waste

926
01:01:41,795 --> 01:01:45,595
Speaker 1:  of time. My sense is with color, maybe not with everything, but

927
01:01:45,595 --> 01:01:49,435
Speaker 1:  with some things that would give people a chance to

928
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:53,435
Speaker 1:  put some more work into how those things look and feel. Are we starting to

929
01:01:53,435 --> 01:01:55,075
Speaker 1:  see that as color grows?

930
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:59,155
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I, I, I mean, at the most basic level, we had

931
01:01:59,155 --> 01:02:01,795
Speaker 11:  publishers who used to take like color images out and turn them into black

932
01:02:01,795 --> 01:02:04,315
Speaker 11:  and white and send those to us. Sure. Like just to keep like file sizes

933
01:02:04,315 --> 01:02:06,955
Speaker 11:  down and everything else. It's like, nope. Like we would like the whole

934
01:02:06,955 --> 01:02:10,835
Speaker 11:  thing now give, give us that. But it's a

935
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:14,775
Speaker 11:  little bit of everything. It's suddenly more graphic novel sales,

936
01:02:15,415 --> 01:02:19,365
Speaker 11:  suddenly more cookbook sales. Like maybe not the gorgeous coffee table book,

937
01:02:19,705 --> 01:02:22,845
Speaker 11:  but the book that's about knitting patterns or the book that's about mending

938
01:02:22,845 --> 01:02:26,525
Speaker 11:  your own clothes, that was like kind of color photo imagery

939
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:30,645
Speaker 11:  is suddenly more saleable. So like all of those are ticking up. And then

940
01:02:30,645 --> 01:02:34,345
Speaker 11:  there's just something about like, you can now see your library in color

941
01:02:34,605 --> 01:02:38,425
Speaker 11:  and like people like publishers sweat

942
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:42,025
Speaker 11:  about covers for a reason. Like they're, you know, they're gorgeous, they

943
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:45,945
Speaker 11:  should be. And, and now we can show that to people. And so that all

944
01:02:46,035 --> 01:02:49,825
Speaker 11:  helps as well. And then it's, it's very different from market

945
01:02:49,845 --> 01:02:53,585
Speaker 11:  to market too. So like what we're talking about mostly is what I call kind

946
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:57,505
Speaker 11:  of like North American publisher behavior. Sure. You know, we look

947
01:02:57,525 --> 01:03:01,265
Speaker 11:  at some markets like Japan is not an e-reader market at all, and

948
01:03:01,295 --> 01:03:04,865
Speaker 11:  it's like, it's a huge one for us, but it's all happening on

949
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:08,665
Speaker 11:  smartphones and their colors never been a problem and it

950
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:09,225
Speaker 11:  doesn't change at all.

951
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:13,025
Speaker 1:  Right. And I think the, the smartphone thing is really interesting to me

952
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:16,505
Speaker 1:  because one of the main reasons I hear from people

953
01:03:17,095 --> 01:03:21,025
Speaker 1:  that the, the people who are mad that ebook readers aren't better, I would

954
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:23,745
Speaker 1:  say overwhelmingly what they say is because all the companies that make them

955
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:27,545
Speaker 1:  are bookstores first and device makers second. And I think

956
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:31,345
Speaker 1:  to a large extent, I, I think that's, that's, I don't know if that's true

957
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:34,185
Speaker 1:  for you. I don't know if you feel that way, but I think like Amazon I know

958
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:37,185
Speaker 1:  feels that way. Sure. I can tell you with great confidence. Yep. Amazon cares

959
01:03:37,185 --> 01:03:41,065
Speaker 1:  a lot more about selling books than selling Kindles. And then,

960
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:44,425
Speaker 1:  and I think especially when you're starting to think about, okay, how does

961
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:46,905
Speaker 1:  this experience work on smartphones? How does it work on the web reader?

962
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:50,865
Speaker 1:  You get to the point where it's like, okay, we actually can't just be

963
01:03:50,865 --> 01:03:54,705
Speaker 1:  focused on the one thing in part because customers want it to be

964
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:57,785
Speaker 1:  lots of different places. And in part because that's not what our business

965
01:03:58,165 --> 01:04:01,025
Speaker 1:  is, is It, is it possible to

966
01:04:01,955 --> 01:04:05,205
Speaker 1:  have your cake and eat it too in that sense? Like, can you be a great hardware

967
01:04:05,405 --> 01:04:08,965
Speaker 1:  business that is also mostly a really good bookstore? Or do you end up having

968
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,365
Speaker 1:  to choose one or the other?

969
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:14,045
Speaker 11:  No, you totally can't. Like that's, that's the part that I don't think I

970
01:04:14,045 --> 01:04:17,765
Speaker 11:  get, like the whole, in some ways we treat them as two

971
01:04:17,765 --> 01:04:21,165
Speaker 11:  different things, or at least we treat them as two different objectives.

972
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:24,845
Speaker 11:  Like, we have a lot of people who buy, who buy a co we reader

973
01:04:25,225 --> 01:04:28,565
Speaker 11:  who never buy anything from us at all. They hook it up to a public library,

974
01:04:29,235 --> 01:04:33,165
Speaker 11:  they bring their own books along, they muck around on

975
01:04:33,165 --> 01:04:36,405
Speaker 11:  the internet, they find things that they probably should have bought. Like

976
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:38,885
Speaker 11:  all, all we know, all of these things happen purely

977
01:04:38,885 --> 01:04:42,605
Speaker 1:  Legally and correctly with no problems always the right way.

978
01:04:42,705 --> 01:04:43,125
Speaker 1:  Public

979
01:04:43,185 --> 01:04:46,525
Speaker 11:  Domain, it's exactly Jane Eyre and everybody's

980
01:04:46,525 --> 01:04:47,965
Speaker 1:  Just reading Frankenstein. Yes,

981
01:04:47,965 --> 01:04:50,925
Speaker 11:  Exactly. Everyone is reading pride and prejudice all day long and they have

982
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:54,525
Speaker 11:  their own special version that they bring to us. And so those people

983
01:04:54,985 --> 01:04:58,765
Speaker 11:  bought an e-reader, they like, they shelled out their cash and that's

984
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:02,645
Speaker 11:  like, that's the way they're engaging with us and we

985
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:05,965
Speaker 11:  need them to be happy even though they never hit the store at all.

986
01:05:06,465 --> 01:05:10,365
Speaker 11:  And then at the same time, we are a bookstore and we do sell the content

987
01:05:10,465 --> 01:05:14,285
Speaker 11:  and whether that's the actual e-commerce experience itself

988
01:05:14,505 --> 01:05:18,125
Speaker 11:  or running Cobo plus the subscription service or running

989
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:22,005
Speaker 11:  Cobo writing life, like our self-publishing program, like all of that stuff

990
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:24,885
Speaker 11:  has to work together to make a really great store

991
01:05:25,595 --> 01:05:29,405
Speaker 11:  because that's just another part of the flywheel that

992
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:32,005
Speaker 11:  we're trying to keep spinning and they need to work together really well

993
01:05:32,005 --> 01:05:35,925
Speaker 11:  too. So that's why we don't just treat it as, you

994
01:05:35,925 --> 01:05:39,605
Speaker 11:  know, kind of a dumb hardware platform. Like we wanna thoughtfully integrate

995
01:05:39,605 --> 01:05:40,445
Speaker 11:  those two things together.

996
01:05:41,035 --> 01:05:43,645
Speaker 1:  Sure. But like the, the thing Amazon always says, right, is like they, we,

997
01:05:43,645 --> 01:05:46,005
Speaker 1:  we don't make money when you buy our gadgets, we make money, you when you

998
01:05:46,005 --> 01:05:47,365
Speaker 1:  use them. And in the Kindle's case, oh,

999
01:05:47,365 --> 01:05:49,325
Speaker 11:  They totally make money when they you buy,

1000
01:05:49,955 --> 01:05:50,245
Speaker 1:  They

1001
01:05:50,645 --> 01:05:51,165
Speaker 11:  Absolutely do.

1002
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:56,005
Speaker 1:  Fair enough. But I think that that's, that seems to be

1003
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:59,445
Speaker 1:  at least sort of philosophically the way that they think about it, right?

1004
01:05:59,445 --> 01:06:02,605
Speaker 1:  They're like, they are more interested in giving you a thing that you will

1005
01:06:02,605 --> 01:06:06,365
Speaker 1:  buy books on than in giving you a thing to happily

1006
01:06:07,075 --> 01:06:10,885
Speaker 1:  read things that didn't come from Amazon, which is objectively true given

1007
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:13,605
Speaker 1:  all of their product decisions that we should talk about. Yes.

1008
01:06:15,165 --> 01:06:18,585
Speaker 1:  Are you, are, is that, is that not the case for you? Like how do you design

1009
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:22,585
Speaker 1:  a business around this so that that's not the case so that you

1010
01:06:22,585 --> 01:06:25,345
Speaker 1:  don't have to force me to buy 10 books before this thing makes sense for

1011
01:06:25,345 --> 01:06:26,545
Speaker 1:  you as a business? Well,

1012
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:30,505
Speaker 11:  Part of It is just the economics of e readers themselves. Like

1013
01:06:30,645 --> 01:06:33,585
Speaker 11:  unlike laptop screens or smartphone screens or anything else,

1014
01:06:34,175 --> 01:06:38,145
Speaker 11:  they're expensive to make. Like those e ink panels are

1015
01:06:38,205 --> 01:06:42,105
Speaker 11:  not cheap and make the, like the margins

1016
01:06:42,105 --> 01:06:45,825
Speaker 11:  on e-readers relatively thin. And one of the reasons that

1017
01:06:46,525 --> 01:06:50,305
Speaker 11:  we weren't just trying to drive them down to

1018
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:53,905
Speaker 11:  become commodity hardware, like, you know, kind of the race to the $99

1019
01:06:53,935 --> 01:06:57,825
Speaker 11:  eReader and below and thought that there was

1020
01:06:57,825 --> 01:07:01,425
Speaker 11:  room for a premium segment. Like let's make a great seven e reader, let's

1021
01:07:01,425 --> 01:07:05,145
Speaker 11:  make a great eight e reader was to like to create

1022
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:08,785
Speaker 11:  some more pricing headroom so that the e-readers

1023
01:07:08,785 --> 01:07:12,705
Speaker 11:  themselves could be valuable objects and could be interesting objects. Because

1024
01:07:13,045 --> 01:07:17,025
Speaker 11:  if you can bring the price up a little bit, you can experiment with materials

1025
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:20,825
Speaker 11:  and you can, you know, kind of change the screen, like the screen

1026
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:23,865
Speaker 11:  technology that you're using, all of that to say, then you can start to

1027
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:27,825
Speaker 11:  have like a spectrum of e-readers at, at different price points and

1028
01:07:28,455 --> 01:07:31,865
Speaker 11:  have them stand on their own from an economics perspective

1029
01:07:32,365 --> 01:07:36,225
Speaker 11:  so that you're not trying to make, you know, these kind of like

1030
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:39,865
Speaker 11:  one-way doors where okay, you've bought our thing, now you have to buy all

1031
01:07:39,865 --> 01:07:43,785
Speaker 11:  of your content from us too. And that like, so Right. The content should

1032
01:07:43,785 --> 01:07:47,705
Speaker 11:  be our ability to sell books well should be able

1033
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:51,585
Speaker 11:  to stand on its own in terms of how we make money and the margins that

1034
01:07:51,585 --> 01:07:54,505
Speaker 11:  we have on it. And our ability to make hardware should be able to stand

1035
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:58,385
Speaker 11:  on its own knowing that some people are going to buy hardware and never

1036
01:07:58,525 --> 01:08:02,185
Speaker 11:  buy books from us. And, and that should be okay. So we,

1037
01:08:02,605 --> 01:08:05,905
Speaker 11:  we shouldn't be trying to structure this as a roach motel and,

1038
01:08:06,485 --> 01:08:10,305
Speaker 11:  and you should be able to kind of engage with it the ways that

1039
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:13,225
Speaker 11:  you want to. And maybe your e-reader is something that you're using to do

1040
01:08:13,505 --> 01:08:16,245
Speaker 11:  documents from work and maybe you're using it as something to buy books

1041
01:08:16,245 --> 01:08:20,165
Speaker 11:  from us or to hook up a subscription or you are a public

1042
01:08:20,165 --> 01:08:23,365
Speaker 11:  library fan and you wanna use Libby and like we're good with that too.

1043
01:08:23,835 --> 01:08:27,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I, and I think that that explanation makes total sense to

1044
01:08:27,765 --> 01:08:30,045
Speaker 1:  me, even though I have a, I have a books Palm I sitting here I would very

1045
01:08:30,045 --> 01:08:33,885
Speaker 1:  much like to talk to you about. Yeah. But I think to

1046
01:08:33,885 --> 01:08:37,605
Speaker 1:  me the, the both biggest opportunity and maybe most interesting

1047
01:08:37,605 --> 01:08:41,445
Speaker 1:  challenge here is that kind of getting stuff into and off of a

1048
01:08:41,445 --> 01:08:41,965
Speaker 1:  device like this

1049
01:08:43,555 --> 01:08:46,765
Speaker 1:  problem, because I think especially like you, you talked about the people

1050
01:08:46,765 --> 01:08:50,325
Speaker 1:  who read nonfiction and that they just interact with this information differently.

1051
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:55,925
Speaker 1:  One of those things is like I, I hear over and over from people who are like,

1052
01:08:56,045 --> 01:08:59,885
Speaker 1:  I, I use whatever app just because it syncs to my

1053
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:02,805
Speaker 1:  notion like you're just saying, right? Yes. And, and then I can, I can search

1054
01:09:02,825 --> 01:09:06,525
Speaker 1:  for all of my stuff or I get, I don't know, space repetition

1055
01:09:06,525 --> 01:09:09,245
Speaker 1:  flashcards sent to my email every week or like whatever. People have these

1056
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:13,045
Speaker 1:  sort of wild information collection systems and they want their long

1057
01:09:13,045 --> 01:09:16,645
Speaker 1:  form reading to be part of it. And by and large, these

1058
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:20,245
Speaker 1:  devices are the most disconnected from the rest of that.

1059
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:23,525
Speaker 11:  Yeah. And that's a, like one of the reasons that we,

1060
01:09:24,525 --> 01:09:28,215
Speaker 11:  that we put stuff like Dropbox support on there is like, let's look at popular

1061
01:09:28,405 --> 01:09:32,375
Speaker 11:  file systems that people already use that synchronize well that have things

1062
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:35,215
Speaker 11:  like, you know, the ability to email into a directory. Like all of that

1063
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:38,975
Speaker 11:  stuff is there. Sure. Yeah. So that a,

1064
01:09:39,265 --> 01:09:42,215
Speaker 11:  we're not rolling our own because nobody wants another one of these. Like

1065
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:45,895
Speaker 11:  every, everybody has eight already. And then the question is how much farther

1066
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:49,615
Speaker 11:  do you have to go? Like, is it okay we also should do box or we also should

1067
01:09:49,635 --> 01:09:52,775
Speaker 11:  do, you know, OneDrive or whatever the, you know, the other ones that people

1068
01:09:52,845 --> 01:09:53,135
Speaker 11:  want.

1069
01:09:53,525 --> 01:09:56,375
Speaker 1:  Well that is the problem, right? There is an infinite well of those things

1070
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:56,695
Speaker 1:  there

1071
01:09:56,695 --> 01:10:00,015
Speaker 11:  Are infinite wells. Yeah. And so at a certain point you have to saw it off.

1072
01:10:00,715 --> 01:10:04,135
Speaker 11:  And then similarly in terms of the material itself,

1073
01:10:05,555 --> 01:10:09,295
Speaker 11:  the, you've done whole series on note taking

1074
01:10:09,525 --> 01:10:13,095
Speaker 11:  solutions and knowledge management systems and

1075
01:10:13,095 --> 01:10:16,495
Speaker 11:  everybody wants their thing to go directly into that thing. Yep. And, and

1076
01:10:16,855 --> 01:10:20,695
Speaker 11:  I understand why as a, you know, as a notion user, I would, I love these

1077
01:10:20,695 --> 01:10:24,615
Speaker 11:  things to just be piped in, but can we get them out in

1078
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:27,335
Speaker 11:  standardized formats? Can we get them out in ways that are kind of easy

1079
01:10:27,395 --> 01:10:31,135
Speaker 11:  to manage and manipulate? And so whether that means that you are

1080
01:10:31,165 --> 01:10:34,935
Speaker 11:  then kicking them into the knowledge management system you have or feeding

1081
01:10:34,935 --> 01:10:38,415
Speaker 11:  them into an LLM or doing whatever else you're, you know, you're doing with

1082
01:10:38,415 --> 01:10:41,775
Speaker 11:  them, let's make sure that the inputs and outputs are relatively clean and

1083
01:10:41,775 --> 01:10:45,695
Speaker 11:  easy so that you can get stuff out. And

1084
01:10:45,695 --> 01:10:49,535
Speaker 11:  that's, you know, we've kind of been nudging around this at

1085
01:10:49,535 --> 01:10:52,495
Speaker 11:  different times, but getting things out is an important part of this. We

1086
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:55,295
Speaker 11:  would like you not Yeah. We don't want you to have your stuff trapped inside.

1087
01:10:56,325 --> 01:10:59,735
Speaker 1:  Well, and to that point, this is a bit of a diversion, but I know it's a

1088
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:03,575
Speaker 1:  thing you've been thinking about in talking about there's been, I would say

1089
01:11:03,655 --> 01:11:07,455
Speaker 1:  a a, a kerfuffle in the ebook reading world over the last

1090
01:11:07,455 --> 01:11:10,055
Speaker 1:  couple of weeks, which is not a thing that happens often. It's true. So it's

1091
01:11:10,055 --> 01:11:12,935
Speaker 1:  very exciting when there's ebook kerfuffles. Like it's, it's good stuff

1092
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:18,125
Speaker 1:  where I think be because of this Amazon announcement of they were shutting

1093
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:21,205
Speaker 1:  down the, the download and transfer thing where you can get your book, your

1094
01:11:21,215 --> 01:11:24,405
Speaker 1:  books easily off of your Kindle onto another device.

1095
01:11:25,275 --> 01:11:28,885
Speaker 1:  It's all, that's all very messy. But I think it, it has changed

1096
01:11:29,845 --> 01:11:33,805
Speaker 1:  a lot of people's ideas about what it means to like, have stuff on a device

1097
01:11:33,805 --> 01:11:37,725
Speaker 1:  like this. Yeah. There there is this feeling of like, okay, my, my

1098
01:11:37,725 --> 01:11:41,565
Speaker 1:  e-reader is, is a thing filled with my books. And I think a couple

1099
01:11:41,565 --> 01:11:44,965
Speaker 1:  of times over the years, Kindle owners in particular have been reminded that

1100
01:11:44,965 --> 01:11:48,925
Speaker 1:  that is not actually the case. And now there, I think

1101
01:11:48,925 --> 01:11:52,565
Speaker 1:  when you, when you go to buy a book on Amazon, it's like, it says you're

1102
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:56,005
Speaker 1:  buying a license to a book, not the book itself. Yeah. And like

1103
01:11:56,625 --> 01:12:00,605
Speaker 1:  we talk a lot about digital goods at The Verge and the idea of like, what,

1104
01:12:00,605 --> 01:12:03,885
Speaker 1:  what are they, what do you own? What are you buying? What, what if this matters?

1105
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:07,565
Speaker 1:  We got weirded in the NFTs for a minute. It was a whole thing. But I, I do

1106
01:12:07,565 --> 01:12:09,205
Speaker 1:  think like this, this question of

1107
01:12:10,765 --> 01:12:14,485
Speaker 1:  people's information on a Cobo device and in the Cobo ecosystem,

1108
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:18,805
Speaker 1:  what is your responsibility to all of that stuff? Whether it's books that

1109
01:12:18,825 --> 01:12:22,685
Speaker 1:  I'm buying or PDFs that I'm adding, like how, how

1110
01:12:22,685 --> 01:12:26,245
Speaker 1:  are users supposed to understand what all of that means inside of

1111
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:27,165
Speaker 1:  Cobas universe?

1112
01:12:28,035 --> 01:12:31,845
Speaker 11:  It's one of those places that I'm like, I'm kind of proud

1113
01:12:31,845 --> 01:12:35,685
Speaker 11:  we've been able to stick to our guns over the years because from the very

1114
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:39,365
Speaker 11:  beginning as we were first framing out what

1115
01:12:39,475 --> 01:12:43,365
Speaker 11:  Coba was gonna do, we thought you should be able to read your

1116
01:12:43,365 --> 01:12:46,925
Speaker 11:  books on any device. You know, we'd like it to be ours or we'd like it to

1117
01:12:46,925 --> 01:12:50,445
Speaker 11:  be in our app, but it doesn't have to be, you should be able to buy something

1118
01:12:50,545 --> 01:12:53,925
Speaker 11:  and take it somewhere else if you want to. And

1119
01:12:54,425 --> 01:12:58,325
Speaker 11:  you're right that, that question of licensing versus owning as a whole

1120
01:12:58,655 --> 01:13:02,445
Speaker 11:  other can of worms, like, yeah, publishers only let us

1121
01:13:02,475 --> 01:13:06,245
Speaker 11:  sell licenses mostly, and some let us sell without

1122
01:13:06,405 --> 01:13:10,205
Speaker 11:  DRM some, especially in the eu, like use

1123
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:14,125
Speaker 11:  watermarks that are embedded, but, you know, leave the files on DRM. So

1124
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:18,725
Speaker 11:  it's always really hard to say you own your eBooks the way

1125
01:13:18,725 --> 01:13:22,645
Speaker 11:  you own your paper books, but we can do the next best

1126
01:13:22,925 --> 01:13:26,365
Speaker 11:  thing, which is to say you can take them with, you know, you can

1127
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:30,565
Speaker 11:  download them, you put them on a USB key, you can bury them in a mineshaft

1128
01:13:30,565 --> 01:13:34,165
Speaker 11:  or hide them in a hollow tree. Like we still have to protect them with

1129
01:13:34,245 --> 01:13:37,805
Speaker 11:  DRM because the publishers want us to do that. But lots of

1130
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:41,765
Speaker 11:  other eres support DRM, you can take it and read it on one of those.

1131
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:46,365
Speaker 11:  And I think like that's good for us because it makes

1132
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:50,285
Speaker 11:  us compete on the experience. Like you have to wanna

1133
01:13:50,315 --> 01:13:54,125
Speaker 11:  stay and we have to earn your time

1134
01:13:54,185 --> 01:13:58,165
Speaker 11:  and your attention and your next e-reader to replace the one

1135
01:13:58,165 --> 01:14:01,845
Speaker 11:  that you bought eight years ago. And that keeps us honest.

1136
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:05,965
Speaker 11:  And it does, I think, give a certain sense of security to the

1137
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:09,685
Speaker 11:  person who's buying an ebook, which does already feel less tangible

1138
01:14:09,795 --> 01:14:11,245
Speaker 11:  than a physical book. Is

1139
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:13,565
Speaker 1:  That a hard line to hold over time?

1140
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:17,445
Speaker 11:  We haven't found it to be like, we had to fight hard for it at the very

1141
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:21,085
Speaker 11:  beginning, but I think publishers feel both

1142
01:14:21,255 --> 01:14:25,125
Speaker 11:  sides of the pressure on that one being it's better

1143
01:14:25,185 --> 01:14:28,445
Speaker 11:  not to lock people into ecosystems. And at the same time

1144
01:14:30,085 --> 01:14:33,485
Speaker 11:  we really want to make sure that our

1145
01:14:33,485 --> 01:14:37,165
Speaker 11:  intellectual property's protected and not fire hosed around the internet.

1146
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:40,965
Speaker 11:  And Sure. And I get both of those. But for

1147
01:14:40,985 --> 01:14:44,565
Speaker 11:  us, the, and especially as eBooks are just getting started, that notion

1148
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:48,365
Speaker 11:  of, you know, how do we create a sense of

1149
01:14:48,365 --> 01:14:52,045
Speaker 11:  safety around these very intangible objects is really important.

1150
01:14:52,395 --> 01:14:55,845
Speaker 11:  Like there are standard DRM solutions, this, this is a solved problem

1151
01:14:56,435 --> 01:14:59,725
Speaker 11:  fair. And, and you have them like fairly well standardized across markets

1152
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:03,605
Speaker 11:  and countries. Like none of that is actually an issue. It's like some people

1153
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:07,285
Speaker 11:  really want you to stay on one platform and never go anywhere again. And

1154
01:15:07,515 --> 01:15:07,925
Speaker 1:  Some people,

1155
01:15:08,195 --> 01:15:09,005
Speaker 11:  Some people, yeah.

1156
01:15:09,015 --> 01:15:10,085
Speaker 1:  Where, where do those people live?

1157
01:15:11,395 --> 01:15:15,205
Speaker 11:  They're more West Coast based I find, and I don't know if that's, if there's

1158
01:15:15,205 --> 01:15:18,325
Speaker 11:  something about proximity to the, the hes of the Pacific that make that

1159
01:15:18,325 --> 01:15:18,925
Speaker 11:  happen. There's

1160
01:15:18,925 --> 01:15:21,125
Speaker 1:  A big needle. Yeah. Somewhere in the city I think. Yeah. I forget.

1161
01:15:21,545 --> 01:15:25,325
Speaker 11:  And, but It is one of those, like you talk about

1162
01:15:25,325 --> 01:15:28,695
Speaker 11:  things that, you know, kind of stifle ebook innovation.

1163
01:15:29,635 --> 01:15:32,975
Speaker 11:  You've got those, those certain platform

1164
01:15:32,975 --> 01:15:36,455
Speaker 11:  dependencies that like that's the thing that makes this hard. Right? It's

1165
01:15:36,645 --> 01:15:40,295
Speaker 11:  it's not the screens, it's not the technology to a certain degree, it's

1166
01:15:40,915 --> 01:15:44,615
Speaker 11:  people wanting to keep things inside certain walled gardens.

1167
01:15:45,105 --> 01:15:47,575
Speaker 1:  Right. Okay. So to that end, I have two more things I wanna talk to you about.

1168
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:51,295
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And then I'm gonna let you go. Okay. Number one is, the

1169
01:15:51,535 --> 01:15:55,415
Speaker 1:  funniest thing about Cobo to me is that you are in every single ebook

1170
01:15:55,415 --> 01:15:59,215
Speaker 1:  reader buying guide under the same heading, which is the best

1171
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:03,295
Speaker 1:  non-Amazon ebook reader. I mean, everywhere you look on the internet, yeah.

1172
01:16:03,385 --> 01:16:06,135
Speaker 1:  There is the best Kindle and there's the best not Kindle.

1173
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:10,415
Speaker 1:  Does that drive you crazy? How do you feel about that designation that like,

1174
01:16:10,595 --> 01:16:14,535
Speaker 1:  in a real way you do kind of exist in opposition to Amazon? Is that

1175
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:15,415
Speaker 1:  frustrating

1176
01:16:15,795 --> 01:16:19,575
Speaker 11:  In so many ways in every way? Yeah. And, and so

1177
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:23,215
Speaker 11:  what's been great to see is how that,

1178
01:16:23,585 --> 01:16:27,175
Speaker 11:  those lists have evolved because it used to be, you know,

1179
01:16:27,525 --> 01:16:31,355
Speaker 11:  best e-readers and they would always put the Kindle one at the top because

1180
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:34,115
Speaker 11:  that was the most popular one. And then they'd put s but below and now they

1181
01:16:34,115 --> 01:16:38,035
Speaker 11:  just have two categories Best Kindles and best other

1182
01:16:38,035 --> 01:16:40,715
Speaker 11:  e-readers of which we are the best ones on those. And,

1183
01:16:41,815 --> 01:16:45,795
Speaker 11:  and I think we see perception on that

1184
01:16:45,995 --> 01:16:49,755
Speaker 11:  shifting a bit of, well, maybe, maybe I don't want that. Maybe I do want

1185
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:53,555
Speaker 11:  the, the alternative one. And and especially

1186
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:56,715
Speaker 11:  as controversies like the ones we've seen over the last few weeks have come

1187
01:16:56,715 --> 01:17:00,595
Speaker 11:  up, it makes more people look at that second column, which is

1188
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:04,475
Speaker 11:  fantastic for us. But the other thing that's interesting about that is that

1189
01:17:04,475 --> 01:17:08,195
Speaker 11:  that's really only a US and UK phenomenon.

1190
01:17:08,495 --> 01:17:09,245
Speaker 1:  That's fair. Yeah.

1191
01:17:09,345 --> 01:17:13,205
Speaker 11:  And it's like, some of that comes back to just

1192
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:17,125
Speaker 11:  where, where our friends in Seattle are dominant. Like they really, like,

1193
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:20,925
Speaker 11:  they run the ebook show in exactly two markets, us and the uk

1194
01:17:21,465 --> 01:17:24,835
Speaker 11:  and then in every other territory there is

1195
01:17:25,335 --> 01:17:28,555
Speaker 11:  at least one local retailer who's doing

1196
01:17:29,295 --> 01:17:33,155
Speaker 11:  as well in eBooks as as they are like they're

1197
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:37,355
Speaker 11:  toe to toe comparable market shares. And almost all of those are being

1198
01:17:37,355 --> 01:17:41,155
Speaker 11:  powered by us. So you have this really interesting case of

1199
01:17:41,505 --> 01:17:45,315
Speaker 11:  there's kind of one world in inside that bubble and one

1200
01:17:45,315 --> 01:17:48,635
Speaker 11:  world outside of it where we're all just like fighting away all day long.

1201
01:17:49,015 --> 01:17:51,875
Speaker 11:  And those lists look very different when you, when you come outside of the

1202
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:52,715
Speaker 11:  bubble, which is awesome.

1203
01:17:53,455 --> 01:17:56,235
Speaker 1:  All right, last thing. Okay. And then I'm gonna let you go. I would like

1204
01:17:56,235 --> 01:17:58,515
Speaker 1:  to read you a threads post that you did last August.

1205
01:17:59,295 --> 01:18:01,315
Speaker 11:  I'm ready. I'm terrified, but I'm ready.

1206
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:05,435
Speaker 1:  Somebody, it, somebody posted as per the latest vergecast, which

1207
01:18:06,075 --> 01:18:10,035
Speaker 1:  I believe this was me ranting about how bad the Kindle is at allowing

1208
01:18:10,055 --> 01:18:13,835
Speaker 1:  you to send web articles to the Kindle. All I want

1209
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:17,715
Speaker 1:  on Earth, Michael is just a good way to take all of the stuff I wanna

1210
01:18:17,715 --> 01:18:20,875
Speaker 1:  read on the internet and put it on my e-reader. Yes. I, this is,

1211
01:18:21,545 --> 01:18:24,715
Speaker 1:  this doesn't seem like a hard problem problem and yet no one has done this

1212
01:18:24,715 --> 01:18:28,115
Speaker 1:  for me in a way that is any good at all. Okay. So I'm ready. This person

1213
01:18:28,115 --> 01:18:31,915
Speaker 1:  posted as per the latest to Vergecast, will Cobo make a good reading

1214
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:35,795
Speaker 1:  app Allah read wise for all types of files and CC'd you and you responded

1215
01:18:35,825 --> 01:18:36,675
Speaker 1:  working on it?

1216
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:40,885
Speaker 11:  Yes. Do tell. So we have two parts. We have one which is

1217
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:45,965
Speaker 11:  the integration which we have with Pocket today, which does a really

1218
01:18:45,965 --> 01:18:49,485
Speaker 11:  good job of the web clipping side of it. Sure.

1219
01:18:49,785 --> 01:18:53,605
Speaker 11:  And so you can take all of that stuff that you've, you know, the long,

1220
01:18:53,785 --> 01:18:57,005
Speaker 11:  you know, the long read article that you don't wanna read on your phone

1221
01:18:57,225 --> 01:18:59,445
Speaker 11:  and throw it over to your e-reader that way. Super simple.

1222
01:18:59,905 --> 01:19:02,805
Speaker 1:  Is that, is that a good enough answer to that problem for you? Like

1223
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:06,085
Speaker 11:  It, I think it's, it's 75% of that answer. Okay.

1224
01:19:07,145 --> 01:19:11,005
Speaker 11:  The other use cases that say like kind of live around

1225
01:19:11,475 --> 01:19:14,765
Speaker 11:  read wise as an example, we have an integration with read wise so we can

1226
01:19:14,765 --> 01:19:18,485
Speaker 11:  like we can do some of that stuff and then the rest is,

1227
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:22,605
Speaker 11:  some of the rest is PDF management, which we keep

1228
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:26,125
Speaker 11:  taking these big jumps on in terms of how we manage and take care of them.

1229
01:19:26,425 --> 01:19:29,325
Speaker 11:  Now we allow you to write on your PDFs and annotate them the same way that

1230
01:19:29,325 --> 01:19:33,135
Speaker 11:  we do with an ebook. So that's all getting better. And then

1231
01:19:33,365 --> 01:19:37,135
Speaker 11:  like, I think the last things that we can keep working on are just like,

1232
01:19:37,135 --> 01:19:40,575
Speaker 11:  how do we make that as fluid and as clean as possible?

1233
01:19:41,495 --> 01:19:45,055
Speaker 11:  'cause right now it's spread across a couple of experiences. It's not kind

1234
01:19:45,055 --> 01:19:48,935
Speaker 11:  of like, you know, all exactly to one place we have to use a part of. It's

1235
01:19:48,935 --> 01:19:52,695
Speaker 11:  like we do have to use a different renderer for a PDF than we use for like

1236
01:19:52,695 --> 01:19:56,055
Speaker 11:  a webpage for example. So like all of that stuff is sort of in the mix,

1237
01:19:56,795 --> 01:20:00,575
Speaker 11:  but, but we get the question and we understand the,

1238
01:20:01,675 --> 01:20:05,535
Speaker 11:  the desire of like, can't I just have all of my reading in this one

1239
01:20:05,805 --> 01:20:09,525
Speaker 11:  calm, beautiful place where alerts aren't going off

1240
01:20:09,665 --> 01:20:13,245
Speaker 11:  and you know, notifications aren't coming up like you can read on a smartphone

1241
01:20:13,245 --> 01:20:17,005
Speaker 11:  today. So like you can get, you can get all of your Cobo books on a,

1242
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:21,005
Speaker 11:  on a smartphone right now so that the portal to

1243
01:20:21,005 --> 01:20:24,695
Speaker 11:  reading through that multifunction device exists today. And that that's

1244
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:28,655
Speaker 11:  a signal like that tells us something. When somebody buys an e-reader, they

1245
01:20:28,655 --> 01:20:32,495
Speaker 11:  are stepping back from what in almost 100% of cases

1246
01:20:32,635 --> 01:20:36,615
Speaker 11:  is the device they already own. Hmm. And so then at that point you've got

1247
01:20:36,615 --> 01:20:39,935
Speaker 11:  the question of what are the other layers of experience you can add to that

1248
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:43,735
Speaker 11:  that will actually augment and enhance that experience as

1249
01:20:44,015 --> 01:20:47,655
Speaker 11:  opposed to taking people closer to the thing that they're trying to escape

1250
01:20:47,655 --> 01:20:51,535
Speaker 11:  from. And, and so like we, you know, if audiobooks in

1251
01:20:51,535 --> 01:20:55,295
Speaker 11:  the e-reader experience because we feel that those are just two

1252
01:20:55,295 --> 01:20:58,655
Speaker 11:  kinds of reading and they should be kept close together, but we've

1253
01:20:59,335 --> 01:21:02,695
Speaker 11:  specifically and deliberately said no to a lot of other stuff that could

1254
01:21:03,055 --> 01:21:06,855
Speaker 11:  wrap around that. Both because they already have a home

1255
01:21:07,275 --> 01:21:10,975
Speaker 11:  on your phone that's very well served or the kind of

1256
01:21:10,975 --> 01:21:13,895
Speaker 11:  interaction that you would do with them is one that's just not well suited

1257
01:21:13,895 --> 01:21:17,855
Speaker 11:  to the, the hardware environment of an eReader. But mostly because we

1258
01:21:17,855 --> 01:21:21,095
Speaker 11:  are trying to get people that escape and we do want them to step away from

1259
01:21:21,095 --> 01:21:24,055
Speaker 11:  it. And when they do, they tend to read more, which is the thing that we

1260
01:21:24,055 --> 01:21:28,015
Speaker 11:  like as people who also sell books. So like that's where the, the

1261
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:30,975
Speaker 11:  two sides of the ecosystem do come together is that when we do put any reader

1262
01:21:30,975 --> 01:21:34,615
Speaker 11:  in someone's hand, they like, they buy more books and their reading time

1263
01:21:34,615 --> 01:21:38,495
Speaker 11:  is longer than a comparable customer holding a phone in their

1264
01:21:38,495 --> 01:21:42,295
Speaker 11:  hand who has access to our store. And so giving people that little bit

1265
01:21:42,295 --> 01:21:46,015
Speaker 11:  of haven of attention is just good for

1266
01:21:47,045 --> 01:21:50,775
Speaker 11:  someone's reading life. And we think that's, you know, for all kinds of

1267
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:54,495
Speaker 11:  reasons, also just a good thing in the world in general. Like we need more

1268
01:21:54,495 --> 01:21:57,335
Speaker 11:  little pockets of non distraction. I think it's always a good thing.

1269
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:01,895
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

1270
01:22:01,895 --> 01:22:04,335
Speaker 1:  we're gonna take a question from the forecast hotline. We'll be right back

1271
01:24:12,515 --> 01:24:15,455
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the hotline. As always, you can email

1272
01:24:15,695 --> 01:24:19,375
Speaker 1:  Vergecast at the berger.com with your questions. You can call 8 6 6 VERGE

1273
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:22,895
Speaker 1:  one one with your questions. We truly, truly love hearing from you.

1274
01:24:23,155 --> 01:24:26,735
Speaker 1:  We have a couple that are sparking bigger stories. I think you're gonna hear

1275
01:24:26,735 --> 01:24:30,215
Speaker 1:  one of those in the next couple of weeks. Super fun. We've really enjoyed

1276
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:33,535
Speaker 1:  hearing from you and especially right now where it feels like so many things

1277
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:36,895
Speaker 1:  in tech and in the news and in everything else are just kind of up in the

1278
01:24:36,895 --> 01:24:40,695
Speaker 1:  air. It's been really fun to just hear you think through stuff. So keep

1279
01:24:40,695 --> 01:24:43,335
Speaker 1:  sending us questions, keep sending us thoughts. We love hearing from you

1280
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:46,175
Speaker 1:  today. We have a question about televisions.

1281
01:24:48,145 --> 01:24:51,605
Speaker 17:  Hey Vergecast, this is Andrew from calling from Southern

1282
01:24:51,605 --> 01:24:55,365
Speaker 17:  California. I've got a question about TVs. I know

1283
01:24:55,365 --> 01:24:59,325
Speaker 17:  there's been a lot of recent discussion that a lot

1284
01:24:59,325 --> 01:25:00,605
Speaker 17:  of TV brands are making

1285
01:25:02,435 --> 01:25:06,165
Speaker 17:  less quality TVs that are designed only to serve you

1286
01:25:06,225 --> 01:25:09,765
Speaker 17:  ads and not necessarily to be good presentation machines,

1287
01:25:10,385 --> 01:25:13,765
Speaker 17:  but I'm in the market for a new one. I currently have an

1288
01:25:13,765 --> 01:25:17,525
Speaker 17:  8-year-old Visio M 50. It's a full

1289
01:25:17,525 --> 01:25:21,205
Speaker 17:  array LED, but it's got a dimming zone that's about to die

1290
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:25,285
Speaker 17:  and I'm looking for something new. I was gonna see if you guys could recommend

1291
01:25:25,285 --> 01:25:28,605
Speaker 17:  me some sort of TV or where I should start

1292
01:25:29,015 --> 01:25:32,725
Speaker 17:  doing research. I don't really have a budget, but

1293
01:25:32,925 --> 01:25:36,565
Speaker 17:  I guess it's really, I want something that's high quality but not necessarily

1294
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:40,285
Speaker 17:  top of the line. I can't really afford an A 95 like

1295
01:25:40,475 --> 01:25:44,445
Speaker 17:  neli even though I would love to have one. But basically I use an

1296
01:25:44,445 --> 01:25:48,325
Speaker 17:  Apple TV pass through a soundbar top box. So I

1297
01:25:48,325 --> 01:25:52,165
Speaker 17:  don't really need something with a crazy good os. Sometimes I'll play

1298
01:25:52,165 --> 01:25:56,045
Speaker 17:  video games on an Xbox Series X and I'm really starting to get

1299
01:25:56,075 --> 01:26:00,045
Speaker 17:  into 4K Blu-rays and eventually I want

1300
01:26:00,045 --> 01:26:03,445
Speaker 17:  to buy my own standalone player. So really I was just gonna see if you guys

1301
01:26:03,445 --> 01:26:06,925
Speaker 17:  could recommend me anything or any sort of technologies I I should look

1302
01:26:06,925 --> 01:26:08,965
Speaker 17:  for in a good quality tv. Thanks

1303
01:26:10,345 --> 01:26:12,055
Speaker 1:  Chris Wel is here. Hello Chris.

1304
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:13,655
Speaker 18:  Hello. It's good to be here

1305
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:17,775
Speaker 1:  As you know I am, I am woefully unqualified to be the person to answer this

1306
01:26:17,895 --> 01:26:21,335
Speaker 1:  question. Neil, I just makes fun of me for this crappy Roku

1307
01:26:21,495 --> 01:26:24,695
Speaker 1:  TCL that sits behind me that I hate slightly more every single day.

1308
01:26:25,675 --> 01:26:28,495
Speaker 1:  But I really like this question because it's, it's like it's two questions,

1309
01:26:28,495 --> 01:26:32,415
Speaker 1:  right? It's like I, I want a nice TV but I

1310
01:26:32,415 --> 01:26:36,375
Speaker 1:  don't wanna spend several paychecks on a television. But it's also like if

1311
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:40,215
Speaker 1:  I just wanna buy a pretty good tv, where do I start? So I wanna, I

1312
01:26:40,215 --> 01:26:43,375
Speaker 1:  wanna end with like a specific a recommendation as we can give our friend

1313
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:46,735
Speaker 1:  Andrew here. Yeah. But let's start kind of bigger picture. If you're just

1314
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:50,535
Speaker 1:  like in the market for a pretty good TV right now, where would you start?

1315
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:55,135
Speaker 18:  First of all, shout out to Visio, you know, sad fall from Grace but they

1316
01:26:55,135 --> 01:26:58,575
Speaker 18:  used to make great tv so Andrew, they did good choice back on the day, but

1317
01:26:58,575 --> 01:27:01,815
Speaker 18:  now it's time for an upgrade. And there are two brands that kind of live

1318
01:27:01,815 --> 01:27:05,735
Speaker 18:  in this zone. They're ENS and TCL, the leading mini LED

1319
01:27:05,795 --> 01:27:09,055
Speaker 18:  TV makers. We always talk about mini LED being a being like a great value

1320
01:27:09,115 --> 01:27:13,095
Speaker 18:  for what, what you pay. You can get like a 65 inch model for like under

1321
01:27:13,135 --> 01:27:16,615
Speaker 18:  a thousand dollars right now from like either company with fantastic picture,

1322
01:27:16,735 --> 01:27:20,295
Speaker 18:  a great contrast, all the specs you want 4K HDR

1323
01:27:20,745 --> 01:27:24,695
Speaker 18:  super bright picture and that's a great value for the money they both ship

1324
01:27:24,695 --> 01:27:28,455
Speaker 18:  with via Google TV os, which is fine. I think it's like

1325
01:27:29,215 --> 01:27:32,895
Speaker 18:  probably my favorite onboard TV os Yeah. But if you're using Apple TV 4K,

1326
01:27:33,475 --> 01:27:37,055
Speaker 18:  you can always just go right to that input and totally ignore it. And so

1327
01:27:37,845 --> 01:27:41,815
Speaker 18:  yeah, I think ENS and TCL L are kinda, this is their lane, this is where

1328
01:27:41,815 --> 01:27:44,535
Speaker 18:  they live, this is where they dominate and so yeah, that's where I would

1329
01:27:44,535 --> 01:27:44,855
Speaker 18:  steer you.

1330
01:27:44,855 --> 01:27:48,735
Speaker 1:  Totally. Yeah. And I think the buy a TV and

1331
01:27:48,735 --> 01:27:52,335
Speaker 1:  then buy a separate box and plug it straight into the, like go straight to

1332
01:27:52,405 --> 01:27:56,295
Speaker 1:  that input when you do It is a hundred percent the

1333
01:27:56,295 --> 01:27:57,015
Speaker 1:  right move. Like even

1334
01:27:57,165 --> 01:28:00,535
Speaker 18:  Sometimes there are certain TVs, like Sony TVs, like their apps on Sony

1335
01:28:00,715 --> 01:28:03,575
Speaker 18:  TVs like use like special processing for like picture performance and enhancement

1336
01:28:03,595 --> 01:28:06,215
Speaker 18:  and like you don't get that same processing if you use like an external

1337
01:28:06,355 --> 01:28:09,015
Speaker 18:  box. So if you have a Sony TV that's like very specific. But,

1338
01:28:10,395 --> 01:28:12,935
Speaker 18:  so that's one reason to like use the onboard apps. And most of them are

1339
01:28:12,935 --> 01:28:15,295
Speaker 18:  pretty similar to like what your streaming gadgets can do these days, but

1340
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:17,895
Speaker 18:  they're more up to date on the streaming boxes and Right. Stuff like that.

1341
01:28:17,915 --> 01:28:21,575
Speaker 18:  And you can also just ignore all the ads if you've got a Roku TV

1342
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:25,575
Speaker 18:  or you know, these ones from Google that also do like full screen

1343
01:28:25,575 --> 01:28:28,295
Speaker 18:  ads. I got a full screen Starbucks ad the other day on my Google tv. Oh.

1344
01:28:28,295 --> 01:28:30,575
Speaker 18:  So you know, they're, they're out there.

1345
01:28:30,575 --> 01:28:34,215
Speaker 1:  That's, it's rough out there. Yeah, I do feel like I, I am, I am increasingly

1346
01:28:34,215 --> 01:28:38,175
Speaker 1:  being radicalized against Roku's operating system, but that's for

1347
01:28:38,175 --> 01:28:41,735
Speaker 1:  another day. We'll come back to that. Sure. Yeah. So is is mini

1348
01:28:41,815 --> 01:28:44,975
Speaker 1:  LED the one like if you're, if you're just recommending a TV to most people?

1349
01:28:45,165 --> 01:28:47,055
Speaker 1:  Yeah, is is a mini LED tv the place to be,

1350
01:28:47,975 --> 01:28:51,515
Speaker 18:  That's where I would start. Like unless you wanna pay quite a bit more for

1351
01:28:51,515 --> 01:28:55,475
Speaker 18:  an OLAD from LG or Samsung, then I would certainly say stick

1352
01:28:55,475 --> 01:28:59,395
Speaker 18:  with the menu. Okay. Mini LED for what you're getting for the value. So

1353
01:28:59,665 --> 01:29:02,725
Speaker 18:  yeah, so I would say ENS has the

1354
01:29:04,565 --> 01:29:07,005
Speaker 18:  U eight N, that's their flagship mini

1355
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:09,405
Speaker 18:  L-A-D-T-V-T-C-L has the

1356
01:29:10,985 --> 01:29:14,405
Speaker 18:  QM eight. They both have eight in the in the name so it's very confusing

1357
01:29:14,405 --> 01:29:17,365
Speaker 18:  for some reason. And then Sony also has a pretty good mini LAD called the

1358
01:29:17,505 --> 01:29:21,165
Speaker 18:  BRAVIA seven, which is like their kind of mid-tier

1359
01:29:21,645 --> 01:29:25,045
Speaker 18:  model. Not quite as many zones the other ones, but it's like a

1360
01:29:25,295 --> 01:29:29,125
Speaker 18:  great performing set for what you're paying for it. So those would be my

1361
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:31,765
Speaker 18:  models I'd recommend. But like even like their lower ones, like if you step

1362
01:29:31,765 --> 01:29:35,725
Speaker 18:  down from there, like they still have great pictures especially compared

1363
01:29:35,725 --> 01:29:38,405
Speaker 18:  to it's like a five-year-old Visio, like a 10-year-old Visio, you're gonna

1364
01:29:38,635 --> 01:29:42,375
Speaker 18:  have like a huge jump up in like overall, you know, quality and

1365
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:46,295
Speaker 18:  performance and HDR R is just, yeah, it's good. It's good especially you

1366
01:29:46,295 --> 01:29:49,695
Speaker 18:  know, the 4K Blu-ray discs. Good choice there. I hope that's still around

1367
01:29:49,955 --> 01:29:53,895
Speaker 18:  in a few years. You know, it seems like physical media is having a tough

1368
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:57,095
Speaker 18:  go but I respect the endeavor so yeah.

1369
01:29:57,605 --> 01:30:01,535
Speaker 1:  Okay. So I feel like I, I was thinking about this listening to this question

1370
01:30:01,535 --> 01:30:05,375
Speaker 1:  that like I have a very clear sense of what to tell

1371
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:08,735
Speaker 1:  people to spend money on sort of as you wanna upgrade, right? Like you have

1372
01:30:08,795 --> 01:30:12,615
Speaker 1:  the, the the sort of base, I know the, I know the screen size I want, I know

1373
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:15,775
Speaker 1:  I want it to be mini LED, right? Like great, those are two good decisions

1374
01:30:15,775 --> 01:30:19,725
Speaker 1:  to make very quickly then it's like, do I, how do I sort

1375
01:30:19,725 --> 01:30:23,445
Speaker 1:  of slowly step up what is worth paying a little bit more for? What is just

1376
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:26,885
Speaker 1:  nonsense that you don't care about? Do you have a sort of rubric in your

1377
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:30,605
Speaker 1:  head of like how to sort of move up the, the SPECT line of

1378
01:30:31,065 --> 01:30:31,285
Speaker 1:  TVs?

1379
01:30:32,325 --> 01:30:35,005
Speaker 18:  It's really just brightness. It's all brightness wars these days when it

1380
01:30:35,005 --> 01:30:38,205
Speaker 18:  comes to TCL L ENS selling and even Olas year after year, it's just getting

1381
01:30:38,325 --> 01:30:41,285
Speaker 18:  brighter and brighter and brighter. It's like, do you want like an eye searing

1382
01:30:41,285 --> 01:30:45,125
Speaker 18:  brightness level then you would buy the eight hyen. Like those top tier

1383
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:48,445
Speaker 18:  models, they're too bright for some rooms like my living room, it, it's

1384
01:30:48,475 --> 01:30:52,285
Speaker 18:  kind of absurd. But if you want like the most impactful HDR, that's why

1385
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:56,205
Speaker 18:  you buy those TVs plus blooming, these have like so many zones in their

1386
01:30:56,385 --> 01:31:00,085
Speaker 18:  TVs now. It's like how they control those like demean zones and like

1387
01:31:00,385 --> 01:31:03,285
Speaker 18:  try and cut down on blooming effect where you have like a halo around text

1388
01:31:03,385 --> 01:31:06,685
Speaker 18:  or captions and stuff like that. That's something to look out for as you're

1389
01:31:06,725 --> 01:31:10,005
Speaker 18:  shopping. So like all these tops, your TVs all have great algorithms that

1390
01:31:10,005 --> 01:31:13,485
Speaker 18:  kind of like cut down on pluming and other like bad side effects of having

1391
01:31:13,585 --> 01:31:15,645
Speaker 18:  so many dimming zones there in the sets.

1392
01:31:16,485 --> 01:31:19,855
Speaker 1:  Okay. What do you, what do you think is the right sort of starting budget

1393
01:31:19,915 --> 01:31:23,775
Speaker 1:  for people? I feel like generally speaking, if you, I, if, if all you

1394
01:31:23,775 --> 01:31:27,535
Speaker 1:  have is $300 to spend on a tv, buy a 300 tv, right? Like that's fine. But

1395
01:31:27,535 --> 01:31:30,575
Speaker 1:  if you're, where do you feel like the very good

1396
01:31:30,845 --> 01:31:32,655
Speaker 1:  televisions range starts?

1397
01:31:33,475 --> 01:31:35,895
Speaker 18:  So I'd say like a thousand dollars is a pretty good sweet spot right now

1398
01:31:35,915 --> 01:31:39,535
Speaker 18:  as far as, okay, that can get you a 65 inch model from the ones I talked

1399
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:43,415
Speaker 18:  about. If you want bigger, you, you know, these companies all

1400
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:46,975
Speaker 18:  make bigger sets. I'm happy with a super modest 65 inch insured, but I know

1401
01:31:47,815 --> 01:31:51,015
Speaker 18:  the trend is going towards bigger and bigger and bigger sizes. So that'll

1402
01:31:51,015 --> 01:31:54,655
Speaker 18:  cost you, you know, 2000 more if you want like a 75 inch or bigger.

1403
01:31:55,475 --> 01:31:59,445
Speaker 18:  But if you want just like a nice very bright 65

1404
01:31:59,445 --> 01:32:03,165
Speaker 18:  inch tv, you can spend like 900 bucks or a thousand bucks and be very, very

1405
01:32:03,165 --> 01:32:05,005
Speaker 18:  happy for many, many years to come. So.

1406
01:32:05,195 --> 01:32:08,405
Speaker 1:  Okay. Okay. Well this is good Andrew. I hope that helps. Now I have a question

1407
01:32:08,405 --> 01:32:12,365
Speaker 1:  for you specifically about me and my own television needs. So, okay. As you

1408
01:32:12,365 --> 01:32:16,245
Speaker 1:  can see behind me, I, I have, I have a very bright window and

1409
01:32:16,245 --> 01:32:20,125
Speaker 1:  the very bright window stares directly at my television. And so what

1410
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:23,405
Speaker 1:  happens is, anytime It is not like

1411
01:32:24,095 --> 01:32:28,085
Speaker 1:  pitch black outside, there's just a third of my screen that

1412
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:31,925
Speaker 1:  is just glared to death. I have just come to accept this as like the

1413
01:32:31,925 --> 01:32:35,885
Speaker 1:  price of the layout of this room behind me. But this TV

1414
01:32:36,185 --> 01:32:39,925
Speaker 1:  is, I don't know, it was crappy five years ago when I bought it and now

1415
01:32:39,955 --> 01:32:40,645
Speaker 1:  it's this,

1416
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:46,085
Speaker 1:  can I, if I spend a thousand dollars on a TV right now, can I solve at least

1417
01:32:46,105 --> 01:32:49,725
Speaker 1:  enough of my glare problem that I can see things on the TV because it'll

1418
01:32:49,725 --> 01:32:50,485
Speaker 1:  be bright enough and better?

1419
01:32:51,305 --> 01:32:54,965
Speaker 18:  I'd say so, yeah, for sure. If you want like a true solution, you could

1420
01:32:54,965 --> 01:32:58,285
Speaker 18:  buy like one of Samsung's ola TVs 'cause they have like a matte coating

1421
01:32:58,285 --> 01:33:02,045
Speaker 18:  on them. Now sheer brightness can help obviously, but as far as like the

1422
01:33:02,045 --> 01:33:05,525
Speaker 18:  actual coating on the display, Samsung's Olas have like an anti-glare etched

1423
01:33:05,525 --> 01:33:09,325
Speaker 18:  glass type thing. And also that's gonna come to this year's LCD sets.

1424
01:33:09,425 --> 01:33:13,085
Speaker 18:  So those shouldn't be quite as expensive. Probably not like a thousand dollars

1425
01:33:13,135 --> 01:33:17,125
Speaker 18:  cheap but better. So I would say try those

1426
01:33:17,265 --> 01:33:20,565
Speaker 18:  if you want, but Tieszen os is kind of like a headache.

1427
01:33:21,075 --> 01:33:24,405
Speaker 18:  Yeah, it's not my favorite. That's where you go with the Apple TV or some

1428
01:33:24,405 --> 01:33:28,245
Speaker 18:  other box to plug in. But that would do a great job. But kind of, yeah,

1429
01:33:28,245 --> 01:33:30,285
Speaker 18:  that window spot is rough. So I feel for you

1430
01:33:30,555 --> 01:33:34,485
Speaker 1:  It's tough man. And it really, I was this, I was trying to watch the

1431
01:33:34,535 --> 01:33:38,405
Speaker 1:  Gorge, that Apple TV movie Yeah. The other day down here. And that like

1432
01:33:38,685 --> 01:33:41,605
Speaker 1:  a solid third of that movie is basically, it's all dark basically in pitch

1433
01:33:41,845 --> 01:33:44,365
Speaker 1:  darkness. Yeah. And I couldn't see it. I literally had to stop the movie

1434
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:47,005
Speaker 1:  'cause I was like, I can't, it's all happening in that like bottom third

1435
01:33:47,005 --> 01:33:50,765
Speaker 1:  of the screen that I just can't see. I had to pause the movie and I was like,

1436
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:52,445
Speaker 1:  it's probably time for a new television.

1437
01:33:52,975 --> 01:33:55,965
Speaker 18:  Can't you use some curtains or some like smart home sliding something over

1438
01:33:55,965 --> 01:33:57,805
Speaker 18:  something to cover that up during, that's movie time.

1439
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:02,165
Speaker 1:  The actual answer is curtains. But the much more fun technology answer

1440
01:34:02,225 --> 01:34:05,085
Speaker 1:  is buy a needlessly expensive television. Of course. So I'm, I'm that Stan.

1441
01:34:05,275 --> 01:34:05,565
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1442
01:34:05,565 --> 01:34:07,125
Speaker 18:  So that's why we're here. Yeah.
