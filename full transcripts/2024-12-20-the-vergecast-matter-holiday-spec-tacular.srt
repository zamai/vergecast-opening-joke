Description: Happy holidays! Before we disappear into family time and catching up on our favorite shows, we have one more episode for you. And it's 90 minutes of deep nerdery about the smart home. Every year, we try to dig into one standard or spec that has impacted our lives this year, and we couldn't think of anything more potentially great and occasionally infuriating than Matter. Matter is supposed to be the protocol that makes the smart home work — so, uh, how's that going? The Verge's Jennifer Pattison Tuohy joins to discuss the state of the smart home, before we play a game to see how well we understand things. Then, Home Assistant creator Paulus Schoutsen tells us what it's like to try and make Matter work, and where we might be headed next year.

2
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:02,365
Speaker 3:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Eli's new wifi

3
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:05,965
Speaker 3:  equipped oven, which I think has just been delivered very recently. Neli

4
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:06,765
Speaker 3:  sells here. Hi Neli.

5
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:10,405
Speaker 4:  We have new oven and new dishwasher. These are our big Black Friday purchases.

6
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:13,965
Speaker 4:  They, they use different apps. This is gonna be a real theme.

7
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:17,045
Speaker 3:  This is uni. Ironically, what we are here to talk about, gen two is also

8
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:17,605
Speaker 3:  here. Hi Jen.

9
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:20,365
Speaker 5:  Hi. Happy to be here. Happy holidays.

10
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:24,605
Speaker 3:  This is our holiday spectacular and this year, If you didn't

11
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:28,225
Speaker 3:  already know from the title of this episode, our topic has matter

12
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:32,745
Speaker 3:  and the smart home that both is and is not and will solve all of our

13
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:36,385
Speaker 3:  problems and will make us all miserable until the end of time. And so we're

14
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:40,185
Speaker 3:  gonna, we're gonna dig deep into this. We, we have some time with Paul

15
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:44,025
Speaker 3:  who runs Home Assistant later on. We're gonna play some games, but I think

16
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,985
Speaker 3:  we should, we should just level set here first. And Jen, I

17
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:51,585
Speaker 3:  think you are the correct person to do this for us. Before Neil, I gets too

18
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:55,065
Speaker 3:  deep into his feelings about the smartness of his appliances that have just

19
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:59,025
Speaker 3:  arrived. Let's just talk about where both what matter is and where it is

20
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,885
Speaker 3:  is kind of in the world right now. So like truly, let's start from nothing.

21
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:06,125
Speaker 3:  Okay. If you were living under a rock until

22
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:10,005
Speaker 3:  six minutes before you press play on this podcast, what is matter?

23
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:14,285
Speaker 6:  Okay, so Matter is a open

24
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:18,165
Speaker 6:  source standard for the smart Home. It is created,

25
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,965
Speaker 6:  it was created by over 200 different companies spearheaded by

26
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:25,845
Speaker 6:  some of the big players. Apple, Google, Samsung, Amazon.

27
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:30,045
Speaker 6:  It is designed as a communication and

28
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:33,965
Speaker 6:  interoperability protocol for your smart home. Basically, it's

29
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:37,525
Speaker 6:  designed to make any smart connected device that you buy,

30
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:41,485
Speaker 6:  microwave, dishwasher, fridge, smart light,

31
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:45,565
Speaker 6:  smart lock, be able to talk to each other in your home, communicate

32
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:49,325
Speaker 6:  locally in your home, as well as communicate to a smart home platform

33
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:53,205
Speaker 6:  like Apple Home, Home Assistant, Google Home, so that

34
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:57,085
Speaker 6:  we couldn control those devices locally. We couldn use

35
00:03:57,085 --> 00:04:00,885
Speaker 6:  your smart home on any platform that you like. This is one of the

36
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:04,565
Speaker 6:  key sort of features of Matter is that because all of the big

37
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:08,525
Speaker 6:  platforms are onboard, that any matter device should work

38
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:11,845
Speaker 6:  with any smart home platform. And you know, the

39
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:15,685
Speaker 6:  manufacturers don't have to develop individual partnerships with different

40
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:19,085
Speaker 6:  companies in order to work with Apple HomeKit or to work with Amazon Alexa.

41
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:23,415
Speaker 6:  If you work with Matter, you should be compatible with all the platforms.

42
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:27,095
Speaker 6:  So it's designed to make the smart home simpler,

43
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:31,695
Speaker 6:  more reliable, more secure, and much more

44
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:32,535
Speaker 6:  interoperable.

45
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,295
Speaker 3:  So in theory, NELI buys on Black Friday

46
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:40,735
Speaker 3:  some fancy new stove and dishwasher. Yes. Sticks

47
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:44,265
Speaker 3:  it in, plugs it in Magic smart home

48
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,185
Speaker 6:  In theory. How's that going,

49
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:47,705
Speaker 3:  NELI? How'd go? How we doing? It's

50
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,745
Speaker 4:  Not, it's not going great. Not going way. I wanna be clear that our microwave

51
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:53,545
Speaker 4:  in refrigerator are also have different apps.

52
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,305
Speaker 6:  Okay. This is

53
00:04:56,305 --> 00:05:00,225
Speaker 4:  Just the, this is the nature of the beast, but it's also, we have a bunch

54
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:04,145
Speaker 4:  of smart plugs in our house and a Lutron light switch system,

55
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:07,345
Speaker 4:  and that isn't part of matter. And then we have Phillips Hu Lights in one

56
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:10,665
Speaker 4:  room. And that isn't part of matter. I, I suspect

57
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:15,065
Speaker 4:  no matter what we do, we'll be drawn to talking about smart vacuum

58
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,745
Speaker 4:  cleaners like the heat death of the universe. Just that

59
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,785
Speaker 4:  is the black hole of all smart home gadgets. It feels like none of those

60
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:26,665
Speaker 4:  around, but there's, I I'm aware that the standard is coming to, to support

61
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:27,265
Speaker 4:  it. Yes.

62
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:28,065
Speaker 6:  And this is,

63
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:29,705
Speaker 4:  There's, there's just a lot of that.

64
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:33,985
Speaker 6:  Yes, it's coming. There is a lot of that. That is true.

65
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:37,385
Speaker 6:  But it's a standard. Right? And it's only been around two years to be, to

66
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:40,785
Speaker 6:  give it some, some wiggle room. That's not a long time

67
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:45,145
Speaker 6:  in the scope of developing a standard. Although it was launched and

68
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:49,065
Speaker 6:  announced 2019, it took them a couple of

69
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:52,225
Speaker 6:  years to get all the ducks in a row. And, which

70
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:55,665
Speaker 3:  I think to be fair, given, given what happened after 2019, right? I think

71
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:58,045
Speaker 3:  I'm, I'm very forgiving of things happening slowly. Yes.

72
00:05:58,305 --> 00:05:59,525
Speaker 4:  No, that was your time to focus.

73
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:04,445
Speaker 3:  We all got into like sourdough baking you like there's no time for connectivity

74
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:04,925
Speaker 3:  Sanders.

75
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,405
Speaker 6:  Well, but we also all kind of got into our homes a bit more and into the

76
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:11,765
Speaker 6:  home that is, it was kind of a, in a way, a good moment for the smart home.

77
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:15,765
Speaker 6:  But it, what they've been doing since the launch is adding

78
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,685
Speaker 6:  more device types, more support for features

79
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:23,765
Speaker 6:  part that are part of the devices that you use. But ultimately

80
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:27,845
Speaker 6:  the, the idea of matter is just this connectivity layer, like the plumbing

81
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:31,845
Speaker 6:  for your smart home, the wifi for your smart home. You know, it's, it's

82
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,165
Speaker 6:  the connectivity that will enable you to do all of the fancy

83
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:40,125
Speaker 6:  things that you might want to do with your smart home. Like have your smart

84
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,925
Speaker 6:  lights turn on in the morning when you say good morning, or when you walk

85
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:46,765
Speaker 6:  past a motion sensor or have your smart locks lock and your lights

86
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:50,525
Speaker 6:  turn off and your thermostat adjust at night when you say goodnight. And

87
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:54,245
Speaker 6:  there's also more sort of ambitious ideas about like whole home energy

88
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:57,685
Speaker 6:  management. And this is where smart appliances come into play

89
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:02,205
Speaker 6:  having, you know, because the, the butt of the internet of things jokes is

90
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:05,245
Speaker 6:  other fridges and the dishwashers and the microbes. Like, why do I need to

91
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:08,645
Speaker 6:  connect these devices to wifi? What, what benefit do I get other than an

92
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:12,245
Speaker 6:  alert on my phone telling me that my dishwasher's done? Which actually is

93
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:12,525
Speaker 6:  quite

94
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:15,805
Speaker 3:  Useful. Mine plays like a six minute long song every time it's finished.

95
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,445
Speaker 3:  So I, I feel like I know pretty successfully when it's done.

96
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:22,325
Speaker 6:  But w once we can connect all the energy devices on our homes,

97
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:26,285
Speaker 6:  including things like home battery storage systems, solar panels,

98
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:30,925
Speaker 6:  HVAC systems, all of that to home energy

99
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,565
Speaker 6:  management platform, we couldn, you know, can see some potential there for

100
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:38,405
Speaker 6:  saving energy, saving money. There are some use cases sort of down the

101
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:42,285
Speaker 6:  line that are more than just the fun, the shades are gonna go up when you

102
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:45,525
Speaker 6:  say good morning, which are fun and we like those things, but there's, there's

103
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:49,205
Speaker 6:  a big, you know, there's a big whole sort of long goal of

104
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:53,165
Speaker 6:  what's the smart home use case could be. It is a long term

105
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:56,965
Speaker 6:  goal. And I think we are, we have not got very far

106
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:58,165
Speaker 6:  in the first two years.

107
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:02,765
Speaker 3:  Fair. Yeah. To that end, you, you have prepared for us a, a report

108
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:06,485
Speaker 3:  card of what is real and what is not, which is, I feel like every time you

109
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,845
Speaker 3:  come on the show and we talk about this, it's, it's like what if this is

110
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,965
Speaker 3:  actually real in real life for real people. Yeah. And that

111
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:16,805
Speaker 3:  is like the eternal question of matter. And one, I suspect we're gonna spend

112
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:19,565
Speaker 3:  a bunch of time here talking about, do you wanna take us through the, the

113
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,085
Speaker 3:  report card you've given for matter so far? Okay.

114
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And you know, it's the end of the year, so, and I have two teenagers

115
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,925
Speaker 6:  in high school, so report cards are heavily on my mind. This is also

116
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,365
Speaker 3:  This, this is a useful place to start. How tough a parent are you when it

117
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:35,845
Speaker 3:  comes? Like are you the, like why is this a minus not an a plus kind of parent?

118
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:39,405
Speaker 3:  Or are you like, oh, tight a D is technically passing. Great job,

119
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,645
Speaker 6:  I'm going with that one. Oh wow.

120
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:46,525
Speaker 4:  See, my, my dad in particular was If you get straight A's, I

121
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,365
Speaker 4:  won't care about how much additional trouble you get into

122
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:49,685
Speaker 6:  Ah, that's a good,

123
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,005
Speaker 4:  Which is an incredible incentive. He did end up talking to every principal

124
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:53,525
Speaker 4:  I ever had.

125
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:55,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

126
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:58,485
Speaker 4:  And I, I don't know that the smart home is there. Like it hasn't earned that

127
00:08:58,485 --> 00:08:58,725
Speaker 4:  grace.

128
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:02,445
Speaker 3:  You definitely strike me as somebody who got a lot of parent teacher conferences

129
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:05,645
Speaker 3:  that were like, he has the highest grade in the class, but he is a gigantic

130
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:09,405
Speaker 3:  pain. Can you fix that? And your parents were just like you said, he is getting

131
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:11,125
Speaker 3:  the highest grade in the class. So we're cool that

132
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:14,605
Speaker 4:  That is more, that was more or less my father's coach. I just want to be

133
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:18,485
Speaker 4:  very clear, that is not where matter is at all.

134
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:21,165
Speaker 4:  No, like you're not like, this is so good. I will put up with

135
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,365
Speaker 6:  The fact I with anything, the

136
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:25,125
Speaker 4:  Kitchen's on fire, right? It's much more like, are you here?

137
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:27,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Matters is getting the parent teaching conference where

138
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,725
Speaker 4:  It's so first grade Jen. Yeah. Present at

139
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:32,405
Speaker 4:  attendance.

140
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:36,965
Speaker 6:  Okay, attendance. Oh. Oh that's a tough one.

141
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:43,045
Speaker 6:  I mean, I think actually 2024 we kind of felt like matter

142
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:46,725
Speaker 6:  was maybe playing a little bit of hooky

143
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,725
Speaker 6:  Because that, that wasn't, I mean we had so much momentum in the

144
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,205
Speaker 6:  first year. There was a lot of new devices, a lot of new device types,

145
00:09:56,725 --> 00:10:00,445
Speaker 6:  a lot of companies jumping on board. This last year was a little quieter.

146
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:04,605
Speaker 6:  And also we had two spec releases, which they promised and they were very

147
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:08,365
Speaker 6:  much kind of fixing problems. The biggest thing that I've

148
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:12,325
Speaker 6:  been sort of disappointed with this year has been that we're not, we have

149
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:16,285
Speaker 6:  not seen a ton of new products, especially in these new categories, which

150
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:19,125
Speaker 6:  are really kind of new to the smart home. Like the home energy management

151
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,895
Speaker 6:  and the appliances. There isn't, there just haven't been a lot of

152
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:27,375
Speaker 6:  of new devices that have come to market. So it's like the

153
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:31,175
Speaker 6:  system and the infrastructure's there. So you know, the school's there, but

154
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,975
Speaker 6:  you know, maybe they didn't actually show up toward the classes,

155
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:38,855
Speaker 3:  Which is pretty important, I would say. Yes, it is in the, the school existing

156
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,175
Speaker 3:  is is good.

157
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:41,815
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. It's

158
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:42,775
Speaker 3:  Not the whole job. Yeah.

159
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:46,735
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And that's, that's my sort of biggest downgrade

160
00:10:46,735 --> 00:10:50,335
Speaker 6:  here isn't really matters problem, but it's the platform's problem.

161
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:54,375
Speaker 6:  So we have these device types that have all been added in the last

162
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:58,415
Speaker 6:  year or two, like robot vacuums, but the platform support

163
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:01,775
Speaker 6:  has been very slow and spotty and,

164
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:03,815
Speaker 4:  But but platform support, you mean Apple and Google, right?

165
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:07,855
Speaker 6:  I mean the ecosystems, the smart home ecosystems. Yeah. Who you know, and

166
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:11,455
Speaker 6:  that's interoperability. Working with every ecosystem

167
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:15,575
Speaker 6:  is kind of the, the most consumer facing element of matter. Like

168
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,975
Speaker 6:  oh great, I can buy this smart lock or this smart plug and I don't need to

169
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:22,375
Speaker 6:  worry whether it works with Apple or works with Alexa. If it works with Matter,

170
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:26,335
Speaker 6:  it will work with whichever smart and platform I want to use. And I may start

171
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,055
Speaker 6:  out with Apple Home and then decide, actually I wanna upgrade and work with

172
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:33,895
Speaker 6:  Home Assistant as we will talk about later. But Als, you know, and I can

173
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:36,975
Speaker 6:  do that without having to go buy new products because everything works with

174
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:40,935
Speaker 6:  everything. However, you know that that falls apart when

175
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:45,495
Speaker 6:  we say, oh, this Smart fridge is matter compatible, there

176
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:49,455
Speaker 6:  is one out there that we couldn buy. I'm guessing it's not the one you bought,

177
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:53,525
Speaker 6:  Eli, sadly. But I go to my Apple Home

178
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,605
Speaker 6:  app and I scan my matter code thinking well it's matter And it works with

179
00:11:56,605 --> 00:12:00,485
Speaker 6:  Apple and no, because Apple doesn't support fridges yet. You know, there's

180
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:04,405
Speaker 6:  a lot of this. So we're still waiting for the ecosystems to catch up

181
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:08,765
Speaker 6:  with support for what the CSA connectivity

182
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:12,045
Speaker 6:  Standards Alliance, the group behind Matter is rolling out with each new

183
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:15,565
Speaker 6:  spec and each new spec release when we're getting two a year.

184
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:19,685
Speaker 6:  So that there's, there's about, they're getting a, the, the ecosystems are

185
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:23,485
Speaker 6:  getting like a C minus there at the moment. There just isn't. That's

186
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:26,005
Speaker 4:  Great enough. I just wanna be clear that that's great inflation. Great

187
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:26,445
Speaker 6:  Inflation.

188
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:30,805
Speaker 3:  I don't know, I feel like a C is a strong, like you tried, you didn't

189
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:34,805
Speaker 3:  try a lot, but you did try. You, you filled out

190
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:35,965
Speaker 3:  all the answers on the test,

191
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:41,125
Speaker 3:  which is just C you did the whole scan tr C, C.

192
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:45,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Well and the other problem we have there is that these were all supposed

193
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:49,005
Speaker 6:  to be device types are supposed to work in one platform

194
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:52,605
Speaker 6:  or on two platforms or three platforms or up to five platforms, right? So

195
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,925
Speaker 6:  when you add something to Google Home, you should then be able to put it

196
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:59,085
Speaker 6:  in Samsung Smart things relatively easily. That process

197
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:02,965
Speaker 6:  for different, not in every case, but in a lot of cases has been very

198
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,925
Speaker 6:  difficult, doesn't always work and frustrating to use.

199
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:11,005
Speaker 6:  And that is where I would say we, we, they get a D for

200
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:14,805
Speaker 6:  that kind of interoperability fair. And the CSA basically came along and

201
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:18,125
Speaker 6:  said, we actually have to fix this and tell you how to do it because you're

202
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,445
Speaker 6:  not doing it yourself very well.

203
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:23,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah, well can, can I just put that it, make that very real for

204
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:27,685
Speaker 4:  listeners. What, what you're describing is I set up my house

205
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:31,965
Speaker 4:  in Apple home on my phone, right? I'm like, here are all

206
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,805
Speaker 4:  the rooms in my house, there's a bedroom, there's a bathroom, there's a garage,

207
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:38,765
Speaker 4:  there's a front door, whatever that is. And then the second I want to

208
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:42,645
Speaker 4:  use that in Google Home or Samsung Smart things, I

209
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:46,535
Speaker 4:  gotta do it all again. Right? Like that level of

210
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,655
Speaker 4:  interoperability just doesn't exist anywhere.

211
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:52,535
Speaker 6:  Well and not completely do it all again. Like that's what you used to have

212
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:56,135
Speaker 6:  to do. You used to have to then like, you know, reset up a device

213
00:13:56,455 --> 00:14:00,335
Speaker 6:  entirely. But now there is some communication. So

214
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:04,015
Speaker 6:  you go into your home Apple Home app, you take a code

215
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:08,095
Speaker 6:  and then you go into your Smart Things app and you paste that code in.

216
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:12,535
Speaker 6:  And that's supposed to make it like that's slightly fewer steps than

217
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:16,495
Speaker 6:  it would've been prior where you might have to link to your Samsung account

218
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,655
Speaker 6:  and connect to the cloud and put in your password and your username and then

219
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:23,975
Speaker 6:  sync the devices and rename the devices in your platform, your new

220
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:27,535
Speaker 6:  ecosystem. So there's a, there's some fewer steps with Matter

221
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:31,655
Speaker 6:  multimin and it's all working locally. No cloud dependency, no need to

222
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:35,175
Speaker 6:  sign up for an account. Well I mean you need to sign up for a Google Home

223
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:38,335
Speaker 6:  or a Samsung account, but depending on the platform you're using. But what

224
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,295
Speaker 6:  we are not getting yet, what they've promised us now and

225
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:46,215
Speaker 6:  that's coming, hopefully coming soon, is a theme of

226
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:50,135
Speaker 6:  this for sure is that you're going to be able to, when

227
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:54,005
Speaker 6:  you set something up in, in Google Home, if you've already authorized

228
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:57,845
Speaker 6:  Samsung Smart things, it will automatically show up in that

229
00:14:57,845 --> 00:15:00,645
Speaker 6:  other platform, which is how it should have worked from the beginning. That's

230
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,805
Speaker 6:  how everyone assumed it was gonna work. Like this is how interoperability

231
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:07,885
Speaker 6:  should work and that is something that they've said that they are working

232
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,965
Speaker 6:  hard on and that we should see hopefully next year. So

233
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,045
Speaker 6:  I dunno, maybe a C for effort.

234
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:17,205
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm sorry Jen, you're so kind.

235
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:17,845
Speaker 6:  I'm be too kind.

236
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:18,925
Speaker 4:  C for

237
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:21,805
Speaker 3:  Effort. Did you guys get effort grades in school?

238
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:25,725
Speaker 6:  No. Completion grades? My, my kids get completion grades. As long as you

239
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,285
Speaker 6:  just finish the work. This

240
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:30,405
Speaker 4:  Is why American competitiveness is falling off the charts.

241
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:34,005
Speaker 3:  Our letter grades were like the actual grade that you deserved, but then

242
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:37,645
Speaker 3:  you would also get a one, two or three for effort and a one was like

243
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:41,285
Speaker 3:  doing your best. A two was like, you're fine, you're here sometimes. And

244
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:44,845
Speaker 3:  a three was like, you're not trying hard enough. And like the great accomplishment

245
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:48,445
Speaker 3:  was to get like an A plus three in a class, which is like you're doing the

246
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:50,045
Speaker 3:  least but crushing it really

247
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:51,725
Speaker 6:  Good. And I mean like

248
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:56,045
Speaker 3:  I feel like matters effort, grades could use a little work.

249
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:56,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Well

250
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:01,085
Speaker 6:  I know Nila, you look very perplexed, But first of

251
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:01,445
Speaker 3:  All I

252
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:05,965
Speaker 4:  You talking about like, you take the test, you get a hundred percent and

253
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,565
Speaker 4:  then you move on and you smoke cigarettes behind the Fieldhouse. Like that

254
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:12,525
Speaker 4:  was school for me, but I with matter like C

255
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:16,475
Speaker 4:  for effort is a real, I see, I see that there is

256
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,315
Speaker 4:  effort. I think I'm just stuck on the,

257
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:24,715
Speaker 4:  the end. Everyone agrees on what the end product is. Yeah. Which is

258
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:28,435
Speaker 4:  just, you buy whatever you want And it all works together. And maybe there's

259
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:31,755
Speaker 4:  a little bit of setup, like you need to tell the Google Home like, hey, I

260
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:35,525
Speaker 4:  already have a smart home. Like there's smart lights and all these

261
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:39,405
Speaker 4:  rooms. Like go find them. And it needs to immediately learn

262
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:42,685
Speaker 4:  everything that you've set up in whatever other system, right? You've already

263
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:45,245
Speaker 4:  set up all your rooms in Alexa and you've already assigned all the lights

264
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:49,045
Speaker 4:  to whatever rooms and then you buy a Google Nest hub. 'cause you want the

265
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:51,245
Speaker 4:  photo frame feature And it already just knows what you're talking about.

266
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:55,965
Speaker 4:  It just feels like the industry, there's a negative incentive

267
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:59,965
Speaker 4:  to do that. Like they don't want to, they know they have to, right?

268
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:04,085
Speaker 4:  They, they know that in order for any of this to happen at scale

269
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:08,165
Speaker 4:  for mainstream consumers, they've got, they've got to make this all work.

270
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:11,725
Speaker 4:  They've got to make it simpler. They, none of them wanna make light bulbs

271
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:14,925
Speaker 4:  and light switches on their own. Like as much as I think there's probably

272
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:18,925
Speaker 4:  a proprietary Apple light bulbs somewhere in a design lab like Apple knows

273
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:22,765
Speaker 4:  that's a bad product for it to make. So it, it needs the ecosystem

274
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:25,845
Speaker 4:  to be cross compatible. And indeed, I think Jen, they, they basically like

275
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:29,965
Speaker 4:  gave HomeKit to matter. They're like, just use this. Yeah. Like we

276
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,645
Speaker 4:  made it, it's pretty good. Just use it. But there's still the negative

277
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:37,445
Speaker 4:  incentive of we should put all of our effort into making it work all the

278
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:41,005
Speaker 4:  way, all the effort is on like what if we lit up the vacuum cleaner

279
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:44,885
Speaker 4:  support or what if my, the only reason to use

280
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:48,365
Speaker 4:  the app on my fridge is there's a button in the app that makes it make ice

281
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:52,245
Speaker 4:  faster for 12 hours. Right? That's it is an amazing

282
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:56,085
Speaker 4:  button. Incredible button. And like sometimes I'm on the couch,

283
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:59,605
Speaker 4:  I'm like, fuck yeah. More ice. Like I hit the button and like, I can't

284
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:03,005
Speaker 4:  imagine that some Apple designer's gonna put that button in the control set.

285
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:06,205
Speaker 4:  Like it's never gonna happen. Right? Like there's all this effort on doing

286
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:09,485
Speaker 4:  this stuff that isn't even gonna be useful stuff And it doesn't feel like

287
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:13,205
Speaker 4:  there's a lot of effort on I think what you're calling multimin. Yeah.

288
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:16,605
Speaker 4:  Where you just buy something and it's like, I'm in your smart house. Yeah.

289
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:20,045
Speaker 4:  Like here's all the controls. It's super interoperable and like exactly what

290
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:23,525
Speaker 4:  you wanted. And that, that to me is like, that's not a C, that's like

291
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:27,285
Speaker 4:  D minus for multimin effort.

292
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:30,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah, well you're right. There's no incentive for them to do it. But if they

293
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:34,405
Speaker 6:  don't make, if matter doesn't work at its basic foundational level,

294
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:38,325
Speaker 6:  then it, it takes away the incentive for them

295
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:41,885
Speaker 6:  to use matter in the first place. Like it's, it's a real sort of flywheel

296
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:45,685
Speaker 6:  here in that they need, they need matter because we need to make the

297
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:49,165
Speaker 6:  smart home simpler. It is too complicated for people these days, you know,

298
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:52,845
Speaker 6:  for most average homeowners who are looking or you know,

299
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:56,205
Speaker 6:  renters who are looking to smarten their home, it's too complicated.

300
00:18:56,665 --> 00:19:00,285
Speaker 6:  And this, the entire purpose here is to make it easier, but

301
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:04,525
Speaker 6:  it's like the swan, you know, it's meant to look all sleek

302
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:08,325
Speaker 6:  and wonderful on top, but on the underneath it's like crazed because

303
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:12,285
Speaker 6:  there's so much that has to happen to make it easy. It's very hard

304
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,405
Speaker 6:  to make something simple.

305
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:17,445
Speaker 3:  And it does feel like you as the user still have to know too much of that

306
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:21,165
Speaker 3:  stuff. Like we just have to get to the point where border

307
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:22,965
Speaker 3:  router is not a terminal person

308
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:23,805
Speaker 6:  Needs, needs to know not

309
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,445
Speaker 3:  Something. Yeah. And it doesn't feel like we're there yet.

310
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:28,205
Speaker 6:  That's what they're pushing for though. And that's what I hear, I hear from

311
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:31,645
Speaker 6:  the CSA all the time. It's like you shouldn't need to know about what matter

312
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:34,645
Speaker 6:  is, it should just work. Just like you don't need really, most people don't

313
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:38,605
Speaker 6:  really know what Bluetooth is or what wifi is or what electricity like

314
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,085
Speaker 6:  it. You just plug it in And it Well,

315
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:43,125
Speaker 4:  Can I just disagree? First of all, I have a number of things to say about

316
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,165
Speaker 4:  this one. Most people are so deeply

317
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,085
Speaker 4:  painfully aware of Bluetooth.

318
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:51,605
Speaker 3:  Jen, I'm so angry. You just bought our Bluetooth. This just this, this just,

319
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:55,165
Speaker 3:  this just completely derailed If you our fun holiday episode because now

320
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,965
Speaker 3:  Neil's gonna be mad about for

321
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:57,645
Speaker 4:  An Christmas

322
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:03,245
Speaker 4:  thoughts on Bluetooth. I'm just saying like, I hear companies say

323
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,205
Speaker 4:  this all the time. Most people should know how it works. Like Yeah, it should.

324
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:10,565
Speaker 4:  It's just magic. And it's like, dude, everybody is constantly like, my Bluetooth

325
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:13,085
Speaker 4:  doesn't connect, my car doesn't work. Like yeah, super. What is the wifi

326
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:16,685
Speaker 4:  password is a thing people say every day of their lives. Like you're aware

327
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:20,085
Speaker 4:  of this stuff. Yes. Whether or not you want to be, it's how it works.

328
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:24,205
Speaker 4:  And then I think that that is a rhetorical

329
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:27,765
Speaker 4:  move that in particular the, the matter folks use

330
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:31,045
Speaker 4:  because it doesn't work. So If you knew how it was supposed to work, you

331
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:34,085
Speaker 4:  knew if it was working or not, you'd be able to evaluate whether it was good,

332
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:34,565
Speaker 4:  whether

333
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:35,845
Speaker 6:  It was any good. Yes. Right.

334
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:38,805
Speaker 4:  And we're just at this turn where it's like, well if we just pretend it's

335
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:42,525
Speaker 4:  magic, you'll be like, that magic's a little less good than the magic I thought.

336
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:44,885
Speaker 4:  And it's like, that doesn't make any sense. It just doesn't work. And that,

337
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:45,925
Speaker 4:  like that to me is like,

338
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:50,375
Speaker 4:  I want more people to have smart, I I think it's cool to have a smart house,

339
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,295
Speaker 4:  like a bunch of my house is smart. It's neat. Yeah. But it's,

340
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:58,295
Speaker 4:  it's at its best when it is invisible. But making it invisible required

341
00:20:58,295 --> 00:21:01,775
Speaker 4:  me to know how to make it like to know what I wanted to

342
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:02,335
Speaker 4:  disappear.

343
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:03,615
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,295
Speaker 4:  Right. And like there's just a part where it's like, just let it be a computer.

345
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:09,615
Speaker 4:  Just just say this is a computer and we couldn use it.

346
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:13,495
Speaker 4:  And then a lot of people I think will dive head first and being like, I'm

347
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:14,415
Speaker 4:  gonna do some computer stuff.

348
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:18,895
Speaker 6:  Well I don't think that's, I think that's where we're gonna get eventually

349
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:22,655
Speaker 6:  it will, there will be sort of a system in our homes, just like we have

350
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,655
Speaker 6:  an electrical panel, we're gonna have a smart home panel that is

351
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,855
Speaker 6:  controlling because, but I think we have to get to the point where the use

352
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,535
Speaker 6:  cases are more compelling for the average user. Mm. Like people

353
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,255
Speaker 6:  need to want to do more than just have their lights turn on when they walk

354
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:41,215
Speaker 6:  into a room. There needs to be compelling reasons to make your home smart

355
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:45,215
Speaker 6:  beyond just single, single use cases. Like having a smart lock because

356
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:49,215
Speaker 6:  you always lose your keys or having a smart garage door opener

357
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:52,815
Speaker 6:  because you've insist on having your door open automatically as you

358
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,295
Speaker 6:  drive around the corner. Yeah. Because

359
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,775
Speaker 3:  The button right above your head is too hard to press.

360
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:01,655
Speaker 6:  You know, and, and there are things, there are things that we're seeing coming

361
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:05,655
Speaker 6:  through matter and through other areas like energy management where I, you

362
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:09,095
Speaker 6:  could see that the, those kind of use cases are, you know, going to

363
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:13,375
Speaker 6:  bring the smart home into sharper focus. And I feel like once we get to think

364
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,815
Speaker 6:  those kind of clearer use cases that come from outside of the smart home

365
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,815
Speaker 6:  as well from you know, your electricity company or your cable company

366
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:25,095
Speaker 6:  who are bringing these types of features into your home, then we might start

367
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,615
Speaker 6:  to see more mass adoption around the smart home and

368
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:32,215
Speaker 6:  companies jumping into it. And that's what matter is gonna hopefully help

369
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:36,135
Speaker 6:  with making it easier for companies to come into

370
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:39,655
Speaker 6:  the smart home. Like we're already seeing, and this is one area where I give

371
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:43,375
Speaker 6:  them a good grade, more devices. We are not seeing, I haven't seen

372
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:47,215
Speaker 6:  enough new device types like fridges and stuff, but

373
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:51,095
Speaker 6:  we are seeing more less expensive gadgets that we couldn

374
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:54,975
Speaker 6:  go and buy that are gonna work with all the smart home platforms. So there

375
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:58,335
Speaker 6:  are a lot more Apple Home compatible devices now with Matter for example,

376
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,295
Speaker 6:  than there were even, you know, a year ago we couldn buy a

377
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:06,255
Speaker 6:  smart switch for like $20 now that will work with Apple Home.

378
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:09,695
Speaker 6:  That did not used to be the case. It was like $50 If you were lucky

379
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:14,095
Speaker 6:  If you got it on sale. So we are seeing, you know, it become more

380
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:18,055
Speaker 6:  accessible, I guess Matter is helping make more

381
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:21,935
Speaker 6:  gadgets more accessible and you know, we are also,

382
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:26,295
Speaker 6:  we haven't, I am hearing some complaints from manufacturers that it is

383
00:23:26,295 --> 00:23:30,175
Speaker 6:  still very expensive and complicated to be a matter device and

384
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,935
Speaker 6:  that's a bit of a roadblock because it's only gonna work when there

385
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,535
Speaker 6:  are more, when there's critical mass, when there's a lot that works with

386
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:41,295
Speaker 6:  Matter. Matter can't be a niche protocol like ZigBee or

387
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:45,205
Speaker 6:  Z-Wave has been. It, it has to be more general and

388
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:46,405
Speaker 6:  more mass market.

389
00:23:46,515 --> 00:23:49,565
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Matter can't be an upgrade. Like I feel like it's very important that

390
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:53,165
Speaker 3:  Matter cannot cost more in order for this to work. Yeah. And like ultimately

391
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:57,245
Speaker 3:  you would want all this smart home stuff to be the

392
00:23:57,275 --> 00:24:00,405
Speaker 3:  cost of the regular things. Right? Right. Mila keeps telling me how great

393
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,165
Speaker 3:  the Lutron Seder light switches are. Yeah. And the yeah, the

394
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:07,725
Speaker 3:  Kade stuff looks awesome. Holy god. Is it expensive? Expensive.

395
00:24:08,505 --> 00:24:11,845
Speaker 3:  And So I like, we we get to a point where it's like I'm, I'm fine with it

396
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:14,565
Speaker 3:  being a little more expensive where it's like you, you get, you get more

397
00:24:14,765 --> 00:24:18,085
Speaker 3:  features, it should be a little more but to like five or 10 x the price of

398
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:21,525
Speaker 3:  my light switch in order to connect it to the internet is just, you're just

399
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:22,805
Speaker 3:  gonna lose almost everybody.

400
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:26,285
Speaker 6:  And you know, those are actually their cheapest products. Yeah. Lutron, I

401
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:29,925
Speaker 6:  guess Lutron's actually in the high end. Yeah, I know. And

402
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:33,765
Speaker 6:  Lutron is part of the CSA but they have not done anything with Matter and

403
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:34,685
Speaker 6:  there's a few companies like

404
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:36,245
Speaker 3:  That who're just counting all their money. They're like, we we're, we're

405
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:36,285
Speaker 3:  good.

406
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:37,165
Speaker 4:  They're good, don't worry about it.

407
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:37,565
Speaker 3:  I

408
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:40,885
Speaker 6:  Mean, they've said to me, you know, we're just, we are here, we're we're

409
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:44,845
Speaker 6:  talking. We want to see what it's, what value it could bring

410
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:48,765
Speaker 6:  our customers. And at the moment I guess they don't see anything, any value

411
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:51,485
Speaker 6:  because they already work with all the platforms and they already work locally

412
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:55,245
Speaker 6:  in your home, but you have to have a bridge. So, and

413
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:59,205
Speaker 6:  that's one area that matter has, has failed miserably. And

414
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:03,205
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna give it a really bad grade, is being, being

415
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:06,645
Speaker 6:  getting rid of bridges and hubs and apps. That was one of the big

416
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:10,805
Speaker 6:  promises of Matter. Simplicity, no bridges, no

417
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:14,525
Speaker 6:  hubs and and easy to set up and No,

418
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,565
Speaker 6:  but actually we can, can

419
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:22,245
Speaker 4:  I use the, the Lutron example not to Cape for Lutron, but

420
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:26,485
Speaker 4:  I, we, we have Canda switches the hub, there's a hub, you have to buy a little

421
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:30,245
Speaker 4:  hub. It's itty bitty thing. Right. And, and you look at it,

422
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:33,925
Speaker 4:  you're like, this will never reach my entire house. But I think Lutron has

423
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:37,045
Speaker 4:  their, they bought, they bought their own little slice of wireless spectrum

424
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:42,005
Speaker 4:  so they're just able to do it and like this little hub just like

425
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:44,805
Speaker 4:  works like light sutures are outside, they're upstairs, they're in the attic,

426
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:47,365
Speaker 4:  they're in the basement and this one hub is able to talk to them all. Yeah.

427
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:51,325
Speaker 4:  And most other smart home things do not do that. No.

428
00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:54,965
Speaker 4:  Like Ring I think runs on Z-Wave and you need to put Ring

429
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:58,285
Speaker 4:  extend like little Z-Wave extenders all over your house to cover the whole

430
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:58,605
Speaker 4:  house for

431
00:25:58,605 --> 00:25:59,405
Speaker 6:  The security system.

432
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:02,285
Speaker 4:  For the security system for like the door sensors and whatever else. And

433
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:06,245
Speaker 4:  like, that's the reality of so many of these products is like

434
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:10,085
Speaker 4:  the radio protocols, If you don't have great wifi throughout your house,

435
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:14,445
Speaker 4:  matter might fall down and then you, you're like, well then Matter is gonna

436
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:17,645
Speaker 4:  come with this other protocol called Thread. Thread. Yeah. Which is the,

437
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:21,365
Speaker 4:  the radio protocol that matter should run on, which is lower power. And now

438
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:25,325
Speaker 4:  we need to have thread border routers in HomeKit Minis and

439
00:26:25,465 --> 00:26:28,685
Speaker 4:  arrows and whatever else is gonna have 'em. And that stuff doesn't all talk

440
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:32,525
Speaker 4:  to each other yet. And you're kind of just like, well I get why the Lutron

441
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:36,445
Speaker 4:  switch is really expensive, right? Like this one itty bitty, it works

442
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:40,285
Speaker 4:  like it looks like nothing. Like it looks like it shouldn't work and it's

443
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:43,565
Speaker 4:  like in a closet in my basement And it totally works great. And that's what

444
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:44,405
Speaker 4:  everyone's competing with.

445
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:48,485
Speaker 6:  Well and it's, it's kind of a shame because as you'd mentioned,

446
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:52,125
Speaker 6:  matter was created with several different

447
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:57,665
Speaker 6:  sub protocols, standards and what was already there. Like Apple

448
00:26:57,695 --> 00:27:01,065
Speaker 6:  donated Home kit, Amazon donated, donated fast pair,

449
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:05,225
Speaker 6:  Google helped with casting. Like there, there are so many

450
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:08,385
Speaker 6:  things that different companies came together to bring to

451
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:12,665
Speaker 6:  matter and if only Luron could have brought its we

452
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:16,585
Speaker 6:  donating your custom spectrum. Yeah. Instead of

453
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:19,985
Speaker 6:  threat. Not, I mean threat has its use cases in some areas.

454
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:24,345
Speaker 6:  Lighting has been one area that it does. They've tried to shoehorn lighting

455
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,585
Speaker 6:  into thread And it just doesn't seem to be working very well. And we've been

456
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:31,305
Speaker 6:  running into a lot of issues. Nano Leaf and the Cara Nano Leaf, which was

457
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:35,065
Speaker 6:  all in on Thread has really backpedaled and has created

458
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:38,825
Speaker 6:  its own its own protocol. Perfect. Perfect.

459
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:43,985
Speaker 6:  So yeah, there've been issues with Thread. I mean Thread was supposed to,

460
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:48,025
Speaker 6:  so Matter doesn't have to work on thread just to make that clear. We couldn

461
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:50,865
Speaker 6:  have Matter without thread. We couldn have matter over wifi and in theory

462
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:54,665
Speaker 6:  Matter could work over other protocols too, which just hasn't, that hasn't

463
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:58,665
Speaker 6:  happened yet, but we've got Matter over. You've got But Thread also needs

464
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:02,825
Speaker 6:  a software layer. It needs an application layer. So Thread has to have Matter

465
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:06,955
Speaker 6:  or it can have HomeKit or it could have another application layer, which

466
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:10,755
Speaker 6:  is, you know, so that's getting sort of into the specky details. But you,

467
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:14,435
Speaker 6:  we couldn have Matter without Thread. Thread was developed specifically to

468
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:18,355
Speaker 6:  be an IOT protocol, which is, and for the smart home,

469
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:21,555
Speaker 6:  which is why a lot of people put a lot of faith into it thinking it's going

470
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:25,115
Speaker 6:  to solve a lot of these problems that we've already sh that we've shoehorned

471
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:28,795
Speaker 6:  other protocols into like Bluetooth, there are lots of Bluetooth

472
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:31,755
Speaker 6:  mesh smart lights out there. I still see companies launching Bluetooth mesh

473
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:33,875
Speaker 6:  Smart lights and I'm like, why are you doing this?

474
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:39,835
Speaker 6:  But that and Thread is supposed to, you know, it's low power,

475
00:28:40,495 --> 00:28:44,235
Speaker 6:  low bandwidth mesh networking. It has all of these

476
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:45,595
Speaker 6:  what sound like great

477
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:51,275
Speaker 6:  attributes for a smart home. But it's, it, the Launch

478
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:55,355
Speaker 6:  with Matter I think and into such a, a small protocol

479
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:59,075
Speaker 6:  into such a big space has has caused some

480
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:03,155
Speaker 6:  significant problems and thread released. It's

481
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,755
Speaker 6:  1.4 Pro Spec this year, which was basically

482
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:10,835
Speaker 6:  we've seen how thread's working in the real world and now here's everything

483
00:29:10,835 --> 00:29:14,675
Speaker 6:  we're gonna fix to make it work properly. And people are interested

484
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:17,955
Speaker 6:  in thread. Like I get comments all the time on my articles like why isn't

485
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:20,515
Speaker 6:  this work with Thread? Why are there so few thread devices I want thread

486
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:24,035
Speaker 6:  in my home. It's reliable, it works well, but it

487
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:28,315
Speaker 6:  yeah, it's the, the two together have, have caused a lot of

488
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:33,315
Speaker 6:  it's two standards working from two with,

489
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:37,755
Speaker 6:  and I hear this a lot from the CSA, you know, we are a member driven organization,

490
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:41,765
Speaker 6:  lots of us are talking to create this, so there's no one person kind of leading

491
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:45,445
Speaker 6:  it and The Thread group's the same. I mean Apple, Google, Samsung,

492
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:49,125
Speaker 6:  they're all part of The Thread group as well. Apple and Google are all

493
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:53,125
Speaker 6:  in on thread though, and I think that's why we're seeing so much momentum

494
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:57,285
Speaker 6:  or so much push for thread. But you're not seeing it so

495
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:01,205
Speaker 6:  much from the other platforms that, I mean there are long for

496
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:04,925
Speaker 6:  the ride, but Apple and Google are the ones that are really pushing it,

497
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:05,685
Speaker 6:  which

498
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:08,645
Speaker 4:  Is, and Apple can't just do the thing it usually does, which is like, here's

499
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:12,285
Speaker 4:  the new MacBook, it has no radios except for a thread radio. Right, right.

500
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:13,525
Speaker 4:  Like that's how Apple Drive

501
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,285
Speaker 6:  Would like to do that. They would, I

502
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:18,405
Speaker 4:  Mean there's, there's random thread radios and like the new phones and no

503
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:22,285
Speaker 4:  one knows why. Like they're doing kind of the move they usually do, but

504
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:26,045
Speaker 4:  with USBC or whatever. Yeah. They were just like, yeah, we took everything

505
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:29,525
Speaker 4:  else away. Like, would you like to use your MacBook? Right. Welcome to Dongle

506
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:32,885
Speaker 4:  Town. Like you, they can't do that with Thread in the same way. No, And it

507
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:36,645
Speaker 4:  feels like that's because no one can just make the push in that way.

508
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:37,925
Speaker 4:  It's going very slowly.

509
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:41,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah. What's the line of Camel is just a horse designed by committee, right?

510
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:45,045
Speaker 3:  Like it feels like this is, it is, this is the camel of the smart

511
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:45,685
Speaker 3:  home right now.

512
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:49,165
Speaker 4:  It does feel like every holiday spectacular episode just ends with the, the

513
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,005
Speaker 4:  slow, somewhat depressing reveal that it's just politics.

514
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:57,245
Speaker 6:  There's a lot of politics in this one that is for

515
00:30:57,245 --> 00:30:59,765
Speaker 4:  Sure does how does, how does the standard work and it's like people yell

516
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:00,925
Speaker 4:  at each other until they die.

517
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:06,085
Speaker 3:  Well on that holiday, you know, Jen, give us, give us a

518
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,405
Speaker 3:  big overall matter grade and then we're gonna take a break and play some

519
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:10,925
Speaker 3:  games. What do you think matters? 2024.

520
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:14,935
Speaker 3:  Wow.

521
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:18,775
Speaker 6:  Wow. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to go with a D

522
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:19,935
Speaker 4:  Present.

523
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:22,255
Speaker 3:  Present D Yeah, it showed up.

524
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:26,615
Speaker 6:  It showed up, it made some effort. Okay. It got a few

525
00:31:26,615 --> 00:31:30,375
Speaker 6:  things right, but it's still got a lot of room for improvement.

526
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:34,775
Speaker 3:  I think the D is right because it's like, it's like the grade you give to

527
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:37,095
Speaker 3:  the kid who's like not doing great, but you kind of don't want them to be

528
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,815
Speaker 3:  your problem anymore so you just sort of pass them onto the next year. Wow.

529
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:43,575
Speaker 4:  I feel like I learned, I've learned so much about both of your

530
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:46,735
Speaker 3:  Stories. I'm not, not saying I was that kid, I'm just saying people in history

531
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:50,655
Speaker 3:  have been that kid that there's just like, you go be somebody else's

532
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:53,335
Speaker 3:  problem And it feels like, feels like that's, that's where we are with matter.

533
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:55,135
Speaker 3:  It's like it's it's it's moving on. There's a lot,

534
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,655
Speaker 6:  It's going along. There's a lot of potential. I am, I know you, we love this

535
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:02,615
Speaker 6:  word, but there really is, I mean the foundation

536
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:06,415
Speaker 6:  is there, there's just a lot of building work we that still needs to be done,

537
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:11,255
Speaker 3:  But the vibes seem good. The people who need to think matter is gonna work

538
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:12,815
Speaker 3:  still think matter is gonna work, right?

539
00:32:12,815 --> 00:32:16,575
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. I need to say you are completely wrong from your predictions at

540
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:17,975
Speaker 6:  the same, sorry, I should have started.

541
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,455
Speaker 3:  I hope I'm wrong. To be clear,

542
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:21,935
Speaker 4:  What was your prediction? That matter would just go

543
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:23,455
Speaker 3:  Away. That everybody's gonna give up on matter,

544
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:25,535
Speaker 6:  Just give up on matter by the end of 2025

545
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:35,645
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. Liam James, our producer and

546
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:39,605
Speaker 3:  mc and game show host is here. Liam High.

547
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:44,045
Speaker 1:  Hey everybody, it's, it's that time, it's our annual tradition to

548
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:48,005
Speaker 1:  play some games around the spec that we've picked out and

549
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:52,325
Speaker 1:  also it just kinda gives me a chance as your producer to play evil

550
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:55,485
Speaker 1:  games with you and make you look silly in front of everyone. So really this

551
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:56,165
Speaker 1:  is my favorite time

552
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:59,205
Speaker 3:  Of year. You should also play these games with your family by the way. Oh

553
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:02,765
Speaker 3:  yeah. Everybody told me last year that USBC Bingo was a big hit all around,

554
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:04,925
Speaker 3:  all around the tree. People loved it.

555
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:08,445
Speaker 1:  I love that. Yeah. Okay, great. We're gonna start with the match game.

556
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:12,685
Speaker 1:  Oh God, please pull out your match game cards.

557
00:38:13,635 --> 00:38:17,045
Speaker 4:  This, if we give this to people to print out and they hand this out to their

558
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:17,285
Speaker 4:  family,

559
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:21,645
Speaker 6:  We will be doing the CSAA big favorite educating

560
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:21,845
Speaker 1:  The

561
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:24,805
Speaker 3:  Public. If you'd like your family to not wanna speak to you for several days,

562
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:26,605
Speaker 3:  please suggest playing this game.

563
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:31,605
Speaker 1:  Okay. Lemme tell you how it goes. On the left of your, of your player

564
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:34,965
Speaker 1:  card, you have seven different matter

565
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:39,405
Speaker 1:  specific things. I'm just gonna be as vague as I can and

566
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:41,925
Speaker 1:  on the right you have the descriptions,

567
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:46,845
Speaker 1:  definitions, really of those seven things, what each of you

568
00:38:46,845 --> 00:38:50,725
Speaker 1:  need to do is draw lines from the items listed on

569
00:38:50,725 --> 00:38:54,645
Speaker 1:  the left to the definitions on the right. We will

570
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:56,005
Speaker 1:  give you two minutes to

571
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:57,885
Speaker 4:  Complete that. Some of these words are obviously fake

572
00:38:58,465 --> 00:38:58,805
Speaker 3:  Of course,

573
00:38:59,595 --> 00:38:59,885
Speaker 4:  Like

574
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:00,125
Speaker 1:  I don't

575
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,765
Speaker 4:  Out think matter, fabric is a real word. Consumer are deny that some of these

576
00:39:03,765 --> 00:39:04,165
Speaker 4:  are fake.

577
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:08,485
Speaker 1:  Let me read them out for the audience. So we've got matter device, smart

578
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:12,005
Speaker 1:  home hub matter, administrator matter,

579
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:15,645
Speaker 1:  fabric matter, controller thread,

580
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:18,485
Speaker 1:  border router and matter bridge.

581
00:39:18,865 --> 00:39:20,805
Speaker 3:  And you're telling me that these are all different things?

582
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:22,765
Speaker 1:  These are all different things. I would've

583
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:25,005
Speaker 3:  Told you three of these are synonyms. These,

584
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:29,965
Speaker 1:  These items and the definitions were pulled from the CSA

585
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:34,085
Speaker 1:  website. So, okay. Right from the source. All right. Alright, I'll start

586
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:35,125
Speaker 1:  your two minute timer. Now

587
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:40,285
Speaker 4:  Can these things be defined as themselves? There's some real

588
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:41,845
Speaker 4:  tautologies here. I would point out,

589
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:46,245
Speaker 6:  Alright, I'm done. Do it Jen. It's very messy

590
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:46,885
Speaker 6:  looking though.

591
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:52,125
Speaker 4:  Okay. I'll think I, I can't say that this is

592
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:52,965
Speaker 4:  easy to follow.

593
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:55,765
Speaker 3:  Mine is unhinged.

594
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:00,805
Speaker 4:  I don't know why I chose curving lines instead of straight lines.

595
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,085
Speaker 1:  Curving lines.

596
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:04,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah, mine. Mine looks very,

597
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:06,645
Speaker 3:  I should have just written the words next to each other.

598
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:08,125
Speaker 6:  I know. I think I, that's what I

599
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:10,285
Speaker 4:  See what I'm saying. Do that. What I, this is not normal.

600
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,605
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah. You got a little swoopy thing going on. I'm into

601
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:15,005
Speaker 1:  That. Okay. Is is everybody done? Yes.

602
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:16,845
Speaker 4:  And it as done as we're gonna be. Okay.

603
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:20,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think the way we should do this is I'm gonna go to each one of the

604
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:24,125
Speaker 1:  seven and I'll go to one each one of you

605
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,245
Speaker 1:  and you tell me what you pick.

606
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,685
Speaker 3:  Honor system. Jen, no cheating.

607
00:40:27,085 --> 00:40:30,765
Speaker 1:  Well, I'm not gonna tell you who is right until you each answer. Okay.

608
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:31,565
Speaker 1:  Matter device

609
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,965
Speaker 1:  Neli, what did you pick from matter device as the definition,

610
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:40,405
Speaker 4:  A matter device is a smart home hardware product that supports matter.

611
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:43,485
Speaker 4:  And I just want to be clear, these definitions are from the CSA, correct?

612
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:47,605
Speaker 4:  Yes. The CSA has de devi de defined a lot of things

613
00:40:47,665 --> 00:40:48,325
Speaker 4:  as themselves,

614
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:53,885
Speaker 4:  like the technological definitions here are out of control. A matter device

615
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:57,405
Speaker 4:  is a smart home product that supports matter. That's

616
00:40:57,405 --> 00:40:59,165
Speaker 1:  It. So it could be connected to and controlled by matter

617
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,005
Speaker 3:  Controller. Yeah.

618
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:03,205
Speaker 1:  Okay, great. Jen, what did you choose?

619
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,005
Speaker 6:  The same

620
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,405
Speaker 1:  One. The same one, okay. And David? I

621
00:41:07,405 --> 00:41:09,925
Speaker 3:  Said the same thing. Okay. A smart home hardware product that supports matters

622
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:12,565
Speaker 3:  so that it can be connected to and controlled by a matter controller. Right.

623
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:15,165
Speaker 3:  You are also, but then also if it's matter, it does matter. And so it matters

624
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:20,245
Speaker 4:  The, and then the devious thing, the CSA here is they lull you into

625
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:24,165
Speaker 4:  a false sense of security by defining everything as itself. A matter device

626
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:27,125
Speaker 4:  is a matter device and then they're like, and here's some other bullshit.

627
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:34,565
Speaker 1:  You are all correct. You each get three points. Hey, for

628
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:38,605
Speaker 1:  the correct answer there. Woo-hoo. Okay, moving on. Smart Home

629
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,445
Speaker 1:  hub Neli, what did you choose for that one?

630
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:45,365
Speaker 4:  A smart home hub is typically a connection point in the home for multiple

631
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:48,845
Speaker 4:  smart home devices. Usually specific to the vendor that has provided it,

632
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:52,085
Speaker 4:  which I disagree with, but that's what I picked.

633
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it isn't, it's not a great description actually. I agree.

634
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:58,685
Speaker 4:  We couldn tell the CSA has really shaded it. Yeah. To be like

635
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:01,325
Speaker 4:  these suck, you should use matter because

636
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,725
Speaker 6:  It's not typically specific to a vendor.

637
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:05,805
Speaker 1:  Did you go with that same answer? I did,

638
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:06,285
Speaker 6:  Yes. Sorry.

639
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,045
Speaker 1:  And David,

640
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:11,085
Speaker 3:  I went with the same thing. I all, I picked something else until the very

641
00:42:11,115 --> 00:42:13,445
Speaker 3:  last second and then switched to this one.

642
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:16,405
Speaker 1:  Okay, tell me what the answer is. You chose again Eli.

643
00:42:16,475 --> 00:42:19,605
Speaker 4:  Typically a connection point in the home for multiple smart home devices.

644
00:42:19,755 --> 00:42:23,285
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I missed the word typically. That is correct. You all got it right?

645
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,165
Speaker 1:  Wow. Yay.

646
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:25,085
Speaker 6:  I was not expecting this.

647
00:42:26,145 --> 00:42:27,685
Speaker 4:  Oh, don't worry. The dumb ones are coming.

648
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:31,725
Speaker 1:  Okay. Alright, our next one is Matter

649
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:34,765
Speaker 1:  Administrator Neli. Which one did you pick for that?

650
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:38,645
Speaker 4:  An entity that can control matter devices. The user has

651
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:42,325
Speaker 4:  connected functionality can be built into many types of hardware devices

652
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:45,885
Speaker 4:  like phones always powered smartphone hubs that provide local and remote

653
00:42:45,885 --> 00:42:49,405
Speaker 4:  controls, smart switches, buttons or even mobile apps.

654
00:42:50,725 --> 00:42:54,285
Speaker 4:  I challenge the listener to, to

655
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:58,245
Speaker 4:  distinguish between, it can be a phone or an app on your phone.

656
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:02,845
Speaker 3:  What if your whole phone was a light switch? Think about that.

657
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:06,765
Speaker 4:  I have one phone for every

658
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:09,645
Speaker 3:  App. This is good. This is, we disagree for the first time. I had something

659
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:10,205
Speaker 3:  else for this one.

660
00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:11,685
Speaker 6:  Oh, that's, I had that one.

661
00:43:12,065 --> 00:43:14,965
Speaker 1:  That's the one you chose as well? Yes. Okay. And David, which one

662
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:17,485
Speaker 3:  Did you pick? I said a device or application that creates, maintains and

663
00:43:17,485 --> 00:43:19,685
Speaker 3:  manages security and privileges for all device on the fabric.

664
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:21,285
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah. And this round,

665
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:24,765
Speaker 4:  Which by the way that definition it sounds like it came directly out of Dune.

666
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:28,965
Speaker 4:  Welcome to the fabric. We manage the fabric.

667
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:32,965
Speaker 1:  Alright, our, our scores are finally diverging on that round.

668
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,045
Speaker 1:  Mila and Jenna, I'm sorry to tell you. You got that one wrong David, let's

669
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:37,485
Speaker 1:  go was correct? No,

670
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:39,005
Speaker 6:  No. Oh no.

671
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:39,405
Speaker 4:  This is

672
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:41,445
Speaker 6:  Like got them the wrong way round. This

673
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:43,365
Speaker 4:  Is one it begins to fall apart. Yes.

674
00:43:43,715 --> 00:43:44,205
Speaker 1:  Alright.

675
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,325
Speaker 6:  Because matter controllers are the ones that manage the,

676
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:51,005
Speaker 3:  I'm not gonna lie, security. As soon as Jen disagreed with me, I instantly

677
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:53,765
Speaker 3:  put an X next to my thing. I was like, there's no chance. You should, you

678
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:54,285
Speaker 3:  should be. I have

679
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:57,365
Speaker 6:  This right. You should have been. You need to double check this one, Liam.

680
00:43:57,755 --> 00:43:58,045
Speaker 6:  Okay.

681
00:43:58,285 --> 00:43:59,805
Speaker 1:  I will. We will. We will have

682
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:03,525
Speaker 6:  A judge. But you're right. So matter admins and matter controllers are

683
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,405
Speaker 6:  very, very, very, very, very close together. I'm

684
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:08,125
Speaker 3:  Hearing so many excuses

685
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,925
Speaker 6:  Now. No, but matter. No,

686
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:10,365
Speaker 4:  You understand a

687
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:11,205
Speaker 6:  Matter, this is what a fabric,

688
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:15,325
Speaker 4:  A matter administrator is just a bureaucrat in the government

689
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:18,365
Speaker 4:  and a matter controller controls the spice.

690
00:44:18,385 --> 00:44:20,005
Speaker 3:  Please. My father was a matter, I'm a

691
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:20,085
Speaker 4:  Fabric.

692
00:44:22,665 --> 00:44:23,325
Speaker 4:  Do you understand?

693
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,765
Speaker 1:  Okay, moving on. Matter fabric neli, which one did you

694
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:28,685
Speaker 1:  pick for matter? Fabric.

695
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:30,085
Speaker 4:  Who knows man.

696
00:44:32,395 --> 00:44:36,215
Speaker 4:  This is the one that I think the CSA is trolling us by

697
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:40,055
Speaker 4:  defining the thing as itself. So a matter of fabric matter devices are connected

698
00:44:40,215 --> 00:44:43,575
Speaker 4:  together on a virtual network within a home called a matter fabric. Yes.

699
00:44:43,735 --> 00:44:46,895
Speaker 4:  A virtual private network over which matter devices, admins and controllers

700
00:44:47,615 --> 00:44:48,295
Speaker 4:  communicate with each other.

701
00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:51,215
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Liam, I think you straight up put the answer in the one. Yes.

702
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:53,695
Speaker 1:  Yeah. As soon as I saw that

703
00:44:54,885 --> 00:44:58,855
Speaker 3:  This is a, I'm sorry we thought this a host error. It's like Jen Jennings

704
00:44:58,855 --> 00:45:01,175
Speaker 3:  just says the name of the thing when he is giving the clue on Jeopardy.

705
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:04,815
Speaker 1:  I apologize to the audience. Okay. Did we all

706
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:06,855
Speaker 3:  Get that one right? Did everyone get that one right? We all got that one.

707
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,415
Speaker 3:  All right. That

708
00:45:07,695 --> 00:45:08,015
Speaker 1:  Was a

709
00:45:08,015 --> 00:45:08,975
Speaker 3:  Freebie. Fabulous.

710
00:45:09,455 --> 00:45:10,255
Speaker 1:  Three points for

711
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:12,535
Speaker 3:  All. I just wanna point out I'm crushing it right now.

712
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:13,855
Speaker 1:  My

713
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,215
Speaker 3:  Confidence is through the roof.

714
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:18,095
Speaker 1:  It's all the hat. It's the hat. It's all the hat. It's bringing you good

715
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:22,045
Speaker 1:  vibes. Alright. Matter controller, Eli, which one did you

716
00:45:22,045 --> 00:45:23,125
Speaker 1:  choose from? Matter Controller.

717
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:25,525
Speaker 4:  Why do I always go first? I chose

718
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,205
Speaker 1:  Because it's easier for me to score.

719
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:31,365
Speaker 4:  I see Matter controller is a device or application that creates,

720
00:45:31,885 --> 00:45:34,685
Speaker 4:  maintains and manages security and privileges for all devices on the fabric.

721
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:35,325
Speaker 4:  Wrong

722
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:37,725
Speaker 1:  Jen, which

723
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:39,085
Speaker 4:  I believe is what Jen would've picked.

724
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:40,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, Jen, that's what I don't

725
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:41,445
Speaker 1:  We Jen, that's what because we are

726
00:45:41,445 --> 00:45:41,605
Speaker 4:  Correct.

727
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:46,875
Speaker 3:  David, what did you pick? An entity that can control matter devices.

728
00:45:46,935 --> 00:45:49,955
Speaker 3:  The user has connected functionality can be built into many types of hardware

729
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:53,035
Speaker 3:  devices. Like phones always powered smart hubs that provide local and remote

730
00:45:53,035 --> 00:45:55,475
Speaker 3:  control. Smart switches and buttons or even mobile apps

731
00:45:55,745 --> 00:45:59,675
Speaker 4:  Just for the listener. Right? Take this out of the weird bureaucracy of

732
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:03,155
Speaker 4:  a bunch of nerds. Designing a smart home standard and take this again into

733
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:07,035
Speaker 4:  your favorite sci-fi fantasy world Dune, for example, which I keep

734
00:46:07,275 --> 00:46:11,195
Speaker 4:  referencing. Who has the higher rank in Dune? The administrator

735
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,595
Speaker 4:  or the controller?

736
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:17,285
Speaker 4:  Hmm. See what I'm saying makes sense to me.

737
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:21,055
Speaker 3:  It's interesting. Yeah. I do feel like the administrator is the one who gets

738
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:24,135
Speaker 3:  to press all the buttons though the controller like stands behind their chair

739
00:46:24,135 --> 00:46:26,575
Speaker 3:  and yells things, but the administrator is the one who's like getting stuff

740
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:26,975
Speaker 3:  done. Yeah.

741
00:46:26,975 --> 00:46:28,495
Speaker 4:  The controller is obviously palpatine.

742
00:46:29,075 --> 00:46:32,755
Speaker 3:  Yes, correct. But like have any real power.

743
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:33,515
Speaker 3:  Think about that.

744
00:46:34,135 --> 00:46:37,715
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. You know what the, the difference here, and I didn't actually read

745
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:41,675
Speaker 6:  this properly, is that it says device or application,

746
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:45,835
Speaker 6:  whereas for the matter administrator it says an

747
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,435
Speaker 6:  entity. So a matter controller Like

748
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:50,395
Speaker 4:  A ghost. Yeah.

749
00:46:50,695 --> 00:46:54,635
Speaker 3:  An entity is definitely above a controller and an administrator by the way.

750
00:46:54,785 --> 00:46:57,235
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Matter entity is what's truly in charge here.

751
00:46:57,745 --> 00:46:58,035
Speaker 4:  Just

752
00:46:58,255 --> 00:46:59,675
Speaker 6:  So, so the administrator

753
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:00,995
Speaker 4:  Floating spirit of matter.

754
00:47:01,745 --> 00:47:05,035
Speaker 6:  This is, this is, although it does say actually If you see at the bottom

755
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:08,395
Speaker 6:  of that one an entity, it does say, or even mobile apps. So

756
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,795
Speaker 6:  it's also applications and apps.

757
00:47:11,105 --> 00:47:14,275
Speaker 3:  Both of these definitions are just like they do some stuff, whatever we want.

758
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:14,875
Speaker 3:  I don't know.

759
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:17,955
Speaker 6:  They're basically the same thing. Which they are essentially the same thing.

760
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:21,235
Speaker 6:  It's just a controller needs to be a physical device.

761
00:47:22,395 --> 00:47:23,275
Speaker 4:  Although, no, that's not true.

762
00:47:23,595 --> 00:47:27,275
Speaker 6:  I know. Well, so they originally said the apps could be controllers, but

763
00:47:27,275 --> 00:47:30,125
Speaker 6:  that how So I That has actually changed.

764
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:34,885
Speaker 6:  And apps can't ne can't be controllers on their own. They can only be

765
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,565
Speaker 6:  administrators. So these are actually app date

766
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:40,965
Speaker 6:  and I the Cs a's website.

767
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,125
Speaker 4:  You're getting away with so much because you have that accent and I want

768
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:44,325
Speaker 4:  you to,

769
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,765
Speaker 6:  But yeah, If you read, both of these descriptions are exactly the same.

770
00:47:52,545 --> 00:47:52,765
Speaker 3:  Yes.

771
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:57,045
Speaker 6:  Stories

772
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:57,525
Speaker 3:  Matter.

773
00:47:59,395 --> 00:48:02,805
Speaker 3:  It's a, it's a thing for matter Devices is the answer to every single one

774
00:48:02,865 --> 00:48:03,085
Speaker 3:  on,

775
00:48:04,065 --> 00:48:07,365
Speaker 6:  But I'm just so excited that the man who said matter is not going to exist

776
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:09,325
Speaker 6:  in a year is the one that's gonna win the quiz.

777
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:15,005
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying right now our disagreement does not, it just, it, the,

778
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,845
Speaker 4:  the root of this disagreement is whether you think an administrator is a

779
00:48:18,845 --> 00:48:22,185
Speaker 4:  higher rank than a controller. Right? That's what it's Right. A controller

780
00:48:22,185 --> 00:48:25,785
Speaker 4:  is just like we couldn turn the lights on and off. An administrator is, I

781
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,105
Speaker 4:  I you we couldn kick people outta the fabric.

782
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:32,025
Speaker 3:  Neli, I'm the entity now. Holy Ghost,

783
00:48:33,695 --> 00:48:34,425
Speaker 6:  It's Christmas.

784
00:48:34,735 --> 00:48:35,745
Speaker 3:  Alright, let's

785
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:39,425
Speaker 1:  Keep going. Yeah. Well for the purposes of of scoring, I want to

786
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:42,745
Speaker 1:  make it official that Dave got that one right. Neli

787
00:48:43,405 --> 00:48:44,025
Speaker 1:  Jen, I'm sorry

788
00:48:44,305 --> 00:48:47,785
Speaker 4:  I, but I would, I just pointing out that the connectivity standards association

789
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:48,305
Speaker 4:  got it wrong.

790
00:48:51,135 --> 00:48:54,505
Speaker 3:  This is how Neli got hundreds on his tests. By the way. Our just

791
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:55,105
Speaker 4:  Argue my way

792
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:55,665
Speaker 6:  On arguing.

793
00:48:56,995 --> 00:48:57,825
Speaker 3:  We've got two more.

794
00:48:57,925 --> 00:48:58,425
Speaker 4:  Two was wrong.

795
00:48:58,875 --> 00:48:59,225
Speaker 3:  We've

796
00:48:59,225 --> 00:49:02,825
Speaker 1:  Got two more. The next one our favorite, The Thread border

797
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:04,945
Speaker 1:  router Neli. Which one did you choose for

798
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:08,905
Speaker 4:  That? This another one that appeared to be a def, like a tautological definition,

799
00:49:09,265 --> 00:49:12,345
Speaker 4:  a thread. Border router enables thread devices to connect to the local network

800
00:49:12,685 --> 00:49:15,985
Speaker 4:  so they're able to communicate with other IP based devices built on technology

801
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:17,105
Speaker 4:  such as wifi or ethernet.

802
00:49:17,685 --> 00:49:18,625
Speaker 1:  Yes. What'd you pick

803
00:49:18,935 --> 00:49:19,385
Speaker 6:  That one?

804
00:49:19,455 --> 00:49:20,745
Speaker 1:  Same one, David? Yes.

805
00:49:21,055 --> 00:49:24,465
Speaker 3:  This was the closest I came to getting one wrong because I'm a genius

806
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:28,545
Speaker 3:  and again, there are going to be two in a row that sound very much exactly

807
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:30,385
Speaker 3:  the same, but I said the same thing.

808
00:49:30,615 --> 00:49:33,905
Speaker 1:  Okay, great. You all got it. Correct. Three points for everyone.

809
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:36,825
Speaker 1:  Last one matter. Bridge

810
00:49:37,325 --> 00:49:41,185
Speaker 4:  Matter bridge translates from one protocol to another allowing non matter

811
00:49:41,195 --> 00:49:45,145
Speaker 4:  smart home devices such as those using ZigBee or Z-Wave to

812
00:49:45,145 --> 00:49:47,745
Speaker 4:  connect to, what else? A matter Fabric.

813
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:48,185
Speaker 6:  Fabric.

814
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:51,985
Speaker 6:  And that was all that's left. So yeah,

815
00:49:51,985 --> 00:49:52,465
Speaker 3:  It was got

816
00:49:52,465 --> 00:49:52,625
Speaker 6:  That one

817
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:56,665
Speaker 3:  This holiday season. Connect to the fabric, everybody

818
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:57,545
Speaker 1:  Connect to

819
00:49:57,545 --> 00:50:00,385
Speaker 3:  The fabric. Go home to your families, connect to the fabric. Alright,

820
00:50:00,645 --> 00:50:01,745
Speaker 4:  We are all one on the fabric.

821
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:05,385
Speaker 3:  I just, this is what a perfect score looks like. Look

822
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:09,025
Speaker 6:  At that. Yeah. We're going to, we're going to appeal to the higher power

823
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:12,065
Speaker 6:  Eli, to the entity, to the entity.

824
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,505
Speaker 6:  I will get the CSA to fix their website.

825
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:16,505
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

826
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:17,305
Speaker 4:  That's, that's,

827
00:50:17,325 --> 00:50:17,865
Speaker 3:  That's how you

828
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:20,225
Speaker 4:  Really win the test. You're like, I changed the book.

829
00:50:20,805 --> 00:50:24,745
Speaker 3:  You instantly win if we couldn. Yeah, that's if we couldn change, but you

830
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:27,525
Speaker 3:  have to do it before this episode publishes. That's, those are the rules.

831
00:50:27,955 --> 00:50:28,245
Speaker 1:  Okay.

832
00:50:28,845 --> 00:50:31,805
Speaker 4:  I can look, I can see the argument for administrator outranking controller,

833
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:35,285
Speaker 4:  but I'm just saying in the, in the dune universe, the, the

834
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:39,205
Speaker 4:  controller, you know, that's like a heavy word. Administrator

835
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:43,225
Speaker 4:  is never a heavy word. It's just you're like, I'm an administrator.

836
00:50:43,225 --> 00:50:46,785
Speaker 4:  It's like, great. Get outta here gray suit. Like I'm not talking

837
00:50:46,785 --> 00:50:50,025
Speaker 3:  To you. The border routers are just those like weird planes that just take

838
00:50:50,025 --> 00:50:53,465
Speaker 3:  people around. Yeah, that's, that's a border router. It doesn't do anything.

839
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:54,825
Speaker 3:  It just kind of crashes Occasionally.

840
00:50:56,925 --> 00:50:59,625
Speaker 4:  The drones. The drones over New Jersey are border routers.

841
00:51:00,415 --> 00:51:00,905
Speaker 3:  Exactly.

842
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:03,905
Speaker 1:  I think we can all agree what we learned from this game is that matter is

843
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:07,625
Speaker 1:  way more complicated than it might seem. At first glance. The

844
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:08,385
Speaker 4:  Spice must flow.

845
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:12,425
Speaker 1:  The spice must flow. Alright, we're gonna move on to our second and final

846
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:16,385
Speaker 1:  game. But before we do, I want to just quickly let our

847
00:51:16,385 --> 00:51:18,105
Speaker 1:  fans know what the scores are thus far.

848
00:51:18,395 --> 00:51:19,745
Speaker 3:  David is dominant.

849
00:51:20,295 --> 00:51:24,065
Speaker 1:  Neli Patel has 12 points so far, as does

850
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:28,305
Speaker 1:  Jen Tui and David is leading the pack right now with

851
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,105
Speaker 1:  18 points.

852
00:51:29,445 --> 00:51:32,625
Speaker 3:  Woo. I will say just very quickly, having looked at the next game,

853
00:51:33,535 --> 00:51:34,705
Speaker 3:  this is still up in the air.

854
00:51:36,615 --> 00:51:37,425
Speaker 3:  David's lead is

855
00:51:37,425 --> 00:51:39,865
Speaker 4:  Not safe. I also wanna make it clear that I know very little about Dune.

856
00:51:39,985 --> 00:51:43,305
Speaker 4:  I watched both of those movies. I slept through the first one. The second

857
00:51:43,305 --> 00:51:46,745
Speaker 4:  one was better. Never read the books. Please do not quibble with me about

858
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,545
Speaker 4:  Dune. It's very important to me. Quibble with the CSA,

859
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:54,545
Speaker 3:  But only on Dune related grounds.

860
00:51:54,785 --> 00:51:56,625
Speaker 4:  Yeah, send them notes about Dune. Yeah.

861
00:51:57,335 --> 00:52:00,265
Speaker 1:  Okay. We're gonna do Matter. Mad Libs,

862
00:52:01,445 --> 00:52:05,385
Speaker 1:  if you're not familiar with Mad Libs, mad Libs is a pre-written sentence

863
00:52:05,385 --> 00:52:09,185
Speaker 1:  with a bunch of blanks in it and a bunch of choices for those blanks for

864
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:12,785
Speaker 1:  you to fill in to make the sentence complete and make sense. So I'm gonna

865
00:52:12,785 --> 00:52:15,905
Speaker 1:  read out the sentence and the word choices and we'll give you two minutes

866
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:17,345
Speaker 1:  to fill them in. Just like last time.

867
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:20,865
Speaker 3:  No looking while he reads it. Okay. No. Starting early,

868
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:25,505
Speaker 1:  Formally known as blank. Blank is a unified connectivity

869
00:52:25,825 --> 00:52:29,665
Speaker 1:  standard developed by the blank. The protocol aims to ensure reliable,

870
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:33,385
Speaker 1:  secure, and seamless communication between smart home devices regardless

871
00:52:33,405 --> 00:52:37,145
Speaker 1:  of brand or platform. It works through blank, blank, and blank.

872
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:40,665
Speaker 1:  So it can be added to devices that support any of these protocols

873
00:52:41,185 --> 00:52:44,785
Speaker 1:  matter's. Key advantage is that it uses a standardized blank

874
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:48,825
Speaker 1:  matter lets you blank and use its devices across blank for more

875
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:52,345
Speaker 1:  choice and control so you don't end up stuck on one platform.

876
00:52:52,855 --> 00:52:56,545
Speaker 1:  Your word choices are ecosystem or ecosystems.

877
00:52:56,855 --> 00:53:00,145
Speaker 1:  Bluetooth matter, IP protocol, wifi,

878
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:03,545
Speaker 1:  chip thread, C, S, A, and pair

879
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:08,065
Speaker 3:  Matter lets you blank should be the official tagline of the

880
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:08,505
Speaker 3:  CSA.

881
00:53:10,445 --> 00:53:11,185
Speaker 1:  All right, we starting?

882
00:53:11,615 --> 00:53:15,545
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Real Vergecast nerds know the first one because Dieter thought it was

883
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:19,345
Speaker 4:  very funny. I have a question. It works through blank, blank and

884
00:53:19,345 --> 00:53:21,465
Speaker 4:  blank. Does the order matter? No.

885
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,465
Speaker 6:  I do have a correction for that one too for you. But

886
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:30,125
Speaker 1:  It's so funny. I wanted to run these by you, but then I was like, but I need,

887
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:31,205
Speaker 1:  I need her to play the game.

888
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,005
Speaker 6:  That wouldn't be fair.

889
00:53:34,535 --> 00:53:34,885
Speaker 4:  Which

890
00:53:34,885 --> 00:53:35,605
Speaker 3:  Word am I missing?

891
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:38,645
Speaker 3:  I'm not super confident.

892
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:41,085
Speaker 3:  Okay, I'm ready.

893
00:53:41,795 --> 00:53:45,725
Speaker 1:  Okay. It's looking like everyone is done. Let's reveal our answers.

894
00:53:45,825 --> 00:53:49,685
Speaker 1:  I'm gonna go one at a time, slightly different order. Let's start with you

895
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:52,165
Speaker 1:  Jen. If you could read out the sentence you completed.

896
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:55,765
Speaker 6:  Okay. Formally known as chip

897
00:53:56,955 --> 00:54:00,695
Speaker 6:  matter is a unified connectivity standard developed by the CSA.

898
00:54:01,595 --> 00:54:05,215
Speaker 6:  The protocol aims to ensure reliable, secure, and seamless

899
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,495
Speaker 6:  communication between smart home devices, regardless of the brand or platform.

900
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:13,575
Speaker 6:  It works through wifi thread and Bluetooth, so it can be added

901
00:54:13,595 --> 00:54:17,215
Speaker 6:  to devices that support any of these protocols matters. Key

902
00:54:17,215 --> 00:54:20,495
Speaker 6:  advantage is that it uses a standardized IP. Protocol

903
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:24,855
Speaker 6:  matter lets you pair and use its devices across ecosystems for more

904
00:54:24,855 --> 00:54:28,695
Speaker 6:  choice and control so you don't end up stuck on one platform.

905
00:54:29,635 --> 00:54:30,295
Speaker 4:  Nailed it.

906
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:33,815
Speaker 1:  Alright. I can't tell you the WW what you got yet.

907
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:35,335
Speaker 1:  Next we'll have David.

908
00:54:35,925 --> 00:54:39,695
Speaker 3:  Okay. Now Nervous. Formerly known as chip matter

909
00:54:39,835 --> 00:54:43,815
Speaker 3:  is a unified connectivity standard developed by the CSA. The protocol aims

910
00:54:43,815 --> 00:54:46,615
Speaker 3:  to ensure reliable, secure, and seamless communication. By the way, you should

911
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:48,655
Speaker 3:  have made all those blanks and just made us fill them in

912
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:52,975
Speaker 3:  reliable, secure, and seamless. I legitimately think we all might have gotten

913
00:54:53,045 --> 00:54:56,575
Speaker 3:  with no prompting. It's just the most like tech companies speak of all time

914
00:54:56,675 --> 00:55:00,495
Speaker 3:  anyway. The protocol aims to ensure reliable, secure, and seamless communication

915
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:03,495
Speaker 3:  between smart home devices, regardless of the brand or platform. It works

916
00:55:03,495 --> 00:55:06,815
Speaker 3:  through thread, wifi and Bluetooth so it can be added to devices that support

917
00:55:06,815 --> 00:55:10,295
Speaker 3:  any of these protocols matter's. Key advantage is that it uses a standardized

918
00:55:10,295 --> 00:55:13,895
Speaker 3:  ecosystem, which I think is wrong. Jen sounded right. Matter lets you pair

919
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:17,055
Speaker 3:  and use its devices across IP protocol, which also sounds wrong. I think

920
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:20,455
Speaker 3:  Jen is right for more choice and control so you don't end up stuck on one

921
00:55:20,695 --> 00:55:20,855
Speaker 3:  platform.

922
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:23,615
Speaker 1:  Okay. And Neli, what's yours?

923
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:27,135
Speaker 4:  I, I was also correct and I had the exact same answers as Jen.

924
00:55:27,285 --> 00:55:29,335
Speaker 3:  Well that worked out great for me last time. So

925
00:55:29,655 --> 00:55:33,535
Speaker 4:  Formerly known as Chip Matters Unified Connectivity Standard developed by

926
00:55:33,535 --> 00:55:37,375
Speaker 4:  the CSA, blah blah, blah, other sentence. It works through thread, wifi

927
00:55:37,515 --> 00:55:40,575
Speaker 4:  and Bluetooth. So we couldn be adding device and support any these protocols.

928
00:55:40,635 --> 00:55:44,015
Speaker 4:  Key advantage is use a standardized IP protocol that lets you pair and use

929
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:47,895
Speaker 4:  its devices across ecosystems for more choice and control so

930
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:51,135
Speaker 4:  you don't end up stuck on one platform. And we couldn please the controller.

931
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,535
Speaker 3:  Did we all write thread wifi and Bluetooth in that order?

932
00:55:55,665 --> 00:55:58,085
Speaker 4:  Yes. Because I think we all immediately thought of thread first. Just

933
00:55:58,265 --> 00:56:00,405
Speaker 3:  APO of nothing. That's kind of wild. And it three blanks. Three.

934
00:56:01,435 --> 00:56:03,445
Speaker 4:  Well I know Brainstorm, we know it's thread. We're like, well WiFi's there

935
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:04,805
Speaker 4:  and they're like fucking, is it Bluetooth?

936
00:56:05,045 --> 00:56:08,765
Speaker 6:  Well Bluetooth is not a protocol of matter. It's only an onboarding

937
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:10,925
Speaker 6:  protocol. The other one is ethernet.

938
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:15,285
Speaker 4:  Liam, I want for the listener. Liam has had no response to this

939
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:16,805
Speaker 4:  information. Liam, Liam's all listening.

940
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,245
Speaker 6:  Sorry.

941
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:21,325
Speaker 4:  Kidding. Anyone? Anyone? Just like nothing. Like the most nothing

942
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:21,925
Speaker 4:  just happened.

943
00:56:22,215 --> 00:56:24,245
Speaker 3:  Jen's over here angling for extra credit. Extra

944
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:27,125
Speaker 6:  Credit, extra credit. I've gotta be David.

945
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,565
Speaker 4:  I've never seen anyone react less

946
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:30,445
Speaker 6:  Anything

947
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,245
Speaker 4:  Than Liam just react

948
00:56:32,245 --> 00:56:33,085
Speaker 6:  To that. Sorry,

949
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:34,845
Speaker 1:  I was scoring

950
00:56:36,265 --> 00:56:38,845
Speaker 4:  My scoring. No, that's not happening. That didn't happen.

951
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:40,285
Speaker 6:  Nope. Nope.

952
00:56:40,805 --> 00:56:43,805
Speaker 1:  I mean, to be honest with you, that is mostly how I deal with you in in day

953
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:44,365
Speaker 1:  to day. So

954
00:56:44,715 --> 00:56:45,725
Speaker 4:  Just like nothing will happen.

955
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:46,845
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's an effective strategy.

956
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:52,365
Speaker 1:  Alright. Listeners are winner of this round

957
00:56:52,665 --> 00:56:56,085
Speaker 1:  is Jen and Eli who got every answer correct.

958
00:56:56,555 --> 00:57:00,485
Speaker 1:  However, David got a little messed up there in the end. Yeah,

959
00:57:00,945 --> 00:57:04,005
Speaker 1:  he flipped ecosystem and IP protocol. You know how

960
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,405
Speaker 3:  Sometimes you say something out loud and you're like, that wasn't it. Yeah.

961
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:07,765
Speaker 3:  Like it was. Yeah.

962
00:57:08,055 --> 00:57:08,405
Speaker 1:  Sorry.

963
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:11,965
Speaker 3:  You know, as a standardized ecosystem is just like not, that's not it guys,

964
00:57:12,485 --> 00:57:15,885
Speaker 4:  I hear you. I, you know, I hear you confuse ecosystem in I in IP protocol.

965
00:57:17,285 --> 00:57:18,365
Speaker 3:  I mean, if I had an Nickel

966
00:57:18,385 --> 00:57:19,085
Speaker 4:  Man day, you're

967
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:20,285
Speaker 6:  Where?

968
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:22,085
Speaker 1:  Hang

969
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:25,205
Speaker 3:  On, let me send you that over ecosystem. It is like, it happens constantly.

970
00:57:26,665 --> 00:57:29,445
Speaker 4:  The last protocol, by the way, is ethernet. Bluetooth is just an onboarding

971
00:57:29,725 --> 00:57:30,285
Speaker 4:  protocol. Liam,

972
00:57:30,495 --> 00:57:34,405
Speaker 3:  Which I said first If you guys remember, I was the first

973
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:35,125
Speaker 3:  one to bring that up.

974
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:42,365
Speaker 1:  So I had not planned for this and I should have, but

975
00:57:42,465 --> 00:57:45,645
Speaker 1:  did we tie, we have you tie a three way tie. Wow.

976
00:57:45,745 --> 00:57:45,965
Speaker 6:  Yay.

977
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,605
Speaker 1:  So you're all winners with 39 points.

978
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:50,525
Speaker 6:  Woo-hoo.

979
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:51,445
Speaker 1:  I

980
00:57:51,445 --> 00:57:55,365
Speaker 4:  First one to get away from the desk in return with a matter device

981
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:55,765
Speaker 4:  wins.

982
00:57:57,985 --> 00:57:58,205
Speaker 1:  Go.

983
00:57:58,465 --> 00:57:59,125
Speaker 3:  Jen could do it without,

984
00:57:59,565 --> 00:58:03,405
Speaker 4:  I want That's my phone. My phone, which is technically a matter controller.

985
00:58:05,305 --> 00:58:06,445
Speaker 3:  Jen already has two. Have

986
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:07,365
Speaker 1:  A lot. Jen has two.

987
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:09,325
Speaker 6:  Wait,

988
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:10,485
Speaker 4:  Okay. You showed up with a

989
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:14,525
Speaker 6:  Smart, you know, get up. Yeah.

990
00:58:14,985 --> 00:58:15,685
Speaker 4:  All right. Jen wins.

991
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:16,685
Speaker 6:  Jen wins.

992
00:58:17,145 --> 00:58:17,845
Speaker 1:  Jen wins. Fair enough.

993
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:18,525
Speaker 6:  I thought

994
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:21,565
Speaker 4:  I was being so smart with the phone thing and she showed up with the

995
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:25,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah, Neela is like, I've subverted the system and Jens like, I have all

996
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:25,845
Speaker 3:  the device,

997
00:58:26,395 --> 00:58:27,685
Speaker 6:  Them all. I have another one.

998
00:58:29,945 --> 00:58:33,765
Speaker 1:  Jen probably has an example of all seven of the items

999
00:58:33,835 --> 00:58:36,605
Speaker 1:  from the match game on her desk right now. So,

1000
00:58:37,345 --> 00:58:37,565
Speaker 4:  Wow.

1001
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,285
Speaker 1:  There you go.

1002
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:39,085
Speaker 4:  Wow.

1003
00:58:39,675 --> 00:58:39,965
Speaker 1:  Well,

1004
00:58:40,425 --> 00:58:40,725
Speaker 3:  We never

1005
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:44,205
Speaker 1:  Had a chance. Thank you for joining us for another fun round of games.

1006
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:48,205
Speaker 1:  Jen, you are our winner this year. I'm not sure what that means

1007
00:58:48,745 --> 00:58:49,885
Speaker 1:  yet, but we'll do

1008
00:58:50,265 --> 00:58:52,405
Speaker 4:  Do something special. It means she's the new controller.

1009
00:58:53,265 --> 00:58:54,365
Speaker 3:  Jen is the entity. I

1010
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:55,165
Speaker 6:  Know. I'm the admin

1011
00:58:55,855 --> 00:58:56,725
Speaker 1:  Bcast controller.

1012
00:58:56,795 --> 00:58:57,285
Speaker 6:  What am I?

1013
00:58:57,905 --> 00:58:59,285
Speaker 4:  Jen runs the fabric now,

1014
00:58:59,385 --> 00:58:59,845
Speaker 3:  Jen. Yeah, right.

1015
00:58:59,905 --> 00:59:03,365
Speaker 6:  I'm the fabric master. I'm the fabric master. That is it There. It is done.

1016
00:59:04,665 --> 00:59:05,165
Speaker 6:  I'm until

1017
00:59:05,165 --> 00:59:05,765
Speaker 3:  The CSA

1018
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:07,045
Speaker 6:  It's

1019
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:08,045
Speaker 3:  Done. We've, it's been decided.

1020
00:59:08,785 --> 00:59:09,325
Speaker 4:  All right, we

1021
00:59:09,325 --> 00:59:11,645
Speaker 3:  Gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk with

1022
00:59:11,645 --> 00:59:15,245
Speaker 3:  Paul from Home Assistant about the future of all of this. We'll be right

1023
00:59:15,245 --> 00:59:15,405
Speaker 3:  back.

1024
01:03:56,265 --> 01:04:00,205
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. We have a guest. Paul Chuan is here. Hello. Welcome.

1025
01:04:00,345 --> 01:04:00,885
Speaker 3:  Hey, how's

1026
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:01,525
Speaker 8:  It going? Can

1027
01:04:01,525 --> 01:04:03,725
Speaker 3:  We talk about your sweater just for a second? This is really good audio,

1028
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:07,285
Speaker 3:  So I Sure. Good. But this is, this is the rare episode that I'm perfectly

1029
01:04:07,285 --> 01:04:10,365
Speaker 3:  happy talking about Visual. Thanks. Can you just describe your Christmas

1030
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:11,245
Speaker 3:  sweater just very quickly?

1031
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:14,885
Speaker 8:  Yeah, so I'm wearing the, the GitHub Christmas sweater. So it has like

1032
01:04:15,145 --> 01:04:19,085
Speaker 8:  big GitHub letters on it. It's red, black, and green. And then all the different

1033
01:04:19,215 --> 01:04:22,005
Speaker 8:  icons that you normally see when you're working on GitHub. They're like spread

1034
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:25,845
Speaker 8:  out over the sleeves and the chest and the, the shoulders. It's

1035
01:04:26,055 --> 01:04:26,405
Speaker 8:  stuff,

1036
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:29,005
Speaker 3:  It's very good. So we, we asked you

1037
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:30,205
Speaker 1:  Smart home n

1038
01:04:30,925 --> 01:04:34,725
Speaker 3:  It it really is, it's, it is truly like it is both very on brandand and

1039
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:38,405
Speaker 3:  very good. I'm very, I'm very happy to have it. So can you just describe

1040
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:43,005
Speaker 3:  what you do a little bit? We asked you to come on here because you, you work

1041
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,845
Speaker 3:  on and created Home Assistant and we're gonna talk about matter and all this

1042
01:04:45,845 --> 01:04:49,565
Speaker 3:  stuff. But you, you, you sort of purview and like job title has actually

1043
01:04:49,565 --> 01:04:52,285
Speaker 3:  changed a bit recently. Yeah. So can you just sort of describe the shape

1044
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:52,805
Speaker 3:  of that for us?

1045
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:56,845
Speaker 8:  Yeah, right. So I'm the president of the Open Home Foundation. This is a

1046
01:04:57,175 --> 01:05:01,165
Speaker 8:  relatively new foundation. We started in April. It's now the owner of the

1047
01:05:01,275 --> 01:05:05,045
Speaker 8:  Home Assistant open source project. It's the owner of the ESP Home Open

1048
01:05:05,045 --> 01:05:08,885
Speaker 8:  Source project are, and a bunch of other open source projects that are

1049
01:05:08,885 --> 01:05:12,445
Speaker 8:  kind of the other two are built upon. Our goal is to really

1050
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:16,445
Speaker 8:  build a smart home build around privacy choice and sustainability. So

1051
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:20,325
Speaker 8:  we built that. We are doing that by building technology. So in a way how

1052
01:05:20,485 --> 01:05:24,045
Speaker 8:  Mozilla builds Firefox, we are building Home Assistant ESP Home.

1053
01:05:24,785 --> 01:05:28,565
Speaker 8:  We are just by existing, we are influencing and

1054
01:05:28,685 --> 01:05:32,485
Speaker 8:  steering the iot market. I feel like, you know, Google the Apples, you see

1055
01:05:32,485 --> 01:05:36,445
Speaker 8:  that they look at us, we talk to them, we know that they know what we

1056
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:40,365
Speaker 8:  are doing and they kind of take that into consideration or like they learn

1057
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:43,645
Speaker 8:  from that. Their product managers will talk to people in our community. So

1058
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:48,755
Speaker 8:  we are maybe not the biggest smart home platform out there. We are the

1059
01:05:48,755 --> 01:05:52,435
Speaker 8:  biggest open source project in the world and also the biggest open source

1060
01:05:52,685 --> 01:05:56,435
Speaker 8:  smart home platform. But we have a lot of influence in the market that way.

1061
01:05:56,815 --> 01:06:00,715
Speaker 3:  You're definitely the biggest super nerdy smart home system. Yes. Right?

1062
01:06:00,715 --> 01:06:03,595
Speaker 3:  Like I think that's a fair Yes. That's a fair place to say, okay

1063
01:06:03,735 --> 01:06:07,475
Speaker 8:  We ac we actually tell people like they everybody, we are never

1064
01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:11,315
Speaker 8:  anyone's first smart home platform. Everybody starts with a Google and

1065
01:06:11,415 --> 01:06:15,235
Speaker 8:  Amazon or an Apple, a smart home. And then when they outgrow

1066
01:06:15,235 --> 01:06:19,075
Speaker 8:  it for whatever reasons, privacy, more integrations, they

1067
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,835
Speaker 8:  want history, they will come to Home Assistant. And then

1068
01:06:22,835 --> 01:06:25,035
Speaker 8:  there's like people like Neli that go to hoops.

1069
01:06:26,535 --> 01:06:27,515
Speaker 6:  Oh, got that one in soon.

1070
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,275
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That's rough

1071
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:33,235
Speaker 4:  By the way. Switch from hoops to HomeBridge. We can get into it

1072
01:06:34,585 --> 01:06:34,875
Speaker 3:  That,

1073
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:37,675
Speaker 8:  That'll be the next holiday special. Yeah. Yeah. Garage door openers.

1074
01:06:38,535 --> 01:06:39,395
Speaker 3:  God help us all.

1075
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:43,875
Speaker 4:  But wait, actually garage door openers are like the thing, right? There are

1076
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,835
Speaker 4:  all of, this is how I think about Home Assistant. There are all of these

1077
01:06:47,225 --> 01:06:50,355
Speaker 4:  disparate smart devices in your house.

1078
01:06:51,065 --> 01:06:54,835
Speaker 4:  Most of them cannot talk to each other. Yeah. The plan is

1079
01:06:54,895 --> 01:06:58,755
Speaker 4:  for matter to fix it on some timeline and in the

1080
01:06:58,995 --> 01:07:02,915
Speaker 4:  meantime you have products like Home Assistant and HomeBridge and everything

1081
01:07:02,915 --> 01:07:06,315
Speaker 4:  else. That is basically the fanciest middleware

1082
01:07:07,055 --> 01:07:10,915
Speaker 4:  to bridge everything into one platform and then expose control to

1083
01:07:10,915 --> 01:07:14,235
Speaker 4:  your smartphone in some way. Yeah. And that seems

1084
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:18,995
Speaker 4:  like it will never be defeated. Like it, I, in my mind, Home Assistant will

1085
01:07:18,995 --> 01:07:22,875
Speaker 4:  never be defeated even if matter shows up and works perfectly. Because every

1086
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:26,835
Speaker 4:  time I use my smart home, there's one thing that isn't gonna

1087
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:30,675
Speaker 4:  work on matter. Whether that's the garage door or whether it's the toaster

1088
01:07:30,675 --> 01:07:34,275
Speaker 4:  or whatever it is, it's easier to bridge that into a common platform and

1089
01:07:34,275 --> 01:07:38,155
Speaker 4:  then send it out than to be like, I will replace everything with

1090
01:07:38,235 --> 01:07:38,955
Speaker 4:  a matter device.

1091
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:43,075
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Well what But Matter will help Home Assistant too, right? It'll make

1092
01:07:43,295 --> 01:07:47,235
Speaker 6:  it a lot easier for Home Assistant to exist and to do these integrations.

1093
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:50,955
Speaker 6:  Correct. I mean it's not a direct competitor to any in any way. No, not at

1094
01:07:50,955 --> 01:07:53,035
Speaker 6:  all. It's helping Grow Home Assistant.

1095
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:53,835
Speaker 4:  Is it helping Jen,

1096
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:55,315
Speaker 6:  Let's just follow

1097
01:07:56,015 --> 01:07:59,795
Speaker 3:  It. Is it helping? What a good full question. At its core,

1098
01:08:00,105 --> 01:08:03,675
Speaker 8:  Like Matter is a local standard, right? It allows devices to

1099
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:06,355
Speaker 8:  talk locally to the Smart Home Hub. There is no

1100
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:11,595
Speaker 8:  previously like, or even today there's like vacuums that will just only talk

1101
01:08:11,595 --> 01:08:14,315
Speaker 8:  to the cloud. You have an app, you're standing next to the vacuum, you go

1102
01:08:14,315 --> 01:08:17,725
Speaker 8:  through the cloud back to the vacuum, your internet is down. You cannot

1103
01:08:17,975 --> 01:08:21,605
Speaker 8:  start your vacuum like a room or something because it just, the cloud is

1104
01:08:21,605 --> 01:08:25,525
Speaker 8:  necessary with Matter. Your phone will talk through Home

1105
01:08:25,525 --> 01:08:29,165
Speaker 8:  Assistant locally and Home Assistant will talk directly to vacuums. This,

1106
01:08:29,165 --> 01:08:30,525
Speaker 8:  this is coming by the way, this is not

1107
01:08:31,075 --> 01:08:31,565
Speaker 6:  Waiting

1108
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:34,165
Speaker 8:  On, on that one. I mean, and you'll, you'll hear me say this a lot. This

1109
01:08:34,165 --> 01:08:37,765
Speaker 8:  is gonna be theoretically the promise because a lot of this is not there

1110
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:41,445
Speaker 8:  yet. But yeah, we're gonna be able to talk locally to these

1111
01:08:41,445 --> 01:08:45,165
Speaker 8:  devices. So I think in general it is good because for the first

1112
01:08:45,235 --> 01:08:48,965
Speaker 8:  time in history, there's a smart home standards and this gets a little bit

1113
01:08:48,965 --> 01:08:52,685
Speaker 8:  nerdy, but it works over ip, right? So it means you have wifi,

1114
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:56,605
Speaker 8:  which we all have in our houses. We couldn already run matter. And that

1115
01:08:56,605 --> 01:09:00,325
Speaker 8:  means that out of the box without extra radios, an Android

1116
01:09:00,325 --> 01:09:03,925
Speaker 8:  phone and iPhone can walk work with Matter. And everybody has to Google Home

1117
01:09:03,925 --> 01:09:07,405
Speaker 8:  app. Everybody has the Apple Home app because they're pre-installed, which

1118
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:10,845
Speaker 8:  means that all of a sudden, If you need to make a business case, why am I

1119
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:14,685
Speaker 8:  gonna choose matter? Well, there's, I don't know how many billion smartphones

1120
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:18,285
Speaker 8:  in the world. That's all matter supported, right? So, oh, I'm going to use

1121
01:09:18,285 --> 01:09:21,885
Speaker 8:  matter, which means there's, there's gonna be a lot more devices that can

1122
01:09:21,885 --> 01:09:22,285
Speaker 8:  work locally.

1123
01:09:22,535 --> 01:09:25,605
Speaker 6:  Would you say that matter is? No. So the way that matter came in

1124
01:09:26,435 --> 01:09:30,365
Speaker 6:  guns blazing was, you know, one protocol to rule rule them all. I feel

1125
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:32,405
Speaker 6:  like you don't agree with that. I may be wrong.

1126
01:09:34,145 --> 01:09:37,685
Speaker 6:  No. Are the other protocols, do they still have a space here or is Matter

1127
01:09:37,815 --> 01:09:38,165
Speaker 6:  gonna

1128
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:41,965
Speaker 8:  Right? Well that's, I mean disclosure, I am, there's other smart home protocols

1129
01:09:41,965 --> 01:09:45,685
Speaker 8:  and I'm on the board of the Z-Wave Alliance, right? Which is one of these

1130
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:46,605
Speaker 8:  other protocols. Wait,

1131
01:09:46,605 --> 01:09:49,365
Speaker 4:  Can you tell me If you guys are working on building a giant headquarter shaped

1132
01:09:49,365 --> 01:09:53,325
Speaker 4:  like a Z this is the only thing the Z-Wave Alliance should do.

1133
01:09:55,185 --> 01:09:56,485
Speaker 8:  Not that I'm aware of. All

1134
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:57,005
Speaker 4:  Right. Well,

1135
01:09:58,665 --> 01:10:02,205
Speaker 8:  But, but for example, If you look at like, you know, a

1136
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:05,605
Speaker 8:  Z-Wave, like the Z-Wave works with

1137
01:10:06,185 --> 01:10:10,125
Speaker 8:  QR codes that you pre-set up some a device And it doesn't

1138
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:13,805
Speaker 8:  work over ip. And If you buy a house, you

1139
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:17,205
Speaker 8:  wifi is not pre-installed, right? You always bring your own wifi router,

1140
01:10:17,225 --> 01:10:21,125
Speaker 8:  but you cannot set up a meta device without a wifi router, right? So

1141
01:10:21,345 --> 01:10:25,125
Speaker 8:  if you're thinking about I want to have a smart home pre-installed with

1142
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:28,965
Speaker 8:  stuff because that's how I wanna sell it to new people that move into homes

1143
01:10:29,515 --> 01:10:33,365
Speaker 8:  that currently to date does not work with matter. Right? So just on

1144
01:10:33,365 --> 01:10:37,125
Speaker 8:  purely on that fact, we need more smart home standards to kind of make that

1145
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:40,965
Speaker 8:  bridge and have that onboarding. Now can everything be eventually

1146
01:10:41,065 --> 01:10:44,925
Speaker 8:  one day solve the matter? Yes. Will this take a long, long time

1147
01:10:45,635 --> 01:10:46,165
Speaker 8:  also? Yes.

1148
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,165
Speaker 4:  One of the things that I'm curious about with Home Assistant in particular

1149
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:54,565
Speaker 4:  is that it is the central platform, right? To me, the, the

1150
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:58,565
Speaker 4:  big mistake of the smart home for quite a long time has been the idea

1151
01:10:58,565 --> 01:11:02,285
Speaker 4:  that we need to move it out of our houses and into someone's cloud, right?

1152
01:11:02,365 --> 01:11:06,245
Speaker 4:  I mean, and so many devices I have effectively rely on on some cloud

1153
01:11:06,245 --> 01:11:09,925
Speaker 4:  service to operate even to turn on or off. And

1154
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:13,085
Speaker 4:  the idea that I should have a server in my basement that actually runs my

1155
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:17,005
Speaker 4:  home and connects to everything, it seems very powerful. It also

1156
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:20,725
Speaker 4:  seems, and I'm sure Jen has this experience all the time, when you talk to

1157
01:11:20,725 --> 01:11:22,805
Speaker 4:  anyone about that idea, they're like, that's too hard. No one will ever do

1158
01:11:22,805 --> 01:11:26,325
Speaker 4:  that. But then you're describing, well we need to like pre-build houses with

1159
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:29,565
Speaker 4:  smart homes in them with smart homes stuff in them. And you kind of end up

1160
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:32,245
Speaker 4:  right back at, well there needs to be a server in the basement, So I can

1161
01:11:32,245 --> 01:11:35,245
Speaker 4:  just sell that with the house. How do you square all of that? Because that's

1162
01:11:35,245 --> 01:11:38,085
Speaker 4:  what I, that's what I want, yeah. Is to say my house has a computer in it

1163
01:11:38,265 --> 01:11:41,805
Speaker 4:  and I can just go look at that computer and tell you if it's working or broken,

1164
01:11:42,175 --> 01:11:45,165
Speaker 4:  which is what Home Assistant provides for a lot of people. But that's not

1165
01:11:45,165 --> 01:11:46,245
Speaker 4:  where the market is at all.

1166
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:50,165
Speaker 8:  Right? And I think that's the, the problem that we're seeing in the market

1167
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:54,045
Speaker 8:  is that If you, the moment you standardize something, it's commoditized.

1168
01:11:54,045 --> 01:11:57,885
Speaker 8:  You cannot innovate. We look at, so people will

1169
01:11:57,885 --> 01:12:01,525
Speaker 8:  go through the cloud to get these fancy effects are going. I think the, the,

1170
01:12:01,585 --> 01:12:05,285
Speaker 8:  the server, like a server is just a box nowadays, right? Like you,

1171
01:12:05,705 --> 01:12:09,485
Speaker 8:  you look at your Philips U Hub, like that's a server,

1172
01:12:09,995 --> 01:12:13,045
Speaker 8:  it's a small server, but the Home Assistant server for example is not that

1173
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:16,805
Speaker 8:  much bigger. You don't need to rack, you don't need more than two watts

1174
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:20,875
Speaker 8:  to power like a Home Assistant box. So I think we have

1175
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:23,715
Speaker 8:  to like, just like how we have electricity meters, how we have

1176
01:12:24,385 --> 01:12:28,275
Speaker 8:  routers, how we have cable modems. I think having a device there

1177
01:12:28,335 --> 01:12:32,195
Speaker 8:  to run your smart home is the future. And you know, I

1178
01:12:32,195 --> 01:12:34,435
Speaker 8:  talk to other people and they say, well you're gonna have a box that runs

1179
01:12:34,435 --> 01:12:38,155
Speaker 8:  your AI agents, right? Like you don't have that in your fridge.

1180
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:41,835
Speaker 8:  You have a box that can power all the AI in all the different devices.

1181
01:12:42,175 --> 01:12:45,915
Speaker 4:  Do you think that matter makes it more likely that will end up with

1182
01:12:46,465 --> 01:12:50,195
Speaker 4:  more people having a local server? Whether it's just a RAs rate PI or not?

1183
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:54,195
Speaker 4:  Like you describe Matter as a local protocol that sort of implies

1184
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:57,795
Speaker 4:  that you're gonna have a, some thing in your house that will run everything.

1185
01:12:58,235 --> 01:13:01,875
Speaker 8:  I think so, yes. I think that there are players that are trying to push all

1186
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:05,555
Speaker 8:  the matter data to the cloud where to do all the processing. But I

1187
01:13:05,705 --> 01:13:09,315
Speaker 8:  believe that most people are also seeing like, oh, ongoing cloud costs. Like

1188
01:13:09,455 --> 01:13:13,315
Speaker 8:  the industry is starting to realize a little bit like we're doing, like you,

1189
01:13:13,415 --> 01:13:16,875
Speaker 8:  you see Google, they're pushing some stuff. Local Samsung is pushing some

1190
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:20,835
Speaker 8:  stuff local, they, they see the speed. I mean maybe

1191
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:23,875
Speaker 8:  this is more wasteful thinking from my end because this is where I want to

1192
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:26,675
Speaker 8:  be. But yeah, I hope it goes there.

1193
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:30,755
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I am really curious how you're thinking about Matter as a, as a product

1194
01:13:30,935 --> 01:13:34,315
Speaker 3:  guy right now. Because on the one hand, you, you work on Home Assistant,

1195
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:38,195
Speaker 3:  which is is for people who are like by and large willing to do a little

1196
01:13:38,195 --> 01:13:41,955
Speaker 3:  bit of work to make this stuff work. And to me's point, like you eventually

1197
01:13:41,955 --> 01:13:45,035
Speaker 3:  hit a point with the smart home stuff where you either have to do this or

1198
01:13:45,495 --> 01:13:47,835
Speaker 3:  you, you have hit the ceiling of what we couldn do in the smart home. Yeah.

1199
01:13:48,385 --> 01:13:52,315
Speaker 3:  What matters seems to promise is it like, it sort of lowers the barrier

1200
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:55,875
Speaker 3:  to entry at the very bottom of it. Like the thing Jen keeps telling me every

1201
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:58,195
Speaker 3:  time we come on the show and I get sad about Matter and she tells me it's

1202
01:13:58,195 --> 01:14:01,515
Speaker 3:  gonna be fine is like, it just makes all of this easier, right? Like it,

1203
01:14:01,535 --> 01:14:05,395
Speaker 3:  it just, it makes building a smart home from nothing work.

1204
01:14:05,395 --> 01:14:08,115
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And that's very powerful. And I think just in terms of like getting

1205
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:11,565
Speaker 3:  people into this market, that's really valuable. But for you specifically,

1206
01:14:11,995 --> 01:14:15,005
Speaker 3:  like I went through and read a bunch of the documentation and, and forum

1207
01:14:15,005 --> 01:14:18,045
Speaker 3:  posts about Matter over the last year. So, and the response is so funny 'cause

1208
01:14:18,045 --> 01:14:20,645
Speaker 3:  it's a mix of people being like, oh this sounds cool. And a bunch of people

1209
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:23,325
Speaker 3:  being like, well I don't care about any of this. This solves no problems

1210
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:27,085
Speaker 3:  that I currently have. Yeah. So I am curious like for how, how relevant does

1211
01:14:27,085 --> 01:14:29,245
Speaker 3:  matter feel to something like Home Assistant?

1212
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:33,605
Speaker 8:  So I think it is relevant and it's mainly like the IP based

1213
01:14:33,605 --> 01:14:37,525
Speaker 8:  thing. The wifi based, the matter can have cameras, none of the

1214
01:14:37,525 --> 01:14:41,285
Speaker 8:  other smart home standards can have cameras. Vacuums have never made it to

1215
01:14:41,285 --> 01:14:44,925
Speaker 8:  Z-Wave or ZigBee and they'll probably never come. Like Z-Wave is honestly

1216
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:47,965
Speaker 8:  more like a home security standard, right? They have all the sensors,

1217
01:14:48,745 --> 01:14:52,045
Speaker 8:  it, ZigBee is similar setup

1218
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:56,205
Speaker 8:  matter is actually kind of skipping some of these sensors, which is why sometimes

1219
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:58,965
Speaker 8:  in the smart home industry people are annoyed with like, oh it doesn't even

1220
01:14:58,965 --> 01:15:02,845
Speaker 8:  do energy monitoring. And like, well right now that is slowly coming, but

1221
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:06,685
Speaker 8:  in the meantime cameras are coming, right? And like vacuums have launched

1222
01:15:07,185 --> 01:15:10,885
Speaker 8:  as specification, not yet as firmware, but there's no product

1223
01:15:10,985 --> 01:15:12,485
Speaker 8:  yet. But there's,

1224
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:14,765
Speaker 4:  There's, yes, we've

1225
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:17,085
Speaker 6:  Launched something, we've been deep into this, we've

1226
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:19,045
Speaker 3:  Launched the idea of vacuums. Yeah.

1227
01:15:20,905 --> 01:15:24,645
Speaker 8:  So I think there's a lot of good stuff coming out of the Just

1228
01:15:24,785 --> 01:15:28,085
Speaker 8:  Matter can do devices differently because they have more bandwidth.

1229
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:32,365
Speaker 8:  Now I, I think, you know, when we talk about matter, there's like this, this,

1230
01:15:32,805 --> 01:15:36,765
Speaker 8:  I keep saying IP and wifi because those are the good parts of matter, right?

1231
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:40,605
Speaker 8:  There's the threat part of Matter and like we couldn do a whole

1232
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:44,365
Speaker 8:  episode about like, that is pretty bad shit show.

1233
01:15:44,685 --> 01:15:45,725
Speaker 8:  Like that's just

1234
01:15:45,955 --> 01:15:49,245
Speaker 4:  Wait Thread's a shit show. Yes. Why is Thread a shit show? Yeah.

1235
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:50,605
Speaker 3:  Give us the three minutes on that.

1236
01:15:51,105 --> 01:15:55,085
Speaker 8:  So when they started Thread, they decided that with wifi it's too

1237
01:15:55,115 --> 01:15:58,285
Speaker 8:  hard that people need to set up a network name and a password and that's

1238
01:15:58,285 --> 01:16:01,845
Speaker 8:  then print it on the router cable modem and people have to go dig into it

1239
01:16:01,905 --> 01:16:05,645
Speaker 8:  and see it. And so they decided we're not gonna let people deal with this.

1240
01:16:05,705 --> 01:16:09,405
Speaker 8:  We are gonna create automatically a thread network, configure a name and

1241
01:16:09,445 --> 01:16:12,965
Speaker 8:  a key and then we'll just send it to all the devices and you never have to

1242
01:16:12,965 --> 01:16:16,845
Speaker 8:  know the network name and the network key. Then the second part

1243
01:16:16,845 --> 01:16:20,365
Speaker 8:  is it's a standard. Everybody's gonna be able, it's a message standard. Everybody's

1244
01:16:20,365 --> 01:16:23,245
Speaker 8:  gonna create border routers. So you're gonna have like five border routers,

1245
01:16:23,265 --> 01:16:26,165
Speaker 8:  one from Apple, one from Google, one from Samsung, one from Home Assistant.

1246
01:16:26,555 --> 01:16:30,445
Speaker 8:  They all need to have this network key. The third part is now we

1247
01:16:30,445 --> 01:16:33,765
Speaker 8:  need this network key that you set up, for example, in your Google Home or

1248
01:16:33,765 --> 01:16:37,165
Speaker 8:  your Apple home to the Home Assistant hub or to the Samsung hub.

1249
01:16:37,715 --> 01:16:38,605
Speaker 8:  They forgot that part.

1250
01:16:40,425 --> 01:16:40,645
Speaker 3:  I'm

1251
01:16:40,645 --> 01:16:44,125
Speaker 6:  So glad you explained it. You explained it so well pal. 'cause it is so

1252
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:47,605
Speaker 6:  confusing. But yes, the, like, this is where we've all ended up with multiple

1253
01:16:47,605 --> 01:16:51,045
Speaker 6:  thread networks in our home. And so devices aren't connecting. And the best

1254
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:53,445
Speaker 4:  Part I do and that shows with you Jen, is you say things like we've all ended

1255
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:57,005
Speaker 4:  up with multiple thread networks and, and it's true. I think the average

1256
01:16:57,485 --> 01:17:00,245
Speaker 4:  American, when I look at these election results, they are pissed about having

1257
01:17:00,605 --> 01:17:00,765
Speaker 3:  Multiple

1258
01:17:01,585 --> 01:17:04,765
Speaker 4:  Thread networks in there. I I have multiple thread networks in I have, but

1259
01:17:04,765 --> 01:17:07,845
Speaker 4:  this is like, you see the like bits and bobs right of like, we're gonna start

1260
01:17:07,845 --> 01:17:11,685
Speaker 4:  sharing network keys in in the Euro app. Yeah. Are you just saying

1261
01:17:11,685 --> 01:17:12,845
Speaker 4:  that's not coming to anything?

1262
01:17:13,085 --> 01:17:16,645
Speaker 8:  I mean they're trying to fix it now, but they, nobody really wants to open

1263
01:17:16,705 --> 01:17:20,445
Speaker 8:  up enough. So for example, there's a new threat credential

1264
01:17:20,445 --> 01:17:23,365
Speaker 8:  sharing that like The Thread group and the CSA have kind of collaborated

1265
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:27,205
Speaker 8:  on, but it's not anything more than just sharing QR codes

1266
01:17:27,245 --> 01:17:30,885
Speaker 8:  through documentation and how we couldn get your credentials and copy

1267
01:17:30,935 --> 01:17:34,405
Speaker 8:  paste it into the next app. Like there are iOS and

1268
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:36,805
Speaker 8:  Android APIs, they just don't work

1269
01:17:37,355 --> 01:17:37,645
Speaker 3:  Like

1270
01:17:38,285 --> 01:17:41,405
Speaker 6:  I that's Well and Home Assistant is one of the few ways we couldn actually

1271
01:17:41,765 --> 01:17:45,405
Speaker 6:  manually force all of your third border routers to work together. But it

1272
01:17:45,405 --> 01:17:49,045
Speaker 6:  is a process and it's not necessarily, you know, one we would

1273
01:17:49,325 --> 01:17:50,965
Speaker 6:  recommend to all the people that voted.

1274
01:17:51,195 --> 01:17:53,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And it and it's not gonna be successful. Right.

1275
01:17:55,155 --> 01:17:58,205
Speaker 4:  Wait, So I, I guess I have a question for both of you expressed in different

1276
01:17:58,205 --> 01:18:01,085
Speaker 4:  ways and Paul we'll start with you because you represent the Z-Wave Alliance,

1277
01:18:01,145 --> 01:18:04,965
Speaker 4:  the bitter rivals to thread, I believe the

1278
01:18:04,965 --> 01:18:05,605
Speaker 3:  Evil empire.

1279
01:18:06,425 --> 01:18:09,885
Speaker 4:  I'm so mad that there's not a CS shaped building. You have a bias in favor

1280
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:13,805
Speaker 4:  of, of the Z Wave alliance. I have a bias in favor of novelty buildings,

1281
01:18:15,615 --> 01:18:19,395
Speaker 4:  but like when I think about Matter, when we work with Jen on, on

1282
01:18:19,555 --> 01:18:23,515
Speaker 4:  coverage of matter devices thread is just a long further ride, right?

1283
01:18:23,595 --> 01:18:27,005
Speaker 4:  It it's just like one, these things happen together,

1284
01:18:27,555 --> 01:18:30,845
Speaker 4:  then the big unlock happens, right? We couldn just go to the store and buy

1285
01:18:31,085 --> 01:18:34,685
Speaker 4:  anything and you get matter over a threat and you get this low power power

1286
01:18:34,705 --> 01:18:38,125
Speaker 4:  saving network that automatically heals And it can reach everyone in your

1287
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:40,925
Speaker 4:  house. And you're, you're saying that's just not happening.

1288
01:18:41,665 --> 01:18:45,605
Speaker 8:  It is only happening If you stick to an existing, like

1289
01:18:45,605 --> 01:18:49,245
Speaker 8:  a single ecosystem. So If you have everything Apple or everything Google,

1290
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:53,005
Speaker 8:  you're going to have a good time. But the truth is, is that the smart home

1291
01:18:53,005 --> 01:18:56,485
Speaker 8:  doesn't work that way, right? We have this piecemeal together of

1292
01:18:56,595 --> 01:19:00,405
Speaker 8:  equipment we have bought over the years and Couldn can't just ask somebody,

1293
01:19:00,815 --> 01:19:04,125
Speaker 8:  throw away everything, buy everything, Google. Now we couldn use this lock,

1294
01:19:04,455 --> 01:19:07,405
Speaker 3:  Right? That's the problem we're trying to solve. Paul, are you telling me

1295
01:19:07,415 --> 01:19:08,525
Speaker 3:  we've solved No problems?

1296
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:11,245
Speaker 8:  Not yet. Okay.

1297
01:19:11,425 --> 01:19:11,645
Speaker 3:  No,

1298
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:14,885
Speaker 8:  I, this is the thing. I think they, they are aware of it and they're like

1299
01:19:15,065 --> 01:19:18,885
Speaker 8:  the, the thing is they have all these companies together and they are, they

1300
01:19:18,885 --> 01:19:21,645
Speaker 8:  have all these, you know, they're businesses, right? They wanna make money,

1301
01:19:21,645 --> 01:19:25,125
Speaker 8:  they wanna protect their ecosystems, but they are also part of an alliance

1302
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:28,245
Speaker 8:  that creates an open standard about sharing these things. And so

1303
01:19:28,705 --> 01:19:32,245
Speaker 8:  trying to find that balance is hard. And we see

1304
01:19:32,565 --> 01:19:36,125
Speaker 8:  companies where their border router has bugs. They know that these bugs exist

1305
01:19:36,235 --> 01:19:40,045
Speaker 8:  with other platforms when they exist book themselves, their

1306
01:19:40,045 --> 01:19:43,405
Speaker 8:  smart home controller talks directly to the border router bypassing the normal

1307
01:19:43,415 --> 01:19:47,405
Speaker 8:  route. So people don't experience the bug in their own ecosystem. But

1308
01:19:47,505 --> 01:19:51,085
Speaker 8:  we are all experiencing these books where you step out of that ecosystem.

1309
01:19:51,425 --> 01:19:51,645
Speaker 8:  So

1310
01:19:51,645 --> 01:19:55,165
Speaker 3:  What, what is the matter protocol like to work with right now? I mean, one

1311
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,645
Speaker 3:  thing, Neil and I have spent a lot of time this year talking about activity

1312
01:19:57,705 --> 01:20:00,485
Speaker 3:  pub another of like everybody's favorite protocols that will save everything

1313
01:20:00,825 --> 01:20:04,685
Speaker 3:  and, and has shipped no products. Yeah. Right? And we keep talking to people

1314
01:20:04,745 --> 01:20:08,645
Speaker 3:  who are like, this protocol is full of good ideas. It wants to do all the

1315
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:12,445
Speaker 3:  right things And it is just fundamentally like somewhere between

1316
01:20:12,445 --> 01:20:15,725
Speaker 3:  unfinished and broken in a bunch of really important ways. And they're all

1317
01:20:15,725 --> 01:20:18,445
Speaker 3:  like, we'll get there someday. Long history sweep, whatever

1318
01:20:19,785 --> 01:20:23,485
Speaker 3:  is matter. Is matter like a good technical protocol at this point?

1319
01:20:24,585 --> 01:20:28,485
Speaker 8:  Yes, mostly. Okay. So the, the good thing

1320
01:20:28,485 --> 01:20:32,125
Speaker 8:  about Matter is that they actually took everything from ZigBee. They took

1321
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:35,165
Speaker 8:  everything they learned from HomeKit, they took everything from Google and

1322
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:38,365
Speaker 8:  Amazon and they all said, we Couldn use all our stuff, all our knowledge.

1323
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,365
Speaker 8:  We're not gonna like just let's build the best thing ever. And they built

1324
01:20:42,365 --> 01:20:46,205
Speaker 8:  something that is very good. For example, they built into it that we

1325
01:20:46,205 --> 01:20:49,605
Speaker 8:  couldn every meta device can be connected to five different smart home hubs

1326
01:20:49,605 --> 01:20:53,005
Speaker 8:  at the same time. And from the Home Assistant app, we couldn share a meta

1327
01:20:53,005 --> 01:20:56,365
Speaker 8:  device to Google Home. And now Google Home can control the device and has

1328
01:20:56,425 --> 01:21:00,405
Speaker 8:  its own encrypted secure connection. The downside of all these

1329
01:21:00,405 --> 01:21:03,845
Speaker 8:  adding the best features that they could think of is, okay,

1330
01:21:04,265 --> 01:21:07,605
Speaker 8:  now we need bigger chips in our light bulbs because we need to have five

1331
01:21:07,605 --> 01:21:11,005
Speaker 8:  encrypted connections to these five smart home hubs. And so,

1332
01:21:11,905 --> 01:21:15,685
Speaker 8:  and then like the SDK started kept growing, right? And so the, there's now

1333
01:21:15,685 --> 01:21:18,805
Speaker 8:  more memory and so these, the light bulbs are getting more expensive or

1334
01:21:19,945 --> 01:21:23,685
Speaker 8:  matter, you set it up with a QR code, but the QR codes only for the first

1335
01:21:23,685 --> 01:21:27,085
Speaker 8:  time you set up the meta device afterwards you have to go to, for example,

1336
01:21:27,085 --> 01:21:30,965
Speaker 8:  Home Assistant and share it to Apple or to Google. You cannot use that QR

1337
01:21:30,965 --> 01:21:34,405
Speaker 8:  code again. But people don't know, they just use the QR code all the time,

1338
01:21:34,405 --> 01:21:38,205
Speaker 8:  right? So that it, they just kind of security gets in the way of usability

1339
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:41,845
Speaker 8:  there. And so there's a lot of good stuff just at the pure

1340
01:21:41,845 --> 01:21:45,805
Speaker 8:  foundational level of like authentication onboarding where we

1341
01:21:45,805 --> 01:21:49,365
Speaker 8:  get to like the layer of like, oh, how good is it for energy

1342
01:21:49,365 --> 01:21:52,165
Speaker 8:  monitoring all this stuff. I think that stuff will come like that just takes

1343
01:21:52,165 --> 01:21:55,565
Speaker 8:  time for people to agree. Then of course, I mean the whole

1344
01:21:56,225 --> 01:21:59,885
Speaker 8:  the I feel like matter, like it gets a little bit overhyped. They release

1345
01:21:59,925 --> 01:22:03,365
Speaker 8:  a new specification. Everybody makes all these articles, right? Like meta

1346
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:05,645
Speaker 8:  1.4 is here, 1.3 is there,

1347
01:22:06,135 --> 01:22:07,045
Speaker 3:  Jen's right here, ice

1348
01:22:07,045 --> 01:22:07,605
Speaker 4:  Cold Follower,

1349
01:22:07,665 --> 01:22:09,285
Speaker 3:  We couldn just say it to Jen, she's right here.

1350
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:10,565
Speaker 8:  And then

1351
01:22:11,685 --> 01:22:13,445
Speaker 4:  I don't say nice things about that always though

1352
01:22:15,135 --> 01:22:18,365
Speaker 4:  she's smiling in that way. British people smile when they're pissed off.

1353
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,885
Speaker 8:  It works in Home Assistant usually by the way within two weeks. But then

1354
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:27,405
Speaker 8:  device manufacturers are like, well I'm not gonna release a meta firmer for

1355
01:22:27,405 --> 01:22:30,965
Speaker 8:  my vacuum because there's no controller supporting vacuums. And then the

1356
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:34,085
Speaker 8:  controllers are like, why am I gonna add vacuums if there's no products that

1357
01:22:34,085 --> 01:22:37,565
Speaker 8:  use vacuum? And so everybody's kind of looking at each other and kind of

1358
01:22:37,685 --> 01:22:41,165
Speaker 8:  figuring it out and at some point somebody breaks like the dam, right? And

1359
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:44,445
Speaker 8:  then like, oh, now we're having matter vacuums because that is a thing. And

1360
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:48,845
Speaker 8:  I mean, yeah. So this is there, there's, it takes a while for something

1361
01:22:48,845 --> 01:22:52,805
Speaker 8:  to be added to matter and be able available as a matter product

1362
01:22:52,805 --> 01:22:53,645
Speaker 8:  that we couldn use.

1363
01:22:54,245 --> 01:22:57,485
Speaker 4:  I feel like I'm learning a lot about the politics of the smart vacuum industry,

1364
01:22:58,115 --> 01:23:02,045
Speaker 4:  like without having learned anything. But lemme can I just ask

1365
01:23:02,045 --> 01:23:05,565
Speaker 4:  you a question? Like the dream, like what we talk about is

1366
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:08,805
Speaker 4:  you buy a bunch of stuff, you plug it into your house and then you're just

1367
01:23:08,805 --> 01:23:12,325
Speaker 4:  able to sort of control it from anywhere. Yeah. Right. My Google home, I

1368
01:23:12,325 --> 01:23:14,645
Speaker 4:  should just be able to say, turn on the lights in the kitchen and just knows

1369
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:18,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm not setting up a floor plan on five different platforms,

1370
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:21,845
Speaker 4:  which is the thing you end up doing now. Yeah. You know, I, I can, my wife

1371
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:25,685
Speaker 4:  won't use anything unless it's control center on her iPhone. No other

1372
01:23:25,685 --> 01:23:29,005
Speaker 4:  smart home platform exists except control center on the iPhone. So that is

1373
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:32,565
Speaker 4:  why I prioritized a bunch of stuff I prioritize, but I know that Home

1374
01:23:32,565 --> 01:23:36,085
Speaker 4:  Assistant has much smarter automations, right? Yeah. In, in a variety of

1375
01:23:36,085 --> 01:23:39,965
Speaker 4:  ways. I know that Google and Amazon want to throw AI at

1376
01:23:39,965 --> 01:23:43,925
Speaker 4:  a bunch of automation ish things they keep talking about. I would love to

1377
01:23:43,925 --> 01:23:47,685
Speaker 4:  use that stuff and try it out. And that's, to me, that's what matter is supposed

1378
01:23:47,685 --> 01:23:51,525
Speaker 4:  to do, right? Is just show me all the devices everywhere without a

1379
01:23:51,925 --> 01:23:55,805
Speaker 4:  ton of complicated setup. And it, what I'm getting from you is that is

1380
01:23:55,805 --> 01:23:57,525
Speaker 4:  we're not close to that. We're not,

1381
01:23:57,745 --> 01:23:57,965
Speaker 8:  Not

1382
01:23:57,965 --> 01:24:01,565
Speaker 4:  At all. You still need a central platform and all these things can talk to

1383
01:24:01,605 --> 01:24:02,445
Speaker 4:  a central platform.

1384
01:24:02,595 --> 01:24:03,525
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And that's,

1385
01:24:03,525 --> 01:24:06,685
Speaker 4:  Do you think that's going away? Is there a timeline for Matter solves that

1386
01:24:06,685 --> 01:24:08,485
Speaker 4:  and evaporates the central platform?

1387
01:24:08,845 --> 01:24:12,645
Speaker 8:  I think that it'll never go fully away because the moment something is part

1388
01:24:12,645 --> 01:24:16,405
Speaker 8:  of matter, it is a standardized, it's commoditized. You cannot innovate.

1389
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:20,405
Speaker 8:  And so there's companies that drive on innovation, they wanna push the

1390
01:24:20,405 --> 01:24:23,565
Speaker 8:  boundaries and that will never be able to be fully captured in matter. So

1391
01:24:23,865 --> 01:24:27,765
Speaker 8:  you're going to have extra systems that with their own APIs and

1392
01:24:27,765 --> 01:24:31,645
Speaker 8:  that goes into a Google, into a Home Assistant. And then how

1393
01:24:31,645 --> 01:24:34,485
Speaker 8:  do you get it from Google into Home Assistant? You cannot, anything that's

1394
01:24:34,485 --> 01:24:38,045
Speaker 8:  in Home Assistant, we couldn push to Apple, you push to Google, that is all

1395
01:24:38,045 --> 01:24:42,005
Speaker 8:  like integrated correctly. So I don't think it's going fully

1396
01:24:42,115 --> 01:24:45,885
Speaker 8:  away, it's just that more and more default things

1397
01:24:45,905 --> 01:24:49,645
Speaker 8:  in a way. So light bulbs or logs, those will all go over matter.

1398
01:24:50,105 --> 01:24:53,885
Speaker 8:  And the more complicated things like media players, like that's gonna be,

1399
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:57,405
Speaker 8:  that's a hot mess. Like control, pausing, play, that's fine. But like

1400
01:24:57,645 --> 01:25:01,605
Speaker 8:  browsing your library and setting, putting on your Christmas playlist, there's

1401
01:25:01,605 --> 01:25:04,445
Speaker 8:  no way that's gonna be a matter in the next five years or ever.

1402
01:25:04,745 --> 01:25:07,085
Speaker 3:  But do you think this is actually a thing I've, I've been wondering about

1403
01:25:07,085 --> 01:25:10,285
Speaker 3:  a lot because I, I saw something that was like when Matter comes to TVs,

1404
01:25:10,285 --> 01:25:12,205
Speaker 3:  that's when everything's again, I was like, okay, I don't even have time

1405
01:25:12,205 --> 01:25:12,485
Speaker 3:  to think about

1406
01:25:12,785 --> 01:25:14,525
Speaker 4:  We wrote that article too. I just wanna be clear. Yeah,

1407
01:25:14,545 --> 01:25:18,445
Speaker 3:  No, we probably did, but I've, I've started wondering

1408
01:25:18,445 --> 01:25:21,325
Speaker 3:  like there's a, there's a version of the thing that you just described where

1409
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:25,085
Speaker 3:  it's like matter sort of handles the very basics and then there's interesting

1410
01:25:25,085 --> 01:25:28,005
Speaker 3:  competition and innovation on top of that. Yeah. That actually strikes me

1411
01:25:28,005 --> 01:25:31,885
Speaker 3:  as a not terrible outcome. That's the's whole point really. But then there's

1412
01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:34,325
Speaker 3:  another version of it. But then the question on top of that, right? Is how

1413
01:25:34,325 --> 01:25:38,005
Speaker 3:  much do you push down into that protocol? And I, I just, I

1414
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:41,605
Speaker 3:  I wonder what that balance looks like over time. Because the question of

1415
01:25:41,605 --> 01:25:45,325
Speaker 3:  like, what is an interesting innovation that I did and what should just be

1416
01:25:45,325 --> 01:25:48,405
Speaker 3:  baked in by default to every one of these devices feels like the most

1417
01:25:49,155 --> 01:25:51,805
Speaker 3:  sliding scale, slippery slope of all time. You

1418
01:25:51,805 --> 01:25:54,725
Speaker 8:  Know, we're a member of the CSA alliance, which is the alliance that makes

1419
01:25:54,725 --> 01:25:57,845
Speaker 8:  matter. And when you go to these member meetings and you talk to people,

1420
01:25:57,955 --> 01:26:01,525
Speaker 8:  they wanna put everything in matter, right? Like, oh, manage your

1421
01:26:02,005 --> 01:26:05,365
Speaker 8:  wireless router manage like, because that connects to matter in a way. Let

1422
01:26:05,555 --> 01:26:09,045
Speaker 8:  your wireless router should be part of meta or everything that is

1423
01:26:09,275 --> 01:26:12,605
Speaker 8:  electronics in your house should be part of matter. They believe that this

1424
01:26:12,605 --> 01:26:16,245
Speaker 8:  is kind of the, the vision is we have solved onboarding,

1425
01:26:16,245 --> 01:26:19,885
Speaker 8:  commissioning of devices and sharing devices between smart home controllers.

1426
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:24,165
Speaker 8:  We can use that as a base layer of, well, smart home is the first

1427
01:26:24,165 --> 01:26:27,365
Speaker 8:  thing. Maybe wireless routers, well we couldn say we couldn consider that

1428
01:26:27,365 --> 01:26:30,725
Speaker 8:  smart home, but maybe your car will be better. Who knows?

1429
01:26:32,155 --> 01:26:35,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think who knows is the right, I mean, Jen, go ahead.

1430
01:26:36,185 --> 01:26:40,005
Speaker 6:  It is is the fundamental foundation that they were trying to

1431
01:26:40,005 --> 01:26:43,925
Speaker 6:  fix and then it does feel like it's maybe got a little ahead of itself, but,

1432
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,565
Speaker 6:  but it sounds like what you're talking about from the technical perspective

1433
01:26:47,705 --> 01:26:51,445
Speaker 6:  is that that foundation is solid. Yeah, And it works

1434
01:26:51,545 --> 01:26:55,365
Speaker 6:  And it does as it's said on the tin. It's just that when we bring

1435
01:26:55,795 --> 01:26:59,645
Speaker 6:  this, the interoperability side or the, the, the platforms,

1436
01:26:59,645 --> 01:27:03,125
Speaker 6:  the different app, the different manufacturers who all are implementing things

1437
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:05,965
Speaker 6:  in different ways and perhaps that's where we're seeing some of this

1438
01:27:06,965 --> 01:27:10,645
Speaker 6:  friction and difficult user experiences. But so

1439
01:27:10,675 --> 01:27:14,375
Speaker 6:  it's really, it is that and and Home Assistant it seems

1440
01:27:14,445 --> 01:27:17,615
Speaker 6:  from, from my perspective, watching what's changed with the company

1441
01:27:18,205 --> 01:27:22,095
Speaker 6:  over the last year or two is matter is actually helping push Home

1442
01:27:22,095 --> 01:27:25,895
Speaker 6:  Assistant to become more of a mainstream platform and not

1443
01:27:25,895 --> 01:27:29,575
Speaker 6:  just the way you connect everything that couldn't connect to HomeKit.

1444
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,735
Speaker 6:  So that in that sense matter is, is succeeding in its in its

1445
01:27:33,845 --> 01:27:37,655
Speaker 6:  goal, which is give it a simple foundation that

1446
01:27:37,655 --> 01:27:41,615
Speaker 6:  every smart home device can use and then companies can innovate

1447
01:27:41,615 --> 01:27:45,375
Speaker 6:  and build experiences on top of matter. Is that, I mean,

1448
01:27:45,585 --> 01:27:45,935
Speaker 6:  would

1449
01:27:45,935 --> 01:27:47,815
Speaker 8:  You say that's Yeah, I mean that's that would be very nice.

1450
01:27:49,485 --> 01:27:49,775
Speaker 6:  Well

1451
01:27:49,835 --> 01:27:53,775
Speaker 4:  Can I, I just have these like extremely dumb questions. Yeah. Like what

1452
01:27:53,775 --> 01:27:57,535
Speaker 4:  is a smart home? Like that's where my brain is. It feels like the

1453
01:27:57,535 --> 01:28:01,215
Speaker 4:  product that everyone's trying to build is a smart home. Yes. Not a light

1454
01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:04,415
Speaker 4:  switch. And none of this stuff has solved the problem of

1455
01:28:05,025 --> 01:28:08,935
Speaker 4:  where in the computing landscape is your home, like as

1456
01:28:09,015 --> 01:28:12,895
Speaker 4:  a product. It's just how do we shove a bunch of stuff together? Like

1457
01:28:13,075 --> 01:28:17,055
Speaker 4:  to me, the big unlock of the smart home is that when we wake up in the morning

1458
01:28:17,155 --> 01:28:20,895
Speaker 4:  and they, a little sensor in our hallway detects motion, the lights in the

1459
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:24,295
Speaker 4:  kitchen turn on and they're, I you can't buy that outta the box. Like, I

1460
01:28:24,295 --> 01:28:27,415
Speaker 4:  had to be like that. This is what I would like to have happen. I need a Phillips

1461
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:31,375
Speaker 4:  hue hub that has adaptive lighting that the, like all the way down to where

1462
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:35,175
Speaker 4:  will I program this logic of sensor is on after

1463
01:28:35,175 --> 01:28:39,135
Speaker 4:  sunrise and lights go on in this mode. And I, I had

1464
01:28:39,135 --> 01:28:42,815
Speaker 4:  to figure all that out And it feels like matter doesn't solve that. It just

1465
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:46,575
Speaker 4:  puts all the devices somewhere such that someone else can solve that and,

1466
01:28:46,575 --> 01:28:50,215
Speaker 4:  but that seems like there will be no demand for a million matter

1467
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:54,335
Speaker 4:  devices unless anyone can articulate the value of having a bunch of

1468
01:28:54,335 --> 01:28:54,895
Speaker 4:  smart devices.

1469
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:59,015
Speaker 8:  Well I think this is where Google and Apple show what they

1470
01:28:59,015 --> 01:29:02,845
Speaker 8:  want, right? They wanna be competing on who can make a smart home

1471
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:06,445
Speaker 8:  platform. They don't wanna make light bulbs. There's no margin on light bulbs,

1472
01:29:06,445 --> 01:29:08,645
Speaker 8:  right? So it's a bit like those Android TV we couldn buy,

1473
01:29:08,645 --> 01:29:11,085
Speaker 4:  But once you start putting a bunch of DRAM in the light bulbs, it feels like

1474
01:29:11,445 --> 01:29:11,565
Speaker 4:  I

1475
01:29:11,565 --> 01:29:12,605
Speaker 8:  Just can't stop thinking about the

1476
01:29:12,725 --> 01:29:15,485
Speaker 4:  Sentence you ram prices. We need more chips in the light bulbs. Like I just

1477
01:29:15,485 --> 01:29:18,765
Speaker 4:  can't, that is in my brain, you's gonna be like this eight gigs of memory

1478
01:29:18,765 --> 01:29:20,685
Speaker 4:  in the light bulb will cost $500.

1479
01:29:21,425 --> 01:29:24,725
Speaker 8:  That's why your Apple watches as powerful as the first iPhone, right? This

1480
01:29:24,725 --> 01:29:25,605
Speaker 8:  is like my light bulb

1481
01:29:26,425 --> 01:29:28,965
Speaker 4:  Anyway, sorry I interrupt. Keep going. So they're, they're competing with

1482
01:29:28,965 --> 01:29:29,205
Speaker 4:  the platform

1483
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:31,365
Speaker 8:  But they have, well they compet compete on that level. So they just want,

1484
01:29:31,595 --> 01:29:35,205
Speaker 8:  it's a bit like UB, they just want all the data and control and then they

1485
01:29:35,205 --> 01:29:39,085
Speaker 8:  can build innovative or user facing experiences. It's a bit

1486
01:29:39,085 --> 01:29:42,965
Speaker 8:  like, I don't know the vendor of my light switches here that are not smart,

1487
01:29:43,095 --> 01:29:46,925
Speaker 8:  right? Because I just use them, they work, electricity just works. I

1488
01:29:46,925 --> 01:29:50,805
Speaker 8:  don't know who made my cables all that stuff. And they just wanna commoditize

1489
01:29:51,025 --> 01:29:54,605
Speaker 8:  the light bulb. A smart light bulb should be you just plug it in, you scan

1490
01:29:54,605 --> 01:29:58,405
Speaker 8:  the QR code, now it's part of your smart home and then you are living

1491
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:01,845
Speaker 8:  in your Google world, in your Apple world and do these kind of things. But

1492
01:30:01,845 --> 01:30:04,965
Speaker 8:  of course, because homelessness is at the same level operating as Google

1493
01:30:05,105 --> 01:30:09,045
Speaker 8:  and Apple, we bring everything together. We are seeing a huge benefit from

1494
01:30:09,045 --> 01:30:11,365
Speaker 8:  this because we also get all that data now, right?

1495
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:15,325
Speaker 4:  So here's the reveal of my little story, which is the motion sensor in the

1496
01:30:15,325 --> 01:30:19,125
Speaker 4:  hallway is the motion sensor in my Eco B thermostat, which is

1497
01:30:19,795 --> 01:30:23,485
Speaker 4:  bridged right all the way into all of this stuff

1498
01:30:23,515 --> 01:30:26,245
Speaker 4:  with some, I don't even know, it's some combination of home bridge and home

1499
01:30:26,245 --> 01:30:29,765
Speaker 4:  kid. And it's just like, there's just a mess of like emergent behaviors that

1500
01:30:29,765 --> 01:30:32,765
Speaker 4:  turn on the lights in the morning and one day it's gonna wake up and kill

1501
01:30:32,765 --> 01:30:36,565
Speaker 4:  us all right? Like I don't know exactly how that computer works, but it works

1502
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:40,925
Speaker 4:  and, but it's that thing which is like there's already a motion sensor here

1503
01:30:41,225 --> 01:30:44,605
Speaker 4:  and I should be able to just get at it and use it to program other stuff.

1504
01:30:45,265 --> 01:30:48,925
Speaker 4:  And that again, like I don't think Apple and Google see that is like

1505
01:30:49,225 --> 01:30:52,045
Speaker 4:  you're buying all this stuff with all these redundant capabilities in your

1506
01:30:52,045 --> 01:30:55,365
Speaker 4:  house. Like turning on a light in the morning is like an incredible signal

1507
01:30:55,365 --> 01:30:59,125
Speaker 4:  about a bunch of other stuff that should happen, right? Yeah. Are you doing

1508
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:01,965
Speaker 4:  that in Home Assistant? Is that letting you say, okay, like as Jen is saying,

1509
01:31:02,265 --> 01:31:05,525
Speaker 4:  matter let's you bring more stuff directly into Home Assistant instead of

1510
01:31:05,525 --> 01:31:09,445
Speaker 4:  just serving as the bridge. Is that now saying, okay we can, we can

1511
01:31:09,515 --> 01:31:12,805
Speaker 4:  show people like, because we now have, now we're

1512
01:31:13,275 --> 01:31:16,045
Speaker 4:  able to compete on the platform level with Apple and Google. We're not all

1513
01:31:16,045 --> 01:31:19,445
Speaker 4:  trying to build custom light switches. We're gonna make this smart home platform

1514
01:31:19,445 --> 01:31:22,965
Speaker 4:  more powerful or capable or even more interesting.

1515
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:26,965
Speaker 8:  I mean, well that's always the thing we've been doing, right? It's like to

1516
01:31:26,965 --> 01:31:30,845
Speaker 8:  build on top, like we built getting all the devices into a single

1517
01:31:30,855 --> 01:31:34,765
Speaker 8:  place was only because we wanna build stuff on top and we added like, you

1518
01:31:34,765 --> 01:31:38,645
Speaker 8:  know, the APIs are open, anyone else is messing with it. There's third

1519
01:31:38,645 --> 01:31:42,325
Speaker 8:  party dashboards and automation engines and AI that's all plugging into Home

1520
01:31:42,325 --> 01:31:45,765
Speaker 8:  Assistant because nobody else wants to, nobody wants to solve that problem

1521
01:31:46,185 --> 01:31:50,165
Speaker 8:  of getting all that data into a single place. I think that

1522
01:31:50,315 --> 01:31:53,805
Speaker 8:  when you're talking about like your motion sensor, that is a super interesting

1523
01:31:53,825 --> 01:31:57,805
Speaker 8:  use case and bring it all together. Very impressive. But If you look

1524
01:31:57,805 --> 01:32:01,405
Speaker 8:  at like, I just push buttons until lights turn. I, I'm not trying to, right,

1525
01:32:01,405 --> 01:32:04,885
Speaker 8:  but If you, If you look at Apple, well I think they're more interested right

1526
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:08,085
Speaker 8:  now in robot arms or iPads, thingies, right? Like

1527
01:32:08,835 --> 01:32:12,365
Speaker 8:  there's of course, yeah there's this is they have different

1528
01:32:12,365 --> 01:32:16,285
Speaker 8:  priorities but also their apps are installed on a billion phones. So they

1529
01:32:16,285 --> 01:32:20,245
Speaker 8:  must have like this is the entryway into the smartphone smart home

1530
01:32:20,245 --> 01:32:24,165
Speaker 8:  world and just getting everything into a UI that we couldn

1531
01:32:24,165 --> 01:32:27,925
Speaker 8:  control it is already like the first step and they're happy if like the

1532
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:31,205
Speaker 8:  majority of the people can do that. Where in Home Assistant you get to Home

1533
01:32:31,205 --> 01:32:35,125
Speaker 8:  Assistant because you had a problem you couldn't solve, we can solve

1534
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:38,605
Speaker 8:  it for you. We give you all the knobs and tools like it's the most extensive

1535
01:32:38,605 --> 01:32:42,445
Speaker 8:  toolkit, which is also what confuses people sometimes because there's so

1536
01:32:42,445 --> 01:32:45,645
Speaker 8:  much data on your screen. But then everything is possible

1537
01:32:46,225 --> 01:32:50,165
Speaker 8:  as, as long as we couldn dream up the solution. So Nili, you're

1538
01:32:50,165 --> 01:32:53,085
Speaker 8:  able to dream this up. I think the majority of the people like our parents,

1539
01:32:53,595 --> 01:32:57,045
Speaker 8:  they're not gonna think, oh, if there's a motion sensor here, then I can

1540
01:32:57,395 --> 01:33:00,925
Speaker 8:  turn on the light there. That will not cross their mind. So there is a

1541
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:05,395
Speaker 8:  gap that we need to solve in every smart home

1542
01:33:05,675 --> 01:33:09,195
Speaker 8:  platform in a way that we can tell the user, we see that you

1543
01:33:09,535 --> 01:33:13,395
Speaker 8:  act like this every morning or we see you doing this or this is

1544
01:33:13,555 --> 01:33:15,875
Speaker 8:  an idea we couldn do and then they can apply it.

1545
01:33:16,025 --> 01:33:19,235
Speaker 6:  Well and that's, that comes from the smart home platform. But then what matter

1546
01:33:19,355 --> 01:33:23,235
Speaker 6:  I think is gonna help with is that exact problem that Neli had was finding

1547
01:33:23,435 --> 01:33:27,155
Speaker 6:  a device that was gonna trigger his lights. So because Matter

1548
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:31,075
Speaker 6:  provides device, device communication in your home,

1549
01:33:31,455 --> 01:33:35,035
Speaker 6:  we couldn now, and this has happened now I think Eve has devices like this

1550
01:33:35,035 --> 01:33:38,595
Speaker 6:  that we couldn combine, we couldn buy a device that has been bound already.

1551
01:33:38,695 --> 01:33:42,595
Speaker 6:  So when you get your light bulbs, it'll come bound with a smart

1552
01:33:42,595 --> 01:33:46,395
Speaker 6:  switch that, so then you just put them in your house and they will work.

1553
01:33:46,395 --> 01:33:49,635
Speaker 6:  You don't have to go through any kind of setup process in the app to get

1554
01:33:49,635 --> 01:33:53,355
Speaker 6:  it to turn on the lights when you want it to. But then we couldn use an app

1555
01:33:53,355 --> 01:33:56,915
Speaker 6:  or a smart home platform to add that extra layer like the adaptive lighting

1556
01:33:57,055 --> 01:34:00,155
Speaker 6:  so that it turns on the lights at the right time of day to the right time

1557
01:34:00,215 --> 01:34:03,675
Speaker 6:  of temperature. So it is, you know, you've basically got three layers. You've

1558
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:07,635
Speaker 6:  got the communication foundation layer, then you've got the devices

1559
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:11,915
Speaker 6:  and because the device manufacturer who makes that switch and that

1560
01:34:12,005 --> 01:34:14,835
Speaker 6:  light that can be bound together through binding,

1561
01:34:16,015 --> 01:34:19,835
Speaker 6:  can now work with all the platforms through matter without having to

1562
01:34:19,835 --> 01:34:23,675
Speaker 6:  have spent all of their time and resources for a small startup

1563
01:34:23,895 --> 01:34:27,475
Speaker 6:  or a open source home platform

1564
01:34:28,305 --> 01:34:31,515
Speaker 6:  working with all these big platforms like Apple Home and Google,

1565
01:34:32,145 --> 01:34:35,795
Speaker 6:  they can put their resources into developing a, into developing a better

1566
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:39,035
Speaker 6:  product and then work with these platforms on top those, that's like the

1567
01:34:39,035 --> 01:34:41,395
Speaker 6:  three layer cake really. Yeah. Of what matters.

1568
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:45,635
Speaker 8:  That is the theory binding devices together has

1569
01:34:45,755 --> 01:34:49,035
Speaker 8:  never, ever worked ZigBee Z-Wave the

1570
01:34:50,175 --> 01:34:53,995
Speaker 8:  the, the technology works, but explaining it to the user that

1571
01:34:54,385 --> 01:34:58,210
Speaker 8:  this device publishes these signals and we couldn wire them up to that signal

1572
01:34:58,425 --> 01:35:02,045
Speaker 8:  and then now the motion sensor who's turning on the light is responsible

1573
01:35:02,045 --> 01:35:04,605
Speaker 8:  for turning off the light because they turned it on, right? They have to

1574
01:35:04,605 --> 01:35:08,325
Speaker 8:  turn it off. Is that this new signal, is that built into the motion sensor

1575
01:35:08,795 --> 01:35:12,605
Speaker 8:  like in home system? Because we have all these different technologies, we

1576
01:35:12,605 --> 01:35:16,445
Speaker 8:  have that tech feature like tucked away. Nobody ever really uses it. I

1577
01:35:16,445 --> 01:35:20,365
Speaker 4:  Mean, can lemme ask a, a very, lemme put, let me just try to do a

1578
01:35:20,525 --> 01:35:23,985
Speaker 4:  metaphor here. Bluetooth was invented in, oh my god,

1579
01:35:24,345 --> 01:35:28,305
Speaker 4:  1997, right? Air AirPods took until 2016,

1580
01:35:28,595 --> 01:35:31,745
Speaker 4:  right? The ultimate Bluetooth device, the thing that everybody wanted in

1581
01:35:31,745 --> 01:35:35,395
Speaker 4:  the end in Apple had to make like a special Bluetooth

1582
01:35:36,695 --> 01:35:40,075
Speaker 4:  to do it. That's a long time. That's 20 years. Yeah. Where are we on that?

1583
01:35:40,075 --> 01:35:43,475
Speaker 4:  More than 20 years, right? Yeah, it's 20, 21 years, something like that.

1584
01:35:43,665 --> 01:35:47,555
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I am, I don't think we couldn have like an AirPods moment

1585
01:35:47,695 --> 01:35:51,315
Speaker 8:  for matter because you are always working with all these different devices.

1586
01:35:51,855 --> 01:35:55,715
Speaker 8:  So yes, maybe there will be a, maybe if Apple makes a light bulb,

1587
01:35:56,285 --> 01:35:59,955
Speaker 8:  it'll work perfectly within their system. But then people

1588
01:36:00,025 --> 01:36:03,555
Speaker 8:  need to have that everything into one ecosystem, right? Like Apple always

1589
01:36:03,575 --> 01:36:07,555
Speaker 8:  has the, the benefit of controlling the whole stack. They have

1590
01:36:07,555 --> 01:36:10,715
Speaker 8:  your MacBook, they have your iPhone and then your AirPods and they can automatically

1591
01:36:10,715 --> 01:36:14,595
Speaker 8:  switch and do all the magic in Matter world. That is just not gonna happen.

1592
01:36:14,695 --> 01:36:17,995
Speaker 8:  You might have your Google threat border router or you might have a

1593
01:36:19,055 --> 01:36:21,555
Speaker 8:  ZigBee light bulb that goes through your smart home system or something.

1594
01:36:21,555 --> 01:36:25,155
Speaker 8:  Right? And every, if everything has to work together, I think that will be

1595
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:25,315
Speaker 8:  hard.

1596
01:36:26,235 --> 01:36:30,075
Speaker 3:  I remember Jen said to me like o over a year ago that like,

1597
01:36:30,195 --> 01:36:33,235
Speaker 3:  if I could just convince you to renovate your entire house all at once, this

1598
01:36:33,235 --> 01:36:34,835
Speaker 3:  is actually a really easy problem to solve.

1599
01:36:36,735 --> 01:36:38,835
Speaker 3:  The problem is that that's not a real thing that anyone,

1600
01:36:38,855 --> 01:36:41,235
Speaker 4:  But you still won't be able to get a garage door, right? There's like the,

1601
01:36:41,255 --> 01:36:44,875
Speaker 4:  the garage door companies have no incentive to use matter. The

1602
01:36:45,135 --> 01:36:48,835
Speaker 4:  the companies I see that I have a lot of incentive to use matter are the

1603
01:36:48,915 --> 01:36:52,795
Speaker 4:  big appliance companies because they, I think they do not want

1604
01:36:52,795 --> 01:36:56,155
Speaker 4:  to suffer cloud costs for the entire life of an appliance.

1605
01:36:56,695 --> 01:37:00,675
Speaker 4:  And they, I, I think they know that a subscription fee

1606
01:37:00,695 --> 01:37:04,675
Speaker 4:  for the garbage features they offer in their apps will never fly. So

1607
01:37:04,675 --> 01:37:08,075
Speaker 4:  it matters great for them. They're like, you're stuff's on wifi, like the

1608
01:37:08,075 --> 01:37:10,395
Speaker 4:  timer on off, you get a notification, we can just do this in the standard.

1609
01:37:10,395 --> 01:37:14,035
Speaker 4:  You're good to go. Then there's the super commodity stuff like light

1610
01:37:14,045 --> 01:37:17,955
Speaker 4:  bulbs and those smart plug outlets and stuff where it's

1611
01:37:17,955 --> 01:37:21,315
Speaker 4:  very hard. Everything in the middle. Even the robot vacuum seems like

1612
01:37:22,105 --> 01:37:24,795
Speaker 4:  political drama times a thousand.

1613
01:37:24,795 --> 01:37:25,195
Speaker 8:  Oh for sure.

1614
01:37:25,455 --> 01:37:29,435
Speaker 4:  Do you see that getting any better that we'll just have a base layer of commodity

1615
01:37:29,485 --> 01:37:33,435
Speaker 4:  stuff or base level of commodity connectivity and then we're gonna layer

1616
01:37:33,435 --> 01:37:35,715
Speaker 4:  on top because that's what you really want. That's USP, that's Bluetooth,

1617
01:37:35,715 --> 01:37:39,195
Speaker 4:  right? Yeah. There's a base layer of Bluetooth and there's Apple being like

1618
01:37:39,465 --> 01:37:41,675
Speaker 4:  AirPods special Bluetooth, but it's still Bluetooth.

1619
01:37:41,945 --> 01:37:45,395
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I think that we will see more things being commoditized And

1620
01:37:46,215 --> 01:37:49,395
Speaker 8:  it is at some point, like robot vacuums, they just keep adding more features.

1621
01:37:49,395 --> 01:37:52,915
Speaker 8:  Now, right now they have AI automatically creating a gallery of the pets

1622
01:37:52,915 --> 01:37:56,645
Speaker 8:  when they photo it, when they drive past vacuuming and that will never make

1623
01:37:56,645 --> 01:37:58,565
Speaker 8:  it to matter, right? 'cause they try to get you

1624
01:37:58,905 --> 01:38:01,805
Speaker 3:  I'm okay with that. I just wanna say on the record, I'm okay with that. That

1625
01:38:01,805 --> 01:38:03,005
Speaker 3:  doesn't need to be part of the protocol.

1626
01:38:05,065 --> 01:38:08,725
Speaker 3:  The full mugshot gallery. Yeah, I'm, I'm good. We couldn leave that

1627
01:38:08,725 --> 01:38:09,245
Speaker 3:  proprietary,

1628
01:38:09,745 --> 01:38:13,645
Speaker 8:  But we we're gonna see more things commoditized. But I think there will be

1629
01:38:13,645 --> 01:38:17,605
Speaker 8:  always things, people always want to have you use their app, right?

1630
01:38:17,665 --> 01:38:21,405
Speaker 8:  The business benefit. I've talked to garage door opener manufacturers

1631
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:25,685
Speaker 8:  that are not MyQ and they're like, we would love to work with you, but

1632
01:38:25,685 --> 01:38:29,285
Speaker 8:  also we have business cases and how if it's in Home Assistant, our

1633
01:38:29,605 --> 01:38:32,285
Speaker 8:  business cases fall flat because people could just use Home Assistant and

1634
01:38:32,285 --> 01:38:36,045
Speaker 8:  use everything else and that's competing with our own business. And I'm like,

1635
01:38:36,115 --> 01:38:39,405
Speaker 8:  yeah, but this is what users want. But that's just, you know,

1636
01:38:45,485 --> 01:38:49,445
Speaker 3:  I think there's the question of like how long is

1637
01:38:49,445 --> 01:38:53,085
Speaker 3:  matter going to take I think is like maybe year, how long has it big

1638
01:38:53,225 --> 01:38:57,125
Speaker 3:  string, maybe the heat death of the universe, like I used to say. But I am

1639
01:38:57,125 --> 01:39:00,125
Speaker 3:  curious, like for you, as you're thinking about even just like the next 12

1640
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:03,645
Speaker 3:  months, it feels like you're, you're describing this really interesting race

1641
01:39:03,695 --> 01:39:07,285
Speaker 3:  where Matter is going to try to sort of contain

1642
01:39:07,435 --> 01:39:08,405
Speaker 3:  more devices

1643
01:39:13,805 --> 01:39:17,405
Speaker 3:  everything else more accessible to more people. Yeah. What does that race

1644
01:39:17,405 --> 01:39:19,485
Speaker 3:  look like over the next 12 months?

1645
01:39:20,565 --> 01:39:21,425
Speaker 8:  That's a good question.

1646
01:39:23,185 --> 01:39:26,745
Speaker 8:  I think we are, I think, you know, meta will just keep chugging along, right?

1647
01:39:26,855 --> 01:39:30,745
Speaker 8:  Like there will be like, you know, we'll celebrate the new specs. We'll see

1648
01:39:30,745 --> 01:39:34,705
Speaker 8:  like one or two new devices being capable

1649
01:39:35,015 --> 01:39:38,185
Speaker 8:  like to be implemented and then like, you know, in two, in two years, three

1650
01:39:38,185 --> 01:39:42,145
Speaker 8:  years they'll arrive. I think where matter can shine will be

1651
01:39:42,485 --> 01:39:45,505
Speaker 8:  energy management in the home. I think there's a lot of people talking about

1652
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:49,345
Speaker 8:  I want to charge my car when it's the solar power is like

1653
01:39:50,155 --> 01:39:53,865
Speaker 8:  being very, giving me cheap energy for example. I think

1654
01:39:53,865 --> 01:39:57,305
Speaker 8:  that's something where, okay, you have three, four devices that need to speak

1655
01:39:57,305 --> 01:40:01,265
Speaker 8:  matter. You have a smart home controller that isn't just for smart

1656
01:40:01,265 --> 01:40:04,705
Speaker 8:  home, but this energy specific, you just have a smart

1657
01:40:05,005 --> 01:40:08,465
Speaker 8:  matter energy controller device that is just

1658
01:40:08,655 --> 01:40:12,185
Speaker 8:  controlling your car, the charger and plugs into your solar

1659
01:40:12,245 --> 01:40:15,705
Speaker 8:  panels and just that piece can run over there. I think that

1660
01:40:16,335 --> 01:40:19,505
Speaker 8:  with Home Assistant, we have all that data. We are, like I said before, we're

1661
01:40:19,505 --> 01:40:22,145
Speaker 8:  a toolkit. We make tool, we make like the toolbox, right? Like with all the

1662
01:40:22,145 --> 01:40:25,945
Speaker 8:  tools, our dream is to make more solutions, but then you need

1663
01:40:25,945 --> 01:40:29,225
Speaker 8:  like a team. Oh, now, now we have a team of three people just looking at

1664
01:40:29,225 --> 01:40:32,425
Speaker 8:  energy. There's a, and we're doing that, we're working with like universities

1665
01:40:32,665 --> 01:40:36,425
Speaker 8:  nowadays, but that's just like years in the making to get there.

1666
01:40:37,485 --> 01:40:40,985
Speaker 8:  So for us, we're just keep chugging along, just adding all the devices as

1667
01:40:40,985 --> 01:40:43,825
Speaker 8:  they come and see kind of what grows in our ecosystem.

1668
01:40:44,165 --> 01:40:47,625
Speaker 3:  And are you, you're, you're cool with being a, a power user thing for a while?

1669
01:40:47,825 --> 01:40:51,105
Speaker 3:  I feel like there's part of me that says, like, on principle, you shouldn't

1670
01:40:51,105 --> 01:40:54,445
Speaker 3:  have to like know what Raspberry pie is to be good at the smart home,

1671
01:40:54,945 --> 01:40:56,925
Speaker 3:  but it also feels like that's just where we're gonna be for a while.

1672
01:40:56,945 --> 01:41:00,045
Speaker 8:  We, we have ready-made hubs, right? We couldn buy a Home Assistant green,

1673
01:41:00,045 --> 01:41:03,885
Speaker 8:  $99 and you have Home Assistant. But I think I'm, we always

1674
01:41:03,885 --> 01:41:07,615
Speaker 8:  wanna be power users. Now the how much of a power

1675
01:41:07,615 --> 01:41:11,575
Speaker 8:  user you have to be that will like get lower and lower. But I don't

1676
01:41:11,575 --> 01:41:15,495
Speaker 8:  wanna, like a person shouldn't like start with Home Assistant. They will

1677
01:41:15,495 --> 01:41:19,095
Speaker 8:  always, I, I see this whole journey of like, you have first five smart apps,

1678
01:41:19,095 --> 01:41:22,455
Speaker 8:  you don't even realize you have a smart home. Then you go with Google Apple,

1679
01:41:22,635 --> 01:41:25,895
Speaker 8:  you run into limitations, then you get to Home Assistant. And I think that

1680
01:41:25,895 --> 01:41:29,815
Speaker 8:  journey, it shouldn't change because people come to Home Assistant,

1681
01:41:29,815 --> 01:41:32,895
Speaker 8:  they have at least some knowledge. They have a problem they wanna solve And

1682
01:41:32,895 --> 01:41:36,095
Speaker 8:  it will help them find the right tools. And we get familiar with the system.

1683
01:41:36,365 --> 01:41:39,175
Speaker 6:  Well, I know one of the things you've said you're working on is that sort

1684
01:41:39,175 --> 01:41:43,135
Speaker 6:  of spousal approval factor too, like making the smart home easier

1685
01:41:43,235 --> 01:41:46,535
Speaker 6:  to control for the rest of the home. Like, so like Eli's point about the

1686
01:41:46,545 --> 01:41:50,055
Speaker 6:  Apple Control center, I mean, having an easy interface

1687
01:41:50,205 --> 01:41:53,815
Speaker 6:  because it's great if you've got someone that's willing to do the

1688
01:41:53,815 --> 01:41:57,655
Speaker 6:  tinkering, but then to be able to, because the smart home is not personal.

1689
01:41:57,765 --> 01:42:00,895
Speaker 6:  It's not just for one person. Most of the time there are other people, whether

1690
01:42:00,895 --> 01:42:03,655
Speaker 6:  you live with them or they're visiting who are coming into your home that

1691
01:42:03,655 --> 01:42:07,015
Speaker 6:  need to be able to interact. And that I think is a really interesting, I

1692
01:42:07,015 --> 01:42:10,775
Speaker 6:  mean, that's something that very few platforms have really successfully

1693
01:42:11,635 --> 01:42:12,055
Speaker 6:  solved.

1694
01:42:13,485 --> 01:42:13,775
Speaker 8:  It's,

1695
01:42:13,845 --> 01:42:14,815
Speaker 4:  It's zero in fact.

1696
01:42:17,285 --> 01:42:20,895
Speaker 8:  Yeah. We even thought about if we should add a survey button that users

1697
01:42:21,165 --> 01:42:24,415
Speaker 8:  that are not the admin can give feedback to their admin what they like on

1698
01:42:24,415 --> 01:42:25,055
Speaker 8:  the dashboard. That's,

1699
01:42:25,155 --> 01:42:25,695
Speaker 3:  That's good.

1700
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:31,855
Speaker 3:  That's very good. My, my survey button is just my wife yells at me. I will

1701
01:42:31,855 --> 01:42:35,575
Speaker 3:  never forget the moment that I, I rigged up one of the lights in our, our

1702
01:42:35,645 --> 01:42:39,375
Speaker 3:  newborn baby's room. And then I, I turned it off with the app

1703
01:42:39,635 --> 01:42:42,415
Speaker 3:  and then she went in and tried to turn it on and I was like, oh no, couldn,

1704
01:42:42,415 --> 01:42:45,295
Speaker 3:  can't you have to turn it on with the app? Because I turned it and she was

1705
01:42:45,295 --> 01:42:48,455
Speaker 3:  like, what in the holy hell are you talking about? And that was the end of,

1706
01:42:48,565 --> 01:42:50,415
Speaker 3:  that was the end of my smart home. I don't

1707
01:42:50,415 --> 01:42:52,895
Speaker 4:  Have the, I don't have the deep insight. I just know that you screwed up.

1708
01:42:53,365 --> 01:42:53,935
Speaker 3:  Sure I did.

1709
01:42:54,245 --> 01:42:55,615
Speaker 4:  Anna. Whatever Anna said is right.

1710
01:42:56,525 --> 01:42:59,415
Speaker 3:  It's correct and Matter will fix it in 2068.

1711
01:43:01,955 --> 01:43:02,855
Speaker 6:  You heard it here.

1712
01:43:04,235 --> 01:43:06,975
Speaker 3:  All right. Any, any you guys have any more questions before we let our, our

1713
01:43:06,975 --> 01:43:07,775
Speaker 3:  friend Pauler go?

1714
01:43:07,975 --> 01:43:11,095
Speaker 4:  I just have one, just a pickup. And maybe we use this and we done, I'm curious.

1715
01:43:11,275 --> 01:43:13,975
Speaker 4:  You see the whole ecosystem, right? There's the big companies doing all the

1716
01:43:13,975 --> 01:43:17,775
Speaker 4:  big company stuff. There's a proliferation of apparently ruthless vacuum

1717
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:21,535
Speaker 4:  manufacturers who are gonna solve this problem. Then there's this class

1718
01:43:21,635 --> 01:43:25,495
Speaker 4:  of smart home gadget companies that seems to exist

1719
01:43:25,555 --> 01:43:29,455
Speaker 4:  to make the commodity stuff. Like me Ross is just like, smart plugs have

1720
01:43:29,455 --> 01:43:32,135
Speaker 4:  however many shapes and size of a smart plug you want. Yeah. There, there's

1721
01:43:32,135 --> 01:43:36,015
Speaker 4:  a million of them. Are those sustainable businesses in

1722
01:43:36,015 --> 01:43:39,295
Speaker 4:  a world of matter? Like, does that standard enable more of those companies

1723
01:43:39,635 --> 01:43:43,415
Speaker 4:  to exist because they seem like betting on them

1724
01:43:43,475 --> 01:43:47,415
Speaker 4:  to run my home. If, I don't know if the company's gonna last and the

1725
01:43:47,415 --> 01:43:49,935
Speaker 4:  cloud server might go down and the firm updates might never be there and

1726
01:43:49,935 --> 01:43:52,965
Speaker 4:  their security problem, like, does matter solve that problem where that stuff

1727
01:43:52,965 --> 01:43:56,245
Speaker 4:  stays more stable and those companies get to exist longer? Or is it they're

1728
01:43:56,245 --> 01:43:57,525
Speaker 4:  just taking advantage of the opportunity?

1729
01:43:57,665 --> 01:44:01,005
Speaker 8:  We need a re stabilization, like I think a lot of middle level

1730
01:44:01,565 --> 01:44:04,765
Speaker 8:  companies will go away. The more luxury light bulbs like phis U have a reason

1731
01:44:04,765 --> 01:44:08,685
Speaker 8:  to exist. They have like quality lights, ecosystem at the bo at the

1732
01:44:08,685 --> 01:44:11,725
Speaker 8:  bottom of the, like the cheaper market. It's just gonna be a race to the

1733
01:44:11,725 --> 01:44:15,565
Speaker 8:  bottom, right? And then it's not about you download the firmware like from

1734
01:44:15,575 --> 01:44:18,845
Speaker 8:  Expressive provides the tips. For example, they have firmware for their light

1735
01:44:18,855 --> 01:44:22,405
Speaker 8:  bulbs. You don't need to even know about matter. You just built this.

1736
01:44:22,745 --> 01:44:25,925
Speaker 8:  And it really becomes a race on logistics. Who gets it the cheapest to be

1737
01:44:26,145 --> 01:44:29,765
Speaker 8:  in the shop when the user or consumer is buying a light bulb?

1738
01:44:30,115 --> 01:44:33,805
Speaker 8:  Will those companies exist? Well, if they use the expressive firmware as

1739
01:44:33,865 --> 01:44:37,805
Speaker 8:  is expressive will do the firmware updates actually. And Matter has

1740
01:44:37,845 --> 01:44:40,765
Speaker 8:  a way to distribute these. And like for example, home systems can install

1741
01:44:40,765 --> 01:44:44,605
Speaker 8:  matter firmware updates. And so we, that is a possibility.

1742
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:49,165
Speaker 8:  Will it work that way? Or should the one that actually

1743
01:44:49,165 --> 01:44:52,445
Speaker 8:  put the expressive tip in sign off on something, I don't know, maybe that

1744
01:44:52,445 --> 01:44:54,045
Speaker 8:  will go wrong. It will probably go wrong.

1745
01:44:55,625 --> 01:44:59,485
Speaker 8:  Is a light bulb very important to be secure as in

1746
01:44:59,915 --> 01:45:03,765
Speaker 8:  more so with matter because we're talking ip, right? Threat

1747
01:45:03,765 --> 01:45:07,525
Speaker 8:  devices could also, certain border routers allow

1748
01:45:07,525 --> 01:45:11,045
Speaker 8:  threat device to talk to the internet. Bad idea. It is possible.

1749
01:45:12,105 --> 01:45:14,685
Speaker 8:  So yeah, we need better security. So

1750
01:45:16,495 --> 01:45:17,625
Speaker 8:  yeah, it's a sit. So,

1751
01:45:18,025 --> 01:45:21,905
Speaker 6:  But you'd still be able to use, you'd still be able to use that

1752
01:45:22,135 --> 01:45:25,905
Speaker 6:  Miro if Miro went out business? Yes. And it was a matter plug, you would

1753
01:45:25,905 --> 01:45:28,425
Speaker 6:  still be able to use that mi erase plug? Oh, yes. Yes. And you would still

1754
01:45:28,425 --> 01:45:31,385
Speaker 6:  be able to use it in Home Assistant because it's a local, so you wouldn't

1755
01:45:31,535 --> 01:45:35,145
Speaker 6:  lose the functionality. But yes, the up there is still a lot of fuzziness

1756
01:45:35,145 --> 01:45:38,105
Speaker 6:  around the firmware updating and how that's gonna work. 'cause originally

1757
01:45:38,105 --> 01:45:41,985
Speaker 6:  it was intended that it would all go through matter and then that hasn't.

1758
01:45:42,325 --> 01:45:46,225
Speaker 6:  That's sort of coming in. Yeah, we, because that has to go through the platform.

1759
01:45:47,165 --> 01:45:50,905
Speaker 6:  So yes, that's still an area where it's, it's, it's murky.

1760
01:45:51,245 --> 01:45:55,185
Speaker 8:  We have the firmware updates working, but then there was a bunch of firmwares

1761
01:45:55,285 --> 01:45:58,425
Speaker 8:  on the, like it's, it's weird. It's kind of a blockchain place where the

1762
01:45:58,425 --> 01:46:00,385
Speaker 8:  store firmwares don't, that's a different story, but

1763
01:46:01,245 --> 01:46:01,465
Speaker 4:  No,

1764
01:46:03,365 --> 01:46:03,585
Speaker 6:  And

1765
01:46:03,725 --> 01:46:06,985
Speaker 8:  It was invented when blockchains were a hype. So they have a distributed

1766
01:46:07,225 --> 01:46:09,825
Speaker 8:  ledger. They don't call it blockchain. Oh my God. But that's where the firmware

1767
01:46:09,885 --> 01:46:13,225
Speaker 8:  are stored. But there are certain firmware stored there that are incorrect.

1768
01:46:13,485 --> 01:46:17,105
Speaker 8:  So we upload it to a plug and we break the plug. And then who's responsible?

1769
01:46:17,415 --> 01:46:21,185
Speaker 8:  Like we just got your firmware from the blockchain, like who put it on the

1770
01:46:21,185 --> 01:46:24,025
Speaker 8:  blockchain? That person is, that company's responsible, but they're like,

1771
01:46:24,205 --> 01:46:28,105
Speaker 8:  but I uploaded it to your light bulb. And so yeah, there's firmware updates

1772
01:46:28,165 --> 01:46:29,785
Speaker 8:  are definitely not solved yet.

1773
01:46:30,045 --> 01:46:33,465
Speaker 3:  Who put it on the blockchain is the Christmas song that needs to exist.

1774
01:46:34,405 --> 01:46:37,065
Speaker 3:  Anyway. All right. We, we should, we should let you go. We should get outta

1775
01:46:37,065 --> 01:46:39,985
Speaker 3:  here. We're ending all of this as soon as you said it's a shit show. So don't

1776
01:46:39,985 --> 01:46:40,865
Speaker 3:  even, don't even worry. It's

1777
01:46:40,865 --> 01:46:41,065
Speaker 8:  Okay. Good.

1778
01:46:41,335 --> 01:46:45,105
Speaker 3:  There's no coming, there's no improving on that. But Paul,

1779
01:46:45,115 --> 01:46:47,865
Speaker 3:  thank you so much for doing this with us. This was incredibly fun. Awesome.

1780
01:46:47,965 --> 01:46:48,585
Speaker 3:  We appreciate it.

1781
01:46:54,305 --> 01:46:57,405
Speaker 3:  All right, we got one more quick thing to do and then we're gonna get outta

1782
01:46:57,405 --> 01:47:01,325
Speaker 3:  here and go do holiday things. This is The Vergecast hotline. As always,

1783
01:47:01,545 --> 01:47:05,485
Speaker 3:  we couldn call 8 6 6 VERGE one one email vergecast at The Verge

1784
01:47:05,505 --> 01:47:08,685
Speaker 3:  dot com. We love all of your questions. We are off for the next couple of

1785
01:47:08,685 --> 01:47:12,565
Speaker 3:  weeks, but we will still be listening to every single hotline question and

1786
01:47:12,565 --> 01:47:16,525
Speaker 3:  reading every single email several times because it's just

1787
01:47:16,565 --> 01:47:20,005
Speaker 3:  a delightful way to spend my time over the holidays. Liam, who's the sponsor

1788
01:47:20,025 --> 01:47:21,205
Speaker 3:  for the hotline, this week's

1789
01:47:21,285 --> 01:47:24,925
Speaker 1:  Vergecast hotline is presented by Amazon Q, the new generative AI

1790
01:47:24,925 --> 01:47:25,685
Speaker 1:  assistant from

1791
01:47:25,885 --> 01:47:26,485
Speaker 9:  AWS.

1792
01:47:26,515 --> 01:47:29,565
Speaker 3:  Beautiful. All right. Jen, I have not prepared you for what this is, but

1793
01:47:29,565 --> 01:47:32,205
Speaker 3:  this is a thing you and I have talked about before. So I'm just gonna play

1794
01:47:32,205 --> 01:47:35,405
Speaker 3:  the question. We'll go where we go. Sound good? Okay.

1795
01:47:35,585 --> 01:47:36,765
Speaker 6:  Sounds good. All

1796
01:47:36,765 --> 01:47:36,845
Speaker 3:  Right.

1797
01:47:37,505 --> 01:47:40,805
Speaker 9:  Hey there, this is Keith from West Des Moines, Iowa.

1798
01:47:41,505 --> 01:47:45,405
Speaker 9:  I'm calling as I have been encountering a problem more and more over

1799
01:47:45,405 --> 01:47:48,925
Speaker 9:  recent years and this Thanksgiving it felt like it came to a head.

1800
01:47:50,385 --> 01:47:53,965
Speaker 9:  You know, over the years I've accumulated a number of recipes online that

1801
01:47:54,005 --> 01:47:57,965
Speaker 9:  I like, and I just threw those in a bookmark and would come back to 'em

1802
01:47:57,965 --> 01:48:01,605
Speaker 9:  down the road whenever I wanted to make that recipe. But given,

1803
01:48:01,905 --> 01:48:05,205
Speaker 9:  you know, the, the way Google handles search engine

1804
01:48:05,205 --> 01:48:09,085
Speaker 9:  optimization and referrals and all that stuff, these

1805
01:48:09,515 --> 01:48:13,485
Speaker 9:  recipes are increasingly just no longer present. I often

1806
01:48:13,665 --> 01:48:17,615
Speaker 9:  can find them on archive.org and can track down what

1807
01:48:17,615 --> 01:48:21,295
Speaker 9:  they looked like in, you know, 2012 or what have you, and can

1808
01:48:21,565 --> 01:48:24,815
Speaker 9:  recover those recipes. But it feels like those

1809
01:48:25,425 --> 01:48:28,855
Speaker 9:  weeds are getting more and more tenuous. I was wondering if there's maybe

1810
01:48:28,875 --> 01:48:32,575
Speaker 9:  an app that I could be using to collect some of these recipes together

1811
01:48:33,005 --> 01:48:36,255
Speaker 9:  with the idea being that a, I can preserve them So I don't need to worry

1812
01:48:36,255 --> 01:48:40,175
Speaker 9:  about losing them down the road. And then ideally it would be something

1813
01:48:40,175 --> 01:48:44,055
Speaker 9:  where perhaps I could put these recipes in such a format that I could

1814
01:48:44,055 --> 01:48:47,975
Speaker 9:  use some of my smart devices to help me, you know, go through

1815
01:48:47,975 --> 01:48:51,935
Speaker 9:  the actual process of cooking if I've rendered these recipes

1816
01:48:51,935 --> 01:48:55,735
Speaker 9:  in a more readable format for the devices. Anyway,

1817
01:48:56,675 --> 01:49:00,475
Speaker 9:  I hope that, you know, you may be able to give me some weeds on things that

1818
01:49:00,475 --> 01:49:03,915
Speaker 9:  might help me. So my Thanksgiving next year is a little bit more straightforward.

1819
01:49:04,205 --> 01:49:05,795
Speaker 9:  Thank you so much. Have a good day.

1820
01:49:06,875 --> 01:49:08,295
Speaker 3:  Jen, you see why I've brought you this question?

1821
01:49:08,355 --> 01:49:10,055
Speaker 6:  Yes. I feel his pain as well.

1822
01:49:11,035 --> 01:49:14,815
Speaker 3:  So I, I have a couple of of ideas to throw out and things that I've tried,

1823
01:49:14,815 --> 01:49:18,655
Speaker 3:  but I'm, I'm very curious to hear for you, especially as a person who is

1824
01:49:18,655 --> 01:49:21,255
Speaker 3:  very committed to the idea of like integrating all of this stuff into your

1825
01:49:21,255 --> 01:49:24,895
Speaker 3:  smartphone or your smart home setup, how you're making all of this work.

1826
01:49:24,965 --> 01:49:26,055
Speaker 3:  Tell us about your setup right now

1827
01:49:27,515 --> 01:49:31,135
Speaker 6:  In terms of recipes. I have been using the Samsung Food

1828
01:49:31,555 --> 01:49:35,415
Speaker 6:  app for a while that does what, what he's asking,

1829
01:49:35,465 --> 01:49:39,095
Speaker 6:  which is pulls all the data and puts it into

1830
01:49:39,435 --> 01:49:42,455
Speaker 6:  the Samsung Food app. And so it's not actually a link

1831
01:49:43,275 --> 01:49:47,245
Speaker 6:  to the recipe, although there is a link in there, but you have

1832
01:49:47,465 --> 01:49:51,125
Speaker 6:  all the data. But the problem is the link is still there

1833
01:49:51,305 --> 01:49:54,765
Speaker 6:  and he, the issue he's having is he's going to these links and they've,

1834
01:49:55,115 --> 01:49:58,925
Speaker 6:  they've gone away. So right now, the way the Samsung food apps

1835
01:49:59,215 --> 01:50:02,805
Speaker 6:  works, depending on what app, what the format of

1836
01:50:03,195 --> 01:50:07,045
Speaker 6:  your recipe was, it does actually pull the

1837
01:50:07,045 --> 01:50:10,085
Speaker 6:  ingredients. So you get all the ingredients, then it, a separate tab has

1838
01:50:10,085 --> 01:50:14,055
Speaker 6:  all the step-by-step instructions. And then we

1839
01:50:14,055 --> 01:50:18,015
Speaker 6:  couldn click and actually read the, the full recipe on in all its

1840
01:50:18,015 --> 01:50:21,375
Speaker 6:  glory. It also in theory works with things like TikTok recipes and Instagram

1841
01:50:21,375 --> 01:50:24,375
Speaker 6:  recipes, though I've never managed to get it to do that, which is a little

1842
01:50:24,375 --> 01:50:27,815
Speaker 6:  more complicated. But the Samsung food app is so, and,

1843
01:50:28,235 --> 01:50:31,295
Speaker 6:  and just to make this, because I love the smart kitchen, the, one of the

1844
01:50:31,295 --> 01:50:34,815
Speaker 6:  main reasons I use it is because I can pull it up on my smart fridge

1845
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:39,135
Speaker 6:  and then I have the big screen recipe, which is key 'cause Oh, that's

1846
01:50:39,295 --> 01:50:39,535
Speaker 3:  Actually really nice.

1847
01:50:39,535 --> 01:50:43,215
Speaker 6:  Use your phone when you're cooking and looking at recipes. It's never good.

1848
01:50:43,215 --> 01:50:46,335
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And some recipes will have this feature where we couldn like

1849
01:50:46,905 --> 01:50:50,615
Speaker 6:  force the phone to stay open so that it doesn't lock while you are using

1850
01:50:50,615 --> 01:50:51,095
Speaker 6:  it. Yeah.

1851
01:50:51,095 --> 01:50:52,455
Speaker 3:  They call it like cook mode or whatever.

1852
01:50:52,455 --> 01:50:56,215
Speaker 6:  Right. Cook mode. Yeah. That's useful. But my absolute favorite sort of

1853
01:50:56,215 --> 01:50:59,935
Speaker 6:  fail safe recipe app that I dumped all my recipes in to over the years

1854
01:51:00,315 --> 01:51:03,615
Speaker 6:  and they never go away is paprika. Mm.

1855
01:51:04,185 --> 01:51:05,375
Speaker 6:  Which I love. Its

1856
01:51:05,375 --> 01:51:06,335
Speaker 3:  Paprika has been around forever.

1857
01:51:06,715 --> 01:51:09,375
Speaker 6:  Has been around forever. Yeah. And that's a good thing, you know, like it's

1858
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:13,295
Speaker 6:  still there. Right. So my recipes are all still there. So I'm, I've

1859
01:51:13,295 --> 01:51:16,335
Speaker 6:  been trying the Samsung food thing sort of as, as an experiment and it's

1860
01:51:16,335 --> 01:51:20,295
Speaker 6:  got some interesting features, but paprika is still my, my go-to. And then

1861
01:51:20,375 --> 01:51:24,175
Speaker 6:  I will pull it up on my iPad. I haven't found a way

1862
01:51:24,515 --> 01:51:28,335
Speaker 6:  to pull it up on a smart display though, which is, you know, I,

1863
01:51:28,435 --> 01:51:31,975
Speaker 6:  I'm more and more getting, I've been testing the 21 inch Echo show and for,

1864
01:51:32,115 --> 01:51:35,935
Speaker 6:  for cooking recipes in the kitchen, it's like, oh, so much

1865
01:51:36,105 --> 01:51:37,175
Speaker 6:  space. We

1866
01:51:37,175 --> 01:51:40,415
Speaker 3:  Couldn also like slice things on top of it. Just, that's, that's what we

1867
01:51:40,415 --> 01:51:44,015
Speaker 3:  need. Honestly, I have never thought about this until right now, but a smart

1868
01:51:44,015 --> 01:51:46,935
Speaker 3:  display that is also a cutting board is a thing that should exist. And I

1869
01:51:46,935 --> 01:51:47,655
Speaker 3:  want it very badly.

1870
01:51:48,255 --> 01:51:51,775
Speaker 6:  Actually, Bosch did actually make that. Did they really? It was at c Can

1871
01:51:51,775 --> 01:51:55,455
Speaker 6:  I buy it? ES No, it was at CES like 2018

1872
01:51:55,775 --> 01:51:59,495
Speaker 6:  I wanna say. And it was, well it was like a projector that projected

1873
01:51:59,965 --> 01:52:03,775
Speaker 6:  your recipe or different things onto your countertop. Yes,

1874
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:04,935
Speaker 6:  yes. You're right. That's what we

1875
01:52:04,935 --> 01:52:08,895
Speaker 3:  Need. Yes. I want this. Okay. So I, paprika is a really good app

1876
01:52:08,895 --> 01:52:11,655
Speaker 3:  and is is one of the ones I was gonna suggest. I would just throw two other

1877
01:52:11,655 --> 01:52:15,495
Speaker 3:  ones in. There's an app called PESTLE that is also

1878
01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:19,215
Speaker 3:  very good and does very similar things. And it,

1879
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:22,975
Speaker 3:  as far as I understand, does a really good job

1880
01:52:23,195 --> 01:52:26,535
Speaker 3:  of pulling recipes out of TikTok and Instagram.

1881
01:52:27,035 --> 01:52:29,095
Speaker 3:  Ah, yeah. I'm really glad you mentioned that actually. 'cause this is one

1882
01:52:29,095 --> 01:52:33,055
Speaker 3:  of the things that I have been looking for personally. I use an app mostly

1883
01:52:33,055 --> 01:52:36,975
Speaker 3:  for recipes called Mela, MELA. It's

1884
01:52:36,975 --> 01:52:39,975
Speaker 3:  made by the same guy who makes reader the RSS reader app. It's just like

1885
01:52:39,975 --> 01:52:42,815
Speaker 3:  lovely and beautifully designed and it's very plain text and I really like

1886
01:52:42,815 --> 01:52:46,765
Speaker 3:  it. But increasingly I'm finding

1887
01:52:47,115 --> 01:52:50,925
Speaker 3:  recipes I want to try on social. You see like, oh those cinnamon

1888
01:52:50,925 --> 01:52:53,405
Speaker 3:  buns look really good. And so the question of like, can you extract something

1889
01:52:53,405 --> 01:52:56,205
Speaker 3:  out of that actually becomes really interesting. And I haven't played with

1890
01:52:56,205 --> 01:52:59,525
Speaker 3:  pestle enough to be able to say this with great certainty for myself. But

1891
01:52:59,525 --> 01:53:03,085
Speaker 3:  I hear really good things that its ability to import a recipe

1892
01:53:03,755 --> 01:53:06,325
Speaker 3:  from Instagram or TikTok is very good.

1893
01:53:06,565 --> 01:53:09,125
Speaker 6:  I don't know how that's possible though, because they're not actual recipes

1894
01:53:09,125 --> 01:53:09,565
Speaker 6:  half the time.

1895
01:53:10,365 --> 01:53:11,125
Speaker 3:  I mean, that's true. It's

1896
01:53:11,125 --> 01:53:13,405
Speaker 6:  Only just some person throwing things in a bowl and it's

1897
01:53:13,405 --> 01:53:16,445
Speaker 3:  Just like 11 pounds of butter and some spaghetti and they're like, look,

1898
01:53:16,445 --> 01:53:20,125
Speaker 3:  it's muffins. It's like that can't possibly be muffins. I like, I know

1899
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:21,885
Speaker 3:  enough to know that's not muffins,

1900
01:53:23,465 --> 01:53:27,045
Speaker 3:  but a but apparent people say it works. So that's one I would say. And the

1901
01:53:27,045 --> 01:53:31,005
Speaker 3:  other one is Crouton. Oh yes. Which another one that

1902
01:53:31,005 --> 01:53:34,725
Speaker 3:  people really like and has done some really interesting stuff over

1903
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:38,645
Speaker 3:  recent years to make itself work. And Kreton does a really

1904
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:41,885
Speaker 3:  good job of like making

1905
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:46,515
Speaker 3:  your grocery list for you. Like the, some of these apps, which I really like

1906
01:53:46,575 --> 01:53:50,315
Speaker 3:  you, we couldn like meal plan inside of them. Yeah. Are you a meal

1907
01:53:50,315 --> 01:53:50,595
Speaker 3:  planner?

1908
01:53:51,545 --> 01:53:52,395
Speaker 6:  I've tried to be.

1909
01:53:52,635 --> 01:53:53,595
Speaker 3:  I really aspire to be

1910
01:53:54,035 --> 01:53:57,555
Speaker 6:  A meal planner. No, that is an aspirational thing. Yeah. It's just that two

1911
01:53:57,555 --> 01:54:01,035
Speaker 6:  hours sit down on a Sunday evening plan for the week. It just never happens.

1912
01:54:01,705 --> 01:54:04,475
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But one thing, If you are a meal planner, one thing some of these apps

1913
01:54:04,475 --> 01:54:07,635
Speaker 3:  will do is you basically mark the recipes you're gonna make And it will actually

1914
01:54:07,635 --> 01:54:10,595
Speaker 3:  make a shopping list for you and just be like, here are all the things that

1915
01:54:10,595 --> 01:54:12,195
Speaker 3:  you need in order to make all of this food.

1916
01:54:12,735 --> 01:54:14,675
Speaker 6:  Yes. Samsung food does that for you too. Super clever. And then we couldn

1917
01:54:14,675 --> 01:54:15,955
Speaker 6:  like super clever. Send it to Instacart.

1918
01:54:16,265 --> 01:54:19,955
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's a really good idea. And If you are more organized

1919
01:54:19,955 --> 01:54:20,515
Speaker 3:  than I am,

1920
01:54:21,515 --> 01:54:24,195
Speaker 6:  I highly recommend it. Then you'll have like two teaspoons of paprika on

1921
01:54:24,195 --> 01:54:24,755
Speaker 6:  your shopping list.

1922
01:54:25,235 --> 01:54:28,395
Speaker 3:  I know there is that. And then it's like, oh, instead I'll just go to Costco

1923
01:54:28,395 --> 01:54:32,155
Speaker 3:  and buy eight pounds of it. I'll never use. And I will say this is one thing

1924
01:54:32,155 --> 01:54:36,115
Speaker 3:  where like we've talked about this sort of Samsung vision for

1925
01:54:36,355 --> 01:54:39,755
Speaker 3:  the kitchen it, and I find it really compelling for exactly that reason,

1926
01:54:39,755 --> 01:54:42,395
Speaker 3:  right? 'cause we couldn go, you should be able to go both ways or you should

1927
01:54:42,395 --> 01:54:45,995
Speaker 3:  be able to say, here's what I wanna make. Tell me what I need. Or

1928
01:54:46,675 --> 01:54:49,355
Speaker 3:  I have these eight ingredients in my fridge, what can I make with it? And

1929
01:54:49,355 --> 01:54:52,595
Speaker 3:  it feels like Samsung is the closest to being able to do Yeah. All of that

1930
01:54:53,105 --> 01:54:54,995
Speaker 3:  kind of coherently in one place.

1931
01:54:55,335 --> 01:54:58,795
Speaker 6:  One place. Well, and they, and they just actually this week announced

1932
01:54:59,975 --> 01:55:03,795
Speaker 6:  new screens in devices, which, you know, I know we don't like the

1933
01:55:03,795 --> 01:55:07,635
Speaker 6:  screens everywhere, but you know, a little screen on top of your cooktop

1934
01:55:07,635 --> 01:55:11,475
Speaker 6:  that's actually showing you your recipe as you're cooking it. Oh yeah. I

1935
01:55:11,475 --> 01:55:15,435
Speaker 6:  can see use case there. And they've also met, made a smaller screen for the

1936
01:55:15,435 --> 01:55:18,715
Speaker 6:  fridge. So If you wa If you like the idea of having your recipe on your fridge,

1937
01:55:18,735 --> 01:55:22,715
Speaker 6:  but you don't like the idea of the 25 inch screen or whatever the size is,

1938
01:55:22,865 --> 01:55:26,435
Speaker 6:  they now have the s the family hub fridge has a smaller screen. Oh.

1939
01:55:26,935 --> 01:55:28,395
Speaker 6:  So we couldn. But yeah, the screens, and

1940
01:55:28,475 --> 01:55:31,155
Speaker 3:  I thought you were saying like a fridge magnet, but it's a screen. Can you

1941
01:55:31,155 --> 01:55:32,115
Speaker 3:  just stick

1942
01:55:32,115 --> 01:55:34,955
Speaker 6:  It a pun? Well that's, I've seen people do that with iPads. Like, oh, use

1943
01:55:34,955 --> 01:55:38,915
Speaker 6:  them, them in their kitchen as recipe to do recipes

1944
01:55:38,975 --> 01:55:41,235
Speaker 6:  and put it on a magnetic mount. But because

1945
01:55:41,235 --> 01:55:43,925
Speaker 3:  Mine goes on top of the toaster, that's where my iPad goes. See

1946
01:55:44,005 --> 01:55:46,365
Speaker 6:  I know, I'm just, the dangers, the dangers of

1947
01:55:46,455 --> 01:55:47,685
Speaker 3:  IPads in the, it's a disaster of

1948
01:55:47,685 --> 01:55:48,445
Speaker 6:  Idea in the kitchen.

1949
01:55:49,475 --> 01:55:52,685
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I have ruined at least one magic keyboard just with

1950
01:55:53,205 --> 01:55:57,005
Speaker 3:  spilling and things. Oh, I'm a very aggressive whisker. It turns

1951
01:55:57,005 --> 01:55:59,765
Speaker 3:  out. And that is bad for Apple iPad

1952
01:55:59,925 --> 01:56:02,525
Speaker 6:  Keyboards. So they're like fabricy keyboards. Yeah. Ooh. Yeah.

1953
01:56:03,585 --> 01:56:06,485
Speaker 3:  But, so here's my question about Samsung food is If you didn't have any other

1954
01:56:06,485 --> 01:56:10,245
Speaker 3:  Samsung stuff, but you just wanted one of these like recipe organizers

1955
01:56:10,705 --> 01:56:14,685
Speaker 3:  to some extent, they're all samey a little bit. They have the

1956
01:56:14,685 --> 01:56:17,245
Speaker 3:  same kinds of features you're just picking on like design and platforms and

1957
01:56:17,245 --> 01:56:21,205
Speaker 3:  stuff. Like purely on its own. Is Samsung food good

1958
01:56:21,205 --> 01:56:23,165
Speaker 3:  enough that you would tell people to like give it a whirl?

1959
01:56:23,305 --> 01:56:27,165
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. 'cause it was based on Whisk, which was one of the original

1960
01:56:27,935 --> 01:56:31,765
Speaker 6:  smart recipe apps. I mean that's basically, it is whisk now. It does have

1961
01:56:31,765 --> 01:56:34,645
Speaker 6:  a lot of ads in it. That's the only downside. But rest, If you, If you use

1962
01:56:34,645 --> 01:56:36,485
Speaker 6:  recipes on the internet, you are used to ads.

1963
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:42,285
Speaker 6:  But we couldn pay to get rid of the ads. And then there's a lot of

1964
01:56:42,285 --> 01:56:45,485
Speaker 6:  recipe apps actually you do have to pay for, I think paprika, I had to pay

1965
01:56:45,485 --> 01:56:48,805
Speaker 6:  for it. I think it was very expensive, but I think it was like $7 or something.

1966
01:56:48,805 --> 01:56:51,925
Speaker 6:  Which at the time, but eight years ago was quite a lot for an app.

1967
01:56:53,425 --> 01:56:57,325
Speaker 6:  But yes, I do, I do like it. It works well. It's the

1968
01:56:57,405 --> 01:57:01,365
Speaker 6:  you, the layout to get from the main, main Samsung food

1969
01:57:01,395 --> 01:57:05,005
Speaker 6:  page to your recipes that you've saved. That's not an easy process. Hmm.

1970
01:57:05,245 --> 01:57:09,045
Speaker 6:  They're trying, there's a lot of, and a lot of recipe apps will do this,

1971
01:57:09,045 --> 01:57:12,645
Speaker 6:  I've noticed. Like trying to show you, suggest to you what you should cook

1972
01:57:13,025 --> 01:57:16,325
Speaker 6:  as opposed to I know what I'm gonna cook. I need to go find my recipe. Just

1973
01:57:16,325 --> 01:57:20,085
Speaker 6:  let me, let me add it. Get rid of all the cruft. But if you're looking for

1974
01:57:20,155 --> 01:57:24,005
Speaker 6:  inspiration ideas, we couldn add your food list to it. And we did this

1975
01:57:24,005 --> 01:57:27,725
Speaker 6:  whole thing on The Vergecast Yeah. A while back where you know, now they've

1976
01:57:27,845 --> 01:57:30,805
Speaker 6:  actually made that a lot easier to do. We couldn just scan food And it will

1977
01:57:30,805 --> 01:57:34,725
Speaker 6:  add it to your list. And so it it, we couldn sort of say, you

1978
01:57:34,725 --> 01:57:38,445
Speaker 6:  know, what should I cook tonight? Suggest from my list what food I have in

1979
01:57:38,445 --> 01:57:42,125
Speaker 6:  my house or snap a picture of the food you have And it can

1980
01:57:42,125 --> 01:57:45,965
Speaker 6:  suggest food recipes you could make with that food. I haven't found

1981
01:57:45,995 --> 01:57:49,965
Speaker 6:  that useful at all. It's a neat idea. It

1982
01:57:49,965 --> 01:57:50,285
Speaker 6:  is a neat,

1983
01:57:51,185 --> 01:57:54,405
Speaker 3:  But at some point it might be easier to just type the words into a search

1984
01:57:54,405 --> 01:57:58,005
Speaker 6:  Engine. Yeah. Yeah. The one thing I haven't tried that I really wanna try

1985
01:57:58,005 --> 01:58:01,245
Speaker 6:  is apparently if you're at a restaurant and you're eating a dish that you

1986
01:58:01,245 --> 01:58:05,005
Speaker 6:  love, we couldn snap a picture of the dish And it will create the recipe

1987
01:58:05,225 --> 01:58:08,165
Speaker 6:  for you. Oh, that's cool. Which would be very neat. Yeah. That

1988
01:58:08,165 --> 01:58:10,965
Speaker 3:  Would be for me, it would just be like, how do I make Chick-fil-A chicken

1989
01:58:11,165 --> 01:58:14,125
Speaker 3:  nuggets in my house? Yes. That's all I wanna know.

1990
01:58:15,105 --> 01:58:16,445
Speaker 6:  Air fryer. Yeah,

1991
01:58:16,475 --> 01:58:20,245
Speaker 3:  It's true. I bought one and I have used it two times and this holiday season

1992
01:58:20,305 --> 01:58:23,365
Speaker 3:  is when David becomes an air fryer genius. It's happening.

1993
01:58:23,635 --> 01:58:25,725
Speaker 6:  Okay. I'm excited for you. Thank

1994
01:58:25,725 --> 01:58:28,725
Speaker 3:  You. I appreciate that. All right. So Samsung food, paprika,

1995
01:58:29,305 --> 01:58:33,285
Speaker 3:  pestle, crouton, Mila, somewhere in there is one that will work for you.

1996
01:58:33,505 --> 01:58:37,365
Speaker 3:  Yes. It feels good. Try 'em all. Save recipes. Yeah. Like it is true that

1997
01:58:37,385 --> 01:58:40,565
Speaker 3:  all of these recipe sites are very fleeting things. Get weird.

1998
01:58:41,505 --> 01:58:43,295
Speaker 3:  Visit them, look at them, print

1999
01:58:43,295 --> 01:58:43,655
Speaker 6:  Them out.

2000
01:58:43,705 --> 01:58:47,615
Speaker 3:  Print them out. They need your clicks to exist. But

2001
01:58:47,805 --> 01:58:51,775
Speaker 3:  save the recipes because they will not be around forever. Alright Jen, thank

2002
01:58:51,775 --> 01:58:54,895
Speaker 3:  you for doing all of this. We people should know, we basically sprung this

2003
01:58:54,895 --> 01:58:57,255
Speaker 3:  entire thing on you last minute and then you won the game, which is incredibly

2004
01:58:57,255 --> 01:59:00,495
Speaker 3:  rude. But thank you for doing this whole thing with us. This is very fun.

2005
01:59:01,595 --> 01:59:04,575
Speaker 6:  It was really fun. I enjoyed it. It was a lovely way to

2006
01:59:05,125 --> 01:59:07,415
Speaker 6:  celebrate the spectacular holiday season

2007
01:59:07,835 --> 01:59:11,435
Speaker 3:  And next year better than a D. Okay. That's the goal.

2008
01:59:11,455 --> 01:59:14,075
Speaker 3:  That's the goal. We're goal, we're just matter matters. Just shows

2009
01:59:14,075 --> 01:59:15,155
Speaker 6:  Improvement. Yeah.

2010
01:59:15,435 --> 01:59:16,515
Speaker 3:  C minus next year. It's all,

2011
01:59:16,675 --> 01:59:19,395
Speaker 6:  I mean, my kids have a lot of D's, so D isn't bad in my mind.

2012
01:59:20,295 --> 01:59:20,715
Speaker 6:  Listen,

2013
01:59:20,905 --> 01:59:23,675
Speaker 3:  It's still passing. That's all you need. All right, Jen, thank you.

2014
01:59:23,875 --> 01:59:27,115
Speaker 6:  I know, I just learned that you know that that is still a passing grade.

2015
01:59:27,475 --> 01:59:28,755
Speaker 6:  I thought. I always thought it was a c.

2016
01:59:31,675 --> 01:59:33,915
Speaker 6:  I really hope my grand, their grandparents don't listen to this.

2017
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:38,195
Speaker 3:  Listen, everybody's just at her doing their best, Jen, that's all. It's the

2018
01:59:38,195 --> 01:59:40,515
Speaker 3:  holidays. All right, thank you.

2019
01:59:41,135 --> 01:59:42,195
Speaker 6:  All right. Bye-bye. Thanks.

2020
