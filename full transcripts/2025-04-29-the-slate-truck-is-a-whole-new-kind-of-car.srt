Description: Sometimes you want more tech in your life — and sometimes you want a lot less. This episode is all about less. First, Tim Stevens joins the show to talk about his story about the Slate Truck, an ultra-minimal electric vehicle that has almost no features to speak of and yet still promises to reinvent the way we think about cars. After that, Casey Johnston tells us about her journey in managing her screen time. She has tips for how to get the most problematic apps of your phone, is a big proponent of a factory reset, and has seen first-hand what happens when you look at your devices just a little less. Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about whether there's a MacBook Air equivalent in the Windows world. The answer surprised us, and it might surprise you too.




2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:07,195
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of trucks that have no

3
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:11,075
Speaker 2:  stereos and no paint and like no features of any kind.

4
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:14,915
Speaker 2:  And I still want it very, very, very badly. I'm your friend David Pierce,

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,995
Speaker 2:  and right now I'm doing some headphone testing. So I have a blue set of AirPods

6
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:22,755
Speaker 2:  Max that frankly, I just hadn't used AirPods Max in a while, so I picked

7
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:26,275
Speaker 2:  up a pair, don't tell anybody, but I have every intention of turning these

8
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:29,795
Speaker 2:  to the Apple Store, but just wanted to try 'em out for a while. And then

9
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:33,635
Speaker 2:  I got these, they're called the Picken F fives, and

10
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:37,475
Speaker 2:  they are just the most incredible blatant AirPods

11
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:40,035
Speaker 2:  Max knockoff you've ever seen in your entire life.

12
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:45,025
Speaker 2:  I am fascinated by these things. The AirPods Max are $500.

13
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:49,625
Speaker 2:  These are like $50 and I'm

14
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,585
Speaker 2:  gonna have a lot more to say about these 'cause I actually think there's

15
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:55,505
Speaker 2:  a really interesting story behind these headphones and the TikTok shop and

16
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:59,185
Speaker 2:  the way that we buy and find electronics now. But I will tell you

17
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:03,225
Speaker 2:  these sound a lot better than a 10th, as good as the AirPods Max.

18
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:07,145
Speaker 2:  More on that to come. Anyway, on this show, we're gonna do two things today.

19
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:11,265
Speaker 2:  First, we are going to talk about the Slate Truck, which launched last week.

20
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:15,465
Speaker 2:  It is one of the most interesting new vehicles we've seen in a very

21
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:18,425
Speaker 2:  long time. Tim Stevens wrote about it for us. He's gonna come on the show,

22
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:22,385
Speaker 2:  we're gonna talk about it After that. I'm gonna talk to Casey Johnston, who

23
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:26,145
Speaker 2:  writes a newsletter called She's a Beast, about how to use my phone less.

24
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:29,425
Speaker 2:  I have been on this slow journey to try and

25
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,345
Speaker 2:  downgrade my screen time a little bit, not because I think phones are inherently

26
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:37,145
Speaker 2:  bad and that looking at screens is inherently bad. But just because I find

27
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:40,985
Speaker 2:  myself like picking up my phone to look at TikTok while I walk to the

28
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,385
Speaker 2:  bathroom six feet away, and that just doesn't seem quite right. So

29
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:47,465
Speaker 2:  Casey has some really interesting ideas. We're gonna talk about all of that.

30
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:51,465
Speaker 2:  We also really fun hotline question about laptops that caused a sort of

31
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:55,025
Speaker 2:  small existential crisis among a bunch of us. Lots to get to.

32
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:59,025
Speaker 2:  This is a really fun show. This is like extremely up my

33
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:02,425
Speaker 2:  alley. All of this stuff, it's been very fun. All of that is coming up in

34
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:06,385
Speaker 2:  just a second, but I just realized I have like six pairs of

35
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:09,665
Speaker 2:  headphones connected to my phone now, and I have to walk the dog, which means

36
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:13,385
Speaker 2:  I have to go solve a bunch of Bluetooth problems in order to listen to

37
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:16,945
Speaker 2:  podcasts while I walk. I'm gonna figure that out. We'll be right back. This

38
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:18,465
Speaker 2:  is The Vergecast. I'll see you in a sec.

39
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:01,725
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Tim Stevens is here. Tim, welcome to The Vergecast.

40
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,805
Speaker 6:  Hey David, thanks for having me.

41
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:07,045
Speaker 2:  Tim, you are a freelance tech and auto writer. You and I

42
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:09,325
Speaker 2:  have been tech blogger enemies for many years.

43
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:11,325
Speaker 6:  Frenemies, I'd like to say

44
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:15,165
Speaker 2:  A frenemies is good. I'm, I'm good with frenemies. You also write a newsletter

45
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:18,925
Speaker 2:  called Around The Next Bend, but last week you

46
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,765
Speaker 2:  wrote a story for us about I I honestly

47
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:25,285
Speaker 2:  think I have been thinking about this a lot and I think I can say this without

48
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:29,005
Speaker 2:  hyperbole the most interesting car I have seen in years.

49
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:32,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I would totally agree. And I think what makes it interesting is how

50
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:36,765
Speaker 6:  bare bones, how basic It is. And, and what's also interesting is how well

51
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:40,525
Speaker 6:  it's resonating, given how little it actually has and, and does if, if that's

52
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:41,125
Speaker 6:  not saying too much.

53
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:45,085
Speaker 2:  Totally. So yeah, I wanna talk about, there's kind of the, the car, the company

54
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:47,965
Speaker 2:  and, and why everyone is into this. But let, let's just talk about the car

55
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:51,645
Speaker 2:  first. Yeah. So describe the Slate Truck to me.

56
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:56,205
Speaker 6:  So the Slate Truck is basically an attempt to kind of reboot what a

57
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:59,965
Speaker 6:  car could be. It is a very, very basic machine on, on many levels, starting

58
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:03,885
Speaker 6:  with the paint, for example, there is no paint, it's basically made of molded

59
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:07,645
Speaker 6:  plastic. All the body work is, which has a lot of benefits. If

60
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,645
Speaker 6:  it's scratches, it doesn't matter because there's no paint layer to scratch

61
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:14,445
Speaker 6:  off, so it's just gonna stay the same color. But it was designed,

62
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:18,605
Speaker 6:  interestingly, to be a great surface for receiving vinyl

63
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:20,925
Speaker 6:  wraps, which is a very common thing that people are doing these days. So

64
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:23,805
Speaker 6:  you can get it in any color you want to, you just gotta kind of DIY it. It

65
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:27,685
Speaker 6:  is an electric truck seats too. It is not like a

66
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:30,645
Speaker 6:  king cab kind of thing where you can have comfortable seating in the back.

67
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:34,645
Speaker 6:  But interestingly, if you do need seating for more people, you can buy an

68
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:38,005
Speaker 6:  upgrade kit, which basically bolts a couple of seats in the bed and turns

69
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,645
Speaker 6:  it into an SUV. You can probably catch the, the theme here is

70
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:45,245
Speaker 6:  customization. That's, that's a big thing for sure. It's fully electric rear

71
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:49,165
Speaker 6:  drive, relatively small battery between 150 and 230 miles of range.

72
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:52,405
Speaker 6:  Depending upon which configuration that you go with fairly low power.

73
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:55,685
Speaker 6:  You're not looking at, you know, a crazy sort of 60 times or anything like

74
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:58,925
Speaker 6:  that. It doesn't have a lot of towing capacity. About a thousand pounds there.

75
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:02,325
Speaker 6:  Payload, I think is about 1500 pounds, which is comparable to something like

76
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:06,325
Speaker 6:  a, a Ford Maverick. So, you know, you're looking at a kind

77
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,485
Speaker 6:  of bare bones ev but the, the really interesting things, I think is what

78
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:12,725
Speaker 6:  it doesn't have, again, doesn't have paint, doesn't not have a touchscreen,

79
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:16,645
Speaker 6:  doesn't even have a car stereo of any kind. It doesn't have power

80
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:19,805
Speaker 6:  windows. You've gotta crank the windows down in, in a very old school kind

81
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:23,525
Speaker 6:  of way. And so it, it, It is again, a very bare bones

82
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:27,325
Speaker 6:  machine, which I, I think makes it very compelling because the biggest story,

83
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:30,605
Speaker 6:  of course is that they want this thing to cost less than $20,000 after federal

84
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:34,205
Speaker 6:  incentives, which means the full price of the things probably on the order

85
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:35,845
Speaker 6:  of 25 to $2,700.

86
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,925
Speaker 2:  How much do you think the story here starts with price? Like, can you work

87
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:43,685
Speaker 2:  backwards from, we wanted to get this thing to be $19,999

88
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:45,365
Speaker 2:  and sort of tell the rest of the story?

89
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:48,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, for sure. I think that the price is definitely something that

90
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,165
Speaker 6:  they had in mind when they were beginning this company about three years

91
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:55,845
Speaker 6:  ago, and they started in the, the initial designs. And to get such a

92
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:59,805
Speaker 6:  radically low price on an ev in, you know, the current state of

93
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,525
Speaker 6:  the world, the current state of the economy requires, you know, you make

94
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:06,085
Speaker 6:  some drastic cuts like power windows for example, or touchscreens or

95
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:09,885
Speaker 6:  radios. But it also really require the team, the

96
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:14,005
Speaker 6:  designers at Slate Auto to come up with a way of not only cutting back

97
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:17,725
Speaker 6:  on features in the vehicle, but also cutting back on the production and the

98
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:20,885
Speaker 6:  development and the design costs of the things. So for example, you know,

99
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:24,405
Speaker 6:  we talking about the lack of, of paint being an advantage potentially if

100
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:26,725
Speaker 6:  you have something that gets scratched, that kinda thing. There's also a

101
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:30,165
Speaker 6:  huge advantage from a production standpoint because if you are creating

102
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:34,285
Speaker 6:  aluminum body panels or steel body panels that requires these massive

103
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:37,445
Speaker 6:  stamping machines that are like three stories tall, that cost millions of

104
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:41,365
Speaker 6:  dollars. But if you're injecting molding plastic, you can basically do that

105
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:44,405
Speaker 6:  in any kind of building. You can do that in your apartment if you want to.

106
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,765
Speaker 6:  And the fact that it's not painted means that they don't need a paint shop.

107
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:51,725
Speaker 6:  And paint shops are incredibly expensive too. So those two things right there

108
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:56,005
Speaker 6:  make this company, you know, makes them getting off the ground much

109
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:59,525
Speaker 6:  easier and it again, takes huge amounts of costs outta the design and development

110
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,845
Speaker 6:  of a vehicle like this. So when you look at a lot of the changes, a lot of

111
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:05,565
Speaker 6:  the things that are missing, they have obviously an impact in terms of the

112
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:09,485
Speaker 6:  cost of the vehicle itself, but they also have a huge impact on the ability

113
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:13,245
Speaker 6:  for the company to get to production quickly and cheaply, which again, then

114
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:15,525
Speaker 6:  just factors into keeping the cost of the vehicle low.

115
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:20,005
Speaker 2:  So does that feel disingenuous to you at all? Like, I,

116
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:23,405
Speaker 2:  I look at this thing and it's like, okay, it's, it's, it's $20,000, great.

117
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:27,325
Speaker 2:  I would like my car to have a stereo. That, that seems like a reasonable

118
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:31,205
Speaker 2:  thing to ask for in a car. Yeah, you have to, you have to pay more money

119
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:35,365
Speaker 2:  f to put your kids in the backseat, right? So I think is this,

120
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:39,605
Speaker 2:  is this sort of a, a bit that this company is doing to be able to say

121
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,565
Speaker 2:  we're selling a truck under $20,000, which I think for a lot of reasons we

122
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:45,005
Speaker 2:  should talk about, is a meaningful thing to be able to say. Yeah, for

123
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:45,165
Speaker 6:  Sure.

124
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:49,245
Speaker 2:  Or is this a real sort of honest to god, just different and

125
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,645
Speaker 2:  interesting approach to how you even think about making a car?

126
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:54,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah, you, you can definitely take a look at this from the cynical or the

127
00:08:54,645 --> 00:08:57,085
Speaker 6:  optimistic approach from the cynical approach. You know, this is the low

128
00:08:57,085 --> 00:09:00,925
Speaker 6:  cost airline approach of EVs or even yes, if you want a sandwich, yes, then

129
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:02,405
Speaker 6:  you gotta pay extra for that kind of seats. It's

130
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:03,605
Speaker 2:  10 for a tray table, is

131
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:05,765
Speaker 6:  It? Right? If you wanna be able to put both of your feet on the seat in front

132
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:08,405
Speaker 6:  of you, you gotta pay extra for that kind thing. You can definitely look

133
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,605
Speaker 6:  at it in that way. And I think that there is some truth to that as well.

134
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:13,605
Speaker 6:  But, but you know, and the Tom and I spent speaking with the executives and

135
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:17,085
Speaker 6:  the designers and everything else, they do genuinely feel kind of emotionally

136
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:21,045
Speaker 6:  attached to this idea of, of rebooting motoring and, and creating something

137
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:25,005
Speaker 6:  that is attainable by everybody. So I I I think you can come

138
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:28,525
Speaker 6:  at it from two different ways, but I, I think the, what I, I like the idea

139
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:32,365
Speaker 6:  here is that you've got one truck in one spec. This

140
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,685
Speaker 6:  isn't an upsell kind of thing. You can get a story if you want to, they'll

141
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:38,605
Speaker 6:  sell you an upgrade kit for that. They'll sell you upgrade kits for all sorts

142
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:42,325
Speaker 6:  of things on the thing if you want to. But unlike a lot of EV startups like

143
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:45,845
Speaker 6:  El Lucid or even Tesla in the early days where you had to buy their new EV

144
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:49,285
Speaker 6:  in like this super souped up package with all the options and it cost twice

145
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:52,805
Speaker 6:  as much as it was supposed to. This is just gonna be a bare bones thing to

146
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,285
Speaker 6:  begin with. And then you just add on the things that you want to. And I think

147
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,365
Speaker 6:  the other interesting thing is that a lot of this is really, I don't wanna

148
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,205
Speaker 6:  say open source, but it's gonna be pretty easy for a lot of people to do

149
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,765
Speaker 6:  this on their own. You'll be able to 3D print components if you wanna put

150
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:06,045
Speaker 6:  that in there, you can mount your own Bluetooth speaker if you don't wanna

151
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:08,885
Speaker 6:  use theirs. It's not the kind of thing where you're gonna be forced down

152
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:12,565
Speaker 6:  an upgrade path with huge high premiums on, on, on there. You can kind of

153
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:15,645
Speaker 6:  do this stuff as you want to and you can do it as you can afford to as well.

154
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:18,125
Speaker 6:  So if you can only afford the truck up front, but you want to add that serious

155
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,965
Speaker 6:  system down the road 12 months later after you save up some money, you can

156
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:22,205
Speaker 6:  do that. And, and I like that approach.

157
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,165
Speaker 2:  Why do you think it's a pickup truck? I think a lot of this sort of sensibility

158
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:30,325
Speaker 2:  you described strikes me as making a lot more sense if you

159
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:34,285
Speaker 2:  were making something that looked like a Nissan Leaf or like a, or

160
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:37,005
Speaker 2:  like a really cool scooter, right? Sure. Like we've seen all these things

161
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:40,605
Speaker 2:  where people are basically like, what if I just built a thing with two wheels

162
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:44,205
Speaker 2:  and some wild ideas around it? And maybe that's the future. Like so much

163
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:47,645
Speaker 2:  of what you're talking about feels like it suits that better than like what

164
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,725
Speaker 2:  people have in their mind when they think of pickup truck.

165
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's a good question, David. I think for one thing It is cheaper.

166
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:55,125
Speaker 6:  You know, you've only got half the interior to worry about. That saves some

167
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,605
Speaker 6:  money there too, I think from a pure, you know, if you go to that concept

168
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:02,565
Speaker 6:  again of something that is, that you can wear into part of the idea

169
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:06,005
Speaker 6:  here is something that evolves with you and then it gets better with age.

170
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,765
Speaker 6:  You know, I, I looked into one of their design boards at one point and had

171
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:12,925
Speaker 6:  this picture of a shark on there that was covered in scars and the shark

172
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:16,525
Speaker 6:  was old and beat up, but it looked cool as hell and that was part of what

173
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,965
Speaker 6:  they wanted the aesthetic of this vehicle to be. That it, it gets better

174
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:22,325
Speaker 6:  looking with time like an old pair of blue jeans, like a leather wallet,

175
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:25,965
Speaker 6:  that kind of thing. And I think that that concept works

176
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:29,605
Speaker 6:  better with a truck than, than with a car, simply because we're used to trucks

177
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,725
Speaker 6:  being at job sites, you know, hauling mulch and lumber and that kind of thing.

178
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:36,365
Speaker 6:  But whether, again, that could be an optimistic or pessimistic thing. Did,

179
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:38,965
Speaker 6:  did that concept come about because they decided to have a truck and they

180
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,005
Speaker 6:  wanted to come up with a good way to spin it? Or is that really part of the

181
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:45,205
Speaker 6:  concept of, of the vehicle to begin with? And that you could go either way.

182
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,565
Speaker 6:  But the other thing is, I think that this functionally makes a lot of sense

183
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:51,685
Speaker 6:  for a lot of people. The idea of, I think a lot of people would love to have

184
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:54,190
Speaker 6:  a small truck that they can go get some, some mulch, they can go get some

185
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,525
Speaker 6:  lumber or they can even put their muddy dog in the back if they want to without

186
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,285
Speaker 6:  getting it all over the interior. And I think that that makes sense too.

187
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:03,485
Speaker 6:  But also the idea that you can then convert it into an SUV, which is the

188
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:07,205
Speaker 6:  most popular category of vehicles right now without too much effort means

189
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:10,005
Speaker 6:  that this could have enough flexibility to work even if you don't want a

190
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:13,765
Speaker 6:  truck. But, but I'm curious to see what uptick is and how many people actually

191
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:15,125
Speaker 6:  decide to get the SUV kit for.

192
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:19,085
Speaker 2:  Okay. How much are you a truck guy in general? I know you, you wrote in the

193
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:22,965
Speaker 2:  story that you, like many people find ridiculous how

194
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:27,085
Speaker 2:  enormous and tall trucks have become. Yeah. But are you like on the

195
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:31,005
Speaker 2:  slide just driving around in your F1 yelling at people

196
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,165
Speaker 2:  out the window? Like are you, you're not a truck guy Generally,

197
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:36,445
Speaker 6:  I've owned trucks. I've spent years living wi with trucks. I think trucks

198
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:40,245
Speaker 6:  are great. I would love to actually have a truck, but I have too many vehicles

199
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:43,045
Speaker 6:  as It is right now, and a truck doesn't quite fit in there. But I think one

200
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:45,205
Speaker 6:  of the main things that stopped me from getting a truck is that there aren't

201
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:48,925
Speaker 6:  many small cheap options like this anymore.

202
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:52,645
Speaker 6:  You know, it used to be that you could go buy a really basic Toyota T 100

203
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:56,765
Speaker 6:  or a Nissan Frontier for, you know, under $20,000 and

204
00:12:56,765 --> 00:13:00,165
Speaker 6:  have a basic truck that sat to people had a manual transmission and crank

205
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:04,005
Speaker 6:  windows. And I can't tell you the number of people who have been asking

206
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:07,485
Speaker 6:  me when is Ford gonna bring back something like the old ranger

207
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,485
Speaker 6:  in the nineties, which a lot of people loved, which was very much that kind

208
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:13,165
Speaker 6:  of truck. But it was still cool because it had like flare sides and cool

209
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:17,245
Speaker 6:  graphics and stuff like that. And so what I, I would love to have would

210
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:20,925
Speaker 6:  be something like a K truck, which is the small Japanese trucks that, that

211
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,725
Speaker 6:  a lot of folks are importing, which are unfortunately basically not legal

212
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,485
Speaker 6:  here in New York state right now, which is preventing me from getting one,

213
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:30,685
Speaker 6:  something super basic that I could beat the hell out of, that I could take

214
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,685
Speaker 6:  to Home Depot and, and put a bunch of pavers in the back and not care if

215
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:36,805
Speaker 6:  it scratches up the paint. If I could buy something like that for cheap,

216
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:39,925
Speaker 6:  I, I probably would have one. So that's why I'm personally excited about

217
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:42,805
Speaker 6:  a slate. But yeah, I, I spent a lot of time in trucks. I've done a lot of

218
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,445
Speaker 6:  towing and hauling and, and that kind of thing, and so I respect them, but

219
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,645
Speaker 6:  I think the big problem right now with the consumer truck industry in the

220
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:51,605
Speaker 6:  United States is that these trucks are just gotten simply too big. If you

221
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:55,285
Speaker 6:  look at something like a Silverado 2,500, a Ram 3,500,

222
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,205
Speaker 6:  you could literally put a sixth grader standing in front of that truck and

223
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:02,165
Speaker 6:  the person in the driver's seat could not see that child just because

224
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:06,045
Speaker 6:  of the height of the hood. These things are unnecessarily large and

225
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,725
Speaker 6:  they're hugely expensive with the average price of $60,000 in the us

226
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:14,045
Speaker 6:  and that I think is too much. And so I hope that slate is a huge success

227
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:16,925
Speaker 6:  and that makes these other truck companies think, well, maybe it's time for

228
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:19,685
Speaker 6:  us to deliver something small and cheap as well. So the

229
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:23,365
Speaker 2:  Analogy that that makes me think of, and you are a, a perfect

230
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:25,365
Speaker 2:  person to litigate this analogy with me,

231
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:30,445
Speaker 2:  is the people who want small smartphones. Yep. And I think we, we've been

232
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:34,405
Speaker 2:  on this inexorable march to bigger, more expensive

233
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:37,965
Speaker 2:  smartphones Yeah. For a decade. And there has always been this group of people

234
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:41,925
Speaker 2:  who is like, no, I want the iPhone four, I want something that

235
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:45,565
Speaker 2:  fits in my hand. Yeah. These things are preposterous and yet

236
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,785
Speaker 2:  I, every bit of available evidence suggests that what people actually want

237
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:53,285
Speaker 2:  when they vote with their dollars is the big smartphones. And, and I, I have

238
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:56,085
Speaker 2:  to assume that the same is true in the trucking industry, which is why they

239
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:59,885
Speaker 2:  keep making bigger, taller trucks. So is is slate like the,

240
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:03,765
Speaker 2:  the iPhone SE and that It is like sort of adorable but not

241
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:07,365
Speaker 2:  real for most people? Or is is there something different going on here? Yeah,

242
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:11,085
Speaker 6:  It's a great analogy. Obviously consumer demand is what has pushed the truck

243
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:15,405
Speaker 6:  industry to where It is today. It's not like, you know, Ram and Chevy and

244
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:18,845
Speaker 6:  Ford are forcing these giant trucks down the throats of anybody. People aspire

245
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:22,325
Speaker 6:  to own a bigger, better, faster, more powerful truck, and so people go out

246
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:25,205
Speaker 6:  and buy them. I think that's happening on the smartphone world as well. But

247
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:28,885
Speaker 6:  I I I am sure you as well know, a lot of folks are still hanging onto their

248
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:31,685
Speaker 6:  older iPhones because they don't want something that's too big. And I think

249
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:35,365
Speaker 6:  the problem in the smartphone industry is that, you know, nobody else can

250
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:39,045
Speaker 6:  release an iPhone, only a can. So if Apple decides that big phones are,

251
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:42,005
Speaker 6:  what's it, and they're not gonna make smart phones anymore, nobody else can

252
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:44,205
Speaker 6:  do that. On the Android side, obviously it's different, but a lot of folks

253
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:47,725
Speaker 6:  are very tied into the Apple ecosystem and they're not gonna go anywhere

254
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:51,005
Speaker 6:  on the auto side, it's a very different story. There are really, there are

255
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:54,765
Speaker 6:  ecosystems as such, but they're not nearly as powerful as, as you know, as

256
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:58,005
Speaker 6:  Apple or Android or something like that. So for someone to switch brands,

257
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:00,805
Speaker 6:  for someone to have a conquest and, and go from one brand to another, it's

258
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:04,125
Speaker 6:  not that big of a deal. And especially it's easy with a slate because, you

259
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,045
Speaker 6:  know, there's no software really to worry about anyway. So it's, it'd be,

260
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:11,005
Speaker 6:  it's kind of a new it, it's greenfield territory. And that I think

261
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:14,965
Speaker 6:  is the biggest question for me is are people really gonna put

262
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:17,405
Speaker 6:  their money where their mouth is? You know, like I said, people have been

263
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:20,405
Speaker 6:  asking me when is Ford gonna make a a small ranger again? When is someone

264
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,965
Speaker 6:  a good ring out a cheap frontier or a cheap Tacoma and

265
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:28,005
Speaker 6:  this is their time to put their money forward and say, this is what I actually

266
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:31,485
Speaker 6:  want. The interest in the article has been huge and that's encouraging,

267
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,765
Speaker 6:  but we also saw huge interest around the cyber truck when that was unveiled

268
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:38,405
Speaker 6:  and that obviously has not landed quite so well. So I'm curious to see how,

269
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,365
Speaker 6:  how this lands when it does ship, hopefully toward the end of next year.

270
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:44,245
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah, we're, we're gonna come back to that because I've, I've heard,

271
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:48,085
Speaker 2:  I've heard that phrase so many times that I've come to not believe it, but

272
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:51,405
Speaker 2:  we're gonna come back to that. The last thing I'm trying to figure out about

273
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:55,325
Speaker 2:  the truck is Slate seems to imagine kind of the

274
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:59,045
Speaker 2:  ecosystem of a car very differently from

275
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:02,965
Speaker 2:  your average company. Like what was your sense of how they're thinking about

276
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:06,805
Speaker 2:  it in terms of like, okay, I I do want to add a stereo. Is that

277
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:10,485
Speaker 2:  something slate is going to make? Is that something that they're

278
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:14,125
Speaker 2:  imagining I can just like walk to Best Buy and buy? Am I gonna, am I gonna

279
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,445
Speaker 2:  do the repairs on the car myself? Which is a thing I think an an executive

280
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:21,045
Speaker 2:  hinted to you as part of their plan. Like the sort of car

281
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:24,965
Speaker 2:  world is enormous and much bigger than just the car that you own. Right?

282
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:28,885
Speaker 2:  I is slate trying to fit into that or sort of reimagine that.

283
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:32,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah, slate I is really rapidly or, or radically I should say,

284
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:36,485
Speaker 6:  embracing the DIY mentality, both in terms of right to repair and also in

285
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:40,045
Speaker 6:  terms of customization. So, you know, again, it starts on the outside with

286
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:43,045
Speaker 6:  these vinyl wrap kits that Slate will offer, but they'll also make it pretty

287
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:46,685
Speaker 6:  easy to do your own wood templates, that kind of thing. So customizing the

288
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,765
Speaker 6:  look should be more easy than any other vehicle out there. But yeah, when

289
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:53,565
Speaker 6:  it comes to customize the interior, there are provisions in there for

290
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:57,285
Speaker 6:  connecting USB devices, power for speakers, that kind of thing. So you can

291
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,565
Speaker 6:  pretty easily bring your own devices there or they have said that they will

292
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:04,405
Speaker 6:  offer some upgrade kits as well to bring speakers into the vehicle. But I

293
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:08,365
Speaker 6:  think the idea by and large is for you to be doing

294
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:11,725
Speaker 6:  this work yourself or to work with some kind of aftermarket installer if

295
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,485
Speaker 6:  you want to, but they're gonna be creating something that they call Slate

296
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:18,245
Speaker 6:  University, which is basically like a, like a big online

297
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:21,365
Speaker 6:  fact, a knowledge base kind of thing where you can look up information on

298
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:24,765
Speaker 6:  how to install speakers into your vehicle, how to do a vinyl wrap and even

299
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:28,725
Speaker 6:  how to do some repair. So for example, if your mirror

300
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:32,565
Speaker 6:  breaks and that's covered by warranty, instead of you having to go to a shop

301
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:35,445
Speaker 6:  to replace that mirror, they want to basically send you a new mirror and

302
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:38,725
Speaker 6:  tell you how to install it. Interesting. Which on one hand it feels kind

303
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:41,725
Speaker 6:  of basic to some degree, like, shouldn't someone do that for me? But also

304
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:45,685
Speaker 6:  on the other hand, it sounds a lot nicer for me to just go out in my driveway

305
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:48,965
Speaker 6:  and take off the old mirror and pop on a new one rather than driving it down

306
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:52,045
Speaker 6:  to the dealership, dropping it off in the morning, maybe getting a courtesy

307
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:54,885
Speaker 6:  car or maybe just spending four hours sitting in the waiting room reading

308
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:58,605
Speaker 6:  Golf Digest for four hours, waiting for this thing to get done, that I could

309
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:02,005
Speaker 6:  have done myself into five minutes. So I think again, there's an optimistic

310
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:05,085
Speaker 6:  and a pessimistic way of looking at this. I, I personally am someone who

311
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:08,525
Speaker 6:  likes to work on my cars and to have a company that is going to be

312
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:12,845
Speaker 6:  actively supporting me doing that is, is quite novel. Most companies don't

313
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,365
Speaker 6:  want you to do that because their dealers make so much money on aftermarket

314
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,805
Speaker 6:  service and sales support that, that they don't really want to cut that off.

315
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,885
Speaker 2:  It's funny, part of the reason I ask is I had this, I had the experience

316
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:24,845
Speaker 2:  you described literally on Friday, like just a few days ago,

317
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:28,605
Speaker 2:  I had to drop my car off and they were like, oh, it's a pretty simple thing

318
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:32,045
Speaker 2:  to fix. The problem is we don't have this one gasket that we need.

319
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:35,605
Speaker 2:  And I was like, well can can I just go to like AutoZone and buy the gasket

320
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:38,685
Speaker 2:  and bring it to you? And he was like, no, if it doesn't come from this specific

321
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:41,525
Speaker 2:  place, it's not covered in your warranty. And then it's technically an out

322
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:44,685
Speaker 2:  of warranty repair. So they sent me home and now I have to go back and do

323
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,525
Speaker 2:  this whole process again later this week. That course, just so they can put

324
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,965
Speaker 2:  a gasket that looks like every other gasket on my car. And so there is,

325
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,605
Speaker 2:  there is something about that that I would love to break apart,

326
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:59,125
Speaker 2:  even though the idea of sort of

327
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,965
Speaker 2:  encouraging everyone to try and fix their own car has some pretty obvious

328
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:04,725
Speaker 2:  scary downsides.

329
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,205
Speaker 6:  Right. And, and they've said very clearly to me that anything that is dangerous

330
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:11,805
Speaker 6:  will not be allowed to be done yourself. So anything involving the high voltage

331
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:14,285
Speaker 6:  system, for example, if you want to get the larger battery pack, it's actually

332
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:17,165
Speaker 6:  going to be a second battery pack you'll install in the vehicle, but you

333
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:20,005
Speaker 6:  won't be doing that yourself because A, it's gonna be incredibly heavy, but

334
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:22,965
Speaker 6:  B at that point you'll be interfacing with the vehicle's high voltage system.

335
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:25,365
Speaker 6:  So that kind of thing you'll have to take it to somewhere else to have done.

336
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:29,645
Speaker 6:  But upgrades and minor repairs, things like that, they want you to do, do

337
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:32,525
Speaker 6:  yourself. And I think that that, again, a lot of folks will find very empowering

338
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:35,645
Speaker 6:  and to have the support to do so. And I can only imagine what the, you know,

339
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:39,525
Speaker 6:  the user groups are gonna be like, I'm big in the 3D printing community as

340
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,285
Speaker 6:  well, or I should say I'm, I'm quite actively involved in it. And it's really

341
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:46,285
Speaker 6:  interesting to see the kind of support and, and help that you see when people

342
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:48,670
Speaker 6:  are trying to figure out how to get a new film and to print on their new

343
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,365
Speaker 6:  printer and the kind of advice that they get. And I'm really looking forward

344
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:54,365
Speaker 6:  to seeing that kind of approach brought to a car because it's not the kind

345
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:55,245
Speaker 6:  of thing that you typically see.

346
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:59,445
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah. What's your sense of how mainstream an idea

347
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:02,125
Speaker 2:  like that really is? Because I actually think that the 3D printing community

348
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,765
Speaker 2:  is kind of a good way to look at this, right? Where Yeah, lots of people

349
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,245
Speaker 2:  have 3D printing, It is more accessible than ever. It's more useful than

350
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:13,125
Speaker 2:  ever, but it's not, there was a time many years ago when, when you and I

351
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,965
Speaker 2:  were covering tech and everything Yeah. It was like we're all gonna have

352
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:18,925
Speaker 2:  3D printers in our house and that didn't pan out. And there's something

353
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:22,765
Speaker 2:  about this idea that seems like it, it's obviously going to appeal

354
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:26,525
Speaker 2:  to a specific kind of, you know, raspberry pie owning

355
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:30,485
Speaker 2:  tinkerer who Yeah. Who sort of enjoys the process of all of this stuff and

356
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:33,685
Speaker 2:  thinks that putting the mirror on their car is fun and doing the vinyl wraps

357
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:37,265
Speaker 2:  is fun and interesting and there are a lot of those people, but there's a

358
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:40,225
Speaker 2:  much bigger group of people that has traditionally not wanted to do those

359
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:42,785
Speaker 2:  things. It's slate after those people.

360
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:46,465
Speaker 6:  I think so for sure. Okay. Yeah, as you said, I think the maker community

361
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:49,465
Speaker 6:  is really gonna resonate with this vehicle and I think that's some of the

362
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:52,265
Speaker 6:  biggest excitement I've seen online so far for the vehicle. It is in that

363
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:55,865
Speaker 6:  community, but for sure Slate wants to deliver a fully functional vehicle.

364
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:59,905
Speaker 6:  It may be limited in function in terms of many other vehicles, but it, it's

365
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:02,505
Speaker 6:  the kind of thing that you'll be able to drive and use without having to

366
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:05,425
Speaker 6:  do anything to it if you don't want to. And then it's just gonna be up to

367
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,065
Speaker 6:  you if you wanna learn how to do these other things or pay someone else to

368
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,905
Speaker 6:  do these things for you to do the upgrades and that kind of thing. So for

369
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:13,545
Speaker 6:  sure it'll be a fully functional vehicle and slate for sure definitely wants

370
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:17,265
Speaker 6:  to be targeting, you know, they want anybody who's right now stuck in a six

371
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:21,065
Speaker 6:  or seven year car payment cycle on a vehicle that is gonna be,

372
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:24,025
Speaker 6:  you know, maybe not even drivable by the time their loan is up. They want

373
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:27,665
Speaker 6:  someone to have a a a, an affordable practical option that's,

374
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:31,185
Speaker 6:  that's far better for them on the daily, even if they're not, you know, a

375
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:34,185
Speaker 6:  3D print enthusiast, that kind of thing. So for sure they wanna target that

376
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:36,585
Speaker 6:  audience, but whether or not this car resonates with that audience, that

377
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:38,225
Speaker 6:  I think is a big question. Yeah.

378
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:41,705
Speaker 2:  I it's the, the like pickup truck,

379
00:22:42,505 --> 00:22:46,305
Speaker 2:  DIY sort of enthusiast world Yeah. Is,

380
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,025
Speaker 2:  is just fascinating and we've just never seen somebody try to kind of do

381
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:51,865
Speaker 2:  all of that at once. And I think part of the reason I I am so interested

382
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:55,825
Speaker 2:  in this truck is it It is, It is like speaking my language

383
00:22:55,845 --> 00:22:57,505
Speaker 2:  in so many specific ways.

384
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:58,425
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. Mine

385
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:01,905
Speaker 2:  Too. And yet I'm just, it's, it's just hard to see who is really gonna resonate

386
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:05,625
Speaker 2:  with it. Let's talk about the company a little bit because I think it's,

387
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:09,305
Speaker 2:  it's timing is fascinating, but obviously

388
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,745
Speaker 2:  this, this truck has been in the process longer than Trump's tariff

389
00:23:13,745 --> 00:23:17,385
Speaker 2:  regulations have been happening. Yes. So the idea of like we spun up an American

390
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:21,305
Speaker 2:  manufacturer to make cars is, is like true but not sufficient. Right?

391
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:24,505
Speaker 2:  So tell me a little bit about this company. Where did Slate Auto come from?

392
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:28,945
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it, it, this is part of what I have to be a little bit

393
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:31,345
Speaker 6:  cagey on because I don't know all the details yet in terms I've asked a lot

394
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,585
Speaker 6:  of questions in terms of funding and that kind of thing. And certainly, you

395
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,905
Speaker 6:  know, there's been a lot of reports out there that have some interesting

396
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:39,025
Speaker 6:  information out there. But from what I can say, you know, the company's been

397
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:42,985
Speaker 6:  in, in development for about three years now. CEO is Chris Barman

398
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:46,965
Speaker 6:  who's a former executive at Fiat Chrysler. And so she was there for a

399
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:50,765
Speaker 6:  long time and now she is taking over things. Lead designer is Tisha

400
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:54,485
Speaker 6:  Johnson who was at Volvo. She headed up Volvo's interior design for a long

401
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:57,725
Speaker 6:  time. So they've got some very talented people who are behind this and, and

402
00:23:57,725 --> 00:24:00,925
Speaker 6:  this, you know, the idea was definitely fundamentally to create this low-cost

403
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:03,805
Speaker 6:  vehicle from the beginning. So this is something that they kind of stumbled

404
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,525
Speaker 6:  into the impression that I've gotten and said this was really the idea from

405
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:07,565
Speaker 6:  the beginning. Okay.

406
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:10,725
Speaker 2:  So they started with not like we wanna build a new company, but they started

407
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,085
Speaker 2:  with like, we wanna build this car.

408
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:15,445
Speaker 6:  Th that, that's my impression. Yeah. And then, so the company I believe is

409
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:18,245
Speaker 6:  actually headquartered in Michigan, but they have a design studio in the

410
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:21,485
Speaker 6:  LA area. So I think the majority of the work is happening in Michigan in

411
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:25,325
Speaker 6:  terms of production. The in indications are that

412
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:28,605
Speaker 6:  they'll be producing the vehicle in Indiana. The exact details of that have

413
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:32,525
Speaker 6:  not been disclosed yet. But again, the advantages of, of

414
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:35,205
Speaker 6:  the production we were talking about earlier of injection molding versus

415
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:38,085
Speaker 6:  stamping, that kind thing means that they can have a, a relatively small

416
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:41,725
Speaker 6:  footprint and basic factory compared to what, you know, if you look at the

417
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:44,605
Speaker 6:  Tesla Fremont facility for example, that thing is a massive sprawling thing.

418
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:48,765
Speaker 6:  Slates beginning investment should be a lot lower and their factor should

419
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:51,885
Speaker 6:  be a lot simpler and smaller than that. And then when it comes to funding,

420
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:54,645
Speaker 6:  obviously, you know, there's a lot of talk about Jeff Bezos being involved.

421
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:59,005
Speaker 6:  I asked rather pointedly, you know, is this a facet of Amazon

422
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:03,085
Speaker 6:  is a spinoff of Amazon, are we gonna see these with Amazon stick stickers

423
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:06,685
Speaker 6:  on 'em doing deliveries? Will you be able to go on amazon.com and and buy

424
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:10,525
Speaker 6:  them? And they downplayed that quite a bit. This is definitely

425
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:14,325
Speaker 6:  not officially part of Amazon, but when I asked them, will you be able to

426
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,845
Speaker 6:  buy the these on Amazon, they kind of shrugged their shoulders and said,

427
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:20,445
Speaker 6:  who knows maybe so, you know, don't think of this as an

428
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:24,365
Speaker 6:  Amazon subsidiary Right. But there may be some family ties in there due to

429
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:26,405
Speaker 6:  Jeff Bezos's involvement, if that makes sense.

430
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:29,525
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah, our, our old friend Sean O. Kane has done some very good reporting

431
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:31,685
Speaker 2:  on this at TechCrunch. Excellent. To willing link to all that in the show.

432
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:31,925
Speaker 2:  Yep.

433
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:35,925
Speaker 6:  In fact, he had a new report that just dropped us think two days ago on that

434
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:38,685
Speaker 6:  factory. So he's got some more details there as well, which given the strength

435
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:41,685
Speaker 6:  of the reporting so far, I, I think, I think sounds legit to me.

436
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:44,405
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah. We'll we'll put that in the show notes for sure. What do you

437
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:47,605
Speaker 2:  make of the timing the, this company's been, I would say, in, in sort of

438
00:25:47,885 --> 00:25:51,125
Speaker 2:  remarkable secret for three years as you described. Why, why do you think

439
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,765
Speaker 2:  it's, it's coming out now, especially with a car, it's not planning to ship

440
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,365
Speaker 2:  for, you know, a year and change.

441
00:25:55,515 --> 00:25:59,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's impressive how quiet they've been. When I learned

442
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:02,965
Speaker 6:  about Slate, I had, I was invited to go see this thing and I had no idea

443
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,525
Speaker 6:  what it was. So I kind of went on faith of some of the people who I knew

444
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:08,525
Speaker 6:  were at this company, but I knew nothing about it. And to be able to keep,

445
00:26:09,305 --> 00:26:12,725
Speaker 6:  you know, it's hard enough for a car company to keep a new model secret for

446
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:16,045
Speaker 6:  that long, but to keep an entire company secret for that long, It is quite

447
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:16,405
Speaker 6:  impressive.

448
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:19,645
Speaker 2:  And this is a pretty unusual looking vehicle, right? It like in in person

449
00:26:19,755 --> 00:26:22,245
Speaker 2:  it's not, you're not gonna mistake it for something else pretty quickly.

450
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:22,725
Speaker 2:  Right, right.

451
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:25,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I, I talked to 'em about that and they actually have not done any open

452
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:28,005
Speaker 6:  road testing on the vehicle at all, which is part of how they did that. Because

453
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,445
Speaker 6:  otherwise yeah, we would've seen, I think people would've speculated that

454
00:26:30,445 --> 00:26:33,485
Speaker 6:  it was a new, you know, 40 V or something like that if it had come out. Yeah.

455
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:36,645
Speaker 6:  But anyhow, so that was part of how they, they managed to do that. But I

456
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:40,485
Speaker 6:  think the timing now makes sense because, you know, it takes 4, 5, 6

457
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:44,005
Speaker 6:  years to develop a, a new vehicle. You wanna get some interest in it, in

458
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:47,325
Speaker 6:  in time to get some ERs going to, for them to get an idea of what the demand's

459
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:49,925
Speaker 6:  gonna be like and where the demand is going to be. You know, they need to

460
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:53,725
Speaker 6:  come up with fulfillment centers, delivery centers and, and service centers

461
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:57,405
Speaker 6:  for these vehicles. And so they need to know where to, you know,

462
00:26:57,405 --> 00:27:00,005
Speaker 6:  centralize those things. So I think that gives them enough runway to figure

463
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:02,805
Speaker 6:  out what they need to do from a logistics standpoint, which is another huge

464
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:06,325
Speaker 6:  part of this. You know, launching a new car company that can be very complicated.

465
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:09,685
Speaker 2:  Well, and just on the, on the logistics piece, it seems like the logistics

466
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:13,365
Speaker 2:  piece is where a lot of these sort of would be car startups get

467
00:27:13,395 --> 00:27:17,165
Speaker 2:  screwed up. Exactly Right. And I think, do you have a sense

468
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:21,125
Speaker 2:  of what Slate maybe has learned or is trying to do differently?

469
00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:23,725
Speaker 2:  I mean it seems like, again, to your point about the manufacturing, just

470
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,885
Speaker 2:  yeah, making the thing easier to make goes a really long way because if there's

471
00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:30,725
Speaker 2:  one thing we've learned over the last 20 years of EVs, it's that

472
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:34,245
Speaker 2:  they're hard and expensive to make and that that is the thing that will kill

473
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:37,525
Speaker 2:  you. Is it as simple as that, that that's their move to try and do better

474
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:37,805
Speaker 2:  here?

475
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:41,085
Speaker 6:  No, there's a whole lot of interesting stuff going on on the delivery fulfillment

476
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,405
Speaker 6:  dens and service and support side as well. So direct sales for one thing,

477
00:27:44,405 --> 00:27:47,245
Speaker 6:  which is probably not a surprise at this point, but that does add a lot of

478
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:50,285
Speaker 6:  complication. There are different rules in different states in terms of what

479
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:54,045
Speaker 6:  you can and cannot do for delivery centers. It's pretty restrictive in,

480
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:57,205
Speaker 6:  in many states in the US So there's a very good chance that you won't be

481
00:27:57,205 --> 00:28:01,165
Speaker 6:  able to go around the corner to a slate store as such and pick up your

482
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:03,845
Speaker 6:  vehicle. Chances are you're probably gonna be driving a fair distance or

483
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:07,485
Speaker 6:  slate has said that they will deliver them to you. But interestingly, from

484
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:11,045
Speaker 6:  a service standpoint, they're actually partnering with some nationwide service

485
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:14,925
Speaker 6:  center or service centers to do all the warranty work on

486
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:17,605
Speaker 6:  their vehicles. They haven't said exactly which one It is, but I'll think

487
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:21,445
Speaker 6:  of something like a Meineke, you know, your local muffler shop, that kind

488
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:23,965
Speaker 6:  of thing. It'll be something like that where you'll be able to take your

489
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:26,445
Speaker 6:  vehicle to get a service and they said that they've got basically the entire

490
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:29,685
Speaker 6:  country covered or they will have the entire country covered on day one,

491
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:32,485
Speaker 6:  which is interesting and very different again than what we've seen before.

492
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:37,125
Speaker 6:  And, and then, you know, from a a logistics standpoint, not having dealerships

493
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:41,005
Speaker 6:  means that they get the full cost of the vehicle. There's no dealership taking

494
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:44,285
Speaker 6:  a cut. Same thing with accessory sales. You'll be getting those directly

495
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:46,965
Speaker 6:  from the company. Typically a dealership would take a cut of that as well

496
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:49,685
Speaker 6:  if you're buying accessories, options, that kind of thing. So again, that

497
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:52,765
Speaker 6:  just helps their margins, which helps 'em get to that, that low price point.

498
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:57,005
Speaker 2:  Okay. What, what, how would you handicap the odds of this thing actually

499
00:28:57,005 --> 00:29:00,205
Speaker 2:  hitting the road in late 2026? I think we, we've been burned by this many

500
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:04,155
Speaker 2:  times. Yeah. And even I think there, there's even a question of like, is

501
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:07,995
Speaker 2:  any of this real Right? I think, I think I, I'm actually pretty

502
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:11,315
Speaker 2:  willing to give this the benefit of it out in part Yeah. Because I want to,

503
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:14,875
Speaker 2:  and in part because it actually, a thing that they've done is make it,

504
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:18,395
Speaker 2:  make a car that's easy to make, which I find very compelling. And also like

505
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:22,035
Speaker 2:  I'm more willing to bet on the existence of this thing than your average

506
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:25,595
Speaker 2:  $120,000 new, you know, Roadster competitor.

507
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:29,675
Speaker 6:  Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I, I'm quite bullish, but I was, if

508
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:32,715
Speaker 6:  I were in a position where I had not seen the thing, if I had not talked

509
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:35,115
Speaker 6:  to the executives, if I had not been to some of the facilities to see these

510
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:38,115
Speaker 6:  things, I, I would probably be extremely, extremely skeptical myself. 'cause

511
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:41,765
Speaker 6:  we've been burned by, you know, your aptera, your canoes, that, that kind

512
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:45,005
Speaker 6:  of thing over the years. Yeah. Kers even. And so

513
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:48,005
Speaker 6:  there's a lot of reason for skepticism here and I think that that's fair.

514
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:50,965
Speaker 6:  Especially, you know, we're talking about even if It is a relatively affordable

515
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:53,925
Speaker 6:  car, it's still gonna be a big investment for people. And so it makes sense

516
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,165
Speaker 6:  to be skeptical about where you put your money. And so for that reason, I,

517
00:29:57,165 --> 00:30:01,045
Speaker 6:  I think that's fair. But having, having seen the vehicle, having sat in the

518
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:04,805
Speaker 6:  vehicle, having talked to these executives and having really looked

519
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:08,005
Speaker 6:  deeply at how they've engineered not just the vehicle but the company to

520
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:11,765
Speaker 6:  support this short runway, quick path to

521
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:15,485
Speaker 6:  profitability, I think that they are in a much better shape when it comes

522
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:19,405
Speaker 6:  to launching a new EV brand then just about anybody out there. And they

523
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:23,005
Speaker 6:  haven't had to go to extremely questionable lengths to get funding to continue

524
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:26,085
Speaker 6:  to give them the money that they need to. So the only question mark in my

525
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:29,325
Speaker 6:  eye is what is the consumer reaction going to be? Obviously it's been very

526
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:33,485
Speaker 6:  positive so far, but again, we've seen that with other EVs in the past.

527
00:30:33,485 --> 00:30:37,285
Speaker 6:  It haven't gone very far. So if the demand is there, i I give the

528
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:41,165
Speaker 6:  company a, a good chance of success. But as you alluded to

529
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:45,005
Speaker 6:  before, Trump tariffs and everything else going on right now, ev

530
00:30:45,005 --> 00:30:47,965
Speaker 6:  subsidies are very much a question mark hanging over the current state of

531
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:51,125
Speaker 6:  the industry. There are definitely some roadblocks to

532
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:54,485
Speaker 6:  to, to overcome, but I would say we're probably looking at

533
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:59,385
Speaker 6:  80 to 90% success chance of them actually getting a vehicle to

534
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:03,265
Speaker 6:  production, I would say. Which, which to me is, is quite high given

535
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:03,985
Speaker 6:  the I'll

536
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:04,865
Speaker 2:  I'll take that. Yeah. Yeah.

537
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,025
Speaker 6:  But in terms of the long-term success of, of the company at that point, I,

538
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:09,185
Speaker 6:  I think it's anybody's guess After that.

539
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:12,785
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. I mean is there a 90% chance we're all gonna be

540
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:14,985
Speaker 2:  here in 18 months? Who knows? So I'll take it.

541
00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:16,185
Speaker 6:  Yeah, me too.

542
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:19,945
Speaker 2:  Last thing and then I'm gonna let you go. I is the car nice. Like you've,

543
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:23,905
Speaker 2:  you've, you've touched it, you've sat in it. I'm so there, there's so

544
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:27,425
Speaker 2:  much about this that is designed to be, you know, minimalist and cheap and

545
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:29,625
Speaker 2:  straightforward, but it also, like the whole thing falls apart if it's not

546
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,665
Speaker 2:  like fun to sit inside and drive. Right, right. Is it fun to sit inside?

547
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:35,665
Speaker 6:  I have not driven the car yet. Yeah. And, and I think that, that, that's

548
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:38,505
Speaker 6:  the big caveat. But in terms of actually getting in the vehicle, It is actually

549
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:41,265
Speaker 6:  quite nice. Yeah. The interior is extremely basic as you can imagine. But

550
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:45,065
Speaker 6:  it's comfortable. I am fairly tall at six feet, but I have short legs,

551
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:47,425
Speaker 6:  which means I sit very tall, which means I often have a hard time fitting

552
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,345
Speaker 6:  into a lot of cars in terms of headroom, I had no issue at all. You know,

553
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:53,385
Speaker 6:  there, there's no sunroof here, so that helps. But I had plenty of headroom

554
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:57,265
Speaker 6:  in there and even I, I got got to sit in one of the SUV configurations of

555
00:31:57,265 --> 00:32:01,185
Speaker 6:  the vehicle and I was shocked that I was actually okay getting in the second

556
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:03,825
Speaker 6:  row as well. It was a little bit clumsy to get in there, but once I was in

557
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:06,465
Speaker 6:  there I was pretty comfortable, which was quite surprising to me. So from

558
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:10,425
Speaker 6:  an overall room comfort standpoint, that that was

559
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:14,225
Speaker 6:  fine. And even things like the bed, for example, the truck bed is extremely

560
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:18,185
Speaker 6:  low, which modern trucks F-150 Silverados, the bed height is

561
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:20,545
Speaker 6:  kind of at chest level almost. Right. If you're loading hay bales in there,

562
00:32:20,545 --> 00:32:22,785
Speaker 6:  that kind of thing, that's very awkward. But yeah, I'm quite comfortable

563
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:25,185
Speaker 6:  in, in the truck. But the big question is driving that changes everything

564
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:28,505
Speaker 6:  and I have no idea what it's like to drive yet. In fact, most people at Slate

565
00:32:28,505 --> 00:32:30,465
Speaker 6:  don't either because they haven't done any open road testing. So.

566
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,855
Speaker 2:  Right. And presumably now that it's out there, part

567
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:37,055
Speaker 2:  of the point of getting it out there, I would assume is to be able to start

568
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,135
Speaker 2:  putting this thing on the road. Yeah.

569
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:41,325
Speaker 6:  They've got a lot of miles ahead of them in cold weather testing, hot weather

570
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:44,805
Speaker 6:  testing, all sorts of towing conditions, you know, to publish a towing rating

571
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:48,645
Speaker 6:  in the US requires a lot of regimented testing at, at grade, at

572
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:51,245
Speaker 6:  high temperatures, that kind of thing. So they've got a lot of work ahead

573
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:54,965
Speaker 6:  of them over this next 18 months or so. But, but yeah, I think

574
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:57,565
Speaker 6:  from where they're at right now, things are, things are looking quite good.

575
00:32:58,105 --> 00:33:01,885
Speaker 2:  I'm excited. I, I confess, I am in absolutely no

576
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:05,645
Speaker 2:  way a truck guy. Like I, I live in, I live in a town home

577
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:09,685
Speaker 2:  in, in the suburbs of dc Like no one needs a pickup truck less than I do.

578
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,205
Speaker 2:  But I have spent a lot of time looking at this thing over the last few days

579
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:13,685
Speaker 2:  being like, I, I, I could buy this car.

580
00:33:13,945 --> 00:33:17,805
Speaker 6:  It seems cool. I, I think it solves a lot of problems or it, it offers

581
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:21,045
Speaker 6:  a lot of aspirational hope for a lot of people who don't want the burden

582
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:24,485
Speaker 6:  of a giant truck sitting around. But who would like the ability to go, you

583
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:27,245
Speaker 6:  know, to go to yard sale, to go to an antique shop, to right. To get that

584
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:29,645
Speaker 6:  kinda stuff, not have to worry about the logistics of a renting a truck or

585
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:32,845
Speaker 6:  borrowing a truck. And I, I think it'll, it'll find a home for a lot of people.

586
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:33,765
Speaker 6:  I hope it does. And

587
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:37,005
Speaker 2:  There does seem to be a thing where people, people want a car to believe

588
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:40,805
Speaker 2:  in, in a, in a, in a sort of real like human moral way. And this

589
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:43,165
Speaker 2:  seems to have hit that note pretty well for a lot of people.

590
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:46,205
Speaker 6:  Right? I think most people right now, if you're car shopping, you kind of

591
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:49,045
Speaker 6:  pick a car that matches your personality and as we're seeing certain brands

592
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:52,205
Speaker 6:  are, are changing their personality rather Dr. Dramatically. And so I think

593
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:55,165
Speaker 6:  people are seeing that that can have a negative impact if you've already

594
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:58,245
Speaker 6:  owned the car that no longer suits your personality. The idea with Slate

595
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:01,125
Speaker 6:  is that you can change the car's personality to match yours. You can even

596
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,805
Speaker 6:  go so far as to change the lighting patterns on the nose, which is really

597
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:07,285
Speaker 6:  kind of like the identification mark of the vehicle is really that nose

598
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,965
Speaker 6:  and slate will let you change anything on there that you want to. So I think

599
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,925
Speaker 6:  this will be something that people can really find personal ownership and

600
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,405
Speaker 6:  commitment too.

601
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,245
Speaker 2:  I love it. Alright, well when you drive it, you're coming back. We're gonna

602
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:16,965
Speaker 2:  talk about it Sounds

603
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:17,645
Speaker 6:  Very good. I look

604
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:19,165
Speaker 2:  Forward to it. Tim Stevens, thank you so much.

605
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:19,965
Speaker 6:  Thanks David.

606
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:24,405
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take a quick break and then we're gonna come back and talk

607
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:27,565
Speaker 2:  about how to use your phone a little less because I think we could all stand

608
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,045
Speaker 2:  to use our phone a little less. We'll be right back.

609
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:33,565
Speaker 12:  Yes. I'm Casey Johnston and I'm a writer and editor and

610
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:37,485
Speaker 12:  author. I have written about tech and health and science

611
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:41,325
Speaker 12:  my whole career. Started out as a tech blogger, which is how I know David

612
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:45,325
Speaker 12:  and I have a book coming out next month called A Physical

613
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:49,205
Speaker 12:  Education that is about my experience getting into lifting weights, the

614
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:53,125
Speaker 12:  science and psychology thereof. And I

615
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:57,045
Speaker 12:  write a newsletter called She's a Beast that's about health,

616
00:36:57,845 --> 00:37:00,805
Speaker 12:  strength, body stuff, food stuff, all that good stuff.

617
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:05,245
Speaker 2:  See that's, I started describing She's a Beast and basically did

618
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:08,405
Speaker 2:  the same thing. I just started saying words. I was like, so I'm glad to know

619
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:11,005
Speaker 2:  that that is the official explanation for what she's abuse is.

620
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:15,085
Speaker 12:  It's, it's difficult to sum up something I, I cover a lot of ground,

621
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:18,685
Speaker 12:  but it's just like, I promise it's good. So just, you know,

622
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:23,765
Speaker 12:  see it for yourself if you like it, don't rely on my description, just,

623
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:27,285
Speaker 12:  just check it out. I like it. And then if it's for you, you'll know when

624
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:29,845
Speaker 12:  you see it. So I, I trust you.

625
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:33,125
Speaker 2:  All right. So the reason I have brought you here today is 'cause I think

626
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:38,125
Speaker 2:  you have done as like thoughtful and complete a

627
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:41,805
Speaker 2:  sort of excision of your smartphone from your life as anyone I've seen. And

628
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:45,525
Speaker 2:  I just wanna talk through a bunch of the like process and what has actually

629
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:49,445
Speaker 2:  worked for you and all of this. But I just, let's, let's rewind a little.

630
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:53,205
Speaker 2:  You've been writing about this for months now, but

631
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:56,725
Speaker 2:  like was there an impetus where you were like, I am looking at my phone too

632
00:37:56,725 --> 00:38:00,205
Speaker 2:  much, I need to, I need to quit it with the screen time? Was there like a

633
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:01,365
Speaker 2:  thing that happened? I

634
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:05,085
Speaker 12:  Don't know if there was a particular event, but I was getting to

635
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:09,085
Speaker 12:  a point in the fall of 2023,

636
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:13,485
Speaker 12:  early 2024, where I just felt like I have no

637
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:17,365
Speaker 12:  control over how much time goes into this thing.

638
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:21,245
Speaker 12:  Like it's just disappearing down the hole of my phone

639
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:25,205
Speaker 12:  screen. And I actually started pulling out old

640
00:38:25,205 --> 00:38:28,165
Speaker 12:  phones like, do you save phones ever?

641
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:29,445
Speaker 2:  Oh sure. Yeah.

642
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:34,005
Speaker 12:  I know some people just like get they, they do like the swap program. But

643
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:37,885
Speaker 12:  I like every once in a while in a cycle I

644
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:41,725
Speaker 12:  will keep one and not resell it because I break my phones

645
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:45,685
Speaker 12:  often also like, sure, break, crack the screen and then, and then you're

646
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:49,325
Speaker 12:  out a phone. So started pulling out my old phones being like,

647
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:53,925
Speaker 12:  is there some sort of like solution and going backwards

648
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:57,685
Speaker 12:  somehow? And I was of course reading every, every article that ever

649
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:00,965
Speaker 12:  came out that was like, I went back to a flip phone and like here's how

650
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:04,285
Speaker 12:  it went. 'cause I was just like dreaming of having a

651
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:09,215
Speaker 12:  more, a better handle on this situation. And at

652
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:13,055
Speaker 12:  one point I popped my sim card into a iPhone four

653
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:16,535
Speaker 12:  s and it was just like, this is so small and so cute and it like,

654
00:39:17,085 --> 00:39:20,415
Speaker 12:  it's so much, it's like the screen, they're like, the phones are

655
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:24,215
Speaker 12:  unmanageable large now. And when I put this,

656
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:27,695
Speaker 12:  the sim card in, it was like, there's something that didn't work. I think

657
00:39:27,705 --> 00:39:31,615
Speaker 12:  phone calls didn't work but it could message and it could do maps and

658
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:34,935
Speaker 12:  I had no apps installed on it and I was like, this is sort of

659
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:39,295
Speaker 12:  ideal. Like the key seems to be stepping back. And I noticed that in

660
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:43,135
Speaker 12:  every flip phone article where people

661
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:46,455
Speaker 12:  go back to like T nine texting, like they go all the way back, the main

662
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:49,855
Speaker 12:  things that they miss are group messaging and like the sort of

663
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:53,775
Speaker 12:  convenience of messages that sync across your devices and the mapping,

664
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:56,855
Speaker 12:  you know, there's no substitute for Google maps. Totally. You have to like

665
00:39:57,005 --> 00:40:00,855
Speaker 12:  draw yourself a map. Yeah. So I was like, what if I made a

666
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:04,655
Speaker 12:  version of sort of like make my phone as dumb as I can

667
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:09,015
Speaker 12:  retain those two important things. 'cause it's like the thing that prevents

668
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:12,335
Speaker 12:  us from going all the way back to flip phones is basically like those two

669
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:15,895
Speaker 12:  things occasionally like Uber, stuff like that.

670
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:19,575
Speaker 2:  Right. It does strike me. It's such a slippery slope though. And I like,

671
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:21,935
Speaker 2:  'cause I think I, I've been through this too where it's like, okay, the first

672
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,095
Speaker 2:  thing I'm gonna do is just delete all of my apps, right? And it's like, okay,

673
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:29,055
Speaker 2:  well then I'm gonna, I need, I need a couple. And then it's like, oh crap,

674
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:32,895
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna travel. So I, I'll put Uber back and then it's like, oh well I

675
00:40:32,895 --> 00:40:35,335
Speaker 2:  ha I should probably put Ticketmaster back 'cause I'm gonna a concert in

676
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:38,135
Speaker 2:  a couple weeks and then all of a sudden like 10 days later, all I've done

677
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,855
Speaker 2:  is like a bunch more work to reinstall most of the apps that I already had.

678
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:45,055
Speaker 2:  And I feel like the, the thing that is like alluring about going back to

679
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:49,055
Speaker 2:  a piece of junk phone is that it prevents you from doing that. There is this

680
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:52,455
Speaker 2:  idea that like if you don't wanna use your phone so much, just don't use

681
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:56,095
Speaker 2:  your phone so much. Just like be disciplined, you jackass. Right? Like be

682
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:59,375
Speaker 2:  a better person and it'll all be fine. And I feel like this is a thing you

683
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:03,175
Speaker 2:  think about in, in another part of your life a lot. And I feel like you seem

684
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:06,295
Speaker 2:  to have brought some of that to your phone where it's like you just, you

685
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:09,335
Speaker 2:  have a phone that could be more and you just sort of stared at it one day

686
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:10,855
Speaker 2:  and you were like, I will not let you do it.

687
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:16,615
Speaker 12:  Right. I mean it's difficult because the

688
00:41:16,615 --> 00:41:19,935
Speaker 12:  technology has insinuated itself

689
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:24,455
Speaker 12:  in so many ways. Even to the point of,

690
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,175
Speaker 12:  you know, in this article that I wrote, it's like, it's our clock.

691
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:31,815
Speaker 12:  Like how many times, like we have these stats about like people pick up

692
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:35,365
Speaker 12:  their phones a hundred times a day, 200 times a day, whatever. But how many

693
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:38,845
Speaker 12:  of those times am I just trying to see what time It is? Like Hmm. I'm not

694
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:42,565
Speaker 12:  even necessarily always going

695
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,555
Speaker 12:  to the, well wanting to go on the social media apps.

696
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:48,875
Speaker 12:  I just wanna find out what time It is. But it's like I go to look at the

697
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:52,555
Speaker 12:  time and then I have a notification for Instagram. So I check that out and

698
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:56,395
Speaker 12:  then I'm scrolling the feed and then I'm liking things and

699
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:59,755
Speaker 12:  then I switch to another app and I'm scrolling that feed and it just sort

700
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:03,675
Speaker 12:  of like becomes this waterfall situation. And it

701
00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:06,755
Speaker 12:  all got started because I just wanted to know what time it was. Right. So

702
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:10,675
Speaker 12:  I think I realized the questions that I wanted to ask are like,

703
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:14,955
Speaker 12:  what are the essential functions? What am I trying to do with this thing?

704
00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:18,995
Speaker 12:  Which of the things are unique offerings to the smartphone

705
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:23,635
Speaker 12:  is another important question. Mapping technology that is in your pocket.

706
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:27,755
Speaker 12:  That is a thing that I think that it would be difficult to

707
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:31,395
Speaker 12:  excise from our lives at this point. But like the clock is not in there,

708
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:34,235
Speaker 12:  the clock doesn't have to be in there. The clock could be a watch. You know,

709
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:38,315
Speaker 12:  so there's a sort of like trying to back up

710
00:42:39,315 --> 00:42:43,295
Speaker 12:  and figure out what is truly additive about

711
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:47,215
Speaker 12:  the smartphone versus where has it inserted itself that

712
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:50,375
Speaker 12:  it doesn't need to be, was a crucial question for me in this.

713
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:52,895
Speaker 2:  Was that line pretty obvious for you as you went through it?

714
00:42:53,535 --> 00:42:56,695
Speaker 12:  I think so. I, I think honestly the browser app

715
00:42:57,685 --> 00:43:01,625
Speaker 12:  is on the line where it's like probably 80%

716
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:05,385
Speaker 12:  of the time I'm in the phones browser. I don't need to be. And

717
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:09,105
Speaker 12:  I'm just sort of like indulging a curiosity or like

718
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:09,865
Speaker 2:  Sure.

719
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:13,585
Speaker 12:  Logging into my email, but sometimes I do need it because it's like, oh,

720
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:18,665
Speaker 12:  I'm at a concert and I was emailed the tickets and I didn't print them

721
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:22,185
Speaker 12:  out and now I need to go into my email and get the tickets. So

722
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:26,705
Speaker 12:  I have to kind of hold the line at that point and be like, oh, I could

723
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:30,705
Speaker 12:  reinstall like an email app and have the whole thing on there. But

724
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:35,345
Speaker 12:  I try to keep a lot of my activity that used to be

725
00:43:35,345 --> 00:43:38,785
Speaker 12:  through apps in the browser. And then at least you are not

726
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:43,185
Speaker 12:  setting yourself up for notifications in any way.

727
00:43:43,865 --> 00:43:43,945
Speaker 12:  Hmm.

728
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:46,465
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. Yeah, I mean the, the browser is an interesting one to

729
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:50,395
Speaker 2:  me. 'cause I think the argument for it in a lot of cases

730
00:43:50,615 --> 00:43:53,955
Speaker 2:  is just, it's just a little more friction. Like, it's a little more annoying

731
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:58,395
Speaker 2:  to look at social media in a browser than It is in an app.

732
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:02,435
Speaker 2:  And that that's probably a good thing. Yes. And I think I buy that, but I

733
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:06,315
Speaker 2:  also, at least in my own life, have discovered that I'm

734
00:44:06,315 --> 00:44:10,195
Speaker 2:  perfectly willing to put up with that friction in order to stare at Twitter

735
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:13,635
Speaker 2:  on my phone. Like I, I was like, oh, I could use the app or I could use the

736
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:16,235
Speaker 2:  web app and then once I'm logged into the web app, it's not so much more

737
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:19,915
Speaker 2:  work that I can just, I'm just gonna go do it. And so I've struggled with

738
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,795
Speaker 2:  the same thing of like, the browser is, it does make my phone worse,

739
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:27,995
Speaker 2:  but I'm not convinced it makes me use my phone any less. But then

740
00:44:27,995 --> 00:44:31,925
Speaker 2:  without it I'm like, I, I feel lost. Whether that's real or not, I don't

741
00:44:31,925 --> 00:44:33,765
Speaker 2:  know. But I feel, yeah, I feel bad about it.

742
00:44:34,325 --> 00:44:38,205
Speaker 12:  I still try what I used to do pre-phone wipe, which is

743
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:42,085
Speaker 12:  what I did delete. I just did a factory reset on my

744
00:44:42,085 --> 00:44:45,885
Speaker 12:  phone and then tried to be like super, super, super discerning

745
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:49,845
Speaker 12:  about what I reinstalled and even like deleted everything that came on.

746
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:53,645
Speaker 12:  'cause it now comes with a ton of stuff. Yeah. And just tried to move it

747
00:44:53,645 --> 00:44:57,365
Speaker 12:  all away or, or delete the apps or whatever. What I used to do was

748
00:44:57,965 --> 00:45:01,925
Speaker 12:  I try and hide the apps in the other apps. Oh sure. Like

749
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:04,605
Speaker 12:  if I used an app too much, I would just like hold it down, drag it like

750
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:08,445
Speaker 12:  10 screens away and plop it there and be like, okay, now I can't find it.

751
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:11,725
Speaker 2:  And then at least you have to make yourself do like a hilarious amount of

752
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:14,965
Speaker 2:  work to go open the app. Yes. That comes for something. I, I like that. Or

753
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:16,725
Speaker 12:  You search, but like that's cheating.

754
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I, I I think you should turn all that stuff off. Tell me about

755
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,925
Speaker 2:  the factory reset thing. 'cause that's one thing you recommend that I have

756
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:26,605
Speaker 2:  not seen other people who have done this experience recommend.

757
00:45:26,745 --> 00:45:29,005
Speaker 2:  So why, why wipe the thing and start over?

758
00:45:29,345 --> 00:45:33,165
Speaker 12:  Yes. So another problem I had was, I would be like, I'm

759
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:36,885
Speaker 12:  too involved with apps. There are too many apps. They're doing notifications.

760
00:45:37,205 --> 00:45:40,445
Speaker 12:  I can't turn them all off 'cause I don't even, it's like you don't even

761
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,555
Speaker 12:  realize you're getting the notifications and they pop up and they go away

762
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:48,475
Speaker 12:  and you're like, who bothered me? I can't even remember. So I would try

763
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:52,075
Speaker 12:  and delete apps one by one, but I had

764
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:55,995
Speaker 12:  so many apps and then deleting them one by one did not work

765
00:45:56,025 --> 00:45:59,955
Speaker 12:  because every time I would be going through and be like,

766
00:45:59,955 --> 00:46:03,555
Speaker 12:  oh, do I really need to get rid of this? Like, it's not doing

767
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:07,235
Speaker 12:  anything. It's not hurting me. And then it would, you know, that would repeat

768
00:46:07,255 --> 00:46:11,035
Speaker 12:  for most of the apps and I would only delete like five of them. And it just

769
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:14,995
Speaker 12:  took so long. So I was like, I just need to start

770
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:17,395
Speaker 12:  over and let go of all of my

771
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:21,955
Speaker 12:  archaic apps that don't work anymore as well as the ones that are bothering

772
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:25,915
Speaker 12:  me. But I'm having trouble articulating like I

773
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:29,715
Speaker 12:  needed to, I needed tabular Raza, just like go back

774
00:46:29,715 --> 00:46:33,395
Speaker 12:  to zero and let things come back into my life as

775
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:37,195
Speaker 12:  needed. And being careful about what I let back in.

776
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:41,715
Speaker 12:  That's scary because also there will be apps

777
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,615
Speaker 12:  that have like data in them and you're not sure if

778
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:49,455
Speaker 12:  you like got everything out. So I did you

779
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:52,245
Speaker 12:  wanna do an number urgency backup

780
00:46:53,195 --> 00:46:57,165
Speaker 12:  just in case you do realize, oh shoot, I do have that app that I

781
00:46:57,165 --> 00:47:01,005
Speaker 12:  need things from and I didn't get everything out a bit. The one

782
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:04,765
Speaker 12:  that you really need to be careful about with this is if you have an authenticator

783
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:05,085
Speaker 12:  app.

784
00:47:05,545 --> 00:47:06,125
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah.

785
00:47:06,595 --> 00:47:10,125
Speaker 12:  Make sure you figure out how you're gonna set it up on your new phone

786
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:14,085
Speaker 12:  because it can, you can just get stuck I think with all of your

787
00:47:14,085 --> 00:47:17,925
Speaker 12:  accounts. So that's a big one. But everything else,

788
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:21,525
Speaker 12:  most things now are through the cloud. Like you have an account through

789
00:47:21,525 --> 00:47:25,285
Speaker 12:  the app and you just like log back into your account with whatever the app

790
00:47:25,285 --> 00:47:27,325
Speaker 12:  is and then everything you have is there.

791
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:31,125
Speaker 2:  One of the things you wrote that has stuck with me the most

792
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:35,645
Speaker 2:  is you like went out of your way to make your phone

793
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:39,405
Speaker 2:  worse. Which I think is really interesting. 'cause like for me, the thing

794
00:47:39,405 --> 00:47:42,205
Speaker 2:  I've always tried to do is like I put a picture of my kid on my home screen

795
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:46,125
Speaker 2:  as like a reminder that I should be looking at my kid and it's like,

796
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:48,445
Speaker 2:  this is, this is more important than my phone. And you're like, no, no, screw

797
00:47:48,445 --> 00:47:51,685
Speaker 2:  that. Make it like black and stupid so that you don't wanna look at it at

798
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:55,445
Speaker 2:  all. You, you made this switch from like, my phone is this sort of like charming

799
00:47:55,555 --> 00:47:58,765
Speaker 2:  companion that I have that reminds me of things to like, this thing is stupid

800
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:02,725
Speaker 2:  and boring and I hate it. Yes. And that, that shifting that mindset actually

801
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:06,285
Speaker 2:  ends up being really useful. Which I had never thought about. But now,

802
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:09,205
Speaker 2:  and people say this with like making your phone gray scale so that you don't

803
00:48:09,205 --> 00:48:12,365
Speaker 2:  wanna look at it and stuff. And like I have sort of mixed feelings about

804
00:48:12,365 --> 00:48:15,085
Speaker 2:  that. It like kind of works, but it also just makes everything kind of more

805
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:19,245
Speaker 2:  annoying without much upside in a lot of ways. But the idea

806
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:22,845
Speaker 2:  of like, what if I just made my phone worse actually strikes me as really

807
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:23,485
Speaker 2:  compelling.

808
00:48:23,995 --> 00:48:27,805
Speaker 12:  Okay. Yeah. I, yeah, the grayscale thing never really connected for me

809
00:48:28,145 --> 00:48:31,965
Speaker 12:  either. I definitely tried it at some point, but when people first discovered

810
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:35,935
Speaker 12:  it, when it was like a assistive technology thing

811
00:48:35,935 --> 00:48:39,695
Speaker 12:  maybe. So I remember that and it never, it was like, this doesn't really

812
00:48:39,695 --> 00:48:43,415
Speaker 12:  do anything. But yeah, some of these things come to me like as I'm

813
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:47,295
Speaker 12:  writing or just like in the middle of doing this. I think when I set up

814
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:51,255
Speaker 12:  this phone again, I was just like, sure, whatever, default home screen,

815
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:55,455
Speaker 12:  whatever you do. And then I realized, oh, the phone is

816
00:48:55,455 --> 00:48:59,295
Speaker 12:  really trying to endear itself to you with these like serving you

817
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:03,495
Speaker 12:  memories through the photos app. And like the, you know, my

818
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:07,015
Speaker 12:  husband has a, his home screen rotates through photos

819
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,615
Speaker 12:  that are I think are maybe curated by the photos app. And they're always

820
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:15,335
Speaker 12:  so cute. It's like our baby, our cat, our dog, the two of us.

821
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:19,015
Speaker 12:  Like, and it's, the way I put it in my article

822
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:22,935
Speaker 12:  was don't let it wear the skins of your loved ones. 'cause it's like,

823
00:49:23,635 --> 00:49:27,575
Speaker 12:  It is trying to manipulate you. They know what they're doing when

824
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:31,535
Speaker 12:  they, when they make the phone screen able to be all of your most cherished

825
00:49:31,855 --> 00:49:33,015
Speaker 12:  memories, you know? Yeah.

826
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:36,295
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Put those somewhere else. Yes. I think is a, is a, is a useful place

827
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:40,175
Speaker 2:  to be. And speaking of you, another thing you advocated for, and this is

828
00:49:40,255 --> 00:49:42,455
Speaker 2:  a thing I want to talk through a little bit, 'cause this is something I've

829
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:45,935
Speaker 2:  been sort of intermittently trying, is like, you set yourself up a second

830
00:49:46,555 --> 00:49:50,495
Speaker 2:  device or like a, and, and I think, I think if I have this right, you set

831
00:49:50,495 --> 00:49:54,335
Speaker 2:  up a device that is like always plugged in or like has a, has a

832
00:49:54,335 --> 00:49:57,935
Speaker 2:  place that it lives. And if you want to do some of this other stuff,

833
00:49:58,115 --> 00:50:01,855
Speaker 2:  you have to go to that place to do those things. Is that, am I characterizing

834
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,255
Speaker 2:  that right?

835
00:50:02,395 --> 00:50:06,375
Speaker 12:  Yes, that's correct. I mean, I, so the ideal second device I

836
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:09,215
Speaker 12:  think is a, is an old former phone.

837
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:14,055
Speaker 12:  Ideally one that has like no battery life left anymore so that you

838
00:50:14,055 --> 00:50:17,855
Speaker 12:  have to keep it plugged in. See, mine is actually, I keep it at

839
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:21,695
Speaker 12:  my desk, which you would think is bad, but it really, the phone is so

840
00:50:21,695 --> 00:50:24,055
Speaker 12:  useless. See now it's dead 'cause it wasn't plugged in.

841
00:50:26,155 --> 00:50:30,095
Speaker 12:  But you have a, a second device. This is a iPhone

842
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:34,495
Speaker 12:  11. Okay. Maybe. And you put all of your

843
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:38,415
Speaker 12:  problematic apps on there. So for me, one of my big

844
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:41,295
Speaker 12:  hesitations in going off social media was

845
00:50:42,605 --> 00:50:46,495
Speaker 12:  this is part of my job. Like I work in media, I post on

846
00:50:46,495 --> 00:50:50,095
Speaker 12:  Twitter. I post on Instagram, I have a lot of followers. How will, how will

847
00:50:50,095 --> 00:50:53,935
Speaker 12:  anyone know about what I do if I don't post? So

848
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:57,455
Speaker 12:  it was very scary to let go of both my

849
00:50:57,485 --> 00:51:01,055
Speaker 12:  ability to post when I felt like I needed to, and also to be able to

850
00:51:01,315 --> 00:51:05,185
Speaker 12:  scroll the feeds in order to see what other people are

851
00:51:05,185 --> 00:51:08,945
Speaker 12:  doing and like how I gotta be on the trends and all these things. So

852
00:51:09,535 --> 00:51:13,225
Speaker 12:  what would happen when I would try and delete, say Instagram from my regular

853
00:51:13,355 --> 00:51:17,235
Speaker 12:  phone is that eventually I would be like, oh,

854
00:51:17,235 --> 00:51:19,835
Speaker 12:  well I gotta redownload it 'cause I have to like message this person. And

855
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:23,955
Speaker 12:  Right. I'll just, you know, I'll just put it back on my phone and

856
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:27,955
Speaker 12:  log back in and then, and then you don't wanna delete it again. So what

857
00:51:27,995 --> 00:51:31,955
Speaker 12:  I did was put all of the problem apps on a different

858
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,715
Speaker 12:  phone and that made it, so if I had some

859
00:51:35,715 --> 00:51:38,995
Speaker 12:  sort of Instagram task that I thought I had to do,

860
00:51:39,995 --> 00:51:43,795
Speaker 12:  I would have to sit down in the

861
00:51:43,795 --> 00:51:47,555
Speaker 12:  phone spot with my phone. That only works.

862
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:51,395
Speaker 12:  I mean this because it has no sim card, it only works on wifi and

863
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:55,915
Speaker 12:  it would be a sort of discreet task in a location on a specific device.

864
00:51:56,855 --> 00:52:00,675
Speaker 12:  And what ended up happening was that I

865
00:52:00,675 --> 00:52:04,395
Speaker 12:  just sort of stopped posting. Like I, I, it

866
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:08,435
Speaker 12:  completely did away for me the temptation because most of the scrolling

867
00:52:08,435 --> 00:52:12,315
Speaker 12:  I did, I think honestly was not, I do a lot of scrolling at home,

868
00:52:12,855 --> 00:52:16,795
Speaker 12:  but removing it from the couch where I usually do it or

869
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:20,435
Speaker 12:  like in in bed before I go to bed, or when I wake up in the morning

870
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:24,555
Speaker 12:  and having it be in a specific, somewhat uncomfortable location

871
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:28,755
Speaker 12:  or a location where, like at my desk I'm usually kind of busy doing other

872
00:52:28,755 --> 00:52:32,585
Speaker 12:  stuff that broke the pattern for me at

873
00:52:32,585 --> 00:52:36,225
Speaker 12:  least. And I was never really tempted to reinstall

874
00:52:36,225 --> 00:52:39,425
Speaker 12:  Instagram when I knew it was already installed and logged in and everything

875
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:43,065
Speaker 12:  on this phone that's like usually only 10 to 40 feet

876
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,905
Speaker 12:  away from wherever I am in my house. 'cause my house isn't that big. So

877
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:51,305
Speaker 12:  I was able to just offload that little piece of

878
00:52:51,305 --> 00:52:55,065
Speaker 12:  like, mental weight onto this other device. Yeah.

879
00:52:55,065 --> 00:52:57,665
Speaker 12:  That's really smart. And now the result has been that I barely use this

880
00:52:57,665 --> 00:52:59,585
Speaker 12:  phone Yeah. At all. So,

881
00:52:59,595 --> 00:53:03,145
Speaker 2:  Which is, I would argue the correct outcome. I've, I've tried offloading

882
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:07,265
Speaker 2:  all that stuff to an iPad at, at various

883
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:07,945
Speaker 2:  points, which works.

884
00:53:08,175 --> 00:53:10,465
Speaker 12:  I've heard of people doing the tablet. Yeah. It

885
00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:14,145
Speaker 2:  Works for everything except social media apps because social media, like

886
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:17,865
Speaker 2:  those apps are trash on iPads, which is a problem. I've also tried to do

887
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:21,425
Speaker 2:  it on my computer, which kind of works and sort of applies to that same like,

888
00:53:21,425 --> 00:53:25,145
Speaker 2:  it's in a place thing. But I really like the idea of just having a, having

889
00:53:25,365 --> 00:53:29,205
Speaker 2:  a problem phone that like lives far away from where I normally am.

890
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:32,725
Speaker 2:  Yes. When I, or and, and that's, I, I like this a lot. But the, the social

891
00:53:32,725 --> 00:53:35,845
Speaker 2:  media thing is one of the things I wanted to ask you about because I feel

892
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,805
Speaker 2:  like the, the through line of a lot of the stuff you've written about this

893
00:53:38,825 --> 00:53:42,805
Speaker 2:  is that kind of quitting your phone and quitting social media,

894
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,525
Speaker 2:  I think are ki like, were like kind of the same thing in your experience

895
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:50,365
Speaker 2:  or at least like fed each other in a really interesting way. Like if you

896
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:52,445
Speaker 2:  quit social media, have you effectively quit your phone?

897
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:56,275
Speaker 12:  Well, it's like what do you do on your phone that is

898
00:53:56,425 --> 00:53:59,515
Speaker 12:  problematic and addictive? That's not social media.

899
00:54:00,895 --> 00:54:04,795
Speaker 12:  You could one, one could do, you know, I don't know, you could be

900
00:54:04,795 --> 00:54:08,475
Speaker 12:  really invested in like Clash of Clans or something. Sure, yeah. If

901
00:54:08,475 --> 00:54:11,595
Speaker 12:  you're like spending a lot of money and like a lot of hours and

902
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:15,995
Speaker 12:  trying to accumulate resources on there. But that's not the problem

903
00:54:16,435 --> 00:54:20,315
Speaker 12:  I have. I think for me they're pretty one to one. What

904
00:54:20,365 --> 00:54:24,275
Speaker 12:  draws you in is on your phone is the question. For me, it was a lot of

905
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:27,795
Speaker 12:  social media, but it wasn't always, sometimes what draws me in is like a

906
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:31,155
Speaker 12:  New York Times push alert, which they treat very

907
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:35,225
Speaker 12:  irresponsibly sometimes it's really breaking news. Every

908
00:54:35,385 --> 00:54:37,025
Speaker 2:  C list actor who dies. Yeah.

909
00:54:37,895 --> 00:54:41,585
Speaker 12:  Sometimes it's breaking news and sometimes it's like a recipe and it's like,

910
00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:45,785
Speaker 12:  okay, come on. And I, I'm susceptible to the recipe,

911
00:54:46,285 --> 00:54:50,145
Speaker 12:  you know, so this is like how they get you

912
00:54:50,845 --> 00:54:54,305
Speaker 12:  is that you turn on the push alerts because what if

913
00:54:54,985 --> 00:54:58,585
Speaker 12:  I miss something? What if breaking news happens

914
00:54:59,365 --> 00:55:02,705
Speaker 12:  and I am not aware of it? And then you have to leave them on and then you're

915
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:05,625
Speaker 12:  getting the recipes and you're getting the breaking news. So it's like,

916
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:10,005
Speaker 12:  I think part of the what had to be let go

917
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:13,765
Speaker 12:  was the notion of like, if there's breaking news, if

918
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:18,685
Speaker 12:  I will find out in a way that's not like gonna

919
00:55:19,005 --> 00:55:19,325
Speaker 12:  ultimately

920
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:24,965
Speaker 12:  hamper me in my life, like what could I find out from my phone

921
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:28,685
Speaker 12:  that I need to know right this second that I won't find out eventually.

922
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:32,685
Speaker 12:  And that was difficult for me coming from a news background as I'm sure

923
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:36,645
Speaker 12:  you also feel where it's like, you feel like you gotta

924
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:39,605
Speaker 12:  know everything as soon as possible because you gotta like come up with

925
00:55:39,605 --> 00:55:43,285
Speaker 12:  your takes or whatever. And not everyone's in that position and I'm not

926
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:46,605
Speaker 12:  in that position anymore. I think we've gotten to the point where we feel

927
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:50,405
Speaker 12:  like, well if we can know as soon as possible we should. And that is not

928
00:55:50,405 --> 00:55:54,325
Speaker 12:  true at all. And I think, no, I've tried to encourage more people lately

929
00:55:55,025 --> 00:55:58,875
Speaker 12:  to at least consider trying, seeing

930
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:02,475
Speaker 12:  what it's like if you don't find out about

931
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:05,395
Speaker 12:  everything right away. It feels problematic to

932
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:09,875
Speaker 12:  encourage people to know less in our world right now.

933
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:14,235
Speaker 12:  And I understand the objections to that, but I think

934
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:18,395
Speaker 12:  you should feel encouraged to control that

935
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:21,315
Speaker 12:  flow a little bit more. And you might not realize

936
00:56:22,495 --> 00:56:26,195
Speaker 12:  how much, you still know how much you'll still be apprised of what's going

937
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:29,435
Speaker 12:  on without feeling like you need to be like an open,

938
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:34,595
Speaker 12:  just like lying back and letting everything like wash over

939
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:35,755
Speaker 12:  you constantly. Right.

940
00:56:36,335 --> 00:56:40,005
Speaker 2:  Which I think is pretty clearly a and not necessary for

941
00:56:40,075 --> 00:56:43,525
Speaker 2:  most people. And b, not healthy. Like, it just

942
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:47,245
Speaker 2:  overwhelmingly the feeling I get is that like the, the thing where we all

943
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:50,125
Speaker 2:  feel like we need to know everything immediately all the time. It is just,

944
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:53,285
Speaker 2:  it's just bad. Yes. Like it's just unhealthy in ways that I think we're only

945
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,725
Speaker 2:  beginning to fully understand.

946
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:58,765
Speaker 12:  Right. Right. It's like you can take seriously all

947
00:56:58,765 --> 00:57:01,885
Speaker 12:  of the data that's come out on this and the research, it's like,

948
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:06,285
Speaker 12:  and there have not been a lot of redeeming studies

949
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:10,365
Speaker 12:  science about screens and like social media.

950
00:57:11,185 --> 00:57:15,085
Speaker 12:  And I think we can, you know, even what I'm describing is not like

951
00:57:16,005 --> 00:57:19,445
Speaker 12:  throwing the entire thing in the trash and like living in the woods. Like

952
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:22,765
Speaker 12:  you're still in the, in the world and you're still gonna get information,

953
00:57:22,785 --> 00:57:26,125
Speaker 12:  but you're allowed to control that relationship.

954
00:57:27,025 --> 00:57:30,445
Speaker 12:  You should feel empowered to control it a little bit more.

955
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:34,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think that's, I think that's exactly right. How long did that adjustment

956
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:38,605
Speaker 2:  take for you? Because I think the, the struggle I've had candidly

957
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:42,485
Speaker 2:  is like, I will, I will try these things. I'll run the experiment and it

958
00:57:42,485 --> 00:57:46,405
Speaker 2:  feels really bad for three days and like weird.

959
00:57:46,465 --> 00:57:49,405
Speaker 2:  And I'm like, okay, I'm not actually solving any problems here, am I? Maybe

960
00:57:49,405 --> 00:57:52,565
Speaker 2:  this is just, maybe I'm not doing anything better here. I'll just go back

961
00:57:52,565 --> 00:57:56,125
Speaker 2:  to installing all my apps. It'll be fine. And like somehow I end up on Reddit

962
00:57:56,125 --> 00:58:00,005
Speaker 2:  again. You know what I mean? So I'm like, what, what did it

963
00:58:00,005 --> 00:58:03,045
Speaker 2:  take for you to kind of get through that first hurdle? Was there even that

964
00:58:03,045 --> 00:58:03,525
Speaker 2:  first hurdle?

965
00:58:03,995 --> 00:58:07,525
Speaker 12:  Yeah, there definitely was a hurdle. I

966
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:11,085
Speaker 12:  remember in the first few days, like so many moments of

967
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:14,685
Speaker 12:  experiencing some like mild discomfort of

968
00:58:15,585 --> 00:58:18,605
Speaker 12:  I'm not being entertained right now. I'm like in the line at the grocery

969
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:22,605
Speaker 12:  store or I'm like, you know, I was, I think I was at a basketball game

970
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:25,565
Speaker 12:  and nothing was happening in the basketball game. And I was like, well,

971
00:58:25,565 --> 00:58:29,365
Speaker 12:  I'm gonna pull up my phone and scroll Instagram. Oh wait, it's not there.

972
00:58:29,945 --> 00:58:32,565
Speaker 2:  Did you do a lot of picking up your phone and realizing you had picked it

973
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:33,965
Speaker 2:  up for absolutely no reason? Yes.

974
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:37,405
Speaker 12:  Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. I was pulling it out and looking at it and opening

975
00:58:37,405 --> 00:58:39,905
Speaker 12:  it and being like, there's nothing here.

976
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,305
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Those are the moments I feel like a true lunatic where I'm like, I,

977
00:58:43,305 --> 00:58:46,905
Speaker 2:  this is for nothing. I just, this is a pure like addictive response that

978
00:58:46,945 --> 00:58:49,705
Speaker 2:  I just had. Yes. To grab my phone that didn't make a noise and has nothing

979
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:51,785
Speaker 2:  for me. No, but I'm just looking at it now.

980
00:58:52,025 --> 00:58:55,745
Speaker 12:  Yep. Oh yeah. It feels bad. And it's also like,

981
00:58:56,465 --> 00:59:00,235
Speaker 12:  there's the, there's the pit of like, oh, well what am I gonna do now?

982
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:04,875
Speaker 12:  I have nothing to do. Which is like, we used to

983
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,835
Speaker 12:  live, like you and I are old enough to remember, you

984
00:59:08,835 --> 00:59:12,675
Speaker 12:  know, there are people who have not lived in a world, this makes me

985
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:17,515
Speaker 12:  feel so sad and crazy. There are people who are like adults,

986
00:59:17,545 --> 00:59:20,355
Speaker 12:  full adults now who have never lived in a world without smartphones.

987
00:59:20,445 --> 00:59:23,645
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. We're both in our nineties now. Yes. Just so everyone

988
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:27,165
Speaker 12:  Know, we're a hundred years old and we remember the Telegraph. So It is

989
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:31,125
Speaker 12:  like, you know, this has been a lot of change for us, but seriously, we

990
00:59:31,525 --> 00:59:35,205
Speaker 12:  remember being, you know, if you were, if you had nothing to do, you just

991
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:39,085
Speaker 12:  sat there, you know, which feels silly to say or you just sort of

992
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,645
Speaker 12:  watched what was going on around you. So that was part of my, like

993
00:59:42,985 --> 00:59:46,965
Speaker 12:  rehabilitation too was like, I mean, especially for me, I

994
00:59:46,965 --> 00:59:50,845
Speaker 12:  work from home, so I have a lot of control over my schedule

995
00:59:51,105 --> 00:59:54,605
Speaker 12:  and like where I go in a way. But that also means that

996
00:59:55,585 --> 00:59:58,805
Speaker 12:  I'm not even like in the world that much. So when I get to be out in the

997
00:59:58,805 --> 01:00:02,165
Speaker 12:  world, I try to be like, you know what? I'm out in the world. Be in the

998
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,765
Speaker 12:  world. Don't be on your phone.

999
01:00:04,075 --> 01:00:06,205
Speaker 2:  What do you do when you're waiting in line at the grocery store? Now?

1000
01:00:07,095 --> 01:00:10,215
Speaker 12:  I look around, I watch people, you know, see,

1001
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:13,735
Speaker 2:  This is the problem. I honestly, this is, this is gonna really make me sound

1002
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,855
Speaker 2:  like a terrible person. But I hate that answer. Like, there's just something

1003
01:00:17,055 --> 01:00:19,735
Speaker 2:  about that that is like, there's so many things where I'm like, okay. I'm

1004
01:00:19,735 --> 01:00:23,455
Speaker 2:  like, I should be hanging out with my family instead of

1005
01:00:23,805 --> 01:00:27,415
Speaker 2:  looking at my phone. Fully agree. I should be driving instead of looking

1006
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,655
Speaker 2:  at my phone. Fully agree. Right. Like there's a million things where I think

1007
01:00:29,655 --> 01:00:32,575
Speaker 2:  It is like an unequivocally good thing, but then I'm like, is It, is it okay

1008
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:36,215
Speaker 2:  to look at my phone while I'm standing in line at Starbucks? Like

1009
01:00:37,195 --> 01:00:40,975
Speaker 2:  intellectually no. But like also, yes, I don't know.

1010
01:00:41,435 --> 01:00:43,815
Speaker 2:  And, and this is, this is where I'm like, okay, well I'll just keep this

1011
01:00:43,815 --> 01:00:46,615
Speaker 2:  one app on my phone just to look at while I'm in line at the grocery store.

1012
01:00:46,635 --> 01:00:49,455
Speaker 2:  And then the whole thing falls apart. So it's like, maybe you do just have

1013
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:52,935
Speaker 2:  to draw the line somewhere past in line at the grocery store.

1014
01:00:53,435 --> 01:00:56,745
Speaker 2:  But I don't know, like it's, it's so boring waiting in line.

1015
01:00:57,095 --> 01:00:57,385
Speaker 12:  Well,

1016
01:00:57,385 --> 01:00:58,505
Speaker 2:  I mean, we solved that problem.

1017
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:02,625
Speaker 12:  I think that's great. Yes. So part of the problem is like, you're just like,

1018
01:01:02,685 --> 01:01:06,575
Speaker 12:  I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored. What do I do if I'm bored? I need, I need,

1019
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:10,495
Speaker 12:  I, I can't be bored. And, but I think you do need to

1020
01:01:10,495 --> 01:01:14,315
Speaker 12:  be bored. I think I found like

1021
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:18,315
Speaker 12:  even just doing a couple sessions of pre deleting everything

1022
01:01:18,315 --> 01:01:22,125
Speaker 12:  from my phone where I would be like, I'm gonna just like hard

1023
01:01:22,155 --> 01:01:25,885
Speaker 12:  line, put my phone down, go outside without my phone

1024
01:01:26,545 --> 01:01:30,325
Speaker 12:  and just sit there and just sit there and

1025
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:34,245
Speaker 12:  just like, try and be without my phone for like 30 minutes and be without

1026
01:01:34,485 --> 01:01:38,365
Speaker 12:  anything. Be don't, don't be entertained. You know? And I would do

1027
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:42,005
Speaker 12:  that and at first it would be like, you know, something could be happening

1028
01:01:42,025 --> 01:01:45,045
Speaker 12:  on my phone right now and I don't know about it. Yeah. And this is very

1029
01:01:45,045 --> 01:01:48,725
Speaker 12:  uncomfortable. But then after I sat there for 10,

1030
01:01:48,725 --> 01:01:52,005
Speaker 12:  15 minutes and it would get to like 45 minutes, it'd be like, okay, I'm

1031
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:54,045
Speaker 12:  having like literally so many thoughts.

1032
01:01:56,025 --> 01:01:57,605
Speaker 2:  You kind of forget what it's like. Yeah.

1033
01:01:58,145 --> 01:02:02,085
Speaker 12:  I'm thinking of so many things. Having, I, for me, having

1034
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:05,885
Speaker 12:  ideas is huge. I need idea. My, my business thrives on

1035
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:09,765
Speaker 12:  ideas, you know, having so many ideas and it

1036
01:02:09,765 --> 01:02:13,605
Speaker 12:  sounds stupid, but like that's sort of the point is that it's not

1037
01:02:13,885 --> 01:02:17,505
Speaker 12:  supposed to either sound awesome or

1038
01:02:17,615 --> 01:02:21,445
Speaker 12:  like legible even to anyone but me. I'm just

1039
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:25,125
Speaker 12:  like having an experience. I'm in my own head

1040
01:02:26,085 --> 01:02:29,765
Speaker 12:  thinking about stuff. Like, I think we need that time to sort of like,

1041
01:02:30,275 --> 01:02:33,005
Speaker 12:  it's almost like what sleep does for us, where it's like we need time to

1042
01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:36,725
Speaker 12:  sort of like, let the thoughts tumble. It's like a, what are those things?

1043
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:40,285
Speaker 12:  Like a rock, like a rock Tumblr. Sure. It's, it's sort of, we're putting

1044
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:44,365
Speaker 12:  the, the raw craggy rocks in and smoothing 'em out just by

1045
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:48,245
Speaker 12:  giving them time to roll around in there. And I think we

1046
01:02:48,245 --> 01:02:52,085
Speaker 12:  need that some time to just sort of let our eyes go out of

1047
01:02:52,085 --> 01:02:56,005
Speaker 12:  focus and just have that time. So that, that

1048
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,405
Speaker 12:  was like a useful experiment. I think at one point was to

1049
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:03,525
Speaker 12:  allow myself in a comfortable place. Like I was in my own home,

1050
01:03:04,145 --> 01:03:05,765
Speaker 12:  not in a grocery line. I

1051
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:08,485
Speaker 2:  Feel like you're describing like your first acid trip where you're like,

1052
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:10,205
Speaker 2:  I had, I had a, I had a spiritual guy.

1053
01:03:11,275 --> 01:03:15,005
Speaker 12:  It's like, honestly not that different from, from that where it's like,

1054
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:18,805
Speaker 12:  oh, there are you, your brain. There's so much going on in there

1055
01:03:18,825 --> 01:03:21,205
Speaker 12:  and you don't realize. 'cause you're always trying to like push it down

1056
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:24,565
Speaker 12:  with everything that's going on in your phone. That,

1057
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:28,725
Speaker 12:  I don't know, there were just, it was like I had a backlog of stuff to sort

1058
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:32,525
Speaker 12:  of percolate. That's how it felt. I was like, oh, I've so much to think

1059
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:35,285
Speaker 12:  about that I haven't gotten a chance to think about. And like, how am I

1060
01:03:35,285 --> 01:03:39,125
Speaker 12:  gonna, I don't know, do this thing or what should

1061
01:03:39,165 --> 01:03:42,605
Speaker 12:  I, how should I approach this like, topic or,

1062
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:46,205
Speaker 12:  oh, I forgot this person said this thing to me that was crazy. What do,

1063
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:48,485
Speaker 12:  what really did I think about that? 'cause it happened sort of in passing

1064
01:03:48,505 --> 01:03:50,445
Speaker 12:  and I didn't have time to sort of process it.

1065
01:03:52,425 --> 01:03:56,345
Speaker 12:  So I recall that feeling pretty, pretty vividly. So I think if

1066
01:03:56,345 --> 01:03:59,905
Speaker 12:  you like, are interested in experimenting with this, that might be a good

1067
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:03,585
Speaker 12:  thing to try is like, put your phone away, separate

1068
01:04:04,025 --> 01:04:07,905
Speaker 12:  yourself from it for, you don't have to do a really length, big

1069
01:04:07,905 --> 01:04:11,785
Speaker 12:  length of time. You could do like 15 minutes or something and just sort

1070
01:04:11,785 --> 01:04:15,625
Speaker 12:  of give yourself a little space and see what happens. See what

1071
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:16,985
Speaker 12:  comes from that.

1072
01:04:17,495 --> 01:04:20,785
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's a good one. How long did it take before you stopped checking

1073
01:04:20,785 --> 01:04:22,585
Speaker 2:  your phone? When nothing was going on?

1074
01:04:22,855 --> 01:04:26,585
Speaker 12:  Okay, good question. I think it was three days. Sounds

1075
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:30,465
Speaker 12:  kind of like, okay, a good, that, that feels

1076
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:34,305
Speaker 12:  about right in terms of like how long it took to stop, like

1077
01:04:34,855 --> 01:04:38,825
Speaker 12:  pulling it out of my pocket as a reflex. But I think

1078
01:04:38,865 --> 01:04:42,145
Speaker 12:  I can like, just, just because it makes you feel so dumb to do so.

1079
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:46,705
Speaker 12:  But I think I still felt that discomfort and urge of like, I'm,

1080
01:04:46,985 --> 01:04:50,865
Speaker 12:  I am like bored and I wish I had something

1081
01:04:50,865 --> 01:04:52,545
Speaker 12:  to do and I have nothing to do. Hmm.

1082
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:58,535
Speaker 12:  And that took a little longer. I don't know.

1083
01:04:59,015 --> 01:05:02,855
Speaker 12:  I think I still feel that way sometimes. So It is like a kind of

1084
01:05:04,175 --> 01:05:08,015
Speaker 12:  boundary you have to have with yourself in a way. Like when we

1085
01:05:08,015 --> 01:05:11,775
Speaker 12:  have, there's just always, we're so used to having a lever to pull,

1086
01:05:11,915 --> 01:05:15,855
Speaker 12:  to entertain us and take us out of ourselves. So it's kind of

1087
01:05:15,855 --> 01:05:19,565
Speaker 12:  like an active ongoing negotiation.

1088
01:05:20,245 --> 01:05:24,125
Speaker 12:  I can tell you from my life experience that I've

1089
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:27,085
Speaker 12:  gotten a lot out of trying to

1090
01:05:28,565 --> 01:05:32,465
Speaker 12:  be more deliberate about those types of patterns. Hmm. It is a

1091
01:05:32,465 --> 01:05:36,385
Speaker 12:  pattern that is deserving of your like attention and

1092
01:05:36,385 --> 01:05:40,185
Speaker 12:  energy. I think, I think if you do give yourself the space

1093
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:44,505
Speaker 12:  to stay with yourself in those moments, you will find

1094
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:48,385
Speaker 12:  it pays off. You know, if you love using your phone and you don't have

1095
01:05:48,385 --> 01:05:52,345
Speaker 12:  a held healthy relationship with it, then it's like, fine, go be yourself.

1096
01:05:52,975 --> 01:05:56,825
Speaker 12:  This is for me who has an unhealthy relationship

1097
01:05:56,825 --> 01:05:59,465
Speaker 12:  with it. Right. And for anyone else who does, who wants it to be different,

1098
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:00,105
Speaker 12:  you know? Yeah.

1099
01:06:00,235 --> 01:06:04,145
Speaker 2:  Which is, that's, I'm, I am also very much one of those people. Yeah.

1100
01:06:04,225 --> 01:06:07,905
Speaker 2:  I think for me it's, it's, I, the factory reset thing is very compelling

1101
01:06:07,905 --> 01:06:11,185
Speaker 2:  that I'm like, maybe it's just I'm just gonna do a full start over

1102
01:06:12,005 --> 01:06:15,945
Speaker 2:  and just see how far I could get. And that feels like, because the, the

1103
01:06:15,945 --> 01:06:19,305
Speaker 2:  next phase in my own journey, I've like, I've hit the point now where I,

1104
01:06:19,345 --> 01:06:22,425
Speaker 2:  I charge my phone in a room that isn't my bedroom, which is itself a victory.

1105
01:06:22,815 --> 01:06:25,745
Speaker 2:  Okay. Good, good, good first step. Very much enjoying that. Very good. And

1106
01:06:25,745 --> 01:06:28,225
Speaker 2:  the next step was like, what if I just delete all of my apps? And now I'm

1107
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:30,465
Speaker 2:  like, nevermind, I'm just gonna factory reset my phone and start from there.

1108
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:33,025
Speaker 2:  Because actually it'll, it'll feel better that way.

1109
01:06:33,295 --> 01:06:36,785
Speaker 12:  What else have you tried? I think I saw you tried the light phone. Maybe

1110
01:06:37,135 --> 01:06:40,265
Speaker 2:  I've tried the light phone. That, that one's tricky because for like a bunch

1111
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:43,985
Speaker 2:  of wireless carrier reasons, I can't just like put my number on the phone

1112
01:06:44,005 --> 01:06:46,425
Speaker 2:  and then iMessage a break and it would be a whole thing. Yeah. So I can't

1113
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:49,785
Speaker 2:  fully commit to the light phone life, even though I think it's actually,

1114
01:06:49,945 --> 01:06:51,425
Speaker 2:  it's like very close to being,

1115
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:54,345
Speaker 12:  Yeah. See, this is the problem is that they're all just like a little bit

1116
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:56,465
Speaker 12:  Yeah. Off in significant ways.

1117
01:06:56,775 --> 01:06:59,625
Speaker 2:  It's like two apps away from being the right thing for me. But those two

1118
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:00,745
Speaker 2:  apps turn out to be very important.

1119
01:07:02,465 --> 01:07:06,185
Speaker 2:  I think that for me, it's actually very funny. So I, I am perpetually like

1120
01:07:06,495 --> 01:07:09,825
Speaker 2:  needing to test new phones and as you were talking about the second phone

1121
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:13,025
Speaker 2:  idea, I'm like, oh, I'm gonna keep the iPhone as my like normal phone. And

1122
01:07:13,025 --> 01:07:16,465
Speaker 2:  then I'm gonna just like cycle in Android phones as my like problem apps

1123
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,545
Speaker 2:  phone. Okay. And this actually solves a bunch of like, work problems for

1124
01:07:19,545 --> 01:07:23,265
Speaker 2:  me. Okay, good. While also meaning I just like take

1125
01:07:23,265 --> 01:07:26,705
Speaker 2:  Instagram off of my phone and put it somewhere else. There you go. The thing

1126
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:30,705
Speaker 2:  I, I just like an hour before we got on here, bought the

1127
01:07:30,705 --> 01:07:33,705
Speaker 2:  brick. I don't know if you've seen this, the, the thing. So it's like a little

1128
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:38,185
Speaker 2:  NFC device and you tap your phone on it and it locks you out of everything.

1129
01:07:38,285 --> 01:07:41,265
Speaker 2:  Oh my God. Except the apps that you've decided are allowed and you have to

1130
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:44,545
Speaker 2:  go back to it to unlock it. Okay. And I think there's like, there's something

1131
01:07:44,545 --> 01:07:47,585
Speaker 2:  very powerful in that to me that it's like, have you ever been to the concert

1132
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:50,225
Speaker 2:  where you get like the, the yonder case that they put your phone in?

1133
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:53,185
Speaker 12:  I've heard of this. Or they have them for like schools now I think too.

1134
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:53,505
Speaker 12:  Right?

1135
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:57,305
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So I got, I, the only time I've had it happen was at a John Mullaney

1136
01:07:57,305 --> 01:08:00,425
Speaker 2:  show. For some reason John Mullaney, like didn't want us to record him doing

1137
01:08:00,425 --> 01:08:01,105
Speaker 2:  his. Oh, right,

1138
01:08:01,105 --> 01:08:01,225
Speaker 12:  Yes.

1139
01:08:01,925 --> 01:08:05,745
Speaker 2:  And so they put it in the bag and I was sitting there holding the bag and

1140
01:08:05,745 --> 01:08:09,065
Speaker 2:  at first I was like mad at the bag, but by the end of the concert I was like,

1141
01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:12,945
Speaker 2:  this is great. Like, I have the thing that actively prevents me, like a person

1142
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:16,325
Speaker 2:  has to allow me to use my phone again. And there was something wonderful

1143
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:19,445
Speaker 2:  about that. So I'm like, how can I outsource this

1144
01:08:19,715 --> 01:08:22,565
Speaker 2:  challenge a little bit? Yeah. And that's, that's the next thing on my list.

1145
01:08:22,585 --> 01:08:24,165
Speaker 2:  So we'll, we'll see how that one goes for me.

1146
01:08:24,355 --> 01:08:27,845
Speaker 12:  Okay. The brick. I'm gonna have to look into this. Yeah. I've like opened

1147
01:08:28,345 --> 01:08:32,205
Speaker 12:  the page for the light phone and like the books, various

1148
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:35,365
Speaker 12:  books, devices so many times being like, is this the answer?

1149
01:08:36,385 --> 01:08:40,245
Speaker 12:  And I think ultimately I was like, it just isn't. Or I think

1150
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:44,005
Speaker 12:  it will have issues along the lines of like, maps, maps don't work

1151
01:08:44,145 --> 01:08:47,685
Speaker 12:  or you can't transfer your phone number or something. And then that's always,

1152
01:08:47,685 --> 01:08:50,805
Speaker 12:  that's such a killer. It's, or or like with a flip phone too, it's like,

1153
01:08:50,845 --> 01:08:54,765
Speaker 12:  I would love to just have a flip phone again. But then it breaks too

1154
01:08:54,765 --> 01:08:58,365
Speaker 12:  many things about how we live our lives now I feel like. All right.

1155
01:08:58,365 --> 01:09:00,605
Speaker 2:  I gotta let you go here, but plug your book and then we're gonna go.

1156
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:04,045
Speaker 12:  Oh yes. Okay. So I have a book coming out next month. It's called A Physical

1157
01:09:04,045 --> 01:09:07,365
Speaker 12:  Education. Please Buy It. It's really good. If you've ever thought about

1158
01:09:07,365 --> 01:09:10,925
Speaker 12:  like, if you've, if you've ever hated your relationship with

1159
01:09:11,245 --> 01:09:15,045
Speaker 12:  exercise or food or your body, this book is for you. I promise.

1160
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:19,485
Speaker 12:  It will, it will be very, it'll be satisfying to read I

1161
01:09:19,485 --> 01:09:23,085
Speaker 12:  think in a lot of ways for somebody like that, which

1162
01:09:23,135 --> 01:09:25,765
Speaker 12:  might be a lot of your listeners or, so I hope

1163
01:09:26,145 --> 01:09:29,925
Speaker 2:  It, it's, I I suspect so. Yeah, we'll put the link in the show notes.

1164
01:09:29,925 --> 01:09:31,285
Speaker 2:  Casey, thank you. This is so much fun.

1165
01:09:31,435 --> 01:09:32,605
Speaker 12:  Yeah, thanks for having me.

1166
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:36,245
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

1167
01:09:36,245 --> 01:09:40,045
Speaker 2:  take a question from The Vergecast hotline. It's about laptops and It

1168
01:09:40,265 --> 01:09:43,565
Speaker 2:  is causing me a lot of feelings. We'll get into it. We'll be right back.

1169
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:20,245
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, let's get to a question from The Vergecast hotline

1170
01:11:20,465 --> 01:11:23,805
Speaker 2:  as always. The number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. You can email Vergecast at

1171
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:27,565
Speaker 2:  The Verge dot com. We love all of your questions. Antonio de Benedetto is

1172
01:11:27,565 --> 01:11:29,285
Speaker 2:  here to help me with this one. Hi Antonio.

1173
01:11:29,935 --> 01:11:30,285
Speaker 17:  Hello.

1174
01:11:31,005 --> 01:11:34,925
Speaker 2:  I I have a question for you that I think seems easy but is

1175
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:37,805
Speaker 2:  going to be sneakily complicated and may take us a very long time to come

1176
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:41,325
Speaker 2:  to an answer. It's from our email. Lemme just read it. It comes from

1177
01:11:41,725 --> 01:11:45,445
Speaker 2:  rab. It says, I'm usually the gadget recommendation guy amongst my friends

1178
01:11:45,445 --> 01:11:49,405
Speaker 2:  and family. And I'm also a Mac user. The MacBook Air has been my go-to laptop

1179
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:52,325
Speaker 2:  recommendation for years, but some of my friends insist on having Windows.

1180
01:11:52,925 --> 01:11:55,885
Speaker 2:  I was wondering if there's any consensus at The Verge about what the go-to

1181
01:11:55,955 --> 01:11:59,645
Speaker 2:  rock solid Windows laptop recommendation is. Is it surface? Is it whatever

1182
01:11:59,645 --> 01:12:03,485
Speaker 2:  Dell is calling their XPS line Now? Is it an HP Envy? Is it semi

1183
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:06,965
Speaker 2:  seus? I have no idea. Antonio. I also have no idea.

1184
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:10,245
Speaker 2:  I realize this reading, this email, I literally don't know even where to

1185
01:12:10,245 --> 01:12:13,725
Speaker 2:  start with this question. So let's, you're you're here to help. Let's, let's

1186
01:12:13,725 --> 01:12:14,445
Speaker 2:  help sir here.

1187
01:12:14,835 --> 01:12:18,365
Speaker 17:  Yeah, I'm happy to help. It's unfortunately a more complicated

1188
01:12:18,785 --> 01:12:22,765
Speaker 17:  answer than it should be. But the good news is there are a lot of

1189
01:12:22,765 --> 01:12:26,605
Speaker 17:  good answers. Okay. It's just that there's no good answer for like everyone

1190
01:12:26,605 --> 01:12:27,885
Speaker 17:  like there is with the MacBook gar.

1191
01:12:28,185 --> 01:12:31,045
Speaker 2:  No, I reject this premise. We're not doing this. No, no, no, no, no. You

1192
01:12:31,045 --> 01:12:34,125
Speaker 2:  can't, you can't do the thing where you're like, okay, I'm gonna ask you

1193
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:37,445
Speaker 2:  a thousand follow up questions. We, we have to arrive at, at an answer at

1194
01:12:37,445 --> 01:12:40,005
Speaker 2:  the end of this. And I think this is a useful exercise, honestly, because

1195
01:12:40,545 --> 01:12:43,445
Speaker 2:  for a long time it was just the XPS 13, right? Like it's would you agree

1196
01:12:43,445 --> 01:12:46,245
Speaker 2:  with that? That for a bunch of years it was like, if you just want a very

1197
01:12:46,525 --> 01:12:49,205
Speaker 2:  good Windows laptop, and I don't have to ask you any follow up questions,

1198
01:12:49,395 --> 01:12:50,645
Speaker 2:  it's probably the XPS 13,

1199
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:55,205
Speaker 17:  I think for a while it was, and then they ruined the keyboard. And I think

1200
01:12:55,445 --> 01:12:59,245
Speaker 17:  a keyboard is kind of important for a laptop. 'cause it's kind of like one

1201
01:12:59,245 --> 01:13:01,085
Speaker 17:  of the main ways you use it. What is

1202
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:05,045
Speaker 2:  Dell doing? Yeah, when you say ruin the keyboard, what, what

1203
01:13:05,045 --> 01:13:05,325
Speaker 2:  do you mean?

1204
01:13:06,105 --> 01:13:09,605
Speaker 17:  All right, so it's, it, it may come down to taste, I know some people may

1205
01:13:09,605 --> 01:13:12,885
Speaker 17:  be fine with it, but they use what they call like a lattice list keyboard.

1206
01:13:13,075 --> 01:13:16,445
Speaker 17:  It's basically a keyboard that's like gapless right between the keys

1207
01:13:16,985 --> 01:13:20,925
Speaker 17:  and it looks very nice and then you touch it and it feels

1208
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:24,765
Speaker 17:  awful. And I make so many more typos. I use the XV 13

1209
01:13:24,925 --> 01:13:28,845
Speaker 17:  a ton and I, I, I was not happy to give it such a

1210
01:13:28,945 --> 01:13:32,725
Speaker 17:  bad review, but I just found that it, the, the keyboard was just a nightmare.

1211
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:36,685
Speaker 17:  But that's, that, that used to be a really good go-to option. Now at maybe,

1212
01:13:37,055 --> 01:13:40,325
Speaker 17:  maybe Dell will recover itself once it, you know, starts releasing them

1213
01:13:40,325 --> 01:13:43,765
Speaker 17:  under like Dell Pro Premium plus max whatever,

1214
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:47,445
Speaker 17:  if we can, I'll ignore the names when the laptops deliver, you know, what

1215
01:13:47,445 --> 01:13:48,165
Speaker 17:  they used to deliver.

1216
01:13:48,275 --> 01:13:51,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's you, you can get away with having stupid names when you have

1217
01:13:51,085 --> 01:13:54,645
Speaker 2:  good laptops. So the answer right now I think is not the XPS 13, I will say

1218
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:58,885
Speaker 2:  a a useful thing to do is probably go see if you can like type on one in

1219
01:13:58,885 --> 01:13:59,325
Speaker 2:  a store.

1220
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:03,685
Speaker 2:  And It is, 'cause there are probably people who will not hate this keyboard.

1221
01:14:03,885 --> 01:14:07,245
Speaker 2:  I agree with you. I think the gapless keyboards in general I find unusable,

1222
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:11,125
Speaker 2:  but it's like, if it works for you, fine. Knock yourself out. What

1223
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:14,915
Speaker 2:  else even might go on the list of like just sort of

1224
01:14:14,915 --> 01:14:17,235
Speaker 2:  default recommendation laptops right now.

1225
01:14:17,665 --> 01:14:20,795
Speaker 17:  Okay, so I know you're not gonna like this, but I I, I come up with three.

1226
01:14:20,865 --> 01:14:24,475
Speaker 17:  Okay. And the reason there are three is because see in the Mac world it's

1227
01:14:24,475 --> 01:14:27,595
Speaker 17:  obviously easy. It's m chipps all around, right? And

1228
01:14:28,895 --> 01:14:32,155
Speaker 17:  as like David, you always say like, buy the, the best thing you can afford

1229
01:14:32,215 --> 01:14:36,075
Speaker 17:  and it'll last you how however long. So I think a lot of Windows

1230
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,835
Speaker 17:  laptops are competitive and good in that

1231
01:14:40,315 --> 01:14:43,995
Speaker 17:  thousand to $1,300 range. And I think it really comes down to your

1232
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,715
Speaker 17:  use case based on the chips that are in there. For example, the

1233
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:52,115
Speaker 17:  Microsoft Surface Laptop seventh Edition or just Surface laptop seven, if

1234
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:55,915
Speaker 17:  you wanna just call it that for shorthand. That's Microsoft's answer

1235
01:14:55,935 --> 01:14:59,715
Speaker 17:  to the MacBook Air. It is a very MacBook Air, like Windows laptop

1236
01:15:00,325 --> 01:15:03,755
Speaker 17:  comes in some nice colors even it's very thin and light. It's got a

1237
01:15:04,085 --> 01:15:07,755
Speaker 17:  Snapdragon X processor. That's a blessing and a curse because

1238
01:15:08,255 --> 01:15:11,995
Speaker 17:  the blessing is that you get MacBook air levels of battery life

1239
01:15:12,105 --> 01:15:15,595
Speaker 17:  standby time and that's one of like the MacBook Air's like

1240
01:15:16,195 --> 01:15:20,075
Speaker 17:  strongest points. But with the Snapdragon X, you're also,

1241
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:24,115
Speaker 17:  you're running Windows on arm, which is so much more fine than it used to

1242
01:15:24,115 --> 01:15:27,755
Speaker 17:  be. But it's not like you can just give this to

1243
01:15:27,755 --> 01:15:31,395
Speaker 17:  anyone and it's gonna use work for every use case. There are some apps that

1244
01:15:31,415 --> 01:15:35,275
Speaker 17:  may not be compatible. There are of course games that are not compatible.

1245
01:15:35,555 --> 01:15:39,075
Speaker 17:  I know if anyone's hearing this like, oh, like who's gaming on a thin light

1246
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:41,395
Speaker 17:  laptop? But you know what? Thin light laptops can do a little light gaming

1247
01:15:41,395 --> 01:15:44,995
Speaker 17:  just like a MacBook Air can do a little very, very light gaming and

1248
01:15:44,995 --> 01:15:48,835
Speaker 2:  There is something to the, like it will just run all the things that

1249
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:52,115
Speaker 2:  I need it to run. Right? Like, and I, I think exactly to some extent, the

1250
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:55,115
Speaker 2:  thing for me with the Surface laptop is I think if it's not the right thing

1251
01:15:55,115 --> 01:15:58,715
Speaker 2:  for you, you probably already know if that makes sense. Like there there

1252
01:15:58,715 --> 01:16:02,635
Speaker 2:  is this gigantically long, long tail of software that will

1253
01:16:02,635 --> 01:16:06,275
Speaker 2:  not work well on that computer. But like if you just, if if you just wanna

1254
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:10,195
Speaker 2:  like run a browser most of the time, which I think is frankly what most people

1255
01:16:10,195 --> 01:16:14,075
Speaker 2:  do on most of their computers, it's gonna be fine. So I think that

1256
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:16,795
Speaker 2:  one is an interesting one for me where I think most people will sort of

1257
01:16:17,385 --> 01:16:21,355
Speaker 2:  self-select in or out of that. But it also kills me that Windows on

1258
01:16:21,355 --> 01:16:25,235
Speaker 2:  arm is like, it's, it's so close, but it's not there yet. It's so close.

1259
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:29,875
Speaker 17:  But yeah. Then, okay, so another option with an A

1260
01:16:29,995 --> 01:16:33,635
Speaker 17:  MD chip. I just reviewed this, the new Framework, Laptop 13,

1261
01:16:34,315 --> 01:16:37,795
Speaker 17:  the new model with the Ryzen AI 300 series chips.

1262
01:16:38,425 --> 01:16:41,875
Speaker 17:  This is, I'd say the most charming laptop around.

1263
01:16:42,745 --> 01:16:46,475
Speaker 17:  It's also a very, very good laptop. And it may seem

1264
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:50,555
Speaker 17:  daunting to recommend this to someone because it's a, it's repairable,

1265
01:16:50,585 --> 01:16:54,515
Speaker 17:  it's modular, it, it, you know, it it, you can get it as a DIY addition,

1266
01:16:54,515 --> 01:16:58,235
Speaker 17:  which I do recommend to people if you, you know, feel comfortable

1267
01:16:58,305 --> 01:17:01,275
Speaker 17:  like putting it together, but you're not, I mean you're just plugging in

1268
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:05,075
Speaker 17:  the ram and like putting in the SSD and that's been like

1269
01:17:05,075 --> 01:17:08,635
Speaker 17:  attaching a couple things. It's really, really simple. I had it, I I took

1270
01:17:08,635 --> 01:17:12,625
Speaker 17:  like 20 minutes to do that or less. It took longer to install windows, but

1271
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:16,305
Speaker 17:  you can get it as a prebuilt for a little more money and it comes ready

1272
01:17:16,305 --> 01:17:19,865
Speaker 17:  to go. There's no window. The windows is already installed and yeah, it's

1273
01:17:19,865 --> 01:17:23,785
Speaker 17:  a no nonsense laptop. It's very good. It's very MacBook Air like. But the

1274
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:27,745
Speaker 17:  coolest thing, this is so cool. You pick the ports, right?

1275
01:17:28,085 --> 01:17:31,945
Speaker 17:  You get four ports and you pick the expansion cards that you want for it.

1276
01:17:32,005 --> 01:17:35,905
Speaker 17:  You can do all four USBC, you can do two

1277
01:17:35,945 --> 01:17:39,465
Speaker 17:  USBC an HDMI and A-U-S-B-A. You can do a micro

1278
01:17:39,745 --> 01:17:43,625
Speaker 17:  SD if you want. You can do an ethernet jack. Like that's so cool. And you

1279
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:46,905
Speaker 17:  don't get that. I mean, ethernet port kind of sticks out 'cause it's, you

1280
01:17:46,905 --> 01:17:49,185
Speaker 17:  know, it's a thin, it's this thin and light laptop, but you don't normally

1281
01:17:49,185 --> 01:17:52,145
Speaker 17:  get that on a thin light laptop. You normally need like a beefy gaming laptop

1282
01:17:52,145 --> 01:17:55,545
Speaker 17:  to get an ethernet jack. And that could be kind of helpful. Battery life

1283
01:17:55,565 --> 01:17:58,505
Speaker 17:  is like, not the best, but it's pretty good. I think you can get through

1284
01:17:58,905 --> 01:18:02,505
Speaker 17:  a day of work and maybe if you work it blow too hard, you might have to,

1285
01:18:02,605 --> 01:18:05,505
Speaker 17:  you know, keep it juiced up. But I, I know a lot of people do work plugged

1286
01:18:05,525 --> 01:18:09,225
Speaker 17:  in anyway and yeah, it's just, it's a very good laptop.

1287
01:18:09,295 --> 01:18:12,625
Speaker 17:  It's also just so freaking cool to pick your ports. You can even do some

1288
01:18:12,825 --> 01:18:15,785
Speaker 17:  customizations, like have a translucent bezel that you can install and it's

1289
01:18:15,785 --> 01:18:19,345
Speaker 17:  like it's magnetic. It just like drops in and out. Very cool. Okay.

1290
01:18:19,365 --> 01:18:23,315
Speaker 2:  So I did not expect to find that a compelling possibility

1291
01:18:23,315 --> 01:18:25,435
Speaker 2:  here, but I like that a lot. So what's what's your third one?

1292
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:29,115
Speaker 17:  Okay, so my third one is the ACE or Swift 14 ai.

1293
01:18:30,705 --> 01:18:34,275
Speaker 17:  It's not the prettiest laptop, it's not the, the quality

1294
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:37,715
Speaker 17:  overall is quite fine. It's nothing that's really gonna blow you away like

1295
01:18:37,715 --> 01:18:40,955
Speaker 17:  a MacBook Air or even like the Surface, but it's a very

1296
01:18:42,235 --> 01:18:45,955
Speaker 17:  function over form laptop. The screen is just, okay, it's a, it's a

1297
01:18:46,075 --> 01:18:49,915
Speaker 17:  1920 by 1200 P screen. Nothing special there. But what It is nice

1298
01:18:49,915 --> 01:18:53,755
Speaker 17:  about this is the, the balance of performance and the ports. You get two

1299
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:57,755
Speaker 17:  USBC and two USBA and an HDMI out on

1300
01:18:57,955 --> 01:19:01,835
Speaker 17:  a 14 inch laptop that's pretty small, pretty compact. Again, not as

1301
01:19:01,835 --> 01:19:05,635
Speaker 17:  compact as a MacBook Air, but it's a thin and light and the

1302
01:19:05,645 --> 01:19:09,555
Speaker 17:  lunar like chip gets the job done. You can, you know, do pretty much everything

1303
01:19:09,555 --> 01:19:13,475
Speaker 17:  you need with it. It's a good performer. It doesn't benchmark as high

1304
01:19:13,475 --> 01:19:16,755
Speaker 17:  as a MD stuff, but it doesn't last quite as long. Battery lifewise as

1305
01:19:17,935 --> 01:19:21,355
Speaker 17:  as Snapdragon, but it's kind of a Goldilocks, it's kind of, well that's

1306
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:24,675
Speaker 17:  just, just the right balance. And actually Lunar light can do some

1307
01:19:24,975 --> 01:19:28,395
Speaker 17:  decent gaming for integrated graphics. Not counting like

1308
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:32,675
Speaker 17:  strict halo, which is like a different beast Sure. For integrated

1309
01:19:32,995 --> 01:19:36,155
Speaker 17:  graphics. But yeah, that's a, that's a solid all arounder

1310
01:19:36,765 --> 01:19:39,035
Speaker 17:  happy medium and a, a decent laptop.

1311
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,315
Speaker 2:  I just Googled this by the way, and It is the most boring laptop I've ever

1312
01:19:42,315 --> 01:19:45,275
Speaker 2:  seen in my life. And I kind of mean that as a compliment, right? Like I,

1313
01:19:45,305 --> 01:19:45,595
Speaker 2:  I've,

1314
01:19:45,595 --> 01:19:46,915
Speaker 17:  Yeah, it's not compelling. I've

1315
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:50,235
Speaker 2:  Come around to like, I don't actually need my laptop to be like thrilling

1316
01:19:50,295 --> 01:19:54,195
Speaker 2:  and have new ideas about how things should look like. Just give me

1317
01:19:54,355 --> 01:19:58,115
Speaker 2:  a decent looking set of ports and a body that

1318
01:19:58,115 --> 01:20:01,675
Speaker 2:  doesn't feel like it's about to fall apart and, and we're cool. And I think

1319
01:20:01,675 --> 01:20:05,595
Speaker 2:  for a long time, Acer failed the make it not feel like it's about

1320
01:20:05,595 --> 01:20:09,005
Speaker 2:  to fall apart test, but it sounds like this one's a little better. They,

1321
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:12,125
Speaker 2:  they've like, they've learned how to make a solid thing even if

1322
01:20:12,955 --> 01:20:15,165
Speaker 2:  they don't know how to design anything. Yeah,

1323
01:20:15,355 --> 01:20:18,365
Speaker 17:  Yeah. It's, again, it's not attractive, but it's, it's kind of just fine

1324
01:20:18,425 --> 01:20:22,165
Speaker 17:  all around decent keyboard, decent track pad, you know, and those things

1325
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:25,805
Speaker 17:  are important of course. And then if you can spend a little more

1326
01:20:26,575 --> 01:20:30,485
Speaker 17:  check out the Asus Aser, but Asus Zen book S

1327
01:20:30,765 --> 01:20:34,605
Speaker 17:  14, we've reviewed the 16 inch version, which had the rise

1328
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:37,685
Speaker 17:  in AI chip, which is an awesome machine, but much pricier.

1329
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:42,365
Speaker 17:  But the Zen Book S 14 comes the lunar lake chip from Intel.

1330
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:46,285
Speaker 17:  And it's much more felt and very nice looking,

1331
01:20:47,245 --> 01:20:50,205
Speaker 17:  a lot more of a design object than especially the Acer.

1332
01:20:51,025 --> 01:20:54,165
Speaker 17:  And you get an old lid screen, that's a really nice panel to look at. So

1333
01:20:54,165 --> 01:20:57,605
Speaker 17:  if you can spend a little more and you still want that happy medium with

1334
01:20:57,605 --> 01:21:01,285
Speaker 17:  a lunar lake chip, then yeah, send bug S 14.

1335
01:21:01,715 --> 01:21:02,005
Speaker 17:  Okay.

1336
01:21:02,075 --> 01:21:02,685
Speaker 2:  This is a good

1337
01:21:02,805 --> 01:21:04,565
Speaker 17:  List. I snuck in a fourth. Sorry. No,

1338
01:21:04,565 --> 01:21:08,325
Speaker 2:  This, this is a really good list and I think both speaks

1339
01:21:08,465 --> 01:21:12,405
Speaker 2:  to how sort of interesting the Windows landscape is right now, but also how

1340
01:21:12,435 --> 01:21:15,965
Speaker 2:  very confusing the Windows landscape is right now. Because it, it's, you're

1341
01:21:16,165 --> 01:21:19,685
Speaker 2:  probably right that there are a bunch of like chip reasons actually that

1342
01:21:19,685 --> 01:21:22,765
Speaker 2:  it's really hard to have one single pat answer to this question.

1343
01:21:23,395 --> 01:21:27,365
Speaker 2:  There's just so much up in the air about sort of which of these

1344
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:31,725
Speaker 2:  configurations is the correct Windows path forward. And my

1345
01:21:31,725 --> 01:21:35,685
Speaker 2:  guess is we'll have a much clearer sense of that in like 18 months than

1346
01:21:35,685 --> 01:21:39,285
Speaker 2:  we do right now. But especially with Qualcomm and the co-pilot plus PC

1347
01:21:39,805 --> 01:21:43,645
Speaker 2:  universe, that all just feels very new and interesting. But not,

1348
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:47,875
Speaker 2:  not quite finished yet, but we asked for one

1349
01:21:48,055 --> 01:21:51,835
Speaker 2:  answer. I think I know which of the four I if like, if I'm standing in a

1350
01:21:51,835 --> 01:21:55,195
Speaker 2:  store and I'm like, just buy this one and, and leave me alone. To me, I think,

1351
01:21:55,315 --> 01:21:58,515
Speaker 2:  I think the answer is actually the Framework Laptop. It is the easiest to

1352
01:21:58,635 --> 01:22:01,795
Speaker 2:  like undo the decision. If you've made it, you can just like put in new ports,

1353
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:06,115
Speaker 2:  it'll upgrade over time. It'll last a long time. People really love it.

1354
01:22:06,675 --> 01:22:10,555
Speaker 2:  I haven't used the, the keyboard on the new ones in, in a while, but I keep

1355
01:22:10,555 --> 01:22:14,515
Speaker 2:  hearing good things. Like this is a terrific computer. Would we be crazy

1356
01:22:14,575 --> 01:22:18,435
Speaker 2:  to just call that the, the sort of MacBook Air of the Windows ecosystem for

1357
01:22:18,435 --> 01:22:21,715
Speaker 2:  very different reasons. But it does feel like if I'm just gonna give you

1358
01:22:21,755 --> 01:22:24,675
Speaker 2:  a computer, I'm pretty confident you're gonna like, that feels like a good

1359
01:22:24,675 --> 01:22:25,195
Speaker 2:  place to start.

1360
01:22:25,985 --> 01:22:29,475
Speaker 17:  Yeah, I think, I think it's, I'm fine with saying that it's, the framework

1361
01:22:29,475 --> 01:22:33,275
Speaker 17:  is a great laptop and yeah, it's just the, the keyboard is good.

1362
01:22:33,305 --> 01:22:37,115
Speaker 17:  It's a little, the, the it key feel is a littles fungi than I like, but

1363
01:22:37,115 --> 01:22:40,995
Speaker 17:  it's great to type on Trackpad is, I think

1364
01:22:40,995 --> 01:22:44,435
Speaker 17:  good, but you know, it, it feels a little cheaper than some other trackpads.

1365
01:22:44,435 --> 01:22:47,875
Speaker 17:  It's not, it's not the fanciness that, you know, apple has to, in my opinion,

1366
01:22:47,965 --> 01:22:51,635
Speaker 17:  apple has the best track pads, the haptic track pads from Apple are

1367
01:22:51,775 --> 01:22:55,555
Speaker 17:  really still the best. Right? As long as you don't mind that it

1368
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:58,235
Speaker 17:  doesn't physically click. I've gotten used to it over the years, I'm fine

1369
01:22:58,235 --> 01:23:02,195
Speaker 17:  with it. Yeah, the Framework Laptop is a, is a good all arounder.

1370
01:23:02,195 --> 01:23:04,795
Speaker 17:  And again, just picking the ports is so cool. And having something that

1371
01:23:04,795 --> 01:23:07,925
Speaker 17:  you can feasibly get repaired or repair yourself

1372
01:23:08,955 --> 01:23:12,205
Speaker 17:  more easily and replace, I mean, you can upgrade the ram, you can upgrade

1373
01:23:12,275 --> 01:23:15,805
Speaker 17:  your SSD later. You can yeah, change your mind on the ports. You can, you

1374
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:18,885
Speaker 17:  can bring an extra port with you. That's just kind of weird, you know, like

1375
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:22,245
Speaker 17:  it's, you can't do that anywhere else. So yeah, I, I don't mind it being

1376
01:23:22,245 --> 01:23:26,005
Speaker 17:  the, the recommendation even if it's got a little asterisk of like, you

1377
01:23:26,005 --> 01:23:29,725
Speaker 17:  may have to do some my tea or maybe, maybe some little bit of a weird pick.

1378
01:23:29,745 --> 01:23:31,525
Speaker 17:  But it's, it's a cool ass laptop.

1379
01:23:32,385 --> 01:23:35,805
Speaker 2:  All right, Antonio, thank you. Appreciate it. So Rob, I hope that helped.

1380
01:23:37,955 --> 01:23:40,765
Speaker 2:  Alright, that is it for the first cast today. Thank you to everybody who

1384
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:55,485
Speaker 2:  a thing I have been as fascinated by as the Slate Truck in particular in
