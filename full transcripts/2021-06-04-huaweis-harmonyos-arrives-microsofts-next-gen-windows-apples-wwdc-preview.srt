47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,090
Speaker 1:  virtuous, I'm very excited to have you on the show. I want you to start.

48
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,750
Speaker 1:  We have a lot to talk about WWC is next week. Microsoft is

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,020
Speaker 1:  threatening to release a new version of windows. You got to talk about that

50
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,350
Speaker 1:  with Tom <inaudible> is coming up. Other nobody knows anything about

51
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,250
Speaker 1:  <inaudible> and then we were off last week. So there's a bunch of

52
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,210
Speaker 1:  news to talk about from last week. Most importantly of which is of

53
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,020
Speaker 1:  course the at and T time Warner deal has its

54
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,400
Speaker 1:  come to its inevitable conclusion, which is that it's over now. So a lot

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,210
Speaker 1:  to catch up on, I do want to start where I always start with COVID, like

56
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,930
Speaker 1:  I said, I'm in the office. It's we're in the United States, at least elsewhere

57
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,660
Speaker 1:  in the world. It's still very bad, but the United States, it's still the

58
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,440
Speaker 1:  biggest story going. We're still not out of it, but we are coming to what

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,400
Speaker 1:  feels like an end of something. I think there's a lot of change to come.

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,090
Speaker 1:  I think this summer is going to be nuts in the United States is everybody

61
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,840
Speaker 1:  like emerges from seclusion. I think there's a lot of change to come,

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,960
Speaker 1:  but we do have some stories on the site that I think point

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,920
Speaker 1:  to there's a time of reflection that's happening. So Nicole Watson has a

64
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,910
Speaker 1:  great story about all of the tech initiatives that we saw during

65
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,330
Speaker 1:  the pandemic. We've talked about a lot of them on the show, there was the

66
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,630
Speaker 1:  exposure notification system. There was a bunch of Facebook and

67
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,500
Speaker 1:  Google location, data that was made available to researchers.

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,400
Speaker 1:  There was a promise of a website.

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,880
Speaker 4:  Was there a website in LA? How long, how long did it take them to make it?

70
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,660
Speaker 1:  It's not more than a year. And that website does not exist about where you

71
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,080
Speaker 1:  can get tested. So Nicole has a rundown of what worked and what didn't. I

72
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,990
Speaker 1:  think it is remarkable that exposure notification just kind of didn't go

73
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,890
Speaker 1:  anywhere. So really mixed results. She has a big breakdown of that, but the

74
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,880
Speaker 1:  location, data location, data that Google and Facebook made available as

75
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,660
Speaker 1:  part of a program called data for good. They just released the data anonymously

76
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,520
Speaker 1:  to researchers, and that has become a huge success in that the

77
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,430
Speaker 1:  scientific and academic community. So just a real, what did

78
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,390
Speaker 1:  we learn from all of the tech initiatives and it's I

79
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,380
Speaker 1:  think some surprising results in there. So that's a great story. There is,

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,160
Speaker 1:  it continues to be controversy about the origins of COVID

81
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,220
Speaker 1:  Nicole. Actually, it's a real three-pack from Nicole this week article. It's

82
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,760
Speaker 1:  a great story about how that's important to suss out, figuring out the beginnings,

83
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,340
Speaker 1:  isn't gonna help us figure out the end. So she has a great story, unpacking

84
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,210
Speaker 1:  that. And then she has another great story about

85
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,900
Speaker 1:  what we know the vaccine so far, which is that immunity looks good

86
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,500
Speaker 1:  for a long period of time to come. We obviously have to

87
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,320
Speaker 1:  experience the time to come to make sure that works. But right now the data

88
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,620
Speaker 1:  suggests it's going well. So an end of one

89
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,460
Speaker 1:  period, I can talk to you from our office again, but I'm so

90
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,390
Speaker 1:  giddy about being in this office. Again, I was not expecting it, but I

91
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,580
Speaker 1:  also had to drive two hours to get here. I think we're just excited about

92
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,450
Speaker 1:  not being in a car anymore. We'll see how this goes, as the show goes on,

93
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,290
Speaker 1:  but we continue to cover COVID in the vaccines and what we have learned

94
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,320
Speaker 1:  from this moment, very carefully, Nicole, doing a great job.

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,770
Speaker 1:  Okay? WWDC, worldwide developers

96
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,550
Speaker 1:  conference. It's apple time. It's apple time. There's a lot to talk

97
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,390
Speaker 1:  about apple updates, all of its many offices. There's like

98
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,600
Speaker 1:  a, a whisper of a room where they're going to announce yet another

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,530
Speaker 1:  OSTP called homo S which makes yeah, we'll

100
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,250
Speaker 1:  see. They, they needed advice to run on it, like putting

101
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,750
Speaker 1:  in a customer less than the home pod makes no sense. Like the only announcing

102
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,720
Speaker 1:  asked if you have apps, if you have a reason to tell people almost your Google,

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,760
Speaker 1:  in which case you just announced to us as all the time. Well,

104
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,680
Speaker 4:  Hang on the iPhone. Oh, S didn't have apps. Didn't have third party. It

105
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,520
Speaker 4:  was about it.

106
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,060
Speaker 1:  They actually didn't. It didn't even really have a name. It was iPhone

107
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,990
Speaker 1:  S and then it was iPhone O S when they announced apps. And when they

108
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,590
Speaker 1:  did the iPad for like a year, the

109
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,460
Speaker 1:  iPad ran iPhone iOS that's right. Yep. And then they changed it to iOS to

110
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,970
Speaker 1:  make it encompassing. And then they realized like, oh, what two years ago?

111
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,460
Speaker 1:  Like, oh, this is constricting. And they renamed it. Like apple is

112
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,320
Speaker 1:  very, they don't like making new names. Anyone they do, they don't

113
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,380
Speaker 1:  even mean, but Google is like, I don't know. Here's another Linux-based to

114
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,760
Speaker 1:  us that we made. What's the future. Here's another messaging

115
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,810
Speaker 1:  app in any of

116
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,700
Speaker 1:  them. This operating systems runs on

117
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,630
Speaker 1:  RCS. Anyway. WTC is where apple goes through all of its

118
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,230
Speaker 1:  existing operating systems, iOS, iPad, iOS, Mac iOS, Washoe,

119
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,980
Speaker 1:  S T V O S in the now potentially like, we'll

120
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,940
Speaker 1:  see, but there's a rumble that they'll do that. I want to go through on

121
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,690
Speaker 1:  order. But theater and I were talking before the show, Apple's like under

122
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,590
Speaker 1:  a cloud at this WWDC, like they just had this big trial

123
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,620
Speaker 1:  with epic, a little bit of one. Every, the developer community is

124
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,460
Speaker 1:  extremely aware that apple executives are like, huh? How can we make

125
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,390
Speaker 1:  money off of this idea? Let's just turn the money fountain on

126
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,570
Speaker 1:  and like take 30%. The rationale for that

127
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,500
Speaker 1:  30% you might buy it. I think it is rational.

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Speaker 1:  Some of the things they say about why that 30% exists is

129
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,370
Speaker 1:  rational. Some of it is like, they're just stubborn. And some of it is

130
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,910
Speaker 1:  like, they're just greedy. And that is the first time I think

131
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,720
Speaker 1:  Apple's like, armor has been punctured in this way, heading

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,280
Speaker 1:  into a WTB.

133
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,030
Speaker 4:  How do you do a WWDC? But you remember what was, when did, Hey, go

134
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,020
Speaker 4:  after them? It was like the morning or the day before. It was like a few

135
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,880
Speaker 4:  days before. Yeah.

136
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,570
Speaker 1:  Well that was like one email app from one popular developer who maybe it's

137
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,500
Speaker 1:  not so popular anymore. And like, yeah. And then like resolved it. Like

138
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,490
Speaker 1:  they just like solve the problem. Yeah. Like re-interpreting a rule. This

139
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,480
Speaker 1:  is like hundreds of emails, Tim cook on the stand

140
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,110
Speaker 1:  being like, this is how I monetize the phone. I think it is a

141
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,540
Speaker 1:  qualitatively different situation kind

142
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,810
Speaker 5:  Of, but they'll, they're apples though. Announcing really cool for

143
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,230
Speaker 5:  developers and they'll sit and forget those problems. Just like we

144
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,190
Speaker 5:  forget everything that happens a week or two before these

145
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,940
Speaker 5:  days. I feel like there there's a lot of quietness around

146
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,510
Speaker 5:  WWDC this year. And like, there hasn't been many big iOS

147
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,500
Speaker 5:  rumors or iPad rumors, which makes me think that they've kept

148
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,430
Speaker 5:  something secret that they're going to do. And I have theories. It's

149
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,940
Speaker 5:  like, where's the M one chip in the iPad, you know, like,

150
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,480
Speaker 5:  oh,

151
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,340
Speaker 1:  So you can unlock your car with your iPad. Yeah. I mean

152
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,610
Speaker 1:  like, think about all of the, you know, the billionaires who use an iPad

153
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,210
Speaker 1:  as a camera, they got to walk up to the, the rolls and they're just going

154
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,020
Speaker 1:  to wait. It's straight

155
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,350
Speaker 5:  Away. But I think, I think they will silence the, the stories that we've

156
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,470
Speaker 5:  seen over the last few weeks, the epic trial and stuff. We've, you know,

157
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,070
Speaker 5:  we've what they do best, which is just products and please

158
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,750
Speaker 5:  developers in different ways because they always seem to manage to do

159
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,280
Speaker 5:  it. I don't

160
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,180
Speaker 4:  Know. I think like, I think that this is not going to get quite a down quite

161
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,190
Speaker 4:  so easy. There's going to be, they're going to flood the zone. There's gonna

162
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,060
Speaker 4:  be a million stories. We're gonna write a million stories. But I think that

163
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,780
Speaker 4:  when that dust settles, there's a, still a

164
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,350
Speaker 4:  Congress that is still very interested and asking them questions and, you

165
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,650
Speaker 4:  know, scoring points there and finding out if they could do something about

166
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,310
Speaker 4:  it. I don't think it's going to go away quite so easy to me. The more interesting

167
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,550
Speaker 4:  question is, will there be any

168
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,060
Speaker 4:  kind of acknowledgement in this

169
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,720
Speaker 4:  online keynote, infomercial

170
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,290
Speaker 4:  thing of all the drama? Will there be any

171
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,760
Speaker 4:  gesture at all?

172
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,090
Speaker 6:  I don't think they can. They can't say anything because

173
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,990
Speaker 6:  like it's being the judges looking at it right now and deciding,

174
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,740
Speaker 6:  and they can't just go out and be like, we're going to cut prices or whatever

175
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,920
Speaker 6:  with the judge or we're going to increase prices. Like nothing. They

176
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,090
Speaker 6:  say

177
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,590
Speaker 1:  It would be amazing if they were like, we're going to

178
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,520
Speaker 1:  45% to me,

179
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,420
Speaker 1:  that'd be great. I don't know, actually right there in this period of

180
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,350
Speaker 1:  scrutiny, certainly the Congress in this country is, you know,

181
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,160
Speaker 1:  making a lot of noise, whether they can effectively pass anything, remains

182
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,910
Speaker 1:  to be seen. There's that court case, there's the EU complaint

183
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,720
Speaker 1:  against the app store. The likes to do stuff. Whether any of

184
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,650
Speaker 1:  that is effective also remains to be seen, but like they're under this cloud.

185
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,080
Speaker 1:  And the last time they were under this cloud, they announced the small business

186
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,380
Speaker 1:  program. Yep. Which the judge in the trial actually said, you didn't do this

187
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,650
Speaker 1:  for competition. You did it because of regulators and pressure.

188
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,520
Speaker 1:  Like, so like they haven't, they have all their moves that could make the,

189
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,300
Speaker 1:  I think the theaters, right. This, the keynotes are now infomercials. They

190
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,480
Speaker 1:  have been for over a year now from all the companies, these like tightly

191
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,410
Speaker 1:  scripted. They're not gonna, no, one's going to boo them. Right.

192
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,710
Speaker 1:  That's the, that's the danger. You have like 10,000 people in Moscone, west.

193
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,190
Speaker 1:  Right. It's you're gonna announce a thing. And like Tim cook is going to

194
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,910
Speaker 1:  expect the cheer and it's pin drop silence, right. Or like

195
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,720
Speaker 1:  worst people are like, boo, we hate you. They don't have any of that to

196
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,440
Speaker 1:  worry about, but they could announce we're lowering the cut

197
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,340
Speaker 1:  on subscriptions to eight and a half percent for two years. They

198
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,150
Speaker 1:  could announce in that purchases for all categories, except for

199
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,050
Speaker 1:  games are going to 10%. And we're just going to keep milling the

200
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,010
Speaker 1:  whales in the games category forever. Like they have moves. I think

201
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,190
Speaker 1:  one of the questions I have is they can't just like gesture at it. They have

202
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,700
Speaker 1:  to do something. Will they do something after all of

203
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,480
Speaker 5:  This? But I think they've already done that though. Right? Cause they, they,

204
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,960
Speaker 5:  they cut it to 15% for some, basically the vast majority of

205
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,680
Speaker 5:  developers are at 15%. If you, you know, if you take out whatever

206
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,520
Speaker 5:  revenues they're generating. So they kind of did that in the wake of a lot

207
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,150
Speaker 5:  of this drama last year, you know, the, the questions around

208
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,690
Speaker 5:  it. So I'm not sure that they'll do anything. It don't do a D C related to

209
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,580
Speaker 5:  this until there's significant regulatory

210
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,000
Speaker 5:  pressure. Really. We don't really know what the EU are doing with their

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,930
Speaker 5:  case and what they're going to try and convince them to do. Like th th the,

212
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,920
Speaker 5:  the thing that needs to happen is a regulator has to step

213
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,820
Speaker 5:  in and say, you need to change your product or your business model in a certain,

214
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,750
Speaker 5:  not bit similar, but you need to change your product in a certain way. I

215
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,410
Speaker 5:  just don't know if that's going to happen anytime soon. Yeah.

216
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,220
Speaker 1:  And the likes to do like, do things there, like when you boot up an

217
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,490
Speaker 1:  Android phone, you're going to pick up a search engine and they're like,

218
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,030
Speaker 1:  everyone picks Google, like, but they love doing this

219
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,720
Speaker 1:  stuff. So we'll see. I just think that that's, to me, it

220
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,440
Speaker 1:  is the biggest dark cloud that apple has had before an event like this in

221
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,280
Speaker 1:  quite some time. So we'll just have to see if they come at it, because

222
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,000
Speaker 1:  this is their developer event. This was just another event to

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,900
Speaker 1:  announce a Mac book or an iPhone event. I would expect nothing,

224
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,670
Speaker 1:  but the audience for this, even though we're all gonna watch it. And it's

225
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,480
Speaker 1:  them like, lots of people, consumers are gonna watch it. Apple fans are gonna

226
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,870
Speaker 1:  watch it. The audience is developers. That's who this is

227
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,050
Speaker 1:  for. And it feels like they need to address that. Maybe they'll do it in

228
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,900
Speaker 1:  state of the union. Like, there's all these other events they have, they're

229
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,740
Speaker 1:  a little bit more close to work. But to me, it's like, we're going to talk

230
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,040
Speaker 1:  about all the lesses, the point of developer events and announcing arrests

231
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,830
Speaker 1:  is earliest to get developers excited about building to your new APIs and

232
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,730
Speaker 1:  your, your features and like making new, innovative stuff on top of the

233
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,360
Speaker 1:  platforms. If they're already kind of mad at you, like the

234
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,110
Speaker 1:  second part of the equation is just, it's harder to get through, but we'll

235
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,680
Speaker 1:  see what

236
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,550
Speaker 4:  If they just go back to charging for OSTP updates and that that's

237
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,330
Speaker 4:  still they'll fund they'll fund software that way, instead of the app store

238
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,300
Speaker 4:  fees, you're not going to do that. No, they won't. I'm just

239
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,990
Speaker 1:  Saying that'd be great box in the mail. And it's just like a, it's a

240
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,570
Speaker 1:  tiny little lightning USB key with

241
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,450
Speaker 3:  <inaudible> flushing

242
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,410
Speaker 6:  Your phone. You can't get out without buying a tool. It'd be incredible.

243
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,340
Speaker 6:  What Tom said, kind of made me go galaxy brain on this though, which

244
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,710
Speaker 6:  is, you know, he said, they're going to surprise us. They're going to do

245
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,490
Speaker 6:  something big. And one of the distraction isn't like directly to the developers,

246
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,450
Speaker 6:  but what if it is stuff like this homo S what if it's, you know, they've

247
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,660
Speaker 6:  been, they've been flirting around AR and they've got to start getting people

248
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,590
Speaker 6:  somewhat excited for that, for when they eventually released their AR glasses.

249
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,190
Speaker 6:  What if they do a big tease? Just kind of like to distract people from the

250
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,090
Speaker 6:  fact that everybody loses 30% of their income when they develop an app

251
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,390
Speaker 6:  for the store. Like, you know, I think they're really good. I'm putting on

252
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,900
Speaker 6:  a big show and, and, and, and really getting us hyped about things. And one

253
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,840
Speaker 6:  of it's kind of like, ignore that, ignore that, look at all this other cool

254
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,020
Speaker 6:  stuff we're doing. You want to get excited about this. You want to be in

255
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,050
Speaker 6:  people's homes in a different way. You want to be in their eyeballs in a

256
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,010
Speaker 6:  different way. I got it. Yeah. Here's, here's what it's going to be. You're

257
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,700
Speaker 6:  you're hearing

258
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,690
Speaker 4:  It from me first, exclusively. Oh my God. I could just see

259
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,410
Speaker 4:  it exclusive nonsense from Dieter Bo Tim cook

260
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,340
Speaker 4:  gets in the middle of apple park and he's like, you know,

261
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,320
Speaker 4:  the future of developing for the Mac is

262
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,010
Speaker 4:  web apps. And we're going to talk about PWAs and he's going to do

263
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,970
Speaker 4:  pwn. It's just going to be web apps nonstop for 45 minutes.

264
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,150
Speaker 4:  He's going to call it a suite solution.

265
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,840
Speaker 1:  The ghost of Steve jobs sucks. Tim cook into a

266
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,680
Speaker 1:  swirling vortex. It is like, that's not it. And

267
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,940
Speaker 1:  then the logo just

268
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,840
Speaker 1:  appears. We wouldn't be talking

269
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,620
Speaker 1:  about the 30%. That's true. That is definitely

270
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,220
Speaker 1:  true.

271
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,640
Speaker 5:  They will definitely have like, like Macko is smoke and mirrors. You know,

272
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,150
Speaker 5:  like there's going to be like some sort of, there's gonna be something that's

273
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,270
Speaker 5:  going to distract. They're going to be like, you know, we're going to give

274
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,480
Speaker 5:  you this. This is going to be great for developers. And like, cause that's

275
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,550
Speaker 5:  the way the apple tackles these things. They never cash.

276
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,300
Speaker 1:  They're just going to give developers cash. <inaudible> direct

277
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,770
Speaker 1:  apple pay,

278
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,130
Speaker 5:  And everyone's going to spend it on inferior or Bitcoin or whatever

279
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,730
Speaker 1:  Every day that you don't tweet apple gives you $5. Actually that would work.

280
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,210
Speaker 1:  I would take that deal. Let's go through the OSS. We'll see what happens.

281
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,020
Speaker 1:  I just wanted to put that in a context, because the point of these events

282
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,920
Speaker 1:  is to get people excited about building new products for the OSS.

283
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,980
Speaker 1:  And that is a hurdle they have to get over this year, which is

284
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,880
Speaker 1:  new. Let's talk about iOS, like very few rumors, but iOS

285
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,990
Speaker 1:  is, Tom was,

286
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,590
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's weird. It's it's suspiciously quiet. That's what I mean.

287
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,490
Speaker 5:  It's like, I think Mark Coleman had a story about how this is

288
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,230
Speaker 5:  going to be some change to that notification stuff and some home screen stuff.

289
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,050
Speaker 5:  <inaudible> but that seems like there's always a home screen thing on

290
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,410
Speaker 5:  iPad iOS every year now

291
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,690
Speaker 1:  Did nothing last year. Let's talk about them separately. So the phone is

292
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,530
Speaker 1:  like in a pretty good place. The notifications have

293
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,370
Speaker 1:  long needed updates. So that makes sense. They're going to do

294
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:33,910
Speaker 1:  differently.

295
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,390
Speaker 4:  Actually. We need to, we need to sit on this for just a second. Okay. So

296
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,260
Speaker 4:  the rumor is that the government is reporting is that they're going to have

297
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,100
Speaker 4:  different settings for different like situations you might be in like

298
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,980
Speaker 4:  driving, working, or sleeping. And then you can customize how notification

299
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,310
Speaker 4:  works for these different settings. Like automatic applies and

300
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,090
Speaker 4:  whatnot. This is literally just profiles. This

301
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,510
Speaker 4:  is the feature that was on every single feature phone. Like you hit like

302
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,020
Speaker 4:  star two or whatever. And then you'd pick between like five different rank

303
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,710
Speaker 4:  profiles for your ringtones or whatever that we just forgot

304
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,670
Speaker 4:  existed because here it is, it's the Vergecast because

305
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,300
Speaker 4:  Palm invented the ringer switch and then you don't want 50 profiles. You

306
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,110
Speaker 4:  just want to, and then apple is the only company that

307
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,410
Speaker 4:  bothered to steal it. And then one plus a little bit later. And

308
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,190
Speaker 4:  so, I don't know, like, I am very happy to see

309
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,150
Speaker 4:  lots of different notification like management options. I'm an Android

310
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,450
Speaker 4:  user. And I just love how Google changes their mind about how notifications

311
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,260
Speaker 4:  are gonna work every year, but that has gotten them to a good place. I

312
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,260
Speaker 4:  don't know that the problem with notifications on the iPhone is that there

313
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,380
Speaker 4:  aren't enough modes. Like that's not the problem.

314
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,300
Speaker 1:  We have to figure out how this works. Like it's just the rumor that we're

315
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,060
Speaker 1:  thinking about it. It's funny because we're started with apple start cloud

316
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,920
Speaker 1:  with developers, apple can just exert pressure on and be

317
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,820
Speaker 1:  like part of app review is that we are going to set priority levels for your

318
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,720
Speaker 1:  notifications for you. And if you abuse the system, we're

319
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,050
Speaker 1:  just going to kick you out of the store. And that is the one time I'm like,

320
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,890
Speaker 1:  yeah, you should do that on Android. Every

321
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,010
Speaker 1:  app is like, yeah, we're the highest priority notification. Just like out

322
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,970
Speaker 1:  of the box. They're all like, no one is humble enough, no Android

323
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,180
Speaker 1:  app developers humbled off to be like, you know what? You don't need these

324
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,760
Speaker 1:  notifications.

325
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,510
Speaker 3:  So like, I

326
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,470
Speaker 1:  Would accept that like a system where after overs are incentivized, to be

327
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,400
Speaker 1:  honest, that, yeah. Okay. I probably want

328
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,390
Speaker 1:  my messaging apps to be the highest priority notifications, but I

329
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,290
Speaker 1:  really do not. At this point, the New York times breaking news notifications

330
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,190
Speaker 1:  are like, we've conducted a 5,000 word investigation into

331
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,560
Speaker 1:  butterflies and it's like, I don't know what this is. Like, I just need to

332
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,490
Speaker 1:  shut this off, but I want them, I just don't need them

333
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,300
Speaker 1:  at the level of everything else. Like if I could do that in an iPhone, I

334
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,840
Speaker 1:  would be very happy. I would also like notifications to be much more

335
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,620
Speaker 1:  actionable, which they're stepping towards, but they're

336
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,430
Speaker 1:  still not great. Right? Like if I could delete a text from the home

337
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,400
Speaker 1:  screen, I would be the happiest person in the world. What

338
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,270
Speaker 5:  You're describing there sounds like you want some serious machine learning

339
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,050
Speaker 5:  chops in iOS, which is something that it's kind of lacking at the

340
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,680
Speaker 5:  moment or,

341
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,690
Speaker 1:  You know, features capabilities.

342
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,090
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But

343
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,940
Speaker 5:  You want, you want it to adapt to you, right? You want it to be like, oh,

344
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,810
Speaker 5:  look at this New York times alert. It's not like the phone knows me in

345
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,530
Speaker 5:  those that won't be interested in those butterflies. I mean, that's well,

346
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,250
Speaker 6:  It's, it's kind of weird though, because like apple can't really get

347
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,760
Speaker 6:  too in-depth in machine learning because it's, it's very much about like

348
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,690
Speaker 6:  siloing your profiles and your user data and stuff. And that's

349
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,470
Speaker 6:  always why it said serious kind of stupid. And I personally loved

350
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,950
Speaker 6:  that. Like, let it be more stupid if it means I don't have to have like,

351
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,730
Speaker 6:  worry about them listening in on everything I do.

352
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,660
Speaker 6:  But at the same time, if, if they don't do the machine learning thing, if

353
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,570
Speaker 6:  they do like exert influence on the app

354
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,410
Speaker 6:  creators, that just kind of pushes the right back towards the

355
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,310
Speaker 6:  judge is currently deciding if they have too much

356
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,120
Speaker 6:  power over creators. And it's just like, they're in a really, it's

357
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,430
Speaker 6:  like, I don't think there's an easy answer because like, what's the other

358
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,390
Speaker 6:  one. Like you get to go and create huge profiles for yourself and you

359
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,690
Speaker 6:  have to create like 12 different profiles and that's like the antithesis

360
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,620
Speaker 6:  of apple and just being able to open and use your phone. And so

361
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,450
Speaker 6:  it's like, I'm just curious to see what they do because every single route

362
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,210
Speaker 6:  seems very not what I would expect from apple.

363
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:26,750
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

364
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,540
Speaker 1:  I mean, I think the thing that's true right now is that notification management.

365
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,900
Speaker 1:  I know iPhones has been horrible since the day, the first iPhone came out.

366
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,890
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like right now getting a phone call and an iPhone is just an

367
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,730
Speaker 1:  incredible experience of like, you get the dropdown banner over

368
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,690
Speaker 1:  whatever you're doing, you can answer it. But then if you put it to your

369
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,650
Speaker 1:  ear, it's not in the app. So it doesn't shut off the

370
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,490
Speaker 1:  screen. So your cheek is just touching a bunch of stuff. So

371
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,400
Speaker 1:  that's like, it doesn't even make any sense. It's not in speaker phone, but

372
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,790
Speaker 1:  then he'd go to push the speaker button. It doesn't just default to the phone

373
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,780
Speaker 1:  speaker. It'll bring up the speaker menu and be like, do you want

374
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,560
Speaker 1:  to take this call on your Mac book pro? And then the person on the line is

375
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,040
Speaker 1:  like, are you there? And you're like, hang on. I'm still

376
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,790
Speaker 1:  answering the phone call.

377
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,090
Speaker 6:  And they're probably hearing you being called on your Mac, on your

378
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,930
Speaker 6:  iPad, on your watch, on every other product at your house that uses

379
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,840
Speaker 6:  apple. Yes.

380
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,950
Speaker 1:  You definitely know if you've caught somebody using iOS because you hear

381
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,760
Speaker 1:  that ringers around them come to a class when they answer. And

382
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,570
Speaker 1:  that's just like satisfying. That's the, that's the primary

383
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,530
Speaker 1:  notification of a phone. I just

384
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,020
Speaker 1:  like, they need to make that system more powerful. Whether it's with machine

385
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,650
Speaker 1:  learning, whether it's giving the users and endless series of

386
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,640
Speaker 1:  controls, whether it's, I don't know, just shutting it off, like just

387
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,570
Speaker 1:  do something like start it over and like rethink it. But it is

388
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,470
Speaker 1:  to me, this, it has always been and will continue to be

389
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,830
Speaker 1:  the single biggest pain point of an iPhone. And so if that's the thing, they

390
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,500
Speaker 1:  announced iOS, if you have nothing else, like, that'd be great.

391
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,190
Speaker 5:  I liked the way that, that over the last year or so in iOS

392
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,790
Speaker 5:  they've they have kind of been learning some of your behaviors to sort of

393
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,660
Speaker 5:  make it a little bit smarter. So like everyday I'll swipe down and

394
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,440
Speaker 5:  it'll be like, oh, you watch this Twitch stream. It's like, why don't you

395
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,010
Speaker 5:  watch this today? Or it will be like, oh, you messaged this person a lot

396
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,980
Speaker 5:  when you missed this, this person, you know, like at least tiny little things

397
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,790
Speaker 5:  that don't always quite work properly. But when they do, they're

398
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,780
Speaker 5:  kind of like those delight things. It's like, oh, let's save me. Like, you

399
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,500
Speaker 5:  know, a couple of seconds or whatever. Always just reminded me to do a task.

400
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,370
Speaker 5:  I like if they can really play on that with like not

401
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,360
Speaker 5:  being too into the privacy stuff and the creepiness of it. Cause it can be

402
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,350
Speaker 5:  creepy when these stuff pops up and like predicts your behavior.

403
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,920
Speaker 5:  Then I think that's a way of like layering iOS to be a bit

404
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,800
Speaker 5:  more, you know, power user-friendly or just a bit more

405
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,670
Speaker 5:  usable for, especially for stuff like notifications. If they, if they apply

406
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,490
Speaker 5:  that sort of ML to notifications.

407
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,000
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like you've pushed the answer call button and now our

408
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,450
Speaker 1:  advanced differential privacy ML system has

409
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,350
Speaker 1:  determined that you wish to answer the phone call. I'll take it. Here's

410
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,710
Speaker 1:  a, here's a question right now. Who are they lifting more from? Are they

411
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,400
Speaker 1:  lifting old windows phone ideas with app tiles and

412
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,060
Speaker 1:  like deep links? Are they lifting more Android

413
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,970
Speaker 1:  ideas? Because Andrew has a bunch of this stuff too, but it's, it's all just

414
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,330
Speaker 1:  very different than how windows funded it. And you can see apple is kind

415
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,840
Speaker 1:  of going in that leg app clips, app tiles, deep links

416
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,960
Speaker 1:  direction. More than that, the Android. What if the app was just kind of

417
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,270
Speaker 1:  running in this window all the time?

418
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,300
Speaker 5:  I think they're lifting from everyone and even the jailbreak community as

419
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,030
Speaker 5:  well. Right? Like we've seen a bunch of stuff from, from that community that's

420
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,690
Speaker 5:  bubbled up in tiredness. I think they just pick out wherever, wherever it's

421
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,340
Speaker 5:  good and works, works well, but they take their to refine it, which, you

422
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,630
Speaker 5:  know, we know from the decades of watching well,

423
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,530
Speaker 4:  The other rumor is that they're going to lift from WhatsApp because the

424
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,100
Speaker 4:  government says that they're working on quote upgrades to I message. With

425
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,730
Speaker 4:  the eventual goal of acting more like a social network and better competing

426
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,660
Speaker 4:  with Facebook links, WhatsApp disclosure for your bingo card. My wife

427
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,820
Speaker 4:  works for a division Facebook reality

428
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,510
Speaker 4:  labs, a division of Facebook. I

429
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,440
Speaker 4:  don't know what that means, but I do know that, you know, I message is nowhere

430
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,530
Speaker 4:  near as popular in the rest of the world, as it is in the U S and maybe apple

431
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,220
Speaker 4:  does feel like a desire to compete in some way. But I also

432
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,030
Speaker 4:  know that apple, the last thing that company would want to

433
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,450
Speaker 4:  do right now is deal with a, yet another like

434
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,660
Speaker 4:  moderation problem. Right. They got enough going on with the app

435
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,290
Speaker 4:  store. If there's like, you know, WhatsApp has had all sorts of

436
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,950
Speaker 4:  moderation issues and like, like having to disable automatic forwarding and

437
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,920
Speaker 4:  a whole bunch of other stuff. I don't know what apple is thinking with iMessage,

438
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,860
Speaker 4:  but trying to make it into a social network. That's like, that's a thing

439
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,220
Speaker 4:  that apple has not successfully done. Yeah.

440
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,750
Speaker 6:  The last one they tried

441
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,370
Speaker 5:  Ping, ping mobile meters. It was pretty great.

442
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,010
Speaker 1:  Wait, hold on. These are, these are all different apple failures. Ping was

443
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,070
Speaker 1:  their social network for music that made no sense. Oh. But

444
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,830
Speaker 4:  There was, there was an apple music one since then, but I forget what it

445
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,090
Speaker 4:  was called. Right.

446
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,060
Speaker 1:  Then there was one in apple music where artists like when they announced

447
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,720
Speaker 1:  apple music, they're like, and then artists will just like, not use Instagram.

448
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,840
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like that quickly fizzled into

449
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,710
Speaker 1:  nothing hit the brick wall of reality. Mobile me was their

450
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,550
Speaker 1:  cloud services that turned an iCloud mobile me famously

451
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,540
Speaker 1:  like Steve jobs stood up in front of like the mobile me team.

452
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,930
Speaker 1:  And it was like, Walt Mossberg hates this. How did he screw this

453
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,890
Speaker 1:  up? Which is like, amazing

454
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,920
Speaker 3:  Wall has very conflicted feelings about,

455
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,770
Speaker 1:  But like that was the, the, the level of failure was like, Steve jobs was

456
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,280
Speaker 1:  like, look at this, look at what Walt said, how'd you screw this up so bad,

457
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,250
Speaker 1:  but not a social network. I do think the last thing they tried to do with

458
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,060
Speaker 1:  iMessage was they tried to add apps to it in that era when Apple's answer

459
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,930
Speaker 1:  to everything was what if this had an app store. And so they tried to

460
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,830
Speaker 1:  put apps into iMessage and that has gone

461
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,820
Speaker 1:  effectively nowhere, except that it is now much harder to add

462
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,230
Speaker 1:  a photo to a text than an

463
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,130
Speaker 1:  iPhone.

464
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,050
Speaker 5:  So funny, the ego is like in the U S LMS is just such a huge thing because

465
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,510
Speaker 5:  I literally only ever go inside a message to look at like a scam

466
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,380
Speaker 5:  SMS. And so that's literally it.

467
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,070
Speaker 1:  That's amazing. Okay. So that's iOS. We think there's some notification stuff.

468
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,280
Speaker 1:  We think there's some high message stuff. Lots of mystery. Shrouding what

469
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,550
Speaker 1:  else they will do. Apple's most important platform. That can't be it. But

470
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,060
Speaker 1:  that's what we know so far. I pad OOS equally

471
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,480
Speaker 1:  mysterious, but I will say after the last round of iPad, pro

472
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,420
Speaker 1:  reviews, everyone is like, well, they got to do

473
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,380
Speaker 1:  something except for Dieter. Who's like, I dunno, man. I've been hearing

474
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,040
Speaker 1:  that for years

475
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,910
Speaker 3:  Tired. No,

476
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,870
Speaker 4:  I just, I, the rumors are gonna, they're going to let you like place widgets

477
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,080
Speaker 4:  wherever you want on the home screen. Cause they did that for the iPhone,

478
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,920
Speaker 4:  but they didn't do it for the iPad. And nobody knew why. And just the

479
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,370
Speaker 4:  hope that they're like, Apple's going to do something. Well, I could do like,

480
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,550
Speaker 4:  let you run Mac apps on the <inaudible> powered, iPad

481
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,360
Speaker 4:  pro I just don't. They're not, no, I just, I

482
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,660
Speaker 4:  I've, I no longer have hope,

483
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,660
Speaker 1:  No way. They're gonna let you do that because then you would have a touchscreen

484
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,920
Speaker 1:  Mac. I think

485
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,850
Speaker 5:  That it will have some form of it will happen, but like, it's going to

486
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,790
Speaker 5:  be years in the making, like these things don't, you know, they don't just

487
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,750
Speaker 5:  put an M one chip in the iPad and then six months later, go

488
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,880
Speaker 5:  there. You see mock-ups

489
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,780
Speaker 1:  I hear that, that they put the chip in the, the iPad, the <inaudible>

490
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,380
Speaker 1:  and that feels like it's going to lead to a logical conclusion. But I

491
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,370
Speaker 1:  also think apple is a master of its own supply chain and there's a chip

492
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,360
Speaker 1:  shortage. And the M one is really just like the a 13 X

493
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,840
Speaker 1:  or whatever. Like fundamentally it is just the next evolution of the chip

494
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,990
Speaker 1:  they were using. And they're like, whatever, we're just using it, all the

495
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,860
Speaker 1:  computers. Like I don't, th there's no reason like the existence of the chip

496
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,680
Speaker 1:  does not make them have to do anything. The existing of governments around

497
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,440
Speaker 1:  the world doesn't mean apple wants to do anything.

498
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,400
Speaker 5:  It doesn't. But like the fact that everything apart from the iPhone

499
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,820
Speaker 5:  is on M one. Now, like I said, everything's still, I pad the max.

500
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,510
Speaker 5:  Basically. There's a reason behind that other than chip shortages, I

501
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,840
Speaker 5:  think. Yeah. I just don't think we're going to get to that this

502
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,590
Speaker 5:  year. Like he is, it's a, it's a multi-year process.

503
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,310
Speaker 6:  Can't do it this year. They were so emphatic about the

504
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:23,180
Speaker 6:  Mac Mac iOS wouldn't become the iPad. Right? Like they

505
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,990
Speaker 6:  can't take one and make it the other they've been so emphatic about that

506
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,650
Speaker 6:  for so, so long that the minute they do it, we will like, I will be

507
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,400
Speaker 6:  delighted as I, as I gleefully throw it back in their

508
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,330
Speaker 6:  face, just in a blog form. Like they can't do

509
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,630
Speaker 6:  it. Like they have, it's going to have to be subtle and like low

510
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,620
Speaker 6:  key. And, and so I think it is, I think Tom's right. That is going to

511
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,830
Speaker 6:  be years and years and years. But it's also like, this is the

512
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,640
Speaker 6:  natural next step. And I think it's going to be kind of like

513
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,570
Speaker 6:  when they finally blew that the iPhone up and they had all these other

514
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,480
Speaker 6:  different things to distract you from the fact that you could no longer fit

515
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,200
Speaker 6:  it in your pocket. And, and, you know, Steve jobs had always said, oh, I

516
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,350
Speaker 6:  will never, never do a big phone. They're terrible. And it's the same thing.

517
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,070
Speaker 6:  He was like, I'll never do a touch Mac. And like, yeah, they just got to

518
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,560
Speaker 6:  go slow and then distract us with something else. I

519
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,140
Speaker 1:  Think Steve jobs actually, when he said that when I was ready to punch didn't

520
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,920
Speaker 1:  he have the alligator arms, he like put up a slide and he was

521
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,850
Speaker 1:  like, this will give you out like real arms, gorilla arms. That was an

522
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,810
Speaker 1:  animal. It was a type of animal arm that he thought was very bad. And

523
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,680
Speaker 1:  those animals are still to this day, very angry at apple. You'll never

524
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,310
Speaker 1:  see a crocodile using a Mac, just the fat

525
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:38,000
Speaker 4:  With the iPad. It's been 10 years of us saying, Hey, this screen is pretty

526
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,110
Speaker 4:  good. And this processor is pretty fast and you should, you should, you know,

527
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,680
Speaker 4:  you could do a lot more of this. And Apple's like, nah. And then a couple

528
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,620
Speaker 4:  of years ago, the iPad iOS are like, all right, here's the new system. Here's

529
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,310
Speaker 4:  how everything, the new windowing system it's. And I was like, so excited.

530
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,280
Speaker 4:  Cause apple finally let the iPad get complicated. It was just what needed

531
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,090
Speaker 4:  to happen in order to turn it into a computer that didn't feel like it was

532
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,050
Speaker 4:  like limiting you. And it's like, you're just, you're

533
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,040
Speaker 4:  waiting for them to finally do the thing that you've picked up, all

534
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,490
Speaker 4:  your hopes and dreams for it. I've been picked up over a decade. There just,

535
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,610
Speaker 4:  I think that they are actually really content with where the iPad is and

536
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,420
Speaker 4:  what the iPad is like to wit multi-user

537
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,170
Speaker 4:  support. Like if, if all they do is walk up on stage, I said, this last year,

538
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,900
Speaker 4:  if all they do is walk up and say, it's just say, here's the iPad. Here's

539
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,380
Speaker 4:  the login screen. Look, there's icons on it. One for you and one for your

540
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,680
Speaker 4:  kid. And then they walk off stage and that's the entire

541
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,340
Speaker 4:  iPad section done a plus five

542
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,680
Speaker 4:  stars.

543
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Speaker 1:  Yeah. They're going to dunk. They're going to announce like more home kit

544
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,210
Speaker 1:  automation features and said,

545
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,960
Speaker 5:  But so your point about like, we've been waiting a decade for

546
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,740
Speaker 5:  certain stuff. If you'd gone back five years and said that the iPad for

547
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Speaker 5:  mouse and keyboard support, I think most people would've been like, nah,

548
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,080
Speaker 5:  it's never going to happen. Or like, yeah, I want it. But like it's never

549
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,010
Speaker 5:  going to happen. And even apple was like at the time. No. And they did it

550
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,890
Speaker 5:  in their own unique way. So I think, I don't think that the iPads, if we

551
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,100
Speaker 5:  can run macro S or anything like that, but I feel like they will get to a

552
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,090
Speaker 5:  point where they will, the wind during is different. Like they've kind of

553
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,000
Speaker 5:  gone that way. It's, it's kind of very windows eight sort of hybrid at the

554
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,840
Speaker 5:  moment, but I think it'll get a bit more free flowing. Like it makes

555
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,830
Speaker 5:  sense if they allow you to run Mac up apps on there at some point

556
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,920
Speaker 5:  when they, when they just like to bridge gaps, that's what the iPad has been

557
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,700
Speaker 5:  doing for like 10 years. It's just slowly been bridging those gaps.

558
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,600
Speaker 5:  So I don't

559
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,350
Speaker 1:  Know. I feel like, look, air travel is coming back. A lot of

560
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:32,250
Speaker 1:  executives are going to need to do email in first class. Apple's got a

561
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,910
Speaker 1:  $2,000 computer that can solve that problem for you. They're just going to

562
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,940
Speaker 1:  sell a lot of them

563
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,840
Speaker 3:  That like,

564
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,830
Speaker 1:  I think they might just be happy with that. And that to me is like

565
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,230
Speaker 1:  across all these product lines. Right. We should talk about the watch next,

566
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,040
Speaker 1:  like apple faces. So little competition. I go back to that question of

567
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,730
Speaker 1:  like, who are they lifting from more? We're talking about one

568
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,450
Speaker 1:  operating system, Android that exists that they kind of live from all the

569
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,350
Speaker 1:  time. But even the pace of that back and forth has slowed.

570
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,920
Speaker 1:  And then we're talking about two dead operating systems like apple. So like,

571
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,190
Speaker 1:  I don't know whether the last 70 ideas let's use some of those. Like, there's

572
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,580
Speaker 1:  not a lot of like pressure to

573
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,390
Speaker 1:  innovate in a lot of these spaces anymore. And then in particular

574
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,170
Speaker 1:  with the watch and with the iPad, where are they feeling any

575
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,130
Speaker 1:  heat at all right. It's just like only from within, does apple

576
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,850
Speaker 1:  feel the pressure to make something better? It's good and lucky that

577
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,480
Speaker 1:  apple seems to feel a lot of that pressure all the time. Like that's the

578
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,690
Speaker 1:  company, that's their DNA. I think that just should be commended for that.

579
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,180
Speaker 1:  They're not lazy with the products, even though they have these monopoly

580
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,980
Speaker 1:  positions, but like there's a reason the is moving a lot

581
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,670
Speaker 1:  slower than it did with Steve jobs. Once I remember, like years ago, he got

582
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,600
Speaker 1:  on a quarterly results call and did like a 10

583
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,230
Speaker 1:  minute rant, about seven inch Android tablets. Like he was fired

584
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,680
Speaker 1:  up about seven inch Android tablets. He's like, this is the wrong size or

585
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,320
Speaker 1:  broken. And it's because Google was going to do like the nexus seven or whatever.

586
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,090
Speaker 1:  Like I guarantee you that no apple executive has thought about it. An Android

587
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,990
Speaker 1:  tablet in any capacity, except Amazon sells cheap. One for

588
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,470
Speaker 1:  kids. And apple would prefer that you just gave your old iPad to a

589
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,380
Speaker 1:  kid. But

590
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,110
Speaker 5:  I think all of that speaks to the maturity of particularly the iPhone, but

591
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,290
Speaker 5:  obviously the iPad's pretty mature now as well. And I think if they're going

592
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,800
Speaker 5:  to, if the high frame is going to face any sort of competition of than, you

593
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,640
Speaker 5:  know, whatever Google does, an Android is going to be foldable

594
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,450
Speaker 5:  stuff. And like, we're like if we ever get to the point where you're folding

595
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,050
Speaker 5:  these things out and using them as actual computers, then there has to be

596
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,770
Speaker 5:  the flexibility of the operating system and whatever else. But

597
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,700
Speaker 5:  again, we're probably years out from that ever being a reality. So

598
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,660
Speaker 5:  until that's the case, yeah. They just have to slowly pitch the

599
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,470
Speaker 5:  gaps.

600
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,650
Speaker 6:  I'm still holding out for an Android E ink

601
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,610
Speaker 6:  tablet that can play a video it's going to happen. And

602
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,570
Speaker 6:  then an Apple's going to be like, oh my gosh. And just

603
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,470
Speaker 6:  going to be absolutely wrecked by that first beautiful tablet. You

604
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,070
Speaker 6:  won't be able to read anything in it. It's going to be great. That's two

605
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,520
Speaker 6:  frames a

606
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,400
Speaker 1:  Second. Your mind, this is a black and white. It's like you're watching a

607
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,250
Speaker 1:  silent films,

608
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,550
Speaker 6:  Get a, cult-like give it two or three years. We're going to have the

609
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,390
Speaker 6:  perfect iPad replacement. And everybody's going to be going and

610
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,690
Speaker 6:  buying their E ink tablets that are like 13 inches

611
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,350
Speaker 6:  wide lasts for four weeks on a charge. Can't play

612
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,110
Speaker 6:  video, but look fabulous

613
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,920
Speaker 5:  And they'll call it the career.

614
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,550
Speaker 4:  I mean, that scenario is more likely than genuine competitive pressure on

615
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,880
Speaker 4:  the apple watch. Like they're getting massive version of watch over us. And

616
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,450
Speaker 4:  I, I honestly, they're not going to give us custom, watch

617
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,570
Speaker 4:  faces behind what, you know, they'll add like 10 more watch faces to it.

618
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,500
Speaker 4:  There'll be 13 different ways to like track your workouts that

619
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,190
Speaker 4:  are new. And I don't know what else is left because

620
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,070
Speaker 4:  there's nothing for them to like get

621
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,330
Speaker 4:  straight.

622
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,090
Speaker 1:  No, they're going to merge it with Tyson. They're

623
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,960
Speaker 3:  Like, we are also merging our platform with Tyson. The thing

624
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,250
Speaker 3:  happening in wearables

625
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,910
Speaker 4:  Is Amazon has a wrist strap that will tone

626
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,870
Speaker 4:  police you.

627
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,260
Speaker 3:  Right? What are they worried about in the

628
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,040
Speaker 3:  world?

629
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah, we are facing small, tiny

630
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,840
Speaker 6:  bits of competition from companies like aura ring and a lot of

631
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,200
Speaker 6:  these companies that are going that health rat and the, and the, the, the

632
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,980
Speaker 6:  further those companies go down that health route. Like the first time somebody

633
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,940
Speaker 6:  gets glucose monitoring on your wrist, like

634
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,870
Speaker 6:  apple is going to be scrambling to buy all those patents. So

635
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,790
Speaker 6:  I can also get cookies monitoring the wrist, like, like there's

636
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,540
Speaker 6:  competition there, but it's, it's less than like the fun kind of like

637
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,960
Speaker 6:  user experience and much more in like the, how much more of your medical

638
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,830
Speaker 6:  data can we put in front of your eyeballs on a given

639
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,700
Speaker 6:  day.

640
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,350
Speaker 1:  Right. And then also, I mean, they're airing cool product people really like

641
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,860
Speaker 1:  it. There's been studies about the data it produces and how it can be

642
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,850
Speaker 1:  helpful. It's super interesting to use one. You need to run an app on

643
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,230
Speaker 1:  your phone

644
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,310
Speaker 3:  Because the app store, like, if you

645
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,040
Speaker 1:  Can just be like, no, what are the orange didn't update its app for a couple

646
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,550
Speaker 1:  of weeks. Y'all like, that's a, it's a weird dynamic that they have where

647
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,210
Speaker 1:  all these ancillary products also have to filter through the phone

648
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:21,140
Speaker 1:  for maybe not the primary user interface. Cause it's like a piece of hardware,

649
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,860
Speaker 1:  but a very important secondary user interface that includes

650
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,610
Speaker 1:  setting it up for the first time. And like, yeah, I think,

651
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,640
Speaker 1:  I think that level of control across the broader ecosystem is interesting

652
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,130
Speaker 1:  to think about that said, I couldn't tell you what they should do at the

653
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,010
Speaker 1:  watch at this point in time. Like, what do I need, watch us to do?

654
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:41,000
Speaker 1:  Like, maybe I'm thinking like maybe

655
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,870
Speaker 1:  the walkie-talkie feature, it could be slightly faster. I would take that.

656
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,660
Speaker 1:  I use my wife and I used to, I could take a feature like everyday

657
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,590
Speaker 5:  I would like different vibration sayings for different notifications and

658
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,460
Speaker 5:  stuff like that. Like, cause there are, but like, there's not a way

659
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,160
Speaker 5:  for developers to set that

660
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,820
Speaker 6:  Better access to using home automations and

661
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,120
Speaker 6:  stuff. Like I would like to be able to, you can do it from your watch, but

662
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,080
Speaker 6:  it's miserable. It's just the worst experience

663
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,020
Speaker 6:  in the world. And I would like to just be able to look at it and be like,

664
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,620
Speaker 6:  I'm going to turn off the lights and tap my wrist and the lights are off.

665
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,610
Speaker 6:  You're supposed to ask Siri. I do. And she does

666
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,610
Speaker 6:  it, but sometimes I want to, I just want to touch it. I don't want to have

667
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,160
Speaker 6:  to shout it through my house. Yeah. See, see

668
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,790
Speaker 5:  What if it learned that it was 10:00 PM at night and that you did that. So

669
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,760
Speaker 5:  when you swipe down from the top, that was just an option.

670
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,190
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

671
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,880
Speaker 6:  I will allow it. Yeah.

672
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,600
Speaker 1:  By the way, it does. It should not have to learn that it's 10:00 PM at night,

673
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,940
Speaker 3:  Like that does not require AI

674
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,150
Speaker 4:  One controls. Where does that? It like shows up my, my night automations

675
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,600
Speaker 4:  at night. Like, it's pretty good about that. But I would say like talking

676
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,350
Speaker 4:  about home gadgets, like the rumor is that they might introduce homo S maybe

677
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,190
Speaker 4:  they'll like convert the, both the home pod and the apple TV

678
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,030
Speaker 4:  to run this renamed thing. It's flip on

679
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,720
Speaker 4:  that thread radio later this year matter, which

680
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,710
Speaker 4:  is the used to be called chip, which I used to call choice, which has a

681
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,490
Speaker 4:  connected home over IP, a smart home thing, which is basically HomeKit, but

682
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,300
Speaker 4:  everybody can use it as like launching. So it's possible

683
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,020
Speaker 4:  that we could see apple, like actually try really

684
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,500
Speaker 4:  hard with home kit in a way that I feel like it

685
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,490
Speaker 4:  hasn't. And because it was really limiting and it was very hard to

686
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:29,180
Speaker 4:  find home kit devices for awhile. And they've slowly been opening that

687
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,140
Speaker 4:  door. And some maybe, maybe we'll see like a big push

688
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,640
Speaker 4:  there and that that'll be one of the big surprises that Apple's

689
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,480
Speaker 4:  actually going to try and take on Alexa when it comes to smart home

690
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,280
Speaker 4:  stuff.

691
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,820
Speaker 6:  I think they absolutely can, especially when you see stuff like

692
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,690
Speaker 6:  sidewalk happening and there's more and more conversations about

693
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,650
Speaker 6:  how intrusive Amazon and Google have gotten in the home.

694
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,040
Speaker 6:  Apple has positioned itself for years as this big privacy

695
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,970
Speaker 6:  protector. And now it can say like, yeah, we like you

696
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,360
Speaker 6:  can control your whole smart home and not have to sell all of your

697
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,290
Speaker 6:  data to, to, you know, give it all away. Like I think, I

698
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,650
Speaker 6:  think that's something very doable and there's not a lot of competition.

699
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,280
Speaker 6:  Like Samsung smart things was probably one of the biggest competitors and

700
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,180
Speaker 6:  it still exists. But like people love shored things. Yeah. I

701
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,020
Speaker 6:  loved it. I used it for years and I moved into a new house and I

702
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,680
Speaker 6:  made the switch to HomeKit just to like, see how good if HomeKit could

703
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,640
Speaker 6:  work. And I will never go back. It's like, yes,

704
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,600
Speaker 6:  I had to program all of my lights in home kit instead of the hue app

705
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,260
Speaker 6:  and all this other stuff. But it just like, it did exactly what I needed

706
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,770
Speaker 6:  it to do. And I think if they actually give it some

707
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,630
Speaker 6:  more, if you have stronger automations and,

708
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,910
Speaker 6:  and just people can program that stuff a little better than it currently

709
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:51,660
Speaker 6:  is like, yeah. There's no reason it

710
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,080
Speaker 6:  couldn't just dominate in, in this kind of budget, smart home

711
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,070
Speaker 1:  Area. Yeah. Yeah. Can I say the nerdiest thing about smart things? Yes.

712
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,880
Speaker 1:  Do you know the sleeper smart things product is the absolute sleeper.

713
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,540
Speaker 1:  It's the wifi router. It's good. The Samsung smart things, wifi

714
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,410
Speaker 1:  router. They didn't make it themselves. They licensed all the tech

715
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,280
Speaker 1:  from plume, which is like one of the, the new

716
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,770
Speaker 1:  wifi companies plume sold itself to Comcast

717
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,430
Speaker 1:  disclosure. God,

718
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:24,410
Speaker 1:  <inaudible> whatever they licensed attack. And so

719
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:28,380
Speaker 1:  what the plume app lets you do is assign

720
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,530
Speaker 1:  devices to V lands so they can only see certain other

721
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,310
Speaker 1:  devices. So you can bracket all of your

722
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,240
Speaker 1:  smart home stuff on one virtual network. And

723
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,870
Speaker 1:  then like only let certain people see it in your house or only let certain

724
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,780
Speaker 1:  device to see one another. So if you, for

725
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,590
Speaker 1:  example, desire to control your garage doors with a

726
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,460
Speaker 1:  very dodgy, smart garage door openings and stuff, you can

727
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,640
Speaker 1:  hide it away from the rest of your network so that it can't send it out.

728
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,730
Speaker 1:  And it's like, it's absolutely the sleeper on. Cause we buy a

729
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,450
Speaker 1:  plume, you got to pay a monthly fee, a subscription fee, but

730
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,960
Speaker 1:  Samsung just like covers it. It's just free. So there's an entire

731
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,890
Speaker 1:  like underground community of smart things. Router, her people were

732
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,920
Speaker 1:  like, we're getting away with it. Y'all

733
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,880
Speaker 3:  It's very good. You just call them out.

734
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,670
Speaker 3:  You're going to ruin it. It's over. I think

735
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:24,570
Speaker 1:  That when people know that they signed this deal,

736
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:28,410
Speaker 1:  but like, that's like come back to like apple and HomeKit and it's

737
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,280
Speaker 1:  like, it is wild that Samsung makes that product

738
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,260
Speaker 1:  and they make an entire range of smart things. Things

739
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,160
Speaker 1:  not to mention washers and dryers and refrigerators,

740
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,850
Speaker 1:  right? Like Samsung has this huge product range that can't

741
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,690
Speaker 1:  quite integrate, but you could see how it could work. Apple's

742
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,020
Speaker 1:  like, I dunno, choice y'all want some

743
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,540
Speaker 1:  choice.

744
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,290
Speaker 5:  Well maybe Homarus is around her memory nap. We used to do those.

745
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:00,250
Speaker 6:  Oh Ooh. My dad still uses his. He has not

746
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,370
Speaker 6:  replaced it in 45 years. Yeah, we

747
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,330
Speaker 4:  Actually we're. We just moved in. I was unpacking a random box and there

748
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,170
Speaker 4:  was an airport just like, it was like what? Oh my God, I

749
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,130
Speaker 4:  want to just use it. Okay. Macko S what do you, what do you want from

750
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,210
Speaker 4:  echo S I hope

751
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,610
Speaker 1:  They D ugly big, sir. It's all that I

752
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:22,270
Speaker 1:  want. Just try again. Just be

753
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,930
Speaker 1:  like, we made this thing that looks like you should touch it. We keep

754
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,710
Speaker 1:  insisting that you shouldn't touch it. And it instead looks like Disney

755
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,640
Speaker 1:  world. And we're just going to turn that. Maybe they're just bridging the

756
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,510
Speaker 1:  gaps. I

757
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,960
Speaker 1:  think it sounds so evil. It's like is playing risk with all of

758
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,880
Speaker 3:  Computing, like slowly

759
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,160
Speaker 3:  advancing

760
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,150
Speaker 6:  Love them to take the little X in a notification and make

761
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,550
Speaker 6:  it a big X. If your

762
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,030
Speaker 4:  Notifications in macro S we don't run these

763
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,960
Speaker 4:  offerings so bad, the notifications in the back

764
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,280
Speaker 4:  of us are terrible

765
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,490
Speaker 1:  And they they've gotten worse with everything they've done up in the corner.

766
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,030
Speaker 1:  Just

767
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,240
Speaker 6:  Go find growl. What's left of growl by

768
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,630
Speaker 6:  it and just put it on there and done. And I'll be fine.

769
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,500
Speaker 1:  Raul is a deep cut. So for most of

770
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,840
Speaker 1:  our listeners

771
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,800
Speaker 3:  In the early two

772
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,400
Speaker 1:  Thousands growl was an open source notification framework for

773
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,390
Speaker 1:  Mac O S. It was actually called OSM back then. And like, all

774
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,520
Speaker 1:  the actual offers were like, that's great. We'll use it. And they'll just

775
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,270
Speaker 1:  use it. And then apple built its own notification system that

776
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,140
Speaker 1:  is oddly used and growl faded away. Right. So you're

777
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,240
Speaker 1:  saying go find the remnants of growl.

778
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,970
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like give that guy $5.

779
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,410
Speaker 1:  His name is John

780
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,850
Speaker 1:  rowel,

781
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,930
Speaker 6:  George, George Brown.

782
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,900
Speaker 6:  Like just, just buy it from him. I would love to be able to put my

783
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,890
Speaker 6:  notifications on the one part of my screen. I never go to, rather

784
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,790
Speaker 6:  than the part where, like, it always covers up all of my slacks with

785
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,020
Speaker 6:  other slacks.

786
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,890
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think <inaudible> with, they're able to make

787
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,790
Speaker 1:  new form factors to the max. I think big Sur predated those form factors.

788
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,420
Speaker 1:  Like now looking at big Sur, you can see it's

789
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,080
Speaker 1:  big and colorful and bright. It was like, they knew, they knew the new

790
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,840
Speaker 1:  MNI Macs are coming and they've gotten an aesthetic or hardware, software

791
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,830
Speaker 1:  aesthetic for those computers. There is a rumor of a new MacBook pro theirs.

792
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,010
Speaker 1:  It's obvious they're going to update all the other computers along the way.

793
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,780
Speaker 1:  There's some leaks about the chips they're going to put in Mac pros and how

794
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,710
Speaker 1:  many cores they have. Like, they've got an entire cycle of

795
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,460
Speaker 1:  Mac redesigns coming. And I think maca less has to go with it, like

796
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,940
Speaker 1:  go for that ride. But I couldn't tell you that, like right now, what Mac

797
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,780
Speaker 1:  listen, like, we're going to get an interminable demo of like

798
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,590
Speaker 1:  safari cookie blocking or something, right? Like that's where they're at

799
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:56,340
Speaker 1:  with Mac iOS. They need to add more features to it. And like the big

800
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,700
Speaker 1:  feature that everybody wants is a touch screen and they don't want to do

801
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,390
Speaker 1:  it. Tom say bridging the gap again, bridging the

802
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,230
Speaker 1:  gap. I'm sitting here in

803
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:10,160
Speaker 1:  10 years.

804
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,400
Speaker 1:  Do we think we're going to get a New Mexico press? Oh, a hundred

805
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,300
Speaker 1:  percent.

806
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,960
Speaker 4:  Oh God. I just don't. I don't want to set myself up for

807
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,680
Speaker 4:  disappointment cause I want it so bad. Here's here's the thing. I

808
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,010
Speaker 4:  there's a bunch of rumors or some analysts saying that it'll happen. John

809
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:28,610
Speaker 4:  Prosser says it will happen. But if they're going to introduce new macro

810
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:32,600
Speaker 4:  pros, they have to introduce new processors. And that entire

811
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,230
Speaker 4:  experience of new MacBook pros justifying the

812
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,770
Speaker 4:  return of ports, because that's the rumor there's going to be

813
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,490
Speaker 4:  ports again, my God and explaining how fast the

814
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,090
Speaker 4:  processor is. Apple will never do that in less than 45

815
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,660
Speaker 4:  minutes, maybe half an hour. Right? I mean, they knew they move faster in

816
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,020
Speaker 4:  these, like in this online world, but for them to

817
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,530
Speaker 4:  cram new version of our hot shit processor, that's faster than anything

818
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,400
Speaker 4:  else and brought parts back. And there's an all new design and

819
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,430
Speaker 4:  this is computer that everybody is truly waiting

820
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,270
Speaker 4:  for. They're not going to cram that in at like, you know, a 10 minute

821
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,400
Speaker 4:  segment of WWDC

822
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,390
Speaker 6:  One. They absolutely should because I too need this, this

823
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,260
Speaker 6:  Mac book pro mine's the 26 key to original touch

824
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,800
Speaker 6:  bar monstrosity. And I'm on my third one,

825
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,790
Speaker 6:  but you know, I think the processor, so for the last couple of years, they've

826
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,250
Speaker 6:  spent so much time talking about processors. And I think it was less about

827
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,180
Speaker 6:  like telling us about processors and more about like hyping their, their

828
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,170
Speaker 6:  abilities in the space. And at this point they've kind of like shown they

829
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,770
Speaker 6:  can do it, right? Like if, if all they're doing is a little, you know, a

830
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:43,140
Speaker 6:  talk for the tick, that was the <inaudible> and

831
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,250
Speaker 6:  <inaudible> is just a couple additional

832
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,940
Speaker 6:  cores and slightly less power efficiency. Like I think they can

833
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,480
Speaker 6:  communicate that pretty quickly and, and be like, all they have to do is

834
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,330
Speaker 6:  be like, it's going to be like the old Mac book pro two more

835
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,660
Speaker 6:  cores.

836
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,870
Speaker 1:  I feel like sync over the ports is a thing they will absolutely do. They'll

837
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,800
Speaker 1:  be like, yeah. Now applaud for this SD card reader.

838
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,980
Speaker 1:  And then literally you'll hear the applause around the world in a virtual,

839
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,580
Speaker 1:  even on a virtual event. I know they bumped the USB-C to

840
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,420
Speaker 1:  support more power recently, but I I'm sitting here with a

841
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,290
Speaker 1:  16 inch MacBook pro and a hundred watt USBC charger. And this

842
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,920
Speaker 1:  thing often does not charge well, it is often still

843
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,880
Speaker 1:  drawing too much power for this gigantic hundred watt brick.

844
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,740
Speaker 1:  And I plug anything else in the brick it's like game over. So

845
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,800
Speaker 1:  I think one of the reasons to bring the ports back is they might as well

846
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,980
Speaker 1:  just have a dedicated power adapter like USBC. And I know

847
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,970
Speaker 1:  that, but it's true. Like if they need, if they need to

848
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,930
Speaker 1:  put 90 Watts into some ultra powerful M series

849
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,930
Speaker 1:  chip, then like you might as well have a dedicated power

850
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,970
Speaker 1:  adapter.

851
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,690
Speaker 6:  It's going to be a powerful chip. I think it's not going to be as powerful

852
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,680
Speaker 6:  as like the big power users want it to be. Right. Like, I don't think

853
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,550
Speaker 6:  it's going to be the thing that every, like all the video programmers and

854
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,420
Speaker 6:  audio producers and stuff, just Chuck out their 16 inch and go

855
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,600
Speaker 6:  get, I think they're going to, like, I think it's, it's going to be less

856
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,590
Speaker 6:  powerful than that because apple is going to wait until that

857
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,980
Speaker 6:  big Mac pro to really show off like how good it is at

858
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,910
Speaker 6:  processing. But I think, I think it's like, I think this is going to be

859
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:24,600
Speaker 6:  kind of their half step between the Mac book air, like, right. This is just

860
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,260
Speaker 6:  the little step up of like slightly more powerful, slightly more

861
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,040
Speaker 6:  power hungry and look a nicer, bigger screen and

862
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,270
Speaker 6:  ports.

863
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,870
Speaker 1:  I know, I think that they already have that in the 13 inch MacBook pro, which

864
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,680
Speaker 1:  is like, what if this computer had a fan? Yeah. Right. And then the

865
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,370
Speaker 1:  16 inch pro. And if they do a 14 inch pro, which I think is one of the

866
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,480
Speaker 1:  whispers and the Hamilton

867
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,310
Speaker 5:  And 16 of the rim is like,

868
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,970
Speaker 1:  Those are that's their like bread and butter pro machine. Those things have

869
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,930
Speaker 1:  to be fast. So I don't know. We'll see. I just think that they ran into

870
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:58,920
Speaker 1:  the Ooh, USBC was a mistake. We might've sold put a

871
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,760
Speaker 1:  power port back on here. Cause we need to pull that much power from a

872
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,560
Speaker 1:  dedicated USBC brick. They can,

873
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,710
Speaker 5:  They can be like, what they did with the Mac approach is like, you know,

874
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,160
Speaker 5:  we heard you, this is what we've got sort of thing. Yeah. Like they can,

875
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,910
Speaker 5:  they can do that. I don't know. Yeah. I'm like with diva there, I'm not

876
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,250
Speaker 5:  sure whether they have enough time to cram it

877
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,410
Speaker 5:  in.

878
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,080
Speaker 1:  I mean, based on our preview here, they could be like, watch it last. Like

879
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,540
Speaker 1:  whatever nothing happened on his

880
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,320
Speaker 1:  back, we are at an

881
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,660
Speaker 1:  hour in. We need to take a break and talk about the next version of

882
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,410
Speaker 1:  windows. I will say. I doubt anything of note is

883
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:37,710
Speaker 1:  happening in TBOs because all of Apple's efforts, aren't getting the apple

884
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,250
Speaker 1:  TV app on other platforms, including the Nvidia

885
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,550
Speaker 1:  shield. Huh? See positive shield

886
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,450
Speaker 1:  mentioned. Think about that before you send your emails and the rest of Android

887
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:52,350
Speaker 1:  TV. It, that seems where their efforts are. They just released

888
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:56,190
Speaker 1:  new box Criswell trivia. The new box through new remote is great. You

889
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,090
Speaker 1:  should buy it. And it's amazing. Apple can get another $70

890
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:04,050
Speaker 1:  out of me if we can. Entire Google TV is 50 bucks. So

891
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,840
Speaker 1:  because, okay, we're gonna take a break. We'll be right back talking about

892

938
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,100
Speaker 1:  number? That's what I want to know. So

939
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,890
Speaker 5:  You want it to be windows 12 or when there's

940
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:57,520
Speaker 5:  13? I think I can exclusively reveal the

941
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,120
Speaker 5:  name. Okay. This is a Vergecast it's clear. So it's gonna be windows

942
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,440
Speaker 5:  nine. It's going to go back

943
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,940
Speaker 5:  to

944
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,730
Speaker 5:  the one they missed. Yeah. But when they let it get

945
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,510
Speaker 5:  away, but yeah, like it

946
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:17,350
Speaker 5:  looks like it's going to be windows 11. I think that's at least that's what

947
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,430
Speaker 5:  Microsoft wants us to

948
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,340
Speaker 1:  Think. Okay. So it's going to be windows 20.

949
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,820
Speaker 4:  How are they going to justify saying just kidding. When we said we're never

950
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,720
Speaker 4:  going have a new version of windows as could be windows 10 forever, whatever

951
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,920
Speaker 4:  we promise. Wait,

952
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,570
Speaker 1:  Hold on. I have an idea. Open windows,

953
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,380
Speaker 1:  2000.

954
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,700
Speaker 5:  I see. I see. I think he's gonna, it's going to go one of two ways, right?

955
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,470
Speaker 5:  It's going to be one of freeways. It's going to be windows, windows, or

956
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:43,310
Speaker 5:  living or windows free six, five. Oh my God. Or

957
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,050
Speaker 5:  some fit or something. You know, like windows

958
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,590
Speaker 5:  series,

959
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,210
Speaker 5:  windows series. X-Box

960
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:54,470
Speaker 5:  confident that the, the name or branding

961
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:57,020
Speaker 1:  Around this is Xbox live colon

962
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:00,980
Speaker 1:  windows.

963
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,160
Speaker 4:  Oh, it's it's it's going to be, it's going to be Azure intelligent edge

964
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,500
Speaker 4:  iOS.

965
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:06,770
Speaker 3:  Okay.

966
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,590
Speaker 1:  So what do we know about windows a windows

967
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,210
Speaker 1:  2000?

968
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:15,110
Speaker 5:  Well, windows 2000 came, so windows 11. So, so they've

969
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:18,650
Speaker 5:  put out, they've been teasing us for months. So panel said the next

970
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:22,460
Speaker 5:  generation back ignite such in Adela even just a week

971
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,450
Speaker 5:  ago, said like this is gonna be the biggest change to windows in like a decade

972
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,780
Speaker 5:  and the next generation of windows. And then they put out this

973
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,680
Speaker 5:  invite, which is basically, it's just saying, we're talking about the next

974
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,580
Speaker 5:  generation of the windows, but also alongside at

975
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,450
Speaker 5:  the invite has like a, sort of a shadow light pulling

976
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:45,110
Speaker 5:  through the window, but it doesn't have the vertical bars at the horizontal

977
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:48,980
Speaker 5:  bars. Right. So it just looks like it's the shadows creeping in so

978
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,760
Speaker 5:  11 and nine <inaudible> maybe not

979
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,700
Speaker 5:  like, you know, everyone overanalyzes apple invites. So like

980
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,300
Speaker 5:  whatever the event starts at 11:00 AM

981
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,170
Speaker 5:  of surface and windows events never usually start at that time. It's usually

982
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:06,980
Speaker 5:  like nine or 10:00 AM. So it's kind of could be

983
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,950
Speaker 5:  confidential. And then one of the mitotic sets is put on

984
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:13,940
Speaker 5:  Twitter. I'm lucky. Can't wait for this new version of windows. So

985
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,330
Speaker 5:  no, I've not heard them say a new version of windows. Like that's

986
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,330
Speaker 5:  different language than they've used. They've always said the next generation

987
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:23,990
Speaker 5:  of windows, whatever that means. So I think that combining those three

988
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:27,830
Speaker 5:  things together is why I think there's gonna be some sort of naming

989
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:30,560
Speaker 5:  happening here, like a new, a new windows name.

990
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,650
Speaker 1:  What does a new windows name mean? So as Dieter was saying, when they did

991
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,960
Speaker 1:  windows 10, they're like, we're just gonna update windows 10 forever. This

992
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,830
Speaker 1:  is that. Here we are. What does it mean to have a new name? Is it

993
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:43,610
Speaker 1:  signifying a strategy shift? Is it a new product, a new interface?

994
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,600
Speaker 5:  Yes. I think, I think the new name probably signifies a bit more

995
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,590
Speaker 5:  of a reinvestment in windows. So these, they split up windows into two parts

996
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:55,490
Speaker 5:  internally a few years ago and then panel sort of came on

997
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:59,120
Speaker 5:  board and then the pandemic kit and like that combination of like

998
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,690
Speaker 5:  penicillin taken over windows and the pandemic, the resurgence of like

999
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,260
Speaker 5:  PC computing. Cause people see trying to work from

1000
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,830
Speaker 5:  home that has made them think, oh, actually, you know, there are still like

1001
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:13,010
Speaker 5:  wherever it is 1.3 billion people using this operating system every day.

1002
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,890
Speaker 5:  So we should probably fix things

1003
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,810
Speaker 3:  Like make it a bit better,

1004
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:21,530
Speaker 5:  Make it like look better and stuff. So I think it's the opportunity of

1005
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:24,430
Speaker 5:  doing all that, fixing up work, a new

1006
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,270
Speaker 5:  UI and all that sort of stuff is probably just led them to the point of

1007
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:31,570
Speaker 5:  like, we should just call it this something different. You know, like they

1008
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,080
Speaker 5:  were trying this thing called windows 10 X. It was going to be on

1009
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,800
Speaker 5:  Juul screen devices before the pandemic hit. And then they were like, we're

1010
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,980
Speaker 5:  going to put it on single screen devices. And then they were like, you know

1011
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,590
Speaker 5:  what, we're just going to take all of the work that we did on that. Like

1012
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:48,190
Speaker 5:  the good UI work and a good bits of like reorganizing windows,

1013
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,460
Speaker 5:  essentially making it a bit more lightweight and we're going to put it into

1014
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,940
Speaker 5:  windows. And I think that's what this is. So like a lot of that work. So

1015
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,540
Speaker 5:  it's, it's basically consists of like free things. It's like you, I

1016
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,080
Speaker 5:  work new store and it's some rumors about that. We can get into

1017
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:06,070
Speaker 5:  that. And then the final thing is, is basically

1018
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:09,850
Speaker 5:  I try and I just completely lost my train of thought, but yeah, new

1019
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:13,660
Speaker 5:  store, new UI and like a more of an opportunity for app developers, I

1020
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,500
Speaker 5:  think, and like opening up a little bit. I think

1021
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,950
Speaker 5:  probably bringing some of the walls of the store down will help with that

1022
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,260
Speaker 1:  Because they want to be in that app distribution game. Like

1023
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah, like they have realized, I think I've had like conversations with

1024
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,920
Speaker 5:  panels in the past. Like when you, when you took over from windows site,

1025
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,670
Speaker 5:  like conversations with him in briefings about windows and like

1026
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,660
Speaker 5:  expressing like the way that I see windows and other people who use it

1027
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,590
Speaker 5:  frequently says that it's like a tool, right? It's the, it is like, you

1028
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,100
Speaker 5:  know, a productivity tool or whatever. But I think a lot of the time they've

1029
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,730
Speaker 5:  been chasing like the wrong set of people for it. Like they did this creators

1030
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:52,360
Speaker 5:  update, they tried to create to go for that group of people that didn't really

1031
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,140
Speaker 5:  work out and he keep, they kept, they've constantly be trying to chase

1032
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,130
Speaker 5:  growth for windows rather than just realize that it's valuable

1033
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:03,860
Speaker 5:  to a lot of people and that they can improve it and build upon it, fix

1034
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,840
Speaker 5:  things that will make it more valuable to those people rather than having

1035
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,660
Speaker 5:  to, you know, add another a hundred million people using it or

1036
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:14,620
Speaker 5:  whatever. So I think that they have finally come to realize

1037
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,210
Speaker 5:  that and perhaps a lot of that's to do with the pandemic learnings and stuff

1038
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:22,060
Speaker 1:  And the absolute growth in PC sales. Right. I mean, it's like

1039
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,090
Speaker 1:  explosive growth in PC sales.

1040
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:27,990
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And like OEMs have obviously seen them experiment with these versions

1041
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:31,710
Speaker 5:  of windows over the years, like 10 S and 10 X was another

1042
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:35,490
Speaker 5:  experiment. And like they've been waiting for like, for OEMs having a

1043
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:39,210
Speaker 5:  different name windows like a, a version that they can

1044
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:42,540
Speaker 5:  sell attached to hardware. It's like a gold mine for them. Cause like, it's,

1045
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,110
Speaker 5:  it just immediately generates like hype and interest in products like, oh,

1046
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,800
Speaker 5:  there's a new word windows working, oh, I should get a new laptop. Like it

1047
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,670
Speaker 5:  triggers, you know, consumer spending and all that sort of stuff. And

1048
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,720
Speaker 5:  obviously on the enterprise as

1049
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,840
Speaker 1:  Well. Do you think we just want to be able to reuse the letters or like,

1050
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,680
Speaker 1:  oh, we want to do another S windows 11

1051
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,490
Speaker 1:  S it is. Cause I mean, that, that strategy was to,

1052
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,160
Speaker 1:  to apply in SIFY windows.

1053
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,310
Speaker 4:  Well, so it was also to take on Chromebooks. Right. And so if they're, yeah,

1054
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:15,000
Speaker 4:  if they, they've never succeeded at making there's the S

1055
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,750
Speaker 4:  mode, you know, they've never really succeeded at making like a light

1056
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:22,130
Speaker 4:  version of windows. Do you think they're giving up on that dream or is it

1057
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,480
Speaker 4:  that somehow part of this? I think that's

1058
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,020
Speaker 5:  Part of this. I think like some of it is obviously making it a bit more lightweight,

1059
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:32,740
Speaker 5:  the UX improvements, but I think the tennis stuff was more than just competing

1060
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,640
Speaker 5:  with Chrome iOS. It was also like control with the operating system

1061
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,450
Speaker 5:  who's taking that control back. And there's, there's many legitimate

1062
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:44,020
Speaker 5:  reasons to that. Like ransomware that we're seeing across the world happens

1063
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:47,950
Speaker 5:  on windows computers, because they're open blah, blah, blah. But the

1064
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:51,550
Speaker 5:  way they win ahead, they force people down a route where they'd have to package

1065
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:55,120
Speaker 5:  their apps into the store. It's very much like the iOS debate, right? Like

1066
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,480
Speaker 5:  apple has all the control over the app store. That's the control that Microsoft

1067
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,900
Speaker 5:  ultimately wanted wherever they wanted the same sort of control, who knows.

1068
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,890
Speaker 5:  But I think that was the primary driving driver there. And it's way like

1069
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,580
Speaker 5:  Tim Sweeney, he was dead against that sort of app model. And I think the

1070
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,580
Speaker 5:  realization with windows now is that that stuff is just not never really

1071
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,980
Speaker 5:  going to work for windows. They're never going to truly make it lightweight

1072
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,720
Speaker 5:  unless they just blow it up and do something totally new, which I guess 10

1073
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:23,110
Speaker 5:  X was like trying to go down that route by fixing the

1074
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:26,800
Speaker 5:  realization of like who uses windows and what this

1075
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,170
Speaker 5:  product is for. I think that's, that's, that's the main

1076
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:33,070
Speaker 1:  Thing. So they did the surface Neo and the duo at the same

1077
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:37,000
Speaker 1:  time, the duo runs Android. And they'd, you know,

1078
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,990
Speaker 1:  we heard all the stories about how they work with Android and Hiroshi at

1079
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:44,920
Speaker 1:  Google and pantos at, at Microsoft or like tweet and hearts. And he shared

1080
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,820
Speaker 1:  with her that product has like kind of gone nowhere. It was just

1081
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,210
Speaker 1:  deeply discounted. I seriously considered impulse buying one. And then I

1082
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:55,510
Speaker 1:  didn't because I was like, I don't, it's essentially a fire sale right now.

1083
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:59,500
Speaker 1:  I don't go anywhere. So I don't need another phone, the social one

1084
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,210
Speaker 1:  that flips over and do a slightly bigger fund maybe next year

1085
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:06,400
Speaker 1:  that's over there. And then the Neo was 10 X dual

1086
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,360
Speaker 1:  screen. And the entire story we heard was like, dual screens are the future

1087
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,290
Speaker 1:  of productivity. You want to do two things at once on a phone,

1088
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:17,620
Speaker 1:  you need to run two apps, the assignment side by side, over here, we're

1089
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:21,520
Speaker 1:  rearchitecting windows for dual screens. Once again,

1090
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,910
Speaker 1:  the future of productivity that appears to be out the window,

1091
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:28,270
Speaker 5:  Yes. Tastes totally out the window like that. They don't talk about the Niro

1092
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,720
Speaker 5:  at all anymore. Like he's basically a canceled product right now because

1093
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,510
Speaker 5:  the operating system that powers, it doesn't exist anymore. They're bringing

1094
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,730
Speaker 5:  that to windows. So what

1095
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:40,420
Speaker 6:  Happens to all those like laptops from the OEMs, because they were

1096
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:44,160
Speaker 6:  all kind of going all in on it too. And

1097
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,980
Speaker 5:  You really Lenovo really went all in and actually launched their X one,

1098
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,550
Speaker 5:  fold, ThinkPad, X pump fold, or whatever it was called. And that was supposed

1099
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:55,270
Speaker 5:  to come, you know, 10 X was gonna come to that. So I don't know what happens

1100
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:58,120
Speaker 5:  there, but I'm sure the two people that brought one,

1101
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,330
Speaker 5:  we're not going to be disappointed.

1102
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,780
Speaker 6:  Well, I know, because we saw, like we saw a Seuss, did like, they're there

1103
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,350
Speaker 6:  too. They're kind of dual monitor. And I think they're still doing it right.

1104
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,920
Speaker 6:  Where they have like the little monitor down at the bottom and stuff. And

1105
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,700
Speaker 6:  I know Dell kept saying they were going to, and then kind of stepped

1106
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,260
Speaker 6:  back and said, they're going to, and it just like, did they all just say,

1107
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,140
Speaker 6:  oh, the, the display technology and everything else that needs to be there

1108
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,620
Speaker 6:  just isn't there. And windows at the same time said,

1109
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,400
Speaker 6:  nah,

1110
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that sort of stuff is slightly different to the sort of windows, 10

1111
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,450
Speaker 5:  X stuff. So that was just like pure windows. And like, they were doing like

1112
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:37,380
Speaker 5:  custom OEM, like panels above the keyboard and stuff like that to, to

1113
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,280
Speaker 5:  power that. And like, they've those OEMs have experimented with that

1114
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,220
Speaker 5:  sort of stuff for years. So I think that stuff will still be there and we'll

1115
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,410
Speaker 5:  still see, I just don't, I don't think much is going to support it in like

1116
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,460
Speaker 5:  a big effort. Yeah.

1117
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:53,210
Speaker 1:  I, just, to me that what really drives the upgrade

1118
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:56,420
Speaker 1:  cycle is a form factor change. When we just, we know this

1119
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:00,200
Speaker 1:  thing, we even note inside of the iPhone, like the change, the way the iPhone

1120
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,270
Speaker 1:  looks, everybody buys a new iPhone. This is just happened with the iPhone

1121
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,780
Speaker 1:  12, even while lots of people were at home, lots of people bought iPhone

1122
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:09,500
Speaker 1:  12 because they looked different to me. It's like it is to me, the

1123
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,160
Speaker 1:  silliest, but most consistent thing I know about technology is if you want

1124
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,400
Speaker 1:  people to buy a new one, you just change the way it looks. It

1125
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,300
Speaker 1:  can. The iPod is like the example, like the

1126
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,880
Speaker 1:  iPod rarely got new functionality, but every year they made it look different.

1127
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,680
Speaker 1:  And I was like, I need a new iPad. And

1128
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,560
Speaker 5:  It's kind of like the reverse at the moment. Cause it's like, what's driving

1129
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,800
Speaker 5:  PC growth is the reverse, like people who are going from picking up their

1130
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,790
Speaker 5:  phones to being like, I need something to work on. Like I can't, I,

1131
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:38,330
Speaker 5:  you know, I usually have something in the office or at school or

1132
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:41,840
Speaker 5:  whatever, and I don't have that now. So I need, I need something. So it's

1133
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,110
Speaker 5:  like, it's still a form factor thing. That's driving it. But it's just the

1134
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:48,770
Speaker 5:  opposite way. Like we, we used to everyone buying mobile phones and just

1135
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,860
Speaker 5:  not really touching desktop PCs or laptops as

1136
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:55,790
Speaker 5:  frequently. And that's, that's driving this, this group at the

1137
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,630
Speaker 5:  moment who knows, once everything starts to go hybrid work or

1138
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:03,350
Speaker 5:  whatever you want to call it, how that shakes out. Like, I'm sure the growth

1139
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:07,310
Speaker 5:  will go away somewhat, but then do they pick

1140
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,120
Speaker 5:  that chore screen

1141
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,030
Speaker 1:  Stuff up? Yeah, Mike, that's what I'm saying. Microsoft was like gung ho

1142
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,780
Speaker 1:  on form factor change. Cause they thought they could crack back into the

1143
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,620
Speaker 1:  phone market and they could do something to juice the

1144
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:22,370
Speaker 1:  PC market and now they've dropped it cause they didn't, they kind of didn't

1145
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:26,150
Speaker 1:  need it. Like Monica, Shannon. I just interviewed the CEO of Acer. Acer just

1146
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:29,840
Speaker 1:  had its best quarter in years and they're just like making

1147
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,680
Speaker 1:  everything and we kept asking it like, w what's your bet?

1148
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,460
Speaker 1:  Like, is it Chromebooks? Is it windows on arm? Is it whatever? And he was

1149
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,700
Speaker 1:  like, yeah, we're just gonna make whatever, like everyone's buying everything.

1150
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,250
Speaker 1:  We're good.

1151
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They're in like that. It's, it's almost like the two

1152
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,360
Speaker 5:  thousands sort of era of PCs at the moment, just because there's such a demand

1153
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,350
Speaker 5:  for them, an unusual amount of demand. So Acer is

1154
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:56,420
Speaker 5:  definitely well-positioned for that sort of stuff, because they can just

1155
01:04:56,420 --> 01:05:00,380
Speaker 5:  experiment and people, people will buy it. But yeah,

1156
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:04,340
Speaker 5:  like the fact that Microsoft was, you know, it was basically putting

1157
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:08,030
Speaker 5:  its, its surface brand on the line here for like a Juul screen device and

1158
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:11,870
Speaker 5:  stuff. And it has obviously on the Android side, it's surprising

1159
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:15,530
Speaker 5:  that they dropped it so quick during the pandemic and they get, and I feel

1160
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:18,910
Speaker 5:  like they kind of used it as like, I don't want to say an excuse, but like

1161
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:21,970
Speaker 5:  it's definitely like, I don't think he was getting the way that they thought

1162
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:25,630
Speaker 5:  it was going to go the development cycle on it. So it was like, it was a

1163
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,470
Speaker 5:  good point in time for them to like, sort of say, okay, let's not do

1164
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,400
Speaker 5:  this right now. Let's focus more on windows.

1165
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,940
Speaker 5:  But yeah, like I'm curious to see where they go with that in the future.

1166
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:40,600
Speaker 5:  And there's like, there's rumors about like this windows 11 stuff that they

1167
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,260
Speaker 5:  might bring back some of the touch stuff that they kind of did

1168
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:47,950
Speaker 5:  widgets, seeing some stuff that flying around about

1169
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:51,670
Speaker 5:  that. I've got a feeling that they're doing quite a

1170
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:55,300
Speaker 5:  lot and a lot hasn't leaked. Cause they've, they've somehow managed to keep

1171
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:59,080
Speaker 5:  it very tight. So I feel like there's gonna be a lot, a

1172
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,160
Speaker 5:  lot that we won't know until the event. How extensive

1173
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,060
Speaker 6:  Is the user interface change going to be? Because like with

1174
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,840
Speaker 6:  windows 10, they did like a surface change and then

1175
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,770
Speaker 6:  you'd go to menus and, and you just be back in seven.

1176
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:17,580
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like I think a lot of it is cleaning up. Like they've been

1177
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:21,510
Speaker 5:  sort of working on this over the last sort of couple of years, like some

1178
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:25,290
Speaker 5:  of the icons staff, the system icons or all that sort of stuff, like

1179
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:29,160
Speaker 5:  cleaning up, you know, when you like open up a driver installation and then

1180
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,760
Speaker 5:  suddenly you feel like you're back in windows 95, like that should not be

1181
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,600
Speaker 5:  happening. So I think some of that will be going

1182
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,410
Speaker 5:  away and I'd hope that all of it goes away, but like I just can't see it

1183
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:44,010
Speaker 5:  all fully going away. And then it's like, there's a focus on like rounded

1184
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:48,000
Speaker 5:  corners, a new start menu, a lot of the stuff you saw in 10 X

1185
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,990
Speaker 5:  where they simplified like the fly outs and a task bar and like basic stuff

1186
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:55,410
Speaker 5:  like controlling volume, all that sort of stuff. It looks a bit more like

1187
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:59,400
Speaker 5:  mobile friendly, almost like a bit more tablet touch friendly as well.

1188
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,190
Speaker 5:  Cause I think they really stepped back from that stuff in windows 10.

1189
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:06,000
Speaker 1:  Well, because it went so badly with eight it's, like the pendulum is swinging,

1190
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,900
Speaker 1:  right. Like, and we just spent all this time talking about apple.

1191
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,350
Speaker 1:  Microsoft has a giant installed base of touchscreen pieces.

1192
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:16,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They've got a lot of data on how people actually use them. Right. And

1193
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,700
Speaker 5:  the things that they want to do with them, which is usually just like get

1194
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,890
Speaker 5:  that notification

1195
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:24,180
Speaker 3:  Or like,

1196
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:27,990
Speaker 5:  But yeah, like I'm curious to see where they go with that stuff. If they're

1197
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:31,530
Speaker 5:  bringing widgets back and let slide to bring in widgets and stuff like

1198
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:35,400
Speaker 5:  that, like, I dunno, I feel like they're going to add some stuff

1199
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,360
Speaker 5:  that a lot of people are just going to turn off. Right. But I hope

1200
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,350
Speaker 5:  that they get to the point where they don't have to do stuff like force edge

1201
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:47,130
Speaker 5:  down your throat or force being down your throat. And some of those sort

1202
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:51,090
Speaker 5:  of businessy decisions that they tried to do to obviously, you

1203
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,340
Speaker 5:  know, make things seem

1204
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,040
Speaker 5:  relevant and seemed like it has

1205
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:00,030
Speaker 5:  users and also like generate some search and ad revenue

1206
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,430
Speaker 5:  and that sort of stuff. Like I hate they get away from that. Cause I want

1207
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:06,330
Speaker 5:  to type into my start menu and have it search the web on

1208
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:09,510
Speaker 5:  the provider that I wanted to do and to open up the browser that I have set

1209
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:13,050
Speaker 5:  as a default. So I'm hoping that they kind of do that sort of stuff as well.

1210
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:16,550
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's, it's one tap for being two taps for Google. Is

1211
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,920
Speaker 1:  there, if there's going to hide it behind a series of

1212
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,880
Speaker 1:  incomprehensible finger presses,

1213
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,460
Speaker 5:  But th the second fit, like the user interface, things I think is going to

1214
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:28,180
Speaker 5:  be, you know, it's going to be just smashing windows up. And if your windows

1215
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,270
Speaker 5:  is terrible, it's just like, they haven't, whenever they've done stuff like

1216
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,570
Speaker 5:  dark mode, they've not really, they've done it 75% of the

1217
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:37,960
Speaker 5:  way. And it's those little cracks that may let some signs you're rape and

1218
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,360
Speaker 5:  stuff up. And you're like, eh, why does it look like

1219
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:44,230
Speaker 5:  that? And it's like, I think going to a hundred

1220
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:47,620
Speaker 5:  percent on that sort of stuff will make a big difference. It's, it's very

1221
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:50,830
Speaker 5:  minor stuff, but ultimately all the little cuts add up.

1222
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:52,090
Speaker 5:  So

1223
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:55,870
Speaker 6:  That going to go to like the app developers. Cause I know with, with,

1224
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:59,470
Speaker 6:  like when you look at backhoe S it has all these really good and good

1225
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:03,310
Speaker 6:  looking apps that it's because like apple kind of thinks about how

1226
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:06,910
Speaker 6:  things look and windows is just kind of like, it works go

1227
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:10,450
Speaker 6:  like, are they going to be trying to push that more with this new app

1228
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,280
Speaker 6:  store?

1229
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,240
Speaker 5:  Well, yeah, not necessarily the app store, but like, they have been

1230
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:20,230
Speaker 5:  trying to push that with a lot of the API work over the years. And there

1231
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:24,220
Speaker 5:  are some like, better looking windows apps, because, because of it, but I

1232
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:27,730
Speaker 5:  will say like, as a desktop operating system, I can't think

1233
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,660
Speaker 5:  of an app that's launched in the last five years. That's important

1234
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:35,590
Speaker 5:  apart from browser updates, right? Like kids. Yeah. It's at that

1235
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:39,370
Speaker 5:  point where the entry for iterative versions of like Adobe

1236
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:43,210
Speaker 5:  creative suite, but like big news, but like, there's never usually a new

1237
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,350
Speaker 5:  app that comes along,

1238
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:47,710
Speaker 1:  You know, I dunno. They're all electronic apps. That's the

1239
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:48,970
Speaker 1:  province.

1240
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:51,790
Speaker 5:  They're web apps browser, basically. This is I'm telling

1241
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:54,970
Speaker 4:  You WWD, let me WDC three hours of web

1242
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:58,360
Speaker 4:  apps, PWAs. Let's

1243
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,030
Speaker 4:  go, Tom, when is this event?

1244
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:05,260
Speaker 5:  June 24th. But the, the other thing, the other big thing is the store. So

1245
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:08,920
Speaker 5:  they're going to open that up and allow like Chrome and Firefox and stuff.

1246
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,960
Speaker 5:  You know, that, remember when they opened the store and they were like, Chrome,

1247
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,710
Speaker 5:  can't be in there. Everyone was like, my browser that I use, can't be

1248
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,360
Speaker 5:  okay. You can't sit with us. And they're also gonna allow third

1249
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,950
Speaker 5:  third-party payment process processes through

1250
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,470
Speaker 1:  The store. They're just going to come for app. I see what they're doing.

1251
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:23,950
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1252
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:27,850
Speaker 5:  Like, yeah. So that's another big part of this as well. And then it's

1253
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,750
Speaker 5:  just like fixing up stuff like multi Monter Monter Monter to support some,

1254
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,970
Speaker 5:  some Bluetooth stack stuff that they should have fixed years

1255
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:37,960
Speaker 5:  ago. Yeah. It's like the big fix. I think it

1256
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,000
Speaker 5:  justifies a new version. So

1257
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,630
Speaker 1:  The 24th, 11:00 AM wherever you are or wherever Microsoft

1258
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:47,590
Speaker 1:  is in all times zones at 11:00

1259
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,710
Speaker 1:  AM. Yeah. All right. We're going to take a break. We have more operating.

1260
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:54,280
Speaker 1:  So this is talking about this wild adventure on this show we were at

1261
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:58,330

Speaker ?:  offer valid through June 30th terms and conditions

1298
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,810
Speaker ?:  apply.

1299
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,780
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. There's more operating systems to talk about. That's

1300
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,090
Speaker 1:  the real week of operating systems,

1301
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:15,960
Speaker 1:  including from Google, but really the news

1302
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,440
Speaker 1:  here, Dieter, I'm gonna let you walk us through this while a basically got

1303
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,590
Speaker 1:  banned from using Android from, by the Trump administration, basically they

1304
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:26,460
Speaker 1:  were put on the entity list, which was still a great name. And now

1305
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:30,120
Speaker 1:  they've created a new us, which is not Android, but like

1306
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,010
Speaker 1:  it's, it's like three Android and a trench

1307
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:35,900
Speaker 1:  coat. It's

1308
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,270
Speaker 1:  called POS. They should've called it

1309
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:40,370
Speaker 1:  entity.

1310
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,570
Speaker 3:  It's not, it's not

1311
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:45,170
Speaker 4:  Three Androids and a trench coat. It's like three Androids in a very pretty

1312
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:48,890
Speaker 4:  trench coat with like flowers in it. It's

1313
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:52,820
Speaker 4:  like flows in the wind. It looks fine. Yeah.

1314
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:55,940
Speaker 4:  But like ours tactic actually did some really good deep dives on here. When

1315
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:59,500
Speaker 4:  you actually ask Huawei about it. They're like, yeah, it's

1316
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,570
Speaker 4:  different. It's like, no, we, we all know it's based on Android, which is

1317
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:06,560
Speaker 4:  frustrating because they could just admit it, right. Like Android

1318
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,280
Speaker 4:  is open source, Google can't directly offer stuff to Huawei,

1319
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,390
Speaker 4:  but like it's out there, Google can't stop them there. I'm sure there's some

1320
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:17,290
Speaker 4:  way they could get around it. I don't know. And it is also weird cause like

1321
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:21,010
Speaker 4:  how long we just spent talking about needing competition and more app stores

1322
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:24,430
Speaker 4:  and whatever. And we're all just sort of turning our nose up at harmony LS

1323
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:26,490
Speaker 4:  before it's even out. Yeah.

1324
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:30,390
Speaker 1:  I mean, Huawei is the biggest player in phones in China still and thereabouts

1325
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:33,690
Speaker 1:  and standby for two years ago. We actually, I actually have Sam update this

1326
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:37,080
Speaker 1:  piece, but he did a whole piece about how the Chinese smartphone

1327
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:41,040
Speaker 1:  market is ultra competitive. There are lots of different apps for us, lots

1328
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,820
Speaker 1:  of them, forks of Android. They all use complete reps of the iPhone camera

1329
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,020
Speaker 1:  app, which is amazing. How

1330
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,570
Speaker 4:  Many of us actually, if you will actually a better way to describe it as

1331
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:51,150
Speaker 4:  three Androids in a, in a iPhone look and

1332
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,070
Speaker 4:  trench,

1333
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:57,060
Speaker 1:  But so that's like, that is always fascinating to me. Like why does

1334
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,750
Speaker 1:  the camera app get ripped off the most? It's because it's the thing that

1335
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:04,650
Speaker 1:  everybody uses and lowering the switching cost of the camera app is good.

1336
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:08,340
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's, it's just as dead simple as that. Like, it is not worthwhile

1337
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,310
Speaker 1:  to innovate on how the camera app works because you want people to pick up

1338
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:14,430
Speaker 1:  a new phone and be able to do the thing they're going to do the most without

1339
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:18,390
Speaker 1:  any cognitive load whatsoever. Then you can be like, we have

1340
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:21,840
Speaker 1:  ideas about notifications and like, just go down that

1341
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,530
Speaker 1:  road. But it's the market in China is just like booming with Android

1342
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:28,830
Speaker 1:  forks. And so harming us is going to be a big player in that. And it is

1343
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:32,790
Speaker 1:  true because we don't get these phones are like, ha, you're not allowed

1344
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:36,270
Speaker 1:  to use Android. And then while we was like, but we are.

1345
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,050
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1346
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:40,980
Speaker 4:  Well, and it's also like, we, we won't bother we think any, any

1347
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:43,140
Speaker 4:  Android phone that doesn't have the Google play store as a failure, but it's

1348
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:46,680
Speaker 4:  actually like, I wouldn't mind having alternative afterwards. I wish that

1349
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,710
Speaker 4:  don't know Amazon app store was good, but what you need are Google's apps

1350
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:52,950
Speaker 4:  and Google will never put its apps on anything that doesn't have Google's

1351
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:56,760
Speaker 4:  play store and all those exclusivity agreements. Anyway,

1352
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,600
Speaker 4:  harmony was coming. There's also harmony Wes on the hallway watch, but it

1353
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,050
Speaker 4:  seems like that's really just a rebrand of light O S which was the version

1354
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:07,830
Speaker 4:  that they ran their watches on before, because nothing runs on where

1355
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:11,280
Speaker 4:  until the new version of where that's merging with Tyson comes

1356
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,360
Speaker 4:  out. I like

1357
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,600
Speaker 6:  The optimism that something will run on where then

1358
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,680
Speaker 6:  I

1359
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,600
Speaker 3:  Look

1360
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,230
Speaker 4:  And then they teased, but did not really release the

1361
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:26,130
Speaker 4:  Huawei P 50, which looks amazing. There are two

1362
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:29,850
Speaker 4:  giant like owl eye camera rays on the back, just like

1363
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:33,690
Speaker 4:  big, giant circles with cameras in them to go for it. It's just, they

1364
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,750
Speaker 4:  just went for it. It looks great. And then you're like, oh, and you're releasing

1365
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:40,620
Speaker 4:  it. And this is the quote from the company quote, we're

1366
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:44,010
Speaker 4:  trying to figure out how to make this great product available to

1367
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:47,910
Speaker 4:  you. Would you like to,

1368
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:50,520
Speaker 4:  would you like to read the chip shortage to do that? Would you like to read

1369
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,390
Speaker 4:  the entity, listen to that? Which you, any number of things are keeping

1370
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:58,320
Speaker 4:  us from having this great product made available to us.

1371
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,410
Speaker 4:  But yeah. That's I love, I love it's not like coming weeks. It's like, we're

1372
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,690
Speaker 4:  actually, we're trying to figure out how to release this thing. You don't

1373
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:04,770
Speaker 4:  know if we can't or if it's going

1374
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:08,250
Speaker 3:  To happen. That's amazing.

1375
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:12,050
Speaker 1:  Okay. And then there's fuchsia, which we've been

1376
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:15,170
Speaker 1:  diligently tracking the status of Google's fuchsia for

1377
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:18,370
Speaker 1:  years. And they finally did a thing. Yeah.

1378
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:22,330
Speaker 4:  It's arriving on the original nest hub, formerly known

1379
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:25,720
Speaker 4:  as the Google home. Oh my God. It is just going to be the

1380
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,530
Speaker 4:  underlying, nothing's going to change about its functionality or features.

1381
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:31,960
Speaker 4:  It's just, it's going to run on top of fuchsia. Now, if

1382
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,440
Speaker 1:  All they said was it's going to be faster. I would be so happy.

1383
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,100
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1384
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,890
Speaker 4:  Well, I guess we'll see whether or not this is a

1385
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:42,640
Speaker 4:  stepping stone towards fuchsia. Doing more things is

1386
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,390
Speaker 4:  unclear. The thing that amuses me the most, isn't the

1387
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:49,960
Speaker 4:  confusion about whether fuchsia is going to be the future foundation

1388
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,920
Speaker 4:  of phones and tablets and laptops and whatever it isn't.

1389
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,380
Speaker 4:  If it's going to replace Android and chromo S it's

1390
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,950
Speaker 4:  that Google's smart home

1391
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:03,880
Speaker 4:  gadgets now run on

1392
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,750
Speaker 4:  caste fuchsia. And I'm pretty sure there's some like Android

1393
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:11,560
Speaker 4:  home floating around in the world somewhere. So the

1394
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,340
Speaker 4:  Google literally doesn't care what LS runs. Its gadgets. It's basically,

1395
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:18,970
Speaker 4:  they'll just let whatever. Yeah. If you show you, you, you bought ready shirt,

1396
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:19,750
Speaker 4:  they will throw it. Oh

1397
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:22,120
Speaker 3:  Shit. I was just

1398
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,960
Speaker 1:  Deeply confusing. Why they even announced this? Yeah. Because like

1399
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,590
Speaker 1:  it, they could have just done it. And then like the fuchsia team would have

1400
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:33,280
Speaker 1:  been like happy. Yeah. And they would have had a secret and they would have

1401
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:37,060
Speaker 1:  walked the streets of San Francisco, the glimmer in their eyes. They knew

1402
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,830
Speaker 1:  something that you didn't know. No.

1403
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:41,590
Speaker 4:  The way this news broke is like, somebody from the future team was like,

1404
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:44,350
Speaker 4:  it's not every day ship a new OOS. And it was like, wait,

1405
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:48,490
Speaker 4:  what's

1406
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,830
Speaker 5:  A secret. We installed a Linux micro

1407
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:53,020
Speaker 5:  kernel

1408
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,370
Speaker 3:  Got away with it,

1409
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:58,640
Speaker 1:  But you announce it and all this. And then, and they're like, no, it's gonna

1410
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,290
Speaker 1:  be exactly the same. And so we've taken the glimmer in the eye is

1411
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:05,500
Speaker 1:  gone. Now everybody knows the secret. And the secret is nothing has

1412
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,340
Speaker 1:  changed.

1413
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,820
Speaker 6:  It's such a let down to like, like the early

1414
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:13,330
Speaker 6:  hypoperfusion was just going to be, it was going to be totally different

1415
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,930
Speaker 6:  to replace Android. Yeah. It was going to replace Android. It was going to

1416
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:19,630
Speaker 6:  be incredible. It was going to be amazing. And now it's on like a

1417
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,520
Speaker 6:  Google device. Yeah.

1418
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,070
Speaker 1:  That you're really not supposed to interact

1419
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:25,960
Speaker 1:  with.

1420
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:26,410
Speaker 3:  Like

1421
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:29,710
Speaker 1:  They've you are not supposed to touch it so much that the new one

1422
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:33,670
Speaker 1:  encourages you to just wave at it instead of touching. It's

1423
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:37,210
Speaker 1:  pretty good. I will say I've, I've stopped a lot of timers. Like very

1424
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:41,110
Speaker 1:  insistently. It's good. Slap it. I get why they did it. It's

1425
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:45,040
Speaker 1:  just like, stop. I know the rice is done.

1426
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,940
Speaker 1:  You shut up. I think that's it for operating systems, Tom,

1427
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,780
Speaker 1:  before we go, I want to, I want to end with a segment on, on the

1428
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:56,680
Speaker 1:  30 ADTs. Cause you have one a day. You're like one to five people and they're

1429
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,900
Speaker 1:  like, are you afraid for your safety? I also

1430
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:02,860
Speaker 5:  Manage to buy one today. I kind of did it as a half test,

1431
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,310
Speaker 5:  but

1432
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:06,760
Speaker 1:  Now it's now you're showing off

1433
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,670
Speaker 1:  start some Bitcoins.

1434
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,710
Speaker 3:  I don't know. I don't know how any of that works during some

1435
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,960
Speaker 3:  days.

1436
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,490
Speaker 5:  I think that's how it works. Yes. The first year at UCLA.

1437
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:20,060
Speaker 5:  So I reviewed it. It's, you know, better than the 30,

1438
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:23,930
Speaker 5:  80 as you'd expect for 4k in 10, eight, 14,

1439
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:27,650
Speaker 5:  40 P gamey. But I think it's a little bit pricey for Ford. It is,

1440
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:31,550
Speaker 5:  especially in this market, like, and even today we're seeing them, like,

1441
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:34,520
Speaker 5:  I think I looked at some UK parts and it was like supposed to be

1442
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:38,480
Speaker 5:  1,049 pounds. And like people were sending them on eBay for two and a half

1443
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,420
Speaker 5:  thousand pounds right now. So it's like, yeah, but it's,

1444
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:46,310
Speaker 5:  it's a good card. It's pretty much as close as you can get to the 30 19,

1445
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:50,030
Speaker 5:  which is the $1,500 card. But I think if you're spending

1446
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:53,840
Speaker 5:  1200, $1,500 on a, on a, on a card, like it's, it's a

1447
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,530
Speaker 5:  kind of a niche area of, of, of GPS that I

1448
01:20:57,530 --> 01:21:01,070
Speaker 5:  think. And I think the 38 is just like the bargain card

1449
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:05,000
Speaker 5:  really for the six, nine, nine. Like, I don't

1450
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,880
Speaker 5:  know why you'd go for the 38 ETI really, unless you really wanted the extra,

1451
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,830
Speaker 5:  like 10%

1452
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:12,650
Speaker 1:  So. Well you can't, you can't get either. No.

1453
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:16,370
Speaker 6:  How many 4k monitors do you need to justify? The

1454
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:17,660
Speaker 6:  38.

1455
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:21,650
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Yeah. Like you really have to really want to

1456
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:24,860
Speaker 5:  play a little bit extra higher frame rate at

1457
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:28,730
Speaker 5:  4k. And I think for most people they're making the move to, to 40,

1458
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:32,390
Speaker 5:  40 P a lot of the, of the vast majority is still on 10 80 P

1459
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:36,260
Speaker 5:  so yeah, I, I would buy the 30, 80, I think that would be my

1460
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:40,200
Speaker 5:  recommendation over the 30 ATI, but you can't behave with them. So

1461
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,970
Speaker 5:  yeah,

1462
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:46,700
Speaker 1:  It is a very odd, we were looking at pictures. There were lines in front

1463
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,660
Speaker 1:  of best buy here in the states. Like it's a very odd moment

1464
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:54,410
Speaker 1:  for these products. It is. They're just not available.

1465
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:58,100
Speaker 5:  It's unfortunate because they've so good. Like compared to the

1466
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:01,640
Speaker 5:  previous generations, like he's come at like the worst possible time, a global

1467
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,510
Speaker 5:  ship chip shortage in the middle of like, you know, when

1468
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:09,440
Speaker 5:  everyone wants to buy a GPU and if one wants to buy a laptop and yeah,

1469
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:13,430
Speaker 5:  everyone wants to do everything. So it's really unfortunate. And like, you

1470
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:16,820
Speaker 5:  can't really fault in video for like competing with itself and watching another

1471
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:20,240
Speaker 5:  card. And I know a lot of people were like, why are they launching this?

1472
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,950
Speaker 5:  But it's like, you know, this is what these companies do. You didn't want

1473
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:27,710
Speaker 5:  to want them to sort of stand, stand, still do so. But it's

1474
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:31,610
Speaker 5:  unfortunate because no one can really buy them. There is signs though, like

1475
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:34,460
Speaker 5:  the fact that I could buy once a day and also John and our team managed to

1476
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:38,120
Speaker 5:  get 38 today. Like that, that's like a sign

1477
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,810
Speaker 5:  of an, your bony UK. Yeah. So basically moves to the

1478
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:42,590
Speaker 5:  UK.

1479
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:45,740
Speaker 1:  The sound. This sounds like a scam. This sounds like some sort of British

1480
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:48,560
Speaker 1:  Brexit scam. It's a boost to our population.

1481
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,310
Speaker 3:  Now that one's disappeared.

1482
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:55,700
Speaker 1:  C'mon member nations of the EU. We need individual trade agreements. We have

1483
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:59,150
Speaker 1:  GPU's available. Let's get this done. You can mind

1484
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:02,570
Speaker 1:  freely. Yeah. So what's actually really interesting with the chip shortage

1485
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:06,520
Speaker 1:  thing is on several episodes. Dakota. Now people have told

1486
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,360
Speaker 1:  me executives, the CEO flux told me that the CEO Ford told me this, the

1487
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,170
Speaker 1:  shortages at old process nodes, right? It's at like

1488
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,710
Speaker 1:  55 and 98 meters. These ships are Samsung eight

1489
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:21,310
Speaker 1:  nanometers. Like the overall global chip shortage

1490
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:24,670
Speaker 1:  is, is elsewhere. The demand for these

1491
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:28,660
Speaker 1:  GPU's is there's not enough capacity, you know, it's, it is incredible

1492
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,930
Speaker 1:  that there's this much demand for GPU's right now. Yeah.

1493
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:34,890
Speaker 5:  I mean, I think it's because Nvidia did the 20, 80 series and like,

1494
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:38,190
Speaker 5:  they were good cards, but people were like, okay, I'll just hang out, hang

1495
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:40,740
Speaker 5:  on to my 10 80 for a little bit longer. I'm gonna see what they do next.

1496
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:44,040
Speaker 5:  And like, yeah. It took them while to do the next bit. And now people are

1497
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,880
Speaker 5:  like, okay, I really need to upgrade now. So there, you know, people

1498
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,690
Speaker 5:  even buying 28 is like off of eBay for like, you know, whatever the

1499
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,260
Speaker 5:  crazy price is. They're like, well, over a thousand dollars. So which is

1500
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:59,190
Speaker 5:  just nuts, like it's is, is a crazy situation. Really? You

1501
01:23:59,190 --> 01:23:59,490
Speaker 5:  can't

1502
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:03,360
Speaker 1:  Discount the Bitcoin renderers. Yeah. I mean, I refuse to know

1503
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,810
Speaker 1:  how that works. They rendering those coins every

1504
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:10,590
Speaker 1:  day. The, the, it is true that like the Ethereum

1505
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:14,190
Speaker 1:  market is still largely GPU based. I actually do know how this works. I'm

1506
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:18,060
Speaker 1:  sorry, just to be clear. I'm aware that Bitcoin is about

1507
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:21,450
Speaker 1:  saying ASX and Ethereum is also in GPS, but that market is still driving

1508
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:21,990
Speaker 1:  a ton.

1509
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:25,050
Speaker 5:  Oh, it is. Yeah. And that's what, that's why they nerfed the mining. But

1510
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:28,770
Speaker 5:  particularly if you're IM on these cars, because they know that that is

1511
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,950
Speaker 5:  those people still building farms with these GPS. So

1512
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:35,370
Speaker 1:  How is that? Nerfing easy to get around. Well, in video made it

1513
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:39,000
Speaker 5:  Really easy to get around because they released a driver that basically

1514
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:39,930
Speaker 5:  undid the nurse.

1515
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:43,830
Speaker 5:  So, but yeah, like they

1516
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:47,310
Speaker 5:  are bringing out new 30 eighties and new 30 seventies that have the

1517
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,760
Speaker 5:  enough, hopefully they don't bring out a driver that takes enough

1518
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,720
Speaker 5:  away. But like people, I think people have been figuring

1519
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,290
Speaker 5:  out ways of getting around it. Like it's like anything, right.

1520
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,410
Speaker 5:  Nothing's ever fully uncrackable.

1521
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:03,630
Speaker 5:  So we'll see,

1522
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:07,200
Speaker 1:  You got to use the deal. You got to use one GPU to crack the other GPU, which

1523
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,070
Speaker 1:  means you got to get to, and now I know what you did, Tom.

1524
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:15,030
Speaker 1:  Okay. That's ridiculous. Last note, before we go, we

1525
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:18,420
Speaker 1:  didn't talk about this last week. A lot of streaming news last week, in addition

1526
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:22,200
Speaker 1:  to Alex fans, our new managing editor, who's wonderful. We have a new streaming

1527
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,010
Speaker 1:  reporter stepping into the very big shoes of Julia Alexander is Katy

1528
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:29,940
Speaker 1:  Keck, who you need to have on the show. Soon if we'd had a show last week,

1529
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,570
Speaker 1:  I would have demanded Katie, walk us through all the craziness and streaming

1530
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:37,080
Speaker 1:  we'll do that soon, but he

1531
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:40,860
Speaker 1:  anted just decided to walk away from the Warner

1532
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:44,160
Speaker 1:  brothers deal, which is incredible. They're spinning it off and merging it

1533
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:48,060
Speaker 1:  with discovery. There is an excellent New York times piece about how this

1534
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,640
Speaker 1:  deal came together by ed Lee, who used to work at Recode.

1535
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,870
Speaker 1:  We're very friendly with ed, but he was just like, go read it. It's

1536
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:58,470
Speaker 1:  incredible. The CEO of discovery is a very rich man. He has a

1537
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:01,770
Speaker 1:  townhouse in New York, but that the townhouse, the owns, which is a second

1538
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:04,910
Speaker 1:  home in New York was under renovation. So he rented another townhouse for

1539
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:08,540
Speaker 1:  this deal. It's just like a perfect detail for me and

1540
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:12,170
Speaker 1:  decorated with pictures of rockstars. And they all they made, they did the

1541
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:16,130
Speaker 1:  deal under a giant photo of Steve McQueen and all the

1542
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:19,490
Speaker 1:  executives like Steve McQueen is the hero of the deal. And you just read

1543
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:22,850
Speaker 1:  it. And you're like, none of this makes any sense. Like none of this is related

1544
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:26,360
Speaker 1:  to what you are going to do by merging these companies and it's putting them

1545
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,050
Speaker 1:  off at and T but it is happening. They announced a tagline and a

1546
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:34,040
Speaker 1:  logo and a name. It took them one week. It is the

1547
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:37,940
Speaker 1:  worst name, logo and tagline combination I have

1548
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:41,720
Speaker 1:  ever seen from any company ever. It's not that the

1549
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:45,200
Speaker 1:  name is bad. The name is just Warner bros discovery.

1550
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,010
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Which is just the two names together. It makes sense. But the fact

1551
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:52,340
Speaker 1:  that they've gone with Warner bros instead of Warner

1552
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,370
Speaker 1:  brothers is incredible with a period. The

1553
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:59,300
Speaker 1:  logo looks like it was made in 1995 on a Quadro

1554
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,780
Speaker 1:  700. Like it's like extruded gold

1555
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:06,620
Speaker 1:  3d on a sky background. Yeah. And then the

1556
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:10,550
Speaker 1:  tagline, which I am told is from a, like a classic

1557
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:14,240
Speaker 1:  Warner brothers movie is the stuff dreams are made of which is

1558
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,600
Speaker 1:  ungrammatical. And also no one alive today has seen that

1559
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,590
Speaker 1:  movie. Like it's like from like Casablanca or something. Like it's some deeply

1560
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:25,270
Speaker 1:  famous movie that no young streaming customer is.

1561
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:27,580
Speaker 4:  If you know the movie, please tweet at

1562
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:31,450
Speaker 4:  reckless non-stop every day. Remind them what the

1563
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:33,820
Speaker 4:  movie. Well, here's what I,

1564
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:37,210
Speaker 1:  I just Googled it. I just Googled it. It's a song by Carly

1565
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:40,480
Speaker 1:  Simon. It's an episode of law and order organized crime.

1566
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:44,410
Speaker 1:  No, the Maltese Falcon. That's the movie. It's so very,

1567
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:47,560
Speaker 1:  very famous movie, but I assure you, most people have not seen this

1568
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,840
Speaker 1:  movie or get this reference. I feel

1569
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,800
Speaker 6:  Like that's also like a really bad movie to choose a quote from

1570
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,460
Speaker 6:  like, it's a big film nor like, why would you, why would you be like, you

1571
01:27:57,460 --> 01:28:01,240
Speaker 6:  know what? This will inspire people, murder

1572
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:01,750
Speaker 6:  black and

1573
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:05,260
Speaker 6:  white.

1574
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,630
Speaker 5:  It's a mood. It's the stuff that dreams are made of

1575
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:09,580
Speaker 5:  right.

1576
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,540
Speaker 3:  18 T street.

1577
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:15,520
Speaker 1:  Just look at this and just go look at the picture. It is, I tweeted

1578
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,180
Speaker 1:  it. It's on the website. The font that they printed, the stuff dreams are

1579
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:23,170
Speaker 1:  made up is like, I mean, it's a Collibra, it's like a default font.

1580
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,430
Speaker 1:  Like it's so bad. I

1581
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:27,970
Speaker 6:  To find the, the, the designer it's paint shop

1582
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:29,380
Speaker 6:  pro. Yeah.

1583
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,710
Speaker 1:  They got dumped on so hard that they released this statement to

1584
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:35,500
Speaker 1:  variety being like, none of this is no, no, this isn't

1585
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,450
Speaker 1:  final

1586
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:38,380
Speaker 3:  Seven,

1587
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:42,310
Speaker 1:  Walking it back already in an auspicious beginning for complete

1588
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:45,550
Speaker 1:  unwinding of 18. T's massive investment in Warner

1589
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:48,670
Speaker 1:  media. They're just selling it off again. That means 18

1590
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:52,450
Speaker 1:  T they bought direct TV, destroyed its

1591
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:56,350
Speaker 1:  value and spinning it off. They bought Warner media, destroyed its

1592
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:59,500
Speaker 1:  value and are spinning it off in the middle of autism, HBO, max. And nobody

1593
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,910
Speaker 1:  knows what they're gonna do

1594
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:04,010
Speaker 6:  If and T is buying you run. Well, you're

1595
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,840
Speaker 6:  doomed. I knew

1596
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,320
Speaker 1:  Katie was the streaming reporter for us because yesterday in slack is we

1597
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:12,440
Speaker 1:  were talking about all this. She's like, is there anything ATNT can't

1598
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,990
Speaker 3:  Kill? And I was like, oh, like one

1599
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:18,140
Speaker 1:  You're a fresh faced. And you're like, you believe that there's an answer

1600
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:22,120
Speaker 1:  to that question. That isn't and to

1601
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,260
Speaker 1:  you've you've already got it. Like you've already figured it

1602
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:27,740
Speaker 1:  out, but it's like amazing that this

1603
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:31,370
Speaker 1:  deal, I mean, it was a huge deal. The Trump

1604
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:35,270
Speaker 1:  administration sued to block it because Trump was mad at CNN and he just

1605
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:38,870
Speaker 1:  want to revenge on CNN. They failed. The

1606
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:42,740
Speaker 1:  entire impetus of this deal was they were going to bundle HBO max

1607
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:46,610
Speaker 1:  with and T services that made no sense

1608
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:49,730
Speaker 1:  because there was a pandemic and people were not streaming HBO, max on their

1609
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:53,360
Speaker 1:  phones so much on ATCs network. It's

1610
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:57,110
Speaker 1:  still just like, they will throw HBO max at you. If you're an at and T subscriber,

1611
01:29:57,110 --> 01:30:00,950
Speaker 1:  for any reason whatsoever, you like sneeze, the 18 T website, would

1612
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:04,940
Speaker 1:  you like HBO, max? But none of that worked out and now

1613
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:08,420
Speaker 1:  they're spinning off. They filed a document. The sec it's like an FAQ for

1614
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:12,380
Speaker 1:  investors and all the questions, like why, why was

1615
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,510
Speaker 1:  this deal ever a good idea? And they're like, we still think it was a good

1616
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:18,470
Speaker 1:  idea. We just think we have a better idea. Now

1617
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:21,620
Speaker 1:  it's very good. So that's that w we're going to unpack it. It is not

1618
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:24,770
Speaker 1:  closed. As we were talking about earlier in the show, there's a lot of anti-trust

1619
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:28,310
Speaker 1:  action in the world. That's got to get approved. I can't imagine the government

1620
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:32,030
Speaker 1:  being like, we sued to block this deal. And now we're going to

1621
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:36,020
Speaker 1:  PR we're going to Sue you to unwind it, but it does have to

1622
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:37,130
Speaker 1:  pass muster.

1623
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:40,490
Speaker 6:  Merging with discovery though, is going to really suck if you're like a cable

1624
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:43,160
Speaker 6:  provider, because now, like there's just this

1625
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:46,100
Speaker 6:  huge packet of channels that can

1626
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:49,100
Speaker 6:  negotiate big pay, like big rate

1627
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:52,850
Speaker 6:  increases. And that's not going to be great. Like

1628
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:56,690
Speaker 6:  I could, I could definitely see there's still some protest into this

1629
01:30:56,690 --> 01:31:00,590
Speaker 6:  merger, spin off whatever it is. I

1630
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:03,950
Speaker 6:  don't know. How did they create a new entity?

1631
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:05,900
Speaker 3:  Also the revolving

1632
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,620
Speaker 1:  Door of executives is wild. So

1633
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:13,610
Speaker 1:  18 T bought time Warner. They installed a new set of executives,

1634
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:17,600
Speaker 1:  all the old Warner executives, including the head of HBO left tons of

1635
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,440
Speaker 1:  creative, left Warner. Then they installed a new CEO. Jason

1636
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:25,220
Speaker 1:  Kolari, who was the ex CEO of Hulu. KLR said, all my

1637
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:28,310
Speaker 1:  movies are going to streaming day and date with theaters from now on pissed

1638
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:31,580
Speaker 1:  off everyone, including Christopher Nolan, who said, I'm done working with

1639
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:34,820
Speaker 1:  Warner brothers. Then they spun it off. And they were like, <inaudible>,

1640
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:38,450
Speaker 1:  you might be gone. And they've been, I think he's agreed to stay on for one

1641
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:42,410
Speaker 1:  year, but after that he's out. So like just the wreckage

1642
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:42,890
Speaker 1:  in the wake of

1643
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:46,760
Speaker 6:  This story, and they killed two incredible streaming networks

1644
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,360
Speaker 6:  too. Cause they killed FilmStruck with the merger, the original

1645
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,140
Speaker 6:  merger. And it was just like devastating. If you were one of the four people

1646
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:58,040
Speaker 6:  who subscribed it was me, it was just me

1647
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:01,990
Speaker 6:  in a trench coat. And then they killed, they killed the DC universe. That

1648
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:05,530
Speaker 6:  was actually almost good. If you were a giant, giant nerd

1649
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:08,590
Speaker 6:  and enjoyed comic books again, it was just me.

1650
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,450
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Sorry, Alex, have you heard of HBO max? Because we are happy to give

1651
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:14,910
Speaker 1:  you HQ master free. If you're an at and T subscriber

1652
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:18,180
Speaker 6:  Never paid for it. I think I have four subscriptions already. They

1653
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:22,110
Speaker 1:  Did however, launched the HBO max ad tier this week. So

1654
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:25,320
Speaker 1:  they're going to try to grow that market, but just look, I know I have a

1655
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,390
Speaker 1:  lot of thoughts about Anish that's all the time. I would be happy if the

1656
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:31,260
Speaker 1:  only antitrust law in this country was 18 T is not allowed to buy things

1657
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,210
Speaker 1:  just for a bit. I think it would work out. I'm

1658
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:36,090
Speaker 5:  Just glad I live in the UK and things are a little less complicated over

1659
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,740
Speaker 5:  here. We just have to watch government

1660
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:40,710
Speaker 5:  programming.

1661
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:43,980
Speaker 1:  Sure. I don't know. I'm just saying Senator club chart. If you're listening,

1662
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:46,710
Speaker 1:  I'm just assuming that after she was on Decatur, she's a hardcore virtuous

1663
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:50,400
Speaker 1:  Lister. Now that's a fair assumption, right? That's my idea for an

1664
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,150
Speaker 1:  antitrust spill. Just put that out there. And then lastly, speaking of other

1665
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:57,840
Speaker 1:  streaming news, Amazon entered a deal to buy MGM, which is super interesting

1666
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,800
Speaker 1:  because that one attracted way more anti-trust interest, right? You're Josh

1667
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,670
Speaker 1:  Holly's or club like across the spectrum. We're mad at Amazon.

1668
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:09,510
Speaker 1:  We're not going to let them buy this extremely defunct film studio

1669
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:12,840
Speaker 1:  they're going to that's definitely. It's going to be fine. I just can't

1670
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:16,590
Speaker 1:  imagine that they're not going to clean house at MGM. Yeah.

1671
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:20,520
Speaker 1:  Right? Like Amazon is going to Amazon of five, that whole thing.

1672
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,700
Speaker 1:  And then like the, you know, the centerpiece of that studio is James Bond

1673
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:27,960
Speaker 1:  and they don't even know the rights. Tom is a British person. I think you're

1674
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:31,140
Speaker 1:  legally allowed to know the ownership structure of James Bond, right?

1675
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:33,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He owns an Aston Martin.

1676
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,250
Speaker 5:  Right.

1677
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,360
Speaker 1:  It was a BMW for a long time. But yeah, James Bond is creatively controlled

1678
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,230
Speaker 1:  by the broccoli family to this day. And so Amazon can't even like

1679
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:47,190
Speaker 1:  make that into a TV show. Although I'm confident Jeff Bezos is

1680
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:50,070
Speaker 1:  just going to throw money at that Providence hill sells itself. That's how

1681
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:53,010
Speaker 1:  you, that's how you solve that problem. I think, come on, put me in the bond

1682
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:53,880
Speaker 1:  movie.

1683
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,660
Speaker 4:  So clearly the villain though. Well, he doesn't know that

1684
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:01,110
Speaker 1:  Twist. Look, if you, you know, James Bond

1685
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:04,680
Speaker 1:  from, from a different perspective, James Bond is the villain of all those

1686
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:08,220
Speaker 1:  movies. I'm just putting that up there. Oh yeah. For sure. For some people

1687
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:12,030
Speaker 1:  in those movies, James Bond is like very much bad guy. He's just in the way

1688
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:15,720
Speaker 1:  he's blowing stuff up. He's sleeping with your girlfriend. Like teasers shows

1689
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,130
Speaker 1:  up and ruins all your plans.

1690
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:20,340
Speaker 5:  Well, he just sounds like a typical British person, man.

1691
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:23,580
Speaker 6:  Get your giant pit with sharks

1692
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:27,390
Speaker 6:  installed. You're happy, everything looks perfect. And then

1693
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:31,470
Speaker 6:  James Bond, just swans in steals, your girl blows up your sharks

1694
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:34,410
Speaker 6:  and murders. You, it takes your cat

1695
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:37,950
Speaker 1:  Chest. Everybody. We're going to end on that note. It was Alex's for a show.

1696
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:41,730
Speaker 1:  She's just as bad as James on his. I am a lot going on this

1697
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:45,480
Speaker 1:  week. As you can tell a lot going on next week, I want to call out a thing.

1698
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,110
Speaker 1:  We were not able to talk about. There's also a chicken wing shortage in this

1699
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:52,320
Speaker 1:  country. In addition to his sheep, he is shortage. Trust shows. I looked

1700
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:56,310
Speaker 1:  into why it's not an obvious thing for a tech reporter to do it is

1701
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:59,520
Speaker 1:  because of SEO delivery apps. This is a real thing. You just go read the

1702
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,380
Speaker 1:  story. It's very good. It is one of those, oh, computers

1703
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:06,980
Speaker 1:  led to an unexpected result stories. It just in the

1704
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:10,370
Speaker 1:  wildest way. That's it. We, we went long. We actually went long. This

1705
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:13,630
Speaker 1:  time Alex was going to have you here. We're going to have you on again.

1706
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:17,440
Speaker 6:  It was super fun. I loved it, Alex. What's your Twitter. My

1707
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,280
Speaker 6:  Twitter is very simple. It's Alex H Kranz. It's absolutely

1710
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,360

01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:35,090
Speaker 1:  this week. Next week. It's the managing director of Y Combinator, the

1712
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:37,990
Speaker 1:  startup accelerator, a lot of startups, including

1713
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:41,920
Speaker 1:  Coinbase, Coinbase, Dropbox, Airbnb who runs out of

1714
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,830
Speaker 1:  Slayer. Michael Seibel. He's on decoder next week. That's a really good one.

1715
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:48,610
Speaker 1:  I look forward to it and we've got DBC. Okay. That's it. Rock and

1716
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:51,040
Speaker 1:  roll. Snip, snip, bridging the gaps.
