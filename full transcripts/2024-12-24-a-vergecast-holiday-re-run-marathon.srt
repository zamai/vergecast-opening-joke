Description: Happy Holidays! The Vergecast is off this week, but we also know you might be doing a lot of traveling and / or avoiding of your family this time of year, so we figured we'd do something a little different. We compiled a bunch of our favorite Vergecast segments and moments from this year — a full six hours of them! — in case you need something to listen to. You may have heard them all before! They might all be new! Maybe it'll be a mix! This one's an easy skip if you're looking for one, but if you need some Verge in your ears this holiday season, we've got you covered. We'll be back for real in January, starting at CES. If you'll be in Vegas, come see us live on Wednesday, January 8th! https://voxmediaevents.com/vergecast And in the meantime, have a great holiday, and rock and roll.
Here are the segments we picked, in order, with timestamps (because we can't do chapters, we know, we hate it too):

The wild world of undersea cables — 00:04:32

Meet Tony Delivers — 00:42:19

The story of the Delta emulator — 00:56:29

Phones are the ultimate AI gadget — 01:37:12

The history and future of notebooks – 02:04:34

00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:48,655
Speaker 5:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of really, really,

3
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:52,895
Speaker 5:  really long podcasts. I'm your friend David Pierce and

4
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:56,255
Speaker 5:  I am on vacation. We are leasing this episode on Christmas Eve,

5
00:01:56,455 --> 00:02:00,375
Speaker 5:  December 24th, and So I hope you are also on vacation. I hope

6
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,655
Speaker 5:  everybody gets to have a restful, relaxing

7
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:07,935
Speaker 5:  end of the year. It has been a bonkers year in just so, so,

8
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:11,735
Speaker 5:  so many ways and I hope everybody gets a chance to wind down a little

9
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:16,165
Speaker 5:  because 2025 also seems like it's gonna be pretty full curse, but we'll get

10
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:19,805
Speaker 5:  back to that for this episode. We wanna do something we've never done

11
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:23,005
Speaker 5:  before. This might be a horrible idea. Everybody might hate this. We might

12
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:26,405
Speaker 5:  never do it again, but I just wanted to do it just in case. So

13
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:30,525
Speaker 5:  we've published a lot of stuff over the course of this year and we're also

14
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:34,125
Speaker 5:  not publishing anything for the next couple of weeks because we're off. Everybody's

15
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,805
Speaker 5:  off. Things are, you know, pretty slow in the news world anyway, so this

16
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,925
Speaker 5:  is usually a time we just take a couple of weeks off. But we've also heard

17
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:44,885
Speaker 5:  from a lot of folks who travel a lot during this time of year and would

18
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:47,965
Speaker 5:  like to have something on in the background maybe so you don't have to talk

19
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:51,405
Speaker 5:  to your family or an excuse to wear headphones so that you don't have to

20
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:55,245
Speaker 5:  talk to your family. Lots of things going on. So what we did was

21
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:59,085
Speaker 5:  we went back through this whole year of vergecast and we found

22
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:02,725
Speaker 5:  a whole bunch of things that frankly we just really liked. We've published

23
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:06,645
Speaker 5:  a lot of stuff this year. Some of it I think is really good, some of it less

24
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:10,485
Speaker 5:  so, but some of it I think is really good and some of it is

25
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:14,405
Speaker 5:  also pretty timely and newsy and makes less sense now than it did you

26
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:18,045
Speaker 5:  know, three or six or nine months ago. But some of the stuff I think

27
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:21,725
Speaker 5:  we've done kind of holds up and is still interesting and evergreen and and

28
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:25,605
Speaker 5:  worthwhile. So we compiled a lot of it. I think it's like six

29
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,365
Speaker 5:  hours of it into just a bit of a clip

30
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:33,045
Speaker 5:  episode of some of our favorite stuff that we've made this year. To be clear,

31
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:36,765
Speaker 5:  if you've been listening to The Vergecast all year, there is nothing, not

32
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:40,165
Speaker 5:  one second of new stuff in this episode.

33
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:44,145
Speaker 5:  Absolute no hard feelings. If you don't listen, you won't miss anything.

34
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:48,025
Speaker 5:  Totally fine. This is just If you want more vergecast,

35
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:52,185
Speaker 5:  more background noise or just frankly something to listen to. 'cause

36
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:55,945
Speaker 5:  sometimes we all need something to listen to and I guess I think of this

37
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:59,345
Speaker 5:  as like, you know, I've seen every episode of the office 50 times

38
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:03,625
Speaker 5:  and I still like it. So maybe you'll like hearing some cool Vergecast stuff

39
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:07,265
Speaker 5:  again. I don't know. Again, this is just an experiment. I would love to know

40
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:11,025
Speaker 5:  what you think I, I think there's something to this like clip showy thing

41
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:14,625
Speaker 5:  because we make a lot of this stuff. I've seen podcasts do like

42
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:18,105
Speaker 5:  reruns of their best ofs and I've always really enjoyed that. If you have

43
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:21,305
Speaker 5:  ideas on how we can do this better next year, please let me know. Vergecast

44
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:24,825
Speaker 5:  at The Verge dot com. I'm also David at The Verge dot com. Hit me up,

45
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:29,025
Speaker 5:  we'd love to hear from you. But for the next six hours we're

46
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,985
Speaker 5:  just gonna play you some of our favorite Vergecast stuff. Some of this now

47
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,945
Speaker 5:  is going to be wildly out of date. We tried to pick things that are pretty

48
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:38,185
Speaker 5:  evergreen and still pretty interesting and relevant, but you'll hear some

49
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:42,025
Speaker 5:  details, some numbers, some facts and figures. I mean we talk about

50
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:45,745
Speaker 5:  the Vision Pro when we did the review that was 11 months ago. Like

51
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:49,505
Speaker 5:  lots has changed, but it was still a fun conversation and I think a lot of

52
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:52,145
Speaker 5:  it still holds up and is still interesting. So we're gonna play that for

53
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:55,065
Speaker 5:  you at some point here too. Two more notes and then we're gonna get into

54
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:58,955
Speaker 5:  it. One, there are no chapters in this podcast and

55
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:02,795
Speaker 5:  please understand that this is both the perfect, perfect

56
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,795
Speaker 5:  episode to have chapters for. And because our platform does not allow it,

57
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:11,315
Speaker 5:  we don't have it. There are timestamps in the show description. I think a

58
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:14,555
Speaker 5:  lot of platforms will let you click on those timestamps to jump. That's the

59
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:17,795
Speaker 5:  best thing we can do. We'll also put kind of the table of contents of all

60
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:20,515
Speaker 5:  the stuff that's gonna be in here so you can jump around if you'd like to.

61
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:24,715
Speaker 5:  I promise we are working on chapters. It is the thing we want the most. I

62
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:28,235
Speaker 5:  know it's the thing you want the most. We're gonna keep working on it.

63
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:32,275
Speaker 5:  Thing number two, like I said, we are off for the rest of the year

64
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:35,795
Speaker 5:  and we will be back at CES. And If you are going to be at

65
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,595
Speaker 5:  CES in January, you should come see us January 8th, which is

66
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:43,475
Speaker 5:  Wednesday at CES, at the Brooklyn Bowl on the link Promenade.

67
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:46,915
Speaker 5:  It's like right in the middle of the strip. The Vergecast is free. We'll

68
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:50,835
Speaker 5:  put a link in the show notes. You can come hang out, eat, drink, make dumb

69
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:54,675
Speaker 5:  jokes about technology with us. We would absolutely love to see you very

70
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:57,205
Speaker 5:  much looking forward to that and looking forward to seeing all of you. So

71
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,485
Speaker 5:  that's enough preamble. Let's get into it. Here are, I think

72
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:05,325
Speaker 5:  it's 11, 10 or 11, many, many hours of our

73
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,405
Speaker 5:  favorite VERGE cast things that we've done this year. I hope you have a

74
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:13,345
Speaker 5:  wonderful holiday season and we'll see you in a couple of weeks. Here we

75
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:13,465
Speaker 5:  go.

76
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:19,145
Speaker 5:  Welcome back. Over the last few years, one of those ongoing news stories

77
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:22,745
Speaker 5:  that always makes me stop and think is whenever a company

78
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,825
Speaker 5:  usually Google or Meta recently announces that they're starting a

79
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:30,665
Speaker 5:  project to build a cable between countries or continents or across the

80
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:34,265
Speaker 5:  ocean, like in 2022, both those companies announced these

81
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:38,465
Speaker 5:  big plans to build cables pretty much all the way around the African

82
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,665
Speaker 5:  continent. The diagrams of them alone are mind blowing. Just imagine

83
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:46,825
Speaker 5:  you were sort of loosely tracing your way around Africa three or four

84
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:50,465
Speaker 5:  times all the way around. That's what it looks like. Thousands of miles of

85
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:54,305
Speaker 5:  cable underneath the ocean hitting land at these various points all

86
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:58,265
Speaker 5:  around Africa. And increasingly, this is what the whole world looks like.

87
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:02,145
Speaker 5:  The whole internet is just right there underneath the ocean all over the

88
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:05,705
Speaker 5:  world. The VIRs, Josh Za has been reporting on these cables for months

89
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:09,785
Speaker 5:  and he's found himself inside a whole huge industry that really

90
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:13,665
Speaker 5:  nobody ever knows or talks about, which is the folks tasked with

91
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:17,585
Speaker 5:  laying and just as important, maintaining and fixing these undersea

92
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:21,145
Speaker 5:  cables. If you're hearing this on Tuesday as this podcast goes live,

93
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:24,665
Speaker 5:  his story just also went up. We might have actually beaten him by a couple

94
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:27,425
Speaker 5:  of hours, so keep an eye on The Verge dot com. So we figured we'd have him

95
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:31,105
Speaker 5:  on the show to talk about it and explain this whole under the sea

96
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:34,105
Speaker 5:  world to us. Josh Za, welcome back to The Vergecast.

97
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:34,905
Speaker 6:  Thank you.

98
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:38,185
Speaker 5:  You have spent however many months at sea

99
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,665
Speaker 5:  learning about the weird machinations of the internet.

100
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:46,905
Speaker 6:  Yes. Unfortunately in in port, but I guess it's still

101
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:48,225
Speaker 6:  technically the sea. Yeah,

102
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:51,625
Speaker 5:  It's good enough. So I want to like talk through

103
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:54,905
Speaker 5:  this big story that you've been working on and just publish for us. But I

104
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:58,865
Speaker 5:  also want to kind of explain the infrastructure of the internet in

105
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:02,425
Speaker 5:  a way that I think you're now sort of uniquely set up to do. And

106
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,985
Speaker 5:  my sense is what you've discovered, if we're just gonna start from the very

107
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,945
Speaker 5:  beginning, is that like yes, in fact the internet is just a series

108
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:10,505
Speaker 5:  of tubes?

109
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:14,945
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. It is a series of tubes. I was surprised at actually how

110
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,425
Speaker 6:  tube-like they are. Like you imagine, at least I imagine, I

111
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:22,345
Speaker 6:  feel like a lot of people imagine kind of big pipes at the bottom of the

112
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:25,825
Speaker 6:  ocean, but it's actually just little garden hose with

113
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:29,945
Speaker 6:  tubes running between continents. They have some fiber optic cables in the

114
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:32,825
Speaker 6:  middle, basically just strands of glass that

115
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:37,385
Speaker 6:  lasers pulsing through, encode data and that is how data

116
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,185
Speaker 6:  travels around the world.

117
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:41,865
Speaker 5:  So give me kind of the big picture way to think about this

118
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:45,505
Speaker 5:  infrastructure. Like I know it's lots of very long

119
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,385
Speaker 5:  cables, but like how, how sort of big and sprawling is the

120
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:50,825
Speaker 5:  undersea cable universe?

121
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:55,685
Speaker 6:  It's huge. It's, there are 500 or

122
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:59,365
Speaker 6:  so cables around the world, around 800,000 miles of

123
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:03,205
Speaker 6:  cabling. Often going through between sort of big

124
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:07,165
Speaker 6:  population centers. So you have a lot going from uk, Western Europe

125
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:11,445
Speaker 6:  to New York, New Jersey. On the other side you have various parts

126
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:15,365
Speaker 6:  of California going to Japan or other location in

127
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:19,285
Speaker 6:  Asia. And that is how, you know, you think about these

128
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:22,725
Speaker 6:  big global networks. You are, even if you're not

129
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:26,805
Speaker 6:  always, like, if two people in America in the US are emailing,

130
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:30,245
Speaker 6:  they're probably just on terrestrial cables, but the second year

131
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:34,365
Speaker 6:  accessing data that's overseas in some capacity. If you are

132
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:39,085
Speaker 6:  watching YouTube videos that were posted from somewhere overseas, it's

133
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:42,765
Speaker 6:  cached locally at a data center, but it got there using an undersea cable

134
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:46,565
Speaker 6:  from some other data center somewhere. And If you, of course zoom or email

135
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:50,245
Speaker 6:  or whatever with someone overseas, it's going through one of these cables.

136
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:50,805
Speaker 6:  Right.

137
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. How would you think about in the sort of day-to-day life of a normal

138
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:57,525
Speaker 5:  person, how important are these cables, do you think?

139
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:01,405
Speaker 6:  I would say they're very important, but they might not be

140
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:05,765
Speaker 6:  directly accessing them every day. If you're in a big continent like North

141
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:09,645
Speaker 6:  America, you're largely traveling over terrestrial network, but

142
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:13,365
Speaker 6:  services you interact with are dependent on these

143
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:17,405
Speaker 6:  cables. So you have like big global platforms like YouTube and TikTok. That

144
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:20,645
Speaker 6:  content is reaching you. Like the last mile

145
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:25,005
Speaker 6:  is gonna be terrestrial, but it got to North America

146
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:28,605
Speaker 6:  using a subsea cable. A lot of financial data,

147
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:32,925
Speaker 6:  any kind of international transfer is happening on a subsea cable.

148
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,685
Speaker 6:  Anytime you call customer service and you're talking to someone

149
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:41,005
Speaker 6:  overseas that's on a subsea cable and then you have kind of the

150
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:44,405
Speaker 6:  bits of the internet, you have, you might little website,

151
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:48,845
Speaker 6:  it might seem like it's local, but you have, you know,

152
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,925
Speaker 6:  software libraries and various things that could be stored somewhere else

153
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:55,725
Speaker 6:  that it's calling on and you don't necessarily know where

154
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:59,485
Speaker 6:  it's coming from. So I would say every day you're doing

155
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:03,165
Speaker 6:  something that maybe on a secondary tertiary level relies on

156
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:04,085
Speaker 6:  these cables.

157
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:08,525
Speaker 5:  Got it. Okay. And undersea cables, if, if I understand correctly, are

158
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:11,925
Speaker 5:  not like a new internety idea, right? The idea of

159
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:16,045
Speaker 5:  having a cable that connects the United States to Europe and Europe

160
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:20,125
Speaker 5:  to Africa and Africa to Asia or whatever, we know how to do this

161
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,205
Speaker 5:  at this point, right?

162
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:25,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. One of the surprising things to me in doing this story

163
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:29,565
Speaker 6:  is how little this has changed over the years. And I'm not just

164
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,885
Speaker 6:  talking like the decades of the internet, but like a lot of these companies

165
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:36,445
Speaker 6:  trace their lineages back to the telegraph era. And a lot of the practices

166
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,405
Speaker 6:  are, are date from the Telegraph era. Like you lay cables, you repair cables

167
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:43,485
Speaker 6:  pretty much how you did in the 19th century.

168
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:47,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We're talking like mid 18 hundreds, right when the telegraph was starting

169
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,685
Speaker 5:  to kind of move around the world.

170
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:52,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You read these accounts of the early telegraph people and, and it's

171
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:55,845
Speaker 6:  quite a lot of, it's trial by air. It's quite exciting as people, they don't

172
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,165
Speaker 6:  really know how electricity works, they don't really know what the bottom

173
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:01,365
Speaker 6:  of the ocean looks like. And they're just sort of setting out, being like,

174
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:05,125
Speaker 6:  well, we strung a cable over through the English channel, like

175
00:12:05,385 --> 00:12:07,565
Speaker 6:  why not do the ocean? And it's just

176
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:08,085
Speaker 5:  More water.

177
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:11,805
Speaker 6:  It goes terribly for, for several decades before they eventually figure out

178
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:12,485
Speaker 6:  how to do it.

179
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:16,925
Speaker 5:  Okay. So today, what does it take to keep all these important garden

180
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,405
Speaker 5:  hoses safe and working?

181
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:22,685
Speaker 6:  So they're breaking all the time. They break 200 times a year.

182
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:25,205
Speaker 6:  It's like every other day a cable breaks. So

183
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:28,165
Speaker 5:  We have 500 cables and 200 of them break every year. Right?

184
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:31,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Wow. They get 200 breaks. Sometimes they're on the same cable. It's

185
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:35,685
Speaker 6:  complicated. But yeah, basically a good chunk of them are breaking, there's

186
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:39,565
Speaker 6:  enough redundancy in the system that data can be routed around on

187
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:43,525
Speaker 6:  alternate paths. So you don't really notice, but you know, if they,

188
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:47,565
Speaker 6:  if 200 cables were to stay broken, you would notice things very bad things

189
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:51,525
Speaker 6:  would happen happen. So yeah, these brakes happen all the time, 200 times

190
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:55,565
Speaker 6:  a year. And when one breaks traffic is rerouted

191
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:59,245
Speaker 6:  along alternate paths and while that's happening, one of this

192
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:03,085
Speaker 6:  small band of ships will sail out with some spare cable and

193
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:06,765
Speaker 6:  fix the brake. You know, as the internet has become more important there,

194
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:10,685
Speaker 6:  there's a report that was interesting a couple years ago that talks about

195
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:14,365
Speaker 6:  how cables have not become more vulnerable in recent years.

196
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,485
Speaker 6:  It's just that our dependence on them has grown exponentially.

197
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:22,645
Speaker 6:  Hmm. So say in the nineties there's an a massive break. Some things

198
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:26,405
Speaker 6:  break, it's not bad. You might not notice in your day-to-day life. Now

199
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,365
Speaker 6:  everything breaks, you know, banks stop working, companies can't

200
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:34,245
Speaker 6:  function, supply chains, break websites don't load. We rely on it for

201
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,805
Speaker 6:  everything. But the industry that repairs it keeps things running

202
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,565
Speaker 6:  is basically the same. It's just sort of handled by private companies

203
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:45,765
Speaker 6:  that have a bunch of contracts with cable owners

204
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,925
Speaker 6:  and they have this arrangement that is sort of, you know,

205
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:53,965
Speaker 6:  days back half a century maybe, where everyone kind of pays

206
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:57,965
Speaker 6:  into a organizing body that has a couple ships

207
00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:01,925
Speaker 6:  that stand by and repair any cables that break in a big zone.

208
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,285
Speaker 6:  And like the zone is the Atlantic ocean.

209
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:08,845
Speaker 5:  It's a big, big zone. Yeah. So how do these cables break?

210
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:12,925
Speaker 6:  Overwhelmingly, it's people break them, specifically

211
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:16,125
Speaker 6:  fishing vessels break a lot of cables. You have these

212
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:19,725
Speaker 6:  dredging nets, troll fishing, they

213
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,485
Speaker 6:  scrape these big hooks across the bottom of the sea with a

214
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:27,285
Speaker 6:  net and they snap cables all the time.

215
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:31,485
Speaker 5:  So it's not like a targeted attack on the cable, it's just sort of this gets

216
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,445
Speaker 5:  caught up in the phishing net and snaps kind of thing.

217
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:36,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. One of the interest there, there's been hardly any proven

218
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:41,125
Speaker 6:  hostile attacks on a cable. Okay. It's almost all just sort of accidental

219
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,925
Speaker 6:  damage. You have a fishing, fishing vessel, you have like a

220
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:48,765
Speaker 6:  ship drags its anchor in the wrong place, things like that. And then you

221
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:52,605
Speaker 6:  have natural disasters, you have like landslides under the ocean basically

222
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:56,485
Speaker 6:  earthquakes, volcanoes, weird currents, things like that. And then,

223
00:14:56,785 --> 00:15:00,445
Speaker 6:  you know, if there have been cable breaks that people suspect could maybe

224
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:04,445
Speaker 6:  be from a malicious actor, but it's never really been proven. The

225
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,125
Speaker 6:  one case I've seen cited was like during World War I when

226
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:12,005
Speaker 6:  various the UK and and Germany sort of sent people

227
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:16,205
Speaker 6:  Aho to cut telegraph cables with axes. Other than that, there hasn't

228
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:19,365
Speaker 6:  really been any documented cases of a, of attack on a cable

229
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:22,965
Speaker 5:  World war i a lot of fights over TikTok and World War I. Right, right. From,

230
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:26,645
Speaker 5:  from what I remember. So you, you mentioned the, the maintenance industry

231
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:30,085
Speaker 5:  here. What does this industry look like? This feels like

232
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:34,405
Speaker 5:  this incredibly important gigantic job. Like

233
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:38,045
Speaker 5:  is this, is this a huge teaming industry of huge teaming

234
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:40,565
Speaker 5:  multinational corporations fixing the internet?

235
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:44,045
Speaker 6:  It's really not. It's actually quite a small industry like

236
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:48,605
Speaker 6:  ballpark, maybe a thousand or so people in the direct sort of

237
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:51,045
Speaker 6:  maritime side of maintenance. Do you have for

238
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:53,365
Speaker 5:  All 800,000 miles of undersea cables?

239
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:57,405
Speaker 6:  That's right. Wow. So you have, there's about 70 cable ships in the world,

240
00:15:57,785 --> 00:16:01,445
Speaker 6:  but most of them mostly do installations, which pays better. You have like

241
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:05,365
Speaker 6:  22 or so dedicated maintenance

242
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:09,005
Speaker 6:  vessels and they are stationed around the world, you know,

243
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:13,165
Speaker 6:  a handful per ocean basically. And their

244
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:16,765
Speaker 6:  job is to, you know, like firefighters stand ready

245
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:20,685
Speaker 6:  24 hours a day to sail out within 24 hours of being

246
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:24,405
Speaker 6:  notified of a cable fault. So they belong to these consortiums.

247
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:28,565
Speaker 6:  They, you know, maybe a couple different maintenance providers have a ship

248
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:32,845
Speaker 6:  in a given ocean and they cover the whole area. And if you're a cable owner,

249
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:36,245
Speaker 6:  you call the maintenance provider and say, Hey, I have a cable broken. Send

250
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:40,005
Speaker 6:  a ship out. And they send a ship app to fix the cable. It's basically

251
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,045
Speaker 6:  how, how it works.

252
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:44,765
Speaker 5:  Wow. It's like, it's like an adventure story every time they're like, we

253
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:48,525
Speaker 5:  have to, we have to go explore the depths of the ocean to find a

254
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,725
Speaker 5:  broken garden hose and figure out what to do with it.

255
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:54,725
Speaker 6:  It really is like drop everything. We go to a random

256
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,565
Speaker 6:  place in the middle of the ocean often. Wow.

257
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:01,285
Speaker 5:  22 ships strikes me as not a lot of ships

258
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:05,645
Speaker 5:  to cover a all of the problems you've described and b just the

259
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:09,405
Speaker 5:  sheer size and scope of all of this. Can they do it with

260
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:10,005
Speaker 5:  22 ships?

261
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:13,165
Speaker 6:  So they have done it with 22 ships.

262
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:16,205
Speaker 5:  Okay. Fair. I guess. Yeah, the internet still works. We're still here. Okay.

263
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:20,725
Speaker 6:  I think the, the, the concern is that a lot of these ships are getting pretty

264
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:24,125
Speaker 6:  old. They're like several decades old. There's not a lot of money coming

265
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,845
Speaker 6:  into the industry. And if there were to be a big event

266
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:31,845
Speaker 6:  like a big earthquake or a deliberate attack on a cable

267
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:35,245
Speaker 6:  choke point or something like that, then you could have a real disruption.

268
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:39,485
Speaker 6:  So the ships are really this critical component of the

269
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:42,325
Speaker 6:  internet that so far have been able to

270
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,485
Speaker 6:  keep things running, but it's pretty lean. If there were a major event, it

271
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:50,725
Speaker 6:  would be challenging, I think in some cases for them to, to do the job.

272
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:54,365
Speaker 5:  Okay. And who are these people? Is this like a, is this a sort of

273
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:58,485
Speaker 5:  manual labor kind of job on a ship? Is this like a

274
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:02,525
Speaker 5:  incredibly technically complicated job on a ship? Like who,

275
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:04,045
Speaker 5:  who are these folks doing this work on these ships?

276
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:08,245
Speaker 6:  It's both manual labor and very technically complicated.

277
00:18:08,345 --> 00:18:12,085
Speaker 6:  You have a mix of, you have crew who are sort of seafarers and run the ship

278
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:15,805
Speaker 6:  and then you have cable engineers who kind of come from all the

279
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:19,645
Speaker 6:  kinds of different backgrounds. But the job requires,

280
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:23,965
Speaker 6:  you have to be quite good at geometry and, and

281
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:27,685
Speaker 6:  angles and forces and sort of ocean engineering stuff to

282
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:32,565
Speaker 6:  know how to, you know, pull up a cable from several miles to the

283
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:35,765
Speaker 6:  bottom of the ocean without things snapping. You're dealing with these big

284
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:39,605
Speaker 6:  metal hooks that are used to catch the cables, high tensions. It's like quite

285
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:43,565
Speaker 6:  physically demanding work. And then at its heart

286
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:47,285
Speaker 6:  it's these various technical tasks that involved with

287
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:51,645
Speaker 6:  figuring out where the fault is splicing the fibers, which is

288
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:55,405
Speaker 6:  just ultra precise work that's done. You know, you're

289
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:59,525
Speaker 6:  fusing two strands of glass end to end with as perfect as you can get

290
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:02,885
Speaker 6:  a connection. And that stuff is, it's, you know, it's like

291
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:05,605
Speaker 6:  neurosurgery. It's, it's extremely delicate

292
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:08,285
Speaker 5:  And you have to do it on a ship in the middle of the ocean,

293
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:12,285
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. On a, on a rocking ship that is in the middle of the ocean.

294
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:12,805
Speaker 6:  This

295
00:19:12,805 --> 00:19:16,325
Speaker 5:  Is like everything possible on incredibly hard mode at all times.

296
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. It's pretty, as you see the, the workshops zone, it's just like

297
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:24,245
Speaker 6:  in the belly of a ship sort of surrounded by tarps. It's really not,

298
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:27,245
Speaker 6:  you know, it's not this fa precision factory that you would wanna be doing

299
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:27,765
Speaker 6:  this work in.

300
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:31,925
Speaker 5:  So now I can't help imagining the, the like montage

301
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:35,405
Speaker 5:  action scene of everybody snapping into action. One of these things happening.

302
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:38,925
Speaker 5:  So like, walk me through the process a little bit. I'm in port in some

303
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:43,605
Speaker 5:  centrally located city somewhere waiting for a call. I get a

304
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:47,445
Speaker 5:  call from, I'm assuming it's like Google and Meta who seem to be the companies

305
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:50,045
Speaker 5:  that own more and more of these cables over time. They

306
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:53,405
Speaker 6:  Own a lot of the cables. They've, a lot of the newly built cables are coming

307
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:57,325
Speaker 6:  from the big, big tech companies, Google and Meta primarily.

308
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:01,685
Speaker 6:  And then you have cables that are owned by, you know, dozen, sometimes

309
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,885
Speaker 6:  ISPs and telecom companies and things. Got it. Okay. And so

310
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:11,165
Speaker 6:  each cable will have someone who's in charge of maintenance

311
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:15,285
Speaker 6:  and you know, they'll get a message from their network

312
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,765
Speaker 6:  operation center saying, Hey, we've got a cable down, here's what we know

313
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:22,685
Speaker 6:  about it. That person will then call someone at the repair

314
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:26,405
Speaker 6:  organization. They could be public or private, but it's one of these consortiums

315
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:26,805
Speaker 6:  usually.

316
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,805
Speaker 5:  I was really hoping there would be like a big red button on somebody's desk

317
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:32,765
Speaker 5:  that's like cable down and the alarms start going off in the ship somewhere.

318
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:37,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It, there are alarms and big red warnings, but then it's a lot of

319
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:41,045
Speaker 6:  people calling people around the world at weird hours. So they call someone

320
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:45,125
Speaker 6:  at the, on the maintenance side, that person then calls the ship and says,

321
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:49,045
Speaker 6:  you know, get ready, we're gonna need X miles of spare

322
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:52,805
Speaker 6:  cable for this cable system. We think it's here, we think this, cut it,

323
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:55,805
Speaker 6:  whatever information they have. And then they, and then they kind of plan

324
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:57,365
Speaker 6:  out what the repairs gonna look like.

325
00:20:57,635 --> 00:21:00,925
Speaker 5:  Okay. And what, what does a repair normally look like? Like walk me through

326
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,765
Speaker 5:  a little bit of what it would look like actually on the boat trying to do

327
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:04,205
Speaker 5:  the repair.

328
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:08,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so the first thing you do is you need to locate where the fault is

329
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:11,925
Speaker 6:  approximately. And that's done on either end of the cable.

330
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:16,165
Speaker 6:  Basically you have people in the landing station on

331
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:20,085
Speaker 6:  either end of the cable, so you, on opposite sides of the ocean, shoot

332
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:23,885
Speaker 6:  a laser down there, end it hits the brake, reflects

333
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:27,605
Speaker 6:  back, and the time it takes to come back will tell you pretty much where

334
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:29,645
Speaker 6:  along the cable the, the brake is.

335
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:33,165
Speaker 5:  So like wherever the signal dies, that's, that's the point you send them

336
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:33,365
Speaker 5:  to?

337
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:37,685
Speaker 6:  Exactly. Okay. And so you sail out to there with a certain

338
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:41,445
Speaker 6:  amount of spare cable in your ship and a bunch of these big hooks that

339
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:42,805
Speaker 6:  are called grab mills,

340
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:46,245
Speaker 5:  Which I Googled by the way. And they just straight up look like Batman's

341
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:48,525
Speaker 5:  grappling hooks. Like that's just, that's just what they are.

342
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:51,205
Speaker 6:  That's exactly what they are. And there's a bunch of different kinds. You

343
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:54,845
Speaker 6:  have like multi gral things. You have ones with giant

344
00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:58,925
Speaker 6:  arms and blades, depending on what the ocean bottom looks like, whether it's

345
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:02,605
Speaker 6:  muddy or rocky or what cables are laid with such little

346
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,405
Speaker 6:  slack on the seabed that you can't just, you know, hook it and pull it to

347
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:10,285
Speaker 6:  the surface. Ah, it's too hot. So the first thing you need to do is you

348
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:14,245
Speaker 6:  need to cut the cable somewhere near where it's broken using one of

349
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,925
Speaker 6:  these ols, but one with a big blade in the middle. So you drag this blade

350
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:22,045
Speaker 6:  across where you think the cable path is, and then you

351
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:25,965
Speaker 6:  turn around with one of these gr metals and catch one end of the cable,

352
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:30,405
Speaker 6:  pull it to the surface, attach it to a buoy, go back to the other

353
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:34,405
Speaker 6:  side, catch the other side of the cable, bring it to the surface, and then

354
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:37,725
Speaker 6:  you do the slicing. So you splice like a piece of spare cable to that end,

355
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,525
Speaker 6:  go back to the other side that's attached to the buoy, splice it to that

356
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:44,685
Speaker 6:  end, and then test it. And you should have a working cable that then you

357
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:46,525
Speaker 6:  have to lower back down to the ocean floor.

358
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:50,805
Speaker 5:  So it's basically like you're fishing for cables on the ocean

359
00:22:51,055 --> 00:22:53,245
Speaker 5:  floor, right? Like how do they know if they've caught one?

360
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,645
Speaker 6:  That's exactly right. Like fishing based on just the, the

361
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:01,485
Speaker 6:  tug on the line. In this case, you have this enormous

362
00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:05,285
Speaker 6:  metal hook that you're dragging along the ocean floor. And as that's

363
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:08,765
Speaker 6:  happening, someone is in the bridge watching This

364
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:13,165
Speaker 6:  one dial called the tension meter and watching it waver back

365
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:17,005
Speaker 6:  and forth. And one of the interesting things about it is it's an analog dial.

366
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:20,485
Speaker 6:  It's not an ultra precise digital readout because

367
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:25,445
Speaker 6:  you want that kind of fuzziness to, to, to

368
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,165
Speaker 6:  be able to judge intuitively what's happening. Is tension rising or falling?

369
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:32,445
Speaker 6:  Is it rising and falling fast or slow that you can't get from a bunch of

370
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:36,365
Speaker 6:  numbers jumping around? And so you're watching this dial and if it's moving

371
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:40,205
Speaker 6:  up slowly kind of wavering, maybe you're going through some

372
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:44,325
Speaker 6:  mud, if it jerks up quickly, maybe you hit a rock.

373
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:48,525
Speaker 6:  And what you want is this slow increase, slow steady increase in

374
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:52,325
Speaker 6:  intention that shows you've hooked this cable and you're dragging it along

375
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:55,805
Speaker 6:  the ocean floor. And that's when you know it's time to reel it in. Interesting

376
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:59,565
Speaker 5:  Man, that's such a inexact science, but that's like you just

377
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:03,245
Speaker 5:  described, like an art form more than a piece of sort of data analysis.

378
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:06,725
Speaker 6:  It really is one of the, one of the engineers I was talking to in Japan.

379
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:10,085
Speaker 6:  It's, it really is this act of kind of reading what's happening on the ocean

380
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:14,005
Speaker 6:  floor imagining based on this dial, you know, oh, I'm, I'm going,

381
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:16,925
Speaker 6:  I am going over a trench. I'm, I've hit a rock. That's

382
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:19,285
Speaker 5:  Wild. And how long does that process take?

383
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:24,125
Speaker 6:  Like days to weeks to to months, even if it's hard to find the

384
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,645
Speaker 6:  cable? Everything here is at just a massive scale. So like

385
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:31,925
Speaker 6:  if you're in deep water, the garden hose is several miles

386
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:35,885
Speaker 6:  down and just the act of like lowering it down to the ocean floor and hauling

387
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:39,685
Speaker 6:  it up can take, you know, nearly a day because it's so deep. And then

388
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:43,765
Speaker 6:  so each step of this process takes several days. Splicing

389
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:47,645
Speaker 6:  the cable takes about a day. It's just incredibly time consuming. And then

390
00:24:47,645 --> 00:24:51,525
Speaker 6:  so it's like If you don't catch the cable on first try, then, you know, several

391
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:55,365
Speaker 6:  more days to try again and it adds up pretty soon. You're looking, you're

392
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:56,245
Speaker 6:  outta sea for weeks. It

393
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,565
Speaker 5:  Just keeps reminding me of one of those movies where there's like, there's

394
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:02,205
Speaker 5:  the one shark that they're trying to catch and they're like, we think we

395
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:04,485
Speaker 5:  found it, it's over here. And then they go and they don't get it and it's

396
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:07,125
Speaker 5:  like, oh, okay, well we think we know where it'll be next. And it is this

397
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:10,925
Speaker 5:  like sort of perpetual cat and mouse game that you're playing with this thing,

398
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:13,885
Speaker 5:  trying to get it into your arms and then you can do something with it.

399
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:18,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's remarkable how little visibility, you know, they have onto

400
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:20,885
Speaker 6:  the ocean floor and what's happening down there. Yeah. You know, there are

401
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:24,765
Speaker 6:  times when people are doing, you know, a dozen passes back and forth

402
00:25:24,765 --> 00:25:28,245
Speaker 6:  Wow. Being like, well that wasn't there. Maybe it's a mile that way and let's

403
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:29,245
Speaker 6:  try over here. And

404
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:32,845
Speaker 5:  That's, that's nuts. Why don't we know better? This is one of the things

405
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:36,685
Speaker 5:  I, I found myself wondering, reading your story is I feel like I

406
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:40,365
Speaker 5:  could make a solid argument that the location of these

407
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:44,245
Speaker 5:  cables should be like, closely held state secrets that no one

408
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:48,205
Speaker 5:  knows that because they're so important to the way that the world works that

409
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:52,165
Speaker 5:  they should be, you know, it should be like the, the bunkers where the president

410
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:56,125
Speaker 5:  goes. Like you just, it just should be all classified information on the

411
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,645
Speaker 5:  other side. I can imagine a world in which we should do much more work to

412
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,645
Speaker 5:  have much better knowledge of how these things work and where they are and

413
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:06,245
Speaker 5:  what's going on with them because they're so important and because laying

414
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:10,085
Speaker 5:  them and fixing them needs to happen so quickly. But it, it seems like we're

415
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:13,445
Speaker 5:  in sort of a weird middle between those two things. We're like, we kind of

416
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:14,965
Speaker 5:  know, but not really.

417
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:19,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a trade off. So you can go and you can see tele

418
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:22,925
Speaker 6:  geography tracks, cables. You can see kind of broadly where they are in the

419
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:26,685
Speaker 6:  ocean. If you're like a sea captain, you

420
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:30,565
Speaker 6:  get charts that have cable areas marks, you know, with some degree of

421
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:34,405
Speaker 6:  precision. And that makes a lot of sense because the biggest

422
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:37,965
Speaker 6:  actual threat to cables is someone accidentally dropping an anchor on them.

423
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:41,885
Speaker 6:  And so If you are worried about an attack and you make the most secret, you're

424
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:44,965
Speaker 6:  probably gonna increase the number of accidental cable breaks. On the other

425
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:48,325
Speaker 6:  hand, they are vulnerable. It would be fairly,

426
00:26:48,825 --> 00:26:51,525
Speaker 6:  you know, you don't need a low tech attack, you can just drag an anchor across

427
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:55,285
Speaker 6:  the ocean floor. In practice the network is redundant enough, you're still

428
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:58,685
Speaker 6:  talking about like a really small thing in a big ocean. So it's not quite

429
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:02,445
Speaker 6:  that easy to attack. It would take a pretty sophisticated antagonist

430
00:27:02,785 --> 00:27:06,125
Speaker 6:  to actually cause a catastrophic cable outage.

431
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:10,285
Speaker 6:  So, so far it's been fine, but it is a topic of active debate,

432
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:13,805
Speaker 6:  I think in, in, in governments, what should we do? How should we protect

433
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:16,085
Speaker 6:  these cables that are, are so important and

434
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:19,845
Speaker 5:  For the people whose job it is to actually maintain them

435
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:22,885
Speaker 5:  over time, what is life like? You talk to a bunch of people who are sort

436
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:26,085
Speaker 5:  of in this industry and in some cases have been for a very long time. Right.

437
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:29,325
Speaker 5:  What's it like to be a sort of superhero keeping the internet running?

438
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:33,405
Speaker 6:  It's a very strange job. People, you know, when they join they

439
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:37,365
Speaker 6:  tend to kind of stumble into it. It's not a very well known industry.

440
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:41,285
Speaker 6:  And so you have people who are working as cable engineers in some other

441
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:45,125
Speaker 6:  area or you know, in Merchant Marines or, or something like that.

442
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:49,445
Speaker 6:  Geologists in optics. And they sort of stumble into it

443
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:53,125
Speaker 6:  and you know, if they, if they stay for a bit, they tend to stay for a long

444
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,645
Speaker 6:  time, like decades, a lot of the work is earned on, learned on the job.

445
00:27:57,365 --> 00:28:01,205
Speaker 6:  And so people tend to sort of move around between different roles. But it's

446
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:05,245
Speaker 6:  not an easy job. It's a weird lifestyle. You rotate

447
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:09,045
Speaker 6:  in and off ships, you're often far from home out of contact.

448
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:13,365
Speaker 6:  You know, this is changing now a bit with starlink, but like when you're

449
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:17,085
Speaker 6:  on board one of these ships historically you're pretty much cut off. You

450
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:20,805
Speaker 6:  don't have great internet connections. You can't stream things

451
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,045
Speaker 6:  or, or FaceTime or anything like that.

452
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:26,285
Speaker 5:  You have the fast internet literally in your hands. You just can't do anything

453
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:26,485
Speaker 5:  with it.

454
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:30,605
Speaker 6:  Right, exactly. It's a difficult job. Just the lifestyle's hard, but

455
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:34,125
Speaker 6:  people come to love it because it takes you to very

456
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:38,125
Speaker 6:  unusual places. It's exciting and a lot of them have like

457
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:41,925
Speaker 6:  a real sense of purpose. They're maintaining this infrastructure that the

458
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:45,445
Speaker 6:  modern world runs on, even if no one actually knows about it or what they

459
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:46,245
Speaker 6:  do. Knowing

460
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:49,485
Speaker 5:  You as I do, I'm, I'm confident that at some point in reporting this story,

461
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:53,605
Speaker 5:  you tried to live the cable maintenance life yourself

462
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,485
Speaker 5:  and you were like, yes, I will live the ship life. How close did you get?

463
00:28:58,385 --> 00:29:02,125
Speaker 6:  Not that close. I did try, you know, when I first heard about this

464
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:06,085
Speaker 6:  industry, I was like, well, I should go on board for repair and was basically

465
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:09,525
Speaker 6:  laughed out the room several times, you know, for various reasons. The big

466
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:13,245
Speaker 6:  one was security. It's a, it's a secretive industry. They just

467
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:17,005
Speaker 6:  can't have a journalist hanging out on a cable ship in most cases. And then

468
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:20,325
Speaker 6:  the other very compelling reason was that they don't know how long they'll

469
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:24,125
Speaker 6:  be gone. So like, yeah, you can come along, but maybe we'll be gone for a

470
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,845
Speaker 6:  week or two and maybe we'll get called off to another repair and you'll be

471
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:30,685
Speaker 6:  at sea for months. Which is just, you know, hard to really plan around.

472
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,085
Speaker 6:  That's

473
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:34,925
Speaker 5:  Fair. So were you, were you able to get any kind of firsthand glimpse into

474
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:35,445
Speaker 5:  this life?

475
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:39,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah, So I ended up going to Japan to

476
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:43,725
Speaker 6:  talk to people who work at KCS and going aboard the

477
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:47,605
Speaker 6:  ocean link, which was the ship that repaired a lot of the cables

478
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:51,925
Speaker 6:  in Japan after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

479
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:56,165
Speaker 6:  And so it was in port for a period of time and I was able to go there and,

480
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:58,885
Speaker 6:  and visit the crew and, and get a tour of the ship.

481
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,005
Speaker 5:  What was the ship like?

482
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:04,125
Speaker 6:  It was fairly big, like 400 foot long sort of

483
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:08,125
Speaker 6:  tall working ship. It's from the nineties, it's kind of old

484
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:11,005
Speaker 6:  at this point, but well maintained. I'm

485
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:14,405
Speaker 5:  Imagining sort of a big fishing vessel, but instead of

486
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:18,685
Speaker 5:  like nets and containers, it just has a massive spool of cable

487
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:23,005
Speaker 6:  That's basically right. It essentially is a massive spool of cable. Like

488
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:26,965
Speaker 6:  the middle of it are these, I think three big empty

489
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:30,765
Speaker 6:  tanks that are just kind of spindles of wound spare cable. The interior

490
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:34,485
Speaker 6:  is really empty. It's kind of like a, it's built kind of like an aircraft

491
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:38,045
Speaker 6:  carrier or something where there's no sort of beams or, or struts or anything

492
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:42,085
Speaker 6:  because it's all just, you have to string cable outta these tanks to

493
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:45,525
Speaker 6:  the workstation and then out to the front where there's kind of a rolling

494
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,965
Speaker 6:  pulley kind of thing where it goes over and into the ocean.

495
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:53,045
Speaker 5:  Got it. So it pulls it up and then you sort of spool from the middle boy.

496
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:54,485
Speaker 5:  It's what a complicated system.

497
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,965
Speaker 6:  It's counterintuitive how the, how the ship is put together and how it all

498
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:01,045
Speaker 6:  works. But it makes sense when it's you're working with a material that is

499
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:04,845
Speaker 6:  thousands of miles long and it just creates all these weird logistical problems.

500
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:05,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

501
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:09,125
Speaker 5:  So you mentioned the, the Fukushima incident in 2011 in Japan,

502
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:12,765
Speaker 5:  which was a big part of the story that you wrote, kind of how they

503
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:16,165
Speaker 5:  repaired and the reaction to all of this. What was it about those

504
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:19,645
Speaker 5:  repairs that was sort of different? I feel like you, you found one of the

505
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:23,325
Speaker 5:  hardest cases you could have to tell this story about what happened in that

506
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:23,525
Speaker 5:  case.

507
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:27,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so there are a few, there have been a few major, major cable

508
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:31,285
Speaker 6:  events. This was one of them. They tend to be earthquakes that caused the

509
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:34,885
Speaker 6:  most damage. So, so in this case there was this very, very large

510
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:38,445
Speaker 6:  earthquake off the coast of Japan that sent a large tsunami that caused

511
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:42,365
Speaker 6:  immense devastation. And part of that, that tsunami

512
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:45,845
Speaker 6:  knocked out the Fukushima nuclear reactor causing a nuclear meltdown. So

513
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:49,205
Speaker 6:  you have this disaster on top of a disaster and then you have the other disaster,

514
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:53,165
Speaker 6:  which is not really well known but happened at the same time,

515
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:56,805
Speaker 6:  which is that the earthquake caused all of these submarine avalanches

516
00:31:57,275 --> 00:32:01,045
Speaker 6:  that wrecked the majority of the cables Japan uses to

517
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:04,845
Speaker 6:  connect to North America. Oh wow. And the rest of the world. And so while

518
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:08,445
Speaker 6:  the earthquake tsunami recovery was happening, while Fukushima was,

519
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:12,885
Speaker 6:  you know, people were trying to bring Fukushima under control, the ship

520
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:16,325
Speaker 6:  had to set out and try to fix these cables as fast as possible

521
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:19,925
Speaker 6:  while contending with the fact that there may or may not be a cloud of radiation

522
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,365
Speaker 6:  over them. So

523
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:24,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean again, it just feels like so much of this process is just unknowns

524
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:28,085
Speaker 5:  on top of unknowns on top of unknowns. It's just going out and trying to

525
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:31,725
Speaker 5:  figure out, okay, something happened to these cables, we don't know what

526
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:35,205
Speaker 5:  or where or what it's gonna take or how we're gonna fix it.

527
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:38,645
Speaker 5:  And just bit by bit they just solve it.

528
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:42,545
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's really just, it's very methodical. Like you, like you've just

529
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:46,465
Speaker 6:  gotta kind of follow the steps. And so they ki they, they looked at the cable

530
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:50,225
Speaker 6:  map, they figured out, okay, based on the timing of these faults, you know,

531
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:53,585
Speaker 6:  interestingly a lot of them happened hours after the tsunami. Like, like

532
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:57,065
Speaker 6:  that night basically you have these big debris flows that

533
00:32:57,335 --> 00:33:01,105
Speaker 6:  sort of barrel down these canyons and, and end up wrecking the cables. And

534
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:05,025
Speaker 6:  from the timing of the breaks, they figure out that's probably what happens.

535
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:09,265
Speaker 6:  The seabed is probably very transformed. They're gonna need a lot of spare

536
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:12,945
Speaker 6:  cable and typically you figure out, you know, it's not

537
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:15,865
Speaker 6:  usually up to the maintenance provider which cables they fix first. It's

538
00:33:16,145 --> 00:33:19,465
Speaker 6:  usually kind of first come first served from the cable owners, whoever calls

539
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:22,945
Speaker 6:  in their fault first. But in this case the cable owners are like, you guys

540
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:26,505
Speaker 6:  figure it out. Like whatever, whatever cable you can fix,

541
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:30,865
Speaker 6:  fix it. And so they settled on, you know, the one farthest from Fukushima.

542
00:33:31,185 --> 00:33:34,585
Speaker 6:  'cause the other thing is that normally in a big event like this, other ships

543
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:38,825
Speaker 6:  arrived to help, but there was so little known about what was

544
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:41,705
Speaker 6:  happening with Fukushima and no one felt comfortable sending their crews

545
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:44,825
Speaker 6:  into that. And so they were sort of the only ones doing it for the first,

546
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:46,105
Speaker 6:  the first period of time.

547
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:50,505
Speaker 5:  So, and then there was a moment in the Fukushima

548
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:54,705
Speaker 5:  response where they had pulled the cable up and then couldn't figure

549
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:58,145
Speaker 5:  out what to do with it. Right. Am I what, what happens here? You get the

550
00:33:58,145 --> 00:34:01,025
Speaker 5:  cable up above the ocean and then you have to figure out what to do. What

551
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:01,345
Speaker 5:  did they do?

552
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:05,425
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so this was the first repair. They hooked this cable and they

553
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:09,385
Speaker 6:  start reeling it in and it's under an unusual amount of tension. And

554
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:12,545
Speaker 6:  basically what happens, you know, they, they start reeling in very, very

555
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:15,465
Speaker 6:  slowly because every cable has a certain amount of tension. You don't wanna

556
00:34:15,465 --> 00:34:18,585
Speaker 6:  exceed it 'cause the cable could snap. And so they're just moving very, very

557
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:22,385
Speaker 6:  slowly and it takes them nearly a day to get it to the surface. Wow. And

558
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:26,345
Speaker 6:  what they learn when it gets there is that it's in just been

559
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:30,305
Speaker 6:  completely mangled. And, and what they think happened is some

560
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:34,465
Speaker 6:  enormous landslide happened. It dragged the cable, it buried it

561
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:37,945
Speaker 6:  under a bunch of debris. And now they've been slowly pulling it tighter and

562
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:41,825
Speaker 6:  tighter and tighter until it reaches the surface. Now they can see

563
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:45,145
Speaker 6:  it, it's on the front of the ship, it's on the, the four deck and it is

564
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:49,545
Speaker 6:  hooked around one bar with the grapnel and totally stripped and mangled

565
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:52,385
Speaker 6:  and under a huge amount of tension. And so you

566
00:34:52,385 --> 00:34:56,345
Speaker 5:  Basically at this point have like a thousands of miles long bungee cord like

567
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,025
Speaker 5:  sitting on your boat.

568
00:34:57,055 --> 00:35:00,985
Speaker 6:  Exactly, yes. Exactly. Attached to a heavy metal hook that if

569
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:04,945
Speaker 6:  the bungee cord snaps, which it's being strained, it's sort of each wave

570
00:35:05,005 --> 00:35:08,905
Speaker 6:  and, and, and swell, it will fly across the ship, kill anyone, it

571
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:12,705
Speaker 6:  hits smash into the cable control room, just do immense damage.

572
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:16,625
Speaker 6:  And so the priority becomes, you know, you can't repair a cable under this

573
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,865
Speaker 6:  kind of tension that's this damaged. They need to get it off the ship. And

574
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,625
Speaker 6:  so they do this sort of complicated precarious procedure

575
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:27,145
Speaker 6:  where they, they hook chains around each side of the cable,

576
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:31,945
Speaker 6:  swap the grapnel out for a blade of grapnel, lower it back over the

577
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:35,545
Speaker 6:  bow of the ship while they've evacuated the area. And then once it's under

578
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:39,445
Speaker 6:  the water, they release the chains, the cable is cut and goes back to the

579
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:41,285
Speaker 6:  bottom and, and they start over.

580
00:35:41,635 --> 00:35:45,085
Speaker 5:  That feels like a really interesting test case. 'cause you know, like you

581
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:48,965
Speaker 5:  said, these cables go back a century, but 2011 is very much

582
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:52,965
Speaker 5:  like the internet. And as we've learned, you know, catastrophes

583
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:56,805
Speaker 5:  happen, things like this happen all the time in lots of places. That was

584
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:59,885
Speaker 5:  a particularly bad one. But like earthquakes happen, we just had one in New York.

585
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:03,405
Speaker 5:  Like, these are things that happen. Did that, were there any sort of lessons

586
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:06,885
Speaker 5:  learned from that? Like do you, do you feel like whatever, 13 years after

587
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:10,645
Speaker 5:  that we're in a different era of how we think about undersea

588
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:11,045
Speaker 5:  cables?

589
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:15,325
Speaker 6:  Yes and no. I mean, it's interesting to look back on the coverage of 2011.

590
00:36:15,355 --> 00:36:19,125
Speaker 6:  Like a lot of the, when the internet was mentioned, it was usually that,

591
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:22,365
Speaker 6:  you know, this is remarkable. The internet fared remarkably well. It stayed

592
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:22,565
Speaker 6:  up.

593
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:25,925
Speaker 5:  Oh really? So for all the, for all the issues, the internet stayed up in

594
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:26,165
Speaker 5:  Japan.

595
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And, and so you have these reports and, and people were basically

596
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,125
Speaker 6:  just, you could only use the internet to communicate in the immediate aftermath.

597
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:37,565
Speaker 6:  People were sending emails, they were tweeting, people were posting videos,

598
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:41,525
Speaker 6:  other telecommunications were cut out. Like the, the terrestrial cables were

599
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:44,485
Speaker 6:  cut, the cell towers were wrecked. And so they were really reliant on the

600
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:47,965
Speaker 6:  internet. But you talk to the people who were at the operation centers and

601
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:52,085
Speaker 6:  on the ships and it was so much more precarious than

602
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:56,005
Speaker 6:  people knew. Basically they had succeeded in rerouting all

603
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,765
Speaker 6:  the traffic over the remaining cables. But if one of those cables had gone

604
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:03,205
Speaker 6:  down, you would've started to see a real degradation in service. You would've,

605
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:05,765
Speaker 6:  you know, things would've started to drop. It would've been difficult to

606
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:09,805
Speaker 6:  communicate. And so it was sort of right on the cusp of being a

607
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:13,885
Speaker 6:  communications disaster. And the lesson that the industry learned from that

608
00:37:13,905 --> 00:37:17,325
Speaker 6:  is, is largely around redundancy. Hmm. There's not like a real

609
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,325
Speaker 6:  geographic reason unlike the Red Sea or the Luon

610
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:24,765
Speaker 6:  Strait or something. There's not a geographic reason why all the cables

611
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:28,965
Speaker 6:  were in one place there. It was just sort of haven't, like we'd

612
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:31,685
Speaker 6:  always put cables there. Sure. And they always kind of landed at the spot.

613
00:37:31,705 --> 00:37:35,165
Speaker 6:  And so that makes sense. And so you had this, these sort of choke points

614
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:38,725
Speaker 6:  that then when a landslide comes through, it wrecks a bunch of them

615
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:42,725
Speaker 6:  and there's more of an awareness that you need multiple landing points.

616
00:37:42,985 --> 00:37:46,885
Speaker 6:  But in practice that doesn't always happen because it's, you know,

617
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:48,805
Speaker 6:  cheaper to follow known routes or, or whatever.

618
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:52,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So where, where does it feel like this industry is right now? Obviously

619
00:37:52,555 --> 00:37:56,525
Speaker 5:  it's as critical as ever, if not more so. Like the world relies on this

620
00:37:56,525 --> 00:38:00,005
Speaker 5:  stuff more than we ever have. And I feel like it purely anecdotally,

621
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:04,205
Speaker 5:  I've heard more about undersea cable projects just

622
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:07,885
Speaker 5:  in the last couple of years I feel like than I ever have. And

623
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:11,445
Speaker 5:  that might just be because I pay attention to companies like Google and Meta

624
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:15,325
Speaker 5:  and they're doing a lot of this stuff. But is there, is there energy in

625
00:38:15,355 --> 00:38:19,045
Speaker 5:  this space to increase from, you know, 500 cables and

626
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:22,565
Speaker 5:  800,000 miles to, are we gonna have more than that or multiples of that

627
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:23,965
Speaker 5:  over time, do you think?

628
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:27,885
Speaker 6:  There we are in a cable boom right now. There's a lot of new cables going

629
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:31,525
Speaker 6:  in. Whether that means the net number of cables goes up is a

630
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:34,565
Speaker 6:  debate debated topic because the cables are also

631
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:39,005
Speaker 6:  higher and higher capacity. So some think maybe there'll be

632
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:42,045
Speaker 6:  fewer of cables, they'll just be really, really, really high bandwidth. But,

633
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:46,085
Speaker 6:  but there are a lot of new cables going in that's driven by the tech

634
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:50,285
Speaker 6:  companies primi primarily, which starting a couple years ago decided,

635
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:54,325
Speaker 6:  you know, rather than purchase bandwidth on these cables, let's have

636
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:57,565
Speaker 6:  our own cables. And so they started laying their own systems

637
00:38:57,955 --> 00:39:01,285
Speaker 6:  largely between their data centers. And the reason for that is that they

638
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:05,205
Speaker 6:  need a ton of capacity to kind of sync all of their data centers around

639
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:08,285
Speaker 6:  the world to keep these like huge content libraries up to keep their cloud

640
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:11,885
Speaker 6:  services running. And so they wanted to kind of that all under their own

641
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:15,965
Speaker 6:  umbrella. But that hasn't really spilled over into the

642
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:18,685
Speaker 6:  maintenance side yet. It's mostly kind of the installation side.

643
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:21,085
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say, are we still at, we're still at 22 ships.

644
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:25,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Still not a lot of new ships there. And, and you know, while the new

645
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:29,285
Speaker 6:  cables do provide a lot of redundancy, you also don't want, you know,

646
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:33,365
Speaker 6:  your handful of super high capacity cables to go down. 'cause it, it's

647
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:36,845
Speaker 6:  difficult to, to sort of move that track traffic over onto other routes.

648
00:39:37,115 --> 00:39:40,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Did as you were talking to people, did you get a sense that there are

649
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:45,165
Speaker 5:  new kinds of threats to these cables too? Whether it's some of the ones that

650
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,405
Speaker 5:  have been there a long time getting old and not getting replaced quickly

651
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:51,125
Speaker 5:  enough or climate change or like the geopolitics of the

652
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:54,205
Speaker 5:  internet, which are becoming a bigger and bigger deal all the time. I, is

653
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:57,885
Speaker 5:  there a sense that this could get worse rather than better

654
00:39:58,305 --> 00:39:59,885
Speaker 5:  as we fight about undersea cables?

655
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,885
Speaker 6:  Geopolitics are the big thing. Climate change will make certain things harder.

656
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,805
Speaker 6:  All these cables all land on coastline, which is eroding

657
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,205
Speaker 6:  and and sinking and that will be a problem. But part of the reason you're

658
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:14,245
Speaker 6:  also hearing more about cables is the geopolitics around them have become

659
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,845
Speaker 6:  really sensitive. Largely that has been China

660
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:22,485
Speaker 6:  US conflicts. You have the US saying we don't want Chinese

661
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:25,205
Speaker 6:  owned cables landing in the US and

662
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:30,085
Speaker 6:  China also denying repair permits for the South China Sea

663
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:33,125
Speaker 6:  or, or sort of slowing them down and

664
00:40:33,885 --> 00:40:37,845
Speaker 6:  concerns about routing cables through China's waters

665
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:41,605
Speaker 6:  or into Hong Kong has caused this kind of reconfiguration of

666
00:40:42,225 --> 00:40:45,965
Speaker 6:  the, the network. You have alternate routes going through the

667
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:49,485
Speaker 6:  Philippines or a lot of cables landing in Singapore or

668
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:54,005
Speaker 6:  China trying to build up its own cable maritime industry

669
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,765
Speaker 6:  so that it doesn't have to rely on, on, on the west. And these changes

670
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:02,245
Speaker 6:  are making it, it's not necessarily harder but very

671
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:05,485
Speaker 6:  different. It's just a period of change in the industry and, and kind of

672
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:08,845
Speaker 6:  one that is increasing, getting, increasing attention from,

673
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:12,445
Speaker 6:  from various governments that more governments are saying we need to control

674
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:13,725
Speaker 6:  this infrastructure in some way.

675
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:17,645
Speaker 5:  So, and as you talk to people in this small kind of under

676
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:21,925
Speaker 5:  talked about and under-resourced industry, is the sense that given all

677
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:25,645
Speaker 5:  of that it is just change and this is stable and this is how we're gonna

678
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:29,045
Speaker 5:  keep doing things? Or did you, do you run into people who are like, screw

679
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:31,485
Speaker 5:  all of this, the answer is satellites and we have to get there as quickly

680
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:34,405
Speaker 5:  as we possibly can or like, is this just what it is and we have to figure

681
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:35,485
Speaker 5:  out how to do it better?

682
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:40,285
Speaker 6:  There's a fair amount of concern I think about the long-term

683
00:41:40,345 --> 00:41:44,165
Speaker 6:  sustainability of the industry. It can't all be satellites. That was the,

684
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:48,005
Speaker 6:  the other thing that everyone reminded me of. Satellites can

685
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,885
Speaker 6:  carry like half a percent of the global traffic. It's, it's gonna be

686
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:55,005
Speaker 6:  cables. They're, they're just way more efficient and cheaper to

687
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:58,965
Speaker 6:  transmit data. There's a sense that they will have to navigate this. I think

688
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:02,565
Speaker 6:  the industry has been pretty stable for

689
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:06,485
Speaker 6:  decades and there's some anxiety about these changes. The big

690
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:10,005
Speaker 6:  tech companies coming in, governments taking a greater interest.

691
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:14,245
Speaker 6:  The sort of geopolitical jockeying around cable,

692
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:18,525
Speaker 6:  cable routes that are just gonna be tricky. I think

693
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:22,845
Speaker 6:  a lot of the anxiety comes from kind of the market

694
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:26,765
Speaker 6:  forces involved. Like the big tech companies, they have so

695
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:30,725
Speaker 6:  much buying power, they can drive down prices and so they can negotiate lower

696
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:34,685
Speaker 6:  rates. And so while that means maintenance companies can operate

697
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:38,525
Speaker 6:  year to year, it Maybe it means they don't have enough to invest in a new

698
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:42,205
Speaker 6:  vessel. And so you have this kind of slow degradation, which also means that

699
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:45,845
Speaker 6:  they have trouble recruiting 'cause no one wants to join this sort of aging

700
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:46,725
Speaker 6:  fleet. Sure,

701
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:50,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Having done this whole process of, of reporting and

702
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:54,405
Speaker 5:  sort of understanding how this world works, has it changed the way you think

703
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,965
Speaker 5:  about the internet? Like I feel like the more I learn about the actual

704
00:42:57,965 --> 00:43:01,285
Speaker 5:  infrastructure of the internet, the more remarkable it seems that any of

705
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:05,005
Speaker 5:  this ever actually works. And, and I feel like I got some of that

706
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:08,645
Speaker 5:  sense from your story that on the one hand this is this incredibly robust,

707
00:43:08,645 --> 00:43:12,605
Speaker 5:  incredibly impressive group of people working on this thing that we

708
00:43:12,605 --> 00:43:15,965
Speaker 5:  understand and have worked on for a long time. On the other hand, the internet

709
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:19,005
Speaker 5:  is forever like one wayward anchor away from falling apart.

710
00:43:19,395 --> 00:43:22,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's really, it's one of these cases I feel like you hear about everybody

711
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:26,085
Speaker 6:  so often. Like the ways in which the internet is just sort of

712
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:29,405
Speaker 6:  this cobbled together apparatus is way

713
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:33,885
Speaker 6:  less stable than, than it seems. This is just sort of an ordinary user.

714
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:38,165
Speaker 6:  It does depend on, on just sort of these, these random people. Whether

715
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:41,645
Speaker 6:  it's like a software engineer who's keeping things running or

716
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:46,405
Speaker 6:  these people who are really good at, you know, catching internet cables

717
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:50,165
Speaker 6:  with hooks in the ocean that, you know, if it weren't for their

718
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:54,005
Speaker 6:  sort of largely invisible work, the the system would fall apart.

719
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:04,965
Speaker 5:  Welcome back for years now I've been conflicted

720
00:44:04,965 --> 00:44:08,845
Speaker 5:  about these delivery apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats. They are super

721
00:44:08,845 --> 00:44:12,445
Speaker 5:  convenient and they're helpful and sometimes I don't want to cook or go out

722
00:44:12,545 --> 00:44:15,805
Speaker 5:  and most of us don't live within walking distance of a million good restaurants.

723
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:19,405
Speaker 5:  Like, I get it, I get why they're helpful and good, but I also

724
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:23,445
Speaker 5:  can't shake this idea that actually these services are bad and they're

725
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:27,085
Speaker 5:  bad for everyone involved. They make your meals more expensive, often

726
00:44:27,275 --> 00:44:31,045
Speaker 5:  more than you know, through sneaky price increases. Like the

727
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:34,765
Speaker 5:  menu on Uber Eats is sometimes just more expensive than the menu

728
00:44:35,025 --> 00:44:38,805
Speaker 5:  at the restaurant. They also don't pay delivery people enough or

729
00:44:38,895 --> 00:44:42,085
Speaker 5:  offer them the protections or benefits that the people who work there should

730
00:44:42,085 --> 00:44:45,045
Speaker 5:  get. And for the most part, historically speaking, they're not even a very

731
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:48,525
Speaker 5:  good business for the companies running them. It's hard to make money

732
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:52,525
Speaker 5:  for anybody, including the restaurants, the drivers, everybody.

733
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:56,685
Speaker 5:  It just seems bad. So what are we doing here? Anyway, A couple of

734
00:44:56,685 --> 00:45:00,525
Speaker 5:  weeks ago there was this guy who went viral online because of some posters

735
00:45:00,525 --> 00:45:04,165
Speaker 5:  he had put up around Seattle saying basically skip the apps, call me

736
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:08,045
Speaker 5:  instead I'll deliver your food. He became kind of a folk hero

737
00:45:08,385 --> 00:45:12,165
Speaker 5:  online. So we sent our producer will pour to go see what's going on.

738
00:45:13,555 --> 00:45:17,205
Speaker 7:  This is one of those stories that exists because of a perfect storm type

739
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:21,365
Speaker 7:  situation. Here's what happened for years gig workers

740
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:25,365
Speaker 7:  here in Seattle, notably delivery drivers have been pissed at the lousy

741
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:28,965
Speaker 7:  pay they've been earning in this very expensive city. So in

742
00:45:28,965 --> 00:45:32,725
Speaker 7:  2022, the city council stepped in and mandated a higher pay

743
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:34,325
Speaker 7:  rate for app-based delivery workers.

744
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:38,685
Speaker 8:  It's a good day for gig workers. As the city of Seattle's new ordinance takes

745
00:45:38,705 --> 00:45:39,125
Speaker 8:  effect.

746
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:42,885
Speaker 7:  The new pay scale went into effect this past January and the apps

747
00:45:43,265 --> 00:45:45,205
Speaker 7:  didn't take the change graciously

748
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:49,325
Speaker 9:  In reaction apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash began charging

749
00:45:49,645 --> 00:45:52,965
Speaker 9:  customers $5 in what they're calling a local operating fee.

750
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:56,805
Speaker 7:  That's on top of the service fees and delivery fees that apps

751
00:45:56,805 --> 00:46:00,605
Speaker 7:  routinely charged to say nothing of. Tips and customers are

752
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:04,245
Speaker 7:  finding their limits. Fewer people are ordering from the apps, gig

753
00:46:04,365 --> 00:46:08,205
Speaker 7:  workers are feeling even more squeezed and everyone is pointing fingers at

754
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:08,605
Speaker 7:  everyone else.

755
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:13,085
Speaker 10:  Food delivery orders plummeting. Since Seattle implemented new minimum

756
00:46:13,195 --> 00:46:15,925
Speaker 10:  wage requirements for delivery workers a month ago,

757
00:46:16,515 --> 00:46:20,205
Speaker 7:  This kind of battle is playing out in other markets too. New York City enacted

758
00:46:20,205 --> 00:46:24,005
Speaker 7:  similar rules last year, which the apps have also been fighting tooth and

759
00:46:24,005 --> 00:46:27,405
Speaker 7:  nail. But there's one thing Seattle has that no one else does.

760
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:32,325
Speaker 7:  A guy named Tony Isles, who I am trying to literally chase down

761
00:46:32,325 --> 00:46:32,805
Speaker 7:  right now,

762
00:46:33,725 --> 00:46:37,245
Speaker 11:  I always carry like a tennis ball in my pocket for like the round fluidity

763
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:40,765
Speaker 11:  of a ball. I just like the idea of like, when I was in San Francisco, I

764
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:44,085
Speaker 11:  had a conversation with my buddy and I was like, do you think shapes have

765
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:46,805
Speaker 11:  thoughts? And I think I do. I think they do. I think that they influence

766
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,965
Speaker 11:  the way that you think. Yeah. And I, I always carry that tennis ball, So

767
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:51,725
Speaker 11:  I always feel like I have like a fluid mind.

768
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:56,525
Speaker 7:  Tony is telling me this while flying across downtown Seattle on a rented

769
00:46:56,525 --> 00:47:00,445
Speaker 7:  e-bike in the pouring rain, I'm on my own rental trying to

770
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:04,045
Speaker 7:  listen and keep up at the same time. We're weaving in and out of bike

771
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:08,045
Speaker 7:  lanes, dodging construction and crashing through puddles that could be

772
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:08,645
Speaker 7:  potholes.

773
00:47:10,315 --> 00:47:13,965
Speaker 7:  It's chaos, which is partly the setting and partly

774
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:18,045
Speaker 7:  Tony's fluid mind. In the first 30 minutes or so of pedaling we have

775
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:21,765
Speaker 7:  talked about Maslow's hierarchy of needs, China's social credit

776
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:25,725
Speaker 7:  score and the Stanford Prison experiment. And I haven't asked any of the

777
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:26,725
Speaker 7:  questions I came to ask.

778
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,310
Speaker 11:  There's this idea called the method of Lokey. I don't don't know If you

779
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:29,925
Speaker 11:  know what that is. I

780
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:30,765
Speaker 7:  Don't. It's

781
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:34,605
Speaker 11:  Like this way of remembering things verbatim historically

782
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:38,045
Speaker 11:  in like these ancient societies. It was asked this, this book that I read,

783
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:40,805
Speaker 11:  it was called Moonwalking with Einstein, take a left.

784
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:45,605
Speaker 7:  Hey, if we get separated for any reason, just go finish your delivery

785
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:48,285
Speaker 7:  and text me when you're done. I'll, I'll find you again. All right.

786
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,085
Speaker 11:  Okay. Oh, 'cause I'm hustling.

787
00:47:50,795 --> 00:47:54,685
Speaker 7:  Well, I just realized that I signed up to do a story about a delivery guy.

788
00:47:55,145 --> 00:47:55,805
Speaker 11:  You're all right

789
00:47:55,805 --> 00:47:58,085
Speaker 7:  Man. And I don't know how I expected this to go, but it's

790
00:47:58,085 --> 00:47:59,245
Speaker 11:  A pleasure meeting you. I

791
00:47:59,245 --> 00:48:01,005
Speaker 7:  Got, I gotta up my game here.

792
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:06,285
Speaker 7:  Tony's backstory is pretty simple. He was driving for Uber

793
00:48:06,395 --> 00:48:10,245
Speaker 7:  Eats when those new fees suddenly killed demand. So at the beginning

794
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:13,885
Speaker 7:  of February, he decided to go it alone. He put up some very

795
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:17,965
Speaker 7:  DIY flyers downtown with an offer, text him a food order

796
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:21,525
Speaker 7:  from any restaurant within a couple square miles and he'll get it to you

797
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:25,485
Speaker 7:  for five bucks. No taking a cut from restaurants, no service

798
00:48:25,665 --> 00:48:28,965
Speaker 7:  fee, no delivery fee, no local operating fee.

799
00:48:29,435 --> 00:48:33,245
Speaker 7:  Just a tip if you're feeling generous. He went viral pretty much instantly.

800
00:48:33,735 --> 00:48:37,445
Speaker 12:  Right now on Kro seven tonight, growing frustrations for Seattle's new food

801
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:38,165
Speaker 12:  delivery rules.

802
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:38,685
Speaker 11:  One

803
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:40,525
Speaker 10:  Driver, it becomes his boss's competitor.

804
00:48:40,925 --> 00:48:41,045
Speaker 11:  I

805
00:48:41,045 --> 00:48:44,685
Speaker 7:  Think I now, just a few weeks later, Tony is a full on local

806
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:48,325
Speaker 7:  celebrity. He's all over the news, Reddit, Twitter slash

807
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:52,405
Speaker 7:  x, and he says the orders have followed. The biggest challenge is cadence.

808
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:56,805
Speaker 7:  He might get five texts all at once and then nothing for a while. So he's

809
00:48:56,805 --> 00:49:00,525
Speaker 7:  trying to figure that out along with the fame. Has this amount of attention

810
00:49:00,915 --> 00:49:02,085
Speaker 7:  been weird? Oh,

811
00:49:02,715 --> 00:49:06,205
Speaker 11:  It's crazy. I mean, it's just like all of a sudden my opinion matters.

812
00:49:06,865 --> 00:49:10,125
Speaker 11:  And a lot of people are asking me, they're just like, how much money are

813
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:10,845
Speaker 11:  you making? And I'm like,

814
00:49:10,845 --> 00:49:11,085
Speaker 7:  Right,

815
00:49:11,085 --> 00:49:14,965
Speaker 11:  Right. I'm like, well, I'm not a monetary guy, I'm not a business

816
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:19,045
Speaker 11:  oriented person. But what's interesting is, is like I feel like I've

817
00:49:19,045 --> 00:49:21,485
Speaker 11:  introduced a solution for like a social thing.

818
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:27,045
Speaker 7:  Tony's social solution goes something like this because of apps

819
00:49:27,045 --> 00:49:30,805
Speaker 7:  like Uber Eats and DoorDash. Yes, delivery has gotten expensive,

820
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:35,005
Speaker 7:  but more than that it's gotten rushed and sloppy and impersonal.

821
00:49:35,395 --> 00:49:39,165
Speaker 7:  It's just bad vibes all the way down. And it's ruining takeout for

822
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:39,525
Speaker 7:  everyone.

823
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:42,125
Speaker 11:  It's such a hard position to be in.

824
00:49:42,465 --> 00:49:42,925
Speaker 7:  For who?

825
00:49:43,185 --> 00:49:46,485
Speaker 11:  For, for everybody. Every party that's involved, the restaurants, the city,

826
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:50,845
Speaker 11:  the people that are working as a deliverer, they're in this terrible

827
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:53,045
Speaker 11:  toxic relationship with somebody.

828
00:49:53,315 --> 00:49:57,165
Speaker 7:  Like the restaurant owners and the apps and the apps and the drivers and

829
00:49:57,355 --> 00:49:59,165
Speaker 7:  just like that whole, that whole thing.

830
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:01,405
Speaker 11:  Well just like think about it, last time you went into a restaurant and

831
00:50:01,405 --> 00:50:04,405
Speaker 11:  some driver goes in and is like cuts in front of you and you're just like,

832
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:07,365
Speaker 11:  what in the world? Like, hey man, I've been standing here for five minutes.

833
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:09,925
Speaker 11:  What do you, what do you, what's your problem? You know that that person

834
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:13,485
Speaker 11:  is, they're like, they're hustling, right? So they're going in and they're

835
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:15,685
Speaker 11:  not thinking about that at all because that's not their psychology.

836
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:17,165
Speaker 7:  No. They gotta keep moving.

837
00:50:17,295 --> 00:50:17,645
Speaker 11:  Right?

838
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:22,205
Speaker 7:  And from where Tony's standing, the apps are moving in precisely the wrong

839
00:50:22,205 --> 00:50:22,765
Speaker 7:  direction.

840
00:50:23,525 --> 00:50:27,285
Speaker 11:  I think that they, the apps have this kind of misaligned misdirection

841
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,605
Speaker 11:  of where they think the market is and what, what they're planning for. I

842
00:50:30,605 --> 00:50:34,325
Speaker 11:  think that their whole goal is to like send robots to the buildings and

843
00:50:34,905 --> 00:50:38,725
Speaker 11:  you know, send automated cars. And it's like, okay, well if

844
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:41,405
Speaker 11:  that's your solution then you might bleed for a while, right? Like, and

845
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,885
Speaker 11:  so it's like, yeah, I'm not a monetary guy, but I, I could tell you how

846
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:46,085
Speaker 11:  to make it work a little bit better.

847
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:50,645
Speaker 7:  Tony's whole thing is to strip all the tech and anonymity outta the process

848
00:50:51,185 --> 00:50:55,045
Speaker 7:  and be your friendly neighborhood delivery guy. And he thinks people will

849
00:50:55,405 --> 00:50:59,325
Speaker 7:  actively prefer a more social alternative even if that care and attention

850
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:00,765
Speaker 7:  limits him. I'm

851
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:03,805
Speaker 11:  Almost like kind of certain, once I get to a certain number of people that

852
00:51:03,925 --> 00:51:07,645
Speaker 11:  order from me, I almost kind of want to cap it to kind of ensure

853
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:09,405
Speaker 11:  the law of of Dunbar

854
00:51:10,005 --> 00:51:13,765
Speaker 7:  Dunbar's number is another favorite Tony topic. It's a theoretical limit

855
00:51:13,825 --> 00:51:17,405
Speaker 7:  to the number of social relationships any one person can maintain.

856
00:51:17,905 --> 00:51:21,125
Speaker 7:  You wanna cap the number of people that order from you so that you can

857
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:25,365
Speaker 7:  stop and chat for a couple of minutes so you can get to know repeat

858
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:26,005
Speaker 7:  customers

859
00:51:26,005 --> 00:51:29,005
Speaker 11:  Wouldn't even call 'em customers. I would just, I would just call them my

860
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:31,845
Speaker 11:  friends, the homies, you know? There you go. Yeah, they're, they're literally

861
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:35,285
Speaker 11:  like, yo, Tony, can you get this for me? And I think that's kind of the

862
00:51:35,285 --> 00:51:38,405
Speaker 11:  thing is, is like when you try to turn it into a business to customer relationship

863
00:51:38,405 --> 00:51:41,765
Speaker 11:  versus a person to person relationship, they're not gonna be as understanding.

864
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:45,005
Speaker 11:  Yeah. If I, if I forget your drink right now, someone will be like, Tony,

865
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:48,365
Speaker 11:  it's fine. Yeah. You don't have to go back to Chipotle. Totally. But if

866
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:52,005
Speaker 11:  I forget on Uber Eats, they're gonna be like, yo man, what's going on here?

867
00:51:52,745 --> 00:51:56,645
Speaker 7:  In short, Tony thinks that there is a whole lot more to delivery than speed

868
00:51:56,665 --> 00:52:00,605
Speaker 7:  and cost. But yes, he is cheaper than the competition

869
00:52:01,305 --> 00:52:02,525
Speaker 7:  and often faster too.

870
00:52:02,955 --> 00:52:06,405
Speaker 11:  I've never seen anybody run through a target. I picked up somebody's target

871
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:07,805
Speaker 11:  stuff and I was running through the target.

872
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:11,845
Speaker 11:  I'm gonna run here real quick. Yeah.

873
00:52:13,845 --> 00:52:17,285
Speaker 7:  I follow Tony as he makes two, maybe three deliveries back to back

874
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,965
Speaker 7:  some chicken and a shake from Dave's hot chicken. Hey, is

875
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:22,885
Speaker 11:  It, does it come with a drink or anything? Yeah,

876
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:26,405
Speaker 7:  Lemme get a salad from a Healthy Bowl place called Evergreens.

877
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:30,885
Speaker 7:  I'm honestly not a hundred percent sure it was such a blur, but at each

878
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:34,445
Speaker 7:  pickup and drop off, Tony lives up to his own pitch. He's

879
00:52:34,445 --> 00:52:37,765
Speaker 7:  courteous, warm, casual and chatty.

880
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:38,845
Speaker 11:  So man, how you doing? Today

881
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:43,045
Speaker 7:  We pull up to our next destination, a big apartment building and while we

882
00:52:43,045 --> 00:52:46,565
Speaker 7:  wait in the lobby for Tony's customer, sorry, his homie to come down,

883
00:52:47,115 --> 00:52:48,605
Speaker 7:  he's recognized by a stranger.

884
00:52:49,305 --> 00:52:52,365
Speaker 11:  You're the guy. Thank. Yeah, I am. Nice. Nice to meet you. Sweet.

885
00:52:53,165 --> 00:52:56,445
Speaker 7:  I stop and chat with Tony's homie for a few minutes. How far away? He says

886
00:52:56,445 --> 00:52:59,885
Speaker 7:  that he and his roommates have ordered from Tony maybe 10 times in the past

887
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:00,165
Speaker 7:  month.

888
00:53:00,765 --> 00:53:04,165
Speaker 13:  I was just scrolling through Reddit one day and then I saw someone posting

889
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:08,645
Speaker 13:  a, they posted a picture of one of his flyers that were posted like in

890
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:10,725
Speaker 13:  the city and I was like, oh that's pretty interesting. It's cheaper than

891
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:13,485
Speaker 13:  DoorDash. So I was like, let me give it a try. And then ever since it's

892
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:15,885
Speaker 13:  like been me and my roommates I go to.

893
00:53:16,185 --> 00:53:18,765
Speaker 7:  Oh nice. So you guys are like serious regulars at this point.

894
00:53:18,765 --> 00:53:20,525
Speaker 13:  Like I'm saying like between the three of us type thing.

895
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:23,925
Speaker 7:  And were you Uber eats DoorDash people before that?

896
00:53:24,155 --> 00:53:27,525
Speaker 13:  Yeah, exactly. DoorDash mainly. And then it was just like got expensive

897
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:28,765
Speaker 13:  so we're like, let's see what else? There's,

898
00:53:28,945 --> 00:53:32,765
Speaker 7:  What's the like the Tony experience like and how is it different from

899
00:53:33,065 --> 00:53:33,725
Speaker 7:  the, the apps?

900
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:36,165
Speaker 13:  I think it's a lot nicer because first of all, all you have to do is just

901
00:53:36,165 --> 00:53:39,645
Speaker 13:  like text him. So that's already a lot easier. He's much faster.

902
00:53:39,945 --> 00:53:42,565
Speaker 13:  And then it's always nice like having like a quick conversation with him

903
00:53:42,565 --> 00:53:45,925
Speaker 13:  and like the lobby, he always waits. He's fun to talk to. He is a, he's

904
00:53:45,925 --> 00:53:48,525
Speaker 13:  a very chill guy. Like we've had some nice conversations. It's cool.

905
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:55,065
Speaker 7:  At the end of the lunch rush, Tony and I sat down at a cafe to talk some

906
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,705
Speaker 7:  more. I went into the story wanting to know whether a guy like Tony

907
00:53:59,005 --> 00:54:02,825
Speaker 7:  can make it, Seattle's minimum wage is almost $20 an hour.

908
00:54:03,245 --> 00:54:07,105
Speaker 7:  So to match that he'd need four deliveries an hour, not accounting for tips,

909
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:11,425
Speaker 7:  which after seeing him in action definitely feels doable. But it

910
00:54:11,425 --> 00:54:15,145
Speaker 7:  is a hustle. In other words, it's still gig work and

911
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:19,145
Speaker 7:  Tony's only working the lunch and dinner rushes right now. So after this

912
00:54:19,145 --> 00:54:22,585
Speaker 7:  whole adventure, my question remains can he make it?

913
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:25,545
Speaker 7:  It turns out that is Tony's least favorite question.

914
00:54:26,245 --> 00:54:29,785
Speaker 11:  I'm looking at it as like I just understand people, you know people, they

915
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:33,745
Speaker 11:  all have their perspectives and all I'm trying to be is the glue that glues

916
00:54:33,745 --> 00:54:36,865
Speaker 11:  you in that connective tissue so that that way you can get off Reddit and

917
00:54:36,865 --> 00:54:40,745
Speaker 11:  stop arguing about how much money I'm making, get off Reddit

918
00:54:40,765 --> 00:54:43,745
Speaker 11:  and stop arguing whether it's gonna be financially responsible. I can figure

919
00:54:43,745 --> 00:54:44,585
Speaker 11:  that out on my own.

920
00:54:45,585 --> 00:54:48,705
Speaker 7:  I get the sense that Tony has become a kind of avatar.

921
00:54:49,425 --> 00:54:52,625
Speaker 7:  Everyone's putting all their thoughts and feelings about the gig economy

922
00:54:52,815 --> 00:54:56,585
Speaker 7:  onto him. I think that's why his story blew up online. If

923
00:54:56,585 --> 00:55:00,385
Speaker 7:  you're frustrated by big powerful companies making life more annoying,

924
00:55:01,085 --> 00:55:04,745
Speaker 7:  he is the folk hero to root for, which is just way too

925
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:06,305
Speaker 7:  much for Tony to take on.

926
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,905
Speaker 11:  All of a sudden, like people are texting me and they're like, you got a

927
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:13,585
Speaker 11:  great business mind. And I'm like, what are you talking about? And I think

928
00:55:13,585 --> 00:55:17,345
Speaker 11:  that what people are trying to do, they're trying to box me. They're trying

929
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:21,065
Speaker 11:  to say Tony fits here. And I think what they're, they're lacking of

930
00:55:21,065 --> 00:55:24,225
Speaker 11:  understanding is, is like, I actually don't fit anywhere.

931
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:28,705
Speaker 11:  I'm this like round ball that's just rolling down the street. Like

932
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:29,305
Speaker 7:  The one in your pocket.

933
00:55:29,365 --> 00:55:30,345
Speaker 11:  That's exactly, exactly.

934
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:36,665
Speaker 7:  Tony has no idea whether Tony delivers will make it or

935
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:40,385
Speaker 7:  what will happen to food delivery more broadly. He just knows that something

936
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:41,105
Speaker 7:  needs to change.

937
00:55:41,735 --> 00:55:45,025
Speaker 11:  Like what they tried to do is they tried to put food on a conveyor belt

938
00:55:45,565 --> 00:55:49,225
Speaker 11:  and deliver it like an Amazon package and it's not gonna work. They're winning

939
00:55:49,225 --> 00:55:52,625
Speaker 11:  right now, but at the end of the day it's not gonna work. It's too

940
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:56,345
Speaker 11:  expensive. They're like waiting for things to be solved and

941
00:55:56,345 --> 00:56:00,025
Speaker 11:  they're hoping, they're hoping that somebody down the line is like

942
00:56:00,185 --> 00:56:02,825
Speaker 11:  intelligence is gonna hit that S-curve. They're gonna be able to plug in

943
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:05,385
Speaker 11:  the robots and they're going to, they're gonna be able to do it. And I'm

944
00:56:05,385 --> 00:56:06,825
Speaker 11:  here to tell you it's not gonna work.

945
00:56:08,085 --> 00:56:11,745
Speaker 7:  As kg as Tony is about his own future, he will say that he's

946
00:56:12,025 --> 00:56:15,465
Speaker 7:  been fielding calls from all over the country, people who have heard his

947
00:56:15,465 --> 00:56:17,105
Speaker 7:  story and wanna do what he does.

948
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:20,985
Speaker 11:  So it's like, all right, well how can I then be the energizer bunny

949
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:24,885
Speaker 11:  for some things that we do like and that we do think about and maybe that

950
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:28,845
Speaker 11:  I can kind of more positively impact in a different sense.

951
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:32,965
Speaker 11:  Just giving people the right direction, energizing their buddy,

952
00:56:33,065 --> 00:56:36,685
Speaker 11:  you know, so to speak. Giving them the battery to to to kind of the right

953
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:36,965
Speaker 11:  mindset.

954
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:42,105
Speaker 7:  So what does this all reveal about the gig economy? Well, Tony

955
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:46,025
Speaker 7:  has clearly tapped into something and in spite of his grander

956
00:56:46,025 --> 00:56:49,545
Speaker 7:  pronouncements, what he's saying is pretty straightforward.

957
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:53,745
Speaker 11:  I think that what it represents I think personally is like

958
00:56:54,135 --> 00:56:57,825
Speaker 11:  this idea that we don't need the apps.

959
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:02,985
Speaker 7:  We're so used to apps mediating all of our activities that

960
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:06,465
Speaker 7:  at this point, what if not apps actually feels

961
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:10,305
Speaker 7:  revelatory, but it's telling that Tony's customers are

962
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:13,945
Speaker 7:  more than happy to ditch Uber Eats and DoorDash at the drop of a hat

963
00:57:14,525 --> 00:57:18,505
Speaker 7:  or the drop of a new fee. And if big tech companies really do

964
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:22,505
Speaker 7:  double down on automation and robots, more people might

965
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:26,345
Speaker 7:  actively seek out more humanity, more idiosyncrasy,

966
00:57:26,895 --> 00:57:30,585
Speaker 7:  more Tony. Tony himself wants to

967
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:33,705
Speaker 7:  experiment and meet people and hopefully pay the bills.

968
00:57:34,365 --> 00:57:38,305
Speaker 7:  And if he accidentally starts a revolution along the way, all the better.

969
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:42,865
Speaker 11:  It would be nice to be known as the guy that was trying to connect us back

970
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:46,105
Speaker 11:  together. That'd be kind of cool. But not in like the sense of like this

971
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:49,585
Speaker 11:  was the guy, it was just more like, oh, like this. Tony Isles mentioned

972
00:57:49,585 --> 00:57:52,585
Speaker 11:  this and we thought it was like a good idea and it worked. And then like

973
00:57:52,585 --> 00:57:54,425
Speaker 11:  eventually, like we reconnected.

974
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:14,865
Speaker 5:  Welcome back. For all of the last two weeks, the most

975
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:18,465
Speaker 5:  popular app in the Apple app store has been a game emulator called Delta.

976
00:58:19,035 --> 00:58:22,105
Speaker 5:  We've been talking a lot about Delta on this show over the last few weeks,

977
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:26,265
Speaker 5:  both because it's a huge hit and because it seems like

978
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:29,945
Speaker 5:  maybe the start of a new era for the app store, like in the

979
00:58:29,945 --> 00:58:33,905
Speaker 5:  history books of smartphone apps, there might be a

980
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:37,865
Speaker 5:  before Delta and an after Delta for lots of reasons. But there's

981
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:41,945
Speaker 5:  actually nothing even remotely new about Delta. The story of

982
00:58:41,945 --> 00:58:45,785
Speaker 5:  this app is actually a full decade long and it starts with this guy,

983
00:58:46,285 --> 00:58:49,785
Speaker 16:  I'm ri Testa and I'm the founder of alt store developer of Delta

984
00:58:50,585 --> 00:58:54,065
Speaker 5:  RI has had, as you might expect, a pretty wild few weeks

985
00:58:54,445 --> 00:58:57,225
Speaker 5:  in the middle of it all. I asked him to come on the show and just tell me

986
00:58:57,225 --> 00:59:00,785
Speaker 5:  the whole Delta story, why he wanted to build an emulator in the first place,

987
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:04,985
Speaker 5:  how the regulatory and technological world changed around him and

988
00:59:05,205 --> 00:59:09,025
Speaker 5:  in general how Delta went from a big hack to a big

989
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:12,905
Speaker 5:  hit. It starts with RI in high school, just kind of looking for something

990
00:59:12,905 --> 00:59:13,185
Speaker 5:  to do.

991
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:17,905
Speaker 16:  I was just back in high school, I think it was my junior year and I just

992
00:59:18,285 --> 00:59:22,005
Speaker 16:  one day came across just like the open source repo

993
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:26,045
Speaker 16:  for a jailbreak game boy advanced simulator GPS phone. And

994
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:30,565
Speaker 16:  I was like, oh this is cool. This is all the code. I can probably just download

995
00:59:30,565 --> 00:59:33,525
Speaker 16:  this and tweak it and then put it on my own phone without having to jailbreak

996
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:36,445
Speaker 16:  because yeah, I've never been a fan of jailbreaking, it's just never really

997
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:40,405
Speaker 16:  appealed to me. So I found this code base, I hacked out

998
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:44,205
Speaker 16:  away for a couple months, put it on my phone, I

999
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:47,685
Speaker 16:  put it on a few of my friends' phones, they liked it and then I uploaded

1000
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:51,085
Speaker 16:  it to GitHub and called it GBA Fry West and then

1001
00:59:51,715 --> 00:59:55,685
Speaker 16:  kind of left it there for a bit and then people found

1002
00:59:55,685 --> 00:59:59,285
Speaker 16:  it on GitHub and started talking about it. And So I was like, oh,

1003
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,805
Speaker 16:  there's interest in this kind of thing.

1004
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:04,765
Speaker 5:  So you just made it as, as sort of a, it sounds like a mix of like a thing

1005
01:00:04,765 --> 01:00:07,485
Speaker 5:  that you thought would be useful and just kind of a thing to do.

1006
01:00:07,915 --> 01:00:10,685
Speaker 16:  Yeah, I just wanted Pokemon on my phone. That was literally just, I found

1007
01:00:10,685 --> 01:00:14,445
Speaker 16:  this, I was like, oh cool, I can Pokemon on my phone now and that's awesome.

1008
01:00:14,465 --> 01:00:17,445
Speaker 16:  And that's really all I was thinking at the time. And then I put on my friends'

1009
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:20,845
Speaker 16:  phones and then we were playing just Pokemon ourselves. And then just completely

1010
01:00:20,845 --> 01:00:24,405
Speaker 16:  coincidentally, there was this service that came out around the same time

1011
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:28,245
Speaker 16:  that let you connect like GI open source GitHub projects and

1012
01:00:28,595 --> 01:00:31,365
Speaker 16:  sign it with Apple's enterprise certificate. Basically there was a company

1013
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:34,285
Speaker 16:  that had enterprise certificate and you could just connect your GitHub account

1014
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:38,365
Speaker 16:  and then resign your apps like that. And So I was like, oh cool,

1015
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:41,805
Speaker 16:  I'll connect this to GBA for iOS and then people can install it outside

1016
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,605
Speaker 16:  the app store. Maybe a few people will download it. And that's basically

1017
01:00:44,605 --> 01:00:48,445
Speaker 16:  when I learned, oh wait, there's a huge demand for this thing.

1018
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:52,445
Speaker 16:  Oh interesting. I did that and then within like a week people

1019
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:55,365
Speaker 16:  were like posting videos about how to install it. There were lots of Reddit

1020
01:00:55,365 --> 01:00:59,045
Speaker 16:  posts and I was like honestly caught off guard. 'cause at this point it

1021
01:00:59,045 --> 01:01:01,765
Speaker 16:  was still just a project I made for me and my friends like in high school.

1022
01:01:01,865 --> 01:01:05,645
Speaker 16:  And so right then I was like, okay, there's demand for this thing. Let's

1023
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:09,605
Speaker 16:  take this seriously. Let's like build like a real version of this app that's

1024
01:01:09,605 --> 01:01:12,725
Speaker 16:  not like throwing together not hacky. And so that's when I got my friend

1025
01:01:12,955 --> 01:01:16,845
Speaker 16:  Paul Thorson on board, my also still in high school. And we were

1026
01:01:16,845 --> 01:01:20,285
Speaker 16:  like, we're gonna do a brand new version of GBA, fry Wests, GBA, fry Wests

1027
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:23,325
Speaker 16:  2.0. We're gonna redesign it from the ground up, just build it and make

1028
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:27,165
Speaker 16:  a really polished experience. And so we basically spent all of senior

1029
01:01:27,195 --> 01:01:31,165
Speaker 16:  year working on that and in like halfway through senior year

1030
01:01:31,185 --> 01:01:35,005
Speaker 16:  we released GBA for iOS 2.0 and that's the version that most people

1031
01:01:35,005 --> 01:01:37,965
Speaker 16:  know. That was the version that you installed from my website. You set your

1032
01:01:37,965 --> 01:01:41,805
Speaker 16:  date back like 24 hours and you can install it because of the weird bug

1033
01:01:41,805 --> 01:01:44,845
Speaker 16:  that allowed enterprise certificates to work that way, even if they're expired.

1034
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:45,405
Speaker 16:  Yeah.

1035
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:49,005
Speaker 5:  Wait, so real quick, just pause for a second and explain the enterprise

1036
01:01:49,365 --> 01:01:53,205
Speaker 5:  certificate thing to be, because I feel like part of the story here is like

1037
01:01:53,715 --> 01:01:57,525
Speaker 5:  Riley's adventures in figuring out how to install apps on phones.

1038
01:01:57,905 --> 01:02:01,245
Speaker 16:  Yes. Yeah. Slowly getting more and more complicated. Yeah. Yeah. So this

1039
01:02:01,345 --> 01:02:04,805
Speaker 16:  was the easiest hack is just, yeah, as long as I found an enterprise certificate,

1040
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:09,165
Speaker 16:  I could just sign GBA fors with it and literally anyone

1041
01:02:09,165 --> 01:02:11,605
Speaker 16:  could just download it from a website on the phone. Super simple.

1042
01:02:11,905 --> 01:02:14,605
Speaker 5:  And the idea is basically it's like that's the certificate you would use

1043
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:18,245
Speaker 5:  if I'm like a company wanting my employees and no one else to have that app,

1044
01:02:18,245 --> 01:02:21,885
Speaker 16:  Right? Yeah. The exact same flow. And so it's just, you're not supposed

1045
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:25,445
Speaker 16:  to do it for this reason. And so what Apple normally would do is

1046
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:28,565
Speaker 16:  they would just like revoke the certificate, they'd make it, this is no

1047
01:02:28,565 --> 01:02:31,765
Speaker 16:  longer valid and all apps that are signed with it can no longer be installed.

1048
01:02:32,105 --> 01:02:36,005
Speaker 16:  And so the bug that I took advantage of was apparently at this time, like

1049
01:02:36,005 --> 01:02:39,885
Speaker 16:  an I seven, If you just set your date back on your phone by

1050
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:43,445
Speaker 16:  more than an hour, the checks for whether a certificate is valid or not

1051
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:47,445
Speaker 16:  just don't work. They just don't do it. Sure. You did try to

1052
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:51,085
Speaker 16:  install GBA and Apple would've revoked the certificate, but because you

1053
01:02:51,085 --> 01:02:54,885
Speaker 16:  set your date back, iOS was fine installing it. And so it was just like

1054
01:02:54,885 --> 01:02:58,645
Speaker 16:  a really weird bug that I could take advantage of because there Apple

1055
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:02,525
Speaker 16:  couldn't do anything easily about it. They had to actually fix iOS to address

1056
01:03:02,525 --> 01:03:05,445
Speaker 16:  it. They couldn't just be like, okay, nope. Turn out certificate. It was

1057
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:08,805
Speaker 16:  about nine months later that they finally addressed it. And then that was

1058
01:03:08,805 --> 01:03:12,725
Speaker 16:  when I moved on basically from GBA for iOS is when they, it was like iOS

1059
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:16,605
Speaker 16:  8.1, they killed the date trick. It was literally on my birthday

1060
01:03:16,605 --> 01:03:19,925
Speaker 16:  when it actually happened and I was like, oh that's funny. But honestly

1061
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:22,365
Speaker 16:  at that point I had just gone to college and So I was like, you know what,

1062
01:03:22,705 --> 01:03:26,645
Speaker 16:  I'm gonna move on from this whole thing. GBA fires is really cool. I wanted

1063
01:03:26,645 --> 01:03:27,565
Speaker 16:  to go on to the next thing.

1064
01:03:27,785 --> 01:03:31,045
Speaker 5:  Do you know how many people were using GBA for iOS? Like at that sort of

1065
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:32,605
Speaker 5:  peak moment before it got shut down?

1066
01:03:34,165 --> 01:03:37,965
Speaker 16:  A lot of people like more than 10 million for sure.

1067
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:42,045
Speaker 5:  Wow. Whoa. Yeah. That's like a zero or two bigger than I thought

1068
01:03:42,045 --> 01:03:42,685
Speaker 5:  you were gonna say.

1069
01:03:42,835 --> 01:03:46,605
Speaker 16:  Yeah. There was a stupid amount of people using GBA FarWest, which

1070
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:50,365
Speaker 16:  is why I was so motivated to do this for this whole time was I just knew

1071
01:03:50,475 --> 01:03:53,965
Speaker 16:  that there was a market for this kind of thing that everyone just kind of

1072
01:03:53,965 --> 01:03:57,045
Speaker 16:  assumed there wasn't. But I'm like, no GVA got 10 million downloads outside

1073
01:03:57,045 --> 01:04:00,805
Speaker 16:  the app store. Like it's just people just really wanna do this, like play

1074
01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:01,205
Speaker 16:  old games.

1075
01:04:01,635 --> 01:04:05,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Okay. So you kind of, you're sort of forced to shut down that

1076
01:04:05,605 --> 01:04:08,805
Speaker 5:  project a little bit. Yeah. Was there a moment where you're like, okay, I'm

1077
01:04:08,805 --> 01:04:12,685
Speaker 5:  ready to go to war with Apple, let's fight this to the death and figure

1078
01:04:12,685 --> 01:04:16,365
Speaker 5:  out how to get GBA for iOS back? Or when it, when the sort of exploit gets

1079
01:04:16,365 --> 01:04:19,445
Speaker 5:  shut down, do you just kind of say, you know what, like you said, I'm going

1080
01:04:19,445 --> 01:04:23,085
Speaker 5:  to college anyway, this is just a moment, let me focus on other things.

1081
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:25,765
Speaker 16:  It is basically that. Yeah. I was like, you know what, this is just a sign

1082
01:04:25,765 --> 01:04:29,565
Speaker 16:  that I should move on to something else. So this was really cool. I'm glad

1083
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,565
Speaker 16:  I got to do this, got a lot of experience but may I'll try to make an app

1084
01:04:32,565 --> 01:04:34,725
Speaker 16:  in the app store next time. That was what I was thinking. I'm like, this

1085
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:38,165
Speaker 16:  is a lot of work to have an app outside the app store. Yeah. So then that

1086
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:41,205
Speaker 16:  whole thought process lasted like a few months and then I got bored and

1087
01:04:41,205 --> 01:04:45,005
Speaker 16:  I needed a new app to work on. And so yeah, swift had also just been announced

1088
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:48,525
Speaker 16:  like the previous year and So I was like, oh you know what, lemme just make

1089
01:04:48,525 --> 01:04:52,485
Speaker 16:  another toy app for myself to learn Swift just for me. And you know

1090
01:04:52,485 --> 01:04:55,645
Speaker 16:  what? I'll make another emulator, it'll have more systems, but it's just

1091
01:04:55,645 --> 01:04:58,485
Speaker 16:  for me, like I'm again like it's just like a fun thing I wanted to work

1092
01:04:58,485 --> 01:05:01,005
Speaker 16:  on to learn Swift. That was like my entire motivation. So you're

1093
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:04,445
Speaker 5:  Just run the exact same playbook again. Yeah. Without even realizing

1094
01:05:04,445 --> 01:05:07,405
Speaker 16:  It. Exactly. I was like, you know, I'm just gonna make for fun. Yeah, I

1095
01:05:07,405 --> 01:05:08,725
Speaker 16:  know. You'd think I'd learn at some point.

1096
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:11,965
Speaker 5:  Okay, so and that's where Delta starts.

1097
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:15,565
Speaker 16:  Yes. And so that's the beginning of Delta was like, okay, I'll call it Delta

1098
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:18,685
Speaker 16:  and just build it for fun and that is what I thought I was gonna be working

1099
01:05:18,685 --> 01:05:22,645
Speaker 16:  on. And then I went to WDC that year. It was my

1100
01:05:22,645 --> 01:05:23,885
Speaker 16:  first time ever at WWDC.

1101
01:05:24,075 --> 01:05:25,045
Speaker 5:  What year is this at this

1102
01:05:25,045 --> 01:05:28,965
Speaker 16:  Point? 2015. Okay. So I go to WC and I talk to the

1103
01:05:28,965 --> 01:05:31,845
Speaker 16:  app review team like, 'cause they have like a lab there and I basically

1104
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:35,565
Speaker 16:  just say, Hey, I'm working on this EM other app, is there

1105
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:39,285
Speaker 16:  any world that it could be approved in the app store? And then they were

1106
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:42,845
Speaker 16:  like, actually yeah, we'll allow that. You just gotta like comply with some

1107
01:05:42,845 --> 01:05:46,245
Speaker 16:  weird things. Basically they said I had to like submit a list of approved

1108
01:05:46,245 --> 01:05:49,565
Speaker 16:  games to them whenever I submitted a version of Delta so that could, they

1109
01:05:49,565 --> 01:05:53,325
Speaker 16:  could just make sure all the games at Delta supports were safe. Like they

1110
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:56,165
Speaker 16:  just didn't wanna have like an open pipeline of like games and everything.

1111
01:05:56,585 --> 01:06:00,205
Speaker 16:  And So I like, okay fine that works for me. I'll submit a version of Delta

1112
01:06:00,205 --> 01:06:03,125
Speaker 16:  to you and I'll have like a a list of games that you can play and then every

1113
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,525
Speaker 16:  app update I'll expand it to include more games. And

1114
01:06:06,905 --> 01:06:10,245
Speaker 16:  it seemed like that would be something I could do. And So I was really motivated.

1115
01:06:10,305 --> 01:06:13,365
Speaker 16:  I'm like cool, I'm gonna get Delta in the app store. And so then I spent

1116
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:17,205
Speaker 16:  the next year like actually building it for real. I was like okay, this

1117
01:06:17,205 --> 01:06:20,925
Speaker 16:  is now a real app no longer just for me. I like really want it to be

1118
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:24,205
Speaker 16:  polished, I want it to be good. I took a lot of my time, I got on my college

1119
01:06:24,445 --> 01:06:28,325
Speaker 16:  schedule to be working on it and then I went to the WWE C next year

1120
01:06:28,825 --> 01:06:32,765
Speaker 16:  and I talked to the same person and I said, Hey, I'm ready to submit,

1121
01:06:33,145 --> 01:06:34,845
Speaker 16:  can I submit it now? And he was just like,

1122
01:06:36,635 --> 01:06:40,335
Speaker 16:  So I talked to some people we can't allow

1123
01:06:40,335 --> 01:06:44,015
Speaker 16:  Ambulator and that was just all I got. I didn't get a

1124
01:06:44,235 --> 01:06:47,295
Speaker 16:  why. It was just like a, we can't allow that.

1125
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:49,495
Speaker 16:  And then I was just pissed off.

1126
01:06:50,035 --> 01:06:53,975
Speaker 5:  Do you think this person was wrong the first time they told you it

1127
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:57,495
Speaker 5:  would happen or do you think something happened in that year and they changed

1128
01:06:57,495 --> 01:06:57,855
Speaker 5:  their mind?

1129
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:01,535
Speaker 16:  Honestly, I don't know. It's either one's possible. My guess is though that

1130
01:07:01,535 --> 01:07:04,375
Speaker 16:  they thought it was okay and then they talked to someone in the year and

1131
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:07,575
Speaker 16:  then maybe they just had discussions about it and then they came away basically

1132
01:07:07,575 --> 01:07:10,655
Speaker 16:  like it's not worth the risk because I think that's what it's been this

1133
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:13,495
Speaker 16:  whole time. Apple is like, it's not worth the risk to allow these emulates,

1134
01:07:13,495 --> 01:07:16,815
Speaker 16:  there's so much stuff that could open up. So I think they're just like,

1135
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:20,255
Speaker 16:  eh, it's one kid, whatever, we don't need to allow his app in the app store

1136
01:07:20,255 --> 01:07:20,815
Speaker 16:  and it'll be fine.

1137
01:07:21,195 --> 01:07:24,615
Speaker 5:  And at that point, I mean I I, I confess I was late to the

1138
01:07:25,395 --> 01:07:29,255
Speaker 5:  iOS emulation universe, but it, it seemed, it's a weird thing

1139
01:07:29,255 --> 01:07:33,135
Speaker 5:  like GBA for iOS was huge and then it kind of went away. And So I

1140
01:07:33,135 --> 01:07:36,495
Speaker 5:  would assume we're back to like lots of pent up demand. People are very excited

1141
01:07:36,495 --> 01:07:40,095
Speaker 5:  about it. So it's not like you're the first person in history to ask Apple

1142
01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:44,055
Speaker 5:  this question, I'm sure. But at that point emulation was just kind of, it

1143
01:07:44,055 --> 01:07:47,735
Speaker 5:  was sort of nowhere on the iPhone. So I guess for them to say no, we're going

1144
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:51,015
Speaker 5:  to continue to not allow it is not totally out of character.

1145
01:07:51,045 --> 01:07:54,975
Speaker 16:  Exactly. Like yeah, I wasn't surprised. I was just pissed off. Like I

1146
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:58,775
Speaker 16:  was just like, I wasted a year of my life working on this and

1147
01:07:58,935 --> 01:08:01,055
Speaker 16:  'cause you told me I could release it. That was really just all I was feeling.

1148
01:08:01,405 --> 01:08:01,695
Speaker 16:  Yeah,

1149
01:08:01,695 --> 01:08:05,455
Speaker 5:  That's fair. That's fair. So what do you, at that moment you're faced again

1150
01:08:05,455 --> 01:08:09,015
Speaker 5:  with this same decision of like, okay, do I just call this a

1151
01:08:09,015 --> 01:08:11,775
Speaker 5:  successful project, I learned how to use Swift, let me just move on with

1152
01:08:11,775 --> 01:08:15,645
Speaker 5:  my life or do I go the other way? I know the answer. Yeah. Historically

1153
01:08:15,845 --> 01:08:18,445
Speaker 5:  speaking but what, what is that? What do you, what is that moment like?

1154
01:08:18,555 --> 01:08:22,525
Speaker 16:  Yeah and this time I was just so pissed off. I was just like, you know,

1155
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:26,845
Speaker 16:  this is not okay. I am gonna get this out there somehow. It's just like

1156
01:08:26,845 --> 01:08:29,325
Speaker 16:  really what I came to and I didn't, at that point I really didn't know what

1157
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:32,845
Speaker 16:  it would be, but I was just like, I just wanted to show Apple that they

1158
01:08:32,845 --> 01:08:35,285
Speaker 16:  can't treat developers kinda like this. It was really just like, I was like,

1159
01:08:35,465 --> 01:08:38,205
Speaker 16:  you can't treat us like this. You can't tell us one thing and then change

1160
01:08:38,205 --> 01:08:40,805
Speaker 16:  your mind the next year 'cause real people are spending real time doing

1161
01:08:40,805 --> 01:08:44,525
Speaker 16:  this kind of thing. So I, yeah, I just motivated to just, I dunno, prove

1162
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:47,445
Speaker 16:  them wrong. This is the best I could say. And so yeah, I was like, I'll

1163
01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:48,125
Speaker 16:  figure out a way.

1164
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:52,445
Speaker 5:  So then next project is figure out a way like how

1165
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:53,645
Speaker 5:  do you, how do you even start?

1166
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:57,925
Speaker 16:  I just got lucky honestly, apple had also just around that time made

1167
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:01,485
Speaker 16:  it so that you can install apps from Xcode for free

1168
01:09:01,675 --> 01:09:05,085
Speaker 16:  with a free Apple ID that like they just changed that rule of right around

1169
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:08,765
Speaker 16:  now so that students could start developing. And So I saw that and I was

1170
01:09:08,765 --> 01:09:12,405
Speaker 16:  like, wait, you can install apps for free If you just have an Apple

1171
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:16,205
Speaker 16:  id. There's something there. Like I was like that's all the technical

1172
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:19,565
Speaker 16:  thing I needed to, I could make something from that. And so that was just

1173
01:09:19,565 --> 01:09:22,485
Speaker 16:  like the beginning of Alt store. I was like okay, I gotta do something with

1174
01:09:22,485 --> 01:09:26,325
Speaker 16:  this free Apple ID side loading from Xcode thing

1175
01:09:26,325 --> 01:09:30,285
Speaker 16:  that Apple has just announced. And then I was basically just like

1176
01:09:30,595 --> 01:09:34,485
Speaker 16:  took a few years to research that, build it up, find out

1177
01:09:34,485 --> 01:09:37,525
Speaker 16:  what would be the most convenient flow 'cause yeah, there are a lot of obstacles

1178
01:09:37,525 --> 01:09:41,325
Speaker 16:  with that. It was apps installed this way only could last seven days. You

1179
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:45,125
Speaker 16:  could only have three apps installed at a time this method. So it was just

1180
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:48,725
Speaker 16:  like kind of trying to come up with creative ways to make a lot of these

1181
01:09:48,725 --> 01:09:52,405
Speaker 16:  restrictions not as annoying. Like the fact that Alt Server's a thing was

1182
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:55,405
Speaker 16:  the number one that alt server could just refresh your apps every week in

1183
01:09:55,405 --> 01:09:58,765
Speaker 16:  the background. And when I thought of that, that's when I was like, okay,

1184
01:09:59,525 --> 01:10:02,605
Speaker 16:  I think there's something here we can at least work with that's good enough.

1185
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:07,165
Speaker 5:  So when did the first version of alt store like work,

1186
01:10:07,395 --> 01:10:09,685
Speaker 5:  what was sort of the first version of it that you had that you were like,

1187
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:11,965
Speaker 5:  okay I this, this does the thing that I need it to do?

1188
01:10:13,045 --> 01:10:16,845
Speaker 16:  I think that was 2019 is when I finally like had put

1189
01:10:17,085 --> 01:10:21,045
Speaker 16:  together all the pieces into One Flow, whereas in like I had a program on

1190
01:10:21,045 --> 01:10:24,525
Speaker 16:  a computer that could install Alt store onto my phone and then Alt Store

1191
01:10:24,645 --> 01:10:27,845
Speaker 16:  could send apps to that device or to my computer and then reinstall it.

1192
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:32,165
Speaker 16:  And then it was early 2019 I was like, okay, this

1193
01:10:32,185 --> 01:10:35,405
Speaker 16:  can work. Okay. Like just seeing it actually work in practice, it was totally

1194
01:10:35,495 --> 01:10:38,405
Speaker 16:  janky. Like the UI was horrible, but just like the fact I could press a

1195
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:41,885
Speaker 16:  button on my phone and it would do everything, send it to Alt Server and

1196
01:10:41,885 --> 01:10:43,845
Speaker 16:  install it was just honestly kind of magical.

1197
01:10:44,345 --> 01:10:48,125
Speaker 5:  So explain to me why that worked okay in in the sort of infrastructure of

1198
01:10:48,275 --> 01:10:51,325
Speaker 5:  Apple's Universe. Like why did that system work?

1199
01:10:51,555 --> 01:10:55,445
Speaker 16:  Because, so the way Apple allows students to test out their apps

1200
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:59,325
Speaker 16:  is they have to have a Mac and they have to be using Xcode and they have

1201
01:10:59,325 --> 01:11:03,045
Speaker 16:  to plug their phone into Xcode and then they have to install an app

1202
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:06,685
Speaker 16:  from Xcode onto the phone. Like you can't just download a file and do it.

1203
01:11:06,685 --> 01:11:10,485
Speaker 16:  It's all through Xcode and all through a computer. And so Alt

1204
01:11:10,485 --> 01:11:14,365
Speaker 16:  Server is basically replicating everything Xcode does.

1205
01:11:14,825 --> 01:11:18,365
Speaker 16:  You can have an app file, but iOS can't install an app file on itself. You

1206
01:11:18,365 --> 01:11:22,045
Speaker 16:  have to send it to a computer. And then Alt Server does the same stuff

1207
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:25,365
Speaker 16:  Xcode does behind the scenes to install it back onto the phone as if you're

1208
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:26,565
Speaker 16:  a developer testing out yourself.

1209
01:11:26,905 --> 01:11:30,845
Speaker 5:  Got it. Okay. And you were able to basically build a thing that lets anyone

1210
01:11:31,475 --> 01:11:35,285
Speaker 5:  kind of mimic that system for themselves? Yes. When I set it up it was,

1211
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:38,045
Speaker 5:  I wouldn't say it was a lot of work, but it wasn't no work.

1212
01:11:38,435 --> 01:11:42,325
Speaker 16:  It's, yeah, it's a lot. It's a bit, yeah. Especially on the Mac, there's

1213
01:11:42,325 --> 01:11:46,285
Speaker 16:  the mail plugin for a long time that was just, oh yeah, really it was,

1214
01:11:46,355 --> 01:11:49,845
Speaker 16:  yeah, it was confusing to everyone and I was like, oh this is too nerdy

1215
01:11:49,845 --> 01:11:53,765
Speaker 16:  to try to explain even to people why it matters but just, yeah. Yeah, people

1216
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:54,325
Speaker 16:  got through it.

1217
01:11:55,275 --> 01:11:58,365
Speaker 5:  Well so, and this is, this is, I feel like the, the sort of ongoing story

1218
01:11:58,365 --> 01:12:01,645
Speaker 5:  here is you're, you're finding these increasingly complicated ways to do

1219
01:12:01,645 --> 01:12:05,605
Speaker 5:  this and continuing discover that there is so much demand for something like

1220
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:09,165
Speaker 5:  Delta that people will jump through basically any hoops that you ask them

1221
01:12:09,165 --> 01:12:10,525
Speaker 5:  to jump through in order to do this.

1222
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:14,765
Speaker 16:  Yeah, the biggest thing I was surprised about with Al stores, we need to

1223
01:12:14,785 --> 01:12:18,325
Speaker 16:  get your Apple ID and password to like log in with your account.

1224
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:22,045
Speaker 16:  And I was like, wow, we really are just asking people to trust us and give

1225
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:24,965
Speaker 16:  us your Apple ID and password. And I mean we're, we do everything we can

1226
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:27,245
Speaker 16:  with it. We literally don't touch ourselves, we send it straight to Apple.

1227
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:31,365
Speaker 16:  But I was like, ooh, that's a big scary thing that you really

1228
01:12:31,365 --> 01:12:34,005
Speaker 16:  just aren't supposed to give your password to random people. And then nope,

1229
01:12:34,005 --> 01:12:36,645
Speaker 16:  people are still giving us their password as if they don't care. And I'm

1230
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:40,485
Speaker 16:  like, this is cool, but also makes you nervous for security as a whole

1231
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:42,805
Speaker 16:  that people are just doing, just not thinking about it. Oh,

1232
01:12:42,805 --> 01:12:45,405
Speaker 5:  For sure. And it puts you in a really interesting position I would think

1233
01:12:45,425 --> 01:12:49,405
Speaker 5:  as the, as the developer this to say, okay, what is this

1234
01:12:49,405 --> 01:12:53,165
Speaker 5:  thing? Like am I just building this as sort of a fun side project

1235
01:12:53,305 --> 01:12:56,605
Speaker 5:  for people who wanna play Pokemon on their phones? Which comes with I think

1236
01:12:56,665 --> 01:13:00,365
Speaker 5:  one set of like security and privacy implications. Like

1237
01:13:00,765 --> 01:13:04,725
Speaker 5:  to some extent, honestly, If you send your Apple ID and password to

1238
01:13:04,725 --> 01:13:07,925
Speaker 5:  just a dude, I don't think you have any reasonable expectation of privacy.

1239
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:10,605
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Like I think it's a good thing Exactly that you were taking care

1240
01:13:10,605 --> 01:13:14,045
Speaker 5:  of people's privacy as best you could. But I think for me as the user,

1241
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,365
Speaker 5:  I deserve what I'm getting at that point, right? Yeah, yeah. But then if

1242
01:13:17,365 --> 01:13:20,245
Speaker 5:  you're, if you're like a company that is, that has a terms of service and

1243
01:13:20,245 --> 01:13:22,845
Speaker 5:  is set up to make money and you're like, we're in this for the long haul

1244
01:13:22,845 --> 01:13:26,805
Speaker 5:  and we're serious about it, I think that changes both the way you have to

1245
01:13:26,805 --> 01:13:30,045
Speaker 5:  treat stuff and the way that I can expect you to treat stuff. Yes. And it

1246
01:13:30,045 --> 01:13:32,405
Speaker 5:  seems like as you were going through this, you were also trying to decide

1247
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:36,445
Speaker 5:  like how professionalized do I want this thing to be?

1248
01:13:36,785 --> 01:13:37,685
Speaker 5:  Is that, is that fair?

1249
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:41,125
Speaker 16:  That's pretty fair because when the first version of Al Store that launched

1250
01:13:41,665 --> 01:13:45,325
Speaker 16:  was literally just like a Delta installer. The only app in it was Delta.

1251
01:13:45,585 --> 01:13:49,445
Speaker 16:  It could install Delta. And I just knew that was important. But

1252
01:13:49,445 --> 01:13:53,405
Speaker 16:  even at that point I knew I wanted alt store to be a bigger platform. That

1253
01:13:53,405 --> 01:13:55,925
Speaker 16:  was like kind of what motivated it was like I didn't wanna build a whole

1254
01:13:56,045 --> 01:13:59,205
Speaker 16:  nother workaround just to install Delta. The fact that I could do it for

1255
01:13:59,365 --> 01:14:02,325
Speaker 16:  alt store and for other apps too made it more appealing to me. I was like

1256
01:14:02,325 --> 01:14:05,325
Speaker 16:  fine, I can do the work and then lots of other apps can take advantage of

1257
01:14:05,325 --> 01:14:08,725
Speaker 16:  it. And so it was always the plan to expand beyond Delta,

1258
01:14:09,265 --> 01:14:12,845
Speaker 16:  but I just didn't know really what that would look like until probably like

1259
01:14:12,925 --> 01:14:15,325
Speaker 16:  a year or so after we launched and I started, we started actually having

1260
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:19,165
Speaker 16:  some third party apps wanting to be on the store. And then I got a sense

1261
01:14:19,165 --> 01:14:22,885
Speaker 16:  of, okay, this is the type of apps people wanted install, this is what I

1262
01:14:22,885 --> 01:14:25,445
Speaker 16:  gotta be dealing with. And yeah, that's helped a lot.

1263
01:14:25,785 --> 01:14:28,605
Speaker 5:  See so what, what was that like? We're gonna get into the kind of

1264
01:14:29,355 --> 01:14:33,325
Speaker 5:  history moved towards you a little bit aspect of this in just a

1265
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:37,245
Speaker 5:  sec, but I am curious in that moment the idea of like, I'm gonna get my third

1266
01:14:37,245 --> 01:14:40,885
Speaker 5:  party app store to be sort of, you know, legitimate in

1267
01:14:40,885 --> 01:14:44,285
Speaker 5:  Apple's eyes Yeah. Was completely off the table like 20 19, 20 20. There

1268
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:47,365
Speaker 5:  was just no world in which that was gonna happen. But you're like, you're

1269
01:14:47,365 --> 01:14:50,525
Speaker 5:  talking about, you know, other apps that want to do this kind of stuff. What

1270
01:14:50,525 --> 01:14:53,885
Speaker 5:  were you starting to see? What was kind of the, the like unifying thesis

1271
01:14:53,945 --> 01:14:56,405
Speaker 5:  behind apps that wanted to be part of this thing you were doing?

1272
01:14:57,285 --> 01:15:00,125
Speaker 16:  I, I mean at first it was just any app that wasn't allowed in the app store.

1273
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:03,685
Speaker 16:  Okay. And honestly it is still a big appeal date. It's like for whatever

1274
01:15:03,685 --> 01:15:06,965
Speaker 16:  reason that was rejected for whatever type of rule, they just could be the

1275
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,405
Speaker 16:  app store and so then they'd see alt store and then they'd be like, oh an

1276
01:15:09,405 --> 01:15:13,085
Speaker 16:  alternative. There are a lot of emulators like obviously. Sure. So there

1277
01:15:13,085 --> 01:15:16,205
Speaker 16:  are plenty of those. There's stuff you can expect. Like I Torrent had like

1278
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:19,205
Speaker 16:  an app and you can be like, yeah, I can see why Apple wouldn't approve it.

1279
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:22,765
Speaker 16:  But stuff like that. UTM, the virtual machine app, just

1280
01:15:23,235 --> 01:15:26,845
Speaker 16:  running Windows on your iPad, really cool. Not loud in the app store. So

1281
01:15:26,905 --> 01:15:30,765
Speaker 16:  it was just like a bunch of different random project or another

1282
01:15:30,765 --> 01:15:34,125
Speaker 16:  one I liked what that I think is really cool. Old os, If you've heard of

1283
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:37,885
Speaker 16:  that one. No it's so, it's like a high schooler just recreated iOS

1284
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:41,885
Speaker 16:  four in Swift ui and so it's just like the whole exp If you

1285
01:15:41,885 --> 01:15:44,885
Speaker 16:  open the app and it's the home screen from iOS four, you can open all the

1286
01:15:44,885 --> 01:15:48,045
Speaker 16:  apps and it looks exactly like it did back in the day. Oh that's awesome.

1287
01:15:48,065 --> 01:15:51,965
Speaker 16:  And it's really cool. And so it's just like, oh a fun little idea that not

1288
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:55,725
Speaker 16:  allowed an app store. So yeah, a bunch of stuff like that. So I launched

1289
01:15:56,005 --> 01:15:58,805
Speaker 16:  alt store and the first year was really great but the first year was also

1290
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:02,845
Speaker 16:  a lot and it was just me working on at the time. And then I honestly was

1291
01:16:02,845 --> 01:16:06,405
Speaker 16:  like, what am I doing here? Am I gonna keep with alt store?

1292
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:10,245
Speaker 16:  Is this ever gonna be a real thing? Should I just like move on to something

1293
01:16:10,245 --> 01:16:13,165
Speaker 16:  else Now I was really going, trying to figure out what I wanna do and then

1294
01:16:13,165 --> 01:16:17,045
Speaker 16:  it was really that point I realized what I wanted was I saw basically that

1295
01:16:17,145 --> 01:16:20,845
Speaker 16:  the US was investigating Apple and that the EU was investigating Apple

1296
01:16:20,845 --> 01:16:24,605
Speaker 16:  around this time. And I was like, you know what? I feel like there is gonna

1297
01:16:24,605 --> 01:16:28,045
Speaker 16:  be something that happens in the next few years. I wanna be ready for that

1298
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:32,085
Speaker 16:  but I need help. And that's when I basically brought on my partner Shane

1299
01:16:32,115 --> 01:16:35,565
Speaker 16:  Gill, who's my best friend and I've lived with for like 10 years. And I

1300
01:16:35,565 --> 01:16:38,965
Speaker 16:  was like, Hey, I need you with this with me. I need just do it together.

1301
01:16:39,445 --> 01:16:42,325
Speaker 16:  I need you to do all the business stuff. And So I can just focus on the

1302
01:16:42,325 --> 01:16:45,885
Speaker 16:  programming and then we can make that happen. And at that point we started

1303
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:50,365
Speaker 16:  like making the plans for what alt store is today or at least an alt store

1304
01:16:50,365 --> 01:16:51,365
Speaker 16:  in the EU alt store pal.

1305
01:16:51,555 --> 01:16:55,045
Speaker 5:  Okay. So you, you actually really were betting on the theory that eventually

1306
01:16:55,675 --> 01:16:59,525
Speaker 5:  this was gonna be a real thing that you could do and not just

1307
01:16:59,525 --> 01:17:01,445
Speaker 5:  sort of a series of ever more elaborate hack.

1308
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:05,765
Speaker 16:  Yes. Yeah. By that time I was convinced it would happen. Just I didn't

1309
01:17:05,765 --> 01:17:07,605
Speaker 16:  know when but just at some point in the future.

1310
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:11,405
Speaker 5:  That's fair. Okay. So, and this was like peak

1311
01:17:11,645 --> 01:17:15,445
Speaker 5:  COVD if I'm, if I'm doing my timing math here correctly, everything's weird

1312
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:17,485
Speaker 5:  at this time and you're like, well let's, let's just go

1313
01:17:17,505 --> 01:17:20,485
Speaker 16:  For it. Everything's weird. I'm, yeah, everyone's reevaluating their lives.

1314
01:17:20,745 --> 01:17:23,765
Speaker 16:  My original plan was, I was like, Hey Shane, let's move to New Zealand together.

1315
01:17:23,815 --> 01:17:26,925
Speaker 16:  Let's just escape everything. Let's build this in New Zealand. 'cause I'm

1316
01:17:27,045 --> 01:17:30,925
Speaker 16:  a New Zealand citizen so it'd be cool to go home for me. But that didn't

1317
01:17:30,925 --> 01:17:34,125
Speaker 16:  work out. It was too hard to get New Zealand during Covid. Yeah, understandably

1318
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:36,845
Speaker 16:  So. We're in Dallas now, which is the same thing. It's

1319
01:17:36,845 --> 01:17:37,725
Speaker 5:  Like this close Yeah.

1320
01:17:37,855 --> 01:17:38,645
Speaker 16:  Space. It's

1321
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:43,725
Speaker 5:  Okay. So you start building this thing and was the idea

1322
01:17:43,985 --> 01:17:47,965
Speaker 5:  we want to build sort of a full app store? Like was

1323
01:17:47,965 --> 01:17:49,685
Speaker 5:  that is is it as simple as that? That was the pitch.

1324
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:52,365
Speaker 16:  Yeah. When Shane Karen board, that was the full pitch. Like we're gonna

1325
01:17:52,365 --> 01:17:56,285
Speaker 16:  build a real app store and show people what life could be like if there

1326
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:59,125
Speaker 16:  were other apps. Just like just be the example and then whenever it was

1327
01:17:59,325 --> 01:18:00,925
Speaker 16:  official be the official like be an official store.

1328
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:04,205
Speaker 5:  And what was, what were developers saying? Were you like reaching out to

1329
01:18:04,205 --> 01:18:06,805
Speaker 5:  folks being like, do you wanna be part of this and what were they telling

1330
01:18:06,805 --> 01:18:06,965
Speaker 5:  you?

1331
01:18:07,485 --> 01:18:09,565
Speaker 16:  Honestly, we didn't need to be reaching out to anyone. People were just

1332
01:18:09,725 --> 01:18:13,045
Speaker 16:  reaching out to us. Like there are a lot of people who just have app ideas

1333
01:18:13,075 --> 01:18:16,285
Speaker 16:  that just aren't getting in the app store and just, and even I'm like, wow,

1334
01:18:16,285 --> 01:18:19,205
Speaker 16:  there are just so many apps that like were getting like reaching out to

1335
01:18:19,205 --> 01:18:23,085
Speaker 16:  us. I'm like Oh wow, that was rejected. That was rejected. So we just,

1336
01:18:23,085 --> 01:18:24,405
Speaker 16:  yeah, people just reaching out for us.

1337
01:18:24,715 --> 01:18:28,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And were you having any contact with Apple at this point? Obvi,

1338
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:31,965
Speaker 5:  other than you know, those two conversations at WBDC, was there any inclination

1339
01:18:31,965 --> 01:18:34,565
Speaker 5:  that Apple was even sort of aware of your existence throughout this process?

1340
01:18:35,385 --> 01:18:39,245
Speaker 16:  We did. At one point when the EU started investigating stuff,

1341
01:18:39,985 --> 01:18:43,685
Speaker 16:  me and Shane sent an email to the executives of Apple basically saying,

1342
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:47,965
Speaker 16:  Hey y'all, I think the EU may be going too much and do you

1343
01:18:47,965 --> 01:18:51,405
Speaker 16:  like we just reach out, Hey like we're here and we don't want like a crazy

1344
01:18:51,405 --> 01:18:55,205
Speaker 16:  world of side loading. Do you wanna like be on the same page here? And they

1345
01:18:55,205 --> 01:18:58,685
Speaker 16:  didn't respond at all. But we were at the time just thinking we don't want

1346
01:18:58,725 --> 01:19:02,245
Speaker 16:  a crazy free for all. And that's what it seemed like maybe the EU was gonna

1347
01:19:02,245 --> 01:19:05,725
Speaker 16:  be, we wanted a more restricted siloing world where the app store

1348
01:19:06,025 --> 01:19:09,685
Speaker 16:  was still the main app store. Why? I really think that's what makes

1349
01:19:09,905 --> 01:19:13,405
Speaker 16:  iOS so good for like the disaster people. Like it is just so simple that

1350
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:17,365
Speaker 16:  you can get any app that you trust through one store. I think that's

1351
01:19:17,365 --> 01:19:21,085
Speaker 16:  really valuable. It's why like so many people I know personally use an

1352
01:19:21,085 --> 01:19:25,045
Speaker 16:  iPhone that aren't techies. And So I just always knew that there needed

1353
01:19:25,045 --> 01:19:28,645
Speaker 16:  to be a way for siloing to exist without taking over the app store or taking

1354
01:19:28,645 --> 01:19:29,845
Speaker 16:  like so many apps away from it.

1355
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:34,085
Speaker 5:  Okay. So you then are watching the regulation stuff happening. Are you like

1356
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:38,365
Speaker 5:  barreling through all the, you know, DMA white papers and trying

1357
01:19:38,365 --> 01:19:41,685
Speaker 5:  to get the deep sense of what's going? Like how into this were you as that

1358
01:19:41,775 --> 01:19:42,885
Speaker 5:  regulation was happening

1359
01:19:43,155 --> 01:19:46,445
Speaker 16:  Once the DMA was like an actual thing and they were talking about it? Oh

1360
01:19:46,445 --> 01:19:49,365
Speaker 16:  yeah, we were very much deep in it and then we were just like, we gotta

1361
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:51,925
Speaker 16:  be ready for anything li because literally until Apple announced what they

1362
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:55,805
Speaker 16:  were doing, we just were like, are we gonna be a siloing tool? Are we

1363
01:19:55,965 --> 01:19:59,565
Speaker 16:  gonna be a full app store? Are we gonna exist at all? Like we just had no

1364
01:19:59,565 --> 01:20:03,005
Speaker 16:  idea what was gonna come next. We just knew that there would be some way

1365
01:20:03,005 --> 01:20:03,765
Speaker 16:  of installing apps.

1366
01:20:04,235 --> 01:20:08,045
Speaker 5:  Okay. And So I guess with that idea you can kind of keep

1367
01:20:08,285 --> 01:20:12,005
Speaker 5:  building Delta and Alt store the way you had been without making

1368
01:20:12,185 --> 01:20:15,485
Speaker 5:  too many kind of unchangeable decisions

1369
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:16,565
Speaker 5:  at that point?

1370
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:20,725
Speaker 16:  Yes. We basically were working on like stuff that we knew would be true

1371
01:20:20,825 --> 01:20:24,765
Speaker 16:  no matter what. Like we were building up like the UI for browsing apps and

1372
01:20:24,765 --> 01:20:28,325
Speaker 16:  like we were expanding like, or building the Patreon flow so that people

1373
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:31,885
Speaker 16:  could connect their Patreons and and install that. 'cause we just knew no

1374
01:20:31,885 --> 01:20:35,805
Speaker 16:  matter what, that would be good for this world. We just didn't go

1375
01:20:35,805 --> 01:20:38,085
Speaker 16:  into like the really technical stuff about like the actual installing process.

1376
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:41,445
Speaker 16:  Right. It was just basically making the app look as much like a store as

1377
01:20:41,445 --> 01:20:41,765
Speaker 16:  it could be.

1378
01:20:42,195 --> 01:20:45,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that makes sense. And at that point, how are you thinking about like

1379
01:20:45,545 --> 01:20:48,285
Speaker 5:  the business of Delta? You've been working on this thing for an awfully long

1380
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:51,565
Speaker 5:  time without making any money on it. I'm assuming there were conversations

1381
01:20:51,565 --> 01:20:54,725
Speaker 5:  about like how do we, how do we all get rich from this thing that clearly

1382
01:20:54,835 --> 01:20:55,685
Speaker 5:  lots of people want?

1383
01:20:56,245 --> 01:21:00,205
Speaker 16:  I, people do keep asking me but the thing that I've believed

1384
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:03,565
Speaker 16:  in and what Shane, like Shane, before he even joined Alt store, he was the

1385
01:21:03,565 --> 01:21:06,125
Speaker 16:  one that convinced me to make a Patreon for all this in the first place.

1386
01:21:06,745 --> 01:21:09,245
Speaker 16:  He was like, Hey, when you're working on Delta and Alt store, just have

1387
01:21:09,245 --> 01:21:12,925
Speaker 16:  a Patreon the side to support yourself. Because honestly I thought my original

1388
01:21:12,925 --> 01:21:15,485
Speaker 16:  plan was to release Alt store and Delta and then move on to something else.

1389
01:21:15,555 --> 01:21:18,605
Speaker 16:  Like, like just let it exist and let people install it. Let, Shane was the

1390
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:22,005
Speaker 16:  one telling me, no people wanna support creators right now.

1391
01:21:22,505 --> 01:21:26,205
Speaker 16:  You should just have a Patreon that people wanna subscribe to and just support

1392
01:21:26,205 --> 01:21:30,085
Speaker 16:  future development. And So I start, I launched alt store at that and

1393
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:34,205
Speaker 16:  it did really well. Like it has paid for everything ever since I launched,

1394
01:21:34,205 --> 01:21:38,005
Speaker 16:  started Alt store. We really believe that's a really important thing that

1395
01:21:38,005 --> 01:21:41,965
Speaker 16:  should exist. 'cause developers right now you can't sell apps through

1396
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:45,805
Speaker 16:  Patreon in the app store. And it's just such a really good way I think for

1397
01:21:46,005 --> 01:21:49,725
Speaker 16:  creators to build a, like a relationship with their audience and just, people

1398
01:21:49,795 --> 01:21:53,725
Speaker 16:  also don't mind spending a few bucks to a person but they do

1399
01:21:53,725 --> 01:21:56,845
Speaker 16:  mind spending a few bucks on an app. Yep. So it's just like very different

1400
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:00,685
Speaker 16:  relationship. And so we are basically just trying to really promote the

1401
01:22:00,685 --> 01:22:04,165
Speaker 16:  Patreon idea. Our own income basically is just through the Patreon.

1402
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:07,765
Speaker 16:  We're still selling or having access to our betas for our patrons

1403
01:22:08,185 --> 01:22:11,605
Speaker 16:  and that's worked out pretty well as a way of monetizing Delta honestly.

1404
01:22:12,075 --> 01:22:15,485
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah, I mean even just the idea of thinking of an app developer as

1405
01:22:15,565 --> 01:22:19,285
Speaker 5:  a creator in the same way that you think about like a content creator as

1406
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:22,965
Speaker 5:  a creator is really interesting and is totally not

1407
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:26,685
Speaker 5:  how most people perceive it. Right, exactly. And and I think, I think it's

1408
01:22:26,685 --> 01:22:29,765
Speaker 5:  coming around a little bit like personally at least I've seen a lot more

1409
01:22:30,385 --> 01:22:34,285
Speaker 5:  of the sort of bootstrapped one person app become

1410
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:37,525
Speaker 5:  a thing that people like in a way that I didn't and they like associate the

1411
01:22:37,525 --> 01:22:40,765
Speaker 5:  app with the person who makes it. Yes. Yeah. But I think for most people

1412
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:44,285
Speaker 5:  it's all so faceless, right? Yes. Like you just, it's just an app that exists.

1413
01:22:44,405 --> 01:22:47,525
Speaker 5:  I don't know if it's made by one person or 10,000 and I don't care. I'm just

1414
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:50,645
Speaker 5:  mad that they're charging me money and, and it's interesting to think that

1415
01:22:50,645 --> 01:22:53,845
Speaker 5:  like maybe the business model is part of the problem there that because it

1416
01:22:54,005 --> 01:22:57,085
Speaker 5:  all just sits in the app store and it is so divorced from

1417
01:22:57,675 --> 01:23:01,005
Speaker 5:  personality and people that maybe that's the problem. So actually connecting

1418
01:23:01,005 --> 01:23:03,885
Speaker 5:  Patreon to that is, is a really interesting way of just changing the way

1419
01:23:03,885 --> 01:23:07,445
Speaker 5:  people think about what like an app is and how it gets made.

1420
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:10,085
Speaker 16:  Yeah, exactly. And I'm so, yeah, I'm really excited for that. And I'll,

1421
01:23:10,155 --> 01:23:14,005
Speaker 16:  another nice benefit is we can just have our apps be

1422
01:23:14,005 --> 01:23:17,685
Speaker 16:  free and then people just get the betas and, but so it means there's no

1423
01:23:17,925 --> 01:23:21,085
Speaker 16:  features that are locked behind paywalls like forever. It's just a, you

1424
01:23:21,085 --> 01:23:24,925
Speaker 16:  can wait forever and get it for free. Or If you just want early access

1425
01:23:25,065 --> 01:23:28,885
Speaker 16:  you can donate. And I think that's more appealing to people to like when

1426
01:23:28,885 --> 01:23:32,405
Speaker 16:  they're trying to support an app versus, oh you've locked away a feature

1427
01:23:32,585 --> 01:23:36,485
Speaker 16:  and now I can never use it unless I pay. It's like, yeah, that difference

1428
01:23:36,485 --> 01:23:38,205
Speaker 16:  I think makes a huge deal. Yeah,

1429
01:23:38,225 --> 01:23:41,925
Speaker 5:  No, I, I totally agree. So, okay, so right before the

1430
01:23:42,005 --> 01:23:45,845
Speaker 5:  DMA drops in, I guess, what was it like March of this year

1431
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:49,205
Speaker 5:  when Apple put out its third party app store plans?

1432
01:23:49,585 --> 01:23:50,765
Speaker 16:  It was end of January. Yeah.

1433
01:23:50,995 --> 01:23:52,965
Speaker 5:  Okay. So this year, yeah, this year.

1434
01:23:53,015 --> 01:23:53,365
Speaker 16:  Apple

1435
01:23:53,655 --> 01:23:57,445
Speaker 5:  Right before that, what was kind of the status of Delta and

1436
01:23:57,785 --> 01:24:01,765
Speaker 5:  all store? It sounds like it's, it's growing. People are using it. Like

1437
01:24:01,785 --> 01:24:02,965
Speaker 5:  how, how were things?

1438
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:07,365
Speaker 16:  Things were good. We had like at that point, like 4 million users on

1439
01:24:07,725 --> 01:24:11,125
Speaker 16:  alt store, like just existing. I was like, oh wow, this is going great.

1440
01:24:11,685 --> 01:24:14,765
Speaker 16:  Things are going great. At Delta, we had been prioritizing basically a new

1441
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:17,405
Speaker 16:  version of Delta 1.5 to release

1442
01:24:18,155 --> 01:24:22,125
Speaker 16:  alongside whatever Apple announced. And so we just like,

1443
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:26,005
Speaker 16:  were working on that, but then basically by January we're just like, okay,

1444
01:24:26,365 --> 01:24:29,605
Speaker 16:  everything's in a good spot. We're ready to go. We just

1445
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:33,125
Speaker 16:  need to know what the hell is happening. And so we were just basically just

1446
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:37,085
Speaker 16:  waiting around to see like, okay, we can do

1447
01:24:37,085 --> 01:24:40,205
Speaker 16:  this. We have like the store had been finished by then, like all the UI

1448
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:43,645
Speaker 16:  was done, Delta was ready, clip was ready. So, so

1449
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:47,365
Speaker 5:  You, you have this thing and you're like, this exists, we made it, it's good.

1450
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:50,045
Speaker 5:  We have absolutely no idea what we're about to do with it.

1451
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:52,085
Speaker 16:  Exactly. That is exactly where we were. What

1452
01:24:52,085 --> 01:24:52,965
Speaker 5:  A strange place to

1453
01:24:52,965 --> 01:24:55,485
Speaker 16:  Be. It was very strange. It was, yeah. Just 'cause we're just, every day

1454
01:24:55,485 --> 01:24:59,125
Speaker 16:  we're like, what do we do? Like we can't move forward in a lot of things

1455
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:02,565
Speaker 16:  but, so it was just a lot of planning and strategizing.

1456
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:06,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that makes sense. So then end of January, apple drops

1457
01:25:06,645 --> 01:25:09,645
Speaker 5:  like a million press releases and technical documents about how all this

1458
01:25:09,645 --> 01:25:11,565
Speaker 5:  is gonna work. What, what happens to you on that day? What do you do?

1459
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:15,485
Speaker 16:  Wow. What? That was a overwhelming day like for sure.

1460
01:25:16,185 --> 01:25:19,725
Speaker 16:  And the first thing that we try to do is figure out, okay,

1461
01:25:20,465 --> 01:25:23,685
Speaker 16:  can we exist at all in this new world? Because yeah, there's all these like

1462
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:25,925
Speaker 16:  restrictions and we're trying to figure out what the hell like an alternative

1463
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:29,525
Speaker 16:  marketplace is and we're like, and so yes we're, we spend that whole day

1464
01:25:29,525 --> 01:25:33,085
Speaker 16:  basically trying just to parse We Apple's announced and then we

1465
01:25:33,365 --> 01:25:37,245
Speaker 16:  basically are like, okay, we think we can do this. We think we

1466
01:25:37,245 --> 01:25:40,685
Speaker 16:  can meet the criteria if we get very creative. 'cause yeah, the criteria

1467
01:25:40,685 --> 01:25:44,565
Speaker 16:  was like a lot of things like you needed to have like the

1468
01:25:44,565 --> 01:25:48,525
Speaker 16:  standby letter, we need to have a subsidiary in the eu. Right.

1469
01:25:48,525 --> 01:25:52,405
Speaker 16:  And just like a bunch of things that we just sat down like, okay,

1470
01:25:52,745 --> 01:25:56,405
Speaker 16:  we gotta make all this happen in a month basically. 'cause we're like, okay,

1471
01:25:56,405 --> 01:25:59,805
Speaker 16:  we have until March 7th was like the DMA compliance day. We're like, okay,

1472
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:04,365
Speaker 16:  let's set up a subsidiary. Let's get the standby figured out. Let's build

1473
01:26:04,365 --> 01:26:06,725
Speaker 16:  everything. 'cause also they announced all the stuff we had to build and

1474
01:26:06,725 --> 01:26:10,365
Speaker 16:  it's like, okay, let's build everything we need to do. And then for the

1475
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:14,085
Speaker 16:  next month was like extreme crunch time, just like getting

1476
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:17,485
Speaker 16:  everything done. Shane honestly was incredible. He was calling

1477
01:26:17,985 --> 01:26:21,725
Speaker 16:  so many countries to figure out where we could incorporate he Oh wow. We

1478
01:26:21,725 --> 01:26:24,325
Speaker 16:  finally incorporated in Ireland. So we have a nice subsidiary in Ireland,

1479
01:26:24,535 --> 01:26:27,885
Speaker 16:  which is great. He was the one talking to banks to get

1480
01:26:28,195 --> 01:26:32,165
Speaker 16:  someone to believe in two people who are trying to do something crazy

1481
01:26:32,505 --> 01:26:33,605
Speaker 16:  and they need this step. Yeah.

1482
01:26:33,665 --> 01:26:36,845
Speaker 5:  How hard was that process? You're like, so we build a game emulator and also

1483
01:26:37,455 --> 01:26:40,845
Speaker 5:  other app stores. I'm imagining a bunch of banks are just like, this is a

1484
01:26:40,845 --> 01:26:41,845
Speaker 5:  prank call and hang up on you

1485
01:26:42,245 --> 01:26:46,165
Speaker 16:  A lot did. Yeah. It so many people just like wouldn't listen to us. It was

1486
01:26:46,195 --> 01:26:49,325
Speaker 16:  true pure luck that we found one person, lo, his name's Logan,

1487
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:53,925
Speaker 16:  he just like Morgan Stanley and he was just understood what we

1488
01:26:53,925 --> 01:26:57,165
Speaker 16:  were doing and really wanted to go out of his way to help us.

1489
01:26:57,865 --> 01:27:01,285
Speaker 16:  And I honestly, if we had not met Logan, I don't know if we would've got

1490
01:27:01,285 --> 01:27:05,205
Speaker 16:  this all figured out, but he was like, okay, let's do this. I believe in

1491
01:27:05,205 --> 01:27:09,125
Speaker 16:  y'all. I can work with my bosses. We can make it happen. That that was a

1492
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:10,565
Speaker 16:  big win getting that one for sure.

1493
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:14,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean I remember when the news came out thinking that there were,

1494
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,845
Speaker 5:  like, you described a bunch of technical challenges, but there were always

1495
01:27:16,845 --> 01:27:18,965
Speaker 5:  gonna be a bunch of technical challenges, right? Yeah. I feel like that you,

1496
01:27:18,965 --> 01:27:22,765
Speaker 5:  you sort of know going in, there's gonna be a bunch of weird work you have

1497
01:27:22,765 --> 01:27:26,245
Speaker 5:  to do to get this thing to comply with what Apple wants. But the business

1498
01:27:26,605 --> 01:27:30,045
Speaker 5:  challenges of just like the, the hoops you had to jump through as an

1499
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:33,685
Speaker 5:  organization seemed like they were designed to keep almost everybody

1500
01:27:33,825 --> 01:27:37,125
Speaker 5:  out except for the, the truest of

1501
01:27:37,635 --> 01:27:41,365
Speaker 5:  true believers and maybe just the most stubborn people

1502
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:42,845
Speaker 5:  building this thing. Yes,

1503
01:27:42,915 --> 01:27:43,405
Speaker 16:  Exactly.

1504
01:27:43,585 --> 01:27:46,965
Speaker 5:  And, and part of me wonders if, if going back a few months, apple just deeply

1505
01:27:47,105 --> 01:27:50,885
Speaker 5:  underestimated your willing to, your willingness to pick this fight after

1506
01:27:50,945 --> 01:27:53,165
Speaker 5:  so many years of picking this fight. You're like, I've been through your

1507
01:27:53,485 --> 01:27:54,445
Speaker 5:  nonsense before Apple.

1508
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:57,645
Speaker 16:  Oh, I I, yeah, I know they were caught off guard. They, they told us that

1509
01:27:57,795 --> 01:28:00,845
Speaker 16:  they, like when we, when we ended up going to the lab and everything, they

1510
01:28:00,845 --> 01:28:04,765
Speaker 16:  just said straight up, oh we did not expect anyone to be

1511
01:28:04,765 --> 01:28:08,445
Speaker 16:  this prepared, especially as a two person team. They just did not expect

1512
01:28:08,445 --> 01:28:10,205
Speaker 16:  us to be as prepared as we were. Which I think

1513
01:28:10,205 --> 01:28:10,805
Speaker 5:  That had to feel good.

1514
01:28:11,065 --> 01:28:14,485
Speaker 16:  It, oh, it did feel good. I was like, cool. But at the same time I was like,

1515
01:28:14,835 --> 01:28:17,965
Speaker 16:  well then let us launch. It was like, cool. Okay, that's amazing. Let us

1516
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:19,565
Speaker 16:  launch, we're ready. Was

1517
01:28:19,565 --> 01:28:23,485
Speaker 5:  There any question for a team of two whether to invest all this

1518
01:28:23,485 --> 01:28:27,285
Speaker 5:  time on something that at least for now and potentially forever, is only

1519
01:28:27,285 --> 01:28:30,445
Speaker 5:  going to exist in the eu? Like there's a lot of people in the eu, but there's

1520
01:28:30,445 --> 01:28:32,445
Speaker 5:  a lot of people not in the EU also.

1521
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:36,245
Speaker 16:  Yeah, I mean, so two parts I like One, I do think this is gonna come outside

1522
01:28:36,245 --> 01:28:39,565
Speaker 16:  the EU at some point. I think it's a just question of time. So

1523
01:28:40,365 --> 01:28:43,325
Speaker 16:  I, yeah, I expected to see within a few years it'll expand out to like,

1524
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:46,845
Speaker 16:  I don't know, Japan, United States eventually. So, so we viewed this as

1525
01:28:46,845 --> 01:28:50,685
Speaker 16:  like the beginning of a much longer process was to

1526
01:28:50,685 --> 01:28:54,445
Speaker 16:  expand, but then the other thing was like, we had nothing to lose. This

1527
01:28:54,445 --> 01:28:58,045
Speaker 16:  is literally all we're doing. All our income is working on alt store of

1528
01:28:58,045 --> 01:29:01,525
Speaker 16:  Delta. We're like, well we might as well just go all the way with it. Like

1529
01:29:01,525 --> 01:29:02,605
Speaker 16:  what else? Like why not?

1530
01:29:02,995 --> 01:29:06,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean I think the long bet I think is probably a safe one.

1531
01:29:06,845 --> 01:29:09,885
Speaker 5:  Again, it's a question of how long it takes. Yeah. But it, I do think you're

1532
01:29:10,005 --> 01:29:13,845
Speaker 5:  probably right. It also seems like you were in a position where even

1533
01:29:13,945 --> 01:29:17,485
Speaker 5:  if it didn't sort of immediately reach a ton of people, you were gonna get

1534
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:20,885
Speaker 5:  so much notice just because this is such a big thing and such a big change

1535
01:29:20,885 --> 01:29:24,365
Speaker 5:  that like I all of a sudden alt sort just appeared in so many

1536
01:29:24,645 --> 01:29:27,325
Speaker 5:  headlines in like February and March of this year, which is like,

1537
01:29:27,425 --> 01:29:31,125
Speaker 16:  Yes. That was very, very surreal seeing that all of a sudden. Yeah.

1538
01:29:31,395 --> 01:29:34,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean it's so funny 'cause like explaining alt sort to people, it's

1539
01:29:34,205 --> 01:29:37,805
Speaker 5:  like, okay, it is this bizarre sort of convoluted

1540
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:40,925
Speaker 5:  experience where you have to set up a server and I'm seeing this in like

1541
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:42,965
Speaker 5:  mainstream news articles. I know.

1542
01:29:42,985 --> 01:29:43,805
Speaker 16:  I'm like, oh my God.

1543
01:29:44,235 --> 01:29:46,765
Speaker 5:  It's like, oh my God, if my mom asked me what alt story is, I'm not gonna

1544
01:29:46,765 --> 01:29:48,165
Speaker 5:  know how to answer that question for her.

1545
01:29:49,195 --> 01:29:52,325
Speaker 16:  Same, I, yeah, I explained to my friends, I'm like, eh, don't worry. It's

1546
01:29:52,325 --> 01:29:54,645
Speaker 16:  just a tool to install apps. That's it.

1547
01:29:55,385 --> 01:29:59,245
Speaker 5:  So, okay, so then we're almost to the present time, but I feel like we still

1548
01:29:59,245 --> 01:30:02,125
Speaker 5:  have not gotten to the single wildest part of this whole timeline. Oh

1549
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,365
Speaker 16:  Yeah, that's been accurate.

1550
01:30:04,185 --> 01:30:07,125
Speaker 5:  So you're, you're building the store, things are going well, you launch,

1551
01:30:07,605 --> 01:30:10,325
Speaker 5:  I think on launch day, right? March 7th, was it ready to go?

1552
01:30:10,785 --> 01:30:14,685
Speaker 16:  No, we, we were ready. We were all

1553
01:30:14,685 --> 01:30:18,325
Speaker 16:  ready to go and that was the beginning of like this frustration. So

1554
01:30:18,665 --> 01:30:22,605
Speaker 16:  we were, yeah, we were invited to a lab in Cork for the Apple

1555
01:30:22,665 --> 01:30:25,685
Speaker 16:  to like help us implement our backend and everything. So like a week long

1556
01:30:25,785 --> 01:30:28,485
Speaker 16:  lab for us just to work with Apple Engineers to get everything working.

1557
01:30:28,905 --> 01:30:32,725
Speaker 16:  So then we flew out to Cork, it was like the week before March 5th. So the

1558
01:30:32,725 --> 01:30:36,565
Speaker 16:  end of it, the end of February, we flew out day one, I showed up, I

1559
01:30:36,565 --> 01:30:40,525
Speaker 16:  said, okay, here's everything. We're ready to go. Can we launch? And

1560
01:30:40,525 --> 01:30:43,685
Speaker 16:  then they were like, oh hold on.

1561
01:30:43,755 --> 01:30:46,485
Speaker 5:  They expected you to show up and be like, I'd like to build an app store.

1562
01:30:46,485 --> 01:30:48,525
Speaker 5:  And instead you show up and you're like, I have built an app store. They

1563
01:30:48,525 --> 01:30:50,965
Speaker 16:  Literally, I really think they expected everyone to show up with like no

1564
01:30:50,995 --> 01:30:54,005
Speaker 16:  code base, like to just start from scratch on how to do this. And yeah,

1565
01:30:54,005 --> 01:30:57,565
Speaker 16:  so we show up and we're like, here's the entire product. It has store pages,

1566
01:30:57,565 --> 01:31:00,805
Speaker 16:  everything you could possibly need downloading works. And then they were

1567
01:31:00,805 --> 01:31:04,205
Speaker 16:  just like, oh wow. Yeah, just very clearly. Yeah, they were not expecting

1568
01:31:04,205 --> 01:31:07,445
Speaker 16:  that. And so it basically was then, okay, so Monday I was like trying to

1569
01:31:07,605 --> 01:31:10,765
Speaker 16:  pressure them, can we launch tomorrow? Can we launch tomorrow? I watch 17.4

1570
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:14,165
Speaker 16:  is coming out tomorrow, can we be there? And then it just

1571
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:18,325
Speaker 16:  became clear that this whole process was gonna be much longer than

1572
01:31:18,325 --> 01:31:22,205
Speaker 16:  we expected for a lot of boring reasons. Like basically just

1573
01:31:22,205 --> 01:31:25,685
Speaker 16:  legal, like giving them documents, having them review documents,

1574
01:31:26,135 --> 01:31:29,965
Speaker 16:  stuff like that. So I 74 came out and

1575
01:31:30,065 --> 01:31:33,805
Speaker 16:  me and Shane were very bummed because we were like, we were ready to

1576
01:31:33,805 --> 01:31:37,725
Speaker 16:  launch on launch day. We were all ready to go and then, ugh. So

1577
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:38,405
Speaker 16:  that was frustrating.

1578
01:31:38,745 --> 01:31:42,085
Speaker 5:  So how long did it take before you actually got the thing up and running

1579
01:31:42,435 --> 01:31:45,845
Speaker 16:  Then? I think it was two months later. Like it was, yeah, it was

1580
01:31:45,845 --> 01:31:49,485
Speaker 16:  April 17th. Like yeah, so yeah, from May, from

1581
01:31:49,485 --> 01:31:53,405
Speaker 16:  March 5th to April 17th was just waiting. It's a month and a half.

1582
01:31:53,865 --> 01:31:57,485
Speaker 16:  And so we did that. And then, yeah, the reception was immediately just

1583
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:01,765
Speaker 16:  phenomenal. People just so excited and, but then we also immediately saw,

1584
01:32:02,055 --> 01:32:05,845
Speaker 16:  which we expected that Delta was the main story. Sure that Delta

1585
01:32:05,865 --> 01:32:09,125
Speaker 16:  in the app store was the big deal. But we had to figure out what to do and

1586
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:11,765
Speaker 16:  we knew that would be the outcome if we released Delta in the app store,

1587
01:32:11,795 --> 01:32:15,125
Speaker 16:  that Delta would get like its big moments to be everywhere. And we just

1588
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:17,725
Speaker 16:  were like, you know what, that's fine. It's free marketing for alt store

1589
01:32:17,725 --> 01:32:20,245
Speaker 16:  if everyone just knows about Delta and then they talk about it and then

1590
01:32:20,245 --> 01:32:22,285
Speaker 16:  they get it through alt store in the eu. So you

1591
01:32:22,285 --> 01:32:25,965
Speaker 5:  Just, you just glossed past part of it though. Like the, the whole Apple

1592
01:32:26,205 --> 01:32:30,085
Speaker 5:  suddenly allows emulators in the app store. Yeah. You say

1593
01:32:30,085 --> 01:32:32,925
Speaker 5:  that as If you expected that to happen. I don't think anybody expected that

1594
01:32:32,925 --> 01:32:33,565
Speaker 5:  to happen. Not

1595
01:32:33,565 --> 01:32:37,485
Speaker 16:  At all it the most, yeah. Unexpected thing that could have happened. And

1596
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:41,805
Speaker 16:  me and Shane had different reactions at first. Shane was more like,

1597
01:32:42,195 --> 01:32:46,125
Speaker 16:  what, this changes everything now we gotta think through. And my just reaction

1598
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:50,165
Speaker 16:  was, wow, what validation that Apple had to

1599
01:32:50,165 --> 01:32:53,805
Speaker 16:  change the rules to allow emulators because they were threatened by us about

1600
01:32:53,805 --> 01:32:57,565
Speaker 16:  to launch with an EM letter. Like that to me was like invigorating. I was

1601
01:32:57,565 --> 01:33:00,765
Speaker 16:  like, this is, yes, it means we're doing something right. That Apple is

1602
01:33:00,765 --> 01:33:03,725
Speaker 16:  literally like doing something I never thought they'd do because it was

1603
01:33:03,725 --> 01:33:07,525
Speaker 16:  the only way they could try to make the story. Not the EU

1604
01:33:07,545 --> 01:33:10,525
Speaker 16:  now has the best apps outside the EU has, doesn't have the coolest apps.

1605
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,685
Speaker 16:  And I just knew Apple like yeah, they just couldn't have that story. Which

1606
01:33:13,685 --> 01:33:17,365
Speaker 16:  is also why emulators are allowed worldwide is my guess is the story just

1607
01:33:17,365 --> 01:33:20,005
Speaker 16:  could not have been, the EU has better apps than the rest of the world.

1608
01:33:20,435 --> 01:33:24,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no I, I think that's exactly right. And it is very hard to argue that

1609
01:33:24,245 --> 01:33:27,965
Speaker 5:  this wasn't specifically about Delta. Like I just can't, the timing,

1610
01:33:28,595 --> 01:33:29,125
Speaker 5:  it's too,

1611
01:33:29,505 --> 01:33:33,365
Speaker 16:  It is all about Delta it because we haven't had a direct

1612
01:33:33,365 --> 01:33:36,845
Speaker 16:  confirmation Apple, but our app Delta was being notarized for like five

1613
01:33:36,845 --> 01:33:40,645
Speaker 16:  weeks. They changed this rule, it's approved the next day. Oh wow.

1614
01:33:40,645 --> 01:33:43,965
Speaker 16:  Like, oh wow. It's almost like they were holding it to figure out what they

1615
01:33:43,965 --> 01:33:44,645
Speaker 16:  could do about it.

1616
01:33:45,225 --> 01:33:47,605
Speaker 5:  Did you get any heads up that they were gonna make this change? Nope.

1617
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:48,725
Speaker 16:  Nothing at all.

1618
01:33:49,715 --> 01:33:53,485
Speaker 5:  Well, and I would guess after that happened you would've

1619
01:33:53,685 --> 01:33:57,005
Speaker 5:  expected it to be big. It sounds like you did expect it to be big, but I

1620
01:33:57,005 --> 01:34:00,045
Speaker 5:  feel like it's been, it's certainly been bigger than I expected. Like

1621
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:01,805
Speaker 16:  It is bigger than I expected. I

1622
01:34:01,805 --> 01:34:03,085
Speaker 5:  Can, it's been nuts man.

1623
01:34:03,475 --> 01:34:07,285
Speaker 16:  It's so validating. Like I really can't like, because yeah, we're doing

1624
01:34:07,285 --> 01:34:11,125
Speaker 16:  this because we just really believe that people just wanna play

1625
01:34:11,185 --> 01:34:15,125
Speaker 16:  old Nintendo games or old, old games. We just, I think it's just a

1626
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:18,805
Speaker 16:  thing people wanna do and for so long everyone just says no, that's only

1627
01:34:18,825 --> 01:34:21,285
Speaker 16:  for the nerds. It's only for like the people who know what they're doing.

1628
01:34:21,385 --> 01:34:25,205
Speaker 16:  And I've just been like, you just have to make it accessible. That's all

1629
01:34:25,225 --> 01:34:29,205
Speaker 16:  it, like all you gotta do, if it's accessible, people will know how to

1630
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:31,805
Speaker 16:  do it and they will love it. We we're seeing that that is exactly the case.

1631
01:34:31,825 --> 01:34:35,445
Speaker 16:  And yes. So even more people than I thought are enjoying it. It is the most

1632
01:34:35,445 --> 01:34:39,405
Speaker 16:  surreal thing, seeing it not only in the app store but being the top

1633
01:34:39,665 --> 01:34:41,245
Speaker 16:  app in the app store for

1634
01:34:41,245 --> 01:34:43,845
Speaker 5:  Like a long time. Are you still the number one app in the app store?

1635
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:46,845
Speaker 16:  I mean, I think last time I checked, but yeah, since we've launched we've

1636
01:34:46,845 --> 01:34:50,125
Speaker 16:  been number one and yeah, so surreal. Like

1637
01:34:50,705 --> 01:34:54,325
Speaker 16:  the most, like anytime in my life I've never felt more like

1638
01:34:54,765 --> 01:34:57,805
Speaker 16:  I actually am dreaming right now. Like I need like pinching myself like,

1639
01:34:58,405 --> 01:35:02,245
Speaker 16:  'cause it was just too perfect. Like work on this app for 10 years and

1640
01:35:02,245 --> 01:35:05,925
Speaker 16:  then day one in the app store, it's the top. It was just incredible.

1641
01:35:06,385 --> 01:35:10,205
Speaker 5:  Has it changed what you think about how to do all of this? I mean, If you

1642
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:14,165
Speaker 5:  had charged 2 99 for Delta, you would've made a crap ton of money by now.

1643
01:35:14,165 --> 01:35:17,805
Speaker 5:  Like have you, are, are you thinking about the business of all of this differently

1644
01:35:17,855 --> 01:35:19,525
Speaker 5:  after it's blown up the way that it has?

1645
01:35:20,565 --> 01:35:24,285
Speaker 16:  I think we want this to be bigger than just like Delta.

1646
01:35:25,065 --> 01:35:28,965
Speaker 16:  And we want this to cause like actual change in

1647
01:35:28,965 --> 01:35:32,925
Speaker 16:  like the emulation scene or in the gaming sphere. Just like we want to make

1648
01:35:32,925 --> 01:35:36,045
Speaker 16:  this more accessible for everyone and we want people to start talking about

1649
01:35:36,045 --> 01:35:38,965
Speaker 16:  it and to have real conversations about it without just being like, piracy,

1650
01:35:39,065 --> 01:35:42,605
Speaker 16:  piracy. And so a lot of what we're doing is we thought Delta

1651
01:35:43,065 --> 01:35:46,405
Speaker 16:  to make that change happen, we had to like, it had to be free, had to be,

1652
01:35:46,605 --> 01:35:48,885
Speaker 16:  everyone had to have it. And that's, I think just what we're focused on

1653
01:35:48,885 --> 01:35:51,445
Speaker 16:  really is like as long as we're, we're making, we're making enough to support

1654
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:55,245
Speaker 16:  ourselves and so we're not in need of more money. But I just think for

1655
01:35:55,245 --> 01:35:59,205
Speaker 16:  Delta to have the biggest impact is just make it as fully free and

1656
01:35:59,205 --> 01:36:02,725
Speaker 16:  accessible to as many people as possible and let them just start reliving

1657
01:36:02,725 --> 01:36:02,925
Speaker 16:  games.

1658
01:36:03,465 --> 01:36:07,205
Speaker 5:  Are you worried at all about legal ramifications? I mean there was

1659
01:36:07,205 --> 01:36:10,765
Speaker 5:  obviously the, the yuzu thing that happened kind of right before this. It's

1660
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:14,605
Speaker 5:  been a, it's been a weird moment in the emulation community. Have has, have

1661
01:36:14,605 --> 01:36:16,045
Speaker 5:  you heard from any Nintendo lawyers?

1662
01:36:16,595 --> 01:36:19,245
Speaker 16:  Yeah. That came out as we're also like in Europe trying to launch this.

1663
01:36:19,265 --> 01:36:23,205
Speaker 16:  I'm like, oh, interesting. Very, very relevant to us. But

1664
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:27,405
Speaker 16:  I'm not gonna say I'm not nervous about things,

1665
01:36:27,545 --> 01:36:31,485
Speaker 16:  but I am confident in what we're doing. I've learned a lot of

1666
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:35,445
Speaker 16:  what not to do over the past 10 years. And I think that we are

1667
01:36:35,445 --> 01:36:38,445
Speaker 16:  really trying to show how you can do something like this legal. Like we're

1668
01:36:38,445 --> 01:36:41,565
Speaker 16:  not yuzu, we're not emulating a current generation console.

1669
01:36:42,175 --> 01:36:44,765
Speaker 16:  We're not doing a lot of things that other emulators get in trouble. Like

1670
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:47,805
Speaker 16:  we're, there's no DRM we have to deal with to like for the the game. So

1671
01:36:47,965 --> 01:36:51,445
Speaker 16:  just the game files ripped from cartridges so we don't have to do anything

1672
01:36:51,475 --> 01:36:55,325
Speaker 16:  like, like that. We're doing everything we can to do it right. And there

1673
01:36:55,325 --> 01:36:57,445
Speaker 16:  was no world that I wouldn't have done this. I guess that's a better way.

1674
01:36:57,445 --> 01:37:00,925
Speaker 16:  Like I wouldn't have got this far and not released Delta. I just had to

1675
01:37:00,925 --> 01:37:01,205
Speaker 16:  Yeah,

1676
01:37:01,265 --> 01:37:04,045
Speaker 5:  No, I, I think that Well and I think that's part of why this moment of your

1677
01:37:04,055 --> 01:37:07,685
Speaker 5:  story is so interesting because we're at the beginning of

1678
01:37:08,355 --> 01:37:12,325
Speaker 5:  this weird new era of apps in the app store and

1679
01:37:12,325 --> 01:37:15,045
Speaker 5:  I think a lot of stuff is changing and a lot is gonna continue to change.

1680
01:37:15,305 --> 01:37:19,285
Speaker 5:  But we're also, in a funny way kind of at the end of your 10 year

1681
01:37:19,285 --> 01:37:22,325
Speaker 5:  journey, like the this you, you finally finished the thing

1682
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:26,685
Speaker 16:  That that is what it feels like. It's really weird, but I'm like, wow,

1683
01:37:27,265 --> 01:37:31,125
Speaker 16:  it actually happened like it got in the app store and yes,

1684
01:37:31,225 --> 01:37:34,925
Speaker 16:  it does feel like the culmination of that whole journey, which is very

1685
01:37:34,925 --> 01:37:35,645
Speaker 16:  weird. Yeah.

1686
01:37:35,915 --> 01:37:39,765
Speaker 5:  Does that make it feel like I finally got to do it and it worked

1687
01:37:39,765 --> 01:37:42,525
Speaker 5:  and it was huge and it was awesome and now I can go do something else?

1688
01:37:43,165 --> 01:37:46,445
Speaker 16:  I honestly, the, the fact that Delta's doing so well has just motivated

1689
01:37:46,445 --> 01:37:49,925
Speaker 16:  me to just wanna work on it so much for right now because I've just been

1690
01:37:49,925 --> 01:37:53,725
Speaker 16:  working on it in isolation. Assuming one day it could like be a big

1691
01:37:53,725 --> 01:37:57,365
Speaker 16:  deal That I don't know, actually seeing everyone playing it right now has

1692
01:37:57,555 --> 01:38:01,445
Speaker 16:  made me really motivated to like really focus on it again. And also

1693
01:38:01,445 --> 01:38:04,285
Speaker 16:  because so much of the past two years has been like a lot priority working

1694
01:38:04,285 --> 01:38:07,885
Speaker 16:  on alt store and now that we launched Alt store, we can just like have some

1695
01:38:07,885 --> 01:38:10,325
Speaker 16:  fun with Delta again. Like there's just so many fun features I want to add.

1696
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:12,685
Speaker 16:  But I haven't had time to, 'cause we had to get alt store up and running

1697
01:38:12,945 --> 01:38:16,565
Speaker 16:  for this deadline. But, so I'm looking forward to a lot of that. But I don't

1698
01:38:16,565 --> 01:38:19,485
Speaker 16:  know if this is a 10 year thing. I don't know if this is the beginning of

1699
01:38:19,485 --> 01:38:23,245
Speaker 16:  like another 10 year adventure To me, I think it's, I'll work on Delta for

1700
01:38:23,245 --> 01:38:26,485
Speaker 16:  a bit and I think I gotta finish up what alt store is like. We still have

1701
01:38:26,595 --> 01:38:30,525
Speaker 16:  some to do to prove it out. Like we gotta get the third party apps on there.

1702
01:38:30,525 --> 01:38:34,405
Speaker 16:  We gotta build up the platform. And I think that's, to me the next

1703
01:38:34,715 --> 01:38:38,125
Speaker 16:  step is just making sure that alt store is a real app store that people

1704
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,165
Speaker 16:  are using and happy with. And then maybe I'll be done

1705
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:45,245
Speaker 5:  And then, then you will have resoundingly defeated Apple, which very few

1706
01:38:45,245 --> 01:38:45,885
Speaker 5:  people can say.

1707
01:38:46,165 --> 01:38:46,965
Speaker 16:  That's lot. Yeah.

1708
01:38:54,235 --> 01:38:57,925
Speaker 5:  Welcome back. For the last few weeks I've been immersing myself in

1709
01:38:58,145 --> 01:39:02,125
Speaker 5:  AI gadgets, the humane AI pin, the rabbit R one, the Meta Smartt

1710
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:05,725
Speaker 5:  glasses, this voice recorder I have called plot, a bunch of

1711
01:39:05,835 --> 01:39:09,725
Speaker 5:  apps, everything I can get my hands on that is like a way to use

1712
01:39:09,985 --> 01:39:13,485
Speaker 5:  ai. And the number one question in front of all of these

1713
01:39:13,595 --> 01:39:17,405
Speaker 5:  devices in particular I think is the same thing. Why isn't this

1714
01:39:17,405 --> 01:39:20,845
Speaker 5:  just an app on your phone? Actually that might be the number two question.

1715
01:39:20,945 --> 01:39:24,565
Speaker 5:  Number one is just, is this thing any good? And a lot of them aren't, but

1716
01:39:24,565 --> 01:39:28,045
Speaker 5:  let's focus on the phone thing for right now. The verges, Allison Johnson

1717
01:39:28,135 --> 01:39:31,765
Speaker 5:  wrote a piece last week arguing essentially that a smartphone is the perfect

1718
01:39:32,145 --> 01:39:36,085
Speaker 5:  AI gadget that we don't need dedicated devices, we have the dedicated devices.

1719
01:39:36,665 --> 01:39:40,565
Speaker 5:  And she ran an experiment to prove it. So of course I had to ask her to come

1720
01:39:40,565 --> 01:39:43,125
Speaker 5:  on and tell us how it went. Allison, welcome back.

1721
01:39:43,295 --> 01:39:43,725
Speaker 17:  Thank you.

1722
01:39:44,265 --> 01:39:48,165
Speaker 5:  We usually talk about phones when you come on the show and this time

1723
01:39:48,165 --> 01:39:51,405
Speaker 5:  we're gonna talk about phones, but maybe in the weirdest way that we've ever

1724
01:39:51,405 --> 01:39:53,125
Speaker 5:  talked about phones, which I'm very excited about.

1725
01:39:53,585 --> 01:39:54,325
Speaker 17:  I'm here for it.

1726
01:39:55,065 --> 01:39:58,965
Speaker 5:  So let's just start at the beginning here. Tell me about this wearable

1727
01:39:58,965 --> 01:40:00,885
Speaker 5:  phone experiment that you devised for yourself.

1728
01:40:01,185 --> 01:40:05,125
Speaker 17:  Oh my gosh. I have never been so glad that I just work in my own house

1729
01:40:05,215 --> 01:40:09,125
Speaker 17:  alone. I was just sort of ranting about how, you know,

1730
01:40:09,145 --> 01:40:12,805
Speaker 17:  the humane pin reviews came out and I was like, this thing is just an

1731
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:16,725
Speaker 17:  Android phone, like a mid-range Android phone. And I was like, I have

1732
01:40:16,745 --> 01:40:20,645
Speaker 17:  so many mid-range Android phones. So I just kind of set out to like recreate

1733
01:40:20,745 --> 01:40:24,205
Speaker 17:  the capabilities with what I had. And

1734
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:28,605
Speaker 17:  it was surprisingly hard. I tried a flip phone, I had the Motorola Razor

1735
01:40:28,635 --> 01:40:32,165
Speaker 17:  Plus and I had it like kind of clamped over the collar of my shirt,

1736
01:40:32,425 --> 01:40:36,085
Speaker 17:  you know, like you do. And I got like so far with that

1737
01:40:36,195 --> 01:40:39,365
Speaker 17:  like I could kind of talk to Google assistant. So

1738
01:40:39,365 --> 01:40:43,245
Speaker 5:  Wait, so you, you dangle it over with like what The front screen facing out?

1739
01:40:43,435 --> 01:40:47,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you just, and then you just sort of like, hey gee it from

1740
01:40:47,515 --> 01:40:48,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah there.

1741
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:52,205
Speaker 17:  And I figure, 'cause then you have cameras facing forward. You could do

1742
01:40:52,205 --> 01:40:56,165
Speaker 17:  Google lens. That was the, the thought. It's not very easy

1743
01:40:56,225 --> 01:41:00,205
Speaker 17:  to do any of that kind of out of the box. Like the flip phones

1744
01:41:00,255 --> 01:41:04,205
Speaker 17:  won't let you download the Gemini assistant, which is strange. So you

1745
01:41:04,205 --> 01:41:07,965
Speaker 17:  kind of have to, that's weird. Like side load it, If you try and, and trigger

1746
01:41:07,985 --> 01:41:11,845
Speaker 17:  the Google assistant with the phone closed in the

1747
01:41:11,845 --> 01:41:15,005
Speaker 17:  cover, just using the cover screen, it tells you to open up the phone. So

1748
01:41:15,145 --> 01:41:18,245
Speaker 17:  it kind of like, I was already not off to a great start.

1749
01:41:19,225 --> 01:41:23,045
Speaker 5:  So did you ever find an actual solution

1750
01:41:23,275 --> 01:41:26,965
Speaker 5:  with the phone itself? We're gonna get to headphones in a minute. Yeah. Foreshadowing.

1751
01:41:27,345 --> 01:41:31,285
Speaker 5:  But did you ever find a version of like a wearable phone that actually kind

1752
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:31,565
Speaker 5:  of worked?

1753
01:41:32,165 --> 01:41:36,045
Speaker 17:  I did not really. Okay. I had, I just ran chat GPT

1754
01:41:36,545 --> 01:41:40,525
Speaker 17:  in the kind of like talking mode where the conversation mode

1755
01:41:41,185 --> 01:41:44,365
Speaker 17:  and I had that on my shirt and just, but it's just always listening and

1756
01:41:44,365 --> 01:41:47,485
Speaker 17:  like waiting for you to say something so you can't just like go about your

1757
01:41:47,485 --> 01:41:51,285
Speaker 17:  day. And we had a very pleasant conversation about like the

1758
01:41:51,285 --> 01:41:55,125
Speaker 17:  weather, whatever. But yeah, nothing, nothing really worked the

1759
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:55,925
Speaker 17:  way I thought it would.

1760
01:41:56,315 --> 01:42:00,125
Speaker 5:  Well this is why I wanted to talk about this because I think you and I have

1761
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:02,765
Speaker 5:  been talking about this for months now and the question everybody brings

1762
01:42:02,765 --> 01:42:06,725
Speaker 5:  up about every single AI gadget is like, why isn't this just an app

1763
01:42:06,865 --> 01:42:10,765
Speaker 5:  on my phone? And my thoughts on the subject and

1764
01:42:11,065 --> 01:42:14,205
Speaker 5:  why it shouldn't just be an app on your phone are actually becoming increasingly

1765
01:42:14,505 --> 01:42:18,445
Speaker 5:  strong and intense. And I feel like I'm more right than I was before. But

1766
01:42:18,445 --> 01:42:21,965
Speaker 5:  I am curious, like at a, at a broad level, do you buy that

1767
01:42:22,365 --> 01:42:24,845
Speaker 5:  argument? Like are you also one of the people who is just like, this is all

1768
01:42:24,845 --> 01:42:27,365
Speaker 5:  ridiculous, this should just be an app on my phone.

1769
01:42:27,805 --> 01:42:31,725
Speaker 17:  I think I'm, I'm like 20% rooting for like a

1770
01:42:31,785 --> 01:42:35,725
Speaker 17:  gadget that does these things and 80% just, it just feels like

1771
01:42:35,795 --> 01:42:39,445
Speaker 17:  realism. Like phones have already solved

1772
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:43,485
Speaker 17:  so many of these problems. Like these little gadgets get

1773
01:42:43,905 --> 01:42:47,885
Speaker 17:  hot, they have to connect to the internet, they

1774
01:42:48,435 --> 01:42:52,125
Speaker 17:  need cameras like check mark on all of those

1775
01:42:52,225 --> 01:42:55,805
Speaker 17:  for phones, right? Like they did it battery life, you know,

1776
01:42:56,075 --> 01:42:59,405
Speaker 17:  regular software updates. They got it. And I'm just like, I'm having

1777
01:42:59,575 --> 01:43:03,165
Speaker 17:  flashbacks of covering compact digital cameras

1778
01:43:03,625 --> 01:43:07,605
Speaker 17:  for years where it was like, you know, oh these are

1779
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:11,325
Speaker 17:  so much better than your phone. And which is like not even true

1780
01:43:11,325 --> 01:43:15,285
Speaker 17:  anymore. But it was like, no, the phone is good enough for most

1781
01:43:15,285 --> 01:43:19,045
Speaker 17:  people and people do not wanna carry around two things. That is,

1782
01:43:19,275 --> 01:43:22,765
Speaker 17:  that is what we learned from that experiment is If you can carry

1783
01:43:23,185 --> 01:43:25,805
Speaker 17:  one thing instead of two things, you will carry one thing.

1784
01:43:26,405 --> 01:43:29,325
Speaker 5:  I do agree with that. And that that is a, I think maybe the most

1785
01:43:29,895 --> 01:43:33,485
Speaker 5:  convincing argument against the AI gadget is just,

1786
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:37,165
Speaker 5:  it's, it's the good enough hypothesis, right? That it's like I don't need

1787
01:43:37,165 --> 01:43:40,965
Speaker 5:  it to be as good. I just don't wanna carry and charge and worry about

1788
01:43:40,985 --> 01:43:44,925
Speaker 5:  two things. But I think my most strident opinion on this subject

1789
01:43:45,105 --> 01:43:48,965
Speaker 5:  is that I think we all have forgotten how annoying it is to

1790
01:43:48,965 --> 01:43:52,845
Speaker 5:  use your phone. Hmm. Like we've just been doing it for so long that

1791
01:43:52,885 --> 01:43:56,485
Speaker 5:  I think it's why I believe in flip phones for the same reason. It's like

1792
01:43:56,485 --> 01:44:00,285
Speaker 5:  our phones are these big chunky things that you balance on

1793
01:44:00,285 --> 01:44:03,845
Speaker 5:  top of your pinky to the point where most of us have like divots in our fingers

1794
01:44:03,845 --> 01:44:07,485
Speaker 5:  now. Now from trying to hold these things, you have to sort of like worm

1795
01:44:07,555 --> 01:44:11,445
Speaker 5:  your thumb around this gigantic screen in order to touch anything.

1796
01:44:11,555 --> 01:44:15,205
Speaker 5:  Like from a pure, in a vacuum user experience,

1797
01:44:15,355 --> 01:44:19,125
Speaker 5:  it's not good. And if your hands are full, you can't do anything. And

1798
01:44:19,685 --> 01:44:23,285
Speaker 5:  I spend like an alarming amount of my time with like dog and

1799
01:44:23,285 --> 01:44:26,605
Speaker 5:  stroller in one arm and phone in the other. Like it's just bad.

1800
01:44:27,165 --> 01:44:31,005
Speaker 5:  And I this idea that, okay, every time I wanna do anything, the right user

1801
01:44:31,005 --> 01:44:34,525
Speaker 5:  experience is for me to dig into my purse, pull out my phone,

1802
01:44:35,065 --> 01:44:38,725
Speaker 5:  unlock it, swipe, swipe pipe, open an app, tap on the app,

1803
01:44:38,945 --> 01:44:42,605
Speaker 5:  log in, do a thing. Like that's bad. And the idea that you can

1804
01:44:42,845 --> 01:44:46,805
Speaker 5:  shortcut all of this by just yelling a thing is good. I believe in

1805
01:44:46,805 --> 01:44:49,445
Speaker 5:  that. Yeah. And this is why I like your experiment so much because it's like,

1806
01:44:49,445 --> 01:44:53,365
Speaker 5:  okay, can I make my phone that thing? Which I think is where we get to

1807
01:44:53,435 --> 01:44:56,845
Speaker 5:  earbuds. Yeah. The longer we do this, the more I'm coming to the answer of

1808
01:44:56,845 --> 01:44:59,965
Speaker 5:  like, maybe headphones are the problem solver in all of this.

1809
01:45:00,355 --> 01:45:04,325
Speaker 17:  Yeah. And this is something I, our colleague V song has

1810
01:45:04,325 --> 01:45:08,085
Speaker 17:  written about is like with wearable tech, it's

1811
01:45:08,145 --> 01:45:12,125
Speaker 17:  so important that it's just like something you want to put

1812
01:45:12,145 --> 01:45:15,765
Speaker 17:  on your body and is comfortable and is kind of like socially accepted.

1813
01:45:16,505 --> 01:45:20,365
Speaker 17:  And I just come back to earbuds. Like we're just, people just walk

1814
01:45:20,365 --> 01:45:24,245
Speaker 17:  around with them. I feel like such an old person being like these kids,

1815
01:45:24,395 --> 01:45:28,045
Speaker 17:  they just walk around with their earbuds all the time. But like you have

1816
01:45:28,085 --> 01:45:31,965
Speaker 17:  a good transparency mode, you know? And those things could get smarter

1817
01:45:32,135 --> 01:45:35,605
Speaker 17:  about the sound they let in and the sounds they keep out.

1818
01:45:35,985 --> 01:45:39,725
Speaker 17:  And then you have this connection to your phone that you can just like summon

1819
01:45:39,725 --> 01:45:43,645
Speaker 17:  it when you want it and keep it in your pocket and not have to do the whole

1820
01:45:43,735 --> 01:45:47,725
Speaker 17:  dance of like tapping on things. 'cause I think we've come, we're sort

1821
01:45:47,725 --> 01:45:51,645
Speaker 17:  of blind to that. Like we are just so conditioned to like, this is how you

1822
01:45:51,645 --> 01:45:55,045
Speaker 17:  get things done on a phone. You take it out, you do all this, you get distracted.

1823
01:45:55,105 --> 01:45:58,285
Speaker 17:  And yeah. Once you start kind of like conceptualizing

1824
01:45:58,945 --> 01:46:02,925
Speaker 17:  not having to do that, it's like, oh yeah, I, I buy

1825
01:46:02,925 --> 01:46:06,885
Speaker 17:  into that vision and I, but I think we're just gonna be able

1826
01:46:06,885 --> 01:46:09,565
Speaker 17:  to do it without touching our phone. Right. But it's still gonna be phone.

1827
01:46:10,305 --> 01:46:12,885
Speaker 5:  Yes. And well, and that turned out to be sort of the second half of your

1828
01:46:12,885 --> 01:46:16,805
Speaker 5:  experience with, with this phone AI gadget thing, right?

1829
01:46:16,805 --> 01:46:19,325
Speaker 5:  You you basically went like full pixel.

1830
01:46:19,715 --> 01:46:23,645
Speaker 17:  Yeah, I did. Like I downloaded the Gemini assistant

1831
01:46:23,645 --> 01:46:26,925
Speaker 17:  and switched into it and there's still like weird workarounds you have to

1832
01:46:26,925 --> 01:46:30,845
Speaker 17:  do because you can have Gemini assistant running on the phone. The

1833
01:46:30,995 --> 01:46:34,765
Speaker 17:  earbuds are not going to trigger Gemini 'cause they're,

1834
01:46:34,765 --> 01:46:35,885
Speaker 17:  they don't talk yet.

1835
01:46:36,195 --> 01:46:39,005
Speaker 5:  This is the most Google thing you've ever said. Yeah.

1836
01:46:39,195 --> 01:46:43,165
Speaker 17:  Seriously. Well like the pixel watch you, you can't have Gemini on it

1837
01:46:43,225 --> 01:46:46,405
Speaker 17:  yet. So you're like talking to one assistant here, you're talking to a different

1838
01:46:46,405 --> 01:46:49,685
Speaker 17:  assistant on the phone. The Google home in my kitchen is constantly being

1839
01:46:49,685 --> 01:46:53,125
Speaker 17:  like, what? So I had to like unplug that

1840
01:46:53,465 --> 01:46:57,245
Speaker 17:  and I kept Gemini like open and running on the phone, which is not

1841
01:46:57,265 --> 01:47:01,085
Speaker 17:  an ideal user experience, but had the earbuds in and my

1842
01:47:01,085 --> 01:47:04,685
Speaker 17:  like light bulb moment was, I took a picture of this recipe

1843
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:08,645
Speaker 17:  I was making and I was like, look at this and remember it.

1844
01:47:09,145 --> 01:47:12,645
Speaker 17:  And I just walked around my kitchen doing things and I would ask it questions

1845
01:47:12,675 --> 01:47:16,445
Speaker 17:  like, how long do I put the fish in? How do I chop the vegetables? Just

1846
01:47:16,445 --> 01:47:20,205
Speaker 17:  kind of out of order. And like as I was doing things and it,

1847
01:47:20,465 --> 01:47:24,085
Speaker 17:  it got it right all the time and it was like, oh this is super helpful.

1848
01:47:24,365 --> 01:47:27,685
Speaker 17:  I would be running back to this recipe with like

1849
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:32,165
Speaker 17:  stuff on my fingers trying to figure it out. And it's like, man, those

1850
01:47:32,275 --> 01:47:32,765
Speaker 17:  earbuds,

1851
01:47:33,235 --> 01:47:37,085
Speaker 5:  That is maybe the single coolest use of AI I've ever heard

1852
01:47:37,105 --> 01:47:40,725
Speaker 5:  by the way, to take a picture of a recipe and then just pepper

1853
01:47:41,025 --> 01:47:44,725
Speaker 5:  the assistant with questions Yeah. About that recipe as you go. That's very

1854
01:47:44,725 --> 01:47:44,925
Speaker 5:  cool.

1855
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:49,165
Speaker 17:  I was super into it and it's that kind of thing of like I run outta things

1856
01:47:49,165 --> 01:47:53,045
Speaker 17:  to talk about with chat JBT I'm like, there's only so many like business

1857
01:47:53,325 --> 01:47:57,205
Speaker 17:  proposals you can brainstorm. But I'm like, If you give it a little data

1858
01:47:57,345 --> 01:48:01,205
Speaker 17:  set of like I'm doing this thing, help me out. Like

1859
01:48:01,425 --> 01:48:03,525
Speaker 17:  it makes so much more sense to me that way.

1860
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:07,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Are you a voice assistant person in your day to day?

1861
01:48:07,865 --> 01:48:11,725
Speaker 17:  Not at all. I set timers and I asked the weather and like trying

1862
01:48:11,745 --> 01:48:15,645
Speaker 17:  to get myself, I'm starting to like realize I can use

1863
01:48:15,645 --> 01:48:19,165
Speaker 17:  it a little more. Especially if I am using a phone with

1864
01:48:19,345 --> 01:48:23,325
Speaker 17:  Gemini on it. Hmm. Like I ask but you just, man you gotta

1865
01:48:23,325 --> 01:48:27,285
Speaker 17:  keep an eye on it 'cause it'll make up a word. Or like I was asking

1866
01:48:27,305 --> 01:48:30,685
Speaker 17:  it if the bridge they were working on in my neighborhood had reopened

1867
01:48:31,305 --> 01:48:35,005
Speaker 17:  and, and it like got the days backwards. It was like, yes

1868
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:37,485
Speaker 17:  it's open but it's opening tomorrow so

1869
01:48:38,865 --> 01:48:42,845
Speaker 17:  you just have to keep an eye on it. But it's, it's like converting me a

1870
01:48:42,845 --> 01:48:45,205
Speaker 17:  little bit to more of a voice assistant person I think.

1871
01:48:45,715 --> 01:48:49,565
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah. I think one of the big questions I have about this space

1872
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:53,325
Speaker 5:  right now is did voice assistant work because they were a bad idea?

1873
01:48:53,865 --> 01:48:57,805
Speaker 5:  Or rather did voice assistant not work because they were a bad idea? Or did

1874
01:48:57,805 --> 01:49:01,285
Speaker 5:  they not work because they weren't very good? And I think they definitely

1875
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:05,165
Speaker 5:  aren't very good. Right. And I think that that Siri experience sort of

1876
01:49:05,165 --> 01:49:07,965
Speaker 5:  proves that for a lot of people. And I think a lot of people's first experience

1877
01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:11,005
Speaker 5:  with these things was Siri. And you ask it to do something and it just fails

1878
01:49:11,005 --> 01:49:12,685
Speaker 5:  or it's like, here's what I found on the web. And you're like, well this

1879
01:49:12,685 --> 01:49:16,165
Speaker 5:  is useless and then you never really try again. And so the first

1880
01:49:16,755 --> 01:49:20,205
Speaker 5:  attempt, we all had to build that habit, it failed

1881
01:49:20,315 --> 01:49:23,725
Speaker 5:  spectacularly. And there are a lot of like kids

1882
01:49:24,345 --> 01:49:28,005
Speaker 5:  who grew up asking Alexa silly questions and getting silly responses and

1883
01:49:28,005 --> 01:49:30,165
Speaker 5:  that was the thing that worked. So I think the attach rate there has actually

1884
01:49:30,165 --> 01:49:33,725
Speaker 5:  been better as a result. But then I come around to, okay,

1885
01:49:34,145 --> 01:49:37,885
Speaker 5:  we all bet on this a decade ago. Like the tech industry

1886
01:49:37,945 --> 01:49:41,365
Speaker 5:  was like, this is the thing, conversational interfaces, they're gonna change

1887
01:49:41,365 --> 01:49:45,165
Speaker 5:  everything and they super didn't. Yeah. And now to some extent we're back

1888
01:49:45,165 --> 01:49:49,005
Speaker 5:  in that exact same thing and the promise is no, it

1889
01:49:49,005 --> 01:49:52,525
Speaker 5:  was the right idea with the wrong underlying technology. And

1890
01:49:53,025 --> 01:49:56,845
Speaker 5:  at least my experience so far has been, I still see the theory

1891
01:49:56,905 --> 01:50:00,765
Speaker 5:  of it, but even as I use all these things, I'm not, I'm using

1892
01:50:00,765 --> 01:50:04,205
Speaker 5:  it more. Yeah. I, I agree with you. I've definitely found more reasons

1893
01:50:04,905 --> 01:50:08,445
Speaker 5:  to do this stuff. Particularly with like, I really like to use an

1894
01:50:08,705 --> 01:50:12,245
Speaker 5:  AI voice notes app to like say my to-do list out loud. And they're actually

1895
01:50:12,245 --> 01:50:15,685
Speaker 5:  getting pretty good at turning that into just a structured list of stuff

1896
01:50:15,725 --> 01:50:19,405
Speaker 5:  I have to do today. I feel like a doctor who's like saying all of my charts

1897
01:50:19,435 --> 01:50:22,285
Speaker 5:  into my voice recorder and then like something magical happens, it's great,

1898
01:50:22,825 --> 01:50:26,645
Speaker 5:  but I still don't feel like I have hit the thing where it just

1899
01:50:26,645 --> 01:50:30,605
Speaker 5:  sort of, that becomes the main way I use my phone and what people say

1900
01:50:30,605 --> 01:50:33,885
Speaker 5:  when I say that to them is, oh, it's just an interface question. It's because

1901
01:50:33,885 --> 01:50:36,125
Speaker 5:  once you have your phone out, why not just use your phone the way that you're

1902
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:38,485
Speaker 5:  used to? Which is why they're all excited about these new gadgets. And So

1903
01:50:38,525 --> 01:50:42,085
Speaker 5:  I just, I don't know, I spin in circles about like what is the actual sort

1904
01:50:42,085 --> 01:50:45,845
Speaker 5:  of roadblock here to this actually becoming real? 'cause it seems like there

1905
01:50:45,985 --> 01:50:46,885
Speaker 5:  are a lot of them.

1906
01:50:47,315 --> 01:50:51,165
Speaker 17:  Yeah. There's just sort of like a pain versus reward,

1907
01:50:51,545 --> 01:50:55,485
Speaker 17:  you know, ratio of like, it, I feel like it's starting to even

1908
01:50:55,545 --> 01:50:59,365
Speaker 17:  out a little bit with the voice assistants, but you still get burned where

1909
01:50:59,365 --> 01:51:02,365
Speaker 17:  you're like Yeah. And there's nothing worse than like being at the grocery

1910
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:05,965
Speaker 17:  store and being like, I'm gonna use the voice assistant. And then it's,

1911
01:51:06,025 --> 01:51:09,885
Speaker 17:  it just fails and you have to like either keep talking to it or

1912
01:51:09,885 --> 01:51:13,685
Speaker 17:  like take your phone out. I think once you had that experience you're like,

1913
01:51:13,685 --> 01:51:17,405
Speaker 17:  oh, just use my phone for this. Yeah. But yeah, I think, I think it's something

1914
01:51:17,505 --> 01:51:21,285
Speaker 17:  we can adjust to and it, it really has to like

1915
01:51:21,555 --> 01:51:25,405
Speaker 17:  that threshold of public embarrassment or just like

1916
01:51:25,765 --> 01:51:29,725
Speaker 17:  frustration has to change and there's like signals that

1917
01:51:29,725 --> 01:51:33,645
Speaker 17:  that will happen I think. But yeah, it's, it's not proven. I

1918
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:34,045
Speaker 17:  wouldn't say.

1919
01:51:34,395 --> 01:51:38,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. One of my developing theories is that

1920
01:51:38,245 --> 01:51:42,205
Speaker 5:  headphones are gonna be where a lot of this goes for that reason. It's

1921
01:51:42,205 --> 01:51:46,045
Speaker 5:  like, it's a thing you can wear one of in the grocery store and

1922
01:51:46,305 --> 01:51:50,085
Speaker 5:  no one will look twice at you. Like we have solved the public weirdness

1923
01:51:50,085 --> 01:51:53,685
Speaker 5:  problem of headphones. Sony did that for us 45 years ago. Yeah,

1924
01:51:54,005 --> 01:51:54,725
Speaker 5:  thank you Sony.

1925
01:51:56,265 --> 01:51:59,965
Speaker 5:  But what I wonder now is like, should you have the

1926
01:52:00,105 --> 01:52:03,205
Speaker 5:  AI system that is just purely baked into your headphones? Like one of, one

1927
01:52:03,205 --> 01:52:06,245
Speaker 5:  of the conspiracy theories that I have no evidence for but believe to my

1928
01:52:06,245 --> 01:52:10,125
Speaker 5:  soul is that the next AirPods maxes are going to be local

1929
01:52:10,385 --> 01:52:14,085
Speaker 5:  AI devices because they're big and they're heavy and they have a big battery

1930
01:52:14,145 --> 01:52:17,565
Speaker 5:  and they can do stuff. But like If you try to run some of that stuff on

1931
01:52:17,795 --> 01:52:21,725
Speaker 5:  AirPods or the Pixel buds or it's just the battery's gonna die

1932
01:52:21,725 --> 01:52:25,365
Speaker 5:  in one minute and there's just, there's literally no place to put the

1933
01:52:25,545 --> 01:52:29,485
Speaker 5:  AI stuff. Yeah. But maybe it's, maybe that's okay. Maybe Bluetooth

1934
01:52:29,485 --> 01:52:33,205
Speaker 5:  headphones and your phone in your pocket or purse is enough interface. And

1935
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:35,405
Speaker 5:  it does seem like in your experiment, that's kind of where you landed.

1936
01:52:35,755 --> 01:52:39,725
Speaker 17:  Yeah. That, that kind of proved out and that didn't solve the

1937
01:52:39,725 --> 01:52:43,485
Speaker 17:  camera thing, which is also like an intriguing related,

1938
01:52:44,105 --> 01:52:48,085
Speaker 17:  you know, like feature which the humane pin has the camera

1939
01:52:48,545 --> 01:52:52,365
Speaker 17:  and you we're both like, wanna look at something and ask a

1940
01:52:52,485 --> 01:52:55,565
Speaker 17:  question about it. Or If you want a hands-free way to take pictures, which

1941
01:52:55,565 --> 01:52:59,405
Speaker 17:  both are kind of intriguing to me. So I mean everybody keeps bringing up

1942
01:52:59,405 --> 01:53:03,365
Speaker 17:  the meta ray bands and man that kind of solves a

1943
01:53:03,565 --> 01:53:05,845
Speaker 17:  couple of his problems and doesn't look stupid.

1944
01:53:06,115 --> 01:53:07,565
Speaker 5:  True. Do you wear glasses normally?

1945
01:53:07,965 --> 01:53:11,925
Speaker 17:  I wear contacts. Okay. So I'm, I'm so close to buying

1946
01:53:11,935 --> 01:53:15,805
Speaker 17:  these things. I don't know really. Yeah. I, it would be so good for

1947
01:53:15,805 --> 01:53:19,685
Speaker 17:  just like taking pictures of a kid running around and I don't

1948
01:53:19,685 --> 01:53:22,685
Speaker 17:  know, but another gadget, do I want another gadget?

1949
01:53:23,365 --> 01:53:26,805
Speaker 5:  I dunno. I I hear you. I've been, I've been debating this with some of the

1950
01:53:26,805 --> 01:53:30,685
Speaker 5:  folks on our team for a while. 'cause I think they're definitely a huge

1951
01:53:30,715 --> 01:53:34,685
Speaker 5:  leap better than like having a headset on your face to have

1952
01:53:34,685 --> 01:53:38,005
Speaker 5:  the, the metas smartt glasses and meta is leaning into the fact that we've

1953
01:53:38,005 --> 01:53:41,965
Speaker 5:  also solved, having glasses on your face is not weird. And I don't know what

1954
01:53:41,965 --> 01:53:44,565
Speaker 5:  your experience has been, but when I wear the meta glasses, no one ever looks

1955
01:53:44,565 --> 01:53:47,845
Speaker 5:  at me sideways. Yeah. Like I got more public

1956
01:53:48,265 --> 01:53:51,965
Speaker 5:  notice, more sort of weird double takes wearing the humane

1957
01:53:52,065 --> 01:53:55,805
Speaker 5:  pin than I ever have wearing the meta glasses by a mile. Yeah. So that's,

1958
01:53:55,805 --> 01:53:59,685
Speaker 5:  that's a huge victory. But I also don't wear glasses normally and I

1959
01:53:59,685 --> 01:54:03,485
Speaker 5:  don't wanna start wearing glasses. Like I wear sunglasses when I'm

1960
01:54:03,555 --> 01:54:06,845
Speaker 5:  outside and I have mostly replaced my sunglasses with the meta glasses, which

1961
01:54:06,845 --> 01:54:10,525
Speaker 5:  I like a lot. But in terms of a sort of always on assistant, like I'm not

1962
01:54:10,525 --> 01:54:14,365
Speaker 5:  gonna get to work and keep wearing glasses I don't need just

1963
01:54:14,365 --> 01:54:15,565
Speaker 5:  to use my assistant.

1964
01:54:15,795 --> 01:54:18,605
Speaker 17:  It's a different vibe. Yeah. You have to be ready for that shift.

1965
01:54:19,005 --> 01:54:22,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like I are, if we can normalize sunglasses indoors just in

1966
01:54:22,885 --> 01:54:26,005
Speaker 5:  order to make AI happen Yeah. I'm here for it. This, this works.

1967
01:54:26,135 --> 01:54:27,245
Speaker 17:  We'll work on that. But

1968
01:54:27,245 --> 01:54:31,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I do think I have definitely come around to the idea in testing the

1969
01:54:31,045 --> 01:54:34,005
Speaker 5:  humane pin and now the rabbit and some of the other stuff that's out there

1970
01:54:34,005 --> 01:54:37,525
Speaker 5:  now that actually what we need to figure out how to put AI into other

1971
01:54:37,885 --> 01:54:41,485
Speaker 5:  socially acceptable things that already exist before we try and invent

1972
01:54:41,595 --> 01:54:43,805
Speaker 5:  some who new thing.

1973
01:54:44,075 --> 01:54:47,965
Speaker 17:  Yeah. Like the humane pin kind of tries to hide it, but

1974
01:54:47,965 --> 01:54:51,525
Speaker 17:  it's sort of like, look at this, this is kind of a cool gadget. I appreciate

1975
01:54:51,525 --> 01:54:55,485
Speaker 17:  that. The rabbit is just like, this is a thing. It is bright orange.

1976
01:54:56,105 --> 01:54:59,685
Speaker 17:  It like practically glows in the dark. I don't know If you had this

1977
01:54:59,685 --> 01:55:03,565
Speaker 17:  experience where I walk into a dark room and I'm like, there's the

1978
01:55:03,565 --> 01:55:04,045
Speaker 17:  rabbit art.

1979
01:55:05,585 --> 01:55:09,205
Speaker 5:  It really does it, it sort of screams at you from wherever it is. What do

1980
01:55:09,205 --> 01:55:11,325
Speaker 5:  you think about the rabbit, speaking of experiments you've been doing, you've

1981
01:55:11,325 --> 01:55:14,845
Speaker 5:  been, you've been testing rabbits, AI stuff with some of the other stuff

1982
01:55:14,845 --> 01:55:15,925
Speaker 5:  that's out there. How's that gone?

1983
01:55:16,505 --> 01:55:17,965
Speaker 17:  It is, boy,

1984
01:55:20,145 --> 01:55:24,085
Speaker 17:  that's a tough, that sounds right. It's a tough one. The, the battery

1985
01:55:24,155 --> 01:55:28,045
Speaker 17:  life is just god awful. Which, you know, as it turns out

1986
01:55:28,045 --> 01:55:31,885
Speaker 17:  is important. 'cause I don't, if I just have it in my bag and I go

1987
01:55:31,885 --> 01:55:35,845
Speaker 17:  somewhere, I'm like, I'm gonna leave it off because the minute I turn

1988
01:55:35,845 --> 01:55:39,485
Speaker 17:  it on it's gonna be like draining the battery. So like

1989
01:55:39,725 --> 01:55:42,885
Speaker 17:  a, if there's no battery, it doesn't help you do anything. It's just a cool

1990
01:55:43,070 --> 01:55:47,045
Speaker 17:  orange thing. I've seen a couple of moments when I'm

1991
01:55:47,045 --> 01:55:50,845
Speaker 17:  like, okay, this is maybe doing a little more than a Gemini. I

1992
01:55:50,845 --> 01:55:54,685
Speaker 17:  took a picture of my plant on my desk and it, it did the typical thing of

1993
01:55:54,685 --> 01:55:58,045
Speaker 17:  like, this is a pothos plant, blah, blah blah. And it, it kind of like

1994
01:55:58,515 --> 01:56:02,285
Speaker 17:  went into the care instructions and it was like, your plant looks happy

1995
01:56:02,345 --> 01:56:04,645
Speaker 17:  in its current pot. And I'm like, you know, great

1996
01:56:04,645 --> 01:56:04,805
Speaker 5:  Job.

1997
01:56:05,005 --> 01:56:08,765
Speaker 17:  I don't, I don't get that assessment from Gemini. It just sort of spits

1998
01:56:08,765 --> 01:56:12,245
Speaker 17:  out a bunch of stuff at you. Like, don't overwater it, don't underwater

1999
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:16,125
Speaker 17:  it. So I don't know, there's, there's like something that is a little

2000
01:56:16,155 --> 01:56:20,085
Speaker 17:  more like could tune itself to like what you're actually

2001
01:56:20,095 --> 01:56:23,965
Speaker 17:  doing or looking at that feels like not just Googling something,

2002
01:56:24,665 --> 01:56:28,525
Speaker 17:  but I don't wanna give this thing too much credit. It is not

2003
01:56:28,715 --> 01:56:32,405
Speaker 17:  done that very often and it, it kind of feels that basic

2004
01:56:32,495 --> 01:56:32,845
Speaker 17:  stuff.

2005
01:56:33,075 --> 01:56:36,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's bad. Like I think we're gonna have, we're gonna have more to say

2006
01:56:36,725 --> 01:56:40,405
Speaker 5:  about it both on the site and on this podcast, but the, the, the rabbit R

2007
01:56:40,405 --> 01:56:43,645
Speaker 5:  one is not good is is a pretty easy takeaway. But I'm curious, you've been

2008
01:56:43,645 --> 01:56:46,925
Speaker 5:  testing it against chat GPT in particular pretty

2009
01:56:47,355 --> 01:56:51,285
Speaker 5:  strenuously, right? Are they, my assumption would be that most of these things

2010
01:56:51,285 --> 01:56:54,885
Speaker 5:  should come out relatively the same because it's all kind of pulling from

2011
01:56:54,885 --> 01:56:58,325
Speaker 5:  the same backend infrastructure. Have you noticed anything interesting

2012
01:56:58,505 --> 01:56:59,405
Speaker 5:  poking at all this stuff?

2013
01:56:59,795 --> 01:57:03,405
Speaker 17:  Well, I think that something you mentioned I think is that it's running

2014
01:57:03,695 --> 01:57:07,445
Speaker 17:  perplexity so you get a little more like real

2015
01:57:07,475 --> 01:57:11,405
Speaker 17:  time info than a chat GBT that or the free

2016
01:57:11,405 --> 01:57:15,085
Speaker 17:  chat GBTI use that was trained whenever ago. Right.

2017
01:57:15,385 --> 01:57:19,245
Speaker 17:  So I can ask it like, is that bridge open that was closed

2018
01:57:19,245 --> 01:57:22,725
Speaker 17:  over the weekend and I get a real response. So

2019
01:57:23,265 --> 01:57:27,205
Speaker 17:  that's interesting. But it's, it's such a strange little

2020
01:57:28,315 --> 01:57:32,125
Speaker 17:  strange little creature. It's like very adorable. I think

2021
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:35,965
Speaker 17:  there's an adorable factor. It perks up its little

2022
01:57:35,965 --> 01:57:39,245
Speaker 17:  ears when it's listening to you. But TBD on that,

2023
01:57:39,605 --> 01:57:42,645
Speaker 5:  Does that do anything for you actually? 'cause I think I, I have, I've definitely

2024
01:57:42,645 --> 01:57:45,925
Speaker 5:  had the same experience that I like that it, the little rabbit on the screen

2025
01:57:45,925 --> 01:57:49,485
Speaker 5:  sort of bounces waiting for you to talk and then you ask it a question and

2026
01:57:49,485 --> 01:57:52,245
Speaker 5:  it perks up its ears and stops bouncing. And when you're playing music, it,

2027
01:57:52,265 --> 01:57:56,245
Speaker 5:  it wears headphones and there's a lot of sort of charming little things about

2028
01:57:56,245 --> 01:58:00,045
Speaker 5:  it I think. And I can't decide if that's what I want

2029
01:58:00,145 --> 01:58:03,685
Speaker 5:  or is totally the opposite of what I want from a device like this because

2030
01:58:03,685 --> 01:58:07,645
Speaker 5:  you, you use Gemini or chat GPT or Siri or whatever

2031
01:58:07,645 --> 01:58:11,445
Speaker 5:  and it's all very matter of fact, right? Like they are, they are

2032
01:58:11,495 --> 01:58:15,405
Speaker 5:  tools to do a job. And actually every time we've seen these things exhibit

2033
01:58:15,405 --> 01:58:19,125
Speaker 5:  personality, it's been in really bad ugly problematic ways mostly.

2034
01:58:19,665 --> 01:58:23,045
Speaker 5:  And so they've all learned to just sort of shut all that down and just be

2035
01:58:23,045 --> 01:58:26,485
Speaker 5:  there to execute whatever they're required to execute and then move on. And

2036
01:58:26,485 --> 01:58:30,005
Speaker 5:  part of me is sort of endeared to rabbit for trying something else and part

2037
01:58:30,085 --> 01:58:34,005
Speaker 5:  of me is also like, well maybe if it worked but was less cute, I would like

2038
01:58:34,005 --> 01:58:36,365
Speaker 5:  it better. Yeah. And maybe that's what actually matters here.

2039
01:58:36,675 --> 01:58:40,525
Speaker 17:  Yeah. Like there's a cute little animation of the rabbit

2040
01:58:40,745 --> 01:58:44,445
Speaker 17:  in a hamster wheel or something when you, when you need to charge it.

2041
01:58:44,825 --> 01:58:48,645
Speaker 17:  I'm like, this is adorable, but I am annoyed that I need to charge

2042
01:58:48,675 --> 01:58:52,325
Speaker 17:  this thing again. Like, cute only gets you so far, I think.

2043
01:58:52,715 --> 01:58:56,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Do you think there's gonna be ways to put more of this stuff onto

2044
01:58:56,685 --> 01:59:00,445
Speaker 5:  phones in interesting ways? Like is is the next round of flip phones and

2045
01:59:00,445 --> 01:59:02,845
Speaker 5:  foldable phones and smartphone gonna have some of the stuff we're seeing

2046
01:59:02,845 --> 01:59:06,765
Speaker 5:  in these gadgets? Or are we just gonna keep getting phones because like,

2047
01:59:06,765 --> 01:59:09,525
Speaker 5:  I I just keep thinking about the razor as you're talking about it and it's

2048
01:59:09,525 --> 01:59:12,965
Speaker 5:  like, what if the external screen of the razor could run an assistant and

2049
01:59:12,975 --> 01:59:16,325
Speaker 5:  could have that outward facing camera. Like it kind of has all the hardware

2050
01:59:16,325 --> 01:59:19,845
Speaker 5:  it needs to do that. Are we gonna get that do

2051
01:59:19,845 --> 01:59:23,805
Speaker 17:  You think? I I would like it. I mean it would be an ideal

2052
01:59:23,935 --> 01:59:27,885
Speaker 17:  world where you could kind of choose from your AI assistant and

2053
01:59:27,885 --> 01:59:31,205
Speaker 17:  you don't just have to use the one that you're operating system baked in.

2054
01:59:31,275 --> 01:59:34,805
Speaker 17:  Fair. But yeah. Then you get into like the tech

2055
01:59:34,805 --> 01:59:38,325
Speaker 17:  company's gonna let the app makers in, you know,

2056
01:59:38,555 --> 01:59:42,485
Speaker 17:  like get into the system the way it would have to where you don't

2057
01:59:42,585 --> 01:59:46,165
Speaker 17:  run into a wall like chat GPT can't change

2058
01:59:46,285 --> 01:59:49,445
Speaker 17:  settings on my phone. Right. Or like, put something on my calendar. You

2059
01:59:49,445 --> 01:59:53,325
Speaker 17:  know? So I feel like there is a pretty like firm wall on that right

2060
01:59:53,325 --> 01:59:57,205
Speaker 17:  now. And and that would be interesting. I think that's kind

2061
01:59:57,205 --> 02:00:01,005
Speaker 17:  of like rabbit's, you know, ethos is like how do we get around

2062
02:00:01,005 --> 02:00:04,765
Speaker 17:  that? And it, the answer is a weird system where you log

2063
02:00:04,795 --> 02:00:08,325
Speaker 17:  into stuff and Right on, I don't know, a virtual

2064
02:00:08,765 --> 02:00:08,845
Speaker 17:  computer.

2065
02:00:09,315 --> 02:00:12,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The answer is largely you can't right now. It turns out that

2066
02:00:12,765 --> 02:00:15,045
Speaker 17:  That seems to be not working also. So,

2067
02:00:16,185 --> 02:00:19,765
Speaker 5:  But yeah, it's, it's an interesting question and, and my sense would be that's

2068
02:00:19,765 --> 02:00:23,645
Speaker 5:  only happening if regulators make it happen, right? It see it seems to

2069
02:00:23,645 --> 02:00:27,285
Speaker 5:  some extent like more powerful than setting your default browser,

2070
02:00:28,165 --> 02:00:31,525
Speaker 5:  which you can do even more powerful than setting your default search engine,

2071
02:00:31,735 --> 02:00:35,525
Speaker 5:  which has only become a thing because of regulatory pressure.

2072
02:00:35,905 --> 02:00:39,485
Speaker 5:  And essentially you, you could kind of argue it's like allowing you to install

2073
02:00:39,485 --> 02:00:42,765
Speaker 5:  another operating system on top of your operating system. Like If you were

2074
02:00:42,765 --> 02:00:46,485
Speaker 5:  allowed to let chat GPT run your phone. That's a pretty big thing for any

2075
02:00:46,485 --> 02:00:49,045
Speaker 5:  of these companies to be able to do. I kind of agree that's how it should

2076
02:00:49,175 --> 02:00:52,365
Speaker 5:  shake out. If this tech is gonna get better in the way that everybody says

2077
02:00:52,365 --> 02:00:55,765
Speaker 5:  it's gonna get better, it'll be cool to have options and not just be forced

2078
02:00:55,865 --> 02:00:59,845
Speaker 5:  to use better Siri or better Gemini or

2079
02:00:59,845 --> 02:01:03,325
Speaker 5:  better CHATT or whatever. I don't know that I would bet on that ever being

2080
02:01:03,645 --> 02:01:04,205
Speaker 5:  a possibility.

2081
02:01:04,595 --> 02:01:08,285
Speaker 17:  Yeah, that does seem like a big question mark. And then you

2082
02:01:08,425 --> 02:01:11,885
Speaker 17:  get back to just like, well what If you could just

2083
02:01:12,235 --> 02:01:16,165
Speaker 17:  talk to your operating system while you're walking around the kitchen and

2084
02:01:17,115 --> 02:01:21,005
Speaker 17:  it's like, not the ideal future that I want. I think I

2085
02:01:21,005 --> 02:01:24,925
Speaker 17:  want a future where there's weird gadgets or you can download a,

2086
02:01:25,165 --> 02:01:29,085
Speaker 17:  a, a virtual assistant that can actually do things for

2087
02:01:29,085 --> 02:01:32,685
Speaker 17:  you. Yeah. I think that's why I am, I'm on like team phones

2088
02:01:33,085 --> 02:01:37,045
Speaker 17:  'cause it's the realist in me is like, oh, they're not gonna let this

2089
02:01:37,045 --> 02:01:37,445
Speaker 17:  stuff happen.

2090
02:01:38,445 --> 02:01:41,125
Speaker 5:  I think that's probably right. But I do also remember somebody, I forget

2091
02:01:41,125 --> 02:01:44,285
Speaker 5:  who it was, somebody at one of the phone makers years ago was like, we're

2092
02:01:44,285 --> 02:01:47,765
Speaker 5:  gonna get to a point where the phone in your pocket is basically just a cellular

2093
02:01:48,015 --> 02:01:51,845
Speaker 5:  modem and all the accessories around are

2094
02:01:51,845 --> 02:01:55,005
Speaker 5:  going to be connected to that in some way. Your wearable is gonna use that

2095
02:01:55,005 --> 02:01:57,045
Speaker 5:  to connect to the internet. Your headphones, you can use that connect to

2096
02:01:57,245 --> 02:02:00,325
Speaker 5:  the internet. Your laptop is gonna use that to connect to the internet, but

2097
02:02:00,325 --> 02:02:04,165
Speaker 5:  it is, it's going to be less the device you use for everything and more

2098
02:02:04,165 --> 02:02:07,925
Speaker 5:  the device that just lets you use everything everywhere. Yeah. And I think

2099
02:02:07,925 --> 02:02:10,885
Speaker 5:  that's a really interesting version of the future and it's kind of what you

2100
02:02:11,165 --> 02:02:14,845
Speaker 5:  discovered with this is like, I can just use my phone as a go-between

2101
02:02:15,185 --> 02:02:18,485
Speaker 5:  to all these services that exist and with headphones that I already own.

2102
02:02:18,565 --> 02:02:22,445
Speaker 5:  I actually don't need to invent a completely new pipeline for that

2103
02:02:22,445 --> 02:02:25,045
Speaker 5:  stuff. I just need a new way to kind of get at that pipeline.

2104
02:02:25,275 --> 02:02:28,885
Speaker 17:  Yeah. And I've become just an addict for the smartwatch.

2105
02:02:29,155 --> 02:02:32,885
Speaker 17:  Like I, over the past couple years, like I never used one before

2106
02:02:33,385 --> 02:02:37,285
Speaker 17:  and now I cannot live without one. It's just like, it's

2107
02:02:37,285 --> 02:02:41,085
Speaker 17:  the right kind of light interface for when I need to do stuff. Like I'm

2108
02:02:41,085 --> 02:02:44,805
Speaker 17:  out on a walk and I need to pause music or just

2109
02:02:44,895 --> 02:02:48,805
Speaker 17:  check a quick notification or a text. And it's like you run into

2110
02:02:48,805 --> 02:02:52,645
Speaker 17:  the wall very quickly of like, you can't really respond to a text very

2111
02:02:52,645 --> 02:02:56,205
Speaker 17:  well or you can thumbs up emoji something. Right.

2112
02:02:56,425 --> 02:03:00,285
Speaker 17:  But boy has that been like, that is the point where I'm like,

2113
02:03:00,445 --> 02:03:04,205
Speaker 17:  I am so willing to charge this extra thing and it has

2114
02:03:04,265 --> 02:03:07,805
Speaker 17:  its own special charger that I have to bring along when I travel.

2115
02:03:08,065 --> 02:03:11,565
Speaker 17:  And like it crosses that threshold of like, yes,

2116
02:03:12,085 --> 02:03:14,605
Speaker 17:  I will do all of that because I find it so useful.

2117
02:03:15,275 --> 02:03:18,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I think smartwatches probably land in the, the

2118
02:03:18,875 --> 02:03:22,565
Speaker 5:  earbuds category of that kind of light input system

2119
02:03:22,835 --> 02:03:25,885
Speaker 5:  that really works. Like when I wrote, when I wrote the humane pin review,

2120
02:03:25,885 --> 02:03:29,245
Speaker 5:  the overwhelming response was what you're describing is just a better Apple

2121
02:03:29,245 --> 02:03:32,965
Speaker 5:  watch. Yeah. And I think other than the camera stuff, which is

2122
02:03:33,155 --> 02:03:36,685
Speaker 5:  left to be solved, but right now is only kind of somewhat

2123
02:03:36,865 --> 02:03:40,805
Speaker 5:  useful anyway. That is true. Like my big

2124
02:03:40,805 --> 02:03:44,405
Speaker 5:  regret right now is that I didn't buy a cell connected Apple watch. Right.

2125
02:03:44,725 --> 02:03:47,925
Speaker 5:  I know. And I wish, I wish that I had because then I could do all that sort

2126
02:03:47,925 --> 02:03:51,085
Speaker 5:  of lightweight stuff you're talking about without needing my phone in my

2127
02:03:51,085 --> 02:03:51,565
Speaker 5:  pocket. Yeah,

2128
02:03:51,565 --> 02:03:54,445
Speaker 17:  That'd be awesome. You just leave the house. Can you imagine?

2129
02:03:55,245 --> 02:03:58,565
Speaker 5:  I mean, first of all no, no, but also it sounds wonderful.

2130
02:03:58,995 --> 02:03:59,285
Speaker 17:  Yeah.

2131
02:04:00,025 --> 02:04:03,605
Speaker 5:  The idea of your phone as a thing that lives in your pocket, that it lets

2132
02:04:03,605 --> 02:04:06,685
Speaker 5:  everything else connect to the internet strikes me as much more this sort

2133
02:04:06,685 --> 02:04:10,645
Speaker 5:  of AI gadget future than like these all encompassing

2134
02:04:11,025 --> 02:04:12,405
Speaker 5:  new ideas about gadgets.

2135
02:04:12,515 --> 02:04:16,485
Speaker 17:  Yeah. I know it's kind of depressing, but it's

2136
02:04:16,485 --> 02:04:17,365
Speaker 5:  Also I think true. It's

2137
02:04:17,365 --> 02:04:17,565
Speaker 17:  A little bit,

2138
02:04:18,355 --> 02:04:21,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it means like all these other companies, humane Rabbit, everybody

2139
02:04:21,525 --> 02:04:24,005
Speaker 5:  else is like desperately trying to get around your phone, just like you said.

2140
02:04:24,105 --> 02:04:27,885
Speaker 5:  And it's like, oh, this maybe keeps the world the way that it is

2141
02:04:28,105 --> 02:04:32,085
Speaker 5:  if that's how we do it more than I would like. But it also just might

2142
02:04:32,085 --> 02:04:32,485
Speaker 5:  be inevitable.

2143
02:04:32,875 --> 02:04:36,765
Speaker 17:  Yeah. And it's an interesting moment at least. Yeah. Boy is

2144
02:04:36,765 --> 02:04:38,965
Speaker 17:  it not dull right now.

2145
02:04:40,085 --> 02:04:43,525
Speaker 5:  I know. And I'm I'm still thinking about the, the camera comparison and cameras

2146
02:04:43,615 --> 02:04:47,525
Speaker 5:  never came back. No. They just like mid-range. We found a lot

2147
02:04:47,525 --> 02:04:50,485
Speaker 5:  of interesting stuff to do at like the high end and I think about like the

2148
02:04:50,925 --> 02:04:54,245
Speaker 5:  Fuji series that people really love. Like I feel like If you want like a

2149
02:04:54,355 --> 02:04:58,285
Speaker 5:  good camera, your options have never been better. But If you

2150
02:04:58,285 --> 02:05:01,285
Speaker 5:  want a pretty good camera, they don't exist because you have a smartphone.

2151
02:05:01,285 --> 02:05:01,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

2152
02:05:01,705 --> 02:05:02,165
Speaker 17:  You already

2153
02:05:02,165 --> 02:05:05,365
Speaker 5:  Have it. Yeah. And I wonder maybe that's where we're gonna go with AI stuff

2154
02:05:05,385 --> 02:05:08,365
Speaker 5:  and we're a ways away from the ai ai gadgets being any good.

2155
02:05:09,185 --> 02:05:12,205
Speaker 5:  So maybe we're, we're gonna be in a real sort of valley with that stuff for

2156
02:05:12,205 --> 02:05:13,045
Speaker 5:  a little while it feels like.

2157
02:05:13,315 --> 02:05:15,165
Speaker 17:  Yeah. We're gonna find out,

2158
02:05:15,345 --> 02:05:17,765
Speaker 5:  But luckily phones are getting better, so I'll speak to that.

2159
02:05:17,765 --> 02:05:19,965
Speaker 17:  Yeah, yeah. Phones are sticking around I think.

2160
02:05:20,705 --> 02:05:23,805
Speaker 5:  And you've given me yet another reason to buy a flip phone. Oh man. Which

2161
02:05:23,805 --> 02:05:26,085
Speaker 5:  is all I really needed from you was more reasons

2162
02:05:26,605 --> 02:05:30,045
Speaker 17:  I took that Motorola out of the closet. I was like, this is so nice.

2163
02:05:31,065 --> 02:05:33,845
Speaker 17:  Ugh. Just shutting it. Just shutting. It feels good.

2164
02:05:33,915 --> 02:05:37,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm gonna start buying t-shirts with the pocket on the, on the breast.

2165
02:05:37,405 --> 02:05:40,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah, exactly. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna fold it out and just stick it right

2166
02:05:40,125 --> 02:05:42,165
Speaker 5:  there and chat with it all day. It's gonna be amazing. Yeah.

2167
02:05:42,265 --> 02:05:43,365
Speaker 17:  It looks super cool.

2168
02:05:43,715 --> 02:05:47,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I I believe that, I bet you made a lot of friends and everybody thought

2169
02:05:47,325 --> 02:05:49,565
Speaker 5:  you were super normal and cool all the time. Yeah,

2170
02:05:49,845 --> 02:05:53,165
Speaker 17:  I was taking pictures of it for the article and my husband walked into the

2171
02:05:53,165 --> 02:05:56,885
Speaker 17:  kitchen and just slowly backed away. Like, I don't

2172
02:05:56,885 --> 02:05:59,365
Speaker 17:  understand what's happening here and I'm not gonna question it.

2173
02:05:59,945 --> 02:06:02,725
Speaker 5:  That's, that's the correct way to react to AI of all sorts.

2174
02:06:02,755 --> 02:06:04,485
Speaker 17:  Yeah. Probably just back away.

2175
02:06:05,785 --> 02:06:07,805
Speaker 5:  All right, Allison, thank you as always. Thank

2176
02:06:07,805 --> 02:06:07,885
Speaker 17:  You.

2177
02:06:15,595 --> 02:06:19,205
Speaker 5:  Welcome back. So a few weeks ago I started reading this book called The

2178
02:06:19,405 --> 02:06:23,005
Speaker 5:  Notebook, a history of Thinking on paper by a guy named Roland Allen.

2179
02:06:23,185 --> 02:06:26,925
Speaker 5:  And it traces like a thousand years of history

2180
02:06:27,425 --> 02:06:31,205
Speaker 5:  of how people write on paper. He makes

2181
02:06:31,235 --> 02:06:34,845
Speaker 5:  this big case, that paper is this incredibly

2182
02:06:35,605 --> 02:06:39,245
Speaker 5:  critical invention in the history of the world. And that actually

2183
02:06:39,275 --> 02:06:42,925
Speaker 5:  without paper, without notebooks, we wouldn't have modern capitalism.

2184
02:06:43,065 --> 02:06:46,765
Speaker 5:  We wouldn't know nearly as much about history as we do that actually

2185
02:06:47,165 --> 02:06:50,645
Speaker 5:  a lot of the world that we live in is defined by

2186
02:06:51,025 --> 02:06:54,925
Speaker 5:  the way that people wrote stuff down and what they wrote stuff down on. He

2187
02:06:54,925 --> 02:06:58,525
Speaker 5:  tells a whole history of notebooks all the way through the

2188
02:06:58,525 --> 02:07:01,805
Speaker 5:  Renaissance and all the way up to now. And even in the future,

2189
02:07:02,625 --> 02:07:06,525
Speaker 5:  If you listen to the show, you know that I love note taking apps. I love

2190
02:07:06,525 --> 02:07:10,085
Speaker 5:  thinking about how people write stuff down. I think the systems for all this

2191
02:07:10,085 --> 02:07:13,885
Speaker 5:  are fascinating. And this book was like catnip for me. So I asked Roland

2192
02:07:13,885 --> 02:07:17,565
Speaker 5:  to come on the show and talk through some of the big ideas in his book, and

2193
02:07:17,595 --> 02:07:21,405
Speaker 5:  also why notebooks continue to survive in this

2194
02:07:21,405 --> 02:07:25,365
Speaker 5:  increasingly digital world. It's a super fun conversation. I

2195
02:07:25,365 --> 02:07:28,485
Speaker 5:  really enjoyed talking to him. And yes, there is more

2196
02:07:29,665 --> 02:07:33,605
Speaker 5:  12 century history in this episode than most, but we're

2197
02:07:33,605 --> 02:07:37,525
Speaker 5:  gonna go with it. So to start with Roland, I asked him to quickly

2198
02:07:37,855 --> 02:07:41,685
Speaker 5:  recap the case that he makes that paper is

2199
02:07:42,005 --> 02:07:45,605
Speaker 5:  a hugely important invention in the history of the world. And that without

2200
02:07:45,615 --> 02:07:49,205
Speaker 5:  paper we might not have any of this. Here's what he said to that.

2201
02:07:50,095 --> 02:07:52,465
Speaker 18:  Yeah. Permanence is really why

2202
02:07:54,445 --> 02:07:57,825
Speaker 18:  for thousands of years we've had different ways of writing things down as

2203
02:07:57,825 --> 02:08:01,585
Speaker 18:  human beings. So you go back to, you can, you can carve on stone, you can

2204
02:08:02,135 --> 02:08:06,025
Speaker 18:  make little dents in clay tablets, which you then fire and dry out and they're

2205
02:08:06,185 --> 02:08:09,785
Speaker 18:  permanent, but they are clay tablets, so they're not super portable or practical

2206
02:08:10,285 --> 02:08:13,825
Speaker 18:  or robust. Then you have papyrus,

2207
02:08:13,975 --> 02:08:17,025
Speaker 18:  papyrus, the reed product, which grows in

2208
02:08:17,635 --> 02:08:21,265
Speaker 18:  Egypt. And you can write on that, you can draw on that. But

2209
02:08:21,615 --> 02:08:25,465
Speaker 18:  papyrus, it turns out, unless it's actually an in an Egyptian

2210
02:08:25,465 --> 02:08:29,185
Speaker 18:  tomb, completely dry with no movement and nothing to

2211
02:08:29,185 --> 02:08:32,545
Speaker 18:  disturb it, it will just automatically fall apart. It, it, it can't cope

2212
02:08:32,545 --> 02:08:36,025
Speaker 18:  with any kind of damp or it can't really cope with being handled. So

2213
02:08:36,135 --> 02:08:38,945
Speaker 18:  papyrus is handy, but it's not permanent.

2214
02:08:40,085 --> 02:08:43,625
Speaker 18:  And then you have wax tablets and these are beautiful things. They're amazing.

2215
02:08:43,625 --> 02:08:47,585
Speaker 18:  Completely died out in Europe. But for about 2000 years, this

2216
02:08:47,585 --> 02:08:51,505
Speaker 18:  is how Europeans pins retained information,

2217
02:08:51,775 --> 02:08:55,185
Speaker 18:  took notes, wrote poems, agreed

2218
02:08:55,505 --> 02:08:59,305
Speaker 18:  contracts, bills of sale, whatever, with a layer of wax on

2219
02:08:59,495 --> 02:09:03,385
Speaker 18:  wood, which you would then scrape into with a little stylus. Now

2220
02:09:03,385 --> 02:09:07,265
Speaker 18:  obviously that's not permanent, so it's very useful for being an

2221
02:09:07,505 --> 02:09:10,425
Speaker 18:  a poet's notebook, for instance, because you can wipe it over at the end

2222
02:09:10,425 --> 02:09:14,185
Speaker 18:  of the day when you're finished writing your poem. But for a business

2223
02:09:14,185 --> 02:09:18,025
Speaker 18:  record, it's no good at all because you know, you, you have to

2224
02:09:18,025 --> 02:09:21,905
Speaker 18:  know what you agreed, what you contracted. Then you

2225
02:09:21,905 --> 02:09:25,505
Speaker 18:  have parchment, and parchment comes along a little bit later during the

2226
02:09:25,505 --> 02:09:29,465
Speaker 18:  period of the Roman Empire probably. And that's a really good

2227
02:09:29,465 --> 02:09:33,225
Speaker 18:  writing material. It's very tough, it's completely indestructible and

2228
02:09:34,085 --> 02:09:37,105
Speaker 18:  you can write on it beautifully. And you can also paint on it If you like.

2229
02:09:37,245 --> 02:09:40,825
Speaker 18:  So the illuminated manuscripts, which we see the book of Kels and so on,

2230
02:09:40,955 --> 02:09:44,025
Speaker 18:  these are all on parchment and they're very beautiful. But the problem is

2231
02:09:44,025 --> 02:09:47,705
Speaker 18:  when you write on parchment with a pen, the ink

2232
02:09:48,055 --> 02:09:51,265
Speaker 18:  sits on the surface and dries, which means you can scrape it off.

2233
02:09:51,715 --> 02:09:54,945
Speaker 18:  Which means that, again, it's not permanent, you can change it, you can

2234
02:09:54,945 --> 02:09:58,465
Speaker 18:  affect the record. So it's no good for business. Paper turns up in Europe

2235
02:09:58,465 --> 02:10:02,105
Speaker 18:  around the year 12 40, 12 50. And very quickly

2236
02:10:02,385 --> 02:10:06,265
Speaker 18:  a few people realize it's a game changer because anything

2237
02:10:06,265 --> 02:10:09,505
Speaker 18:  which is written on paper, stay with ink stays there.

2238
02:10:10,125 --> 02:10:14,025
Speaker 18:  So you can have a contract, you can keep a business record, you

2239
02:10:14,025 --> 02:10:17,465
Speaker 18:  can do anything legal, you can have a deed, for instance, and you don't

2240
02:10:17,465 --> 02:10:21,145
Speaker 18:  have to worry about it being forged. Yeah. And that's

2241
02:10:21,145 --> 02:10:24,905
Speaker 18:  important. So paper is really important because it's permanent and that

2242
02:10:24,955 --> 02:10:27,625
Speaker 18:  leads to, its very, very rapid adoption

2243
02:10:28,885 --> 02:10:31,025
Speaker 18:  in the business community in particular.

2244
02:10:31,925 --> 02:10:34,645
Speaker 5:  Was that where it started? I was, was I was trying to match some of the timelines

2245
02:10:34,705 --> 02:10:38,685
Speaker 5:  and going back through, it seems like, if I

2246
02:10:38,685 --> 02:10:42,445
Speaker 5:  have the timeline correct, there were, there were two threads.

2247
02:10:42,445 --> 02:10:46,405
Speaker 5:  There was kind of the people who use it for business and people who use it

2248
02:10:46,825 --> 02:10:50,685
Speaker 5:  for recording things in their own personal lives. But it does seem like business

2249
02:10:51,065 --> 02:10:54,805
Speaker 5:  became a real use case for notebooks first.

2250
02:10:55,435 --> 02:10:59,365
Speaker 18:  Yeah, absolutely. A hundred percent. And the analogy, which you can very

2251
02:10:59,365 --> 02:11:03,245
Speaker 18:  easily draw is with the modern computer. Mm. You know, that comes

2252
02:11:03,245 --> 02:11:07,125
Speaker 18:  from IBM and its businesses and governments, which have it

2253
02:11:07,125 --> 02:11:10,525
Speaker 18:  to begin with for the first how long? 30 years, maybe 40 years.

2254
02:11:11,465 --> 02:11:14,805
Speaker 18:  And then you get people using it creatively, and then you get people like

2255
02:11:14,805 --> 02:11:17,645
Speaker 18:  jobs thinking, oh, you can have some fun with this thing. You know, you

2256
02:11:17,645 --> 02:11:21,125
Speaker 18:  can play games on it, but you can also be seriously creative. So now you

2257
02:11:21,125 --> 02:11:24,965
Speaker 18:  have Pixar, for instance, and I don't think anyone at IBM in the 1940s

2258
02:11:25,145 --> 02:11:28,965
Speaker 18:  was thinking that Pixar was gonna happen. Right. Looking back, it seems

2259
02:11:28,965 --> 02:11:32,885
Speaker 18:  inevitable that people would do something like that. And it's exactly

2260
02:11:32,945 --> 02:11:35,445
Speaker 18:  the same kind of relationship with notebooks. You have

2261
02:11:36,955 --> 02:11:40,395
Speaker 18:  businesses come to rely on notebooks, utterly, they use them for everything.

2262
02:11:41,215 --> 02:11:45,105
Speaker 18:  And therefore notebooks get into everyone's

2263
02:11:45,105 --> 02:11:48,505
Speaker 18:  hands, particularly in a culture like Italy, which at the time Italy's the

2264
02:11:48,505 --> 02:11:51,705
Speaker 18:  richest part of Europe. But it's also where they invent banking, where they

2265
02:11:51,705 --> 02:11:55,585
Speaker 18:  invent companies, where they invent accountancy, double entry, bookkeeping,

2266
02:11:55,815 --> 02:11:59,745
Speaker 18:  limited liability, partnerships, futures, markets, all of these things

2267
02:11:59,755 --> 02:12:01,265
Speaker 18:  which we know and love.

2268
02:12:01,685 --> 02:12:05,145
Speaker 5:  And, and a lot of that you talk about happens,

2269
02:12:05,925 --> 02:12:09,905
Speaker 5:  not sort of, it, it, that doesn't happen. And then they put it down in notebooks,

2270
02:12:09,905 --> 02:12:13,785
Speaker 5:  like the existence of those things and notebooks and this new

2271
02:12:13,785 --> 02:12:16,825
Speaker 5:  writing, permanent technology go hand in hand.

2272
02:12:17,545 --> 02:12:21,505
Speaker 18:  Absolutely. You can't do one without the other. But then of course, so they

2273
02:12:21,505 --> 02:12:25,105
Speaker 18:  have to have these notebooks, and once they have to have them in the evening,

2274
02:12:25,105 --> 02:12:28,705
Speaker 18:  they take 'em home and then, then they do the fun stuff with them. And that's

2275
02:12:29,185 --> 02:12:32,945
Speaker 18:  entirely accidental, I think. But, you know, thank God

2276
02:12:32,945 --> 02:12:35,465
Speaker 18:  from our point of view, it's given us all of this interesting literature

2277
02:12:35,465 --> 02:12:36,705
Speaker 18:  and art and poetry.

2278
02:12:37,215 --> 02:12:40,905
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So I confess I'm particularly interested in the fun stuff. So let,

2279
02:12:40,905 --> 02:12:43,865
Speaker 5:  let's start there. I think the, the first thing I had written down in my

2280
02:12:43,865 --> 02:12:47,745
Speaker 5:  notes was like, let's go back to Florence and, and there's a

2281
02:12:47,745 --> 02:12:51,625
Speaker 5:  word that starts with a Z that I can't pronounce. And it was, it

2282
02:12:51,625 --> 02:12:55,425
Speaker 5:  was, it, my, my gut tells me it's pronounced zibo, but I could be

2283
02:12:55,425 --> 02:12:55,625
Speaker 5:  wrong.

2284
02:12:56,265 --> 02:13:00,065
Speaker 18:  I you are that right? Yeah. Yes. I I you just have to imagine yourself ordering

2285
02:13:00,105 --> 02:13:02,985
Speaker 18:  a ian an Italian restaurant and you'll be fine. Right.

2286
02:13:03,185 --> 02:13:06,465
Speaker 5:  A, a type of notebook and also a beautiful croissant like thing

2287
02:13:07,015 --> 02:13:10,905
Speaker 5:  that I will like very much. Tell me what those were. Talk a little bit about,

2288
02:13:10,905 --> 02:13:12,145
Speaker 5:  well, kind of how that spread.

2289
02:13:12,535 --> 02:13:16,345
Speaker 18:  Okay. Back to the restaurant, Zal seems to have been a word for salad

2290
02:13:16,845 --> 02:13:20,745
Speaker 18:  and that's exactly what it is. So it's a collection of lots

2291
02:13:20,745 --> 02:13:24,585
Speaker 18:  of different things jumbled together. Now, this is a time

2292
02:13:24,585 --> 02:13:27,865
Speaker 18:  before print, we're talking about about 1300 and it's Florence

2293
02:13:28,405 --> 02:13:31,925
Speaker 18:  and it's a time before print. So If you wanted to have any book or

2294
02:13:32,205 --> 02:13:36,085
Speaker 18:  literature or poetry in your house, you had to basically write

2295
02:13:36,085 --> 02:13:39,205
Speaker 18:  it down yourself. Yeah. And therefore,

2296
02:13:40,685 --> 02:13:43,605
Speaker 18:  Florence is a very business-like community. They're very entrepreneurial.

2297
02:13:44,165 --> 02:13:46,285
Speaker 18:  Everyone's got their own little business, therefore everyone's got their

2298
02:13:46,925 --> 02:13:50,645
Speaker 18:  business notebooks. They take 'em home in the evening and

2299
02:13:50,705 --> 02:13:54,245
Speaker 18:  if they hear a poem which they like, or if they hear is one of

2300
02:13:54,365 --> 02:13:58,245
Speaker 18:  ESOP's fables is very popular, or a bit of ovid or a prayer, which

2301
02:13:58,245 --> 02:14:02,005
Speaker 18:  is particularly resonant to them, or a recipe, very often they're writing

2302
02:14:02,005 --> 02:14:05,925
Speaker 18:  down medic medicinal cures. Anything you wanna keep written down in your

2303
02:14:05,925 --> 02:14:09,365
Speaker 18:  house, you just write it down in your zal. And it's a very personal notebook,

2304
02:14:09,705 --> 02:14:12,845
Speaker 18:  but it's completely unsorted. So it's like a salad in this jumbled up way.

2305
02:14:14,065 --> 02:14:17,125
Speaker 18:  And they're brilliant because they're these windows

2306
02:14:17,835 --> 02:14:21,645
Speaker 18:  into what Florentine people loved. Yeah. So we

2307
02:14:21,645 --> 02:14:25,205
Speaker 18:  know the poetry, they like to read, we know the prayers that they wanted

2308
02:14:25,205 --> 02:14:28,405
Speaker 18:  to remember. We know the stories that they like to tell and we know what

2309
02:14:28,405 --> 02:14:31,525
Speaker 18:  they liked to eat when they had a headache. You know, all of this kind of

2310
02:14:31,525 --> 02:14:35,405
Speaker 18:  information because everyone in Florence at this time who could read or

2311
02:14:35,405 --> 02:14:39,305
Speaker 18:  write, which was most of them unusually, they kept aze

2312
02:14:39,305 --> 02:14:42,945
Speaker 18:  baldoni. And it was a really strange local thing. But it was so fun.

2313
02:14:43,665 --> 02:14:46,785
Speaker 5:  I also get the sense that folks back then were reckoning with the same thing

2314
02:14:46,785 --> 02:14:49,785
Speaker 5:  people reckon with now, which is like, what do I do with any of this? And

2315
02:14:50,095 --> 02:14:53,705
Speaker 5:  this is sort of the eternal question of notebooks, right? Is you,

2316
02:14:53,885 --> 02:14:57,425
Speaker 5:  you write a bunch of stuff down, you collect all this stuff. And as a historical

2317
02:14:57,425 --> 02:15:00,545
Speaker 5:  artifact, especially in aggregate, it's very cool, right? You, you get a

2318
02:15:00,545 --> 02:15:04,505
Speaker 5:  sense of what people were doing in a, in a community. But if

2319
02:15:04,565 --> 02:15:07,905
Speaker 5:  I'm a person in Florence in the 13 hundreds keeping one of these,

2320
02:15:09,455 --> 02:15:12,505
Speaker 5:  what do, what am I doing with it day to day? What's gonna happen to these

2321
02:15:12,705 --> 02:15:16,105
Speaker 5:  notebooks? Are they thinking about like the grand sweep of history and their

2322
02:15:16,105 --> 02:15:18,505
Speaker 5:  responsibility to write this stuff down? Like what were the, what was the

2323
02:15:18,505 --> 02:15:19,545
Speaker 5:  point of these notebooks?

2324
02:15:20,085 --> 02:15:23,945
Speaker 18:  So the, well only the, the only point was fun. They weren't

2325
02:15:23,945 --> 02:15:26,425
Speaker 18:  thinking about the grand sweep of history, but they knew that they were

2326
02:15:26,465 --> 02:15:30,105
Speaker 18:  a bit precious because they would leave them in their wills. So this is

2327
02:15:30,105 --> 02:15:33,665
Speaker 18:  how we know, one of the ways we know how many people had them, because the

2328
02:15:33,665 --> 02:15:36,745
Speaker 18:  wills often survive. And also you see these little

2329
02:15:37,055 --> 02:15:40,665
Speaker 18:  dedications in the, someone will start their Z will, don't they? Then they'll

2330
02:15:40,665 --> 02:15:43,985
Speaker 18:  leave it to their son. And then the son will have an argument on the pages

2331
02:15:44,005 --> 02:15:47,585
Speaker 18:  of the ziel with his brother saying, oh no, he dad left it to me

2332
02:15:48,065 --> 02:15:51,585
Speaker 18:  actually. You know? So you have these little bickerings and you can see

2333
02:15:51,585 --> 02:15:54,905
Speaker 18:  that sometimes they pass down three generations and that people maintain

2334
02:15:54,905 --> 02:15:56,105
Speaker 18:  them 'cause the handwriting changes.

2335
02:15:57,725 --> 02:16:01,625
Speaker 18:  So that's one thing. So ziel donia, they're always for fun, but

2336
02:16:01,625 --> 02:16:04,505
Speaker 18:  people definitely keep know that they have a value.

2337
02:16:05,525 --> 02:16:09,385
Speaker 18:  The other thing that they also start doing is viewing their family as

2338
02:16:09,425 --> 02:16:13,145
Speaker 18:  a kind of business and then keeping it what they would call a libre de familia.

2339
02:16:14,005 --> 02:16:17,905
Speaker 18:  Oh, well, za is the other word for it. Where they keep a family

2340
02:16:17,905 --> 02:16:20,945
Speaker 18:  record, which is essentially births, deaths, marriages,

2341
02:16:21,415 --> 02:16:24,705
Speaker 18:  investments, you know, we bought this house, I invested in this company,

2342
02:16:25,205 --> 02:16:28,705
Speaker 18:  my daughter got married, my son died, my grandson was born, he was

2343
02:16:29,045 --> 02:16:32,765
Speaker 18:  baptized, et cetera. And they're very businesslike. You

2344
02:16:32,765 --> 02:16:36,685
Speaker 18:  wouldn't call them diaries because there's no emotion in there. There's

2345
02:16:36,685 --> 02:16:40,645
Speaker 18:  no happiness or sadness. But they just record the central

2346
02:16:40,905 --> 02:16:44,045
Speaker 18:  of most important events of a family's life. And then that would get passed

2347
02:16:44,045 --> 02:16:47,925
Speaker 18:  down through the generations as well. And that, but that's more viewing

2348
02:16:47,925 --> 02:16:51,765
Speaker 18:  your family in a kind of quite serious business-like way. If you

2349
02:16:51,765 --> 02:16:55,445
Speaker 18:  were a grammar school in the, say

2350
02:16:55,445 --> 02:16:59,125
Speaker 18:  15 hundreds, 16 hundreds in Europe, you were

2351
02:16:59,405 --> 02:17:02,565
Speaker 18:  expected to keep a commonplace book in a very rigorous way. And that was

2352
02:17:02,605 --> 02:17:06,445
Speaker 18:  a very formal kind of thing. But that was educational, you know, that wasn't,

2353
02:17:06,505 --> 02:17:10,285
Speaker 18:  no one ever really did that for fun. 'cause it's such hard work. Yeah. It's

2354
02:17:10,285 --> 02:17:14,205
Speaker 18:  a, it's a real effort and it's study. But I think that outside of

2355
02:17:14,205 --> 02:17:18,085
Speaker 18:  school you have people like Leonardo who would just draw all

2356
02:17:18,085 --> 02:17:21,405
Speaker 18:  over the place. You have people who doodle. You have people who write very

2357
02:17:21,645 --> 02:17:24,885
Speaker 18:  intimate personal diaries, people who write very formal ones, people who

2358
02:17:24,885 --> 02:17:28,765
Speaker 18:  write about their relationship with God. You know, there's no hard and

2359
02:17:28,765 --> 02:17:29,285
Speaker 18:  fast rules.

2360
02:17:30,455 --> 02:17:34,105
Speaker 5:  Okay. And that feels like the, the thing that

2361
02:17:34,815 --> 02:17:38,225
Speaker 5:  lingers most over time is that everybody is perpetually finding new ways

2362
02:17:38,845 --> 02:17:42,825
Speaker 5:  to fill up a notebook. Yeah. Kind of more chaotic over time

2363
02:17:43,165 --> 02:17:46,425
Speaker 5:  too. Everybody gets weirder and weirder about notebooks.

2364
02:17:47,365 --> 02:17:50,265
Speaker 5:  Da Vinci is an interesting one. You, you mentioned him and obviously I would

2365
02:17:50,265 --> 02:17:54,145
Speaker 5:  say you've obviously done more research on this than I have, but I

2366
02:17:54,145 --> 02:17:57,745
Speaker 5:  would say Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks probably history's most famous

2367
02:17:58,025 --> 02:17:59,825
Speaker 5:  notebooks, fair to say. Yeah,

2368
02:18:00,185 --> 02:18:03,385
Speaker 18:  I would say so. Yeah. Yeah. Those are the ones when I was telling people

2369
02:18:03,385 --> 02:18:05,985
Speaker 18:  that I was writing history of Notebook and they were looking baffled, I

2370
02:18:05,985 --> 02:18:08,145
Speaker 18:  would go, you know, Leonardo. Right.

2371
02:18:09,055 --> 02:18:12,345
Speaker 5:  Well, one thing I thought was really interesting in, in your telling of his

2372
02:18:12,345 --> 02:18:13,265
Speaker 5:  story was that he

2373
02:18:14,965 --> 02:18:18,345
Speaker 5:  did not seem to imagine that his notebooks would eventually become wildly

2374
02:18:18,345 --> 02:18:22,265
Speaker 5:  famous. And the idea that these were for public consumption

2375
02:18:23,835 --> 02:18:26,615
Speaker 5:  was kind of a thing that happened much later. The notebooks were very

2376
02:18:26,895 --> 02:18:27,335
Speaker 18:  Personal much

2377
02:18:27,335 --> 02:18:31,215
Speaker 5:  Later. Yeah. And very individual. How did that change come about? Like

2378
02:18:31,215 --> 02:18:34,935
Speaker 5:  at what point did people start writing notebooks, even in some of the

2379
02:18:34,935 --> 02:18:37,455
Speaker 5:  styles that you're talking about, thinking about other people?

2380
02:18:38,455 --> 02:18:41,985
Speaker 18:  Very, very late in the day. I would say, I think what's interesting,

2381
02:18:42,515 --> 02:18:46,225
Speaker 18:  Leonardo's notebooks are fascinating for two reasons, I think very

2382
02:18:46,325 --> 02:18:50,265
Speaker 18:  far apart in time. Firstly, because they're an amazing record of his thoughts,

2383
02:18:50,405 --> 02:18:54,345
Speaker 18:  his researches, his explorations and his personality up to a point

2384
02:18:55,085 --> 02:18:58,825
Speaker 18:  so that that period around the year 1500, wow. You know,

2385
02:18:58,825 --> 02:19:02,785
Speaker 18:  there was something really incredible going on there. And then basically

2386
02:19:04,005 --> 02:19:07,935
Speaker 18:  they just vanish into aristocrats libraries. Mm. You know, and

2387
02:19:08,195 --> 02:19:11,375
Speaker 18:  no one reads them, no one, they probably pull 'em off the shelf and just

2388
02:19:11,375 --> 02:19:14,735
Speaker 18:  look at them as a curiosity. No one studies them at all

2389
02:19:15,025 --> 02:19:18,655
Speaker 18:  until the 1890s when a German guy called

2390
02:19:18,685 --> 02:19:22,495
Speaker 18:  Richter goes around Europe. He looks at them all, he transcribes them,

2391
02:19:22,715 --> 02:19:25,935
Speaker 18:  he researches, he writes about them. And then for the first time,

2392
02:19:26,485 --> 02:19:30,405
Speaker 18:  400 years nearly after Leonardo dies, people

2393
02:19:30,725 --> 02:19:34,445
Speaker 18:  actually realize, oh, he wasn't just a good painter, he was also

2394
02:19:34,625 --> 02:19:38,165
Speaker 18:  all of these other kinds of genius as well, because he was just known as

2395
02:19:38,165 --> 02:19:41,725
Speaker 18:  a painter up to that point. And then, and I think it is

2396
02:19:42,205 --> 02:19:45,965
Speaker 18:  a direct result of the publication of Leonardo's

2397
02:19:46,125 --> 02:19:50,005
Speaker 18:  notebooks and people understanding that there's this process behind his

2398
02:19:50,005 --> 02:19:53,965
Speaker 18:  genius, then everyone else starts taking their notebooks much more

2399
02:19:53,965 --> 02:19:57,725
Speaker 18:  seriously. So Picasso, for instance, he starts painting in the 1890s at

2400
02:19:57,725 --> 02:20:00,245
Speaker 18:  exactly the same time or learns how to paint. He's a boy.

2401
02:20:01,665 --> 02:20:05,525
Speaker 18:  And he, for instance, took his sketchbooks incredibly seriously. He

2402
02:20:05,525 --> 02:20:09,285
Speaker 18:  never gave them away, he never lost them. He kept them filed away in boxes

2403
02:20:09,585 --> 02:20:13,365
Speaker 18:  in his house in the south of France, and they were numbered, cataloged,

2404
02:20:13,365 --> 02:20:16,365
Speaker 18:  ordered. He knew that his sketchbooks were really important,

2405
02:20:16,955 --> 02:20:19,485
Speaker 18:  whereas painters a hundred years before him,

2406
02:20:21,295 --> 02:20:24,635
Speaker 18:  it seems to have been a very casual relationship. You know, or rather they,

2407
02:20:24,635 --> 02:20:27,755
Speaker 18:  they themselves use their notebooks, but they had no sense that anyone else

2408
02:20:27,755 --> 02:20:30,035
Speaker 18:  would ever find them. Interesting. So

2409
02:20:31,705 --> 02:20:34,795
Speaker 18:  yeah, I think there's definitely a change. And I think that Leonardo sort

2410
02:20:34,795 --> 02:20:38,595
Speaker 18:  of accidentally 400 years after his death prompts it. Yeah.

2411
02:20:38,655 --> 02:20:42,395
Speaker 18:  And, and to the extent, you know, if any kind of well-known writer

2412
02:20:42,575 --> 02:20:45,715
Speaker 18:  now will sell their papers to the University of

2413
02:20:47,455 --> 02:20:51,235
Speaker 18:  the University of Austin, for instance. Right. You know, collects writer's

2414
02:20:51,435 --> 02:20:55,265
Speaker 18:  notebooks and it will pay good money for them a hundred, 150

2415
02:20:55,265 --> 02:20:58,185
Speaker 18:  years ago, you know, universities were not doing that, they would, wouldn't

2416
02:20:58,185 --> 02:20:58,705
Speaker 18:  have seen the value.

2417
02:20:59,205 --> 02:21:03,105
Speaker 5:  Do you think that changes the way we look at those notebooks now? I mean,

2418
02:21:03,105 --> 02:21:06,265
Speaker 5:  I, I think about even go back to Florence, like you, you, you think about

2419
02:21:07,075 --> 02:21:10,745
Speaker 5:  those as an important record of real life

2420
02:21:11,365 --> 02:21:14,865
Speaker 5:  in a way that as soon as people become self-conscious that someone else might

2421
02:21:14,865 --> 02:21:18,785
Speaker 5:  see their notebooks, it sort of ceases to be a record of

2422
02:21:18,895 --> 02:21:22,745
Speaker 5:  real life. It, it becomes an Instagram version of real life where

2423
02:21:22,745 --> 02:21:26,465
Speaker 5:  everything is maybe subtly self-consciously

2424
02:21:26,735 --> 02:21:30,585
Speaker 5:  changed to be for public consumption in a way

2425
02:21:30,585 --> 02:21:34,065
Speaker 5:  that, I don't know, like I, we, we think about notebooks as these intensely

2426
02:21:34,065 --> 02:21:36,505
Speaker 5:  private things, but as soon as you understand that someone else might see

2427
02:21:36,505 --> 02:21:39,145
Speaker 5:  it. I wonder if it changes what that thing is.

2428
02:21:39,725 --> 02:21:43,345
Speaker 18:  Oh, well, certainly when it comes to diary writing in particular, so the,

2429
02:21:44,245 --> 02:21:47,825
Speaker 18:  any number of published diaries you can tell were written with publication

2430
02:21:47,825 --> 02:21:51,545
Speaker 18:  in mind. Mm. I write a diary every day and I don't

2431
02:21:51,725 --> 02:21:53,665
Speaker 18:  expect that anyone else will ever read it.

2432
02:21:55,205 --> 02:21:58,265
Speaker 18:  And it's certainly never gonna be published. And it's, I think you're right.

2433
02:21:58,265 --> 02:22:02,145
Speaker 18:  It's more intimate and it's, you know, that it's pretty uncensored

2434
02:22:03,155 --> 02:22:06,985
Speaker 18:  unfiltered, but then you have the Tony Blairs of this world

2435
02:22:06,985 --> 02:22:10,945
Speaker 18:  whose diaries are published, I think. Sure. And that's a

2436
02:22:10,945 --> 02:22:12,225
Speaker 18:  completely different kettle of phish.

2437
02:22:12,695 --> 02:22:16,425
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I guess that's okay. Both of those things can exist, but they are

2438
02:22:16,735 --> 02:22:17,625
Speaker 5:  very different things.

2439
02:22:17,855 --> 02:22:20,025
Speaker 18:  Yeah, yeah. Very, very definitely. Yeah.

2440
02:22:20,215 --> 02:22:24,185
Speaker 5:  Okay. I am really curious about how you as a person in,

2441
02:22:24,205 --> 02:22:28,095
Speaker 5:  in a digital world came to think about notebooks.

2442
02:22:28,095 --> 02:22:31,775
Speaker 5:  Because again, there is such a, there's so much about

2443
02:22:32,005 --> 02:22:35,895
Speaker 5:  that history that a feels very modern. Like we're, we're talking about

2444
02:22:35,895 --> 02:22:39,415
Speaker 5:  the same kinds of things now and like you said, using computers for the same

2445
02:22:39,415 --> 02:22:43,095
Speaker 5:  kinds of things that people were using notebooks for 800 years

2446
02:22:43,255 --> 02:22:47,155
Speaker 5:  ago. But I wonder if you're going through and you have to spend time

2447
02:22:47,155 --> 02:22:51,115
Speaker 5:  thinking about the thing itself and, and like you said,

2448
02:22:51,115 --> 02:22:54,755
Speaker 5:  paper is this crucially important invention, and

2449
02:22:55,295 --> 02:22:59,235
Speaker 5:  if we had invented computers in 1200 instead of inventing paper,

2450
02:22:59,365 --> 02:23:03,355
Speaker 5:  would it have gone roughly the same way? Or is there something about

2451
02:23:04,145 --> 02:23:07,875
Speaker 5:  that thing and that time and that invention that

2452
02:23:08,025 --> 02:23:11,155
Speaker 5:  made it different from even everything that came after?

2453
02:23:12,155 --> 02:23:15,635
Speaker 18:  I think up to a point, the invention makes the time. You know,

2454
02:23:16,535 --> 02:23:19,755
Speaker 18:  you said to me very confidently that we live in a digital world, you know,

2455
02:23:20,415 --> 02:23:24,355
Speaker 18:  and, and of course you are, right? Yeah. We do definitely live in the digital

2456
02:23:24,355 --> 02:23:28,155
Speaker 18:  world. We're speaking to each other, you know, via a digital link

2457
02:23:28,175 --> 02:23:31,915
Speaker 18:  up and surrounded by amazing technology. I would

2458
02:23:31,945 --> 02:23:35,395
Speaker 18:  also, if I was being contrarian and say to you, you are living in a notebook

2459
02:23:35,395 --> 02:23:39,315
Speaker 18:  world. Hmm. Because capitalism, which gives us all of we,

2460
02:23:39,315 --> 02:23:42,995
Speaker 18:  what we see around us, that for 600

2461
02:23:43,005 --> 02:23:46,715
Speaker 18:  years was entirely based in notebooks.

2462
02:23:47,015 --> 02:23:50,875
Speaker 18:  We would call them ledgers or account books, but it was an entirely

2463
02:23:51,195 --> 02:23:54,235
Speaker 18:  notebook based system until the first IBM machines. So,

2464
02:23:55,095 --> 02:23:58,995
Speaker 18:  and that was invented at the same time as, or roughly speaking the same

2465
02:23:58,995 --> 02:24:02,795
Speaker 18:  time as the notebook arrives in, in Europe, in sort of in that place in

2466
02:24:02,795 --> 02:24:06,475
Speaker 18:  Italy around the year 1300. They invent all of the mechanisms of

2467
02:24:06,475 --> 02:24:10,435
Speaker 18:  capitalism. So really we are in that world as much as we're in

2468
02:24:10,435 --> 02:24:14,235
Speaker 18:  the digital world. But yeah, and I, there is definitely a

2469
02:24:14,235 --> 02:24:18,115
Speaker 18:  sense of you have an invention and then it shapes the

2470
02:24:18,115 --> 02:24:21,395
Speaker 18:  world that you live in. But in unexpected, surprising, fun,

2471
02:24:21,585 --> 02:24:25,435
Speaker 18:  hopefully ways no one saw that Twitter was coming

2472
02:24:25,495 --> 02:24:29,075
Speaker 18:  10 years before Twitter arrived. Sure. But, and then suddenly it's everywhere,

2473
02:24:29,075 --> 02:24:32,035
Speaker 18:  and then suddenly it's nowhere again. You know? So who knows?

2474
02:24:32,495 --> 02:24:36,155
Speaker 5:  So, okay, let's, let's fast forward a bunch in history to,

2475
02:24:37,135 --> 02:24:40,755
Speaker 5:  not now, but close to now. And I wanna talk about the bullet journal.

2476
02:24:41,075 --> 02:24:44,355
Speaker 5:  And the reason I wanted to start with the Z is that I feel like you can draw

2477
02:24:44,555 --> 02:24:48,115
Speaker 5:  a straight line from that thing in Florence

2478
02:24:48,485 --> 02:24:51,995
Speaker 5:  800 years ago to the bullet journal phenomenon of

2479
02:24:52,325 --> 02:24:55,995
Speaker 5:  today, like, like a dead straight line

2480
02:24:56,025 --> 02:24:58,795
Speaker 5:  through almost a millennium of time.

2481
02:25:00,375 --> 02:25:04,235
Speaker 5:  How, how is that possible? Like, why do you think this, this thing,

2482
02:25:04,235 --> 02:25:07,915
Speaker 5:  this idea of how we want to record our lives in a

2483
02:25:08,075 --> 02:25:11,555
Speaker 5:  physical notebook has been So, I

2484
02:25:11,555 --> 02:25:15,415
Speaker 5:  consistently persistent over so

2485
02:25:15,415 --> 02:25:16,055
Speaker 5:  many centuries.

2486
02:25:17,165 --> 02:25:20,495
Speaker 18:  It's a really great, simple, minimal tool. I think like

2487
02:25:20,885 --> 02:25:24,645
Speaker 18:  with, with any kind of technology, there's this a, there's a, or any kind

2488
02:25:24,645 --> 02:25:28,445
Speaker 18:  of invention, there's a real virtue to simplicity. You know, so your,

2489
02:25:28,475 --> 02:25:32,405
Speaker 18:  your knife and fork or your chopsticks, chopsticks are great because they're

2490
02:25:32,405 --> 02:25:36,365
Speaker 18:  minimal. Yeah. You can't, once you've pictured them, you've invented them

2491
02:25:36,365 --> 02:25:39,965
Speaker 18:  once. You cannot improve on them. And a notebook I think is a lot like that.

2492
02:25:40,465 --> 02:25:43,085
Speaker 18:  It came to a kind of, very quickly, it became

2493
02:25:44,185 --> 02:25:47,715
Speaker 18:  kind of perfect in terms of its how practical it was, how cheap it was,

2494
02:25:47,735 --> 02:25:51,475
Speaker 18:  how available it was to everyone. And you can't really

2495
02:25:51,475 --> 02:25:55,395
Speaker 18:  improve on that as a bit of technology, you know, because, and then people

2496
02:25:55,395 --> 02:25:59,275
Speaker 18:  will use it in different ways over history. And bullet journals are, I

2497
02:25:59,275 --> 02:26:02,035
Speaker 18:  think, a really good example of how you can take this really simple thing

2498
02:26:02,375 --> 02:26:06,075
Speaker 18:  and just use it in a slightly new way. And suddenly it opens possibilities

2499
02:26:06,175 --> 02:26:09,755
Speaker 18:  for people which they never appreciated before. Like, there are a lot of

2500
02:26:09,755 --> 02:26:09,955
Speaker 18:  people

2501
02:26:11,685 --> 02:26:15,275
Speaker 18:  whose genuinely, there are a surprising number of people whose lives have

2502
02:26:15,275 --> 02:26:19,195
Speaker 18:  really been improved by doing bullet points to

2503
02:26:19,475 --> 02:26:22,715
Speaker 18:  organize their life. And it kind of helps them to rationalize things and

2504
02:26:22,715 --> 02:26:26,315
Speaker 18:  make proper decisions and act more intentionally and therefore, thereby

2505
02:26:26,315 --> 02:26:30,075
Speaker 18:  live happier lives. I think I, I find it constantly

2506
02:26:30,075 --> 02:26:33,795
Speaker 18:  incredible how this really simple thing can be reinvented so

2507
02:26:33,795 --> 02:26:36,275
Speaker 18:  regularly, but you're right, there is a continuous line all the way through.

2508
02:26:36,955 --> 02:26:40,555
Speaker 18:  I think it's just 'cause it's incredibly simple and it doesn't require batteries,

2509
02:26:41,015 --> 02:26:44,915
Speaker 18:  it doesn't require system updates. It's, you know, If you drop it, it doesn't

2510
02:26:44,915 --> 02:26:45,075
Speaker 18:  break.

2511
02:26:45,785 --> 02:26:49,075
Speaker 5:  What was it that was interesting to you about the bullet journal and, and

2512
02:26:49,295 --> 02:26:52,755
Speaker 5:  its history? Like why, why did that jump out to you as a, as a thing worth

2513
02:26:52,755 --> 02:26:53,835
Speaker 5:  adding to this history?

2514
02:26:55,265 --> 02:26:56,765
Speaker 18:  It was important to me because,

2515
02:26:58,345 --> 02:27:01,955
Speaker 18:  firstly, because it was a, it was a real thing, it was a real trend, you

2516
02:27:01,955 --> 02:27:04,555
Speaker 18:  know, when I was starting to think about the book and it, it gave me sort

2517
02:27:04,555 --> 02:27:07,915
Speaker 18:  of confidence that there was gonna be an appetite of people who were interested

2518
02:27:07,915 --> 02:27:11,555
Speaker 18:  in this stuff, which is very key in terms of building my

2519
02:27:11,555 --> 02:27:15,475
Speaker 18:  confidence. And then what was interesting was, I never,

2520
02:27:15,545 --> 02:27:18,875
Speaker 18:  I've never bullet journaled myself. I've never done the writer Carroll method,

2521
02:27:19,295 --> 02:27:23,115
Speaker 18:  but I got his book and then I spoke to him, interviewed him, and

2522
02:27:23,905 --> 02:27:27,755
Speaker 18:  he's really thought about it quite deeply. And he's thought

2523
02:27:27,755 --> 02:27:31,235
Speaker 18:  about the implications of writing stuff down and of organizing your thoughts

2524
02:27:31,235 --> 02:27:34,235
Speaker 18:  on the page and having this notebook, which he carry everywhere, and which

2525
02:27:34,235 --> 02:27:38,195
Speaker 18:  you write everything down on. And that kind of encouraged me to

2526
02:27:38,195 --> 02:27:41,355
Speaker 18:  think deeply about it too. Hmm. You know, he's taken it very seriously for

2527
02:27:41,355 --> 02:27:44,475
Speaker 18:  a long time and he's thought about it in a particular way and I'm, I've

2528
02:27:44,475 --> 02:27:47,035
Speaker 18:  got a more historical angle and I think about it in different ways, but

2529
02:27:47,035 --> 02:27:50,675
Speaker 18:  they're completely compatible. But the, just the fact that he had taken

2530
02:27:50,855 --> 02:27:54,435
Speaker 18:  it seriously, I found really interesting. And, and

2531
02:27:54,525 --> 02:27:58,235
Speaker 18:  hence giving him a chapter, I think was, you know, kind of fair

2532
02:27:58,235 --> 02:28:01,555
Speaker 18:  because he was really about the only person who had written a book about

2533
02:28:02,555 --> 02:28:06,435
Speaker 18:  notebooking, you know? Yeah. Before I did so, and

2534
02:28:06,435 --> 02:28:09,915
Speaker 18:  he also has some really interesting things to say about notebooks, which

2535
02:28:09,915 --> 02:28:13,595
Speaker 18:  aren't bullet journals. He was really inspired, for instance, by kind of

2536
02:28:13,595 --> 02:28:16,635
Speaker 18:  artists scrapbooks and, and sort of

2537
02:28:17,155 --> 02:28:21,035
Speaker 18:  collages and sketchbooks, which were sort of more

2538
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:24,845
Speaker 18:  than sketchbooks, which had elements of diary in them. So not pure bullet

2539
02:28:24,845 --> 02:28:28,685
Speaker 18:  journal stuff, but stuff, which is a really interesting expression of

2540
02:28:28,795 --> 02:28:32,445
Speaker 18:  your experience. And, and Ryder definitely put me onto those things.

2541
02:28:33,345 --> 02:28:37,205
Speaker 5:  Why do you think that way of thinking about notebooking

2542
02:28:37,205 --> 02:28:40,885
Speaker 5:  and journaling and keeping track of your life lagged

2543
02:28:41,065 --> 02:28:44,965
Speaker 5:  so much? The business side of things, which a as

2544
02:28:44,985 --> 02:28:48,605
Speaker 5:  you chart in the book got really systematized and really

2545
02:28:49,365 --> 02:28:52,285
Speaker 5:  specific. And like we, we built capitalism on top of these things, right?

2546
02:28:52,285 --> 02:28:56,005
Speaker 5:  Like double entry accounting became a worldwide phenomenon and people

2547
02:28:56,005 --> 02:28:59,645
Speaker 5:  understood how to do it. And there were kind of accepted

2548
02:28:59,655 --> 02:29:03,085
Speaker 5:  rules on how to keep these kinds of notebooks. But in

2549
02:29:03,305 --> 02:29:06,645
Speaker 5:  people doing it in their own lives, like you said, there have been bits and

2550
02:29:06,645 --> 02:29:07,805
Speaker 5:  pieces of this over time, but

2551
02:29:09,845 --> 02:29:13,685
Speaker 5:  somebody like Ryder Carroll comes along hundreds of years later and really

2552
02:29:13,685 --> 02:29:17,445
Speaker 5:  thinks like, okay, how can I break this thing down into sort of

2553
02:29:17,445 --> 02:29:21,325
Speaker 5:  understandable, repeatable pieces that just happened much later? Why do you

2554
02:29:21,325 --> 02:29:21,645
Speaker 5:  think that is?

2555
02:29:22,705 --> 02:29:26,385
Speaker 18:  Honestly, I have no idea. There, there are que there are

2556
02:29:26,585 --> 02:29:29,465
Speaker 18:  questions you can't answer. I mean, the, the another big question, which

2557
02:29:29,505 --> 02:29:33,025
Speaker 18:  I just have no idea, is why did people start writing diaries?

2558
02:29:33,505 --> 02:29:37,305
Speaker 18:  Hmm. Or, or rather, why did they start writing diaries in

2559
02:29:37,415 --> 02:29:41,385
Speaker 18:  England in around the year 1570 when

2560
02:29:41,445 --> 02:29:44,905
Speaker 18:  they'd never done them anywhere else in the world before? I've looked really

2561
02:29:44,935 --> 02:29:48,505
Speaker 18:  hard at trying to find out what was so special about England at that time,

2562
02:29:48,755 --> 02:29:52,265
Speaker 18:  which made people start to keep a diary like you, were you an emotional

2563
02:29:52,315 --> 02:29:56,265
Speaker 18:  diary of how they felt about the day's events. I, I, sorry,

2564
02:29:56,485 --> 02:29:59,145
Speaker 18:  not very good podcast material. I'm making a baffled expression.

2565
02:30:00,125 --> 02:30:03,705
Speaker 18:  Listen to picture that. Yeah, I have no idea. And I think your,

2566
02:30:04,005 --> 02:30:07,145
Speaker 18:  my answer to your question is, it's a good question. I have no idea.

2567
02:30:07,655 --> 02:30:11,345
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's, I, I have, I have a theory and it's based on nothing,

2568
02:30:11,485 --> 02:30:14,305
Speaker 5:  but it's a theory and I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you my theory as a way of

2569
02:30:14,305 --> 02:30:16,865
Speaker 5:  asking you another question, which I also have about this. I'm here for it.

2570
02:30:17,825 --> 02:30:20,965
Speaker 5:  I think as, especially as

2571
02:30:21,825 --> 02:30:25,485
Speaker 5:  we became more enmeshed with digital tools,

2572
02:30:26,755 --> 02:30:30,205
Speaker 5:  life took on like a new level of informational chaos.

2573
02:30:30,735 --> 02:30:34,605
Speaker 5:  There is just more stuff coming at us now than there ever has

2574
02:30:34,605 --> 02:30:38,485
Speaker 5:  been. And that's true in our professional lives, but

2575
02:30:38,485 --> 02:30:42,045
Speaker 5:  it's also true in our personal lives. I think in a, in a new way

2576
02:30:43,545 --> 02:30:47,045
Speaker 5:  in the last, I don't know, several decades, that there's just more

2577
02:30:47,115 --> 02:30:50,725
Speaker 5:  happening around you and to you all the time.

2578
02:30:51,185 --> 02:30:54,885
Speaker 5:  And we're, we're still reckoning with that as people, right? This question

2579
02:30:54,885 --> 02:30:58,765
Speaker 5:  of like, we understand what is going on in the world in a way that we

2580
02:30:58,765 --> 02:31:02,285
Speaker 5:  are like evolutionarily not equipped to do, and what do we do with that?

2581
02:31:02,585 --> 02:31:06,045
Speaker 5:  All these really interesting questions. But I think one thing that I see

2582
02:31:06,145 --> 02:31:10,125
Speaker 5:  all the time is people crave systems. There there is this idea that

2583
02:31:10,425 --> 02:31:14,085
Speaker 5:  if I can just find a way to make this make sense,

2584
02:31:14,775 --> 02:31:18,005
Speaker 5:  everything will be better. Right? And I think, and you mentioned the, the

2585
02:31:18,005 --> 02:31:21,845
Speaker 5:  getting things done method in, in the book also. And I think that

2586
02:31:21,845 --> 02:31:24,685
Speaker 5:  speaks to the same thing where it's like, yeah, there is this swirling mass

2587
02:31:24,705 --> 02:31:28,685
Speaker 5:  of stuff in my life, and If you can just tell me where to put

2588
02:31:28,685 --> 02:31:32,445
Speaker 5:  it and how my brain will get quieter. And I think that's

2589
02:31:32,445 --> 02:31:36,085
Speaker 5:  meaningful to people. And, and again, i I, there there is a

2590
02:31:36,285 --> 02:31:40,165
Speaker 5:  definite sort of, we are people of our time and technology

2591
02:31:40,655 --> 02:31:44,205
Speaker 5:  thing that is all kind of swirling together there. But I feel like when I

2592
02:31:44,225 --> 02:31:48,165
Speaker 5:  see people who like really love bullet journal what it, what it says is like,

2593
02:31:48,385 --> 02:31:52,245
Speaker 5:  the world is insane and messy, but I have made this thing that

2594
02:31:52,245 --> 02:31:56,205
Speaker 5:  is like my world and it is beautiful and looks like me and it just

2595
02:31:56,205 --> 02:31:59,525
Speaker 5:  feels good. And it's why like, people get mad at all the bullet journalists

2596
02:31:59,525 --> 02:32:02,525
Speaker 5:  who are like spending all of their time organizing their pages and not time

2597
02:32:02,525 --> 02:32:06,005
Speaker 5:  getting stuff done. And it's like no, the the organizing the pages is actually

2598
02:32:06,005 --> 02:32:08,965
Speaker 5:  the point of the thing. Yeah. Yeah. As much as anything else, it's

2599
02:32:08,965 --> 02:32:10,005
Speaker 18:  Taking control, right?

2600
02:32:10,005 --> 02:32:13,565
Speaker 5:  Like making the notebook is the point. And I, I feel like that was one of

2601
02:32:13,565 --> 02:32:16,725
Speaker 5:  the things that just keeps coming up throughout history in your book is like

2602
02:32:16,725 --> 02:32:20,605
Speaker 5:  the act of making the thing is as much the point as anything else. Going

2603
02:32:20,605 --> 02:32:24,285
Speaker 5:  back and reviewing it is fine. Doing stuff with what you put in it is fine,

2604
02:32:24,625 --> 02:32:28,405
Speaker 5:  but the act of making the notebook in the first place is maybe the most

2605
02:32:28,405 --> 02:32:31,205
Speaker 5:  important part of the whole process. And I feel like there's so much of that

2606
02:32:31,205 --> 02:32:35,165
Speaker 5:  happening right now that yeah, we need structure around that more

2607
02:32:35,165 --> 02:32:36,765
Speaker 5:  than ever. Yeah. That's just a theory.

2608
02:32:37,345 --> 02:32:40,405
Speaker 18:  That's a and my answers to that is yes,

2609
02:32:41,465 --> 02:32:45,285
Speaker 18:  that's the short answer. Slightly, slightly more involved example, or

2610
02:32:45,385 --> 02:32:49,325
Speaker 18:  to sort of back up what you said. So I have a day job and I

2611
02:32:49,325 --> 02:32:53,205
Speaker 18:  do this, I write books and talk to

2612
02:32:53,205 --> 02:32:56,565
Speaker 18:  people about it. And so the level of

2613
02:32:56,825 --> 02:33:00,645
Speaker 18:  inputs into my life in terms of communication and things flying

2614
02:33:00,645 --> 02:33:04,605
Speaker 18:  at me from different directions. I've got two email addresses. I've

2615
02:33:04,605 --> 02:33:07,605
Speaker 18:  got the Instagram, I've got the Twitter, which I'm switching off shortly,

2616
02:33:07,665 --> 02:33:10,605
Speaker 18:  but I've got the, the Facebook, I've got

2617
02:33:12,085 --> 02:33:16,045
Speaker 18:  WhatsApp on the phone, et cetera, et cetera. It just goes on. And that's

2618
02:33:16,045 --> 02:33:19,365
Speaker 18:  before I'm in a room with anyone actually talking to them face to face.

2619
02:33:19,945 --> 02:33:23,245
Speaker 18:  And my way of dealing with this is to write a diary. Yeah. So

2620
02:33:23,785 --> 02:33:26,965
Speaker 18:  at the end of the day, I will put it all down in here and,

2621
02:33:27,865 --> 02:33:31,605
Speaker 18:  and it's, it's under control as you say. And I've turned this

2622
02:33:32,715 --> 02:33:36,245
Speaker 18:  ephemeral nonstop flow of craziness,

2623
02:33:36,755 --> 02:33:40,245
Speaker 18:  most of which is completely trivial, but has to be managed somehow.

2624
02:33:41,225 --> 02:33:45,205
Speaker 18:  And I've just turned it into a calm thing on the page. Yeah, I

2625
02:33:45,205 --> 02:33:48,925
Speaker 18:  completely agree. And as to how that makes me feel, the analogy

2626
02:33:50,045 --> 02:33:53,805
Speaker 18:  I use is, it's like having a shower. Yeah.

2627
02:33:53,955 --> 02:33:57,685
Speaker 18:  Showers are lovely. Yeah. Just great. I like to have a shower every day,

2628
02:33:58,105 --> 02:34:01,285
Speaker 18:  but if I can't, if I have to go a day without, that's fine. No one really

2629
02:34:01,285 --> 02:34:05,125
Speaker 18:  minds two days without it's, you know,

2630
02:34:05,485 --> 02:34:09,245
Speaker 18:  mentally I start to smell. So, and that's what I'm like with the

2631
02:34:09,245 --> 02:34:12,245
Speaker 18:  diary, that's really good. Now I can miss a day. Yeah. I can't miss two

2632
02:34:12,245 --> 02:34:15,805
Speaker 18:  days. I start to smell mentally and, and it really cleans me out. Sort of

2633
02:34:15,805 --> 02:34:19,285
Speaker 18:  that process of just dumping it on the page really, really

2634
02:34:19,585 --> 02:34:21,885
Speaker 18:  is refreshing and cleansing in that sense. Yeah,

2635
02:34:22,125 --> 02:34:25,725
Speaker 5:  I like that a lot. Why do you think we haven't found a way to do

2636
02:34:26,715 --> 02:34:30,405
Speaker 5:  that digitally in the way that is satisfying and

2637
02:34:31,005 --> 02:34:34,725
Speaker 5:  valuable in the same way that we have in notebooks? Because

2638
02:34:35,005 --> 02:34:38,685
Speaker 5:  like, we pretty much do business on computers now there,

2639
02:34:38,685 --> 02:34:42,645
Speaker 5:  there's not a lot of paper notebooks out there responsible

2640
02:34:42,645 --> 02:34:46,405
Speaker 5:  for how capitalism runs anymore. Yeah. But I think I, I am

2641
02:34:46,405 --> 02:34:50,165
Speaker 5:  someone who has tried every note-taking app on planet

2642
02:34:50,165 --> 02:34:53,565
Speaker 5:  Earth. I I obsessively use them. I build these systems

2643
02:34:54,705 --> 02:34:58,605
Speaker 5:  and overwhelmingly the ones that feel the best. And as I talk to people,

2644
02:34:59,145 --> 02:35:02,885
Speaker 5:  the answer is you try them all and you eventually just get a nice notebook

2645
02:35:02,885 --> 02:35:05,925
Speaker 5:  and a pen and you start filling it. And there is, there is something about

2646
02:35:05,925 --> 02:35:09,285
Speaker 5:  that that we have not replaced. And I'm curious If you have thoughts on why

2647
02:35:09,285 --> 02:35:10,845
Speaker 5:  it has been so hard to replace.

2648
02:35:11,835 --> 02:35:15,115
Speaker 18:  I have lots of thoughts. I'm gonna give you the deepest one because please.

2649
02:35:15,315 --> 02:35:18,555
Speaker 18:  I think this is, I think your listener can cope with a, a sort of high level

2650
02:35:19,455 --> 02:35:23,355
Speaker 18:  bit of neurobiology. So when you write on

2651
02:35:23,355 --> 02:35:27,195
Speaker 18:  a notebook page, and they've done this with MRI scans and the

2652
02:35:27,195 --> 02:35:30,675
Speaker 18:  very clever way of using multiple manner I scans called voxel based

2653
02:35:30,855 --> 02:35:34,555
Speaker 18:  morpho. When you can look at multiple brains at once, when you write in

2654
02:35:34,555 --> 02:35:38,435
Speaker 18:  a notebook, you use different parts of the brain to when

2655
02:35:38,435 --> 02:35:42,235
Speaker 18:  you type or when you write something on your phone or your tablet.

2656
02:35:42,775 --> 02:35:46,315
Speaker 18:  And one of the different parts you use is the hippocampus. Now this is

2657
02:35:46,445 --> 02:35:50,315
Speaker 18:  right in the bottom of the brain and it's your mental map. So when

2658
02:35:50,535 --> 02:35:54,475
Speaker 18:  you drive to your place of work, you are using

2659
02:35:54,475 --> 02:35:58,395
Speaker 18:  your hippocampus. When you know where the coffee

2660
02:35:58,505 --> 02:36:02,355
Speaker 18:  cups are in your kitchen, you are using the hippocampus. Taxi drivers, cab

2661
02:36:02,355 --> 02:36:06,155
Speaker 18:  drivers have amazingly well developed. Hippocampus was

2662
02:36:06,535 --> 02:36:10,315
Speaker 18:  an early case study in brain plasticity actually. Right.

2663
02:36:10,495 --> 02:36:14,315
Speaker 18:  So this is very interesting. Why do you engage your hippocampus when you're

2664
02:36:14,315 --> 02:36:17,995
Speaker 18:  writing in a notebook? And it's because your notebook is a place,

2665
02:36:18,805 --> 02:36:21,715
Speaker 18:  right? And it has its own geography. So when you write things on the pages

2666
02:36:21,715 --> 02:36:24,275
Speaker 18:  of a notebook, you remember, or I certainly tend to remember, oh, that was

2667
02:36:24,275 --> 02:36:28,075
Speaker 18:  on the left hand side at the top. Oh, that was I, I wrote that in blue somewhere.

2668
02:36:28,075 --> 02:36:31,835
Speaker 18:  Now that was at the back of the notebook that was at the front. And I'm

2669
02:36:31,835 --> 02:36:35,595
Speaker 18:  thinking about the notebook in quite a different way to how I think about

2670
02:36:35,635 --> 02:36:39,555
Speaker 18:  a digital note and what they think the people who research this

2671
02:36:40,255 --> 02:36:44,155
Speaker 18:  is that when you scroll or you carry on writing and what you've written

2672
02:36:44,295 --> 02:36:48,275
Speaker 18:  on a screen just scrolls up, up, up top of the page and vanishes off

2673
02:36:48,275 --> 02:36:49,035
Speaker 18:  the top of your screen.

2674
02:36:50,575 --> 02:36:54,555
Speaker 18:  It just vanishes. It has no place in the geography of your lived

2675
02:36:54,555 --> 02:36:58,435
Speaker 18:  experience, unlike stuff which you write down in a notebook page. So I've

2676
02:36:58,435 --> 02:37:01,195
Speaker 18:  got my yellow notebook and I know that if I open it halfway through, roughly

2677
02:37:01,515 --> 02:37:05,195
Speaker 18:  speaking, I'm gonna find what happened in July. And I can't do that

2678
02:37:05,745 --> 02:37:09,555
Speaker 18:  with notes I've made on an iPad, but just because my

2679
02:37:09,555 --> 02:37:12,715
Speaker 18:  brain hasn't thought about them in that geographic way. So that's one reason

2680
02:37:13,375 --> 02:37:17,245
Speaker 18:  why you feel more comfortable and you navigate those notes

2681
02:37:17,275 --> 02:37:19,925
Speaker 18:  more happily than you do when they're digital.

2682
02:37:21,255 --> 02:37:24,885
Speaker 18:  Other reasons are to do with I think the sort of the sensory experience

2683
02:37:24,885 --> 02:37:28,765
Speaker 18:  of writing fingers on the page, the pen in your hand being a slightly richer

2684
02:37:28,765 --> 02:37:32,685
Speaker 18:  experience. It's more difficult as well, it's very easy to type. You

2685
02:37:32,685 --> 02:37:36,645
Speaker 18:  can type, you could roughly speaking type everything I

2686
02:37:36,645 --> 02:37:40,565
Speaker 18:  said to you right now, you'd get it all pretty much down. You can't

2687
02:37:40,565 --> 02:37:44,365
Speaker 18:  do that with the pen and ink. You have to filter, you have to pause the

2688
02:37:44,365 --> 02:37:48,285
Speaker 18:  ideas, you have to process them and paraphrase. And that gives

2689
02:37:48,285 --> 02:37:52,165
Speaker 18:  you a much richer, deeper understanding of what you

2690
02:37:52,165 --> 02:37:56,085
Speaker 18:  are actually listening to. You can type whatever

2691
02:37:56,165 --> 02:37:59,925
Speaker 18:  I say without actually listening to what I'm saying at all, but to write

2692
02:37:59,925 --> 02:38:03,325
Speaker 18:  it down, you have to paraphrase it and therefore you have to actually interact

2693
02:38:03,325 --> 02:38:07,085
Speaker 18:  with the ideas. So this is why teachers and academics much

2694
02:38:07,145 --> 02:38:10,765
Speaker 18:  prefer their students to, to write notes rather than to type them.

2695
02:38:11,305 --> 02:38:12,365
Speaker 18:  So there's a couple of answers.

2696
02:38:12,665 --> 02:38:16,085
Speaker 5:  Do you think there's a marriage there that we can make work? I mean, I keep

2697
02:38:16,085 --> 02:38:19,365
Speaker 5:  thinking about you, you start the book with moleskin, which is probably

2698
02:38:20,225 --> 02:38:23,325
Speaker 5:  the first notebook most people think of when they think of notebooks. And

2699
02:38:23,965 --> 02:38:27,445
Speaker 5:  moleskin for years has been building digital tools

2700
02:38:28,065 --> 02:38:31,485
Speaker 5:  and they have, they have a really beautiful calendar app. They have a really

2701
02:38:31,765 --> 02:38:35,605
Speaker 5:  interesting journaling system. Like it's, it's all very good. Nobody

2702
02:38:35,655 --> 02:38:39,085
Speaker 5:  cares about it the way that they care about physical moleskin notebooks.

2703
02:38:40,305 --> 02:38:43,725
Speaker 5:  And you know, there, there was this phase for a long time of like, maybe

2704
02:38:43,725 --> 02:38:47,565
Speaker 5:  we're gonna do smart pens where I'll write in a notebook,

2705
02:38:47,705 --> 02:38:50,765
Speaker 5:  but it will transcribe it digitally. And now there are things where like,

2706
02:38:50,765 --> 02:38:54,085
Speaker 5:  okay, you can write with a pen, but it's on your iPad and it will recognize

2707
02:38:54,085 --> 02:38:57,325
Speaker 5:  the text and make something out of it. And it feels like we're, we're poking

2708
02:38:57,325 --> 02:39:00,725
Speaker 5:  at this thing where the, the act that you're describing, I think is

2709
02:39:01,365 --> 02:39:04,245
Speaker 5:  absolutely the best one. But having a notebook

2710
02:39:05,075 --> 02:39:08,565
Speaker 5:  that is a bunch of words on a page that sits on

2711
02:39:08,865 --> 02:39:12,165
Speaker 5:  my bookshelf waiting for me to do something with it

2712
02:39:13,215 --> 02:39:16,445
Speaker 5:  feels like it's missing something. Like there is a best of both worlds here

2713
02:39:16,445 --> 02:39:20,205
Speaker 5:  that I think I desperately want to exist. And I don't know, maybe,

2714
02:39:20,205 --> 02:39:23,285
Speaker 5:  Maybe it just doesn't and can't and won't. But I am curious, like, do you,

2715
02:39:23,505 --> 02:39:25,285
Speaker 5:  do you think we can marry those two things?

2716
02:39:28,065 --> 02:39:31,925
Speaker 18:  I'm not gonna say never. Okay. But I've not seen it done yet in a way which

2717
02:39:32,205 --> 02:39:36,005
Speaker 18:  I think some people that sort of the moleskin magic paper, the

2718
02:39:36,005 --> 02:39:39,445
Speaker 18:  dotted paper, whatever, they, they make it work for them and, and good luck

2719
02:39:39,445 --> 02:39:43,045
Speaker 18:  and that's great. And some people also manage to make those

2720
02:39:43,235 --> 02:39:47,125
Speaker 18:  kind of posh tablets, the, the remarkable tablets work

2721
02:39:47,225 --> 02:39:49,885
Speaker 18:  in in a similar way. And again, go you

2722
02:39:50,735 --> 02:39:52,765
Speaker 18:  personally, I haven't ever managed to.

2723
02:39:53,235 --> 02:39:57,005
Speaker 5:  Okay. Last thing and then I will truly let you go. Tell me

2724
02:39:57,005 --> 02:40:00,725
Speaker 5:  just briefly about Moleskin and why you, you start the book with

2725
02:40:00,725 --> 02:40:04,405
Speaker 5:  moleskin. I wanna end our podcast with moleskin. Why is

2726
02:40:04,405 --> 02:40:07,885
Speaker 5:  moleskin so ascendant? What, what is it about

2727
02:40:08,115 --> 02:40:11,925
Speaker 5:  this company and this thing that has made Moleskin the

2728
02:40:11,935 --> 02:40:15,525
Speaker 5:  brand? The notebook, the thing in our sort of modern world,

2729
02:40:16,755 --> 02:40:20,685
Speaker 18:  It's the complete refinement she took, and I

2730
02:40:20,885 --> 02:40:24,645
Speaker 18:  I say she, Maria Seg Bondi, who was the woman who conceived

2731
02:40:24,705 --> 02:40:28,365
Speaker 18:  the, the moleskin notebook, who took the very simple basic notebook that

2732
02:40:28,365 --> 02:40:32,085
Speaker 18:  we knew she added to it. She added this little elastic

2733
02:40:32,175 --> 02:40:35,645
Speaker 18:  strap, the pocket in the back, the little page at the front saying, If you

2734
02:40:35,645 --> 02:40:39,365
Speaker 18:  find this notebook, please return it too. She added all of these things

2735
02:40:39,385 --> 02:40:43,205
Speaker 18:  to a very minimal product and she somehow made it seem even more

2736
02:40:43,205 --> 02:40:47,125
Speaker 18:  minimal. Mm. So, and the analogy

2737
02:40:47,245 --> 02:40:50,285
Speaker 18:  I make, she made, she made it minimal and she made it black. And that was

2738
02:40:50,285 --> 02:40:54,085
Speaker 18:  the most Italian thing you could do is like perol sunglasses, pr

2739
02:40:54,085 --> 02:40:57,925
Speaker 18:  little black dress, espresso, you know, that's what they do. They

2740
02:40:57,925 --> 02:41:01,805
Speaker 18:  make it minimal and black. And she did that and somehow she

2741
02:41:01,805 --> 02:41:05,685
Speaker 18:  just, she tricked us, If you like, she fooled us and thank God

2742
02:41:05,685 --> 02:41:07,885
Speaker 18:  that she did, I wouldn't have written this book if it wasn't for Moskin.

2743
02:41:07,925 --> 02:41:11,725
Speaker 18:  I think because she made us look again at this simple notebook and

2744
02:41:11,725 --> 02:41:15,365
Speaker 18:  think of it as something which had some material value, that had some material

2745
02:41:15,425 --> 02:41:19,405
Speaker 18:  beauty and was, could be therefore inspiring in a way

2746
02:41:19,595 --> 02:41:23,285
Speaker 18:  that your school exercise book couldn't be. Hmm. So she's, from that point

2747
02:41:23,285 --> 02:41:26,845
Speaker 18:  of view, she's my heroine creatively, she's also

2748
02:41:27,545 --> 02:41:31,525
Speaker 18:  for me a figure of awe because If you look at Moleskin's numbers, the company's

2749
02:41:31,525 --> 02:41:35,245
Speaker 18:  numbers through history, that company's profit margin

2750
02:41:35,705 --> 02:41:39,605
Speaker 18:  is ridiculous. It's like 43% profit every year, gross

2751
02:41:39,605 --> 02:41:43,405
Speaker 18:  profit. And it's a manufacturing company. No company does that, you know,

2752
02:41:43,985 --> 02:41:47,965
Speaker 18:  how did they do it? So I take my hat off to her and I can forget

2753
02:41:47,965 --> 02:41:51,525
Speaker 18:  quite easily about all of the ridiculous collaborations with

2754
02:41:51,805 --> 02:41:53,445
Speaker 18:  Evernote and Adobe and things like that.

2755
02:41:53,875 --> 02:41:55,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, listen, you gotta do some weird stuff

2756
02:41:55,525 --> 02:41:57,685
Speaker 18:  Because the, the key product is amazing. Yeah,

2757
02:41:57,755 --> 02:42:01,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well, and to that point, actually, one of the things you, you say kind

2758
02:42:01,365 --> 02:42:03,045
Speaker 5:  of as an aside in the book is that

2759
02:44:35,305 --> 02:44:38,105
Speaker 5:  lot of changes as the iPhone has gone through a lot of changes.

2760
02:45:22,665 --> 02:45:26,025
Speaker 5:  had a really fun conversation, NELI and I grabbed Ben and Sebastian

2761
02:45:26,645 --> 02:45:30,225
Speaker 5:  hashed all this out for a long time. Let's hear it. Excellent. All right.

2762
02:45:30,225 --> 02:45:32,025
Speaker 5:  And Neli Patel is also here. Hi Neli.

2763
02:45:32,505 --> 02:45:34,425
Speaker 21:  I think we should just get them to pronounce Hali

2764
02:45:34,775 --> 02:45:37,905
Speaker 5:  Over and over again. You, you just did the thing that I wanted to do first,

2765
02:45:37,905 --> 02:45:41,785
Speaker 5:  which is how in, how is it halide or is it hali? Can we, can we

2766
02:45:41,785 --> 02:45:45,465
Speaker 5:  solve this for people in the world right now? You just said Hali Ben, is

2767
02:45:45,465 --> 02:45:46,705
Speaker 5:  this the official correct answer?

2768
02:45:47,695 --> 02:45:51,615
Speaker 20:  I alternate because it's based on halogen, right? Oh God. And so

2769
02:45:51,615 --> 02:45:55,455
Speaker 20:  Silver Hali halogen, as long as it's not Haliday, which is a Middle Eastern

2770
02:45:55,455 --> 02:45:56,455
Speaker 20:  name. No,

2771
02:45:56,455 --> 02:45:57,735
Speaker 5:  That's what it is now. Well,

2772
02:45:57,735 --> 02:46:00,535
Speaker 21:  Yeah, sorry. There was, there was actually someone who worked at The Verge,

2773
02:46:00,845 --> 02:46:04,335
Speaker 21:  John Porter, I think he has moved on now, but he, he once PR pronounced

2774
02:46:04,335 --> 02:46:07,815
Speaker 21:  it on a podcast holiday and we sent him a Happy Holidays Christmas card

2775
02:46:07,875 --> 02:46:11,245
Speaker 21:  and we'll never let him live that down. We continue to do this every year

2776
02:46:11,315 --> 02:46:11,805
Speaker 21:  because

2777
02:46:11,805 --> 02:46:15,005
Speaker 22:  That's very good. It's so good. That's very good.

2778
02:46:15,245 --> 02:46:19,045
Speaker 21:  Haylight or highlight, depending on how, how fancy you feel. No, no.

2779
02:46:19,185 --> 02:46:22,525
Speaker 5:  You guys, this is the worst. We have to pick one. Let's do this right now

2780
02:46:22,525 --> 02:46:24,765
Speaker 5:  here on the verse cast, can we name your app please?

2781
02:46:25,155 --> 02:46:25,965
Speaker 22:  What is your name

2782
02:46:26,505 --> 02:46:30,485
Speaker 20:  On 3 1 2. Allied. Allied. Okay. There we go.

2783
02:46:30,505 --> 02:46:33,365
Speaker 20:  All right, good. And we did, I, I just wanna point out that like when we

2784
02:46:33,525 --> 02:46:34,125
Speaker 20:  released, I want

2785
02:46:34,125 --> 02:46:37,405
Speaker 22:  To point out that you super cheated in what instead say it first.

2786
02:46:37,765 --> 02:46:41,645
Speaker 20:  I, I I think he went on, he went on two. You never go on

2787
02:46:41,745 --> 02:46:41,965
Speaker 20:  two.

2788
02:46:43,215 --> 02:46:43,805
Speaker 22:  We're a very

2789
02:46:43,805 --> 02:46:46,045
Speaker 21:  Good team actually, when it comes down to it,

2790
02:46:46,405 --> 02:46:49,685
Speaker 20:  I, I just wanna close this discourse on names that we were like, when we're

2791
02:46:49,765 --> 02:46:53,645
Speaker 20:  building keynote, no one can mess up that name. And then it was featured

2792
02:46:53,645 --> 02:46:57,405
Speaker 20:  in the keynote from Apple and they told us we're having trouble

2793
02:46:57,405 --> 02:47:01,365
Speaker 20:  because it sounds a lot like Keynote. Ooh. And So I think every time

2794
02:47:01,365 --> 02:47:03,925
Speaker 20:  we build a new app, it just needs to challenge someone.

2795
02:47:04,605 --> 02:47:07,805
Speaker 21:  Well the best part was that I was like, it's actually pronounced kno. And

2796
02:47:07,805 --> 02:47:09,805
Speaker 21:  then they were like, really? And I was like, no,

2797
02:47:10,805 --> 02:47:14,685
Speaker 5:  Happy kno everybody. That's what we're doing now. Okay,

2798
02:47:14,685 --> 02:47:17,245
Speaker 5:  So I think we, we have a bunch of stuff to talk about and we, we should just,

2799
02:47:17,535 --> 02:47:20,725
Speaker 5:  we've been getting into our feelings on this podcast about what a photo is

2800
02:47:20,725 --> 02:47:24,205
Speaker 5:  for years now, and we have invited you two to essentially do the same thing

2801
02:47:24,205 --> 02:47:27,245
Speaker 5:  with us. But my first question as we get into this, and I wanna talk a lot

2802
02:47:27,245 --> 02:47:30,925
Speaker 5:  about Process Zero and a lot about what has changed with iPhone photography

2803
02:47:30,925 --> 02:47:34,205
Speaker 5:  in particular and all this stuff, but I am desperately curious like when,

2804
02:47:34,205 --> 02:47:37,925
Speaker 5:  when you guys started building a camera app many years ago at this point,

2805
02:47:39,185 --> 02:47:43,085
Speaker 5:  did you know at the time how big a like, philosophical

2806
02:47:43,605 --> 02:47:47,565
Speaker 5:  exercise it was to build a camera app? I think we, we think about it as like

2807
02:47:47,565 --> 02:47:51,405
Speaker 5:  you, you add a bunch of filters and buttons, but it's really like

2808
02:47:51,405 --> 02:47:54,845
Speaker 5:  you, you are making decisions about the universe when you build a camera

2809
02:47:54,905 --> 02:47:57,125
Speaker 5:  app in a way that I think people are only coming around to. Did you know

2810
02:47:57,125 --> 02:47:59,805
Speaker 5:  this all those years ago when you started working on, on Haled?

2811
02:48:00,305 --> 02:48:04,205
Speaker 20:  So I guess like the origin story, I think like the

2812
02:48:04,205 --> 02:48:07,645
Speaker 20:  first, the first code commit for a hali was 2014

2813
02:48:08,145 --> 02:48:09,285
Speaker 20:  for about like day, it's pronounced

2814
02:48:09,285 --> 02:48:09,685
Speaker 5:  Day actually

2815
02:48:09,685 --> 02:48:12,525
Speaker 20:  Hall, I don't, I'm gonna switch three times over. Oh my god.

2816
02:48:12,785 --> 02:48:13,005
Speaker 22:  It

2817
02:48:13,005 --> 02:48:13,925
Speaker 5:  Was all over the place.

2818
02:48:14,625 --> 02:48:18,565
Speaker 20:  So for Halladay in 2014 it was like

2819
02:48:18,935 --> 02:48:22,645
Speaker 20:  three lines of code and then put away until like 2016.

2820
02:48:23,185 --> 02:48:26,605
Speaker 20:  And so I'd say that in 2016 none of this computational

2821
02:48:26,635 --> 02:48:30,365
Speaker 20:  photography was happening. It was to,

2822
02:48:30,425 --> 02:48:34,285
Speaker 20:  to put it simply, a lot of these apps were just wrappers around the, the,

2823
02:48:34,285 --> 02:48:38,125
Speaker 20:  the APIs that Apple gave you and it was just a more pretty veneer. And

2824
02:48:38,125 --> 02:48:41,405
Speaker 20:  so what we were doing at the time was, and then I connected with Sebastian

2825
02:48:41,405 --> 02:48:45,285
Speaker 20:  in 2016, like we were adding value like focus

2826
02:48:45,395 --> 02:48:48,605
Speaker 20:  peaking so that you could actually tell what was in focus. You could dial

2827
02:48:48,605 --> 02:48:52,245
Speaker 20:  in manual values, but for the most part until Apple released

2828
02:48:52,385 --> 02:48:55,805
Speaker 20:  raw that up there about it, it it was that you had

2829
02:48:56,225 --> 02:48:58,285
Speaker 20:  no real say on how the final image would look.

2830
02:48:59,025 --> 02:49:02,525
Speaker 21:  And what's interesting is, I think when it came out, so highlight is, is

2831
02:49:02,525 --> 02:49:06,245
Speaker 21:  now seven years old. It's, it, it came out in 2017,

2832
02:49:06,625 --> 02:49:10,325
Speaker 21:  that's exactly when the iPhone 10 launched that year. And with the iPhone

2833
02:49:10,345 --> 02:49:13,565
Speaker 21:  10, I think Apple started using the word smart HDR for the first time and

2834
02:49:13,565 --> 02:49:16,085
Speaker 21:  they kind of, they started using that very famous slide where it take one

2835
02:49:16,085 --> 02:49:18,965
Speaker 21:  photo and they kind of onion slice it into like 12 of them and it to try

2836
02:49:18,965 --> 02:49:21,445
Speaker 21:  to show you like, oh look, we look, we do a lot of stuff and there's a lot

2837
02:49:21,445 --> 02:49:25,365
Speaker 21:  of smart things happening here. And I think that was, you know, around the

2838
02:49:25,365 --> 02:49:27,845
Speaker 21:  same end that the pixel started, you know, talking, the Pixel team started

2839
02:49:27,845 --> 02:49:31,405
Speaker 21:  talking about like the Italian renaissance and how we can use science to

2840
02:49:31,405 --> 02:49:34,005
Speaker 21:  influence things. It was, it was a very early time where people were trying

2841
02:49:34,005 --> 02:49:37,005
Speaker 21:  to figure out like how do we get better images out of these tiny sensors?

2842
02:49:37,005 --> 02:49:39,445
Speaker 21:  And that's when everything exploded with like night mode and all those kind

2843
02:49:39,445 --> 02:49:43,245
Speaker 21:  of things when it basically turned photography from just

2844
02:49:43,245 --> 02:49:47,005
Speaker 21:  taking a snap to like a data science and it was like, okay, no,

2845
02:49:47,065 --> 02:49:50,205
Speaker 21:  if we actually just use these processors and like do a crazy amount of computation

2846
02:49:50,205 --> 02:49:54,165
Speaker 21:  on it, we can fundamentally alter the output and we

2847
02:49:54,165 --> 02:49:57,365
Speaker 21:  can just, we can beat physics, we can just cheat it. Like we can do zaps

2848
02:49:57,365 --> 02:49:59,445
Speaker 21:  of field, we can all these things that big cameras can because have giant

2849
02:49:59,445 --> 02:50:02,765
Speaker 21:  lenses and giant sensors we can shoot at night and we can totally take photos

2850
02:50:02,765 --> 02:50:06,485
Speaker 21:  with like bouquet. It's not real, but nobody cares because you're still

2851
02:50:06,485 --> 02:50:08,565
Speaker 21:  taking a photo at night, you're still taking a photo with what looks like

2852
02:50:08,565 --> 02:50:12,445
Speaker 21:  a shallow depth of field. And so we were kind of emerging

2853
02:50:12,465 --> 02:50:14,485
Speaker 21:  at the same time as that all emerging. So,

2854
02:50:14,485 --> 02:50:18,325
Speaker 5:  And and how much control over that stuff do you get? Like do you look at

2855
02:50:18,325 --> 02:50:21,085
Speaker 5:  that in those early days as like, oh my God, look at this incredible toolkit,

2856
02:50:21,385 --> 02:50:25,165
Speaker 5:  we suddenly have to play with all of the, the light that this thing is

2857
02:50:25,165 --> 02:50:27,645
Speaker 5:  capturing instead of just doing like a thing at the end of the pipeline?

2858
02:50:27,985 --> 02:50:31,725
Speaker 5:  Or is it like, oh, this is barely photography anymore.

2859
02:50:32,595 --> 02:50:35,085
Speaker 5:  What, what, how do we deal with this? Like what, how do you look at that

2860
02:50:35,085 --> 02:50:37,005
Speaker 5:  when those tools start to come available? I,

2861
02:50:37,065 --> 02:50:40,885
Speaker 20:  I'd say like around 2020 is when things started to converge of where

2862
02:50:40,885 --> 02:50:44,845
Speaker 20:  things were getting a lot smarter. Also, we had like this existential question

2863
02:50:44,845 --> 02:50:48,245
Speaker 20:  of why should our app exist when the first party camera's getting so much

2864
02:50:48,245 --> 02:50:51,805
Speaker 20:  better? And fortunately both Sebastian and I were already shooting raw

2865
02:50:51,835 --> 02:50:55,765
Speaker 20:  photography, which in a nutshell means that you're capturing the

2866
02:50:55,765 --> 02:50:59,565
Speaker 20:  sensor data as a file and then you can bring it into a third party app like

2867
02:50:59,565 --> 02:51:03,085
Speaker 20:  Lightroom and you can make different decisions on how you wanna process

2868
02:51:03,185 --> 02:51:06,885
Speaker 20:  the final image. And so around 2020 was like, we were starting to see like,

2869
02:51:06,885 --> 02:51:10,685
Speaker 20:  wait a minute, like what Apple's doing is great, you tap a button and anyone

2870
02:51:10,685 --> 02:51:13,925
Speaker 20:  can get a good photo. Like my parents who don't know anything about photography

2871
02:51:13,945 --> 02:51:17,485
Speaker 20:  tap a button and they got a photo of their grandchild, right? But If you

2872
02:51:17,485 --> 02:51:21,205
Speaker 20:  looked at the underlying sensor, apple's kind of underselling like

2873
02:51:21,505 --> 02:51:24,885
Speaker 20:  how much better the hardware was getting and then over time the sensors

2874
02:51:24,885 --> 02:51:28,205
Speaker 20:  were getting bigger and better, the optics were getting better. And so that's

2875
02:51:28,205 --> 02:51:30,605
Speaker 20:  when we started being like, wait a minute, like how can we build a feature

2876
02:51:30,605 --> 02:51:32,165
Speaker 20:  around this where it stands on its own?

2877
02:51:32,825 --> 02:51:36,805
Speaker 22:  One of the questions I have about RAW is what it

2878
02:51:36,805 --> 02:51:37,925
Speaker 22:  has come to signify

2879
02:51:38,235 --> 02:51:39,925
Speaker 21:  What is a raw photo? Yeah,

2880
02:51:40,235 --> 02:51:43,925
Speaker 22:  Yeah, exactly. Not, not quite that, but

2881
02:51:44,385 --> 02:51:48,285
Speaker 22:  people are like, I don't like my iPhone 15 camera or I don't like my iPhone

2882
02:51:48,525 --> 02:51:52,245
Speaker 22:  14 camera. And then you see in the comments on social media,

2883
02:51:52,385 --> 02:51:56,245
Speaker 22:  people say, oh you should shoot raw. And my reaction to that is

2884
02:51:56,245 --> 02:52:00,125
Speaker 22:  like, that is, that's a horrible suggestion, but all

2885
02:52:00,125 --> 02:52:03,325
Speaker 22:  it really, because you're gonna get this giant file and you actually have

2886
02:52:03,325 --> 02:52:06,845
Speaker 22:  to process it to a look. But what it really means is,

2887
02:52:07,225 --> 02:52:11,045
Speaker 22:  oh, there's a way to turn off this processing, right? Even inside of apple's

2888
02:52:11,045 --> 02:52:14,965
Speaker 22:  like pro raw system, you're gonna generate a file that

2889
02:52:15,315 --> 02:52:19,245
Speaker 22:  lets you turn off this ultra HDR look. And that just

2890
02:52:19,245 --> 02:52:22,005
Speaker 22:  means something to people. And the fact that the word is raw I think is

2891
02:52:22,465 --> 02:52:26,405
Speaker 22:  deeply fascinating. Like the word and what it means and what

2892
02:52:26,405 --> 02:52:30,325
Speaker 22:  you get are all kind of wrapped up in a mess. But you guys are

2893
02:52:30,325 --> 02:52:34,085
Speaker 22:  describing like, we're gonna take the sensor data and start

2894
02:52:34,085 --> 02:52:35,605
Speaker 22:  making different kinds of images with it.

2895
02:52:35,885 --> 02:52:38,925
Speaker 20:  I, I think we make an effort to say native raw versus pro raw because what

2896
02:52:38,925 --> 02:52:42,685
Speaker 20:  Apple calls raw in pro raw is not technically

2897
02:52:42,745 --> 02:52:46,525
Speaker 20:  raw. And If you read the comments on a photography website like a pet

2898
02:52:46,585 --> 02:52:50,285
Speaker 20:  aix, I'm sorry, but it'll be just constantly

2899
02:52:50,355 --> 02:52:53,645
Speaker 20:  that guy being like, you know, it's not really raw and like, yeah, yeah.

2900
02:52:53,675 --> 02:52:54,605
Speaker 20:  Cool. Awesome. Wait,

2901
02:52:54,605 --> 02:52:56,805
Speaker 22:  Explain the difference for people who, who aren't as deep in the weeds as

2902
02:52:56,805 --> 02:53:00,525
Speaker 22:  we are. What is, what is Apple's version of pro rah? What is your definition

2903
02:53:00,525 --> 02:53:00,845
Speaker 22:  of native

2904
02:53:00,865 --> 02:53:04,125
Speaker 20:  Raw? So technically raw is you have these

2905
02:53:04,395 --> 02:53:08,245
Speaker 20:  sensors that have voltage values from light converted to,

2906
02:53:08,505 --> 02:53:12,125
Speaker 20:  you know, these numbers, right? And then that's it. And then you need to

2907
02:53:12,125 --> 02:53:16,045
Speaker 20:  run an algorithm to take on the sensor. There's this Bayer filter which

2908
02:53:16,045 --> 02:53:19,845
Speaker 20:  are discreet red, green and blue values. So it needs to kind of mush

2909
02:53:19,965 --> 02:53:23,885
Speaker 20:  'em up in a blender. And it's all like, it's like basically like If you

2910
02:53:23,885 --> 02:53:27,605
Speaker 20:  were to buy the ingredients of making a cake and then the

2911
02:53:27,715 --> 02:53:31,685
Speaker 20:  jpeg is the final cake, well I guess pro raw

2912
02:53:31,685 --> 02:53:35,525
Speaker 20:  is kinda like a half baked cake. Like, like you get to pick the frosting

2913
02:53:36,325 --> 02:53:40,245
Speaker 20:  If you, If you like sprinkles whatever, raisins, I hate you.

2914
02:53:40,865 --> 02:53:44,405
Speaker 20:  But pro raw is Apple solution to what you're just talking about where it

2915
02:53:44,405 --> 02:53:48,325
Speaker 20:  felt like you needed a PhD, an image processing to take one of these native

2916
02:53:48,395 --> 02:53:52,045
Speaker 20:  raws and make them approximate anything that Apple has. And that's partly

2917
02:53:52,045 --> 02:53:55,365
Speaker 20:  because Apple, when they take a photo, they're actually taking a burst of

2918
02:53:55,435 --> 02:53:59,205
Speaker 20:  nine photos and then merging them together. So the concept of having any

2919
02:53:59,205 --> 02:54:02,685
Speaker 20:  of these Bayer underlying values just doesn't exist

2920
02:54:02,715 --> 02:54:06,525
Speaker 20:  anymore because it's all gonna be squashed together to create smart HDR

2921
02:54:06,705 --> 02:54:10,565
Speaker 20:  to reduce noise and do all these effects. I really wish Apple hadn't said

2922
02:54:10,585 --> 02:54:14,325
Speaker 20:  pro raw because it's, it's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life explaining

2923
02:54:14,325 --> 02:54:18,205
Speaker 20:  this to people. But it's like kind of halfway between the native raw

2924
02:54:18,205 --> 02:54:19,205
Speaker 20:  and the final jpeg.

2925
02:54:19,705 --> 02:54:22,045
Speaker 21:  And I think what is a really important thing to say there? 'cause I see

2926
02:54:22,405 --> 02:54:26,195
Speaker 21:  a lot of people saying something like, oh, like

2927
02:54:26,505 --> 02:54:29,595
Speaker 21:  this is just the same. Like If you just take a raw photo, that that in itself

2928
02:54:29,595 --> 02:54:33,435
Speaker 21:  is a really fascinating turn of phrase because If you say a raw

2929
02:54:33,435 --> 02:54:37,275
Speaker 21:  photo, a raw file technically is not a photo yet. So what, what Ben

2930
02:54:37,275 --> 02:54:40,955
Speaker 21:  said, you know, it's like you got this sensor data, red green two, green

2931
02:54:41,015 --> 02:54:44,995
Speaker 21:  two to one blue, one red subpixels to make up the pixels. All

2932
02:54:44,995 --> 02:54:47,435
Speaker 21:  that data needs to be combined. You can think of it as kind of a giant spreadsheet.

2933
02:54:47,435 --> 02:54:49,875
Speaker 21:  There's just like has all these values of what the sensor caught in that

2934
02:54:49,875 --> 02:54:53,635
Speaker 21:  moment in time from one photo, one important, one photo.

2935
02:54:54,895 --> 02:54:58,735
Speaker 21:  And that's not a picture like you have to process

2936
02:54:59,095 --> 02:55:03,055
Speaker 21:  a native raw file to get the photo out of it. So per definition,

2937
02:55:03,575 --> 02:55:06,485
Speaker 21:  arael has to be processed for it to be displayed on a screen. It actually

2938
02:55:06,485 --> 02:55:09,525
Speaker 21:  has too much information to even be displayed on a screen. And so a pro

2939
02:55:10,015 --> 02:55:13,565
Speaker 21:  profi is, is essentially already done that step. It has created an image

2940
02:55:13,565 --> 02:55:17,005
Speaker 21:  because a lot of the processing that happens on iPhone images requires it

2941
02:55:17,005 --> 02:55:20,565
Speaker 21:  to become an rrg B image, a bitmap essentially. And so it's a very deep

2942
02:55:20,655 --> 02:55:24,165
Speaker 21:  image with separate information for stuff like what Neela mentioned, like

2943
02:55:24,165 --> 02:55:27,005
Speaker 21:  the tone mapping, which you now have the tone control for, for iPhone 16

2944
02:55:27,265 --> 02:55:31,245
Speaker 21:  that's separately stored in the profile gain table. So you can now adjust

2945
02:55:31,245 --> 02:55:34,085
Speaker 21:  just how much that HDR effect is. You can adjust the white balance completely,

2946
02:55:34,145 --> 02:55:36,805
Speaker 21:  you can adjust the amount of sharpening. Noise reduction is something that

2947
02:55:36,805 --> 02:55:40,645
Speaker 21:  is baked in per se, and not just because Apple thinks

2948
02:55:40,775 --> 02:55:43,765
Speaker 21:  noise shouldn't exist, like notably native raw files have a lot of noise

2949
02:55:43,765 --> 02:55:46,285
Speaker 21:  because you have a tiny sensor, you can have a lot of noise, but If you

2950
02:55:46,285 --> 02:55:49,325
Speaker 21:  combine images you can think of it If you perfectly combine the same image,

2951
02:55:49,415 --> 02:55:52,845
Speaker 21:  noise is different for every frame. So you're gonna average out the noise

2952
02:55:52,865 --> 02:55:54,445
Speaker 21:  no matter what you do. If you're combining images

2953
02:55:55,025 --> 02:55:58,205
Speaker 20:  Behind the scenes, like when we're talking about raws, we've been trying

2954
02:55:58,365 --> 02:56:02,205
Speaker 20:  to call them digital negatives, which I

2955
02:56:02,205 --> 02:56:05,205
Speaker 20:  don't know if that's any better for casual users, but it's the same concept

2956
02:56:05,265 --> 02:56:09,005
Speaker 20:  of when you had film photography you would have a negative, but then a lot

2957
02:56:09,005 --> 02:56:12,565
Speaker 20:  of the work of great photographers would be during the development

2958
02:56:13,085 --> 02:56:16,605
Speaker 20:  where you would take the negative and print it on paper, you would dodge

2959
02:56:16,625 --> 02:56:20,365
Speaker 20:  and burn it to recover the dynamic range, which is now an algorithm that

2960
02:56:20,365 --> 02:56:23,645
Speaker 20:  Apple does for you. But like there's really cool videos of like Ansel Adams

2961
02:56:23,645 --> 02:56:27,365
Speaker 20:  with some of his majestic landscapes, he's kind of doing like analog

2962
02:56:27,365 --> 02:56:30,045
Speaker 20:  photoshopping where he is like, okay, I gotta bring back some of the sky

2963
02:56:30,045 --> 02:56:33,965
Speaker 20:  values and bump this part up. So this isn't particularly new,

2964
02:56:34,545 --> 02:56:38,445
Speaker 20:  but Apple gives you like, okay, you want it on or off or somewhere in between.

2965
02:56:38,545 --> 02:56:41,605
Speaker 20:  That's all right. You can have any color as long as it's black, like Yeah.

2966
02:56:41,835 --> 02:56:44,285
Speaker 21:  Well I was just gonna say, it's, it's just fascinating to me that a lot

2967
02:56:44,285 --> 02:56:47,845
Speaker 21:  of people say, I see all the processing that's happening and and maybe sometimes

2968
02:56:47,845 --> 02:56:49,965
Speaker 21:  don't even have a word for it. Like that's kinda like what you're alluding

2969
02:56:49,965 --> 02:56:53,885
Speaker 21:  to. Neli is like people just like taking photos and, and then they

2970
02:56:53,885 --> 02:56:57,165
Speaker 21:  take a photo with Disney that's like prefer it even though it, it lacks

2971
02:56:57,165 --> 02:57:00,925
Speaker 21:  this absolute like, I mean literally the best teams in the world right now

2972
02:57:00,925 --> 02:57:03,725
Speaker 21:  in in photography are working at Google, are working at Samsung, are working

2973
02:57:03,745 --> 02:57:07,645
Speaker 21:  at Huawei, at Apple, like to make this processing to do all this

2974
02:57:07,645 --> 02:57:10,645
Speaker 21:  processing engineering and they work from the silicon up to do like insane

2975
02:57:10,645 --> 02:57:14,245
Speaker 21:  innovations and then people, because they're like, haha, I'll download an

2976
02:57:14,245 --> 02:57:17,565
Speaker 21:  app and skip all that and get what of sometimes is an objectively worse

2977
02:57:17,565 --> 02:57:20,525
Speaker 21:  image If you were to objectively judge image quality. But

2978
02:57:22,065 --> 02:57:26,045
Speaker 21:  we find that people, yeah, people just seem to have a

2979
02:57:26,315 --> 02:57:29,365
Speaker 21:  current preference for authenticity through imperfection, I think. And that

2980
02:57:29,365 --> 02:57:30,205
Speaker 21:  is really interesting.

2981
02:57:31,005 --> 02:57:33,645
Speaker 5:  I just keep coming back to this idea that like, and, and we've talked a bunch

2982
02:57:33,645 --> 02:57:37,325
Speaker 5:  about this on the show, that there is this increasingly pervasive feeling

2983
02:57:38,295 --> 02:57:42,165
Speaker 5:  among people that their iPhone camera in particular is bad. And,

2984
02:57:42,185 --> 02:57:45,965
Speaker 5:  and I think like to your point, the the on any objective

2985
02:57:45,965 --> 02:57:49,085
Speaker 5:  measure of quality, it, it gets better and better and better. And yet people

2986
02:57:49,085 --> 02:57:52,965
Speaker 5:  seem to like it less and less at the end. And

2987
02:57:52,965 --> 02:57:56,805
Speaker 5:  I like that disconnect is so fascinating to me because, and and it goes back

2988
02:57:56,805 --> 02:58:00,485
Speaker 5:  to what you were saying about like the, the iPhone has decided that noise

2989
02:58:00,545 --> 02:58:04,405
Speaker 5:  is bad period, right? Like it noise sucks, shadows

2990
02:58:04,875 --> 02:58:08,565
Speaker 5:  suck, they should not be allowed and we will get rid of them at all costs.

2991
02:58:08,785 --> 02:58:12,005
Speaker 5:  And I think like to your point about imperfections, like I think that's right

2992
02:58:12,005 --> 02:58:15,925
Speaker 5:  and I think everybody has sort of ideas about what older photos look

2993
02:58:15,925 --> 02:58:19,205
Speaker 5:  like and there is a thing where like photos can be too good, but I also think

2994
02:58:19,305 --> 02:58:23,045
Speaker 5:  as the hardware has gotten better, the software has gotten

2995
02:58:23,345 --> 02:58:27,085
Speaker 5:  vastly more opinionated about how a photo is supposed to look

2996
02:58:27,865 --> 02:58:30,485
Speaker 5:  in a way that just feels sort of incongruous, right? And, and like maybe

2997
02:58:30,485 --> 02:58:34,005
Speaker 5:  what's happening now is we're getting some of that choice back where it's

2998
02:58:34,005 --> 02:58:35,805
Speaker 5:  like, oh the hardware's really good, you can do a bunch of stuff with it.

2999
02:58:37,325 --> 02:58:41,255
Speaker 5:  Here are some options. And it seems like maybe that's what you,

3000
02:58:41,255 --> 02:58:43,815
Speaker 5:  you guys have even seen as developers is some of those tools are becoming

3001
02:58:43,815 --> 02:58:47,175
Speaker 5:  available to you to make available to other people and that actually that's

3002
02:58:47,175 --> 02:58:51,055
Speaker 5:  what people want now is some, some choice back with all this great hardware

3003
02:58:51,325 --> 02:58:53,815
Speaker 5:  instead of just wild new ideas about shadows.

3004
02:58:53,915 --> 02:58:57,495
Speaker 20:  So actually can I just dial back, I just said that

3005
02:58:57,495 --> 02:59:01,415
Speaker 20:  process zero is rebranded raw and I can already see a thousand comments

3006
02:59:01,515 --> 02:59:05,375
Speaker 20:  on Pet Aix and I thank you for pointing out haunted

3007
02:59:05,475 --> 02:59:06,535
Speaker 5:  By the comment section on

3008
02:59:06,535 --> 02:59:07,295
Speaker 21:  Pet Aix. That's

3009
02:59:07,295 --> 02:59:10,295
Speaker 20:  What I'm getting from you. Yeah, yeah, I know it's, I I think that it, you

3010
02:59:10,295 --> 02:59:13,535
Speaker 20:  know, but that's between me and my therapist. Now the, the, the thing

3011
02:59:14,645 --> 02:59:17,895
Speaker 20:  what the value add here is that we do have opinions about, you know, there's

3012
02:59:17,895 --> 02:59:21,095
Speaker 20:  a million different ways that we could develop the raw. And what I think

3013
02:59:21,095 --> 02:59:24,975
Speaker 20:  with Process Zero is we decided we like noise. I have a

3014
02:59:24,975 --> 02:59:28,495
Speaker 20:  friend who works in visual effects and he calls noise analog

3015
02:59:28,495 --> 02:59:32,135
Speaker 20:  dithering. And you can't remove noise without removing these

3016
02:59:32,135 --> 02:59:35,815
Speaker 20:  details because that's what the, what was captured at the time. We have

3017
02:59:35,815 --> 02:59:39,655
Speaker 20:  opinions on sharpening our images are a little softer by

3018
02:59:39,655 --> 02:59:43,295
Speaker 20:  design. And If you look at, you know, you look at analog

3019
02:59:43,295 --> 02:59:46,655
Speaker 20:  photography actually last summer before we really went all in on this, I

3020
02:59:46,655 --> 02:59:49,655
Speaker 20:  was shooting with a Cannon AE one on 35 millimeter film

3021
02:59:50,635 --> 02:59:54,615
Speaker 20:  and I was like, oh, it just feels so warm. Like it's, it's so flawed

3022
02:59:54,615 --> 02:59:58,455
Speaker 20:  but I love it the fact that you can't get this crazy HDR in there.

3023
02:59:58,835 --> 03:00:01,855
Speaker 20:  And I think the challenge is gonna be as we're building out more features

3024
03:00:01,915 --> 03:00:05,455
Speaker 20:  and we start, you know, adding the ability like in the future If you wanna

3025
03:00:05,455 --> 03:00:09,415
Speaker 20:  recover dynamic range, okay, at what point do we allow users to make fake

3026
03:00:09,415 --> 03:00:13,375
Speaker 20:  looking images, right? And it's something we'll have to face in the

3027
03:00:13,375 --> 03:00:13,575
Speaker 20:  future.

3028
03:00:14,075 --> 03:00:17,695
Speaker 5:  That's a big question. And at what point does something become fake looking

3029
03:00:18,075 --> 03:00:21,695
Speaker 5:  is like back to big philosophical existential questions about photos. Like

3030
03:00:21,825 --> 03:00:24,695
Speaker 5:  where to draw that line is super messy.

3031
03:00:25,295 --> 03:00:28,015
Speaker 21:  I think one of the things that you're touching on that well too is like

3032
03:00:29,115 --> 03:00:32,615
Speaker 21:  at some point these cameras all started looking very similar, right? So

3033
03:00:32,615 --> 03:00:35,335
Speaker 21:  you get your photo out of Samsung phone of the Pixel outta the iPhone, they

3034
03:00:35,335 --> 03:00:39,055
Speaker 21:  all look like they boost the shadows way up and there there

3035
03:00:39,055 --> 03:00:42,495
Speaker 21:  could not be any reduction or clipping of dynamic range that is just considered

3036
03:00:42,495 --> 03:00:45,135
Speaker 21:  data loss. We cannot have any noise. We've all agreed on that. And I think

3037
03:00:45,135 --> 03:00:48,295
Speaker 21:  what the, that's simply the result of making a camera for the greatest common

3038
03:00:48,295 --> 03:00:50,975
Speaker 21:  denominator. Like this is a camera that needs to work for everyone. I think

3039
03:00:50,975 --> 03:00:54,175
Speaker 21:  at some point someone was mentioning like, oh I use my camera for like reading

3040
03:00:54,175 --> 03:00:56,695
Speaker 21:  like a serial number on the bottom of like a car or something, right? Like

3041
03:00:56,695 --> 03:00:59,405
Speaker 21:  at that point, like If you don't, If you get an artistic photo that just

3042
03:00:59,405 --> 03:01:03,045
Speaker 21:  has like really nice chicora rendering that's really cool for you, but like

3043
03:01:03,045 --> 03:01:06,565
Speaker 21:  this camera literally doesn't work for me anymore. And so that's a really,

3044
03:01:06,565 --> 03:01:10,525
Speaker 21:  really difficult position to be in. I often tell people like, wow, I, I

3045
03:01:10,525 --> 03:01:13,565
Speaker 21:  would, on the one side, it's a fascinating job to design the camera at Apple,

3046
03:01:13,565 --> 03:01:15,845
Speaker 21:  but at the same time I have to make a camera that works for my one and a

3047
03:01:15,845 --> 03:01:19,405
Speaker 21:  half year old daughter and like my 80-year-old father and

3048
03:01:19,425 --> 03:01:22,765
Speaker 21:  myself like who is like an incredibly pedantic annoying photographer that

3049
03:01:23,245 --> 03:01:26,765
Speaker 21:  frequents the pet Aix comment section. Maybe it's simply the time that like

3050
03:01:26,765 --> 03:01:30,285
Speaker 21:  cameras do allow, and this is what app skater to do, allow people to like

3051
03:01:30,285 --> 03:01:33,045
Speaker 21:  find their own style and shoot in a different way. And you see that now

3052
03:01:33,045 --> 03:01:36,845
Speaker 21:  with like the very on apple like thing of like adding so much control to

3053
03:01:36,845 --> 03:01:40,285
Speaker 21:  like what kind of like final output you get in your image. And maybe that

3054
03:01:40,285 --> 03:01:43,805
Speaker 21:  goes down to processing too because processing, I think people are becoming

3055
03:01:43,815 --> 03:01:47,325
Speaker 21:  aware of how many creative decisions are being made for you. And that's

3056
03:01:47,605 --> 03:01:51,485
Speaker 21:  fascinating to me because there was one time like in 2020 a year of unprecedented

3057
03:01:51,485 --> 03:01:55,445
Speaker 21:  times, if I wanna like pull an anecdote where people ran into

3058
03:01:55,445 --> 03:01:58,565
Speaker 21:  this 'cause they were all taking photos with their Samsung or Pixel or

3059
03:01:59,145 --> 03:02:01,925
Speaker 21:  iPhone and they woke up in San Francisco one day and the entire city was

3060
03:02:01,925 --> 03:02:05,485
Speaker 21:  orange. Like completely orange because there was a huge wildfire near the

3061
03:02:05,485 --> 03:02:08,725
Speaker 21:  place where I live now. Yep. And the sun was being filtered through it and

3062
03:02:08,725 --> 03:02:11,645
Speaker 21:  it was all orange and people took a photo with it and the craziest thing

3063
03:02:11,845 --> 03:02:15,245
Speaker 21:  happened, the camera recognized it as being like, oh the white balance is

3064
03:02:15,245 --> 03:02:17,445
Speaker 21:  way off, we're gonna correct for that. This doesn't really happen because

3065
03:02:17,475 --> 03:02:21,205
Speaker 21:  it's trained on everything that's happened before it. And it has, it's literally

3066
03:02:21,385 --> 03:02:24,885
Speaker 21:  all the smart stuff is based on precedent and we were in 2020

3067
03:02:25,145 --> 03:02:29,085
Speaker 21:  living in unprecedented times and so people started downloading

3068
03:02:29,085 --> 03:02:32,925
Speaker 21:  like a camera app like ours to you know, like try to correct that

3069
03:02:32,945 --> 03:02:36,845
Speaker 21:  set manual wide balance. And that I think was like beginning

3070
03:02:36,845 --> 03:02:39,965
Speaker 21:  to be the turning point around when people started like exploring options

3071
03:02:39,965 --> 03:02:43,085
Speaker 21:  like that and being aware of something like that existing. Like they were

3072
03:02:43,085 --> 03:02:46,525
Speaker 21:  aware that as they took a photo like, oh wait, it's doing something for

3073
03:02:46,525 --> 03:02:50,205
Speaker 21:  me and I don't like that it's doing that. And that

3074
03:02:50,465 --> 03:02:54,365
Speaker 21:  has become a greater awareness even in like Gen Z even in people who

3075
03:02:54,365 --> 03:02:58,325
Speaker 21:  don't know what a file is, they know that processing is a thing and

3076
03:02:58,325 --> 03:03:02,165
Speaker 21:  that that increasingly is making decisions for them to go on a long

3077
03:03:02,195 --> 03:03:03,005
Speaker 21:  rant. But yeah,

3078
03:03:03,545 --> 03:03:06,805
Speaker 22:  One question I have, and I, I've talked to you about this ever so slightly.

3079
03:03:07,005 --> 03:03:07,085
Speaker 22:  S

3080
03:03:09,075 --> 03:03:12,905
Speaker 22:  Apple designs the camera as a system. Samsung is a system, Google

3081
03:03:12,965 --> 03:03:16,705
Speaker 22:  is a system, you've got the hardware, the lens, and then you've got a processing

3082
03:03:16,905 --> 03:03:19,385
Speaker 22:  pipeline to lean on and they obviously know exactly what's gonna happen

3083
03:03:19,385 --> 03:03:22,225
Speaker 22:  in their processing pipeline. In the case of Apple, they're designing their

3084
03:03:22,225 --> 03:03:26,065
Speaker 22:  own chip as part of that processing pipeline and it feels like they

3085
03:03:26,065 --> 03:03:29,705
Speaker 22:  can make decisions about what they can handle

3086
03:03:29,885 --> 03:03:33,345
Speaker 22:  in processing at the expense of what the hardware can do.

3087
03:03:33,885 --> 03:03:37,865
Speaker 22:  And If you all are making an app that just pulls the raw data off the sensor,

3088
03:03:39,035 --> 03:03:42,145
Speaker 22:  apple gets to say, well we know there's gonna be some fringing, we know

3089
03:03:42,145 --> 03:03:45,025
Speaker 22:  there's gonna be some distortion in this lens, but we're gonna optimize

3090
03:03:45,025 --> 03:03:48,745
Speaker 22:  it to collect all the light we can because our pipeline can fix

3091
03:03:48,745 --> 03:03:52,465
Speaker 22:  almost anything except not having the light. Has that come up for you now

3092
03:03:52,465 --> 03:03:55,945
Speaker 22:  in these, in the newer versions of the phone where you can see that

3093
03:03:56,185 --> 03:04:00,015
Speaker 22:  optimization starting to shift against like quality

3094
03:04:00,015 --> 03:04:02,855
Speaker 22:  outta the lens for lack of a better term, in favor of just light collection?

3095
03:04:03,445 --> 03:04:07,375
Speaker 21:  Yeah, the, that was actually one of the craziest things I saw when we

3096
03:04:07,375 --> 03:04:09,775
Speaker 21:  started shooting a lot of native raw in. 'cause for a while I was just like

3097
03:04:09,775 --> 03:04:13,535
Speaker 21:  pro raw maxing, like just shooting on pro raw all the time. And then I was

3098
03:04:13,535 --> 03:04:16,255
Speaker 21:  like, okay, let's go back to native raw for a second. I noticed that the

3099
03:04:16,255 --> 03:04:19,375
Speaker 21:  output was just getting a little, was just getting a little worse. Like

3100
03:04:19,375 --> 03:04:22,655
Speaker 21:  if I were to objectively look at it, you know, I just take a this again

3101
03:04:22,655 --> 03:04:26,455
Speaker 21:  to clarify the difference between pro and and native raws. You get raw

3102
03:04:26,455 --> 03:04:29,055
Speaker 21:  sensor data, which you just, I just quickly throw in Lightroom to develop

3103
03:04:29,055 --> 03:04:32,215
Speaker 21:  it. Lightroom processes that sensor data and spits it out. There's actually

3104
03:04:32,215 --> 03:04:35,975
Speaker 21:  some corrections already baked into that. So some of the pipeline does raw

3105
03:04:35,975 --> 03:04:39,815
Speaker 21:  data at on the Apple iPhone and some of it then it starts

3106
03:04:39,815 --> 03:04:43,415
Speaker 21:  converting it to images so it can start merging geometric geometry, corrections,

3107
03:04:43,415 --> 03:04:46,575
Speaker 21:  those kind of things. For instance, your ultra wide camera will have a lot

3108
03:04:46,575 --> 03:04:49,095
Speaker 21:  of corrections because otherwise it looks like a crazy fish eye lens basically.

3109
03:04:49,095 --> 03:04:52,975
Speaker 21:  Right? And then, yeah, we noticed a few years ago, like the main

3110
03:04:52,975 --> 03:04:55,335
Speaker 21:  camera especially, which is the one that meets to gather the most light,

3111
03:04:55,335 --> 03:04:59,135
Speaker 21:  you know, the camera people use for 99% of the time it has more color fringing

3112
03:04:59,135 --> 03:05:01,935
Speaker 21:  than it has in the past. And we, we, we, I think we talked about this in

3113
03:05:01,935 --> 03:05:04,495
Speaker 21:  person briefly neli. I was like, no, like the crazy thing that's happening

3114
03:05:04,495 --> 03:05:08,335
Speaker 21:  here is they just, there's a realization there that like, oh

3115
03:05:08,335 --> 03:05:12,135
Speaker 21:  wait, it might be color fringing, but we can just fix that in the

3116
03:05:12,335 --> 03:05:15,935
Speaker 21:  pipeline if we get more light in, we can just

3117
03:05:16,005 --> 03:05:19,895
Speaker 21:  correct that out and the, the smart fuckable make up for what

3118
03:05:19,895 --> 03:05:22,975
Speaker 21:  would traditionally be considered a bad, the worst photographic lens, right?

3119
03:05:23,035 --> 03:05:25,895
Speaker 21:  If it just, it just becomes a data problem essentially.

3120
03:05:26,915 --> 03:05:29,935
Speaker 21:  And that is coming up a little bit and I wrote a little bit, I just published

3121
03:05:30,095 --> 03:05:33,215
Speaker 21:  a review of the iPhone 16 yesterday and I wrote like,

3122
03:05:34,245 --> 03:05:38,135
Speaker 21:  look, you gotta get used to processing because gadgets in our

3123
03:05:38,135 --> 03:05:41,855
Speaker 21:  phones, I can, I can see them going in one direction. David, I I'm, I

3124
03:05:41,855 --> 03:05:45,295
Speaker 21:  feel like you're like the pixel fold kind of guy, but like you're gonna

3125
03:05:45,295 --> 03:05:49,175
Speaker 21:  get devices that are thinner and folding and sometimes they fold three ways.

3126
03:05:49,275 --> 03:05:52,975
Speaker 21:  Now in China here, the devices are folding three ways. It's, it, it's, it's

3127
03:05:52,975 --> 03:05:56,575
Speaker 21:  going, it it's going that way. We're not going to opt for thicker phones

3128
03:05:56,575 --> 03:06:00,215
Speaker 21:  and bigger cameras and to make cameras work that are smaller and

3129
03:06:00,215 --> 03:06:04,135
Speaker 21:  thinner and tinier and fit into like very small headsets and ray band glasses.

3130
03:06:04,505 --> 03:06:08,095
Speaker 21:  We're gonna need more processing because the sensors, the images aren't

3131
03:06:08,095 --> 03:06:12,015
Speaker 21:  gonna get any better. That's just physics. So I fully believe

3132
03:06:12,015 --> 03:06:15,895
Speaker 21:  that, you know, as we go towards slimmer and foldable iPhones or whatever

3133
03:06:17,435 --> 03:06:20,895
Speaker 21:  the, our output on something like a process zero image is probably gonna

3134
03:06:20,895 --> 03:06:24,375
Speaker 21:  get objectively worse. That's just the way it is. But old fashioned

3135
03:06:24,375 --> 03:06:28,175
Speaker 21:  photography in that way, that's just, I don't know how long that's gonna

3136
03:06:28,175 --> 03:06:31,055
Speaker 21:  be around on these kind of devices as they get smarter and smarter. 'cause

3137
03:06:31,055 --> 03:06:34,655
Speaker 21:  they'll just start relying more on the fact that they're magic, hyper powerful

3138
03:06:34,895 --> 03:06:37,815
Speaker 21:  computers and they're not gonna rely on the fact that they're good at collecting

3139
03:06:37,815 --> 03:06:38,655
Speaker 21:  light 'cause they're just not.

3140
03:06:38,965 --> 03:06:42,055
Speaker 22:  Wait. So let ask you about that. Lemme send you all the way down the existential

3141
03:06:42,075 --> 03:06:45,375
Speaker 22:  rabbit hole. This is where I live. Welcome to the basement with me

3142
03:06:47,115 --> 03:06:51,015
Speaker 22:  at the end of this, right? You're, you, you, the hardware is just there

3143
03:06:51,035 --> 03:06:54,975
Speaker 22:  to collect light and everything else happens in

3144
03:06:55,085 --> 03:06:58,245
Speaker 22:  the processing stack. Everything else is an average of values from the past,

3145
03:06:58,245 --> 03:07:02,045
Speaker 22:  right? Is that, do you see that all the way at the end that it,

3146
03:07:02,745 --> 03:07:06,445
Speaker 22:  you just spin the dial all the way on the path that we're on and we don't

3147
03:07:06,445 --> 03:07:09,205
Speaker 22:  really care if the sensor is any good or the lens is any good as long as

3148
03:07:09,205 --> 03:07:11,965
Speaker 22:  we can collect as much massive light as possible.

3149
03:07:12,745 --> 03:07:15,485
Speaker 21:  See I think that's a great philosophical question because If you come down

3150
03:07:15,485 --> 03:07:19,285
Speaker 21:  to it every, you can solve it the way the Samsung moon photo situation happens.

3151
03:07:19,555 --> 03:07:22,565
Speaker 21:  Most of the world is completely been captured before and done before. If

3152
03:07:22,565 --> 03:07:25,805
Speaker 21:  you train a good enough model with a bad enough sensor, you can probably

3153
03:07:25,805 --> 03:07:28,605
Speaker 21:  take photos of 99.95% of the things out there and they'll be really good.

3154
03:07:29,265 --> 03:07:33,105
Speaker 21:  So like, I don't know, that seems kind of like

3155
03:07:33,145 --> 03:07:35,865
Speaker 21:  a reality that we're heading towards where the processing is just simply

3156
03:07:35,865 --> 03:07:39,065
Speaker 21:  good enough and the reality doesn't, the reality of capturing images just

3157
03:07:39,065 --> 03:07:42,825
Speaker 21:  needs to correspond to like what the internal logic can cor can, can

3158
03:07:43,045 --> 03:07:46,425
Speaker 21:  cohere together. And I personally philosophically find that a really big

3159
03:07:46,425 --> 03:07:48,025
Speaker 21:  problem. I want to make a camera that,

3160
03:07:49,695 --> 03:07:52,385
Speaker 21:  like If you go to on the, What is a photo thing, I was talking to Ben about

3161
03:07:52,385 --> 03:07:54,385
Speaker 21:  this, I was like, we should probably think about what we consider to be

3162
03:07:54,425 --> 03:07:58,145
Speaker 21:  a photo. And to me it is an image that's generated largely majority, at

3163
03:07:58,145 --> 03:08:02,105
Speaker 21:  least by photons that you have captured at a moment in space and time. But

3164
03:08:02,165 --> 03:08:05,025
Speaker 21:  I'm not sure if that is going to be the case. I think in the future, some

3165
03:08:05,025 --> 03:08:08,425
Speaker 21:  cameras, maybe not all of them, but some cameras are going to increasingly

3166
03:08:08,425 --> 03:08:11,745
Speaker 21:  rely on data sets of what the world should look like and what images should

3167
03:08:11,745 --> 03:08:15,625
Speaker 21:  look like and just use data, use light as data, not as like

3168
03:08:16,465 --> 03:08:18,785
Speaker 21:  visual aid as much.

3169
03:08:19,255 --> 03:08:22,385
Speaker 5:  What is allied for all the way at the end of that road? Like what's, what's

3170
03:08:22,385 --> 03:08:23,865
Speaker 5:  your job when we get all the way to the end of that?

3171
03:08:25,335 --> 03:08:28,905
Speaker 20:  Well I mean like the invention of the automobile

3172
03:08:29,045 --> 03:08:32,505
Speaker 20:  didn't put an end to horses. It's just horses were allowed to

3173
03:08:32,845 --> 03:08:35,585
Speaker 20:  be this fun thing, you gotta look at 'em and ride 'em and stuff, right?

3174
03:08:35,785 --> 03:08:39,745
Speaker 20:  But as far as utility for every day, you know, people stopped keeping barns

3175
03:08:39,825 --> 03:08:43,545
Speaker 20:  I guess. And I mean like look, you know, foot

3176
03:08:43,545 --> 03:08:47,385
Speaker 20:  photography didn't end painting, painting. The reason people look at

3177
03:08:47,505 --> 03:08:50,265
Speaker 20:  paintings is because the amount of skill and craftsmanship that goes into

3178
03:08:50,265 --> 03:08:53,545
Speaker 20:  it and being able to work within these constraints. And again, it was really

3179
03:08:53,545 --> 03:08:57,465
Speaker 20:  eye-opening last summer shooting analog because there's

3180
03:08:57,465 --> 03:09:01,105
Speaker 20:  just something about an analog photo and actually the removal of details,

3181
03:09:01,105 --> 03:09:04,985
Speaker 20:  right? And So I don't know if anyone tried to watch one of these

3182
03:09:04,985 --> 03:09:08,905
Speaker 20:  high frame rate movies like The Hobbit at 48 frames per second or, or

3183
03:09:08,905 --> 03:09:09,785
Speaker 20:  that HDR

3184
03:09:11,575 --> 03:09:15,345
Speaker 20:  Will Smith movie, the one with his clone, what was it called? Gemini Man,

3185
03:09:15,345 --> 03:09:19,185
Speaker 20:  there we go. Yeah. And like goes ultra high frame rate HDR and what

3186
03:09:19,185 --> 03:09:22,345
Speaker 20:  ends up happening with movies is when you shoot high frame rate ultra realism,

3187
03:09:22,485 --> 03:09:26,305
Speaker 20:  it breaks the magic because your mind isn't able to fill in the

3188
03:09:26,305 --> 03:09:29,825
Speaker 20:  details and it turns out 24 frames per second with a slow shutter, like

3189
03:09:29,845 --> 03:09:33,785
Speaker 20:  it feels more dreamlike and you're able to suspend disbelief, right? And

3190
03:09:33,785 --> 03:09:37,545
Speaker 20:  so with photography, there's just something about a photo that is less

3191
03:09:37,545 --> 03:09:41,505
Speaker 20:  perfect that, that feels magical about it. So

3192
03:09:41,505 --> 03:09:45,465
Speaker 20:  I think there's always gonna be that as an art form and, but as far as

3193
03:09:45,465 --> 03:09:48,905
Speaker 20:  something that you're gonna just tap a button and get a nice photo, you

3194
03:09:48,905 --> 03:09:51,665
Speaker 20:  know, I think that we are smart enough that we're never gonna enter that

3195
03:09:51,665 --> 03:09:54,605
Speaker 20:  kind of battle with a world's most valuable company.

3196
03:09:55,635 --> 03:09:58,965
Speaker 22:  Well lemme say this, just to put your definition of the test photons you

3197
03:09:58,965 --> 03:10:02,005
Speaker 22:  collected at a moment in space and time, right? I buy that, that's a pretty

3198
03:10:02,005 --> 03:10:05,685
Speaker 22:  good definition. Does that count if you're taking nine photos and

3199
03:10:05,685 --> 03:10:08,965
Speaker 22:  merging them that that moment has extended to nine captures, right?

3200
03:10:09,475 --> 03:10:13,045
Speaker 21:  Yeah, So I think, so the, the thing is like, let's say,

3201
03:10:13,665 --> 03:10:16,165
Speaker 21:  you know, and the same thing goes for cleaning up. Like let's say you use

3202
03:10:16,225 --> 03:10:19,245
Speaker 21:  AI cleanup to, to, to erase a part of the photo, I feel, I still think it's

3203
03:10:19,245 --> 03:10:22,645
Speaker 21:  a photo, but once you fill that in with the majority of a cleanup feature,

3204
03:10:22,825 --> 03:10:26,445
Speaker 21:  so like 50% or more of the pixel has become filled in by a model, I feel

3205
03:10:26,445 --> 03:10:29,765
Speaker 21:  like it se it's ceases to be a photo meaning in a meaningful way because

3206
03:10:29,785 --> 03:10:32,045
Speaker 21:  it has now been filled in by a data set.

3207
03:10:32,465 --> 03:10:34,845
Speaker 22:  You guys are are making a tool. It sounds very much like you're focused

3208
03:10:34,845 --> 03:10:38,125
Speaker 22:  on the creative and artistic aspects of photography. There's a whole other

3209
03:10:38,125 --> 03:10:41,965
Speaker 22:  conversation about can we trust these images that exists in the world. Have

3210
03:10:41,965 --> 03:10:45,845
Speaker 22:  you looked at the various watermarking features from C

3211
03:10:45,845 --> 03:10:49,565
Speaker 22:  two PA that say, actually this happened, right? This photo of Donald Trump,

3212
03:10:49,945 --> 03:10:53,245
Speaker 22:  it occurred. We're gonna mark it, we're gonna send it to Getty. Getty's

3213
03:10:53,245 --> 03:10:56,685
Speaker 22:  gonna know this was real, this photos were marked at the camera level

3214
03:10:56,995 --> 03:11:00,365
Speaker 22:  when they went to to Getty. Have you looked at doing that? Is that something

3215
03:11:00,365 --> 03:11:01,685
Speaker 22:  you're allowed to do on iOS?

3216
03:11:02,125 --> 03:11:05,125
Speaker 20:  That's all bullshit. Am I allowed to swear? Like if not, like write down.

3217
03:11:05,315 --> 03:11:08,765
Speaker 20:  Okay, good. You're allowed to swear. So, alright. Everything that Adobe's

3218
03:11:08,765 --> 03:11:12,565
Speaker 20:  pushing as far as like content authenticity is, it's just, it's

3219
03:11:12,565 --> 03:11:16,525
Speaker 20:  like DKS and anti DVD kinda stuff in the two

3220
03:11:16,765 --> 03:11:20,685
Speaker 20:  thousands. It's like If you look at it, the ability to just

3221
03:11:20,685 --> 03:11:23,925
Speaker 20:  strip the metadata, the fact that you can just point your camera at a screen

3222
03:11:23,985 --> 03:11:27,925
Speaker 20:  and take a photo, like it's not gonna do anything other than convince people

3223
03:11:27,925 --> 03:11:31,045
Speaker 20:  to sign up for Creative Cloud and use Adobe products.

3224
03:11:31,885 --> 03:11:35,765
Speaker 20:  I, I don't know, I i I don't know how much deeper you wanna get in that,

3225
03:11:35,825 --> 03:11:39,085
Speaker 20:  but I don't Right. Think it's a, a useful use of time. Although they do

3226
03:11:39,085 --> 03:11:41,805
Speaker 20:  have a verification feature where I think it does like a signature of like

3227
03:11:41,865 --> 03:11:45,605
Speaker 20:  you can, I think kinda like CS a detection, like

3228
03:11:45,605 --> 03:11:48,925
Speaker 20:  it'll get a signature of a photo you could drag and drop it to UI and whoever

3229
03:11:48,975 --> 03:11:52,565
Speaker 20:  first posted it, like it'll tell you who did that. That's pretty cool. But

3230
03:11:52,565 --> 03:11:54,605
Speaker 20:  the rest of the stuff is just a waste of time. Yeah.

3231
03:11:55,105 --> 03:11:58,565
Speaker 22:  I'm just curious. This is right next to the creative part of how much can

3232
03:11:58,565 --> 03:12:02,045
Speaker 22:  I change this or how much data processing can I do is the, how much can

3233
03:12:02,045 --> 03:12:05,925
Speaker 22:  I trust this? And it feels like both of those are unsolved.

3234
03:12:06,275 --> 03:12:09,005
Speaker 21:  Yeah. When we launched process zero, like I thought I was talking to Ben,

3235
03:12:09,045 --> 03:12:12,325
Speaker 21:  I was like, can we use the fact that we shoot a jpeg that is the process

3236
03:12:12,395 --> 03:12:16,205
Speaker 21:  zero component and like the raw the the sensor again the sensor single shot

3237
03:12:16,265 --> 03:12:20,245
Speaker 21:  raw Bayer data as sort of a pro proof of provenance, like a proof

3238
03:12:20,245 --> 03:12:24,205
Speaker 21:  like that. There are not a lot of data sets of generative ai, if

3239
03:12:24,205 --> 03:12:27,565
Speaker 21:  any. I haven't found any at least that work on raw files. Right. But consider

3240
03:12:27,595 --> 03:12:31,245
Speaker 21:  conceivably you could totally do it. That's the thing. So it's, it's, it's

3241
03:12:31,245 --> 03:12:34,405
Speaker 21:  not a good, you know, it'd be a fig leaf of authenticity. It would be like,

3242
03:12:34,405 --> 03:12:37,365
Speaker 21:  look, there is a raw file. You can see that it was actually taken. But

3243
03:12:38,345 --> 03:12:42,085
Speaker 21:  you know, like it's still, it's just a such a losing battle.

3244
03:12:42,225 --> 03:12:45,965
Speaker 21:  We the we at some point, you philosophically as a, as a photographer or

3245
03:12:45,965 --> 03:12:49,885
Speaker 21:  camera app maker or both or esteem member of photography,

3246
03:12:49,885 --> 03:12:52,520
Speaker 21:  common sections, you, you just go through the same existential crisis and

3247
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:56,275
Speaker 21:  you just realize, okay, there's nothing stopping this.

3248
03:12:56,975 --> 03:13:00,355
Speaker 20:  And can I just back up to what you were saying about like editing photos

3249
03:13:00,495 --> 03:13:04,435
Speaker 20:  and where's the line that you're gonna draw. So in 2016, there was a

3250
03:13:04,435 --> 03:13:08,395
Speaker 20:  famous National Geographic photographer, Steve McCurry, and so he

3251
03:13:08,395 --> 03:13:12,075
Speaker 20:  got into hot water because people noticed one of his award-winning photos

3252
03:13:12,295 --> 03:13:15,315
Speaker 20:  was actually different on his website because there's like a dude in the

3253
03:13:15,315 --> 03:13:18,315
Speaker 20:  background who wasn't in the final award-winning photo and people started

3254
03:13:18,315 --> 03:13:22,035
Speaker 20:  digging into it. And like basically he would use what is iOS

3255
03:13:22,235 --> 03:13:26,155
Speaker 20:  eighteen's object removal feature before it existed. He did that equivalent

3256
03:13:26,155 --> 03:13:30,115
Speaker 20:  kind of editing. And this was a huge, like, y you don't do that if

3257
03:13:30,115 --> 03:13:33,715
Speaker 20:  you're actually taking photos. So I I,

3258
03:13:33,895 --> 03:13:36,795
Speaker 20:  and I guess this is also a question for you as journalists, like when you,

3259
03:13:37,095 --> 03:13:39,035
Speaker 20:  at what point when you're doing like an interview

3260
03:13:40,695 --> 03:13:43,515
Speaker 20:  or you're transcribing, you're pulling quotes, at what point is it okay

3261
03:13:43,515 --> 03:13:47,395
Speaker 20:  to remove the likes and the buts? You'll be doing a lot of that

3262
03:13:47,395 --> 03:13:48,275
Speaker 20:  with me and thank you,

3263
03:13:49,255 --> 03:13:49,475
Speaker 22:  But,

3264
03:13:49,535 --> 03:13:53,435
Speaker 20:  But at what point are you then editorializing what you're

3265
03:13:53,435 --> 03:13:57,075
Speaker 20:  trying to capture and telling a story that actually didn't occur and

3266
03:13:57,075 --> 03:14:00,715
Speaker 20:  effectively, you know, everyone has to have that level of journalistic integrity

3267
03:14:00,715 --> 03:14:01,675
Speaker 20:  if they wanna call it a photo.

3268
03:14:02,375 --> 03:14:04,675
Speaker 22:  So David and I are both gonna answer on three and we're gonna see if we

3269
03:14:04,675 --> 03:14:05,475
Speaker 22:  have the same answer.

3270
03:14:06,865 --> 03:14:07,155
Speaker 5:  Okay.

3271
03:14:08,835 --> 03:14:12,755
Speaker 22:  I actually, I'll let David answer my, my quick version of that is,

3272
03:14:13,215 --> 03:14:16,035
Speaker 22:  that's norms, that's professional norms, that's what you're describing.

3273
03:14:16,035 --> 03:14:18,635
Speaker 22:  Yeah. Right. This guy was a professional photographer, he entered a professional

3274
03:14:18,635 --> 03:14:21,915
Speaker 22:  photography contest, he broke the rules, he got kicked out and they got

3275
03:14:21,915 --> 03:14:25,635
Speaker 22:  in trouble. You're a journalist, you get a bunch of quotes,

3276
03:14:25,855 --> 03:14:29,635
Speaker 22:  you go two sideways, you're over the line, right? Like the

3277
03:14:29,635 --> 03:14:33,435
Speaker 22:  journalist club will, if it still exists, will, will

3278
03:14:33,535 --> 03:14:36,635
Speaker 22:  get mad at you and your, your reputation will suffer. If you're a Getty

3279
03:14:36,635 --> 03:14:38,875
Speaker 22:  photographer, there's a, there's a list of rules of things you're allowed

3280
03:14:38,875 --> 03:14:42,155
Speaker 22:  to edit and most of them are like, you can change exposure and that's about

3281
03:14:42,155 --> 03:14:44,995
Speaker 22:  it, right? You can do some vignetting. If you look at New York Times photos,

3282
03:14:45,695 --> 03:14:48,955
Speaker 22:  all they're allowed to do is vignette. So they're all just vignette to hell

3283
03:14:48,955 --> 03:14:52,155
Speaker 22:  and back. Yeah. Because that's the only button they get. So like,

3284
03:14:52,655 --> 03:14:55,675
Speaker 22:  that's professional norms. I don't know what consumer norms are gonna be

3285
03:14:56,015 --> 03:14:59,795
Speaker 22:  and what we're seeing is an explosion of consumer photography and that

3286
03:14:59,915 --> 03:15:02,675
Speaker 22:  I think is really challenging. I dunno, David, what, what's your answer?

3287
03:15:03,355 --> 03:15:06,635
Speaker 5:  I, I, I think about the same. I mean, there's been a, a big discussion this

3288
03:15:06,635 --> 03:15:09,915
Speaker 5:  year about how people transcribe

3289
03:15:09,975 --> 03:15:13,835
Speaker 5:  Donald Trump. There, there's been all this stuff about sane washing Donald Trump,

3290
03:15:13,835 --> 03:15:17,755
Speaker 5:  where he'll, he'll go on like a nine minute ramble of nonsense

3291
03:15:17,975 --> 03:15:20,875
Speaker 5:  and then a, a reporter will, will essentially try to make it make sense,

3292
03:15:20,875 --> 03:15:24,835
Speaker 5:  which on the one hand is like good, useful journalism. Like here are the

3293
03:15:24,835 --> 03:15:28,395
Speaker 5:  words that he, he was trying to say. On the other hand, it, it makes somebody

3294
03:15:28,395 --> 03:15:32,195
Speaker 5:  who doesn't make any sense makes some sense. And I think I I

3295
03:15:32,385 --> 03:15:36,355
Speaker 5:  it's, it's a complicated thing. Like at what point is my job to make

3296
03:15:36,355 --> 03:15:39,875
Speaker 5:  something, make as much sense as possible So I can help my reader understand

3297
03:15:40,255 --> 03:15:43,795
Speaker 5:  and at what point is my job to represent something as it was

3298
03:15:45,145 --> 03:15:49,005
Speaker 5:  in all its messiness. Yeah. And it's like, it, I think it is kind of a perfect

3299
03:15:49,195 --> 03:15:51,765
Speaker 5:  analogy for what we're trying to do with photography. And I, I don't have

3300
03:15:51,765 --> 03:15:55,325
Speaker 5:  great answers, right? Because it's, especially when it's messy how

3301
03:15:55,745 --> 03:15:57,725
Speaker 5:  uny you're supposed to make it is really complicated.

3302
03:15:57,945 --> 03:16:01,885
Speaker 22:  And, and really the question is, can you make everybody believe in

3303
03:16:01,885 --> 03:16:04,005
Speaker 22:  the professional norm? The answer is like obviously no.

3304
03:16:04,745 --> 03:16:08,205
Speaker 20:  So I guess the closest that we have around ethics right now

3305
03:16:08,705 --> 03:16:12,525
Speaker 20:  is Apple's decision that they're not gonna allow fully generative

3306
03:16:12,705 --> 03:16:16,645
Speaker 20:  AI in iOS 18. And there was the interview with Gruber where they're

3307
03:16:16,645 --> 03:16:19,965
Speaker 20:  talking like, okay, we're gonna generate cartoons, but we're not gonna generate

3308
03:16:20,015 --> 03:16:23,045
Speaker 20:  photo realistic stuff. And so that's nice when you have someone who is,

3309
03:16:23,865 --> 03:16:27,765
Speaker 20:  you know, not enabling outright bad actions,

3310
03:16:28,205 --> 03:16:31,605
Speaker 20:  although then you have someone like Google who's also letting you like Yeah,

3311
03:16:31,605 --> 03:16:33,965
Speaker 20:  just change the background. Yeah. Type in what you want.

3312
03:16:34,395 --> 03:16:37,845
Speaker 21:  That does like, remind me of like that amazing quote that Neli got from

3313
03:16:37,845 --> 03:16:40,805
Speaker 21:  Apple's John McCormack that basically was like, okay, we believe a photo

3314
03:16:40,825 --> 03:16:44,365
Speaker 21:  is a thing that really happened, which is still not going as far as saying

3315
03:16:44,365 --> 03:16:47,445
Speaker 21:  like, a photo is a thing you capture with a camera or is light that is captured.

3316
03:16:47,505 --> 03:16:50,925
Speaker 21:  It is a thing that happened which solely fits in the model of having a generated

3317
03:16:50,925 --> 03:16:54,805
Speaker 21:  future where there is a super great Apple model that will just basically

3318
03:16:54,805 --> 03:16:58,165
Speaker 21:  fill in the blanks if the image data isn't good enough, it just needs to

3319
03:16:58,165 --> 03:17:02,085
Speaker 21:  confirm that a thing has actually happened. So it's like, yeah, like

3320
03:17:02,665 --> 03:17:05,485
Speaker 21:  surely we will continue to have journalistic standards and there will be

3321
03:17:05,525 --> 03:17:09,405
Speaker 21:  a few of these things like C two PA to work in

3322
03:17:09,405 --> 03:17:13,205
Speaker 21:  their niches, but I mean, there's no stopping the

3323
03:17:13,205 --> 03:17:16,445
Speaker 21:  train that's heading down the tracks of like the absolute apocalypse of

3324
03:17:16,445 --> 03:17:19,485
Speaker 21:  like what the meaning the meaningfulness of photos on the internet. I I

3325
03:17:19,485 --> 03:17:22,765
Speaker 21:  truly think, if I look at my daughter, she's one and a half years old now

3326
03:17:22,915 --> 03:17:25,685
Speaker 21:  when she's a teenager. I don't think she will believe any single image she

3327
03:17:25,685 --> 03:17:26,365
Speaker 21:  sees on the internet.

3328
03:17:27,085 --> 03:17:30,325
Speaker 5:  I think the, the piece of this that gets lost in a lot of this conversation,

3329
03:17:30,405 --> 03:17:34,245
Speaker 5:  I think is like, we, we talk a lot about the sort of really high

3330
03:17:34,265 --> 03:17:38,045
Speaker 5:  stakes photos and we talk a lot about like the

3331
03:17:38,825 --> 03:17:42,045
Speaker 5:  photos of a serial number, right? But I think like Sebastian, to your point,

3332
03:17:42,105 --> 03:17:45,925
Speaker 5:  you, you have a young kid. I, I think I have a young kid, Neil

3333
03:17:45,985 --> 03:17:47,525
Speaker 5:  has young kids, Ben, I don't, I don't know.

3334
03:17:47,765 --> 03:17:51,605
Speaker 20:  I got one. He is got hand foot and mouth disease right now, so Yeah. Yeah.

3335
03:17:52,365 --> 03:17:56,165
Speaker 5:  Good times all around. But I think like Sebastian, to your point, your

3336
03:17:56,165 --> 03:17:59,645
Speaker 5:  kid will probably grow up in a world where they don't believe photos they

3337
03:17:59,645 --> 03:18:03,165
Speaker 5:  see on the internet. I think that's probably right. But the question of like,

3338
03:18:03,165 --> 03:18:07,005
Speaker 5:  will they believe photos about themselves from when they were kids? Mm. Is

3339
03:18:07,025 --> 03:18:09,805
Speaker 5:  is the other part of this that I think is like complicated and is, is such

3340
03:18:09,845 --> 03:18:13,765
Speaker 5:  a like normal everyday use case. We don't talk about in this context,

3341
03:18:13,905 --> 03:18:17,765
Speaker 5:  but the, the question of like, when I, when I take pictures of

3342
03:18:17,905 --> 03:18:21,815
Speaker 5:  my kid, what is, what is what responsibility

3343
03:18:22,515 --> 03:18:26,415
Speaker 5:  in, in air quotes, do I have to like truth and honesty versus like taking

3344
03:18:26,535 --> 03:18:28,255
Speaker 5:  a fun picture of my child having fun

3345
03:18:29,815 --> 03:18:33,175
Speaker 5:  I feel like is is such a like mainstream every single person

3346
03:18:33,675 --> 03:18:37,135
Speaker 5:  use case that we just don't talk about enough because it, I it feels

3347
03:18:37,925 --> 03:18:41,175
Speaker 5:  mely, but I don't know. And as you guys think about tallied, like people

3348
03:18:41,415 --> 03:18:43,975
Speaker 5:  download this stuff in part because they wanna make beautiful art that hangs

3349
03:18:43,975 --> 03:18:46,215
Speaker 5:  in museums and in part because they wanna take better pictures that are kids

3350
03:18:46,715 --> 03:18:49,805
Speaker 5:  and like, what, what is the job there in, in this world?

3351
03:18:50,105 --> 03:18:53,925
Speaker 20:  All of my son's photos are in native raw, so I can show him

3352
03:18:53,925 --> 03:18:54,445
Speaker 20:  the receipts

3353
03:18:54,445 --> 03:18:57,165
Speaker 5:  Afterwards. He can develop the negatives himself. Yeah, exactly.

3354
03:18:57,555 --> 03:18:57,845
Speaker 20:  Yeah.

3355
03:19:00,245 --> 03:19:01,285
Speaker 21:  No, but that's, that's a really good point.

3356
03:19:02,025 --> 03:19:03,645
Speaker 5:  But they hear, son, I've made you some negatives.

3357
03:19:03,825 --> 03:19:06,885
Speaker 20:  You know, it's important that every dad has a talk with a son

3358
03:19:07,655 --> 03:19:11,045
Speaker 20:  about noise reduction. It's dangerous world out there

3359
03:19:11,465 --> 03:19:13,765
Speaker 20:  and you know how to be prepared. Yeah.

3360
03:19:14,425 --> 03:19:17,925
Speaker 21:  But So I mean, to that point, like some part of me feels like, you know,

3361
03:19:17,925 --> 03:19:21,885
Speaker 21:  we're gonna go back and look at, we're gonna recognize this era of mobile

3362
03:19:21,885 --> 03:19:25,645
Speaker 21:  photography for looking a certain way. That's just a fact. And we're,

3363
03:19:25,735 --> 03:19:28,485
Speaker 21:  we're recognizing the first generation of Instagram photos by the heavy

3364
03:19:28,515 --> 03:19:31,805
Speaker 21:  filters, which also means people are going to look at the first generation

3365
03:19:31,805 --> 03:19:34,805
Speaker 21:  of Instagrammed photos and be like, oh, these are real, there's no generative

3366
03:19:34,805 --> 03:19:38,125
Speaker 21:  AI in them because you can see by how bad these filters are. This was before

3367
03:19:38,125 --> 03:19:41,085
Speaker 21:  the end times of photographic integrity, which is fascinating to me by the

3368
03:19:41,085 --> 03:19:45,005
Speaker 21:  way that those fake C pia filters are gonna go down in time as like a symbol

3369
03:19:45,025 --> 03:19:48,445
Speaker 21:  of authenticity, which at the time were derided as being universally

3370
03:19:48,685 --> 03:19:50,005
Speaker 5:  Deeply real Photos. Yeah.

3371
03:19:50,005 --> 03:19:53,765
Speaker 21:  Deeply unreal. Yeah, deeply real Photos must be real. And

3372
03:19:54,565 --> 03:19:57,885
Speaker 21:  I think we, we'd love to kind of in a same, in, in a way

3373
03:19:58,795 --> 03:20:02,765
Speaker 21:  provide that niche too, because we want to offer that extra tool

3374
03:20:02,765 --> 03:20:05,645
Speaker 21:  that just gives you a, a more authentic shot because it's a bit more true

3375
03:20:05,665 --> 03:20:08,965
Speaker 21:  to like what an old fashioned camera might have captured. It has a bit less

3376
03:20:08,965 --> 03:20:12,925
Speaker 21:  of that process look going on. But two, like I I

3377
03:20:13,085 --> 03:20:16,325
Speaker 21:  I also believe those photos are more representative of your memories because

3378
03:20:16,325 --> 03:20:20,285
Speaker 21:  they, they are more like the way you remember a moment. Like when I edit

3379
03:20:20,345 --> 03:20:24,205
Speaker 21:  my photos actually I tend to make the sunsets warmer and the cozy

3380
03:20:24,205 --> 03:20:28,085
Speaker 21:  times nicer. And the time when I walked in Tokyo alone at 3:00 AM

3381
03:20:28,295 --> 03:20:31,885
Speaker 21:  bluer and more cyber punky because that's just the way it felt. And I think

3382
03:20:31,885 --> 03:20:35,445
Speaker 21:  those aren't perfect representations of reality. And that greatest common

3383
03:20:35,445 --> 03:20:39,405
Speaker 21:  denominator of photography thing is kind of what's making

3384
03:20:39,405 --> 03:20:43,285
Speaker 21:  people pull towards that a bit more. And maybe also ironically making the

3385
03:20:43,285 --> 03:20:46,565
Speaker 21:  pull more towards generative things or, or more creative ways altering photos

3386
03:20:46,565 --> 03:20:50,085
Speaker 21:  because they're deeply unsatisfied with how, how

3387
03:20:50,085 --> 03:20:53,405
Speaker 21:  perfectly photos represent reality when they're sensing reality around them,

3388
03:20:53,405 --> 03:20:57,165
Speaker 21:  but not the world that they perceive per

3389
03:20:57,185 --> 03:20:58,125
Speaker 21:  se. Emotionally

3390
03:21:05,675 --> 03:21:09,245
Speaker 5:  Welcome back. Alright, so I'm in the middle of kind of a gaming

3391
03:21:09,555 --> 03:21:13,405
Speaker 5:  dilemma. I've been really a gamer off and on over

3392
03:21:13,405 --> 03:21:16,765
Speaker 5:  the course of my life. I, it's not something that it's kind of a consistent

3393
03:21:17,125 --> 03:21:20,965
Speaker 5:  activity, but I'll play a lot for a few months and then kind of put

3394
03:21:20,965 --> 03:21:23,965
Speaker 5:  the console away for a few months. 'cause whatever things get busy or I get

3395
03:21:23,965 --> 03:21:27,805
Speaker 5:  into something else, but then I always come back to games. And really

3396
03:21:27,865 --> 03:21:31,285
Speaker 5:  for me it's sports games that are the most consistent. Like I play

3397
03:21:31,865 --> 03:21:35,645
Speaker 5:  Madden every year. I like the NBA games 2K is really good.

3398
03:21:35,915 --> 03:21:39,885
Speaker 5:  I've been a FIFA player for forever. I like Fortnite. I like games that

3399
03:21:39,885 --> 03:21:43,365
Speaker 5:  I can kind of come and go to and play a whole bunch all at once

3400
03:21:43,745 --> 03:21:47,165
Speaker 5:  and then leave for a little while and then come back. I also like games that

3401
03:21:47,165 --> 03:21:51,005
Speaker 5:  I can play for like 15 minutes at a go. And the challenge I've always had

3402
03:21:51,005 --> 03:21:54,565
Speaker 5:  with a game like Elden Ring is I just wanna play it for hours.

3403
03:21:54,785 --> 03:21:58,285
Speaker 5:  And I feel like it never rewards you for just a couple of minutes of playing

3404
03:21:58,305 --> 03:22:02,205
Speaker 5:  at a time in a way that some of these more finite battle

3405
03:22:02,385 --> 03:22:06,085
Speaker 5:  royale or like football game sized games really are.

3406
03:22:06,505 --> 03:22:10,325
Speaker 5:  So all of this is to say I'm pretty happy with my gaming setup.

3407
03:22:10,525 --> 03:22:14,125
Speaker 5:  I haven't really felt the need to get a PS five or anything like that.

3408
03:22:14,465 --> 03:22:18,005
Speaker 5:  I'm still on a PS four pro. It works fine, everything's great. But more recently

3409
03:22:18,085 --> 03:22:22,005
Speaker 5:  I want something new. We've been talking a lot about

3410
03:22:22,005 --> 03:22:25,965
Speaker 5:  handheld consoles on this show over the last eight months or so I would

3411
03:22:25,965 --> 03:22:29,725
Speaker 5:  say. And there's just a lot of cool stuff happening. I also

3412
03:22:29,745 --> 03:22:33,685
Speaker 5:  travel more than I used to and I'm back to wanting something

3413
03:22:33,725 --> 03:22:37,445
Speaker 5:  I can play on the train or on a plane or in a hotel room when I'm not at

3414
03:22:37,445 --> 03:22:41,245
Speaker 5:  home. I also just spend too much time sitting at my desk. Like

3415
03:22:41,245 --> 03:22:44,845
Speaker 5:  right now I'm sitting at my desk, my monitor's in front of me, my

3416
03:22:45,125 --> 03:22:48,485
Speaker 5:  computer is underneath it. I have a Mac mini that I use for most things.

3417
03:22:48,485 --> 03:22:52,165
Speaker 5:  And then right off to the right is my PlayStation. And so having This

3418
03:22:52,305 --> 03:22:55,725
Speaker 5:  one space be the place that I sit for work all day and then to play games

3419
03:22:55,725 --> 03:22:59,685
Speaker 5:  at night, I just don't like it. And I want something that I can take and

3420
03:22:59,685 --> 03:23:03,365
Speaker 5:  sit on the couch while I hang out with the dog or play out in the backyard

3421
03:23:03,395 --> 03:23:07,005
Speaker 5:  when the weather's nice. So I'm really into the idea of a handheld console,

3422
03:23:07,225 --> 03:23:11,165
Speaker 5:  but I have no idea which one to get. So I enlisted two people

3423
03:23:11,225 --> 03:23:14,965
Speaker 5:  to help me figure it out. Sean Hollister and Alex Kranz, they both know this

3424
03:23:14,965 --> 03:23:18,845
Speaker 5:  stuff way better than I do. And together we are going to make a

3425
03:23:18,965 --> 03:23:22,805
Speaker 5:  decision about which handheld console I'm gonna buy. Let's get into it.

3426
03:23:23,355 --> 03:23:26,405
Speaker 5:  Alex Krantz. Hello in Texas. Howdy y'all.

3427
03:23:27,915 --> 03:23:31,205
Speaker 5:  Well this is, this is what we're gonna do here. Sean Hollister. Hello.

3428
03:23:32,065 --> 03:23:34,445
Speaker 23:  Hi. From the Land of Gaming Handhelds,

3429
03:23:34,725 --> 03:23:38,245
Speaker 5:  I have brought you here to do personal tech support for me because that is

3430
03:23:38,245 --> 03:23:41,805
Speaker 5:  what the first test is about, is helping David figure out which

3431
03:23:41,805 --> 03:23:45,445
Speaker 5:  gadgets he should buy. Good. I'm going to lay out for you my current situation

3432
03:23:45,785 --> 03:23:49,765
Speaker 5:  and then you are going to help me solve my current situation. So

3433
03:23:49,765 --> 03:23:53,485
Speaker 5:  my current situation is I have a PlayStation four, I've had it for a million

3434
03:23:53,485 --> 03:23:57,405
Speaker 5:  years. It's fine. It plays video games. I would like to

3435
03:23:57,405 --> 03:24:01,245
Speaker 5:  upgrade, but I don't think what I want is a PS five. I think what I want

3436
03:24:01,245 --> 03:24:05,125
Speaker 5:  is something handheld and portable because my PS

3437
03:24:05,125 --> 03:24:08,645
Speaker 5:  four like lives next to my computer in my basement and I'm spending too much

3438
03:24:08,645 --> 03:24:11,565
Speaker 5:  time sitting in this chair looking at this screen. And I would like to have

3439
03:24:11,565 --> 03:24:14,285
Speaker 5:  something that can like go out in the world with me and I travel a lot and

3440
03:24:14,285 --> 03:24:18,165
Speaker 5:  all these things. So I want something that is like primarily but not entirely

3441
03:24:19,165 --> 03:24:22,965
Speaker 5:  a portable handheld gadget. I would like to

3442
03:24:22,965 --> 03:24:26,605
Speaker 5:  play lots of games. We can talk about which games I do and don't care about,

3443
03:24:26,605 --> 03:24:30,165
Speaker 5:  but I have exactly one non-negotiable game, which is, which is

3444
03:24:30,355 --> 03:24:34,325
Speaker 5:  fifa, EA Sports FC is the new name of it. I will call it FIFA

3445
03:24:34,325 --> 03:24:37,925
Speaker 5:  until the day I die. I play that game more than I play every other game

3446
03:24:38,365 --> 03:24:41,925
Speaker 5:  combined and I need that game. That's it. That's literally like,

3447
03:24:42,075 --> 03:24:45,965
Speaker 5:  that is the entirety of where I am and I wanna buy something and I

3448
03:24:45,965 --> 03:24:47,005
Speaker 5:  want you to tell me what to buy.

3449
03:24:47,625 --> 03:24:51,565
Speaker 23:  Why? Why is that your game? Why is that your game? Because I have an

3450
03:24:51,565 --> 03:24:55,245
Speaker 23:  answer for you, but the answer has just been foiled by the fact that you

3451
03:24:55,245 --> 03:24:58,605
Speaker 23:  have picked a game which, and I quote runs a,

3452
03:24:59,075 --> 03:25:02,485
Speaker 23:  this program encountered E 1 110 0 B during

3453
03:25:02,485 --> 03:25:06,285
Speaker 23:  initialization. Okay. Error message when you try to run it outta

3454
03:25:06,285 --> 03:25:09,645
Speaker 23:  Steam deck. So I guess I'm not gonna tell you to buy a Steve Deck.

3455
03:25:10,185 --> 03:25:13,325
Speaker 5:  My worry was this is going to be the shortest The Vergecast in history because

3456
03:25:13,405 --> 03:25:15,805
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say all that and you were both gonna say Steam Deck and then

3457
03:25:15,805 --> 03:25:19,565
Speaker 5:  we were gonna hang up and move on with our lives if it were not for

3458
03:25:19,595 --> 03:25:23,365
Speaker 5:  This one game that I require. Is the world sort of that simple

3459
03:25:23,585 --> 03:25:24,645
Speaker 5:  at this particular moment?

3460
03:25:25,195 --> 03:25:25,485
Speaker 24:  Yeah,

3461
03:25:25,985 --> 03:25:29,725
Speaker 23:  It kind of is. And it Maybe it won't be in like, okay,

3462
03:25:30,065 --> 03:25:33,885
Speaker 23:  two weeks in, in, in two weeks or so through, is it three weeks? There will

3463
03:25:33,885 --> 03:25:37,765
Speaker 23:  be a Windows handheld with a battery that is bigger than any other

3464
03:25:37,765 --> 03:25:41,405
Speaker 23:  handheld on the market. And maybe that will solve the issue of Windows handhelds

3465
03:25:41,405 --> 03:25:42,365
Speaker 23:  don't have great battery life.

3466
03:25:42,435 --> 03:25:45,045
Speaker 24:  That won't solve all the other problems with the Windows handheld.

3467
03:25:46,305 --> 03:25:49,525
Speaker 24:  I'm gonna say David, you're, you're, you know, you're on The Vergecast,

3468
03:25:49,545 --> 03:25:53,365
Speaker 24:  So I feel very comfortable saying you like to tinker, you

3469
03:25:53,365 --> 03:25:54,965
Speaker 24:  enjoy a little tinkering. So

3470
03:25:55,005 --> 03:25:58,845
Speaker 5:  I, I do, when I don't, I will say what I'm, I am willing to tinker.

3471
03:25:59,315 --> 03:26:03,045
Speaker 5:  Like if it, if it's a matter of I need to like buy this thing and spend a

3472
03:26:03,045 --> 03:26:06,085
Speaker 5:  couple of hours like downloading and tweaking and doing whatever I need to

3473
03:26:06,085 --> 03:26:10,045
Speaker 5:  get it set up fine. I am not buying a thing

3474
03:26:10,045 --> 03:26:13,685
Speaker 5:  with the intention of screwing with it forever. Yeah. I would like this thing

3475
03:26:13,685 --> 03:26:17,645
Speaker 5:  to play video games and I want to be able to sit down on my couch and be

3476
03:26:17,645 --> 03:26:20,805
Speaker 5:  playing video games as quickly as possible. That's actually very important

3477
03:26:20,805 --> 03:26:21,085
Speaker 5:  to me.

3478
03:26:21,415 --> 03:26:25,405
Speaker 23:  Would you spend those two hours, hear me out? Would you spend

3479
03:26:25,405 --> 03:26:29,365
Speaker 23:  those two hours setting up your steam deck to dual boots

3480
03:26:29,875 --> 03:26:33,325
Speaker 23:  windows off of an SD card? Occasionally

3481
03:26:33,675 --> 03:26:37,325
Speaker 23:  with the one non-negotiable game that apparently you must have,

3482
03:26:37,585 --> 03:26:41,525
Speaker 24:  You can get FIFA on the steam deck without doing dual boot. I was,

3483
03:26:41,685 --> 03:26:43,085
Speaker 24:  I was looking this up.

3484
03:26:43,555 --> 03:26:44,165
Speaker 5:  Tell me more.

3485
03:26:45,265 --> 03:26:49,005
Speaker 24:  You will need to be comfortable diving

3486
03:26:49,195 --> 03:26:53,005
Speaker 24:  into the Linux side of Steam deck. Okay. And do some tweaking.

3487
03:26:53,305 --> 03:26:56,605
Speaker 24:  And also does it have to be FIFA

3488
03:26:56,605 --> 03:26:57,325
Speaker 24:  24?

3489
03:26:57,945 --> 03:26:58,165
Speaker 5:  Yes.

3490
03:26:58,785 --> 03:27:01,525
Speaker 24:  Oh, it can't can't be FIFA 23. Well

3491
03:27:01,525 --> 03:27:05,125
Speaker 5:  No, it actually, it, what's important is that it's going to be 25 in like

3492
03:27:05,185 --> 03:27:07,485
Speaker 5:  six weeks and it's, it's actually what I need is that one.

3493
03:27:07,865 --> 03:27:11,205
Speaker 23:  Do you have to play it online? Because it's the NH sheet That's, that's

3494
03:27:11,405 --> 03:27:15,205
Speaker 23:  the problem here. Ea Okay. Insisting on its own version of Anti Sheet instead

3495
03:27:15,205 --> 03:27:16,925
Speaker 23:  of the ones that actually work on the steam deck.

3496
03:27:17,275 --> 03:27:18,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I need to be online.

3497
03:27:18,715 --> 03:27:19,405
Speaker 23:  Shit. Well

3498
03:27:20,405 --> 03:27:24,325
Speaker 24:  I feel like the other FIFA games have appeared in Xbox Cloud and

3499
03:27:24,325 --> 03:27:26,405
Speaker 24:  I feel like This one would also appear in Xbox Cloud.

3500
03:27:26,595 --> 03:27:28,085
Speaker 23:  That was my next thought. You

3501
03:27:28,085 --> 03:27:30,725
Speaker 5:  Make a very good point here, which is a thing that I should have said. I

3502
03:27:30,725 --> 03:27:33,445
Speaker 5:  don't need to be able to play this game on the first day that it is available.

3503
03:27:33,555 --> 03:27:37,205
Speaker 5:  Okay. I just need to play it at some point. Yeah. And what I have discovered

3504
03:27:37,205 --> 03:27:40,325
Speaker 5:  about the video game world is that those things are, are very different.

3505
03:27:40,325 --> 03:27:43,885
Speaker 5:  Like when things come to Game Pass and there's stuff that comes to PlayStations

3506
03:27:43,935 --> 03:27:47,925
Speaker 5:  Cloud stuff later on that isn't there, like day and date when

3507
03:27:47,925 --> 03:27:50,805
Speaker 5:  they release, like the reason I picked this game that matters is because

3508
03:27:51,005 --> 03:27:54,845
Speaker 5:  I, I can just like get lost down this impossible universe with any game that

3509
03:27:54,845 --> 03:27:58,165
Speaker 5:  I want. It's all very complicated. But just, just to tie off the one piece

3510
03:27:58,165 --> 03:28:02,005
Speaker 5:  of this, if, if all I was saying is I want a handheld thing to play

3511
03:28:02,005 --> 03:28:05,845
Speaker 5:  games on and I did not give you any specific games Yeah. Is the answer like

3512
03:28:05,845 --> 03:28:07,205
Speaker 5:  the steam deck and it's not even close?

3513
03:28:07,835 --> 03:28:11,165
Speaker 23:  Yeah, it really is. It really is. The steam deck.

3514
03:28:11,785 --> 03:28:15,685
Speaker 23:  We, we we're in this moment where all of these other

3515
03:28:16,245 --> 03:28:19,485
Speaker 23:  companies are like, we want a piece of that steam deck action, but we're

3516
03:28:19,485 --> 03:28:23,245
Speaker 23:  gonna build it on Windows because gamers tell us that Windows is where

3517
03:28:23,345 --> 03:28:26,445
Speaker 23:  all of the games are and they want to just be able to play the games they

3518
03:28:26,445 --> 03:28:27,765
Speaker 23:  already own. Which

3519
03:28:27,765 --> 03:28:28,565
Speaker 24:  Is true. Which

3520
03:28:28,565 --> 03:28:32,325
Speaker 23:  Is true. But the reality is that the Steam deck plays

3521
03:28:32,515 --> 03:28:36,285
Speaker 23:  Windows games and it plays more of them better

3522
03:28:36,435 --> 03:28:39,365
Speaker 23:  than a native Windows system plays Windows games.

3523
03:28:39,715 --> 03:28:41,685
Speaker 5:  What is the problem with the native Windows system?

3524
03:28:41,915 --> 03:28:45,725
Speaker 24:  Because Windows is built for computers for

3525
03:28:45,875 --> 03:28:49,765
Speaker 24:  laptops and, and desktops and things that you use with a mouse and a at

3526
03:28:49,765 --> 03:28:53,725
Speaker 24:  least 13 inch display. And then you put that on a seven inch

3527
03:28:53,915 --> 03:28:57,165
Speaker 24:  display and instead of a mouse you have a joystick.

3528
03:28:57,635 --> 03:29:01,205
Speaker 5:  Okay, that sounds awful. Now that, now that I'm thinking this through, that

3529
03:29:01,205 --> 03:29:02,125
Speaker 5:  sounds like a nightmare.

3530
03:29:02,475 --> 03:29:06,045
Speaker 23:  That part's kind of, that you can, If you wanna spend your two hours of

3531
03:29:06,045 --> 03:29:09,965
Speaker 23:  setup, you can certainly spend 10 minutes of them setting up

3532
03:29:09,965 --> 03:29:13,725
Speaker 23:  steam to launch every time you launch your Windows computer, enter launch

3533
03:29:13,805 --> 03:29:16,965
Speaker 23:  right into big picture mode. And then you have an interface that's similar

3534
03:29:17,065 --> 03:29:20,885
Speaker 23:  to the steam deck, but it doesn't have the ability to like

3535
03:29:21,335 --> 03:29:25,205
Speaker 23:  tweak the handheld very easily so that you get great battery life. The

3536
03:29:25,205 --> 03:29:27,445
Speaker 23:  chips won't give you great battery life to begin with 'cause there's all

3537
03:29:27,445 --> 03:29:31,045
Speaker 23:  that other overhead for all the other shit you don't need in Windows. Sometimes

3538
03:29:31,065 --> 03:29:34,485
Speaker 23:  you'll turn off your Windows system, you'll, you'll put it to sleep and

3539
03:29:34,485 --> 03:29:37,405
Speaker 23:  you'll turn it back on again and wake it up again and all of a sudden your

3540
03:29:37,405 --> 03:29:40,205
Speaker 23:  app will be gone. And where did it go? I wonder why it isn't full screen

3541
03:29:40,205 --> 03:29:43,405
Speaker 23:  anymore. It's this tiny icon on the Windows task bar. That's not great.

3542
03:29:43,635 --> 03:29:46,965
Speaker 23:  Sometimes it won't wake up from sleep, it'll have restarted itself.

3543
03:29:47,305 --> 03:29:50,965
Speaker 5:  I'm having like netbook flashbacks to 10 years ago as you're

3544
03:29:50,965 --> 03:29:51,565
Speaker 5:  describing this,

3545
03:29:51,835 --> 03:29:55,565
Speaker 24:  Sometimes for some reason I can't get it to stop asking for the password

3546
03:29:55,955 --> 03:29:59,365
Speaker 24:  when I open one of my Windows game consoles. And so then I have to like

3547
03:29:59,505 --> 03:30:03,045
Speaker 24:  figure out how to get the, the accessibility keyboard up, which

3548
03:30:03,185 --> 03:30:07,125
Speaker 24:  always takes at least five minutes and then very carefully

3549
03:30:07,155 --> 03:30:10,845
Speaker 24:  type in the password, which is super long because I like to be safe.

3550
03:30:11,475 --> 03:30:14,005
Speaker 24:  It's, it's my favorite thing to do, David, you don't wanna do that.

3551
03:30:14,115 --> 03:30:18,005
Speaker 5:  This is not the most compelling case you've ever made, Alex. But wait,

3552
03:30:18,005 --> 03:30:21,885
Speaker 5:  Sean, you, you alluded to maybe there is something coming that solves this

3553
03:30:21,885 --> 03:30:23,005
Speaker 5:  problem for me. Okay.

3554
03:30:23,345 --> 03:30:26,205
Speaker 23:  Not most of these problems. Okay. But, but the but the battery life, the

3555
03:30:26,205 --> 03:30:26,925
Speaker 23:  battery life problem

3556
03:30:28,475 --> 03:30:31,525
Speaker 23:  asus with the rug ally, the ROG ally, they're, they're gonna, they're gonna

3557
03:30:31,525 --> 03:30:35,325
Speaker 23:  hop on me. So the ROG ally came out a year ago

3558
03:30:36,065 --> 03:30:39,925
Speaker 23:  as like a steam dick, but worse in almost every way

3559
03:30:40,185 --> 03:30:43,725
Speaker 23:  except that it had a better screen, a variable refresh rate screen. It has

3560
03:30:43,725 --> 03:30:46,365
Speaker 23:  since been surpassed by the Steam deck oled, which has an OLED screen that

3561
03:30:46,365 --> 03:30:49,925
Speaker 23:  goes 90 hertz. I'm gonna stop getting into the weeds, but they're coming

3562
03:30:49,945 --> 03:30:53,725
Speaker 23:  out with a new version of that later this month that will have a

3563
03:30:53,725 --> 03:30:57,565
Speaker 23:  doubled battery in it and all kinds of other creature comforts.

3564
03:30:57,565 --> 03:31:01,445
Speaker 23:  It'll be more comfortable to hold in the year since they

3565
03:31:01,445 --> 03:31:05,285
Speaker 23:  shipped the original ROG ally, the UI has gotten a little bit

3566
03:31:05,285 --> 03:31:08,965
Speaker 23:  better. It's smoother. Like Tom Warren likes

3567
03:31:09,065 --> 03:31:12,565
Speaker 23:  his, I think he might prefer that over the steam deck. He is a notorious

3568
03:31:12,565 --> 03:31:13,605
Speaker 23:  Windows fan boy.

3569
03:31:13,825 --> 03:31:15,205
Speaker 24:  That's why he doesn't count.

3570
03:31:15,725 --> 03:31:19,005
Speaker 23:  I I think it's going to be very possibly the first Windows

3571
03:31:19,245 --> 03:31:23,205
Speaker 23:  handheld that I can recommend because they've gotten so many

3572
03:31:23,205 --> 03:31:26,885
Speaker 23:  things right. But it fundamentally still runs Windows and

3573
03:31:27,205 --> 03:31:30,965
Speaker 23:  Microsoft has not improved Windows in any meaningful way in the year

3574
03:31:30,985 --> 03:31:32,925
Speaker 23:  and a half, two years since Steam Deck came out.

3575
03:31:33,315 --> 03:31:36,645
Speaker 24:  They could though, right? Like, like we've been hearing a lot of rumors

3576
03:31:36,645 --> 03:31:39,445
Speaker 24:  that they're gonna introduce some sort of Xbox handheld in the next couple

3577
03:31:39,445 --> 03:31:43,405
Speaker 24:  of years that'll very likely run on Windows because technically the Xbox

3578
03:31:43,405 --> 03:31:46,845
Speaker 24:  runs on that. There's like the opportunity, I feel like a lot like

3579
03:31:47,485 --> 03:31:51,245
Speaker 24:  remember when a MD was having its big resurgence. Nvidia was the game

3580
03:31:51,925 --> 03:31:55,645
Speaker 24:  GPU and then a MD was like, we're gonna start doing this again. And the

3581
03:31:55,645 --> 03:31:59,485
Speaker 24:  difference was Nvidia actually did software and made the games

3582
03:31:59,485 --> 03:32:02,325
Speaker 24:  work really, really well. Whereas a MD didn't for at least a year or two.

3583
03:32:02,555 --> 03:32:06,365
Speaker 24:  Yeah. That's where the Windows handhelds are. No one's done those really

3584
03:32:06,435 --> 03:32:09,885
Speaker 24:  important software tweaks. So the steam deck is better, but

3585
03:32:10,085 --> 03:32:12,925
Speaker 23:  Microsoft would have to be like, we're gonna ship a different OS on it.

3586
03:32:12,935 --> 03:32:15,885
Speaker 23:  We're gonna ship a conversion to Windows that's so stripped down. You don't

3587
03:32:16,125 --> 03:32:17,685
Speaker 23:  recognize it as Windows anymore. Look,

3588
03:32:17,865 --> 03:32:20,845
Speaker 24:  If it opens ea origins then the like I'm fine.

3589
03:32:21,405 --> 03:32:24,965
Speaker 23:  EA is one of the achilles of the steam deck you brought up fifa. Fifa

3590
03:32:25,445 --> 03:32:29,325
Speaker 23:  EA games will notoriously, particularly If you need online, they will just

3591
03:32:29,695 --> 03:32:33,405
Speaker 23:  break on Steam deck because EA does not give a shit about

3592
03:32:33,545 --> 03:32:37,245
Speaker 23:  valves handheld and they'll just like change their stupid mandatory like

3593
03:32:37,285 --> 03:32:40,885
Speaker 23:  DRM app all the time. It used to be called Origin now it's like EA app and

3594
03:32:40,885 --> 03:32:43,565
Speaker 23:  games will just break there on Steam deck. But everything else works pretty

3595
03:32:43,565 --> 03:32:44,045
Speaker 23:  good. But

3596
03:32:44,045 --> 03:32:46,925
Speaker 24:  They do participate in cloud gaming. They, they, they, most of their stuff

3597
03:32:46,925 --> 03:32:50,725
Speaker 24:  is available on the various cloud gaming platforms and all of those

3598
03:32:50,755 --> 03:32:53,965
Speaker 24:  work on the steam deck and you can get 'em up and running pretty quickly

3599
03:32:54,505 --> 03:32:57,725
Speaker 24:  and then not have to like constantly go into the Linux backend to tweak

3600
03:32:57,965 --> 03:32:59,525
Speaker 24:  'em. Just the one time meaning

3601
03:32:59,555 --> 03:33:03,245
Speaker 5:  Like I could do like steam deck plus game

3602
03:33:03,275 --> 03:33:04,925
Speaker 5:  pass and solve my problem.

3603
03:33:05,305 --> 03:33:05,525
Speaker 23:  Yes.

3604
03:33:05,825 --> 03:33:07,325
Speaker 5:  Is thi is this a good idea? Yeah,

3605
03:33:07,325 --> 03:33:10,525
Speaker 24:  You could do that. Okay. You could even, you could stream your, your Sony

3606
03:33:10,745 --> 03:33:14,205
Speaker 24:  PS four from there so you don't have to like sit in front of it to play

3607
03:33:14,205 --> 03:33:14,885
Speaker 24:  the last of us.

3608
03:33:15,225 --> 03:33:18,885
Speaker 23:  Oh yeah. We can stream your Xbox and your PlayStation and

3609
03:33:18,975 --> 03:33:21,365
Speaker 23:  cloud to the steam deck. It does all these things.

3610
03:33:21,705 --> 03:33:25,125
Speaker 5:  I'm glad you brought this up because this is, this is a, a thing I have deeply

3611
03:33:25,645 --> 03:33:28,925
Speaker 5:  investigated and have come up with is a, is just a terrible nightmare that

3612
03:33:28,925 --> 03:33:32,885
Speaker 5:  I will not subject myself to. There are, there are things about

3613
03:33:33,105 --> 03:33:37,005
Speaker 5:  remote streaming your own console that are really great and they

3614
03:33:37,105 --> 03:33:40,945
Speaker 5:  immediately fall apart as soon as you get anywhere outside of your house.

3615
03:33:40,945 --> 03:33:42,185
Speaker 5:  Like it just doesn't. Yeah. Oh yeah.

3616
03:33:42,205 --> 03:33:44,065
Speaker 23:  Do you, do you need to play Fief outside your house?

3617
03:33:44,385 --> 03:33:48,105
Speaker 5:  I do. Like for me, honestly. Okay. The, the two biggest things

3618
03:33:48,205 --> 03:33:51,745
Speaker 5:  I'm trying to solve in switching from this console on my desk to

3619
03:33:52,125 --> 03:33:55,745
Speaker 5:  the handheld is I wanna play other places in my house than at this desk,

3620
03:33:55,995 --> 03:33:59,945
Speaker 5:  which is a victory for console streaming and I wanna play when I travel

3621
03:34:00,285 --> 03:34:03,025
Speaker 5:  in part because I'm addicted to this game. And it's set up in such a way

3622
03:34:03,025 --> 03:34:05,305
Speaker 5:  that the mechanics are, If you don't play every day, it's actually kind of

3623
03:34:05,305 --> 03:34:08,545
Speaker 5:  like, it's a real problem as I'm describing this. But this is where I'm at

3624
03:34:08,545 --> 03:34:12,385
Speaker 5:  in life and the console streaming thing is great for the first thing.

3625
03:34:12,385 --> 03:34:16,105
Speaker 5:  Like I can, I can sit upstairs on my couch and play my

3626
03:34:16,365 --> 03:34:20,305
Speaker 5:  PS four on like an iPad and it actually works passively well, total

3627
03:34:20,455 --> 03:34:24,145
Speaker 5:  non-starter trying to stream any stuff over the internet. I just,

3628
03:34:24,215 --> 03:34:25,185
Speaker 5:  it's just not even worth it.

3629
03:34:25,375 --> 03:34:27,985
Speaker 23:  This goes for all streaming. Yeah, I agree with that. All streaming breaks

3630
03:34:27,985 --> 03:34:31,785
Speaker 23:  down once you leave your house because you no longer have control over making

3631
03:34:31,785 --> 03:34:35,345
Speaker 23:  sure you have a good internet connection. If you're out there like on 5G,

3632
03:34:35,605 --> 03:34:39,345
Speaker 23:  If you have a great 5G signal and nobody else in the node is using it right

3633
03:34:39,345 --> 03:34:42,145
Speaker 23:  then, yeah, you could have a great streaming experience. But I, I would

3634
03:34:42,165 --> 03:34:45,825
Speaker 23:  sit, I would sit in, you know, a hospital waiting room or out in a cafe

3635
03:34:46,085 --> 03:34:48,945
Speaker 23:  and I'd be using that, that razor device, which could only really do cloud

3636
03:34:48,945 --> 03:34:52,785
Speaker 23:  streaming and I would have a beautiful streaming

3637
03:34:52,785 --> 03:34:56,025
Speaker 23:  experience that would drop out five minutes later and be completely unplayable

3638
03:34:56,055 --> 03:34:59,905
Speaker 23:  over and over and over again. I had that experience with cloud gaming

3639
03:34:59,975 --> 03:35:03,745
Speaker 23:  with a good cloud gaming service like GForce. Now great service. This

3640
03:35:03,745 --> 03:35:05,985
Speaker 23:  connection would not maintain that. Now if you're talking about going over

3641
03:35:05,985 --> 03:35:09,585
Speaker 23:  to a friend's house, who, which that your friend also has amazing

3642
03:35:10,025 --> 03:35:13,345
Speaker 23:  internet at home and you wanna stream from Xbox Cloud there. Great. That,

3643
03:35:13,345 --> 03:35:14,625
Speaker 23:  that could, that could, that could work great.

3644
03:35:14,985 --> 03:35:18,265
Speaker 24:  I was just assuming that David has like a hotspot with him at all time.

3645
03:35:18,265 --> 03:35:21,465
Speaker 24:  That gives him brilliant internet like 90% of the time,

3646
03:35:21,845 --> 03:35:25,785
Speaker 5:  To be honest, I do a lot. Yes. It's called, it's called an iPad Pro with

3647
03:35:25,785 --> 03:35:29,625
Speaker 5:  Cell Connection and it's actually like an unbelievably great hotspot. The

3648
03:35:29,625 --> 03:35:33,145
Speaker 5:  problem is, I'll give you the worst case scenario for my own

3649
03:35:33,205 --> 03:35:37,025
Speaker 5:  gaming usage is on an Amtrak train from DC

3650
03:35:37,085 --> 03:35:40,265
Speaker 5:  to New York. And at that point, realistically what I need is games I can

3651
03:35:40,265 --> 03:35:43,945
Speaker 5:  play offline, right? Which I think just rules out full reliance on

3652
03:35:43,975 --> 03:35:47,305
Speaker 5:  game streaming services. Like I actually, this is why I'm, I'm compelled

3653
03:35:47,305 --> 03:35:51,265
Speaker 5:  by the combination of Steam Deck and Game Pass. Like I,

3654
03:35:51,385 --> 03:35:55,265
Speaker 5:  I can do mostly online stuff and like I have, I, I don't need to be able

3655
03:35:55,265 --> 03:35:58,745
Speaker 5:  to play FIFA online while I'm on Amtrak wifi. That's like not possible in

3656
03:35:58,745 --> 03:36:01,905
Speaker 5:  the world that we live in. So I'm fine with that, but I need to be able to

3657
03:36:01,905 --> 03:36:05,545
Speaker 5:  do something on that thing when I have crappy connection and the idea of

3658
03:36:05,665 --> 03:36:09,425
Speaker 5:  just having like a brick in my hands when the wifi is bad feels

3659
03:36:09,845 --> 03:36:10,065
Speaker 5:  bad.

3660
03:36:10,865 --> 03:36:14,745
Speaker 24:  I do have one other suggestion and it is actually even

3661
03:36:14,745 --> 03:36:17,625
Speaker 24:  more basic than the steam deck and it's a switch.

3662
03:36:17,985 --> 03:36:19,225
Speaker 5:  I I'm glad you brought this up.

3663
03:36:19,895 --> 03:36:23,345
Speaker 24:  It's, it's like the steam deck gives you all of the

3664
03:36:23,345 --> 03:36:27,305
Speaker 24:  customization and gives you, it's like a Swiss Army knife. The switch is

3665
03:36:27,305 --> 03:36:31,105
Speaker 24:  like just a really good K bar. Like it's good for one thing

3666
03:36:31,105 --> 03:36:34,065
Speaker 24:  and that's playing the games that Nintendo is okay with you playing on it.

3667
03:36:34,285 --> 03:36:38,085
Speaker 5:  And one of those games is, is EA Sports FC 24,

3668
03:36:38,305 --> 03:36:40,725
Speaker 5:  the dumbest name game in soccer. But

3669
03:36:40,725 --> 03:36:43,365
Speaker 23:  You're still not gonna play it online on Amtrak, right? No,

3670
03:36:43,465 --> 03:36:47,325
Speaker 5:  But So I I have almost landed there except, and, and Kranz I'm glad you

3671
03:36:47,325 --> 03:36:50,445
Speaker 5:  brought this up because I wanna know what you guys think right now feels

3672
03:36:50,445 --> 03:36:54,205
Speaker 5:  like a stupid time to buy a switch. It feels like the end of a

3673
03:36:54,205 --> 03:36:57,925
Speaker 5:  switch cycle. They have already talked about the next one, like the switch

3674
03:36:57,985 --> 03:37:00,725
Speaker 5:  by all accounts is still very good, but this feels like a ridiculous time

3675
03:37:00,725 --> 03:37:01,565
Speaker 5:  to buy a switch.

3676
03:37:01,985 --> 03:37:05,765
Speaker 23:  It is absolutely the end of the switch cycle. They're they're, they're delaying

3677
03:37:05,765 --> 03:37:08,005
Speaker 23:  it a little bit. They're not like, they don't want to come out right away

3678
03:37:08,005 --> 03:37:11,885
Speaker 23:  and do switch too. They're biding their time probably 'cause they want

3679
03:37:12,005 --> 03:37:15,925
Speaker 23:  to get some great software lined up for it. And I imagine that that

3680
03:37:16,285 --> 03:37:19,965
Speaker 23:  software, If you wanna play a metro prime for or whatever the next game

3681
03:37:19,965 --> 03:37:23,805
Speaker 23:  is that Nintendo does, it probably won't work as well on

3682
03:37:23,805 --> 03:37:26,765
Speaker 23:  the current switch. 'cause the current switch is not only seven years old

3683
03:37:26,785 --> 03:37:29,885
Speaker 23:  in terms of its processing power, but also

3684
03:37:30,785 --> 03:37:34,525
Speaker 23:  was already weak to begin with. Like when you played Zelda

3685
03:37:34,665 --> 03:37:38,405
Speaker 23:  breath of the wild on day one on the switch and you go to the, the forest

3686
03:37:38,405 --> 03:37:42,205
Speaker 23:  where the master sword is like, it's choppy. It was choppy then

3687
03:37:42,465 --> 03:37:44,525
Speaker 23:  it was choppy seven years ago. You know, I was

3688
03:37:44,525 --> 03:37:48,005
Speaker 24:  Like, FIFA will look like a bunch of potatoes or on a big green field.

3689
03:37:48,425 --> 03:37:51,525
Speaker 24:  But, but you'll be, but you'll know what those potatoes are and you'll be

3690
03:37:51,525 --> 03:37:55,445
Speaker 24:  able to control all the little potatoes. So like if the control of

3691
03:37:55,445 --> 03:37:59,125
Speaker 24:  the potatoes is important and not how they look, the switch could be

3692
03:37:59,425 --> 03:38:02,285
Speaker 24:  an option. 'cause there's a lot of good deals right now because there's

3693
03:38:02,285 --> 03:38:05,685
Speaker 24:  a ton of different ones. Like I, I just recently picked up the, the new

3694
03:38:05,885 --> 03:38:09,485
Speaker 24:  Zelda one because somebody left it on a plane and I bought it at a thrift

3695
03:38:09,485 --> 03:38:09,685
Speaker 24:  store.

3696
03:38:10,035 --> 03:38:11,805
Speaker 23:  Have you played the new Ilda yet?

3697
03:38:11,965 --> 03:38:15,725
Speaker 5:  I have. So I actually have an OG switch and it

3698
03:38:15,725 --> 03:38:18,885
Speaker 5:  worked great and I loved it very much. And then it got to the point where

3699
03:38:18,885 --> 03:38:22,725
Speaker 5:  literally the battery lasts like six minutes. Like it's, it's fine.

3700
03:38:22,825 --> 03:38:26,725
Speaker 5:  The thing is seven years old, I got a lot of love out of it. I used it for

3701
03:38:26,725 --> 03:38:30,085
Speaker 5:  a long time and it just basically doesn't work anymore. And so now it's just

3702
03:38:30,085 --> 03:38:31,925
Speaker 5:  like a pretty yellow thing that sits over there.

3703
03:38:32,345 --> 03:38:35,365
Speaker 23:  Do not trade that in because if it's an original switch that the battery

3704
03:38:35,365 --> 03:38:38,885
Speaker 23:  is six minutes, it also means that it is hackable and you can do fun things

3705
03:38:38,885 --> 03:38:40,485
Speaker 23:  with it and it's worth money. Okay. So

3706
03:38:40,685 --> 03:38:44,645
Speaker 5:  I deal. Okay, well that's David's side business in selling

3707
03:38:44,785 --> 03:38:47,965
Speaker 5:  old gadgets is is a whole nother thing you and I should do on this show,

3708
03:38:48,035 --> 03:38:51,925
Speaker 5:  Sean. So yeah, So I think one of the outcomes I'm afraid

3709
03:38:51,945 --> 03:38:55,885
Speaker 5:  of is that the answer is just wait a year because there's gonna

3710
03:38:55,885 --> 03:38:58,405
Speaker 5:  be a new switch and they might fix windows and maybe we'll get the Xbox thing.

3711
03:38:58,405 --> 03:39:01,605
Speaker 5:  And it feels like in a weird way, we're in like a bad middle zone between

3712
03:39:01,795 --> 03:39:02,325
Speaker 5:  good things.

3713
03:39:03,105 --> 03:39:07,085
Speaker 24:  No, you need to get this steam deck with Ola and just be done and happy.

3714
03:39:07,605 --> 03:39:11,325
Speaker 23:  I think what you need to do is you need to unlock, you need to unlock

3715
03:39:11,765 --> 03:39:15,605
Speaker 23:  a mountain of amazing PC games you've been missing that are

3716
03:39:15,605 --> 03:39:19,565
Speaker 23:  incredibly cheap and brilliant and beautiful and ru on this

3717
03:39:19,565 --> 03:39:22,125
Speaker 23:  handheld with an amazing screen. That's what you need to do.

3718
03:39:22,505 --> 03:39:23,645
Speaker 24:  And it's also hackable,

3719
03:39:23,995 --> 03:39:27,725
Speaker 5:  Sean, I gave you one game, one game that I need to play

3720
03:39:27,985 --> 03:39:31,245
Speaker 5:  and you're telling me that I can have everything I want except the one game

3721
03:39:31,275 --> 03:39:32,125
Speaker 5:  that I need to play.

3722
03:39:32,425 --> 03:39:35,725
Speaker 23:  If you wanna play Fortnite on there, it doesn't do that either. So unless

3723
03:39:35,725 --> 03:39:36,965
Speaker 23:  you're gonna stream that, I

3724
03:39:36,965 --> 03:39:40,085
Speaker 5:  Literally, I almost wrote down that the two games were Fortnite and fifa

3725
03:39:40,085 --> 03:39:43,405
Speaker 5:  and I decided I could live without Fortnite because there are other good,

3726
03:39:43,405 --> 03:39:47,085
Speaker 5:  okay, David has an hour to kill Battle Royale games out there. I could, I

3727
03:39:47,085 --> 03:39:49,245
Speaker 5:  could take or leave Fortnite at this point in my life. I was

3728
03:39:49,245 --> 03:39:50,285
Speaker 24:  Like, you can just use our iPad.

3729
03:39:50,555 --> 03:39:54,045
Speaker 5:  That is, that is true. So let me float another idea by you,

3730
03:39:54,375 --> 03:39:58,125
Speaker 5:  which is that I, instead of buying one thing, I buy

3731
03:39:58,125 --> 03:40:02,085
Speaker 5:  several things and, and I just yes, acknowledge

3732
03:40:02,085 --> 03:40:05,845
Speaker 5:  that at least for this next phase of my life, the right thing to do is

3733
03:40:05,865 --> 03:40:09,005
Speaker 5:  get a PS five and a PS portal

3734
03:40:09,785 --> 03:40:13,485
Speaker 5:  for my house projects and then I get a steam deck for

3735
03:40:13,485 --> 03:40:17,205
Speaker 5:  travel. I have just quadrupled the amount of money that this is

3736
03:40:17,205 --> 03:40:18,845
Speaker 5:  costing. Is this the outcome?

3737
03:40:19,375 --> 03:40:23,125
Speaker 24:  Don't do that. Save your money. Just get like,

3738
03:40:23,455 --> 03:40:27,445
Speaker 24:  never ever, ever, ever, ever buy a portal unless you

3739
03:40:27,515 --> 03:40:31,365
Speaker 24:  just have zero computer skills. If you

3740
03:40:31,365 --> 03:40:35,205
Speaker 24:  have none whatsoever. If all you do, If you like, struggle to turn

3741
03:40:35,205 --> 03:40:37,485
Speaker 24:  your phone on, get the PSP portal. People

3742
03:40:37,485 --> 03:40:41,205
Speaker 23:  Love the portal. There, there are people who love the portal. It is selling

3743
03:40:41,305 --> 03:40:44,965
Speaker 23:  really well. I would never touch one except to like

3744
03:40:45,505 --> 03:40:49,405
Speaker 23:  to have the knowledge of having touched one because the steam deck

3745
03:40:49,665 --> 03:40:53,645
Speaker 23:  has an app on it. And the app is the PS portal. Yeah. That's in an app for

3746
03:40:53,645 --> 03:40:57,325
Speaker 23:  your steam deck. Yeah, basically it's, it's called chiaki

3747
03:40:57,465 --> 03:41:00,765
Speaker 23:  chiaki for deck. And it, it works great. Just make sure your PS five, your

3748
03:41:00,785 --> 03:41:03,365
Speaker 23:  PS four has an ethernet cable plugged into it or it will not work very well.

3749
03:41:03,475 --> 03:41:03,765
Speaker 23:  Okay.

3750
03:41:04,055 --> 03:41:04,405
Speaker 5:  Don't

3751
03:41:04,405 --> 03:41:08,125
Speaker 24:  Get the PS portal because that is, that's for like, that's for people who

3752
03:41:08,435 --> 03:41:11,685
Speaker 24:  love to game and don't have a lot of computer skills and so they're like,

3753
03:41:11,685 --> 03:41:15,525
Speaker 24:  okay, I just need to go play right now. And that's great,

3754
03:41:15,705 --> 03:41:19,085
Speaker 24:  but like you spend a little bit more money, you get the steam deck, you

3755
03:41:19,085 --> 03:41:22,045
Speaker 24:  spend a little extra time and you have just way more capability.

3756
03:41:22,315 --> 03:41:25,765
Speaker 5:  Okay. So, all right, so let me, let me play out this scenario. So

3757
03:41:26,105 --> 03:41:29,605
Speaker 5:  what's happening here is I, I'm going to

3758
03:41:30,115 --> 03:41:34,045
Speaker 5:  make sure that my PlayStation streaming setup is as good

3759
03:41:34,045 --> 03:41:37,925
Speaker 5:  as possible. I'm going to make sure that I have an ethernet port. I'm

3760
03:41:37,925 --> 03:41:41,885
Speaker 5:  gonna, I'm gonna plug my PlayStation into the Euro gateway and not

3761
03:41:41,885 --> 03:41:45,845
Speaker 5:  the euro in the basement. I'm gonna, I'm gonna make sure that my internet

3762
03:41:45,845 --> 03:41:49,565
Speaker 5:  connection for my PlayStation is as good as possible. TBD on whether

3763
03:41:49,565 --> 03:41:52,685
Speaker 5:  that's gonna be a PS four or PS five, we're gonna see how poor I feel at

3764
03:41:52,685 --> 03:41:56,565
Speaker 5:  the end of this episode, but that, that essentially becomes my like, dedicated

3765
03:41:56,635 --> 03:42:00,525
Speaker 5:  FIFA machine, which is an absurd place to have landed. But again, here

3766
03:42:00,525 --> 03:42:00,805
Speaker 5:  we are.

3767
03:42:00,985 --> 03:42:03,045
Speaker 23:  If you've already got the PS four, I mean, why not?

3768
03:42:03,425 --> 03:42:07,085
Speaker 5:  So that I'm, I'm relegating this thing to being my FIFA machine, and then

3769
03:42:07,625 --> 03:42:11,605
Speaker 5:  I'm going to download the app you just said for the steam deck for when I

3770
03:42:11,605 --> 03:42:14,765
Speaker 5:  wanna play FIFA and I'm gonna play FIFA on the steam deck through my PlayStation,

3771
03:42:14,765 --> 03:42:18,245
Speaker 5:  which seems ludicrous, but you're telling me will kind of sort of work. As

3772
03:42:18,245 --> 03:42:19,405
Speaker 5:  long as I have very good internet,

3773
03:42:19,735 --> 03:42:20,165
Speaker 24:  It'll work

3774
03:42:20,165 --> 03:42:24,125
Speaker 23:  Great inside your house. Remote is theoretically possible, but you'll play

3775
03:42:24,125 --> 03:42:25,365
Speaker 23:  it in your house realistically.

3776
03:42:25,625 --> 03:42:29,085
Speaker 5:  So I've, I've, that's my solution to the, how do I play on my couch

3777
03:42:29,155 --> 03:42:32,885
Speaker 5:  instead of in the basement problem. Great. For everything else,

3778
03:42:33,385 --> 03:42:36,925
Speaker 5:  I'm just going to broaden my horizons and play less FIFA and play more other

3779
03:42:36,925 --> 03:42:39,445
Speaker 5:  games. This is what you're telling me. This is, this is where I need to land.

3780
03:42:40,005 --> 03:42:43,965
Speaker 24:  I, I feel like you can find a really good FIFA clone, but like they all

3781
03:42:43,965 --> 03:42:47,645
Speaker 24:  have swords or something. I like, I feel like this exists.

3782
03:42:47,715 --> 03:42:49,765
Speaker 24:  Someone's made this game at Alpha.

3783
03:42:50,185 --> 03:42:53,885
Speaker 5:  So what is ironically possible is that because

3784
03:42:54,445 --> 03:42:58,005
Speaker 5:  EA Sports FC is no longer called fifa, somebody else is making a FIFA game

3785
03:42:58,005 --> 03:43:00,765
Speaker 5:  and maybe that FIFA game will be on the steam deck, which will solve all

3786
03:43:00,765 --> 03:43:04,365
Speaker 5:  of my problems all at once. This is, this is what I'm hoping for done and

3787
03:43:04,365 --> 03:43:07,885
Speaker 23:  Also you'll write about this experience hopefully for The Verge and then

3788
03:43:08,165 --> 03:43:10,205
Speaker 23:  EA will start taking care of its shit.

3789
03:43:10,595 --> 03:43:14,365
Speaker 5:  Okay, so ea very large company makes a lot of very popular games. Is there

3790
03:43:14,425 --> 03:43:17,845
Speaker 5:  any hope for EA on the steam deck ever? Like should I have any optimism for

3791
03:43:17,845 --> 03:43:20,685
Speaker 5:  that to be a thing? The steam deck's very popular. What are we doing here?

3792
03:43:20,755 --> 03:43:24,165
Speaker 23:  Yeah, I mean they just, they just break things willy-nilly and they don't

3793
03:43:24,165 --> 03:43:26,285
Speaker 23:  think about it. It's not like they don't want money. Yeah.

3794
03:43:26,405 --> 03:43:30,325
Speaker 24:  EA is like kind of notorious for being one of the worst

3795
03:43:30,725 --> 03:43:34,325
Speaker 24:  companies in the United States. Like I think when Consumerist existed it

3796
03:43:34,345 --> 03:43:37,565
Speaker 24:  was regularly beating cable companies Oh boy. For being the worst

3797
03:43:37,955 --> 03:43:41,925
Speaker 24:  because they just, they, they put money ahead of usability

3798
03:43:42,285 --> 03:43:45,925
Speaker 24:  frequently and so they could fix it, but I don't think they have a whole

3799
03:43:45,925 --> 03:43:49,165
Speaker 24:  lot of interest because most of their players, the bulk of their audience

3800
03:43:49,625 --> 03:43:52,645
Speaker 24:  is not, is, you know, it's on the switch. It's on the, the PlayStation.

3801
03:43:53,115 --> 03:43:56,085
Speaker 5:  Okay. One other steam deck question. The, the one other thing I forgot to

3802
03:43:56,085 --> 03:44:00,045
Speaker 5:  mention is I do wanna be able to plug this thing into a large screen

3803
03:44:00,065 --> 03:44:03,845
Speaker 5:  and play it. I don't think that's like the most common use case for me,

3804
03:44:03,905 --> 03:44:07,885
Speaker 5:  but I do want to be able to sit in front of a television and play it like

3805
03:44:07,965 --> 03:44:11,725
Speaker 5:  a console as I normally would. And for me with the switch, I have done that

3806
03:44:11,725 --> 03:44:15,685
Speaker 5:  way less than I expected because you have to have such specific hardware

3807
03:44:15,705 --> 03:44:18,565
Speaker 5:  to pull that off and like carrying around the dock is annoying. And I bought

3808
03:44:18,625 --> 03:44:22,405
Speaker 5:  the little plug thing and that helped, but then I lost that. And So I

3809
03:44:22,565 --> 03:44:26,085
Speaker 5:  want, I want something that is a little easier to turn into like a full fledged

3810
03:44:26,085 --> 03:44:28,605
Speaker 5:  console when I want to, is the steam deck good at that?

3811
03:44:29,025 --> 03:44:32,925
Speaker 24:  You're still gonna need a little dongle. Okay. To, to mirror

3812
03:44:32,925 --> 03:44:33,285
Speaker 24:  things.

3813
03:44:33,505 --> 03:44:34,325
Speaker 23:  Dongle or dock.

3814
03:44:34,325 --> 03:44:36,805
Speaker 24:  Yeah, you're gonna need a dongle or dock. I think the official one's like

3815
03:44:36,805 --> 03:44:37,965
Speaker 24:  what, a hundred dollars Sean?

3816
03:44:38,355 --> 03:44:41,885
Speaker 23:  It's less, it's, I wanna say 70, 80, something like that. But you can buy

3817
03:44:42,075 --> 03:44:45,805
Speaker 23:  much cheaper than that. I'd used like an off the shelf like $35

3818
03:44:46,125 --> 03:44:50,045
Speaker 23:  USBC hub that had HDMI that worked. I used docs

3819
03:44:50,045 --> 03:44:53,965
Speaker 23:  from like Js A-J-S-A-U-X, great company with an alphabet

3820
03:44:53,965 --> 03:44:57,885
Speaker 23:  soup name surprisingly 40, 50 bucks. And those docs are, do all the

3821
03:44:57,885 --> 03:45:01,285
Speaker 23:  things you'd want from a doc. It's really easy once you get one of those

3822
03:45:01,285 --> 03:45:05,205
Speaker 23:  things to get it up there. The question is, is your TV like 4K and

3823
03:45:05,205 --> 03:45:08,845
Speaker 23:  you're expecting 4K visuals from a console that normally plays at 800 because

3824
03:45:09,355 --> 03:45:12,165
Speaker 23:  it's not gonna look as good up on a big 4K tv

3825
03:45:12,645 --> 03:45:16,485
Speaker 5:  I will say, and Liam or producer can vouch for this. The least forge

3826
03:45:16,575 --> 03:45:19,885
Speaker 5:  casty thing about me is I don't care all that much about pixel density. So

3827
03:45:19,945 --> 03:45:23,525
Speaker 5:  the idea of playing like at, you know, medium settings and having it work

3828
03:45:23,525 --> 03:45:24,725
Speaker 5:  okay is completely fine with

3829
03:45:24,725 --> 03:45:27,325
Speaker 24:  Me. I just heard Neli screaming,

3830
03:45:27,475 --> 03:45:30,925
Speaker 5:  This is the last time you'll ever hear from me, me on The Vergecast. But

3831
03:45:30,925 --> 03:45:33,965
Speaker 5:  that is, that is where I'm at and especially with something like this, like

3832
03:45:33,965 --> 03:45:37,205
Speaker 5:  battery life is much more important to me than like getting

3833
03:45:37,785 --> 03:45:41,565
Speaker 5:  10 extra frames per second. And So I think again, the customizability of

3834
03:45:41,565 --> 03:45:45,165
Speaker 5:  the steam deck to be able to like dial that up and down as I want it seems

3835
03:45:45,825 --> 03:45:46,245
Speaker 5:  useful.

3836
03:45:46,785 --> 03:45:50,645
Speaker 24:  You wanna steam deck ole, like get the steam deck ole every

3837
03:45:50,645 --> 03:45:53,965
Speaker 24:  once in a while you'll plug it into the tv, you'll be like, oh, I did it.

3838
03:45:54,395 --> 03:45:57,565
Speaker 24:  This looks kind of shitty. And then you'll unplug it and go back to the

3839
03:45:57,565 --> 03:45:59,565
Speaker 24:  really pretty ole display and be very happy.

3840
03:46:00,125 --> 03:46:03,765
Speaker 5:  I do suspect my switch experience has been that I set it up in

3841
03:46:03,835 --> 03:46:06,685
Speaker 5:  such a way that it was gonna be really easy to dock. It was gonna be great.

3842
03:46:06,705 --> 03:46:09,605
Speaker 5:  And then most of the time I would sit on my couch in front of the TV and

3843
03:46:09,605 --> 03:46:13,045
Speaker 5:  just play on my lap and I, I would assume the steam deck will end up being

3844
03:46:13,045 --> 03:46:14,165
Speaker 5:  kind of the same way. Yep.

3845
03:46:14,315 --> 03:46:17,125
Speaker 23:  It's so good. My, we will watch, watch some shows together with my wife

3846
03:46:17,145 --> 03:46:20,725
Speaker 23:  and I'll, I'll have my hand held out and get to do some, some gaming at

3847
03:46:20,725 --> 03:46:21,925
Speaker 23:  the same time. It's great. Okay.

3848
03:46:22,145 --> 03:46:26,005
Speaker 5:  Are there any other like crazy wild card possibilities

3849
03:46:26,145 --> 03:46:29,965
Speaker 5:  coming that we know of that might win? Like you, you mentioned the, the

3850
03:46:30,045 --> 03:46:33,965
Speaker 5:  RIX seems like a possible improvement

3851
03:46:34,025 --> 03:46:37,805
Speaker 5:  if not sort of equal to the steam deck. Is there anything else on the

3852
03:46:37,805 --> 03:46:40,805
Speaker 5:  horizon that in three months I'm gonna be like, oh, this is the one I needed?

3853
03:46:41,325 --> 03:46:41,725
Speaker 5:  I don't

3854
03:46:41,725 --> 03:46:45,605
Speaker 23:  Think so, but there are two very different directions

3855
03:46:45,605 --> 03:46:48,845
Speaker 23:  you could go and I don't have one of them here in front of me, but one of

3856
03:46:48,845 --> 03:46:52,645
Speaker 23:  them is a 10.1 inch laptop with like

3857
03:46:53,115 --> 03:46:56,965
Speaker 23:  keys that actually feel good full size SD card reader. You could

3858
03:46:57,085 --> 03:47:00,725
Speaker 23:  actually shove the SD card all the way inside. We've got full size

3859
03:47:00,885 --> 03:47:02,245
Speaker 23:  USBA ports,

3860
03:47:02,465 --> 03:47:04,005
Speaker 24:  It has more ports than a MacBook

3861
03:47:04,405 --> 03:47:08,085
Speaker 23:  USBC ports. There's an OCU link port HDMI,

3862
03:47:08,385 --> 03:47:11,405
Speaker 23:  it is your doc built into it. And then you take these little things off

3863
03:47:11,865 --> 03:47:15,765
Speaker 23:  and you got joysticks a deep head and even even this,

3864
03:47:15,965 --> 03:47:19,285
Speaker 23:  this menu button in the center acts like an Xbox button, which for some

3865
03:47:19,285 --> 03:47:23,045
Speaker 23:  reason none of the other winds handhelds have. And this thing

3866
03:47:23,105 --> 03:47:26,925
Speaker 23:  is way expensive. I mean, it's twice the price of your steam deck.

3867
03:47:26,945 --> 03:47:30,805
Speaker 23:  It costs more than any of the handhelds, but it doubles as a laptop. It

3868
03:47:30,805 --> 03:47:34,765
Speaker 23:  has the power of one of those other gaming handhelds in a decent sized battery,

3869
03:47:34,825 --> 03:47:36,285
Speaker 23:  all this stuff. But Sean,

3870
03:47:36,775 --> 03:47:38,285
Speaker 24:  How's it, how is it to play?

3871
03:47:39,185 --> 03:47:42,805
Speaker 23:  It is a laptop first and a game

3872
03:47:42,845 --> 03:47:43,805
Speaker 23:  handheld second.

3873
03:47:44,195 --> 03:47:47,805
Speaker 5:  It's such a perfect gadget because that is both the stupidest thing I've

3874
03:47:47,805 --> 03:47:49,365
Speaker 5:  ever seen and I want it so bad.

3875
03:47:49,715 --> 03:47:53,045
Speaker 24:  Yeah, right. It's beautiful. It's

3876
03:47:53,045 --> 03:47:56,605
Speaker 5:  Like what if instead of the touch bar, we just put a PlayStation controller

3877
03:47:56,665 --> 03:47:58,325
Speaker 5:  in pieces, like I love it.

3878
03:47:59,445 --> 03:48:02,925
Speaker 23:  I I can't get, I can't get over the boss mode. Like, like you got this thing

3879
03:48:03,105 --> 03:48:06,885
Speaker 23:  and you're like, no, I can't show my game pad at work. Let's take this little

3880
03:48:06,975 --> 03:48:10,085
Speaker 23:  metal, let's take this little slip of metal outta the back of the thing

3881
03:48:10,385 --> 03:48:13,965
Speaker 23:  and and drop it on top boss mode. It's a physical boss mode.

3882
03:48:14,115 --> 03:48:17,805
Speaker 23:  Yeah. Okay, moving on from that. Okay, so your, your other

3883
03:48:17,805 --> 03:48:21,445
Speaker 23:  possibility If you could embrace, you could embrace software

3884
03:48:21,665 --> 03:48:25,525
Speaker 23:  piracy and you could buy one of these things, which is

3885
03:48:25,525 --> 03:48:28,885
Speaker 23:  looks like a Game boy advance sp this is the Vernick feg

3886
03:48:29,705 --> 03:48:33,685
Speaker 23:  but actually just comes with thousands of pirated games and, and so

3887
03:48:33,685 --> 03:48:36,365
Speaker 23:  you could play all your Game Boy Advance and PlayStation games on this.

3888
03:48:36,775 --> 03:48:40,525
Speaker 23:  Maybe you delete the pirated games first and dump your own ROS or something

3889
03:48:40,525 --> 03:48:40,805
Speaker 23:  like that,

3890
03:48:41,145 --> 03:48:41,925
Speaker 5:  As I always do.

3891
03:48:42,025 --> 03:48:43,285
Speaker 23:  As you do. Yes. I

3892
03:48:43,285 --> 03:48:47,125
Speaker 24:  Feel like Berg's already gonna get wrecked for you just saying. Yeah, it

3893
03:48:47,125 --> 03:48:49,165
Speaker 24:  comes with all of the pirated games on it. Every

3894
03:48:49,165 --> 03:48:52,125
Speaker 5:  Time Sean talks about one of these, there was, I think you did a, you did

3895
03:48:52,125 --> 03:48:55,645
Speaker 5:  a TikTok Sean talking about the, the new Amber Brunick thing and every single

3896
03:48:55,645 --> 03:48:58,845
Speaker 5:  comment was like, Sean, be cool man. Stop telling people about

3897
03:48:59,575 --> 03:49:00,285
Speaker 5:  gimme my freak.

3898
03:49:00,385 --> 03:49:00,845
Speaker 23:  It was

3899
03:49:01,345 --> 03:49:05,125
Speaker 24:  TikTok shop is all over this thing. Like it's been

3900
03:49:05,125 --> 03:49:05,965
Speaker 24:  snitched on enough.

3901
03:49:06,235 --> 03:49:09,845
Speaker 23:  Just to illustrate though that the ea the ea FIFA game

3902
03:49:10,545 --> 03:49:14,165
Speaker 23:  is not a steam deck problem. The top comment on EA sports

3903
03:49:14,445 --> 03:49:18,165
Speaker 23:  FC 24 is EAFC 24 not launching on

3904
03:49:18,345 --> 03:49:22,205
Speaker 23:  PC after anti sheet back to EA f Oh. So it's not a steam deck

3905
03:49:22,205 --> 03:49:24,605
Speaker 23:  thing so much as it is an EA doesn't care thing.

3906
03:49:25,205 --> 03:49:29,045
Speaker 5:  Interesting. Okay. So it it truly is ea is like, there are ways

3907
03:49:29,065 --> 03:49:32,405
Speaker 5:  you could get around the rules that we have. So we're just taking our ball

3908
03:49:32,405 --> 03:49:35,445
Speaker 5:  and going home. Yep. That doesn't feel like it's getting better anytime soon.

3909
03:49:35,475 --> 03:49:39,325
Speaker 5:  That, that does not give me hope for the, for improvements coming here, which

3910
03:49:39,355 --> 03:49:42,925
Speaker 5:  also means, listen, there's, there's a lot of sports games. This means I

3911
03:49:42,925 --> 03:49:46,285
Speaker 5:  can't play anymore, but now I'm gonna have to get into like cool nerd games.

3912
03:49:46,355 --> 03:49:46,925
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be great.

3913
03:49:47,185 --> 03:49:49,125
Speaker 24:  You, you can play 'em streaming.

3914
03:49:49,265 --> 03:49:52,445
Speaker 5:  That's true. Steam deck plus game pass I think is starting to feel like the

3915
03:49:52,465 --> 03:49:54,245
Speaker 5:  reales answer I have here.

3916
03:49:54,545 --> 03:49:58,205
Speaker 24:  You'll have Halo and fifa, like you'll be the,

3917
03:49:58,385 --> 03:50:01,125
Speaker 24:  the hit of every frat party you go to. Okay,

3918
03:50:01,795 --> 03:50:05,645
Speaker 5:  Last question and then, and then we have to go, am

3919
03:50:05,685 --> 03:50:08,605
Speaker 5:  I stupid for buying a steam deck right now in the same way that I might be

3920
03:50:08,605 --> 03:50:12,005
Speaker 5:  stupid for buying a switch right now? Where are we in the steam deck cycle?

3921
03:50:12,455 --> 03:50:13,205
Speaker 24:  We're fine, right?

3922
03:50:13,535 --> 03:50:17,085
Speaker 23:  We're mid, yeah, we're, we're mid cycle. We're not late

3923
03:50:17,425 --> 03:50:20,405
Speaker 23:  yet. The thing that, the thing that valve needs, they've, they've told us,

3924
03:50:20,435 --> 03:50:24,325
Speaker 23:  like told me to my face, what they need to see is they

3925
03:50:24,325 --> 03:50:28,085
Speaker 23:  need to see a major improvement in performance without

3926
03:50:28,445 --> 03:50:32,285
Speaker 23:  sacrificing battery life from a chip manufacturer before

3927
03:50:32,285 --> 03:50:36,085
Speaker 23:  they start building the next true steam deck. And I've heard this from

3928
03:50:36,085 --> 03:50:39,485
Speaker 23:  other companies too, like as with the, with the R-O-G-L-I-X, they were like,

3929
03:50:39,665 --> 03:50:42,925
Speaker 23:  we don't think we can get it right now, so we're gonna ship the wrong LIX

3930
03:50:43,075 --> 03:50:44,005
Speaker 23:  with the same chip.

3931
03:50:44,265 --> 03:50:48,085
Speaker 24:  And I don't think Qualcomm has changed that calculus at all. Yeah.

3932
03:50:48,085 --> 03:50:49,085
Speaker 24:  With the snap track and,

3933
03:50:49,265 --> 03:50:52,885
Speaker 5:  And even if it has, we're a ways away from that actually appearing inside

3934
03:50:52,885 --> 03:50:53,405
Speaker 5:  of a product.

3935
03:50:53,715 --> 03:50:56,845
Speaker 24:  Yeah, I think, I think we're probably a good, we're at least a year out.

3936
03:50:57,005 --> 03:51:00,925
Speaker 24:  I think you'll have one beautiful blissful year before you get FOMO at

3937
03:51:00,925 --> 03:51:01,205
Speaker 24:  least.

3938
03:51:01,715 --> 03:51:04,605
Speaker 5:  Okay. And that's, I mean, honestly in Gadget world, that's just, that's all

3939
03:51:04,605 --> 03:51:05,165
Speaker 5:  you can ask for.

3940
03:51:05,755 --> 03:51:09,205
Speaker 24:  It's like a year is an, is is an eternity in gadget world. I mean,

3941
03:51:09,205 --> 03:51:12,365
Speaker 5:  Listen, I've made it this far into the PS five cycle without upgrading. Like

3942
03:51:12,365 --> 03:51:15,845
Speaker 5:  it turns out I can, I can manage my FOMO on, on This one. I

3943
03:51:15,845 --> 03:51:17,005
Speaker 24:  Am so impressed.

3944
03:51:17,295 --> 03:51:20,165
Speaker 5:  Thank you. That's actually the other question I should ask is like, am I

3945
03:51:20,165 --> 03:51:22,645
Speaker 5:  being ridiculous? Should I just buy a PS five and move on with my life?

3946
03:51:23,065 --> 03:51:23,285
Speaker 23:  Ooh.

3947
03:51:24,085 --> 03:51:27,485
Speaker 24:  I mean, have infinite, If you have infinite money, yes.

3948
03:51:27,905 --> 03:51:31,485
Speaker 5:  If I buy a PS five, I almost certainly will end up buying a portal

3949
03:51:31,865 --> 03:51:34,485
Speaker 5:  and I, I hate myself for it, but it will probably happen

3950
03:51:35,115 --> 03:51:37,925
Speaker 24:  Then I say don't, because I wanna save you from the portal.

3951
03:51:38,305 --> 03:51:41,845
Speaker 23:  You could buy a used Steve Deck LCD for the price of a portal and also have

3952
03:51:41,845 --> 03:51:43,525
Speaker 23:  a portal built into it with an app.

3953
03:51:43,825 --> 03:51:45,005
Speaker 5:  Oh, well that's very compelling.

3954
03:51:45,185 --> 03:51:49,045
Speaker 23:  But PS five, like If you do love that I'm sitting on

3955
03:51:49,045 --> 03:51:52,965
Speaker 23:  my couch with my 4K Oli TV experience, it's

3956
03:51:53,035 --> 03:51:56,445
Speaker 23:  hard to beat the PS five for that. I'm playing Spider-Man two on it right

3957
03:51:56,445 --> 03:52:00,165
Speaker 23:  now on a just a gorgeous new Oli panel that was deep discounted

3958
03:52:00,365 --> 03:52:04,245
Speaker 23:  recently and wow. The pop of that city, the lights

3959
03:52:04,305 --> 03:52:06,485
Speaker 23:  at night. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's really something.

3960
03:52:06,595 --> 03:52:10,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I, and I do love that, but I think I, I am increasingly coming

3961
03:52:10,485 --> 03:52:14,165
Speaker 5:  around to like, having a thing with me is

3962
03:52:14,395 --> 03:52:18,165
Speaker 5:  more important than the sort of very best possible experience.

3963
03:52:18,685 --> 03:52:21,885
Speaker 5:  I I would love to have both, but I don't think you can really have both right

3964
03:52:21,885 --> 03:52:23,045
Speaker 5:  now in the world we live in.

3965
03:52:23,345 --> 03:52:26,685
Speaker 23:  And If you, If you really want to have that thing with you, I don't think

3966
03:52:26,685 --> 03:52:29,885
Speaker 23:  there's anything that beats the steam deck. There's just so much you can

3967
03:52:29,905 --> 03:52:33,725
Speaker 23:  now take with you that you can't the same way through the window as handhelds.

3968
03:52:34,025 --> 03:52:35,805
Speaker 23:  You can't really with Android. All

3969
03:52:35,805 --> 03:52:39,605
Speaker 5:  Right, well we have ended where we began, which I find very frustrating,

3970
03:52:39,605 --> 03:52:43,085
Speaker 5:  but also sort of telling I'm gonna buy a steam deck. Yeah. I probably should

3971
03:52:43,085 --> 03:52:45,765
Speaker 5:  have bought a steam deck a really long time ago. I'm gonna buy a steam deck

3972
03:52:46,025 --> 03:52:49,725
Speaker 5:  and I I will start yelling loudly at EA and I'll report back.

3973
03:52:50,145 --> 03:52:53,005
Speaker 24:  I'm so excited for you. Everybody's excited about the EA though.

3974
03:52:53,265 --> 03:52:56,405
Speaker 5:  Do you have any immediate setup tips before we talk again? I will have purchased

3975
03:52:56,485 --> 03:52:59,885
Speaker 5:  a steam deck. What, what should I do? Immediately outta the box with my brand

3976
03:52:59,885 --> 03:53:00,685
Speaker 5:  new Steam deck O lead.

3977
03:53:00,845 --> 03:53:03,405
Speaker 23:  I have so many nerdy suggestions. I

3978
03:53:03,405 --> 03:53:06,245
Speaker 5:  Don't want nerdy suggestions, Sean. I say this with love, I want, I want

3979
03:53:06,245 --> 03:53:06,405
Speaker 5:  get

3980
03:53:06,465 --> 03:53:07,165
Speaker 23:  To, I know I was like

3981
03:53:07,555 --> 03:53:11,365
Speaker 5:  Playing games well as quickly and seamlessly as possible.

3982
03:53:11,365 --> 03:53:14,645
Speaker 5:  Like I am worried about the steam deck because I'm worried it's so fidgety

3983
03:53:14,645 --> 03:53:17,965
Speaker 5:  and finicky that I'm gonna spend my whole life goofing with the joysticks

3984
03:53:18,025 --> 03:53:19,405
Speaker 5:  and not playing games.

3985
03:53:20,065 --> 03:53:24,005
Speaker 24:  So, so Steam Deck has this, like on the steam deck they have compatibility

3986
03:53:24,025 --> 03:53:27,525
Speaker 24:  for games and you can also see it on the Steam software. So like you can

3987
03:53:27,525 --> 03:53:30,525
Speaker 24:  just go download steam ahead of time, find some games you like, make sure

3988
03:53:30,525 --> 03:53:34,085
Speaker 24:  they're compatible and then it'll be just out of the box ready to go. Anything

3989
03:53:34,085 --> 03:53:38,005
Speaker 24:  that's like yellow or red, you'll have to mess with a little bit. That's

3990
03:53:38,005 --> 03:53:40,925
Speaker 24:  where you have to start tweaking things. Like I try to play Crusader Kings

3991
03:53:40,925 --> 03:53:44,285
Speaker 24:  on it. Don't, that's it's not for the Steam deck. It's terrible.

3992
03:53:44,595 --> 03:53:48,245
Speaker 23:  There's even a tab in the store where you can just like, only show me games

3993
03:53:48,245 --> 03:53:51,845
Speaker 23:  that work well with the Steam deck. And for the most part they do.

3994
03:53:52,275 --> 03:53:55,565
Speaker 24:  They Yeah, and it's, it's a lot of stuff, right? Like, it, it's, it's a

3995
03:53:55,645 --> 03:53:58,565
Speaker 24:  ton of stuff. The ones that don't is stuff that's like mass effect, which

3996
03:53:58,585 --> 03:54:01,525
Speaker 24:  is an EA game. So you know why it doesn't work. Well,

3997
03:54:01,965 --> 03:54:05,285
Speaker 5:  I will say the other game in my life that I have loved with my whole heart,

3998
03:54:05,305 --> 03:54:09,085
Speaker 5:  the way that I have loved FIFA with my whole heart is portal. And the idea

3999
03:54:09,085 --> 03:54:12,325
Speaker 5:  of having a steam thing that will let me play the portal games forever is

4000
03:54:12,325 --> 03:54:12,845
Speaker 5:  very exciting.

4001
03:54:13,185 --> 03:54:16,365
Speaker 24:  And it will just straight out of the box, you'll be, you'll be off to the

4002
03:54:16,365 --> 03:54:20,285
Speaker 24:  races having a great time. Yeah. It, it really is so easy to just get

4003
03:54:20,285 --> 03:54:23,965
Speaker 24:  going on the steam deck provided you already own games.

4004
03:54:24,775 --> 03:54:28,605
Speaker 23:  Elden Ring plays well there, Ori and The Will of the

4005
03:54:28,655 --> 03:54:31,405
Speaker 23:  Wisps. If you haven't played that yet, play that on the De Lid. Haven't.

4006
03:54:31,405 --> 03:54:34,405
Speaker 23:  Okay. Oh my God, it looks brilliant. On the deco lid, that game is made

4007
03:54:34,405 --> 03:54:37,885
Speaker 23:  for HDR Persona five. Have you played any persona games?

4008
03:54:38,195 --> 03:54:40,845
Speaker 5:  Bits and pieces, but never, never super deeply. Okay.

4009
03:54:41,145 --> 03:54:44,685
Speaker 23:  Get Persona five or Persona five, Royal, whichever one is better for your

4010
03:54:44,685 --> 03:54:48,365
Speaker 23:  budget. Play that on Steam Deck. It's, it's, it's epic.

4011
03:54:48,665 --> 03:54:51,245
Speaker 23:  We could, we could spend the rest, you spend, spend another hour talking

4012
03:54:51,245 --> 03:54:52,085
Speaker 23:  about games to play on.

4013
03:54:52,115 --> 03:54:55,325
Speaker 24:  Yeah, I was about to say have, have you played Final Fantasy remake yet?

4014
03:54:55,355 --> 03:54:57,165
Speaker 24:  Like beautiful on the Steam deck.

4015
03:54:57,165 --> 03:55:00,285
Speaker 5:  Okay. All right. My list is long and none of them are the only game that

4016
03:55:00,365 --> 03:55:03,285
Speaker 5:  I needed, but you know, we're doing the best we can here, you

4017
03:55:03,285 --> 03:55:07,085
Speaker 24:  Can get FIFA 23 fairly easily on, on the Steam deck.

4018
03:55:07,235 --> 03:55:11,125
Speaker 5:  Okay. That might help. Maybe that's like my gateway drug out of being obsessed

4019
03:55:11,125 --> 03:55:15,085
Speaker 5:  with fifa. I'll just play old games enough to satiate me and then

4020
03:55:15,085 --> 03:55:16,525
Speaker 5:  go play Better Games. You get

4021
03:55:16,725 --> 03:55:18,445
Speaker 24:  Ted Lasso in that one, you'll be fucked.

4022
03:55:20,945 --> 03:55:23,805
Speaker 5:  All right, thank you both. This was very helpful. I'm gonna go spend a bunch

4023
03:55:23,805 --> 03:55:24,605
Speaker 5:  of money. Right.

4024
03:55:32,105 --> 03:55:33,965
Speaker 22:  Hi, I'm your friend Eli. David Pierce is here.

4025
03:55:34,135 --> 03:55:34,485
Speaker 5:  Hello.

4026
03:55:35,115 --> 03:55:39,005
Speaker 22:  Alex Kranz is on a break, but for our first

4027
03:55:39,005 --> 03:55:42,565
Speaker 22:  segment, Charlie Harding from Switch on Pop is joining. I Hey Charlie.

4028
03:55:42,825 --> 03:55:44,405
Speaker 21:  Hey guys. Thanks for having me. We

4029
03:55:44,405 --> 03:55:48,125
Speaker 22:  Have a lot of AI music copyright to talk about. There's some

4030
03:55:48,125 --> 03:55:51,725
Speaker 22:  lawsuits, it's always Drake is involved.

4031
03:55:52,025 --> 03:55:54,965
Speaker 22:  It just seems to be the way of the world. There's a bunch of new phone events

4032
03:55:54,965 --> 03:55:58,925
Speaker 22:  coming that just got announced. We shock about, there are new party speakers

4033
03:55:58,925 --> 03:56:01,605
Speaker 22:  from ultimate years. That's very important to me. And we got a lightning

4034
03:56:01,605 --> 03:56:05,525
Speaker 22:  on, we got a, we got a full show before, before the 4th of July. This is

4035
03:56:06,075 --> 03:56:09,205
Speaker 22:  America's technology podcast. But before we begin,

4036
03:56:10,085 --> 03:56:11,165
Speaker 22:  I have to issue a correction.

4037
03:56:12,815 --> 03:56:16,805
Speaker 22:  There are some words that I only read and I

4038
03:56:16,805 --> 03:56:17,765
Speaker 22:  never say out loud.

4039
03:56:18,105 --> 03:56:18,845
Speaker 21:  Ooh. Which ones

4040
03:56:18,845 --> 03:56:22,645
Speaker 22:  Is that? There are lots of those words. Tons of 'em. I was a, I was

4041
03:56:22,725 --> 03:56:26,645
Speaker 22:  a small nerdy child in the middle of Wisconsin who read a

4042
03:56:26,645 --> 03:56:29,285
Speaker 22:  lot of books that the other children in Wisconsin were not interested in.

4043
03:56:29,285 --> 03:56:32,685
Speaker 22:  Wisconsin's. Just a whole universe of vocabulary words. What

4044
03:56:32,685 --> 03:56:36,285
Speaker 5:  Is like your main one from when you were a kid that you, you were like 26

4045
03:56:36,305 --> 03:56:39,605
Speaker 5:  and all of a I feel like Chameleon is like the classic of the genre. Oh,

4046
03:56:39,605 --> 03:56:42,565
Speaker 5:  that's a good one. Genre, right. Where like half the people in the world

4047
03:56:42,635 --> 03:56:46,205
Speaker 5:  grew up thinking it was Chama Leon. For me it was learning that Hermione

4048
03:56:46,205 --> 03:56:49,885
Speaker 5:  name is Hermione and not Herion as I called her. Oh, that's good. However

4049
03:56:49,885 --> 03:56:53,045
Speaker 5:  many books I read before I saw the movies. Did you guys have these that you

4050
03:56:53,045 --> 03:56:53,525
Speaker 5:  grew up with?

4051
03:56:54,125 --> 03:56:54,325
Speaker 22:  I still

4052
03:56:54,885 --> 03:56:55,405
Speaker 5:  Discovered way late.

4053
03:56:56,005 --> 03:56:59,645
Speaker 22:  I still don't know whether it's Dearth or Darth

4054
03:57:00,665 --> 03:57:01,645
Speaker 22:  and I don't want find out.

4055
03:57:02,955 --> 03:57:05,525
Speaker 5:  Fair enough. Don't, don't email us about it. Don't ruin this for

4056
03:57:05,545 --> 03:57:08,645
Speaker 22:  Lie. Don't tell. Don't I don't. And I don't know if it means a lot or not

4057
03:57:08,665 --> 03:57:09,085
Speaker 22:  enough

4058
03:57:10,745 --> 03:57:14,605
Speaker 21:  On Switch on Pop. We have an ongoing uncertainty about whether it is

4059
03:57:14,745 --> 03:57:18,405
Speaker 21:  homage or homage. That's good. And we have been written many

4060
03:57:18,405 --> 03:57:22,205
Speaker 21:  emails that it's both and so we've refused to use the word from that

4061
03:57:22,225 --> 03:57:26,205
Speaker 22:  One out. Niche and niche. Very confusing. Mm, both

4062
03:57:26,205 --> 03:57:29,405
Speaker 22:  acceptable also have been told it's both. So there's a lot of these. Yeah.

4063
03:57:30,465 --> 03:57:34,445
Speaker 22:  One of them in recent times is risk

4064
03:57:34,555 --> 03:57:38,325
Speaker 22:  five, which is, I would say not a thing that comes up

4065
03:57:38,345 --> 03:57:42,285
Speaker 22:  in casual conversation for anyone. Even the people who are working on risk.

4066
03:57:42,285 --> 03:57:45,205
Speaker 22:  Five Bryant just walking around the office saying Risk five.

4067
03:57:46,685 --> 03:57:50,485
Speaker 22:  I I said it was risk V the other day. All right, I'm sorry. I mean,

4068
03:57:50,485 --> 03:57:54,205
Speaker 22:  this is your correction. You got one on me. I, I apologize.

4069
03:57:54,605 --> 03:57:57,885
Speaker 22:  I don't know what kind of slash shot nerds are. Reading it out loud.

4070
03:58:00,145 --> 03:58:02,785
Speaker 22:  I mean, you're my people and you're listening and you know, like we have

4071
03:58:02,825 --> 03:58:06,265
Speaker 22:  a bond here. You're listening to a podcast in which the word is said out

4072
03:58:06,265 --> 03:58:09,785
Speaker 22:  loud and you, the audience know that I've

4073
03:58:09,785 --> 03:58:12,905
Speaker 22:  mispronounced there's something special there. Precious. I I want to protect

4074
03:58:12,905 --> 03:58:16,785
Speaker 22:  it. I'm just saying we are the only people

4075
03:58:16,845 --> 03:58:17,225
Speaker 22:  who know

4076
03:58:17,765 --> 03:58:19,705
Speaker 21:  How do you know they're right and that you aren't now

4077
03:58:20,095 --> 03:58:23,185
Speaker 22:  Also spread the truth also. Good question, Charlie. Am I being gaslit by

4078
03:58:23,185 --> 03:58:23,985
Speaker 22:  an internet conspiracy

4079
03:58:23,995 --> 03:58:27,945
Speaker 5:  Words? I would also like to pause that with all Roman

4080
03:58:28,225 --> 03:58:31,945
Speaker 5:  numerals. The, the letter and the number are both

4081
03:58:31,945 --> 03:58:35,785
Speaker 5:  correct. Like when the iPhone 10 came out and it was the iPhone

4082
03:58:35,905 --> 03:58:39,745
Speaker 5:  X, it was the iPhone X. I don't care what anyone said, I got a

4083
03:58:39,765 --> 03:58:42,985
Speaker 5:  lot of crap for that. And it was the iPhone X because it was, it was the

4084
03:58:42,985 --> 03:58:46,585
Speaker 5:  iPhone and then the letter X, you call it whatever you want. I, I

4085
03:58:46,585 --> 03:58:48,705
Speaker 5:  submit that both should be allowed at all times.

4086
03:58:48,965 --> 03:58:52,905
Speaker 22:  So I would, I I I support this In theory it's Superbowl Excel.

4087
03:58:52,905 --> 03:58:53,185
Speaker 22:  Unless

4088
03:58:53,185 --> 03:58:54,345
Speaker 5:  It's more than one letter than

4089
03:58:54,455 --> 03:58:57,665
Speaker 22:  Well, no, but Super Bowl xl. Like they ob they were like hypee for it. Yes,

4090
03:58:57,665 --> 03:58:58,505
Speaker 5:  Right. Yeah. They did a thing.

4091
03:58:58,725 --> 03:59:02,705
Speaker 22:  That's your moment. But I was one of those slash taught nerds who was like,

4092
03:59:02,735 --> 03:59:06,185
Speaker 22:  it's Meko is 10, so I'm sorry. Like I, you

4093
03:59:06,185 --> 03:59:07,625
Speaker 5:  Know, even though it's not, it's OSX.

4094
03:59:08,505 --> 03:59:12,425
Speaker 22:  We got fun. Anyway, that's your correction. I'm just telling you what we,

4095
03:59:12,585 --> 03:59:15,905
Speaker 22:  what we share as a group is special and I'm, I'm sorry that I pushed the

4096
03:59:16,065 --> 03:59:19,825
Speaker 22:  boundary of it, but I'm also saying no one says these words out loud.

4097
03:59:21,735 --> 03:59:24,945
Speaker 22:  It's just not a thing that happens and I feel nothing. Charlie

4098
03:59:25,065 --> 03:59:26,025
Speaker 21:  XCX has entered the chat.

4099
03:59:29,335 --> 03:59:31,305
Speaker 22:  What is the, what is XC, X in numbers?

4100
03:59:32,165 --> 03:59:33,265
Speaker 21:  It isn't a real one,

4101
03:59:34,355 --> 03:59:35,785
Speaker 22:  Isn't C and Roman numeral

4102
03:59:36,025 --> 03:59:39,825
Speaker 5:  CI is a hundred. So that would be a hundred. It would be 90 and then 10 more

4103
03:59:41,005 --> 03:59:42,225
Speaker 22:  Allows you to put them in this order.

4104
03:59:42,735 --> 03:59:44,105
Speaker 5:  It's just Charlie CI think.

4105
03:59:46,345 --> 03:59:47,785
Speaker 22:  I don't know how Roman numerals work.

4106
03:59:49,665 --> 03:59:51,425
Speaker 22:  Speaking of things that are bad at math ai,

4107
03:59:54,255 --> 03:59:57,905
Speaker 22:  it's true. That's good. That's good. Big week in the AI

4108
03:59:58,015 --> 04:00:01,945
Speaker 22:  landscape. A weird week for me emotionally. I'll explain why in

4109
04:00:01,945 --> 04:00:04,945
Speaker 22:  a second. The major labels have sued two AI companies that you may or may

4110
04:00:04,945 --> 04:00:08,865
Speaker 22:  not have heard of, UDO and Suno. These are classic Silicon Valley

4111
04:00:08,865 --> 04:00:12,065
Speaker 22:  names. We should all be proud. They're music companies. They're AI music

4112
04:00:12,305 --> 04:00:16,265
Speaker 22:  companies. UDO is the company whose tool was used to

4113
04:00:16,265 --> 04:00:19,605
Speaker 22:  make BBLD Drizzy. We'll have Charlie explain that entire chain of events.

4114
04:00:20,165 --> 04:00:24,005
Speaker 22:  And then Suno has a deal with Microsoft. It's in copilot

4115
04:00:24,005 --> 04:00:27,925
Speaker 22:  and you can ask it to giant music in copilot. How would

4116
04:00:27,925 --> 04:00:31,765
Speaker 22:  you train an AI tool to make music? You might ask, as did the lawyers

4117
04:00:31,825 --> 04:00:35,045
Speaker 22:  at the Recording Industry Association of America. And the answer is you

4118
04:00:35,045 --> 04:00:38,965
Speaker 22:  just put a bunch of music in them and you train the model on

4119
04:00:38,965 --> 04:00:42,645
Speaker 22:  a bunch of music, including what appears to be an a, a remarkable

4120
04:00:42,745 --> 04:00:46,725
Speaker 22:  amount of the recording industries. Music, not just music that's out

4121
04:00:46,725 --> 04:00:49,965
Speaker 22:  in the world. The companies are sued. There's a lawsuit.

4122
04:00:50,665 --> 04:00:53,965
Speaker 22:  The RA is mad, the RIA is already mad. They

4123
04:00:54,785 --> 04:00:58,725
Speaker 22:  say that they asked the companies what was used to train the models. The

4124
04:00:58,925 --> 04:01:02,365
Speaker 22:  companies Suno deflected and said their training data was confidential.

4125
04:01:02,565 --> 04:01:03,245
Speaker 22:  Business information

4126
04:01:05,405 --> 04:01:09,375
Speaker 22:  fine. UDO made the same statements. And then Suno also said,

4127
04:01:09,795 --> 04:01:13,055
Speaker 22:  our stuff is transformative and designed to generate completely new outputs,

4128
04:01:13,055 --> 04:01:15,575
Speaker 22:  not memorized and regurgitate preexisting content.

4129
04:01:17,065 --> 04:01:20,015
Speaker 22:  We'll get to that in a second. 'cause that is actually a very funny claim

4130
04:01:20,065 --> 04:01:23,935
Speaker 22:  based on what you can do. The RAA put tracks in lawsuit, which we

4131
04:01:23,935 --> 04:01:27,695
Speaker 22:  will listen to it straightforwardly, can just make Johnny be good

4132
04:01:28,435 --> 04:01:32,215
Speaker 22:  in a song called Prancing Queen, which is my favorite. Deeply hilarious.

4133
04:01:34,365 --> 04:01:38,015
Speaker 22:  There's just a part of this where these companies knew

4134
04:01:38,605 --> 04:01:42,015
Speaker 22:  that what they were doing was training on copyright work and they kind of

4135
04:01:42,015 --> 04:01:44,415
Speaker 22:  assumed that they would get away with it or at least be able to like pay

4136
04:01:44,415 --> 04:01:45,255
Speaker 22:  the money and move on.

4137
04:01:45,795 --> 04:01:49,615
Speaker 5:  Can I ask a, can I ask a very possibly dumb framing question

4138
04:01:49,825 --> 04:01:53,455
Speaker 5:  about this? Because I, I want, we're gonna get into the weeds of like a very

4139
04:01:53,695 --> 04:01:57,615
Speaker 5:  specific music case, but a lot of what you just described,

4140
04:01:57,615 --> 04:02:01,415
Speaker 5:  the sort of basic outlines of like how these companies trained their data

4141
04:02:01,635 --> 04:02:05,495
Speaker 5:  and what they're being accused of doing and who's mad feels

4142
04:02:05,495 --> 04:02:08,735
Speaker 5:  identical to me to every other conversation we've had about these AI models,

4143
04:02:08,735 --> 04:02:12,655
Speaker 5:  right? Yes. Like it seems to me that If you change Johnny B. Good

4144
04:02:13,355 --> 04:02:17,255
Speaker 5:  and Suno to the New York Times and Chat

4145
04:02:17,415 --> 04:02:21,215
Speaker 5:  GPT, we're functionally talking about the same thing. So like, I want to

4146
04:02:21,215 --> 04:02:24,695
Speaker 5:  get into the deep into this in, in weird ways, but like, is there something

4147
04:02:24,695 --> 04:02:28,415
Speaker 5:  different about the fact that we're doing this with music than the fact the

4148
04:02:28,415 --> 04:02:32,295
Speaker 5:  way we've been doing this with like the web for the last year or so?

4149
04:02:33,195 --> 04:02:37,095
Speaker 22:  Yes. And it's that the music industry is organized

4150
04:02:37,195 --> 04:02:39,455
Speaker 22:  and aggressive when it comes to protecting its rights.

4151
04:02:40,155 --> 04:02:41,215
Speaker 5:  So the difference is lawyers,

4152
04:02:41,795 --> 04:02:44,575
Speaker 22:  The difference is lawyers and also the, the history of music and the internet

4153
04:02:45,035 --> 04:02:48,775
Speaker 22:  is lawyers. Like, the reason I'm so

4154
04:02:49,015 --> 04:02:52,775
Speaker 22:  conflicted about this is that I went and became a copyright lawyer

4155
04:02:52,775 --> 04:02:56,735
Speaker 22:  because Napster came out when I was in college and I was

4156
04:02:56,885 --> 04:03:00,695
Speaker 22:  radicalized because I thought everyone was stupid, which is what

4157
04:03:00,695 --> 04:03:04,175
Speaker 22:  should happen when software comes out when you're in college. Yeah. I, I'm

4158
04:03:04,495 --> 04:03:08,055
Speaker 22:  assuming there are some kids out there today who are radicalized by the

4159
04:03:08,215 --> 04:03:11,495
Speaker 22:  presence of new software, but that wouldn't, it wasn't for me. It was Napster.

4160
04:03:11,855 --> 04:03:14,895
Speaker 22:  I went off and became a copyright attorney. I sucked at it. I don't ever

4161
04:03:14,895 --> 04:03:17,805
Speaker 22:  want anyone to think I was good at this as a practicing attorney. I was

4162
04:03:17,805 --> 04:03:21,125
Speaker 22:  garbage. But the thing I did was I worked at a law firm that defended other

4163
04:03:21,125 --> 04:03:24,925
Speaker 22:  college kids who got sued for using kaza against the RIAA

4164
04:03:25,305 --> 04:03:29,005
Speaker 22:  and the RIAA was suing college kids and actually

4165
04:03:29,005 --> 04:03:31,965
Speaker 22:  suing the universities to get the IP address of the college kids on their

4166
04:03:31,965 --> 04:03:34,805
Speaker 22:  networks who were using the tools and then identifying the college students

4167
04:03:34,825 --> 04:03:37,605
Speaker 22:  and suing college students. It was my roommate's computer, it wasn't me.

4168
04:03:37,965 --> 04:03:41,885
Speaker 22:  Yep. I swear this is like a lot, right? That's a lot that that's

4169
04:03:41,885 --> 04:03:44,725
Speaker 22:  just a lot to like the universities are caving and not protecting their

4170
04:03:44,805 --> 04:03:47,485
Speaker 22:  students. All this stuff is happening and they were running this program

4171
04:03:47,505 --> 04:03:50,365
Speaker 22:  at breakeven. They just wanted $5,000 settlements so everyone would be scared

4172
04:03:50,425 --> 04:03:54,365
Speaker 22:  and stopped doing it and they won that. That worked sort

4173
04:03:54,485 --> 04:03:58,325
Speaker 22:  of, now we're back to it, right? But like the movie industry

4174
04:03:58,325 --> 04:04:01,965
Speaker 22:  is not quite as good. It's stopping the Piy as the music industry was and

4175
04:04:01,965 --> 04:04:05,245
Speaker 22:  they ran that program to kind of like shut it down in chill. Napster

4176
04:04:05,985 --> 04:04:08,845
Speaker 22:  in Ster and Kaza and all the other ones, they ran ster all the way up to

4177
04:04:08,845 --> 04:04:12,045
Speaker 22:  the Supreme Court. That decision was, is 20 years old now. The

4178
04:04:12,525 --> 04:04:14,045
Speaker 22:  RAA versus crosser

4179
04:04:15,855 --> 04:04:19,725
Speaker 22:  great. Then they did the iTunes store and they got deals

4180
04:04:20,115 --> 04:04:23,005
Speaker 22:  with Steve Jobs and then other music stores and then they did Spotify and

4181
04:04:23,005 --> 04:04:26,765
Speaker 22:  Apple Music and streaming. And all along the way they have an

4182
04:04:26,765 --> 04:04:29,805
Speaker 22:  extraordinarily litigious and extraordinarily protective of their copyrights

4183
04:04:29,805 --> 04:04:32,845
Speaker 22:  because people have an emotional connection to music that they can trade

4184
04:04:32,845 --> 04:04:36,445
Speaker 22:  on. This is true in a way that even Hollywood doesn't, like when

4185
04:04:36,445 --> 04:04:39,205
Speaker 22:  Disney's like, we must protect the copyright to the Avengers, people are

4186
04:04:39,205 --> 04:04:42,885
Speaker 22:  like, go fuck yourself. Like right In a way that the music industry, when

4187
04:04:42,885 --> 04:04:46,125
Speaker 22:  it's like you are stealing music, you are making it so artists don't get

4188
04:04:46,125 --> 04:04:50,005
Speaker 22:  paid. There's an emotional resonance. That argument tends to

4189
04:04:50,005 --> 04:04:53,085
Speaker 22:  have. Charlie, I'm curious how you, how you see that changing over time.

4190
04:04:53,185 --> 04:04:56,805
Speaker 22:  But they've been good at it and they've run the playbook over and over and

4191
04:04:56,805 --> 04:05:00,725
Speaker 22:  over again. Music is also a closed ecosystem of like four big

4192
04:05:01,085 --> 04:05:04,885
Speaker 22:  companies. And so you see things like interpolation where

4193
04:05:04,985 --> 04:05:08,925
Speaker 22:  an artist uses a bit of a song from another artist and fans get

4194
04:05:08,925 --> 04:05:12,845
Speaker 22:  mad and then writing credits get distributed and money flows inside of

4195
04:05:12,845 --> 04:05:16,765
Speaker 22:  a closed ecosystem. None of that is true about the web. None of that

4196
04:05:16,765 --> 04:05:19,765
Speaker 22:  is true about the media. So If you are like a writer at a media company,

4197
04:05:21,155 --> 04:05:24,685
Speaker 22:  nothing like no one cares. Like there's not some big apparatus

4198
04:05:25,045 --> 04:05:28,925
Speaker 22:  designed to make it as seem like your work is emotionally resonant

4199
04:05:28,925 --> 04:05:31,605
Speaker 22:  and should be protected in the way that the music industry does. So I think

4200
04:05:31,605 --> 04:05:35,325
Speaker 22:  that's a huge difference here. The other difference, and this is where

4201
04:05:35,485 --> 04:05:39,365
Speaker 22:  I really, Charlie, I'm very curious for your take

4202
04:05:39,395 --> 04:05:43,205
Speaker 22:  here, is that the outputs of these systems are

4203
04:05:43,315 --> 04:05:47,005
Speaker 22:  just the songs, right? And they're, the

4204
04:05:47,085 --> 04:05:50,645
Speaker 22:  lawsuits are about training, right? All copyright lawsuit, all copyright

4205
04:05:50,945 --> 04:05:54,725
Speaker 22:  is dumb. Like it's a dumb legal system because it, it just

4206
04:05:54,965 --> 04:05:58,925
Speaker 22:  regulates copies. And so they're like, you made a copy to do this thing

4207
04:05:59,185 --> 04:06:02,365
Speaker 22:  and you didn't have the permission to do the thing with the copy that you

4208
04:06:02,365 --> 04:06:06,125
Speaker 22:  made. So copyright infringement weird. All

4209
04:06:06,325 --> 04:06:09,525
Speaker 22:  computers do is make copies. We've talked about this so many times in the

4210
04:06:09,525 --> 04:06:13,005
Speaker 22:  show, so they're not talking about the outputs, but I think the outputs

4211
04:06:13,025 --> 04:06:16,925
Speaker 22:  are so convincing. Like in order to get to the thing can

4212
04:06:16,925 --> 04:06:20,445
Speaker 22:  just make Johnny be good. It is obvious that you made a copy of Johnny be

4213
04:06:20,445 --> 04:06:22,955
Speaker 22:  good. Charlie, what do you think? Man,

4214
04:06:23,395 --> 04:06:26,315
Speaker 21:  I feel like the music industry is the one place that copyright becomes part

4215
04:06:26,315 --> 04:06:30,235
Speaker 21:  of public conversation in a very frequent way. People

4216
04:06:30,305 --> 04:06:33,675
Speaker 21:  talk about when Pharrell is

4217
04:06:33,835 --> 04:06:37,595
Speaker 21:  borrowing from Marvin Gaye, people talk about when

4218
04:06:38,395 --> 04:06:41,555
Speaker 21:  Steroid to Heaven might be of, might have been copied by another song. People

4219
04:06:41,555 --> 04:06:45,435
Speaker 21:  constantly are debating in social media, Hey, you kind of sound like you

4220
04:06:46,075 --> 04:06:49,075
Speaker 21:  borrowed this other person's thing. They should get a credit on it. There's

4221
04:06:49,075 --> 04:06:52,355
Speaker 21:  no thing in journalism where someone's like, Hey, you know, NELI kind of

4222
04:06:52,355 --> 04:06:55,595
Speaker 21:  used someone else's texts. Maybe we we should give David some extra credit

4223
04:06:55,775 --> 04:06:58,835
Speaker 21:  on that piece. That Neli plagiarized, I'm sorry, I'm obviously not accusing

4224
04:06:58,835 --> 04:06:59,595
Speaker 21:  you of I do

4225
04:06:59,595 --> 04:06:59,995
Speaker 22:  That all the time.

4226
04:06:59,995 --> 04:07:00,435
Speaker 21:  This is Hypothe.

4227
04:07:00,805 --> 04:07:01,155
Speaker 22:  Don't

4228
04:07:01,155 --> 04:07:02,315
Speaker 5:  Think you understand specifically. Neli does that all,

4229
04:07:02,715 --> 04:07:06,635
Speaker 22:  I have God mode Google Docs access and I just lift everybody's copy left

4230
04:07:06,635 --> 04:07:06,955
Speaker 22:  and right.

4231
04:07:07,505 --> 04:07:11,195
Speaker 21:  There's just no other creative industry that where there's this like level

4232
04:07:11,335 --> 04:07:14,915
Speaker 21:  of actual infringement that happens that then there is this internal

4233
04:07:16,345 --> 04:07:20,155
Speaker 21:  litigious system where these major players are constantly trading credits

4234
04:07:20,155 --> 04:07:23,915
Speaker 21:  back and forth and the public is in on it often debating

4235
04:07:24,145 --> 04:07:27,825
Speaker 21:  whether or not their, the artists that they stand

4236
04:07:28,125 --> 04:07:31,545
Speaker 21:  is making original work. This is part of popular discourse and it happens

4237
04:07:31,545 --> 04:07:35,345
Speaker 21:  in music. So it's really different when the music industry

4238
04:07:35,405 --> 04:07:39,345
Speaker 21:  is going after AI than if the New York Times is because I've just

4239
04:07:39,345 --> 04:07:42,505
Speaker 21:  never been in a circumstance where I'm talking about, that article was completely

4240
04:07:42,505 --> 04:07:45,425
Speaker 21:  lifted from this other article, but we constantly talk about is so-and-so

4241
04:07:45,425 --> 04:07:46,265
Speaker 21:  writing in their own songs.

4242
04:07:46,915 --> 04:07:50,665
Speaker 22:  Right. I'll give you a a dumb example from movies. The movie,

4243
04:07:50,725 --> 04:07:54,665
Speaker 22:  the Dark Knight is basically an interpolation of the movie

4244
04:07:54,695 --> 04:07:58,545
Speaker 22:  Heat except with Batman. Yeah. Right. Like many of the

4245
04:07:58,545 --> 04:08:01,065
Speaker 22:  shots are the same. Christopher Nolan is out there being like, heat is the

4246
04:08:01,145 --> 04:08:04,345
Speaker 22:  greatest cops and robbers movie ever made. Like I just wanted to make heat,

4247
04:08:04,565 --> 04:08:07,985
Speaker 22:  but with Batman and then you like watch both movies, you're like, oh shit.

4248
04:08:07,985 --> 04:08:11,505
Speaker 22:  Like dude just made heat with Batman. Yeah. And that's great. And I think

4249
04:08:11,625 --> 04:08:14,785
Speaker 22:  everyone's like, this is the best. Like this is so cool. Right? And then

4250
04:08:14,785 --> 04:08:18,505
Speaker 22:  you get to, I dunno, Miley Cyrus is writing flowers, which the

4251
04:08:18,625 --> 04:08:19,625
Speaker 22:  lyrics just reference

4252
04:08:20,155 --> 04:08:20,785
Speaker 21:  Bruno Mars,

4253
04:08:20,795 --> 04:08:23,865
Speaker 22:  Bruno Mars. And people are like, should she have to pay Bruno Mars? It's

4254
04:08:23,865 --> 04:08:27,705
Speaker 22:  like, why? Like why like the melodies aren't like they she's just

4255
04:08:28,125 --> 04:08:32,025
Speaker 22:  saying some of the same words. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. But the expectation

4256
04:08:32,025 --> 04:08:34,265
Speaker 22:  is that there, there should be some economic exchange of value.

4257
04:08:34,615 --> 04:08:38,425
Speaker 5:  Well, and I, I would, I would think then that the existence of

4258
04:08:38,735 --> 04:08:42,465
Speaker 5:  that exchange of value is also how you get to something like this, right?

4259
04:08:42,465 --> 04:08:46,345
Speaker 5:  Where it's, it's not just everybody's sort of yelling and then

4260
04:08:46,345 --> 04:08:50,305
Speaker 5:  nothing ever happens. It's that we actually have a system by which this

4261
04:08:50,305 --> 04:08:53,705
Speaker 5:  gets solved, right? Where, where we have people get songwriting credits and

4262
04:08:53,705 --> 04:08:56,465
Speaker 5:  then they get paid for it. And there's like the music industry has built

4263
04:08:56,815 --> 04:09:00,705
Speaker 5:  ways for all of this to work and like you said, is very

4264
04:09:00,705 --> 04:09:04,265
Speaker 5:  good at picking fights with those who do not play inside of that system.

4265
04:09:04,805 --> 04:09:08,425
Speaker 5:  And so like now I'm just thinking, okay, the difference between the music

4266
04:09:08,745 --> 04:09:12,225
Speaker 5:  industry and the, the others who are fighting against

4267
04:09:12,735 --> 04:09:16,325
Speaker 5:  open AI and others like just groups of authors or whatever, is

4268
04:09:17,065 --> 04:09:20,645
Speaker 5:  not only does the music industry have a system by which it

4269
04:09:20,645 --> 04:09:23,645
Speaker 5:  understands how everybody is supposed to get paid. That has existed for a

4270
04:09:23,645 --> 04:09:26,885
Speaker 5:  long time and everybody kind of sorta understands, but also

4271
04:09:27,465 --> 04:09:31,245
Speaker 5:  is able to marshal that whole system against anyone who wants to

4272
04:09:31,405 --> 04:09:34,645
Speaker 5:  exist outside of that. And part of what we've been saying forever is like

4273
04:09:34,905 --> 04:09:38,045
Speaker 5:  all the money is on the side of the AI companies. Like who, who is going

4274
04:09:38,045 --> 04:09:41,925
Speaker 5:  to be able to run a lawsuit against Google all the way to

4275
04:09:41,925 --> 04:09:45,765
Speaker 5:  the end. And there probably aren't that many creative industries other

4276
04:09:45,765 --> 04:09:47,765
Speaker 5:  than the music industry that might be able to do it.

4277
04:09:48,035 --> 04:09:51,725
Speaker 21:  They've done it before. Yeah. And they have one major concessions,

4278
04:09:51,725 --> 04:09:55,645
Speaker 21:  right? That we wouldn't have content id if not for music labels going after

4279
04:09:55,645 --> 04:09:56,565
Speaker 21:  YouTube. Right.

4280
04:09:56,825 --> 04:09:59,805
Speaker 22:  And they, and the music labels have gone after YouTube, right? Universal,

4281
04:09:59,995 --> 04:10:03,045
Speaker 22:  this is where Drake gets involved. There's fake Drake that we've, we've

4282
04:10:03,045 --> 04:10:06,485
Speaker 22:  talked about endlessly on the show. Shout out to Laser Bong a song that

4283
04:10:06,485 --> 04:10:10,005
Speaker 22:  has been just aggressively censored from e every major

4284
04:10:10,325 --> 04:10:13,965
Speaker 22:  platform. Boyd, does TikTok not want electronic music

4285
04:10:14,015 --> 04:10:15,525
Speaker 22:  about bongs on its platform?

4286
04:10:16,105 --> 04:10:17,365
Speaker 5:  Sue about that. Record labels

4287
04:10:17,595 --> 04:10:21,565
Speaker 22:  Like Yeah, you want to talk about government censorship? Yeah. All right.

4288
04:10:21,565 --> 04:10:25,285
Speaker 22:  The Chinese government is like no bongs for American teens. Just

4289
04:10:25,285 --> 04:10:29,245
Speaker 22:  saying it. The piece of that puzzle that's super interesting to

4290
04:10:29,245 --> 04:10:33,085
Speaker 22:  me is Universal was mad about fake Drake. They went to

4291
04:10:33,085 --> 04:10:37,005
Speaker 22:  Spotify, apple, they said, don't have these, don't have this song. And

4292
04:10:37,005 --> 04:10:39,525
Speaker 22:  Spotify and Apple Control the catalogs and their music service they can

4293
04:10:39,525 --> 04:10:43,285
Speaker 22:  pull down YouTube is open access, right? So anyone can upload anything.

4294
04:10:43,285 --> 04:10:45,765
Speaker 22:  And then there is continuity and they have these other copyright management

4295
04:10:45,765 --> 04:10:49,445
Speaker 22:  systems on YouTube, but it's not the same catalog control where you can

4296
04:10:49,445 --> 04:10:53,365
Speaker 22:  just delete the song the way that Spotify and Apple Music could just delete

4297
04:10:53,365 --> 04:10:56,365
Speaker 22:  the song. So they had to come up with some other system and YouTube did

4298
04:10:56,365 --> 04:10:59,885
Speaker 22:  give the concessions, right? They put out a list of like AI

4299
04:10:59,885 --> 04:11:02,805
Speaker 22:  principles they would work on about safety, about this other stuff. And

4300
04:11:02,805 --> 04:11:05,445
Speaker 22:  a lot of it was we are gonna work directly with Universal and the rest of

4301
04:11:05,445 --> 04:11:08,205
Speaker 22:  the music industry to figure out what tools are valuable and what tools

4302
04:11:08,205 --> 04:11:11,765
Speaker 22:  aren't. And even to allow some creators to like do some of this AI music

4303
04:11:11,765 --> 04:11:15,045
Speaker 22:  generation. 'cause we think it's cool and then we'll obviously we'll figure

4304
04:11:15,045 --> 04:11:18,925
Speaker 22:  out how to pay them. This is implicit if you're like co announcing that

4305
04:11:18,925 --> 04:11:22,725
Speaker 22:  tool with universal music, universal music is gonna get paid. Yes.

4306
04:11:22,795 --> 04:11:26,685
Speaker 22:  Like the, the heat death of the universe could occur in Lucian Grange,

4307
04:11:26,685 --> 04:11:30,125
Speaker 22:  the CEO of Universal Music would get paid. Like he's good at it. Yes.

4308
04:11:30,615 --> 04:11:34,365
Speaker 22:  These two companies did not do that. There's a quote from one of the VCs

4309
04:11:34,425 --> 04:11:38,005
Speaker 22:  in Suno, a Rolling Stone profile from March, and he, he's, he just says,

4310
04:11:38,005 --> 04:11:40,885
Speaker 22:  rolling Stone. If we had deals with the labels when the company got started,

4311
04:11:41,085 --> 04:11:44,245
Speaker 22:  I probably wouldn't have invested in it. I think they needed to make this

4312
04:11:44,245 --> 04:11:45,565
Speaker 22:  product without the constraints.

4313
04:11:47,325 --> 04:11:49,095
Speaker 5:  Wild thing to say out loud. Incredible

4314
04:11:49,095 --> 04:11:49,855
Speaker 22:  Thing to say out loud.

4315
04:11:50,165 --> 04:11:53,175
Speaker 21:  They said the quiet thing out loud because Yeah. Behind all of this, they

4316
04:11:53,175 --> 04:11:56,655
Speaker 21:  haven't ever really quite publicly emitted that they are using copyrighted

4317
04:11:56,655 --> 04:12:00,535
Speaker 21:  works. They've talked around that in every way they possibly can without

4318
04:12:00,535 --> 04:12:04,215
Speaker 21:  denying it. And this is sort of like the big Yeah, this is the, this is

4319
04:12:04,215 --> 04:12:04,855
Speaker 21:  the smoking gun,

4320
04:12:05,305 --> 04:12:07,975
Speaker 22:  Right? And then the other smoking gun, and this is the part we should just

4321
04:12:07,975 --> 04:12:11,300
Speaker 22:  listen to some of this music is the output of the models themselves. Right?

4322
04:12:11,495 --> 04:12:15,395
Speaker 22:  Which is, I mean, let's listen

4323
04:12:15,395 --> 04:12:17,635
Speaker 22:  to it and we can talk about it. David, take us through it.

4324
04:12:17,785 --> 04:12:21,755
Speaker 5:  Okay. I have, I have brought some sound thank you to Andrew and Liam for

4325
04:12:21,755 --> 04:12:25,555
Speaker 5:  getting all of this together. We have three examples

4326
04:12:25,855 --> 04:12:29,795
Speaker 5:  and I, I will just roll through all three. Stop me when you

4327
04:12:29,835 --> 04:12:32,555
Speaker 5:  have feelings about this. The first thing we'll do is

4328
04:12:33,715 --> 04:12:36,595
Speaker 5:  this is just titled Real Chuck Berry in Riverside.

4329
04:12:37,495 --> 04:12:38,795
Speaker 5:  So let's just listen to this first. A

4330
04:12:38,795 --> 04:12:41,875
Speaker 22:  Second by the way. And this is all fair use, no copyright infringement intended.

4331
04:12:42,375 --> 04:12:45,115
Speaker 22:  All right. YouTube. All right, go ahead. No,

4332
04:12:45,135 --> 04:12:48,475
Speaker 25:  But he could play a guitar just like a ring in a bell. Go,

4333
04:12:50,215 --> 04:12:50,435
Speaker 25:  go,

4334
04:12:53,055 --> 04:12:54,595
Speaker 25:  go, go, go

4335
04:12:56,095 --> 04:12:58,555
Speaker 22:  Try. That's enough. Stop before the robot sensors arrive. Great

4336
04:12:58,555 --> 04:12:59,715
Speaker 5:  Song. I can We love it right from

4337
04:13:00,025 --> 04:13:02,835
Speaker 22:  Love it. If you don't know that song one, go watch Back to the Future.

4338
04:13:03,405 --> 04:13:07,395
Speaker 22:  Incredible movie that you should just watch and two like stop, go get

4339
04:13:07,395 --> 04:13:09,275

Speaker 21:  Johnny. Be good. Chuck Berry. Yeah. And rock and roll one of them.

4341
04:13:13,265 --> 04:13:16,515
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And now we have a song from UDO,

4342
04:13:17,165 --> 04:13:20,275
Speaker 5:  which is not called Johnny Be Good, but just listen

4343

04:13:29,735 --> 04:13:29,955
Speaker 25:  go

4346
04:13:32,265 --> 04:13:32,955
Speaker 25:  down, go,

4347
04:13:34,935 --> 04:13:35,155
Speaker 25:  go.

4348
04:13:36,015 --> 04:13:37,555
Speaker 5:  So I mean it's,

4349
04:13:37,855 --> 04:13:40,835
Speaker 22:  So that one is non copier infringement, just sciences face. Yeah. Because

4350
04:13:41,255 --> 04:13:41,635
Speaker 21:  You can't

4351
04:13:42,365 --> 04:13:45,115
Speaker 22:  Can't, he owns this. You can't copyright the AI work.

4352
04:13:45,345 --> 04:13:49,235
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Okay, so that's one. Next we have a

4353
04:13:49,235 --> 04:13:52,155
Speaker 22:  James Brown. Can can we just, I just wanna ask Charlie a like a hard question.

4354
04:13:52,155 --> 04:13:55,675
Speaker 22:  Charlie's a professor of music at NYUI believe, right? Yes.

4355
04:13:56,215 --> 04:13:59,555
Speaker 22:  All right, professor, let's say you didn't have

4356
04:13:59,615 --> 04:14:03,115
Speaker 22:  Johnny B. Good in the training data. Yes. But then you had the entire

4357
04:14:03,435 --> 04:14:07,155
Speaker 22:  architecture of rock and roll that is built on Johnny B. Good. That's good

4358
04:14:07,275 --> 04:14:10,355
Speaker 22:  question. Yeah. Could you back your way into Johnny B. Good

4359
04:14:10,545 --> 04:14:13,235
Speaker 5:  Monkeys and typewriters and Shakespeare, right? Like that's the, is that

4360
04:14:13,235 --> 04:14:13,755
Speaker 5:  the, the theory

4361
04:14:13,785 --> 04:14:16,555
Speaker 22:  Here, but like you, you don't need, do you need the seed crystal when you

4362
04:14:16,555 --> 04:14:19,115
Speaker 22:  have the whole diamond mine of rock and roll?

4363
04:14:19,585 --> 04:14:22,635
Speaker 21:  It's a really good question because you know, If you look at this era of,

4364
04:14:22,695 --> 04:14:26,355
Speaker 21:  of music where r and b rock and roll

4365
04:14:27,135 --> 04:14:31,075
Speaker 21:  be are sort of like rockabilly are all kind of one entity. The music is

4366
04:14:31,075 --> 04:14:35,035
Speaker 21:  drawing on 12 bar blues, a very standard song structure. They're

4367
04:14:35,035 --> 04:14:38,635
Speaker 21:  often in the same keys that play well on guitar. They're using a lot of

4368
04:14:38,635 --> 04:14:42,155
Speaker 21:  the same kind of guitar licks. They're mostly using pentatonic scales. They're

4369
04:14:42,155 --> 04:14:45,795
Speaker 21:  using a lot of the same language. And you might think, yeah, you could just

4370
04:14:45,795 --> 04:14:49,755
Speaker 21:  sort of back into that. But the precise rhythms, the exact

4371
04:14:50,205 --> 04:14:53,875
Speaker 21:  words, let's be clear. The copy is worse. It does not

4372
04:14:53,885 --> 04:14:57,675
Speaker 21:  sound nearly as good as the real Johnny be Good. You could never

4373
04:14:58,175 --> 04:15:01,555
Speaker 21:  get to that same place without having heard that Johnny B. Good. I feel

4374
04:15:01,585 --> 04:15:05,475
Speaker 21:  confident. And if these two songs, one being a

4375
04:15:05,475 --> 04:15:08,995
Speaker 21:  real song and the other being nobody owns the copyright and it's made by

4376
04:15:09,120 --> 04:15:12,885
Speaker 21:  an ai, if, if there were a copyright case made against

4377
04:15:13,185 --> 04:15:16,405
Speaker 21:  the copy, it would definitively lose.

4378
04:15:17,725 --> 04:15:21,525
Speaker 21:  I I have the many of these cases, many of these music copyright cases are

4379
04:15:21,525 --> 04:15:24,965
Speaker 21:  not clear. They're often fought over eight notes

4380
04:15:24,965 --> 04:15:28,845
Speaker 21:  sometimes. Yeah, six notes. Sometimes a general feel in

4381
04:15:28,845 --> 04:15:32,755
Speaker 21:  the case of blurred lines and got to give it up. This is

4382
04:15:32,835 --> 04:15:36,795
Speaker 21:  a direct copy of the Rhythm and the words and

4383
04:15:36,795 --> 04:15:40,595
Speaker 21:  most of the melodies. So no, you had to have heard this song in order to

4384
04:15:41,185 --> 04:15:42,635
Speaker 21:  make Johnny be good twice. By

4385
04:15:42,635 --> 04:15:45,995
Speaker 22:  The way, If you want more on eight notes and how complicated it is. Charlie

4386
04:15:45,995 --> 04:15:48,595
Speaker 22:  and I did an entire episode of Decoder pulling that Apart. We'll link that

4387
04:15:48,595 --> 04:15:50,915
Speaker 22:  in the show notes somewhere, but let's move on. Let's listen to the next

4388
04:15:50,915 --> 04:15:54,755
Speaker 5:  One. It's very good. All right, next up we have James Brown, first Real,

4389
04:15:54,755 --> 04:15:55,355
Speaker 5:  James Brown.

4390
04:15:55,935 --> 04:15:57,435
Speaker 25:  Wow. I feel,

4391
04:16:03,825 --> 04:16:04,795
Speaker 25:  feel good.

4392
04:16:08,395 --> 04:16:08,875
Speaker 25:  I the classic

4393
04:16:09,255 --> 04:16:09,635
Speaker 5:  An A

4394
04:16:09,635 --> 04:16:12,315
Speaker 22:  Timer and another one where If you're listening to The Verge House and you

4395
04:16:12,335 --> 04:16:14,995
Speaker 22:  if never heard this song, like, I don't know what you're doing. Yeah.

4396
04:16:15,175 --> 04:16:18,195
Speaker 5:  Go listen to Switch song. Go it. Exactly. You need it very badly. You're

4397
04:16:18,195 --> 04:16:18,595
Speaker 5:  right. Go to school

4398
04:16:18,595 --> 04:16:19,675
Speaker 22:  And then come on, come on home.

4399
04:16:19,855 --> 04:16:22,075
Speaker 5:  And now we have AI James Brown.

4400
04:16:23,895 --> 04:16:27,235
Speaker 25:  Wow. I feel good. I knew that I won.

4401
04:16:27,575 --> 04:16:28,275
Speaker 22:  That's spicy.

4402
04:16:31,435 --> 04:16:32,115
Speaker 25:  I feel good.

4403
04:16:33,835 --> 04:16:35,475
Speaker 25:  I knew that I would not

4404
04:16:38,215 --> 04:16:38,715
Speaker 25:  So good.

4405
04:16:38,985 --> 04:16:42,475
Speaker 5:  Okay, so This one I actually think is very fun because it, it is a little,

4406
04:16:43,185 --> 04:16:46,515
Speaker 5:  it's like a little tiny bit further away from it in the way that the first

4407
04:16:46,515 --> 04:16:49,955
Speaker 5:  one just is Johnny B. Good but worse. This one is like one

4408
04:16:50,545 --> 04:16:53,395
Speaker 5:  tiny tick. Yeah. This is a further away from being just the thing.

4409
04:16:53,505 --> 04:16:56,515
Speaker 22:  This is a lounge band with pretension where everyone's like, just play,

4410
04:16:56,545 --> 04:17:00,515
Speaker 22:  just play it the way that, can you stop it All right. Like we get it.

4411
04:17:00,575 --> 04:17:04,235
Speaker 22:  You, you, you, you thought you had something. I have one question about

4412
04:17:04,235 --> 04:17:07,675
Speaker 22:  this. And it, it actually felt the same way about Johnny B. Good.

4413
04:17:08,775 --> 04:17:11,955
Speaker 22:  The way these models work, right? Is you ingest a bunch of data into them.

4414
04:17:12,545 --> 04:17:16,275
Speaker 22:  They set a bunch of model weights and then they like statistically make

4415
04:17:16,295 --> 04:17:20,075
Speaker 22:  the next bit, right? They're just sort of like assembling the thing around

4416
04:17:20,075 --> 04:17:24,035
Speaker 22:  the prompt, which means they're kind of just assembling ones and zeros

4417
04:17:24,255 --> 04:17:27,315
Speaker 22:  to make a sound wave here. Which is pretty wild If you think about it. Like

4418
04:17:27,905 --> 04:17:30,675
Speaker 22:  that makes sense with words, right? What is statistically the next word

4419
04:17:30,675 --> 04:17:34,475
Speaker 22:  in the sentence around this prompt? When you get to like, what are the

4420
04:17:34,475 --> 04:17:38,115
Speaker 22:  ones and zeros of a sound file and you get to statistically hear the next

4421
04:17:38,115 --> 04:17:41,755
Speaker 22:  ones and zeros. That's pretty weird. It's actually a pretty weird way

4422
04:17:41,935 --> 04:17:45,755
Speaker 22:  to make an audio recording. And the thing that strikes me about

4423
04:17:45,925 --> 04:17:48,795
Speaker 22:  these, This one in particular, but the other one a little bit,

4424
04:17:49,735 --> 04:17:53,235
Speaker 22:  the instruments don't sound real at all. To me. Those horns sound so fake.

4425
04:17:53,455 --> 04:17:57,395
Speaker 22:  Not like synthesizer fake. No, but almost exactly like what you

4426
04:17:57,395 --> 04:18:01,315
Speaker 22:  would expect If you asked a computer to statistically produce a horn

4427
04:18:01,315 --> 04:18:04,915
Speaker 22:  section. Mm. Like it's almost played again. You're like, just listen to

4428
04:18:04,915 --> 04:18:05,675
Speaker 22:  it. It's so weird.

4429
04:18:07,495 --> 04:18:11,315
Speaker 25:  Wow. I feel good. I knew that I not,

4430
04:18:15,135 --> 04:18:16,915
Speaker 22:  Do you hear how like weird and thin it is?

4431
04:18:17,475 --> 04:18:18,995
Speaker 25:  I knew that I not

4432
04:18:21,695 --> 04:18:21,915
Speaker 25:  so

4433
04:18:23,705 --> 04:18:23,995
Speaker 25:  good.

4434
04:18:25,335 --> 04:18:28,995
Speaker 21:  It doesn't sound like an ensemble of tho it sounds like this weird

4435
04:18:28,995 --> 04:18:31,595
Speaker 21:  synthesized thing where the, the beginning of the sound or the end of the

4436
04:18:31,595 --> 04:18:35,355
Speaker 21:  sound is exactly lined up. The sound is, yeah, there's this

4437
04:18:35,355 --> 04:18:39,315
Speaker 21:  artifact in quality to it. This is like the pope's jacket version of

4438
04:18:39,315 --> 04:18:43,275
Speaker 21:  sound. Yes. It's like you got it close, but all the lines are

4439
04:18:43,275 --> 04:18:45,555
Speaker 21:  wrong. Why does he have seven fingers? Right.

4440
04:18:45,555 --> 04:18:49,195
Speaker 22:  It's a, it's a statistical approximation of a hand, right? Yeah. But as

4441
04:18:49,195 --> 04:18:52,995
Speaker 22:  expressed as a horn section, which is really weird to like just on its face

4442
04:18:53,055 --> 04:18:55,435
Speaker 22:  and you can, you know, people are like, it'll get better and blah blah blah.

4443
04:18:55,435 --> 04:18:58,795
Speaker 22:  But like you can act, to me you can hear a meaningful difference

4444
04:18:59,345 --> 04:19:03,315
Speaker 22:  once you know what you're listening for and it's like, oh, this

4445
04:19:03,315 --> 04:19:05,755
Speaker 22:  is a fake instrument. It's not a and it's not a fake instrument. The way

4446
04:19:05,755 --> 04:19:09,395
Speaker 22:  it's synthesizer is a fake instrument. Right. It's just fake. Like it doesn't,

4447
04:19:09,615 --> 04:19:10,795
Speaker 22:  it doesn't make any sense

4448
04:19:11,025 --> 04:19:13,635
Speaker 21:  Over the top all of all of it. Right Now, I don't know if this is a solvable

4449
04:19:13,635 --> 04:19:16,995
Speaker 21:  problem. I imagine it probably is is that everything sounds kind of

4450
04:19:17,335 --> 04:19:21,195
Speaker 21:  grainy. There's like this this top level, his kind of over the entire

4451
04:19:21,195 --> 04:19:24,835
Speaker 21:  recording of any AI output. It sounds maybe equivalent

4452
04:19:25,255 --> 04:19:28,795
Speaker 21:  to neli those files that you were not downloading

4453
04:19:29,535 --> 04:19:33,435
Speaker 21:  in college, but like the really low bit rate MP threes when

4454
04:19:33,595 --> 04:19:36,555
Speaker 21:  mp threes were actually noticeably worse. Yeah. That's what these sound

4455
04:19:36,555 --> 04:19:40,315
Speaker 21:  like. All of them have this artificial sheen on top

4456
04:19:40,315 --> 04:19:44,155
Speaker 21:  that sound very lo-fi in addition to artificial instruments.

4457
04:19:44,385 --> 04:19:47,475
Speaker 22:  Just a side note, I can't listen to the song in between days by the Cure

4458
04:19:47,665 --> 04:19:51,595
Speaker 22:  without mentally inserting the weird compression

4459
04:19:51,595 --> 04:19:55,035
Speaker 22:  artifacts at the high end. 'cause I listened to a shit MP three of that

4460
04:19:55,035 --> 04:19:58,635
Speaker 22:  song so many times that the symbols are just forever distorted in my brain.

4461
04:19:58,635 --> 04:19:58,835
Speaker 22:  There

4462
04:19:58,835 --> 04:20:02,035
Speaker 21:  There's literally a plugin and guitar pedal called Lossy

4463
04:20:02,985 --> 04:20:06,835
Speaker 21:  that is made to recreate the sound of early

4464
04:20:06,935 --> 04:20:08,435
Speaker 21:  two thousands mb threes.

4465
04:20:08,495 --> 04:20:09,555
Speaker 22:  That's very good. So If you

4466
04:20:09,555 --> 04:20:11,355
Speaker 21:  Need it, I can run it for loss. It's

4467
04:20:11,355 --> 04:20:14,675
Speaker 22:  The elder millennial button basically. Yeah. So that's the sound.

4468
04:20:15,105 --> 04:20:19,035
Speaker 22:  Yeah. Talk about the actual music here. Is this right with trying to

4469
04:20:19,035 --> 04:20:21,515
Speaker 22:  be good? You're like, that's straight copy infringement. This is weird,

4470
04:20:21,515 --> 04:20:23,635
Speaker 22:  right? It's like slant rhyme. Yeah. What do you think?

4471
04:20:24,755 --> 04:20:27,675
Speaker 21:  I think that it's the exact same rhythms.

4472
04:20:28,615 --> 04:20:31,995
Speaker 21:  I'd have to look at the notes. I think they're quite close. They're the

4473
04:20:31,995 --> 04:20:34,995
Speaker 21:  exact, if if they're in, they, maybe they're in a different key, but they're

4474
04:20:34,995 --> 04:20:38,595
Speaker 21:  like the same intervals moving in the same direction at the exact same time.

4475
04:20:39,265 --> 04:20:42,155
Speaker 21:  That would almost certainly lose in court

4476
04:20:43,055 --> 04:20:46,915
Speaker 21:  if these were, again, if I should be clear, the AI companies

4477
04:20:46,915 --> 04:20:50,235
Speaker 21:  are not being sued for the output. Yep. But these outputs, If you were to

4478
04:20:50,255 --> 04:20:53,955
Speaker 21:  try to make a case, I'm sure a judge would rule in favor

4479
04:20:54,135 --> 04:20:57,835
Speaker 21:  of the James Brown estate because it is the same

4480
04:20:57,985 --> 04:21:00,435
Speaker 21:  line. Well, it's more or less the same line. It's an interpolation of the

4481
04:21:00,435 --> 04:21:03,315
Speaker 21:  line. There's slightly different words, but it's the same rhythms, same

4482
04:21:03,315 --> 04:21:06,845
Speaker 21:  melody that almost always is going to, that's always, always gonna

4483
04:21:06,845 --> 04:21:09,565
Speaker 22:  Win. And here the the output is proof of the input. Right.

4484
04:21:09,565 --> 04:21:12,605
Speaker 5:  They're, they're not suing for the output. That's right. But the output seems

4485
04:21:12,605 --> 04:21:16,005
Speaker 5:  unusually important here in that respect. That it's, it's like

4486
04:21:16,385 --> 04:21:20,205
Speaker 5:  if, if UDO is doing the thing that it claimed to be doing,

4487
04:21:20,205 --> 04:21:23,085
Speaker 5:  which is, which is transforming stuff into other stuff,

4488
04:21:24,385 --> 04:21:27,365
Speaker 5:  we have a very different kind of fair use case. But reading through the RA's

4489
04:21:27,365 --> 04:21:30,405
Speaker 5:  lawsuit, like the thing they did over and over and over was just go reproduce

4490
04:21:30,405 --> 04:21:33,685
Speaker 5:  songs that exist in the world. Yep. And that's how we're fighting about training.

4491
04:21:33,685 --> 04:21:35,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like I, I went through and pulled a bunch of the prompts that they

4492
04:21:35,805 --> 04:21:39,685
Speaker 5:  use to get songs and we did the, the same thing. They're so funny. They're

4493
04:21:39,785 --> 04:21:43,645
Speaker 5:  so funny. Like to get to get the Green

4494
04:21:43,645 --> 04:21:46,925
Speaker 5:  Day song, I think it was American Idiot. The prompt is Pop punk, American

4495
04:21:46,925 --> 04:21:50,365
Speaker 5:  Alternative Rock, California 2004, Rob Ceva. Perfect

4496
04:21:52,185 --> 04:21:54,725
Speaker 22:  To get and the Way and that produced a Pastiche of American idiot.

4497
04:21:54,905 --> 04:21:55,125
Speaker 5:  Yes.

4498
04:21:55,435 --> 04:21:56,405
Speaker 22:  Amazing. To

4499
04:21:56,405 --> 04:22:00,125
Speaker 5:  Get My Girl By The Temptations. It was my tempting 1964 girl

4500
04:22:00,345 --> 04:22:04,045
Speaker 5:  Smokey Sing Hitsville Soul Pop Got My Girl by the Temptations.

4501
04:22:05,355 --> 04:22:09,245
Speaker 5:  This one you'll enjoy Neli to get All I want for Christmas is you by

4502
04:22:09,245 --> 04:22:13,205
Speaker 5:  Mariah Carey, my girl. The prompt is Mariah Carey. But with

4503
04:22:13,245 --> 04:22:16,525
Speaker 5:  a space between each letter so that it's not, 'cause presumably these things

4504
04:22:16,525 --> 04:22:18,725
Speaker 22:  Are trained because it's reading for pronouns, artist names.

4505
04:22:19,365 --> 04:22:22,565
Speaker 5:  So it's m space, a space all the way through the name Contemporary, that's

4506
04:22:22,565 --> 04:22:23,085
Speaker 22:  How I spell it.

4507
04:22:23,845 --> 04:22:26,845
Speaker 5:  A Grammy award-winning American singer songwriter, remarkable vocal range

4508
04:22:27,115 --> 04:22:30,485
Speaker 5:  that produced all in What for Christmas is you. I mean, there's,

4509
04:22:30,485 --> 04:22:33,045
Speaker 22:  There's means of, so it's what they're proving is that it's set, by the

4510
04:22:33,045 --> 04:22:35,525
Speaker 22:  way, the argument in response that I'm sure we're gonna hear, because this

4511
04:22:35,525 --> 04:22:39,485
Speaker 22:  is the argument opening I made about the Times lawsuit was one, no

4512
04:22:39,485 --> 04:22:42,885
Speaker 22:  human prompts like this and B, these prompts are so weird. They represent

4513
04:22:42,885 --> 04:22:46,845
Speaker 22:  a hack of our system, which is remarkable. But I'm

4514
04:22:47,035 --> 04:22:50,045
Speaker 22:  confident based on how open AI replied to the times that that is what these

4515
04:22:50,245 --> 04:22:50,525
Speaker 22:  companies will

4516
04:22:50,525 --> 04:22:54,325
Speaker 5:  Reply to. There is one very good one that the prompt was create a

4517
04:22:54,325 --> 04:22:58,285
Speaker 5:  song by an artist that rhymes with truce string bean that produced a Bruce

4518
04:22:58,285 --> 04:22:59,045
Speaker 5:  Springsteen song.

4519
04:22:59,045 --> 04:23:02,405
Speaker 22:  That's very good. It's fantastic. So I, so that question I asked Charlie

4520
04:23:02,415 --> 04:23:06,005
Speaker 22:  about the, do you, If you have the entire history of rock and roll, do you

4521
04:23:06,005 --> 04:23:09,805
Speaker 22:  need the first song right Or do you need Chuck Berry? Okay, maybe you

4522
04:23:09,805 --> 04:23:13,685
Speaker 22:  don't, maybe you do. Right? Like I think this third example is

4523
04:23:13,745 --> 04:23:17,725
Speaker 22:  the funniest example because I can't figure how you would get

4524
04:23:17,785 --> 04:23:21,485
Speaker 22:  to this without specifically one thing. Go ahead,

4525
04:23:21,485 --> 04:23:24,405
Speaker 5:  David. I'm glad you agreed because I left this for last for precisely this

4526
04:23:24,405 --> 04:23:27,725
Speaker 5:  reason. So here is, I won't even spoil it. Here's the real one.

4527
04:23:32,435 --> 04:23:33,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, okay. Right.

4528
04:23:33,995 --> 04:23:34,685
Speaker 22:  Everybody's

4529
04:23:34,685 --> 04:23:37,565
Speaker 5:  Heard it a million times. That's our boy, that's our voyage jd,

4530
04:23:39,345 --> 04:23:43,085
Speaker 21:  The longest lasting digital career that I never expected to happen. No,

4531
04:23:43,265 --> 04:23:43,485
Speaker 22:  No,

4532
04:23:45,345 --> 04:23:49,125
Speaker 5:  Go ahead. And here, here is the ai, I I just wanna say this was created by

4533
04:23:49,165 --> 04:23:52,925
Speaker 5:  a prompt on UDO. This is in theory a completely

4534
04:23:53,245 --> 04:23:54,885
Speaker 5:  synthetic new work of art.

4535
04:24:01,385 --> 04:24:01,605
Speaker 5:  Oh,

4536
04:24:01,605 --> 04:24:02,205
Speaker 25:  It's so good.

4537
04:24:05,145 --> 04:24:08,725
Speaker 22:  It does sound like a Jason Derulo song. Like my critique of Yes. Does this

4538
04:24:08,725 --> 04:24:10,005
Speaker 22:  sound like real music aside?

4539
04:24:10,355 --> 04:24:13,285
Speaker 5:  It's even got the little like vocal riff at the end. Like it's, it's, it's

4540
04:24:13,285 --> 04:24:16,565
Speaker 22:  Random. Does Jason Derulo sound like sympathetic music?

4541
04:24:17,025 --> 04:24:17,805
Speaker 22:  That's your problem?

4542
04:24:18,715 --> 04:24:22,245
Speaker 21:  This one's interesting though because you know, NELI, you've talked a lot

4543
04:24:22,245 --> 04:24:26,045
Speaker 21:  about the issue that likeness is not copyrightable, right? Yeah. And so

4544
04:24:26,295 --> 04:24:28,645
Speaker 21:  there there's a question of like, If, you know, we we're going back to this

4545
04:24:28,645 --> 04:24:32,285
Speaker 21:  hypothetical, there is no suit that's suing over this particular Jason

4546
04:24:32,415 --> 04:24:36,405
Speaker 21:  Dillo riff. Someone could just, I could say Jason Dillo on a song probably,

4547
04:24:36,465 --> 04:24:38,805
Speaker 21:  and it's not, you can't copyright that. So

4548
04:24:38,805 --> 04:24:42,645
Speaker 22:  You Wait, hold on, hold on. Oh, this is weird. So these tags,

4549
04:24:42,645 --> 04:24:43,845
Speaker 5:  Did we have this fight the last time with the Metro

4550
04:24:43,845 --> 04:24:46,925
Speaker 22:  Boomin tag? Yes. With the Metro Boomin song? So Metro Boomin's producer

4551
04:24:47,145 --> 04:24:50,805
Speaker 22:  tag was the copyrightable expression in the fake Drake song.

4552
04:24:51,265 --> 04:24:55,125
Speaker 21:  If it's exactly, if it's exactly the recording of the tag though, right?

4553
04:24:55,125 --> 04:24:58,885
Speaker 21:  Because it's, it's, it was, the issue was that the actually kept in

4554
04:24:59,425 --> 04:25:02,885
Speaker 21:  the sample of the producer tag. Right? And, and

4555
04:25:03,485 --> 04:25:06,525
Speaker 21:  reproducing a recording, you can copyright that. So

4556
04:25:06,545 --> 04:25:09,605
Speaker 5:  We could start every episode of The Vergecast with Neli singing Jason

4557
04:25:09,745 --> 04:25:11,085
Speaker 21:  Derulo, Jason Darulo, and get

4558
04:25:11,085 --> 04:25:11,765
Speaker 22:  Away with this. And we will,

4559
04:25:12,285 --> 04:25:16,005
Speaker 21:  I think you probably would have a lot of issues, a lot of nasty letters.

4560
04:25:16,585 --> 04:25:20,525
Speaker 22:  I'm saying in terms of ways to boost this podcast profile after 13

4561
04:25:20,525 --> 04:25:23,845
Speaker 22:  years, Jason Daro suing us is high on my list.

4562
04:25:24,225 --> 04:25:27,165
Speaker 21:  That's wonderful. This, but this, this definitely proves that like you had

4563
04:25:27,165 --> 04:25:30,885
Speaker 21:  to have had access. There is no monkeys in the back writing Shakespeare

4564
04:25:30,885 --> 04:25:33,405
Speaker 21:  that ends up on Jason Deo. It just doesn't happen. It's not possible.

4565
04:25:34,165 --> 04:25:37,285
Speaker 22:  Actually, I don't know. I think If you, If you took the worst impulses of

4566
04:25:37,285 --> 04:25:40,845
Speaker 22:  the music industry and fed them into an ai, you might produce Jason

4567
04:25:41,065 --> 04:25:41,485
Speaker 22:  Derulo.

4568
04:25:41,795 --> 04:25:45,045
Speaker 21:  This one's also important though because everything else we've heard has

4569
04:25:45,045 --> 04:25:48,965
Speaker 21:  been written by artists Pre Copyright Act of

4570
04:25:49,125 --> 04:25:52,965
Speaker 21:  1974 and probably also reflects some of maybe who the lawyers are

4571
04:25:52,965 --> 04:25:56,245
Speaker 21:  writing these, you know, these cases because

4572
04:25:58,065 --> 04:26:01,925
Speaker 21:  you know, we're talking about the cases reference Frank Sinatra.

4573
04:26:02,375 --> 04:26:06,205
Speaker 21:  Right. And to bring in Bruce Springsteen, actually that's

4574
04:26:06,305 --> 04:26:09,965
Speaker 22:  By 74, right? It's like Springsteen, Mariah Carey, green Day Johnny or Chuck

4575
04:26:10,085 --> 04:26:10,725
Speaker 22:  Berry. The

4576
04:26:10,725 --> 04:26:14,645
Speaker 21:  Early ones are all Chuck Berry like the Temptations. Right?

4577
04:26:14,645 --> 04:26:14,765
Speaker 21:  Are

4578
04:26:14,765 --> 04:26:15,765
Speaker 22:  You getting it? Like the judges

4579
04:26:15,825 --> 04:26:19,005
Speaker 21:  Are old. I'm seeing everyone. Yeah. And, and that's actually potentially

4580
04:26:19,005 --> 04:26:21,565
Speaker 21:  very advantageous in knowing the judge and who you might go in front of.

4581
04:26:21,665 --> 04:26:24,405
Speaker 21:  But then to show that also they're taking all the latest music as well.

4582
04:26:24,405 --> 04:26:26,085
Speaker 21:  Like we're, we're bringing in Jason Daro. Yes.

4583
04:26:26,115 --> 04:26:29,205
Speaker 22:  Like, judge, have you heard Your Honor, are you familiar with Jason Daro?

4584
04:26:29,365 --> 04:26:32,005
Speaker 21:  I wanna bring Jason Dillo into the courtroom. Jason Dillo,

4585
04:26:33,825 --> 04:26:37,725
Speaker 22:  By the way, another total side note. There's an incredible Katie Apollos

4586
04:26:37,725 --> 04:26:41,525
Speaker 22:  piece about hardcore Jason Dillo stands and what their

4587
04:26:41,525 --> 04:26:43,885
Speaker 22:  stand culture is like that I will dig up and put in the show notes.

4588
04:26:43,905 --> 04:26:45,325
Speaker 21:  Oh my gosh, that sounds fun. It's

4589
04:26:45,325 --> 04:26:49,085
Speaker 22:  Truly one of the funniest things I've ever read on the internet. Just because

4590
04:26:49,405 --> 04:26:52,325
Speaker 22:  A, it exists and B, because Katie is good at finding things like that, that

4591
04:26:52,325 --> 04:26:52,565
Speaker 22:  exist.

4592
04:26:52,835 --> 04:26:54,605
Speaker 21:  Have you all tried running these prompts by the way?

4593
04:26:55,625 --> 04:26:56,165
Speaker 22:  No. Have you?

4594
04:26:56,515 --> 04:27:00,285
Speaker 21:  Yeah. You can go to UIO and to Suno and you can run the prompts that

4595
04:27:00,425 --> 04:27:04,285
Speaker 21:  the, that these lawsuits are alleging and you don't get

4596
04:27:04,285 --> 04:27:08,245
Speaker 21:  the same songs obviously. But like If you write Make a jazz crooner

4597
04:27:08,245 --> 04:27:11,525
Speaker 21:  song about New York baritone voice, you'll definitely get

4598
04:27:12,035 --> 04:27:14,485
Speaker 21:  it's Frank Sinatra. There's just like, there's no other song but Frank's

4599
04:27:14,485 --> 04:27:16,045
Speaker 21:  and I don't think that that really is hacking the systems.

4600
04:27:18,115 --> 04:27:21,925
Speaker 21:  It's really easy. The other thing I get a lot, by the way, are

4601
04:27:22,665 --> 04:27:26,365
Speaker 21:  random prompt, Hey, that sounds strangely like Crazy

4602
04:27:26,475 --> 04:27:30,285
Speaker 21:  Town by Butterfly. My prompt was actually,

4603
04:27:30,405 --> 04:27:33,845
Speaker 21:  I tried to make a rap about American founder Thomas Butterfly

4604
04:27:33,845 --> 04:27:34,925
Speaker 22:  By Crazy Town. Yeah. Crazy.

4605
04:27:35,035 --> 04:27:36,565
Speaker 21:  Yeah. Sorry. Thank you. Butterfly by Crazy.

4606
04:27:36,565 --> 04:27:39,405
Speaker 22:  There's a band called Butterfly that had a song called Crazy Town that would

4607
04:27:39,405 --> 04:27:39,645
Speaker 22:  be perfect

4608
04:27:40,185 --> 04:27:44,085
Speaker 21:  In another universe. So I like uio. I'm sure there is. I tried to, I tried,

4609
04:27:44,245 --> 04:27:48,205
Speaker 21:  I did try to hack these systems a little bit and I wrote, I want you

4610
04:27:48,205 --> 04:27:52,005
Speaker 21:  to write a rap about American founder Thomas Jefferson about not throwing

4611
04:27:52,005 --> 04:27:55,885
Speaker 21:  away his shot nasal male rapper boom bap. And what I got

4612
04:27:55,985 --> 04:27:57,685
Speaker 21:  was basically Butterfly by Crazy Town.

4613
04:27:59,075 --> 04:28:00,245
Speaker 22:  Just like total random.

4614
04:28:00,835 --> 04:28:01,125
Speaker 21:  Yeah.

4615
04:28:01,925 --> 04:28:02,485
Speaker 27:  Cropping

4616
04:28:02,485 --> 04:28:03,205
Speaker 22:  Out the No

4617
04:28:03,785 --> 04:28:04,005
Speaker 21:  Tom

4618
04:28:04,005 --> 04:28:05,845
Speaker 27:  Jeff never slept tion

4619
04:28:08,555 --> 04:28:11,045
Speaker 27:  hypocrisy. Oh God.

4620
04:28:12,355 --> 04:28:13,165
Speaker 27:  Like fireworks.

4621
04:28:22,705 --> 04:28:26,685
Speaker 22:  I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to, I'm sorry for listening to this. And we subject

4622
04:28:26,685 --> 04:28:26,925
Speaker 22:  to you

4623
04:28:27,555 --> 04:28:30,165
Speaker 21:  That really is Butterfly by Crazy Town. I think it's also a little bit of

4624
04:28:30,245 --> 04:28:31,725
Speaker 21:  a, who is that song? Superman.

4625
04:28:32,625 --> 04:28:32,845
Speaker 22:  Yes.

4626
04:28:33,665 --> 04:28:35,445
Speaker 21:  Oh wow man. Who, who's Superman by

4627
04:28:36,915 --> 04:28:38,725
Speaker 22:  I'll be Your Kryptonite Orite that A horrible

4628
04:28:38,725 --> 04:28:41,965
Speaker 21:  Kryptonite. Yeah, kryptonite. Three doors down. Is that who? It's by three

4629
04:28:41,965 --> 04:28:42,925
Speaker 22:  Doors down. It is by three doors

4630
04:28:42,925 --> 04:28:46,045
Speaker 21:  Down. Oh, it's got a little bit of that. It's just, you can so easily

4631
04:28:46,755 --> 04:28:50,525
Speaker 21:  hear references that are not even the thing that you prompt. And I just,

4632
04:28:50,605 --> 04:28:54,565
Speaker 21:  I have to say that If you, right now, If you go to the homepage

4633
04:28:54,625 --> 04:28:58,245
Speaker 21:  of UDO, the two most popular attracts are exact

4634
04:28:58,375 --> 04:29:02,165
Speaker 21:  sound alikes of Eminem and Snoop Dogg. So people are doing this

4635
04:29:02,235 --> 04:29:04,565
Speaker 21:  like people are trying to make sound alikes.

4636
04:29:05,425 --> 04:29:08,925
Speaker 22:  So the argument from all these companies is, look, training is fair use.

4637
04:29:10,025 --> 04:29:13,165
Speaker 22:  And that's the argument for OpenAI. That's the argument for Google. It's

4638
04:29:13,165 --> 04:29:16,605
Speaker 22:  the argument for Suno and UDO, the

4639
04:29:17,045 --> 04:29:20,965
Speaker 22:  organization of these cases is different because the plaintiffs are different.

4640
04:29:20,965 --> 04:29:24,325
Speaker 22:  Right. The New York Times is situated differently than the major labels.

4641
04:29:24,325 --> 04:29:26,765
Speaker 22:  People have different emotional relationships with different kinds of work.

4642
04:29:27,345 --> 04:29:30,485
Speaker 22:  But this is the argument, like when Google eventually goes and Sues opening

4643
04:29:30,505 --> 04:29:34,125
Speaker 22:  eye for training on YouTube, the weirdness of that argument is Google

4644
04:29:34,125 --> 04:29:38,005
Speaker 22:  telling open ai, the training on YouTube is not fair. Like that's

4645
04:29:38,005 --> 04:29:41,405
Speaker 22:  what's gonna happen here. Mm. It's all the same argument and it's all kind

4646
04:29:41,405 --> 04:29:41,685
Speaker 22:  of in a

4647
04:29:41,685 --> 04:29:45,605
Speaker 21:  Circle. Wait, so Google can do it and it's fair use, but Suno and UIO

4648
04:29:45,605 --> 04:29:47,565
Speaker 21:  cannot do it because it's not fair use. This is,

4649
04:29:47,565 --> 04:29:49,885
Speaker 22:  This is the trap the industry has set for itself

4650
04:29:50,145 --> 04:29:50,685
Speaker 21:  And our giant,

4651
04:29:50,705 --> 04:29:53,885
Speaker 22:  What's that line Consolidated? Yeah. Right. It's like it's all the same

4652
04:29:54,185 --> 04:29:56,245
Speaker 22:  VCs in all in all different directions. Kind

4653
04:29:56,245 --> 04:29:56,925
Speaker 21:  Of like the music business.

4654
04:29:57,265 --> 04:30:00,165
Speaker 22:  That's true. There's that line though that's like, you have to be perfect

4655
04:30:00,175 --> 04:30:03,565
Speaker 22:  every time and I just have to get through once. Mm. Yeah. It's like

4656
04:30:04,245 --> 04:30:06,885
Speaker 22:  I can't, I don't remember exactly what it is. That's what, that's like

4657
04:30:06,885 --> 04:30:09,565
Speaker 5:  The hacker creed, right? Like you have to stop me every time. All I have

4658
04:30:09,565 --> 04:30:11,285
Speaker 5:  to do is fi I just have to get through once. Yeah.

4659
04:30:11,285 --> 04:30:15,125
Speaker 22:  Yeah. And that is, that feels like that copyright situation for AI

4660
04:30:15,125 --> 04:30:18,485
Speaker 22:  right now, this is a house of cards and

4661
04:30:18,855 --> 04:30:22,725
Speaker 22:  maybe, maybe the Times will win, maybe the

4662
04:30:22,725 --> 04:30:26,565
Speaker 22:  record labels will win Mary, maybe Sarah Silverman will win. Like

4663
04:30:27,015 --> 04:30:30,845
Speaker 22:  there are so many of these, maybe Google and Open Eye reach an

4664
04:30:30,845 --> 04:30:34,005
Speaker 22:  agreement about training on YouTube and then a bunch of YouTube creators

4665
04:30:34,305 --> 04:30:38,285
Speaker 22:  sue and maybe they win. Like you can just game it out a hundred

4666
04:30:38,285 --> 04:30:42,245
Speaker 22:  different ways. The at some point someone is gonna win a lawsuit that says

4667
04:30:42,485 --> 04:30:44,005
Speaker 22:  training is not fair use. Yeah.

4668
04:30:44,545 --> 04:30:48,485
Speaker 21:  The fair use argument here, I feel like is notable, I feel like is

4669
04:30:48,575 --> 04:30:52,485
Speaker 21:  quite different than what the New York Times can claim. Because part of

4670
04:30:52,485 --> 04:30:56,365
Speaker 21:  fair use is for example, the effect on the potential market. Right.

4671
04:30:56,825 --> 04:31:00,805
Speaker 21:  And with New York Times, they're gonna have to argue, well, you know, you're

4672
04:31:00,805 --> 04:31:04,645
Speaker 21:  using our articles and other people are taking that and

4673
04:31:04,805 --> 04:31:08,285
Speaker 21:  creating texts and putting it on other pseudo journalistic sites. Right.

4674
04:31:08,925 --> 04:31:11,645
Speaker 22:  I I, I'm, I'm pretty sure the times assuming for both the output and the

4675
04:31:11,805 --> 04:31:11,925
Speaker 22:  training.

4676
04:31:12,405 --> 04:31:12,925
Speaker 21:  I see. Okay.

4677
04:31:13,105 --> 04:31:16,165
Speaker 22:  So I I I I think these cases are all different. This is what I mean, like

4678
04:31:16,465 --> 04:31:19,565
Speaker 22:  the, the strategy for one doesn't work for all of them in the same way.

4679
04:31:19,565 --> 04:31:19,845
Speaker 22:  Right?

4680
04:31:19,845 --> 04:31:23,765
Speaker 21:  Right. In the case of music, the marketplace argument like does is

4681
04:31:23,765 --> 04:31:27,165
Speaker 21:  it going to affect the marketplace? Is I I think they have a very strong

4682
04:31:27,365 --> 04:31:29,765
Speaker 21:  argument here. I think the RIA has a very strong argument. They're basically

4683
04:31:29,765 --> 04:31:33,685
Speaker 21:  saying Suno and nio, you are charging users money

4684
04:31:33,825 --> 04:31:37,725
Speaker 21:  to make songs that you are allowing them to upload to the exact same

4685
04:31:37,725 --> 04:31:41,565
Speaker 21:  place where we also have all of our songs into Spotify, apple Music,

4686
04:31:41,665 --> 04:31:44,965
Speaker 21:  et cetera. And so you are actually changing the marketplace

4687
04:31:45,705 --> 04:31:49,685
Speaker 21:  for music, having used all of this output. But

4688
04:31:49,685 --> 04:31:51,685
Speaker 21:  is that, is that not part of the argument you're saying?

4689
04:31:52,165 --> 04:31:55,685
Speaker 22:  I I think we have to find out how that shakes out.

4690
04:31:56,135 --> 04:31:59,885
Speaker 22:  Right? Like I, I don't know. They gotta get

4691
04:32:00,045 --> 04:32:02,405
Speaker 22:  assigned a judge, right? Like Right, right now what they've done is they

4692
04:32:02,405 --> 04:32:04,605
Speaker 22:  put out a complaint in a press release. There hasn't been a reply to that

4693
04:32:04,805 --> 04:32:08,485
Speaker 22:  complaint or an answer. They haven't been assigned a judge. Like they haven't

4694
04:32:08,485 --> 04:32:11,565
Speaker 22:  done any discovery. Like we just don't know a bunch of stuff. And we certainly

4695
04:32:11,565 --> 04:32:15,245
Speaker 22:  don't know where they're gonna put their focus. But that part where

4696
04:32:15,515 --> 04:32:19,005
Speaker 22:  copyright law is just about making copies and in the history of computing,

4697
04:32:19,415 --> 04:32:23,365
Speaker 22:  every single copy has been litigated down to, again, I bring it

4698
04:32:23,365 --> 04:32:26,565
Speaker 22:  up, I think I bring it up MA every time. MAI versus peak systems. You go

4699
04:32:26,565 --> 04:32:30,405
Speaker 22:  look it up. This is, are you a third party software

4700
04:32:30,625 --> 04:32:34,485
Speaker 22:  seller allowed to load software into a computer's memory

4701
04:32:34,485 --> 04:32:38,445
Speaker 22:  without permission? Crazy. A court, a crazy court case.

4702
04:32:38,555 --> 04:32:41,765
Speaker 22:  Yeah. Can you put a disc in a computer and load software from the disc to

4703
04:32:41,765 --> 04:32:45,005
Speaker 22:  the hard drive without my permission got litigated and they lost.

4704
04:32:45,735 --> 04:32:49,165
Speaker 22:  Crazy. They lost. And then we had to get all the way through caching our

4705
04:32:49,165 --> 04:32:52,205
Speaker 22:  ephemeral copies on your ISPs network

4706
04:32:52,995 --> 04:32:56,805
Speaker 22:  equipment or those copies that should be litigated. This is,

4707
04:32:57,315 --> 04:33:01,165
Speaker 22:  it's, it's dumb. Like it is a very dumb rationale, but

4708
04:33:01,165 --> 04:33:04,965
Speaker 22:  it litigates the creation of copies. So here it's did you have

4709
04:33:04,975 --> 04:33:08,725
Speaker 22:  permission to make a copy to train your model

4710
04:33:09,185 --> 04:33:12,085
Speaker 22:  of all these songs and e every time you didn't have permission. By the way,

4711
04:33:12,085 --> 04:33:16,005
Speaker 22:  we want this statutory maximum of $150,000, which

4712
04:33:16,005 --> 04:33:18,045
Speaker 22:  essentially ends up being a pretend amount of money. It

4713
04:33:18,115 --> 04:33:19,685
Speaker 21:  It's gotta be bigger than the US GDP.

4714
04:33:19,925 --> 04:33:22,285
Speaker 22:  Yeah. It's like crazy, right? Like, did you have permission to copy every

4715
04:33:22,285 --> 04:33:25,805
Speaker 22:  song in the world? And If you didn't, every song in the world times $150,000

4716
04:33:25,805 --> 04:33:26,525
Speaker 22:  is what we're asking for.

4717
04:33:26,745 --> 04:33:27,445
Speaker 21:  I'm gonna run this

4718
04:33:27,945 --> 04:33:31,525
Speaker 22:  If you didn't have that permission, can we do an analysis that says that

4719
04:33:31,525 --> 04:33:35,485
Speaker 22:  use is fair use? Right. So fair use is what's called an affirmative

4720
04:33:35,485 --> 04:33:39,205
Speaker 22:  defense to copyright infringement. Where you, you, you admit it like I

4721
04:33:39,265 --> 04:33:42,885
Speaker 22:  did, I did it. But under this other rationale, it's That's fine.

4722
04:33:43,545 --> 04:33:47,005
Speaker 22:  And so that's like the winding path here is,

4723
04:33:47,435 --> 04:33:51,325
Speaker 22:  well first they won't even cop to having made the copies, which

4724
04:33:51,325 --> 04:33:54,925
Speaker 22:  is why the music industry is putting out, well here's just Johnny B. Good.

4725
04:33:54,925 --> 04:33:58,285
Speaker 22:  Like you can't output Johnny B. Good unless you copy Johnny B. Good on the,

4726
04:33:58,285 --> 04:34:02,205
Speaker 22:  on the front end. Right. Okay. So first we gotta get them to copy to making

4727
04:34:02,265 --> 04:34:05,765
Speaker 22:  the copies at all, which they claim is proprietary business information.

4728
04:34:06,395 --> 04:34:10,325
Speaker 22:  Sure. Then it's was that copy allowed,

4729
04:34:10,595 --> 04:34:12,565
Speaker 22:  they obviously didn't have permission. This is why they're in a lawsuit.

4730
04:34:12,705 --> 04:34:16,445
Speaker 22:  And then it, and then it's, is it fair use? And then we run the analysis.

4731
04:34:17,065 --> 04:34:19,765
Speaker 22:  And the analysis is like the purpose and character of the use, the amount

4732
04:34:19,765 --> 04:34:23,565
Speaker 22:  of the use, the nature of the use, the, and then the last factor

4733
04:34:23,565 --> 04:34:26,645
Speaker 22:  is the effect on the market, right? On the output side. I think the market

4734
04:34:27,005 --> 04:34:27,965
Speaker 22:  argument is really strong.

4735
04:34:27,965 --> 04:34:30,765
Speaker 21:  Right? Right. So the question is, 'cause this case, this is something I

4736
04:34:30,885 --> 04:34:33,285
Speaker 21:  actually don't understand. Maybe you can explain with your copyright law

4737
04:34:33,285 --> 04:34:36,605
Speaker 21:  degree. Can, can, is there like some

4738
04:34:37,035 --> 04:34:40,645
Speaker 21:  wall between the input and the output in, in this argument that says,

4739
04:34:41,595 --> 04:34:43,045
Speaker 21:  well, there's no marketplace for, you know, that

4740
04:34:43,045 --> 04:34:46,245
Speaker 22:  Emoji, it's like this with the hands. Yeah, it's the hands are up. Like

4741
04:34:46,245 --> 04:34:47,965
Speaker 22:  I'm just that emoji right now. Yeah. I don't

4742
04:34:48,125 --> 04:34:51,565
Speaker 21:  Know. 'cause 'cause I was trying to say, oh, well if there's a clear change

4743
04:34:51,565 --> 04:34:54,765
Speaker 21:  in the marketplace for songs, which are all outputs, but it sounds like,

4744
04:34:54,905 --> 04:34:56,765
Speaker 21:  you know, we don't know what the responses are gonna be, but they could

4745
04:34:56,765 --> 04:34:59,325
Speaker 21:  say, well there isn't currently a marketplace for training data in this

4746
04:34:59,325 --> 04:35:02,485
Speaker 21:  kind of way. And so it's not affecting that marketplace. But

4747
04:35:02,485 --> 04:35:06,285
Speaker 22:  If you, there will never be a market If you just set the rate in

4748
04:35:06,405 --> 04:35:10,205
Speaker 22:  zero. Right? Right. So if you're like, I want really high

4749
04:35:10,205 --> 04:35:13,845
Speaker 22:  quality music for my high quality music

4750
04:35:14,185 --> 04:35:18,005
Speaker 22:  AI program, I'm gonna go pay a bunch of artists, but then these guys

4751
04:35:18,005 --> 04:35:21,125
Speaker 22:  come along and steal it. But you've just, you've actually preemptively destroyed

4752
04:35:21,125 --> 04:35:24,045
Speaker 22:  the market. Sure. You've never allowed that market to set some rates. And

4753
04:35:24,045 --> 04:35:27,245
Speaker 22:  I've heard from publishers who are taking the deals with opening AI disclosure

4754
04:35:27,245 --> 04:35:30,165
Speaker 22:  of Vox Media has a content licensing deal with opening ai.

4755
04:35:31,395 --> 04:35:34,085
Speaker 22:  I've heard from other publishers, not our company, that one of the reasons

4756
04:35:34,085 --> 04:35:37,965
Speaker 22:  they've taken these deals is to create that market, right? Hmm.

4757
04:35:38,025 --> 04:35:41,325
Speaker 22:  So that the times can go to court and say, this has an effect on the market.

4758
04:35:41,795 --> 04:35:45,685
Speaker 22:  Look at this market, look at the money that's moving around.

4759
04:35:46,185 --> 04:35:49,005
Speaker 22:  And so some of these publishers are, are playing kind of a strategic game

4760
04:35:49,005 --> 04:35:52,685
Speaker 22:  to say we should create a market to help that factor along. I think that's

4761
04:35:53,205 --> 04:35:57,085
Speaker 22:  fascinating. Hmm. The, but I don't think that the AI company,

4762
04:35:57,325 --> 04:36:01,245
Speaker 22:  I think they thought they could just buy forgiveness. And what's crazy

4763
04:36:01,385 --> 04:36:05,325
Speaker 22:  to me is when it was Napster or YouTube or Google search,

4764
04:36:05,325 --> 04:36:09,005
Speaker 22:  even buying forgiveness worked because people liked the companies,

4765
04:36:09,475 --> 04:36:12,805
Speaker 22:  they liked the products, they liked the experiences they were having. And

4766
04:36:13,035 --> 04:36:16,965
Speaker 22:  here people, I mean, I'm con you, if you're listening to

4767
04:36:16,965 --> 04:36:19,565
Speaker 22:  this and you have a, a very different view of this, lemme know, but our

4768
04:36:19,845 --> 04:36:23,605
Speaker 22:  audience is pretty loud with us that they don't like these companies and

4769
04:36:23,605 --> 04:36:27,565
Speaker 22:  they don't, they, they perceive this as a moral problem. And I,

4770
04:36:27,685 --> 04:36:30,365
Speaker 22:  I think that's just a very different position for them all to be in. Which

4771
04:36:30,365 --> 04:36:34,085
Speaker 21:  Brings us to your moral quandary. It seems like you flipped sides from 20

4772
04:36:34,085 --> 04:36:34,565
Speaker 21:  years ago.

4773
04:36:34,835 --> 04:36:38,605
Speaker 22:  Yeah. The idea that I'm sitting here being like the RIA as a point is crazy.

4774
04:36:38,795 --> 04:36:42,685
Speaker 22:  Like I, it's bananas and Sarah Jung and I have been like all day,

4775
04:36:42,685 --> 04:36:46,525
Speaker 22:  every day like slacking. Like who have we become? You know, this is like

4776
04:36:46,525 --> 04:36:49,405
Speaker 22:  the horseshoe theory of copyright law, politics.

4777
04:36:51,115 --> 04:36:55,045
Speaker 22:  It's weird, man. And I, I think one of the pieces of the puzzle, and

4778
04:36:55,045 --> 04:36:57,965
Speaker 22:  I'm curious how you see this in the music industry itself, Charlie, one

4779
04:36:57,965 --> 04:37:01,845
Speaker 22:  of the pieces of the puzzle here is that the internet just blew the

4780
04:37:01,945 --> 04:37:05,885
Speaker 22:  bottom outta the music industry. Like there's no, there's no way to

4781
04:37:05,885 --> 04:37:09,245
Speaker 22:  be like a middle class musician anymore. There's no guaranteed way to make

4782
04:37:09,245 --> 04:37:12,005
Speaker 22:  money. You're like, you're playing the same algorithmic game as everyone

4783
04:37:12,005 --> 04:37:15,525
Speaker 22:  else. You're beholden to some labels. You don't have any power as an individual

4784
04:37:15,525 --> 04:37:18,965
Speaker 22:  against these platforms. So now this next group of people

4785
04:37:19,215 --> 04:37:23,005
Speaker 22:  who's come and taken your work for free and is gonna extract value

4786
04:37:23,005 --> 04:37:26,965
Speaker 22:  from you. Well sure. Like the enemy of my enemy is

4787
04:37:26,965 --> 04:37:30,685
Speaker 22:  my friend. It's, it's kind of the vibe. But I'm wondering If you see that

4788
04:37:30,685 --> 04:37:31,965
Speaker 22:  reflected in the actual music industry.

4789
04:37:32,365 --> 04:37:35,405
Speaker 21:  Absolutely. I mean, the public perception here is so different than what

4790
04:37:35,405 --> 04:37:38,805
Speaker 21:  was happening back in the Napster era. Back in the Napster era, the labels

4791
04:37:38,995 --> 04:37:42,765
Speaker 21:  were enemy number one. Selling out to labels was, was a big, you know,

4792
04:37:42,875 --> 04:37:46,525
Speaker 21:  they were, they were, they were the worst players today. I actually think

4793
04:37:46,605 --> 04:37:50,445
Speaker 21:  they've done a very effective job of using their proxy Spotify and let

4794
04:37:50,445 --> 04:37:53,165
Speaker 21:  Spotify be the enemy. And everyone's like Sony Music. Who are they? Like

4795
04:37:53,225 --> 04:37:56,845
Speaker 21:  Warner, UMG. Like they have labeled deals, but they are not, they're, they're

4796
04:37:56,845 --> 04:38:00,285
Speaker 21:  not the, the topic of conversation of who's really screwing who now they

4797
04:38:00,285 --> 04:38:03,885
Speaker 21:  basically help set the rates of what gets paid out in streaming. And

4798
04:38:03,995 --> 04:38:06,765
Speaker 21:  it's the distributors now that really are taking all the heat. And so they're

4799
04:38:06,885 --> 04:38:09,925
Speaker 21:  actually in a better, I think, place of public perception in terms of within

4800
04:38:09,925 --> 04:38:12,645
Speaker 21:  the music industry. I, I see

4801
04:38:13,275 --> 04:38:17,085
Speaker 21:  songwriters, producers, fans totally freaked

4802
04:38:17,085 --> 04:38:20,845
Speaker 21:  out about what's going on. When you go and scan through a lot of the,

4803
04:38:21,085 --> 04:38:24,525
Speaker 21:  the YouTube comments of some of these AI songs.

4804
04:38:25,065 --> 04:38:28,965
Speaker 21:  The, the sentiment is we are screwed. Music

4805
04:38:29,065 --> 04:38:32,765
Speaker 21:  is over. I give up. I am not learning an instrument. Like

4806
04:38:32,835 --> 04:38:36,405
Speaker 21:  it's, it's sort of, it, it is not, the future is bright. We're gonna create

4807
04:38:36,425 --> 04:38:39,965
Speaker 21:  new beautiful music. Like my creativity is going to blossom.

4808
04:38:41,045 --> 04:38:44,925
Speaker 21:  I think that there is a, a real existential fear that is exists within all

4809
04:38:44,925 --> 04:38:47,765
Speaker 21:  of the, you know, the AI world. But you're, you're getting into like our

4810
04:38:47,765 --> 04:38:50,965
Speaker 21:  human emotions and the beautiful creative output, hopefully beautiful. I

4811
04:38:50,965 --> 04:38:52,245
Speaker 21:  mean, listen how you feel about pop

4812
04:38:52,245 --> 04:38:53,325
Speaker 22:  Music, whatever Jason Deru

4813
04:38:54,695 --> 04:38:55,885
Speaker 21:  Don't bring Jason into this.

4814
04:38:57,025 --> 04:38:58,685
Speaker 22:  We gotta get derulo on the po I don't

4815
04:38:58,685 --> 04:38:59,205
Speaker 21:  Well and really do.

4816
04:38:59,205 --> 04:39:02,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's obviously like reading through the RA's lawsuit like that is

4817
04:39:02,795 --> 04:39:06,165
Speaker 5:  they talk about the creativity and, and human emotion of it all. Yes.

4818
04:39:06,985 --> 04:39:10,765
Speaker 5:  But is the, is the end of this just they're trying to get

4819
04:39:10,765 --> 04:39:14,005
Speaker 5:  checks in the same way that there are absolutely a lot of folks out there

4820
04:39:14,005 --> 04:39:16,805
Speaker 5:  just trying to get checks. Like, well, 'cause part of me, like I I think

4821
04:39:16,805 --> 04:39:20,125
Speaker 5:  obviously that's the answer. But also part of me wonders if the labels are

4822
04:39:20,125 --> 04:39:23,725
Speaker 5:  feeling the same way that you do, which is that, oh, this is not just a thing

4823
04:39:23,725 --> 04:39:26,205
Speaker 5:  we need to make money off of tomorrow. This is like an existential crisis

4824
04:39:26,305 --> 04:39:29,645
Speaker 5:  for our business down the road. Or if they're like, whatever, this is just

4825
04:39:29,685 --> 04:39:31,285
Speaker 5:  a new turn, we have to make sure we get

4826
04:39:31,285 --> 04:39:34,365
Speaker 21:  Paid. This is an existential crisis because they are already losing market

4827
04:39:34,375 --> 04:39:38,005
Speaker 21:  share to, you know, people who are not on major labels. Major

4828
04:39:38,095 --> 04:39:42,085
Speaker 21:  label listening is down, right? As an overall

4829
04:39:42,085 --> 04:39:44,725
Speaker 21:  share of all listening, it's still a lot of, it's still the majority of

4830
04:39:44,725 --> 04:39:47,885
Speaker 21:  listening. But so they recognize that flooding

4831
04:39:48,785 --> 04:39:51,845
Speaker 21:  the streamers with more and more independent music has not necessarily been

4832
04:39:51,845 --> 04:39:55,565
Speaker 21:  good for their business. And with more flooding, it's just going to bring

4833
04:39:55,565 --> 04:39:59,045
Speaker 21:  everything down to everything as valueless entirely. If you own music

4834
04:39:59,425 --> 04:40:03,085
Speaker 21:  and it gets played a lot on streaming, there's a lot of money in it.

4835
04:40:03,235 --> 04:40:05,885
Speaker 21:  Like there's billions and billions and billions of dollars in streaming.

4836
04:40:06,225 --> 04:40:08,765
Speaker 21:  How it's distributed is not always fair. And people get upset about this,

4837
04:40:09,185 --> 04:40:12,805
Speaker 21:  but they very much need to figure out how to, how, how, how to enter and

4838
04:40:12,805 --> 04:40:16,405
Speaker 21:  participate in this marketplace. And I think kind of like a content ID system,

4839
04:40:16,475 --> 04:40:20,405
Speaker 21:  they want to figure out how to properly license. You wanna use Jason Doll's

4840
04:40:20,405 --> 04:40:23,445
Speaker 21:  voice? Dre Duro says yes and it costs this, and now we've got Jason Dollo

4841
04:40:23,445 --> 04:40:24,205
Speaker 21:  copies and that's okay.

4842
04:40:24,305 --> 04:40:28,005
Speaker 22:  By the way, if all of the artists who would let his voice go deep fake to

4843
04:40:28,005 --> 04:40:29,125
Speaker 22:  make like commercials. Jason

4844
04:40:29,175 --> 04:40:29,925
Speaker 21:  Dillo. Yeah. Jason

4845
04:40:29,995 --> 04:40:33,925
Speaker 22:  Daro. Look, I, it's, I'm not, I'm not even saying I've, I've talked a lot

4846
04:40:33,925 --> 04:40:37,885
Speaker 22:  of Jason Dillo related ish on this episode. I'm aware of it. I just know

4847
04:40:37,885 --> 04:40:41,325
Speaker 22:  that he is a commercial mastermind. Yes. But that man's gonna make a bag

4848
04:40:41,425 --> 04:40:45,245
Speaker 22:  no matter what happens. Yes. Friend of the pod, Blake

4849
04:40:45,365 --> 04:40:48,365
Speaker 22:  Reed, he is a professor at Colorado Law, teaches copyright, telecom, all

4850
04:40:48,365 --> 04:40:52,165
Speaker 22:  this stuff. He wrote me a note last week or the week before

4851
04:40:52,225 --> 04:40:54,685
Speaker 22:  and he said something really smart that I've been thinking about. And it's

4852
04:40:54,685 --> 04:40:58,215
Speaker 22:  related to what you're saying, David, copyright law is like a

4853
04:40:58,935 --> 04:41:02,775
Speaker 22:  economic system, right? We create scarcity and then we can like charge

4854
04:41:02,895 --> 04:41:05,135
Speaker 22:  money for things. 'cause you're not allowed to just like freely copy them.

4855
04:41:05,675 --> 04:41:09,535
Speaker 22:  So If you do something bad in the world of copyright law, the

4856
04:41:09,675 --> 04:41:13,655
Speaker 22:  answer is you pay money and you fix it. And you, you even out the

4857
04:41:13,895 --> 04:41:17,575
Speaker 22:  economic problem that you've created, right? Olivia Rodrigo

4858
04:41:17,905 --> 04:41:21,855
Speaker 22:  might have sung four notes to the Taylor Swift song. The answer is, Taylor

4859
04:41:21,855 --> 04:41:24,815
Speaker 22:  Swift gets a writing credit and then some money flows to Taylor Swift. And

4860
04:41:24,815 --> 04:41:27,735
Speaker 22:  that is the end of that story, right? And it's just an economic problem

4861
04:41:27,735 --> 04:41:31,575
Speaker 22:  that you've solved by redistributing money. AI is a moral problem. This

4862
04:41:31,575 --> 04:41:34,055
Speaker 22:  is the thing Blake pointed out to me is like, the money doesn't solve the

4863
04:41:34,055 --> 04:41:37,455
Speaker 22:  perceived moral issue here. So the labels might get paid, they might find

4864
04:41:37,455 --> 04:41:40,455
Speaker 22:  some business model that lets some license the music into perpetuity or

4865
04:41:40,615 --> 04:41:43,735
Speaker 22:  whatever. But the thing you're seeing in the YouTube comments, the thing

4866
04:41:43,755 --> 04:41:46,775
Speaker 22:  our audience is feeling, the thing I think a lot of artists are feeling

4867
04:41:47,325 --> 04:41:51,055
Speaker 22:  does not get solved by money. Right? It it, it's like another problem.

4868
04:41:51,465 --> 04:41:54,845
Speaker 22:  And so like you, you see these deals come up and get signed and whatever,

4869
04:41:55,185 --> 04:41:59,105
Speaker 22:  and everyone's like, eh, it's still pretty icky, right? And there, there's

4870
04:41:59,105 --> 04:42:02,145
Speaker 22:  something there that I think is important. I haven't quite puzzled it out.

4871
04:42:02,465 --> 04:42:06,145
Speaker 22:  I actually want to do something with that idea. If you have further

4872
04:42:06,145 --> 04:42:09,825
Speaker 22:  thoughts, let me know what you think about it. But that gap is the gap,

4873
04:42:10,575 --> 04:42:14,405
Speaker 22:  right? We can move a bunch of money around, like the VCs in Hollywood

4874
04:42:14,465 --> 04:42:18,365
Speaker 22:  and the recording in in Streets Association of America. God bless

4875
04:42:18,365 --> 04:42:22,205
Speaker 22:  them, they will move the money around. Lucian Grange will get paid.

4876
04:42:23,025 --> 04:42:26,485
Speaker 22:  Is that gonna solve the other problem? Right? Like, and that's, I think

4877
04:42:26,485 --> 04:42:27,845
Speaker 22:  that's really hard. There's

4878
04:42:27,845 --> 04:42:31,325
Speaker 21:  Two things that musicians need to not fear. One is that because

4879
04:42:31,785 --> 04:42:35,605
Speaker 21:  the output of all of these models cannot be copywritten, this

4880
04:42:35,605 --> 04:42:39,125
Speaker 21:  music is kind of in this weird limbo space. Like maybe it's going to def

4881
04:42:39,585 --> 04:42:43,365
Speaker 21:  it will definitely find some streams, but it probably won't be synced on

4882
04:42:43,365 --> 04:42:47,125
Speaker 21:  television and film because no TV producer is gonna

4883
04:42:47,125 --> 04:42:50,525
Speaker 21:  wanna have a song where they like don't really understand the rights associated

4884
04:42:50,525 --> 04:42:53,805
Speaker 21:  with that song. And if they have the right to it, and does it also secretly

4885
04:42:54,275 --> 04:42:58,085
Speaker 21:  contain a vocal sample of James Brown that has been stolen. Like

4886
04:42:58,225 --> 04:43:01,645
Speaker 21:  so nobody wants to, any rights holder doesn't want to use this music that

4887
04:43:01,645 --> 04:43:04,805
Speaker 21:  can't be used in a weird way. So I think composers and people who are putting

4888
04:43:04,805 --> 04:43:07,285
Speaker 21:  stuff on TV, in film, I think that they're still very much a business for

4889
04:43:07,285 --> 04:43:11,245
Speaker 21:  them until these much bigger legal issues get sorted out.

4890
04:43:11,345 --> 04:43:14,205
Speaker 21:  The other places that music is about human connection. And I don't say this

4891
04:43:14,205 --> 04:43:17,725
Speaker 21:  in some like wishy-washy way. It's like there is no fandom

4892
04:43:18,065 --> 04:43:21,245
Speaker 21:  for Olivia Rodrigo without an Olivia. Rodrigo. Like you need the person.

4893
04:43:21,665 --> 04:43:24,645
Speaker 21:  The time that the music industry tried to create like an avatar

4894
04:43:25,845 --> 04:43:29,725
Speaker 21:  racially strangely coded, what

4895
04:43:29,725 --> 04:43:33,565
Speaker 21:  was that guy's name? It was terrible. They tried to do like their NFT

4896
04:43:33,625 --> 04:43:37,445
Speaker 21:  avatar Pop star and it was an utter failure both because it was

4897
04:43:37,445 --> 04:43:41,045
Speaker 21:  completely racist and because why would we develop a relationship to this

4898
04:43:41,045 --> 04:43:44,885
Speaker 21:  thing? And so the the fandom side, the pop stardom side of

4899
04:43:44,885 --> 04:43:46,725
Speaker 21:  pop music, I don't think is ever gonna go away. What

4900
04:43:46,725 --> 04:43:50,445
Speaker 22:  About Uni miko, right? Isn't that she's, she's like the cartoon

4901
04:43:50,555 --> 04:43:54,475
Speaker 22:  character. I just learned that she's officially code named CVO

4902
04:43:54,575 --> 04:43:54,795
Speaker 22:  one.

4903
04:43:55,545 --> 04:43:58,915
Speaker 21:  Yeah, there are the, there are these avatar characters that are finding

4904
04:43:58,915 --> 04:44:02,835
Speaker 21:  some fandoms online. Yes, that's gonna happen. I'd still just like, that

4905
04:44:02,835 --> 04:44:06,675
Speaker 21:  doesn't, that's not Olivia, that's not Taylor, that's not Gaga. I'm sorry.

4906
04:44:06,985 --> 04:44:08,035
Speaker 21:  It's just different. All

4907
04:44:08,035 --> 04:44:09,635
Speaker 22:  Right, we gotta end it. They're not Jason Derulo.

4908
04:44:09,635 --> 04:44:10,875
Speaker 21:  They're not Jason Deo,

4909
04:44:18,145 --> 04:44:21,715
Speaker 5:  Welcome back. Do you remember when you first heard about

4910
04:44:21,915 --> 04:44:25,755
Speaker 5:  podcasts? If you've been listening to this show, The Vergecast since

4911
04:44:25,755 --> 04:44:29,675
Speaker 5:  2011, Maybe it was that, or If you were a listener

4912
04:44:29,675 --> 04:44:33,555
Speaker 5:  of the End Gadget podcast before even that, maybe that's

4913
04:44:33,555 --> 04:44:37,235
Speaker 5:  where you got into it. Or really to be way less self-absorbed

4914
04:44:37,335 --> 04:44:40,995
Speaker 5:  and much more realistic about it. Maybe it was Serial in

4915
04:44:40,995 --> 04:44:44,715
Speaker 5:  2014 that turned you and frankly millions of other people

4916
04:44:45,265 --> 04:44:49,115
Speaker 5:  onto the idea of Radio on Demand. That's when podcasts

4917
04:44:50,105 --> 04:44:54,045
Speaker 5:  became a thing. But I bet that for most people, the farthest

4918
04:44:54,565 --> 04:44:57,765
Speaker 5:  possible distance back you could go would be this moment in

4919
04:44:57,765 --> 04:45:01,645
Speaker 5:  2005 when Steve Jobs got on stage at WWDC

4920
04:45:01,905 --> 04:45:04,965
Speaker 5:  and before he announced that Apple was switching to using Intel chips and

4921
04:45:04,965 --> 04:45:08,725
Speaker 5:  before he said that Leopard would be the next version of Mac Os, he explained

4922
04:45:08,725 --> 04:45:12,285
Speaker 5:  to a lot of people why they were about to start seeing podcasts in

4923
04:45:12,305 --> 04:45:12,725
Speaker 5:  iTunes.

4924
04:45:13,545 --> 04:45:17,045
Speaker 28:  As you know, the podcasting phenomenon is exploding right now.

4925
04:45:17,585 --> 04:45:21,405
Speaker 28:  And podcasting, of course is a concatenation of iPod and broadcasting.

4926
04:45:21,585 --> 04:45:24,245
Speaker 28:  And what is podcasting? You know, it's been described a lot of different

4927
04:45:24,245 --> 04:45:28,045
Speaker 28:  ways. One way has been TiVo for radio.

4928
04:45:28,225 --> 04:45:32,125
Speaker 28:  You can download radio shows and listen to 'em on your computer or put 'em

4929
04:45:32,125 --> 04:45:35,045
Speaker 28:  on your iPod anytime you want. So it's just like television programs on

4930
04:45:35,165 --> 04:45:38,685
Speaker 28:  TiVo. And that's true. Another way it's been described is

4931
04:45:38,685 --> 04:45:42,085
Speaker 28:  Wayne's World for radio, which means that anyone

4932
04:45:42,765 --> 04:45:46,685
Speaker 28:  without much capital investment can make a podcast, put it on a

4933
04:45:46,685 --> 04:45:50,645
Speaker 28:  server and get a worldwide audience for their radio show. And that's true

4934
04:45:50,665 --> 04:45:54,405
Speaker 28:  too. We see it as the hottest thing going in

4935
04:45:54,405 --> 04:45:54,685
Speaker 28:  radio.

4936
04:45:55,945 --> 04:45:59,585
Speaker 5:  A fun fact from that one, by the way, jobs talked about how there were 8,000

4937
04:45:59,625 --> 04:46:03,145
Speaker 5:  podcasts available at that time in 2005. And that was a huge

4938
04:46:03,425 --> 04:46:06,665
Speaker 5:  number. He was really excited about it. Now that number is somewhere between

4939
04:46:06,665 --> 04:46:10,345
Speaker 5:  three and 5 million podcasts. Lots changed

4940
04:46:10,685 --> 04:46:14,425
Speaker 5:  anyway. A lot of people credit jobs with mainstreaming, both

4941
04:46:14,605 --> 04:46:18,505
Speaker 5:  the word and the concept of podcasts, which is probably at least a little

4942
04:46:18,655 --> 04:46:22,385
Speaker 5:  true podcast, was the Oxford Dictionaries word of the year

4943
04:46:22,525 --> 04:46:26,105
Speaker 5:  in 2005. It beat out, in case you're wondering, bird flu,

4944
04:46:26,625 --> 04:46:30,105
Speaker 5:  reggaeton, life hack, whole bunch of other stuff. But jobs

4945
04:46:30,205 --> 04:46:34,025
Speaker 5:  didn't create the concept or the word. The concept,

4946
04:46:34,505 --> 04:46:38,145
Speaker 5:  I think is the one of those two that is trickiest to figure out. Technically,

4947
04:46:38,245 --> 04:46:42,225
Speaker 5:  you could argue that the idea of a podcast is just like radio and we've had

4948
04:46:42,225 --> 04:46:46,105
Speaker 5:  that around forever. But I think you can make a pretty good case that the

4949
04:46:46,105 --> 04:46:49,585
Speaker 5:  thing we now know as a podcast became a thing in about

4950
04:46:49,685 --> 04:46:53,105
Speaker 5:  2003 and it involved a guy named Chris Leiden.

4951
04:46:53,685 --> 04:46:57,545
Speaker 29:  It was a very exciting coincidence for me. For one thing, I, I had

4952
04:46:57,545 --> 04:47:01,345
Speaker 29:  been Ignominiously bumped out of a wonderful job in public radio

4953
04:47:01,885 --> 04:47:05,665
Speaker 29:  and looking for something new. Charlie Nessen at Berkman Center said,

4954
04:47:05,975 --> 04:47:09,825
Speaker 29:  come and think with us. Dave Weiner arrived a few

4955
04:47:09,825 --> 04:47:13,665
Speaker 29:  weeks later and he said, well, Charlie told me

4956
04:47:13,675 --> 04:47:15,545
Speaker 29:  David Weiner was coming. Charles

4957
04:47:15,865 --> 04:47:19,145
Speaker 5:  Nessen, by the way, it was the creator of the Berkman Client Center for Internet

4958
04:47:19,145 --> 04:47:23,065
Speaker 5:  and Society, which was kind of an early internet think tank at Harvard that

4959
04:47:23,385 --> 04:47:27,145
Speaker 5:  actually still does a lot of really interesting digital work. Dave Weiner

4960
04:47:27,145 --> 04:47:30,585
Speaker 5:  is one of the Internet's earliest and longest tenured bloggers. His blog

4961
04:47:30,585 --> 04:47:34,465
Speaker 5:  just turned 30 last week. He's also a key creator of RSS, which

4962
04:47:34,465 --> 04:47:38,185
Speaker 5:  is the technology that spreads feeds of content around the internet. And

4963
04:47:38,215 --> 04:47:41,905
Speaker 5:  he's just a guy who cares a lot about web publishing standards. At the time,

4964
04:47:42,165 --> 04:47:46,065
Speaker 5:  If you wanted to start a blog calling Dave Weiner was like calling Gordon

4965
04:47:46,205 --> 04:47:50,085
Speaker 5:  Ramsey for tips on how to open a restaurant. And Chris Leiden hit him

4966
04:47:50,085 --> 04:47:50,245
Speaker 5:  up.

4967
04:47:50,765 --> 04:47:54,605
Speaker 29:  I wrote to Dave Weer saying six months ago, I couldn't spell blog

4968
04:47:54,665 --> 04:47:58,605
Speaker 29:  now I want a B one. And we went through the blog cycle very, very

4969
04:47:58,605 --> 04:48:01,845
Speaker 29:  quickly. But then he said, you know, radio, I know

4970
04:48:02,155 --> 04:48:06,125
Speaker 29:  programming what the world needs is an MP three file that can

4971
04:48:06,905 --> 04:48:10,765
Speaker 29:  go worldwide instantly. I said, sounds good to me. And we got

4972
04:48:10,765 --> 04:48:14,245
Speaker 29:  to work. It only took, oh, a couple of months let's say.

4973
04:48:15,025 --> 04:48:18,165
Speaker 29:  And he said, I think we got it. I said, now what day? He said, well, that's

4974
04:48:18,165 --> 04:48:20,485
Speaker 29:  obvious. You're gonna do a conversation with me and we're gonna put it out.

4975
04:48:20,485 --> 04:48:20,965
Speaker 29:  And we did

4976
04:48:21,855 --> 04:48:25,555
Speaker 5:  Leiden and Weiner ended up publishing that conversation in July of

4977
04:48:25,555 --> 04:48:29,355
Speaker 5:  2003. And I just wanna play you the first 30 seconds or so of it,

4978
04:48:29,355 --> 04:48:31,755
Speaker 5:  which I found by the way, thanks to James Cridland

4979
04:48:31,755 --> 04:48:35,715
Speaker 5:  over@podnews.net. He did a great whole big

4980
04:48:35,715 --> 04:48:38,355
Speaker 5:  thing on the history of the Word podcast and we're actually gonna talk to

4981
04:48:38,355 --> 04:48:41,915
Speaker 5:  him about the future of podcasts later in the show. Anyway, here, it's

4982
04:48:42,105 --> 04:48:45,915
Speaker 29:  Dave Wener. I feel like a new immigrant in this blogger world where you're

4983
04:48:45,995 --> 04:48:49,795
Speaker 29:  a kind of founding father. Walk me around it, and

4984
04:48:49,815 --> 04:48:53,475
Speaker 29:  I'm not talking about the technology. I wanna know what kind of democratic

4985
04:48:54,085 --> 04:48:57,155
Speaker 29:  experiment this blog idea really amounts to.

4986
04:48:57,905 --> 04:49:01,555
Speaker 30:  Well, gosh, it changes all the time. I mean, when we first

4987
04:49:01,985 --> 04:49:05,195
Speaker 30:  started doing this, it was just a bunch of people sort of

4988
04:49:06,425 --> 04:49:10,075
Speaker 30:  writing Hello world and being amazed that

4989
04:49:10,375 --> 04:49:14,235
Speaker 30:  it was possible to do that and and then the next

4990
04:49:14,235 --> 04:49:17,715
Speaker 30:  step was recognition of other people and say, wow, there's somebody else

4991
04:49:18,285 --> 04:49:21,955
Speaker 30:  doing this and learning how to

4992
04:49:22,555 --> 04:49:23,315
Speaker 30:  communicate. And

4993
04:49:25,305 --> 04:49:28,595
Speaker 30:  gosh, I don't know how to answer that question. I mean, it is what you make

4994
04:49:28,595 --> 04:49:32,195
Speaker 30:  of it. Everybody brings something different to it and different set of expectations

4995
04:49:32,295 --> 04:49:35,475
Speaker 30:  and everybody molds it to be whatever it means to them.

4996
04:49:36,355 --> 04:49:40,165
Speaker 5:  They don't call what they're doing there a podcast, but I mean that's a podcast

4997
04:49:40,375 --> 04:49:44,205
Speaker 5:  right there. Like it's two dudes talking tech. It's all very meta.

4998
04:49:44,505 --> 04:49:48,445
Speaker 5:  The sound quality is good, but kind of messy. That's all

4999
04:49:48,445 --> 04:49:52,285
Speaker 5:  the hallmarks of podcasts all in one place. And I think the thing

5000
04:49:52,285 --> 04:49:56,125
Speaker 5:  that whiner says at the very end, it is what you make of it turned out to

5001
04:49:56,125 --> 04:49:59,325
Speaker 5:  be more prescient than maybe either of them realized at the time,

5002
04:49:59,985 --> 04:50:03,645
Speaker 5:  but still they weren't calling it a podcast. Nobody was, they were calling

5003
04:50:03,645 --> 04:50:07,085
Speaker 5:  these things audio blogs, if they were calling them anything. There were

5004
04:50:07,125 --> 04:50:11,085
Speaker 5:  a handful of them out there, but none of them were podcasts until

5005
04:50:11,505 --> 04:50:15,085
Speaker 5:  Ben Hammersley showed up. Ben, I should say right up front is

5006
04:50:15,365 --> 04:50:19,245
Speaker 5:  not exactly psyched that he is part of this particular slice of podcast

5007
04:50:19,315 --> 04:50:19,805
Speaker 5:  history.

5008
04:50:20,235 --> 04:50:23,645
Speaker 31:  It's a fucking bane in my life because there's absolutely no

5009
04:50:24,655 --> 04:50:28,605
Speaker 31:  honor in the origin story, right? That,

5010
04:50:29,325 --> 04:50:33,185
Speaker 31:  you know, when I die, I want to be remembered for, I

5011
04:50:33,185 --> 04:50:36,705
Speaker 31:  don't know, a 20 year project or something, or saving

5012
04:50:36,815 --> 04:50:39,625
Speaker 31:  orphans from a burning building or, or something,

5013
04:50:40,215 --> 04:50:43,985
Speaker 31:  something like that, rather than a word that was invented in a sort of deadline

5014
04:50:44,165 --> 04:50:48,085
Speaker 31:  frenzy that I didn't even realize I was doing until a few

5015
04:50:48,085 --> 04:50:48,525
Speaker 31:  months later.

5016
04:50:49,465 --> 04:50:53,245
Speaker 5:  In 2004, Ben was working on some early RSS in publishing tech

5017
04:50:53,465 --> 04:50:57,045
Speaker 5:  and was also writing about the burgeoning tech industry for The Guardian.

5018
04:50:57,505 --> 04:51:01,245
Speaker 5:  And in February of 2004, he published a piece called Audible Revolution,

5019
04:51:01,745 --> 04:51:05,205
Speaker 5:  all about the cool stuff people were doing online with audio

5020
04:51:05,785 --> 04:51:08,965
Speaker 5:  at the time, there were people building software that could automatically

5021
04:51:09,025 --> 04:51:12,645
Speaker 5:  record radio streams over the internet and make them available for listening

5022
04:51:12,645 --> 04:51:16,445
Speaker 5:  later. The iPod obviously was everywhere, and people were also

5023
04:51:16,605 --> 04:51:19,325
Speaker 5:  building software to take all those streams that you had downloaded and put

5024
04:51:19,325 --> 04:51:23,205
Speaker 5:  them onto your iPod one step at a time. All of this stuff was

5025
04:51:23,365 --> 04:51:27,285
Speaker 5:  starting to come together. Ben actually interviewed Chris Leiden for the

5026
04:51:27,285 --> 04:51:30,925
Speaker 5:  piece that he wrote, and Leiden talked about how audio over the web was gonna

5027
04:51:30,945 --> 04:51:34,765
Speaker 5:  change people's relationships with their audience. It was gonna democratize

5028
04:51:34,765 --> 04:51:38,685
Speaker 5:  media. They had all these big high-minded ideas about what audio

5029
04:51:38,695 --> 04:51:42,605
Speaker 5:  might do, but it's right there in the second paragraph of

5030
04:51:42,605 --> 04:51:46,405
Speaker 5:  the story that Ben Hammersley does. The thing, actually, lemme just read

5031
04:51:46,405 --> 04:51:50,165
Speaker 5:  you the first two paragraphs with the benefit of hindsight. It all seems

5032
04:51:50,165 --> 04:51:54,005
Speaker 5:  quite obvious. MP three players like Apple's iPod in many pockets,

5033
04:51:54,055 --> 04:51:57,725
Speaker 5:  audio production software are cheap or free, and web logging an established

5034
04:51:57,725 --> 04:52:01,285
Speaker 5:  part of the internet, all the ingredients are there for a new boom in

5035
04:52:01,285 --> 04:52:04,805
Speaker 5:  amateur radio, but what to call it audio blogging,

5036
04:52:05,135 --> 04:52:08,625
Speaker 5:  podcasting, gorilla Media. There it is

5037
04:52:09,055 --> 04:52:12,665
Speaker 5:  that almost everyone agrees is the first published use of the word

5038
04:52:12,665 --> 04:52:16,585
Speaker 5:  podcasting. It's a big moment. Of course, Ben had absolutely no

5039
04:52:16,585 --> 04:52:18,785
Speaker 5:  idea what he was doing when he wrote that word.

5040
04:52:19,285 --> 04:52:23,065
Speaker 31:  The Guardian at the time was a print first paper, as in you

5041
04:52:23,065 --> 04:52:26,785
Speaker 31:  wrote for the paper and you had a print deadline when the physical printing

5042
04:52:26,815 --> 04:52:30,065
Speaker 31:  presses would run at six o'clock. And If you

5043
04:52:30,925 --> 04:52:34,705
Speaker 31:  missed that deadline, the the words weren't going to go onto the

5044
04:52:34,705 --> 04:52:38,465
Speaker 31:  page. And that meant that

5045
04:52:38,465 --> 04:52:41,785
Speaker 31:  every day, this sort of working rhythm was that there was this big rush

5046
04:52:41,845 --> 04:52:45,675
Speaker 31:  to get everything done by quarter to six or

5047
04:52:45,795 --> 04:52:49,635
Speaker 31:  whatever. And I'd written this article and about five

5048
04:52:49,635 --> 04:52:53,075
Speaker 31:  30 or so, you know, just before the print deadline, I go to

5049
04:52:53,535 --> 04:52:57,515
Speaker 31:  an email from my editor saying, we've put it on the page

5050
04:52:57,515 --> 04:53:01,475
Speaker 31:  and it's very nice, but it, it's kind of a line short and it doesn't look

5051
04:53:01,475 --> 04:53:05,235
Speaker 31:  very good on the page. You know, the, the text hasn't gone green

5052
04:53:05,295 --> 04:53:08,675
Speaker 31:  in the typesetting program. Can you write me another sentence

5053
04:53:09,385 --> 04:53:12,355
Speaker 31:  just to pad it out? Right? Just to make it fit beautifully on the printed

5054
04:53:12,385 --> 04:53:15,875
Speaker 31:  page. And So I wrote an extra sentence and emailed it over, and the sentence

5055
04:53:15,895 --> 04:53:19,875
Speaker 31:  is this sort of like mildly meaningless sentence of, but what do we call

5056
04:53:19,875 --> 04:53:22,995
Speaker 31:  this new phenomenon? And then I sort of invented three words and put them

5057
04:53:22,995 --> 04:53:25,555
Speaker 31:  in there and then sent it off. And then I went to the pub.

5058
04:53:27,025 --> 04:53:30,515
Speaker 5:  Look on the one hand, thank God we call it podcasting and not

5059
04:53:30,625 --> 04:53:34,435
Speaker 5:  Gorilla Mediaing, you know what I mean? But Ben doesn't even

5060
04:53:34,835 --> 04:53:38,715
Speaker 5:  remember how he came up with podcast. Everyone now says it's a port

5061
04:53:38,765 --> 04:53:42,435
Speaker 5:  manto of iPod and broadcast, which is what Steve Jobs said in that clip earlier.

5062
04:53:43,105 --> 04:53:46,965
Speaker 5:  And Ben basically just said, yeah, that seems reasonable enough, but

5063
04:53:46,965 --> 04:53:50,325
Speaker 5:  he doesn't even remember coming up with it. He also, at the time,

5064
04:53:50,825 --> 04:53:54,565
Speaker 5:  had no idea, truly no idea what he had done.

5065
04:53:54,985 --> 04:53:58,765
Speaker 31:  And it was only a few months later that I got emails from, from the Oxford

5066
04:53:58,765 --> 04:54:02,485
Speaker 31:  English dictionary saying, where do you find this word? We

5067
04:54:02,485 --> 04:54:06,085
Speaker 31:  we're trying to find an earlier citation for it than, than your piece. And,

5068
04:54:06,105 --> 04:54:09,685
Speaker 31:  and we can't, where did you get it? And I, you know,

5069
04:54:10,545 --> 04:54:13,805
Speaker 31:  pulled it out the back of my head on a, on a deadline panic. I, I had no

5070
04:54:13,805 --> 04:54:17,685
Speaker 31:  idea. And I looked on all of the RSS related

5071
04:54:17,685 --> 04:54:21,485
Speaker 31:  development mailing lists and so on, which, which is what the place

5072
04:54:21,485 --> 04:54:24,645
Speaker 31:  where it would've been. And I couldn't find any trace of it either.

5073
04:54:25,265 --> 04:54:27,805
Speaker 31:  And So I said, well, clearly I just must have made it up. And then they

5074
04:54:27,805 --> 04:54:31,725
Speaker 31:  said, great, because it's word of the Year. And then, you know, and

5075
04:54:31,725 --> 04:54:34,565
Speaker 31:  then it became the thing that Apple took on and that's what they called

5076
04:54:34,565 --> 04:54:37,685
Speaker 31:  their app and that's what it became known as. And you know, the rest is

5077
04:54:37,685 --> 04:54:37,965
Speaker 31:  history.

5078
04:54:38,945 --> 04:54:42,885
Speaker 5:  Ben made very clear several times when we talked that he didn't invent

5079
04:54:42,905 --> 04:54:46,725
Speaker 5:  the idea of a podcast and nor does he deserve credit for what podcasts

5080
04:54:46,725 --> 04:54:50,545
Speaker 5:  eventually became. But all these years later, he does

5081
04:54:50,695 --> 04:54:54,505
Speaker 5:  seem to kind of like the word he came up with. It's got that nice plosive

5082
04:54:54,785 --> 04:54:58,065
Speaker 5:  p you can use it as a noun or a verb pretty easily.

5083
04:54:58,735 --> 04:55:00,825
Speaker 5:  It's a good useful word that way,

5084
04:55:01,785 --> 04:55:05,725
Speaker 31:  But also that within it, there are context clues that Normies could understand.

5085
04:55:06,285 --> 04:55:10,205
Speaker 31:  Hmm. So, you know, the iPod was the biggest thing in the world

5086
04:55:10,265 --> 04:55:14,185
Speaker 31:  at that time, and that's where the pod bit comes from. And

5087
04:55:14,465 --> 04:55:17,345
Speaker 31:  although it was super fiddly at the beginning to, to take these podcasts

5088
04:55:17,345 --> 04:55:21,225
Speaker 31:  and put them onto your iPod pretty rapidly, some software came out there

5089
04:55:21,225 --> 04:55:24,905
Speaker 31:  and made that simpler. And then soon after that, apple made it possible

5090
04:55:24,905 --> 04:55:28,775
Speaker 31:  within iTunes. And to

5091
04:55:28,775 --> 04:55:32,645
Speaker 31:  say it's kind of like TiVo for radio

5092
04:55:32,675 --> 04:55:36,665
Speaker 31:  that you listen to on your MP three player is a pretty good

5093
04:55:36,945 --> 04:55:40,225
Speaker 31:  sentence in 2002, 2003. Yeah. Right.

5094
04:55:41,405 --> 04:55:45,305
Speaker 31:  To sort of, not, not necessarily just huge techie circles or, or even like

5095
04:55:45,305 --> 04:55:49,165
Speaker 31:  super early adopters, but to sort of, you know, the, the whoever

5096
04:55:49,165 --> 04:55:52,405
Speaker 31:  comes after the early adopters, those people, you know, they, they could

5097
04:55:52,405 --> 04:55:55,845
Speaker 31:  understand it. And so it, I think it becomes one of those things where

5098
04:55:56,965 --> 04:56:00,755
Speaker 31:  a, it's a fun word to say, but also it kind of has meaning within

5099
04:56:00,815 --> 04:56:04,715
Speaker 31:  it that somebody who's used to new

5100
04:56:04,715 --> 04:56:08,515
Speaker 31:  technologies can kind of understand straight away. And,

5101
04:56:08,535 --> 04:56:12,435
Speaker 31:  and so, and it becomes a self evidently good idea,

5102
04:56:12,885 --> 04:56:16,515
Speaker 31:  right? And then when you have a few years later you have these

5103
04:56:17,145 --> 04:56:20,435
Speaker 31:  very successful professionally made podcasts, which take full advantage

5104
04:56:20,695 --> 04:56:24,435
Speaker 31:  or start to take full advantage of the, of the fact that they're at liberty

5105
04:56:24,575 --> 04:56:28,355
Speaker 31:  to use as much space or as little space as they need, as much time as little

5106
04:56:28,355 --> 04:56:31,355
Speaker 31:  time, different episode lengths or that sort of thing

5107
04:56:32,145 --> 04:56:36,075
Speaker 31:  that people started exploring that and, and being able to self commission

5108
04:56:36,075 --> 04:56:40,035
Speaker 31:  and make, make programs that were something you would never, ever

5109
04:56:40,035 --> 04:56:43,125
Speaker 31:  have heard before on regular ball cross radio then,

5110
04:56:43,835 --> 04:56:47,685
Speaker 31:  then suddenly becomes its own its own thing very rapidly and people

5111
04:56:47,685 --> 04:56:51,165
Speaker 31:  start to see the value of it hugely tied in with

5112
04:56:51,825 --> 04:56:55,805
Speaker 31:  the call it Skagit on the market at the time. So I think it, it, it

5113
04:56:55,805 --> 04:56:58,325
Speaker 31:  sort of catches that lightning of all of those different things happening.

5114
04:56:58,325 --> 04:56:59,005
Speaker 31:  At the same time,

5115
04:56:59,595 --> 04:57:03,405
Speaker 5:  Most people do seem to agree that Ben coined the term

5116
04:57:03,405 --> 04:57:07,365
Speaker 5:  podcast, or at least used it first. But there is one other person in the

5117
04:57:07,525 --> 04:57:11,365
Speaker 5:  equation who definitely deserves credit. That's Danny Gregoire, who's a

5118
04:57:11,525 --> 04:57:15,045
Speaker 5:  software engineer who used the word in an email to a list of folks working

5119
04:57:15,265 --> 04:57:19,085
Speaker 5:  on and with an app called ipo. IPO was one of those

5120
04:57:19,085 --> 04:57:22,565
Speaker 5:  things that could automatically take recorded audio and put it on your iPod.

5121
04:57:23,225 --> 04:57:27,165
Speaker 5:  The list at the time was brand new and IPO was an app started by

5122
04:57:27,165 --> 04:57:30,605
Speaker 5:  a guy named Adam Curry who had an audio blog of his own at the time called

5123
04:57:30,605 --> 04:57:34,565
Speaker 5:  Daily Source Code. Adam was a longtime radio guy, he'd also

5124
04:57:34,565 --> 04:57:38,445
Speaker 5:  been an MTV VJ for years and he'd also been an

5125
04:57:38,445 --> 04:57:42,165
Speaker 5:  early internet entrepreneur and for years at this point he had been chatting

5126
04:57:42,165 --> 04:57:45,845
Speaker 5:  with Dave Weiner and others about the whole concept of putting audio

5127
04:57:45,895 --> 04:57:49,765
Speaker 5:  files in RSS. But Adam was one of the very first people to

5128
04:57:49,765 --> 04:57:53,605
Speaker 5:  have kind of a whole vision of how this on demand internet

5129
04:57:53,615 --> 04:57:55,685
Speaker 5:  radio thing should actually work.

5130
04:57:56,345 --> 04:58:00,245
Speaker 32:  Now it was end of 2003 when a friend

5131
04:58:00,245 --> 04:58:03,045
Speaker 32:  of mine said, look at this cool thing I have. I said, what do you have?

5132
04:58:03,305 --> 04:58:07,125
Speaker 32:  And it was the iPod. And I looked at this iPod and

5133
04:58:07,465 --> 04:58:11,365
Speaker 32:  it was like literally like lightning bolts because it

5134
04:58:11,425 --> 04:58:15,085
Speaker 32:  looked, I don't have any, I, it looked exactly like

5135
04:58:15,395 --> 04:58:19,325
Speaker 32:  this transistor radio my grandmother had given me when I was seven years

5136
04:58:19,345 --> 04:58:23,245
Speaker 32:  old. This little, little Sony transistor radio nine volt battery.

5137
04:58:23,825 --> 04:58:27,725
Speaker 32:  I'm like, yeah, you can call this a digital Walkman or you know, whatever

5138
04:58:27,725 --> 04:58:31,365
Speaker 32:  you want, but this to me was a radio receiver. And right away I'm like,

5139
04:58:31,385 --> 04:58:34,885
Speaker 32:  oh, let's hook it up to this RSS thing.

5140
04:58:35,225 --> 04:58:39,165
Speaker 32:  So again, with my very poor scripting skills, I

5141
04:58:39,165 --> 04:58:43,085
Speaker 32:  tried to rig this together with Apple Script. And then Kevin Marks

5142
04:58:43,085 --> 04:58:45,685
Speaker 32:  who I think worked at, I dunno if he worked at Google, he worked in Silicon

5143
04:58:45,685 --> 04:58:48,605
Speaker 32:  Valley somewhere. He basically said, oh, here's the script that you need,

5144
04:58:49,305 --> 04:58:52,845
Speaker 32:  and boom, I was like, okay, it works. So I could create a blog post

5145
04:58:53,305 --> 04:58:57,285
Speaker 32:  and then this little script would be looking to, to find some, a new item

5146
04:58:57,345 --> 04:59:01,005
Speaker 32:  in my blog post with a file attached to it. It would download the file.

5147
04:59:01,425 --> 04:59:05,405
Speaker 32:  It would, because you still had to sync your iPod back in the day to

5148
04:59:05,405 --> 04:59:08,525
Speaker 32:  your computer. And so it would trigger an update and then in the morning

5149
04:59:08,575 --> 04:59:12,485
Speaker 32:  you'd walk in and there would be your iPod with, as the album

5150
04:59:12,535 --> 04:59:16,205
Speaker 32:  would be basically, we didn't have the name podcasting yet. It would be,

5151
04:59:16,305 --> 04:59:19,925
Speaker 32:  you know, kind of the blog name or the, you know, the, the show name.

5152
04:59:20,185 --> 04:59:23,525
Speaker 32:  And then it would have these episodes under it. And I immediately started

5153
04:59:23,585 --> 04:59:27,205
Speaker 32:  to just get the word out there because I needed software

5154
04:59:27,205 --> 04:59:29,285
Speaker 32:  developers who could create this for real,

5155
04:59:29,755 --> 04:59:33,605
Speaker 5:  That thing he's describing. That script was ipo. It would watch

5156
04:59:33,725 --> 04:59:37,245
Speaker 5:  RSS feeds for audio files, it would download them, sync them to your iPod

5157
04:59:37,245 --> 04:59:40,485
Speaker 5:  and you're done. That's just a podcasting app, right?

5158
04:59:40,635 --> 04:59:44,565
Speaker 5:  Adam Curry made a podcasting app, that's all it was. And

5159
04:59:44,565 --> 04:59:48,245
Speaker 5:  in fact, his show, daily Source Code was in part a podcast

5160
04:59:48,585 --> 04:59:51,845
Speaker 5:  for its own sake, you know, entertainment and content and whatever. But it

5161
04:59:51,845 --> 04:59:55,685
Speaker 5:  was also in part sort of an ongoing beta test of how all of

5162
04:59:55,715 --> 04:59:58,685
Speaker 5:  this podcasting technology stuff might.
