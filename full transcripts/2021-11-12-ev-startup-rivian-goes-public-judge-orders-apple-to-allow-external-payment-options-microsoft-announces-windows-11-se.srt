00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,030
Speaker 1:  Hello, welcome to Vergecast the flagship podcast, Zune

31
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,020
Speaker 1:  enthusiasts. There's one of you out there. We saw the photo,

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,160
Speaker 1:  explain the joke. There's 35 more. If I got five, we

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,640
Speaker 1:  have the numbers, right? Which we don't because podcast statistics are bad.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,690
Speaker 2:  But according to those statistics, 36 of you are listening to this show on

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,230
Speaker 2:  a Zune.

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,740
Speaker 1:  We're very proud of you. And one of you sent us a photo. The rest of you

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,830
Speaker 1:  sent us a photo. We're very into it. Anyway, I'm Neil. I'm your friend Dieter

38
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,180
Speaker 1:  bonus. Here I am.

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,320
Speaker 2:  Actually I am the host of a run of special Tuesday.

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,250
Speaker 2:  Vergecast set. I hope you're listening to, we just did over an hour on

41
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,210
Speaker 2:  USB-C and next week we've got a

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,280
Speaker 2:  really cool subject to talk about.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,800
Speaker 1:  Oh, Teeter absolute hype. I'm so hyped. Now I was going

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,710
Speaker 1:  to say that, you know, we've, we've often used the second episode of the

45
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,860
Speaker 1:  virtuous to pilot formats, right? Where they piloted an interview show that

46
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,820
Speaker 1:  became decoder. Ashley did a mini series about AI. Dieter

47
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,810
Speaker 1:  was doing holiday spectaculars. Yeah that's USB-C but now

48
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,750
Speaker 1:  instead of teasing another one, you're like a cool subject. I know it's a

49
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,000
Speaker 2:  Really cool subject.

50
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,290
Speaker 1:  Is it refrigerators?

51
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,380
Speaker 2:  Freezers are our listeners understand what I'm getting at? Even if you,

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,430
Speaker 1:  I believe you, Alex Kranz is here. I'm still trying to figure out what an

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,210
Speaker 1:  NFT is,

54
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,050
Speaker 1:  who had sent. And Sean okayness here.

55
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,430
Speaker 4:  I am telling Alex Cranz to go to our website to read our very good NFT

56
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,030
Speaker 4:  explainer.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,030
Speaker 1:  I'm the only one who hasn't read it. And the whole

58
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,270
Speaker 4:  World. That's definitely true. You and the Zune owners.

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,680
Speaker 1:  So desperately trying to, I will tell you this, the

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,610
Speaker 1:  incoming traffic to our NFT explainer, it is

61
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,120
Speaker 1:  now like maybe the, the sixth or fifth, most popular article in verge

62
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,810
Speaker 1:  history. Because so many people are confused about what NFTs

63
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,380
Speaker 1:  are. They just are landing on that page every day,

64
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,610
Speaker 1:  every day. It's like every day, it's one of our top stories and we keep updating

65
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,210
Speaker 1:  it because it keeps changing, but it's, it's very entertaining and it's probably

66
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,060
Speaker 1:  a signal that we need to do more coverage there. We just all have to stop

67
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,960
Speaker 1:  laughing every time. Like it's, it's hard. We're going to get

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,800
Speaker 1:  there. We're going to do it. I believe in it. We've actually got an NFT decoder

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,710
Speaker 1:  episode coming up that I think it's a cool subject.

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,900
Speaker 1:  It's not the same. The joke is it's a really

71
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,090
Speaker 1:  cool subject.

72
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,220
Speaker 1:  Oh my God.

73
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,430
Speaker 1:  We're off to a rollicking. Start a lot to talk about. There's some news from

74
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,240
Speaker 1:  apple and epic that we need to get to. There's a bunch of Microsoft stuff

75
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,050
Speaker 1:  going on, but Sean is here because there's a new card

76
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,620
Speaker 1:  company, like a big deal car company. It's about, it's having a moment

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,500
Speaker 1:  and it's a good time to just like, talk about what's going on in the cars.

78
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,460
Speaker 1:  The Evie revolution is like in full, early swing. I would

79
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,120
Speaker 1:  say you might notice car company, keep car company CEOs, keep coming on

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,810
Speaker 1:  decoder to convince me that they're going to be good at batteries. It's true.

81
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,140
Speaker 1:  But Riviera just had its IPO reveal. And if you haven't been keeping track

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,100
Speaker 1:  as a new electric car company, they make what's. The RNT is the

83
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,940
Speaker 1:  pickup truck. The R one S is the SUV. They are now worth more than

84
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,790
Speaker 1:  Ford and GM. After this IPO, they have not shipped one car.

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,460
Speaker 1:  Sean, what is going on with Vivian?

86
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,390
Speaker 4:  They've started shipping the first few pickup trucks

87
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,470
Speaker 4:  where those exactly went, you know, did they go to employees that

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,010
Speaker 4:  they have a couple out there, but yes, in appreciable quantities, they haven't

89
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,520
Speaker 4:  started shipping. Riviera is, you know, in many ways it's a new

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,240
Speaker 4:  company, but it also really isn't. It was founded in 2009, the

91
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,110
Speaker 4:  founders. And, you know, it's like this super brainy guy

92
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,130
Speaker 4:  who, you know, you think back to 2009, it was that first sort of big clean

93
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,670
Speaker 4:  tech boom. And he was looking at Tesla and wanted to do something

94
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,420
Speaker 4:  similar. And they actually originally set out to make an electric

95
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,200
Speaker 4:  sports car that was kind of similar in some ways to the Tesla Roadster.

96
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,520
Speaker 4:  And, you know, as Tesla proved, that was an extremely hard thing to

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,210
Speaker 4:  do, even in Tesla's case where it was basically borrowing the

98
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,780
Speaker 4:  Lotus Elise to build off of. And so this founder, RJ

99
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,300
Speaker 4:  syringe eventually decided a couple of years down the road to pivot

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,250
Speaker 4:  to something a little more focused, you know, a brand

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,620
Speaker 4:  and electric vehicle brand that was more about adventuring

102
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,550
Speaker 4:  outdoors-y people, affluent people who are interested in those

103
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,490
Speaker 4:  things. And at the very least like to think that they're outdoorsy and,

104
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,810
Speaker 4:  and had, has likened it in the past to

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,490
Speaker 4:  wanting to become like the Patagonia of Evie makers and

106
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,970
Speaker 4:  even to the point that they even have a Patagonia executive on their board.

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,500
Speaker 1:  I just say like, that's a good, it's like, it's, that's all good. It's also

108
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,490
Speaker 1:  just from a more abstract business sense trucks and

109
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,270
Speaker 1:  SUV's are the biggest market for sure. Right? It's like remarkable that Tesla

110
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,290
Speaker 1:  is a success selling city

111
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,160
Speaker 4:  Biggest market, and also make the most money for automakers

112
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,610
Speaker 4:  in the case of a startup. You know, that's not necessarily going to be true

113
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,600
Speaker 4:  right away, but what that gives you is, you know, the biggest cost is the

114
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,020
Speaker 4:  battery. The higher you go, the more money you charge right out the gate,

115
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,960
Speaker 4:  the more you can absorb that cost of the battery and not just take a total

116
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,530
Speaker 4:  bath on the cost of actually building these vehicles. So, so that's what

117
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,400
Speaker 4:  really helps them there by going down that, that route of SEP in and pickup

118
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,250
Speaker 4:  truck. And, you know, they also, by doing that, they put themselves in this

119
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,940
Speaker 4:  position to essentially get to this point now where they have

120
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,840
Speaker 4:  become, you know, for all intents and purposes, the first company to ship

121
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,380
Speaker 4:  an electric pickup truck. There are a lot of other ones in the works

122
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,460
Speaker 4:  and it will, it will not be as much of a rarity in a couple of years,

123
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,720
Speaker 4:  but they are, you know, they beat Ford, which has the F150 lightning

124
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,530
Speaker 4:  to market. They beat Lordstown motors, which is a, you know, a much

125
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,340
Speaker 4:  smaller kind of struggling startup. That's focused on building

126
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,170
Speaker 4:  pickup trucks for fleets. They beat them to the market. So, so they,

127
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,110
Speaker 4:  they are going to be in this position where they can sort

128
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,070
Speaker 4:  of make themselves become known as the electric pickup truck in the

129
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,820
Speaker 4:  way that, you know, Tesla became the electric car company for a lot of

130
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,400
Speaker 4:  people. And that's, that's sort of why they want to do so. They're able to

131
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,300
Speaker 4:  get to the IPO. You know, there's is interesting, like their, their inflection

132
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,200
Speaker 4:  point was, they debuted at the 2018 LA auto show and everybody saw

133
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Speaker 4:  these vehicles and were really wowed by them. They're a little polarizing,

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,650
Speaker 4:  but for the most part, I think people were really interested in how

135
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,280
Speaker 4:  specifically they tailored it to like outdoorsy lifestyle, as you know,

136
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,570
Speaker 4:  all wheel drive, all these sorts of cool little compartments and things

137
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,980
Speaker 4:  where you can stow gear and everything. And, and so that got them a lot of

138
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,880
Speaker 4:  buzz. And then a couple of months later, Amazon led a $700 million investment

139
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,390
Speaker 4:  round into them. And then a couple of months later,

140
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,200
Speaker 4:  Ford followed with a $500 million investment round. And they had, you know,

141
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,990
Speaker 4:  they were courting GM. There was a good wall street journal piece the other

142
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,830
Speaker 4:  day about how close GM actually got to making that investment. And it

143
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,790
Speaker 4:  was like, everybody should read it. It's, it's a really good scene about

144
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,570
Speaker 4:  like RJ syringe flying back with this Ford executive on his jet and like

145
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,350
Speaker 4:  basically Ford stealing Ravion out from underneath GM, which is a

146
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,800
Speaker 4:  really funny, and, and from there they've just taken off. There they're

147
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,760
Speaker 4:  9,000 people around the world. Now they have offices all around the U S

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,960
Speaker 4:  they've been building service and delivery centers. And then on top of those

149
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,650
Speaker 4:  two vehicles, they're also going to be building up to a hundred thousand

150
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,320
Speaker 4:  electric delivery vans that they designed with Amazon. So the interesting

151
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,930
Speaker 4:  thing about them is not just the products that they built that look really

152
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,860
Speaker 4:  cool and we can talk about, but they will be a lot

153
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,820
Speaker 4:  of, people's probably a first touch point for electric vehicles because

154
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,810
Speaker 4:  we've all seen these Amazon bans circulating our neighborhoods every

155
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,760
Speaker 4:  day. And, and there's a good chance that that might be the first time

156
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,230
Speaker 4:  you actually notice an electric vehicle near you.

157
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,040
Speaker 2:  The thing that really gets me about Vivian is, I mean, Sean, you've been

158
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,580
Speaker 2:  reporting on like the electric car companies that, I mean, you're reporting

159
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,280
Speaker 2:  in Tesla, but that's companies that aren't Tesla trying to like, make it,

160
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,000
Speaker 2:  you mentioned Lordstown, I'm going to bring up fair day for the

161
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,270
Speaker 2:  past five years. It was like, oh, it's a electric car company. Yeah, sure.

162
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,990
Speaker 2:  We'll we'll believe it when you actually make something and ship it. And

163
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,830
Speaker 2:  I feel like Ravion sort of went from that category to

164
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,190
Speaker 2:  holy crap, they're doing it. They're actually chipping something and they're

165
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,060
Speaker 2:  making something really compelling almost overnight. Like how do they get

166
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,050
Speaker 2:  over that ledge of we are actually real. We actually have capital. We're

167
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,010
Speaker 2:  actually, you know, staffing factories and making trucks. Okay.

168
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,830
Speaker 4:  I think one thing that actually hasn't gotten a lot of attention in, in the

169
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,700
Speaker 4:  run up to this IPO that I think played such an outsized role

170
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,540
Speaker 4:  in their success so far is that, you know, it's easy to sort of scoff at

171
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,500
Speaker 4:  the like Patagonia of electric vehicles kind of vibe, but what they

172
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,310
Speaker 4:  did that was so smart that a lot of pretty much arguably all other

173
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,970
Speaker 4:  electric vehicle startups done is they picked a customer. They said,

174
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,870
Speaker 4:  you know, they think throughout the sports car idea, they said, let's get

175
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,680
Speaker 4:  as like kind of narrow as possible an idea. And they really like

176
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,490
Speaker 4:  chiseled out a brand that like is more

177
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,300
Speaker 4:  cohesive than anything else. It's very future. Biten all these other

178
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,290
Speaker 4:  companies that have struggled and, or gone out of business are falling

179
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,100
Speaker 4:  by the wayside. They all wanted to be the next Tesla in the sense that they

180
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,460
Speaker 4:  wanted to be a mass market electric vehicle. And that's a really hard thing

181
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,270
Speaker 4:  to do if you're trying to be a product for everybody.

182
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,140
Speaker 4:  And what ribbon did that was so smart was realized halfway

183
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,830
Speaker 4:  through that they wanted to make something specific. And if it didn't work

184
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,320
Speaker 4:  out, you know, the chances are it's not going to work out. So why not take

185
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,680
Speaker 4:  the risk on making something that could appeal to a more

186
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,460
Speaker 4:  niche group of buyers, even though, again, we're talking trucks and

187
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,450
Speaker 4:  SUV's, but they really built a cohesive brand around it. And I think

188
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,320
Speaker 4:  that really helped. And then honestly, the, in the run-up to the IPO

189
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,920
Speaker 4:  recently, one of the things that we learned when they filed their S one with

190
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,070
Speaker 4:  the securities and exchange commission, is that, you know, they got a lot

191
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,820
Speaker 4:  of help. Like not only sort of, you know, obviously they're getting a lot

192
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,000
Speaker 4:  of help from Amazon on building the delivery van and, and figuring out how

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,720
Speaker 4:  that's gonna work, but Ford built the body and whites for

194
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,230
Speaker 4:  them, for all their prototypes. So basically everything that sits above like

195
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,800
Speaker 4:  the electric vehicle platform that powers the cars, Ford actually built all

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,550
Speaker 4:  of that. So I think they had a lot of work done before they came out of stealth

197
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,540
Speaker 4:  in 2018, which showed at the, at the LA auto show. You know, they

198
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,480
Speaker 4:  didn't show like cardboard cutouts that, that fell over.

199
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,800
Speaker 4:  But, you know, at, at that point they would have probably taken a little

200
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,760
Speaker 4:  bit longer to get to here. If it hadn't been for the sort of,

201
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,750
Speaker 4:  you know, big companies, one automotive, one tech that came in

202
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,450
Speaker 4:  and, and really sort of saw the potential there and partnered with them and

203
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,790
Speaker 4:  started sort of pushing them forward.

204
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,870
Speaker 1:  You and I obviously talk a lot about the car industry. Big companies are

205
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,990
Speaker 1:  trying to do this, right? Like Ram is trying to ship an electric

206
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,360
Speaker 1:  1500 pickup truck. Chevy is announced

207
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,730
Speaker 1:  electric Silverado Ford is presumably with the next few months

208
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,780
Speaker 1:  shipping the lightning they're like saying it, it just took them forever

209
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,110
Speaker 1:  to get on the board. Why do you think it took a startup with obviously with

210
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,000
Speaker 1:  help, but why do you think it's took a startup to get there for

211
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,140
Speaker 4:  There's a, there's definitely at the very least one big technical reason,

212
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,950
Speaker 4:  which is when you're talking about making larger electric vehicles, you

213
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,010
Speaker 4:  start to run into this problem where to get the kind of range that people

214
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,040
Speaker 4:  want in order to consider buying them. You need a certain amount of batteries,

215
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,700
Speaker 4:  the more batteries that you need to get that range to power, what are bigger

216
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,630
Speaker 4:  heavier vehicles, you are making them bigger and

217
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,420
Speaker 4:  heavier, which means you start to get into this sort of like chicken and

218
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,410
Speaker 4:  egg problem. And they actually have some, it's a little wonky,

219
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,100
Speaker 4:  but if you look at how they build their battery pack, that

220
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,970
Speaker 4:  whole part of the equation, it, they made like a really

221
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,120
Speaker 4:  big advancement there in trying to figure out that

222
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,440
Speaker 4:  problem, that, which I think has, I think, you know, isn't

223
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,740
Speaker 4:  going to, and that's not the reason that like

224
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,940
Speaker 4:  GMCs pickup trucks aren't going electric just yet. But

225
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,990
Speaker 4:  it was a reason that people were hesitant to think about going further than

226
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,310
Speaker 4:  a sedan for a while. So I think that's a part of it. And then,

227
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,880
Speaker 4:  you know, it is, you know, we hear this explanation a lot, but I think there's

228
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,330
Speaker 4:  some validity to it, which is like, there's just this idea

229
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,290
Speaker 4:  of a large corporation. Like

230
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,250
Speaker 4:  the automakers are, it's just harder for them to do

231
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,880
Speaker 4:  something new and, and cut ties to certain

232
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,970
Speaker 4:  baggage that they have, like the Mo the Mustang Maki is a really good example.

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,690
Speaker 4:  The only reason the Mustang Maki exists and that Ford is like

234
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,680
Speaker 4:  now, actually sort of in the game is that the CEO at

235
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Speaker 4:  the time went to whoever, you know, the team that was working on what was

236
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,610
Speaker 4:  essentially the next focus, electric, like a small electric vehicle

237
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,370
Speaker 4:  that they were going to make and was like, we're going to get killed with

238
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,160
Speaker 4:  this. No, one's going to buy this thing, make something better. And that

239
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,220
Speaker 4:  turned into the Mustang Maki, and not only turned into something more interesting,

240
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,030
Speaker 4:  but on a much quicker timescale, they turned that around in like two

241
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,960
Speaker 4:  years, two and a half years for that debut in November, 2019.

242
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,770
Speaker 4:  So I think those are two of the big reasons why Rivi here now

243
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,750
Speaker 4:  also money money. A lot of us

244
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,010
Speaker 1:  Have a lot of money

245
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,430
Speaker 4:  As Steve raised $10 billion today. And that's not counting the

246
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,520
Speaker 4:  IPO. They've raised more than $10 billion. When you said

247
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,820
Speaker 2:  Picked a customer. And the customer was like people that are Patagonia vests

248
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,580
Speaker 2:  or whatever, isn't the customer that they picked Jeff Bezos.

249
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,650
Speaker 4:  Well, he is definitely the customer because not only is Amazon buying vans,

250
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,960
Speaker 4:  we've seen during blue origins launches

251
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,550
Speaker 4:  and blue origin, branded Ruby and pickup trucks, and SUV's pull up to the

252
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,390
Speaker 4:  launch sites and stuff, and they won't say they won't tell us, we keep

253
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,390
Speaker 4:  bugging them. They won't tell us if they bought those vehicles or not. But

254
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,730
Speaker 1:  I want to talk about the money aspect real quick, but then I actually want

255
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,880
Speaker 1:  to talk about the cars, but the money aspect is interesting that you have

256
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,300
Speaker 1:  covered a lot of EBV companies that have raised a bunch of money

257
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,830
Speaker 1:  in a bunch of strange ways. And they like fair to a future is like

258
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,980
Speaker 1:  the prime example, especially for Sean,

259
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,940
Speaker 5:  Wait, how did Faraday future do it? I vaguely remember this.

260
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,680
Speaker 4:  I'll do this as quickly as possible. I promised ferritin future was founded

261
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,060
Speaker 4:  by the guy who ran the Netflix of China and

262
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,840
Speaker 4:  also Le echo, which was like a mobile phone company and TV company

263
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,770
Speaker 4:  and TV company. And at one point Android bike company, he

264
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,670
Speaker 4:  had, you know, he had those successes in China, but the problem

265
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,180
Speaker 4:  that he had over there was that he would, he would build something up. He

266
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,390
Speaker 4:  would borrow a lot of money against it. And then when that thing started

267
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,170
Speaker 4:  to fall apart, whatever he built up next, he would borrow money

268
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,070
Speaker 4:  against that to pay off basically Ponzi scheme style, moving

269
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,280
Speaker 4:  money around to the point that he got chased out of China. He found it fair

270
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,910
Speaker 4:  to a future with a bunch of that money when things were starting to get

271
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,840
Speaker 4:  really heated for the first time in China. So he put like

272
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,800
Speaker 4:  close to $2 billion of that money into Faraday future. That was how they

273
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,580
Speaker 4:  originally got founded. When they first ran into their biggest cash

274
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,270
Speaker 4:  crunch. A couple of years ago, they actually got bailed out by ever

275
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,080
Speaker 4:  grand, which is the massive Chinese real estate conglomerate that is

276
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,070
Speaker 4:  currently facing a $300 billion debt load of its own and is maybe

277
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,970
Speaker 4:  going to collapse unless the Chinese government saves it. And so they survive

278
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,510
Speaker 4:  for a while off of that, they got in a fight with ever grand a that they

279
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,960
Speaker 4:  settled at the end of 2018. Evergreen kind of walked away with a piece of

280
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,840
Speaker 4:  the company. Fair enough. Theater just sort of stayed in stasis mode

281
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,800
Speaker 4:  until the end of last year or beginning of this year.

282
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,000
Speaker 4:  They announced that they were going to do a spec merger. Oh no, of

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,930
Speaker 4:  course. And this year in July, they completed the spec merger and they

284
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,900
Speaker 4:  are now a public publicly traded company with

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,060
Speaker 1:  Sells no cars that sells another car.

286
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,180
Speaker 4:  It's

287
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,150
Speaker 5:  Like $8, $5.

288
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,390
Speaker 4:  I don't know. It's not, it's not as high as Vivian's. I can tell you that

289
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,570
Speaker 4:  much.

290
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,850
Speaker 1:  Well, so here's my, like, I just back out of all this, cause we could probably

291
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,580
Speaker 1:  do the whole hour and ferret eight shenanigans. No one wants it. Trust

292
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:19,940
Speaker 4:  Me. I know.

293
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,650
Speaker 1:  Trust me if you want it. It's all on the website. Sean has broken more

294
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,950
Speaker 1:  news about fair to history than anybody, but right. They raised all the money.

295
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,730
Speaker 1:  They had the resources, they had the big companies behind them. They never

296
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,360
Speaker 1:  shipped a car. And it's a disaster, right? Fair day. Yes.

297
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,950
Speaker 1:  Fair day. Yes. Fair day had the money. They had the tech companies, they

298
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,290
Speaker 1:  had everything. They were just bad. They had all the same puzzle pieces.

299
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,270
Speaker 1:  They just never made a car. Like what in the reveal

300
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,680
Speaker 1:  story made them actually get to this point? Is it they're just better

301
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,490
Speaker 1:  executives,

302
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,870
Speaker 5:  Schemes,

303
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,430
Speaker 1:  Less Ponzi schemes, right? Like, cause there's a lot of electric car

304
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,240
Speaker 1:  company is, are just a hope and a prayer, even though they have tons of

305
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,170
Speaker 1:  money. Yeah.

306
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,220
Speaker 4:  Well, I mean, one of the problems here is like tons of money is super relative

307
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,490
Speaker 4:  because when you're talking about the automotive space, like you need

308
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,820
Speaker 4:  this amount of money that ravine has raised to really actually get there.

309
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,270
Speaker 4:  Lucid motors is another good example. They just started shipping their first

310
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,200
Speaker 4:  luxury electric sedan and it took them getting well over

311
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,590
Speaker 4:  a billion dollars from Saudi Arabia to be able to get to the point where

312
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,280
Speaker 4:  they, that amount of money barely just got them to production. But then they

313
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,030
Speaker 4:  also just went public in a SPAC merger that raised four more billion dollars.

314
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,810
Speaker 4:  So the amount of money, even though parody had spent 2 billion,

315
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,720
Speaker 4:  that's still like kind of, not enough, especially at one point they wanted

316
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,390
Speaker 4:  to build their own factory. That's definitely not enough. And if you look

317
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,290
Speaker 4:  at reveal ones filing so far as they become a public company,

318
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,280
Speaker 4:  even they say, they're going to spend another $8 billion in the

319
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,640
Speaker 4:  next two years. So like that's definitely part of this. They were just able

320
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,060
Speaker 4:  to corral the right amount of capital from

321
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,230
Speaker 4:  sources that were, you know, less problematic, I guess you could

322
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,710
Speaker 4:  say. And so, and then, you know, I'm sure

323
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,310
Speaker 4:  there's some sort of leadership part of this as well. You know, they definitely

324
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,420
Speaker 4:  have poached from a lot of companies. They took

325
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,260
Speaker 4:  a bunch of people from McLaren and they took a bunch of people from, I mean,

326
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,380
Speaker 4:  they take everybody kinda hops around at this point with all these different

327
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,370
Speaker 4:  startups. But so I think they probably hired well and it seems like

328
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,000
Speaker 4:  RJ, RJ scourge seems like a very intelligent person, a very

329
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,780
Speaker 4:  focused person. He doesn't seem to have the sort of

330
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,940
Speaker 4:  parts of a personality that we've seen from people like Elon Musk

331
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,270
Speaker 4:  and even Fairday futures, founder that, you know, work

332
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,600
Speaker 4:  against that, that part that you need to be successful.

333
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,080
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Essentially, they've got a plant and what normal Illinois is where

334
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,850
Speaker 1:  they're building the cars, they're going to do another

335
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,690
Speaker 5:  One in Texas.

336
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,830
Speaker 4:  Maybe they built a yes, they are. They bought this factory in

337
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,730
Speaker 4:  normal, Illinois on the extreme cheap, that's a former Mitsubishi factory

338
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,000
Speaker 4:  that had been empty for a little while. And it was one that fared a future

339
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,570
Speaker 4:  actually passed over in search of building their own

340
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,620
Speaker 4:  in Nevada instead. And so there's a connection there to,

341
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,520
Speaker 1:  It's just funny. Like all I know a lot of people in Wisconsin, Illinois and

342
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,330
Speaker 1:  ravine is the hot job to get like all a

343
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,900
Speaker 1:  bunch of people I know who just like worked for Harley and like Miller

344
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,830
Speaker 1:  Coors and like various sales. Like they all want to go work

345
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,430
Speaker 1:  for Vivian. And that is like, you can't buy that. Yeah.

346
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,060
Speaker 1:  Right. To be the place where all the talent in an area wants to go. I think

347
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,080
Speaker 1:  it's, it's just interesting to see this company. It's been a slow road

348
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,370
Speaker 1:  and they're about to start shipping at scale. And like all the pieces have

349
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,610
Speaker 1:  aligned for them in a way that everything else is wreckage. Basically.

350
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,030
Speaker 5:  It also feels like there's a little bit of like self fulfilling

351
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,450
Speaker 5:  prophecy. And this one too, like, honestly, I didn't know what Vivian was

352
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,000
Speaker 5:  until they announced that they were maybe building a factory in my

353
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,150
Speaker 5:  hometown in Texas. And I was like, oh my God, I have to learn all about this.

354
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,930
Speaker 5:  Now I got to get in on this. But it was really interesting to be like

355
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,980
Speaker 5:  the confidence of everybody. I was reading about talking about this company.

356
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,710
Speaker 5:  Like there wasn't like, even with Tesla, we still get the oil. All right.

357
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,250
Speaker 5:  When they ship the car to you, but with this company, it's like

358
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,570
Speaker 5:  cyber, even just the three, the model three. But with this company is like,

359
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,550
Speaker 5:  no, they're doing it. It's happening. It's coming.

360
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,150
Speaker 1:  If ribbon can ship these cars and they don't have the panel gaps that newer

361
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,320
Speaker 1:  model threes, like

362
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,270
Speaker 5:  Your whole hand in there,

363
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,620
Speaker 1:  Like Tesla ships, a lot of cars and people love them. Right? Like

364
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,130
Speaker 1:  there are Teslas in my family. Like I've got Tesla

365
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,820
Speaker 1:  evangelists who are related to me. You don't have to tell me how great Tesla

366
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,300
Speaker 1:  is. Trust me. I can just, it's at home. It's already in my house.

367
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,680
Speaker 1:  But like the cars are just not, well-made like, there's, there's no getting

368
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,640
Speaker 1:  around it. If Rubian can like surpass that. And they're in the biggest category

369
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,490
Speaker 1:  in the country, lowest bar. Well, but it's still a bar.

370
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,220
Speaker 1:  I mean the Ford ship, the Maki. And they had to recall it like three times

371
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,860
Speaker 1:  in the last time they recall it because like, cause the roof was getting

372
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,850
Speaker 1:  unglued. Like new cars are hard. So let's say they shift the car. Let's talk

373
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,970
Speaker 1:  about the actual car. The RNC is really interesting. Mitchell got to drive

374
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,450
Speaker 1:  one. The inside of it is more Tesla like than not.

375
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,560
Speaker 1:  I would say it's got the big screen and they built a custom software stack.

376
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,050
Speaker 1:  Can we just talk about the headlights first?

377
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,750
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean it's, it's definitely, if you haven't seen it, you should go

378
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,070
Speaker 4:  look at a photo, pull over your car

379
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,640
Speaker 4:  and, and take a look at a photo of your

380
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,900
Speaker 1:  Gas engine. Yeah.

381
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,950
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean a lot of electric vehicles, whereas 10 years ago,

382
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,700
Speaker 4:  all of the hybrids and like early electrics were like,

383
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,960
Speaker 4:  let's make a really funky body type and put blue accents

384
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,740
Speaker 4:  on everything. You know, now a lot of

385
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,050
Speaker 4:  electric vehicle startups are trying to signal that something's different

386
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,710
Speaker 4:  about the car by going with continuous light bars in the front and then in

387
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,520
Speaker 4:  the back and reveal and sort of mixes that up a little bit by using these

388
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,450
Speaker 4:  two, like pill shaped headlights that go perpendicular to

389
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,960
Speaker 4:  the light bar. So it gives it, yeah, it gives it, I don't know what you even

390
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,950
Speaker 4:  call it. It looks like a, a bug it's. It's definitely interesting. Like it

391
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,510
Speaker 4:  takes some getting used to

392
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,660
Speaker 1:  People out there who are trying to call them snake eyes to make it sound

393
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,020
Speaker 1:  tough.

394
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,120
Speaker 4:  No,

395
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,650
Speaker 1:  It just looks very friendly. Like it looks like it wants to give you a hug.

396
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,490
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And like, I think that probably works to what they're going for. Yeah.

397
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,850
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's the, it's the, it's the blocker for me, but go look at it. And

398
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,910
Speaker 1:  then on the inside, right? One of the things about all these car companies

399
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,690
Speaker 1:  that is utterly fascinating to me is the inside of the car is

400
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,980
Speaker 1:  at this point more important than the outside. And like this software experience

401
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,970
Speaker 1:  of the car is I would say in disarray around the industry

402
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,960
Speaker 1:  in general, but they've had to build their own stack from the ground up and

403
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,480
Speaker 1:  it's all of their own stuff. What does that look like?

404
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, it's, it's still very Tesla style, you know,

405
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,360
Speaker 4:  like you look at the interface, if you, if you go look at Mitchell's piece

406
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,110
Speaker 4:  or there are definitely a lot of good videos on YouTube from the

407
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,860
Speaker 4:  press drives, like the interface is very, it's very similar to what Tesla

408
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,880
Speaker 4:  has done. It's a very like clean looking, maybe almost

409
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,840
Speaker 4:  a little too, sort of over done UI as far as

410
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,740
Speaker 4:  like a, you know, some features may be hidden. It's all touch screen based.

411
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,820
Speaker 4:  And so that's, that's something that they, that and the

412
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,210
Speaker 4:  software that actually manages the car is something that they made a lot

413
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,840
Speaker 4:  of hires around earlier on. And I think that's probably

414
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,290
Speaker 4:  the hope is that it's gonna pay off for them because like that is one of

415
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,080
Speaker 4:  the things that can be really difficult once these cars get on the road,

416
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,020
Speaker 4:  everybody talks about wanting to have over the air updates and how that's

417
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,010
Speaker 4:  transformative. You know, Tesla uses it to make its cars better, but there

418
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,730
Speaker 4:  are a lot of things that can go wrong with that stuff too. And so

419
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,050
Speaker 4:  they're really trying to go for, I think what Tesla offers, which is this

420
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,890
Speaker 4:  idea of like a living car, something that can sort of change and get

421
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,610
Speaker 4:  better in a way that like the traditional automakers are kind of

422
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,450
Speaker 4:  promising something similar, but you're never going to get

423
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,110
Speaker 4:  in as like fluid, like the traditional automakers are going to be like

424
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,520
Speaker 4:  the Samsung phone that never gets the Android update faster than

425
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,480
Speaker 4:  the Google. Right? Like, whereas like this is the Caribbean

426
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,330
Speaker 4:  is the Google play edition of electric vehicles.

427
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,990
Speaker 2:  Oh my God. But it does need some software updates. It doesn't like just from

428
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,890
Speaker 2:  watching a bunch of the videos, it seems like there's a little bit still

429
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,850
Speaker 2:  of lag and bugginess, and they're really upfront about it too. Like the,

430
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,740
Speaker 2:  who is Quinn Nelson was talking in his, his video about it, that

431
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,890
Speaker 2:  he would go and talk to the engineers and be like, I don't know about this.

432
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,990
Speaker 2:  And they'd be like, yeah, we don't, we don't like it either. Like there was

433
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,930
Speaker 2:  a trade-off and we're working on it. Like they were like refreshingly honest,

434
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,830
Speaker 2:  but like they're not, they're not shipping a perfect software experience

435
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,100
Speaker 2:  yet.

436
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,740
Speaker 4:  I think, you know, one of the problems you run into with this stuff too,

437
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,670
Speaker 4:  is like, because software is something you can change.

438
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,120
Speaker 4:  It's harder to agree upon what it should do.

439
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,200
Speaker 4:  You know? Whereas like you got to lock in the body type and the

440
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,710
Speaker 4:  frame and like, like the mechanics of the car have to be set and you can't

441
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,610
Speaker 4:  really tinker with those. So I think that you probably run into a situation

442
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,060
Speaker 4:  like that. Like I've heard from someone recently at another startup that

443
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,840
Speaker 4:  was just about to ship that is like running into a similar problem, but

444
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,680
Speaker 4:  worse than Ruby and where like, there are big disagreements about how even

445
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,670
Speaker 4:  UIL elements should work at a very late stage in the

446
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,510
Speaker 4:  game that shouldn't be happening. And I think, you know, for all of the

447
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,300
Speaker 4:  money that it's raised in all of the things that it's been able to accomplish

448
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,200
Speaker 4:  so far, something is going to have to deal with is, like I said, it's got

449
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,130
Speaker 4:  9,000 people already. It is a very big company

450
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,580
Speaker 4:  now and trying to manage all that and keep all those people

451
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,420
Speaker 4:  together and aim them sort of at the same, like

452
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,290
Speaker 4:  success target that repeat, you know, RJ syringe was

453
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,500
Speaker 4:  aiming them at a couple of years ago when they were a much smaller team has

454
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,560
Speaker 4:  gotta be really hard. So I feel like that's probably one of those places

455
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,720
Speaker 4:  where it shows. And it's also like you're taking advantage of the fact that

456
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,500
Speaker 4:  you can change it up until MEV Eva. And after you shipped the

457
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,650
Speaker 4:  car. So like, I don't know. I feel like, I feel like that's just going to

458
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,870
Speaker 4:  keep happening with this stuff when we're talking about the software or the

459
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,520
Speaker 4:  cars, which is kind of doesn't sound great.

460
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,470
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, this is what I mean, like I, the amount of bad car software

461
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,370
Speaker 1:  that you can interact with as a regular person, like just go to a

462
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,650
Speaker 1:  car, go to any car. If you're in your car

463
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,100
Speaker 2:  Right now, you're still pulled over. Just, just play with your software for

464
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,290
Speaker 2:  a minute and just think about how would you accept this?

465
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,010
Speaker 5:  I'm buying a car right now. And I've seriously looked at used cars. And I

466
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,820
Speaker 5:  was like, actually I need to go up a year because the UI changes. And I just

467
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,780
Speaker 5:  can't deal with like that very old looking UI. Cause you always, always

468
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,680
Speaker 5:  also look like at least 10 years older than anything on your phone.

469
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,610
Speaker 5:  It's just like

470
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,830
Speaker 1:  Walnuts, you watch any YouTube car review. And like, no one wants to admit

471
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,820
Speaker 1:  it. So they're all like, and this screen has CarPlay and Android

472
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,780
Speaker 1:  auto and they just like move on. And it's like, no, wait, hold on. Like

473
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,770
Speaker 1:  many other things happened on that screen. Tesla is pretty good at it. People

474
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,340
Speaker 1:  love Tesla. They're good at over the updates. The other car makers are now

475
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,120
Speaker 1:  setting goals for themselves in terms of number of

476
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,080
Speaker 1:  over the year updates they deliver in a year. So both Ford

477
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,010
Speaker 1:  and GM and still Lantis here. Sweet, still

478
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,730
Speaker 1:  Lantus. They all talk about Dilip like is though that that is the thing that

479
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,600
Speaker 1:  people want. Like I don't, I don't know if they've ever talked to like a

480
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,470
Speaker 1:  regular person. Like no one is like, I love my phone because it gets

481
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,400
Speaker 1:  so many updates a year because Tesla's delivering so

482
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,460
Speaker 1:  many updates a year. They think that's the thing they have to compete with.

483
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,660
Speaker 1:  So if we just like screw with your card multiple times a year, you'll be

484
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,780
Speaker 1:  happy is like kind of where their heads are at. But all of that is related

485
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,710
Speaker 1:  to the fact that they have none of the systems to do it. Right? So be saying,

486
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,490
Speaker 1:  we want to deliver 20 updates a year, requires them to build a

487
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,480
Speaker 1:  system such that they can even do it. And so you just see how a

488
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,410
Speaker 1:  corporation takes something, like make the computer good and

489
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,220
Speaker 1:  backs it into a metric that has no relationship to

490
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,850
Speaker 1:  human beings. But you understand why? The question for me is like,

491
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,360
Speaker 1:  Ravion has to do that. They have to fix the software in the car. They have

492
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,510
Speaker 1:  to ship the cars. Cars have to be good. They have to service cars, they have

493
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,470
Speaker 1:  to charge the cars. They want to build a charging network. Can

494
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:01,860
Speaker 1:  we talk about

495
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,720
Speaker 2:  That for just a minute before we move on to the

496
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,590
Speaker 1:  Rest of it, this is just a lot to put, like the truck is like Mitchell really

497
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,010
Speaker 1:  loved the truck and he, the feature of the drive tunnel in the middle where

498
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,760
Speaker 1:  he like crawled into the space between the bed and the body, all that stuff

499
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,950
Speaker 1:  is cool. Go watch the YouTube. They've done a good job, giving them to YouTube

500
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,360
Speaker 1:  offers like they've done excellent marketing around this truck, but you just

501
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,350
Speaker 1:  like, kind of look at that universe of other stuff they have to do. And

502
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,690
Speaker 1:  I, there's still a lot of question marks what they have

503
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,380
Speaker 4:  Looking for them in their favor in a weird way, because this

504
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,550
Speaker 4:  sort of may sound like a problem is that they

505
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,360
Speaker 4:  are going to be so focused on this Amazon contract

506
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,360
Speaker 4:  and building these Amazon delivery vehicles that they they've said they've

507
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,110
Speaker 4:  collected 55,000 something pre-orders for the

508
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,590
Speaker 4:  pickup truck and the SUV combine. And they've said, it's going to take them

509
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,550
Speaker 4:  until the end of 2023 just to make those vehicles. Wow. So

510
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,480
Speaker 4:  they, instead of being like, you know, jumping in

511
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,320
Speaker 4:  like Ford, for instance, actually made more than the 50,000

512
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,980
Speaker 4:  Mustang Maki's this year than they had planned, like only a couple thousand

513
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,460
Speaker 4:  more, not like an insane amount, more, but ribbons looking at only doing

514
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,670
Speaker 4:  that within the next two years. So there, they have a little bit of breathing

515
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,630
Speaker 4:  room in that sense that there isn't going to be 200,000

516
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,140
Speaker 4:  of their vehicles out there to get right. They can kind of control

517
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,830
Speaker 4:  what's out there a little better, but they also have to throw a ton of focus

518
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,580
Speaker 4:  on the delivery vehicle side of things. And then, and then also,

519
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,640
Speaker 4:  yes, do these other efforts like build out a charging network, which they're

520
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,510
Speaker 4:  trying to do, which, you know, if no one else is gonna do it and

521
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,780
Speaker 4:  there's going to be part of this and the infrastructure bill. So like there

522
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,470
Speaker 4:  is going to be more charging stations coming, but like that's, that's a tall

523
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,010
Speaker 4:  task. That's even someone like Eby go, which is like a company that's been

524
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,430
Speaker 4:  around for awhile. That's dedicated to making electric vehicle chargers

525
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,630
Speaker 4:  knows what it needs to do to build them. Even it's having trouble and

526
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,500
Speaker 4:  as well, capitalized, it's having trouble hitting the targets

527
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,590
Speaker 4:  that it's setting for how many it wants to build. Because like the permitting

528
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,040
Speaker 4:  process in this country differs every different place that you go to build

529
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,730
Speaker 4:  a charger and there's all this stuff. So like they, they have

530
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,620
Speaker 4:  created a lot of work for themselves. And so, so

531
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,260
Speaker 4:  even with the consumer products that th the two vehicles that they're

532
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,130
Speaker 4:  extensively selling under their brand to people, you know, you

533
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,520
Speaker 4:  got to hope that, that they're, they're going to be able to address those

534
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,420
Speaker 4:  as products in a, like a totally whole sense while also managing

535
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,200
Speaker 4:  all this other stuff and, and maintaining 9,000 employees,

536
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,010
Speaker 4:  what is

537
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,150
Speaker 1:  Their overall charging

538
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:35,020
Speaker 4:  Strategy? Is it just, they're basically building out their own kind of

539
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,590
Speaker 4:  network, like Tesla supercharging network that will be proprietary at

540
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,400
Speaker 4:  first, you know, maybe open up after that. They're also tapping into

541
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,360
Speaker 4:  this idea of doing some more like destination charters that are near

542
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,920
Speaker 4:  trailheads and things like that.

543
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,030
Speaker 2:  We're going to put all our charters next to like off-road trails. So you're

544
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,810
Speaker 2:  gonna, you're going to go and charge up out in the wilderness is their idea.

545
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,020
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

546
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,040
Speaker 4:  That's my plan that I have the idea that the founder told me back when I

547
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,030
Speaker 4:  first interviewed him in 2018. That's like the galaxy brain idea for the

548
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,600
Speaker 4:  company was, and probably still is in some ways, but

549
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,590
Speaker 4:  they, you, if you notice, they're not talking as much about autonomy as they

550
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,190
Speaker 4:  used to, but the, the galaxy brain idea for Vivian was you

551
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,030
Speaker 4:  go, you know, you drive with your ribbon to the

552
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,020
Speaker 4:  Puddin spot, you drop your kayaks in the water. You go down the river, your

553
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,350
Speaker 4:  ribbon automatically drives down to where you're getting out of the water

554
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,590
Speaker 4:  and, oh, that's cute. Yeah. I love that.

555
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,190
Speaker 1:  I thought it was going to be like, then the reveal lowers

556
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,330
Speaker 1:  a wheel into the river and charges itself, like an

557
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,560
Speaker 4:  Old timey. That's a good idea, because that would be,

558
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:39,770
Speaker 1:  They

559
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,440
Speaker 4:  Should do that. Yeah. You should have hit up their investor relations team.

560
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,970
Speaker 1:  Got, I've got a great water wheel idea that you just have to

561
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,670
Speaker 1:  zoom out. Right? So ribbon, I think is the first new electric car

562
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,120
Speaker 1:  company it's hit it's at this moment. It's IPO mode. It is starting to ship

563
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,020
Speaker 1:  the cars. There is, I would say just a level of confidence. They're

564
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,350
Speaker 1:  going to hit the first mark, which is like shipping a bunch of cars, being

565
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,040
Speaker 1:  a real company, not a bunch of financial shenanigans in a

566
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,940
Speaker 1:  3d render, which is like, what most Eby startups have been for awhile.

567
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,780
Speaker 1:  They're going to get there. But if you just zoom out, we are in this mode

568
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,960
Speaker 1:  of electrification, you Shawnee. And I talked to this, like, as, maybe you

569
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,080
Speaker 1:  feel this way too. I don't want to buy a car without a battery ever again.

570
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,920
Speaker 1:  Same. And whether it's a hybrid or an Evie, like, I just feel like I should,

571
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,720
Speaker 1:  my next car should definitely have a battery.

572
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,890
Speaker 5:  I mean, I live in New York city. So where there are no chargers

573
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,370
Speaker 5:  that are like freely available. So it's like just unreasonable.

574
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,550
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. But you can get like a Prius, like there's like a number of ways

575
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,120
Speaker 1:  to get like a

576
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,380
Speaker 5:  Hybrid. Yeah.

577
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,160
Speaker 1:  So I'm just like, there, I feel like a lot of people are there,

578
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,090
Speaker 1:  but the actual number of cars you can buy to meet that demand

579
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,450
Speaker 1:  outside of the ship shortage and all the other stuff that's going on. The

580
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,810
Speaker 1:  actual number of cars that are available to me, that demand is shockingly

581
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,620
Speaker 1:  low, right? Like every car company will show you a concept.

582
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,590
Speaker 1:  Car cattle could make the lyric is coming and you're like, can I buy it?

583
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,580
Speaker 1:  And I get on this waiting list. Test is like a cyber truck. This

584
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,150
Speaker 1:  waiting list is even more of a spiritual idea, right? Like,

585
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,160
Speaker 1:  what is, why is there such a gap? Why, why I it's, it's rare that

586
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,030
Speaker 1:  consumer demand is so far ahead of where the industry is.

587
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,340
Speaker 1:  And I can't quite, I can't quite figure it out

588
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,280
Speaker 5:  Oil and gas companies. Is there a conspiracy

589
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,380
Speaker 1:  It's, they're just running around handing out cash.

590
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,150
Speaker 4:  I mean, they could, I mean, and what's made it even worse is the, you mentioned

591
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,960
Speaker 4:  the chip shortage. It's like finding a new car right now is really hard

592
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,920
Speaker 4:  because there are so few of them that the demand is just taking them

593
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,730
Speaker 4:  right off the lot, as soon as they arrive and finding a used car,

594
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,780
Speaker 4:  it means you're spending way more than you need to on a car that is

595
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,620
Speaker 4:  not worth that much. So on top of all that, the people are turning

596
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,980
Speaker 4:  even more to electric vehicle sales, like electric vehicle vehicles are actually

597
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,490
Speaker 4:  making up far more of the market right now, still single digit

598
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,520
Speaker 4:  percentage points, but more than we thought they were going to this year

599
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,210
Speaker 4:  based on like how they were growing before. So yeah, there's,

600
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,780
Speaker 4:  there's definitely a lack of it. It doesn't help that GM had to pull the

601
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,360
Speaker 4:  Chevy bolt off of, off of dealer lots because of the

602
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,370
Speaker 4:  recall related to the battery fires that they experienced with that that's

603
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,220
Speaker 4:  definitely that's hurt them, especially because they just launched two new

604
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,820
Speaker 4:  versions of it that were a little more capable, a little more modern,

605
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,400
Speaker 4:  a little less ugly. Yeah. A little, yeah, a little less ugly,

606
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,560
Speaker 4:  but you know that, so that's not helped. And then, you know, I, the

607
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,190
Speaker 4:  Mustang Maki has done really well, but we're just still in that weird

608
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,300
Speaker 4:  sort of valley between the promises that were

609
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,270
Speaker 4:  made. The way I always think about is like mid 2010s

610
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,020
Speaker 4:  was when we started to see all these startups show up and say, we're going

611
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,560
Speaker 4:  to be the next Tesla auto makers are still not maybe taking it as seriously

612
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,400
Speaker 4:  as they should. A couple of years later, those first startups were

613
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,090
Speaker 4:  starting to really fall apart and the automakers were like, let's do it.

614
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,020
Speaker 4:  And so we're just, we're just about to round that corner of how long it takes

615
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,890
Speaker 4:  an automaker to put a vehicle on the road from when it was originally

616
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,370
Speaker 4:  conceived and, and the startups are,

617
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,120
Speaker 4:  have reignited with all this new money that's coming to this space the last

618
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,540
Speaker 4:  two years. And so they're actually kind of arriving at a similar point, which

619
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,840
Speaker 4:  is why we have Ruby and now Lisa motors shipping

620
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,430
Speaker 4:  and a couple other ones, you know, potentially shipping next year. So it's

621
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,770
Speaker 4:  like sort of an unfortunate series of events.

622
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:27,030
Speaker 1:  I just can't imagine if you back out to smartphones right there.

623
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,610
Speaker 1:  Weren't just a lot of people walking around me. I'm like, my next phone is

624
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,600
Speaker 1:  going to have a touch screen. And the industry was like, w next year. Yeah,

625
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,360
Speaker 1:  it was the initially being like touchscreens are here. And everyone's like,

626
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,660
Speaker 1:  oh, that's a really good idea. We got to catch up to it. And here, it just

627
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,260
Speaker 1:  really feels to me like a lot of people. And maybe it's

628
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,710
Speaker 1:  because I mostly hear from like for chest fans or whatever, but a lot of

629
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,230
Speaker 1:  people are like, I want my next car to have a battery in it. Whether it's

630
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,650
Speaker 1:  a hybrid or full levy, like, I'm, I feel this way about

631
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,490
Speaker 1:  climate. I, I want my car to accelerate really fast, which

632
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,510
Speaker 1:  is a lot of people really want their cars to accelerate really fast, but

633
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,970
Speaker 1:  there's a lot of reasons you want a battery in your car and like, your choices

634
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,000
Speaker 1:  are a number of compact crossovers in that. Is it?

635
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,420
Speaker 2:  Well, I mean, you just described the us auto industry, Nila, your choices

636
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,380
Speaker 2:  are a number of compact crossovers and big ass trucks. And there's only two

637
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,600
Speaker 2:  sedans. There's two sedans you can buy, right?

638
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,020
Speaker 1:  No, that's it. Yeah, that's it. But it's not to me that like, not every car

639
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,010
Speaker 1:  is a hybrid, right? Like that, that feels like a miss from

640
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,130
Speaker 1:  the auto industry. They could have gotten there. They, you know, most car

641
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,820
Speaker 1:  companies, like at this point, like taco belling, their platforms,

642
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,870
Speaker 1:  right. They have three engines and like, they're just like mixing and matching

643
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,350
Speaker 1:  the parts.

644
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,060
Speaker 5:  Th th the battery and the infrastructure is the hesitancy there, right?

645
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,330
Speaker 5:  Like the batteries are still limited there. The, the limited distance and

646
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,930
Speaker 5:  a lot of people live far away, especially you get to the rural folks and

647
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,710
Speaker 5:  everything. They they're further away. Like they need, they, they need to

648
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,980
Speaker 5:  be able to charge quickly. The charging experience is still garbage. Like

649
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,830
Speaker 5:  I thought about getting an electric car and then I was like, okay, first

650
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,550
Speaker 5:  I have to pay for whatever, a place to charge it here in the city. Yikes.

651
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,670
Speaker 5:  And then like, if I ever want to, you know, go back to Texas and visit family,

652
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,840
Speaker 5:  I've added a lot more hours on my drive just to get my car

653
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,560
Speaker 5:  there. And it's like, that's, that's no good. Like, that's, that's a really

654
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,520
Speaker 5:  bad situation. It feels like, like the desire is there.

655
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,660
Speaker 5:  And everybody else's behind, like the industries, like the car industry is

656
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,490
Speaker 5:  behind. And then like those supporting industries, like, you know, mobile

657
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,280
Speaker 5:  and shell and all of these companies, they could be putting charging

658
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,420
Speaker 5:  stations in there. And there

659
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,090
Speaker 1:  It's funny. Cause you said mobile and I was going to go, I thought you meant

660
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,930
Speaker 1:  mobile phones. Someone asked me like, for example, no one is like, I want

661
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,670
Speaker 1:  5g in industry is like, you desperately

662
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,320
Speaker 5:  KTV is nobody wanted a 4k TV or a smart TV.

663
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,260
Speaker 1:  Like nobody, nobody, I didn't want to, nobody wanted a

664
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,570
Speaker 5:  Smart TV. They're like, I want to figure that out myself and the TV companies

665
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,110
Speaker 5:  are like, no.

666
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,870
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I'm just saying, there's a lot of people listening to this show who

667
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,820
Speaker 1:  are like, I know I did want more pixels. That's actually a thing that I wanted.

668
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,830
Speaker 1:  Sorry guys.

669
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,640
Speaker 4:  Speaking of 5g, do you know who's going to come in and save that all and

670
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,490
Speaker 4:  solve this problem. Foxconn baby.

671
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,960
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Do you want it, do you want to talk about Lordstown and Foxconn and

672
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,440
Speaker 1:  what's going on there?

673
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,370
Speaker 4:  Yeah. As briefly as anyone will tolerate Foxconn

674
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,180
Speaker 4:  announced yesterday, they announced this in September, they kind of like

675
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,780
Speaker 4:  finalize it yesterday. They're buying a former general

676
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,990
Speaker 4:  motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which had

677
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,890
Speaker 4:  famously shut down while Trump was in office and he

678
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,700
Speaker 4:  got very mad about it. And then he actually really touted the

679
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,690
Speaker 4:  sale of it a couple months later to this new startup Lord, some

680
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,410
Speaker 4:  motors, which is an electric vehicle startup with no history. And

681
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,430
Speaker 4:  they've been trying to make, get that factory ready to make a pickup truck

682
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,130
Speaker 4:  over the last couple of years and have just run into a ton of problems of

683
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,670
Speaker 4:  their own. And now Foxconn is buying that factory and Foxconn has spent the

684
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,570
Speaker 4:  last year plus talking about how it wants to get to electric

685
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,990
Speaker 4:  vehicles. It's made its own electric vehicle platform. It

686
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,680
Speaker 4:  has bought up or partnering with a whole bunch of other

687
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,400
Speaker 4:  companies, including, you know, startups like Fisker or

688
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,270
Speaker 4:  big companies like still Lantis. And so now they have,

689
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,210
Speaker 4:  you know, unless the deal doesn't close by eight, it's supposed to close

690
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,110
Speaker 4:  in April and who knows what Foxconn, but Foxconn is

691
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,800
Speaker 4:  going to have an automotive factory and electric vehicle factory in Ohio

692
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,390
Speaker 4:  where it will make the pickup truck for Lordstown motors. It'll make some

693
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,930
Speaker 4:  new vehicle that they haven't announced yet with Fisker. And who knows what

694
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,630
Speaker 4:  else? There's a lot of space. They're 6 million square feet. So,

695
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,470
Speaker 1:  And Love's a big empty building. You can't get enough of how long is the

696
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,460
Speaker 1:  drive from Racine to Lordstown? No, this is actually, this is really funny.

697
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,450
Speaker 1:  Right? So they announced that they were going to look for a factory

698
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,990
Speaker 1:  and everyone thought, oh, they're going to use the one in Wisconsin that

699
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,920
Speaker 1:  they built to build cars for Fisker. Sure. And then Henrik, Fisker

700
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:49,270
Speaker 1:  was like, no, we're not going to do that. Like straight up that

701
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,570
Speaker 1:  it was either Wisconsin or Mexico. And they're like, we're deciding. And

702
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,160
Speaker 1:  they kept visiting the Wisconsin facility. And like, here are, these are

703
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,100
Speaker 1:  us ops. What Fisker was actually doing was he was lobbying to

704
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,000
Speaker 1:  change the rule in Wisconsin that says all cars have to be sold by a dealer.

705
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,170
Speaker 1:  Right. Okay. Well, I'm just going to tell you the

706
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,130
Speaker 1:  Wisconsin GOP, which is, you know, the group that

707
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,030
Speaker 1:  put the Foxconn deal in place is captured by the Wisconsin

708
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,900
Speaker 1:  auto dealers. So that to save their own project, they

709
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,860
Speaker 1:  had to, they had to go against one of their biggest constituencies. I

710
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,490
Speaker 1:  mean, it's just, it's like a hilarious, so they, they didn't change the law.

711
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,760
Speaker 1:  So fester like walked and went to Ohio where they can sell a car to attract

712
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,310
Speaker 1:  all in. All of this is just like, like it's and we still don't spend there.

713
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:34,700
Speaker 1:  I

714
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,690
Speaker 4:  Love the idea. It's really, it's really wonderful that Foxconn maybe had

715
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,410
Speaker 4:  a total out there to like fill its empty buildings in Wisconsin with

716
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,170
Speaker 4:  something and say like, Hey, we're going to do this. And here now we're going

717
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,440
Speaker 4:  to make EVs. And instead they've now ended up in this situation where they

718
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,500
Speaker 4:  have two currently very empty

719
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,700
Speaker 4:  large sites in the United.

720
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,130
Speaker 5:  I mean, they built a building, like they built buildings. That's

721
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,710
Speaker 1:  It's also funny that Fisker like blew up this chance to get

722
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,770
Speaker 1:  really good press and like do this on Wisconsin because they insisted on

723
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:10,580
Speaker 1:  selling the cars direct. Like, I don't know, Tesla's building plants in Texas,

724
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,160
Speaker 1:  people in Texas when they buy a Tesla, they have to import, they have to

725
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,660
Speaker 1:  go to another place. It's a,

726
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,770
Speaker 5:  And they're totally okay with it. They're like, yeah, drive an

727
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,390
Speaker 5:  Oklahoma. See y'all in an hour.

728
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,260
Speaker 1:  I mean, that's just funny to me. I don't have any strong feelings on whether

729
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,090
Speaker 1:  cars need to be sold through dealers or not. But I do think that the fact

730
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,810
Speaker 1:  that people in Texas have to do a round trip out of state to get a car is

731
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,080
Speaker 1:  hilarious. And the fact that Fisker blew up their own

732
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,950
Speaker 1:  chance to rescue the Fox on planet Wisconsin over this rule is deeply

733
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,950
Speaker 1:  hilarious. But what were we expecting when they announced the week? We might

734
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,160
Speaker 1:  build the cars in Wisconsin. I think Sean and Josh and I are like, no, he

735
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,370
Speaker 1:  won

736
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,000
Speaker 1:  before we even knew the details.

737
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,500
Speaker 2:  Just very briefly. We've gone way far field. And we haven't talked about

738
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,410
Speaker 2:  the kitchen and a tube that can fit inside the ravine track. Like

739
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,940
Speaker 2:  it does that a real thing. Do you think that, or is that just a really cool

740
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,510
Speaker 2:  gimmick? Do they actually intend to sell any of those? Because if you don't

741
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:09,500
Speaker 2:  know that the truck has this pass through chamber and you can buy like

742
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,370
Speaker 2:  a camping kit, that's got like a working sink and a grill that like slides

743
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:13,520
Speaker 2:  out

744
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,310
Speaker 1:  Of your truck. That's what you meant by kitchen and a tube. I would buy

745
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,000
Speaker 5:  That tube

746
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,480
Speaker 4:  A heartbeat. Add that to your email, to their investor relations people in

747
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,750
Speaker 4:  the lab.

748
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,140
Speaker 4:  I mean, here's, here's my answer. They're charging $5,000 for it. So

749
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,590
Speaker 4:  yeah. They're going to try and sell it to people. Yeah. Okay. Fair enough.

750
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,010
Speaker 4:  Not every vehicle is going to come with it, but yeah, if they can charge

751
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,270
Speaker 4:  $5,000 for someone,

752
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,830
Speaker 5:  Every vehicle, like right now, the only, the only versions, the only trim

753
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,230
Speaker 5:  levels sold are the most expensive trim

754
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,200
Speaker 1:  Levels. Yeah. I just price thrown out. It's $83,000.

755
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,770
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. The base price we should have said on both of these

756
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,730
Speaker 4:  vehicles is like 67 grand, but you'll be waiting a while for that.

757
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,530
Speaker 5:  You'll be getting the 90,000. Sorry.

758
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,050
Speaker 2:  The new trend is set up buying a pixel phone on the verge cast. You buy an

759
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,510
Speaker 2:  electric vehicle on the verge cast. Is that what's happening here? Right?

760
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,230
Speaker 1:  I can, I can put a hundred dollars down on any number of cars that aren't

761
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:03,590
Speaker 1:  shipping

762
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,410
Speaker 1:  is absolutely the weirdest time to be. I mean, Alex knows she's

763
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,040
Speaker 1:  actually been horrible. I'm addicted to car shopping. I like,

764
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,420
Speaker 1:  and it's just amazing how many cars don't currently exist.

765
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,510
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like you can look at webpages for cars for days,

766
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,020
Speaker 5:  And then you go to buy and it's like, no, no, no. You have to wait four months.

767
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,900
Speaker 5:  And then we're, we're not, we're not going to get the one you went in. We're

768
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,290
Speaker 5:  going to get the one that's $20,000 more take, give us your

769
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,960
Speaker 1:  Money. You've all those phone mounts. You know, you need cars for all this

770
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,890
Speaker 1:  fun. I got to put up. I got to, yeah. That's it really

771
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,340
Speaker 1:  start? You start small and you go big and I'm just going to start buying

772
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,940
Speaker 1:  like nineties escalates. They're cheap. They're available. No one wants them.

773
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,360
Speaker 1:  There's no, there's all that used. Car demand is not pointed at nineties.

774
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,220
Speaker 1:  Technically they have a battery in them. I guess there was a,

775
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,210
Speaker 1:  there was a brief ill-fated escalate hybrid. It is not a

776
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,570
Speaker 1:  good car, but I'm at the point where I'm like, well that has a battery.

777
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,010
Speaker 1:  It seems fine. All right, Sean, thank you so much. We got to take a break.

778
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,710
Speaker 1:  Thanks for coming on, man. Yeah, of course. Alright. We're gonna take a break.

779
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,340
Speaker 1:  We'll be right back

780
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,100
Speaker 7:  Support for this episode comes from single store, the single database for

781
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,090
Speaker 7:  all data intensive applications. Why make the switch scaling

782
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,990
Speaker 7:  modern? SAS is already hard. It's even harder when you're using databases

783
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,110
Speaker 7:  that were built back when all your friends had pet rocks and the most stressful

784
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:31,920
Speaker 7:  part of your day was connecting to the dial up modem. Single store is

785
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,490
Speaker 7:  built for the smart SAS generation and all the data intensive applications

786
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,060
Speaker 7:  that come with it. The single store cloud powers, the new wave of SAS

787
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,050
Speaker 7:  technologies, displacing legacy providers with insights, for apps, effortless

788
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,230
Speaker 7:  operation of models at scale and easy shifts to the cloud.

789
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,460
Speaker 7:  Introduce simplicity and ease to your data structure and watch what happens

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:00,090
Speaker 7:  single store can help you at single

795
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,810
Speaker 8:  This is paid content presented by Volvo cars. If you've never driven a

796
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,740
Speaker 8:  fully electric vehicle, like the Volvo XC 40 recharged before you might

797
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,490
Speaker 8:  be wondering, what's it like? So we developed a course for electric

798
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,670
Speaker 8:  vehicle first-timers they had a lot of questions.

799
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,770
Speaker 9:  Ah, well I understand you're all here because somehow you've never driven

800
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,640
Speaker 9:  a fully electric car before. Don't worry. You must have questions, but I'm

801
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,740
Speaker 9:  here to answer them. Yes. You in the front,

802
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,780
Speaker 7:  Does it have to be plugged in to drive?

803
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,490
Speaker 9:  What, how, how would that? No, no, no. Just plug it in when you get home

804
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,550
Speaker 9:  and charge it up overnight, like you charge your phone for example.

805
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,440
Speaker 9:  Okay. So who's ready to take a look at Volvo XC 40

806
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,130
Speaker 9:  recharge.

807
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,700
Speaker 9:  What happens when there's traffic? The XC 40 recharge has

808
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,630
Speaker 9:  regenerative braking. What's that? Okay. Think of it like this. You're going

809
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,260
Speaker 9:  to be charging your car when you're stuck in traffic. So

810
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,080
Speaker 9:  traffic becomes something you look forward to because it's charging your

811
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,450
Speaker 9:  car and it's not just the engine that's helping the environment. No, no,

812
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,920
Speaker 9:  no. There's more. This carpet is made from a hundred percent recycled

813
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,730
Speaker 9:  pet water bottles. So it's not just premium. It's not just luxurious.

814
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,270
Speaker 9:  It's made with a better world in mind. Oh. And Google is built

815
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,260
Speaker 9:  into the <inaudible> recharge. So Google maps is always with

816
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,290
Speaker 9:  you even if, and

817
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:33,220
Speaker 8:  When you forget your phone, get ready for the next chapter in driving

818
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,000
Speaker 8:  with Volvo's pure electric <inaudible> recharge. The future starts now

819
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,420
Speaker 8:  learn more@volvocars.com slash us.

820
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,440
Speaker 1:  Okay. We're back. It's kind of a lot of apple stuff going on.

821
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,340
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like just a shoe mortgage board and on the

822
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,690
Speaker 2:  smorgasbord is just different

823
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,630
Speaker 1:  Apples. Or should we start with buttons and links? I think we have

824
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:55,810
Speaker 2:  To.

825
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:00,430
Speaker 1:  Okay. So apple versus epic big court case, epic

826
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,560
Speaker 1:  loses on most of its charges of apple being a monopoly and the iPhone being

827
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,390
Speaker 1:  a monopoly in its own operating system. Okay. They

828
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,230
Speaker 1:  win one very important concession from the judge. The judge says Apple's

829
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,800
Speaker 1:  anti steering rules are bad. And to competitive under California law

830
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,210
Speaker 1:  writes an order saying basically crossing out the anti-stigma

831
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,170
Speaker 1:  rule that apple has, right? So you strike this language. Now apps

832
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,740
Speaker 1:  in their metadata and in the application themselves must allow buttons and

833
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,340
Speaker 1:  links pointing to external payment systems. Right? This led to

834
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,120
Speaker 1:  some discussion about buttons and links mean more importantly, it led to

835
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,080
Speaker 1:  apple saying, hold up, that's bad. We want to stay this order. And

836
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,070
Speaker 1:  so we appeal the case and we can win again. Right? So they go to

837
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:45,730
Speaker 1:  the judge and request to stay. They had oral and they filed their motion

838
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,210
Speaker 1:  stuff. They had oral argument in front of the same. Judge. Judge said, no,

839
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:52,870
Speaker 1:  I don't like this. Like if I grant you, this stay, nothing will change for

840
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,410
Speaker 1:  three to five years while you do these appeals that you're gonna do. Right.

841
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,650
Speaker 1:  We thought, okay, they had an oral argument. She yelled at apple a bunch,

842
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,590
Speaker 1:  which was really interesting. Okay. It's going to take a, you know, another

843
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:06,220
Speaker 1:  week or two, like 30 minutes later, she puts out the order saying no, stay

844
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,090
Speaker 1:  granted. And she like dunks on apple a lot. Yeah. Right. The

845
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,030
Speaker 1:  anti steering provisions are one of the key provisions upon which apple has

846
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:16,480
Speaker 1:  been able to successfully charge super competitive commissions,

847
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,720
Speaker 1:  untethered to its intellectual property. Apple's commission rates, depress

848
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,930
Speaker 1:  royalties and suppress competition in the industry generally. She's like,

849
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,820
Speaker 1:  no, I think your anti-competitive.

850
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,390
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, and one of the, one of the key points here was apples

851
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,860
Speaker 2:  meant changing. This rule is going to take years. It's

852
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,250
Speaker 2:  going to be so hard. And the judge is like, no,

853
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,450
Speaker 2:  you've you've. I gave you 90 days. You could, you could figure it out. I'm

854
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,690
Speaker 2:  not even going to give you a 10 day extension because I gave you 90 days.

855
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,050
Speaker 2:  And why didn't she get started by now? It's like, it's like, why didn't you

856
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,720
Speaker 2:  get your homework done? You should have started it by now. It's not my fault.

857
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,710
Speaker 2:  You waited to the last minute.

858
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,400
Speaker 1:  Apple also said it would cause significant engineering resources to comply

859
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,670
Speaker 1:  with this rule, which no one knows what that means. Yeah. Okay. So she says,

860
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,420
Speaker 1:  no, she clarifies buttons and links. Yeah. But then

861
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,870
Speaker 1:  I pretty sure the order has a typo in it. So now we have to talk about something

862
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:08,830
Speaker 1:  else, but she does clarify buttons and links. She says with

863
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,820
Speaker 1:  respect to the alleged need for clarification, because some developers do

864
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,390
Speaker 1:  not understand the scope of the injunction in the developer agreement, prohibits

865
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,080
Speaker 1:  third party, in-app purchasing systems other than apple IAP. And at purchases,

866
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:24,550
Speaker 1:  the court did not enjoy that provision. Didn't say other payment systems,

867
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,700
Speaker 1:  but rather said, you have to be to communicate external alternative and

868
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,610
Speaker 1:  allow links to those external sites. I'm just going to tell you, I don't

869
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,040
Speaker 1:  think she actually clarified anything. Cause I don't know what happens if

870
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,400
Speaker 1:  you have a button in an app that opens it in a browser that already has your

871
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,460
Speaker 1:  login info and billing info in it. And that's how you buy Fortnite dances.

872
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:40,940
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

873
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,750
Speaker 2:  Is that an, is that an in-app purchase or is that a separate

874
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,380
Speaker 2:  browser earlier in the ruling? The judge writes consumers are quite used

875
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,650
Speaker 2:  to linking from app to a web browser. So it's like, yes, we're in the weeds.

876
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,190
Speaker 1:  So in the Kindle app, if it has a button that says buy book and it opens

877
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,400
Speaker 1:  a browser, what are they going to do? Yeah. They definitely still have to

878
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,970
Speaker 1:  put the other button there. I think the apple button

879
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,750
Speaker 1:  probably

880
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,100
Speaker 5:  They have

881
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,760
Speaker 1:  To write that when the court doesn't say so, but I think apple might say

882
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:07,960
Speaker 1:  so.

883
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,870
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And the court doesn't say the court says apple could say, could demand

884
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,700
Speaker 2:  it if it wanted to. I think, yeah.

885
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:17,090
Speaker 1:  So I just, I love the judges. Like I'm clarifying this and she doesn't clarify

886
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,990
Speaker 1:  it, which is very important. So still we're still in the world of

887
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:24,110
Speaker 1:  buttons and links. Apple says, they're going to appeal this again. It is

888
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,100
Speaker 1:  every time you appeal it. Now it's like getting dicier that it'll get stayed,

889
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,280
Speaker 1:  but we'll see it's happened before. But that's where we are with buttons

890
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,240
Speaker 1:  and links is apple has won a lot of this war.

891
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:38,840
Speaker 1:  This very important battle is still not won. And by

892
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,770
Speaker 1:  December 9th, they have to allow developers to tell

893
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,340
Speaker 1:  you places, to buy things that are not apples and communicate the

894
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:50,210
Speaker 1:  prices, which means the pricing pressure on the app store is going to get

895
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,070
Speaker 1:  really incredible. Yeah.

896
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:56,390
Speaker 2:  And actually the judge specifically talks about this. Apple maintains convenience,

897
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,290
Speaker 2:  VIP. If it can compete on pricing, developers may opt to capitalize on

898
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:03,680
Speaker 2:  that convenience, including any reassure. I think she means reinsurance that

899
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,530
Speaker 2:  apple provides customers that may provide safer, blah, blah, blah. But then

900
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,250
Speaker 2:  here's the dunk. The fact remains. It should be their choice,

901
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,390
Speaker 2:  consumer information and transparency and consumer choice is in the

902
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,980
Speaker 2:  interest of the public. Yeah.

903
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,850
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Can we talk about this type of real quick? We have to.

904
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,050
Speaker 1:  So she puts out the, the, she puts out the opinion denying this day

905
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,880
Speaker 1:  and the line, the, you know, the order says apps in their

906
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,660
Speaker 1:  metadata, comma, buttons and links. And I'm pretty sure there's a

907
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,170
Speaker 1:  type of on that. And so now the order actually reads apps in their meta buttons.

908
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,700
Speaker 1:  And I just like lost my mind. Like what is the matter button? Where did

909
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,600
Speaker 1:  this come from? I can't, we have to stop using this word. It's very bad,

910
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:47,960
Speaker 1:  but I'm pretty sure it's a typo. And the, she was copying and pasting, but

911
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,760
Speaker 1:  we figured it out. Is apple

912
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,800
Speaker 5:  Gonna avoid doing what they're supposed to?

913
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,340
Speaker 1:  Because they've redefined the Metta buttons

914
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,310
Speaker 5:  Really hopes. I mean, I don't hope so.

915
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:01,850
Speaker 2:  I hope so. Here's the thing though. The word Metta button appears twice in

916
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,360
Speaker 2:  the ruling.

917
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,730
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. It's real bad. I will say that.

918
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,240
Speaker 1:  It's still not clear. If you push a button, it opens a web view.

919
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,680
Speaker 1:  We know what Apple's going to say, but we still don't know what it means

920
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,680
Speaker 1:  to push a link, to go to a website in the context of the app store

921
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,750
Speaker 2:  Is a metal button, a button in the metaverse.

922
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,180
Speaker 1:  I don't want, I can't, I can't be talking about them out of her seat. The

923
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,880
Speaker 1:  CEO of Disney this week did earnings call. And he was like Disney plus is

924
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,310
Speaker 1:  a metaverse. And we're like, is it?

925
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,960
Speaker 2:  I think it was Benedict Evans. Who said that we're in, in two years

926
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,080
Speaker 2:  where all of this metaverse talk is going to sound like what? The information

927
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,740
Speaker 2:  super highway sounded like the late two thousands. Remember like in the nineties,

928
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,500
Speaker 2:  bill Clinton was like, we're going to go, we're going to get on the information

929
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,990
Speaker 2:  super highway, right after there was a bridge to the future or something,

930
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:49,560
Speaker 2:  something, something. And no one talks about the information superhighway

931
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,600
Speaker 2:  now, because that's a ridiculous metaphor for the internet.

932
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,780
Speaker 1:  You know? It's a fun thing to say, if you just like, if you really want to

933
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,450
Speaker 1:  like push it, don't say information super highway. Just tell someone you

934
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:01,050
Speaker 1:  were surfing the web. Just like, be like, what'd you do last night. And you're

935
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,720
Speaker 1:  like, I surf the web and people will look at you like you are crazy.

936
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,000
Speaker 1:  Do you talk, do you try to do it tonight to go to the bar?

937
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,270
Speaker 5:  Like

938
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,250
Speaker 1:  One of my favorite activities,

939
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,510
Speaker 5:  What were you doing this evening? Surfing the web, waiting for you to get

940
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,490
Speaker 5:  here, surfing the web on my phone.

941
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,120
Speaker 2:  Can I have feelings about surfing the web? Because it means that like people

942
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,850
Speaker 2:  aren't clicking links between websites, everyone's just going to Google.

943
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:27,780
Speaker 2:  It's a sign of monopoly power that we can't surf anymore. Bring

944
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,770
Speaker 2:  back the wave.

945
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,900
Speaker 1:  The worst, the worst point breaks equal of all time.

946
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:37,530
Speaker 1:  It's being pitched right now. I'm just putting it out there.

947
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,460
Speaker 1:  There's a bunch of other apple stuff. Tim cook gave an interview at the deal

948
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,150
Speaker 1:  book conference this week with Andrew Sirkin. He said he owned

949
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:49,050
Speaker 1:  cryptocurrency. He didn't think that apple would like he personally is

950
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,840
Speaker 1:  invested in cryptocurrency. He said, I thought it was a good idea. He said,

951
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,740
Speaker 1:  apple, wasn't interested in it because it's so volatile. He doesn't think

952
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,670
Speaker 1:  people buy apple stock to get exposure to crypto volatility, which is just,

953
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,030
Speaker 1:  you can just see where Tim Cook's head is at. Right? Like he gave the deep

954
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,480
Speaker 1:  answer on crypto volatility and the Andrew Ross Sorkin. I was like, what

955
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,470
Speaker 1:  about the metaphors? He's like, no, no further, no

956
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,340
Speaker 1:  further comments from me. He did say that he thinks

957
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,270
Speaker 1:  sideloading is bad. These some comments on that stuff. Can you explain

958
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,660
Speaker 1:  this face ID right. To repair situation. So

959
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:25,800
Speaker 2:  When you replace a screen on an iPhone 13 and you put it onto

960
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,490
Speaker 2:  another iPhone, there's a chip that makes face ID work.

961
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,660
Speaker 2:  And that stops working if you swap screens and there's

962
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,200
Speaker 2:  no reason it should. There's the secure enclave and all that stuff

963
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,680
Speaker 2:  isn't there. So I fixed it, did the tear down and they

964
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,940
Speaker 2:  investigated that. Like, if you like learn micro soldering and

965
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,900
Speaker 2:  you managed to get the chip off the board, you know, some way and move

966
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,620
Speaker 2:  it to the other thing, it'll continue to work. But functionally, what it

967
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,130
Speaker 2:  does is it takes a huge category of phone

968
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:00,090
Speaker 2:  repairs and puts it in a place where independent repair shops just cannot

969
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:04,050
Speaker 2:  do it because if face ID breaks, you're not going to get your screen

970
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,290
Speaker 2:  replaced from the place that breaks your face ID, just you're not going to

971
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,280
Speaker 2:  do it. And they iOS was putting up various warnings

972
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,150
Speaker 2:  about it. And it was clear that Evel had some idea

973
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:18,930
Speaker 2:  of what was going on here. And they gave

974
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,660
Speaker 2:  us, you know, the information they're like, actually now we're going to,

975
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,700
Speaker 2:  we're going to fix that. You're going to be, to not have to micro, solder

976
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,240
Speaker 2:  a chip from one screen to the other screen, to in order to make your screen

977
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,110
Speaker 2:  swap worker replace your screen. So they actually backed

978
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:36,040
Speaker 2:  off a thing that improved your right to repair, which

979
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,790
Speaker 2:  I don't believe happens without, you know, the current push

980
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,240
Speaker 2:  for right to repair and the current regulatory pressures that are being put

981
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:43,780
Speaker 2:  on big tech.

982
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,920
Speaker 5:  Didn't they do this with the touch ID too. Like the touch ID. You had to

983
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,340
Speaker 5:  switch things over. Otherwise your touch ID would break.

984
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,700
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's, it's very, it's very, very similar. So you'd think conceptually

985
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,520
Speaker 2:  it's the same thing, but I'm pretty sure the chip didn't perform the exact

986
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,210
Speaker 2:  same function.

987
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,120
Speaker 1:  We'll also touch ID. It was not connected to the screen.

988
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:05,080
Speaker 5:  Right. But when you were replacing the front of it, if you replaced the front

989
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,010
Speaker 5:  of it wrong, the touch ID would break because it was like, cause it

990
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,620
Speaker 5:  would be like, oh, you have a new touch ID. We hate you. But yeah,

991
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,640
Speaker 2:  But the part on the 13, like it's connected to the screen face ID and the

992
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,420
Speaker 2:  screen are basically one piece, like some of that stuff. And so

993
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,660
Speaker 2:  swapping that stuff out is really difficult because you've got to get into

994
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,350
Speaker 2:  micro soldering. And so you need to be able to just buy that

995
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:30,040
Speaker 2:  part that has all that stuff on it and put it on when your screen

996
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,460
Speaker 2:  breaks. And only an apple authorized dealer had the

997
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,660
Speaker 2:  software jiggery pokery to authorize face ID on that

998
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,590
Speaker 2:  screen replacement. And they have now stepped back and it

999
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,980
Speaker 2:  no longer will break face ID. If you replace your screen, that also has those

1000
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,000
Speaker 2:  face ID bets on it.

1001
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,200
Speaker 5:  This is like a bug or was this intentional and

1002
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,090
Speaker 5:  oh, they got caught. So that's

1003
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,300
Speaker 2:  An excellent question, Alex, what do you think? Hm,

1004
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,850
Speaker 5:  I sure have opinions on that subject.

1005
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:03,220
Speaker 1:  I think I think theater is right. I think basically the right to repair,

1006
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,760
Speaker 1:  there are bills. There are people in Congress, it's all part of the anti-trust

1007
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,450
Speaker 1:  stuff. Like this is going to be one of those, any member of

1008
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:14,290
Speaker 1:  Congress can be like, and big tech won't even let you fix your phone

1009
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:18,100
Speaker 1:  anymore. If you break the screen, like why walk into that

1010
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:18,700
Speaker 1:  yet?

1011
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:22,540
Speaker 2:  No, I think that there's a, there's an entire category of problems now for

1012
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,960
Speaker 2:  apple where Tim cook is like, you know what? I don't want to think about

1013
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,810
Speaker 2:  it. Like make that go away where normally they'd be like, Nope, we're going

1014
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:31,630
Speaker 2:  to, we're going to hold the line here. But I think right now there's just

1015
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:35,050
Speaker 2:  a category of things. Or Tim Cook's like, Nope, that that's not worth our

1016
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:35,170
Speaker 2:  time.

1017
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:38,560
Speaker 5:  We're going to hold the line on the definition of button. But

1018
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,780
Speaker 1:  Yes, I think anything that's, anything that is easy

1019
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,170
Speaker 1:  for a politician to explain is not a battle worth fighting.

1020
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,910
Speaker 1:  And so you're very simple. Like I love it. You want to get deep

1021
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,810
Speaker 1:  in the weeds on buttons and links and whether or not IAP

1022
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,710
Speaker 1:  should be 30% or 15, like whatever. Like no one at a

1023
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,580
Speaker 1:  town hall meeting, we we've been trying to do it on the show for 10

1024
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:07,450
Speaker 1:  years. And it's very hard. You want to do

1025
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,330
Speaker 1:  blue bubbles? That's my that's still like over the head of most people and

1026
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:14,140
Speaker 1:  people can feel it and they understand it. Apple made it impossible for you

1027
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,740
Speaker 1:  to cheaply repair your screen when you crack your phone, like

1028
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:22,070
Speaker 1:  that's just gold. That's political gold. And like, why, why give him

1029
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,430
Speaker 1:  the gold? And you forced him to do RCS. That's all I'm saying.

1030
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,350
Speaker 2:  Good luck.

1031
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,740
Speaker 1:  Okay. More, more quick apple stuff to kind of interesting

1032
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:34,400
Speaker 1:  hires one, I think makes sense. Like

1033
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:38,150
Speaker 1:  conceptually the other ones. So they, the CEO of Johnson, Johnson has now

1034
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:41,820
Speaker 1:  joined Apple's board. Yep. Great. Presumably because apple just wants to

1035
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,510
Speaker 1:  do health stuff all the time and they think Johnson Johnson will help them.

1036
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:48,470
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, and like they they've been, they've been trying so long to get

1037
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:52,160
Speaker 2:  health, right. Their efforts really need a booster. Very good.

1038
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,160
Speaker 2:  I've got one shot to get it right this time.

1039
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,190
Speaker 1:  Oh my God. That's the virtuous. Everybody only

1040
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,630
Speaker 5:  Works in she percent of the time.

1041
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,840
Speaker 1:  It's brutal. Wow. It is interesting how apple

1042
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,830
Speaker 1:  invests in health. Right. And like they've run into a lot of

1043
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,610
Speaker 1:  problems with health. Okay. They're adding an executive to the

1044
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,860
Speaker 1:  board to, to bring some rigor to that.

1045
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,220
Speaker 2:  And I think bring some rigor to their goals, to like, what are, what is,

1046
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,160
Speaker 2:  what are we planning on doing, besides Tim cook saying health is going to

1047
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,850
Speaker 2:  be our most important contribution? Well like specify the contribution a

1048
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:29,600
Speaker 2:  little bit more clearly. I think having this CEO in particular on the board

1049
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,500
Speaker 2:  helps them do that.

1050
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,500
Speaker 5:  So does this mean they're not going to cause for awhile, they're like maybe

1051
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,490
Speaker 5:  we'll do our own like internal clinics and hospitals. And they realized

1052
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:41,270
Speaker 5:  that was bad. And so now they're like pivoting maybe away from that.

1053
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,870
Speaker 1:  We'll see. So this brings you into the second higher, right? So you add the

1054
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:48,500
Speaker 1:  CEO of the health care company to bring some rigor and some goals and

1055
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:52,640
Speaker 1:  some direction. Okay. That makes sense. They've also hired yet another

1056
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,090
Speaker 1:  Tesla, executive, the director, the former director of autopilot

1057
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,520
Speaker 1:  to do question marks,

1058
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,500
Speaker 5:  Unrealistic things. Well, I,

1059
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:05,540
Speaker 1:  I don't know the apple car situ I mean, Sorkin did

1060
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:09,350
Speaker 1:  ask cook about this. And there was just more when Tim cook shuts

1061
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:13,010
Speaker 1:  down, man, it is like a robot turn. It's like booboo, booboo. Like he was

1062
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:16,670
Speaker 1:  like, I'm not talking about that. So they they've added yet another

1063
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:20,540
Speaker 1:  car executive to do something. They have spun this program

1064
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,260
Speaker 1:  up. They have spun it down 500 times. We still don't know what's

1065
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,160
Speaker 1:  happening, but they continue to hire car executives specifically ex

1066
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,330
Speaker 1:  Tesla executives. Yeah.

1067
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,830
Speaker 5:  It's all for CarPlay.

1068
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,090
Speaker 5:  You guys think there's a car coming. It's all CarPlay.

1069
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,930
Speaker 2:  The thing Sean talked about earlier about how like electric car people and

1070
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:42,740
Speaker 2:  like just people that are doing high end car software are just bouncing around

1071
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,390
Speaker 2:  between the companies is very real.

1072
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,620
Speaker 1:  What's interesting is you can break the software. There's two big chunks.

1073
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:52,190
Speaker 1:  There's the stuff on the screen in front of you, which is sort of uniformly

1074
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:56,150
Speaker 1:  bad. Then there's the stuff that runs the car, which is not

1075
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,050
Speaker 1:  allowed to be bad. Right. And it at a deeply fundamental

1076
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,890
Speaker 1:  level and they operate in very different. So you need to survive like

1077
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,880
Speaker 1:  yeah, if your car is the body control module of your car

1078
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,510
Speaker 1:  fails, like bad things happen to you and they're on wildly different

1079
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:15,410
Speaker 1:  development timelines. And then there's self-driving, which is

1080
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:19,380
Speaker 1:  supposed to connect a lot of these things, right? You need to tell a where

1081
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,250
Speaker 1:  you want to go. And then the car has to operate another wildly

1082
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,400
Speaker 1:  different development cycle and timeline. One of the most interesting things

1083
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,970
Speaker 1:  about apple, like in terms of the mystery is we have no idea where they want

1084
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:33,780
Speaker 1:  to play. Right? Like for awhile, they were going to build their own car,

1085
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,880
Speaker 1:  which then they were going to build all of it. Then they were just going

1086
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,210
Speaker 1:  to build self-driving for other car makers or a user experience or other

1087
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,910
Speaker 1:  car makers still totally unclear what they want to do.

1088
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:46,560
Speaker 5:  All CarPlay, the best music experience it's coming.

1089
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:50,670
Speaker 1:  That's spatial audio in the car. Oh God. But to

1090
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,300
Speaker 1:  what Sean was mentioning earlier, right. To succeed, you need to have a lot

1091
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,480
Speaker 1:  of money. Apple is kind of at the point where they have so much money

1092
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,810
Speaker 1:  that they can't be like, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna, we're

1093
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,660
Speaker 1:  gonna make a TV, which has something I think they should do. They're like

1094
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,380
Speaker 1:  that doesn't cost enough money. It doesn't move the needle enough.

1095
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:10,590
Speaker 1:  Like they could just buy Samsung.

1096
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,360
Speaker 1:  We now make TVs. And they like, yeah, that was the pocket chain. They

1097
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,720
Speaker 1:  can spend enough money to make a car. And I think part of the reason they

1098
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,470
Speaker 1:  keep chasing after it is it's because it's one of the few places where the,

1099
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,550
Speaker 1:  where like they, they have them. They're one of the few companies that just

1100
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:30,300
Speaker 1:  has the cash balance to do it. Yeah. Yeah. And I think you can

1101
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,570
Speaker 1:  see that as an opportunity. You can also see it as like, man, you, you should

1102
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:37,470
Speaker 1:  decide what you want. Like the apple midsize

1103
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,320
Speaker 1:  crossover is a deeply funny thing to consider

1104
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,060
Speaker 5:  And it costs a hundred thousand dollars. Can't repair.

1105
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:48,240
Speaker 1:  Yeah. With the windshield falls off, you have to call apple. Okay. Lastly,

1106
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,440
Speaker 1:  Becca and Mario made a great video comparing the, the iPhone 13

1107
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,350
Speaker 1:  pro and the pixel six pro the full framed and Becca, I'm not going to tell

1108
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,310
Speaker 1:  like, it is a great video. It's super fun to watch. It is remarkable where

1109
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:02,940
Speaker 1:  these cameras have landed. Yeah. And what they're good and bad at. I'm not

1110
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,030
Speaker 1:  going to tell you their results. You should go watch it. And particularly

1111
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:10,020
Speaker 1:  the Mario segment is very funny because Mario is hilarious, but go watch

1112
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,020
Speaker 1:  it. It's really good. Becca had to take a lot of photos, like literally the

1113
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,240
Speaker 1:  end card of this videos back and being like, I don't know if I can do this

1114
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:15,510
Speaker 1:  again.

1115
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,690
Speaker 2:  2000 photos thousand, each from each camp,

1116
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,480
Speaker 5:  We were talking about report. She doesn't have a dog. She doesn't have a

1117
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,900
Speaker 5:  cat. She doesn't have children. She doesn't have like naturally photogenic

1118
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:28,440
Speaker 5:  things around her. And she went out and took 2000 photos. That's like, that's

1119
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:28,980
Speaker 5:  incredible.

1120
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,850
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Amazing. Okay. One more quick break. We'll be back. Let's wrap this

1121
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:33,840
Speaker 1:  thing up. We'll write back.

1122
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:40,830

1125
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:50,910
Speaker 2:  issues, it's more important than ever to, you know, not procrastinate on

Speaker 2:  have gotten harder and harder because they need to find ways to make people

1144
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:00,160
Speaker 2:  fall in love with their brands time and time. Again, that means finding

1145
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,550
Speaker 2:  creative, new methods of engaging with customers in a personal, conversational

1146
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:07,180
Speaker 2:  and informative way. That's where attentive comes in. Attentive is a

1156
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,780
Speaker 2:  mobile.com/vox, that's attentive,

1157
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,570
Speaker 2:  mobile.com/a V O X

1158
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:52,510
Speaker 2:  we're back. Yeah. As much of Microsoft news. So

1159
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,080
Speaker 2:  they have announced another version of windows.

1160
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,250
Speaker 2:  It's another S version. It's a windows 11 S

1161
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,030
Speaker 2:  E. And if we know anything about se it's that it's a very clearly

1162
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:10,630
Speaker 2:  defined thing, right? Like the iPhone se it is a

1163
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:14,500
Speaker 2:  special edition, I suppose, of windows that's aimed really just at

1164
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,920
Speaker 2:  education. And so it's

1165
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:22,000
Speaker 2:  optimized for low cost devices. It's not going to ship

1166
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:26,020
Speaker 2:  with the Microsoft store, which is interesting, but they are going to

1167
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:29,860
Speaker 2:  allow third party apps, including zoom in Chrome, because

1168
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,730
Speaker 2:  you can't get into schools without zoom and Chrome because that's how they

1169
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,540
Speaker 2:  run schools. And yeah, so it's like,

1170
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,380
Speaker 2:  that's interesting, but it's, you know, it's easy to dunk on

1171
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:44,920
Speaker 2:  Microsoft to keep trying to make lightweight versions of windows, but they

1172
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,700
Speaker 2:  really do need to get into the education market. And this is another

1173
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:52,360
Speaker 2:  shot at it. So fine to me, the more

1174
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,750
Speaker 2:  interesting thing in some ways is alongside

1175
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,260
Speaker 2:  windows 11 se they announced the

1176
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,410
Speaker 2:  $249 surface laptop se

1177
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:06,520
Speaker 5:  Garbage display could be pretty.

1178
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:10,780
Speaker 5:  I haven't seen it. So I don't want to say it's garbage,

1179
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:14,470
Speaker 5:  but, but when your resolution is

1180
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,330
Speaker 5:  13, six by 7 68 in

1181
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:20,420
Speaker 5:  2021, that's not,

1182
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:24,290
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's a classic. That's like a, it's like a mid two

1183
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,190
Speaker 1:  thousands. I book

1184
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,200
Speaker 5:  It's

1185
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:31,190
Speaker 2:  Like it is wild that they can't it's opposite

1186
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:31,970
Speaker 1:  Of pixel density.

1187
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,480
Speaker 5:  It's Microsoft invest in, in displays please.

1188
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:39,650
Speaker 2:  Well, there, there are Chromebooks at this price range that are doing better

1189
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:43,280
Speaker 2:  on the display front, but in terms of making a device, other than the

1190
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,610
Speaker 2:  display, in terms of making a low cost device for schools,

1191
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:50,450
Speaker 2:  they're making it repairable. They're going to have parts it's relatively

1192
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:54,110
Speaker 2:  easy to open, easy to open up. So that's actually incredibly good news.

1193
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:57,980
Speaker 2:  Hopefully the thing is relatively durable. It's a bummer that they're using

1194
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,680
Speaker 2:  an Intel Celeron processor

1195
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,430
Speaker 5:  Bummer. It's four gigabytes of Ram. That's like, that's the

1196
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:05,090
Speaker 5:  real,

1197
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:09,320
Speaker 2:  So here's the thing like can windows 11 se get lightweight

1198
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,950
Speaker 2:  enough where things can actually run well on this processor and this much

1199
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:16,940
Speaker 2:  Ram cause you can get a Chromebook that can like not be the

1200
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,930
Speaker 2:  worst at, at these specs, but more importantly, you can get

1201
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:24,590
Speaker 2:  a Chromebook was slightly better specs for not that much more money.

1202
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,100
Speaker 2:  And I don't know, I don't know what Microsoft's goal here. Do they actually

1203
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,970
Speaker 2:  want to sell this thing in bulk to schools or is there hope that they

1204
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:35,960
Speaker 2:  can prove to the rest of the windows market that they need to try harder

1205
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:40,100
Speaker 2:  at making windows machines to compete with Chromebooks instead of just making

1206
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:40,670
Speaker 2:  Chromebooks?

1207
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:44,840
Speaker 5:  Like it's both, especially like when you look at this, because I used to

1208
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,830
Speaker 5:  have to cover like these really cheap laptops for awhile. And once

1209
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,670
Speaker 5:  you get under $500, you're in garbage territory for windows or

1210
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:55,820
Speaker 5:  you're in like Chromebooks and even the Chromebooks start to get pretty,

1211
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:59,720
Speaker 5:  pretty dicey, but like, there's just nothing in

1212
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,530
Speaker 5:  that space. That's usable as far as windows goes. And it's

1213
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,960
Speaker 5:  always like, I think the recommendation was always like, save your money.

1214
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:09,920
Speaker 5:  Like put yourself in debt before you buy one of these, which is not a good

1215
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,850
Speaker 5:  recommendation and it's not realistic. And the idea that

1216
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:17,510
Speaker 5:  like they're going to attempt it is great. Like the surface go was

1217
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:21,440
Speaker 5:  nice and, and kind of forced everybody else to say, okay, we can

1218
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,440
Speaker 5:  think we can be a little more thoughtful. We can actually do a nice display.

1219
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,670
Speaker 5:  So like, it's nice that they're doing it. And hopefully it forces

1220
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:32,000
Speaker 5:  people. But oof, that display is just,

1221
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,070
Speaker 5:  that's just upsetting.

1222
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,120
Speaker 1:  We've heard a lot about different companies trying to compete with Chromebooks.

1223
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,020
Speaker 1:  Like apple keeps. That's why they make a cheap iPad. You know, if you offer,

1224
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:45,950
Speaker 1:  if you'd said you've got about 250 or $300 to spend, I would take an iPad

1225
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,710
Speaker 1:  over this Chromebook. I think because the iPad has a much nicer display,

1226
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,370
Speaker 1:  but then you'd have to spend a bunch of money in like keyboard cases and

1227
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,640
Speaker 1:  whatever. But the Chromebooks like centrality to the

1228
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,520
Speaker 1:  education market right now is like one of those things we don't talk about

1229
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,060
Speaker 1:  enough. Like every kid just gets like handed a Chromebook in school right

1230
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:06,020
Speaker 1:  now because there's just a handful of Google products. They use to all talk

1231
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,300
Speaker 1:  to each other and like do the work

1232
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:12,650
Speaker 5:  And that they somehow get Hangouts running on those Chromebooks.

1233
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,450
Speaker 1:  Tara Lawrence once had a great story about how kids were flirting in the

1234
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:21,270
Speaker 1:  comments of Google box. Just like very good

1235
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,680
Speaker 1:  it's they can keep trying to make the entry point, but they've got to, once

1236
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,610
Speaker 1:  a school district is bought in, switching them over is really hard. And like

1237
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,460
Speaker 1:  the schools are pretty bought into the Google stuff right now.

1238
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:36,900
Speaker 2:  I mean, this is, this is why they were explicit that windows 11 se can

1239
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,830
Speaker 2:  run Chrome like that. It lets you install it it's

1240
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:44,580
Speaker 2:  administered by the school of like, it's, it's run by like the it department,

1241
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,180
Speaker 2:  like what software is available, it's it, there's no windows store, but like,

1242
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,450
Speaker 1:  It's a, it's a strategy there that like your school gives you this instead

1243
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:55,050
Speaker 1:  of a Chromebook and you like accidentally click on teams and you're like,

1244
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,890
Speaker 1:  Ooh, I love this. This is way better.

1245
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,540
Speaker 1:  We'll see. Speaking of teams, we actually, I think we were talking on this

1246
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,530
Speaker 1:  last week, how Microsoft has all the workplace stuff and Facebook has the

1247
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:10,980
Speaker 1:  hardware. Well, here they are Microsoft partners with Metta to bring

1248
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:14,880
Speaker 1:  teams into Facebook's horizon workplace. Whoo.

1249
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:19,860
Speaker 1:  It's not at first I rewatched

1250
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,580
Speaker 1:  the Microsoft metaverse keynote. Yeah. And the

1251
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:27,220
Speaker 1:  moment when the guy clicks the button to send their

1252
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:31,500
Speaker 1:  legless bodies into the lobby of an Accenture office, I was like, this

1253
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,960
Speaker 1:  isn't well here, Lisa matrix was cool.

1254
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,510
Speaker 1:  At least when Kiana was like woke up and he was in the

1255
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:43,230
Speaker 1:  battery facility and he was like, this is the real world. This sucks.

1256
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,980
Speaker 1:  Like there were some people who were like, put me back in the battery. That's

1257
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,520
Speaker 1:  a plot point in the matrix. It's like, get me back there.

1258
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:54,420
Speaker 1:  No one is like, get me back to me in

1259
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,440
Speaker 2:  Cartoon land,

1260
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:02,520
Speaker 1:  Zero. People are like, I want to go to this Accenture office, but it's

1261
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,000
Speaker 1:  happening. You can see it coming together. And then lastly, this windows

1262
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,550
Speaker 1:  expired certificate, expired certificate stories are always good.

1263
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:12,330
Speaker 2:  So I was like, I actually had a tweet. I was like, it actually makes me feel

1264
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:16,230
Speaker 2:  nice that like giant companies still have expired certificate pro like things

1265
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,170
Speaker 2:  that break their software. Cause like, you know, I forget to go to the dentist.

1266
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:22,770
Speaker 2:  So like even everybody can forget things, but

1267
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,610
Speaker 2:  actually if you just take a step back, it is really stupid that like this

1268
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:30,600
Speaker 2:  basic fundamental thing broke and that Microsoft wasn't on top of

1269
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:34,260
Speaker 2:  it because in windows, many companies have solved this problem of like

1270
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,630
Speaker 2:  remembering to make sure your certificates don't expire.

1271
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,920
Speaker 1:  All right. Want to end with people ask me this. I did not

1272
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,490
Speaker 1:  expect this to be a big deal. It turned into a huge deal. So we

1273
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:47,790
Speaker 1:  updated our background policy, which I'll explain in a second

1274
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:52,080
Speaker 1:  and we didn't put it on the front page. I just tweeted it and it like

1275
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:56,280
Speaker 1:  blew up. And so some people asking you spend five minutes explaining what

1276
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:00,060
Speaker 1:  you mean. And I, it was just, this was a note for PR people and

1277
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,270
Speaker 1:  most of the other reporters. So here's the thing that happens to me all the

1278
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:07,170
Speaker 1:  time. I talked to Dieter, Dieter talks to me, I'm a reporter Dieter. I get

1279
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,720
Speaker 1:  to write down what Dieter said and said, the Dieter said it unskilled on

1280
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,850
Speaker 1:  the record. This is the standard. How it should work all the time. Then if

1281
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:16,810
Speaker 1:  you watched any movie with newspaper people and I, I

1282
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,770
Speaker 1:  love movies, newspaper people. I could watch the post all day, my

1283
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:24,760
Speaker 1:  old Michael Keaton movie, the paper. Very good. Just go check it out. If

1284
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,490
Speaker 1:  you watch any of those movies, you watch any of the Watergate movies. You

1285
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,280
Speaker 1:  know, people are off the record. That means you can't use what they say.

1286
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,470
Speaker 1:  And this is really a fun thing you can do with your friends. He used to be

1287
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:36,340
Speaker 1:  like off the record. I'm like, it doesn't mean you can just say it

1288
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:40,270
Speaker 1:  and it means you can't use it right. Then there's this gray

1289
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:44,200
Speaker 1:  area in the middle where I say, Hey Dieter, can I tell you something on

1290
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,700
Speaker 1:  background heaters? Like maybe

1291
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:46,960
Speaker 2:  Define on

1292
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,590
Speaker 1:  Background.

1293
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:52,780
Speaker 1:  And then I tell him something and he, he can use the information Dieter.

1294
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:56,140
Speaker 1:  I am <inaudible> and he can say

1295
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,650
Speaker 1:  sources say, and he buying T right.

1296
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:03,670
Speaker 2:  Or I can say Neela is buying a Rubian rot, but I don't quote

1297
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,360
Speaker 2:  him, gives me a long, complicated explanation of

1298
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,170
Speaker 2:  why. And then I can paraphrase that explanation and source it to Nila.

1299
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:14,950
Speaker 2:  And so some companies, when they say on background, what they mean is that

1300
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,920
Speaker 2:  we don't want you to tell anybody that we're the ones that told you some

1301
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,890
Speaker 2:  companies do the right thing and say, yeah, we're on background, but you

1302
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:24,730
Speaker 2:  can tell people what we told you, but the definitions are all over the

1303
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:28,300
Speaker 2:  place. And there's a potential

1304
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,260
Speaker 2:  confusion there that can gum up the

1305
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,250
Speaker 2:  works, let's say.

1306
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:37,450
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I, and I would say our responsibility as journalists and

1307
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:41,410
Speaker 1:  reporters is to not, is not for us to know things. It's to

1308
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:45,250
Speaker 1:  tell you what the companies are doing. Right. So when I, when I

1309
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,760
Speaker 1:  just like magically know, I'll just keep picking on Vivian. If I just have

1310
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,330
Speaker 1:  magically know what ravine is doing, you have no idea why I know this

1311
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:56,050
Speaker 1:  information. Even no idea where it came from. And if they have lied to me,

1312
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,140
Speaker 1:  I'm on the hook for it. And they are not,

1313
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:03,130
Speaker 2:  We're only picking on reveal cause they were earlier on the show, not

1314
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:08,860
Speaker 1:  I'm trying to what's the what's the fake Contoso is

1315
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,540
Speaker 1:  that the fake company that Microsoft always uses,

1316
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:11,530
Speaker 2:  I can tell. So yeah,

1317
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:15,280
Speaker 1:  It doesn't matter any company you can think of, they all do it now. So a

1318
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,220
Speaker 1:  thing that has really happened with tech companies in particular is they

1319
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:22,000
Speaker 1:  tell everything to everyone on background. And they just tell you, this is

1320
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,690
Speaker 1:  true, like all the time. And you're like, well,

1321
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,560
Speaker 1:  who said it? Is it real? Is it Y it's you, you were saying like now some

1322
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:33,460
Speaker 1:  background. So we just reset our policy to

1323
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:36,640
Speaker 1:  back where it was like, if you look at the replies to my tweet about this,

1324
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:40,390
Speaker 1:  there's like so many like grizzled old newspaper reporters for like, well,

1325
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:43,720
Speaker 1:  those are, those are always been the rules. Yeah. And it's like, great. I

1326
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,200
Speaker 1:  understand that those are, those are the rules that in 1978, your

1327
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:51,190
Speaker 1:  local paper, when you were like beating down the doors of city hall here

1328
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,940
Speaker 1:  in 2021, the boundaries have actually moved for tech

1329
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:58,090
Speaker 1:  companies and the companies that cover them. And we're just resetting the

1330
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:01,570
Speaker 1:  boundaries to yes. Where they were before, which is

1331
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,600
Speaker 1:  everything's on the record. And if you want to be on background, you have

1332
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,230
Speaker 1:  to ask us and we have to agree. Right. And I will tell you that, like, there's

1333
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:12,170
Speaker 1:  a bunch of stuff. There are a bunch of times when, when Google,

1334
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:15,020
Speaker 1:  actually we had a story yesterday where Netflix, I don't know if you saw

1335
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:18,920
Speaker 1:  this. Netflix is switching to AB one is it's codec. Oh, how did we

1336
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,710
Speaker 1:  not spend the entire Vergecast should is so

1337
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,320
Speaker 1:  right. And so we were like, great. What, what devices are going to use? AB

1338
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,800
Speaker 1:  one. And they sent us the list. The list is hilarious. It's just like

1339
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:34,610
Speaker 1:  select 20, 28 K TVs. And it's like, well, that's got a

1340
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:38,330
Speaker 1:  list of supported devices, select Amazon fire devices.

1341
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:43,100
Speaker 1:  Cool. Anyways, so they sent us this list. We attributed them

1342
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:47,090
Speaker 1:  list to Netflix because all we need to do is tell people

1343
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:50,840
Speaker 1:  where the information is coming from. And now we've satisfied our

1344
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,590
Speaker 1:  responsibility. So we are happy to have this conversation as long as at the

1345
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:58,520
Speaker 1:  end of it, we understand and can clearly communicate

1346
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,300
Speaker 1:  to our readers where the information that we're reporting is coming from.

1347
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:06,140
Speaker 1:  And it's all we want to do is say, here's the default. If you want to change

1348
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:10,130
Speaker 1:  the default, you have to ask us and we will have a conversation. And by the

1349
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:12,860
Speaker 1:  way, ask us like this, ask us.

1350
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:17,360
Speaker 1:  And I just was not expecting it to blow. I mean, I, it was a little salty.

1351
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,600
Speaker 1:  The post is a little salty. Cause I'm a little salty about that. We've been

1352
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,210
Speaker 1:  thinking about this and Dieter theater. I've been talking about this for

1353
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:27,470
Speaker 1:  maybe a year. We've we've been talking about changing the policy for

1354
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:30,890
Speaker 1:  months. And what finally, after all of our tenure stuff, after this last

1355
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:34,520
Speaker 1:  cycle of reviews, our reporters are like, yeah, when are you rolling out

1356
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,480
Speaker 1:  this policy? You've been talking about like, cause I'm,

1357
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:41,840
Speaker 1:  you know, when, when you don't have a policy to point to whenever anybody

1358
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,560
Speaker 1:  wants to push back, like I end up on the phone right there, like my editor

1359
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,230
Speaker 1:  will talk to you. And so then I'm like, but we have this policy, we can't

1360
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:51,530
Speaker 1:  do it. And we keep having the conversation. Now she's like written down.

1361
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:54,260
Speaker 1:  Every can just like tap the sign. You need to start

1362
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:58,610
Speaker 5:  C like counting. See if it drops the number of calls you have

1363
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,930
Speaker 5:  to do expenses on background.

1364
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,920
Speaker 1:  We'll see. But they are the examples. Like, you know, the

1365
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:07,700
Speaker 1:  tech companies that email us their own website, like links to their own websites

1366
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,730
Speaker 1:  and background. It's like guys, like, what does this even mean?

1367
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,540
Speaker 1:  I've asked, are we supposed to read? I'm supposed to not source your own

1368
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,250
Speaker 1:  website now it's wild.

1369
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:20,150
Speaker 5:  What people will just say on background in front of you you'll ask a PR person.

1370
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,750
Speaker 5:  Oh, did you see that movie last night on background? Yes. I wasn't going

1371
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:27,680
Speaker 5:  to report that. You saw a movie it's unrelated to this laptop. We're

1372
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,880
Speaker 5:  discussing. Thank you.

1373
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,230
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So anyway, that's, that's just a little color. It's very inside

1374
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:37,190
Speaker 1:  baseball. All of it is pointed at two things. One, we want to be

1375
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,180
Speaker 1:  transparent and how we work. So now there's an explanation of how we

1376
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:45,020
Speaker 1:  work in how we're thinking about it to this problem is out of control.

1377
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:49,340
Speaker 1:  So we wanted to give cover to other reporters and newsrooms to say they use

1378
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:53,120
Speaker 1:  the same policy as us, which for example, our ethics policy, right?

1379
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:56,870
Speaker 1:  Our ethics policy, we lifted from all things D we lifted from Walt Mossberg

1380
01:19:56,870 --> 01:20:00,590
Speaker 1:  and Kara Swisher. It was a model. They had printed. They were super loud

1381
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:04,340
Speaker 1:  about their ethics policy when we were starting out and we were new, we were

1382
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:07,620
Speaker 1:  like, we're going to use that one. So we hope people, you know, we're 10

1383
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,410
Speaker 1:  years old. We hope people can look at our policy and build on it and use

1384
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:14,370
Speaker 1:  it and refer to it and have it be a little bit of a standard. And third,

1385
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,540
Speaker 1:  most importantly, we just want our readers to know where the information

1386
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:22,200
Speaker 1:  comes from. That's it the way we think that's an important part of our

1387
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,980
Speaker 1:  job. And I have, I've told many PR people, because people will say to

1388
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:29,760
Speaker 1:  me or other reporters, well, you look really smart if you

1389
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,590
Speaker 1:  just know this. No. And I'm like, no, I already looked,

1390
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:37,290
Speaker 1:  I already looked so smart all the time. Like, I don't need your help.

1391
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:40,830
Speaker 1:  Like I just want to tell them where I came from. The other thing I'll connect

1392
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:44,670
Speaker 1:  at all to you is an Daytona. You have been thinking of this as

1393
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:48,360
Speaker 1:  much as I have when people cheer for us because we say disclosure,

1394
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:52,350
Speaker 1:  right? Like, yeah, that's our brand is being transparent. Like

1395
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:56,190
Speaker 1:  we believe in that, like that's who we are. We want you to know

1396
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:59,310
Speaker 1:  like, here's where we're coming from. Here's what we believe. Here's how

1397
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:02,310
Speaker 1:  we do our work. And so we're just always going to hold the line on that.

1398
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:05,760
Speaker 1:  And sometimes like this week, we're gonna do it a little more loudly than

1399
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:09,570
Speaker 1:  the not. And we're a little more publicly than not, but just

1400
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,460
Speaker 1:  trust me. We're kind of always

1401
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:15,810
Speaker 1:  a, it's always in the background. So that's explanation. If you have more

1402
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:18,990
Speaker 1:  questions, you know, we'll do our best to explain ourselves because we believe

1403
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:22,740
Speaker 1:  in transparency. All right. That's it. That's it. That is the show we've

1404
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:26,550
Speaker 1:  gone over. We've gone just a little bit. Thank you for

1405
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:30,450
Speaker 1:  listening. Dieter's got the Tuesday episodes. It's still

1406
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,170
Speaker 1:  still something cool. It's really cool. Really cool

1407
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:37,650
Speaker 1:  subjects. I see. All right. Yeah. That's great. It'd be

1408
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:43,380
Speaker 1:  Dakota. This week was the CEO of anchor, which was actually, yeah.

1409
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:46,350
Speaker 1:  Anchor has a hundred people who just think about Amazon marketplace all day

1410
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:49,830
Speaker 1:  long. It's 3% of the company is incredible. It's 3% of my brain too, but

1411
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,670
Speaker 1:  it's amazing that the hire so many. So Steven Yang from anchor next

1413
