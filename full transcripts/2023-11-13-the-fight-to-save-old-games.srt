10
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:35,765
Speaker 3:  Welcome To, The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Horizontal Scan Lines.

11
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:39,925
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and this is the second episode in our three-part

12
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:43,325
Speaker 3:  miniseries about the future of gaming. And today to talk about the future

13
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:46,325
Speaker 3:  of gaming, we're gonna talk about the past of gaming,

14
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:50,525
Speaker 3:  specifically these decades of video games on old

15
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:54,405
Speaker 3:  consoles and old media systems. Like remember the cartridges you had to blow

16
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:58,325
Speaker 3:  in? What happens to those games as the companies that make them

17
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:02,125
Speaker 3:  disappear and the consoles that they worked on disappear. And the CRT

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,965
Speaker 3:  TV V, you plugged it into disappears. How do we save those games?

19
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:09,925
Speaker 3:  Do we wanna save those games? What does it mean to save those games? That's

20
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:13,005
Speaker 3:  what we're gonna get into today. My colleagues from Polygon, Chris Plant

21
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:16,365
Speaker 3:  and Russ Frushtick are both back with me today To get into all of this,

22
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:20,285
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna consult with them and then go out, try to find some answers and

23
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:22,765
Speaker 3:  then present them with my findings. Let's get into it.

24
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:26,125
Speaker 3:  Russ. Hello. Welcome back.

25
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:26,765
Speaker 4:  Hello,

26
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:28,325
Speaker 3:  Chris. Hello.

27
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:29,365
Speaker 1:  I'm back baby.

28
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,845
Speaker 3:  We're doing this again. I'm excited for our second topic in this

29
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:37,605
Speaker 3:  series. We picked something, I think, if I remember correctly, I brought

30
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:39,965
Speaker 3:  this up when we were talking about what we wanted to cover on this series

31
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:43,205
Speaker 3:  and you immediately were like, David You know Nothing. Let's explain how

32
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:45,765
Speaker 3:  this actually works. Which makes me very excited about this because this

33
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:49,165
Speaker 3:  is a subject I find very interesting and know very little about and I'm excited

34
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:52,165
Speaker 3:  to dig into the weeds of it, which is essentially how

35
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:56,685
Speaker 3:  we adapt and change very old games to be able to play them.

36
00:01:56,945 --> 00:02:00,885
Speaker 3:  Now some of that is old hardware, some of that is you can play old N 64

37
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:04,605
Speaker 3:  games on your phone. There are like people who exist

38
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:08,285
Speaker 3:  in the world to try and preserve these games. I guess it's, it's, would we

39
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:12,245
Speaker 3:  call it emulation and preservation as a topic? Is that a good

40
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:12,845
Speaker 3:  way to look at it?

41
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:17,125
Speaker 4:  I think there are two separate concepts there. Okay. Emulation and

42
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,805
Speaker 4:  preservation are like two obviously related, but there are a lot of people

43
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:23,885
Speaker 4:  that are focused on preservation that aren't using emulation and vice versa.

44
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:27,805
Speaker 4:  But they're both equally important when it comes to preserving the history

45
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:30,085
Speaker 4:  of video games overall.

46
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:33,125
Speaker 3:  Catch me up just really quickly. Again, this is truly a world I know very

47
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,805
Speaker 3:  little about except that it's very popular and it's the kind of thing that

48
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:39,565
Speaker 3:  like a lot of people like to buy an Android phone just to do.

49
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:43,245
Speaker 3:  Like one of the things I hear over and over is people like to buy Android

50
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:45,885
Speaker 3:  phones just to play old video games on them. And I'm like, sure, that's a,

51
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:49,645
Speaker 3:  that's a reason How big a thing is this? Like you guys are in the

52
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:52,565
Speaker 3:  day-to-day of covering games. Like is this kind of emulation world something

53
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:53,765
Speaker 3:  you spend much time thinking about?

54
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:58,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah, honestly, I mean it's not just people just downloading

55
00:02:58,315 --> 00:03:02,205
Speaker 4:  like a rom online to play contra on their pc.

56
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:06,285
Speaker 4:  Nintendo uses emulation on their official switch online. Yeah.

57
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:10,005
Speaker 4:  Service to allow their games to run on modern hardware.

58
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:13,805
Speaker 4:  So everyone is using emulation at that point to play older games.

59
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:18,365
Speaker 4:  But emulation is not perfect when it comes to recreating every

60
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:22,285
Speaker 4:  aspect of how the game originally ran. And some of those aspects are bad.

61
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,925
Speaker 4:  Like the game ran at 10 frames a second when there were 30 bullets on the

62
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:29,845
Speaker 4:  screen. But that is like the true experience that developers

63
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:33,445
Speaker 4:  kind of created when they originally made the game. So a lot of people really

64
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:37,245
Speaker 4:  focused on when recreating those experiences as authentically

65
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:40,005
Speaker 4:  as possible on as many platforms as possible.

66
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:43,405
Speaker 5:  And I, I think that's where Fresh mentioned the difference between emulation

67
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:46,925
Speaker 5:  and preservation. Preservation is trying to

68
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:50,925
Speaker 5:  either recreate that perfectly, which we will get into with things like the

69
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:54,845
Speaker 5:  MR device or system or making it so that you can

70
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:58,325
Speaker 5:  just still play your original hardware. Right? Like

71
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:02,845
Speaker 5:  can you find an old school CRTV and an original Super

72
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:06,805
Speaker 5:  Nintendo and the original game, they all kind of can blend

73
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:10,445
Speaker 5:  together. You know you can get emulation that is close to preservation perfect.

74
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:14,965
Speaker 5:  But it, it gets really nitty gritty really fast. And

75
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:18,965
Speaker 5:  we thought after last week's episode you didn't kick the

76
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:23,125
Speaker 5:  kind of purest nest hard enough so this

77
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,925
Speaker 5:  week you would really go for it and and awakened the the

78
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:27,965
Speaker 5:  beast within. Yeah.

79
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:31,445
Speaker 3:  I'm partly fascinated by this because I think I have always

80
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:35,885
Speaker 3:  struggled with this idea that you should preserve something exactly as it

81
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:39,645
Speaker 3:  was in the time in which it existed, right? Like the idea

82
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:43,405
Speaker 3:  that a video game from 25 years ago deserves to be played on a crappy

83
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:47,085
Speaker 3:  console and a crappy TV that is like only has three channels and rabbit ears

84
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,925
Speaker 3:  is like, I've always had a hard time with that because part of me is like,

85
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,925
Speaker 3:  well at most things are better now, right? It's like we, we don't eat

86
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:57,005
Speaker 3:  like cavemen because we have better diets now because we've figured out how

87
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,565
Speaker 3:  to not die. And a lot of the same stuff is true. I think like this stuff

88
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:04,045
Speaker 3:  gets better and I think a lot of these ideas about how do we preserve what

89
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:07,565
Speaker 3:  these games were sort of in the essence of them so that they don't go away

90
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:11,805
Speaker 3:  separating that from TVs were worse 30 years ago and

91
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:15,165
Speaker 3:  they're better now and maybe that's okay. It has always been hard for me.

92
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,325
Speaker 3:  Even just like emotionally,

93
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:20,765
Speaker 4:  I'm about to blow your mind even further. The problem is all of these games

94
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:24,125
Speaker 4:  and all the art in these games was made for those shitty TVs.

95
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:28,125
Speaker 3:  That is true. I play like the old, old, old versions of some of these

96
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,525
Speaker 3:  games and they just look like crap on new TVs.

97
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:34,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. 'cause they were designed for CT TVs. Like it's really wild. Yeah.

98
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I guess the big question that I have for you is

99
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:42,885
Speaker 5:  the mix of legality and purpose of emulation and

100
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,045
Speaker 5:  preservation. I was

101
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,965
Speaker 3:  Just about to ask am I in for like a, do I have to go talk to a bunch of

102
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:48,645
Speaker 3:  lawyers about the rules around this stuff?

103
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:50,045
Speaker 4:  I think you might. Okay.

104
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:54,365
Speaker 5:  I think you will because yeah, pirating ROMs and playing them

105
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:58,325
Speaker 5:  on your emulated handheld is illegal Like that.

106
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:02,405
Speaker 5:  That's just like a hard, a hard truth of it, right? Whether or not it is

107
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:06,245
Speaker 5:  like morally okay or you personally can justify it or you own

108
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:09,845
Speaker 5:  the game and then that's, you feel that that is comfortable enough.

109
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:14,485
Speaker 5:  That's all I think very valuable. But then when we get to the question of

110
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:18,405
Speaker 5:  preservation, a lot of these companies are not preserving

111
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:22,165
Speaker 5:  their games and either are actively

112
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:26,205
Speaker 5:  or passively creating blockades that would allow

113
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:30,325
Speaker 5:  people to preserve the games for them. So by that I mean why can

114
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:34,725
Speaker 5:  libraries not allow you to emulate video games, right?

115
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:38,445
Speaker 5:  Like that seems fine. That seems like a, a good and reasonable

116
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:42,325
Speaker 5:  thing. You know there are video libraries where you can see

117
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:45,525
Speaker 5:  Broadway plays that were filmed, right? Sure. Like there are libraries that

118
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:49,245
Speaker 5:  allow for things that are legally tricky and you, you make that kind of

119
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:53,245
Speaker 5:  carve out. And I think what is kind of led to this

120
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:57,205
Speaker 5:  emulation boom is publishers being so protective

121
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:01,365
Speaker 5:  of their stuff, so unwilling to make it more

122
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:05,005
Speaker 5:  widely available or their own, I think

123
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:08,885
Speaker 5:  legal murkiness when they look back at their old paperwork, they might not

124
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:12,845
Speaker 5:  even know who owns certain things or they might not even have the original

125
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:16,285
Speaker 5:  source code. So there's just a lot of

126
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:20,405
Speaker 5:  problems that I think are getting in the way of preservation and emulation

127
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:24,605
Speaker 5:  has been able to answer those. We're kind of creating

128
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:25,005
Speaker 5:  its own.

129
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,805
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That's really interesting. Okay, two more things I'm curious about

130
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,965
Speaker 3:  and then I'm gonna, I'm gonna go chase a bunch of people down and see what

131
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:34,565
Speaker 3:  I can figure out. The first thing, Chris you mentioned the mister. I had

132
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,845
Speaker 3:  never heard of the mister until you mentioned it. Tell me about the mister.

133
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:42,565
Speaker 5:  I'm not going to. I said it's your turn to kick

134
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:43,965
Speaker 5:  the Hornet's. That's not my turn.

135
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:45,365
Speaker 3:  Oh crap. Okay.

136
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,525
Speaker 5:  But the basic idea is what if

137
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:52,725
Speaker 5:  you could virtually recreate

138
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:57,285
Speaker 5:  the physical boards that powered video games

139
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:01,485
Speaker 5:  in the past? So you are not creating a, an

140
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:05,205
Speaker 5:  idea, an emulated version of of the Super Nintendo. You are

141
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:09,285
Speaker 5:  digitally recreating the Super Nintendo so it should run

142
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:13,325
Speaker 5:  one for one. I think that's right. I think there's a

143
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:16,365
Speaker 5:  real chance that you play that tape back for him and he is like, I think

144
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:20,165
Speaker 5:  I need to go fire somebody and his name's Chris Plant, but

145
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:24,005
Speaker 5:  it confuses me. I can say that I have one right behind me

146
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,085
Speaker 5:  and it plays Simpson's arcade or whatever really, really well. And that's

147
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:28,525
Speaker 5:  pretty cool.

148
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:31,845
Speaker 3:  That's the dream. And then the other thing is Russ, when we were planning

149
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,445
Speaker 3:  this, you mentioned games that are for one reason or another

150
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:39,165
Speaker 3:  unlikable and, and the challenge that comes with that. What's on your mind

151
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:39,805
Speaker 3:  when you think about that?

152
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:44,365
Speaker 4:  I don't think there's a game that is 100% un emel able.

153
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:48,125
Speaker 4:  Okay. But there are games that are surprisingly resource

154
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,925
Speaker 4:  heavy for when they came out. The example that springs to my mind is

155
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:56,060
Speaker 4:  Yoshi's Island, the original Yoshi's Island which came out on Super Nintendo.

156
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:59,885
Speaker 4:  People use the start menu of Yoshi's Island

157
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:04,285
Speaker 4:  as a benchmark for whether a device can handle an intense

158
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:08,405
Speaker 4:  handheld emulation experience because it uses this

159
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:12,565
Speaker 4:  wild mode seven three D art thing that doesn't

160
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,725
Speaker 4:  exist anywhere else in the game. But like that's an example of something

161
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:19,205
Speaker 4:  that is like, that's what people look at when they're testing like an emulation

162
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:23,165
Speaker 4:  handheld for example. And there are a number of those examples I'm

163
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:27,005
Speaker 4:  sure that pros can point you to, but that was the one that jumped to my

164
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:27,685
Speaker 4:  mind. I'd

165
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:31,325
Speaker 5:  Give two other types of emulation where you are gonna have trouble,

166
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:35,965
Speaker 5:  anything that required specialized physical hardware. So like Warrior Aware,

167
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:40,205
Speaker 5:  twisted I think Sure. Had a special cartridge. I'm curious about how

168
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,245
Speaker 5:  people emulate things like that and they preserve those things.

169
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:44,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We games for example.

170
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:49,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And also online games as we get more and

171
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:52,565
Speaker 5:  more to You know always online video games.

172
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:57,245
Speaker 5:  Fortnite, like what does it mean to emulate or preserve

173
00:09:57,485 --> 00:10:00,965
Speaker 5:  Fortnite in its mini manifestations, right?

174
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:05,565
Speaker 5:  Because Fortnite today is, might as well be Fortnite 12, right? It is

175
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:08,845
Speaker 5:  not the same game that came out or was even out a year ago

176
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:11,245
Speaker 5:  and I, I don't know, I don't know the answer there.

177
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:14,925
Speaker 3:  Okay. Yeah. So I think I, I need to go figure out basically what does it

178
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:18,605
Speaker 3:  look like to preserve this stuff? Is it allowed?

179
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:22,805
Speaker 3:  And, and, and then like how are we as people supposed to interact with it,

180
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,045
Speaker 3:  right? Because I think there's a version of this that it's like, it's cool

181
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:28,565
Speaker 3:  that this stuff exists for sort of purely archival purposes, right? Like

182
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:32,685
Speaker 3:  put Fortnite 1.0 in a museum. It's cool that we can see what that looked

183
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,325
Speaker 3:  like at the time. That's one version of it. But there's also a version of

184
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:38,685
Speaker 3:  it that it's like, what if we as people who like to play games had access

185
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:42,805
Speaker 3:  to every game that has ever existed in something like the form in which it

186
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:46,605
Speaker 3:  was intended to be consumed. That's very cool and very exciting and

187
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:49,405
Speaker 3:  super, super complicated for a thousand reasons So I. Think I'm gonna, I'm

188
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:52,445
Speaker 3:  gonna run both of those things down and see what I can come back with. Does

189
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:52,925
Speaker 3:  that sound good?

190
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:53,765
Speaker 4:  Rock and roll.

191
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:54,525
Speaker 5:  I love it.

192
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:57,965
Speaker 3:  All, right? We're gonna take a break. I'm gonna go explore a bunch of stuff.

Speaker 3:  All, right, Welcome back. It's been a few weeks. I've gone all the way across

209
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:11,135
Speaker 3:  the country. We're recording these. I've discovered where I'm in a different

210
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,975
Speaker 3:  place every single time we record. This is like a fun game. We're playing

211
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:17,255
Speaker 3:  for an audio podcast that no one will get anything out of. How are your lives?

212
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:19,175
Speaker 3:  Tell me everything. What have you been up to?

213
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,935
Speaker 5:  It's been such a, a thrilling time. Fresh. Actually

214
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:26,975
Speaker 5:  solved a cold case 30 years in the making. Wow. Huge. Yeah,

215
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:30,775
Speaker 4:  It turns out it was me the whole time. I just didn't want to admit it. So

216
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:32,655
Speaker 4:  it was actually a pretty easy case to

217
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:36,335
Speaker 3:  Solve. It's open and shut when you get to it. Well, okay, emulation and preservation.

218
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:40,495
Speaker 3:  This turned into kind of a, a strange like philosophical rabbit

219
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:44,015
Speaker 3:  hole for me of talking to folks about what it means to keep

220
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:48,335
Speaker 3:  video games around And. what we did last time was I had sort

221
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:51,295
Speaker 3:  of five pieces of evidence for a theory that I developed in the course of

222
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:54,255
Speaker 3:  talking to people. And we talked about why handheld gaming is the future.

223
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:58,415
Speaker 3:  This time I have come to you with, I would say, five ideas about how we can

224
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:02,215
Speaker 3:  make game emulation and preservation work for everybody.

225
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:03,255
Speaker 5:  Okay. Some

226
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:05,615
Speaker 3:  Of these I think are very good ideas. Some of these I think are very bad

227
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:09,335
Speaker 3:  impossible ideas, but they are ideas that I have heard from people over and

228
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:13,255
Speaker 3:  over. So I'm gonna throw them all at you and we're just gonna, we're

229
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:16,335
Speaker 3:  gonna litigate what happens to old games. How does that sound? I love it.

230
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:20,695
Speaker 5:  Why am I afraid that we're, you're gonna throw five very good ideas

231
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:24,615
Speaker 5:  at us and all of them are going to end with unfortunately that

232
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:28,615
Speaker 5:  requires legal changes and there will never

233
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,695
Speaker 5:  be any movement on this for at least 10 years.

234
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:34,855
Speaker 3:  I have really great news for you. Idea number two is change all the laws.

235
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:36,615
Speaker 3:  So we're getting great at that. Cool, cool,

236
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:38,415
Speaker 5:  Cool, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Covered.

237
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:41,255
Speaker 3:  We talked a little bit about the UpTop, but I just to like reset the scene

238
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,775
Speaker 3:  here a bit question I found myself asking everybody is basically like why

239
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:48,895
Speaker 3:  do we wanna preserve old games? And I got a lot of good answers from

240
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:52,615
Speaker 3:  smart people, but I just have a couple that I want to play for you right

241
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:56,535
Speaker 3:  now. One thing a couple of people told me was that they compared the

242
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,855
Speaker 3:  video game industry now to like the early days of the film industry, which

243
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:02,615
Speaker 3:  I think is a fairly common thing in, in this space. It's a, it's a useful

244
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:06,615
Speaker 3:  metaphor for how we think about how long things live and the formats of them.

245
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:10,055
Speaker 3:  And a thing that people told me that I had not realized but is very true

246
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,615
Speaker 3:  is there's a huge amount of stuff from like the twenties and thirties in

247
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:17,535
Speaker 3:  Hollywood that is just gone like fully gone, does not exist. No one will

248
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:20,095
Speaker 3:  ever see it again because it was made once it was put on one thing, it was

249
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:22,855
Speaker 3:  shown in theaters because that was the only way to watch movies and then

250
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:26,135
Speaker 3:  it just died and those things are gone and there's this real sadness in that

251
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,215
Speaker 3:  industry about how we lost what turned out to be these crucial

252
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:33,815
Speaker 3:  parts of film history. But at that time it wasn't history, it was just like

253
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:37,335
Speaker 3:  this weird lark that people were doing. So there was no feeling that this

254
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,895
Speaker 3:  is a thing we need to preserve. And there are a lot of people who feel like

255
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:45,295
Speaker 3:  the early days of the video game industry in particular has really

256
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,855
Speaker 3:  run into that. One of the people I talked to for this was a guy named Frank

257
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,090
Speaker 3:  Safadi who I'm sure you guys know, he runs the video game history foundation

258
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:56,125
Speaker 3:  and he told me a bunch about the idea of the old film industry and and he

259
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,365
Speaker 3:  made that same comparison but he did this really great thing where he was

260
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,765
Speaker 3:  like, let me explain to you what it's like to have a video game right now.

261
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:05,565
Speaker 3:  And I just really enjoyed the way he explained it. So lemme just play this

262
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:06,045
Speaker 3:  for you real fast.

263
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:10,565
Speaker 8:  We often compare it to like if movies were only released on

264
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:13,765
Speaker 8:  like VHS ever and you wanna watch

265
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:18,325
Speaker 8:  back to the Future All, right? Well you have to go on eBay and you have

266
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:21,965
Speaker 8:  to like find an antique VHS copy that's

267
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:25,525
Speaker 8:  degraded a little bit from use of Back to the Future. You have to find

268
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:29,485
Speaker 8:  AVCR that works a TV that it plugs into

269
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,405
Speaker 8:  or you have to like find the external scalers that make it look

270
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:37,005
Speaker 8:  correct on your modern tv. You might need a time-based

271
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:41,005
Speaker 8:  corrector 'cause and those are really expensive because the the

272
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:44,965
Speaker 8:  magnetic fluxx signal is like out of sync or whatever, You know what I mean?

273
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:48,845
Speaker 8:  Like that, that's where video games are in in the

274
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,125
Speaker 8:  legal world. That's literally the same thing.

275
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:54,885
Speaker 3:  I love this explanation and it makes it seem like a mess. Does this feel

276
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,725
Speaker 3:  right to you? Like does his way of thinking about it track?

277
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah, so in other words what he's saying is because games are

278
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:04,765
Speaker 4:  specifically designed for very specific hardware, in order

279
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:09,005
Speaker 4:  to experience them now the way they were intended, you

280
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:12,765
Speaker 4:  need to have the hardware itself. So in his example you need AVHS

281
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:16,605
Speaker 4:  player to play A-V-V-H-S tape and that's the case with so many

282
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:20,565
Speaker 4:  games, which I think is fair, especially for the games from like the

283
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:25,045
Speaker 4:  eighties, nineties. Absolutely I think it's gotten a little better but

284
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:26,565
Speaker 4:  it's still definitely true.

285
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:31,125
Speaker 5:  I think there's another way of kind of hearing what Frank said that I had

286
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:35,045
Speaker 5:  not considered, which is with an original movie you

287
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:38,965
Speaker 5:  would have the original elements like the actual film that you shot right

288
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:42,245
Speaker 5:  before it then gets like transferred over and over and over again.

289
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:45,965
Speaker 5:  And the comparison to AVHS tape is really interesting because

290
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:50,685
Speaker 5:  we don't have the source code for so, so many

291
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:54,645
Speaker 5:  games. The original code of most games is lost

292
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:58,325
Speaker 5:  even very big games. And with the

293
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:02,325
Speaker 5:  VHS tape I, there's a way of hearing that as we are not even

294
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,485
Speaker 5:  getting the best version of it. We're just getting a version of like how

295
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:09,205
Speaker 5:  they could print it at the time. I think that that gets into like

296
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:13,085
Speaker 5:  real nitty gritty of preservation. Are you the person who thinks that a game

297
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:16,725
Speaker 5:  should be experienced? Exactly. Was it experienced in 1996

298
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:20,205
Speaker 5:  for You know Nintendo six super or whatever Or do you think it should be

299
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,165
Speaker 5:  experienced like literally the code that they wrote? And yeah, I had never

300
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:27,705
Speaker 5:  considered it like that. If you think about it as the latter, I mean

301
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:31,865
Speaker 5:  wow that would be, that actually really messes with preservation because

302
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:36,065
Speaker 5:  it, I can think of very, very, very few games where the

303
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:37,105
Speaker 5:  code of a game is available.

304
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:40,585
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So okay you, you just brought up a thing I was gonna get to later but

305
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:44,505
Speaker 3:  let's just talk about this now. The single most controversial thing

306
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:47,745
Speaker 3:  I talked about with all the people I talked about for this was this question

307
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:51,565
Speaker 3:  of is the right way to preserve a video game to

308
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:55,685
Speaker 3:  preserve it exactly as it was and exactly as it felt and like

309
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:59,605
Speaker 3:  the most true to the experience at the time. Like should the way you

310
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:03,525
Speaker 3:  play a game from the 1980s be on a 1980s TV in like a

311
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:07,485
Speaker 3:  shag carpet living room with fluorescent lights everywhere? Like

312
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:11,485
Speaker 3:  should it be as close to what it was when it came out as possible? Or

313
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,765
Speaker 3:  are there ways we can like modernize and improve these things? And

314
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:19,925
Speaker 3:  a lot of people use the word artist's intent, right? Like to what extent

315
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:23,085
Speaker 3:  can we infer what they wanted to do and were technically constrained from

316
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:26,885
Speaker 3:  being able to do versus what was it at the time and

317
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:30,885
Speaker 3:  which of those is actual correct preservation? And I have a bunch

318
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,405
Speaker 3:  of, I have a bunch of theories and some answers that I got that I'm gonna

319
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,085
Speaker 3:  play for you guys, but I wanna know what you guys think about this 'cause

320
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,565
Speaker 3:  I suspect this is a debate that's happening all over the gaming industry

321
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,125
Speaker 3:  all the time.

322
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:43,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think there are people that only see what

323
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:46,885
Speaker 4:  you were describing early on the experience. You have to have an eighties

324
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:50,925
Speaker 4:  TV and you have to be running on original NES hardware and I

325
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:54,805
Speaker 4:  think there are definitely people that consider that to be really the only

326
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:58,245
Speaker 4:  way you can experience an NES game from that era properly.

327
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:02,645
Speaker 4:  I think the fear is that if you view that as

328
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:06,165
Speaker 4:  video game preservation, it really puts a box

329
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:10,285
Speaker 4:  around the number of people that can then experience the thing

330
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:14,285
Speaker 4:  moving into the future because so many people are not gonna have that hardware,

331
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:17,645
Speaker 4:  not gonna have that setup. So by gatekeeping it and saying that's the only

332
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:21,525
Speaker 4:  way to do it, I think that will limit really You know. I think

333
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:24,805
Speaker 4:  the one thing we can be sure of in terms of artist intent about video games

334
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:28,765
Speaker 4:  from that time and even now is people who make games want

335
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:32,445
Speaker 4:  people to play them and as many people as possible to play them

336
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:36,005
Speaker 4:  because they spent all their time and energy and soul into this thing.

337
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:40,285
Speaker 4:  So if the pixels don't look quite right, even though that's not ideal,

338
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:44,365
Speaker 4:  I think they would probably still rather people are playing them than not.

339
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:48,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I, I mean why not? Both is kind of my approach

340
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:52,365
Speaker 5:  I think of film preservation 'cause it is a really useful comparison

341
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:56,085
Speaker 5:  here. Most film preservation these days is like

342
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,045
Speaker 5:  eight K, 12 k even restoration of

343
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:03,805
Speaker 5:  if they can find them original elements, right? And then they go in and they

344
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:07,445
Speaker 5:  can digitize that and they can You know actually like clean up the image

345
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:10,005
Speaker 5:  and try to get the color closer to what it would've actually looked like

346
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:13,925
Speaker 5:  and use AI tools to get rid of damage to the film

347
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:17,845
Speaker 5:  and, and various things like that. I think that like for most people

348
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:21,605
Speaker 5:  that is the right answer because again, it does give you an experience

349
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:25,765
Speaker 5:  weirdly closer to what it was like to watch back in the day or

350
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:29,365
Speaker 5:  again the artist's intent. That said, there's a YouTube

351
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:33,685
Speaker 5:  channel that I follow from a person who uses AGIY

352
00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:38,205
Speaker 5:  tool that captures old film trailers, like actually off

353
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:42,085
Speaker 5:  of 35 millimeter film. Oh wow. And those You know

354
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:45,805
Speaker 5:  they're not putting any extra work into the preservation. It it is

355
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,445
Speaker 5:  as it was after degrading for however many decades and everything else.

356
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:53,325
Speaker 5:  And for certain movies that's like a very appealing thing. I think there

357
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:57,125
Speaker 5:  are a lot of people who like Star Wars because they saw Star Wars prints

358
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,925
Speaker 5:  that had been screening for decades by the time it got around to them as

359
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:04,805
Speaker 5:  a kid in the eighties, right? And that's their idea of Star Wars So

360
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:08,605
Speaker 5:  I think when you can have both with games. I think that is yes, having

361
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:12,845
Speaker 5:  the original s and s experience and then having one

362
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:16,685
Speaker 5:  that works on your emulator, having a Nintendo 64 and now having one that

363
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,645
Speaker 5:  up Perez's to four K on your emulator. I think those are both good.

364
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:24,965
Speaker 5:  I also think that there is a middle ground in Mister and I have a feeling

365
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:28,005
Speaker 5:  that we'll talk about mister a lot more and hopefully people can explain

366
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:31,645
Speaker 5:  it way better than I can. But when you are able to kind of

367
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:35,165
Speaker 5:  recreate the original hardware in digital form,

368
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:39,885
Speaker 5:  I think that allows for what I, I suspect a lot of people will

369
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:43,365
Speaker 5:  say, which is some of these NES games in these

370
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:47,325
Speaker 5:  classic retro games, you actually, they don't really work on

371
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:50,685
Speaker 5:  modern screens. Like you, you actually need the the kind of like

372
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:54,285
Speaker 5:  jumpiness of the frames and other things to experience them

373
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:57,365
Speaker 5:  appropriately. And that is something that can be created with a tool like

374
00:21:57,365 --> 00:22:01,125
Speaker 5:  Mr. But I'm excited to hear more because it, it sounds like

375
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,325
Speaker 5:  you've, like you've spoken to all the right people.

376
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:07,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I think the, the place that I've landed I think is it's kind of about

377
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:10,645
Speaker 3:  how you think about the goal of preserving these games, right? Like I think

378
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:13,565
Speaker 3:  there's a divide I've come to think about where it's like, and this actually

379
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,325
Speaker 3:  informs a lot of what we're about to talk about, where one way of thinking

380
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:20,085
Speaker 3:  about what we do with video games is, is like as sort of historical artifacts,

381
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:23,365
Speaker 3:  right? And that's where the goal is to understand them

382
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:27,685
Speaker 3:  as they were when they were around, right? And I think like

383
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:30,285
Speaker 3:  one of the things Frank talked a lot about when he and I talked was this

384
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:34,045
Speaker 3:  idea that one of the things the video game History Foundation does is context,

385
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:37,605
Speaker 3:  right? Like they have this big idea of you can't understand a video game

386
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:40,725
Speaker 3:  without understanding the world around the video game. So not only do we

387
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:44,325
Speaker 3:  have to preserve the game as accurately as we can,

388
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:48,685
Speaker 3:  we also have to like bring in these other things around it.

389
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:51,725
Speaker 3:  Whether it's commercials or like things going on in the world or other games

390
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:55,045
Speaker 3:  that were before and after to help you understand what this game meant in

391
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:57,845
Speaker 3:  the world. So there's a version of it that I think, I think you're right

392
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:01,805
Speaker 3:  Chris, that is like, this should be as perfectly preserved as possible

393
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:05,405
Speaker 3:  for that particular use because you should understand it as a thing in space

394
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:09,085
Speaker 3:  and time there. But then the other half of it is like, what if you want people

395
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:12,125
Speaker 3:  to play these games and this, this is where I really come to kind of Russ

396
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,845
Speaker 3:  your way of thinking about this. Like these games can be better now

397
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:20,245
Speaker 3:  and in so many ways. Like one of the things Frank was talking

398
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:22,925
Speaker 3:  about was there was this little thing actually You know what, let me just

399
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:25,965
Speaker 3:  play it. He gave me this whole really funny speech about the NES and blinking

400
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:28,285
Speaker 3:  lights. Let me just tell you about the, the blinking lights.

401
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:31,765
Speaker 8:  I, I think preserving that experience often

402
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:36,405
Speaker 8:  requires You know, just fixing up little things. You know really,

403
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:40,245
Speaker 8:  really easy example is the, the NES, the eight bit N-E-S-I-I worked

404
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:43,285
Speaker 8:  on a few collections that that had NES games in them. And

405
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:48,005
Speaker 8:  one thing that was an absolute no-brainer for us was

406
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:51,965
Speaker 8:  the NES has a limitation on how many

407
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:55,845
Speaker 8:  sprites like moving objects can be on one

408
00:23:56,215 --> 00:24:00,125
Speaker 8:  horizontal line. And if you go over I think the number eight, there's

409
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:04,045
Speaker 8:  more than eight objects on one line, they start flickering

410
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:08,125
Speaker 8:  because the NES can't render that ninth object, right?

411
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:12,605
Speaker 8:  So what it does is in hardware, it just kind of turns one off and You

412
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:16,365
Speaker 8:  know like it alternates turning them off at that point. And so a really

413
00:24:16,365 --> 00:24:20,325
Speaker 8:  no-brainer thing that we do is like no one wants this is we we up

414
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:24,125
Speaker 8:  that limit to, I mean it might be infinite, I don't know, but we up the limit.

415
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:27,445
Speaker 8:  So we're we allow more than eight sprites on a scan line and all that does

416
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,925
Speaker 8:  is eliminate flicker. And it's like did artists

417
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:35,565
Speaker 8:  maybe sometimes intend for there to be flicker on this

418
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:39,445
Speaker 8:  part? You know theoretically, but I think for the most

419
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,605
Speaker 8:  part artistic intent was like, did this look good?

420
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:46,925
Speaker 8:  You know and we don't have to be slaves to this hardware anymore.

421
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:51,325
Speaker 4:  That is a great example quite honestly. Like he's right. It's so

422
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:55,245
Speaker 4:  rare to think of a scenario where an artist or a game developer wanted that

423
00:24:55,665 --> 00:24:59,365
Speaker 4:  to be flickering but they just had to 'cause that was the only way to pull

424
00:24:59,365 --> 00:24:59,925
Speaker 4:  off the game.

425
00:25:00,235 --> 00:25:03,285
Speaker 3:  Yeah, the this idea of like artist's intent I think is always sort of tricky,

426
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:07,085
Speaker 3:  right? Because it's like how do you guess what somebody was thinking

427
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,605
Speaker 3:  about when they built these things versus what was just like a technical

428
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:12,965
Speaker 3:  limitation versus like art comes from constraints You know what I mean? So

429
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:16,645
Speaker 3:  I think it can get tricky. But things like that seem to me to be not all

430
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:19,325
Speaker 3:  that controversial. I suspect there are people out there who will think that

431
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:23,085
Speaker 3:  is like bastardizing what this game was. I increasingly don't buy that

432
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:23,485
Speaker 3:  argument.

433
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:27,965
Speaker 4:  I think where it gets interesting and tricky is when you

434
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:31,205
Speaker 4:  talk about where that line is, right? Because there you can certainly go

435
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:35,165
Speaker 4:  past that line and start making changes that arguably make a game

436
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:38,885
Speaker 4:  look dramatically better but are pretty far afield

437
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:42,565
Speaker 4:  from what the original source material was. An example that jumps to my mind

438
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:46,565
Speaker 4:  just recently, a collection of metal gear solid games was released

439
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:50,365
Speaker 4:  and it's every metal gear solid game, basically one through three and the

440
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:54,085
Speaker 4:  original NES metal gear solid games and the original metal gear solid came

441
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,885
Speaker 4:  out on the PlayStation one and in this collection the game runs

442
00:25:57,905 --> 00:26:01,805
Speaker 4:  at two 40 p. And if you push out a two 40 P

443
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:05,685
Speaker 4:  image to a four K screen, holy cow, that looks like

444
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:10,285
Speaker 4:  jaggy and messy and not the prettiest look. Yep. But

445
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:14,605
Speaker 4:  emulators and, and people that work in emulators have figured

446
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:18,445
Speaker 4:  out ways to upscale an image from a two

447
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:22,365
Speaker 4:  40 P image to look actually quite clean and quite

448
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:26,325
Speaker 4:  good on a four K image. But it looks dramatically

449
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,725
Speaker 4:  different from what it looked like when you were playing it on a PlayStation.

450
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:32,845
Speaker 4:  And is that a bridge too far or do we just like that people

451
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:35,045
Speaker 4:  have the option to do that? That's where it gets tricky.

452
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:38,485
Speaker 3:  I tend to increasingly think that is not a bridge too far. I really like,

453
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:41,485
Speaker 3:  so this is, this is ultimately like theory number one of how to make this

454
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:45,325
Speaker 3:  stuff work is is make the games better. Make them work the way

455
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:48,125
Speaker 3:  that they would if you were building them now. Which is obviously there's

456
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,725
Speaker 3:  a lot of like interpretation and complicated stuff in there and I think reasonable

457
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:54,285
Speaker 3:  people can disagree on whether that's the goal. And Chris, I think that is

458
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:57,445
Speaker 3:  not exclusive of the idea of we should also preserve these things as cultural

459
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:01,005
Speaker 3:  artifacts. Right? But I think that's not gonna be a big reason

460
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:04,605
Speaker 3:  for folks to do this. Right. And I think one of the things that I've heard

461
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:08,365
Speaker 3:  a bunch in talking to people is that the problem with emulation,

462
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:12,005
Speaker 3:  and I suppose to some extent this brings me to idea number two about how

463
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,525
Speaker 3:  to make emulation and preservation more successful is that it's not a very

464
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:17,725
Speaker 3:  good business. One of the things people have said to me that I thought was

465
00:27:17,725 --> 00:27:21,645
Speaker 3:  surprising was that if your Nintendo or Sony

466
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:25,325
Speaker 3:  or anyone else who has been like making games for a very long time, everybody

467
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:27,965
Speaker 3:  brings up Nintendo just 'cause it's sort of the best example of like they've

468
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:31,605
Speaker 3:  had a million different consoles over a million years and figuring out what

469
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:35,165
Speaker 3:  to do with those things over time. Nintendo kind of has that challenge more

470
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:38,285
Speaker 3:  neatly than anybody. So everybody talks about Nintendo when you ask about

471
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:41,845
Speaker 3:  this. They also just have the longest history of great games that people

472
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:45,285
Speaker 3:  love. But if you're a Nintendo, I always sort of thought there was just like

473
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:49,325
Speaker 3:  a database of games sitting somewhere and you just like click eight

474
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:52,845
Speaker 3:  buttons and it becomes available again. And I have been aggressively

475
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:56,925
Speaker 3:  disused of that idea that actually it is more work than people

476
00:27:56,955 --> 00:28:00,845
Speaker 3:  give it credit for to make that stuff available. And if

477
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,885
Speaker 3:  you're a Nintendo, you can probably resell some of those games and that's

478
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:07,285
Speaker 3:  cool and exciting. But the case a couple of people made to me that I can't

479
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,565
Speaker 3:  stop thinking about is that if you're Nintendo or any other game maker, you

480
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:14,405
Speaker 3:  can spend your finite resources and energy bringing these old games

481
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:18,045
Speaker 3:  forward, which will sell to some people. There's a cool nostalgia factor

482
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:21,125
Speaker 3:  you can, you can help some people encounter new kinds of games

483
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:25,445
Speaker 3:  or you can spend that time and money and energy

484
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,205
Speaker 3:  building new stuff that is going to make you lots of money and sell more

485
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:32,205
Speaker 3:  consoles and be good for your bottom line over time. I

486
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:35,445
Speaker 5:  Would clarify a little bit on that I think. Okay. Which is,

487
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:40,005
Speaker 5:  it is very, very easy for Nintendo

488
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:43,845
Speaker 5:  or anybody else to take a bunch of ROMs, put them into an emulator

489
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:47,365
Speaker 5:  and put it on the switch. That itself is very, very easy.

490
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:51,525
Speaker 5:  What would be difficult is the paperwork.

491
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:52,005
Speaker 3:  Yes.

492
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:56,045
Speaker 5:  Which that is not for me to say that, that that is an excuse. I think

493
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:59,645
Speaker 5:  that's actually very legitimate. Especially I think a lot of people

494
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:03,765
Speaker 5:  believe that developers should be paid for their

495
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,925
Speaker 5:  creations. Right? And a lot of these games were made before

496
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:11,885
Speaker 5:  people could even conceptualize something like this sort of em emulation

497
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:15,765
Speaker 5:  or a game that's being widely available like this and digging up

498
00:29:16,385 --> 00:29:20,325
Speaker 5:  who even owns some of these games. I mean I think I've, I'm curious if

499
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,885
Speaker 5:  people talk about this on in any of your interviews, but I think listeners

500
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:27,485
Speaker 5:  would be shocked how many popular games nobody

501
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:31,645
Speaker 5:  knows who owns them. Yep. Or knows where the

502
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:35,205
Speaker 5:  original code is. They have been over the years,

503
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:39,485
Speaker 5:  caught in so many various mergers or acquisitions that that

504
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:43,005
Speaker 5:  paperwork is gone. And if you've ever wondered why your favorite game is

505
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:46,965
Speaker 5:  just never made available on the Nintendo Switch, often the

506
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:50,885
Speaker 5:  answer isn't somebody's punishing you. It's that they would love to, but

507
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:54,685
Speaker 5:  like you said, it's really hard to figure out how or if

508
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:58,165
Speaker 5:  it's even possible so people just don't.

509
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:02,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I would also add to your point about kind of triaging

510
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:06,325
Speaker 4:  where your priorities should lie. You're right. It's, it is more time

511
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:09,365
Speaker 4:  that you would spend bringing these older games that a lot of people wouldn't

512
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:12,405
Speaker 4:  play. The amount of time required is

513
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,645
Speaker 4:  so small compared to the amount of time required to make a brand new from

514
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:20,445
Speaker 4:  scratch game. Given the fact that at least for the first party games

515
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:24,085
Speaker 4:  that they have access to, like they don't have to worry about that paperwork,

516
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:27,685
Speaker 4:  they own all this stuff, right? Already. I mean that's really what they've

517
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:31,165
Speaker 4:  done with the Nintendo Switch online subscription model is like those are

518
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:35,005
Speaker 4:  all running through emulators that emulate an N 64 GBA or

519
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:39,405
Speaker 4:  whatever and they kind of pumped them through. And

520
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:43,365
Speaker 4:  Nintendo has some stipulations about like, we want it to

521
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:46,485
Speaker 4:  look pretty close to the original hardware, but they've also released ports

522
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:50,445
Speaker 4:  that are like pretty rough on there. Pretty not well emulated.

523
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,685
Speaker 4:  I think the original version of Oh, green of Time look pretty

524
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:58,525
Speaker 4:  rough on the Nintendo Switch online version. So I

525
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,445
Speaker 4:  think they're still doing it and I don't think it's that hard for them to

526
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:04,925
Speaker 4:  do it. And it hasn't, certainly hasn't prevented them from making new stuff

527
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:08,165
Speaker 4:  as well. And I think you're seeing a lot of companies

528
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:12,805
Speaker 4:  like Microsoft as well and, and Sony doing this with their

529
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:16,765
Speaker 4:  back catalogs because they have the access to that back catalogs and

530
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:20,045
Speaker 4:  they own the games already, so might as well, like, it just adds more value

531
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:21,965
Speaker 4:  and more incentive for people to buy the hardware.

532
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:26,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah, no, I think that's right and I think over time that's a victory, right?

533
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:28,965
Speaker 3:  Because it's like, it is a, it is a small but predictable business for those

534
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:33,165
Speaker 3:  companies and they can kind of add to it over time. But like, I mean we

535
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:36,245
Speaker 3:  talk about like the the weird incentives of like venture capital all the

536
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:40,045
Speaker 3:  time on the show, right? And one of the things that it does is say like,

537
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:43,205
Speaker 3:  old games are like a lifestyle business, right? Like it's a, it's a nice

538
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:47,045
Speaker 3:  thing, it's predictable. There are people who will like it. There is no earth

539
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:50,565
Speaker 3:  shattering gigantic business in that, right? And the, the incentives

540
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:54,845
Speaker 3:  in the other direction are like, if you can go out and stumble

541
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,765
Speaker 3:  into being the next Fortnite or Call of Duty or Roblox or

542
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:02,925
Speaker 3:  whatever you wanna be, that's so much sexier that I think especially

543
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:06,005
Speaker 3:  if you are in a position of having to like make hard decisions, it's just

544
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:09,645
Speaker 3:  so tempting to go that direction even though the

545
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:13,965
Speaker 3:  audience and ability to do that older stuff is there. And my hope is that

546
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,485
Speaker 3:  calculus like shifts more over time as, especially as a lot of these companies

547
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:21,405
Speaker 3:  try to like, make smarter decisions about how they make games because

548
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:24,845
Speaker 3:  this business has gotten so chaotic. But I don't know, a lot of the folks

549
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:28,605
Speaker 3:  I talk to are not crazy optimistic about that happening. But I I sincerely

550
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:28,965
Speaker 3:  hope it does.

551
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:33,445
Speaker 5:  I I think we're all on the same page. I, and I think the where the

552
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:37,405
Speaker 5:  sexiness of this, if there ever was or is or will

553
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:40,645
Speaker 5:  be one, is the streaming services is subscription services

554
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:45,005
Speaker 5:  because it is a number that you can add to the list of how many

555
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:48,605
Speaker 5:  games are on your platform. Yep. If you can easily go from a platform that

556
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:52,485
Speaker 5:  has a hundred games to 600 games, that is appealing

557
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:56,525
Speaker 5:  even if it is disingenuous maybe. But I agree

558
00:32:56,625 --> 00:33:00,325
Speaker 5:  and I I think Sony said as much when they were asked about backwards

559
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:04,205
Speaker 5:  compatibility versus Microsoft You know. Like it does not behoove

560
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:07,845
Speaker 5:  us to spend all of our resources on a thing that we have

561
00:33:07,975 --> 00:33:11,725
Speaker 5:  tried to appease fans with time and time again. And, and we do not see a

562
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:12,445
Speaker 5:  big payoff for

563
00:33:12,935 --> 00:33:15,765
Speaker 3:  Chris. You just brought up the thing I am perhaps most excited to talk about

564
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:19,565
Speaker 3:  in all of this, which is what I would call Spotify for video games

565
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:23,885
Speaker 3:  before we get into the Spotify for video games thing. There is, I do wanna

566
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:27,565
Speaker 3:  go back to the thing Chris, you were saying about basically the paperwork

567
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:31,245
Speaker 3:  part of preservation and emulation video games because that is something

568
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:34,845
Speaker 3:  I heard a bunch about. One of the people I talked to for this was Chris Kohler,

569
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:38,685
Speaker 3:  who was a video game journalist for a long time now works at Digital Eclipse,

570
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,965
Speaker 3:  which does a lot of really interesting work about emulation and preservation

571
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:45,845
Speaker 3:  of video games. And he was saying they worked on a Teenage Mutant Ninja

572
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:48,925
Speaker 3:  Turtles thing. He basically said it's a miracle that that collection existed

573
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:52,325
Speaker 3:  because there are so many different rights for different

574
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:56,485
Speaker 3:  versions of those stories and different actors and different

575
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:59,725
Speaker 3:  characters and different platforms of different games in different countries

576
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:03,165
Speaker 3:  that he called it kind of a minor miracle when all of those things come together.

577
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:07,085
Speaker 3:  And then I asked him like, is there a version of this that is just totally

578
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:09,525
Speaker 3:  impossible? And he thought about it for while and he's like, I don't really

579
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,645
Speaker 3:  want to say because as soon as I say this, like it'll come together and it'll,

580
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:15,485
Speaker 3:  everything will be great. But he did say that anytime somebody comes to them

581
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:19,005
Speaker 3:  and says, can you bring back this big hit game that we loved when we were

582
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:22,485
Speaker 3:  kids? They've almost always looked into it. And it's almost always just

583
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:25,765
Speaker 3:  logistically like paperwork-wise impossible. But then he told me a story

584
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:28,085
Speaker 3:  about NBA jam that I'm just gonna play for a very quickly 'cause I thought

585
00:34:28,085 --> 00:34:29,845
Speaker 3:  this was a really good example, something

586
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:33,685
Speaker 9:  Like NBA jam where NBA jam has all of these

587
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:37,485
Speaker 9:  likenesses of all of these individual basketball players and it's like

588
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,605
Speaker 9:  they will never, ever, ever be able to re-release

589
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:45,645
Speaker 9:  You know the first NBA jam. But does that mean that

590
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:49,325
Speaker 9:  literally like no one gets to play it

591
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:53,365
Speaker 9:  unless they go and You know buy an

592
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:57,125
Speaker 9:  aging piece of hardware and spend a bunch of money getting a, a Super

593
00:34:57,205 --> 00:35:01,125
Speaker 9:  Nintendo running on a You know. It's like, does that mean literally, like

594
00:35:01,385 --> 00:35:04,885
Speaker 9:  you don't ever get to experience that, that important

595
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:09,365
Speaker 9:  very important part of history. And I think that that's, that's an untenable

596
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:09,725
Speaker 9:  position.

597
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:13,765
Speaker 3:  I love this because a, I think NBA jam is like a perfect example of why this

598
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:16,725
Speaker 3:  is so impossible to do. 'cause you have to call up a bunch of NBA players

599
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:20,525
Speaker 3:  like Living and Dead and try to convince them to do this with you, but also

600
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:24,645
Speaker 3:  kind of perfectly describes this tension right between this stuff feels

601
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:29,125
Speaker 3:  intuitively like it should be available in some way. And it

602
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:32,805
Speaker 3:  is a part of history. Like NBA Jam is maybe the game I

603
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:36,525
Speaker 3:  personally have the most childhood nostalgia for. I played the shit out of

604
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:40,485
Speaker 3:  NBA jam and I loved it so much and I miss it terribly. And it,

605
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:44,085
Speaker 3:  it is sort of sad that in a very real way that game is probably never gonna

606
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:47,885
Speaker 3:  come back into my life in a meaningful way. And like I just,

607
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:51,485
Speaker 3:  I like that as a way of thinking about like why this is complicated and

608
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:56,255
Speaker 3:  for perfectly valid reasons is complicated, but it also sort of

609
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,655
Speaker 3:  sucks that that's the way that It works.

610
00:35:58,045 --> 00:36:01,855
Speaker 4:  Okay. But it kind of then begs the question, and I don't, again,

611
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:05,335
Speaker 4:  I'm sure this is part of this episode of

612
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:09,855
Speaker 4:  obviously there are ROMs out there that you can get within 30

613
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:13,735
Speaker 4:  seconds of Googling NBA Jan Ro I'm sorry, like I, I don't

614
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:17,695
Speaker 4:  wanna like step too far a field of midway in their lawyers, but like

615
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:18,055
Speaker 4:  you

616
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:20,695
Speaker 3:  Just did the same thing that almost every single person I talked to for this

617
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:24,575
Speaker 3:  show did, which is you kind of can't have this conversation without basically

618
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:27,975
Speaker 3:  saying, yes, this is illegal, but it shouldn't be go do it. Like,

619
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:32,055
Speaker 4:  Well I'm not necessarily saying go do it, but I am saying like, I think

620
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:36,255
Speaker 4:  everyone who knows this space knows how easy it is to

621
00:36:36,255 --> 00:36:36,415
Speaker 4:  do,

622
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:40,295
Speaker 5:  But there's step one and there's step two there, which is yes, there are

623
00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:44,375
Speaker 5:  ROMs and that's creating more VHS tapes, right? Like that's

624
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:48,015
Speaker 5:  what we're kind of talking about there. And the problem with relying

625
00:36:48,195 --> 00:36:51,415
Speaker 5:  on ROMs and relying on piracy

626
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:55,975
Speaker 5:  forget, like all the legal stuff for a moment is it's just

627
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:59,895
Speaker 5:  not organized. Yeah. So it's still so easy for things

628
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:03,655
Speaker 5:  to be lost and to slip through the cracks. It it really actually

629
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,695
Speaker 5:  relies on popularity and a, a collective

630
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:11,495
Speaker 5:  willingness to remember something versus something

631
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:14,855
Speaker 5:  that is more official, like a library where

632
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:19,015
Speaker 5:  whether or not it's popular is irrelevant, it existed, it will be

633
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:22,855
Speaker 5:  preserved. And then if, even if people forget about it for 30 or 40 years,

634
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,415
Speaker 5:  when people go back to look for it and the future and there is suddenly a

635
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:30,335
Speaker 5:  reason to care, it'll be waiting for them. It won't just be lost

636
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:34,055
Speaker 5:  because it didn't keep getting uploaded over and over again onto different,

637
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:37,535
Speaker 5:  like random rom sites that were getting whack-a-Mole by Nintendo and other

638
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:38,055
Speaker 5:  companies.

639
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:42,615
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But don't you think that the You know non-centralized

640
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:46,415
Speaker 4:  distribution of this stuff ensures

641
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:50,455
Speaker 4:  its longevity rather than relying on like a singular?

642
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:54,895
Speaker 5:  Not at all. I mean, I I, I appreciate a Bitcoin mentality my friend,

643
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:55,735
Speaker 5:  but

644
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:57,455
Speaker 4:  That's not me. I'm not that guy.

645
00:37:57,815 --> 00:38:01,695
Speaker 5:  I think it's idealistic in that again, it it's so informal

646
00:38:02,435 --> 00:38:06,015
Speaker 5:  and it's so easy for those sites to get taken offline at any moment

647
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:09,575
Speaker 5:  here. Actually, there's a really easy way for me to point this out. When

648
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:13,495
Speaker 5:  Napster was popular, and this is when I was in high school,

649
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:17,695
Speaker 5:  there were a lot of songs that were like alternate versions of songs

650
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:21,655
Speaker 5:  or live versions of songs that I loved and some of my favorite music

651
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:26,495
Speaker 5:  and I cannot find it anymore. And a

652
00:38:26,495 --> 00:38:28,415
Speaker 5:  lot of those I was like, why don't need download? It's gonna be on that.

653
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:31,615
Speaker 5:  Like it's in the air, everybody's sharing it all the time. It's just available

654
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:35,565
Speaker 5:  there forever. And now I'm sure it exists. I'm sure it's on some like

655
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:39,365
Speaker 5:  You know 40 and 50 year olds hard drives somewhere, but they're not sharing

656
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:42,925
Speaker 5:  music anymore. And then younger people don't care about those bands. So

657
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:46,765
Speaker 5:  it's just gone. And that is what I

658
00:38:46,985 --> 00:38:50,645
Speaker 5:  always worry about with ROMs in the world of gaming is it, it it is

659
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:54,485
Speaker 5:  easier for it to disappear than I think we think because

660
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:58,405
Speaker 5:  generational shift is a real thing. And a lot of You know 40 and 50 year

661
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:02,085
Speaker 5:  olds right now really care about seventies and eighties game preservation.

662
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:05,885
Speaker 5:  But like who knows if that'll stay this You know true another 10 years from

663
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,045
Speaker 5:  now.

664
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:09,325
Speaker 3:  The question there is kind of who should be responsible for it, right? And

665
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:12,965
Speaker 3:  this is, this is where we start to get into like some of the legal stuff.

666
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:16,445
Speaker 3:  But I, I did have a couple of conversations with people who think that public

667
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:20,405
Speaker 3:  libraries are really the correct home for this as, as we

668
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:24,045
Speaker 3:  were talking about at the beginning of the show, that that is a place that

669
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:27,885
Speaker 3:  can not only sort of preserve this stuff for historical reasons

670
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:31,885
Speaker 3:  and has good useful like loopholes by which to do

671
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:35,645
Speaker 3:  so, but also can give you access to it,

672
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:38,405
Speaker 3:  right? Like we have, we have this idea of controlled digital lending, which

673
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:41,925
Speaker 3:  is very much under threat because of what like the internet archive did with

674
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:45,245
Speaker 3:  books during the pandemic. Like it's all very complicated and, and we'll

675
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:47,885
Speaker 3:  get into some of that in a minute actually. But I think this idea of who

676
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,525
Speaker 3:  is the right steward of that is really the question. And this is where we

677
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:54,445
Speaker 3:  get to Spotify for video games because there are a bunch of people out there

678
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:58,005
Speaker 3:  who think that maybe the way to do this is to

679
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:01,765
Speaker 3:  essentially bundle it all together. And I think you have to sort of

680
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:05,765
Speaker 3:  set aside a bunch of realities in order for that to be possible. Like

681
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:08,965
Speaker 3:  the idea that a bunch of these companies that have been making games for

682
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:12,285
Speaker 3:  40 years are suddenly gonna decide to all kind of throw in on a single service

683
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:15,965
Speaker 3:  for old video games. Probably super unrealistic. But who knows, maybe we

684
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:18,245
Speaker 3:  would've said that about the music industry 20 years ago and now here we

685
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:21,885
Speaker 3:  are, Spotify exists. Like I think the theory of it is a really

686
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:25,845
Speaker 3:  interesting one for two reasons. One, because it gives it a real chance I

687
00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:30,125
Speaker 3:  think, of being an actual business in a way that I think these sort

688
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:33,525
Speaker 3:  of mini libraries and multiple different services is less compelling. Having

689
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:37,405
Speaker 3:  this like one giant place with all the old stuff

690
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,165
Speaker 3:  could work in a more convincing way. I talked to some people who do not agree

691
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:43,925
Speaker 3:  with that and I talked to people who do. But the other thing is I think it

692
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:47,485
Speaker 3:  would just make it easier. And I think like it's definitely true that you

693
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:51,405
Speaker 3:  can Google video game name and rom and we'll talk about the

694
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:55,165
Speaker 3:  legality of all this in a minute, but you can Google that and find it. But

695
00:40:55,165 --> 00:40:58,885
Speaker 3:  the gap between that and actually playing it somewhere

696
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,525
Speaker 3:  is bigger and more complicated than it often is. Like one of the first people

697
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:05,805
Speaker 3:  I called for this episode was a guy named Ri Tessit who made this

698
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:10,405
Speaker 3:  emulator app called GBA four iOS a bunch of years ago. Yeah. He

699
00:41:10,405 --> 00:41:13,845
Speaker 3:  exploited the like enterprise certificate thing on the iPhone so that you

700
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:17,685
Speaker 3:  could download games onto your iPhone and emulate them and play them there

701
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:20,925
Speaker 3:  doing all these really cool old video game things. And

702
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:25,445
Speaker 3:  he then made a thing called Delta, which is this very professional

703
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:29,205
Speaker 3:  kind of high touch, beautiful way of emulating old video games.

704
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:33,725
Speaker 3:  It's not a way to get ROMs, it's, it's very

705
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:37,645
Speaker 3:  like cognizant of the fact that it can't have the ROMs for you, so you have

706
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:40,485
Speaker 3:  to bring your own ROMs and it just kind of turns a blind eye to where those

707
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:44,445
Speaker 3:  ROMs come from. But it's in this place of like, he built a really

708
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:48,325
Speaker 3:  great app and went to Apple and said, I, I built

709
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:52,005
Speaker 3:  this app for emulating old video games. Can I put it on your

710
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:55,925
Speaker 3:  platform? Let me do it for you. It'll be awesome. And

711
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:58,965
Speaker 3:  let me just play you the, the way he described what happened with Apple

712
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:03,365
Speaker 10:  After GB eight five was shut down. I like tinkered away at what would become

713
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:06,525
Speaker 10:  Delta like just to entertain me and also to learn Swift. It was like a fun

714
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:09,245
Speaker 10:  thing. But then I was like, You know what? I should just reach out to Apple

715
00:42:09,345 --> 00:42:13,285
Speaker 10:  and see what I could do to get it in the app store and like is

716
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:17,125
Speaker 10:  there anything, and So I talked to like the app review team at WC and they

717
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:20,885
Speaker 10:  basically told me Apple's problem is mostly that

718
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:24,685
Speaker 10:  they don't wanna allow people to install any game that they can't approve.

719
00:42:25,065 --> 00:42:27,645
Speaker 10:  And I believe them, like I believe they were concerned that people could

720
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:31,365
Speaker 10:  down like go around like the age rating and stuff if they just like downloaded

721
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:34,085
Speaker 10:  old games through Delta. And I I've heard that and I'm like, You know what?

722
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,245
Speaker 10:  That makes sense. I understand.

723
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:39,325
Speaker 3:  So that's the first half of the story. The second half of the story is he

724
00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:42,085
Speaker 3:  figures out how to make kind of an allow list for these games. He's gonna

725
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:45,725
Speaker 3:  say only these ones are allowed. Which again is a complicated legal thing

726
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:48,845
Speaker 3:  to do because if he's saying you can bring your Pokemon RO and emulate it

727
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:52,205
Speaker 3:  on this thing, you've sort of entered into a world of hurt. But then Apple

728
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:55,125
Speaker 3:  ultimately just said, nevermind, we don't want emulators on this device at

729
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:58,645
Speaker 3:  all. So he built this weird complicated thing where you essentially use your

730
00:42:58,885 --> 00:43:02,685
Speaker 3:  computer as a server to run Delta on your phone and it does work.

731
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:05,965
Speaker 3:  You have to like turn on developer mode and it's really hacky and most people

732
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:09,645
Speaker 3:  just aren't gonna do that. Right. And I think we're just in a position

733
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:13,525
Speaker 3:  now where if you want easy access to these old video games,

734
00:43:13,585 --> 00:43:17,285
Speaker 3:  the best move at least that I've found is to buy one of those

735
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:20,925
Speaker 3:  slightly sketchy things on Amazon that ships with like 27,000 games on it.

736
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:23,925
Speaker 3:  And some of them work and some of them kind of don't. And some of them are

737
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:27,845
Speaker 3:  definitely like porny and gross, but it just doesn't feel like we

738
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:31,685
Speaker 3:  have the good system for it that would even give it a real fighting chance

739
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:32,085
Speaker 3:  to work

740
00:43:32,725 --> 00:43:36,165
Speaker 4:  The good system for like easy emulation for the masses basically.

741
00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:39,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like even, even leaving aside the legality of it, like it just doesn't

742
00:43:39,555 --> 00:43:43,245
Speaker 3:  feel like there is a good tool by which I can get

743
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:47,125
Speaker 3:  access to this stuff. It's all out there if I'm willing to You know search

744
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,965
Speaker 3:  through Reddit and GitHub and find all this stuff. And this is also kind

745
00:43:49,965 --> 00:43:53,605
Speaker 3:  of where we get to the emulation hardware and software side of things. Like

746
00:43:54,025 --> 00:43:56,845
Speaker 3:  the thing that surprised me the most honestly in doing this research is how

747
00:43:56,845 --> 00:44:00,605
Speaker 3:  sophisticated the emulators are for basically every console

748
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:04,805
Speaker 3:  ever. There are amazing groups of people out there working on

749
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:07,485
Speaker 3:  this stuff, mostly in an open source way, mostly just out of the goodness

750
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:11,085
Speaker 3:  of their hearts. The software behind it is incredible. It's just really

751
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:12,485
Speaker 3:  inaccessible to most people,

752
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:16,845
Speaker 4:  Which makes sense because whoever would centralize all

753
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:20,645
Speaker 4:  of this stuff would need all of the permissions that we've been talking

754
00:44:20,645 --> 00:44:24,525
Speaker 4:  yet about that are next to impossible to get. So that's why we

755
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:27,965
Speaker 4:  don't have the core main person doing this. They don't want the responsibility.

756
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:31,725
Speaker 4:  Right. It's much easier to just say, okay, it's on archive or whatever.

757
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:35,565
Speaker 4:  You know you'll find it somewhere, but I don't want to be the person that's

758
00:44:35,565 --> 00:44:36,325
Speaker 4:  responsible for that.

759
00:44:36,555 --> 00:44:39,685
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I mean I, I do think that's part of the challenge is it's like building

760
00:44:39,825 --> 00:44:43,685
Speaker 3:  the Spotify for video games would be 5% really interesting product

761
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:47,125
Speaker 3:  challenge and 95% just nightmare legal

762
00:44:47,235 --> 00:44:49,325
Speaker 3:  paperwork scenarios. Like

763
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:52,365
Speaker 4:  I would say literally impossible from a legal standpoint.

764
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:56,445
Speaker 4:  Literally impossible to get the clearances on the entire catalog

765
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:56,845
Speaker 4:  of

766
00:44:56,845 --> 00:44:59,925
Speaker 3:  Old games. I think that's probably right. But even in theory, like just play

767
00:44:59,925 --> 00:45:03,245
Speaker 3:  out this flight of fancy with me for a minute. If if in theory it worked,

768
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:07,405
Speaker 3:  do you think there is a real business for the Spotify

769
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:08,525
Speaker 3:  of old video games?

770
00:45:09,025 --> 00:45:13,005
Speaker 5:  Not at all. No. No. It's why it should be in libraries. Be Well again, I'm,

771
00:45:13,025 --> 00:45:16,965
Speaker 5:  I'm obviously, I'm very clear with my belief here. Who gives a

772
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:20,605
Speaker 5:  shit? I mean I an adventure capital size thing, right? Like

773
00:45:20,655 --> 00:45:24,645
Speaker 5:  music, people love music every, like you, you go out

774
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:27,285
Speaker 5:  to a stranger and like, have you heard The Beatles? And they're like, yeah,

775
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:30,765
Speaker 5:  I know a few of the songs. Definitely. You go out to a stranger 10 and you're

776
00:45:30,765 --> 00:45:34,565
Speaker 5:  like, Hey, did you play Belmont's Quest? And they're like, can you

777
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,365
Speaker 5:  stop talking to me? I'm trying to buy my groceries. Like, I love this.

778
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:42,485
Speaker 5:  I am a huge advocate for it. I would love for it ex to exist, but as

779
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:46,325
Speaker 5:  we already said with Microsoft and Sony, part of it sure is the legal

780
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:50,005
Speaker 5:  part of it is the financials again of all of the legal.

781
00:45:50,545 --> 00:45:54,405
Speaker 5:  And then part of it is just the hosting of it. You put up thousands and

782
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:58,565
Speaker 5:  thousands of games, most of which you're like bad. That's the

783
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:01,085
Speaker 5:  other part of this. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be preserved, but just

784
00:46:01,085 --> 00:46:04,605
Speaker 5:  like early film, most of it's garbage. Yep.

785
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:08,765
Speaker 5:  And then you get into like, it, it, it is a spiral of more

786
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:12,005
Speaker 5:  questions, right? Like, okay, well we did all of that.

787
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:16,445
Speaker 5:  How do we curate it? Okay, we did all of that. But all that people are playing

788
00:46:16,585 --> 00:46:20,325
Speaker 5:  is Mario and Mario Kart and the original Zelda, which have

789
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:24,125
Speaker 5:  always been, not always but are, are, are relatively readily

790
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:27,805
Speaker 5:  available. I I'm not saying let's not do it, You know,

791
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:31,925
Speaker 5:  fight a fancy money is no object. I I can't wait for

792
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,725
Speaker 5:  somebody to like lose money on this. But when I think of things that are

793
00:46:35,725 --> 00:46:39,485
Speaker 5:  important for history, important for culture, and are going to lose

794
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:44,005
Speaker 5:  profound amounts of money, there's only one group that comes

795
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:47,965
Speaker 5:  to mind and it's the good old USA government and

796
00:46:47,965 --> 00:46:51,845
Speaker 5:  they are going to do a great job doing what they've

797
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:55,605
Speaker 5:  done again with books in the same way that only now are we seeing Barnes

798
00:46:55,615 --> 00:46:58,245
Speaker 5:  Noble try to figure out how the hell to make a business out of books.

799
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:03,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I just, I don't buy that it is a business on practically any

800
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:07,645
Speaker 5:  facet unless you did very specific targeting, which is, is again what what

801
00:47:07,805 --> 00:47:11,525
Speaker 5:  emulation is now, which is you can pay and get metal gear solid

802
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:15,285
Speaker 5:  collection and you can get just the game that is like very

803
00:47:15,645 --> 00:47:18,605
Speaker 5:  specific and they'll charge you a ridiculous amount of money for it.

804
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:22,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Or you subscribed to Nintendo Switch online, which is the

805
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:26,525
Speaker 4:  arguably the closest comparison David, to what you're talking about.

806
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,690
Speaker 4:  And obviously that is the, the main selling point. Like you get a few other

807
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,125
Speaker 4:  perks with Nintendo Switch online, you can get cloud saves and various other

808
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:37,925
Speaker 4:  things, but what they're selling is access to this library of old Nintendo

809
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:40,845
Speaker 4:  games and it's a pretty big library. I don't have an account in front of

810
00:47:40,845 --> 00:47:44,805
Speaker 4:  me, but it's a lot of games. And so they do view

811
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:48,445
Speaker 4:  that as at least some level of an incentive. I don't think it's

812
00:47:48,845 --> 00:47:52,805
Speaker 4:  a genuine like big tick on their balance sheet, but it's

813
00:47:52,805 --> 00:47:53,005
Speaker 4:  there.

814
00:47:53,545 --> 00:47:57,165
Speaker 5:  And I'll I'll say even with Nintendo Switch online, it's telling that they

815
00:47:57,195 --> 00:48:00,845
Speaker 5:  advertise that, but then they also advertise the free DLC for their major

816
00:48:00,855 --> 00:48:04,405
Speaker 5:  games. They advertise the Mario Kar You know courses or whatever. It's

817
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:08,645
Speaker 5:  even, even they see Nintendo You know with the best

818
00:48:08,645 --> 00:48:12,205
Speaker 5:  collection is not like, well it's, this is enough

819
00:48:12,705 --> 00:48:15,765
Speaker 5:  You know, like we, we have these great old games that surely will be enough

820
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:19,245
Speaker 5:  to get people to spend it each month even. They're like, we gotta get some

821
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:21,045
Speaker 5:  new stuff on here or else we're not gonna get people.

822
00:48:21,955 --> 00:48:25,885
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I think I want desperately for it to be a thing. And I think the

823
00:48:25,885 --> 00:48:29,165
Speaker 3:  case for it, which Chris Kohler made to me is that essentially if you can

824
00:48:29,165 --> 00:48:32,645
Speaker 3:  get to a world in which everybody has a handful of games they wanna play,

825
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:36,245
Speaker 3:  right? And that handful might be totally different, but if I'm willing to

826
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:39,165
Speaker 3:  pay 10 bucks a month for access to all these games, even though I'm gonna

827
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:42,125
Speaker 3:  play 10 of them, you're gonna play a different 10, somebody else is gonna

828
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:45,845
Speaker 3:  play a different 10. That's kind of how you can build a sort of omnibus service

829
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:49,085
Speaker 3:  that works. Everybody else I talked to said seems super fun,

830
00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:52,925
Speaker 3:  incredibly niche, probably not gonna be worth anyone actually investing in

831
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:56,565
Speaker 3:  So. I I tend to land on like, I wish it existed. I'd be very surprised if

832
00:48:56,565 --> 00:48:58,125
Speaker 3:  anybody actually does the work to make it exist.

833
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:02,365
Speaker 5:  The other flag that I would say, even if it did exist, is does

834
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:05,925
Speaker 5:  it fundamentally devalue video games in general?

835
00:49:06,345 --> 00:49:10,205
Speaker 5:  If you do that in the same way that Netflix trying to have as

836
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:13,445
Speaker 5:  much as possible on streaming has devalued

837
00:49:13,935 --> 00:49:17,565
Speaker 5:  media in the same way that Spotify having music has pushed it so that musicians

838
00:49:17,565 --> 00:49:21,525
Speaker 5:  have to tour to make their money and they, like, people don't expect

839
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:25,365
Speaker 5:  to make money off of the music itself. I think that's a, a pretty fair

840
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:29,165
Speaker 5:  concern that people have had about Game Pass. Is that like, are we

841
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:32,805
Speaker 5:  seeing this yet again with a devaluing of creative

842
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:36,765
Speaker 5:  work? And I, I think that's been a big part of the unions all the strikes

843
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:40,605
Speaker 5:  in Hollywood, right? Is like, if you're going to do this sort of thing,

844
00:49:41,105 --> 00:49:45,005
Speaker 5:  how do you pay people? Because the audience isn't

845
00:49:45,005 --> 00:49:48,805
Speaker 5:  gonna like the answer, which is we should be charging way, way, way,

846
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:52,645
Speaker 5:  way, way more stuff for, for all of this, for these services

847
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:56,445
Speaker 5:  if we want people to be paid how they were in the past. It is

848
00:49:56,665 --> 00:49:57,085
Speaker 5:  tricky.

849
00:49:57,785 --> 00:50:01,005
Speaker 3:  It is tricky. I, I really agree. Okay, let's switch gears. We're gonna take

850
00:50:01,005 --> 00:50:02,685
Speaker 3:  one more break and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk about

851
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:06,445
Speaker 3:  the law. And I have learned more about copyright than I ever

00:51:11,105 --> 00:51:13,645
Speaker 3:  All, right, we're back. We've been sort of circling this the whole episode.

868
00:51:13,645 --> 00:51:16,725
Speaker 3:  So let, let's just dig into this now. I called up a guy named John Loman

869
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:19,805
Speaker 3:  who works at a, a law firm. He's been in the gaming industry for a long time

870
00:51:19,805 --> 00:51:21,925
Speaker 3:  now. He's a lawyer thinking about a lot of this stuff. And I basically asked

871
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:25,725
Speaker 3:  him, like, walk me through what is going on

872
00:51:25,725 --> 00:51:29,565
Speaker 3:  with the, the legality of emulating and ROMs and where we

873
00:51:29,565 --> 00:51:32,925
Speaker 3:  are in this space. And it turns out it's both like very simple and very

874
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:36,685
Speaker 3:  complicated kind of all at the same time. And basically the

875
00:51:36,685 --> 00:51:40,485
Speaker 3:  first thing he told me was that emulators are

876
00:51:40,905 --> 00:51:44,485
Speaker 3:  lawful as a, as a general rule, if you want to emulate a thing

877
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:47,165
Speaker 3:  that exists, you wanna reverse engineer something and figure out how to run

878
00:51:47,165 --> 00:51:50,445
Speaker 3:  it in software that is generally considered to be lawful, that's fine. So

879
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:54,125
Speaker 3:  the actual act of emulation is okay. And he, he explained it in a way that

880
00:51:54,165 --> 00:51:55,725
Speaker 3:  I really liked. Lemme just play this for you really fast.

881
00:51:56,185 --> 00:51:59,925
Speaker 11:  An emulator is considered to be lawful

882
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:03,525
Speaker 11:  because it doesn't actually copy

883
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:07,645
Speaker 11:  anything. You know An emulator is software that is designed to mimic

884
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:11,805
Speaker 11:  the function of another piece of software, which doesn't necessarily require

885
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:15,325
Speaker 11:  you to copy the code or to copy any You know binary

886
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:19,045
Speaker 11:  executable component of it. You can monitor how that system

887
00:52:19,245 --> 00:52:23,085
Speaker 11:  works and then you can make another system that functions the same

888
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:26,765
Speaker 11:  way. And copyright law only applies to

889
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:30,485
Speaker 11:  the expression of an idea and not to the idea itself.

890
00:52:30,785 --> 00:52:32,965
Speaker 3:  So I thought that that's, it's very good and straightforward and helpful,

891
00:52:32,965 --> 00:52:35,685
Speaker 3:  right? And, what he did say is, do you guys know the story of the Dolphin

892
00:52:35,925 --> 00:52:39,045
Speaker 3:  emulator And? what, what has happened to Dolphin over the years?

893
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:43,325
Speaker 4:  Not recently. I am familiar with it, but I, I don't know what the backstory

894
00:52:43,345 --> 00:52:43,565
Speaker 4:  is.

895
00:52:43,905 --> 00:52:47,765
Speaker 3:  So Dolphin, as I understand it, and, and please everyone email Vergecast

896
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,765
Speaker 3:  at The Verge dot com and tell me all the reasons I'm wrong about this story.

897
00:52:49,765 --> 00:52:53,285
Speaker 3:  But the way I've come to understand it is Dolphin is a, a group of people

898
00:52:53,285 --> 00:52:57,165
Speaker 3:  who made a we u emulator and it was very good and very

899
00:52:57,165 --> 00:53:00,765
Speaker 3:  successful. The Weu as a, a hard console to get right and emulate, but they

900
00:53:00,765 --> 00:53:04,445
Speaker 3:  worked on it really hard, did a good job, and it was made available

901
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:08,405
Speaker 3:  through I think the Steam store. And Nintendo

902
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:12,365
Speaker 3:  basically went to Valve and said, take this thing out, it's breaking

903
00:53:12,425 --> 00:53:16,085
Speaker 3:  the law. And, what it turned out was happening was, again, it's not

904
00:53:16,085 --> 00:53:19,325
Speaker 3:  illegal to build an emulator. So the fact that it existed was okay, but what

905
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:23,325
Speaker 3:  Dolphin had done is found an encryption key, which

906
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:27,165
Speaker 3:  is what allowed Weu to connect to the games and content. They had

907
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:30,525
Speaker 3:  this key that basically was a handshake between the two things and

908
00:53:31,385 --> 00:53:35,125
Speaker 3:  the copying and distribution of that key was illegal.

909
00:53:35,265 --> 00:53:39,085
Speaker 3:  So if, if Dolphin had shipped the emulator and said, bring

910
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:42,245
Speaker 3:  your own key like Riley did with the ROMs, right? It's like where you get

911
00:53:42,245 --> 00:53:45,085
Speaker 3:  them from is not my problem. It's readily available on the internet, but

912
00:53:45,085 --> 00:53:48,445
Speaker 3:  I'm not gonna tell you how to do it. But if you bring them, we're cool. That

913
00:53:48,445 --> 00:53:52,325
Speaker 3:  would've been okay. But instead Dolphin got basically booted

914
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:55,765
Speaker 3:  outta the store, not because it was illegal, but because of like the

915
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:59,325
Speaker 3:  policies of Valve and Nintendo like that just they agreed and took it down.

916
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,845
Speaker 3:  But it did get into this tricky legal gray area where suddenly

917
00:54:03,995 --> 00:54:07,605
Speaker 3:  it's not as straightforward a thing because you are taking something that

918
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:11,405
Speaker 3:  belongs to the company and distributing it. And one of the things that

919
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:15,525
Speaker 3:  John said to me is he's, he would bet that as gaming goes forward and

920
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:18,325
Speaker 3:  as we get more consoles, they're gonna find more ways to lock those things

921
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:22,205
Speaker 3:  together, which is gonna make them even harder to emulate. Which I think

922
00:54:22,265 --> 00:54:23,365
Speaker 3:  is a big bummer.

923
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:27,685
Speaker 5:  I will ease the raging nerd fire in,

924
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:31,605
Speaker 5:  in certain listeners hearts and minds. Right now The dolphin

925
00:54:31,965 --> 00:54:33,725
Speaker 5:  emulates the game cube and the we,

926
00:54:33,755 --> 00:54:36,605
Speaker 3:  What did I say? The we UI did say the We U Yes, you're right. Thank you.

927
00:54:36,675 --> 00:54:37,165
Speaker 3:  There's

928
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:41,085
Speaker 5:  I, I believe there's a different emulator for the Weu. See Mu. But

929
00:54:41,435 --> 00:54:45,085
Speaker 5:  otherwise, I agree with you. I just love that we live in a world

930
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:49,205
Speaker 5:  where I have to push my glasses up my nose

931
00:54:49,425 --> 00:54:53,045
Speaker 5:  and be like, mm, that was a great point, but actually

932
00:54:53,145 --> 00:54:56,045
Speaker 3:  Listen, this is what you're here for. Okay. So that's, that's the first piece

933
00:54:56,045 --> 00:54:59,565
Speaker 3:  of it. And then the other thing that he said, which I thought was really

934
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:03,205
Speaker 3:  interesting is that Straightforwardly ROMs are illegal, right? Like that,

935
00:55:03,205 --> 00:55:06,885
Speaker 3:  that's very simple. The act of distributing and selling ROMs

936
00:55:07,065 --> 00:55:10,885
Speaker 3:  is against the law because that is just straightforward copyright infringement.

937
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:13,685
Speaker 3:  You are making a copy of things, you do not have a right to make a copy of

938
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:17,925
Speaker 3:  super straightforward where everyone seems to agree, at least in this

939
00:55:17,925 --> 00:55:21,725
Speaker 3:  space. And where there seems to be real energy is that that is bad and

940
00:55:21,725 --> 00:55:25,525
Speaker 3:  broken and we need to fix it. Like almost everybody I talked to

941
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:29,085
Speaker 3:  ended up on some long rant about how the copyright system in America is broken,

942
00:55:29,215 --> 00:55:31,685
Speaker 3:  which listeners to The Vergecast will be very familiar with Neli doing So

943
00:55:31,685 --> 00:55:35,525
Speaker 3:  Don don't need to like redo that rant. But this idea that by default

944
00:55:35,595 --> 00:55:38,965
Speaker 3:  essentially a game has to exist for 90 years before

945
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:42,525
Speaker 3:  people can have it and access it and do what they want with it

946
00:55:43,075 --> 00:55:47,005
Speaker 3:  outside of just hoping and begging for one of these companies to

947
00:55:47,205 --> 00:55:51,165
Speaker 3:  re-release it for you. Everyone I talked to seems to think that's a very

948
00:55:51,345 --> 00:55:55,285
Speaker 3:  bad idea. Even John who is a lawyer was like, this is bad

949
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,165
Speaker 3:  and we have to fix it. Which I thought was really fascinating.

950
00:55:57,545 --> 00:56:01,005
Speaker 4:  So let me ask you, 'cause my understanding has always been

951
00:56:01,715 --> 00:56:05,645
Speaker 4:  that if you own a game, like if you went

952
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:09,645
Speaker 4:  and you bought Super Mario RPG on Super Nintendo and you have the

953
00:56:09,645 --> 00:56:13,525
Speaker 4:  cartridge in your home, it is not illegal to

954
00:56:13,755 --> 00:56:17,605
Speaker 4:  back up the data that is on that cartridge, which in turn would

955
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:21,405
Speaker 4:  basically be a rom. So the actual doing of that, using

956
00:56:21,405 --> 00:56:24,845
Speaker 4:  your own personal cartridge that you bought is legal,

957
00:56:25,505 --> 00:56:29,445
Speaker 4:  but distributing it to other people is not legal. Yes. So

958
00:56:29,445 --> 00:56:31,525
Speaker 4:  that's my understanding of it. That's

959
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:35,445
Speaker 3:  Correct. And one, one of the reasons that is the case is John told me about

960
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,965
Speaker 3:  basically the, the federal regulations that govern a lot of this stuff.

961
00:56:39,485 --> 00:56:43,165
Speaker 3:  Actually, lemme just play this clip. He, he introduced this thing 37 CFR

962
00:56:43,185 --> 00:56:45,925
Speaker 3:  2 0 1 and he was like, if people wanna know what's going on, they should

963
00:56:45,925 --> 00:56:49,845
Speaker 3:  read federal regulations 37 CFR 2 0 1. And rather than

964
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:52,805
Speaker 3:  read that to you live on the show, let me just show you the way he explained

965
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:52,885
Speaker 3:  it.

966
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:57,125
Speaker 11:  There are exemptions for preservation of video

967
00:56:57,135 --> 00:57:01,045
Speaker 11:  games, but it's a little bit more narrow because You know some of those

968
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:04,965
Speaker 11:  preservation exemptions only apply to libraries

969
00:57:05,025 --> 00:57:08,485
Speaker 11:  and museums and certain types of organizations.

970
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:12,685
Speaker 11:  You know there are other exemptions that are specifically listed in there

971
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:17,285
Speaker 11:  for You know in cases where you own the software already and now

972
00:57:17,285 --> 00:57:20,725
Speaker 11:  you're allowed to make copies of it for different purposes. And there's

973
00:57:20,725 --> 00:57:23,845
Speaker 11:  some specificity in the code of federal regulations about that.

974
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:28,245
Speaker 11:  There's also provisions in there about games that require

975
00:57:28,355 --> 00:57:32,285
Speaker 11:  some online component and there's ways that if you own the

976
00:57:32,285 --> 00:57:34,765
Speaker 11:  game, that you can spoof these to play it locally.

977
00:57:35,225 --> 00:57:39,005
Speaker 3:  So this is also back to the like make games better thing, I think is an

978
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:43,125
Speaker 3:  interesting way of, of think how do you keep a game playable way past

979
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:45,965
Speaker 3:  the like online infrastructure for it is gonna be a really interesting question

980
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:49,365
Speaker 3:  for the kinds of games people are playing now. But yeah, to your point, Russ,

981
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:52,085
Speaker 3:  the, the federal regulations are what really govern a lot of this stuff.

982
00:57:52,105 --> 00:57:55,525
Speaker 3:  One thing that John told me is there's not a lot of case law around

983
00:57:55,985 --> 00:57:59,645
Speaker 3:  things like emulation and preservation. And his theory for that was

984
00:57:59,645 --> 00:58:03,605
Speaker 3:  essentially that the people doing the emulation and preservation

985
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,485
Speaker 3:  are so small that they literally can't afford the court fees. So the way

986
00:58:06,485 --> 00:58:10,285
Speaker 3:  that it has been is you would need some big

987
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,965
Speaker 3:  player to have the wherewithal and resources to fight against

988
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:17,925
Speaker 3:  Nintendo or Sony or one of these companies picking this fight. But what it

989
00:58:17,925 --> 00:58:21,325
Speaker 3:  has been is you have occasional times where

990
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:25,045
Speaker 3:  Nintendo will say, take this down, and they take it down because they can't

991
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:28,285
Speaker 3:  afford the fight. But mostly we've just ended in this place of like

992
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:32,685
Speaker 3:  Deante, I guess where it's Nintendo doesn't want there to be precedent

993
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:35,645
Speaker 3:  that this is a thing that is legal. So they don't really want the fight either.

994
00:58:36,155 --> 00:58:39,005
Speaker 3:  They want to have this ability to sort of take down things that they want,

995
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:42,805
Speaker 3:  but also leave well enough alone. And like we've been saying, this is a niche

996
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:46,645
Speaker 3:  enough thing and it's for people who love games the most, that

997
00:58:46,675 --> 00:58:49,965
Speaker 3:  it's just a weird group of people to pick this fight with, which

998
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:54,165
Speaker 3:  what John and others said is, is kind of the license for freedom

999
00:58:54,345 --> 00:58:57,685
Speaker 3:  in this space. Like you can do stuff and try things and do interesting things

1000
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:01,525
Speaker 3:  as long as you're not sort of flagrantly trying to become a billionaire selling

1001
00:59:01,665 --> 00:59:05,125
Speaker 3:  old versions of Mario on the internet, you're gonna largely get away with

1002
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,725
Speaker 3:  it because this is just not a space that these companies want to pick fights

1003
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:11,005
Speaker 3:  in. Which I thought was really interesting way of thinking about it. Like

1004
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:14,885
Speaker 3:  it is you'll lose if it comes to that fight, but nobody really wants

1005
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:15,525
Speaker 3:  to have it with you.

1006
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:19,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I think they know well enough that the idea of deleting

1007
00:59:19,525 --> 00:59:23,365
Speaker 4:  something from the internet is impossible, especially something that people

1008
00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:26,645
Speaker 4:  really, really want, like an old version of a game that they loved when they

1009
00:59:26,645 --> 00:59:30,285
Speaker 4:  were a kid. So even though you're right, they have tried and I think they've

1010
00:59:30,285 --> 00:59:34,205
Speaker 4:  shut down some of the more popular, let's say, rom sites, but

1011
00:59:34,355 --> 00:59:37,525
Speaker 4:  largely speaking, there's nothing you can permanently do to get rid of this

1012
00:59:37,525 --> 00:59:38,165
Speaker 4:  stuff, right.

1013
00:59:38,225 --> 00:59:42,165
Speaker 3:  And you just kinda look like an asshole. Like chasing people, making Brahms

1014
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:45,405
Speaker 3:  of old video games they wanna play is, is a tough PR look for a lot of these

1015
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:48,685
Speaker 3:  companies, which I think is how some of these things continue to survive.

1016
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,165
Speaker 3:  The other thing John said that I thought was interesting is those federal

1017
00:59:51,165 --> 00:59:55,045
Speaker 3:  regulations are updated every three years and actually next

1018
00:59:55,045 --> 00:59:58,885
Speaker 3:  year is an update cycle. And so his,

1019
00:59:58,985 --> 01:00:02,965
Speaker 3:  his argument was like, if you wanna make changes to how libraries

1020
01:00:02,985 --> 01:00:06,565
Speaker 3:  can access and distribute video games or how these things are preserved or

1021
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:10,125
Speaker 3:  what's allowed And, what isn't like don't lobby Congress, it's a waste of

1022
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:14,045
Speaker 3:  time. Don't waste the company's time lobbying for that either try and get

1023
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:16,965
Speaker 3:  the federal regulations changed and let's change the carve carve-outs and

1024
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:20,645
Speaker 3:  let's increase the things that people are allowed to do with this stuff for

1025
01:00:20,645 --> 01:00:24,165
Speaker 3:  the sake of preservation and backup and keeping things that you already own

1026
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:27,445
Speaker 3:  as yours that are accessible. That was his advice kind of over and over was

1027
01:00:27,445 --> 01:00:30,845
Speaker 3:  like, that's the move. If you wanna make change, make that change. Who

1028
01:00:30,845 --> 01:00:33,205
Speaker 4:  Do I email? David? Tell me who to email. It's,

1029
01:00:33,205 --> 01:00:36,965
Speaker 3:  It's barackObama@gmail.com. No, I don't know. It's actually, it's a good

1030
01:00:37,165 --> 01:00:40,005
Speaker 3:  question, but I, I should figure that out and if I find an email address,

1031
01:00:40,005 --> 01:00:43,805
Speaker 3:  I'll put it in the show notes for this episode. But this stuff is also

1032
01:00:44,305 --> 01:00:47,685
Speaker 3:  opaque that way. Right? And this, this kind of goes back to like this is

1033
01:00:47,985 --> 01:00:51,765
Speaker 3:  almost an official industry, but it's not quite, and

1034
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:55,285
Speaker 3:  as a result it's just so complicated. And this gets back to like a lot of

1035
01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:58,445
Speaker 3:  the emulator software and hardware that's out there. Like we, we should just

1036
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:01,805
Speaker 3:  talk about the mister for one minute before, before we get outta here. We

1037
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:05,125
Speaker 3:  are in this place now where a, a device like the mister is able to

1038
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:09,285
Speaker 3:  successfully emulate lots of different things at like a hardware level, right?

1039
01:01:09,285 --> 01:01:12,885
Speaker 3:  One of the things that it does is it's not just sort of making

1040
01:01:13,285 --> 01:01:16,805
Speaker 3:  software that operates on a much faster device the way that an older device

1041
01:01:16,805 --> 01:01:20,765
Speaker 3:  might have worked. It's actually better at like on the board running it

1042
01:01:20,765 --> 01:01:24,565
Speaker 3:  the way that it would've run a long time ago. And Mr is such a weird and

1043
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:27,645
Speaker 3:  distributed thing that I literally wasn't able to find someone to talk to

1044
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:31,485
Speaker 3:  me about it for this. I emailed a bunch of like no name email

1045
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:34,645
Speaker 3:  addresses and nobody ever got back to me. I even tried Chris Grant

1046
01:01:34,955 --> 01:01:38,925
Speaker 3:  America's number one, Mr. Fan, nothing. Wow. Things like that

1047
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:42,725
Speaker 3:  are really fascinating. But what Mr can't be is like an official product

1048
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:45,605
Speaker 3:  that you buy at Best Buy because that is just going to like open it up to

1049
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,365
Speaker 3:  complicated troubles that it doesn't need. But until you get there,

1050
01:01:49,995 --> 01:01:53,885
Speaker 3:  it's just too complicated, right? It's like what, what you want is like the

1051
01:01:54,005 --> 01:01:57,405
Speaker 3:  raspberry pie version of something like that that is like much more

1052
01:01:57,405 --> 01:02:01,125
Speaker 3:  accessible to regular people and the emulation community

1053
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,885
Speaker 3:  seems to want that. And I talked to a couple of people who are like, we can

1054
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:07,685
Speaker 3:  get to the point where this is easier for people to get their hands

1055
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:11,525
Speaker 3:  on at a software and hardware level and install new things and find stuff,

1056
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:16,285
Speaker 3:  but it's just every step of that you risk kind of

1057
01:02:16,285 --> 01:02:20,205
Speaker 3:  raising the ire of one of these companies that doesn't wanna fight you but

1058
01:02:20,205 --> 01:02:21,005
Speaker 3:  Will if it has to.

1059
01:02:21,745 --> 01:02:25,565
Speaker 4:  But I would counter that by saying I think there is one company, and people

1060
01:02:25,565 --> 01:02:28,845
Speaker 4:  will probably know this if they're in the space that has done a very good

1061
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,725
Speaker 4:  job of getting misters out in the world and that's analog. Oh yeah.

1062
01:02:32,905 --> 01:02:36,805
Speaker 4:  So analog sells, You know devices that do You know they

1063
01:02:37,005 --> 01:02:40,925
Speaker 4:  sell the, the analog pocket, which handles basically the Game

1064
01:02:40,985 --> 01:02:44,885
Speaker 4:  Boy, game boy color, bunch of handheld systems. They have devices

1065
01:02:45,065 --> 01:02:48,805
Speaker 4:  for old consoles, NES Super Anys, et cetera. And

1066
01:02:48,805 --> 01:02:52,565
Speaker 4:  they have made a business out of it. It is a niche business, but they sell

1067
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:56,085
Speaker 4:  those things out frequently and they have constant models coming out.

1068
01:02:56,275 --> 01:03:00,045
Speaker 5:  It's, it's also a bit of a, for people who have not used the analog system,

1069
01:03:00,145 --> 01:03:03,605
Speaker 5:  you have to have the original video game cartridges to play

1070
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:07,165
Speaker 5:  games on it unless you happen to find

1071
01:03:08,115 --> 01:03:11,725
Speaker 5:  some additional firmware software, whatever the word is that you could put

1072
01:03:11,725 --> 01:03:15,485
Speaker 5:  on it, that that would allow you access to start playing the ROMs

1073
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:19,605
Speaker 5:  directly through it. So I. I think that's true for yeah, sure, if you have

1074
01:03:19,605 --> 01:03:23,565
Speaker 5:  the VHS tapes on hand, but even analog is not

1075
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:27,405
Speaker 5:  putting out an official emulation

1076
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:28,085
Speaker 5:  machine.

1077
01:03:28,145 --> 01:03:29,045
Speaker 4:  That's true. Yeah.

1078
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:32,805
Speaker 3:  I do think you're right that analog is proof that from a hardware perspective

1079
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:36,725
Speaker 3:  that is the kind of thing you can do really well. But even it is like, it's

1080
01:03:36,725 --> 01:03:40,325
Speaker 3:  very clear about the lines it can't cross. And I think until we make those

1081
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:43,725
Speaker 3:  lines easier to cross, which is really complicated again because like for

1082
01:03:43,725 --> 01:03:46,285
Speaker 3:  the reasons we've been talking about, the people who made these things both

1083
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:50,245
Speaker 3:  under the law and just in sort of like moral reality, like deserve to

1084
01:03:50,245 --> 01:03:54,125
Speaker 3:  be compensated for the art that they made and the idea that everything from

1085
01:03:54,345 --> 01:03:57,925
Speaker 3:  the You know whatever, 2006 and before should now just be freely available

1086
01:03:57,925 --> 01:04:01,805
Speaker 3:  to everyone is just not how It works. But it does seem like there

1087
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:04,685
Speaker 3:  should be a better way of doing this. Like one of the things that John proposed

1088
01:04:04,685 --> 01:04:08,125
Speaker 3:  when he and I were talking was that AA reform to the copyright system that

1089
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:11,805
Speaker 3:  he likes would be one where let's say 10 years after you release

1090
01:04:11,805 --> 01:04:15,645
Speaker 3:  something, you just have to do an incredibly basic

1091
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:19,725
Speaker 3:  thing to keep your copyright. Like you, you just have to send in a

1092
01:04:19,725 --> 01:04:23,365
Speaker 3:  piece of paper that says, yep, I still want this and it keeps it as yours.

1093
01:04:23,365 --> 01:04:27,325
Speaker 3:  But what that means is for companies that go outta business or for things

1094
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:30,685
Speaker 3:  that just literally nobody caress about that are, are going to otherwise

1095
01:04:30,685 --> 01:04:34,085
Speaker 3:  just kind of die and there are a lot of those out there, what it would do

1096
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:37,885
Speaker 3:  is without that one tiny piece of effort, that stuff would

1097
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:41,325
Speaker 3:  become public domain. And he's like, that's how we get to a point where things

1098
01:04:41,325 --> 01:04:44,365
Speaker 3:  that are no longer cared about become the property of everybody. And I think

1099
01:04:44,365 --> 01:04:48,085
Speaker 3:  as, as like a common sense way of thinking about it, I like that a lot.

1100
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:52,005
Speaker 3:  I don't, again, that's like a giant legal minefield that I suspect will never

1101
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:54,685
Speaker 3:  happen, but like spiritually that feels about right to me.

1102
01:04:54,965 --> 01:04:58,725
Speaker 5:  I agree with that. I think that will raise a lot of questions like what

1103
01:04:58,725 --> 01:05:02,525
Speaker 5:  about disputes over ownership? So who sends in that

1104
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:05,645
Speaker 5:  sheet of paper, right? And what, what happens there?

1105
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:10,285
Speaker 5:  But I I I agree. I also am a version of that that I think

1106
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:14,125
Speaker 5:  is, I would hope much more doable again with

1107
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:18,405
Speaker 5:  ROMs and libraries is like after five years or

1108
01:05:18,425 --> 01:05:22,325
Speaker 5:  10 years, you still have obviously the right to sell your game,

1109
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:26,525
Speaker 5:  but libraries have access to make the

1110
01:05:26,525 --> 01:05:30,325
Speaker 5:  game available in however many copies you want for free at their

1111
01:05:30,325 --> 01:05:33,445
Speaker 5:  discretion. And then it's like, yes, you still own your

1112
01:05:34,035 --> 01:05:37,405
Speaker 5:  trademark, your copyright, whatever, like you still own the game.

1113
01:05:37,985 --> 01:05:41,525
Speaker 5:  But in terms of public good, we can open this up. I also, I'm, I'm a firm

1114
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:45,685
Speaker 5:  believer that that should be true for not just games. I think the,

1115
01:05:45,745 --> 01:05:49,565
Speaker 5:  the laws in our country in terms of preserving art as

1116
01:05:49,565 --> 01:05:53,405
Speaker 5:  capital are deranged. But, but like that's a whole

1117
01:05:53,565 --> 01:05:55,925
Speaker 5:  separate podcast. I'm sure we'll do one day. Yeah,

1118
01:05:56,005 --> 01:05:59,685
Speaker 3:  I agree with all that. And I will say there was real both enthusiasm and

1119
01:05:59,965 --> 01:06:02,645
Speaker 3:  optimism among the people I talked to that we can get to the point where

1120
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:06,205
Speaker 3:  libraries can be that thing that we're still, we're still figuring out so

1121
01:06:06,235 --> 01:06:10,165
Speaker 3:  much about digital lending and how that interacts with copyright.

1122
01:06:10,225 --> 01:06:13,765
Speaker 3:  And I mean, we're talking about this with eBooks now, right? Like is it the

1123
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:17,485
Speaker 3:  same thing? You have to buy a copy of an ebook for everyone you wanna lend

1124
01:06:17,485 --> 01:06:20,965
Speaker 3:  out or can the library buy the book once and then lend multiple copies? Like

1125
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:23,765
Speaker 3:  we just don't have answers to this stuff, but I think we're gonna get them

1126
01:06:23,865 --> 01:06:27,485
Speaker 3:  one way or another and there's a chance it's really ugly and essentially

1127
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:30,685
Speaker 3:  kind of kneecaps everything libraries wanna do everywhere. Because there

1128
01:06:30,685 --> 01:06:33,045
Speaker 3:  are some publishers out there who would like that and are very powerful,

1129
01:06:33,425 --> 01:06:37,285
Speaker 3:  but there's also a version of it that says like, even digital goods

1130
01:06:37,385 --> 01:06:41,005
Speaker 3:  can be accessible to people as a public good through libraries. And almost

1131
01:06:41,005 --> 01:06:43,805
Speaker 3:  everybody I talked to was like, that's an outcome we can absolutely all get

1132
01:06:43,805 --> 01:06:46,365
Speaker 3:  behind, which I thought was very encouraging. What do we do about the fact

1133
01:06:46,365 --> 01:06:49,045
Speaker 3:  that it's not gonna be a business? This is the question i I want to leave

1134
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:53,085
Speaker 3:  with is like, do we have to just think about this as

1135
01:06:54,005 --> 01:06:57,085
Speaker 3:  artistic preservation and a thing we do because it's important and worthwhile?

1136
01:06:57,945 --> 01:07:01,645
Speaker 3:  Or do we need to find a way to like inject capitalism back into old games?

1137
01:07:02,115 --> 01:07:05,365
Speaker 3:  Like as we think about this issue over the next 10 years, do we think about

1138
01:07:05,365 --> 01:07:09,325
Speaker 3:  this as a public good or like a line of

1139
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:09,685
Speaker 3:  business?

1140
01:07:10,885 --> 01:07:14,165
Speaker 5:  Absolutely. A public good. And that doesn't mean that like the really big

1141
01:07:14,165 --> 01:07:17,365
Speaker 5:  things can't still be a viable business that keep people aware.

1142
01:07:18,065 --> 01:07:21,685
Speaker 5:  For example, I oh humble brag here in a shout out.

1143
01:07:22,185 --> 01:07:26,045
Speaker 5:  I'm on the board of my local indie movie theater here in Orange County.

1144
01:07:26,065 --> 01:07:29,365
Speaker 5:  Of course you're in Santana called the Frida. People should go to it and

1145
01:07:29,365 --> 01:07:33,045
Speaker 5:  see great movies like Dog Day Afternoon was just there, right? And

1146
01:07:33,305 --> 01:07:37,245
Speaker 5:  really great old movies like that and some small ones that could get lost

1147
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:41,605
Speaker 5:  screened there. And that is great and that is a great service and it is a

1148
01:07:41,605 --> 01:07:45,125
Speaker 5:  nonprofit even to show very famous movies like Alien,

1149
01:07:46,305 --> 01:07:50,005
Speaker 5:  you still are probably gonna need to be a nonprofit status just to,

1150
01:07:50,225 --> 01:07:54,085
Speaker 5:  to justify your business. But even we are not going to be

1151
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:57,765
Speaker 5:  showing the lost movies of like 1928,

1152
01:07:58,055 --> 01:08:01,965
Speaker 5:  right? And as time goes on, as this becomes a more mature

1153
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:05,885
Speaker 5:  medium, that's going to be more and more true for video

1154
01:08:05,975 --> 01:08:09,485
Speaker 5:  games. And I think yes, we, we can use

1155
01:08:09,825 --> 01:08:13,765
Speaker 5:  the machine of capitalism to maintain interest in older games,

1156
01:08:14,145 --> 01:08:17,405
Speaker 5:  but it's gonna need to be the big ones just like it is with any other form.

1157
01:08:17,665 --> 01:08:21,525
Speaker 5:  You know how many novels from 1944 do people read

1158
01:08:21,525 --> 01:08:25,125
Speaker 5:  on a regular basis, right? Like you have to find other ways of

1159
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:28,765
Speaker 5:  preserving them. So, I think it, it's a bit of everything. You're gonna have

1160
01:08:29,545 --> 01:08:33,445
Speaker 5:  the market keeping us aware of the really important stuff.

1161
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:37,965
Speaker 5:  You should ideally have libraries or nonprofits that are able

1162
01:08:37,965 --> 01:08:41,485
Speaker 5:  to preserve the stuff that people wouldn't care about. You

1163
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:45,565
Speaker 5:  can do total remakes, like Resident Evil four remake that are

1164
01:08:45,995 --> 01:08:49,445
Speaker 5:  kind of doing I think something that you got, which is even if you do preserve

1165
01:08:49,445 --> 01:08:52,845
Speaker 5:  this, sometimes the games just aren't that fun anymore. Yeah. And you need

1166
01:08:52,845 --> 01:08:56,285
Speaker 5:  to kind of like upgrade it. Demon Souls on the PS five I think is another

1167
01:08:56,285 --> 01:09:00,085
Speaker 5:  example. I think it's a multi-pronged approach. And I, I do think

1168
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:03,805
Speaker 5:  you're right that the fact that I can give all those examples is encouraging.

1169
01:09:04,185 --> 01:09:07,525
Speaker 5:  The one that I can't give is what do we do about all the

1170
01:09:07,525 --> 01:09:11,405
Speaker 5:  99% of games that are not the big stuff? And right now

1171
01:09:11,405 --> 01:09:15,365
Speaker 5:  the answer is pretty much exclusively piracy and ROMs and

1172
01:09:15,365 --> 01:09:19,005
Speaker 5:  that's just neither, it's not good for anybody. It's not good for the companies.

1173
01:09:19,035 --> 01:09:22,885
Speaker 5:  It's not good for preservation to not have better options. It's not good

1174
01:09:22,885 --> 01:09:26,285
Speaker 5:  for availability. It has people having to look at some really

1175
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:30,405
Speaker 5:  nasty ads on their browsers. Yeah. Yeah. I I I think,

1176
01:09:30,485 --> 01:09:32,205
Speaker 5:  I think it's time for change in that department.

1177
01:09:32,725 --> 01:09:34,205
Speaker 3:  I agree. Russ, any thoughts before we go?

1178
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:38,365
Speaker 4:  No, that's, that is a good summary. I I, I do love old games and

1179
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:42,405
Speaker 4:  I love very esoteric old games as well. Stinger

1180
01:09:42,425 --> 01:09:46,005
Speaker 4:  is a side growing shooter where you fight a giant floating

1181
01:09:46,095 --> 01:09:50,085
Speaker 4:  watermelon. And if I can't play Stinger every other year

1182
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:53,885
Speaker 4:  when I have the urge that is a real crime. So, I think we

1183
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:57,325
Speaker 4:  need to make this a huge priority across the country and across the world.

1184
01:09:57,325 --> 01:09:57,605
Speaker 4:  Really

1185
01:09:57,905 --> 01:10:01,245
Speaker 3:  Do it for Stinger is a, is a slogan I can get behind. I like this.

1186
01:10:01,595 --> 01:10:02,325
Speaker 4:  Amen. All,

1187
01:10:02,325 --> 01:10:05,485

1188
01:10:05,485 --> 01:10:08,325
