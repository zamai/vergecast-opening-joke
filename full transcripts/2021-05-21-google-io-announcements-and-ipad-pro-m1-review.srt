Speaker 1:  Hello and welcome to broadcast the flagship podcast of natural

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,690
Speaker 1:  language interpretation. It's very

27
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,620
Speaker 1:  topic. I'm your friend, Nila, Dieter brown this year. I'm

28
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,370
Speaker 1:  your mum. Wow. It's like talking to a paper. Airplane

29
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,760
Speaker 1:  Dieter. Let me tell you, Dan Seaford is here.

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,480
Speaker 1:  Hello. So here's what we're gonna do. The apple epic trial is

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,260
Speaker 1:  ongoing as we're recording in on Friday,

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,220
Speaker 1:  Tim cook is going to take the stand. So we're going to split this

33
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,090
Speaker 1:  episode into two parts, Dan and Dieter, and I are going to go through

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,960
Speaker 1:  Google IO, Android news, where news big,

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,800
Speaker 1:  massive where news, where ROS news. We got

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,730
Speaker 1:  reviews of the new iMac with M one ship Dieter review, the iPad

37
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,360
Speaker 1:  pro there's apple lawsuit. We got all the stuff. We got all kinds of stuff

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,110
Speaker 1:  talking about. Then Addie and I, after Tim cook is done on the

39
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,930
Speaker 1:  stand on Friday, we're going to record a bonus

40
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,920
Speaker 1:  episode to cover that because what is the point of talking

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,220
Speaker 1:  about the epic apple trial? If we don't talk about Tim cook on the stand

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,060
Speaker 1:  and I don't want to wait a whole week until

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,680
Speaker 2:  Next time, the real reason that that we're not doing epic right now is as

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,990
Speaker 2:  we're recording, we're doing this on Wednesday a little bit, early credit

45
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,920
Speaker 2:  crank fighter. He just referred to the Mac as a car, not a

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,490
Speaker 2:  truck or a bicycle, and he doesn't want to lose the entire episode to me,

47
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,550
Speaker 2:  just losing my mind over computer metaphors. I will

48
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,450
Speaker 1:  Say this Craig Federighi basically implied. The iPhone is for

49
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,980
Speaker 1:  babies

50
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,620
Speaker 2:  And using the Mac is very dangerous.

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,160
Speaker 1:  This is like a really, he was like, the Mac has an unacceptable amount of

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,030
Speaker 1:  malware. The iPhone, even an infant can use it.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,010
Speaker 1:  We're trying to make them act like they are in the,

54
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,640
Speaker 1:  of what makes them act different from a phone. And Craig's answer is basically

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,570
Speaker 1:  the neck is too dangerous. It's it's real.

56
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,410
Speaker 1:  So that's going on now? And then Tim cook on Friday. I just didn't want

57
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,140
Speaker 1:  to, I didn't want to talk about it before Tim cook. And

58
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,130
Speaker 1:  then if we did our normal show, I didn't want to wait a week.

59
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,000
Speaker 1:  So Addie and I are going to do a whole trial focused episode later

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,870
Speaker 1:  on Friday. So this episode is just about IO and apple reviews,

61
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,560
Speaker 1:  but I want to start where we always start with, COVID a lots of COVID

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,490
Speaker 1:  news this week, actually as vaccination

63
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,970
Speaker 1:  ramps up, there's a lot of interest in tracking vaccination and continuing

64
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,450
Speaker 1:  to test and continuing to contact trace. I've got a whole story about those

65
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,720
Speaker 1:  tools and why people are uncomfortable using them to control the spread of

66
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,930
Speaker 1:  COVID. I completely understand why people are uncomfortable with digital

67
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,650
Speaker 1:  tracking technology, but there's a lot of conversation about how to use those

68
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,740
Speaker 1:  tools to the countries that they're being used in and how effective they

69
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,400
Speaker 1:  are. So that's a great story. I should read that COVID is running rampant

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,210
Speaker 1:  in India. It is a disaster. It is, people are

71
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,930
Speaker 1:  dying. People are getting sick at unacceptable rates. It has

72
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,200
Speaker 1:  happened in my own family that people have gotten sick and died. And there's

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,040
Speaker 1:  a lot of conversation about patent waivers and vaccine manufacturing

74
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,670
Speaker 1:  waivers in India. We've got a long story from a reporter in India who freelanced

75
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,090
Speaker 1:  with us about the Indian COVID crisis and specifically

76
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,810
Speaker 1:  why just like wide opening manufacturing will definitely help. It should

77
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,140
Speaker 1:  help. Patent waivers are important. And I think the Vita administration should

78
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,010
Speaker 1:  grant them, but there are, there's a laundry list of issues that created

79
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,490
Speaker 1:  that problem. And so we wanted to dive into that and then Nicole wrote a

80
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,450
Speaker 1:  great piece. And I think this is just as we go through it. And as we

81
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,450
Speaker 1:  get vaccinated, we come out of it. There's a lot of focus on what you as

82
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,050
Speaker 1:  a person should do to manage your COVID risk and like your individual

83
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,650
Speaker 1:  choices. And Nicole has a great piece about how focusing on what

84
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,350
Speaker 1:  individuals can do does not solve public health problems. And like, we've

85
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,280
Speaker 1:  really learned that a lot through COVID. So that's all on the site. If

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,490
Speaker 1:  you're not vaccinated, go get vaccinated. The CDC says you can ditch your

87
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,910
Speaker 1:  mask. Obviously that's controversial too. We've got a story about that,

88
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,660
Speaker 1:  but if you're not vaccine, please go get vaccinated. It would be

89
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,500
Speaker 1:  great to have this all over with. And that brings me to IO, which I

90
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,370
Speaker 1:  would note I always held on Google's campus. And if you watch the

91
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,060
Speaker 1:  stream, you notice people were socially distanced. They were outside and

92
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,960
Speaker 1:  they were wearing masks. No chances taken during this, but lots of

93
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,280
Speaker 1:  announcements at IO theater take, take us through

94
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,550
Speaker 2:  The biggest stuff is sort of the, the traditional stuff that you expect.

95
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,450
Speaker 2:  It's Android 12, it's a Google showing off a bunch

96
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,320
Speaker 2:  of futuristic AI demos.

97
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,530
Speaker 2:  It is, you know, that stuff, but some of the do stuff, they they've got a

98
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,830
Speaker 2:  big iteration of workspace. They

99
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,520
Speaker 2:  surprised a bunch of us by actually doing something with

100
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,610
Speaker 2:  where Android, where, where ROS, whatever you want to call it, I guess we're

101
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,060
Speaker 2:  calling it where, but it's unclear. They remembered it exists and they're

102
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,750
Speaker 2:  doing something with it. And then a bunch of Google photos updates to

103
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,550
Speaker 2:  distract you from the fact that unlimited photo storage is going away

104
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,300
Speaker 2:  in a little less than two weeks. Bunch of

105
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,510
Speaker 2:  maps updates, a big, big one, which I

106
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,480
Speaker 2:  imagine, I don't know. We're not probably not talking about too much, but

107
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,200
Speaker 2:  it's, I think it's a big deal. Google shopping is

108
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,160
Speaker 2:  basically now going to be attached to everything. Google makes you are

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,030
Speaker 2:  going to have Google shopping, retail things pop up

110
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,970
Speaker 2:  in all sorts of new places. Now like lens is going to be more directly

111
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,230
Speaker 2:  pointing to it, a whole bunch of other stuff. And they're also partnering

112
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,770
Speaker 2:  with Shopify, which, you know, I recently talked to somebody from

113
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,100
Speaker 2:  <inaudible>

114
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,970
Speaker 1:  The president. Yes. And

115
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,600
Speaker 2:  Now if you are, if you're a retailer on Shopify, you can like click three

116
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,500
Speaker 2:  buttons and show up now on Google shop. So it's a big

117
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,860
Speaker 2:  shot across the bow at Amazon potentially. And it's

118
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,820
Speaker 2:  also, I don't know how often do we worry about

119
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,450
Speaker 2:  the incentives for SEO for websites? How do we worry about the

120
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,980
Speaker 2:  incentives that Google has for where it ranks things like, I don't know,

121
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,360
Speaker 2:  flights and whatever else. Now, Google has an entirely new set of

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,350
Speaker 2:  incentives for selling stuff on the internet and they're going to be attaching

123
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,340
Speaker 2:  it to way more of their products. So that'll be fun. So that's like the

124
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,180
Speaker 2:  top level overview, I think. But I think the big, big

125
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,410
Speaker 2:  news for us to really get into is probably Android and where,

126
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,370
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I want to talk about some of the AI stuff in these big ideas

127
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,910
Speaker 1:  around multimodal search. Well, we'll get to all of that. How could we not

128
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,600
Speaker 1:  spend an hour talking about Google docs, but let's start with

129
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,870
Speaker 1:  Android. Android 12 was in public beta. Now I think YouTube already installed

130
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,140
Speaker 1:  it. I did not have time yesterday. It looks very

131
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,070
Speaker 1:  different. So I mean, that's like the first thing Google can do.

132
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,970
Speaker 1:  There's a part of me that says the pixel not

133
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,780
Speaker 1:  selling well is actually like, it's a good thing

134
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,410
Speaker 1:  in some ways, because if you look at the, like the iOS user

135
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,980
Speaker 1:  experience or even Samsung user experience, they have such a huge install

136
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,730
Speaker 1:  base. They sell so many phones that radical changes to the

137
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,850
Speaker 1:  interface patterns. They have to do a lot of work to get you

138
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,880
Speaker 1:  there. Whereas Google is like, well, 10 of you have this

139
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,720
Speaker 1:  phone. Now it works entirely differently. And you can just

140
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,190
Speaker 1:  deal with it.

141
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,980
Speaker 3:  I mean, they've been doing that for years, right? They changed the, how you

142
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,940
Speaker 3:  access multitasking and stuff on the app or in the phone

143
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,450
Speaker 3:  three years in a row, they changed it. And then they settled down at this

144
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,760
Speaker 3:  time. They didn't change it, the sign, they just changed everything else.

145
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,030
Speaker 3:  And so it's a lot more colorful and it's bubbly and it's, I Dieter. I know

146
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,630
Speaker 3:  you like it. Cause you, you feel like it's a lot easier to use a lot of the

147
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,810
Speaker 3:  settings buttons and the dials and what have you.

148
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,620
Speaker 2:  So the here's the thing it's big and bubbly. We should

149
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,340
Speaker 2:  talk about material you while you

150
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,330
Speaker 2:  heavy side on that one. But like the big change, like functional

151
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,750
Speaker 2:  change of the design is everything is just really

152
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,260
Speaker 2:  big. And everything is a little bit smoother because they've optimized the

153
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,860
Speaker 2:  way animations work as a sub system, those fewer interrupts and they're using

154
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,430
Speaker 2:  the big, less offense. So battery life should be better and it's more efficient,

155
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,230
Speaker 2:  blah, blah, blah, blah. But everything is big. I think that's more

156
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,560
Speaker 2:  accessible. But if you like information density, you're probably going to

157
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,490
Speaker 2:  hate it. And there's a, there's a pretty even mix of responses in the

158
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,760
Speaker 2:  YouTube comments on Twitter, on it. Also a lot of people saying it looks

159
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,000
Speaker 2:  like the iPhone, which I don't understand actually very much.

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Speaker 1:  How does it look like the iPhone? I don't

161
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,890
Speaker 2:  Know. I like control panel has big round buttons. I

162
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,190
Speaker 2:  guess

163
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,010
Speaker 1:  There's only so many shapes. Y'all I

164
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,080
Speaker 1:  know

165
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,540
Speaker 2:  You can have a square or you can have a circle and then you can do something

166
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,840
Speaker 2:  with the corners. Like, what do you want stars? They've got them. They've

167
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,410
Speaker 2:  gotten weird. Starting to got like badges. The new, the new widget system

168
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,140
Speaker 2:  is just like, you can have any shape you want, it looks away. I could

169
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,030
Speaker 2:  do. But

170
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,900
Speaker 2:  anyway, I'm fine with them taking up more

171
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,530
Speaker 2:  space and like having the buttons just be easier to hit and like

172
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,920
Speaker 2:  less cognitive load and be like, where's the wifi button because now it's

173
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,520
Speaker 2:  like twice as big and now you can just have it. So that's an interesting

174
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,330
Speaker 2:  idea, but I'm always interested in like new, interesting ideas

175
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,290
Speaker 2:  in, in UI. The big kerfuffle that I've seen is people trying

176
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,440
Speaker 2:  to decide if what they want the power button to do. Cause Google tried to

177
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,500
Speaker 2:  do a new thing with Android 11 and they've already ditched it. It used to

178
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,620
Speaker 2:  be that it would bring up like some power buttons and then the Google wallet

179
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,400
Speaker 2:  and then home controls. But now it just brings up the assistant, which is

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,550
Speaker 2:  what it does on the iPhone, which is what it does on a galaxy phone. Yeah.

181
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,510
Speaker 2:  So they just had to like, copy everybody else there. But it was like,

182
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,150
Speaker 2:  if you have a smart home stuff, it is a little bit more convenient to like

183
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,810
Speaker 2:  get to it from a power button. But whatever.

184
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,590
Speaker 1:  I mean, I think the thing for me about material, you and I thoroughly enjoyed

185
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,290
Speaker 1:  Mathias is presentation because it, yeah,

186
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,430
Speaker 1:  in many ways it was ominous. I dunno how to

187
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,150
Speaker 2:  Describe it any other way. Like,

188
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,990
Speaker 1:  Like his he's just, he's a big personality. He was wearing an insane

189
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,230
Speaker 1:  shirt, big, big shirt. Well, he definitely looked like he was, he had been

190
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,590
Speaker 1:  DM-ing with the mayor of Miami. You know what I'm saying? Like huge personality,

191
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,460
Speaker 1:  big floral shirt. And he kept saying things like now there is a color for

192
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,390
Speaker 1:  every mood and it's like, dude, why aren't you

193
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,610
Speaker 1:  in my brain? Like, but the operating

194
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,450
Speaker 2:  System, my favorite was what if instead of form following

195
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,060
Speaker 2:  function, form followed feeling

196
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,660
Speaker 1:  You think was the line. Yeah. I mean, there's just, there was all these little

197
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,560
Speaker 1:  lines in there that they were delivered with such

198
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,430
Speaker 1:  intensity that I was like, are you going to Ash feel like the

199
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,610
Speaker 1:  last line could have been like in now we will control your feelings.

200
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,510
Speaker 1:  Like just make the turn. But I look at

201
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,470
Speaker 1:  this, I look at the design across Google's products is this

202
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,950
Speaker 1:  is the whole point of material. You, it's not just Android 12. It's how the

203
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,520
Speaker 1:  apps are going to work. It's connected to their hardware design that they're

204
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,300
Speaker 1:  trying to unify all the sustetic. And it is definitely less

205
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,940
Speaker 1:  silly than Google used to be. It's far more

206
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,810
Speaker 1:  refined. It feels more careful,

207
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,770
Speaker 1:  right? Like there's a sense of, okay, we're actually

208
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,720
Speaker 1:  going to do the thing where the shapes of our hardware map to

209
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,900
Speaker 1:  shapes in our software design, like a very apple thing to do, but Google

210
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,470
Speaker 1:  hasn't really done it. And now they've got a big plan to do it. I think Dieter,

211
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,400
Speaker 1:  you said everything is really big. Google's confidence that it

212
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,120
Speaker 1:  knows what the most important information is, is like at a DNA

213
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,270
Speaker 1:  level across the company. I think that's what Google does. And you see how

214
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,900
Speaker 1:  big things are. And they're like, what you really want is a big ass clock.

215
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,380
Speaker 1:  So here's a big ass clock and it's a very, well-designed integrated with

216
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,470
Speaker 1:  everything and it kind of looks like your nest hub. And I think that's, that

217
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,460
Speaker 1:  is a big turn for Google. And I, I, you reacted when I said it doesn't look,

218
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,940
Speaker 1:  it's not as silly as Google used to be. I think it's still friendly, but

219
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,750
Speaker 1:  Google it's like outrageously silly.

220
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,350
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So what's funny about it is it's like, this is the, the

221
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,070
Speaker 2:  last nail in the coffin of the droid aesthetic, right? This is so far from

222
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,820
Speaker 2:  like even a honeycomb that Matea, Storytape worked on.

223
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,810
Speaker 2:  There's this whole, like, I dunno, cool computer nerd vibe, right?

224
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,770
Speaker 2:  Like the game revive or whatever to Andrei Tony stark back. Yeah. Tony

225
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,250
Speaker 2:  stark. Yeah. And like that's all gone. And so when compared

226
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,970
Speaker 2:  to some of the old stuff at Android, I think it's more

227
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,840
Speaker 2:  playful, but you're right. That it is refined in a way that oh, gee,

228
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,300
Speaker 2:  Google playfulness was never refined. Yeah.

229
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,900
Speaker 1:  I mean, that's just like not primary colors and big silly shapes.

230
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,470
Speaker 1:  Like I think it looks really good. I think one of the big

231
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,460
Speaker 1:  problems Google has is that nobody buys these phones.

232
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,420
Speaker 1:  So it's a, it's like an opportunity for them to experiment way

233
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,050
Speaker 1:  faster than anybody else can. And

234
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,800
Speaker 1:  like the hardware design and the app design and you know, the

235
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,640
Speaker 1:  Chromecast TV or the, what is the Google TV with Chromecast or whatever it's

236
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,860
Speaker 1:  called now, the Chromecast ultra with Google

237
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,610
Speaker 1:  TV, Android name, guys, search

238
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,310
Speaker 1:  docs, TV, good job ever. It's

239
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,090
Speaker 1:  called. You can see that that little piece of

240
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,900
Speaker 1:  hardware like connects to this aesthetic, they're building a remote app.

241
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,800
Speaker 1:  Like they're starting to do all the connections, but so many of

242
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,640
Speaker 1:  their apps and services run on other people's operating systems. So

243
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,210
Speaker 1:  they're disconnected from like the iOS aesthetic. They're disconnected from

244
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,780
Speaker 1:  the windows aesthetic. And I think the big question for Google is always,

245
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,840
Speaker 1:  how do you they're disconnected from the Samsung

246
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,800
Speaker 1:  aesthetic? So how do you, how do you like put

247
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,640
Speaker 1:  your, your company's interface identity into the world when it's always

248
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,270
Speaker 1:  sitting next to something else that is the primary UI design

249
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,460
Speaker 1:  of, of that hardware.

250
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,420
Speaker 2:  Well, and how much of this is going to get on Samsung or, you know,

251
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,200
Speaker 2:  Shami or whatever. They're going to encourage everybody to adopt material

252
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,920
Speaker 2:  you in their own, like, you know, personal, beautiful way, but is Samsung

253
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,640
Speaker 2:  going to do that? If Google is actually successful at getting app

254
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,540
Speaker 2:  developers to update their widgets? Cause I haven't done it since 2012, which,

255
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,300
Speaker 2:  sorry I have developers, but chances are you haven't updated your widget,

256
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,930
Speaker 2:  your Android widget since 2012. Well that now look weird on a Samsung phone

257
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,110
Speaker 2:  because it's like designed for a pixel. Like cause no one, no people are

258
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,880
Speaker 2:  gonna want to design to have it look good on a phone. So the only

259
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,490
Speaker 2:  question that really matters is what does it look like on a pixel is what

260
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,120
Speaker 2:  does it look like on a Samsung? Yeah. We won't know for six

261
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,500
Speaker 2:  months.

262
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,900
Speaker 1:  Well, are we expecting a new pixel at this? There were some rumors. Right?

263
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,130
Speaker 1:  And then they didn't do it.

264
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,060
Speaker 3:  I mean, they've announced the Google pixel,

265
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,020
Speaker 3:  like they said, Hey, we're doing this phone and you know,

266
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,860
Speaker 3:  a logical person might have said, oh, you've got this big event. A lot of

267
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,950
Speaker 3:  press is paying attention to it. Maybe you want to slip a hardware announcement

268
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,730
Speaker 3:  into there. They

269
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,270
Speaker 2:  Did not do that. Yeah. They announced the phone. If you don't recall, by

270
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,900
Speaker 2:  denying that it was canceled. That was how they,

271
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,620
Speaker 3:  There was rumors that, oh, this phone that everyone expects Google to probably

272
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,800
Speaker 3:  make it's not going to happen. And then Google was like, no, no, no, wait,

273
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,960
Speaker 3:  wait, wait, wait, we're doing it. We're releasing it in two markets. We'll

274
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,890
Speaker 3:  talk to you later. And then, you know, we haven't heard anything since.

275
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,610
Speaker 3:  So the pixel five a is still TBD. You would assume that it's going to be

276
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,510
Speaker 3:  soon. It's almost June. It is a different generation

277
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,940
Speaker 3:  than what we expect them to do with the fall, with the pixel six and the

278
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,600
Speaker 3:  rumor du processor and everything like that. So you would assume that it's

279
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,750
Speaker 3:  gotta be soon. The other piece of hardware that's long been rumored now is

280
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,470
Speaker 3:  new pixel buds that are called some kind of pixel buds a. So there was, are

281
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,430
Speaker 3:  two pieces of hardware that you maybe could have seen here didn't

282
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,460
Speaker 3:  happen. It was an entirely software services show.

283
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,770
Speaker 2:  I believe Google might have Telegraph that they want to do announce the five-day

284
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,000
Speaker 2:  at the usual time, which may mean that they are in fact waiting for the fall.

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,370
Speaker 2:  And so we'll have another one of these wacky situations where there's a pixel

286
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,370
Speaker 2:  six and a pixel five eight at the same time, which will

287
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,090
Speaker 2:  be exhausting. The third piece of rumored

288
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,960
Speaker 2:  hardware, which there's much less information about is the, the pixel

289
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,470
Speaker 2:  watch. But that is, we should probably get through the rest of Android before

290
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,020
Speaker 2:  we started having emotions about wearables.

291
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,990
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Do was like adding little features to Android. I'm always

292
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,920
Speaker 1:  interested, like what makes it in the system and what

293
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,910
Speaker 1:  makes it into Samson's version of Android or Jeremy's or whoever. So

294
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,750
Speaker 1:  what are the, the system level features they've added to Android 12th,

295
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,350
Speaker 2:  Other than moving the stuff around, which nobody adopted, they have added

296
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,650
Speaker 2:  new privacy permissions. So there's a little indicator for

297
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,580
Speaker 2:  camera and a microphone. There is a

298
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,910
Speaker 2:  new approximate location thing. So instead of giving someone your pinpoint

299
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,240
Speaker 2:  location, you can give your neighborhood, there's a new privacy dashboard

300
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,810
Speaker 2:  that tells you how often your stuff has been accessed. I don't know if that'll

301
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,650
Speaker 2:  make it. And there is a new Android TV remote, which

302
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,130
Speaker 2:  may or may not make it to other phones, but it will be built in at an O S

303
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,120
Speaker 2:  level. And there's also buttons in quick settings to

304
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,050
Speaker 2:  just turn off like their switches, your camera, your microphone. I think

305
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,650
Speaker 2:  that's actually pretty cool. Yeah. Just the apps think they have camera

306
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,590
Speaker 2:  access, but they don't, which is kind of clever.

307
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,830
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think that's really smart. I mean, I, I like the idea that these

308
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,550
Speaker 1:  two companies are now racing each other for privacy features. And I really

309
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,390
Speaker 1:  like the we're going to let the apps think they have it. And every

310
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,840
Speaker 1:  time they call it, we're going to ask you again. Cause it, a lot of people

311
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,740
Speaker 1:  say no and forget, and then they have no idea why things are broken.

312
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,680
Speaker 1:  So I think this is really

313
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,580
Speaker 2:  The other privacy thing. I was expecting a non-answer from Google,

314
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,480
Speaker 2:  but they gave me, we'll tell you later this year answer, which is some kind

315
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,230
Speaker 2:  of app tracking for ads in the same way apple has ATT and

316
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,220
Speaker 2:  Chrome is doing

317
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,770
Speaker 1:  Flock, oh my God, privacy

318
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,980
Speaker 2:  Sandbox. There's going to be some answer for Android later this year, but

319
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,310
Speaker 2:  they don't have it today. So that's, that's something to watch out

320
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,380
Speaker 2:  for

321
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,130
Speaker 1:  Before I, oh, there was some reporting times journal, et

322
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,820
Speaker 1:  cetera, that Google doesn't really know how to

323
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,780
Speaker 1:  handle the cookies, flock tracking debate because

324
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,590
Speaker 1:  their entire business is selling ads. Yep.

325
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,490
Speaker 1:  And I think this is just a very unique dynamic for Google. They're also under

326
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,390
Speaker 1:  an enormous amount of antitrust pressure. So if they

327
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,720
Speaker 1:  do the thing, everyone wants them to do, which is turn off most tracking

328
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,150
Speaker 1:  and just use this first party data set. They have anti

329
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,920
Speaker 1:  competitively foreclosed other people from running advertising

330
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,910
Speaker 1:  networks in their browser and on their phone. Right. Do you think

331
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,810
Speaker 1:  this is a problem? You probably don't do. I think it's a problem.

332
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,320
Speaker 1:  I don't think it's a problem to the ad. Tech vendors think it is a

333
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,070
Speaker 1:  problem. They definitely think it's a problem. And they're like, get me on

334
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,400
Speaker 1:  the phone with Europe. We're going to shut Google down. And that is just

335
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,460
Speaker 1:  the weirdest situation for Google to be in. Yeah.

336
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,220
Speaker 2:  You know, if you're worried that Google won't be able to figure out how to

337
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,970
Speaker 2:  target ads to you, if they don't have third-party cookies and ad app tracking,

338
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,510
Speaker 2:  I'll just say to you, the thing that Casey Newton said to me, which

339
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,540
Speaker 2:  is they can talk to Pluto. They're going to be fine.

340
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,300
Speaker 1:  Yeah. They're going to figure it out. The question

341
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,780
Speaker 2:  Is, will they figured out for everybody else or not? And who knows? Yeah.

342
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,500
Speaker 2:  The last thing I guess for Android is we should talk about the Android

343
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,990
Speaker 2:  private compute core. Yeah. It's a

344
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,470
Speaker 1:  Core. Yeah, that's right. It's a real clock, not hardware,

345
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,660
Speaker 1:  hardware.

346
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,650
Speaker 2:  It is a special sandbox for running machine learning. Things that Google

347
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,950
Speaker 2:  thinks you will think is creepy. So it's smart chips that

348
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,760
Speaker 2:  analyze how you talk to give you smart replies. It's what

349
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,660
Speaker 2:  music is playing. And I get the impression, it's more stuff there.

350
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,260
Speaker 2:  Like they made this thing so they could do more machine learning stuff in

351
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,250
Speaker 2:  the future that they know would, you know, creep you out a little bit. So

352
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,910
Speaker 2:  everything in the box has no network access and apps can only communicate

353
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,720
Speaker 2:  via very limited API APIs. Speaking of stuff that I

354
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,650
Speaker 2:  expect from them in the future, they implied that that was one of the reasons

355
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,740
Speaker 2:  they moved the Google assistant button to the power button so that I could

356
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,340
Speaker 2:  do more contextually, aware stuff based on whatever screen you're on. Cause

357
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,250
Speaker 2:  it's easier to just hit the power button and ask about the screen that you're

358
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,180
Speaker 2:  looking at than it is to swipe up from the corner actually swiping

359
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,060
Speaker 2:  up from the corner was always a terrible idea. And I'm glad that nobody bothered

360
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,510
Speaker 2:  doing it except for Google because what a fiasco, that gesture was

361
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,930
Speaker 1:  Okay. I did it by accident a lot. And I know this

362
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,690
Speaker 1:  isn't you have nothing to say to me about this Twitter

363
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,580
Speaker 1:  feed.

364
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,360
Speaker 3:  I will say, you know, first beta,

365
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,440
Speaker 3:  very early, you can do

366
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,220
Speaker 3:  both. Currently you can have the power button

367
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,290
Speaker 3:  launch assistant. You can also do the corner gesture.

368
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,160
Speaker 2:  If you, if you have a power button launch assistant, Dan, how do you turn

369
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,380
Speaker 2:  the phone off?

370
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,100
Speaker 3:  Ah, that's a good question. Let's find out. All right.

371
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,060
Speaker 3:  I, I don't know. I'm holding the phone. It's like,

372
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,250
Speaker 1:  Oh no, there's gotta be. There's

373
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,670
Speaker 3:  Gotta be the volume thing. Nope. That's a screenshot. Nope. I know how to

374
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,790
Speaker 3:  use phones. Well,

375
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,710
Speaker 2:  It's my understanding is that you have to turn it off again. If you

376
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,800
Speaker 2:  want to turn the phone off, eventually, if you look closely at the screenshots

377
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,370
Speaker 2:  in my article, there is going to be a power menu in the bottom of the quick

378
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,520
Speaker 2:  settings. So there'll be like edit quick settings, go to all settings. And

379
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,250
Speaker 2:  then there's a tiny little power button there to go to power settings. The

380
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,130
Speaker 2:  Samsung way. I hate that way. It's funny. He's the power button. Well,

381
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,210
Speaker 2:  I liked the death grip way that that apple does, although I hit the screenshot

382
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,270
Speaker 2:  accidentally, but yeah.

383
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,270
Speaker 2:  Whatever who wants to turn their phone off anyway.

384
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,640
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, this is like, it's like kind of, you only want to turn off

385
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,030
Speaker 1:  when it's like crashing in most, most of these funds, like will eventually

386
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,750
Speaker 1:  recognize they're in some sort of death loop and just like restart themselves.

387
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,500
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So maybe the way is actually no buttons. Here's my Steve jobs approach

388
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,680
Speaker 1:  to this problem. No buttons at all. It's for

389
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,430
Speaker 1:  babies. It's for me actually.

390
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,300
Speaker 2:  Can I, can I tell you a story, Paul Moez, when

391
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,260
Speaker 2:  it crashed, they would, unless they knew unless they knew what it was

392
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,170
Speaker 2:  and that you needed to do something about it, they would just let it crash

393
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,590
Speaker 2:  and restart it and never tell you, including rebuilding the entire phone.

394
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,070
Speaker 2:  In some cases it's like they would just, they would ne they just, they chose

395
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,100
Speaker 2:  not to show error messages because nobody knows to do to their messages.

396
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,870
Speaker 2:  So they just crash in the background. But

397
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,860
Speaker 1:  This is like, like echo devices do this, right? Like

398
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,770
Speaker 1:  Amazon echo devices are like constantly restarting themselves. And no one

399
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,090
Speaker 1:  ever knows

400
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,810
Speaker 3:  That. That's also how a certain folding device that recently came into my

401
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,480
Speaker 3:  life behavior.

402
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,660
Speaker 1:  It just reboots it. But it's just like a motor is like flaps, open and shut.

403
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,670
Speaker 1:  It's a goodbye.

404
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,520
Speaker 3:  It's you close it and you open it. And it's just like,

405
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Speaker 1:  All right. So that's Andrew 12, a bunch of stuff. We'll see. There's like

406
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,160
Speaker 1:  other little stuff like Google photos adding this like locked folder for

407
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,630
Speaker 1:  pictures. Yeah. Which is great. So

408
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,860
Speaker 2:  Like, yeah, if you're, if you're like taking pictures of a puppy to give

409
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,760
Speaker 2:  to your child. Yeah. That's what it's called. That.

410
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,210
Speaker 2:  That's great.

411
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,510
Speaker 1:  No, that's a good feature. Like I think that stuff is neat. There's other

412
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,990
Speaker 1:  stuff that's kind of like more, I don't know, it's less tangibly part of

413
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,830
Speaker 1:  Android 12, like they're updating their camera algorithms to handle dark

414
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,890
Speaker 1:  skin better to do it. There's stuff that's coming that will

415
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,340
Speaker 1:  affect in particular, the pixel experience and

416
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,580
Speaker 1:  hopefully spread out to the rest of Android. I think that's

417
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,570
Speaker 1:  great. But the real news theater, the real

418
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,350
Speaker 1:  news. Yeah. Samsung and Google are

419
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,190
Speaker 1:  bringing their smartwatch platforms together. Yeah. I put in the live blog

420
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,000
Speaker 1:  that there are 60 people who care about this and the tree got like, I retweeted,

421
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,930
Speaker 1:  somebody took a screenshot, I got 95 likes.

422
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,830
Speaker 1:  That was up 30%, but it was still 95

423
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,820
Speaker 1:  likes, but this is sort of a big

424
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,720
Speaker 1:  deal. Like Tyson was invented is like a hedge against

425
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,600
Speaker 1:  Google. Remember there was that whole, there was like a year where people

426
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,930
Speaker 1:  thought Samsung was split off from Google where Google was mad at launched

427
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,530
Speaker 1:  a couple of phones where Google was mad about

428
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,400
Speaker 1:  Samsung, just like skinning, Android so hard and trying to pull them back.

429
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,270
Speaker 1:  And now they're like, yeah, it was just emergencies operating. It's if

430
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,260
Speaker 1:  you old old-school Vergecast heads will know when I say this is Migo,

431
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,110
Speaker 1:  this is Migo. You

432
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,980
Speaker 2:  Actually, can you explain that? Cause like it, it takes, it's a long walk

433
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,660
Speaker 2:  to get to this as beco.

434
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,990
Speaker 1:  All right. What were the constituent operating systems? Amigo?

435
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,930
Speaker 2:  And there was memo memo, Nokia hadn't memo, which

436
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,800
Speaker 1:  Was their new smart fund platform. Intel had like

437
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,670
Speaker 1:  Bob Moblin

438
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,240
Speaker 1:  Dan, remember, as Dan did, Dan is trying to pretend it's not on the tip of

439
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,720
Speaker 1:  this time. Anyway, there was a

440
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,530
Speaker 1:  vision of a new Linux-based smartphone operating system from like

441
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,060
Speaker 1:  two or three companies that they jammed together to make

442
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,970
Speaker 1:  Maemo M a E M O and

443
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,390
Speaker 1:  then it still was like, not as good as iOS. And then Android shut

444
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,870
Speaker 1:  up. That is my understanding at the time, I

445
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,680
Speaker 3:  Don't know if MIMO ever made it to a shipping phone. There was

446
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,580
Speaker 3:  one like Intel was threatening to release a phone for years and it, it

447
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,790
Speaker 3:  all fell apart and they never could get their chips in order. And

448
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,630
Speaker 3:  Nokia became windows phone, like

449
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,130
Speaker 3:  yeah.

450
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,760
Speaker 1:  900 was a default name of Wego

451
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,230
Speaker 2:  They made, they made some, they made some stuff with either maybe army or

452
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,060
Speaker 2:  I forget Nokia and 900.

453
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,980
Speaker 1:  Definitely. Yeah. Okay.

454
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,770
Speaker 3:  I, I stand corrected. The end 900 was the memo phone. And then it

455
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,670
Speaker 3:  died designed

456
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:37,630
Speaker 2:  By Peter Skillman who helped design Paulo, Wes and web boss.

457
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,410
Speaker 1:  We're so far down this road anyway, when they announced this thing.

458
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:45,010
Speaker 1:  So I want to, I know what is actually happening, but so they

459
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,910
Speaker 1:  announced this thing and it brought me back to like straight

460
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,300
Speaker 1:  up my old head gadget playing days. Like what happens when two companies

461
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,930
Speaker 1:  announced a partnership to merge their operating systems? Well,

462
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,860
Speaker 1:  random executives you've never heard of from before show up on stage to

463
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,550
Speaker 1:  be like working with partner company X has been a

464
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:07,480
Speaker 1:  dream with their innovations and ability to

465
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,930
Speaker 1:  do fitness and our innovations and ability to make

466
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,770
Speaker 1:  hardware. The future is bright for smartwatch customers. And that is

467
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,640
Speaker 1:  exactly what happened here. It was like a 2008 CS cleanup,

468
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,980
Speaker 1:  so, okay.

469
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,700
Speaker 2:  Where O S slow, not a lot of

470
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,660
Speaker 2:  support, nobody's using it, whatever.

471
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,410
Speaker 2:  A Tizen fast, terrible non-existent app

472
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,200
Speaker 2:  support. That's got Samsung behind it. And so it's good. And

473
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,190
Speaker 2:  also by the way, Google bought Fitbit. And so Fitbit's over in the corner

474
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,550
Speaker 2:  and Google insisted, they didn't buy Fitbit for the software or the data.

475
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,850
Speaker 2:  They wanted to buy it for hardware. But there's a, that's a little bit weird

476
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,570
Speaker 2:  this there, because Fitbit is also part of the story. It's not two things

477
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,340
Speaker 2:  coming together. It's three.

478
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,220
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So kind of right.

479
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,060
Speaker 2:  Kind of. So from what I can see the basis, basically still

480
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,990
Speaker 2:  warehouse, I watched the IO presentation on it and like, it's very wearable

481
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,770
Speaker 2:  se it's not very tiny Samsung contributed screen

482
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,950
Speaker 2:  stuff. They contributed how to make it more battery efficient and they contributed

483
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,010
Speaker 2:  how to make it work with processors better. So maybe it's

484
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,970
Speaker 2:  like some low level merging of the two, but like you

485
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,930
Speaker 2:  write apps with Kotlin and a jet pack, which is the Android way to

486
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,860
Speaker 2:  do good fast apps. Now it's like, it's basically where with a bunch of Samsung

487
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,880
Speaker 2:  stuff put in, like how to make, watch faces.

488
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,780
Speaker 3:  Well, I had already kind of adopted a lot of the UI that Samsung had

489
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,990
Speaker 3:  with Tyson in later versions where RS already. So they were already kind

490
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,470
Speaker 3:  of on the same path in terms of like interactions. And then

491
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,770
Speaker 2:  Fitbit is going to be the fitness health stuff

492
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,340
Speaker 2:  on the watch, but apparently Google fit isn't going away, which is the

493
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,940
Speaker 2:  dumbest decision. Really?

494
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,480
Speaker 3:  Fortunately S health Samsung S health is going

495
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,650
Speaker 3:  away.

496
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,680
Speaker 2:  That one will not be there. Okay, great. Yeah, they did confirm it.

497
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,610
Speaker 2:  <inaudible> so several one is promising that there's new

498
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,510
Speaker 2:  stuff. Yeah. Everyone's

499
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,600
Speaker 2:  promising to make stuff. Samsung has said we're doing it soon. Samsung has

500
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,780
Speaker 2:  done making ties and watches apparently, which is great

501
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,620
Speaker 2:  news. All I care about is that there be a decent

502
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,610
Speaker 2:  smartwatch option for Android users. Like this thing is gonna, you'll

503
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,700
Speaker 2:  have a cellular option. It's going to work a with more cellular networks,

504
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,300
Speaker 2:  quote unquote. So like it's going to be supported. We are assuming Google

505
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,870
Speaker 2:  is going to make its own thing too. Maybe some company not called fossil.

506
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,280
Speaker 2:  We'll start making these watches too.

507
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Speaker 1:  Who knows? Well, so this isn't, this is kind of the big question for me,

508
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,190
Speaker 1:  right? So why do you bring these two things together?

509
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,150
Speaker 1:  Because where, where oh, S has supported the

510
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,960
Speaker 1:  Android system level. So you can theoretically use it with any Android

511
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,380
Speaker 1:  phone, but the products are bad.

512
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,710
Speaker 1:  Sorry. I know some people like some of the products, but like as a sweeping

513
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,580
Speaker 1:  generalization, I'm comfortable saying the products are bad. Ties and

514
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,300
Speaker 1:  watches are slightly better, but really only work with Samsung

515
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,080
Speaker 1:  phones.

516
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,140
Speaker 3:  Well, I think the difference is, is what this is bringing together in that

517
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,100
Speaker 3:  I think the 90 people that are excited about it are excited because the

518
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,550
Speaker 3:  ties and watches, the Samsung watches generally have the best hardware in

519
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,360
Speaker 3:  the Android option ecosystem. They have the best battery life. They have

520
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,150
Speaker 3:  the best screens. They've got reliable clicky vessels to

521
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,080
Speaker 3:  control them. And they are noticeably faster than the was

522
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,770
Speaker 3:  counterparts, but they don't have, they have Bixby instead of the Google

523
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,980
Speaker 3:  assistant, they don't have access to any of Google services and things like

524
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,910
Speaker 3:  that. So if they, the dream is take Google services, stick them on a

525
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,790
Speaker 3:  Samsung Tizen watch, and you've got like a compelling

526
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,130
Speaker 3:  interesting.

527
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,560
Speaker 1:  I'm just like, let's take a step back from that. If you think about, if you

528
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,460
Speaker 1:  are fully in the big ecosystem, you know, I'm cutting this down to like

529
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,930
Speaker 1:  four people and please call me, I just want to talk to you for

530
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,860
Speaker 1:  hours. You're a full dog with shoes, right? Big speeds. Just wandering

531
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,730
Speaker 1:  around your house. Ties in, is great for you. And the ties and wash will

532
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,550
Speaker 1:  complete the experience. And you're using S health in the Samsung

533
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,000
Speaker 1:  email app. And like, and all that stuff kind of works for you, but you're

534
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,810
Speaker 1:  living a very lonely life. He has, no one else is using those

535
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,470
Speaker 1:  things. And that's fine. I mean, maybe you're just happy alone with

536
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,130
Speaker 1:  Bixby. That means like Samsung's total addressable market for their

537
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,970
Speaker 1:  better hardware is just like small in

538
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,410
Speaker 1:  Google's market is like all of Android, but the products are bad.

539
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,530
Speaker 3:  But, but I mean, when you think about it, what is Android? Especially in

540
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,520
Speaker 3:  the U S sure. What is Android, but Samsung, right? And so like

541
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,940
Speaker 3:  wearables, as we know them in smartwatch sense, the apple

542
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,780
Speaker 3:  watch the ties and watches, things like that. Those are expensive. Add-ons

543
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,530
Speaker 3:  that people buy with expensive phones. Low-cost

544
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,930
Speaker 3:  fitness trackers are a different story, but that's not what we're talking

545
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,990
Speaker 3:  about here. So like, this is like

546
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,680
Speaker 3:  Samsung sells the most Android compatible

547
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,280
Speaker 3:  smartwatches, right? Maybe Fitbit is up there as well, but the, where it

548
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,180
Speaker 3:  Wes wants just don't don't sell it all. And so like,

549
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,990
Speaker 3:  this is Google's opportunity here is to bring where or

550
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,950
Speaker 3:  where, whatever it wants to call it today, to that market of people who are

551
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,340
Speaker 3:  buying Samsung watches, which is a real market, it's not an apple watch market,

552
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,850
Speaker 3:  but it is a real market and bring those Google services and

553
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,840
Speaker 3:  hooks and all that stuff in to it. And then maybe the trickle on

554
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,710
Speaker 3:  effect is if they're not buying a Samsung phone and they have a different

555
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,590
Speaker 3:  Android phone, they can buy this watch. It's got Google's name on it. It's

556
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,070
Speaker 3:  got Google software. They don't need six helper apps. Like if, if you have

557
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,370
Speaker 3:  a pixel right now and pair up a Samsung watch to it, you need to download

558
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,210
Speaker 3:  no lessons, six apps to get every service working on it, which is just

559
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,840
Speaker 3:  like, kind of a wild thing. So you get a better experience on that. But really,

560
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,260
Speaker 3:  I think it is, Google's getting access to this larger market of people who

561
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,150
Speaker 3:  are actually buying these smartwatches.

562
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,930
Speaker 1:  But this brings me to my last kind of big question about this. You've got

563
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,440
Speaker 1:  Samsung making watches that work better across Android. You've got Google

564
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,530
Speaker 1:  making launches using this new operating system that worked

565
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,520
Speaker 1:  better. How much room is left,

566
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,390
Speaker 1:  right? Like we'll fossil compete and like show up and like

567
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,020
Speaker 1:  continue to make these washes. Like, I would like there to be a vibrant

568
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,980
Speaker 1:  ecosystem of competitive smartwatches that run on and are compatible.

569
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,730
Speaker 1:  It has Google services across all these phones, but

570
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,920
Speaker 2:  Right. I think that, that they're walking away from that. They tried that

571
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,880
Speaker 2:  with where ROS and it bombed LG, like couldn't make it only other

572
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,630
Speaker 2:  fossil brands managed to participate. You know, like

573
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:19,110
Speaker 2:  the, the thing to think about here, isn't the smartwatch market in the U

574
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,380
Speaker 2:  S it's like the 80% of all phones on worldwide are

575
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,860
Speaker 2:  Android based on Android. And their smartwatch

576
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,730
Speaker 2:  options are like the, like the weird low-end stuff that you

577
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,240
Speaker 2:  can get from, you know, OnePlus or what's the other one, like a

578
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,930
Speaker 2:  ma or you get a Fitbit

579
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,100
Speaker 2:  or you're, you know, you deal with the, of the Samsung stuff. And

580
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,090
Speaker 2:  so there needs to be a high-end option.

581
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,930
Speaker 2:  And, you know, I would love there to be a big, you know,

582
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,810
Speaker 2:  competing ecosystem of a bunch of different

583
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,710
Speaker 2:  manufacturers fighting to make the best thing. But I would

584
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,670
Speaker 2:  like that for phones too. I would like to have HTC and LG, you

585
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,850
Speaker 2:  know, still in the game, but right now it's like, it's Samsung. And then

586
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,720
Speaker 2:  if you are like, really nerdy, sorry, you get a OnePlus. So you look at the

587
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,680
Speaker 2:  market shares. What plus is just like, especially in the

588
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,970
Speaker 2:  U S

589
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,850
Speaker 2:  so

590
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,200
Speaker 3:  What are most interesting things with this shift is, and I don't

591
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,040
Speaker 3:  remember Sina and wired had some articles where they got to

592
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,050
Speaker 3:  talk to some of the people that were building it. And I don't remember which

593
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,040
Speaker 3:  one said this, but apparently watchmakers will now be able to customize the

594
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,670
Speaker 3:  UI. That's on top of ware, which is a huge departure from

595
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,510
Speaker 3:  how Android were and where ROS were, were basically Google dictated

596
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,500
Speaker 3:  that UI. You could not change it. You could not customize it at all. And

597
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,870
Speaker 3:  every single watch basically looked the same as a result. They could have

598
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,020
Speaker 3:  different watch faces and a couple of different apps, but DUI itself is the

599
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,950
Speaker 3:  same. So now Samsung, who definitely muck with it because they're

600
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,070
Speaker 3:  gonna make it look exactly like their ties and watches. I'm sure fossil,

601
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,430
Speaker 3:  if it wanted to these other manufacturers that maybe they play ball could,

602
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,790
Speaker 3:  you know, customize it and make it a different experience, kind of like what

603
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,850
Speaker 3:  we're seeing with Android phones. And then it begs the question or begins

604
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,780
Speaker 3:  to ask, like, what is the goal in terms of like, what Google wants

605
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,080
Speaker 3:  a smartwatch experience to be, because now hardware partners can dictate

606
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,110
Speaker 3:  a lot of that. So be kind of interesting to see how this shakes out, see

607
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,830
Speaker 3:  what is different between how, where ROS has been, that we've known for a

608
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,730
Speaker 3:  few years now and how this new, where when I suspect we'll see

609
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,280
Speaker 3:  devices in the fall running it.

610
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,160
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Diener, is there a timeline? No,

611
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,760
Speaker 2:  I don't know. Honestly, I think fall is pretty good. I mean,

612
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,940
Speaker 2:  Samsung announced hardware that they're going to have watches. There's rumors

613
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,360
Speaker 2:  that Google's going to do a watch this fall. We've seen

614
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,180
Speaker 2:  renders that, you know, whether or not you believe them is dicey, but they

615
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,920
Speaker 2:  could be accurate. So I do think that it's like, this is the year. And I

616
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,790
Speaker 2:  think that because it's basically where with Samsung, GE

617
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,430
Speaker 2:  being given permission to put whatever Samsung stuff they want to top of

618
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,760
Speaker 2:  it, actually, it's not going to be that hard to get the watch out. Like,

619
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,800
Speaker 2:  I don't think they're making a whole new operating system here. I think it's

620
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,760
Speaker 2:  just where, but faster and less crappy, you know, you can wear

621
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,450
Speaker 2:  on a modern Qualcomm chip. It's like, okay, it's

622
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,300
Speaker 2:  better than its reputation, but there's just not enough to do on it. And

623
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,750
Speaker 2:  it still just feels a little bit incomplete. This feels like more of a complete

624
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,410
Speaker 2:  thought.

625
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,200
Speaker 1:  I think making it feel like more of a complete thought is great. But

626
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,100
Speaker 1:  like, as a person who wears an apple watch everyday, like what do I

627
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,700
Speaker 1:  use it for notifications? The walkie-talkie

628
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,060
Speaker 1:  feature, which is just a real hit in this house. And

629
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,900
Speaker 1:  like, it is the best RSA two factor dongle

630
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,710
Speaker 1:  that you could ever hope for it in your life. Right. Right. That's it

631
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,610
Speaker 1:  like, and like, I keep trying to make it do more things, but

632
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:37,350
Speaker 1:  those things, and obviously that like the fitness tracking, right?

633
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,990
Speaker 1:  Like it just happens to you. And then you're like, I got to close. These

634
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,650
Speaker 1:  rings like great. Yup. That's all stuff that

635
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,610
Speaker 1:  Google and Samsung can compete with in and rebuild. But that

636
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,300
Speaker 1:  like first it needs to be a complete thought that we're iterating on. And

637
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,840
Speaker 1:  like people want to use the features. It doesn't ha I don't think any of

638
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,660
Speaker 1:  these smartwatches need to do much more than that to be

639
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,960
Speaker 1:  compelling, but I just don't think where has gotten anywhere close to it.

640
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,830
Speaker 1:  So we'll see. I just can't get over the leg with our

641
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,400
Speaker 1:  excellent partnership in innovation, in our long track record of

642
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,360
Speaker 1:  partnership. Like I've heard it before, so

643
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,770
Speaker 1:  now they got to actually do it. I know. I mean, I,

644
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,160
Speaker 3:  You know, the cynical end game of this is where

645
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,970
Speaker 3:  becomes Samsung smartwatches. And like, it's

646
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,510
Speaker 3:  just like, that's it. It's just it. No, it's just

647
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:30,200
Speaker 3:  Samsung, like other partners don't sign on board or they give it a college

648
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,190
Speaker 3:  try with one model and then a year later they're gone and it's just, this

649
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,670
Speaker 3:  is what Samsung watches now run. I mean, that, that's, that's an end game

650
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,050
Speaker 3:  that I could very see happening with us.

651
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,110
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Well, I hope it said, okay, we gotta to take a break. That's

652
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:45,950
Speaker 1:  so, well, I hope it's good. We

653
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,650

00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,520
Speaker ?:  real.

699
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,360
Speaker 1:  Okay. Lots of other IO stuff, including like a

700
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,170
Speaker 1:  huge change to Google docs, which are, I mean, our

701
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,980
Speaker 1:  entire business runs on Google docs. So we can talk about this forever, but

702
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,370
Speaker 1:  a big change in how it works. I will say they're adding Google, meet buttons

703
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,120
Speaker 1:  to everything like it's going out of style, which makes me sad, but some

704
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,340
Speaker 1:  cool stuff in docs what's going on there.

705
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,150
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So Google wants to do the thing that Microsoft says is

706
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,150
Speaker 2:  doing with fluid. They want to have all this stuff connect to each other,

707
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,080
Speaker 2:  right? And so their method of doing that is called the smart canvas.

708
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,590
Speaker 2:  And then there are these smart chips. So instead of mentioning somebody in

709
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,190
Speaker 2:  a doc, you can at mention them, you can mention them and add a Google task

710
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,040
Speaker 2:  to them, right in the doc, you can hit the app button and it'll pop up a

711
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,760
Speaker 2:  menu that will fill out a template. That's like ready for meeting notes.

712
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,600
Speaker 2:  You can add, mention other documents in your drive. And that could be

713
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,990
Speaker 2:  either a Google doc or like Microsoft word doc or whatever. And when you

714
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:22,470
Speaker 2:  hover over it, you can get a little preview of it right there in the thing.

715
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,170
Speaker 2:  So they're basically trying to get you to not have to switch

716
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,070
Speaker 2:  tabs and just like, just get rid of

717
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,700
Speaker 2:  tab overload. And this they're doing this with Google chat too, right? Like

718
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,280
Speaker 2:  a bunch of these things you can do inside chat. And now they're gonna let

719
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,060
Speaker 2:  you have chat for you inside the Google doc, or you could do it inside meats

720
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,720
Speaker 2:  or in the Google doc, you can click the meat button to share the, your doc

721
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,150
Speaker 2:  directly to the meeting. So you don't have to worry about screen-sharing

722
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,810
Speaker 2:  and showing the wrong tab or whatever. So they're just basically

723
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,740
Speaker 2:  making everything, do everything, which if they

724
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,040
Speaker 2:  can keep it feeling coherent and understandable is kind of

725
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,640
Speaker 2:  cool, but it's also Casey wrote a good

726
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,510
Speaker 2:  piece. I kind of gestured to this idea. It's a lot like what,

727
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,500
Speaker 2:  like the cooler new office suite site notion or code or whatever

728
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,830
Speaker 2:  we're doing, but Google can't go that fast because they have such a huge

729
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,800
Speaker 2:  user base just like the iPhone, right. They can't change it, bang and do

730
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,100
Speaker 2:  something completely wild. They can't bring back Google wave. So they're

731
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,610
Speaker 2:  doing these sort of baby steps. So that's the feature

732
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,940
Speaker 2:  set. But the, the thing for the first cast to

733
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,840
Speaker 2:  discuss is in order to enable that feature set, they have to

734
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,230
Speaker 2:  use this feature called canvas, which is basically a

735
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,940
Speaker 2:  thing in HTML. You say, there's a canvas here. And

736
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,600
Speaker 2:  then, you know, your web browser like stops paying attention. And then the

737
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,350
Speaker 2:  thing that's inside the canvas is an app. Or like, it's like JavaScript.

738
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,190
Speaker 2:  It's not flash. I mean, maybe it could be who knows, but it basically takes

739
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,070
Speaker 2:  the idea of like using the web technologies. We're used to thinking of as

740
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,590
Speaker 2:  the web HTML CSS, some JavaScript, blah, blah,

741
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:56,450
Speaker 2:  blah. And that like is not used to build this. And so it's no

742
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,290
Speaker 2:  longer in the document object model. It's not in the Dom anymore. And lots

743
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,950
Speaker 2:  of people have emotions about that because if there's any

744
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,920
Speaker 2:  company that could have figured out how to make a kick-ass futuristic web

745
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,500
Speaker 2:  app that interconnects everything together and makes you feel like everything

746
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,280
Speaker 2:  is all, you know, magically jumping from one thing to the next

747
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,850
Speaker 2:  inside web technologies, you'd want it to be Google. And if Google is bailing

748
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,660
Speaker 2:  on it, then that kind of bodes ill for, you

749
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,410
Speaker 2:  know, future of like web stuff. That's like more accessible where you can

750
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,750
Speaker 2:  like inspect source and see what's going on.

751
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,670
Speaker 1:  Wait, so you can't bring it down that simply. So with the

752
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,100
Speaker 1:  new Google docs, you can't just like inspect source and see how the thing

753
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,060
Speaker 1:  works, what you can do with some, but not all like most, but not all

754
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,500
Speaker 1:  web pages right now.

755
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean, basically it's more of a black box. I don't know for sure if

756
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,220
Speaker 2:  like, if you really start pushing out it, if you can like find the link to

757
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,100
Speaker 2:  the web app, that is a, that the canvas is pointing to, and then like, you

758
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,130
Speaker 2:  know, go down the line and Google will tell you everything is open-source

759
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,090
Speaker 2:  all the time. So like, I'm not saying it's unexpectable, but I am saying

760
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,270
Speaker 2:  it's a lot less accessible if that makes sense. Yeah.

761
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:02,020
Speaker 3:  And, and Google said that a lot of like extensions that are built to modify

762
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,010
Speaker 3:  docs. So like a common one might be like a dark mode extension to flip

763
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,460
Speaker 3:  your Google docs into a dark mode. It's probably going to break until they

764
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,920
Speaker 3:  updated to work with this canvas or whatever,

765
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,410
Speaker 1:  Which gives them ultimately more control. Right?

766
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,530
Speaker 2:  Google is going to make this thing extensible so that other, you could like,

767
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,830
Speaker 2:  we could make a verge Google doc thing. So if you type at something in the

768
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:24,700
Speaker 2:  name of an article, it would auto fill the link. Right. That would be cool.

769
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,260
Speaker 2:  That would make making shadows way easier for

770
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,050
Speaker 1:  Me. But

771
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,980
Speaker 2:  For now, the way that most extensions and most like Google doc plugins

772
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,730
Speaker 2:  from third-parties work is they basically inspect source. They go through

773
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,850
Speaker 2:  the Dom and they're like, oh, like change this thing, change it. And then

774
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,310
Speaker 2:  changes it just like you can inspect source yourself to change a headline

775
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,540
Speaker 2:  for a joke screenshot or whatever. And that's going to be harder to do a

776
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,720
Speaker 2:  lot of that stuff might break, but it's not gonna break instantly. A bunch

777
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,930
Speaker 2:  of stuff is still gonna work. It's just like the stuff inside the canvas.

778
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:56,650
Speaker 2:  It's gonna take awhile to shake out, but it's potentially

779
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,520
Speaker 2:  more centralized, you know, control inside Google for API stuff

780
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,230
Speaker 2:  inside their apps.

781
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,770
Speaker 1:  So a lot of their demos were to me, things that

782
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,190
Speaker 1:  seem like great ideas, like they seem like great demos. And then I think

783
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,790
Speaker 1:  about how I actually work. And I, I wonder, right?

784
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,720
Speaker 1:  Like one of their demos was you are writing in a doc

785
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,750
Speaker 1:  or you're working on a spreadsheet and you push a button in the video call

786
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,630
Speaker 1:  starts right in the doc and everyone's already looking at it and the screens

787
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,260
Speaker 1:  are really small and it's all just happening in one place.

788
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,260
Speaker 1:  Right. And you don't have to like switch tasks. You don't have to switch

789
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,310
Speaker 1:  tabs. Yeah. He it, and then you go back to your doc

790
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,230
Speaker 1:  or, I mean, I think you brought this up in your piece,

791
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,810
Speaker 1:  Cedar, like these are kind of like ancient ideas about how to

792
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,770
Speaker 1:  work in docs like documents. Yeah. Like apple had

793
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,340
Speaker 1:  open doc. Microsoft had Ole

794
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,130
Speaker 1:  LA can I just say them?

795
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,870
Speaker 2:  This is a, Vergecast where we have brought up Maemo amigo and open doc. This

796
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,370
Speaker 2:  is just the class it's,

797
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:02,360
Speaker 2:  what's

798
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,350
Speaker 1:  In our feelings. And that technology ideas this time, it's just wild to me.

799
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,680
Speaker 1:  Like these are dreams that have persisted for you years and years and

800
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,100
Speaker 1:  years. And like finally, they can come into

801
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,030
Speaker 1:  reality. I think the pandemic and working from home has made people

802
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:21,020
Speaker 1:  be like, I want to figure out different ways to work with a bunch of

803
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,050
Speaker 1:  people remotely. So there's appetite for

804
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,920
Speaker 1:  change in a way that has not existed before. But really what

805
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,280
Speaker 1:  you're talking about is I want to make a document. I want to embed a table

806
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,210
Speaker 1:  from a spreadsheet. And if somebody else updates that spreadsheet, it all

807
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,990
Speaker 1:  happens. Live in one place. Also that's like wildly accessible to other

808
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:42,560
Speaker 1:  kinds of apps and services. And I'm just logging into like my work

809
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,460
Speaker 1:  dashboard and stuff is happening all the time. And I think that stuff is

810
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,420
Speaker 1:  great. And then I think about how I actually work, which

811
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,320
Speaker 1:  is I need to focus on a single thread and

812
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,100
Speaker 1:  just get through it without being distracted. And then I need to

813
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,340
Speaker 1:  like give that to Dan and be like, edit this review. I'm

814
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,180
Speaker 1:  leaving. And I, and I know that's not how everybody works on there's

815
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,870
Speaker 1:  lots and lots of different ways to work. But like these ideas are like somewhat

816
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,500
Speaker 1:  in conflict. Right. But you want, you perceive a way of

817
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,990
Speaker 1:  working. That is not actually the best,

818
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,700
Speaker 1:  like what most people would call the best way of working, which is like

819
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,200
Speaker 1:  extreme focus.

820
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,040
Speaker 2:  Well, well, I mean, the big question to me is like how

821
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,190
Speaker 2:  much of this is driven by like metrics. I'm not accusing Google of being

822
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,340
Speaker 2:  driven by metrics and like the old joke about, you know, how many thousands

823
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,150
Speaker 2:  of blues they tested, blah, blah, blah, blah. But like if you're

824
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:39,080
Speaker 2:  making an app and you see more use of your app, then that must be

825
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,260
Speaker 2:  good. And so all of this stuff is designed for like real-time interaction

826
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,860
Speaker 2:  and let's say synchronous communication, and like just more, more use the

827
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,680
Speaker 2:  apps more because there's more stuff going on. You're getting more notifications,

828
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,370
Speaker 2:  there's video calls, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But maybe that's not,

829
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,620
Speaker 2:  maybe you should make an app that doesn't need to be used so much because

830
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,560
Speaker 2:  the idea of work is to get it done and move on to the next.

831
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,550
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That's what I mean. It's like, and I recognize that we have very

832
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:05,270
Speaker 1:  strange jobs, right? Like we deliver things that need to be

833
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:09,200
Speaker 1:  finished and then published. And then if we have to change them after published,

834
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,770
Speaker 1:  like there's a process we have to like, yeah, that's all very different

835
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,760
Speaker 1:  for us than other folks in different kinds of industries. But

836
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,710
Speaker 1:  I do think that notion, I mean, this is why when I was doing virtual

837
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,350
Speaker 1:  interviews for song, I'd asked every guest, when do you work? Right. And

838
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:28,190
Speaker 1:  the answers were like, almost always some executive. Like I work in

839
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,150
Speaker 1:  business class flying across the country because the wifi is bad and no one

840
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,210
Speaker 1:  can bother me, which is always my favorite flux of an

841
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,600
Speaker 1:  answer. But I look at this stuff and it's like, oh, this is just allowing

842
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,050
Speaker 1:  more people to interrupt you and get in your way. But it looks really

843
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,920
Speaker 1:  cool. It sounds really cool. And I, I'm just, I think

844
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,770
Speaker 1:  Google like, yep, they've got a big user base. They got it is slow. But I

845
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,950
Speaker 1:  think some of that slowness is going to be helpful to figure out what

846
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,810
Speaker 1:  is useful and what is not. But I don't know, even

847
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,650
Speaker 1:  within our

848
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:59,490
Speaker 3:  Weird way of working, if you pull the staff

849
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,270
Speaker 3:  of writers who work with editors all day long, some of them will be writing

850
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,820
Speaker 3:  in Google docs, but a lot of them will be writing outside of Google docs

851
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,330
Speaker 3:  because they want a thing that does not distract them and they can write

852
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,810
Speaker 3:  it down. And then they literally copy their texts into Google docs, which

853
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,230
Speaker 3:  then gets collaboratively, edited, and then gets copied into our CMS. And

854
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,650
Speaker 3:  there's like this, this process that we have. So it's like,

855
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,550
Speaker 3:  these things that Google's coming out with are all

856
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:27,510
Speaker 3:  focused around immediate collaboration and like

857
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,140
Speaker 3:  real-time collaboration, which is like, like you said, looks really cool

858
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,140
Speaker 3:  in a demo. And it has this like neat idea of all of us. We're all in different

859
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,480
Speaker 3:  places of the world that we're all working on the same thing in the same

860
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,900
Speaker 3:  goal. But how much of that is going to reflect in the reality of how something

861
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,500
Speaker 3:  is put together? I mean, like, I don't know how we integrate this into our

862
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,170
Speaker 3:  workflow. Maybe there's other workflows where it's more obvious.

863
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,860
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I, I don't want to be like too, narrow-minded lots of people

864
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,670
Speaker 1:  work in all kinds of fields. They do need more real-time collaboration. I'm

865
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,490
Speaker 1:  excited for the innovation. I just keep thinking about the fact that I own

866
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:00,120
Speaker 1:  an apple pencil and like all that is

867
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,080
Speaker 1:  easiest for us. My daughter draws on the tablet, like in

868
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,070
Speaker 1:  any demo, no one knows what to do, except circle things on a screen. And

869
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,700
Speaker 1:  like, it just feels like that. Like, man, this is cool. I finally have this

870
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,300
Speaker 1:  thing. I want, boy, it's usefulness to me is extremely

871
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,330
Speaker 1:  limited. We'll see,

872
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,960
Speaker 2:  We shouldn't get off workspace before pointing out that they finally added

873
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,950
Speaker 2:  a page list mode that is responsive. And so the, the document

874
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:29,760
Speaker 2:  will change its width to the width of your window. And not as soon as you're

875
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,630
Speaker 2:  printing it, which is a little bit overdue. And I

876
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,440
Speaker 2:  just want to reiterate that if you are a Google tasks, user

877
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,040
Speaker 2:  a, they haven't given you a website, you can go to, it's still only in a

878
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,030
Speaker 2:  sidebar. And B somebody in your team can add a Google

879
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,660
Speaker 2:  task to your Google tasks from a Google doc. So I am

880
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,600
Speaker 2:  intending on using that in all sorts of terrible ways.

881
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,880
Speaker 5:  That's super fun. I'm

882
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,540
Speaker 3:  Intending on continuing to ignore Google tasks, but they

883
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,750
Speaker 2:  Are normalizing a bunch of stuff. So like the little hover thing for a

884
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,650
Speaker 2:  contact Gmail is going to stop being so broken because they made it, they

885
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,830
Speaker 2:  fixed it for Google docs and they're going to bring that back to Gmail. So

886
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:11,550
Speaker 2:  the thing that strike struck me at the end of all of this was, oh my

887
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,270
Speaker 2:  God, they're doing stuff like they're actually, they have a roadmap and they

888
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,850
Speaker 2:  have a plan and they have a vision for what Google workspace is going to

889
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,570
Speaker 2:  be. And they're actually making products on the path to that

890
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:25,560
Speaker 2:  roadmap. That's a bad metaphor, but they're doing a thing and they

891
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,230
Speaker 2:  have a plan which at Google is

892
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,520
Speaker 2:  common.

893
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:34,190
Speaker 1:  I feel like Google's going to start shipping stuff in docs is

894
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,700
Speaker 1:  actually like the whole story here. But we'll see. Cause it has

895
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,330
Speaker 1:  remained remarkably unchanged for a long time. Okay. Let's round

896
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:45,320
Speaker 1:  out. I there's a bunch of other stuff. And I, it kind

897
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,160
Speaker 1:  of like falls into two categories. One is like Google doing a

898
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,970
Speaker 1:  bunch of demo stuff and then Google doing

899
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,120
Speaker 1:  AI stuff that is associated with controversy. And they're all kind of

900
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,660
Speaker 1:  like demo demo stuff. So just

901
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,650
Speaker 1:  like we could talk about classic. Vergecast like Google photos

902
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,950
Speaker 1:  is dying. We'll take two photos taken around the same

903
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,940
Speaker 1:  time and animate them. So like the question of what is a photo

904
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,840
Speaker 1:  is about to get extremely wild. So you take, let's

905
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,410
Speaker 1:  say you're, I mean their demos, like two, two photos,

906
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,710
Speaker 2:  But Nila, if you take two photos at different times where those photos photos

907
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,380
Speaker 2:  in the first place, weren't they also composites

908
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,770
Speaker 1:  Apparently in the photos are already HDR composites. So they are not single

909
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:30,520
Speaker 1:  moments in time. But then if you think about an animation, animation is frames

910
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,240
Speaker 1:  that when stitched together indicate the passage of time, but now the first

911
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,270
Speaker 1:  photo is actually a slice of time. That is

912
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:41,260
Speaker 1:  interpreted to create the impression of a single moment in time. So

913
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,620
Speaker 1:  as the last frame, and now it is generated multiple frames in

914
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,860
Speaker 1:  between. Yeah. That are moments in time that never

915
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,060
Speaker 1:  existed.

916
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,570
Speaker 2:  Right? Well, they may, they assume that it existed. They're there, they're

917
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:56,320
Speaker 2:  taking a guest that you, you know, you moved your head this way in between

918
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,870
Speaker 2:  those two frames, but they don't know. They're just figuring it out.

919
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,750
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But it's so like, that's crazy. Yeah. This is

920
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,100
Speaker 1:  crazy. I don't know what to say about that. That's an hour of

921
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,000
Speaker 1:  Vergecast asked, like, what is a phone like

922
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,870
Speaker 1:  is one of those middle frames, statistically, it could

923
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:17,470
Speaker 1:  be an accurate representation of that moment in time. Yeah. Maybe at a

924
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:21,370
Speaker 1:  high level, like a high rate of accuracy or

925
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:25,210
Speaker 1:  could not be. So now you have a computer photo.

926
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,110
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

927
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:29,620
Speaker 2:  The whole concept of reality is just a, it's just statistics. Anyway.

928
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,550
Speaker 2:  Statistically, nothing made there or it's not, and it's not actually

929
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:37,420
Speaker 2:  odd off. Yes, no, it's statistics. It's a percentage chance that you exist.

930
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,870
Speaker 2:  And luckily it's a, you know, you're, you're hitting, you're hitting jackpot.

931
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,790
Speaker 2:  Every, every millisecond,

932
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,780
Speaker 1:  Which brings me to quantum

933
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:50,680
Speaker 1:  computing

934
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,670
Speaker 1:  Googled it a whizzbang. And this was like, I didn't think this was a great

935
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:58,180
Speaker 1:  interstitial nephritis, Michael Pena. They had like walked through their

936
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:01,720
Speaker 1:  quantum computing facility. It was very jokey. It's very hard to explain

937
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,410
Speaker 1:  quantum computing. I made this joke in the live blog with this is true. If

938
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:09,010
Speaker 1:  you ever in your life like encounter a quantum computing

939
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:12,880
Speaker 1:  person or like go to their facility within minutes,

940
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,220
Speaker 1:  there'll be like, this is the coldest place in the

941
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:19,090
Speaker 1:  universe because it is the single most relatable

942
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,840
Speaker 1:  thing they can say to you. And it is still insane. Cause

943
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,250
Speaker 1:  otherwise like cubits, here's the deal you're like off to the

944
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,120
Speaker 1:  races. So they're trying to build a quantum computer by 2029. They're actually

945
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,840
Speaker 1:  going to race with Microsoft. They're in a race with IBM. All these companies

946
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,440
Speaker 1:  have different approaches to how to do this thing that they're doing. That

947
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,430
Speaker 1:  they demo this thing called Starline. Yeah, this was wild, which

948
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,580
Speaker 1:  I kind of like don't understand why it's so

949
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,930
Speaker 1:  complicated. So

950
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,060
Speaker 2:  I don't think it's necessarily complicated. I just, that it's a smart thing

951
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,200
Speaker 2:  they made.

952
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,130
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's fine. It's a video conferencing

953
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:59,060
Speaker 1:  booth. So you sit in it there's cameras, there's a 3d display

954
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,210
Speaker 1:  in front of you. But then instead of just like shooting you in sending that

955
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:06,170
Speaker 1:  video signal directly to the other line, booth it constructs a real-time

956
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:09,740
Speaker 1:  3d model of you and then re animates that model on the other

957
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,380
Speaker 1:  side, that's the part where I'm like, why is it so

958
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,370
Speaker 1:  complicated? Because they could just shoot the video of you

959
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:20,210
Speaker 1:  in 3d and send it over there. But they make a volumetric 3d model of

960
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,140
Speaker 1:  you.

961
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,130
Speaker 2:  Right. Maybe it gives you more ability to like move your

962
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:28,550
Speaker 2:  head around a little bit. Maybe it just looks less video, easy to do it that

963
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,370
Speaker 2:  way. Yeah.

964
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,970
Speaker 1:  I'm like bursting with questions cause they showed it off and it looked

965
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:38,660
Speaker 1:  cool. Lauren, good read a great piece of wired about it. She got to experience

966
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,540
Speaker 1:  it. But then they kept saying things like this takes so much

967
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,530
Speaker 1:  data. Yeah. Like gigabytes of data, we had to invent

968
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,590
Speaker 1:  a new compression technology and it's like, why don't you just shoot the

969
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:52,130
Speaker 1:  video? Like they never made that turn for me. Did you hear that? Because

970
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:55,790
Speaker 1:  I never figured out why they need to do all this like volumetric 3d

971
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:59,330
Speaker 1:  rendering instead of just showing 3d video

972
00:54:59,330 --> 00:54:59,900
Speaker 1:  across.

973
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,960
Speaker 2:  Well, because what's, you're looking at on the, in the booth, you're looking

974
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,530
Speaker 2:  at a hologram, right? And th th the reason you can make eye contact is because

975
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:10,010
Speaker 2:  of the, one of the cameras is behind the hologram. And so you're actually

976
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,250
Speaker 2:  looking at a full person, like in

977
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,880
Speaker 2:  3d presented with, you know, hologram technology, not it. And so it's not

978
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,420
Speaker 2:  just a video, it's, it's a real person with like

979
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,200
Speaker 2:  volume right in front of you that, and so

980
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,510
Speaker 2:  could that have been done with a bunch of 3d cameras or did they actually

981
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:30,410
Speaker 2:  need to do like a full bunch of like motion capture, volume metric stuff

982
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,100
Speaker 2:  to like, get that, to have that presence on the other side, I'm

983
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,190
Speaker 2:  guessing they did. Maybe they didn't, but I'm guessing they did. And that's

984
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,760
Speaker 2:  also a lot of data, but that's weird. Cause they, they said like it just

985
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,000
Speaker 2:  worked on like a standard office. They didn't have to run a special fiber

986
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,930
Speaker 2:  over. So there is a lot of compression happening there as well. So

987
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,020
Speaker 2:  to me, the real question is like, how does it actually look in

988
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,800
Speaker 2:  person Lauren? I think it was one of the few people outside of Google to

989
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,860
Speaker 2:  like, be able to describe it. And she said it was very real, but as soon

990
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:01,030
Speaker 2:  as he like moved a little bit to the left or the right, it started to, to

991
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,900
Speaker 2:  break the illusion. Yeah.

992
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,950
Speaker 1:  And another one for the, what is a photo files, right? Like you're looking

993
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,800
Speaker 1:  at a person that is not there. That is a

994
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,760
Speaker 1:  reconstructed volumetric 3d model of a person. But

995
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,820
Speaker 1:  that is reacting in real time to that person's

996
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,300
Speaker 1:  actions. I don't know, man. I got to go lay

997
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,280
Speaker 1:  down. I think Ben

998
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,040
Speaker 1:  Thompson and Stackery referred to it as Google creates new realities. And

999
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,700
Speaker 1:  like here it is. Okay. And then lastly, and this

1000
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,690
Speaker 1:  is Google just charged into this. And I, I

1001
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,900
Speaker 1:  haven't kind of made a mistake. So they announced a bunch of AI stuff that

1002
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,800
Speaker 1:  is at a high level. Very cool. So they announced mom and Lambda

1003
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,790
Speaker 1:  was her new, natural language processing systems. We were

1004
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,490
Speaker 1:  joking before about, I was saying, talking to Dieter, I was like talking

1005
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:52,390
Speaker 1:  to a paper airplane or talking to Pluto. Those were there demos so

1006
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,350
Speaker 1:  that the system can take on the character of

1007
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:00,250
Speaker 1:  a paper airplane, and then sort of converse with you about what

1008
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,490
Speaker 1:  it's like to be a paper airplane, or you can converse with

1009
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:07,240
Speaker 1:  Pluto, which by the way, Sundar and Google just

1010
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,480
Speaker 1:  directly call the planet like 10 times. What was Google

1011
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,200
Speaker 1:  put Google being a planet. I thought that was great. Yeah. I hear me go

1012
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,100
Speaker 1:  Pluto. I'm on team Pluto. Okay. So that's cool. And then they can do

1013
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,000
Speaker 1:  searches with it. They have this thing called multimodal search where

1014
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,780
Speaker 1:  they can understand photos where you can take a picture of your hiking

1015
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,530
Speaker 1:  boots and say, are these boots good for hiking up whatever mountain I'm going

1016
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:33,040
Speaker 1:  to hike up? And that system will understand all of these

1017
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,760
Speaker 1:  things. Okay. Oh, that's in like provide you a

1018
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,660
Speaker 1:  conversational answer. All that's great. All of this is in context

1019
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,840
Speaker 1:  of Google had a team called the ethical AI

1020
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,680
Speaker 1:  team led by a researcher named Tim <inaudible>, who

1021
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,950
Speaker 1:  was writing about how Google's language models

1022
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:54,910
Speaker 1:  had profound racial implications, that there was bias

1023
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,750
Speaker 1:  built into the models because how they collect natural language data to

1024
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,650
Speaker 1:  create the models. She tried to publish this paper. She got into a fight

1025
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,890
Speaker 1:  with Google, she and a bunch of our team word summarily

1026
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:09,550
Speaker 1:  fired that has led to Zoe's uncovering this rest lesson, right?

1027
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,720
Speaker 1:  James Vincent has been covering. He has actually got a great piece about

1028
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,590
Speaker 1:  how, like Google said it IO connects to the controversy and like Google

1029
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:21,280
Speaker 1:  just papered over it. There's no mention of the fact that this is an

1030
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,240
Speaker 1:  internal controversy in Google about whether the

1031
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,930
Speaker 1:  AI teams are acting using correct data sets. The

1032
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:32,830
Speaker 1:  only mention of it was they announced this image processing initiative where

1033
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,470
Speaker 1:  they're going to change some of the camera filters and they've hired a bunch

1034
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,400
Speaker 1:  of experts across fields to make sure the

1035
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,650
Speaker 1:  image data sets are more inclusive. They're literally going to go out and

1036
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,630
Speaker 1:  take photos. But that was it. I didn't catch anything else that you, I

1037
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:45,810
Speaker 1:  think

1038
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:49,650
Speaker 2:  There was a little bit with Landa about needing to be careful with the data

1039
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:53,520
Speaker 2:  sets needed to be responsible with it. But again,

1040
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,580
Speaker 2:  it's like, obviously they've been working on this stuff for forever. It's

1041
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,060
Speaker 2:  unclear how much of the ethical AI team

1042
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,460
Speaker 2:  contributed to it. If that controversy hadn't happened, I guarantee you,

1043
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,580
Speaker 2:  they would have been like, they would have talked about the fact that they

1044
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,400
Speaker 2:  have an ethical AI team and he has a <inaudible> team. They could advise

1045
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,270
Speaker 2:  them on this. It's pretty wild, how they just went for it

1046
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,840
Speaker 2:  with this stuff. And they, they are basically daring

1047
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,830
Speaker 2:  everybody to be like, well, wait a minute. And that's

1048
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:23,150
Speaker 2:  kind of been the reaction. Remember, well they a duplex a few years ago,

1049
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,550
Speaker 2:  whatever it was, we were like, this is amazing. And everyone went, but wait

1050
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:29,240
Speaker 2:  a minute. Yeah. They just walked right into that again. But in a way that

1051
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,140
Speaker 2:  is, I dunno, much more pointed because there's just much more,

1052
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:36,980
Speaker 2:  you know, Google did a lot worse things here than a

1053
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,440
Speaker 2:  duplex. It was just like, oh, you didn't think of it. What the hell with

1054
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,010
Speaker 2:  here? It's like, oh, you fired somebody. What the hell?

1055
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,880
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So James Vincent, who wrote about this for us, he's got a quote

1056
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,780
Speaker 1:  from Emily Bender who coauthored that this paper

1057
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:53,050
Speaker 1:  in the center of the controversy with Tim Nibiru and Margaret Mitchell, one

1058
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,920
Speaker 1:  of the other Google researchers who's fired her quote is from the blog post

1059
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,100
Speaker 1:  discussing Lambda. And given the history, I do not have confidence. Google

1060
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,520
Speaker 1:  has actually been careful about any of the risks we raised in the paper.

1061
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,610
Speaker 1:  For one thing, they fired two of the authors of that paper, nominally over

1062
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,730
Speaker 1:  the paper. So like, there's, there's a

1063
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:13,270
Speaker 1:  big sticky problem for Google here where they've

1064
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:16,990
Speaker 1:  trashed the reputation. They know they have James Dean who runs AI.

1065
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:20,290
Speaker 1:  Google has said it we've reported it. And now they're watching the

1066
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:24,130
Speaker 1:  product or they're talking to the product in a way that is of high

1067
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:27,850
Speaker 1:  strategic importance to them. I honestly do not know how they're going

1068
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:31,750
Speaker 1:  to, how they're going to make that turn. I mean, they're just going to do

1069
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,460
Speaker 1:  it, which is the problem

1070
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,800
Speaker 2:  I was going to say, yeah, I'm just going to power through it. I mean, the

1071
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,980
Speaker 2:  team is still there. It's got a new person in charge. Maybe they can come

1072
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:42,700
Speaker 2:  back from it. But like how hard is hiring over on that

1073
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,510
Speaker 2:  team right now, right? It's not a huge community. And they

1074
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:50,350
Speaker 2:  have trashed the reputation in that community in a way that like isn't, isn't

1075
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,140
Speaker 2:  like has they haven't figured out how to,

1076
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,470
Speaker 1:  I mean, not even a little bit. And we also don't know how much that ethical

1077
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:00,130
Speaker 1:  AI team gets to make calls about what Google's

1078
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:03,040
Speaker 1:  products are. So what I, when I think about Dieter is something you have

1079
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,700
Speaker 1:  mentioned in the context of voice search a million times, right? You ask

1080
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,690
Speaker 1:  a Google home hub or an Alexa, a question you only get one

1081
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,500
Speaker 1:  answer and you get no contextual information about where that

1082
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,310
Speaker 1:  answer came from. You don't get other potential answers or

1083
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:22,270
Speaker 1:  links. You just kind of get told information in Google.

1084
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,900
Speaker 1:  If you look at their presentation across IO, all of their search results

1085
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,470
Speaker 1:  are geared towards giving you the one answer. And they announced some stuff

1086
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:33,340
Speaker 1:  in search about contextual search results and why we're showing this to you.

1087
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,040
Speaker 1:  And they're going to disclose whether things are ads or not more clearly,

1088
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,460
Speaker 1:  which is hilarious because that is totally a problem of their own

1089
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,030
Speaker 1:  making, right? Like they've stuffed so many ads in search results. Now they

1090
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:46,600
Speaker 1:  have to tell you when things aren't ads, but as you go down these AI

1091
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,390
Speaker 1:  roads and you start to say the computer's going to tell you more things,

1092
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:53,200
Speaker 1:  you're gonna take a picture of your shoes and ask the computer. If the

1093
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,620
Speaker 1:  shoes are appropriate to wear, and the computer's gonna tell you an answer,

1094
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,810
Speaker 1:  it's usually a generate an answer and tell it to you like a

1095
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,640
Speaker 1:  person.

1096
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,180
Speaker 2:  And it might, it might involve no, they're not, but you could go buy these

1097
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:07,300
Speaker 2:  shoes. And when you do <inaudible>

1098
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,360
Speaker 1:  Right. I mean, like, there's just like all of these moments now for Google,

1099
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,540
Speaker 1:  where instead of showing you where information might be, they're going to

1100
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:17,080
Speaker 1:  become the provider of it and are obviously trying to automate it. And

1101
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,550
Speaker 1:  like, yeah, if you Google has mostly

1102
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:24,480
Speaker 1:  escaped the Facebook dynamic, right? Like the algorithm is

1103
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,320
Speaker 1:  bad. Facebook dynamic. They definitely, yeah. With YouTube, it's like

1104
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,040
Speaker 1:  absolutely there, but as they start to turn search and maps and all this

1105
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,910
Speaker 1:  other stuff into natural language, single result,

1106
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:39,810
Speaker 1:  AI systems like, woo. Yeah, man, do you need an ethical AI

1107
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:43,530
Speaker 1:  team showing like showing people the work more than

1108
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:47,000
Speaker 1:  ever, because Google is a utility. The way that I think Facebook isn't

1109
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,600
Speaker 2:  Well, and Google is also when you, when it gives you these answers, they're

1110
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,270
Speaker 2:  coming from Google, they might tell you what the source was. But when you

1111
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,690
Speaker 2:  get just one answer the person, the entity, the

1112
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,350
Speaker 2:  responsibility for the accuracy of that answer is going to end up falling

1113
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:03,890
Speaker 2:  on Google in a way, or it has a lot on Facebook, but Facebook can kind

1114
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:07,100
Speaker 2:  of slide around it and say, well, it's our algorithm. It's other people are

1115
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,730
Speaker 2:  other people are posting the misinformation, blah, blah, blah, blah disclosure.

1116
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:14,630
Speaker 2:  My wife works for Facebook. Reality labs used to be called Oculus, et

1117
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:18,500
Speaker 2:  cetera. Yeah. It's going to be a tougher problem in the future for both

1118
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,700
Speaker 2:  companies.

1119
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,240
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I just, it, this, the demos are cool. You should watch them. It's fun

1120
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,810
Speaker 1:  to watch Sundar talking to a planet. It was even, I thought when he

1121
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:30,650
Speaker 1:  showed it braking, that's hilarious where he was like, Pluto's

1122
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:33,680
Speaker 1:  answer was sometimes I play with the moon and it's like, oh, this is how

1123
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,220
Speaker 1:  the world ends. Like the computers get feelings.

1124
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,580
Speaker 1:  They, they, they blow up the moon. But I

1125
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:44,450
Speaker 1:  just, I want to end the IO section on this because it is a huge

1126
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:48,380
Speaker 1:  issue for Google and like, you know, Addie

1127
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,540
Speaker 1:  and I are going to do a whole episode on an apple and epic and competition.

1128
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,980
Speaker 1:  Antitrust. Where is the competition for Google in these

1129
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,940
Speaker 1:  spaces? If Google screws us up, where are you going to go

1130
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:02,810
Speaker 1:  to search for things on the web, a, in a meaningful and realistic way,

1131
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:06,200
Speaker 1:  especially like, it's like, Apple's going to take, it's like stop taking

1132
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,740
Speaker 1:  the Google money. So like, I think the pressure on Google to get this

1133
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,470
Speaker 1:  right is high. It needs to maybe get even

1134
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:16,460
Speaker 1:  higher. Okay. We're gonna take a break. We're gonna come back. We've

1135
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:20,390
Speaker 1:  got some, we got some gadget reviews to talk about. This is a really like

1136
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,160
Speaker 1:  a classic for a chest while we were at

1137
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,640
Speaker 1:  back.

1138
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,830
Speaker ?:  When it comes to tech, you want the latest and greatest, but there's definitely

1139
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,500
Speaker ?:  something to be said for time-tested design that works with everything. And

1140
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,160
Speaker ?:  it will last for years, Baird, Winthrop, CEO, and founder of American

1141
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,490
Speaker ?:  giant grew up with a sweatshirt from the fifties that his father gave him

1142
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:40,130
Speaker ?:  today. It's still in his closet and it looks better than ever. So he set

1143
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:43,790
Speaker ?:  out to recreate a timeless classic. That's the thinking behind the American

1144
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:47,660
Speaker ?:  giant classic full zip hoodie. They obsessed over every detail, both functional

1145
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,050
Speaker ?:  and aesthetic. So you'll be obsessed with it too, but even brought in a formal

1146
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:54,770
Speaker ?:  apple, industrial designer to help perfect. The design American shine hoodies

1147
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:58,190
Speaker ?:  are built with a custom design heavyweight cut and fleece locally grown in

1148
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:01,520
Speaker ?:  sown in North Carolina. And they're made to last with a durable, double lined

1149
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,390
Speaker ?:  hood and reinforced elbow patches. Plus they added side panels for increased

1150
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:08,870
Speaker ?:  mobility and a slim body skimming fit. Most importantly, it's

1151
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:12,020
Speaker ?:  comfortable. American giant is committed to reviving local manufacturing

1152
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,590
Speaker ?:  and they believe that all it takes is one quality piece to set any standard.

1153
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,670

1174
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,330
Speaker 1:  Okay, we're back. Gotta end. Monica reviewed the

1175
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:35,140
Speaker 1:  M one iMac, which is beautiful Dieter year viewed the M

1176
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:38,830
Speaker 1:  one iPad pro. And then I don't even

1177
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:42,580
Speaker 1:  understand this lossless audio thing. Let's start with the

1178
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:45,660
Speaker 1:  tan. Let's start with the iMac. Yeah. The

1179
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,970
Speaker 3:  IMac is finally that redesigned that everyone's

1180
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:51,060
Speaker 1:  Been waiting for a decade. I love it so much. It is very pretty

1181
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,900
Speaker 3:  Comes in a bunch of fun colors. We were able to review and see

1182
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,890
Speaker 3:  the purple one and the orange one, which have dumb marketing names

1183
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:02,880
Speaker 3:  that I can not remember. So you can remind them as purple and orange

1184
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,840
Speaker 3:  sales comes in green and blue and silver and yellow. So if you want a

1185
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,960
Speaker 3:  yellow computer, you can now buy one. But the point is it's basically, if

1186
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,950
Speaker 3:  you took a Mac book pro and one and put it into a desktop

1187
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:17,880
Speaker 3:  chassis with a 24 inch screen, really great speakers, that's what this

1188
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:21,720
Speaker 3:  is. And that's exactly how it functions. It performs. It's got great performance

1189
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,710
Speaker 3:  for everyday work. It's very quiet. It's very quick. It's very responsive.

1190
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:29,340
Speaker 3:  The webcams. Great speaker sound great. The it's got three microphone sound

1191
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:33,150
Speaker 3:  great. So Monica tested it out a bunch with the, for video calling

1192
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:36,120
Speaker 3:  because that's what we're all doing now. And it's a really great video calling

1193
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,110
Speaker 3:  machine, but it's not like the iMac that people who

1194
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:44,040
Speaker 3:  have bought IMAX for the past few years have probably been waiting for it

1195
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,940
Speaker 3:  because the iMac for obviously, since its beginning was like

1196
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,720
Speaker 3:  the family computer, it was a way to get online. Initially it was all in

1197
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,530
Speaker 3:  one, very simple, but as time has gone on and things like the

1198
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:59,100
Speaker 3:  MacBook air have kind of replaced the default computer from

1199
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:02,910
Speaker 3:  desktops, the iMac became more of a focused professional

1200
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:06,420
Speaker 3:  tools. Our video team use design Mac all the time. Lots of creative professionals

1201
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:10,380
Speaker 3:  uses IMAX all the time. This new iMac is not probably the

1202
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:13,280
Speaker 3:  computer for them. They're going to want to wait for something more powerful,

1203
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,000
Speaker 3:  bigger screen, more ports. There's only four ports on this that you can get.

1204
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,630
Speaker 3:  So, but it is kind of the return of the classic Bondi

1205
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:24,040
Speaker 3:  blue iMac that came out in 1998. So actually,

1206
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,950
Speaker 2:  I, I think you're wrong that this isn't something that people are waiting

1207
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:30,130
Speaker 2:  for. My parents bought an iMac in the pandemic cause they just want, they

1208
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:32,710
Speaker 2:  needed a desktop. They needed a bigger screen and they wanted to make video

1209
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:36,670
Speaker 2:  calls a bit easier in a format they're familiar with because figuring

1210
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:40,570
Speaker 2:  out the Facebook portal is a nightmare. And

1211
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:44,380
Speaker 2:  so like I'm a little bit bummed that like they don't have this

1212
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,930
Speaker 2:  computer because it would be so much happier with it. It's lighter. They

1213
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:49,420
Speaker 2:  could like they could move it around, stick it on the kitchen table if they

1214
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:52,780
Speaker 2:  wanted to. I think the computer is great.

1215
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's a great computer. Yeah, for sure. But like for the audience that's

1216
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,870
Speaker 3:  listening to the Vergecast for the audience that reads the verge reviews.

1217
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:01,690
Speaker 3:  They probably, it's probably not the computer for them. It's not the right

1218
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:05,620
Speaker 3:  computer for me. I like a 24 inch screen. It's like, hi

1219
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,330
Speaker 3:  Lauren.

1220
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,290
Speaker 2:  I would, the first,

1221
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:11,410
Speaker 3:  If I had this computer on my desk, the first thing I would do is stick a

1222
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:15,190
Speaker 3:  Thunderbolt dock into the back of it. So I could actually have functional

1223
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:18,790
Speaker 3:  and do what I want to do. So like, it's, it's the computer for someone who

1224
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:22,450
Speaker 3:  cares about that stuff. But for some people like your parents, Cedar, or

1225
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:26,140
Speaker 3:  like for people who are not, you know, that, you know, you care about it.

1226
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:29,080
Speaker 3:  It's, it's, it's a great functional computer that they can literally put

1227
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,690
Speaker 3:  down on a desk and not worry about it for like five to 10 years, which was

1228
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,580
Speaker 3:  like the dream of the iMac. Yeah.

1229
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:36,640
Speaker 1:  I mean, I dunno, we kind of, when these were announced, we kind of poked

1230
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,670
Speaker 1:  around to the idea of like, did you know everybody was going to work from

1231
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:42,550
Speaker 1:  home and then you had an M one ship. So you made like a fun, colorful, good

1232
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:45,580
Speaker 1:  work from home. And like, the response was like, man, we wish we were that

1233
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,100
Speaker 1:  good. Right? Like, yeah. But they have hit a

1234
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,010
Speaker 1:  moment where a lot of people are reconsidering. How,

1235
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:55,330
Speaker 1:  when they're going to work, a lot of people are like, oh, I, I want to have

1236
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:58,000
Speaker 1:  like a nice home office situation. I'm not going to go in the office that

1237
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,390
Speaker 1:  this computer is perfect for that. Like, they're going to sell so many of

1238
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:05,110
Speaker 1:  these. So, so, so many of these, and it's also like a brand new

1239
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:08,950
Speaker 1:  five nanometer chip. The <inaudible> on a new process at apple

1240
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:12,700
Speaker 1:  controls all the supply too. So there'll be no chip shortage

1241
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,390
Speaker 1:  whatsoever. It's like, well, there might be some

1242
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:20,140
Speaker 1:  actually apple. It might be, they might be running. But like

1243
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:24,130
Speaker 1:  just in terms of media, like your plan meeting a

1244
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:28,000
Speaker 1:  moment and like having that moment kind of be perfect. I

1245
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,630
Speaker 1:  think they've, they've nailed it for a huge class of

1246
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:34,810
Speaker 1:  people that is reconsidering. Whether they're going to go back to an

1247
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:38,590
Speaker 1:  office. And like, I think if you, if you're not like I

1248
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:42,520
Speaker 1:  cannot recommend enough. If you have a laptop, get an external display

1249
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:46,510
Speaker 1:  and a keyboard and just tilt your head up, like, don't look down at

1250
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:50,230
Speaker 1:  your laptop all day, just like sit up and look straight. And if you are in

1251
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:53,920
Speaker 1:  the market for a new computer, like maybe you don't want your laptop to

1252
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,850
Speaker 1:  follow you around the house and make you work all of the time. Maybe like

1253
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:01,030
Speaker 1:  work should stay in a room. And like, I don't know. I think the

1254
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:04,330
Speaker 1:  <inaudible> power thing, like how powerful is this computer

1255
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:08,050
Speaker 1:  really? I mean, I want to, I want to wait for a bigger screen and a

1256
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:11,920
Speaker 1:  faster computer, but most people are looking at 13 inch laptop screens. There's

1257
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,510
Speaker 1:  just a part of me. It's like apple nail it. So completely this computer that

1258
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:18,620
Speaker 1:  I want to get one, just to have it, even though I don't need it. You and

1259
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:21,500
Speaker 3:  Your kitchen, that's where apple wants you to put it in the kitchen. Yeah.

1260
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,460
Speaker 3:  Cause your work will follow

1261
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:26,180
Speaker 1:  You into it. I do. Why don't they do that? Why

1262
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,870
Speaker 1:  didn't they, this goes into the iPad, but why didn't they do the CenterStage

1263
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:33,530
Speaker 1:  video calling thing with this? It's very odd. Honestly.

1264
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:36,890
Speaker 3:  I have no idea. It's got a great image sensor in there. It's 10

1265
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:40,700
Speaker 3:  ADP from seven 20. Now Monica did like, if you watch the video, she

1266
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:44,120
Speaker 3:  compares it directly to the camera. That's in the M one Mac book pro and

1267
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,660
Speaker 1:  It is night and day. You know,

1268
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:48,230
Speaker 1:  obviously

1269
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:51,050
Speaker 3:  It's not going to compare it to like setting up your own rig with a mirrorless

1270
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,930
Speaker 3:  camera and all this other stuff that people have done over the past year.

1271
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:57,500
Speaker 3:  But just compared to like what it was before, it is much better experience

1272
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,820
Speaker 3:  in terms of video. Yeah.

1273
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:02,210
Speaker 2:  I think the answer to center stage is the same reason. It's the same answer

1274
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:05,000
Speaker 2:  is why they didn't put a face ID on the iMac. It's just, it's a lot of work

1275
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,810
Speaker 2:  to recreate that stuff on the Mac. And I don't know if they can run iPad

1276
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:12,680
Speaker 2:  out. So apparently I can't run that yet and they just don't

1277
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,930
Speaker 2:  want to do it. Mac

1278
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,680
Speaker 3:  Is scary and dangerous. That's why, oh

1279
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,270
Speaker 3:  yeah.

1280
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:23,360
Speaker 1:  Monica says speakers are good. This is probably as good a place as any to

1281
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,770
Speaker 1:  talk about Atmos and

1282
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:27,410
Speaker 1:  lossless,

1283
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,270
Speaker 2:  I don't know, like it supports

1284
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:32,900
Speaker 1:  Dolby Atmos with spatial audio, apple music just rolled

1285
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:36,680
Speaker 1:  out like just this extremely

1286
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:40,670
Speaker 1:  complicated lossless audio plan. Yeah. Yeah. So there

1287
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:44,000
Speaker 1:  you can get, it's not gonna cost anyone anymore. So the complexity is like,

1288
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,540
Speaker 1:  whatever, but there's two different things happening at

1289
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:51,530
Speaker 1:  once. One is what should

1290
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:55,310
Speaker 1:  be the more straightforward thing is the quality

1291
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:59,150
Speaker 1:  levels of apple music are rising. So now

1292
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:03,020
Speaker 1:  instead of wherever they were at compressed AAC,

1293
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:06,140
Speaker 1:  you can now get lossless apple

1294
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:10,070
Speaker 1:  music that comes in two different quality tiers. Dan,

1295
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:11,630
Speaker 1:  am I correct about this?

1296
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:15,500
Speaker 3:  So there's a lossless and then there's high Def lossless

1297
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:20,450
Speaker 3:  okay.

1298
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:23,930
Speaker 1:  So there's two tracks here. One is like

1299
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:27,530
Speaker 1:  existing apple music is going to be higher quality. And that

1300
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:31,370
Speaker 1:  is very complicated. It involves a

1301
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:34,370
Speaker 1:  lot of Apple's own hardware, not supporting anything.

1302
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:38,240
Speaker 1:  So at the base level,

1303
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:41,630
Speaker 1:  apple is going to support CD quality audio, which is hilarious to

1304
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:45,620
Speaker 1:  me because everyone is always talking about CD quality audio, but

1305
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:49,550
Speaker 1:  like CDs came out 30 years ago. That was, we got, we gotta be able to

1306
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:53,450
Speaker 1:  do better than like one obstacle disc format, but CD quality audio is

1307
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:57,410
Speaker 1:  16 bit at 44.1, kilo Hertz. Those are the numbers that you can fall

1308
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:59,900
Speaker 1:  down the rabbit hole, those numbers if you want. But those are the numbers

1309
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:03,620
Speaker 1:  that indicate CD quality audio then on apple devices,

1310
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:06,830
Speaker 1:  but by apple devices, we mean Macs and iOS

1311
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:10,580
Speaker 1:  devices. Not anything else. That's a big point on

1312
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,230
Speaker 1:  apple devices. You can get 24 bit at 48 kilo

1313
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:18,160
Speaker 1:  Hertz, which is a good and meaningful step up. Then

1314
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,460
Speaker 1:  you can also further go to 24 bit at 192 kilo

1315
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:25,060
Speaker 1:  Hertz. If you have an external USB digital audio

1316
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,690
Speaker 1:  converter, which is like another box you have to buy. And he plugs fancy

1317
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,350
Speaker 1:  headphones into that. So like at the top level of apple

1318
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:36,280
Speaker 1:  music, you need to buy a piece of non-Apple hardware at the

1319
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,090
Speaker 1:  middle level of apple music. You can use your

1320
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:43,720
Speaker 1:  phone or your Mac to listen to

1321
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,680
Speaker 1:  it probably over the built-in speakers because the phones

1322
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:51,610
Speaker 1:  don't have had fun jacks. Yeah. And you can't

1323
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:55,210
Speaker 1:  listen to any of this. If you have

1324
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:58,750
Speaker 1:  Apple's headphones, if you have AirPods or AirPods max or AirPods

1325
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,640
Speaker 1:  pro

1326
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,600
Speaker 3:  It gets more complicated than that. Because the thing that apple says is

1327
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,410
Speaker 3:  they that, so the, that highest tier where you need that external

1328
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:11,340
Speaker 3:  hardware, you cannot listen to that with AirPods max or home

1329
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:15,300
Speaker 3:  pods full stop, right? That lossless tier before you get to that

1330
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,140
Speaker 3:  highest tier is not called lossless. When you are

1331
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,040
Speaker 3:  listening through AirPods max, whether you're doing it wired or

1332
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,880
Speaker 3:  wireless, and apple says, this is because what happens is the

1333
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,390
Speaker 3:  audio is converted into analog. Then it's re

1334
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:34,200
Speaker 3:  digitized for the AirPods max, because they do not

1335
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,620
Speaker 3:  have an analog to digital converter. And so it's, it's,

1336
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:41,490
Speaker 3:  it's digital goes to analog, becomes digital again, when it

1337
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:44,820
Speaker 3:  hits your ear, before it goes to your ears where it comes out of the speakers

1338
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:48,660
Speaker 3:  or whatever that can last conversion means that apple can't

1339
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:52,380
Speaker 3:  call it lossless because it is not the,

1340
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,890
Speaker 2:  Because the AirPods are themselves. Ear pods are shaping the music themselves,

1341
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:59,280
Speaker 2:  right. They got their own algorithms for shaping music,

1342
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,790
Speaker 3:  Right. But the 24 bit 48 kilohertz signal comes

1343
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:06,510
Speaker 3:  in, gets converted. And then it gets reconverted back into

1344
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:10,320
Speaker 3:  24 bit 48 kilohertz. So it's like, that level is still

1345
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,320
Speaker 3:  maintained, but it can't be called lossless because of the number of times

1346
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,920
Speaker 3:  the conversion. So it is like kind of this wonky thing that the

1347
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,760
Speaker 3:  gist of it all is it'll probably sound great. It's

1348
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,750
Speaker 3:  going to sound great in your AirPods, max. But like you can't

1349
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,210
Speaker 3:  say I've got lossless in my ears.

1350
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:30,810
Speaker 1:  I will save apple for years, said nobody could hear this stuff and it wasn't

1351
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:34,680
Speaker 1:  worth it. And now they're like, they're in it.

1352
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,980
Speaker 1:  Right. And I think that's because we expect Spotify is going to do it app

1353
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:41,190
Speaker 1:  Amazon music the same day announced they're dropping the price of Amazon

1354
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:45,090
Speaker 1:  music HD something happened. Yeah. Right? Like there was a smoke

1355
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:48,040
Speaker 1:  filled zoom with the music industry

1356
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,730
Speaker 2:  And they're like, we're doing it. There was like a bug in the app where you

1357
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:53,970
Speaker 2:  could like see a Hi-Fi option, appear Criswell, found it on Reddit and found

1358
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:57,660
Speaker 2:  it and like confirmed it on his own phone. Here's the thing. I mean,

1359
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:01,380
Speaker 2:  one, the let's just talk about the fact that apple and

1360
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:05,160
Speaker 2:  Amazon giant tech behemoths with piles of cash to

1361
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,900
Speaker 2:  burn are offering this for free. When we think Amazon or

1362
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,380
Speaker 2:  Spotify is going to have to charge more that's that's thing. One thing

1363
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,220
Speaker 2:  too. I know there's a lot of people

1364
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:20,090
Speaker 2:  defending or explaining why the AirPods max can't do it. And

1365
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:22,280
Speaker 2:  like, you know, you don't understand audio and this is why they can't do

1366
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,850
Speaker 2:  it, whatever. But I don't know apple chose to make the AirPods

1367
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:29,690
Speaker 2:  max. They, they released them. Not that long ago. Presumably

1368
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:33,620
Speaker 2:  somebody in the AirPods max team could have wandered over to the apple

1369
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:36,590
Speaker 2:  music team and said, Hey, what are you working on? I know that apple is very

1370
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,440
Speaker 2:  silent.

1371
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,620
Speaker 1:  Come on. Dan is describing, is the wired

1372
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:45,220
Speaker 1:  mode, right? Where to get audio to your computer, you got

1373
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:48,490
Speaker 1:  to do a da, a digital to analog

1374
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:52,480
Speaker 1:  conversion with a phone that happens in the lightning adapter, right?

1375
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,940
Speaker 1:  That's why you get an analog audio Jack. And then you plug it in and the

1376
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,850
Speaker 1:  AirPods convert it wirelessly the AirPods,

1377
01:17:57,850 --> 01:18:01,450
Speaker 1:  max that's Bluetooth and apple doesn't support any

1378
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:04,720
Speaker 1:  lossless protocol over Bluetooth. Like it is necessarily

1379
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,530
Speaker 1:  compressed. So when you're like the AirPods max team knew not only did they

1380
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:12,430
Speaker 1:  probably know it was happening down the line with apple music, they

1381
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:16,330
Speaker 1:  knew right from the start that the only Bluetooth Kodak

1382
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:20,260
Speaker 1:  that they were supporting was like limited. And they didn't build it headroom

1383
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,480
Speaker 1:  into the system. Could all this change

1384
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,440
Speaker 1:  WWDC, could they add a Bluetooth codec to

1385
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,680
Speaker 1:  iOS, to the iPhone? Could they update the w one?

1386
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,050
Speaker 1:  Like maybe,

1387
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:35,380
Speaker 2:  But then why? Why, why announced it? Why not for now? Yeah,

1388
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:39,220
Speaker 1:  Because the music industry all got together and like you're doing it tomorrow.

1389
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,840
Speaker 1:  My face

1390
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:44,530
Speaker 2:  Favorite reaction to all of this is for years and years, Apple's like, this

1391
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:46,510
Speaker 2:  doesn't matter. Nobody can hear it. A bunch of audit. People are like, no,

1392
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:50,020
Speaker 2:  it matters. And now apple announced it at a bunch of audio. People are like,

1393
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,260
Speaker 2:  it doesn't matter. Nobody can hear this. It's like completely

1394
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,610
Speaker 2:  flipped.

1395
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:58,000
Speaker 1:  So we still have a lot of questions on Sono

1396
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,690
Speaker 1:  support, airplay support, like many, many questions to be

1397
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:05,680
Speaker 1:  answered. None of Apple's pages make any of this particularly clear. We got

1398
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,430
Speaker 1:  to figure that out. That is just one track of the apple

1399
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,280
Speaker 1:  music chaos. And that I promise you is the

1400
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,200
Speaker 1:  simpler set of problems to solve because all you're

1401
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,130
Speaker 1:  doing is taking, you're taking the existing music library and

1402
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:25,000
Speaker 1:  that you're compressing it. Or in some cases you're encoding it differently.

1403
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,960
Speaker 1:  Right? You're you've got stereo audio, two channels. You've

1404
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,380
Speaker 1:  got a master version of it somewhere that's uncompressed. And you're going

1405
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:36,370
Speaker 1:  to encode it into one of the many formats and like ship it out over the

1406
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:40,150
Speaker 1:  internet. It, some complicated scheme

1407
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:43,900
Speaker 1:  will eventually make sense. They're also announcing

1408
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,290
Speaker 1:  support for Dolby, Atmos and spatial audio, which

1409
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:51,280
Speaker 1:  requires a new library of music that has been

1410
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:55,210
Speaker 1:  re mixed for. Yes. And there is even

1411
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:59,020
Speaker 1:  less information about that. And the only thing I ever think about when

1412
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,560
Speaker 1:  I, and it's a different format than Amazon and Sony, which are using

1413
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,490
Speaker 1:  like, what's it called Dan some Sony, well,

1414
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:10,380
Speaker 3:  Sony 360 reality. Amazon's actually the one in-between

1415
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,090
Speaker 3:  who supports both Atmos and

1416
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:15,830
Speaker 1:  Threats. I think Amazon music is do is 360 reality and not

1417
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,360
Speaker 1:  Atmos. I

1418
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,050
Speaker 3:  Think it's, I think it's actually both. I mean, I, I could be

1419
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:24,920
Speaker 3:  wrong, but if I remember correctly, the studio it's both, but you,

1420
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,370
Speaker 3:  you won't know really which one it is when it, when you're playing it. Like

1421
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:29,300
Speaker 3:  it's just one.

1422
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,670
Speaker 1:  Anyhow. All I remember is when you reviewed the echo

1423
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:35,540
Speaker 1:  studio, you discovered the tracks had had

1424
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:39,290
Speaker 1:  instruments added onto them to make them sound more

1425
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:43,010
Speaker 1:  3d. And literally no one tell the story. I don't think

1426
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:46,340
Speaker 1:  anyone has ever explained to us what exactly happened. Yeah.

1427
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:50,240
Speaker 3:  So I'm, I'm testing out. This was a couple of years ago at the echo studio

1428
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,990
Speaker 3:  came out, Amazon rolled out its 3d music support with the echo

1429
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:56,930
Speaker 3:  studio that was like their product to showcase it on. And there were like,

1430
01:20:56,930 --> 01:21:00,140
Speaker 3:  I don't know, 10 tracks that I could test it with. One of them happened to

1431
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:04,070
Speaker 3:  be Cameron's oh boy. From 2002. So of

1432
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:07,880
Speaker 3:  course I'm listening to that a bunch and I'm listening to it in stereo mode

1433
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:11,330
Speaker 3:  and I'm listening to in a 3d mode. And I realized that when I'm in 3d mode,

1434
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:15,200
Speaker 3:  there's this whole orchestra of strings in the song

1435
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,920
Speaker 3:  that don't exist in stereo mode. And like

1436
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,610
Speaker 3:  this just, just out of nowhere. And so we get comment on it

1437
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:26,030
Speaker 3:  from Amazon. Amazon's like, you know, studios can choose to

1438
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:29,480
Speaker 3:  add things to the songs. However they feel fit or

1439
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:33,440
Speaker 3:  whatever we tweet about this. It goes out on Twitter, Jonathan, from

1440
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,530
Speaker 3:  boy genius who worked in the music industry for a long time, has a lot of

1441
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:39,920
Speaker 3:  connections. There happens to know just blaze. It's

1442
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,790
Speaker 3:  like, look what they did to your song.

1443
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,970
Speaker 3:  And just places like

1444
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:50,930
Speaker 1:  She's on and paid for this. I don't know. Oh, by the way, the,

1445
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:54,650
Speaker 1:  you are correct. The echo studio supports both and Amazon, Amazon music

1446
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:58,550
Speaker 1:  HD is Atmos, not 360 reality audio. I don't know

1447
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:02,150
Speaker 1:  all these are bad names. My point is, if you think the chaos and

1448
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:06,080
Speaker 1:  confusion of lossless format support is not

1449
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,140
Speaker 1:  just wait until artists are like, I remade this in

1450
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:12,830
Speaker 1:  Atmos and you're like, great. I'm going to turn my head and listen for

1451
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:16,580
Speaker 1:  stuff. Then they realize there's nothing to hear back there

1452
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:20,360
Speaker 1:  because they recorded in stereo. And they're like, what if we put some strings

1453
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:24,200
Speaker 1:  in this? Because that's what they're gonna do.

1454
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,600
Speaker 1:  I just don't know why I, this is the one

1455
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,240
Speaker 1:  where the music industry for

1456
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,990
Speaker 1:  years, like their entire revenue model was format

1457
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:36,650
Speaker 1:  shifting. Yeah. You know, like Google it. So they would sell you for years,

1458
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:40,520
Speaker 1:  dark side of the moon by pink. Floyd was like the best selling album in the

1459
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:44,450
Speaker 1:  world. And it's because every couple of years you would go from eight tracks

1460
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:48,410
Speaker 1:  to cassettes, to vinyl, to CDs. And everybody would just ribeye dark

1461
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:52,370
Speaker 1:  side of the moon because you could hear it, you know, like

1462
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:56,360
Speaker 1:  yeah. Like smoke weed and what it was, it was the

1463
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,540
Speaker 1:  wizard of Oz. Yeah. So everyone is like, everyone's like hitting play on

1464
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,880
Speaker 1:  the eight track player and watching the wizard of Oz. And you're like, oh,

1465
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,520
Speaker 1:  I got to buy this on the CD. When they have some real, they don't have shifting

1466
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,220
Speaker 1:  anymore. It's just streaming. So this is like an obvious attempt to do a

1467
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,060
Speaker 1:  format shift, but they didn't raise the prices. So I've

1468
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:16,690
Speaker 1:  no idea what the point of this is. And then on the other side, the music

1469
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:20,050
Speaker 1:  industry, everybody, all the new artists are just trying to make Tik TOK

1470
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:23,860
Speaker 1:  beats. Yeah. Like half of the music industry is like, the songs need to

1471
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:27,160
Speaker 1:  be one minute long and have a clear hook that you can dance to. And we're

1472
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:30,160
Speaker 1:  going to master it for phones. And the other half the music industry, it's

1473
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,460
Speaker 1:  like, we're adding strings to Cameron. So people will buy new

1474
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:37,090
Speaker 1:  speakers. And it just doesn't seem like a

1475
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:40,720
Speaker 1:  strategy to me

1476
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,780
Speaker 3:  Anyhow, but will there be strings the tick-tock beats

1477
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:46,990
Speaker 1:  There's always strings than tech sock beats. You got to get the woes man,

1478
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:50,500
Speaker 1:  look, read our record desktop interview. I think my favorite thing that we

1479
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,920
Speaker 1:  published last year, I talk about our Ricky desktop profile so

1480
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,640
Speaker 1:  much. Okay. Speaking of speakers, the

1481
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,970
Speaker 1:  iPad pro has four of them. Hi. Yeah. It was really

1482
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:04,740
Speaker 1:  good. It was great, right? Yeah.

1483
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,640
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So I reviewed the iPad pro the, the, the 12.9

1484
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,480
Speaker 2:  and 11. I did not deeply test spatial audio

1485
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,750
Speaker 2:  because it's the same as before. In fact, a lot of this stuff on these iPads

1486
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,510
Speaker 2:  at the same as before, the things that are new are center stage, which we

1487
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:21,930
Speaker 2:  discussed, you can follow you around and M one ship. And the

1488
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:25,770
Speaker 2:  12.9 has a mini led display that is called the

1489
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:29,490
Speaker 2:  liquid retina. XDR I believe

1490
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:32,860
Speaker 2:  is the name of that display. And when you want it

1491
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,880
Speaker 2:  liquid liquid right next year,

1492
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,000
Speaker 1:  Well, we got to talk about display. So in the review,

1493
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,990
Speaker 1:  you, I mean, the interview pointed out how it works. It's got

1494
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:46,830
Speaker 1:  this huge grid of micro led. Backlights 10,000 as we

1495
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:49,290
Speaker 1:  were talking about it, I was like, you got to run a blooming test because

1496
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:52,590
Speaker 1:  I'm a gigantic display nerd. Yeah. And that is the first thing I thought

1497
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:55,440
Speaker 1:  of. It seemed like it did pretty okay. On those tests.

1498
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think it did fine. Like you could see it, you can see a little blooming

1499
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,350
Speaker 2:  around the little, you know, square dot, moving around the screen. But I

1500
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:04,410
Speaker 2:  haven't personally reviewed a bunch of all the TVs. I've obviously looked

1501
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:07,380
Speaker 2:  at all the TVs. I don't currently own one, but blooming is

1502
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:11,100
Speaker 2:  unavoidable. They've got 2,500 local dimming zones, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1503
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:14,400
Speaker 2:  But that's just there. But when you're actually watching a movie or looking

1504
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,090
Speaker 2:  at an HDR photo, you just don't see it. And to be clear, you should know

1505
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:21,840
Speaker 2:  that the brightness on the screen is specifically for full screen

1506
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,680
Speaker 2:  application. So you need to go full screen in a video or in a photo

1507
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:29,430
Speaker 2:  for it to kick in the extreme HDR that can

1508
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:33,330
Speaker 2:  peak at 1600 nets and have an overall screen brightness of a thousand minutes.

1509
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:36,390
Speaker 3:  Does it do the thing that the iPhone does when you're watching HDR where

1510
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:40,320
Speaker 3:  it like actually visibly shifts over into HDR mode? Yeah.

1511
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:40,470
Speaker 3:  And

1512
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:44,280
Speaker 2:  It's great. I'm sorry. It's fricking great. Yeah.

1513
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:48,240
Speaker 2:  The, the, the blacks are black. Everything looks amazing. Colors feel more

1514
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,840
Speaker 2:  accurate because there's actually detailed the texture that is lost in a

1515
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,590
Speaker 2:  traditional backlight system. The screen, when you're like

1516
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:58,980
Speaker 2:  watching movies is incredible. It's so

1517
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,700
Speaker 2:  good. Is that worth the extra money? That is, that is between you

1518
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:06,290
Speaker 2:  and bank account to

1519
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:06,830
Speaker 2:  me

1520
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:10,010
Speaker 3:  Because the extra money is it's, it's a hundred dollars more than it was

1521
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,180
Speaker 3:  last year. Right? Like that's the

1522
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,430
Speaker 2:  Extra one. If they had this thing on the 11 inch out of I'd have bought it

1523
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:17,400
Speaker 2:  by now, I prefer the 11 inch size on the iPad pro. But yeah, I,

1524
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,200
Speaker 2:  I wanna like, just, just cause I have no idea why they

1525
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,350
Speaker 2:  didn't is it too expensive? Do they want to keep the iPad pro but cheaper,

1526
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:27,950
Speaker 2:  not ha not able to make enough components to fit into both unclear,

1527
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:31,820
Speaker 2:  unknown. So let's the screen. I did run into one weird thing

1528
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:35,510
Speaker 2:  where in dark mode in ebook apps, there's like more than

1529
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:39,470
Speaker 2:  blooming behind it. It's like kind of lit up like big gray

1530
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:43,190
Speaker 2:  squares. You will not see it unless you're in like a pitchback room reading

1531
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:46,220
Speaker 2:  at night, you just won't. But when you see it, you're like, what the hell

1532
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:49,790
Speaker 2:  is that? And it's actually distracting enough to like, have put me off, wanting

1533
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:53,720
Speaker 2:  to use it, to read at night with it,

1534
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,700
Speaker 2:  but eating any amount of light at all in the room. And it basically disappears.

1535
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:01,300
Speaker 1:  It's. I mean, I'm assuming there's like a very complicated backlight controller

1536
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:04,030
Speaker 1:  that is just being confused by big blocks of text.

1537
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:06,970
Speaker 2:  Well, I will tell you though, it's like, it's not just blocks of texts. Like

1538
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:09,970
Speaker 2:  in, in, in I books, there's like a page

1539
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:13,660
Speaker 2:  number, page two, just all by itself, down in the

1540
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:17,560
Speaker 2:  bottom of the less left-hand page and nothing else near it. And

1541
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,520
Speaker 2:  it had a, like two by two inch square of gray around it for that

1542
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,890
Speaker 2:  for one digit.

1543
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:25,720
Speaker 1:  Huh? Apple saying anything about this

1544
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,030
Speaker 2:  That they, they, they did

1545
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:32,410
Speaker 2:  not.

1546
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:34,900
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Sometimes I'll need to review things. I find vice and they're like,

1547
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,700
Speaker 1:  yeah, well we'll get back to you.

1548
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,730
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think they're, they're still investigating.

1549
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:43,720
Speaker 1:  Okay. Well, I think if you think about that 10,000 micro led

1550
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,650
Speaker 1:  grid, it is basically just a second lower resolution

1551
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:51,160
Speaker 1:  display, like a lower resolution, black and white display

1552
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,060
Speaker 1:  behind the, the main color display. Yeah. And

1553
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:58,960
Speaker 1:  so, I mean, we've seen this demo at CS however many times,

1554
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,590
Speaker 1:  but like the TV demo, when they show you local dinning,

1555
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:05,620
Speaker 1:  LCDs is they show you each layer of the TV

1556
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:09,580
Speaker 1:  operating. Yep. And so the local dimming one is like, they show you the person

1557
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:12,940
Speaker 1:  walking across the screen. And then there's like a blockier led person walking

1558
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:16,840
Speaker 1:  across the street. Right. And like, it like that display controller and

1559
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,710
Speaker 1:  how fast it works and how responsible is like, it's a significant

1560
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:23,860
Speaker 1:  engineering project. And it feels like there's probably a display controller

1561
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:27,760
Speaker 1:  software update that needs to come. Yeah. By the way, I was

1562
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,120
Speaker 1:  thinking about this, cause you said the yellow color thing and it occurred

1563
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:34,960
Speaker 1:  to me. I just Googled this. This is probably wrong. But a

1564
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,290
Speaker 1:  lot of the way you perceive brightness is based on the green

1565
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:42,190
Speaker 1:  channel, which is why PenTile screens have more green pixels

1566
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:45,370
Speaker 1:  because they can look brighter. Right. I think yellow is like one of the

1567
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:49,030
Speaker 1:  weird ones. So now that you've got like a better backlight, you can actually

1568
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:51,760
Speaker 1:  perceive different. Cause you call that yellow specifically. I've been thinking

1569
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,150
Speaker 1:  about it ever since they're like yellow is one of the weirder like harder

1570
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:58,810
Speaker 1:  ones. So you've got a backlight technology that can make the yellows brighter

1571
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:02,620
Speaker 1:  so you can perceive the difference in the yellows is crazy. Me. Yeah.

1572
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:05,570
Speaker 1:  See my obsession with PenTile displays finally paid off. I'm

1573
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:08,900
Speaker 2:  Only going to watch movies with, I don't know, Lee pace at him so I can look

1574
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:12,320
Speaker 2:  at his blonde hair. Very excited.

1575
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,110
Speaker 1:  Do you think they're going to do something big at WWDC with this on one ship?

1576
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:18,920
Speaker 1:  I mean, that's like every, every review you call it out, like don't wait.

1577
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:22,880
Speaker 1:  Like nothing indicates that apple is going to make this thing more of a

1578
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,170
Speaker 1:  Mac WWE.

1579
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:27,020
Speaker 2:  Right. But like apple has certainly not indicated that they're going to make

1580
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:30,530
Speaker 2:  the same. Well, iOS is for babies as we've learned today. Oh my God. So we

1581
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:34,460
Speaker 2:  should just say the one. If you use very specific apps, you will

1582
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:37,670
Speaker 2:  perceive a speed difference in like rendering or doing stuff. But if you

1583
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:41,240
Speaker 2:  don't know exactly what app is slowed down by the 80 series chip, then you

1584
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,540
Speaker 2:  will not notice it is fat is just as fast. It feels fast,

1585
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:48,500
Speaker 2:  whatever it supports Thunderbolt. But again, the

1586
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:52,010
Speaker 2:  way that apple supports third-party accessories on the iPad continues to

1587
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:55,970
Speaker 2:  be frustrating. The one that I specifically called out is

1588
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:59,570
Speaker 2:  audio stuff. So if you have a thing plugged into it that like has a

1589
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:03,380
Speaker 2:  speaker like to my dock, there's no controls to tell the

1590
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:07,220
Speaker 2:  iPad. No, don't use that. Play audio on the iPad. If you can find the

1591
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:10,190
Speaker 2:  setting to like get audio back to the iPad piece, tell me, cause it's not

1592
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:14,150
Speaker 2:  the little airplane looking thing in control center that didn't do it for

1593
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:18,080
Speaker 2:  me. And that's it. Like the iPad is great.

1594
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,860
Speaker 2:  And it's like the most enjoyable computer to use until you can't do

1595
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,510
Speaker 2:  anything until you like hit a wall. And then it's

1596
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:27,470
Speaker 2:  frustrating. So I have no idea

1597
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:30,350
Speaker 2:  what they're gonna do at WWDC. They are do. Cause like they kind of like

1598
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:33,500
Speaker 2:  if they're, if they're doing like the Tik TOK, small update, big update strategy,

1599
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:37,400
Speaker 2:  last year's iPad update was pretty minimal. They didn't

1600
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,360
Speaker 2:  do much. So maybe they're due to do a lot this year, but

1601
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,190
Speaker 2:  we will, we will see

1602
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:47,120
Speaker 1:  One of the challenges apple now has is Craig. Federighi just

1603
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:50,990
Speaker 1:  said the entire software model of the pad over IOS's keeping you

1604
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:54,740
Speaker 1:  safe, but Mac is like a car and you have to learn how to drive it and it's

1605
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:58,640
Speaker 1:  not dangerous. And the iPad is like right in the middle of those

1606
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:02,120
Speaker 1:  two approaches. Yup. And what they need to do is make it more open and extensible

1607
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:06,110
Speaker 1:  and flexible and easier to use. But then they're going to have to

1608
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:09,320
Speaker 1:  give up the things in iOS, right?

1609
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:13,040
Speaker 1:  Like if you want to make the iPad truly extensible, you have

1610
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:17,030
Speaker 1:  to de abstract the file system. Yeah.

1611
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:20,750
Speaker 1:  They're just talking to do it. Right. And like, I just wonder like the

1612
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:24,200
Speaker 1:  things people want iPads to do, like you can do most of them, I worked from

1613
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:28,160
Speaker 1:  an iPad for most of today. Actually it was fine. But the second I'm

1614
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,500
Speaker 1:  like, I gotta add something like we've had this color. How many times we

1615
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,250
Speaker 1:  had this conversation. I can, I just think they're, they're

1616
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:37,550
Speaker 1:  challenged now that they want to keep the iPhones. So locked down in the

1617
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:41,030
Speaker 1:  face of all this antitrust pressure is going to land squarely on the iPad.

1618
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:44,360
Speaker 1:  Not moving. Yeah. Because if they make any concessions on the iPad, people

1619
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:47,420
Speaker 1:  are gonna say, why don't you make the same concessions on the phone? Right.

1620
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,700
Speaker 2:  Well, it's got a different name. It's iPad iOS. It's not,

1621
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:51,590
Speaker 1:  I mean, that's why they did it.

1622
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:55,400
Speaker 2:  I mean, honestly, maybe that's why they did it, man. I

1623
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,760
Speaker 2:  don't, I could complain about what's computer with the iPad for another

1624
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:02,260
Speaker 2:  three. And I'm sure I will be. What about the, just like

1625
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:06,220
Speaker 2:  briefly, what about the fact that apple, I think we've seen what the

1626
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:09,820
Speaker 2:  M one devices are going to be, right? Like the, the low end Mac book

1627
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:13,810
Speaker 2:  pro the medical care, the iMac, and now surprisingly the

1628
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:17,350
Speaker 2:  iPad, they've just like taken this, this thing and they slapped it in all

1629
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:21,310
Speaker 2:  their consumer stuff. So we know there's another version of

1630
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:25,270
Speaker 2:  the M S process of coming for the higher end Mac book pro and

1631
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:29,260
Speaker 2:  presumably a higher end iMac. Is it weird that the, like,

1632
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:32,740
Speaker 2:  this is just the same chip in the Mac and the iPad is an advisor. The only

1633
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,230
Speaker 2:  one that has a hang up on that, I know that they're not going to run Mac

1634
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:38,740
Speaker 2:  apps, but they just like, they like created this amazing board and they just

1635
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,690
Speaker 2:  like put it all their computers. And it's like, this feels more plant seed

1636
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,120
Speaker 2:  than ever to me.

1637
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:47,010
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I don't, I think it it's weird to us. It's probably weird to our listeners.

1638
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:50,400
Speaker 1:  Like now we know it can just do all the things in a way

1639
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,030
Speaker 1:  that apple used to have an argument that Intel chips were

1640
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:57,610
Speaker 1:  different and the architectures were different and they had custom built

1641
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:01,560
Speaker 1:  a series processors to do X, Y, and Z. Now it's like, they're just

1642
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:05,460
Speaker 1:  openly saying it's the same chip. And then, you know, over

1643
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:09,450
Speaker 1:  here on Macko S which is starting to inherit a lot of

1644
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:12,750
Speaker 1:  Iowa iOS paradigms, that it can just do all the

1645
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:16,500
Speaker 1:  things. So like, I think there's a weirdness if you know, but I

1646
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:20,340
Speaker 1:  think apple is also very proud of the M one ship. They're very proud of the

1647
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,270
Speaker 1:  fact that it can run every form factor from an 11

1648
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:28,260
Speaker 1:  inch iPad up to an iMac and like it, and

1649
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:32,190
Speaker 1:  that's just a huge range of thermal constraints. Did it kinda like do a good

1650
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,890
Speaker 1:  job in all those thermal constraints? Give me an one apple

1651
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:38,580
Speaker 1:  watch. I think they're like their

1652
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:42,330
Speaker 1:  general pride at like leading the industry in ship design

1653
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:46,290
Speaker 1:  far supersedes us being like, well, the operating systems are really

1654
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:49,890
Speaker 1:  close and why don't you just let me either touch my Mac or

1655
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:52,190
Speaker 1:  layer a window. Yeah.

1656
01:33:52,190 --> 01:33:56,100
Speaker 1:  Right. That's the only thing that I need to do. I need to

1657
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,820
Speaker 1:  layer some windows or you need to touch this screen. And I think apple just

1658
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:03,750
Speaker 1:  doesn't care. And I really do think, and maybe I'm sure certainly

1659
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:07,680
Speaker 1:  would strenuously deny it. They're in a position right now where to

1660
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:11,550
Speaker 1:  move the iPad to closer to the Mac where a lot of people want it to

1661
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:15,510
Speaker 1:  go. They would have to give up those concessions on the phone. And that is

1662
01:34:15,510 --> 01:34:18,780
Speaker 1:  just a dangerous, dangerous place for them to be right at the

1663
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:19,560
Speaker 1:  second.

1664
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:23,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I couldn't do it in conclusion. The summary of everything

1665
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,790
Speaker 2:  here is they should add malteser to the iPad because it's punitive that they

1666
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:30,750
Speaker 2:  don't. That is, I don't

1667
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:34,410
Speaker 2:  understand why they don't do it because they want to make you buy

1668
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:38,130
Speaker 2:  both. I, that was going to be the original way I was going to conclude the

1669
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:40,770
Speaker 2:  video is like, the reason is because they're going to Ford, they want to

1670
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:44,280
Speaker 2:  make you buy both. And that's like, mean and whatever, but it's

1671
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:48,090
Speaker 2:  not, it's not like the right attitude to take towards the

1672
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:52,030
Speaker 2:  iPad because it is such an amazing computer. But yeah.

1673
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:55,800
Speaker 2:  I just think that they, they want everybody to have an

1674
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,360
Speaker 2:  iPad. They think it's a device that it's a lot of work to make it multi-user

1675
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,170
Speaker 2:  right. iOS is not architected to be that way from the

1676
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:06,410
Speaker 2:  jump. And so like having to RET cut retcon that

1677
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:09,260
Speaker 2:  in is like a ton of work. I don't know if it's

1678
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,500
Speaker 3:  Worth it for them. They, they did that work on the

1679
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,580
Speaker 3:  education

1680
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:17,330
Speaker 2:  IPads or like the multi user there's like, okay. I think that they

1681
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:21,050
Speaker 2:  probably don't think it's a good enough experience to like send out to everybody,

1682
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:24,140
Speaker 2:  but I wish they would. They've already, they've already been willing to make

1683
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,680
Speaker 2:  the iPad complicated, trying to figure out like mow the windowing experience

1684
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:31,190
Speaker 2:  on the iPad is hard. It's not easy to figure it out. It's not intuitive at

1685
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:34,910
Speaker 2:  all. So whatever, make a comp it's already complicated, make it more

1686
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:38,870
Speaker 2:  complicated offer multi-user so that a family that can't afford four

1687
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:41,980
Speaker 2:  iPads can like actually use one.

1688
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:45,940
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Especially with like remote schooling and all this other stuff that

1689
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:49,360
Speaker 1:  we've lived through. Like it's sitting there for them. They just do

1690
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:53,350
Speaker 1:  it. Okay. I want to end, I just want to say this

1691
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:56,680
Speaker 1:  out loud. We did this Starlink review last week, we talked about it at

1692
01:35:56,680 --> 01:36:00,580
Speaker 1:  length. This is so dumb. Have you been

1693
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:04,390
Speaker 1:  listening to this show for any amount of time, but for example,

1694
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:08,380
Speaker 1:  over the past 10 years, I will happily disclose to you

1695
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:10,990
Speaker 1:  as many times as you wish that NBC

1696
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:14,980
Speaker 1:  universal a part of Comcast is a minority investor in

1697
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:18,820
Speaker 1:  Vox media, which owns the verge. I promise you that

1698
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:21,970
Speaker 1:  Comcast does not love me. Like I just, I

1699
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:25,660
Speaker 1:  there's the number of experiences I have or I've been

1700
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:29,530
Speaker 1:  told this company is not a fond of our coverage of them is,

1701
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:33,520
Speaker 1:  is numerous. And I also promise you that

1702
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,510
Speaker 1:  even if they owned us and controlled us, that would not

1703
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:41,440
Speaker 1:  be what it takes to influence me into saying that wired connections are

1704
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,710
Speaker 1:  better than wireless ones, which is

1705
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:48,280
Speaker 1:  just, which is really the thing that people are mad at me for saying that

1706
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,090
Speaker 1:  I think the telecom industry in this country

1707
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:56,050
Speaker 1:  has utterly failed to connect people well. And if you look at other

1708
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:59,410
Speaker 1:  countries around the world with different competition models, different policy

1709
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:03,100
Speaker 1:  regimes, someone's treating me and say, I'm on a beach and I'm on a remote

1710
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:07,030
Speaker 1:  beach in Sweden. I'm paying for my fiber providers, basic plan.

1711
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:10,900
Speaker 1:  And I have 200 up and down like that.

1712
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:14,470
Speaker 1:  I understand it's a big country. There's all these issues. Most people in

1713
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:18,010
Speaker 1:  this country have electricity. We can probably do a better job of

1714
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:21,910
Speaker 1:  running broadband cables to way more places and making the market more

1715
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:25,840
Speaker 1:  competitive, which was the heart of my Starlink review. If

1716
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,560
Speaker 1:  you look at, if you just look at what the most like the

1717
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:33,250
Speaker 1:  harshest lines in that review are, they are dedicated to the telecom

1718
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:37,150
Speaker 1:  industry in this country. Not Starling, even though I think

1719
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:40,090
Speaker 1:  Starlink for a lot of people might be a good solution in the

1720
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:43,960
Speaker 1:  end. That's all I'm going to say. I don't want to like engage it too much.

1721
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:47,830
Speaker 1:  I just think it's very funny to accuse me in particular of

1722
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:51,580
Speaker 1:  being in the pocket of Comcast. In order to say that wired

1723
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:55,320
Speaker 1:  connections are better than wireless ones. If anything, I'm in the pocket

1724
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,830
Speaker 1:  of big HTMI in big. I think people know that.

1725
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:02,820
Speaker 1:  So I just want to put that out there. That's this closure, we

1726
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:06,720
Speaker 1:  disclose it all over the site. We disclose it on a show all the time. I

1727
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:10,650
Speaker 1:  think it is a very funny to I'm sympathetic to it. I understand

1728
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:14,160
Speaker 1:  it. I, some of the criticisms are valid. I got the name of the dish wrong.

1729
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:17,010
Speaker 1:  It's dishy. Make flat face that dish you make takes place. We did correct

1730
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:20,670
Speaker 1:  that in the piece. I think people are so desperate for

1731
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:24,120
Speaker 1:  conductivity. They're missing. They're angry. They're angry at the wrong

1732
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:27,390
Speaker 1:  things. There's like a helplessness about broadband in this

1733
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:31,350
Speaker 1:  country that is utterly devastating to see in person.

1734
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:35,130
Speaker 1:  And so I'm not upset or mad about this. I'm just pointing

1735
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:38,280
Speaker 1:  out how upset other people are

1736
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:42,240
Speaker 1:  that Teeter lives in San Francisco. Yeah. San Francisco

1737
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:42,660
Speaker 1:  is

1738
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,970
Speaker 2:  Everyone's upset that I live here.

1739
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:47,490
Speaker 1:  I mean, I used to live in New York city. Like even if you want to make the

1740
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:51,210
Speaker 1:  big land, you know, America's big and population like in

1741
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:55,170
Speaker 1:  San Francisco, in New York city, two of the most densely populated and

1742
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:59,010
Speaker 1:  expensive places to live in this country. It is hard to get good

1743
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:02,130
Speaker 1:  broadband like Dieter your broadband connection. It's not

1744
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:04,880
Speaker 1:  like you don't have like gigabit.

1745
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:08,630
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, it's not available to me. The best I can get is DOCSIS

1746
01:39:08,630 --> 01:39:11,930
Speaker 2:  from Xfinity. And I hate it. There you

1747
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:15,800
Speaker 2:  go. I'm paying for their max to their max plan. And it's like, you know,

1748
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,520
Speaker 2:  a gig down, but not usually doesn't hit that. And it's a 25

1749
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,480
Speaker 2:  up. And why is it only 25 up? Who knows? And

1750
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:27,410
Speaker 2:  I think if I moved, if I, if I happened to have moved like six blocks, I

1751
01:39:27,410 --> 01:39:31,040
Speaker 2:  would have access to Sonic, which is an independent

1752
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:34,340
Speaker 2:  ISP. I think it runs on top of anti ADTs

1753
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:38,330
Speaker 2:  fiber. And I would love to give them my money. I would be so happy to get

1754
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:41,420
Speaker 2:  my money to an independent ISP. There's another independent ISP here in San

1755
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:45,050
Speaker 2:  Francisco called Monkeybrains, which is very good, but it's just like, it's

1756
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:48,890
Speaker 2:  microwaves and it's, it's a little bit too slow for my needs. So

1757
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:52,850
Speaker 2:  my plan here, living where I live is if I need to upload something, I

1758
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:56,690
Speaker 2:  will get on my bike and ride to our office. That's 20 minutes away and go

1759
01:39:56,690 --> 01:40:00,500
Speaker 2:  through our COVID protocols. No, I'm serious. I go, I, I go through our COVID

1760
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:04,430
Speaker 2:  protocols. I like fill out the survey. I get permission from the company

1761
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:08,420
Speaker 2:  to go to the office so that I can upload a file that's or then,

1762
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:12,200
Speaker 2:  you know, a bunch of gigabytes, like 20 gigabytes. Anytime I shoot video,

1763
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,980
Speaker 2:  I have to go to the office because Comcast is the only

1764
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:17,900
Speaker 2:  provider I have here. And they suck.

1765
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:21,110
Speaker 1:  Anyway. I just think that's like, that's San Francisco. That's not the middle

1766
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:24,980
Speaker 1:  of rural America, which is where I'm sitting. I only have one

1767
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:28,820
Speaker 1:  choice. That's all I want to adjust. The Starlink review

1768
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:32,240
Speaker 1:  was more about broadband in America than one thing. And it was in

1769
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:35,960
Speaker 1:  particular about American telecom

1770
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:39,890
Speaker 1:  policy. Always promising you a new connectivity technology instead

1771
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:43,670
Speaker 1:  of investing into deploying the ones that work and

1772
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:46,730
Speaker 1:  making sure those markets are competitive. I think that is a mistake. I think

1773
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:49,700
Speaker 1:  you can look around the world and see other countries that have made different

1774
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:53,560
Speaker 1:  policy choices and their citizens are connected and much faster

1775
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:57,450
Speaker 1:  for much lower prices. That's it? Disclosure and

1776
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:01,090
Speaker 1:  NBC universal, a division of Comcast. Isn't a minority investor in Vox

1777
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:04,330
Speaker 1:  media, which owns the verge. And I, I

1778
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:08,290
Speaker 1:  promise you, I absolutely promise you. They do not let

1779
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:11,440
Speaker 1:  us okay. That's it. That's a very fast, I didn't mean for that to take too

1780
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:15,010
Speaker 1:  long, but if you know me, you know that I'm very passionate about

1781
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:19,000
Speaker 1:  property palsy. It routinely bores the staff

1782
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,930
Speaker 1:  of the verge to tears. That's my real problem is the constant low-grade

1783
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:26,510
Speaker 1:  mutiny. If I talk about broadband policy anymore, all right, that's it, that's

1784
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:30,030
Speaker 1:  very fast. We've got another episode. We went for an hour

1785
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:33,480
Speaker 1:  and another episode coming

1786
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,820
Speaker 1:  later, or more than

1787
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:39,330
Speaker 1:  that, we went for an hour and we went

1788
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:42,810
Speaker 1:  over is what I'm really trying to say. But Addie and I are going to do

1789
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:46,650
Speaker 1:  another episode of the verge hassle later today, after Tim cook wraps

1790
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:50,640
Speaker 1:  up his epic versus apple testimony. So look out

1791
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:54,450
Speaker 1:  for that. You can tweet at us. Dieter is at backline.

1792
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:57,900
Speaker 1:  Dan is at DCC Siefert I'm at

1793
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:01,800
Speaker 1:  reckless. By the time this comes out, I'm going to tell you, episode of

1794
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:05,340
Speaker 1:  Dakota with Ford CEO, Jim Farley, talking about the new F-150 50

1795
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:09,240
Speaker 1:  lightening, we'll be up in the world. That was a wild hunt.

1796
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:12,840
Speaker 1:  He basically told me that you'd be able to upgrade the computers in cars,

1797
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,570
Speaker 1:  the same way you can upgrade like the shocks and the seats.

1798
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:19,440
Speaker 1:  Ooh, I would love to see that happen. He did not

1799
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,360
Speaker 1:  have an answer when I said, will I be able to upgrade my current cards here,

1800
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:26,060
Speaker 1:  new Android operating system. Just didn't answer that here.

1801
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:29,820
Speaker 1:  I think I know the answer. I think that means I know the

1802
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:33,300
Speaker 1:  answer to that question, but that is good. Yeah, that it's, that was a really

1803
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:37,140
Speaker 1:  fun episode to do. Like I said, we'll be back later, later on Friday

1804
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:41,070
Speaker 1:  with apple versus epic and we'll be back again next week. That's it.

1805
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:43,380
Speaker 1:  Rock and roll. Encourage your family to get back.

1806
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:59,700
Speaker 1:  <inaudible>.
