00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,990
Speaker 1:  This week on the verge cast, Google CEO, Sundar Pichai joins us to take us

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,110
Speaker 1:  through Google IO afterwards. We'll talk about all their hardware

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,800
Speaker 1:  announcements and the gadget news from this week. That's coming up right

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,560
Speaker 1:  after this,

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,870
Speaker 6:  Well, welcome to the Vergecast flagship podcast, the tablets that come

7
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,740
Speaker 6:  out a year from now, your friend Nila, we've got a huge share

8
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,610
Speaker 6:  today. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai is on the verge cast today.

9
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,210
Speaker 6:  David and I talked to him about everything announced at Google IO and kind

10
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,210
Speaker 6:  of the future of Google. It's really good conversation. Then Dan Sievert,

11
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,090
Speaker 6:  drones, the show we talk about all the rest of IO and Alex Cranz comes on

12
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,960
Speaker 6:  at the end little gadget lightning round. It's a really fun one. Let's

13
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,620
Speaker 6:  start here's David and I talking to Google and alphabet CEO,

14
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,550
Speaker 6:  Sundar Pichai, Sundar Pichai. You are

15
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,030
Speaker 6:  the CEO of Google. You are the CEO and chairman of alphabet. Welcome to the

16
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,810
Speaker 6:  Vergecast.

17
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,330
Speaker 8:  Hello. It's a pleasure to be here. Good to see any line, David.

18
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,420
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's great to see you again. It's been a while since we've talked also,

19
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,850
Speaker 6:  I appreciate that you're on the verge cast. Real ones are on the verge cast

20
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,720
Speaker 6:  to talk product. That's like that's, this is where it gets serious about

21
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,440
Speaker 6:  products. True that, so it's Google IO. We obviously came off the keynote.

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,100
Speaker 6:  The keynote was two hours long, lots of products, lots of really

23
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,400
Speaker 6:  hardcore AI tech Lambda, big language

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,330
Speaker 6:  models. Here's my question for you. Just kind of a big picture. And then

25
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,270
Speaker 6:  I want to dive into some of the products themselves. Google does a lot of

26
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,230
Speaker 6:  things. It has a lot of research projects, a lot of far

27
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,950
Speaker 6:  out ideas, a lot of things on the ground like

28
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,430
Speaker 6:  maps and recommendations, and obviously search you run

29
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,030
Speaker 6:  YouTube. Then you've got Android. Like it's a lot of things, kind of the

30
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,840
Speaker 6:  theme of IO this year was you're bringing it all together and it's going

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,590
Speaker 6:  to become a very focused set of products and experiences for people, the

32
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,550
Speaker 6:  whole ecosystem. So just from the baseline, how real is that? How much

33
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,450
Speaker 6:  are you actually bringing Google into focus versus you're just

34
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,690
Speaker 6:  lining up the pieces and making sure they make sense together?

35
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,480
Speaker 8:  Well, you know, I do think a few things which

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,130
Speaker 8:  have tried to do at the company one is at an underlying more

37
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,850
Speaker 8:  foundational layer that focus on AI. So when you say

38
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,210
Speaker 8:  research, you know, there's a real deep focus on

39
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,050
Speaker 8:  AI in some ways, the big bet is AI is transformational

40
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,010
Speaker 8:  across, you know, all the products and services we do. So for sure,

41
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,910
Speaker 8:  that's been a big focus back and other with a focus on knowledge and

42
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,900
Speaker 8:  computing, right? And both BCS core aspects of our mission.

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,800
Speaker 8:  And so to me, you know, it is the same AI, which, which makes

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,640
Speaker 8:  that change in search, you know, B because we are able to do

45
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,360
Speaker 8:  things in a more multimodal way and is that same multimodal model, which

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,230
Speaker 8:  in YouTube can create auto chapters and so on. So it's an underlying

47
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,950
Speaker 8:  theme. So with which we are doing it across our

48
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,610
Speaker 8:  key products and services, but there is a set of products which our

49
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,120
Speaker 8:  users use multiple times per day. These are big

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,100
Speaker 8:  active user bases. And so, you know, there's a lot of focus on beads

51
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,710
Speaker 8:  search or Gmail or maps or YouTube, making sure those

52
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,280
Speaker 8:  products are evolving in a way that makes sense. And so I think both are

53
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,120
Speaker 8:  important.

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,520
Speaker 7:  So on the AI front though, there's a piece of that. That's really interesting

55
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,220
Speaker 7:  to me because one of the things I noticed in the keynote was that things

56
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,120
Speaker 7:  like Lambda and translate and Palm kept

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,780
Speaker 7:  coming up kind of in different contexts. And I think one of the things that's

58
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,320
Speaker 7:  been tricky for us to figure out is like, when you say we're focused on AI,

59
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,800
Speaker 7:  that can mean lots of things, right? AI is this huge sprawling thing that

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,550
Speaker 7:  can mean a lot of things within that space. It feels like maybe Google is

61
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,360
Speaker 7:  picking its spots a little more instead of kind of trying to

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,320
Speaker 7:  do lots of things. You have sort of a few big bets, even just within AI.

63
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,760
Speaker 7:  Is that fair?

64
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,610
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean, it's, it's a great question. You know, you can think about

65
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,850
Speaker 8:  it this way, right? There's, we're all making progress in

66
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,390
Speaker 8:  state-of-the-art MLN AI, then there's things symptoms of what we are

67
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,260
Speaker 8:  deploying in production, which is the latest version of Peter's speech models,

68
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,950
Speaker 8:  vision models, et cetera, or multimodal models, right. And then there is

69
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,880
Speaker 8:  the future of AI, which, which is not in production yet.

70
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,870
Speaker 8:  And that is large language models. I think we are talking about that

71
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,770
Speaker 8:  and that's where Lambda and Palm and everything comes in and some of that

72
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,700
Speaker 8:  will keep flowing back into cutting-edge production and, you know, and

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,420
Speaker 8:  that's what keeps the innovation going. And we are talking about

74
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,470
Speaker 8:  both of them.

75
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,020
Speaker 7:  And I think part of that, it seems like my sense would be then that your

76
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,260
Speaker 7:  job as CEO is in part to sort of make sure all of those things are

77
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,190
Speaker 7:  moving at the correct speed because I just the idea of sort

78
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,940
Speaker 7:  of living deep in the future and two years from now, and also

79
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,840
Speaker 7:  right now is just, it seems impossible. Right?

80
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,540
Speaker 8:  I think something which is probably, you know, there are two sides to the

81
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,840
Speaker 8:  coin, right? So for example, when we build something like Chrome, you know,

82
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,680
Speaker 8:  we unveiled the end to end product one day, the comic book bleak two

83
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,530
Speaker 8:  days ago, but at least, you know, it's a product in which you come out

84
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,340
Speaker 8:  and, you know, unveil it when it comes to things like AI, both a

85
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,910
Speaker 8:  lot of it, we publish research. So, you know, you're not quite can do

86
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,570
Speaker 8:  that. And B because in a technology like that,

87
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,440
Speaker 8:  transparency is important too, I think. And so we are

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,740
Speaker 8:  talking about it ahead of time, which is what gives a sense of,

89
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,730
Speaker 8:  well, is this too futuristic? What of this will apply to the products? And

90
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,540
Speaker 8:  I think it's a fair question, but I'm trying to explain why we are doing

91
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,410
Speaker 8:  it the way we are doing it. And so that's what I think makes it a

92
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,370
Speaker 8:  bit different.

93
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,240
Speaker 6:  I think that kind of the classic story of IO has been a

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,110
Speaker 6:  demo of a really impressive AI tool. I

95
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,260
Speaker 6:  can't help, but think of the one that took the fence out of the picture in

96
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,810
Speaker 6:  the image editor, and then it turns out like that's actually a really hard

97
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,170
Speaker 6:  problem. It's gonna take a long time to actually ship that to consumers.

98
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,890
Speaker 6:  But at the same time, you're demoing things in actual products

99
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,850
Speaker 6:  like translation that are real for people, or it could be real today. And

100
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,030
Speaker 6:  it's just really hard to calibrate. What are we looking at? That's real right

101
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,150
Speaker 6:  now, or that is a vision of what I could

102
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,840
Speaker 6:  accomplish versus Google is one of the few companies that

103
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,770
Speaker 6:  still demos really impressive software. Every time you have an event,

104
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,800
Speaker 6:  most other companies are like, I don't know we were going to stream some

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,610
Speaker 6:  baseball games to you. You know, like there's a really like very hardcore

106
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,970
Speaker 6:  engineering component to what you showed at IO, but it's just hard to know

107
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,750
Speaker 6:  which of it is going to come into focus and turn into a product. And which

108
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,710
Speaker 6:  of it is Google has an intense set of capabilities. And part

109
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,040
Speaker 6:  of Google's culture is chasing them down where wherever they might leave,

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,860
Speaker 8:  If you go back, let me give a couple of examples. Like, you know, we showed

111
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,160
Speaker 8:  Google lens many years ago, right? And you know, the promise of what Google

112
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,030
Speaker 8:  lenses, it's a real product, right. Then like, you know, people query it,

113
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,930
Speaker 8:  you can access it. And we are taking as lens matures.

114
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,860
Speaker 8:  We are bringing those capabilities into search. And that's what helps you

115
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,310
Speaker 8:  from a multi-service standpoint, even the fence, you can, you can see magic

116
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,300
Speaker 8:  eraser in pixel. And I would argue, gets at some of

117
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,230
Speaker 8:  that promise in the context of a product. You know, so the goal of everything

118
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,770
Speaker 8:  we are showing is to actually build it into a product. That's how, that's

119
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,520
Speaker 8:  what we are trying to do. So I have no interest in being an R and

120
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,390
Speaker 8:  D lab. You know, we actually genuinely believe in doing cutting

121
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,750
Speaker 8:  edge R and D, right. We are one of the world's largest R and D

122
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,600
Speaker 8:  investors, you know, probably over a hundred million dollars in the past

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,530
Speaker 8:  five years. And so we had definitely doing typ of three R and

124
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,220
Speaker 8:  D, but the goal is all with a clear lens of our

125
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,150
Speaker 8:  mission, how we will apply it and working it backwards.

126
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,140
Speaker 8:  And then I think both are true. So, you know, there may be times, you

127
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,010
Speaker 8:  know, there's a probabilistic outcome. And so that there may be one or two

128
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,640
Speaker 8:  elements in it, which we fail. And so that there, there is that

129
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
Speaker 8:  risk of talking ahead. And, and I think the failures are

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,690
Speaker 8:  also obvious to the external world, but I do think if you have looked at

131
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,500
Speaker 8:  the capabilities we are bringing in pixel, et cetera, that is we are translating

132
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,320
Speaker 8:  it into products and features everything to do with translation though, I

133
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,010
Speaker 8:  would argue we've been steadily making progress, you know, be it

134
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,400
Speaker 8:  monolingual translation or what we showed in the context of

135
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,330
Speaker 8:  translation and transcription in the context of the prototypes AR glass

136
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,600
Speaker 8:  prototypes. Those are real products we are working on. Right?

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,780
Speaker 6:  Well, it's the where to skip ad. He brought up the glasses are real. It's

138
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,980
Speaker 6:  a real pair of glasses.

139
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,970
Speaker 8:  Yeah, that'd be the prototypes are real. I mean, they are real use cases

140
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,870
Speaker 8:  and you know, people testing it out are real. Absolutely. We are

141
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,770
Speaker 8:  still obviously working through what the right product in terms of

142
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,700
Speaker 8:  AR is, but they are, we were trying to communicate two things. One is a

143
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,270
Speaker 8:  lot of the innovation for what we are building in AR. We are building it

144
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,260
Speaker 8:  in the context of a smartphone today. And so lands multi-serve scene

145
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,530
Speaker 8:  exploration, live in view and maps. These are all AR

146
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,250
Speaker 8:  experiences if we are doing it in a smartphone today, but the magic is in

147
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,940
Speaker 8:  fully obvious till you can live in that future. And so we are

148
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,690
Speaker 8:  exploring that future also in terms of hardware form factors, but that's

149
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,500
Speaker 8:  going to take time to do, and we, we have a few more decisions ahead of us

150
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,130
Speaker 8:  there.

151
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,350
Speaker 6:  So I looked at the glasses. So if people haven't seen the video, she wash

152
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,580
Speaker 6:  it. It's cool. It's a pair of glasses that listens, and it shows you real-time

153
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,330
Speaker 6:  translations someone speaking in different language. You get real-time translation

154
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,420
Speaker 6:  on the screen of the glasses. I look at that and I say, oh, that's really

155
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,360
Speaker 6:  smart right now, all the AR experiences you're describing, they happen on

156
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,230
Speaker 6:  a phone because a phone has a fancy camera built into it. It

157
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,500
Speaker 6:  has a 5g network connection for whatever that's worth. It has a fast

158
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,340
Speaker 6:  processor. It has a big battery putting that stuff in glasses is very

159
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,180
Speaker 6:  difficult. And I look at the translation glasses, you demo it. And I say,

160
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,140
Speaker 6:  oh, this is actually, you're cutting the problem way down. Now, all

161
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,070
Speaker 6:  we're doing is listening to someone, translating it and then showing some

162
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,850
Speaker 6:  text on a screen, which in the grand scheme of computer problems is still

163
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,850
Speaker 6:  hard. But in the scheme of AR is like a very narrow

164
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,270
Speaker 6:  solution. Is that how you're thinking about it? That you're going to cut

165
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,480
Speaker 6:  it all the way down to that, and you're not going to do real-time graphic

166
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,360
Speaker 6:  overlays and stuff that seems really far out right now.

167
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Speaker 8:  I think it's part of how we are thinking about it because, you know, I, I

168
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,720
Speaker 8:  don't think we want to overshoot it. The more you overshoot, the longer it

169
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,620
Speaker 8:  is away. Right? And so we are trying to find that sweet spot of Lord is

170
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,130
Speaker 8:  it that you can do something which people can wear, maybe doesn't

171
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,000
Speaker 8:  have, you know, it's comfortable, you can wear. And also doesn't

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,420
Speaker 8:  have the other broader issues around, well, if you have a camera, you have

173
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,260
Speaker 8:  to solve a set of different issues. It's a harder system integration

174
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,160
Speaker 8:  problem as you're pointing out and so on. So we're thinking through, I

175
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,820
Speaker 8:  think anytime in a constraint I've always felt constraints help, right. You

176
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,810
Speaker 8:  know, having constraints helps you actually deliver a product. And so

177
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,110
Speaker 8:  I'm a fan of that. And so I think that's part of, what's informing our thinking

178
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,590
Speaker 8:  that

179
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,010
Speaker 6:  One of the other challenges they are, and you're kind of hinting at it. Yep.

180
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,610
Speaker 6:  There's the big you have to develop the hardware. That seems very

181
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,210
Speaker 6:  challenging. There's also the idea that you're going to augment reality,

182
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,900
Speaker 6:  which just on its face seems like the world's biggest content moderation

183
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,620
Speaker 6:  challenge. You run YouTube. YouTube is a content moderation

184
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,530
Speaker 6:  challenge. Have you put time into thinking about, okay, we're into an

185
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,490
Speaker 6:  AR future. Someone's looking at the Capitol building, Google's going

186
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,120
Speaker 6:  to put some information over the Capitol building to say what happened

187
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,050
Speaker 6:  there. And people are going to be upset regardless of what we put on that

188
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,770
Speaker 6:  screen. Have you gotten all the way that down that road in your thinking

189
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,680
Speaker 6:  yet? Or are you still focused on, we have to make a computer you put on your

190
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,430
Speaker 6:  face?

191
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,120
Speaker 8:  No, I think, look, I think we are in earliest stages, you know, you can

192
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,690
Speaker 8:  imagine use cases where there are products like maps

193
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,380
Speaker 8:  or, you know, you want to listen to music when you run or, you know, the

194
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,220
Speaker 8:  translation use cases. I think any time you show information

195
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,760
Speaker 8:  with that, you have to think through all that. And I agree with you, but

196
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,090
Speaker 8:  I don't think we are quite there yet. If I were to be Frank thinking, thinking

197
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,080
Speaker 8:  all that through

198
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,800
Speaker 6:  Just on a timeline, do you think this is a five-year problem? Is it a

199
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,950
Speaker 6:  25 year problem? Is it 18 months?

200
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,640
Speaker 8:  Well, we have that problem today, right? I think, I think information is

201
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,480
Speaker 8:  working at scale on the internet and, you know, I think we've already

202
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,350
Speaker 8:  crossed the inflection points. So I would argue, you know, solving

203
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,560
Speaker 8:  content moderation, you know, it's a hard enough problem

204
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,520
Speaker 8:  today. And if I think to the future, I don't know, maybe, maybe areas where

205
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,450
Speaker 8:  I worry about more are, you know, synthetic content and how

206
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,810
Speaker 8:  do we deal with that? And, you know, so maybe 80 is like, that would just

207
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,140
Speaker 8:  not Nestle AR as a dimension, but I think there are other

208
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,770
Speaker 8:  dimensions, you know, which, which, which I think are probably thinking about

209
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,610
Speaker 8:  a bit more

210
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,910
Speaker 7:  Fair enough. And I think this comes back to the, kind of, how you think about

211
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,420
Speaker 7:  the company as a whole question too, because I think we've seen a few companies

212
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,020
Speaker 7:  most aggressively, I think Metta make a lot of noise

213
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,620
Speaker 7:  about AR being like a bet, the company thing, right? That, that this thing

214
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,990
Speaker 7:  that is coming next is going to require everything that we have. And we have

215
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,970
Speaker 7:  to put everything we have behind it, and it's gonna require changing how

216
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,720
Speaker 7:  we work. My sense is you're not shifting Google quite that

217
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,830
Speaker 7:  aggressively, but

218
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,820
Speaker 6:  Sooner as like the real world is pretty good. Yeah. Which is about a part

219
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,660
Speaker 6:  of a shot is I've ever heard you take

220
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,390
Speaker 7:  That is true.

221
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,960
Speaker 8:  Look, I mean, I mean, we are definitely focused

222
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,740
Speaker 8:  more and more on the AR side in the context of the

223
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,640
Speaker 8:  real world is important. It's not a, it's how we see

224
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,360
Speaker 8:  it. And we were building it. I think, look, we are as has an

225
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,290
Speaker 8:  important use case too, and there'll be mixed reality, but those things all

226
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,750
Speaker 8:  have different timelines and access and so on.

227
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,020
Speaker 7:  Well, I, I was curious as you think about, and I mean it with AR cause eventually

228
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,210
Speaker 7:  if they are, is going to be as big as a lot of people think it is, it's going

229
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,110
Speaker 7:  to require basically every team at Google to build new things

230
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,890
Speaker 7:  for it. Where are you in sort of how you're thinking about how much energy

231
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,590
Speaker 7:  you want to put within the company onto that kind of stuff.

232
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,460
Speaker 8:  I mean, we worked through, remember, you know, Google was came from the

233
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,970
Speaker 8:  desktop era, right. And you know, we are doing the shift to

234
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,930
Speaker 8:  mobile. AI is a big shift. We are driving. And so to

235
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,110
Speaker 8:  me, I think it cuts across. And so we think about it. So I don't view it

236
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,260
Speaker 8:  as bedding. The company, meat is a natural evolution of the

237
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,250
Speaker 8:  company. And I think if you're thinking deeply and billing for the future,

238
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,910
Speaker 8:  it is a big part of getting it. Right. So for me, it's important. Search

239
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,370
Speaker 8:  works in AR context, you know, and maps is thinking it

240
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,270
Speaker 8:  true and YouTube is thinking it through right then. And

241
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,810
Speaker 8:  Google photos is thinking it through. And so I think if we get it right that

242
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,540
Speaker 8:  way, you know, you're, you're, you're bringing the company along through

243
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,410
Speaker 8:  these big transitions. And so maybe, you know, maybe it's a, it's a, but

244
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,550
Speaker 8:  how we think about it,

245
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,730
Speaker 6:  All right. Let's come back out of the clouds from it. That's a, I mean, it's

246
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,540
Speaker 6:  interesting. I think the glasses are fascinating in the sense that

247
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,320
Speaker 6:  by reducing the problem you're trying to solve, you

248
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,590
Speaker 6:  actually can make a more useful product. That's supposed to try to boil the

249
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,400
Speaker 6:  ocean there, but they're still pretty far out. You've got another problem

250
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,150
Speaker 6:  right in front of you, which is trying to sell pixel phones and create a

251
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,140
Speaker 6:  pixel ecosystem. Even at that, for a while, we saw a pixel seven

252
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,830
Speaker 6:  pixel six, eight pixel buds pro you

253
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,920
Speaker 6:  hinted at a tablet. There's a lot of energy in that

254
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,670
Speaker 6:  space. And one of the things that Rick told

255
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,570
Speaker 6:  David on another piece of the broadcast is that the Android team

256
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,140
Speaker 6:  and the pixel team are much closer together. Now they're operating in

257
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,890
Speaker 6:  harmony. Historically that arrangement has made your

258
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,760
Speaker 6:  OEMs very mad, but I believe at one point Google was forced to sell Motorola

259
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,420
Speaker 6:  because things were too close, but now you're doing it again. Tell me about

260
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,410
Speaker 6:  that is that pixel is Samsung and Lenovo and whoever else don't see

261
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,710
Speaker 6:  pixel as a threat, so you can bring them close together. Is it you're going

262
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,550
Speaker 6:  to spin some innovations from pixel out, into Android, proper.

263
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,860
Speaker 6:  How are you thinking about managing that dynamic?

264
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,430
Speaker 8:  Let me step out and firsthand and struggle to focus there, you know, to me,

265
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,030
Speaker 8:  no different or the past five years, if you taken an idea like YouTube

266
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,810
Speaker 8:  or, you know, we've put a lot of focus into it. Cloud is the same thing,

267
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,620
Speaker 8:  both as big areas and as important businesses to be built to

268
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,400
Speaker 8:  me, hardware and computing is equally important. I do

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,910
Speaker 8:  think the ecosystem, all of us see value in, you know,

270
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,420
Speaker 8:  working together to make sure we make progress particularly beyond

271
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,110
Speaker 8:  folks. Right? So where all this has been a great example. I think we have

272
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,170
Speaker 8:  done both, you know, because when you're, when you're, when you're building

273
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,070
Speaker 8:  these new categories, it's hardware and software it's app developers,

274
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,700
Speaker 8:  you all understand as well. So there is value in what we did with

275
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,000
Speaker 8:  Samsung on where ours aligning and as

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,660
Speaker 8:  developers, the fact that pixel watch is coming and they're all

277
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,500
Speaker 8:  assessed a lot more traction of that matters for those developers address

278
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,340
Speaker 8:  that too. So a rising tide lifts, all boats, kind of a

279
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,820
Speaker 8:  scenario. I think I, I think is genuinely what plays out.

280
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,780
Speaker 8:  So, you know, we will work super hard with Samsung on foldables and

281
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,680
Speaker 8:  phones and, you know, and also I think there's some added

282
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,460
Speaker 8:  value in our approach in the sense that sometimes we have a strong

283
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,000
Speaker 8:  view on what to do on top of Android, right? Our OEMs may have a different

284
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,600
Speaker 8:  viewpoint. They, one of the benefits of Android is it allows both viewpoints

285
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,140
Speaker 8:  to be expressed and we can do it in the context of pixel and the ecosystem

286
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,860
Speaker 8:  BC and Samsung can, you know, have a vision on top

287
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,760
Speaker 8:  of galaxy. And they're, they're a hardware ecosystem too. So I think there's

288
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,670
Speaker 8:  some value in that too. So, you know, I don't see

289
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,310
Speaker 8:  necessarily this being that complicated. I think the

290
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,090
Speaker 8:  industry has evolved to this level. You can, you can look at

291
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,960
Speaker 8:  somebody like Microsoft, it's surface and windows, and you

292
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,570
Speaker 8:  can ask the, you know, the same question, but I think, you know,

293
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,310
Speaker 8:  I, I think it's natural. We work with Samsung, by the way, you

294
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,550
Speaker 8:  know, our pixel division is a major customer of

295
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,540
Speaker 8:  Samson's competence. So we don't sit down and ask, Hey, Samsung

296
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,470
Speaker 8:  is supplying its own phones and us. And like, how do you do this?

297
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,460
Speaker 8:  And the industry has worked that way for awhile. So I, I, you know,

298
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,830
Speaker 8:  I, I see it as a natural evolution

299
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,220
Speaker 7:  On the ecosystem side of things. What changed your thinking about that? I

300
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,940
Speaker 7:  think one of the things that Neil and I both noticed from IO is it was, there

301
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,480
Speaker 7:  was a lot of kind of resurrecting of old products and old ideas. Like

302
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,420
Speaker 7:  tablets was a thing that it doesn't seem like Google has cared about in a

303
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,140
Speaker 7:  while and same with watches. And while it is back after not being back.

304
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,100
Speaker 7:  And it's definitely the, the ecosystem thinking seems

305
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,910
Speaker 7:  to have gotten much bigger. What sort of sparked that internally?

306
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,810
Speaker 8:  I think there are two aspects to it. One is what you said, you know, the

307
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,800
Speaker 8:  ecosystem is important and, you know, thinking it through and, you

308
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,100
Speaker 8:  know, an Android is open source, which means there are many different OEMs

309
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,950
Speaker 8:  making things. So the Android team is thinking hard about, better together

310
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,790
Speaker 8:  and how do these things work together better? And the additional categories

311
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,780
Speaker 8:  becoming more important. That's, that's one part of it. The second

312
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,590
Speaker 8:  part of it is why not sooner as you know, hardware is such an economies of

313
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,250
Speaker 8:  scale listens, right? There's so many things to do to get it right. You know,

314
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,060
Speaker 8:  we have been building the capabilities, right? So for example, we

315
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,600
Speaker 8:  knew tensor has been five years in the making, right? The years you're

316
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,500
Speaker 8:  seeing it now, but we knew we needed that to work

317
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,800
Speaker 8:  well, to be able to do a tablet so that it shares the same Silicon

318
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,550
Speaker 8:  platform with phones. And so you had to

319
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,330
Speaker 8:  crawl, walk and start to run on phone for, you can actually

320
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,290
Speaker 8:  do do the other things. So there's a difference between intellectually understanding

321
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,130
Speaker 8:  it a few years earlier, whereas this, the actual practical ability to

322
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,820
Speaker 8:  get scale and to be able to do it all in the additional

323
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,940
Speaker 8:  things. And so I think, I think that's the practical side of it,

324
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,360
Speaker 6:  But let me ask you about phones in particular, and then maybe extended the

325
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,780
Speaker 6:  tablets you made the comparison to Microsoft. Microsoft had surface

326
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,650
Speaker 6:  because the windows ecosystem was not producing thousand

327
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,520
Speaker 6:  dollar laptops. Panos has been on the show. He said that to us very directly,

328
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,970
Speaker 6:  very loudly. And so they were like, we need to, we need to reinvigorate this

329
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,540
Speaker 6:  segment of the market. We need to compete with apple because apple is winning

330
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,410
Speaker 6:  at the segment of the market in phones right now. Right. If pixel is a

331
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,250
Speaker 6:  huge success, you're not necessarily getting apple switchers,

332
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,150
Speaker 6:  right. You're getting Samsung switchers, or you're just moving people around

333
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,110
Speaker 6:  the Android ecosystem. If you watch a tablet, I don't know if you're thinking

334
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,410
Speaker 6:  you're going to get iPad switchers. You might just get like chroma Les

335
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,400
Speaker 6:  switchers or other Android tablets switchers. Like how do

336
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,910
Speaker 6:  you think about managing that competition? And then I guess the real question

337
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,900
Speaker 6:  is how do you think about opening the gate to get people to

338
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,850
Speaker 6:  switch from the apple products where however many conversations I want to

339
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,350
Speaker 6:  have about lock-in and I promise you, we will soon ask what RCS, but they

340
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,650
Speaker 6:  seem to be pretty happy over there and not enticed to switch to your

341
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,060
Speaker 6:  platforms.

342
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,870
Speaker 8:  I definitely think us doing tablets and us

343
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,680
Speaker 8:  working better with Samsung tablets, we'll end up in

344
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,220
Speaker 8:  together. Each of us, both individually, better off and overall, you know,

345
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,640
Speaker 8:  Android as an ecosystem will do better than tablets. That's how the map works

346
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,360
Speaker 8:  out. At least empirically for awhile on the phone

347
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,290
Speaker 8:  side too. You know, I do think on a high end, you know, we need to be

348
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,680
Speaker 8:  competetive similarly, you know, you're talking about switching, but we could

349
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,670
Speaker 8:  also lose users from the Android ecosystem because we don't have a

350
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,300
Speaker 8:  good tablet offering as well when you've made this point before on, on

351
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,510
Speaker 8:  Vergecast. But you know, about nexus seven and the impact it

352
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,350
Speaker 8:  had, we are doing it because we think we will give a

353
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,310
Speaker 8:  clear view on how you can do these things and how they

354
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,880
Speaker 8:  can work together. And, and I think it will impact the whole ecosystem to

355
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,750
Speaker 8:  do better. So I see all of that playing out. I see it's so

356
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,650
Speaker 8:  far from being a zero sum game. And to my earlier point, we ended up being

357
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,520
Speaker 8:  a very successful other cell competent to us. We buy displays, we

358
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,450
Speaker 8:  buy memory buys. I mean, it's Excel. I think it's a bit more complex

359
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,410
Speaker 8:  than that. Yeah.

360
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,250
Speaker 6:  All right. So now I definitely have to ask the RCS question, shout out to

361
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,940
Speaker 6:  our friend Dieter, Bohn and ruthlessly took from us sinner, but

362
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,840
Speaker 6:  right. The, the noise that Google has started to make about RCS has

363
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,380
Speaker 6:  gotten louder over the past five years. I w I would just say it started

364
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,980
Speaker 6:  with here's the new standard. We hope the carriers adopted we're running

365
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,610
Speaker 6:  our own RCS servers to two days ago,

366
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,420
Speaker 6:  onstage everyone should adopt RCS pointed, look in the

367
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,880
Speaker 6:  direction of Cupertino, right? Like you're starting to advocate now for it

368
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,500
Speaker 6:  as a company, very loudly, there are good reasons for it. There's security,

369
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,920
Speaker 6:  there's encryption, there's all that stuff. There's also just

370
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,700
Speaker 6:  inter-operability and ease of switching in the sense that IMS had just

371
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,540
Speaker 6:  pure lock-in for apple. How are you bouncing all of that stuff? Is it

372
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,360
Speaker 6:  you're more focused on this is the next generation of standards and we gotta

373
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,180
Speaker 6:  get there, or is there an element of competitiveness to it?

374
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,160
Speaker 8:  Well, first of all, a few things, you know, I mean, for, for all the <inaudible>,

375
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,440
Speaker 8:  you've had alarm focus on our messaging efforts. And I would

376
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,130
Speaker 8:  say RC is a tribute to, I still

377
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,030
Speaker 8:  recall being in mobile world Congress. Maybe now I may get the

378
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,750
Speaker 8:  timing wrong six to seven years ago, and seeing the

379
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,620
Speaker 8:  moment where the carrier severely looked at us and said, we

380
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,280
Speaker 8:  need you to do this. And historically it had been difficult. The

381
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,430
Speaker 8:  carriers viewed as we don't want anyone else to come into messaging. And

382
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,300
Speaker 8:  so there was a big shift. And so I actually view it as a great

383
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,230
Speaker 8:  example of against extraordinary odds

384
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,100
Speaker 8:  being so focused on an area or six to seven years

385
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,970
Speaker 8:  and being where we are there. I think at least on the Android ecosystem

386
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,240
Speaker 8:  side, RCS is on a clear path to

387
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,170
Speaker 8:  both being a standard supporting end to end encryption and so on.

388
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,450
Speaker 8:  So, you know, super excited about the progress there. I think, look,

389
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,260
Speaker 8:  interoperability is great here. You know, we all take it for

390
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,680
Speaker 8:  granted in areas like email today. You know, I, it would be

391
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,670
Speaker 8:  great for it to work. I think we couldn't even make the case till we

392
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,540
Speaker 8:  had a viable alternative. So we've crossed that pot. And

393
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,050
Speaker 8:  so, you know, I think idealized teams being

394
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,950
Speaker 8:  excited and making calls and stuff, but to me, what's in our control

395
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,850
Speaker 8:  is to build a compelling standard and all the time make the

396
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,780
Speaker 8:  compelling case. It's the benefit of everyone involved, including iOS

397
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,290
Speaker 8:  users to have that end, to end encryption

398
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,280
Speaker 8:  working and have that interoperability. And the rest

399
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,940
Speaker 8:  is, you know, I would say the for hands. And as he said, you know, time will

400
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,630
Speaker 8:  tell, but, you know, I'm at least glad we reached the stage where we

401
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,580
Speaker 8:  are and, and making progress and taking data.

402
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,370
Speaker 8:  That's of all, you guys focus a lot on products, which is great.

403
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,180
Speaker 8:  And I think unique, but the more you focus on product, you almost like

404
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,410
Speaker 8:  product manager type of people at Google is always hiring product managers.

405
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,670
Speaker 8:  So, sorry, I think it comes.

406
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,180
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You need someone who thinks about the people. I

407
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,080
Speaker 6:  guess that's like another, I think just big thing question, and I want to,

408
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,890
Speaker 6:  I want to ask about a more distributed future, but just on a big

409
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,820
Speaker 6:  perspective right now, when you think about the big companies, they

410
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,630
Speaker 6:  have signature products, Google has a lot of signature

411
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,410
Speaker 6:  products, as you're thinking about the future of the company and how all

412
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,770
Speaker 6:  those products might work together and how you might layer that the technologies

413
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,670
Speaker 6:  underneath them together. Are you thinking about changing how Google operates

414
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,420
Speaker 6:  or how it's organized? Like historically Google has just been a,

415
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,420
Speaker 6:  has been doing a lot of things all at once. I think messaging is actually

416
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,290
Speaker 6:  the ultimate example of this, where lots of teams at Google have built

417
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,070
Speaker 6:  messaging products, but the strategy for messaging has only

418
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,910
Speaker 6:  recently begun to perhaps coalesce. Are you thinking about that more

419
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,310
Speaker 6:  broadly across the company?

420
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,240
Speaker 8:  Yes. I mean, you know, things such as really, you know, one of

421
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,840
Speaker 8:  the things which they coming see, you was one. I wanted the

422
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,530
Speaker 8:  company to go back and think a lot about its core mission,

423
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,310
Speaker 8:  because I felt that it was important to ground ground ourselves there

424
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,180
Speaker 8:  and really focused on knowledge and core

425
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,930
Speaker 8:  of knowledge for us is on search and YouTube. It's our core consumer

426
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,410
Speaker 8:  services and then computing, right? It's it's

427
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,890
Speaker 8:  Android. And as part of that, there was a big bet on hardware too. And then

428
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,160
Speaker 8:  making sure we are a world-class enterprise platform as

429
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,030
Speaker 8:  well with cloud and workspace. So we have done a lot of work to

430
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,780
Speaker 8:  focus the company along those dimensions, right. And so, you know, you

431
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,770
Speaker 8:  see those are our five big product areas, how we have structured and how

432
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,310
Speaker 8:  we run them. And with a common view of all the cross

433
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:32,240
Speaker 8:  cutting R and D and technology, particularly AI, which,

434
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,720
Speaker 8:  which really, you know, drives innovation forward there. So that's

435
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,590
Speaker 8:  definitely, you know, that's the big picture, how, how I think about it and,

436
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,740
Speaker 8:  you know, we'll continue to be very focused and that's why I gave the

437
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,710
Speaker 8:  examples. And I think it takes a lot in tech. You know, tech is very

438
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,160
Speaker 8:  competitive. He looked at something like tick-tock emerge, you know, things

439
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,030
Speaker 8:  happen in a very fast cycles. And so

440
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:57,900
Speaker 8:  to stay on top of, on any significant tech product, you know, needs a

441
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,710
Speaker 8:  lot of focus and continued innovation. And so I've always viewed as a

442
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,080
Speaker 8:  company. We need to be very, very focused on it. And

443
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,820
Speaker 8:  definitely we have brought focus some of us, or looks

444
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,580
Speaker 8:  outside as well. You're focused on these products and you're improving

445
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,300
Speaker 8:  them. Yes. I mean, because these are in a billion

446
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,930
Speaker 8:  user products, doing important things. And I think people

447
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,590
Speaker 8:  rely on them. And to me, there's nothing more important than

448
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,250
Speaker 8:  making it better constantly and continually evolving

449
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,460
Speaker 8:  it as a web service. Sometimes it's hard because, you know, if you're doing

450
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,400
Speaker 8:  hardware or something, you get these once in a year moments to go talk about

451
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,700
Speaker 8:  it. Something like search where you're shipping stuff every two weeks and

452
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,690
Speaker 8:  you're continuously releasing them. You know, it is even more important,

453
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,080
Speaker 8:  I think, to be very focused on making sure you're actually moving the

454
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,950
Speaker 8:  needle. So I think it's definitely a big part of what I think about

455
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,760
Speaker 6:  One of the things that I've been thinking about a lot lately is the blockchain

456
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,270
Speaker 6:  decentralized computing. I talked to blockchain companies and

457
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,200
Speaker 6:  CEOs, and whenever they're like web to the examples they give

458
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,010
Speaker 6:  me are always Google. It's always Google search. It's always G it's

459
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,820
Speaker 6:  always YouTube, right? These are the web platforms that the blockchain companies

460
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,780
Speaker 6:  are going to disrupt. Are you making big bets? I mean, you and I

461
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,320
Speaker 6:  were talking right now in the middle of like a literal cryptocurrency crash.

462
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,040
Speaker 6:  So I'm assuming you're not making huge bets today, but are you

463
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,500
Speaker 6:  thinking about that next future for Google

464
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,310
Speaker 8:  They'll come in? I too was a big part of why I joined

465
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,210
Speaker 8:  Google and, you know, seeing the transition from

466
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,540
Speaker 8:  the web, moving from content to apps and the excitement around

467
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,140
Speaker 8:  XML has shapey and Ajax and

468
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,830
Speaker 8:  realizing that, you know, maps and Gmail all represent a

469
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,790
Speaker 8:  fundamental shift in how the web works. So I think it's exciting to

470
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,510
Speaker 8:  be anytime the web evolves, but of ever is a big

471
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,360
Speaker 8:  thing. And like, there are no one person can evolve it, like it it's like

472
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,040
Speaker 8:  that's, that's the beauty of the Bab. And so, so I always

473
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,030
Speaker 8:  look at any innovation in a excited try to understand what are the good

474
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,990
Speaker 8:  things coming out of it. And, and so it is still early days though.

475
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,710
Speaker 8:  So that's how I would probably be, probably say, but, you know, I'm

476
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,340
Speaker 8:  always trying to think ahead about what are the key trends bead on

477
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,640
Speaker 8:  computing, bead on how the web servers evolving and trying to

478
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,330
Speaker 8:  see, you know, where Google can contribute, where Google

479
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,140
Speaker 8:  can also lead. And it's, it's a big part of how we should think

480
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,890
Speaker 8:  about not to mention AI being the most important of it

481
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,640
Speaker 8:  all.

482
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,790
Speaker 6:  Do you think of let's call it web three, the blockchain web three

483
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,270
Speaker 6:  stuff, right? The innovation, there is not, there's a lot of cryptographic

484
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,270
Speaker 6:  innovation shore, but the innovation there is not

485
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,200
Speaker 6:  necessarily technological capability. It's I don't

486
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,050
Speaker 6:  have to trust your database. Google is effectively like the world's

487
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,900
Speaker 6:  most powerful database company. There's a very important database at the

488
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,830
Speaker 6:  heart of Google that you can query and get results from. Do you ever think,

489
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,280
Speaker 6:  oh, this will displace the search index or this will displace the YouTube

490
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,990
Speaker 6:  database

491
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,500
Speaker 8:  Look a decent release model. I mean, don't forget dating Skype or at some

492
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,250
Speaker 8:  point on a B2B based smart. I think distributed

493
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,150
Speaker 8:  databases are a hard, interesting computer science challenge too.

494
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,080
Speaker 8:  So I think we get equally excited about that and, you know, and so

495
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,950
Speaker 8:  on. I think it's important to think through user problems, what you're

496
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,880
Speaker 8:  trying to solve and the underlying technology. And so

497
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,750
Speaker 8:  all of that is important, you know, into an asshole

498
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,650
Speaker 8:  he's been anything. It was, you know, the big part I, to make sure you're

499
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,430
Speaker 8:  leading in all these services, will you get disrupted yet

500
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,850
Speaker 8:  by definition, if you're not trying hard enough? Yes. The answer is

501
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,780
Speaker 8:  absolutely 100% yet. I'm like, let me show

502
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,530
Speaker 8:  up to work on Mondays. And yes, I worry about all of this all the

503
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,680
Speaker 8:  time and you know, so maybe I leave it at that.

504
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,160
Speaker 7:  So my, my last question is, tell me what your killer app is for

505
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,130
Speaker 7:  smartwatches. We spend a lot of time debating what smart watches are for,

506
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,070
Speaker 7:  and having now spent a lot of time building one. I'm curious, kind of what

507
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,880
Speaker 7:  you see as like the sort of reason for smart watches at the moment for

508
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,750
Speaker 7:  Google.

509
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,690
Speaker 8:  I'd probably leave it with, I want to make sure the team has something to

510
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,140
Speaker 8:  say in September when they pick some watches.

511
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,890
Speaker 8:  And I think they've pieced it enough

512
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,760
Speaker 8:  that look, I'm excited because I think for

513
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,480
Speaker 8:  me, it's the thing I'm excited about is it's an end to hen

514
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,200
Speaker 8:  hardware portfolio and you will see a lot of the pixel brand

515
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,530
Speaker 8:  identity. And, you know, if you're a big silver user, a lot of

516
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,310
Speaker 8:  the design language and, and some of the customizable, how

517
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,270
Speaker 8:  easy it is to change bands and the expressiveness is, is

518
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,900
Speaker 8:  great in terms of killer apps, love community, look at something like

519
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,890
Speaker 8:  GPS being on phones and, and what happens later,

520
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,760
Speaker 8:  or the fact that XML history be created the whole set of apps. As I talked

521
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,720
Speaker 8:  about earlier, I'm always humbled by when you

522
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,680
Speaker 8:  create underlined capabilities, the creativity of developers outside,

523
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,220
Speaker 8:  you know, it's not the Google they'll have the killer app. You know, I think

524
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,580
Speaker 8:  down the line, someone will do something really cool with it, but I would

525
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,760
Speaker 8:  argue one of the exciting aspects of the big silver watches, of course, Fitbit

526
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,720
Speaker 8:  coming on it, right. You know, Fitbit coming as a service on it is a

527
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,590
Speaker 8:  killer app. We are putting on that watch. And you know, so that is

528
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,600
Speaker 8:  something I'm super excited by.

529
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,480
Speaker 6:  Well, Sundar, thank you so much for coming out of your chest. It's been us

530
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,370
Speaker 6:  always great to talk to you, and I always appreciate that you want to come

531
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,030
Speaker 6:  on the hardcore nerd show. So that's very good. It's good to talk to you

532
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,540
Speaker 8:  Greatly enjoyed it. And thanks for all the focus on, I appreciate it.

533
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,940
Speaker 6:  All right. We got to take a break. We'll be right back with Dan Siefert to

534
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,320
Speaker 6:  wrap up the rest of Google

535
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,430
Speaker 6:  IO.

536
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,900
Speaker 6:  We're back. Dan Seaford. Welcome. Hello. So obviously David and I just talked

537
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,860
Speaker 6:  to Sundar. He's great. By the way, I keep saying this, it takes, it takes

538
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,430
Speaker 6:  real guts for a product CEO to come on. The verge chest Dakota is like, you

539
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,660
Speaker 6:  know, that's where you do your thankful and say on the verge faster, like

540
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,830
Speaker 6:  let's skip down to brass

541
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,370
Speaker 7:  Tacks.

542
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,820
Speaker 6:  So that was great. We had big picture conversation, but there's some stuff

543
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,570
Speaker 6:  at IO that we should talk about with Dan actual

544
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,660
Speaker 6:  products. What's Dan, you have some real feelings about this tablet.

545
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,880
Speaker 7:  I was going to say, we got to start with the tablet,

546
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaker 6:  This tablet. I don't know why they announced it.

547
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,540
Speaker 10:  I haven't been able to figure out why they announced it. So

548
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,080
Speaker 6:  They pre-announced the tablet that's coming out in 2023. What we know about

549
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,010
Speaker 6:  it is that it will have a tensor chip. And that's what we know about

550
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,550
Speaker 6:  it.

551
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,700
Speaker 10:  Well, we know it will have a bigger screen than

552
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,910
Speaker 10:  a phone. It will

553
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,700
Speaker 10:  be rectangular. It apparently has big white bezels.

554
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,560
Speaker 6:  Yep. They announced Basil's that camera's on the middle of the screen landscape.

555
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,190
Speaker 6:  They did that, right. That's a big improvement over your iPads

556
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,150
Speaker 10:  Credit where credit's due.

557
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,900
Speaker 6:  The back looks like plastic. There's a camera on the back as well. It does.

558
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,710
Speaker 6:  They showed us some, they did show us some Android tablet, software stuff,

559
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,090
Speaker 10:  And it yet, and it runs injured,

560
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,340
Speaker 6:  But they showed us, you know, here's some apps running by side. I will say,

561
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,000
Speaker 6:  if you just go watch the event again, watch the tablet,

562
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,990
Speaker 6:  UI presentation, just like rewatch it closely.

563
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,110
Speaker 6:  And it is almost as though they're inventing computers.

564
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,950
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. The, the number of things that they have not even

565
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,160
Speaker 7:  heard of before that, it's like, what if you had an app and then you went

566
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,740
Speaker 7:  to another app, but at the same,

567
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,460
Speaker 6:  At one point they're like, I love using two apps at once. And it's like,

568
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,180
Speaker 6:  yeah, it's pretty good. It's a

569
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,480
Speaker 6:  great actually I've been doing for years, welcome to the party, which is

570
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Speaker 6:  funny. Cause you can already do that on many Android tablets.

571
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Speaker 10:  Yeah. An Android phone. So you can just split screen them very easily.

572
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,850
Speaker 6:  Okay. So then we've been sarcastic, like what do you think they're trying

573
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,110
Speaker 6:  to do with this tablet?

574
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,410
Speaker 10:  It's really hard to say, you know, David talked to Rick Costello. I had

575
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,160
Speaker 10:  a chance to talk to Rick Costello briefly. And every time he mentioned

576
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,670
Speaker 10:  this tablet, he positioned it as a quote,

577
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,450
Speaker 10:  perfect companion to the pixel phone. He called it the pixel tablet onstage.

578
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,440
Speaker 10:  He said, it's a premium, large screen device. They are like filling this

579
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,890
Speaker 10:  gap in their lineup so that they have a full ecosystem ranging all the way

580
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,350
Speaker 10:  from the watch. That will, I'm sure we'll talk about through the phones

581
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,220
Speaker 10:  to tablets, out to laptops with Chromebooks, they've got like the full

582
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,030
Speaker 10:  of the device portfolio in this thing by the time this thing launches. And

583
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,660
Speaker 10:  so like that all makes sense. Like they could just say, we're going to launch

584
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,020
Speaker 10:  a tablet next year and like tell that same story. But for some reason

585
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,590
Speaker 10:  they decided we're going to also show this hyperreal of

586
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,520
Speaker 10:  this tablet, which looks like it was designed in 2014

587
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,970
Speaker 10:  and is like the combination of 2014

588
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,930
Speaker 10:  era Samsung tablet and like an Amazon fire

589
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,170
Speaker 10:  HD. Like if you just mash those together, that's what you got the concept

590
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,440
Speaker 10:  of this tablet. And it's really weird to like use that

591
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,310
Speaker 10:  kind of product, look to build hype for product. That's not coming

592
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,240
Speaker 10:  for seven months a year, whatever, not this calendar year. So

593
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,060
Speaker 10:  like, I really don't understand this announcement at all.

594
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,670
Speaker 7:  I think there's sort of two separate things there, right? There's like if

595
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,540
Speaker 7:  the tablet had been beautiful and cool and exciting and even just like what

596
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,780
Speaker 7:  it was, but with no bezels, that would have been something. And at least

597
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,770
Speaker 7:  I think strategically, Strategically, it makes sense.

598
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,430
Speaker 7:  Right? Cause like the thing Google desperately needs is for people to build

599
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,310
Speaker 7:  tablet apps. Cause the reason Android tablets suck is because Android tablet,

600
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,700
Speaker 7:  apps

601
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,300
Speaker 6:  Suck. No, I disagree really? Oh, I have a, I

602
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,140
Speaker 6:  have a much Wilder conspiracy theory about this whole thing.

603
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,040
Speaker 7:  Okay. Let's do it.

604
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,790
Speaker 6:  They're doing this. This is all just a front run. Cause they said

605
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,720
Speaker 6:  this thing, which makes no sense. They're like there's so much developer

606
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,100
Speaker 6:  interest in Android tablets.

607
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,640
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. I don't believe that for a second.

608
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,320
Speaker 6:  Say they said this on stage and that's when I started doing my

609
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,530
Speaker 6:  own research, developing

610
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:22,240
Speaker 6:  this

611
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,590
Speaker 6:  conspiracy.

612
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,330
Speaker 11:  So sorry.

613
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,750
Speaker 6:  No. Okay. The future, the only way they're going to get people to switch

614
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,590
Speaker 6:  off the iPhone is that they beat apple, the foldables and they

615
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,350
Speaker 6:  create the moment, the hardware form factor, a moment

616
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,250
Speaker 6:  that rules. Right. So, yep. You've got your galaxy folds and

617
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,820
Speaker 6:  whatnot, but like those are still early. You gotta make

618
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,120
Speaker 6:  the mainstream folding phone. And if you unfold

619
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,840
Speaker 6:  the phone and then it's a garbage tablet, you're

620
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,710
Speaker 6:  you're hooped. So the developer interest is not in tablet apps.

621
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,010
Speaker 6:  It's not in this thing. It's in what can I do in the

622
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,610
Speaker 6:  phone unfolds? And so they're building a

623
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,360
Speaker 6:  tablet ecosystem because they know that their, their

624
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,320
Speaker 6:  big upcoming shot to recapture market share from apple is beating

625
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,400
Speaker 6:  apple the folder.

626
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,030
Speaker 7:  So, okay. I hate to burst your bubble on this. That's not a conspiracy theory.

627
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,020
Speaker 7:  That's just true. Like Google, Google told me this and cause we

628
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,180
Speaker 7:  were talking about it. I'm like, you look at the multitasking and it's, and

629
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,050
Speaker 7:  it's like, that's a, that's a foldable phone. And so it's like, if you

630
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,750
Speaker 7:  just take the tablet with the two apps and folded in half, like, oh my God,

631
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,740
Speaker 7:  what does that? And that is like Google considers, foldable phones and

632
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,640
Speaker 7:  tablets to be functionally identical software

633
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,570
Speaker 7:  systems and whether or not that turns out to be a good idea, I think really

634
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,470
Speaker 7:  remains to be seen because I'm not sure that what works well on one

635
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,280
Speaker 7:  unfolded screen is the same as two folding screens, but we will see. But

636
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,180
Speaker 7:  I think you're absolutely right that like the bigger possible wind here

637
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,870
Speaker 7:  for Google solving larger screen Android is on foldable phones than it is

638
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,810
Speaker 7:  on tablets. And I think like this idea that Google has suddenly discovered

639
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,740
Speaker 7:  the iPad is popular, I think is like kind of bonkers.

640
00:39:59,740 --> 00:39:59,890
Speaker 7:  And

641
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,510
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I got a little bit of a head fake.

642
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:05,500
Speaker 10:  Why not tease a pixel foldable, which has been like rumored

643
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,080
Speaker 10:  forever. And like, this is not this, the products that they showed off is

644
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,450
Speaker 10:  not coming out till next year. It's got a while to go because they

645
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,760
Speaker 6:  Got to sell the pixel seven.

646
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,570
Speaker 10:  I mean, this is the company that is like, we're launching a phone in two

647
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,050
Speaker 10:  months, but also we're launching a phone in October. Like,

648
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,800
Speaker 10:  I mean, this is the company that has no concerns about

649
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,640
Speaker 10:  cannibalizing hardware

650
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,850
Speaker 6:  Because they don't sell any funds. They're like, they were like the pixel

651
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,570
Speaker 6:  six sold as much as the pixel four and then pixel five combined, which

652
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,560
Speaker 6:  is one of the harshest cellphones that you can

653
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,250
Speaker 6:  issue. Right. But it's also still not a lot. So then you can announce a

654
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,070
Speaker 6:  pixel seven or a pixel six, eight. You're not like I'm worried about tanking.

655
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,580
Speaker 6:  Why successful pixel six line, if you announce a pixel seven and then announce

656
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,570
Speaker 6:  a pixel foldable like going to, even now, you have

657
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,810
Speaker 6:  no hope of selling as many pixels sevens as pixels four or five and six

658
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,760
Speaker 6:  is combined. It's never going to happen for

659
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Speaker 10:  You.

660
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,740
Speaker 6:  Maybe you got to slow roll it in this way. I think the

661
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,400
Speaker 6:  pixel tablet, whatever this thing is, is all just a gigantic

662
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,670
Speaker 6:  head fake to get people to think that they care about tablets.

663
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,310
Speaker 10:  There's another theory going around because there's been this rumor product

664
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,570
Speaker 10:  for a while. Now that I

665
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,190
Speaker 7:  Was going to ask you about this, this is

666
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:16,090
Speaker 10:  That Google is working on this like nest hub device that has a

667
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,600
Speaker 10:  detachable screen and becomes a tablet. And the theory going around is what

668
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,560
Speaker 10:  the tablet that they showed during the event is the tablet that connects

669
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,430
Speaker 10:  to the nest hub and becomes a smart display when

670
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:31,420
Speaker 10:  it's at home. And there's some like some

671
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,030
Speaker 10:  credibility to that in that the tablet looks like the front of a NetSuite

672
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,960
Speaker 10:  hub. Like if I look at my nest hub max over here, yeah.

673
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,840
Speaker 10:  That's exactly what the tablet looks like, that they showed off. So like

674
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,470
Speaker 10:  sure. Lots of design similarities there. The hesitation I have with that

675
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,100
Speaker 10:  theory is that pixel teams and nest teams are like wholly separate and they

676
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,400
Speaker 10:  have separate branding everything. And they did not call this a nest device.

677
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,090
Speaker 10:  They call it a pixel tablet. And then of course they also didn't show any

678
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,930
Speaker 10:  of that, like functionality or tease any kinds of that, where it would

679
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,890
Speaker 10:  dock into a, a smart display screen or whatever. So I mean far, be

680
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,800
Speaker 10:  it from Google to do something like that. Like, like they are the, like

681
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,130
Speaker 10:  they've done much weirder things and they could possibly turn that into

682
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,700
Speaker 10:  a smart home device or whatever. And, and then it becomes, it's like, well,

683
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,850
Speaker 10:  it's primary purpose is a smart display, but then you can use it as a tablet

684
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,690
Speaker 10:  when you want sometimes, which is like, again, a weird way to frame

685
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,070
Speaker 10:  something as the perfect companion to your pixel phone.

686
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,820
Speaker 6:  Awesome. Lenovo built this front of like six times in a row. Amazon bought

687
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,630
Speaker 6:  the product just like this, right? Like, yeah. It's not a category

688
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,410
Speaker 6:  one, whatever. We'll see, we've got until 20, 23 to argue about

689
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,280
Speaker 6:  these vessels.

690
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,990
Speaker 10:  I don't know why they're white. Like the whole problem was they made them

691
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,400
Speaker 10:  white. Like it's like, you can have big vessels. Okay. There's a place for

692
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,650
Speaker 10:  bezels. You got to put your thumbs, you're holding the tablet or whatever.

693
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,250
Speaker 10:  You can make that argument. Don't make them white. Like it's a, it's a

694
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,200
Speaker 10:  like content consumption device.

695
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,990
Speaker 6:  We'll see. But that's what, that's my conspiracy theory, which David tells

696
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,530
Speaker 6:  me is true.

697
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,310
Speaker 7:  Oh, I, I definitely think you're right. What if, what if it's a smart display

698
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:59,210
Speaker 7:  that you take off and then when you leave to go outside, you fold it closed.

699
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,240
Speaker 7:  What if it's, what if it's a foldable and we didn't even know there's your

700
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,050
Speaker 7:  conspiracy theory.

701
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:03,980
Speaker 6:  There you

702
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,130
Speaker 10:  Go.

703
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,090
Speaker 6:  We should actually quickly talk about the nest hub. Just for one second.

704
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,750
Speaker 6:  Before we titled the pixel watch, they announced a bunch of features to invoke

705
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,530
Speaker 6:  the assistant only for the nest hub max, that require you

706
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,220
Speaker 6:  to look at it because it has a camera. And that was the one part of

707
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,730
Speaker 6:  this whole presentation where I was like, oh, that's too far. I really don't

708
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,510
Speaker 6:  want it. I don't want an always on camera in my, I have the little mess.

709
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,250
Speaker 6:  Cause it doesn't have a camera. Yeah.

710
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,130
Speaker 10:  So, I mean, then you, I guess just wouldn't use this feature, but if you

711
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,940
Speaker 10:  have a nest hub max, and you don't have the camera disabled,

712
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,390
Speaker 10:  then it recognizes you already, like that was a launch feature. Like it

713
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,600
Speaker 10:  says, hi Dan, when I walk up to it or whatever, and it shows my little avatar.

714
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,500
Speaker 10:  And then in theory, if it, if Google ever got its

715
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,440
Speaker 10:  calendar system straight, where it can see my work calendar, it would show

716
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,470
Speaker 10:  my work calendar of events, as opposed to like, if my kids look at it, they

717
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,470
Speaker 10:  would not see my calendar events. So it's already doing that. This is just

718
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,020
Speaker 10:  kind of like the next step of like, oh, you're looking at it. We know you're

719
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,290
Speaker 10:  looking at it. We know you're in range of it. If you just say like start

720
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:04,220
Speaker 10:  a timer, we don't need you to say, Hey G

721
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,360
Speaker 10:  to wake up.

722
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,390
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I don't know the urge. The idea of the camera always looking to see

723
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,910
Speaker 6:  if you're making eye contact with it. Just like don't no,

724
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,510
Speaker 6:  thank you. I don't need to make eye contact at

725
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,470
Speaker 6:  the community.

726
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,540
Speaker 7:  Well, and I think part of this, what's interesting about that to me is like,

727
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,410
Speaker 7:  it's a constant reminder that it is doing that, right? Like the, the thing

728
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,290
Speaker 7:  where you walk up to it and it knows you as, at least you can sort of feel

729
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,530
Speaker 7:  in your brain, like you're doing something to enable it. Even though you're

730
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,500
Speaker 7:  not, it's just watching all the time. But this is like, they're just directly

731
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,410
Speaker 7:  telling you via the feature. Like it's watching you a hundred percent of

732
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,250
Speaker 7:  the time. Anytime you look at it, it knows like, don't, don't forget, like

733
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,720
Speaker 7:  that's a, that's a bold thing.

734
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,710
Speaker 6:  And they said all of the right things when it all happening locally and no

735
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:47,550
Speaker 6:  device, no data leaving the device and data minimization. It just, you know,

736
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,580
Speaker 6:  you can't take a picture of me if there's not a camera on the thing, it's,

737
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,030
Speaker 6:  I'm going to stick with the little ones until, until they forced me out the

738
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,540
Speaker 6:  way, then I'm gonna put tape one, one of my white tape. All right. There's

739
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,330
Speaker 6:  cameras all over my house. I don't even want, I'm talking about there's five

740
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,290
Speaker 6:  cameras on my cell phone that I carry in my pocket. We started

741
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,190
Speaker 6:  pixel watch Dan. It seems like they're trying

742
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,020
Speaker 6:  again in a serious way. They've got this platform they did with Samsung.

743
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,450
Speaker 6:  What do you think?

744
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:16,260
Speaker 10:  Yeah. The pixel watch is interesting. I mean, we've, this thing has been

745
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,710
Speaker 10:  rumored and leak for over a year now and it's still not coming out to the

746
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,380
Speaker 10:  fall. This is one of the announcements along with the pixel seven that it's

747
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,740
Speaker 10:  going to be released in the fall, but here's a teaser look. There's a couple

748
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,890
Speaker 10:  of interesting things with it. I think the big move for it is that this

749
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,460
Speaker 10:  is finally the first product of the

750
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,420
Speaker 10:  Fitbit integration with Google that we're really seeing in a real, tangible

751
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,990
Speaker 10:  way. Google closed. David, was it 2021? Excuse me.

752
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,410
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it closed. Yeah. January, 2021. And they announced the acquisition

753
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,940
Speaker 7:  in like mid 20, 19.

754
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,450
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Like a light literal lifetime ago. They announced that acquisition.

755
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,660
Speaker 10:  And now we're finally getting a product that is using that. So they are

756
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,620
Speaker 10:  going to have like a big fitness integration play, which as we know is

757
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,920
Speaker 10:  what makes the apple watch popular. So that's like a smart move. The

758
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,610
Speaker 10:  watch itself looks pretty nice. I guess

759
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,790
Speaker 10:  it's interesting that they only seem to show one size of it as opposed to

760
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,450
Speaker 10:  multiple sizes. It's got a proprietary bands,

761
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:13,440
Speaker 10:  which is Hm. Maybe, and it's round and

762
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,980
Speaker 10:  it's got a little, little control dial on the side, whatever you call it.

763
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,640
Speaker 10:  One of those,

764
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,850
Speaker 6:  The digital crown that you don't know, this Johnny I've told us this

765
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,300
Speaker 6:  revolutionary

766
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:22,470
Speaker 7:  Input

767
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,210
Speaker 6:  On par with multitouch.

768
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,540
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And like, you know, it's going to be running where ROS three, which

769
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,900
Speaker 10:  is currently only available on Samsung watches. They also announced on stage

770
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,710
Speaker 10:  a bunch of watches from the usual Android watchmakers from

771
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,490
Speaker 10:  fossil and all the brands associated with that are going to be releasing

772
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,920
Speaker 10:  where it was three watches. But so far we've only had an, not a Samsung

773
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,060
Speaker 10:  watch and it's been very much a Samsung driven experience. So when the pixel

774
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,660
Speaker 10:  watch comes out, ideally we would be getting, what is a Google

775
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,660
Speaker 10:  driven experience for an Android smartwatch? Is,

776
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,290
Speaker 6:  Is there any news on the processor, battery life,

777
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,680
Speaker 6:  front new? I mean, this is like the thing that has held this

778
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,000
Speaker 6:  entire category.

779
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,450
Speaker 10:  Yeah. So like for many years, Android wear watches have been relying on

780
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,390
Speaker 10:  many of the Android wear watches have been relying on Qualcomm processors,

781
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,840
Speaker 10:  which Qualcomm has not really put a lot of development into its processors

782
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,530
Speaker 10:  for wearables. And they've been slower and way behind what apple is doing.

783
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,370
Speaker 10:  The only reason that the Samsung watch runs where it was three is because

784
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:21,030
Speaker 10:  it's using a Samsung processor inside of it.

785
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,300
Speaker 10:  The Qualcomm processors that are available thus far, apparently can't run

786
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,660
Speaker 10:  all the features of where it was three. So it'll be interesting to see what

787
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,760
Speaker 10:  processor they do put in this pixel. They did not speak to that at all.

788
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,210
Speaker 10:  They didn't speak to anything in terms of like battery life or features

789
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:38,200
Speaker 10:  like always on display, you would assume that it would have like the Google

790
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,130
Speaker 10:  assistant and you could talk to it. Like you can talk to Siri on the apple

791
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,850
Speaker 10:  watch. They did say that you can control Google home stuff through it. So

792
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,790
Speaker 10:  you can control smart home stuff. It's like all the typical smartwatch stuff

793
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,970
Speaker 10:  we've seen for like years now. Like they're just like putting it all together

794
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,870
Speaker 10:  in one product that'll hopefully work well and not die at like 5:00 PM,

795
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,300
Speaker 10:  which is like a thing that

796
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:58,630
Speaker 6:  They haven't

797
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,340
Speaker 10:  Been able to in the past. So there's a lot of unknowns here. We don't know

798
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,990
Speaker 10:  exactly what it's gonna cost. I think it's going to be more on the premium

799
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,770
Speaker 10:  side. I would be surprised at this thing's under $300. They're using stainless

800
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,070
Speaker 10:  steel with it, which is generally going to pump, push the price up. And

801
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,860
Speaker 10:  if they put a tensor chip in there, we have no idea.

802
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,500
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think the main thing for me is, you know, they went with a circular

803
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,340
Speaker 6:  display, which they've been doing across where for awhile, it does not

804
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,090
Speaker 6:  seem like they have really rethought the UI if there's still a lot

805
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,990
Speaker 6:  of scrolling of rectangular objects in their demos. And it's

806
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,890
Speaker 6:  like, you guys, all right, like we've just been at smartwatches for

807
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,010
Speaker 6:  awhile. Yeah. This isn't a first-generation product kind

808
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,940
Speaker 6:  of problem. But like, here we are and it's still like, well, I guess the

809
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,840
Speaker 6:  edges of that list item will be cut off as a

810
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:43,990
Speaker 6:  scroll.

811
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:47,200
Speaker 10:  That reminds me of like what pebble did with their circular smartwatch many

812
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,770
Speaker 10:  years ago, they would just scroll the whole page. So it perfectly fit each

813
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,250
Speaker 10:  circle. So you couldn't scroll line by line. They would just do an entire

814
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,160
Speaker 10:  page. And each page was rendered to fit the circle.

815
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,490
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, I don't think there's any great solutions except for

816
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:04,000
Speaker 6:  square watches. And then you're stuck with a direct apple comparison. So

817
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,630
Speaker 6:  I kind of get it, but we'll see. I think the Fitbit stuff is really interesting

818
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,870
Speaker 6:  that we've been waiting, but I think the main things for me are like battery

819
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:14,050
Speaker 6:  life. And then obviously they can only, I mean, this is like the pixel buds

820
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,620
Speaker 6:  pro too, right? Like they're starting to make hardware devices that

821
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,370
Speaker 6:  only really work well with their hardware and that's,

822
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:25,120
Speaker 10:  Or at least at least Android hardware, right? Like, you know,

823
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,020
Speaker 10:  I'm sure that the pixel watch will work with other Android phones not made

824
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,800
Speaker 10:  by Google and the pixel buds pro, which they also announced we'll

825
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,190
Speaker 10:  probably work with non Google phones. Maybe there might be a feature or

826
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:39,430
Speaker 10:  two that you get with a pixel that you don't get on a Samsung phone, but

827
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,340
Speaker 10:  like, they really are not designed to work with iPhones at all.

828
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,970
Speaker 10:  So like you probably won't be able to pair the watch with an iPhone. You

829
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,970
Speaker 10:  might be able to pair the pixel buds with an iPhone, but then have no access

830
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,760
Speaker 10:  to any feature control or anything like that. They will just be like very

831
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,900
Speaker 10:  basic Bluetooth headphones,

832
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,600
Speaker 6:  Just wait until the Europeans hear about this.

833
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,530
Speaker 7:  Well, and on that same level, what do we know about how Fitbit gets integrated

834
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,020
Speaker 7:  into things? Because one thing that is true is there are a lot of people

835
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,680
Speaker 7:  out there in the world who love Fitbits and have used them for a

836
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,070
Speaker 7:  long time, who might theoretically want a device like this. But what I can't

837
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,790
Speaker 7:  get a sense of is like, is Fitbit going to be a

838
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,490
Speaker 7:  separate service, like Google fit that others can use? Is it going to be

839
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,980
Speaker 7:  part of Android? Is it just going to be for the pixel watch? Like, did they

840
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,130
Speaker 7:  spend all this money on this company just for the pixel watch? Do we have

841
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,250
Speaker 7:  any idea how this is going to shake out?

842
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,740
Speaker 10:  Yeah. It's hard to say, I know that James Park who

843
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,310
Speaker 10:  is CEO, or he was a CEO before the acquisition. I don't know what his current

844
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:35,270
Speaker 10:  title is now, but he's basically the leader of Fitbit. He did say that when

845
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,720
Speaker 10:  the pixel watch launches, Google fit is still gonna exist for

846
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,380
Speaker 10:  whatever reason. So they're going to, they're going to run concurrently.

847
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,170
Speaker 10:  Fitbit is going to be making other hardware. They've got trackers, they've

848
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,890
Speaker 10:  got their other smartwatch lines, but apparently it was his team

849
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,550
Speaker 10:  that drove the development of the pixel watch. So there's a lot

850
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,450
Speaker 10:  of Fitbit expertise built into this, maybe in the way that the watch

851
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,330
Speaker 10:  wears the way it fits you, the way it kind of works as a

852
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,020
Speaker 10:  functional watch, it seemed like they leverage a lot of that Fitbit experience.

853
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,950
Speaker 10:  But as far as like what the platforms do, it's still like up in the

854
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,820
Speaker 10:  air, you know how that's going to shake out. And, and are you going to have

855
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,600
Speaker 10:  to fitness apps on your watch? Like if you have a Samsung watch, you do,

856
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,140
Speaker 10:  you've got Google fit and you've got Samsung health and you could install

857
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,280
Speaker 10:  any others, but yeah.

858
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,760
Speaker 7:  And I'm sure there's a team at Google working on like Android

859
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,690
Speaker 7:  fitness pro and that'll come too. And it'll it all just be really delightful.

860
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,960
Speaker 6:  As Sandra told us, they're focusing man, ecosystems,

861
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,350
Speaker 10:  What are we doing?

862
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:34,280
Speaker 6:  All right. Last thing real quick. I feel like we can actually get through

863
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,210
Speaker 6:  it real quick. They tease the pixel seven and seven pro. They

864
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,990
Speaker 6:  also announced the pixel six, eight, but fine. Yeah. It's

865
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:44,810
Speaker 6:  450 bucks. It has a millimeter wave which had 450 bucks, I think might be

866
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,660
Speaker 6:  one of the only phones. Well, oh no. They tell us something

867
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,570
Speaker 6:  wrong a little bit. Yeah.

868
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:54,140
Speaker 10:  Shocker that Google had their specs wrong on their

869
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,890
Speaker 10:  wireless radios. The unlocked $450 version

870
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,640
Speaker 10:  does not have millimeter wave. The version that Verizon is selling

871
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,940
Speaker 10:  is $500 and it does have millimeter wave. So you get to pay

872
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,300
Speaker 10:  a 10%, 10%. Yeah. 10% tax

873
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,760
Speaker 10:  to get millimeter wave of horizon.

874
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,750
Speaker 6:  Very good. Just what everybody wants, who was, who hasn't wanted

875
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,590
Speaker 6:  to stand at her one street corner in download in pirate movies

876
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,680
Speaker 6:  at blazing fast speeds on their $450 a month.

877
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,680
Speaker 10:  The other interesting thing about the pixel six, eight real quick is that

878
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,310
Speaker 10:  it is aggressively priced and, but it runs the same

879
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,490
Speaker 10:  tensor processor as the pixel six and six pro, but it does not have the

880
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:34,760
Speaker 10:  same camera system as the six and six pro. Instead, it appears to have the

881
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,480
Speaker 10:  same camera system as the five and five <inaudible> from

882
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,470
Speaker 10:  before it. And this is the first time that the, a line Alison

883
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,420
Speaker 10:  Johnson on our team pointed this out, that like, this is the first time

884
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:48,050
Speaker 10:  that the a line has a different camera system than

885
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,590
Speaker 10:  the flagship pixels. So Google treated a

886
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:55,370
Speaker 10:  better processor for inferior camera. And it made that trade this year,

887
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,860
Speaker 10:  which is, which is interesting. That's obviously what apple does with the

888
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,580
Speaker 10:  se line on its budget phones. It's got the latest eight, 15 processor, but

889
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,610
Speaker 10:  it's got an inferior camera compared to the rest of the iPhone. So it's

890
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,710
Speaker 10:  interesting that Google made that transition this year.

891
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:10,610
Speaker 6:  Well, I think they're all focused on tensor, right? Like they, they said

892
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,470
Speaker 6:  nothing about these cameras at all,

893
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,210
Speaker 10:  Other than they're 12 million pixels.

894
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,390
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Correct. And then they teased the seven and seven

895
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,570
Speaker 6:  pro, which are still ugly. I don't know

896
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,330
Speaker 6:  what else they, they

897
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:27,030
Speaker 10:  Carry on that, that design language and either you like it or you

898
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,180
Speaker 10:  don't. And, and the one thing that they're changing with the seven pro is

899
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,480
Speaker 10:  interesting is on the six and six pro the, the

900
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,170
Speaker 10:  camera bar, or as Dieter used to call it, the shelf

901
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,830
Speaker 10:  was glass. If you didn't use a case and you put your phone down, you're

902
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,050
Speaker 10:  putting the glass like camera lens right down on

903
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,750
Speaker 7:  The brake. The third time you did it

904
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,290
Speaker 10:  Very frequently broke. So they are shifting that to like an aluminum band

905
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,080
Speaker 10:  that has cutouts for the camera in it. So that's gonna be a little bit different

906
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,710
Speaker 10:  of a look. Maybe there'll be more durable or what have you. The other thing

907
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,590
Speaker 10:  we know about the pixel seven and seven pro is that they will have a second

908
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:00,090
Speaker 10:  generation tensor chip in them. Yeah.

909
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:03,540
Speaker 6:  I just, they're not beautiful. Maybe it won't go all the way to the

910
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,530
Speaker 6:  U word

911
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,450
Speaker 10:  I need. I've seen, I've seen worse design.

912
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,900
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You've seen that pixel tab.

913
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,740
Speaker 7:  What if you could dock your phone to your nests smart

914
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,220
Speaker 7:  hub. Yeah,

915
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,520
Speaker 10:  Yeah, yeah. Didn't the Seuss do that like 10 years ago, you dock the phone

916
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,500
Speaker 10:  to the tablet

917
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,310
Speaker 6:  Period now where like early 2010s

918
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:26,760
Speaker 6:  product innovation, like enough people have forgotten

919
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,350
Speaker 6:  it. Yeah. We're like, we're just going to do like

920
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,220
Speaker 10:  A tricks time to shine, baby

921
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,610
Speaker 6:  Docks here. You can turn this phone into a shit windows, computer. Let's

922
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,570
Speaker 6:  do it. You guys heard of Linux on the desktop.

923
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,930
Speaker 6:  This is the year. All right. There's other stuff they brought that wallet.

924
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,970
Speaker 6:  I mean, it's all on the side. Just bring it back.

925
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:45,540
Speaker 10:  The

926
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,760
Speaker 6:  Hits. It is very much. Google is in a and

927
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,350
Speaker 6:  again, you just heard us talking sooner. If they're more focused, they're

928
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:56,220
Speaker 6:  actually trying to deliver on this stuff. It's interesting.

929
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,590
Speaker 6:  I would not say there's they announced anything that was wildly new at this

930
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:00,780
Speaker 6:  year site.

931
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,050
Speaker 10:  No, I mean, I think we'll see. I think that the fall hardware launch will

932
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,980
Speaker 10:  be interesting because one will obviously learn more about the pixel

933
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,820
Speaker 10:  sevens and the pixel watch. But I have a feeling, just a hunch that if

934
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,600
Speaker 10:  they're willing to tease the tablet IO, maybe they will tease a foldable

935
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,000
Speaker 10:  in the fall if they're not ready to launch yet, because that thing's been

936
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,870
Speaker 10:  rumored forever.

937
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,220
Speaker 7:  That's a good theory. All

938
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,960
Speaker 6:  Right. I've been doing my own research.

939
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,790
Speaker 10:  Yes. You've been Googling

940
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:27,360
Speaker 7:  Dan. Thank you. We will see you again here soon. We're going to take a break,

941
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,960
Speaker 7:  but before we do that, the crypto world is insane right

942
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,050
Speaker 7:  now. And we could spend like nine hours talking about it, but instead we

943
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,690
Speaker 7:  just grabbed Lizel Pato and decided to spend like 10 minutes trying to figure

944
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:40,620
Speaker 7:  out what's going on in crypto. So here's

945
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:44,580
Speaker 7:  that Liz Lopatto. Hi, welcome to what we're calling crypto

946
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,820
Speaker 7:  corner. The new possibly only ever happening once the segment on the

947
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,030
Speaker 7:  first Katz.

948
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:54,810
Speaker 13:  Well welcome ladies and gentlemen, my fellow dirt bags and everybody else

949
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,090
Speaker 13:  here we are. It's time to talk about money.

950
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,120
Speaker 7:  Okay. So there's a million things we could talk about, but I think the like

951
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,870
Speaker 7:  general story here is crypto is falling apart. And as far as I can tell,

952
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:07,830
Speaker 7:  and please correct me if I'm wrong. A lot of this comes back to Luna

953
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:11,730
Speaker 7:  and Tara as like the, the sort of middle of all of the chaos. If

954
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,490
Speaker 7:  you had to pick one, it seems like it's, that is that fair

955
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:18,270
Speaker 13:  Kind of, okay. So I'm going to like zoom way back and then we're going

956
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:21,750
Speaker 13:  to zoom forward to Luna and Tara. So one of the things about an asset, like

957
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,540
Speaker 13:  a cryptocurrency is that it's super risky. And for the last

958
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,080
Speaker 13:  several years we've been living with very, very low

959
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,740
Speaker 13:  interest rates like near zero. The reason why we've had

960
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,250
Speaker 13:  near zero interest rate policy is to stimulate the

961
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,640
Speaker 13:  economy during the pandemic. And so in this environment, it doesn't necessarily

962
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,520
Speaker 13:  make sense to put your money in safe investments because you're not going

963
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,480
Speaker 13:  to earn enough interest to keep up with inflation. So a bunch of weird shit

964
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,110
Speaker 13:  happened. We've got SPACs, we've got meme stocks, we got MNF tees.

965
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:53,950
Speaker 13:  And like a lot of the like sort of weirdness is because there was so

966
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,040
Speaker 13:  much money, like sloshing around and looking for places to

967
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,910
Speaker 13:  have returns that inevitably it spilled into some of these

968
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,600
Speaker 13:  other areas. But also, like, I think some people got bored during the pandemic

969
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,050
Speaker 13:  and risk can be really fun. Like that's the point of the gambling

970
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,010
Speaker 13:  industry? So a lot of people got involved with like

971
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:15,880
Speaker 13:  trading anyway, around November, the fed indicated that it was going to

972
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,480
Speaker 13:  raise interest rates. And that by the way, was the peak of the crypto market

973
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,020
Speaker 13:  was November. And then last week the

974
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,990
Speaker 13:  fed increased the interest rates by half a percentage point, which is like

975
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,890
Speaker 13:  the biggest increase in 20 years. And so we all saw like the stocks

976
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:33,610
Speaker 13:  fall, right? Crypto has been falling farther because it's much

977
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:36,940
Speaker 13:  more volatile. And anybody who's looking to de-risk is probably going

978
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,570
Speaker 13:  to start with crypto. And so to get to

979
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,560
Speaker 13:  your question about Luna and Tara, I think maybe it's helpful

980
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,400
Speaker 13:  to understand in the crypto ecosystem, what a stable coin

981
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:48,640
Speaker 13:  is

982
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,330
Speaker 7:  Because stable Queens are supposed to be like immune to all of this. Isn't

983
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:56,320
Speaker 7:  that like they're literally called stable coins, right? Like all this

984
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,200
Speaker 7:  chaos should not be affecting stable coins.

985
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,440
Speaker 13:  Oh, that's fun. Because some

986
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,370
Speaker 13:  economic research from Bruce Ms. Rack, he's an

987
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:10,120
Speaker 13:  economist and he looked at stable coins and they're not that

988
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,690
Speaker 13:  stable actually like 80% of them go to zero. But the idea behind a

989
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,530
Speaker 13:  stable coin is essentially that it's pegged to

990
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,490
Speaker 13:  something like, let's say a dollar just for simplicity's sake. So you have

991
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,330
Speaker 13:  something like tether, which is supposed to represent a dollar in the

992
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:28,870
Speaker 13:  crypto ecosystem and is theoretically backed by reserves. I

993
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,810
Speaker 13:  say theoretically, because there are a lot of questions about tethers reserves

994
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:35,800
Speaker 13:  and we'll get there in a second. But the idea is that if you want

995
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,610
Speaker 13:  to exit, let's say your Bitcoin position and you want to move into, let's

996
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:43,300
Speaker 13:  say a theorem. One way to do that is to cash out

997
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,870
Speaker 13:  through tether or another stable coin. That's about equivalent to a dollar

998
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:50,830
Speaker 13:  and then move into the Ethereum ecosystem as for why you might want

999
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:53,800
Speaker 13:  to do that. Well, it's really difficult to go

1000
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,580
Speaker 13:  between crypto and fiasco or what you and I understand to

1001
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,530
Speaker 13:  be money like dollar

1002
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,690
Speaker 7:  Real human people, money. Yeah.

1003
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:05,590
Speaker 13:  I mean, as real as money ever is. And so that's partly because of

1004
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:09,490
Speaker 13:  like things like, you know, anti money laundering regulations,

1005
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,210
Speaker 13:  stuff like that, it sometimes takes a couple of days for your crypto investment

1006
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,870
Speaker 13:  to show up in your like dollar bank account. So if you want to do trading

1007
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:20,320
Speaker 13:  more quickly than that, you move into a dollar equivalent, which is a stable

1008
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,900
Speaker 13:  coin. Those are used to do things like

1009
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,230
Speaker 13:  create loans in the device space, bunch of other stuff in

1010
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,770
Speaker 13:  the ecosystem with something like tether it's backed

1011
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,620
Speaker 13:  by reserves. Now, like there are questions about tethers reserves, which

1012
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:37,520
Speaker 13:  I got into at length last year. But the thing about Tara

1013
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,270
Speaker 13:  and Luna about that ecosystem is that it is an

1014
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:44,570
Speaker 13:  algorithmic stable coin, which is if possible, worse than a regular one.

1015
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:48,500
Speaker 13:  The thing about algorithmic stable coins is that

1016
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,400
Speaker 13:  I'm trying to think of a real gentle way to put this and

1017
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,900
Speaker 13:  I'm not coming up with one.

1018
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,770
Speaker 7:  I think it's increasingly not in need of a gentle explanation based on

1019
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:58,550
Speaker 7:  what's happened.

1020
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,970
Speaker 13:  And basically the way that this works is you

1021
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,510
Speaker 13:  have two, two coins, right? One of them is

1022
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:09,350
Speaker 13:  called Tara and Tara is supposed to be worth $1. And

1023
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:13,190
Speaker 13:  the other is called Luna. And that value floats. So it's worth whatever

1024
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,150
Speaker 13:  somebody wants to pay for it. The same as like, I don't know, Bitcoin, Ethereum,

1025
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:20,900
Speaker 13:  whatever. Now the two can be converted into each other. So let's say Luna's

1026
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,140
Speaker 13:  were 30, which it was recently and certainly is not right now, but like,

1027
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,710
Speaker 13:  let's say it's worth 30. You can destroy Luna and get

1028
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,580
Speaker 13:  30 Tara because Tara is worth a dollar each. Right.

1029
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,090
Speaker 13:  And so if Tara's worth less than a dollar and you can think

1030
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,960
Speaker 13:  to yourself, oh, great idea. I'm going to destroy,

1031
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,110
Speaker 13:  I don't know, like 45 Tara to create

1032
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:45,650
Speaker 13:  one Luna at a discount, which, you

1033
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:49,190
Speaker 13:  know, decreases the supply of Tara, making it more valuable, pulling it

1034
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,940
Speaker 13:  back up to a dollar. And if you're thinking, wait a minute. But like what

1035
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,600
Speaker 13:  makes this valuable? The answer is belief

1036
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,350
Speaker 13:  in community. And so, you know, if you believe in this stuff,

1037
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:04,280
Speaker 13:  if you're in Luna, this can be useful because you're

1038
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,210
Speaker 13:  like, oh, a number go up. This is great. And you feel like, sort of

1039
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,360
Speaker 13:  backed by arbitrage, but the moment that confidence

1040
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,660
Speaker 13:  is lost, then you find yourself in a really

1041
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,320
Speaker 13:  interesting position because you can essentially buy dollars at

1042
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,280
Speaker 13:  a discounted price. So if you know,

1043
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,970
Speaker 13:  you dump everything, then they both fail and we've hit

1044
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:29,930
Speaker 13:  this point of failure. And to be clear, the people behind this project

1045
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,790
Speaker 13:  are trying to like fix things.

1046
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,860
Speaker 7:  Well, and that's the last piece of this we're going to get into before I

1047
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:37,790
Speaker 7:  let you go. Cause it's, it gets even crazier. But yeah, like I keep

1048
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:40,190
Speaker 7:  looking and I feel like every time I refresh the page, the value of Linda

1049
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,840
Speaker 7:  goes down further and further.

1050
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,770
Speaker 13:  So right now it's worth 2 cents,

1051
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:49,710
Speaker 13:  which just to be clear, like as of like April

1052
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:54,020
Speaker 13:  4th, it was worth $116. So some people

1053
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,620
Speaker 13:  just really got like wrecked in a really, really

1054
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:01,250
Speaker 13:  painful way that I am genuinely sorry for, because like the

1055
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:05,120
Speaker 13:  thing about money and the thing about investments is that they play

1056
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,080
Speaker 13:  on human emotions. And like the biggest thing in the crypto space

1057
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,950
Speaker 13:  is like hope and greed versus fear, uncertainty and doubt, or what people

1058
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:16,310
Speaker 13:  like to call FID. And so like, if you look at

1059
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:20,220
Speaker 13:  Tara's price right now, you know, for the, the UST the

1060
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,700
Speaker 13:  thing that's supposed to be worth a dollar it's worth 38 cents at the time

1061
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,600
Speaker 13:  of this recording,

1062
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,450
Speaker 7:  Which is definitively not a dollar.

1063
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,230
Speaker 13:  Correct. And so like, I love the arbitrage idea of buying a dollar

1064
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,490
Speaker 13:  for 38 cents. Cause that's a lot of profit for me, assuming I

1065
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:38,850
Speaker 13:  can exit the trade, which I may not be able to do at this point. So that's

1066
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:42,420
Speaker 13:  kind of what's going on. You're in a death spiral. Now what

1067
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,110
Speaker 13:  has happened is that the people behind this

1068
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:49,620
Speaker 13:  ecosystem have halted the blockchain, they say

1069
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:53,610
Speaker 13:  to prevent governance attacks. But I think like that's like the only

1070
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:57,360
Speaker 13:  way that you can make the death cycle stop and like reset it if

1071
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,150
Speaker 13:  that's even possible, which I, I don't think it is

1072
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:03,480
Speaker 7:  Just by literally not letting people continue to sell.

1073
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,870
Speaker 13:  Yeah. And like, to be clear, like this is not that unusual in the

1074
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:10,560
Speaker 13:  regular financial system, right? Like the markets and the

1075
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,100
Speaker 13:  regular financial system close it, like for when there's some aftermarket

1076
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,920
Speaker 13:  trading, whatever. But like, you can, like, you're not going to get wrecked

1077
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,730
Speaker 13:  while you're asleep. The problem with cryptocurrency

1078
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,480
Speaker 13:  ecosystem is that the markets are always open. And so there's no time to

1079
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,630
Speaker 13:  like pause and like reevaluate your position and

1080
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:31,380
Speaker 13:  like restrategize and like get out of your feelings. Because like one of

1081
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,310
Speaker 13:  the biggest things that like happens during periods, like this is panic

1082
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:38,250
Speaker 13:  selling where people sell stuff that actually might be good, but they're

1083
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:41,340
Speaker 13:  so freaked out about all their losses that they don't like, think it all

1084
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,430
Speaker 13:  the way through and sell. And so like, you know, if

1085
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:48,360
Speaker 13:  you're opportunistic, like when you see a bear market like this, you start

1086
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,930
Speaker 13:  thinking, okay, when do I want to buy in? Because like, there are plenty

1087
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,560
Speaker 13:  of people who are in this space who think that, you know, cryptocurrency

1088
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,040
Speaker 13:  is going to come back because so far it has. And like I've seen a lot of

1089
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,490
Speaker 13:  people sort of reassuring each other and themselves. Like I remember when

1090
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:06,090
Speaker 13:  Bitcoin like plunged in, you know, 2018. And like, I remember all of these

1091
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,840
Speaker 13:  crypto winters, whatever. I guess one of the things that I find myself

1092
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,590
Speaker 13:  really interested in is like, are we going to see this

1093
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:17,250
Speaker 13:  chaos going into the regular markets? Because you know, there

1094
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,670
Speaker 13:  are cryptocurrencies that are on the stock exchange right now, like Coinbase,

1095
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:24,210
Speaker 13:  like that's, that's a publicly traded company, like things

1096
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:27,780
Speaker 13:  going wrong for crypto. It means things going wrong for Coinbase in the

1097
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:31,110
Speaker 13:  Coinbase shareholders. And of course, Coinbase has been plunging also as

1098
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:35,040
Speaker 13:  all of this is happening. And so, like, I can't tell you for sure that this

1099
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,940
Speaker 13:  is going to stay contained to crypto. I hope it is. But there's

1100
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,750
Speaker 13:  the possibility that there are linkages between these two systems. So between

1101
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,990
Speaker 13:  like trad five and crypto, but also because like a lot of the people who

1102
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:49,380
Speaker 13:  are in crypto are retail investors. And so it may just be that we're going

1103
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:53,040
Speaker 13:  to see a lot of retail capitulation. And so if they

1104
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,030
Speaker 13:  decide that like all risk assets are a problem, then

1105
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:00,930
Speaker 13:  there's spillover. So it's,

1106
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:04,800
Speaker 13:  I don't know what happens. I am absolutely riveted. And

1107
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,400
Speaker 13:  you know, I know that some of our listeners are into crypto into the

1108
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,360
Speaker 13:  crypto ecosystem. If you're in crypto and you want to talk about this

1109
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,540
Speaker 13:  and like, let me know what's going on from your position, like email me,

1110
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:19,420
Speaker 13:  I'm liz@theverge.com. I am genuinely

1111
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,330
Speaker 13:  curious about what's happening to retail investors right now. And like,

1112
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:25,960
Speaker 13:  if this is you, like, what are you thinking? How's it going

1113
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,740
Speaker 13:  like, please drop me a line. I'm I think there's carnage in the markets.

1114
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,600
Speaker 13:  And I think there's more carnage coming.

1115
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,120
Speaker 7:  Fair enough. All right. Well, we're going to come back to all of that on

1116
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,180
Speaker 7:  the next episode of crypto corner, which is probably a segment they'll never

1117
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,140
Speaker 7:  let us do again, but I hope we do. Thank you, Liz. Appreciate it. And

1118
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,910
Speaker 7:  we are for real, going to take a break this time. We'll be

1119
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:47,140
Speaker 7:  right

1120
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:47,290
Speaker 7:  back.

1121
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,690
Speaker 6:  We are back apologies to the crypto verse. If things work out

1122
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,970
Speaker 6:  for you, Alex Kranz is here. Hey Alex,

1123
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,880
Speaker 5:  Hey, I'm very excited to not talk about crypto.

1124
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,570
Speaker 6:  Well, that makes just one now. So this is great. Liz is a refocus. She's

1125
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:41,080
Speaker 6:  on the crypto beat now. So now when, whenever we need anything, Liz

1126
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,650
Speaker 6:  is there. That's great. She's there. And what a time to be on the crutch

1127
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,320
Speaker 6:  of heat. That's where I talked about that with Alex, Alex, we're talking

1128
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,980
Speaker 6:  about the lightening for classic Vergecast.

1129
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,550
Speaker 5:  Yes. I love that. There's like currently a threat to the

1130
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,600
Speaker 5:  lightning port,

1131
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,950
Speaker 6:  A looming threat,

1132
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:00,940
Speaker 5:  A looming threat. It's it's been looming for like a decade now,

1133
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,630
Speaker 5:  but no, it's really, really looming. There's we're getting more and more

1134
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,500
Speaker 5:  reports that they're going to finally get rid of the lightning port on

1135
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,310
Speaker 5:  the iPhone and the air pods and replace it with USB-C.

1136
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:15,770
Speaker 6:  If you drop it off the iPhone, you got your hoop, you gotta take it

1137
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:17,270
Speaker 6:  off. Everything,

1138
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:17,690
Speaker 5:  Everything. Yeah.

1139
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:21,200
Speaker 6:  That's the end of it. It's it's actually, there's like some really inside

1140
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,010
Speaker 6:  tech journalism based while here. So there's a very famous

1141
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:28,940
Speaker 6:  analyst, Ming. She quo who issues reports, great

1142
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:32,810
Speaker 6:  track record on apple rumors, surveys, the supply

1143
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:36,110
Speaker 6:  chains, component suppliers. He is a

1144
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,640
Speaker 6:  controversial figure. Apple

1145
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,620
Speaker 6:  hates and

1146
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:45,530
Speaker 6:  Accusations that he's bribing, like all the stuff, but he is an analyst.

1147
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:49,460
Speaker 6:  He is deeply sourced in the supply chains and component

1148
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,220
Speaker 6:  world gets a lot of apple stuff, right? Sometimes he get some stuff wrong.

1149
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:56,150
Speaker 6:  I'm only saying this to set up the fact that now they have a Twitter, which

1150
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,060
Speaker 6:  is just not where you would like your stuff used to come out. That max sites

1151
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,370
Speaker 6:  would get it for sure. Right? The

1152
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,450
Speaker 5:  Reason is

1153
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:06,110
Speaker 7:  Yeah, but all like percolate out from his analysts, from the analyst reports

1154
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:10,070
Speaker 7:  that it was like, you never quite knew where it was coming from.

1155
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,860
Speaker 7:  Somebody got an email that they sent to somebody else and then it eventually

1156
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,120
Speaker 7:  ended up on the internet. Yeah.

1157
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But now he's like, whatever, I got a Twitter, Twitter has

1158
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,710
Speaker 6:  got six months left and I'm going hard for the last six months.

1159
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:25,220
Speaker 6:  So he's tweeting directly now. And he says, my latest survey indicates in

1160
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,580
Speaker 6:  second half of 23, new I-phones will abandon lightening and switched

1161
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:32,540
Speaker 6:  to USB-C. And then the suppliers, the USB-C

1162
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,230
Speaker 6:  ecosystem will become they're going to do great. So what he's basically saying

1163
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:40,100
Speaker 6:  is I've talked to all the suppliers and they're expecting USBC sales to go

1164
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,160
Speaker 6:  through the roof because apple sending it, this is this true or not. We don't

1165
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,030
Speaker 6:  know good track record, but you put this next to when they announced lightening,

1166
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:49,730
Speaker 6:  they said it was Phil Schiller said, it's a connector for the next decade.

1167
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,170
Speaker 6:  And they've hit the mark.

1168
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:52,820
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Is this year? The decade?

1169
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:56,660
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They're like, they're done September, 2012, Phil Schiller

1170
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:59,330
Speaker 6:  called lightening a modern connector for the next decade.

1171
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:02,030
Speaker 5:  So technically they kept their promise to

1172
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:05,240
Speaker 6:  Made it a decade. That's true. All the rumors were that they were going to

1173
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:09,050
Speaker 6:  go portlets and just do wireless charging. And then I think they released

1174
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:12,080
Speaker 6:  a mag safe in wireless charging. And then every apple

1175
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,860
Speaker 6:  executive experienced what wireless charging is like. And they're

1176
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,710
Speaker 6:  like, cables are still pretty good at this.

1177
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:22,190
Speaker 7:  And they can sell cables for so much money. You can buy a

1178
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:25,970
Speaker 7:  10 foot apple cable for $40,000 and the margins

1179
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,900
Speaker 7:  pretty good.

1180
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,590
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's every day Tim cook gets an email. That's like, this is how

1181
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:34,310
Speaker 6:  many, $150 Thunderbolt cables we sold. And he's like, well, that's

1182
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:37,970
Speaker 6:  the future of the business. We'll see. They've they have been very committed

1183
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:41,410
Speaker 6:  to lightening. They have not wanted to let it go, but it's it's time. Doesn't

1184
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:42,620
Speaker 6:  it feel like it's time.

1185
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:45,890
Speaker 5:  I have they been committed. Cause they've already pretty much taken out most

1186
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,660
Speaker 5:  of the iPads at this point.

1187
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,960
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's still only in the cheapest couple and that's about it.

1188
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,950
Speaker 5:  And it just feels like a legacy thing. Much. Like most of those really cheap

1189
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:58,910
Speaker 5:  iPads, like most of the components of them are legacy components. So

1190
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:02,690
Speaker 5:  I could see it. We're doing a brand new iPhone. We're doing a brand

1191
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:06,590
Speaker 5:  new air pots, USBC, and then we all cry.

1192
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:08,930
Speaker 5:  And there's like, at least one analyst, how you think said they were going

1193
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:12,900
Speaker 5:  to shave their eyebrows. If it actually happens, that guy will have no

1194
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,290
Speaker 5:  eyebrows.

1195
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,450
Speaker 6:  Twitter's getting weird. And these last six months of Twitter, it's just

1196
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:16,920
Speaker 6:  getting weird,

1197
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,480
Speaker 5:  Super weird.

1198
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,260
Speaker 6:  A SOC that's the big rumor. It's funny. Cause that came right on top of the

1199
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,770
Speaker 6:  news. Apple was going to discontinue the iPod. But while the

1200
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:28,770
Speaker 6:  iPod touch, which was like ancient at

1201
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,910
Speaker 6:  this point,

1202
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,410
Speaker 5:  It's an iPhone seven. Yeah.

1203
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:34,620
Speaker 6:  It had the iPhone seven ship in it. But you know, we just had Tony Fidel

1204
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:38,130
Speaker 6:  on decoder. He was on his big Tories and tweeting all these pictures

1205
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:41,460
Speaker 6:  of iPods. He got in a little, I would say like a respectful

1206
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,210
Speaker 6:  bro argument with Phil Schiller on Twitter who had the idea for

1207
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:48,510
Speaker 6:  the wheel and where the idea for the wheel came and it ended up sounding

1208
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:51,450
Speaker 6:  like loved working with you, man. Do like in the middle of your, like, this

1209
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:55,110
Speaker 6:  could go another way, but it's just like a moment. The iPod had a moment

1210
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,800
Speaker 6:  in the past couple weeks. Is it the Fidel book? I'm just going to say, I

1211
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,830
Speaker 6:  was thinking about how much stuff I used to have in my pockets all the time.

1212
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:05,790
Speaker 6:  So it was an iPod, but I always had a classic. I always had the big

1213
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:09,570
Speaker 6:  dog. I had Canon Powershot elf. That was very important to

1214
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:13,080
Speaker 6:  me and God, thank God. Those pictures in

1215
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:17,070
Speaker 6:  survive, Sony, Sony candybar phone, always those three

1216
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:18,540
Speaker 6:  things. And I had to charge them all every night.

1217
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,790
Speaker 5:  And you had to wear cargo pants?

1218
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:24,420
Speaker 6:  No, I didn't have cargo pants. I'm like a jacket oriented person. And

1219
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,260
Speaker 6:  I was like, What were you? Did you have, were you permanent

1220
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:28,910
Speaker 6:  iPod person?

1221
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:32,610
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. I had a gold iPod mini that went absolutely everywhere with me for

1222
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,920
Speaker 7:  a very long time. It was

1223
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,250
Speaker 5:  Incredible.

1224
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,770
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Oh, I loved it. It got, it was one of the things like that. It got

1225
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:41,730
Speaker 7:  stolen out of my car. And I still remember like where I was,

1226
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:45,030
Speaker 7:  what the weather was like, where my car was parked. Like I remember it, it

1227
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,870
Speaker 7:  was a, it was one of those moments in my life that like is so

1228
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,960
Speaker 7:  scarred into me because that's when someone stole my iPod and I couldn't

1229
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,080
Speaker 7:  afford to buy anyone, but I still had the white headphones. So I plugged

1230
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,010
Speaker 7:  those into my crappy other MP3 player. I kept using it and it was kind of

1231
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:00,390
Speaker 7:  like I had an iPad.

1232
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:04,140
Speaker 5:  My original iPod was also a disappeared. I have no idea who

1233
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,950
Speaker 5:  took it. I suspect my brother. I've never found it. It

1234
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,060
Speaker 5:  never reappeared.

1235
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,770
Speaker 6:  Well, if he's listening now,

1236
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:14,580
Speaker 5:  I, since I've moved many times, so who was in any of those places? I would

1237
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:18,210
Speaker 5:  have found it when I moved. Right. But it wasn't there. So

1238
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:21,930
Speaker 5:  who knows. And then I got an iPod shuffle. It was not the same.

1239
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,820
Speaker 6:  Did he have the one without any buttons?

1240
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:27,690
Speaker 5:  Yes. I had that one and I had like the USB stick looking

1241
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,470
Speaker 5:  one.

1242
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:28,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1243
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,350
Speaker 5:  That was my favorite because I felt, I would feel like a spy. I'd go to like

1244
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:35,250
Speaker 5:  the college computer lab and it'd be like, I'm in

1245
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,010
Speaker 5:  guys feel very, very

1246
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,720
Speaker 5:  cool.

1247
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:39,870
Speaker 7:  Cause

1248
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:43,410
Speaker 6:  The iPod is one of the last products

1249
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:47,160
Speaker 6:  that constantly changed its design every year. Like every year it looked

1250
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,310
Speaker 6:  different and it was a very exciting. And now it's like, well, we're under

1251
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:54,120
Speaker 6:  the 35th year of this iPhone. We figured

1252
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,450
Speaker 6:  out laptops. And that's what you're going to get forever. Just go. I would

1253
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:01,260
Speaker 6:  encourage everyone to go back in time and look at like what digital cameras

1254
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,140
Speaker 6:  looked like. They were all over the

1255
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,010
Speaker 7:  Place.

1256
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:08,580
Speaker 6:  And then like, everything is conversion to a candy bar, which is fine. They're

1257
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:12,420
Speaker 6:  very powerful. And they're great. And we love them obviously, but be nice.

1258
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,960
Speaker 6:  It'd be nice if we'd

1259
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,310
Speaker 5:  Click wheel

1260
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,920
Speaker 6:  Diverged, the things that you just say, click we old people

1261
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,680
Speaker 7:  There really was something magical about it, by the way, like the coolest

1262
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:24,460
Speaker 7:  thing about the, the iPad thing this week was like, everybody has

1263
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,490
Speaker 7:  an iPod story and everybody like has feelings

1264
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:31,480
Speaker 7:  about iPods. They had just, they were this like cultural

1265
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,930
Speaker 7:  phenomenon for so many people for so long that I don't feel like there's

1266
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:37,570
Speaker 7:  that many things like that. Like, you're not going to hear people telling

1267
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:40,450
Speaker 7:  you like their stories about their quest to in 10

1268
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,260
Speaker 7:  years. Like it's just the same

1269
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:44,710
Speaker 7:  thing.

1270
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:47,950
Speaker 6:  Yeah. One of the, actually the things I thought about the I've heard a lot

1271
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:51,760
Speaker 6:  this week was so much

1272
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,540
Speaker 6:  iPod usage was communal. Like you think about it, it's like a headphones

1273
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:59,170
Speaker 6:  device. Like you're alone. You're like having your moment, but you were

1274
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:02,500
Speaker 6:  not worried about people seeing your photos, pads

1275
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:06,490
Speaker 6:  weren't locked. Right? Like they had the switch on the top to prevent like,

1276
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:10,390
Speaker 6:  but plays. But like, you can just like, you would just like hand your iPad.

1277
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:14,290
Speaker 6:  Other people are like plug it into their doc or like whatever.

1278
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:18,130
Speaker 6:  And like that was the ad campaign. It's like what? It was just such a shared

1279
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:21,610
Speaker 6:  device. And very few of our devices are designed to be shared in that way

1280
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:25,390
Speaker 6:  anymore because they contain the past present and future of our personalities.

1281
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:29,380
Speaker 6:  And now you're like, no, you don't even look at my phone. How dare

1282
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:29,530
Speaker 6:  you.

1283
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:33,280
Speaker 7:  But also that feeling when you hand somebody, your iPod and they

1284
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,610
Speaker 7:  start scrolling through your artists and judging your music taste was like,

1285
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:40,060
Speaker 7:  that was it. That was a real moment. It was, it was like, maybe not as high

1286
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:43,570
Speaker 7:  stakes as you can now scroll through all my photos. But it felt as someone

1287
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:47,560
Speaker 7:  with like deeply, deeply terrible music taste, it was, it was, it was

1288
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,440
Speaker 7:  a tough moment. It's a lot of people who are like, wow, you have a lot of

1289
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,150
Speaker 7:  Britney Spears on your iPad.

1290
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,180
Speaker 6:  There's a lot of jangly jam bands on your iPad.

1291
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:57,670
Speaker 7:  So many, so many,

1292
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,100
Speaker 6:  Just like the entire jam

1293
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:03,220
Speaker 6:  bands, discography.

1294
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,850
Speaker 5:  That was the best part of it though. I loved having like terrible music

1295
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:10,750
Speaker 5:  on it and like wording it. So that was the first thing you would see on

1296
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,630
Speaker 5:  my iPod. So you'd be like, what? This is what we're going to have to listen.

1297
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:17,470
Speaker 5:  Like anime music from the 1980s. This is what you're going

1298
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:21,160
Speaker 5:  to make us listen to Alex. I'm like, yeah, it's exactly what you're going

1299
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,620
Speaker 5:  to have to listen to. It was incredible.

1300
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,920
Speaker 6:  Were you a, were you a perfectly organized person?

1301
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,820
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent like that was a dopamine hit. Same

1302
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:34,750
Speaker 5:  to like, I'd get in there. I'd I'd mess with the genre. I'd be like, is that

1303
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:38,560
Speaker 5:  really, is it really country Western? Is it

1304
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,340
Speaker 5:  Texas country? I don't know, but it had to have it just right

1305
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:46,060
Speaker 6:  When you got the weird MP3s and they had the deeply weird genre and you're

1306
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,320
Speaker 6:  like, do I have to be really into this

1307
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,980
Speaker 6:  now?

1308
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:51,190
Speaker 7:  Because

1309
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:55,030
Speaker 6:  Look, we're missing a lot with having streaming services categorize all culture.

1310
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:58,990
Speaker 6:  I'm just saying there was a moment with iPods and it was real

1311
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:02,440
Speaker 6:  speaking of music, a Welsh reviewed, I'm never going to get this right. The

1312
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,590
Speaker 6:  Sony w H 1000 X M fives.

1313
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,220
Speaker 5:  You did

1314
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,650
Speaker 6:  It. I did it because I read it. I'm going to buy these

1315
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,700
Speaker 6:  so fast.

1316
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,000
Speaker 7:  Yes,

1317
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,370
Speaker 6:  Yes. Even though I think that they're not going to be my favorite,

1318
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:18,110
Speaker 7:  I'm a little bummed. I kind of expected them to be Sony has

1319
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:22,040
Speaker 7:  just done such a good job of just making it substantially better every

1320
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,440
Speaker 7:  time that this was kind of the one that was like, okay, certain things are

1321
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,100
Speaker 7:  better. It seems like it sounds better. The noise cancellation is better,

1322
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,060
Speaker 7:  but it's more expensive for what I think is like a nicer looking,

1323
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:36,000
Speaker 7:  but less sort of impressive design.

1324
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,800
Speaker 7:  And I

1325
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,790
Speaker 6:  Pulled up.

1326
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:41,450
Speaker 7:  That's the thing. That's the thing that kills me. The fact that it just lays

1327
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:45,110
Speaker 7:  flat in the case and doesn't curl in on itself to fit into it

1328
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:46,760
Speaker 7:  drives me absolutely insane.

1329
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,750
Speaker 6:  I just went to San Francisco and back and I carried my M twos, which

1330
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:54,620
Speaker 6:  are dying In like decrepit. But like

1331
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:58,420
Speaker 6:  they fold up small into the case. And now these,

1332
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,470
Speaker 5:  This is, this is inflation. This

1333
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:01,430
Speaker 6:  Is unfortunate.

1334
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:04,730
Speaker 5:  This isn't there. They're increasing the price and giving

1335
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:07,580
Speaker 5:  us less like space in our bags.

1336
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,610
Speaker 6:  So Wild's points out that they're going to keep sign. The M is, I hope the

1337
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:13,910
Speaker 6:  price will go down. I think I'm going to end up buying <inaudible> because

1338
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:15,710
Speaker 6:  they fold up. This is my,

1339
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:19,100
Speaker 7:  There was an interesting argument on our YouTube channel too, about comfort

1340
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:22,310
Speaker 7:  over versus design. Like that was just sort of the question that we posed

1341
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:25,340
Speaker 7:  as we uploaded the video. And at least when I checked, it was

1342
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:29,180
Speaker 7:  like overwhelmingly comfort. People are just like, just give me a thing that

1343
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,540
Speaker 7:  is easy to wear. And for me, I would add to your point, like easy to carry.

1344
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:36,410
Speaker 7:  And it's like, will I deal with slightly worse sound in order to

1345
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:40,160
Speaker 7:  get that? Yes. Like the only thing for me that I like won't trade is battery

1346
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:44,040
Speaker 7:  life. But beyond that, like give me comfort over just about

1347
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:44,240
Speaker 7:  everything.

1348
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,000
Speaker 6:  No, it's just like, no matter what if you're like, will you pick this or

1349
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,660
Speaker 6:  sound quality? People are like, whatever the other one is,

1350
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,960
Speaker 5:  Convenience,

1351
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,720
Speaker 6:  Comfort. Just like, whatever it is, speed, like sound quality.

1352
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,660
Speaker 6:  Now that's always the lowest thing on the list.

1353
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:03,500
Speaker 5:  Great. Oh, would be like a fortune 500 company right now. If

1354
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,520
Speaker 5:  people actually

1355
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,690
Speaker 7:  Cared seriously,

1356
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:09,170
Speaker 6:  I tweeted by the way, wandering announced podcasts and Atmos, which we are

1357
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:12,680
Speaker 6:  going to have to do. And I think our engineer Andrew is very hard for us

1358
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:16,550
Speaker 6:  to tell you, so where are we sneaking all around you soon? But I was

1359
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:20,540
Speaker 6:  like, I think spatial audio is like for not movies is like, I'm wondering

1360
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:23,750
Speaker 6:  laundering scheme. And now that the spatial audio people work out

1361
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:26,390
Speaker 6:  in force. Oh

1362
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,120
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Are there, are there like Atmos bros out there?

1363
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,900
Speaker 6:  I don't know what, I don't know how to describe it. They're not passionate

1364
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:36,230
Speaker 6:  about it. And they backed down immediately. So they're not like

1365
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,530
Speaker 6:  Elan fans, right? They're like, I think it sounds good. You're like, I don't,

1366
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:43,250
Speaker 6:  you know, like to each his own and it's legal. That was the most pleasant

1367
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,080
Speaker 6:  online interaction that

1368
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,980
Speaker 5:  It's because they like, they wandered over from the AVS

1369
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:51,620
Speaker 5:  forum and they were like, oh, you're talking and you're talking trash about

1370
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,080
Speaker 5:  the system. I spent thousands of dollars on how dare you.

1371
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:59,060
Speaker 6:  I do it for movies. I think it's great for movies. But

1372
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,210
Speaker 6:  I was just thinking when we released this podcast Atmos, which we

1373
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:06,080
Speaker 6:  will inevitably do, I think we will quickly

1374
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,390
Speaker 6:  discover that the value of very low, the reason I bring this up in the context

1375
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:13,050
Speaker 6:  of these headphones, Sony says they're going to issue an update to make their

1376
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,390
Speaker 6:  own spatial audio on Android

1377
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:19,110
Speaker 7:  Classic disclaimer, about trusting software update promises.

1378
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:23,010
Speaker 6:  Well, right? Who knows, but it won't run an iOS. And then on Android,

1379
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:26,370
Speaker 6:  you can have lossless audio or you can have pairing with multiple devices.

1380
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:30,090
Speaker 6:  And those are your two choices because Bluetooth is stuck. And then

1381
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:32,130
Speaker 6:  on apple, you can only get AC

1382
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:34,020
Speaker 5:  I'm just going to start the clock

1383
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:37,060
Speaker 6:  While I'm still the next version of AirPods with these USBC connectors are

1384
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:40,230
Speaker 6:  going to get the win of the USB-C connector. And then I really like it only

1385
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:44,160
Speaker 6:  works on iOS devices By way of completely made a proprietary

1386
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,460
Speaker 6:  Bluetooth protocol telling you it's coming by the way, the six, eight, the

1387
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:50,730
Speaker 6:  pixel six, eight, no headphone Jack. The nightmares here, people

1388
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:50,910
Speaker 7:  Were

1389
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,760
Speaker 6:  In it every day. I definitely sat next to somebody on the plane, back from

1390
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,750
Speaker 6:  San Francisco who looked at the movies on the Delta seat-back and

1391
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,240
Speaker 6:  held up their air pods and then looks at the

1392
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,160
Speaker 6:  AirPods. And

1393
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,280
Speaker 7:  That's devastating.

1394
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,460
Speaker 6:  It's like, there's a number of adapters and dongles that you can.

1395
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:12,330
Speaker 7:  But then on the flip side, did you notice when we got on with

1396
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:16,200
Speaker 7:  Sundar at the beginning of the show, he asked us if it was okay that he

1397
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,770
Speaker 7:  couldn't find a pair of 3.5 millimeter headphones to plug into

1398
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:23,580
Speaker 7:  his computer. And it's like, this is the world we live in. Like the CEO of

1399
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:27,390
Speaker 7:  Google can not track down a pair of headphones that plug into a headphone

1400
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:27,600
Speaker 7:  Jack.

1401
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,390
Speaker 6:  We had somebody on the corner. I don't remember what it was, was another

1402
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:33,720
Speaker 6:  CEO of an accessory company. And they were like, I need a microphone. I was

1403
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,170
Speaker 6:  like, but you would make them

1404
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:40,860
Speaker 6:  Go outside. Well, he did shout

1405
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:44,040
Speaker 6:  mark Zuckerberg, trying to cause a little hype

1406
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,970
Speaker 6:  situation today that did an Instagram real that's where he's got

1407
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:51,750
Speaker 6:  it. He doesn't have a choice. He can't tweet anything. But he tweeted a link

1408
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,440
Speaker 6:  to an Instagram video of him in the

1409
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,800
Speaker 6:  project, Cambria headset, which was the new high end headset

1410
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,730
Speaker 6:  that's coming out, seated the, the entire roadmap. It's a high

1411
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:06,590
Speaker 6:  end and mixed reality headset. So it's like cameras in the outside

1412
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:10,560
Speaker 6:  streams video to you in low latency to your eyes. And then it

1413
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,460
Speaker 6:  does AR stuff over that video because no one can figure out actually AR so

1414
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,000
Speaker 6:  now we're just doing video V like mixed reality

1415
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,300
Speaker 6:  like that. This is all great. It's he says it's going to come to quest soon.

1416
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:25,110
Speaker 6:  Like some sort of preview mode. The funniest thing about this is they

1417
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:29,100
Speaker 6:  blurred out selectively the headset on his face, like frame

1418
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:33,000
Speaker 6:  by frame. So it's just him with like a blurry line over

1419
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,840
Speaker 6:  his eyes.

1420
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,830
Speaker 5:  The funniest thing for me was a lot of hype in this entire video.

1421
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:41,130
Speaker 5:  And they're like, we're finally doing it. We're giving you pass through

1422
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:45,000
Speaker 5:  in color. And I'm like, I want you to

1423
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,840
Speaker 5:  know color, color. Video's been a

1424
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,980
Speaker 5:  thing. This is not new.

1425
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:54,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I I'm assuming maybe in the lab, like

1426
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,920
Speaker 6:  they started liking, but they did announce color, very proudly, full

1427
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,920
Speaker 6:  color pass through. I was just wondering like, what if you just showed us

1428
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,680
Speaker 6:  the device, like leaking a headset at this point, it's going to look like

1429
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,880
Speaker 6:  a VR headset.

1430
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,660
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's also like, not that well, blurred, it's pretty clearly just

1431
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:14,170
Speaker 7:  a VR headset, but it's also, I'm looking at this right now. And

1432
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,890
Speaker 7:  the, the cover image on the Instagram that he shared is

1433
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:21,790
Speaker 7:  him standing up sort of holding one hand out in front of you,

1434
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:24,940
Speaker 7:  smiling with him, with the headset on him blurred. And it's like, my dude,

1435
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,510
Speaker 7:  like this is going to go right there with the sunscreen photo

1436
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:31,270
Speaker 7:  flag. Like this is just a movable moment. Yeah.

1437
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:34,870
Speaker 6:  And the render, if you watch the video at one point, it zooms out of

1438
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:38,650
Speaker 6:  the headset just shows you that it's a very

1439
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:42,280
Speaker 6:  good, all. This was very hypey. Very cool. This is Apple's building a version

1440
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,980
Speaker 6:  like this. That's what Alex tells us Meadows building this. It's gonna come

1441
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:48,670
Speaker 6:  out later this year. But their demo is like, he's

1442
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:52,540
Speaker 6:  like petting and alien. And then it's like, what if you could work in

1443
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:56,440
Speaker 6:  your office? And he's just sitting in his desk, but the video is being passed

1444
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,720
Speaker 6:  through, but then he's got virtual screens too.

1445
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,410
Speaker 5:  Wait, wait, what, if you could work in your office and just pet an

1446
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:02,860
Speaker 5:  alien?

1447
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:03,100
Speaker 7:  Nope.

1448
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,460
Speaker 6:  Now I'm going to read you the thing it says, imagine me will pull up your

1449
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:09,490
Speaker 6:  perfect workstation, which is with as many screens as you want, anywhere

1450
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:12,730
Speaker 6:  you go. Which is, I mean, I do imagine that from time

1451
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:16,660
Speaker 6:  to time, But this is, this is

1452
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:20,080
Speaker 6:  the next step of, of VR AR because no one can build

1453
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,800
Speaker 6:  the glasses, right? Like even Google is like, we're not going to build the

1454
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,320
Speaker 6:  glasses where we could build this a little display that shows you texts to

1455
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,530
Speaker 6:  people talking to you. So apple and Facebook are chasing this like high end

1456
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:33,280
Speaker 6:  mixed reality. We'll see. It was, I don't know they

1457
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,620
Speaker 6:  did it.

1458
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:39,550
Speaker 5:  'cause I figure both Google and Metta are

1459
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:43,480
Speaker 5:  showing this stuff off because they know WWDC is coming in.

1460
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:47,110
Speaker 5:  Presumably we're going to see a lot more of the apple headset. So

1461
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:50,080
Speaker 5:  my question is, do you think Metta hyped

1462
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:53,140
Speaker 5:  the color because the apple headset will be in black

1463
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,170
Speaker 5:  and white,

1464
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:58,960
Speaker 6:  Maybe that's out. That'd be great. If apple released a fully black and white,

1465
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,770
Speaker 6:  like a perfect AR experience in black and white, like the glasses,

1466
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:05,920
Speaker 6:  the whole thing, but it's just in black and white. Like that's up there with

1467
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,880
Speaker 6:  like the watch has a display that isn't on all the time.

1468
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,940
Speaker 6:  Like it doesn't have a floppy drive. Like that's like a perfect apple news.

1469
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:13,510
Speaker 6:  Yes.

1470
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:17,470
Speaker 5:  Very European aesthetic. Anytime you put it on, you're in a

1471
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:21,460
Speaker 5:  very fancy movie. It's great.

1472
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:25,150
Speaker 6:  That'd be amazing. Samsung leak of

1473
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:28,900
Speaker 6:  the galaxy Z fold four, which actually looks beautiful. It does

1474
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,730
Speaker 6:  really refine this design,

1475
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:33,370
Speaker 5:  The bump, the camera bumps.

1476
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:37,270
Speaker 6:  I love the camera bumps. There are three individual

1477
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:39,820
Speaker 6:  camera bumps. Yeah. Perfect circles,

1478
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:43,750
Speaker 5:  Perfect circles that I just, I can already feel my thumb running over

1479
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,630
Speaker 5:  them and like having feelings. And I don't know if there'll be good or

1480
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:49,210
Speaker 5:  bad feelings,

1481
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:49,690
Speaker 6:  Feelings. He might

1482
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:53,560
Speaker 5:  Get me having feelings as I like the texture. There's just something

1483
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,370
Speaker 5:  about it that like, I was like, Ooh, I don't know. Just they're

1484
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:58,330
Speaker 5:  too thick.

1485
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:01,660
Speaker 6:  It's amazing that they're on the fourth generation of this device. And like,

1486
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,620
Speaker 6:  there are, there are finding the design. It really

1487
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:07,340
Speaker 7:  Will. And it's, it's like to your point, it's getting kind of good.

1488
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:11,150
Speaker 7:  I mean, obviously like a lot to see

1489
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:14,510
Speaker 7:  between here's a video from Samsung and an actual thing that does or does

1490
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:18,020
Speaker 7:  not break when you try to touch it. But I mean, these things

1491
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:21,890
Speaker 7:  are getting better fast. Like it, I still think of foldable phones in

1492
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:25,550
Speaker 7:  my head is kind of a like silly prototype that are a long way away

1493
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:29,000
Speaker 7:  from being really competitive things. And I can still count on one hand,

1494
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,540
Speaker 7:  the number of foldable phones I've seen, like in the wild, but yeah, but

1495
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:35,150
Speaker 7:  there's like, this is the, the Z fold four was one of those things where

1496
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:38,780
Speaker 7:  it's like, okay, there's, there's something here. Like this is the kind of

1497
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,100
Speaker 7:  looking like a phone.

1498
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:44,090
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And then if Google figures out its tablet situation, then you

1499
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:47,600
Speaker 6:  unfold it and becomes a useful tablet as opposed to just a giant

1500
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,630
Speaker 6:  foam. Right. Which is what we're going on now. And then lastly, speaking

1501
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:54,440
Speaker 6:  of foldable displays, it was the display week conference this week,

1502
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,990
Speaker 6:  obviously the talk of the town,

1503
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:59,390
Speaker 5:  Honestly, one of my favorite conferences.

1504
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:02,660
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Display week in SIGGRAPH for my two conference, went to fair conferences.

1505
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:06,530
Speaker 6:  Cause we were stuff comes out LG and Samsung, either feeling like their display

1506
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:09,830
Speaker 6:  teams, like they're geared up for display big.

1507
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:13,790
Speaker 6:  It y'all. So just lots of stuff. LG had an

1508
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:17,720
Speaker 6:  eight inch foldable touchscreen, which fold in both directions, which

1509
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,500
Speaker 6:  is wild. You can fold that all the way back on over

1510
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:25,460
Speaker 6:  itself. Lots of rolling displays and like extended hulls, which

1511
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:29,060
Speaker 6:  is really cool. So you just like pull this way out and it gets longer.

1512
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:32,090
Speaker 7:  And we should just say, if you're wondering, why are these things useful

1513
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:35,390
Speaker 7:  in my life? And do I need them? You're asking the wrong question. That doesn't

1514
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:35,570
Speaker 7:  matter.

1515
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:38,330
Speaker 6:  You're listening to the wrong show.

1516
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:42,080
Speaker 7:  It's if you're saying, why do I want to pull up my phone two inches to see

1517
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,440
Speaker 7:  notifications on it? I don't have an answer for you. I also don't care. It

1518
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,190
Speaker 7:  looks very cool. And it makes me happy.

1519
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:50,360
Speaker 6:  I'm just saying the Samsung put out a video and at one point it just put

1520
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:54,290
Speaker 6:  the words wide slidable unsprayed and showed it and then

1521
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:57,950
Speaker 6:  showed up being like pulled out. And I was like, this is a

1522
01:27:57,950 --> 01:28:01,910
Speaker 6:  rules. Like I've been, I've been walking around being like, where am I

1523
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:05,840
Speaker 6:  wide slidable? Is it like, no one's been answering until

1524
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,170
Speaker 6:  today.

1525
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:09,980
Speaker 5:  Why are they though going after it in the mobile space and not in

1526
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:13,880
Speaker 5:  the TV space where like the only

1527
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,480
Speaker 5:  rollable TV we have is $10,000. And I personally would like

1528
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,200
Speaker 5:  a rollable TV. So I don't have a giant black square

1529
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,300
Speaker 5:  behind me in every zoom call.

1530
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:26,360
Speaker 6:  And it's the Samsung is selling more frame TVs than you can shake

1531
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:30,260
Speaker 6:  a stick. That thing is so popular. They're like, yeah,

1532
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:33,110
Speaker 6:  people, what people want is a subscription to fine art. Not to make your

1533
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:36,920
Speaker 6:  TV go away. Even though it's not their best

1534
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,880
Speaker 6:  TV. I'm just saying wide sides, right up rise up.

1535
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,100
Speaker 6:  Like that's the future is,

1536
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,520
Speaker 7:  Sounds like a catchphrase from like a Disney cartoon, a really

1537
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,590
Speaker 6:  Wide slot,

1538
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,490
Speaker 5:  Starring goofy.

1539
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:53,240
Speaker 6:  It's such a cool, you got to see it. It's like, so let me try

1540
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:57,140
Speaker 6:  to describe their demo to you. So David's right. The

1541
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:00,770
Speaker 6:  vertical slidable, as someone's watching like a surfing video and they

1542
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:04,470
Speaker 6:  pull the up and they sh like notifications and menu

1543
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:08,460
Speaker 6:  stuff there, the wide slidable demo, this is real. I swear

1544
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:12,300
Speaker 6:  to God, this is real. It's like it's kids trick or

1545
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:16,260
Speaker 6:  treating. It's a video of a kid. So they're all dressed in like, like costumes

1546
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,970
Speaker 6:  and they pull it out and they reveal

1547
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:22,770
Speaker 6:  a

1548
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:26,700
Speaker 6:  ghost. That's not how movies work. It's like a scream costume guide out.

1549
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:30,450
Speaker 6:  It goes, but it's like, it's like a guy being

1550
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,490
Speaker 6:  like,

1551
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:32,700
Speaker 14:  Ooh,

1552
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,800
Speaker 6:  It's just such a good demo.

1553
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,160
Speaker 5:  It looks so good that you're like, this isn't real. This

1554
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,840
Speaker 5:  looks fake.

1555
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,740
Speaker 6:  I can't stop watching. It's like they had to film it and

1556
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:47,430
Speaker 6:  make it, and then put the words wide slidable on it. And there was meetings

1557
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:51,210
Speaker 6:  for days about this. And they're like, whose kids are going to be in the

1558
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:53,370
Speaker 6:  ghost video.

1559
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:55,480
Speaker 5:  They paid some kids to be in that video.

1560
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,080
Speaker 6:  I just love the idea that if you didn't have the ability to stretch your

1561
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,650
Speaker 6:  screen out, like if they didn't do all of that engineering, you would never

1562
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:03,180
Speaker 6:  know there was a ghost.

1563
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,430
Speaker 7:  You can let all this stuff that's happening on your phone. That you've just

1564
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:06,600
Speaker 7:  never even seen

1565
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,320
Speaker 6:  In every movie

1566
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:10,050
Speaker 7:  You've ever watched. There's something off to the side that you just did.

1567
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:13,920
Speaker 6:  You could just wide slide your

1568
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,510
Speaker 6:  site. It's very good. I hope these are all real. And we should all have

1569
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:20,910
Speaker 6:  them other stuff we should talk about really quick. The F-150 lightning

1570
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:24,900
Speaker 6:  is shipping. Andy Hawkins got to drive. One. Lots of people got to drive

1571
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,870
Speaker 6:  one by all accounts, this product is going to be hit. That people seem, they

1572
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:31,170
Speaker 6:  just can't make any of them. Like that's the

1573
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:31,980
Speaker 6:  problem.

1574
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:35,760
Speaker 5:  Also the tow capacity on them. Like, I love that he was

1575
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,750
Speaker 5:  talking about how it, it actually shows you how about your battery life

1576
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,260
Speaker 5:  is going to go down when you start towing something. But also your battery

1577
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:47,070
Speaker 5:  life goes way down when you start towing something.

1578
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:49,170
Speaker 5:  No long distance trips, faculty.

1579
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:52,680
Speaker 6:  This is the real Texas coming out. And Alex, I'm very worried

1580
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,590
Speaker 6:  about towing.

1581
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:58,380
Speaker 5:  Let's see. Yeah. I had to tell one time and ended up calling a friend

1582
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,280
Speaker 5:  crying because I was so upset. I was just towing like a U haul

1583
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:06,240
Speaker 5:  trailer. And she's like, you just learn how to do it. You get

1584
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,320
Speaker 5:  used to it.

1585
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,860
Speaker 6:  Very good. You do overtime. I've only towed twice. I think

1586
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,460
Speaker 5:  It's

1587
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:14,720
Speaker 6:  Scary. It wasn't, it wasn't a big deal. And I wasn't, it was, I was talking

1588
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:17,460
Speaker 6:  a very small thing. All right. Here's what we got to. Everyone's got to get

1589
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:20,790
Speaker 6:  a truck, but I got to practice towing together. But no, seriously like it,

1590
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:24,720
Speaker 6:  the product seems great. They just kind of make a lot of them. So that's

1591
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:28,540
Speaker 6:  great. Check out that coverage on the site dish, the project,

1592
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,810
Speaker 6:  Jenna five SIS

1593
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:34,740
Speaker 6:  keeps stumbling into some

1594
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:38,700
Speaker 6:  sort of disaster like reality. I would say that dish

1595
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:42,570
Speaker 6:  network keeps talking about crypto in relation to its wireless

1596
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:46,380
Speaker 6:  network in ways that are not necessarily connected to reality. So

1597
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:50,250
Speaker 6:  they had an investor and analyst event in Vegas. And I'm just going

1598
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:53,910
Speaker 6:  to read this to you. This is on the slide. Imagine if there was a wireless

1599
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:57,450
Speaker 6:  carrier that embraced digital acceleration, the web

1600
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:59,950
Speaker 6:  3.0 trends to reshape the list

1601
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:01,650
Speaker 6:  wireless

1602
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:05,620
Speaker 6:  experience, or, Or imagine

1603
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:09,400
Speaker 6:  if you could turn your unused data into a real digital

1604
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,080
Speaker 6:  currency.

1605
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,880
Speaker 7:  What,

1606
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,060
Speaker 6:  What,

1607
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:16,990
Speaker 7:  What do any of those words

1608
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:20,650
Speaker 6:  Mean? But let me continue. Imagine if you could leverage

1609
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:24,070
Speaker 6:  decentralized financing to get the latest iconic devices. Imagine if there's

1610
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:28,060
Speaker 6:  a wireless carrier that actually paid you back.

1611
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:31,480
Speaker 6:  So I'm just going to tell you, if you have a Bitcoin do not buy an

1612
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,340
Speaker 6:  iPhone with,

1613
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:36,730
Speaker 7:  I don't know, at this point, the price of those two things is getting ever

1614
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:37,660
Speaker 7:  closer together.

1615
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:41,590
Speaker 6:  It's true. It just seems like a, not the right use for it. They've got to

1616
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:44,980
Speaker 6:  launch this thing by June. They've got all these targets to hit. It seems

1617
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:48,850
Speaker 6:  like we're going to be in the market for a lot of actual marketing. I would

1618
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:52,240
Speaker 6:  remind you that right now, this network exists only in Las Vegas. The only

1619
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:55,780
Speaker 6:  film that it can work with is the Motorola edge. Plus it is not

1620
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:59,740
Speaker 6:  on track. I hear the Iran fanboys, their fear. They're furious. When

1621
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,610
Speaker 6:  I talk about this open radio access networks are great. I'm excited for the

1622
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:07,480
Speaker 6:  next generation of technology to enable competition

1623
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:10,840
Speaker 6:  for infrastructure. I'm with

1624
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:14,380
Speaker 6:  you, man. But I think we're in for a lot of

1625
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:18,250
Speaker 6:  weird crypto bro market. Like they're supposed to cover 20% of the

1626
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:21,520
Speaker 6:  population. I'd say it's interesting a few weeks. And what they've got is

1627
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,910
Speaker 6:  a slide about pigs that funds with digital currency.

1628
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:28,630
Speaker 7:  All I see here is dish like desperately begging to be a

1629
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:32,530
Speaker 7:  medium stock. They're like, please, we love and FTEs

1630
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:36,070
Speaker 7:  so much. Give us your money. Just MIMA

1631
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:36,790
Speaker 7:  so hard.

1632
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:40,540
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. By the way, if you tester on the network, you get

1633
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:40,900
Speaker 6:  NFTs.

1634
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:41,970
Speaker 7:  Yeah, of course you do.

1635
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:44,920
Speaker 6:  It's it's all, it's all very confusing.

1636
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,570
Speaker 7:  If you don't get cell service, but you do get

1637
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:50,050
Speaker 7:  an empathy.

1638
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:53,770
Speaker 5:  We've just inflicted violence on Alison Johnson, our

1639
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:57,520
Speaker 5:  phone and in network reporter this week,

1640
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,610
Speaker 5:  every day, just being like, Hey, dish said something else about their new

1641
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:04,120
Speaker 5:  network that's coming. You can just hear her groaning across

1642
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:05,140
Speaker 5:  the country.

1643
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,530
Speaker 6:  Well, they just need to put up a network. It's not that they bet on

1644
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:12,320
Speaker 6:  the wrong. What's not, not that they better not in technology.

1645
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,700
Speaker 6:  They promise they would build this network faster and cheaper

1646
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,600
Speaker 6:  by using overran and having all these other vendors involved

1647
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,560
Speaker 6:  that aren't the traditional vendors. And like in a normal context,

1648
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,460
Speaker 6:  that'd be like the great disruptive thing to do, you know? And it would like

1649
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:30,550
Speaker 6:  fail and whatever, but they're only do they're doing it like the point of

1650
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:34,180
Speaker 6:  a gun because they only took over

1651
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:38,020
Speaker 6:  these assets because T-Mobile was allowed to buy sprint.

1652
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:41,740
Speaker 6:  And like, it's just like, this is not actually how innovation or good businesses

1653
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:45,430
Speaker 6:  work. Like the government was like, what if you married you and then we'll

1654
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:49,210
Speaker 6:  take your house and we'll give it to that guy. And then

1655
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:52,030
Speaker 6:  that guy will build another house. It's like, what are

1656
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:55,960
Speaker 6:  you doing? It's not great, but who has not

1657
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,900
Speaker 6:  wanted to turn their, anytime it's a

1658
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,990
Speaker 6:  rollover data. Cryptocurrency.

1659
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:05,060
Speaker 5:  Do people still have rollover data?

1660
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,240
Speaker 6:  I don't know. I don't know what that means. I keep reading it. And I'm just

1661
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:11,750
Speaker 6:  like, imagine if there was a wireless carrier that embraced digital acceleration

1662
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:15,530
Speaker 6:  comma, the web 3.0 trends to reshape the entire wireless

1663
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:18,440
Speaker 6:  experience. What does that mean? Do you know if the wireless experiences

1664
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:22,430
Speaker 6:  you take your phone out of your pocket and it connects to the internet? What

1665
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:25,790
Speaker 6:  web 3.0 trends are going in the middle of that? Okay. Fine. Or imagine if

1666
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:29,780
Speaker 6:  you turn your unused data into real digital currency, not that fake shit.

1667
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:30,920
Speaker 6:  What does that mean?

1668
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:34,670
Speaker 7:  You know, you've been trying to buy stuff with your data. You can't do that

1669
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:35,990
Speaker 7:  anymore. Hey, you got real.

1670
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:39,590
Speaker 6:  Oh, it just implies that you will have unused data. First of all right.

1671
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:43,460
Speaker 6:  Your unused data. So I don't know if dishes away with this,

1672
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:46,700
Speaker 6:  the hottest trend in wireless it's unlimited data plan.

1673
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:50,330
Speaker 7:  So this is dish saying we made a network it's so bad. Please don't use it.

1674
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:54,170
Speaker 7:  We will give you money.

1675
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:57,860
Speaker 6:  Okay. You and dojo coins. I don't know, man.

1676
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,700
Speaker 5:  I'm a little worried though, because this is coming from like the subsidiary,

1677
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:05,210
Speaker 5:  right? It's going to be boost mobiles network. It's going to run

1678
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,740
Speaker 6:  Super unclear.

1679
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:10,520
Speaker 5:  They keep like dancing around it, but they had boost mobile CEO out

1680
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:14,090
Speaker 5:  there talking about this thing. So it's a little, feels, a little

1681
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:15,110
Speaker 6:  Boost coins.

1682
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:19,010
Speaker 5:  Is it predatory? It feels a little predatory.

1683
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:22,640
Speaker 6:  I don't know. All I know is you're going to, there's the concept

1684
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:26,420
Speaker 6:  of unused data in 2022 for wireless

1685
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:30,380
Speaker 6:  plans is a new look. The theme of the show is

1686
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:34,040
Speaker 6:  everything old is new. Again, you know, true. Google's like wallets back

1687
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,640
Speaker 6:  boost smell was like limited data plans.

1688
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,410
Speaker 5:  Roll over data

1689
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:43,400
Speaker 6:  For minutes or back. Yo, what a time were you alive? I can't

1690
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,220
Speaker 6:  wait to cover this more. If you, by the way, if you're a dish network executive

1691
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:49,640
Speaker 6:  and you want to come on one of our shows or the doors open to you, just get

1692
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,390
Speaker 6:  out your, your Motorola

1693
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:55,180
Speaker 6:  edge

1694
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:55,430
Speaker 6:  pumps.

1695
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:57,890
Speaker 5:  You have to be in Las Vegas.

1696
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:01,850
Speaker 6:  I'll come to Vegas for you. All right, we've gone over. We got to wrap this

1697
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:04,730
Speaker 6:  thing up. Thank you as super shy for joining the Vergecast real ones. Come

1698
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:08,720
Speaker 6:  on. The verge cast. Dakota is the safe space for executives. You

1699
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:12,350
Speaker 6:  want to come into this chaos. You got it. Congratulations to Sundar for coming

1700
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:16,310
Speaker 6:  on the show. That's the one he wanted to be on this ship. So you have

1701
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:19,880
Speaker 6:  decoder the CEO of UI path, which is a software automation company. Mike,

1702
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:23,750
Speaker 6:  one of my favorite nerdy things talk about COI path. Daniel Dines was

1703
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:27,500
Speaker 6:  on Dakota. We talked a lot about whether big companies hire UI path

1704
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,460
Speaker 6:  to automate their software. And so there's a feedback loop

1705
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,580
Speaker 6:  happening where the people who make software and making it for lots, not

1706
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:38,510
Speaker 6:  people, it was just wild. Think about it's a very good Alex's

1707
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:41,630
Speaker 6:  creators mini series. And the virtue has continues. We just had poopy touched

1708
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:45,330
Speaker 6:  our hearts next week. It's what successful game controllers.

1709
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:49,250
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's it's controllers. We talked to Ben. Heck who

1710
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,890
Speaker 5:  like has been doing this for over 20 years.

1711
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:55,020
Speaker 6:  I've done one for over 10 years. He's a fascinating

1712
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:57,750
Speaker 6:  character. Absolutely. And then the site looks great this week. There's all

1713
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,720
Speaker 6:  kinds of stuff. We have coverage of Josh, Holly trying to punish Disney.

1714
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,440
Speaker 6:  And he's got some stuff on the Texas social media bill. We've got the aura

1715
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,160
Speaker 6:  strap to review there's DJ mini three pro,

1716
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:12,000
Speaker 6:  which I'm buying for. No reason. That's on the site. Scurry the version.

1717
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,810
Speaker 6:  That's why it exists. It's a great, it's true site
