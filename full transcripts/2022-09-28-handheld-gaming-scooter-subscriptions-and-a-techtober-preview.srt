00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,640
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Low Latency controller

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,200
Speaker 2:  input. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am currently on a

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,360
Speaker 2:  scooter riding around my neighborhood trying to find a place that will sell

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,520
Speaker 2:  print magazines. It's a long story, but basically if you see a copy of New

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,560
Speaker 2:  York Magazine with a full page vergecast ad in it, send me a picture. I

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,720
Speaker 2:  really wanna see it. Anyway, we have an awesome show for you today. We're

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,640
Speaker 2:  gonna talk to Tom Warren about the steam deck and the Nintendo Switch

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
Speaker 2:  and the Logitech G Cloud gaming handheld, which is the worst

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,920
Speaker 2:  name ever. But there's all kinds of interesting stuff happening with handheld

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,160
Speaker 2:  gaming consoles and we're gonna get into all of it. We're also gonna talk

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,000
Speaker 2:  about scooters and how the way that we ride and try and buy them

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,880
Speaker 2:  is changing because it is changing. And we're gonna talk about all of the

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,200
Speaker 2:  tech events coming up in the next several weeks because there are a ton of

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,640
Speaker 2:  them. Product announcements, trials, other product announcements. It's gonna

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,840
Speaker 2:  be a big one. We're gonna figure out what's interesting and what is it all

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,640
Speaker 2:  that's coming up in just a second. But first I gotta get this scooter home

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,440
Speaker 2:  because I'm down to one bar of battery and things could get bleak pretty

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Speaker 2:  quickly. Here. This is the Vercast scene in a sec.

20
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,880
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So one of the most interesting things happening

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,440
Speaker 2:  in the gaming world right now is that handheld consoles are making

22
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,840
Speaker 2:  a big comeback.

23
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,480
Speaker 2:  The steam deck and the Nintendo Switch have both been big hits and now

24
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,360
Speaker 2:  there's the new Logitech G Cloud gaming handheld, which is a terrible

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,760
Speaker 2:  name, but seems to be a very interesting product. These are all an

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,800
Speaker 2:  interesting confluence of a bunch of things. Faster chips, which mean you

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Speaker 2:  can do more with less hardware, new kinds of games and maybe

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,360
Speaker 2:  most of all, a really big push toward cloud gaming. The idea

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,840
Speaker 2:  that most of the work done to show you video games should happen somewhere

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,280
Speaker 2:  else and then just stream it to you like Netflix. It's a really interesting

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Speaker 2:  moment and there's a lot more to come over the next few years in this space.

32
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,920
Speaker 2:  So Tom Warren is here to talk about all of it.

33
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,160
Speaker 2:  Hi Tom. Thank you for being here. Hello,

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
Speaker 1:  Good to see you and good to meet

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,200
Speaker 2:  You. There's like a bunch of things going on here simultaneously, which is

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,240
Speaker 2:  kind of what I wanted to talk about. But I think the place I wanna start

37
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,960
Speaker 2:  is this weird new Logitech thing, the

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,920
Speaker 2:  G Cloud handheld, which is I think like the all time worst game

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Speaker 2:  console name.

40
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

41
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,880
Speaker 2:  Put this thing in context for me, like why does this thing exist? What, what

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,640
Speaker 2:  is it here for?

43
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's, that's probably my biggest question as well actually.

44
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,160
Speaker 5:  So it's, it's essentially an Android tablet

45
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,080
Speaker 5:  that will basically run any Android mobile game within

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
Speaker 5:  reason, you know, cuz it doesn't have like the best chip inside, but really

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Speaker 5:  that's not how they're marketing it. They're marketing it as a, as a device

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,320
Speaker 5:  that will connect up to cloud gaming streaming services like in

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,240
Speaker 5:  video GForce now and obviously exports cloud gaming and stuff and

50
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,160
Speaker 5:  they've worked with video and Microsoft for this, but when they say they've

51
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,120
Speaker 5:  worked with these two companies, it's pretty light work. Okay, let's put

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,360
Speaker 5:  it that way. But either way it's, it's basically an Android tablet that connects

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,880
Speaker 5:  up to cloud gaming and that's the way that they kind of see the vision of

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,720
Speaker 5:  the future of handheld is that you know, you're not necessarily gonna be

55
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,240
Speaker 5:  doing local compute and local gaming that you might wanna play triple eight

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,400
Speaker 5:  games. You know, the games that you don't typically get on mobile but that

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,920
Speaker 5:  you don't wanna do that on your phone with, you know, one of those clipon

58
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Speaker 5:  cases that's just gonna drain your battery life and all this sort of stuff.

59
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,240
Speaker 5:  So it's, it's kind of a bet but it's an interestingly timed bet I think.

60
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah, let, let's talk about the timing of this cuz I think that sort of overarching

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,640
Speaker 2:  vision you just described makes tons of sense to me, right? I think the,

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,480
Speaker 2:  the idea that like a video game should be an 80 gigabyte thing on a hard

63
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,120
Speaker 2:  drive somewhere in my house, like just can't be the future. Like it just

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,480
Speaker 2:  seems wrong to me that that is where all of this is headed. So in theory

65
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,480
Speaker 2:  the idea of cloud gaming, especially as these things become more sort of

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,960
Speaker 2:  massively multiplayer and like, like Fortnite should be a cloud game, that

67
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,600
Speaker 2:  makes total sense to me. Yeah. But it does seem like to some extent

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
Speaker 2:  this all might be happening before the world is

69
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
Speaker 2:  ready for it. Whether it's like the gaming industry or even like the internet

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,360
Speaker 2:  bandwidths, but everybody seems to be betting on it like right this minute.

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,280
Speaker 2:  So like what do you make of the timing of all this?

72
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,080
Speaker 5:  That's definitely the best way to describe it that it's not quite there

73
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,920
Speaker 5:  yet. And I think with Logitech they've obviously gone all in on the marketing

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,960
Speaker 5:  of this being a cloud handheld and, and really not even really talked about

75
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,520
Speaker 5:  like the local installing Android games like you would on a bunch of this.

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's like on the side they're like, oh also it has YouTube. Yeah

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,960
Speaker 5:  It's like,

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,800
Speaker 5:  so the marketing's a little bit, a little bit wonky there. I think it all

79
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,480
Speaker 5:  comes back to how we perceive cloud at the moment. So I think

80
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,680
Speaker 5:  a lot of the success that we're seeing with cloud gaming is where it's an

81
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,480
Speaker 5:  add-on, it's an optional thing. It's like a bonus, let's put it,

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,960
Speaker 5:  put it that way, but it's not the center of a service. So obviously Google

83
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,760
Speaker 5:  tried with Stadia to put that as the center of your gaming, the stadium

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,520
Speaker 5:  basically of your, all your cloud gaming's visions essentially. But it

85
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,160
Speaker 5:  didn't kind of work because people weren't really ready just to be always

86
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,480
Speaker 5:  connected, always online to play these things. And that kind of comes back

87
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,280
Speaker 5:  to, to Logitech, this thing only has wifi so it doesn't have a sim

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,240
Speaker 5:  card inside. So you know, you hop on a plane or a train or in your car

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,600
Speaker 5:  or whatever instantly you don't have connectivity so it's, you fall back

90
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
Speaker 5:  to whatever's installing device, right? So I think until

91
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,200
Speaker 5:  that's all there, these kind of devices are a little bit too early. I think

92
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,040
Speaker 5:  I get the vision of them but I think also the pricing here is a little bit

93
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,000
Speaker 5:  of an awkwardly priced sort of model cuz it is, it is 2

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Speaker 5:  99 if you pre-order it, but in reality it's 3 49 which sits

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Speaker 5:  perfectly in between and tender switch at 2 99 and then the

96
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Speaker 5:  the steam deck at three nine. So it's like who is this exactly for

97
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 5:  like right now in five years? It makes sense maybe and and probably the

98
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,800
Speaker 5:  pricing will change but yeah like the infrastructure's not quite there and

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,440
Speaker 5:  just I think the general selling of something is just

100
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,480
Speaker 5:  cloud or like primarily cloud. It's just not quite the the best way

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,840
Speaker 5:  to market something right now.

102
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's an interesting thing cuz I think even if it's true that

103
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,440
Speaker 2:  most games people play require them to be online, which yeah

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,040
Speaker 2:  it's probably not like all the way true but it's definitely more true than

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,000
Speaker 2:  it was even a few years ago. The idea that all of a sudden my device

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Speaker 2:  is useless if I don't have an internet connection, it's actually, it's like

107
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Speaker 2:  Chromebooks in a weird way, right? It's like do you need the internet to

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,320
Speaker 2:  do anything useful on your laptop? Like yes of course. Does it still feel

109
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,000
Speaker 2:  weird that your laptop is an absolute useless piece of junk if you don't

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,920
Speaker 2:  have an internet connection also? Yes. And so I feel like we're in this sort

111
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,800
Speaker 2:  of weird middle space where like even if it's true, the

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,880
Speaker 2:  experience as you would get it, it just feels bad.

113
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,320
Speaker 5:  The finger chrome boots is that we probably all laughed at them like 10 years

114
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,800
Speaker 5:  ago is just a browser and all that sort stuff, but like now you live in the

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,880
Speaker 5:  browser like everything, right? Browser technology's got so much better that

116
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
Speaker 5:  that you don't need those outside apps. So it's, it's less of a problem but

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,840
Speaker 5:  like a Chromebook I'm not necessarily using in the back of a car but like

118
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,080
Speaker 5:  a kid who wants to play games, it's probably using that at the back of a

119
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,960
Speaker 5:  car so that like this sort of device just isn't quite there for that. For

120
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,480
Speaker 5:  like where the Nintendo switch and even the, the steam deck has has really

121
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,120
Speaker 5:  sort of risen and in popularity and really proved that these powerful

122
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
Speaker 5:  handheld gaming computers basically are on the way. This thing

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,760
Speaker 5:  is kind of putting away from that, that vision. But like I think it is, you

124
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,360
Speaker 5:  know, in 10 years sure that's the way things are heading. Like cloud gaming

125
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,440
Speaker 5:  at the moment. I think in videos GForce now with the RTX

126
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,800
Speaker 5:  30 80 edition or whatever they call it, that thing is probably the closest

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,080
Speaker 5:  that we get to like actually like I, I play that on my gaming

128
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,680
Speaker 5:  here and like it's the closest thing to actually being s to

129
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,760
Speaker 5:  competitive to that, which is quite a feat for cloud gaming at the moment.

130
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,640
Speaker 5:  But until we, until we get that like really aligned and the infrastructure

131
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,360
Speaker 5:  and everything like that, it's just, it's just a little bit too early to

132
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,680
Speaker 5:  rely on that I think right now.

133
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,560
Speaker 2:  So with cloud gaming in general, one of the reasons I wanna talk to you is

134
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,280
Speaker 2:  like I think you are a much more intense gamer than I am. So like I play

135
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,240
Speaker 2:  cloud games and I play like I play a lot of like FIFA and like

136
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,880
Speaker 2:  fall guys, the kinds of games where like teeny tiny bits of input

137
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,800
Speaker 2:  lag don't bother me. Yeah. And the story I've heard from people over and

138
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,840
Speaker 2:  over and over again is that like actually input lag is not as hard a problem

139
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,480
Speaker 2:  as you think because it's just this tiny piece of data that actually as long

140
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,120
Speaker 2:  as you have pretty good downstream video, which increasingly lots and lots

141
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,480
Speaker 2:  of people do then, then your input is actually not gonna be the hold up over

142
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,440
Speaker 2:  time. I have also heard and seen a lot of people who play much

143
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,160
Speaker 2:  like faster twitch, more intense games say that that is a marketing lie

144
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,240
Speaker 2:  and actually input lag is still a real problem and it's kind of holding

145
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,480
Speaker 2:  this whole experience back. What do you make of it?

146
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,280
Speaker 5:  So I think it all depends on what games you play and how you play them.

147
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,840
Speaker 5:  So if you're used to playing on like a a, you know, PS4 or an Xbox One

148
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,720
Speaker 5:  or a TV that isn't o led and you are used to that latency, then

149
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,440
Speaker 5:  there will actually be very little difference between moving to cloud gaming

150
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,240
Speaker 5:  because that TV has a bunch of latency anyway and those, those consoles do.

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,040
Speaker 5:  So when you, when you add up all that system latency versus all the network

152
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,640
Speaker 5:  and displayed latency on cloud gaming, sometimes it's about the same.

153
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,840
Speaker 5:  So it's all what you perceive. So like imagine you have a one gig

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Speaker 5:  internet connection and that's what you're used to and then someone else

155
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Speaker 5:  has, you know, a hundred meg and that's what they're used to. You obviously

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,640
Speaker 5:  have different expectations of the quality of your internet whereas those

157
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,800
Speaker 5:  people won't have those expectations until they have that one gig. So it's,

158
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,560
Speaker 5:  it's, there's also the same, so if you're a PC gamer and you have low latency

159
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,600
Speaker 5:  super quick games for special shooters, you go play cloud

160
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,280
Speaker 5:  gaming, you're probably gonna hate it cuz you're used to such low latency

161
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,440
Speaker 5:  that like anything just feels laggy. But if you're the other way around you

162
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,760
Speaker 5:  are a console gamer, you don't have no LED tv, which you know is super low

163
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,080
Speaker 5:  latency, it's all what you perceive and then those games like yeah like

164
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,960
Speaker 5:  platformers, all those sort of games that you usually use controller for,

165
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,120
Speaker 5:  you're not really gonna notice latency as much but you, if you're playing

166
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,800
Speaker 5:  a twitchy first person shoot you're playing fortnight, you'll probably notice

167
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,880
Speaker 5:  it more or call you.

168
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,400
Speaker 2:  As always the rule is don't buy nice things because it ruins everything else

169
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Speaker 2:  for you. So that's basically, that's basically the play here.

170
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,080
Speaker 5:  But yeah like if you, if you do have an old consult and you're thinking,

171
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,360
Speaker 5:  you know, should I upgrade to get enough consult? Should it go cloud gaming?

172
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,600
Speaker 5:  Like it is surprisingly good now it's getting there, it's just, it all

173
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Speaker 5:  really does depend on your, your latency at home, your internet connection,

174
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,800
Speaker 5:  how far you are away from these services as well where you live in the world

175
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Speaker 5:  like that makes the biggest difference really. So,

176
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Speaker 2:  And then on the handheld front, your point about the G-Cloud handheld, which

177
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,360
Speaker 2:  is again just the worst name being right in the middle of the switch and

178
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,320
Speaker 2:  the steam deck is really interesting cuz I do think like that seems to be

179
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,960
Speaker 2:  sort of the spectrum. The switch is like the simple thing

180
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,680
Speaker 2:  with some kind of online capability. The steam deck is like the massively

181
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,840
Speaker 2:  powerful PC in your hand and the G-cloud handheld is somewhere in

182
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,520
Speaker 2:  the middle. And if I were a betting man I feel like I would bet on the stream

183
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,360
Speaker 2:  deck getting, sorry, the steam deck, God these

184
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,600
Speaker 5:  Names

185
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,120
Speaker 2:  I would bet on the steam deck getting smaller and cheaper and

186
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,720
Speaker 2:  better quicker than some of these other devices can go in the other

187
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,240
Speaker 2:  direction. What do you

188
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,840
Speaker 5:  Think? Yeah, I think that's fair because the steam deck is pretty, is pretty

189
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,600
Speaker 5:  chunky. The battery life is not very good. That's one thing that Logitech

190
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,440
Speaker 5:  is, is kind of really honing in on is the bachelor they have like 12

191
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker 5:  hours, which is kind of insane for a handheld That'd be amazing. Yeah,

192
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
Speaker 5:  like that, that's, that's great. But obviously it's all, you're just basically

193
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,080
Speaker 5:  streaming video on it. So, which

194
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,120
Speaker 2:  Is part of the appeal, right? Like the whole upside of cloud gaming is, it's

195
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,760
Speaker 2:  just all you need is a screen and a battery and all the hard work is being

196
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,640
Speaker 2:  done somewhere else.

197
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,320
Speaker 5:  But with the steam deck I have a steam deck and I can do all this cloud gaming

198
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,760
Speaker 5:  on there anyway. So like I, I get the benefits of that. It's, it's not as

199
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,880
Speaker 5:  obviously as easy to set up. It's, it's a bit of a process cause it's all

200
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,160
Speaker 5:  Linux based and it's all just, you know, you feel like you're hacking sort

201
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,840
Speaker 5:  of thing. Yeah and it's not, it's not as easy to use but like it is definitely

202
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,680
Speaker 5:  interesting that this, this G Cloud gaming handheld thing is in the middle

203
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,400
Speaker 5:  of those two price points. Cause I think if the pricing was a little bit

204
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,640
Speaker 5:  less, there'd be less of a, I've seen like a kind of reaction to it like

205
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,560
Speaker 5:  whoa the price, you know, cuz it is a surprising price when you put it in,

206
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,360
Speaker 5:  in context of those two devices as well. And like on the, on the street side

207
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,160
Speaker 5:  it's very portable is very usable and easy, you know the usability is

208
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,840
Speaker 5:  easy for anyone to pick up and install stuff. But the steam deck, you know

209
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,640
Speaker 5:  like that's, unless you're playing just pure pc, you know,

210
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,480
Speaker 5:  steam games, then you wanna load on emulators or you wanna get to cloud gaming,

211
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,040
Speaker 5:  that gets a little bit more complicated right now. Yeah,

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The steam deck's a lot of work.

213
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah, they've got some work to do there on improving the user experience.

214
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,960
Speaker 5:  But I dunno what Logitech would do to then go in the other way to sort of

215
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,880
Speaker 5:  like more support local gaming. So they'd have to like beef up the processor

216
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,000
Speaker 5:  a little bit and that obviously adds to the expense. So yeah, it's a little

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,960
Speaker 5:  bit tricky in both directions but it is just definitely interesting where,

218
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
Speaker 5:  where it is in the middle.

219
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,920
Speaker 2:  Totally. And the thing that amazes me the most is that Microsoft and Sony

220
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,320
Speaker 2:  are, for all intents and purposes, nowhere to be found here. I mean it's,

221
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,040
Speaker 2:  yeah you've gotta figure there's a handheld Xbox

222
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,480
Speaker 2:  or like the PS VTA is gonna come back, right? Like these have to be coming.

223
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah like I think we've, with Sony's case, their cloud gaming

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,800
Speaker 5:  platform isn't quite there yet. You know, they, they've still got some work

225
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,280
Speaker 5:  to do to to to make that a little bit better and a bit more usable. But

226
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,400
Speaker 5:  Mo's case, this is basically their exports handheld in a way like, I

227
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,160
Speaker 5:  mean they've kind of co-market with Logitech. It's like

228
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,480
Speaker 2:  Oh

229
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,080
Speaker 5:  Interesting. Yeah, it's interesting they've used a bunch of their marketing

230
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,240
Speaker 5:  channels to sort of back this up, which they do a lot of the time with like

231
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Speaker 5:  close partners and stuff. But there is rumors of exports, handhelds there

232
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,160
Speaker 5:  has been for like as, I dunno like 10 years, you know, like it's just a constant

233
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,040
Speaker 5:  rumor and you have to imagine that if Microsoft was gonna do an export handheld,

234
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,000
Speaker 5:  it would probably be similar to what Logic text vision is there with

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,080
Speaker 5:  you know, a focus on cloud gaming. Cuz it, it just makes sense.

236
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,880
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What is your sense within Microsoft? Cuz I think there's a sort of

237
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,840
Speaker 2:  outside sense that cloud gaming and Game Pass are what Microsoft

238
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,720
Speaker 2:  sees as like the future. Like that is, that is the big bet of all of this.

239
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,280
Speaker 2:  But then obviously we're still in a point where contracts are complicated

240
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,560
Speaker 2:  and the way that video games get made is having to change. And also Microsoft

241
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,400
Speaker 2:  is actually like buying every gaming developer can find. So if, if

242
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,840
Speaker 2:  Microsoft is gonna like lead the charge here and it kind of seems like it

243
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,960
Speaker 2:  is, where are we headed? What, what's the next like year or so gonna look

244
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,360
Speaker 2:  like, do you think?

245
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean in the short term I think it's very much of, of what it

246
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,160
Speaker 5:  has been the last couple of years, which is their big focus on Game Pass,

247
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,400
Speaker 5:  which is kind of what they've been pushing. But I think in the longer term

248
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,720
Speaker 5:  you can see where it's lining up. They want the industry to move to a model

249
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,640
Speaker 5:  where they basically support game developers and studios. They'll come

250
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,000
Speaker 5:  to them and say, look, if you put it on day one on Game Pass, we'll you know,

251
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,320
Speaker 5:  invest this amount of money into your game or help you with this amount of

252
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,480
Speaker 5:  marketing. All that sort of stuff. Which is deals that they've done traditionally

253
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,120
Speaker 5:  in the past to have exclusivity or some sort of marketing rights over the

254
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,080
Speaker 5:  game or even publishing it in all this sort of game industry

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,080
Speaker 5:  mechanics. And I think that's where they're ultimately trying to push the

256
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,320
Speaker 5:  industry towards. And I think Sony's obviously pushing back on that they

257
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,880
Speaker 5:  believe in their generations, they believe in $70 games and

258
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,400
Speaker 5:  you're paying for the game. They obviously have launched their own subscription

259
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,920
Speaker 5:  service, but it's not quite matching the export so they don't have day one

260
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,720
Speaker 5:  releases there so they, you know, they're still generating their revenue

261
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,320
Speaker 5:  individually on those big launch titles. But I think it will push the

262
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,200
Speaker 5:  industry in a interesting new way. And also I think like not a lot of people

263
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,840
Speaker 5:  have really talked about it, but is is it good? Like, is it good not to have

264
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Speaker 5:  ownership of your games? Like in the way that we don't really have ownership

265
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
Speaker 5:  of music and

266
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,920
Speaker 2:  Fair question and

267
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,640
Speaker 5:  Movies and everything else like that ownership going away has never really

268
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,560
Speaker 5:  been fully addressed in the digital space for like MP3s

269
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,480
Speaker 5:  and, and music and, and movies and everything else. So like I can't

270
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,320
Speaker 5:  sell you my copy of an album, can I, like, I can't transfer it to you like

271
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,360
Speaker 5:  easily. Right? So I think there's a lot of things, a lot of questions around

272
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,600
Speaker 5:  that and like we're gaming will head as a result of that but I think in the

273
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Speaker 5:  near term for Microsoft is getting the game pass numbers up, right? And,

274
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,120
Speaker 5:  and Xbox Cloud gaming, it's just like an add-on on top of that. So it's like

275
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,320
Speaker 5:  we everywhere, you know, as long as you got a browser you can play our games

276
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,360
Speaker 5:  and that's, that's kind of their approach right now. And I think ultimately

277
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,080
Speaker 5:  it'll end up with like, there'll be an exports app on the PlayStation. There'll

278
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,800
Speaker 5:  be a PlayStation app on the exports. Oh interesting. That's kind of the way

279
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,520
Speaker 5:  we must be heading surely like this vision is true and they put billions

280
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,320
Speaker 5:  of dollars into it. That's the end goal I think for, for all of them to have

281
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,280
Speaker 5:  their own apps across, over where you get your exclusive content just like

282
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,680
Speaker 5:  you do with Disney plus Netflix, you name it.

283
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,960
Speaker 2:  That's true. If, if Apple will make Apple TV apps for other platforms,

284
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,400
Speaker 2:  anything as possible. Yeah. So we're gonna be okay. Yeah. I will also say

285
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,520
Speaker 2:  you just made, you came dangerously close to like making the case for why

286
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,320
Speaker 2:  the blockchain will fix video games and I almost led you there but we'll

287
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,040
Speaker 2:  just, we'll we'll stay away from that for a

288
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,600
Speaker 5:  While and fts will save us a

289
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah but the last thing and then, and then I'll let you go is the

290
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,560
Speaker 2:  appeal of cloud gaming again is that like anything you have with a screen

291
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,240
Speaker 2:  suddenly becomes a thing and I feel like these controllers that attach to

292
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,080
Speaker 2:  your phone have felt like a good idea to me for

293
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,640
Speaker 2:  so long and they don't really feel like they've caught on and like Backbone

294
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,080
Speaker 2:  has made these things their very nice razor is making them Now is this a

295
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,200
Speaker 2:  real market? Are people gonna start to buy these in droves as cloud gaming

296
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,680
Speaker 2:  picks up?

297
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think they will become more popular but I do feel like,

298
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,040
Speaker 5:  I mean Alex wrote about this on the site like a few months ago before the

299
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,680
Speaker 5:  Logitech g Cloud gaming Christ trying to say that together. It's just,

300
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,320
Speaker 2:  It's

301
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,280
Speaker 5:  Terrible. Yeah, before Logitech announced their hand out and she

302
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,080
Speaker 5:  basically was arguing that, you know, these devices are great, you know,

303
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,440
Speaker 5:  it's great access to to cloud gaming through your phone and stuff, but it

304
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,120
Speaker 5:  takes your battery, the screen size isn't always perfect. Like there's, you

305
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,320
Speaker 5:  get a notification, you're out of the game, someone tries to phone you all

306
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,040
Speaker 5:  these considerations, which I think are very irritating if you actually do

307
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,640
Speaker 5:  play cloud gaming on your phone regularly. So I think the

308
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,200
Speaker 5:  hardware is interesting, it's, it's a good stop gap but we probably are heading

309
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,760
Speaker 5:  towards, you know, these, these dumb devices, even pucks in the living room,

310
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,040
Speaker 5:  you know like an Xbox, Microsoft working on one of those already. They have

311
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,840
Speaker 5:  an xbox's TV app and I think there's a clear vision for the

312
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,080
Speaker 5:  future of where things are going and I think handhelds will definitely be

313
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,640
Speaker 5:  a part of that.

314
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,800
Speaker 2:  So like dedicated hardware but cheap simple hardware might be where

315
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,480
Speaker 2:  a lot of this is headed.

316
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think dedicated hardware that has like the UI of that particular

317
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,040
Speaker 5:  streaming service mixed in with you know, some other third party apps like

318
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,000
Speaker 5:  YouTube and all your sort media content, that sort of stuff is, is

319
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,720
Speaker 5:  kind of interesting. Particularly if they get the harder right, you know,

320
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,000
Speaker 5:  the controls and everything's quite lightweight, you can see why they want

321
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,800
Speaker 5:  to do something like that. So I would not be surprised within the next couple

322
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,000
Speaker 5:  years we see an exports hand.

323
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,200
Speaker 2:  It's just gotta happen. Like it's just got to happen. It seems so

324
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,280
Speaker 2:  obvious to me that that would be a thing Microsoft to do. It's like they

325
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,520
Speaker 2:  already make the surface. It's like it's this, take the surface, go and make

326
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,160
Speaker 2:  it an Xbox. It's like there it is, we did it, we fixed it for you.

327
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah, like it just seems inevitable at this point. But it's just the timing

328
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,560
Speaker 5:  I think would be when, when it makes sense. Cause they, they got a lot of

329
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,240
Speaker 5:  work to do also on the back end for like Xbox Cloud gaming to make it

330
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,960
Speaker 5:  stream at 4K on the TV and stuff it's still 10 ap so

331
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,240
Speaker 5:  they've got a lot of platform work to do as well to to get it to a certain

332
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,600
Speaker 5:  point. But I mean that doesn't necessarily impact your handheld so much those

333
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,920
Speaker 5:  resolutions but they still, they still got some latency work to do for sure.

334
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,840
Speaker 2:  Okay, fair enough. All right, well thank you Tom. We're gonna take a quick

335
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,960
Speaker 2:  break and then we're gonna come back and I'm gonna tell you why I love scooters.

336
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

337
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,870
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. I have to start at this next segment by admitting something.

338
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,030
Speaker 2:  I'm a scooter guy.

339
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,790
Speaker 2:  This is still a slightly embarrassing fact to admit about myself. My

340
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,670
Speaker 2:  wife in particular really likes to remind me of this one day when she

341
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,310
Speaker 2:  saw me on the street and I was wearing sunglasses and AirPods and riding

342
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,910
Speaker 2:  a bird scooter and the fly on my pants was down and I rode

343
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,590
Speaker 2:  right past her and her friends and I think that moment was

344
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,830
Speaker 2:  probably the most she ever regretted marrying me. But the thing is scooters

345
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,630
Speaker 2:  have been a huge help in my life. I was in San Francisco when Bird

346
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,950
Speaker 2:  and Lime first showed up a few years ago and I immediately started riding

347
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,830
Speaker 2:  them almost every day. My apartment was a mile from the train and on

348
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,790
Speaker 2:  the other end it was about a mile and a quarter to the office. And by

349
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,510
Speaker 2:  scootering on either side, instead of walking, I shaved like a half

350
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,430
Speaker 2:  hour off of my commute each way every day for just a couple of dollars.

351
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,710
Speaker 2:  It was amazing. And when I was done riding, I just got off the scooter and

352
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,470
Speaker 2:  walked away. It was the perfect setup.

353
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:47,390
Speaker 2:  But over the years the whole ride share scooter thing

354
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,150
Speaker 2:  got to be less convenient. As they got more popular and more people

355
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,430
Speaker 2:  started riding them. The scooter I left outside my office in the morning,

356
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,190
Speaker 2:  stopped being there at the end of the day. And then even when I found

357
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,870
Speaker 2:  ones, it seemed like half the ones I found were out of battery or

358
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,710
Speaker 2:  broken in some way or just not where the apps said they were. But

359
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,590
Speaker 2:  the biggest problem was scooters just got more expensive. The companies

360
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,990
Speaker 2:  that made them needed to find ways to make more money, especially as they

361
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,430
Speaker 2:  went public or got acquired by bigger companies. I actually went back through

362
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,710
Speaker 2:  some of my recent rides and the numbers really add up.

363
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,590
Speaker 2:  I had a six minute 0.8 mile ride to my friend's place, which was

364
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,270
Speaker 2:  $5 and 59 cents. And the 1.7

365
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,270
Speaker 2:  mile ride from there back to the train was

366
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,790
Speaker 2:  10 28. I'm paying about five bucks a day just to ride

367
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,590
Speaker 2:  from my house to the train a little less than a mile away. And I actually

368
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,510
Speaker 2:  got a $20 fine from Bird the other day for apparently incorrectly

369
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:47,080
Speaker 2:  locking my scooter. This all gets really expensive, really fast.

370
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,000
Speaker 2:  So I started looking around, should I just buy a scooter for my

371
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,120
Speaker 2:  commute? And for all those quick runs to the grocery store and to pick up

372
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,680
Speaker 2:  dinner, I found this company Unagi, which makes a scooter called the Model

373
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,520
Speaker 2:  One that I think is generally considered to be the best scooter on the market.

374
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,280
Speaker 8:  Unagi Scooter, a scooter with Soul.

375
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,240
Speaker 2:  But Unagi doesn't really wanna sell you one, at least not at full price.

376
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,280
Speaker 2:  It would much rather you subscribe to one for about $55 a month.

377
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,000
Speaker 2:  I thought that whole setup was kind of odd. So I called up David Hyman, the

378
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,320
Speaker 2:  CEO of Unagi to convince me that renting a scooter, it's the move

379
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,600
Speaker 8:  We kind of envisioned our subscription service. It's like mailing a

380
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,440
Speaker 8:  giant Netflix DVD mailer. They're so like wait. That's kind of

381
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,360
Speaker 8:  what helps make the model work. It shows up at your door in under

382
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,120
Speaker 8:  72 hours if anything happens to it, we send you a new

383
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,920
Speaker 8:  one. If you threw the box away, we send you an empty box and you send

384
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,800
Speaker 8:  yours back. We don't make you wait to get yours repaired, you

385
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,880
Speaker 8:  get a new one right away. People's transportation, they want it to be effortless.

386
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,520
Speaker 8:  They don't want hassle, they don't want downtime. Car down tab

387
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,200
Speaker 8:  sucks.

388
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,000
Speaker 2:  David told me that this idea is really working. About 20

389
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,640
Speaker 2:  people subscribe to a Unagi scooter for everyone that buys it

390
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,480
Speaker 2:  outright and the Casey makes is pretty convincing. I don't want to

391
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,640
Speaker 2:  care about maintenance. I don't even know that I'm gonna want this scooter

392
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,560
Speaker 2:  forever. So spending a thousand dollars on it seems crazy, but I do know

393
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,480
Speaker 2:  that $55 a month is actually a lot less than I'm spending on scooter

394
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,240
Speaker 2:  rides right now. More broadly, this is a real trend in the industry.

395
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,520
Speaker 2:  Bird will happily sell you one of its scooters for instance, and has tried

396
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,960
Speaker 2:  a similar thing where you can pay extra to make sure there's always a burden

397
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,360
Speaker 2:  nearby. But the thing I couldn't shake was the convenience part.

398
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,440
Speaker 2:  It's so nice to just get off a scooter, lock it up and then

399
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,400
Speaker 2:  never think about it again. Not my problem. And now I'm supposed to lug

400
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,000
Speaker 2:  this thing around and charge it myself and like carry it

401
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,920
Speaker 2:  into the coffee shop with me. David said, yeah, it's a

402
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,720
Speaker 2:  trade off but he thinks it's worth it.

403
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,640
Speaker 8:  I always put it down next to me in a cafe. I bring it into a movie

404
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,520
Speaker 8:  theater and put it in the aisle, throw it in the shopping cart at the

405
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,240
Speaker 8:  supermarket. That's how I handle it. It's not ideal

406
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,920
Speaker 8:  really when I go into a restaurant nobody cares. But one day if

407
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,560
Speaker 8:  everyone were to do this, restaurants would start going, No, we're not gonna

408
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,160
Speaker 8:  have 20 scooters in the restaurant.

409
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,320
Speaker 2:  You know what this means, right? This means valet scooter parking is going

410
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,280
Speaker 2:  to be a thing. What a world we live in, my friends. Anyway, I ended

411
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,920
Speaker 2:  up giving a shot. I went to Una's website and

412
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,640
Speaker 2:  forked over $55 a month plus a $50 setup fee to get a scooter.

413
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,520
Speaker 2:  This was I think 4th of July weekend

414
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Speaker 2:  or thereabouts. I've been riding it around all summer and I have to say,

415
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,680
Speaker 2:  I think Unagi is onto something here. Yes it is in fact a

416
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,400
Speaker 2:  little annoying to have to carry the scooter onto the train. And the person

417
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,240
Speaker 2:  at my hair salon the other day was very confused about why I wanted to bring

418
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,080
Speaker 2:  my scooter inside. But it feels like a worthwhile trade just to have

419
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,960
Speaker 2:  the scooter there whenever I need it. It weighs about 28

420
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,560
Speaker 2:  pounds, which will sound like a lot to some people and not much to others.

421
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,520
Speaker 2:  But to me it's been okay to carry around, at least for small bits

422
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,360
Speaker 2:  of time. I'm more of a scooter guy than ever after the last few months and

423
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,120
Speaker 2:  I'm still a pretty happy Unagi subscriber. $55 a month

424
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,040
Speaker 2:  sounds really steep, but it's been easily worth it for me. The math

425
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,640
Speaker 2:  totally pans out in my case.

426
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,640
Speaker 2:  And now Unagi also has a new scooter called the Model one Voyager,

427
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,080
Speaker 2:  which David told me he hopes will convince even more people to buy into the

428
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,440
Speaker 2:  scooter lifestyle. It's a little heavier but it's faster and works better

429
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,280
Speaker 2:  and has more range. And the idea is it's much more of a commuter vehicle.

430
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,390
Speaker 2:  More broadly though, the idea of vehicle subscriptions is totally

431
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,150
Speaker 2:  fascinating to me and I think we're gonna see a lot more of it

432
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,750
Speaker 2:  going forward, especially as new kinds of vehicles keep being

433
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,910
Speaker 2:  introduced into our lives. Like here's Lee Hang Long, the CEO of a

434
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,510
Speaker 2:  mobility company called Nimbus.

435
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,430
Speaker 9:  The ability to use a vehicle like this and not have to

436
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,310
Speaker 9:  commit to an ownership is like really appealing. Combine that with the convenience

437
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,990
Speaker 9:  of getting the vehicle delivered to you. You don't have to think about like

438
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,190
Speaker 9:  when you buy a car, you have to go to the dmv, you have to get insurance.

439
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,630
Speaker 9:  All that stuff that's taking care of for you as well. That's like really

440
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,750
Speaker 9:  convenient and really nice.

441
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,470
Speaker 2:  Makes a vehicle called the Nimbus one, which is this futuristic

442
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,430
Speaker 2:  looking thing that's kind of a cross between a tricycle and

443
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,270
Speaker 2:  a car. It's this super skinny thing with

444
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,110
Speaker 2:  one seat and three wheels and you sit inside it and drive it with a steering

445
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,950
Speaker 2:  wheel, but it tilts as it goes like a motorcycle.

446
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,430
Speaker 9:  We call it a pod, p o d because we

447
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,830
Speaker 9:  don't think it's a card. We wanna stay away from that paradigm,

448
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,870
Speaker 2:  Whatever you call it. It's not available for sale yet, but when it is, you'll

449
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,710
Speaker 2:  be able to buy one for about 10 grand or subscribe to one for

450
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,550
Speaker 2:  a couple hundred bucks a month. Or if you don't wanna do that, just grab

451
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,710
Speaker 2:  one off the street whenever you need one for a few minutes. Nimbus wants

452
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,830
Speaker 2:  to do all the things, all the ways,

453
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,990
Speaker 9:  Rent by the minute free floating. That's really convenient, but it's gonna

454
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,790
Speaker 9:  cost a little bit more because you're basically paying someone to like

455
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,910
Speaker 9:  move it for you, right? And charge it for you. So that's gonna add a little

456
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,350
Speaker 9:  bit more to the cost. But if you're in a hurry, you don't really care. If

457
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,750
Speaker 9:  you're using something day to day, then you want that vehicle to be yours.

458
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,120
Speaker 2:  There's a big Galaxy Brain take in there somewhere about

459
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,720
Speaker 2:  the end of ownership and the fact that people are increasingly willing to

460
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,520
Speaker 2:  pay for convenience rather than having something that's permanently theirs.

461
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,920
Speaker 2:  I tend to agree with Lee Hank's take though that the answer is actually lots

462
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,880
Speaker 2:  of business models and lots of different systems for lots of different things.

463
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,080
Speaker 2:  And weirdly over the last few months I've now been thinking about that

464
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,160
Speaker 2:  subscription spectrum with almost everything in my life.

465
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,240
Speaker 2:  What do I want to own? What do I want to rent and what do I want to just

466
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:38,160
Speaker 2:  be there Occasionally when I need it, I should probably just buy the

467
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,800
Speaker 2:  office because I watch that constantly. I'll subscribe to YouTube TV

468
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,440
Speaker 2:  in the fall because they need football and then I'll cancel that and then

469
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,320
Speaker 2:  I can just pay $10 for a month of showtime when a new season of Yellow

470
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,160
Speaker 2:  jackets drops and then cancel when I'm done. I don't even really own my

471
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,000
Speaker 2:  phone, but I pay $50 or so a month and I get one and then I

472
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Speaker 2:  can upgrade it every year. So that works. I don't know that I need to own

473
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,880
Speaker 2:  my phone, but I do own my computer because that thing better last me a decade.

474
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,280
Speaker 2:  And I also want to keep it around just in case even after that,

475
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,760
Speaker 2:  in so many places in our lives there's gonna be a spectrum of ways to own,

476
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,040
Speaker 2:  subscribe, rent, borrow, everything else, and then also a lot of

477
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,880
Speaker 2:  companies competing to help you manage all that stuff in a way that makes

478
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,480
Speaker 2:  sense. This all feels new and different and expensive, but I kind of think

479
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,320
Speaker 2:  it's fascinating And I asked David from Unagi

480
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,800
Speaker 2:  how far he thinks this'll go. He's been in subscriptions forever.

481
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,800
Speaker 2:  He was early in the streaming music game. He founded mog, which became Beats

482
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,600
Speaker 2:  Music, which became Apple Music. And he's seen a lot about how

483
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,480
Speaker 2:  people's feelings about music ownership and everything else. Ownership has

484
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,360
Speaker 2:  changed. People don't buy CDs anymore. So is everything going

485
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,800
Speaker 2:  that way?

486
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,960
Speaker 8:  I don't think it works across all hardware. There's a whole bunch of numbers

487
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,960
Speaker 8:  involved, like the cost to acquire a customer, what the churn rate is,

488
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,000
Speaker 8:  cost of servicing, the fact that the scooter is lightweight and

489
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,920
Speaker 8:  that we can ship them small parcel back and forth is kind of a

490
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,520
Speaker 8:  cornerstone to making our model work. I don't think it works for

491
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,160
Speaker 8:  electric bikes, they're too heavy. The cost to ship them back and

492
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,520
Speaker 8:  forth and the fact that they have so many moving parts with

493
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,400
Speaker 8:  Derailers and Gears, I think both for shipping and

494
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,320
Speaker 8:  servicing them, those costs will break the model. You

495
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,160
Speaker 8:  know, I think it's gonna be very industry specific. We're really at

496
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,880
Speaker 8:  much the forefront of this hardware as a service category

497
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,600
Speaker 8:  that's going to I think grow a lot in the next 10 to 20 years.

498
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,000
Speaker 2:  I'm still torn about all of this honestly because part of me thinks it is

499
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,880
Speaker 2:  just too expensive and complicated and that maybe we should just go

500
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,320
Speaker 2:  back to buying things and taking care of them and just a

501
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,240
Speaker 2:  simpler idea of how we think about our stuff. But I also like the

502
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,160
Speaker 2:  idea that when it gets cold here in DC and I don't wanna ride this

503
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,080
Speaker 2:  scooter for six months, it won't cost me a nickel until I want

504
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,680
Speaker 2:  to get back on only paying for things when you actually use them.

505
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,200
Speaker 2:  I like that a lot.

506
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,640
Speaker 2:  Okay, we need to take one more break and then we're gonna come back and go

507
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Speaker 2:  through all of the tech announcements that are coming in the next several

508
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,160
Speaker 2:  weeks because there's a lot coming. We'll be right back.

509
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,660
Speaker 10:  This episode is sponsored by Hulu in their comedy series called

510
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,900
Speaker 10:  Reboot. Reboot is about a dysfunctional Sid Comcast

511
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,960
Speaker 10:  returning for a revival of their early 2000 show. Step right

512
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,840
Speaker 10:  Up. When a writer successfully pitches the show to studio execs, the

513
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,680
Speaker 10:  cast finds themselves reunited not only with each other but all

514
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,480
Speaker 10:  their unresolved issues in baggage. And a new team of writers are forced

515
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,120
Speaker 10:  to find a way to collaborate with their original writing team. Reboot starts

516
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,840
Speaker 10:  Keegan, Michael Key, Judy Greer, Johnny

517
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,680
Speaker 10:  Knoxville, Paul Riser, Rachel Bloom, and Kris Marie. You

518
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,560
Speaker 10:  don't miss the new series reboot. Now streaming

Speaker 11:  Cameron comes a new Disney plus original series

522
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,020
Speaker 11:  Supernatural narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch. You'll meet creatures that

523
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,820
Speaker 11:  appear ordinary but possess superpowers. We are only beginning to

524
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,620
Speaker 11:  understand did you know trees can talk to each other to help fend off invasion?

525
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,260
Speaker 11:  And did you know burrowing owls his like snakes to scare off predators?

526
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,900
Speaker 11:  If you think you know nature, think again. Supernatural

527
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,540
Speaker 11:  now streaming on Disney Plus.

528
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,360
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So today, September 28th is

529
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,320
Speaker 2:  the beginning of just a crazy run of tech events over

530
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,160
Speaker 2:  the next several weeks. And honestly my head is totally spinning

531
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,680
Speaker 2:  about what's coming, whether any of it matters, what I should buy, what I

532
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,040
Speaker 2:  should care about, and what I should be watching out for. So I brought in

533
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,880
Speaker 2:  my co-hosts ne i Patel and Alex Crayons to help me figure it out ne

534
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,640
Speaker 2:  And Alex, thank you for coming to me in this trying time of mine.

535
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,120
Speaker 2:  I appreciate it.

536
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,280
Speaker 12:  I'm here for you buddy.

537
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,720
Speaker 2:  We're here. I didn't tell you either of you what we're doing here because

538
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,080
Speaker 2:  you would not have come if I told you. So. The the shtick of what we're gonna

539
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,040
Speaker 2:  do here is I have a list of 10 product producty launchy

540
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,320
Speaker 2:  things coming in the next four weeks. Oh boy. And we're just gonna blast

541
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,040
Speaker 2:  through them and we will talk about them in as much or as little detail as

542
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,520
Speaker 2:  we want to.

543
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,760
Speaker 12:  So we're gonna read your calendar together.

544
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,680
Speaker 2:  Yes. And I'm gonna tell you which flights I'm taking for each one.

545
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,880
Speaker 2:  Okay. And the good news is we're we start very quickly cause I think we can

546
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,760
Speaker 2:  get past this one pretty fast. The first one coming up is today the

547
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,720
Speaker 2:  day a lot of people will be hearing this episode Wednesday, September 28th

548
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,440
Speaker 2:  is Google's big search on search event. This is the thing they do every

549
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,400
Speaker 2:  year where they talk about search. Do we care? Are we interested? Do

550
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,920
Speaker 2:  either of you have anything you're interested or curious about from this

551
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,240
Speaker 2:  event this year?

552
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,600
Speaker 12:  I always want to know how many search results Google is gonna keep

553
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,040
Speaker 12:  for itself. And I feel like they should just announce that at the top of

554
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,800
Speaker 12:  the search on event.

555
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,040
Speaker 13:  Ooh, interesting.

556
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,040
Speaker 12:  Be like we're sending less traffic to people who use our search engine

557
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,480
Speaker 12:  every day and this year we've turned the knob and now we're keeping 80%

558
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:14,920
Speaker 12:  of the traffic.

559
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,760
Speaker 2:  They probably do have that number don't they? Like that is somewhere that

560
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,520
Speaker 2:  they know they

561
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,760
Speaker 12:  Have to have that number. Cause

562
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,240
Speaker 13:  That's how like they make money, they keep the traffic.

563
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,480
Speaker 12:  And David, you just wrote the piece about using TikTok as your primary search

564
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,960
Speaker 12:  engine and it was like fine. And I think Google knows this.

565
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,120
Speaker 12:  Yes. And a huge problem with the experience of using

566
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,720
Speaker 12:  Google right now is everybody is trying to game the search engine.

567
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,880
Speaker 12:  So you search for how to do something, you end up with a page

568
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,640
Speaker 12:  that has been written for a robot instead of a person. But the classic example

569
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,600
Speaker 12:  is if you search for a recipe, you end up with like a personal essay. Yeah.

570
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,400
Speaker 12:  It's there to game the search engine.

571
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,360
Speaker 2:  Right. And the people who make those pages will tell you that. I actually

572
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,440
Speaker 2:  wrote a story about that a couple of years ago where I was basically like,

573
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,160
Speaker 2:  why are all recipe webpages awful in exactly the same way? And every single

574
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,680
Speaker 2:  one of 'em was like, oh it's just seo. Like if I don't do it, literally no

575
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,920
Speaker 2:  one will find me. So I have to write 2000 words about how my day went before

576
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Speaker 2:  I get to the recipe. Or else Google literally will pretend I don't exist.

577
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,680
Speaker 12:  Yeah. And then you like search the recipe and TikTok and someone's like,

578
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,360
Speaker 12:  Here it is in two minutes. Exactly. Pause if you wanna see the ingredients.

579
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,880
Speaker 12:  But how

580
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,120
Speaker 13:  Do you know if those recipes are good? That's why I like the, I like the

581
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,960
Speaker 13:  little essay I'm, I'm like, I'm why Google does this. Yeah. I wanna

582
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,080
Speaker 13:  know, I wanna know how much love your mom put into that biscuit recipe.

583
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,400
Speaker 12:  What was up with the pioneer woman this week?

584
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,960
Speaker 13:  Tell me more.

585
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,720
Speaker 12:  Yeah, but I think this is like the real challenge for Google because the

586
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,640
Speaker 12:  more of it they keep and the more they synthesize the result, the directly

587
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,600
Speaker 12:  the thing, the more it cuts against oh decades of how people have thought

588
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Speaker 12:  about Google's a search engine and how to participate.

589
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,600
Speaker 2:  And in a real way, like the, the thing I'm curious about is like Google as

590
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,440
Speaker 2:  the homepage of the internet is a thing that I think Google has always

591
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,520
Speaker 2:  tried to play down, but every time like for that TikTok thing, I went and

592
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,280
Speaker 2:  looked at a bunch of studies and it's like the most popular search terms

593
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,080
Speaker 2:  are like the word Facebook and the word Google and the word YouTube. And

594
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,920
Speaker 2:  that's just, that's like how people explore the internet. They like type

595
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
Speaker 2:  the thing they want into Google and then go that way. And that is like a

596
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,640
Speaker 2:  level of power, especially as Google starts to pull that stuff back for itself

597
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,680
Speaker 2:  that it's gonna get even crazier.

598
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,120
Speaker 12:  People typing TikTok into Google and getting YouTube shorts is whew.

599
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,720
Speaker 12:  Yeah.

600
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,040
Speaker 13:  Ooh,

601
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,680
Speaker 12:  I love it. It's gonna be a game that gets played.

602
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,960
Speaker 2:  It's coming. That's

603
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,360
Speaker 13:  Beautiful.

604
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:20,440
Speaker 2:  Okay, next one. The same day also today is Amazon's

605
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,280
Speaker 2:  whatever product announcement it's going to be. I call this one the the traditional

606
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,320
Speaker 2:  like spaghetti throwing day by Amazon where they're just like, here's some

607
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,880
Speaker 2:  things that exist that have Alexa inside

608
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,640
Speaker 13:  Like 48 different microwave that all have Alexa.

609
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,080
Speaker 12:  It's always hard to know they're gonna change the echo. The holidays are

610
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,800
Speaker 12:  coming. So last year it was a sphere. This year I'm hoping for cube.

611
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,640
Speaker 13:  Why not really sharp edges.

612
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,560
Speaker 12:  This one's called a rambus. Like what? Which is do whatever you want to

613
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,160
Speaker 12:  do. Like, I mean that's the thing, they haven't added capabilities to it

614
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,200
Speaker 12:  year and I don't think they will cause it's still hardware and then it's

615
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,640
Speaker 12:  like whatever else they can put Alexa in and maybe some marine cameras.

616
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,280
Speaker 12:  Right.

617
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,240
Speaker 2:  I just assume they're gonna talk a lot about football.

618
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,480
Speaker 13:  I mean a robot, we could get another robot.

619
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,120
Speaker 2:  Does anyone have the astro? Did that work? Like has this thing

620
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,000
Speaker 2:  resurfaced at all since it was initially announced?

621
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,080
Speaker 13:  I think the only people who have Astros are people who had to review them.

622
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,480
Speaker 13:  Yeah,

623
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,720
Speaker 12:  I think some people want them. But the example, look, Amazon has to solve

624
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,320
Speaker 12:  the problem of what is Alexa good for? Beyond sending a timer and maybe

625
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,120
Speaker 12:  some smart home motivations, I'm hopefully we hear a bunch of stuff about

626
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,000
Speaker 12:  matter which expands that universe of smart home stuff. But we'll see.

627
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I do think of all of these. It was very funny because Amazon is the

628
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,200
Speaker 2:  one that literally could go absolutely any direction which kind of

629
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,000
Speaker 2:  makes those events fun because you just, you just never know. Like it it,

630
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,520
Speaker 2:  they could announce anything and it would not surprise me

631
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 13:  Except for every year I'm like, this year they will announce a Kindle at

632
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,440
Speaker 13:  this event and every year they were like, we will not announce a Kindle

633
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,000
Speaker 13:  at this event.

634
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,760
Speaker 2:  Okay, next one is on Friday I believe is

635
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,640
Speaker 2:  Tesla's ai day, I assume more robots.

636
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,480
Speaker 12:  So Elon has promised they're gonna show up for prototype with the robot,

637
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,960
Speaker 2:  Right? Oh he has. Oh okay.

638
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,680
Speaker 12:  The hype machine is like off to the races. Will

639
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,040
Speaker 2:  It be a person dancing pretending to be a robot again?

640
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,280
Speaker 12:  Last year was a guy in a, in like a bunny suit. Not a bunny suit. What's

641
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,680
Speaker 12:  the thing called the unitard?

642
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,400
Speaker 13:  Yeah. He was just in a unitard. Like just in a unitard and a mask

643
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,760
Speaker 13:  doing his little dance.

644
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,600
Speaker 12:  It was very confusing. I mean in, you know, in the classic Huon way

645
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:17,360
Speaker 12:  also hilarious. Like Elon knew it was a guidance. Yeah.

646
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,280
Speaker 12:  What was he fooling? Anyone who knows we're supposed to see it

647
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,240
Speaker 12:  and it's supposed to do like, We'll see I don't think they're actually gonna

648
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,040
Speaker 12:  show a robot that can do anything other than stumble. Like how many

649
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,280
Speaker 12:  Honda robots have we seen in our lives?

650
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,280
Speaker 13:  I do not think we will see a robot that does anything more

651
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,360
Speaker 13:  substantial than maybe wave. Yeah. Cause like walking is really

652
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,960
Speaker 13:  hard for robots and if they do the like the Honda

653
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:46,040
Speaker 13:  Sony robot that looks like it's pooping itself, like Tesla can't

654
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,720
Speaker 13:  afford to do that.

655
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,600
Speaker 12:  Yeah. I mean look the bar here is Boston and Annex is like these robots

656
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,480
Speaker 12:  can dance and maybe murder you, right? It's like this, this robot dog

657
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,080
Speaker 12:  can run up a flight of stairs, open a door and then like do a full

658
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,840
Speaker 12:  choreographed dancer team also. We're not saying we

659
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,680
Speaker 12:  haven't put a gun on it, right? Like that's the bar of robots.

660
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,960
Speaker 2:  This one doesn't have a gun. But here's where it would go.

661
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,040
Speaker 12:  Exactly.

662
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,000
Speaker 13:  The little hand

663
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Speaker 12:  We'll see it. Elon's gotta hit the Boston dynamic special. This is what

664
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,360
Speaker 12:  I'm saying before, Before we can say we're so, so impressed.

665
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The the verges official stance on this is that it is absolute

666
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,240
Speaker 2:  vaporware until proven otherwise. Right? Like I, I remember the stories from

667
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,080
Speaker 2:  last year that were basically like, just to be clear, everybody, this is

668
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,240
Speaker 2:  probably nothing. Yeah. Let's all move on with our lives.

669
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,000
Speaker 12:  Yeah, we'll see. Yeah,

670
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,800
Speaker 13:  It's the hyperloop of robots.

671
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,560
Speaker 12:  Remember when they announced a full hyperloop in the city of Chicago and

672
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,720
Speaker 12:  they're like, this will get you to the airport so fast. Everyone's like

673
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,640
Speaker 12:  the blue line. Just make the blue line good. There's no hyperloop in Chicago.

674
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,160
Speaker 2:  Surprise. Okay, next one. October 6th, like a week from

675
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,360
Speaker 2:  now is Google's Pixel seven pixel watch event. And

676
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,640
Speaker 2:  I feel like that one, we know everything about Google has just resorted to

677
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,760
Speaker 2:  the strategy of just like leaking its own things to death. Yeah

678
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,640
Speaker 12:  It's just announced the, It's like making videos for the pixel you can go

679
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,240
Speaker 12:  watch. Yeah. So V thinks that the videos are hiding the world's biggest

680
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,040
Speaker 12:  bele. Oh

681
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,400
Speaker 2:  Is that why they're all dark. All the backgrounds are always dark.

682
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,160
Speaker 12:  She's like I guarantee there's a world's biggest bezzle on this thing. So

683
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,840
Speaker 12:  that's one thing I'm curious about. I'm

684
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,240
Speaker 13:  So, Oh

685
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,880
Speaker 12:  Wow. They've got a differentiating against Samsung which is running the

686
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
Speaker 12:  same operating system now. Which is curious, right? Like how are they gonna

687
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,280
Speaker 12:  do it without pissing off their partner? Who knows? I just wanna see what

688
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,040
Speaker 12:  the battery life on this thing is like. Cuz wheres does not have a great

689
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,560
Speaker 12:  history here.

690
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,160
Speaker 13:  I'm kind of excited about the tablet. It's been a while since they made

691
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,120
Speaker 13:  a tablet and that one was bad. Maybe this one could be good. I don't like,

692
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,000
Speaker 13:  I think, I think promos and Android both make sense for a tablet.

693
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:40,000
Speaker 13:  So I like, I want it to succeed just because it seems like a

694
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,720
Speaker 13:  a normal place for a tablet to exist but it has to actually not suck.

695
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,400
Speaker 13:  And that's been historically very, very difficult for

696
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,480
Speaker 13:  all the different parts of Google to do.

697
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Part of me wonders like with with the news about the Pixel book from

698
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,120
Speaker 2:  a couple of weeks ago, like if Google hadn't announced all of this stuff

699
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,400
Speaker 2:  already in June, if it would still be planning to ship all of these things

700
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,240
Speaker 2:  in their current form. Like the tablet in particular seems like it would

701
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,600
Speaker 2:  be a very easy one for Google to just sort of Nope out of, except that it

702
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,520
Speaker 2:  already announced it's doing it and they can't bail again. At least not yet.

703
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,920
Speaker 2:  They'll bail again in a year and a half. But I am curious to see how much

704
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,800
Speaker 2:  they talk about the tablet and how much it feels like a thing they care about

705
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,880
Speaker 2:  as opposed to like, Oh and also look it's a tablet. You can have one.

706
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,280
Speaker 13:  I will be surprised if they spend more than five minutes on the tablet.

707
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,440
Speaker 12:  All right. Over under. They spend more time on the tablet or more time on

708
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:25,880
Speaker 12:  rcs.

709
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,000
Speaker 2:  I bet on rcs. I think. I bet on rcs. Yeah. Cause it's also

710
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,600
Speaker 2:  like it's a fun knife that Google gets to twists now and especially after

711
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,400
Speaker 2:  what Tim Cook said a couple weeks ago at Code. This is a moment like

712
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,040
Speaker 2:  Google does not get a lot of like moral high ground moments in the fight

713
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,840
Speaker 2:  against Apple. And this is one that I suspect's gonna just absolutely

714
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,440
Speaker 2:  milk the hell out if that'll be fun. It's

715
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,800
Speaker 12:  A bold prediction that they're gonna spend more time making fun of Apple

716
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,400
Speaker 12:  than announcing their own product. But I'm with you. I think that's true

717
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,680
Speaker 12:  as well.

718
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,200
Speaker 2:  That might just be hopeful rather than an actual

719
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,680
Speaker 12:  Prediction,

720
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,120
Speaker 2:  But I'm definitely hoping for it. Okay, so next up, another thing that I

721
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,040
Speaker 2:  think we actually know quite a bit about is October 11th there's, I

722
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,600
Speaker 2:  believe it's called Meta Connect now. It used to be Oculus Connect, now it's

723
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,520
Speaker 2:  Meta Connect and I think the thing that we know is coming, there will presumably

724
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,920
Speaker 2:  be other stuff, but we know that this is when Project Cambria, their high-end

725
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,400
Speaker 2:  VR headset is coming, right? Yeah. You think we know?

726
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,960
Speaker 12:  Yeah. I mean we've seen the thing. Yeah. This has also been, it was left

727
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,960
Speaker 12:  and making the most sarcastic of quotes with my fingers. It was

728
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,840
Speaker 12:  left in a hotel where someone found it and that someone was

729
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,480
Speaker 12:  Mark Zuckerberg on the Joe Rogan experience. Like

730
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:34,320
Speaker 12:  so it was left, people found it to showed up on Reddit separately.

731
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,080
Speaker 12:  Zuckerberg went on the jewelry experience and Joe and got to play with it.

732
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,520
Speaker 12:  It appears that's what they made it sound like. Okay they did kickboxing

733
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:40,840
Speaker 12:  together.

734
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,840
Speaker 2:  Are we interested? Do we care about this? I can't decide on the spectrum

735
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,000
Speaker 2:  of like those crazy like Microsoft

736
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,480
Speaker 2:  prototype headsets that they were like, these cost a million dollars and

737
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,280
Speaker 2:  six people ever buy them. But they have cool technology all the way down

738
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,880
Speaker 2:  to like a Quest three, which I would be very excited about. Like where on

739
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,760
Speaker 2:  the spectrum I feel like we should be,

740
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,960
Speaker 13:  I mean I think it depends on how good the fidelity, the visual

741
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,440
Speaker 13:  fidelity of the thing is, right? That's the point where people who have

742
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,400
Speaker 13:  adopted vr, which is what more than 4 million people have, have picked

743
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,960
Speaker 13:  up a Quest had said at this point like that's a decent little market of

744
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,320
Speaker 13:  folks. And if they can make something that is visually interesting, that's

745
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,840
Speaker 13:  a step up. Kind of like consoles used to be a step up every time you bought

746
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,080
Speaker 13:  a new console. That's a deal. That's cool.

747
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,960
Speaker 12:  We're going into the holidays. Yeah. And this is a thing that you can

748
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,400
Speaker 12:  buy a tech person in your life that they probably don't already have. Which

749
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,920
Speaker 12:  is I think why the Quest two was so successful. Cause it was reasonably

750
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,880
Speaker 12:  cheap. A hundred percent. And if you have like a gearhead in your life,

751
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,880
Speaker 12:  you like buy them and it's cool. Like the thing works. It's a great, I think

752
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,200
Speaker 12:  the Quest two is a great product. I agree. I think the question is, is the

753
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,520
Speaker 12:  Quest Pro going to be like the same size and more capable,

754
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,680
Speaker 12:  like have more features, more visual fidelity or did they make

755
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,520
Speaker 12:  it smaller and better? Right? Cause you leave at the same size, you could

756
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,800
Speaker 12:  do a lot in that case, but that it's the quest too is still pretty big.

757
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:00,200
Speaker 12:  Yeah. Like it's not comfortable where for a long time, but if you add a

758
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,160
Speaker 12:  bunch of features to it, then you're like, you should wear it for a long

759
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,440
Speaker 12:  time, but then it's still too heavy. So like there's a little trade off

760
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,000
Speaker 12:  inside of the size and it's, it's like horsepower that you gotta make

761
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,440
Speaker 12:  then I don't think Facebook is figured out. Yeah. That's the thing I'm most

762
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:10,840
Speaker 12:  curious about.

763
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,120
Speaker 2:  Well, and as Facebook has, as beta I guess has talked about all these different

764
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,760
Speaker 2:  prototypes they're working on and stuff, they're pushing in every direction

765
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,280
Speaker 2:  of that all at once, right? It's the like how do we do more in the space?

766
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,440
Speaker 2:  How do we make it smaller? How do we make it the same size but lighter? And

767
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,280
Speaker 2:  it's gonna be interesting to see which one they picked to actually be a thing

768
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,600
Speaker 2:  that people put on their hits. It's a real like statement of intent, which

769
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,680
Speaker 2:  direction they want to go with this. What

770
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,520
Speaker 12:  I think they should do is come out with a ceiling map that holds your head

771
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,240
Speaker 12:  up while you're wearing the heavy headset and you're just kind of like tethered

772
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,080
Speaker 12:  to the ceiling, just kind of floating along.

773
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,320
Speaker 13:  Wasn't that the original, the, the original headset, Like the

774
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,480
Speaker 13:  very first VR headset was tethered to the ceiling, but

775
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,360
Speaker 12:  With like a cable, I don't think it was like being held.

776
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:51,400
Speaker 2:  So like it basically, it's like a chandelier and you just sort of get

777
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,240
Speaker 2:  into it. Yeah,

778
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,440
Speaker 12:  Exactly. And then you've got, and you're doing like a, like a wire F kind

779
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,960
Speaker 12:  of thing just like floating around in space.

780
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:01,200
Speaker 2:  Oh, I love this. It solves all kinds of problems. You can have legs then

781
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,400
Speaker 2:  who needs legs? You're floating.

782
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,680
Speaker 12:  You're just kicking, you're just doing kicks.

783
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,200
Speaker 2:  That's good. Okay, well you heard it here first. That's what's coming.

784
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,160
Speaker 2:  Okay. And then the following day, Microsoft is having a surface event.

785
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,160
Speaker 2:  And I believe if my math is not mistaken, this is the 10 year anniversary

786
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,080
Speaker 2:  of Surface, which I think presumably means this is going to be something.

787
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,200
Speaker 2:  I feel like Microsoft is a company that likes anniversaries, so I would not

788
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,840
Speaker 2:  be surprised if there's like some real meaningful new hardware here.

789
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

790
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,960
Speaker 13:  They've kind of given up on the dual screen, they've flirted with dual screen

791
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,440
Speaker 13:  and then they stepped back from

792
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,160
Speaker 2:  It. Dan Seafer loves his duo but

793
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,280
Speaker 13:  Not as his main phone.

794
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's just the most expensive e-book reader of all time. It's perfect.

795
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,360
Speaker 13:  He could never make fun of any of the e-readers I've bought this year given

796
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,080
Speaker 13:  that he owns that one e-reader. But yeah, no I think like

797
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,680
Speaker 13:  we're, we're do a refresh on the duo, but I think the surface is, you know,

798
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,640
Speaker 13:  Microsoft give him credit. They did create this entire new form factor,

799
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,360
Speaker 13:  like this whole new category of computing devices. Are they gonna do

800
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,280
Speaker 13:  something weird there or is it just gonna be like even sleeker, even thin

801
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,800
Speaker 13:  and nicer but also a full Windows machine?

802
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,960
Speaker 12:  Well and and the thing they're pushing up against is that there was the

803
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,920
Speaker 12:  big PC market acceleration in the pandemic two years ago. Yeah. That

804
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,840
Speaker 12:  is now just slowed down. Right. So a lot of people who are gonna buy laptops

805
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,680
Speaker 12:  and PCs over a long timeline all bought them at the same time

806
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,600
Speaker 12:  and now it's like they all have them. So convincing someone to upgrade from

807
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,640
Speaker 12:  the great laptop they bought last year is actually pretty challenging. So

808
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,920
Speaker 12:  we'll see. Yeah. But I bet they do something cool for the, I mean, you know,

809
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Speaker 12:  know Panas is gonna have a time

810
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,000
Speaker 13:  The surface go maybe that was their, their really small one. That's cool.

811
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,680
Speaker 13:  And I feel like there's a lot of room for improvement on that device.

812
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,600
Speaker 2:  That's the one I feel like the Surface Pro is like great and we'll just keep

813
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,440
Speaker 2:  getting sort of it upgrades forever. Same with the Surface laptop Surface

814
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,040
Speaker 2:  book you could do some cool stuff with. But I agree. I feel like the go is

815
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,920
Speaker 2:  the one that is like just not nearly as good as it ought to be and

816
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,960
Speaker 2:  could be much more interesting. Well

817
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,440
Speaker 12:  The thing I want is a kick ass surface studio. The big desktop that folds

818
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,480
Speaker 12:  down. Yes. They keep Ning the processor in that thing.

819
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,480
Speaker 13:  One with a processor that actually came out this year. Yeah,

820
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,840
Speaker 12:  That's basically what I'm looking for. Yeah, it's,

821
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,480
Speaker 2:  It's a lot to ask for. Okay, next up we have four more to get through, but

822
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,840
Speaker 2:  I think a couple of these we'll do very quickly. I wrote down there's the

823
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,720
Speaker 2:  Samsung Developer Conference the same day as the surface thing. Does

824
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,520
Speaker 2:  anything ever come out of the Samsung Developer Conference? I have honestly

825
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,200
Speaker 2:  no memory of this

826
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,160
Speaker 13:  Big speed.

827
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,880
Speaker 12:  This is the year boys,

828
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,880
Speaker 13:  This is the year. Come on.

829
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,560
Speaker 12:  No, I, I declined to engage. There

830
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,240
Speaker 2:  We go. Okay. And then October 17th, this one only

831
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,160
Speaker 2:  half counts but we're gonna cover it a lot so we're gonna talk about it anyway,

832
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,920
Speaker 2:  is when the Elon Musk Twitter trial, if it's gonna happen, starts. And I

833
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,400
Speaker 2:  feel like every day we get closer to it, it seems more likely that it's actually

834
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,640
Speaker 2:  gonna happen. We're all moving to Delaware. It's gonna be a whole thing.

835
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:42,640
Speaker 2:  Did

836
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,000
Speaker 12:  We redesign our entire site to better cover the Elon Musk Twitter trial?

837
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,320
Speaker 12:  Maybe not

838
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,200
Speaker 2:  Entirely untrue. Who can say, do we have any inkling

839
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,360
Speaker 2:  that this trial isn't gonna happen? I feel like this is, it has slowed down

840
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,360
Speaker 2:  the last few weeks. It has like it's sort of the column before the storm.

841
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,000
Speaker 2:  It feels like

842
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:02,080
Speaker 13:  It's absolutely happening. Like they want him to buy it, he

843
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,520
Speaker 13:  doesn't wanna buy it. Nothing's changed there.

844
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,040
Speaker 2:  The economy has not gotten better.

845
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,880
Speaker 13:  Nothing's going to change there.

846
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,480
Speaker 12:  And the people who on Twitter seem less and less interested in running Twitter

847
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:11,920
Speaker 12:  by the

848
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,640
Speaker 2:  Day that's

849
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,480
Speaker 12:  Real. It's definitely going to trial. Will they settle after the first

850
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,840
Speaker 12:  day, right? Like he's being deposed this week or next I think. Right. His

851
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,320
Speaker 12:  deposition happens. I mean I think he's gonna wanna fight it but at some

852
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,120
Speaker 12:  point money solves this case. Yes. And so

853
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,120
Speaker 12:  it's just a question of how much money Elon pays for What

854
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,840
Speaker 2:  My only ask is that if this does settle, it would be a real bummer from like

855
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,280
Speaker 2:  an interesting story perspective if it settles ahead of the trial. But if

856
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,120
Speaker 2:  it does, my only request is that he pay with one of those like

857
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,280
Speaker 2:  big giant novelty checks. Just because that feels,

858
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,240
Speaker 12:  That feels like Elon. Yeah. Delivered by a guy in the robot suit. Yeah.

859
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,840
Speaker 2:  Right. Delivered by a guy in a robot suit. In a

860
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,160
Speaker 2:  self-driving car that doesn't really self-drive but just sort of like

861
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,680
Speaker 2:  flings past the Twitter office in San Francisco. This all sounds good. Okay.

862
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,560
Speaker 2:  Then there is Adobe Max, which I would not always include

863
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,800
Speaker 2:  on this list cuz it tends to get very sort of arcane in this stuff. But I

864
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,600
Speaker 2:  feel like after the the Fig Mac acquisition, Adobe is probably gonna talk

865
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,200
Speaker 2:  an awful lot about the internet at Adobe Max and all the stuff that they're

866
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,480
Speaker 2:  doing to make their stuff more accessible to more people. And I think this

867
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,720
Speaker 2:  might be a really interesting year for creator tools.

868
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,200
Speaker 13:  That event is always kind of cool because they'll be like, here's something

869
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,120
Speaker 13:  that will maybe come to Photoshop four years from now and

870
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,160
Speaker 13:  isn't it incredible we can replace your, your grandmother

871
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:33,680
Speaker 13:  with your grandfather in this photo. All you have to do is click.

872
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,480
Speaker 13:  And I always like, I love all those demos. They, they're just wild. And

873
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,120
Speaker 13:  then occasionally they come and they are nothing like what I saw in the

874
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,760
Speaker 13:  demo and it's much harder to do but it's great. But if they can start

875
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,680
Speaker 13:  bringing those tools, a lot of the, like a lot right now, Photoshop, the

876
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,840
Speaker 13:  online kind of versions of Photoshop, the the ones on iOS and everything

877
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,680
Speaker 13:  else still have nowhere near the same amount of

878
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,880
Speaker 13:  features as what you get with the full, the whole shebang. And they need

879
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,720
Speaker 13:  to close that gap.

880
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:04,040
Speaker 12:  This was a, a thing that Scott Besky who's a chief product officer at

881
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,400
Speaker 12:  Adobe was saying, cuz people aren't reasonably mad about

882
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,440
Speaker 12:  Photoshop pushing you towards Photoshop cloud files now instead of

883
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,320
Speaker 12:  spitting out PSDs and like you can still get the PSDs but it like it wants

884
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,080
Speaker 12:  you to do the cloud thing. And he was like, in order to make Photoshop on

885
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,080
Speaker 12:  iPad and the web more powerful and then compete with things like Figma,

886
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,280
Speaker 12:  you need the files to live in the cloud. And it's just like okay cool.

887
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,840
Speaker 12:  That's a big battleship to turn right? Like this is the Microsoft Excel

888
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,280
Speaker 12:  tool bar. Like every button that you might wanna remove there is 10 million

889
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,280
Speaker 12:  people who are gonna be mad at you

890
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,240
Speaker 2:  And who use your tool literally for a living. Yeah,

891
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,920
Speaker 12:  Yeah. You can't, can't mess with it. We'll see if they talk about Figma,

892
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,880
Speaker 12:  I think my prediction for Adobe Max I agree with you Alex. Adobe Max and

893
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,000
Speaker 12:  CI Graph are like my two favorite shows the year. Just like watching what

894
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,320
Speaker 12:  people can do with creative tools is amazing. They're gonna talk a lot about

895
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,680
Speaker 12:  AI art, right? They have to. It's the, it's the thing right? They're gonna

896
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,360
Speaker 12:  talk about stable diffusion and Dolly and all the rest of it. I think that's

897
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:57,840
Speaker 12:  gonna be really fun.

898
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,920
Speaker 2:  It does seem like at some point it would be weird for Adobe not to do that,

899
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,200
Speaker 2:  right? Like that is the next obvious turn for Adobe here is like, oh you

900
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,240
Speaker 2:  don't wanna learn how to use Photoshop? No problem. Just tape into this prompt

901
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,880
Speaker 2:  in Photoshop and we will do

902
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,680
Speaker 12:  It. Yeah, exactly. Be like family who loves me, push

903
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,600
Speaker 12:  the button, spits it right out at Niagara Falls. Great. Done.

904
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,200
Speaker 12:  And then you're like sell it as an NFT and like you're just a one

905
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,120
Speaker 12:  man night band all on the comfort of your own home.

906
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that sounds about right. Okay and then last one, and I put this one

907
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,920
Speaker 2:  at the end because we don't really know when it's happening or if it's happening

908
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,560
Speaker 2:  or in what way it's gonna happen. But there is a bunch of Apple stuff that

909
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,440
Speaker 2:  we are assuming is yet to launch some more iPads, maybe imax,

910
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,960
Speaker 2:  maybe some other headphones, I don't know. But then there was the report

911
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,200
Speaker 2:  for Mark Erman at Bloomberg saying that instead of an event in October, Apple

912
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,880
Speaker 2:  might just do a trickle of press releases and stuff.

913
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,360
Speaker 2:  Is there anything exciting left this year that we think we're waiting for?

914
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,360
Speaker 13:  I mean it's mainly gonna be processor upgrades, right? Like the

915
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,280
Speaker 13:  iPad Pro will go from an M one to an M two I would assume. Same

916
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,880
Speaker 13:  with the imax. The iPad is do something but

917
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,240
Speaker 13:  they haven't redesigned it. Like they seem very content with how the iPad

918
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,880
Speaker 13:  is. So when when he wrote that piece I was like yeah that makes sense.

919
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:15,000
Speaker 12:  Well so, but there's no Mac Pro with an M series chipping it yet. There's

920
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,120
Speaker 12:  Mac Studio, which is people love but there's no MAC Pro and

921
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,560
Speaker 2:  They've hinted towards the Mac Pro, which makes us think at some point that

922
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:20,840
Speaker 2:  is coming,

923
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,680
Speaker 13:  Aren't we owed the Mac Pro? Didn't they say they were finishing the switch?

924
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,400
Speaker 13:  Yeah,

925
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,160
Speaker 2:  He said like the only one left is the Mac Pro and then it was like, but that's

926
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,760
Speaker 2:  for another day or something like that. Yep. So like it's coming.

927
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,520
Speaker 12:  The fact that you can just like buy a 18 core zon tower from Apple right

928
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,880
Speaker 12:  now is like very funny. Yeah. Like you can definitely just buy I'm specing

929
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,760
Speaker 12:  one out right now. Yeah, I mean look, the MacBook Pros, my M one Pro, MacBook

930
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,160
Speaker 12:  Pro is like the best computer I've ever made there. There's almost nothing

931
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,680
Speaker 12:  you could add to that machine that would make me upgrade more battery life.

932
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,640
Speaker 12:  But like it's great. So I, I think like M two pros as

933
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,000
Speaker 12:  an upgrade or M two Maxes is an upgrade for those machines. I think that

934
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,560
Speaker 12:  does seem press releasee, right? Like that's a benchmark story. Okay.

935
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:03,240
Speaker 12:  Then I think the iac, you could build a bigger

936
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,320
Speaker 12:  screen iMac, that might be an event, but you could also just send those

937
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,040
Speaker 12:  out to a bunch of people.

938
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you just say look, the iMac we have it's, it's bigger now. Although

939
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,000
Speaker 2:  I do know a number of people who are anxiously awaiting the return of the

940
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,960
Speaker 2:  27 inch iMac, which I don't know if it's ever gonna happen or if it's gonna

941
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,280
Speaker 2:  happen in October, but that would be big news in, in certain circles

942
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,200
Speaker 12:  Again, is the person who's currently recording this on a 20

943
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,160
Speaker 12:  15 27 inch my Mac, Woo, it's great. It

944
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,960
Speaker 12:  has 32 gigs of ram and if you're, I'm just telling you everyone this,

945
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,240
Speaker 12:  if you just shove as much RAM into the computer as you can get at the outset,

946
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:35,720
Speaker 12:  it will last forever.

947
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,800
Speaker 2:  That's basically true.

948
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,760
Speaker 12:  You can't kill this machine cuz it has 32 gigs of ram. But yeah,

949
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:45,120
Speaker 12:  I think all this stuff, even an M two iPad Pro where in the heart

950
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,120
Speaker 12:  of that product's design cycle, right, they're not gonna change the way

951
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,040
Speaker 12:  it looks. Yeah. So I think fundamentally you get the new stuff when the

952
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,760
Speaker 12:  way it looks changes.

953
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,320
Speaker 2:  All right. Out of all of this, is there any one thing you're like most

954
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,240
Speaker 2:  anticipating curious about looking forward to, excited about? Alex,

955
00:54:59,240 --> 00:54:59,920
Speaker 2:  do you have anything?

956
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,560
Speaker 13:  The iPad Pro, because I need to update mine and I didn't want the first

957
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,480
Speaker 13:  generation, because the first generation always makes me

958
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,320
Speaker 2:  Sad. You just want stage manager so bad,

959
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,480
Speaker 12:  This is why they're not doing an event. They know they can't demo stage

960
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,640
Speaker 12:  manager in person to a group of people. Yeah. They can't have us in the

961
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,840
Speaker 12:  Steve Jobs theater trying to use stage manager. Craig

962
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,200
Speaker 2:  Federer steadfastly refused to say piles on stage ever.

963
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,000
Speaker 2:  So they can't do it.

964
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:26,080
Speaker 12:  He's like, We're not doing this. That's a good one. I would say that's exciting.

965
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,000
Speaker 12:  I'm, I would say I'm excited for the Pixel event. Okay. I, I wanna see how

966
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,200
Speaker 12:  they're gonna, you know, for the 50th time, how they're gonna convince us

967
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,920
Speaker 12:  that they're for real this time. This

968
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,040
Speaker 13:  Is

969
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,000
Speaker 12:  The year. And instead of writing that story for us at the Verge, Dieter

970
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,920
Speaker 12:  is now at Google to preemptively shape that story. So

971
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,040
Speaker 12:  we'll see. But I'm excited. I've been, the watch is a big deal. Like they

972
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,480
Speaker 12:  bought Fitbit, but promise of this product was an entire acquisition. So

973
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,800
Speaker 12:  I'm curious.

974
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's mine too. The, the watch and specifically the fitness stuff

975
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,560
Speaker 2:  they try to put into it because like Fitbit has meant a lot to a lot of

976
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,280
Speaker 2:  people for a really long time and whether Google a can be good stewards of

977
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:04,240
Speaker 2:  that and B like push that along in useful ways is gonna be super

978
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:04,680
Speaker 2:  interesting.

979
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:07,760
Speaker 12:  I mean that's really what I wanna know. That's like why am I excited

980
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:11,280
Speaker 2:  If the bezel on the tablet is any indication, the watch is gonna be like

981
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,120
Speaker 2:  two thirds bezel, one third screen is what seems to be, that seems

982
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,560
Speaker 2:  to be Google's move for a lot of it's first gen stuff. It's really, it's

983
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:18,880
Speaker 2:  good times.

984
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,840
Speaker 12:  I mean honestly like why am I excited for this event so I can hear the from,

985
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,520
Speaker 12:  you know, a hundred miles away screaming. I told you

986
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:26,760
Speaker 2:  So.

987
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:34,480
Speaker 2:  Okay. As you can tell, there is a lot coming in the next few weeks. But that's

988
