2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,630
Speaker 1:  Focus on the flight taxi, captain speaking, and welcome back for those of

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,840
Speaker 1:  you that are still with us. We do have a maintenance completed the problems

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,900
Speaker 1:  with the fixed for the ice detection system. We'll be texting out as soon

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,830
Speaker 1:  as we get topped off people here, they should be on momentarily.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,270
Speaker 1:  Once I get in there, it's about an hour and five

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,880
Speaker 1:  minutes,

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,940
Speaker 2:  Alex, it's it lie. I am on a

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,810
Speaker 2:  plane that stuck on the runway because the ice detection

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,170
Speaker 2:  system is broken. I think it's a software. I think they just have to unplug

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,070
Speaker 2:  it and plug it back in, in any case, I won't be back in time to host the

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,820
Speaker 2:  verge cast. So you have to do it. Good luck. I

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,270
Speaker 2:  believe in you. It's been three weeks since apple said they would issue a

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,030
Speaker 2:  software update to fix the studio display webcam,

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,620
Speaker 2:  Godspeed.

16
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,050
Speaker 1:  Hello, and you are listening to the Vergecast the flagship

17
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,300
Speaker 1:  podcast of the edit button.

18
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,050
Speaker 2:  I'm your host for the day. Alex Cranz Nila

19
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,010
Speaker 2:  is clearly not here as you know, because you're hearing me talk,

20
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,070
Speaker 2:  but don't worry. We've got some great people here. We've got Dan Seaford

21
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,410
Speaker 2:  is here. Talk about phones. Hello?

22
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,400
Speaker 3:  We got Liz. Lopatto here to talk about edit buttons, right? Liz, that's it?

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,990
Speaker 3:  Nothing else happened.

24
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,280
Speaker 5:  I'm certainly not talking about Elon Musk again.

25
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,520
Speaker 3:  No, we are. We're definitely just going to be here to talk about the Twitter

26
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,730
Speaker 3:  at a button. That's the biggest news of the week. Nothing else happened this

27
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,720
Speaker 3:  week. Very, very quiet week. We've also got, Alison Johnson is

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,170
Speaker 3:  going to be on the show later today. We're going to talk about though the

29
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,830
Speaker 3:  one plus 10 pro, she reviewed it. That's going to be really

30
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,370
Speaker 3:  exciting, but first Liz how's Ilan doing

31
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,090
Speaker 5:  Well. I feel like Elan has made

32
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,990
Speaker 5:  some real strides for this shit posting community in

33
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,740
Speaker 5:  that, you know, he's now invited

34
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,640
Speaker 5:  himself to the Twitter board. So for those of you who haven't been

35
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,390
Speaker 5:  paying a ton of attention to Twitter, which I don't blame you, it's a

36
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,200
Speaker 5:  strange place. Elon Musk has been one of its

37
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,160
Speaker 5:  power users for quite some time, so much so that Jack Dorsey,

38
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,120
Speaker 5:  the former Twitter CEO has said that he's like the ideal Twitter

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,780
Speaker 5:  user, which I would just like you to ponder in silence for a second. Okay.

40
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,560
Speaker 3:  Well, all right. So the ideal of Twitter user should like

41
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,280
Speaker 3:  threatened people and promise subs and break federal

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,650
Speaker 3:  laws and break federal laws. And

43
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,340
Speaker 5:  Yeah, Well, listen, I, you know, long time

44
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,240
Speaker 5:  listeners will remember that I was at the Elon Musk defamation

45
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,020
Speaker 5:  trial for tweeting about how one of the guys

46
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,420
Speaker 5:  involved in the cave rescue in Thailand was a

47
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,290
Speaker 5:  pedophile. And in that sense, I suppose, Ilan

48
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,260
Speaker 5:  was ahead of the curve because now it seems like a lot of people are out

49
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,080
Speaker 5:  here calling each other pedophiles. So thanks

50
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,890
Speaker 5:  Elon. No, he, so he filed some paperwork

51
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,040
Speaker 5:  indicating that he bought, I think

52
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,200
Speaker 5:  9%, maybe

53
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,290
Speaker 5:  9.2% of

54
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,250
Speaker 5:  Twitter. He's been complaining about like free speech basically

55
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,060
Speaker 5:  saying that like too much stuff gets removed and

56
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,840
Speaker 5:  your friend and mine, Casey Newton, who is a pro sole

57
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,440
Speaker 5:  proprietor of his own newsletter has written a little bit

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,340
Speaker 5:  about something that stuck with me, which is that people actually seem

59
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,000
Speaker 5:  to like moderated platforms and Tik TOK

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,870
Speaker 5:  success is partially because of that. It's most moderated

61
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,230
Speaker 5:  platform. And it's also like Facebook's biggest competition and Twitter,

62
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,860
Speaker 3:  Like way kind of like Jake clear. A lot of us are on

63
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,950
Speaker 3:  Twitter. Everybody, everybody on this podcast is on Twitter. A lot of our

64
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,910
Speaker 3:  listeners are on Twitter. FA we are the minority. The

65
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,510
Speaker 3:  vast majority of the world is not on

66
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,520
Speaker 3:  Twitter and never has been

67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,700
Speaker 5:  They're on something reasonable. There is some other reasonable platform

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,480
Speaker 5:  that is that for people who have like internet brain worms and

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,130
Speaker 5:  Godspeed to them,

70
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,940
Speaker 3:  I personally, I embrace my brain worms that, that I've gotten from using

71
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,570
Speaker 3:  Twitter all these years. What I don't get is like, did Elan do this?

72
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,530
Speaker 3:  Because he really wants to just bring shit posting into

73
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,370
Speaker 3:  the mainstream. Like, was this like an advocacy purchase on

74
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,340
Speaker 3:  his part? Or was he just like, I got money to burn

75
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,310
Speaker 5:  So long time Ilan followers will remember that he can be

76
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,210
Speaker 5:  somewhat whimsical in his use of money. So you may

77
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,420
Speaker 5:  remember he couldn't buy the onion, which he's a fan of. And so he created

78
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,350
Speaker 5:  his own sort of satirical thing called FID and

79
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,970
Speaker 5:  then pulled the plug on it, like right after it

80
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,800
Speaker 3:  Launched, just hit with a FID

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,610
Speaker 5:  That's right. You know, it's got this whole history with Twitter from, you

82
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,240
Speaker 5:  know, as sec violations from saying he was going to take Tesla,

83
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,230
Speaker 5:  private funding secured, except it wasn't. And, you know, threatening

84
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,130
Speaker 5:  journalists occasionally sometimes stealing means. And so as a

85
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,060
Speaker 5:  practical matter, you sort of start to wonder like, well, what does

86
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,930
Speaker 5:  this mean? And you know, Twitter spokesperson Adrian's and Maura

87
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,740
Speaker 5:  has said, the Twitter is committed to impartiality in development

88
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,580
Speaker 5:  enforcement of its policies and rules and the day-to-day operations and decisions

89
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,480
Speaker 5:  are made by Twitter management and employees. And I

90
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,000
Speaker 5:  will see, I will see,

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,810
Speaker 3:  I feel like I was seeing a lot on Twitter, various Twitter,

92
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,410
Speaker 3:  like higher ups kind of feeding the Elon

93
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,320
Speaker 3:  frenzy, like promising him in an edit button.

94
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,130
Speaker 5:  That's right. So you on of course is, is, is already

95
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,910
Speaker 5:  trolling on Twitter. And he has pulled to ask if

96
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,840
Speaker 5:  Twitter should add an edit button. And then the CEO of Twitter has said that

97
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,700
Speaker 5:  the poll will have important consequences. So it does suggest that

98
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,710
Speaker 5:  that there's like some sort of something going on. And then Twitter came

99
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,930
Speaker 5:  out later. It was like, by the way, we've already been working on the edit

100
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,840
Speaker 5:  button. This has nothing to do with Ilan. This is cloud

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,380
Speaker 5:  chasing all of that. Sure.

102
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,190
Speaker 5:  Say, you know, I it's, I do think it's interesting that the platforms like

103
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,150
Speaker 5:  top shit poster has the keys to the castle. And like he joined

104
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,970
Speaker 5:  the board as part of a standstill agreement saying that he isn't going to

105
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,820
Speaker 5:  buy more than I think 14% of

106
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,280
Speaker 5:  Twitter, which we'll see. I

107
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,240
Speaker 5:  mean, we already know that my guy kind of takes a dim view of some

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,420
Speaker 5:  of these agreements, especially with ones with the sec. So we'll see how

109
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,780
Speaker 5:  that works. But like, I also think that like part of what's fun

110
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,110
Speaker 5:  here, fun. I I'm sorry. Like I don't, I don't know,

111
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,810
Speaker 3:  Big air quotes on that fun.

112
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,650
Speaker 5:  Fun is that he's, he's managed to do this in such a way that he's also

113
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,320
Speaker 5:  managed to basically give a middle finger to the sec,

114
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,770
Speaker 5:  because this is like fun with corporate forums with Liz

115
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,610
Speaker 5:  Lopatto I

116
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,230
Speaker 3:  Love it. I'm here for it.

117
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,100
Speaker 5:  If you are an activist shareholder like per for instance, Elliott

118
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,950
Speaker 5:  capital management who got involved with Twitter last year and was part of

119
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,490
Speaker 5:  the reason why I think Jack Dorsey is no longer CEO and you've bought into

120
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,090
Speaker 5:  Twitter because you want to do some cool shareholder activism. You fill out

121
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,270
Speaker 5:  a form 13 D in which you disclose what your purpose

122
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,840
Speaker 5:  is. But if you're a large institutional investor

123
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,710
Speaker 5:  from like, I don't know, black rock or something

124
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,890
Speaker 5:  like that. And you're just like going to have like a passive

125
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,430
Speaker 5:  stake, you fill out a form 13

126
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,730
Speaker 5:  G and so Musk initially files a

127
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,690
Speaker 5:  13 G and then the same day he filed paperwork

128
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,560
Speaker 5:  to join the board. And like, I can't speak to like Elon Musk's

129
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,500
Speaker 5:  mind because I can't, I

130
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,490
Speaker 5:  don't know, like maybe that was an honest mistake should happens.

131
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,910
Speaker 5:  I do know that he has previously tweeted that the sec is an

132
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,810
Speaker 5:  acronym and the E stands for Elan's. I know that

133
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,350
Speaker 5:  he's gone on 60 minutes to inform us he doesn't respect the

134
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,980
Speaker 5:  sec. And like, he's certainly beefed with them about what he can and cannot

135
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,220
Speaker 5:  say on Twitter, because part of his settlement around the go private thing

136
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,120
Speaker 5:  was that he was gonna run material tweets by a Twitter

137
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,900
Speaker 5:  sitter, like a lawyer, you know, and then he didn't and the

138
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,050
Speaker 5:  sec went to court and then like, the judge was like, this is stupid. You

139
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,950
Speaker 5:  guys figure it out. And so that's, they've sort of been it's, it's been kind

140
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,550
Speaker 5:  of in a lull for whatever, you know, so I wrote about that. And then like,

141
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,910
Speaker 5:  after I wrote about it, he refiled with a form 13

142
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,840
Speaker 5:  D the activist form. And we saw when his

143
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,350
Speaker 5:  buys were, and it seems that the 13

144
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,840
Speaker 5:  G seemed to be late. And the 13 D

145
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,710
Speaker 5:  suggested it was very late. And so, but you

146
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,310
Speaker 5:  know, like again, like I don't, I don't know, lawyer stuff,

147
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,150
Speaker 3:  Like even just this week, we saw another instance of where like space

148
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,930
Speaker 3:  X guy has to go completely redo a permit

149
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,600
Speaker 3:  because they didn't do the paperwork right. Their first time. So it sounds

150
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,080
Speaker 3:  like a lot of his companies struggle with doing

151
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,660
Speaker 3:  paperwork appropriate in proper fashion,

152
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,840
Speaker 5:  You know? And again, like people are going to get mad, but I'm kind of sympathetic

153
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,080
Speaker 5:  to this. Cause I also have trouble with the DMV, but I mean, one of the things

154
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,840
Speaker 5:  that the, the amended filing proved as

155
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,800
Speaker 5:  our local favorite Matt Levine points out is that he definitely should've

156
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,580
Speaker 5:  filed earlier because that, that new filing

157
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,570
Speaker 5:  shows when he was buying each day. So he started buying at the end of January

158
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,260
Speaker 5:  and then had 5% by March 14th, at which point he should

159
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,160
Speaker 5:  have filed a form by like, I think March 24th. And then

160
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,580
Speaker 5:  when I'm buying and then later filed his form.

161
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,270
Speaker 3:  What I keep wondering is like Twitter for the most part has not been a

162
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,990
Speaker 3:  good buy, right? Like, it's that stock has just done

163
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,310
Speaker 3:  fine.

164
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,230
Speaker 6:  It's not a stock. You buy to make money.

165
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,770
Speaker 3:  Yes, no, this is not an investment. That's going to take you to the

166
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,760
Speaker 3:  moon. And yet, well, Ilan is now buying it.

167
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,420
Speaker 3:  And Elan has like a history of being able

168
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,180
Speaker 3:  to tap into the meme stocks. And this, it feels like he's

169
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,920
Speaker 3:  trying like, is this Elan wants an edit button? Or is this Elon

170
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,760
Speaker 3:  once billions through meme, stock manipulation or excuse

171
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,630
Speaker 3:  me, meme, stock savviness. I would never want to imply that someone

172
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,100
Speaker 3:  who's manipulating the market.

173
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,060
Speaker 5:  So here's the thing, as I think we all discovered with Tesla, which to

174
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,660
Speaker 5:  me is the original meme stock. There were a lot of people who trade on their

175
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,650
Speaker 5:  feelings. And I think that's maybe the most interesting part of

176
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,460
Speaker 5:  both cryptocurrency and the stock market is that like it's, it's

177
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,120
Speaker 5:  people are putting money on their feelings and I can watch it in real time.

178
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,990
Speaker 5:  And, you know, I love, I love that. And so there's a

179
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,930
Speaker 5:  possibility that he just bought into Twitter cause he likes Twitter and

180
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,110
Speaker 5:  that he, I don't know, billionaires have hobbies, just like the rest of us

181
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,010
Speaker 5:  and maybe their hobbies are different. Right. But what did happen is

182
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,880
Speaker 5:  that when he bought in and it was

183
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,630
Speaker 5:  announced that he had gotten, he'd gotten in the

184
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,530
Speaker 5:  shares, went up 27%, which I think was the biggest pop Twitter's had

185
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,250
Speaker 5:  since, since IPO, which is interesting because it is again getting absolutely

186
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,460
Speaker 5:  clobbered by Tik TOK and Facebook and so on. So,

187
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,330
Speaker 5:  okay. This, I think puts the sec in an interesting position because like

188
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,900
Speaker 5:  one of the things about Elon Musk brings to a company is a

189
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,830
Speaker 5:  shareholder value, which you can see when he sends the stock up

190
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,490
Speaker 5:  just by buying in. And the sec his job is to protect

191
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,300
Speaker 5:  shareholders. And so if you remove Musk from the

192
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,170
Speaker 5:  board, then potentially that hurts shareholder value and the stocks fall.

193
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,290
Speaker 5:  Right. Right. So if you're the sec, like, what do you do here? And like,

194
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,620
Speaker 5:  I, the answer is, I don't know, but I think we're going to find out,

195
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,460
Speaker 5:  but, but in the meantime, I do wonder if this means we're

196
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,120
Speaker 5:  going to see Twitter moving more towards crypto

197
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,750
Speaker 5:  because obviously one of the other things that Elon Musk can

198
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,050
Speaker 5:  influence by tweeting is the price of something like doge coin.

199
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,980
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And he may remember he went on Saturday night, live and doge coin

200
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,910
Speaker 5:  promptly shit, the bed. So there's, there's just like a, sort of, a lot of

201
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,400
Speaker 5:  externalities here to keep track of.

202
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,030
Speaker 3:  So you're, you're saying that like Ilan could be going onto Twitter maybe

203
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,030
Speaker 3:  cause he likes it. Maybe because it's like billionaires have hobbies and

204
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,840
Speaker 3:  that's buying into large social media companies. Peter

205
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,830
Speaker 3:  keel did the exact same thing repeatedly and is made a lot of money off

206
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,320
Speaker 3:  of it. Like I guess that is a billionaire hobby.

207
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,100
Speaker 5:  Well, Peter teal in fairness got into Facebook early and

208
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,880
Speaker 5:  before it was public and made more money than God on that.

209
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,720
Speaker 5:  And this is Ilan coming in like real late and like

210
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,870
Speaker 5:  to kind of a failing platform that he happens to

211
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,840
Speaker 5:  like, is he going to make more money than God? I

212
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,560
Speaker 5:  don't know,

213
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,340
Speaker 6:  Liz, I want to ask, we talked a lot about the stock. I'm curious as to like

214
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,240
Speaker 6:  how much of Elon being on the board and like, how much does this,

215
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,230
Speaker 6:  can we expect this to influence Twitter's product? Like how much power does

216
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,650
Speaker 6:  he actually have by owning 9.2% and having a board

217
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,310
Speaker 6:  seat does like the CEO have to like,

218
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,730
Speaker 6:  do what Elon says now when it comes to like adding features

219
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,360
Speaker 6:  or, you know, whatever whim he might happen to have at the moment.

220
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,110
Speaker 5:  I think he's a really important shareholder at this point, right? Like you

221
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,710
Speaker 5:  don't have to do everything he says, but you do have to keep him pretty happy.

222
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,190
Speaker 5:  Because again, if Elon Musk exits the stock, then so do all the meme

223
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,970
Speaker 5:  investors. So, you know, that potentially hurts all the rest of your

224
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,460
Speaker 5:  investors. And so now, like this is like a question of like, what do you

225
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,030
Speaker 5:  do? What do you do to keep Ilan happy? Which is, I think why we're seeing

226
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,420
Speaker 5:  Twitter CEO helping him drill. Because obviously

227
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,230
Speaker 5:  like if Elon is having fun on twitter.com, then you

228
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,040
Speaker 5:  want to help him have fun on twitter.com in terms of product

229
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,550
Speaker 5:  decisions. I actually don't know the, the sort of the function of the board

230
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,460
Speaker 5:  is to be like, kind of like council of elders

231
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,090
Speaker 5:  or whatever. And like the CEO's like kind of boss

232
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,690
Speaker 5:  and that's not always true at companies, including Facebook where

233
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,200
Speaker 5:  like mark has special shares. So he's always in charge of

234
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,620
Speaker 5:  Facebook and everybody else can fuck off, but Twitter doesn't

235
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,280
Speaker 5:  have dual class shares like that. It's, it's

236
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,210
Speaker 5:  all the same thing. So there isn't really protection

237
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,020
Speaker 5:  for people who want to remain in control and not listen to

238
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,950
Speaker 5:  Elon on that level in terms of what the board does. Like a lot of

239
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,940
Speaker 5:  it is advisory. A lot of it is high level strategic stuff. And

240
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,810
Speaker 5:  I do think that having somebody in the room who actually

241
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,710
Speaker 5:  actively uses Twitter is probably a good thing because

242
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,100
Speaker 5:  as I think we've all discovered from like Twitter is like

243
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,790
Speaker 5:  decisions. Like a lot of people who work there just have no fucking clue

244
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,570
Speaker 5:  how the power users use it and mostly don't care. And so like,

245
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,230
Speaker 5:  you'll do you know, there was like that, that viral tweet about like users

246
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,040
Speaker 5:  try to get like Twitter to stop harassment and Twitter

247
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,130
Speaker 5:  being like, ah, yes, the star button is now a hard

248
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,930
Speaker 6:  Timeline goes sideways.

249
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,650
Speaker 5:  That's right. So

250
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,610
Speaker 5:  there is a world in which having Elon Musk on the board, I do think is a

251
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,460
Speaker 5:  net positive for Twitter, not least because

252
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,360
Speaker 5:  he is someone who has a lot of followers.

253
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,810
Speaker 5:  And one of the things about Twitter that I think is sort of terrible is like

254
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,740
Speaker 5:  the more followers you accrue and the better at the platform you are,

255
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,800
Speaker 5:  the more unpleasant the experience becomes, the more likely you are to have

256
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,370
Speaker 5:  people just like drive by hate iterating, you know? And

257
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,420
Speaker 5:  like

258
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,660
Speaker 3:  His notification tile must just be

259
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,200
Speaker 3:  awful. Like his notifications have like, as he looked at his notifications

260
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,430
Speaker 3:  and years,

261
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,390
Speaker 5:  Yes.

262
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,960
Speaker 6:  Responds, he replies all the time. It's like, how does he manage this?

263
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,770
Speaker 6:  Like I can't handle it. And I have a fraction of a fraction of that

264
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,340
Speaker 6:  following.

265
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I just, I'm very curious how Elon is managing that many

266
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,550
Speaker 3:  followers as effectively as he does.

267
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,880
Speaker 6:  You would think he has better things to do, but apparently not.

268
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,180
Speaker 5:  I think this is fun for him. I think this is a hobby. And so like, and that

269
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,880
Speaker 5:  sounds like, I don't know that it's necessarily a bad thing that he's on

270
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,630
Speaker 5:  the board. And like the other thing that I'll note is that, you know,

271
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,410
Speaker 5:  as of like last may, consumers had lost

272
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,800
Speaker 5:  more than $2 million in cryptocurrency to scammers that were

273
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,580
Speaker 5:  impersonating Tesla and SpaceX, you know, CEO, Elon

274
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,240
Speaker 5:  Musk, right? The FTC announced that that like in, in that six month period,

275
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,660
Speaker 5:  people lost $2 million. There is an ongoing problem with people pretending

276
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,320
Speaker 5:  to be Elon Musk on Twitter to create scans

277
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,250
Speaker 5:  and take people's crypto. So, I mean, you know, having actual Elon

278
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,910
Speaker 5:  Musk on the board seems like there might be a little more impetus to do something

279
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,690
Speaker 5:  about that. Maybe because I imagine he's not super

280
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,200
Speaker 5:  fond of, of having scammers in his mentions all the time, pretending to be

281
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Speaker 5:  him and like ripping off his fans.

282
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,630
Speaker 3:  Well, we've, we've talked about the product decisions and how he may or may

283
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,230
Speaker 3:  not affect that and stuff that the board is doing. But I think the big kind

284
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,200
Speaker 3:  of question is free speech, right? Like Ilan has a very different

285
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,010
Speaker 3:  approach to speech moderation online, then Twitter then than

286
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,940
Speaker 3:  most of the established social media platforms. How

287
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,900
Speaker 3:  much of that are we going to see? Are we going to see Twitter like slowly

288
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,240
Speaker 3:  transform on the moderation front?

289
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,230
Speaker 5:  We could. It's helpful to think. I think back to PayPal,

290
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,980
Speaker 5:  because one of the things that was true at PayPal is that they didn't do

291
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,880
Speaker 5:  a lot of confirmation of

292
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,540
Speaker 5:  customers and they lost a lot of money trying to acquire customers from scammers

293
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,530
Speaker 5:  because they just weren't doing the kinds of things that one

294
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,450
Speaker 5:  might do to avoid being scared.

295
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,440
Speaker 5:  Essentially there is a possibility that Elon is going

296
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,370
Speaker 5:  to be advocating for the wild, wild west, you know, with all

297
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,880
Speaker 5:  of this stuff. And like, again, like his first official comment on all of

298
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
Speaker 5:  this is oh, high law. Right,

299
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,090
Speaker 3:  Right. Yeah. Like this is just, he's having a good time. I mean, that's one

300
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,780
Speaker 3:  of the things that like, that's like the appeal of

301
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,440
Speaker 3:  Elan is that you never know when he's being serious. You never know if he's

302
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,400
Speaker 3:  doing this for like strategic reasons or not. And I know a lot of his detractors

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,360
Speaker 3:  would say, he's just a big showman. He doesn't actually have

304
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,930
Speaker 3:  any strategy behind it. I think even Peter teal has like

305
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,710
Speaker 3:  alluded to that in the past, but there

306
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,190
Speaker 3:  always seems to be a little strategy to what he's doing. Like he does, he

307
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,490
Speaker 3:  is a billionaire. He has accrued enormous amounts of

308
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,390
Speaker 3:  money.

309
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,600
Speaker 5:  Do you think the chaos is a strategy because it keeps people paying attention

310
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,470
Speaker 5:  to him. Right. I've been to a lot of events where he's

311
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,800
Speaker 5:  spoken and has said something that like people weren't planning for, I'm

312
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,070
Speaker 5:  thinking specifically of the neuro link where he was like, oh yeah, we're

313
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,040
Speaker 5:  in monkeys now. And one of his chief scientists was like, oh, I didn't know

314
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,970
Speaker 5:  that we were announcing that today. Okay.

315
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,970
Speaker 5:  You know, like it's, it keeps things exciting. It makes sure that people

316
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,600
Speaker 5:  are paying attention to him because he's unpredictable. He's not Tim cook.

317
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,120
Speaker 5:  You know, you kind of know what Tim, Cook's going to say before he gets on

318
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,900
Speaker 5:  the stage and it's going to be kind of boring. And like Elon Musk is definitely

319
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,080
Speaker 5:  not boring. So, you know, if

320
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,590
Speaker 5:  he's, if he's going to do like viral polling

321
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,280
Speaker 5:  and sort of like weirdo product

322
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,180
Speaker 5:  suggestions like that, that might suck for the CEO of

323
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,080
Speaker 5:  Twitter. I don't know how it's going to work out for us users. But

324
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,380
Speaker 5:  I do think that this is an interesting thing to just kind of keep an eye

325
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,710
Speaker 5:  on. And I think our, our, again, our friend Casey Newton wrote about this

326
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,490
Speaker 5:  quite well, you know, like it's, it's hard to predict Elon

327
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,000
Speaker 5:  Musk's next action either because that's a

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,840
Speaker 5:  strategic thing that he does or just because he's kind of flying by the

329
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,740
Speaker 5:  seat of his pants who can tell. And so I think right

330
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,220
Speaker 5:  now trying to be like, oh, well this means that Twitter is, is

331
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,700
Speaker 5:  not, is going to be free speech central. Or this means that Twitter is going

332
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,300
Speaker 5:  to make certain product decisions. Like, I don't think we get to know what

333
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,020
Speaker 5:  this means for awhile, because it's just

334
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,690
Speaker 5:  impossible to read this man's mind. Yeah.

335
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,600
Speaker 3:  Like the, the button they were working on it, they didn't announce they were

336
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,440
Speaker 3:  working on it eons ago. It's like, this was pure,

337
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,310
Speaker 3:  just fun. Trolling just happened to be like nicely

338
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,210
Speaker 3:  timed. But I do still want to talk about the edit button because I personally

339
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,080
Speaker 3:  am terrified of an edit button on Twitter. Like I just keep thinking

340
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,860
Speaker 3:  of the platforms where you could edit and like, yeah.

341
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,040
Speaker 3:  Tumbler like Facebook. I think you can even kind of do it in the very, very

342
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,430
Speaker 3:  early days. And like, do we really want people to be able to go back and

343
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,270
Speaker 3:  edit what they say? And one like disrupt the

344
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,990
Speaker 3:  course of history to some respect, right? Like that's

345
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,770
Speaker 3:  really bad for historians and people looking back on this stuff for archival

346
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,730
Speaker 3:  purposes, but it's also like, you can make people say some really weird

347
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,740
Speaker 3:  stuff with an edit button. I assume.

348
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,560
Speaker 6:  I mean, there's a lot of like technical solutions to all those problems.

349
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,340
Speaker 6:  I mean, weather, whatever Twitter decide city, like they, they say that they're

350
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,640
Speaker 6:  rolling this out or we'll be testing it for Twitter blue users, which is

351
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,940
Speaker 6:  their paid subscription service. So yes, it looks like you're going to have

352
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,900
Speaker 6:  to pay to have this edit button. But I mean, they could do things like putting

353
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,590
Speaker 6:  a timer on it. So you can only edit within 90 seconds or something. A lot

354
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,490
Speaker 6:  of people are wanting to use edits for fixing typos. And right now the solution

355
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,450
Speaker 6:  is to delete the tweet. So like if it had a window that you could edit,

356
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,290
Speaker 6:  just like you can undo emails that you send in Gmail through, you can set

357
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,100
Speaker 6:  like various like 10, 15, 30 second windows, or maybe they could do like

358
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,790
Speaker 6:  a, a way to show, edit history, which I think how Facebook

359
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,430
Speaker 6:  handles it. I actually used Facebook in a long, long time, but like the,

360
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,320
Speaker 6:  the, if you make any edits, you can look at the history of it and see the

361
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,620
Speaker 6:  version of like what it was before and what it is. Now, those would kind

362
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,610
Speaker 6:  of like address a lot of those initial concerns about

363
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,790
Speaker 6:  somebody changing something that's part of the public record. But the other

364
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,300
Speaker 6:  part of the thing that Facebook, or excuse me, Twitter announced this week

365
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,900
Speaker 6:  is that like Twitter doesn't really care about historical records.

366
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,680
Speaker 6:  Like, you know, they, they announced this week that like,

367
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,520
Speaker 6:  when you delete a tweet, it's going to break every single embed of

368
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,240
Speaker 6:  that tweet, which historically did not happen. If a tweet was deleted and

369
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,510
Speaker 6:  it happened to be embedded in an article or another place using Twitter's

370
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,200
Speaker 6:  native end bed tools, you would be able to see what the text of that tweet

371
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,680
Speaker 6:  was. Now it's going to be gone. Like they're using some like hacky

372
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,580
Speaker 6:  JavaScript that you can kind of disable and get around it. But most

373
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,400
Speaker 6:  people aren't going to. So most people are just going to see a blank spot

374
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,150
Speaker 6:  there where a formerly deleted tweet. So like, I don't think

375
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,360
Speaker 6:  Twitter really thinks or cares that much about historical record. I think

376
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,660
Speaker 6:  it wants, it wants people to use it service more

377
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,520
Speaker 6:  ephemerally than, than archivally. So

378
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,340
Speaker 6:  it wants people to be uninhibited and, and speak their mind and share

379
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,150
Speaker 6:  things easily and not feel like it's going to live there forever for

380
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,080
Speaker 6:  them

381
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,190
Speaker 3:  Shit posters.

382
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,250
Speaker 6:  It wants shit posters, but like, why don't they, why doesn't it have a native

383
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,760
Speaker 6:  way to automatically delete your tweets? Like it, they don't serve that.

384
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,970
Speaker 6:  They don't have that feature. So I don't know. Twitter is a weird company

385
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,970
Speaker 6:  to try and figure out it's thinking behind.

386
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,950
Speaker 5:  So I got to say like, I

387
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,580
Speaker 5:  definitely feel like Elmo and the hell

388
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,420
Speaker 5:  fire here about the edit button. Like bring it on, like

389
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,320
Speaker 5:  don't like time limit it. Like don't, don't do anything reasonable

390
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,210
Speaker 5:  with it. Like this is already,

391
00:23:59,210 --> 00:23:59,660
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

392
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,650
Speaker 5:  This is Twitter. Like it's already chaotic. It's a mess. Like

393
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,550
Speaker 5:  it's a place for like people to like, be absolutely wild

394
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,420
Speaker 5:  online. And it's like entering the arena. And like,

395
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,170
Speaker 5:  if that's, If that's what we're gonna do, let's

396
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,110
Speaker 5:  just, let's go all the way there. Like why the fuck not?

397
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,040
Speaker 3:  Yeah, just absolutely blow it up. Well, I think it's going to be

398
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,880
Speaker 3:  very interesting. Anyway, we kind of look at it like,

399
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,720
Speaker 3:  who knows is it going to become the, the shit posting Supreme?

400
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,220
Speaker 3:  We've said shit posting so many times on this podcast.

401
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,770
Speaker 6:  We are definitely hitting our quota of shit. Posting mentions.

402
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,040
Speaker 5:  This is what you get when you light doesn't show up. Nobody stops me from

403
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,760
Speaker 5:  swearing.

404
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,730
Speaker 3:  We're sorry. Neela is actually gonna have to come through and manually bleep

405
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,970
Speaker 3:  out every single one. That's what he's going to be doing on the

406
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,900
Speaker 3:  plane. Just bleeping them all out while cursing, probably us at the same

407
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,730
Speaker 3:  time. I feel sorry for the people sitting next to him on the plane. It's

408
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,370
Speaker 3:  going to be rough, but Liz, thank you so much for coming and

409
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,210
Speaker 3:  chatting.

410
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,970
Speaker 5:  It's my pleasure to be here. I always want to say hi, Liz

411
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,940
Speaker 3:  Is going to go. We're going to take a break. And when we get back, Alison

412
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,810
Speaker 3:  is going to be here. We're going to talk about the one plus 10 pro there's

413
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,960
Speaker 3:  a whole bunch of monitor reviews. There's some Samsung tablets. It's gonna

414
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,020
Speaker 3:  be

415
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,280
Speaker 3:  fun.

416
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,350
Speaker 3:  Alright, we are back with Alison. We're going to talk

417
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,770
Speaker 3:  about phones. You reviewed a big phone today.

418
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,950
Speaker 9:  I did, sir. All bank. Let's be honest,

419
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,180
Speaker 9:  physically.

420
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,900
Speaker 3:  There are no small phones anymore and there's no Nila. So we can talk about

421
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,680
Speaker 3:  how good small phones are. Dan is totally

422
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,550
Speaker 3:  outweighed here. We went small phone superiority.

423
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I will. I will say that. Alison is the one who also reviewed the iPhone

424
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,600
Speaker 6:  se and her main thesis on that was, this screen is too

425
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,500
Speaker 6:  small. So I just want to like put that out there, but let's

426
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,200
Speaker 6:  talk about the OnePlus 10 player pro, which is a very different phone than

427
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,190
Speaker 6:  the se.

428
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,120
Speaker 9:  Yes. Okay. It's it's large, but I actually, for a big

429
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,360
Speaker 9:  phone, I like how it feels. It has that slightly

430
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,300
Speaker 9:  taller 20 to nine aspect ratio is

431
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,870
Speaker 9:  green. So it just feels like a little bit nicer in your

432
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,770
Speaker 9:  hand. And that there there's tons of things. I really

433
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,460
Speaker 9:  like about it, like personally, but it's really hard to

434
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,270
Speaker 9:  recommend and it just comes down to two things. It does

435
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,810
Speaker 9:  not work on a T and T five G and it

436
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,530
Speaker 9:  never will. Apparently

437
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,470
Speaker 3:  It's like the reverse of the original iPhone.

438
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,430
Speaker 9:  Right.

439
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:49,270
Speaker 3:  You can do only, not this carrier we'll work on Jenna five

440
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,800
Speaker 3:  SIS when it comes out.

441
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,570
Speaker 9:  Oh, that's the question. Isn't it?

442
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,750
Speaker 3:  That's like, I think a lot of people care. I think a lot of people want to

443
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,560
Speaker 3:  know

444
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,430
Speaker 9:  I'm going to start asking all the OEMs about Jennifer subsistency

445
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,890
Speaker 3:  Support unified says yeah.

446
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,760
Speaker 9:  With a straight face. Yeah. Yeah. So it's no, no 5g on

447
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,720
Speaker 9:  at and T it'll work. You can use LTE. And

448
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,260
Speaker 9:  it's worth saying that 5g on at T and T right now

449
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,250
Speaker 9:  is not that special, but it will get better over

450
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,730
Speaker 9:  the next few years. So that's where that's kind of a

451
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,480
Speaker 9:  major point against the 10 pro and

452
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,290
Speaker 9:  that in the camera system is fine, but it's

453
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,250
Speaker 9:  just not for a flagship phone. It's just not keeping

454
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,790
Speaker 9:  up kind of year on year with when you have the pixel

455
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,020
Speaker 9:  six pro right there or the galaxy <inaudible>

456
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,690
Speaker 9:  plus it kind of sucks to be like, yay. It's

457
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,060
Speaker 9:  just fine. It's okay.

458
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,360
Speaker 3:  I feel like for $900, your phone probably needs to be more than

459
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,170
Speaker 3:  fine.

460
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,450
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Yeah. I think so. What I

461
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,930
Speaker 3:  Thought was so funny was it like, you still really like this phone,

462
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,500
Speaker 3:  like it's not great, but what does, is it just

463
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,230
Speaker 3:  charm? Is there like a charm to the phone?

464
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,800
Speaker 9:  I think maybe I think it charmed me. Well, first of all, it's

465
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,540
Speaker 9:  green

466
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,990
Speaker 6:  Instant bonus points scored on the curve. Now

467
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,050
Speaker 9:  I put, I put a plus one right next to the

468
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,050
Speaker 9:  score because it's green

469
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,320
Speaker 9:  as no, it's pretty, it's like a shiny green to you.

470
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,860
Speaker 6:  We really missed an opportunity to make a OnePlus joke, but I'll leave

471
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,670
Speaker 6:  it.

472
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:28,540
Speaker 9:  Ah, Okay. I'll show myself out.

473
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,440
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It's like the, this kind of slender form factor. It

474
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,370
Speaker 9:  has this kind of like OnePlus mystique. I

475
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,760
Speaker 9:  feel like. And I don't know if it's just that I've been reviewing like a

476
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,480
Speaker 9:  thousand Samsung phones, but it just feels really

477
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,900
Speaker 9:  kind of league and grown up, you know, the

478
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,680
Speaker 9:  interface. There's not, there's not a thousand things

479
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,670
Speaker 9:  pre downloaded. It feels like a phone, a grownup

480
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,860
Speaker 9:  with you is not to be, yeah.

481
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,250
Speaker 6:  It's a departure from like what the pixels are doing now. Right? Like, like

482
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,700
Speaker 6:  the pixels, especially with Andrei 12 are very colorful and

483
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,480
Speaker 6:  bubbly and cartoony to an extent. And that is not

484
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,200
Speaker 6:  this, right. Like if you want a more suit and tie type of

485
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,460
Speaker 6:  experience,

486
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,800
Speaker 3:  That's what I want from my phone. Yes.

487
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,760
Speaker 9:  It makes you feel like a little more powerful. I'm like maybe I have my life

488
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,160
Speaker 9:  together. We're using this phone.

489
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,530
Speaker 3:  Do you pick it up? And you know what an IRA is

490
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,500
Speaker 3:  immediately.

491
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,210
Speaker 9:  And I know whether I have

492
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,720
Speaker 9:  one. That's a great

493
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,620
Speaker 9:  question. Yeah. It's Android 12, especially with

494
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,460
Speaker 9:  the pixel phones is kind of all about, you know, material

495
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,420
Speaker 9:  you and the colors that throughout the system

496
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,170
Speaker 9:  match your wallpaper and it's fun and it's quirky. And I like it when

497
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,090
Speaker 9:  I use the pixel six, but I picked up this phone in it. It

498
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,540
Speaker 9:  is, you can customize it for sure, but it's

499
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,730
Speaker 9:  still has like a little bit of a OnePlus flavor to

500
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,630
Speaker 9:  it. And honestly, I think I like it. I

501
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,760
Speaker 9:  think I like it a little better.

502
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:03,970
Speaker 6:  Just a

503
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,820
Speaker 3:  Little, a little more nice.

504
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,490
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It's fancy. I felt a little fancy using this

505
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,530
Speaker 9:  phone

506
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,490
Speaker 3:  A little top hat, little, little monocle and an IRA

507
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,770
Speaker 3:  like, wow, th this,

508
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,400
Speaker 9:  I opened an IRA and I walked with a spring in my

509
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,050
Speaker 9:  step.

510
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,960
Speaker 3:  It's still, it's, it's $900 and it's not as

511
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,680
Speaker 3:  good as the other phones in that, that range. Right? Like the

512
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,450
Speaker 3:  camera quality is not as good.

513
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,410
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And it it's one plus is still really leaning on

514
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,020
Speaker 9:  this Hasselblad kind of partnership they

515
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,440
Speaker 9:  introduced with the nine series last year. And

516
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,220
Speaker 9:  their line with that is that the color science

517
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,490
Speaker 9:  is informed and tuned by

518
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,940
Speaker 9:  Hasselblad, you know, legacy camera

519
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,870
Speaker 9:  maker.

520
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,560
Speaker 3:  But it is that sort of like how, what was the phone maker that was like,

521
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,960
Speaker 3:  yeah, we use like a, in our

522
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,680
Speaker 6:  Huawei had a, yeah. While I had a, like a partnership for a few years.

523
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,550
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So like Walway and like that, that whole partnership was kind of proven

524
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,540
Speaker 3:  to be a little bit of just PR smoke. Like it was just some

525
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,380
Speaker 3:  marketing speak is Hasselblad and one plus the same

526
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,160
Speaker 3:  way.

527
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,700
Speaker 9:  Yeah. They've kind of, they've made some illusions

528
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,510
Speaker 9:  to even down the road. It could mean that Hasselblad has

529
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,230
Speaker 9:  more of a hand in the design of the hardware,

530
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,180
Speaker 9:  which is, is more interesting.

531
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,120
Speaker 3:  Like, will they really, isn't a hassle, but it's like

532
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,050
Speaker 3:  medium format, big cameras.

533
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,780
Speaker 3:  And this is like, what not, this is a tiny

534
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,250
Speaker 3:  sensor

535
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,610
Speaker 9:  On

536
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,510
Speaker 3:  Your phone.

537
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,840
Speaker 9:  Maybe they'll go the Sony route and it'll be something you can like clamp

538
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,830
Speaker 9:  onto the back of a phone that is a medium format sensor,

539
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,190
Speaker 3:  Just a big old lens. Slap it on there.

540
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,700
Speaker 6:  Just to clarify for now the 10 pro, just like the nine

541
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Speaker 6:  pro the hospital had partnership it mounts to

542
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,630
Speaker 6:  software interface slash features, maybe color

543
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,440
Speaker 6:  tuning. If we believe what they're saying and a logo on the back, right.

544
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,340
Speaker 6:  Like the, the they're not involved in the lens or the sensor or

545
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,350
Speaker 6:  anything on the hardware side of things.

546
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,220
Speaker 3:  Okay. But the color tuning are you seeing differences in it

547
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,370
Speaker 3:  versus like Samsung's aggressive thing

548
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,150
Speaker 9:  I get, I mean, I can see a difference between, but it's a really kind of

549
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:27,050
Speaker 9:  general, like, I can see what Samson's doing. I can see what

550
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,920
Speaker 9:  a pixel phone is doing. You know, a one plus

551
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,730
Speaker 9:  it's nice. I think the colors look nice. And I, I prefer it

552
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,510
Speaker 9:  over a Samsung. I just wouldn't go. As far as like, this

553
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,990
Speaker 9:  is Hasselblad color, you know, it doesn't just

554
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,860
Speaker 9:  scream at me. Like it's some kind of magic color

555
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,870
Speaker 9:  science. It's nice.

556
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah. What does Hasselblad color? Yeah.

557
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,720
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I was going to say that's like, not like a, like, I feel like if you

558
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,200
Speaker 6:  speak to photographers, a lot of them will know like Canon color is very

559
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,620
Speaker 6:  famous and well known. And if you go back far enough, you got like

560
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,130
Speaker 6:  Kodak and Fuji and the film stocks have like their known

561
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,000
Speaker 6:  colors, but like it I've, I've been really

562
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,900
Speaker 6:  invested in photography for decades. And I could not describe hostile blood

563
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,550
Speaker 6:  color science to you. So

564
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,300
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that was my impression too. Someone get

565
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,110
Speaker 9:  Fujifilm color on a smartphone. That's

566
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,240
Speaker 9:  the, that's the phone all.

567
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,200
Speaker 3:  Why has Kodak been spending all of this time with terrible CES

568
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,040
Speaker 3:  booths and not making actually good products when they could be like Kodak

569
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,940
Speaker 3:  color?

570
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,360
Speaker 6:  Cause Kodak's barely a company at this point.

571
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,150
Speaker 3:  Like, yeah, exactly. Like this is very, just licensing right

572
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,140
Speaker 3:  there on the table. You'll get like $5 for every phone.

573
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,070
Speaker 3:  You'll see. You'll make $20 will be great. Like, come on, Kodak sign

574
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,790
Speaker 3:  OD.

575
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,910
Speaker 6:  So the one plus 10 pro is it's kind of a weird launch, right? Like we're

576
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,030
Speaker 6:  getting it late. It's like three months after it came out in

577
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,990
Speaker 6:  China, but we're getting it now finally in the us. And it's

578
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,050
Speaker 6:  only available through T-Mobile. Could you like kind of explain like what

579
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,040
Speaker 6:  they're doing with like the launch of this phone and like, does it feel like

580
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,030
Speaker 6:  this company is invested in this phone or like we should care about it? Like

581
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,040
Speaker 6:  it's just seems very weird to me.

582
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,790
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It's, you know, more than one person I think

583
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,780
Speaker 9:  has felt like the us launch, particularly as sort of an

584
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,770
Speaker 9:  afterthought for one, plus it launched in China in

585
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,130
Speaker 9:  January. There were a lot of, you know,

586
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,120
Speaker 9:  specs dribbling out ahead of that. So it

587
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,900
Speaker 9:  was very much a known quantity before it made it

588
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,110
Speaker 9:  here, aside from the price, which I think is pretty

589
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,560
Speaker 9:  good. It could have been worse 8 99

590
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,650
Speaker 6:  It's less than last year. Right? Like it's, it's, it's lower than the one

591
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,100
Speaker 6:  plus nine pro was last year, last year, obviously we had the one plus

592
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,090
Speaker 6:  nine non-pro that was even lower, but that was, you know,

593
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,070
Speaker 6:  lower tier features and things like that. Right,

594
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,910
Speaker 9:  Right. Yeah. And the, the 10 pro that, or the nine

595
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,630
Speaker 9:  pro that we got in the U S was the higher storage

596
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,560
Speaker 9:  capacity tier. So it was more expensive. This is sort

597
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,310
Speaker 9:  of like meets everything in the middle and it feels about right. But yeah,

598
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,970
Speaker 9:  it's sort of feels like a launch that has sort of

599
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,930
Speaker 9:  fallen flat and I wish there was more

600
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,710
Speaker 9:  exciting stuff to say about this phone. It's good. The charging, I

601
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,670
Speaker 9:  think we should like mention again because they get

602
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,850
Speaker 9:  that right. You know, it's 65 watt wired

603
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,660
Speaker 9:  charging and, and you get a charger in the

604
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,590
Speaker 9:  box

605
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,520
Speaker 6:  Comes

606
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,120
Speaker 3:  What I feel like that's the perfect segue to talk about the

607
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,000
Speaker 3:  Samsung tablets, because, because

608
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,720
Speaker 6:  You don't

609
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,680
Speaker 3:  Get a charge, like how are you charging the, these tablets that do not

610
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,900
Speaker 3:  include a charger in the box? Oh,

611
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,820
Speaker 6:  Well I've got one of those like hand crank things that you like

612
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,490
Speaker 6:  to run a flashlight and then I plugged it into a tablet. Yeah, no. So I

613
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,210
Speaker 6:  finally review the tab S eight family of

614
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,170
Speaker 6:  tablets. They will be live on the site tomorrow morning is from when we're

615
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,660
Speaker 6:  recording this. So you'll probably have seen them by the time you hear this.

616
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,410
Speaker 6:  But yeah. So Samsung has the tab, the tab eight plus the Tennessee

617
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,590
Speaker 6:  ultra, they are premium level tablets. They start at

618
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,650
Speaker 6:  $700 for the cheapest one. And the most expensive one is like

619
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,610
Speaker 6:  $1,500 before you even add things like a case or a

620
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,460
Speaker 6:  keyboard or anything like that. And none of them come with a charger in the

621
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,360
Speaker 6:  box, which I just think is an absurd thing for a product

622
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,510
Speaker 6:  of a that's price. And this type there's like, you know,

623
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,500
Speaker 6:  obviously Alison knows very well. We're kind of used to phones, not

624
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,350
Speaker 6:  coming with a charger in the box at this point, because you can always use

625
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,150
Speaker 6:  your phone's charger from before. That's the assumption is you have a phone

626
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,120
Speaker 6:  charge already and you can use it be from before. I don't really buy that

627
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,750
Speaker 6:  assumption. I think a lot of people just end up buying third party chargers

628
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,500
Speaker 6:  because yesterday's phone charger is not as powerful as today's phone

629
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,980
Speaker 6:  charger and doesn't charge your devices quickly. But that problem becomes

630
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,610
Speaker 6:  magnified on the tablets because there's so much bigger. So like, if all

631
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,060
Speaker 6:  you have is like this dinky five watt charger from your

632
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,090
Speaker 6:  phone, and you're trying to charge a thousand dollar tablet, it's going to

633
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,810
Speaker 6:  take like forever to charge the giant battery in this thing. And they

634
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,230
Speaker 6:  support up to 45 watt charging. But in order to do that, you have to

635
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,010
Speaker 6:  buy a separate charger. So not only are they expensive, but they also

636
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,080
Speaker 6:  kind of demand that you buy another charger. Okay.

637
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,740
Speaker 3:  I feel like if I opened the box and I pull out my

638
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,770
Speaker 3:  big thousand $1,500,

639
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,080
Speaker 3:  14.3 inch,

640
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,370
Speaker 6:  14.6,

641
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,330
Speaker 3:  14.6 inch tablet, that I've spent

642
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,900
Speaker 3:  $1,500 on and I pull it out of the box and I do

643
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,770
Speaker 3:  not see a charger I'm contacting Samsung. Cause I'm sure there's a

644
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,080
Speaker 3:  mistake.

645
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,010
Speaker 6:  I mean, I mean, that's what I did when w when I got the review units in,

646
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,280
Speaker 6:  I opened them up and I contacted Sandy. I was like, is this right? And they're

647
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,120
Speaker 6:  like, yeah, no, that's how it is. So, you know, it's a

648
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,780
Speaker 6:  bummer. You know, they, they have their reasons. I think the reason is fundamentally

649
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,530
Speaker 6:  profit margins, not the environment or anything green of that

650
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,190
Speaker 6:  sort, but going into this, you should know that you're not getting a charger

651
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,040
Speaker 6:  with it. That all said I've had the privilege of

652
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,190
Speaker 6:  reviewing a lot of Samsung tablets over the years. And

653
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,060
Speaker 6:  the general consensus, every single time is the

654
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,870
Speaker 6:  same old Android tablet story of like Android tablets are poorly

655
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,110
Speaker 6:  supported. They don't have optimized apps. They're not as good as the

656
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,860
Speaker 6:  iPad, so on and so forth. And

657
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,730
Speaker 6:  this time around that still is the case, but it's not like

658
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,660
Speaker 6:  the full story. And especially with the tab S eight and the S

659
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,390
Speaker 6:  eight plus, which are the lower, the less expensive ones. So they're like

660
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,860
Speaker 6:  $700 and $900.

661
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,700
Speaker 3:  You would actually want to

662
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,300
Speaker 6:  Buy the 11 inch model. And the 12.4 inch model, they are basically updates

663
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,110
Speaker 6:  to the tab S seven line from two years ago, if you happen to

664
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,830
Speaker 6:  have a Samsung phone, and you were like invested in the Samsung ecosystem,

665
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,700
Speaker 6:  you're a Samsung phone user. Maybe you've got an S 21 or 22, or

666
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,570
Speaker 6:  maybe even a fold. And you've got Samsung galaxy buds and things like that.

667
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,320
Speaker 6:  They're like a lot of things that make sense for you to buy a

668
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,070
Speaker 6:  Samsung tablet instead of an iPad now. So there's like

669
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,880
Speaker 6:  integrations where you can send your text messages from the tablet, just

670
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,450
Speaker 6:  like you would on the phone, or obviously any apps you buy on the phone are

671
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,810
Speaker 6:  going to be available on the tablet, which wouldn't happen if you were bought

672
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,500
Speaker 6:  an iPad, other integrations that like iPad and iPhone users are

673
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,250
Speaker 6:  familiar with, like the ability to turn on mobile hotspot on your phone,

674
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,210
Speaker 6:  right from the tablet is now available. So like, there's these kind

675
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,110
Speaker 6:  of like integrations that if you are bought into the Samsung family of

676
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,980
Speaker 6:  products, I can like squint and see the reason

677
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,080
Speaker 6:  why you would buy a Samsung tablet at this point,

678
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,920
Speaker 3:  Who those people are. Like I know in Korea, that

679
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,700
Speaker 3:  makes a lot of sense, because Samsung is just like the

680
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,190
Speaker 3:  number one phone in Korea

681
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,820
Speaker 6:  Phone companies in the U S that's cell phones, right. It is apple and

682
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,820
Speaker 6:  Samsung. So like, I think there are a lot of people in the U S who, who kind

683
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,810
Speaker 6:  of fall under that. They, they, they got a Samsung phone because

684
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,380
Speaker 6:  like second, most popular company, very few people want to buy pixels. And

685
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,110
Speaker 6:  very few people actually buy OnePlus phone. So, I mean, a lot of people own

686
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,290
Speaker 6:  Samsung phones. A lot of people will own Samsung earbuds to go with their

687
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,470
Speaker 6:  Samsung phones that don't have headphone jacks. So like, make sense. That

688
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,220
Speaker 6:  earbuds thing I should say is like very similar to Apple's

689
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,060
Speaker 6:  ability to switch your AirPods from your phone to your tablet

690
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,180
Speaker 6:  automatically Samsung basically adopted that feature for its own devices

691
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,570
Speaker 6:  now. So if you have Samsung galaxy buds and they're connected to your phone,

692
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,020
Speaker 6:  and then you go pick up your tablet and start playing music or a video on

693
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,050
Speaker 6:  that, it will automatically switch the audio over, which is like a great

694
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,820
Speaker 6:  convenient feature. When it works.

695
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,240
Speaker 3:  It never works. You word, it always

696
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,720
Speaker 3:  activates, like if I get a notification on my phone, it'll be like, oh, do

697
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,820
Speaker 3:  you want me to switch over? And I'm like, no, I don't want you to switch

698
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,120
Speaker 3:  over.

699
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,300
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, like even apple doesn't have that, like ironed out entirely.

700
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,700
Speaker 6:  I'm not gonna, I'm not going to try and say, like, anybody's really figured

701
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,640
Speaker 6:  that out completely, but it is a feature that I personally use all the time

702
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,250
Speaker 6:  between apple devices. It's nice to have it on the Samsung side of things.

703
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,640
Speaker 6:  It's nice to have those quality of life things, but like that only works.

704
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,000
Speaker 6:  If you have Samsung products, if you have a pixel phone, or if you have any

705
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,390
Speaker 6:  other Android phone, you lose out on like all of those integrations. And

706
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:03,320
Speaker 6:  so, like, it makes less sense to buy a Samsung tablet. At that

707
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,410
Speaker 6:  point, you start to lose a lot of those advantages. And then the conversation

708
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,650
Speaker 6:  becomes like, well, okay, maybe you should just buy an iPad because you're

709
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,710
Speaker 6:  going to lose these integrations. You're not going to get the benefits of

710
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,580
Speaker 6:  them. I personally think that the tab S eight is the most compelling of all

711
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,280
Speaker 6:  three, which is the smaller one because of the way that I use the tablet

712
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,850
Speaker 6:  is for like watching video and reading magazines and reading

713
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,970
Speaker 6:  books and stuff like that in a smaller size. It's much easier to do that

714
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,490
Speaker 6:  with if you are, you know, more into like maybe game

715
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,440
Speaker 6:  streaming, which is one thing that Android does do better than iOS, maybe

716
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,620
Speaker 6:  the larger screens would be more compelling to you, but I think most people

717
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,430
Speaker 6:  should probably stick to the tab or the tab of C plus. And let's

718
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,330
Speaker 6:  let the ultra let's let that bake for a few more years before we

719
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,510
Speaker 6:  start spending big bucks on that thing.

720
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,420
Speaker 3:  The one with a 14.6 inch screen,

721
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,420
Speaker 6:  It's a dazzling display. It's a lovely screen to look at.

722
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,350
Speaker 3:  But realistically, like I remember there was many, many years

723
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,680
Speaker 3:  ago, I think HP did an Android tablet that was like

724
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,030
Speaker 3:  17 inches.

725
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:05,390
Speaker 6:  Samsung had a 17 at Samsung Android tablet. They tried to pitch it as a kitchen

726
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,930
Speaker 6:  TV, and it came with like a built-in kickstand. And you're supposed to put

727
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,470
Speaker 6:  it in the kitchen and watch TV. Yes. But like, it wasn't even framed as like

728
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,280
Speaker 6:  a tablet so much unless outside the fact that it had a touch screen.

729
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,250
Speaker 6:  Whereas this is like very much like you buy it. It comes in the box, there's

730
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,000
Speaker 6:  no keyboard or anything. That's a $350 add-on, which

731
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,020
Speaker 3:  Is

732
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,950
Speaker 6:  A lot of money. And so it is a tablet first and foremost, and it

733
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,500
Speaker 6:  runs Android and it has like mobile software on

734
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,040
Speaker 6:  it. And my, my opinion of this, and I should say

735
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,000
Speaker 6:  always that a review is an opinion based on my experience using it is

736
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,480
Speaker 6:  that this is the size of a laptop. Especially once you have the

737
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,450
Speaker 6:  keyboard, it's a, it's as big as a laptop, it's as expensive as a premium

738
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,380
Speaker 6:  laptop. And so the expectations of it, of what you can do with it

739
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,710
Speaker 6:  should go up and are commensurate to what you expect from a laptop. And it

740
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:56,010
Speaker 6:  does not hit that because it runs into the limitations of being a mobile

741
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,530
Speaker 6:  operating system very quickly.

742
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,240
Speaker 3:  It starts at $1,500.

743
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,810
Speaker 6:  So it starts at 10 99 for the base model for just the

744
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,770
Speaker 6:  tablet and $350 for the keyboard. But you can spec up the

745
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,860
Speaker 6:  tablet with more storage too. I think in the neighborhood of 1500 bucks,

746
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,790
Speaker 6:  just for the, the tablet itself, the model that I reviewed was like $1,200.

747
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,350
Speaker 3:  And how many, how much storage did you get there?

748
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,220
Speaker 6:  The base model, I think is 128 gigs of storage.

749
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,910
Speaker 6:  It does have a micro SD card, so you can, you know, can upgrade the

750
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:24,570
Speaker 6:  storage.

751
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:28,320
Speaker 3:  I'm just going to throw this out there. You can get the USCIS R O G

752
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,310
Speaker 3:  flow Z 13, which is also

753
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,560
Speaker 3:  a very large tablet

754
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,040
Speaker 6:  For

755
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,550
Speaker 3:  $1,900. And it includes the case with the

756
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,850
Speaker 3:  keyboard, right? And a terabyte of

757
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,480
Speaker 3:  storage and Ram and windows. So it actually

758
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,040
Speaker 3:  works as a computer

759
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,600
Speaker 6:  Can run PC games.

760
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,790
Speaker 3:  It can rent, like I'm just,

761
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,690
Speaker 6:  Or if you look outside of tablets and just like what you could

762
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,620
Speaker 6:  spend money on, instead you get a Mac book air for a thousand bucks. You

763
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:02,340
Speaker 6:  can get a surface laptop for that price you could

764
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,210
Speaker 6:  get. I mean, I really think like, like the Seuss gaming tablet

765
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,540
Speaker 6:  is not going to satisfy the customer, looking at the Samsung tablets because

766
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,470
Speaker 6:  it's thicker, it's heavier. It's not smelt sweet and, and sleek and

767
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,130
Speaker 6:  stuff like that. But Microsoft surface pro devices certainly

768
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,090
Speaker 6:  are. And like the, the reason to buy this over a Microsoft surface

769
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,990
Speaker 6:  pro if like this is like the, the segment that you're playing in or

770
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,420
Speaker 6:  looking at, like, doesn't make it a lot of sense. It doesn't really add up

771
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,540
Speaker 6:  yet. And part of that is because you run into software limitations really

772
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,470
Speaker 6:  quickly, either the apps aren't like, I'll give you this example. We

773
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:38,370
Speaker 6:  use slack here at the verge. We rely on it. We use it day in and day out.

774
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,970
Speaker 6:  Slack does not have a tablet optimized app, which means that the Android

775
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,540
Speaker 6:  app for slack is stretched to cost 14.6

776
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,240
Speaker 6:  inches. And it's just like, it just like stretches it across. And you

777
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,980
Speaker 6:  got all your little tiny little names of your conversations on the

778
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,820
Speaker 6:  left side and nothing for the rest of the screen. And then you

779
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:00,810
Speaker 6:  click on it and you got like, I mean, it's absurd. And like, yeah, you can

780
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,080
Speaker 6:  use the split screen function. So you could say like, I've got slack in one

781
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,010
Speaker 6:  side and the browser and another, or whatever, or you could

782
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,430
Speaker 6:  switch to Samsung's Dex mode, which is like, they try to force a

783
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:15,360
Speaker 6:  desktop windowed mode onto Android.

784
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,570
Speaker 6:  And that works about as well as you would expect. They try to like, make

785
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,380
Speaker 6:  it feel like windows or Mac iOS, but it, it like, doesn't, you run into

786
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,890
Speaker 6:  issues really quickly. Like going back to slack, slack is now in like a little

787
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,800
Speaker 6:  window and you can't really easily adjust the text size. And

788
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,520
Speaker 6:  so scaling is all weird and wrong, or some apps just don't launch or like

789
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,480
Speaker 6:  window management is footsie. Like, it's, it's, it's good for like in a

790
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,810
Speaker 6:  pinch, if you need to do something with more windowing. But like, I could

791
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,770
Speaker 6:  not imagine I tried, I could not work on it all day long. Like it just like,

792
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,300
Speaker 6:  I hit too many frustrations.

793
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,020
Speaker 3:  Sorry. I just keep being like, who is this

794
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,110
Speaker 3:  for? Who is the person who is the decks

795
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:57,070
Speaker 3:  user? So obsessive, I want to talk to you,

796
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,620
Speaker 3:  like, are, do you, did you look at this

797
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,610
Speaker 3:  14.6 inch starting at a thousand

798
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,210
Speaker 3:  dollar tablet, 700 that cannot do any of the things

799
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,050
Speaker 3:  windows could do that could do iPad, iOS things

800
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,740
Speaker 3:  kind of similar, and you bought it like you, you

801
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,300
Speaker 3:  wanted this device

802
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,290
Speaker 6:  Look like people buy iPad pro 12.9 that are priced out to

803
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,220
Speaker 6:  $2,000. I don't know why. I mean, that's not me, but there

804
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,600
Speaker 6:  are people that buy that. But I think that

805
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,960
Speaker 3:  It's 12.9, like it's small. I can fit that in a bag.

806
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,830
Speaker 6:  And it's practically pocketable. The difference is there as obviously apple

807
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,490
Speaker 6:  has a much stronger ecosystem of software support for the iPad than Android

808
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:40,420
Speaker 6:  does. And like, that's just like a hard reality. And maybe you can

809
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,750
Speaker 6:  like thread that needle where like all the apps that you do care about, or

810
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,560
Speaker 6:  you can live entirely within Samsung's apps and you don't run into that problem,

811
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,430
Speaker 6:  but it really does not take long to find an issue with, you

812
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,790
Speaker 6:  know, or, or trying to run an app on, on an Android tablet that does not

813
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,250
Speaker 6:  work well on it. So there, there are people out there that like do that on

814
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:01,120
Speaker 6:  the iPad and maybe Samsung thinking they will do this for the tablet se

815
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,990
Speaker 6:  ultra. But what I really think is, is Samsung is doing its thing where

816
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,620
Speaker 6:  it is throwing ideas out into the market and seeing what

817
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,550
Speaker 6:  happens. And they are like, we've got this 14.6 inch led screen. It's

818
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:16,300
Speaker 6:  really cool. It's 120 Hertz. We want to put it in a product.

819
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,200
Speaker 6:  Let's just slap it onto a five millimeter thick tablet and see

820
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,420
Speaker 6:  what happens. And we'll charge a lot of money. Not a lot of people are going

821
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,480
Speaker 6:  to buy it, but we'll learn how they use it. And we'll tweak it over the next

822
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,720
Speaker 6:  generation in generation.

823
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,660
Speaker 3:  They kind of just made a cool laptop.

824
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:32,260
Speaker 6:  They do make laptops. It's a

825
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,000
Speaker 6:  Samsung we're talking about, they make everything.

826
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,990
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But, but a 14.6 old led display and a

827
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,790
Speaker 3:  laptop I'd, I'm like, all right,

828
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,690
Speaker 6:  If you are the product manager in charge of the galaxy tablet line, you

829
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,530
Speaker 6:  are like, screw them laptops or making a tablet. I got this screen,

830
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,250
Speaker 6:  we're using it.

831
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,850
Speaker 9:  Maybe it's aspirational. It's like you sell the

832
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,780
Speaker 9:  smaller tablets by being like, we have this big one. It's like the bottle

833
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,440
Speaker 9:  of wine.

834
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,910
Speaker 6:  I mean, that's certainly a part of it.

835
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,230
Speaker 3:  You see? You're like, oh man, I can't that's too much.

836
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,870
Speaker 9:  Well, I'll just go a couple steps down.

837
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,270
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

838
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,970
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, there might be part of it, but I also think that Samsung is

839
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:13,840
Speaker 6:  experimenting in public. They did it with the galaxy fold. It took three

840
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,960
Speaker 6:  to two and a half, three generations to really become a product that was

841
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,530
Speaker 6:  like, we can start to say like, oh wow. We're, we're really seeing the

842
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:24,310
Speaker 6:  usability of this. The first one, as everyone knows, went really

843
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,860
Speaker 6:  bad, really south really quickly. If you look at history of the galaxy

844
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,640
Speaker 6:  note, the first galaxy note was not that great. It was kind of big and

845
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,880
Speaker 6:  chunky and limited. And like it, it was made fun of at the time for having

846
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,360
Speaker 6:  a big screen, obviously Samsung understood that big screens were kind of

847
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,600
Speaker 6:  the future, but you look at every single galaxy note after that, it was

848
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,500
Speaker 6:  optimized to become smaller and easier to use and

849
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,350
Speaker 6:  have an even bigger display and so on and so forth. So like, this is the

850
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,250
Speaker 6:  way Samsung works. I'm not surprised by it. This is the first iteration around

851
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,800
Speaker 6:  this. I think in a couple of years, they're going to do it again. And maybe,

852
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,370
Speaker 6:  maybe they'll have improved the software somewhat. Maybe, you know, Google

853
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:02,150
Speaker 6:  keeps floating this idea that it cares about Android tablet software again.

854
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,870
Speaker 6:  And so maybe in a couple of years that will have materialized into something

855
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,800
Speaker 6:  more suburban

856
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,700
Speaker 3:  Because we invested a thousand dollars minimum in this tablet. And if you

857
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,300
Speaker 3:  wait three to four years, you'll really, that's what it

858
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,830
Speaker 3:  really kicks off.

859
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:18,350
Speaker 6:  No rule do not buy something today. Hoping you're getting something out of

860
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:21,080
Speaker 6:  it tomorrow. Like buy it for what it is today. And I, I don't think you should

861
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,220
Speaker 6:  buy this one yet.

862
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,850
Speaker 3:  The more Cardinal rule is never buy an Android tablet,

863
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,240
Speaker 3:  expecting Google to go and invest in Android.

864
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,960
Speaker 6:  That's why Samsung is in its position now, like Samsung built decks

865
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,890
Speaker 6:  specifically because Google was not investing in Android tablets.

866
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,550
Speaker 6:  And so like it had to build it on their own. And as a result, it's kind of

867
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,880
Speaker 6:  like this weird side project that gets not much attention every year. And

868
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,480
Speaker 6:  really the development on that has been really slow. But like that is a very

869
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,200
Speaker 6:  clear, obvious response to like Google doesn't care about Android tablets,

870
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,860
Speaker 6:  but we don't really have any other mobile operating systems around here.

871
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,260
Speaker 6:  Nobody wants to ties in tablets. So like, what are we going to do with it?

872
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,190
Speaker 6:  So

873
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:02,060
Speaker 3:  Somebody wants to Tyson tablet, there's like one, one TV

874
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:06,050
Speaker 3:  smart TV user that just loves Tizen. They actually can

875
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,510
Speaker 3:  explain the difference between it and Android.

876
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,710
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Maybe,

877
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,360
Speaker 3:  Maybe

878
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,450
Speaker 6:  Anyways, to go back to it. Like, I think that the tab essay and the Tampa

879
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:18,200
Speaker 6:  state plus all do have their like place and like, I think they're too

880
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,680
Speaker 6:  expensive. I would love for Samsung to, to do something that's more competitive

881
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,980
Speaker 6:  on like the iPad air front, really like kind of the meat of the market of

882
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,910
Speaker 6:  like people who are buying tablets. But if they have, if they take what they

883
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:32,120
Speaker 6:  did here and move it down, markets, I think that like, they, they could have

884
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,930
Speaker 6:  a potential or like a good compelling story there. I just think the

885
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,530
Speaker 6:  ultra is, is needs more time. Well, we'll check in, in a couple of years,

886
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,340
Speaker 3:  Little, a little more time. And there was, there was one more big display

887
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,150
Speaker 3:  this week, which was a cam did a,

888
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,840
Speaker 3:  an, a review of the Alienware Alienware's new

889
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,190
Speaker 3:  QD Ola display.

890
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,580
Speaker 6:  You want to, you want to take a stab at naming that product name on, on the

891
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,110
Speaker 6:  microphone.

892
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:59,930
Speaker 3:  I'm not even going to try to do it from memory. This, the, the

893
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:03,580
Speaker 3:  very catchy Alienware, a w

894
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,550
Speaker 3:  34, 23 DW

895
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:07,910
Speaker 3:  rolls

896
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,260
Speaker 6:  Right off the tongue,

897
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,190
Speaker 3:  Like Dell. I will never understand why

898
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,670
Speaker 3:  they just refuse to give cool names to things like they give cool names.

899
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,480
Speaker 3:  It's called Alienware. And they're like, no, that's, as far as we hit Alienware,

900
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,200
Speaker 3:  that's as cool as you get everything else after that, it has to be like completely

901
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,140
Speaker 3:  forgettable. Like, I don't know how, like nobody's going to go in and

902
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,260
Speaker 3:  say, I want the a w 34, 23 D

903
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,590
Speaker 3:  w when they want to buy this thing. Right.

904
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,380
Speaker 6:  Okay. Well then what they'll say is I want that qto led screen. So like,

905
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,830
Speaker 6:  this is the first QD led on the market. I mean, we've seen a bunch of

906
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,860
Speaker 6:  announced. Sure. What bunch were announced at CES? This is technically the

907
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,350
Speaker 6:  first one that's arrived, even though if you try to buy it today, I think

908
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:50,220
Speaker 6:  cam was telling me that you will get it at the end of June. So they are like

909
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,400
Speaker 6:  massively ordered a little supply chains, but it shows there's probably a

910
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,760
Speaker 6:  high demand for it as well. But it's really interesting because qto led is

911
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,540
Speaker 6:  this new led technology that is supposed to solve a lot of the

912
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,630
Speaker 6:  traditional complaints of OLED. It's brighter. It's got better color

913
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,560
Speaker 6:  reproduction, it's got more things to help mitigate our

914
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,830
Speaker 6:  or extended longevity in lifespan and things like that. And it's very interesting

915
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,730
Speaker 6:  to see it deployed in a gaming display versus a TV.

916
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:18,720
Speaker 6:  And so if you are looking for the best gaming monitor

917
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,590
Speaker 6:  at the moment and are willing to wait two months to get it hard to recommend

918
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,550
Speaker 6:  anything else.

919
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:27,420
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I like, I'm very excited about this thing. Honestly. I think

920
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,410
Speaker 3:  this is kind of one of the cooler things we've seen in monitor technology

921
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,510
Speaker 3:  in the last few years,

922
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,730
Speaker 6:  Really? The, the studio display webcam. Didn't do it for you.

923
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:39,120
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean, you know, I really, I really wanted the webcam. That's not

924
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,020
Speaker 3:  a hard thing to do. Everybody should be like every monitor maker should be

925
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,920
Speaker 3:  putting a webcam in. This is like the easiest, lowest stakes

926
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,660
Speaker 3:  when you can have yeah.

927
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,410
Speaker 6:  To be fair. Dell did not. So the Alienware alphabet

928
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:56,340
Speaker 6:  soup does not come with a webcam. What I think is the real

929
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,970
Speaker 6:  difference and what is makes the, this Alienware monitor kind of

930
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,480
Speaker 6:  exciting. And the studio display kind of disappointing in many ways is

931
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,720
Speaker 6:  that apple did not innovate at all on the display side of things, which is

932
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,330
Speaker 6:  like the most important part of a monitor monitors, how it looks in the technology,

933
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:13,050
Speaker 6:  it uses to display photos and pictures and colors and things like that. And

934
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,990
Speaker 6:  they did not. It's exact same thing as what we've known for quite a

935
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,890
Speaker 6:  while. This is innovating on that. And this is a new

936
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,670
Speaker 6:  technology on how a screen is actually displaying things. And

937
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:26,430
Speaker 6:  like, it's got a fast refresh rate. So when you're gaming on it, it's very

938
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,910
Speaker 6:  smooth. It's got awesome color reproduction. It's got incredible viewing

939
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,690
Speaker 6:  angles. I think there's some pictures in cams review of like coming at it

940
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:37,380
Speaker 6:  from like 170 degrees from the side. And it's like

941
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,310
Speaker 6:  still full of saturation and like popping off the screen.

942
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:45,120
Speaker 6:  It's, it's, it's everything you know about your iPhone screen

943
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,050
Speaker 6:  on a 34 inch canvas, that's two feet from your face. And so

944
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,320
Speaker 6:  it's like really quite incredible when you're playing games on it. But even

945
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,410
Speaker 6:  if you're just like using it as like a standard monitor, we tested it with

946
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:59,190
Speaker 6:  both windows and Mac Mac, you might be hit or miss with the HDR modes,

947
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,180
Speaker 6:  but the refresh rate worked on a couple different Macs.

948
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,030
Speaker 3:  I see. I don't judge the monitor for this because I'm

949
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,930
Speaker 3:  using an LG monitor right now with HDR,

950
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:13,920
Speaker 3:  with my Mac studio. And Apple's HDR

951
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,090
Speaker 3:  mode is not,

952
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:17,990
Speaker 6:  I mean, to be fair windows, HDR is not

953
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,900
Speaker 3:  Like neither, neither company has figured out like what HDR means. And

954
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,600
Speaker 3:  even like, we're seeing that games too most, unless you're in film and TV,

955
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,020
Speaker 3:  HDR is like extremely hit or miss on whether or not it'll

956
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,900
Speaker 3:  just make a garbage out of their

957
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,150
Speaker 3:  display. Just like

958
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:37,720
Speaker 6:  I use an HDR monitor with my Mac and I have to have her off because when

959
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,580
Speaker 6:  I turned her on it just washes the whole,

960
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,160
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Everything just washes out. And sometimes we will, like when you play

961
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,470
Speaker 3:  a game, sometimes you'll be like, I'm going to turn on HDR mode and everything

962
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:48,190
Speaker 3:  just descends into darkness. And you're like, okay, I didn't actually need

963
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,030
Speaker 3:  it to be a candle lit scene. Like in, like, I think I feel like candles put

964
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:55,900
Speaker 3:  off more light than this display does. And so I think I'm not going to knock

965
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,710
Speaker 3:  it for that. I just cause also, I just think it's a really cool

966
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,980
Speaker 3:  looking monitor and I love that. Like somebody is actually caring about picture

967
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,820
Speaker 3:  quality and not just speed and a monitor that's meant for consumers

968
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,630
Speaker 3:  because there's a lot of people that like picture quality is usually very

969
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:11,620
Speaker 3:  expensive. Right.

970
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,290
Speaker 6:  And especially like when we're talking about gaming monitors, it's usually

971
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:18,100
Speaker 6:  the last thing on the list of things that they care about. Gaming

972
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,670
Speaker 6:  monitors, prioritize input time or input response. They

973
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,270
Speaker 6:  prioritize refresh rate, they prioritize size and they don't even really

974
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:28,360
Speaker 6:  prioritize resolution. Cause you know, most gaming monitors are 10 ADP or

975
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,810
Speaker 6:  1440 still. This one is still 1440. It's an ultra wide. So it's like

976
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:35,500
Speaker 6:  34, whatever by 1440. So it's not a 4k

977
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:39,340
Speaker 6:  monitor. It's not a 5k monitor at all. It's not that like super

978
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,240
Speaker 6:  sharp fidelity, but the colors are amazing. And the

979
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,750
Speaker 6:  gamuts that it covers are amazing. And that's what we are not used to seeing

980
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,590
Speaker 6:  in the gaming monitor world. And so like, it's a big step forward for that

981
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:54,370
Speaker 6:  in that it is giving you these incredible colors and visuals and

982
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,940
Speaker 6:  also being a really killer performer on games.

983
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,360
Speaker 3:  Like I just want an all led display. That's

984
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,230
Speaker 3:  fast, but also like high enough resolution that I don't see every

985
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:09,130
Speaker 3:  little pixel on my monitor when I'm looking at it. Like,

986
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:12,130
Speaker 3:  it feels like there should be a thing that people do.

987
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,640
Speaker 6:  I mean, you could do that. You could stick a 4k OLED TV on your desk. It's

988
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,760
Speaker 6:  just the enormous.

989
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,140
Speaker 3:  You still see the pixels because a 4k OLED TV like scoot

990
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,100
Speaker 3:  back. Yeah. Like way back. Like by, at

991
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,550
Speaker 3:  my, my, my corridor on my headphones, doesn't go that far. You have to get

992
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:31,510
Speaker 3:  a new headphones. Like I don't get it.

993
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,990
Speaker 3:  Well, that's the QD. Hold on. That's the

994
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:38,460
Speaker 3:  Alienware a w 34,

995
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,370
Speaker 3:  23 DW an absolutely terrible name

996
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:46,270
Speaker 3:  for a very, very cool monitor. We're going to take a break. And

997
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,970
Speaker 3:  when we're back, we're going to do a lightning round. There's a bunch of

998
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:52,840
Speaker 3:  smaller, smaller gadgets and technology news. Let's do it. Alison, are you

999
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,840
Speaker 3:  going to stick around? You want to do the lightning round with us? I'm in,

1000
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,220
Speaker 3:  let's do it. All right. We'll be

1001
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,510
Speaker 3:  back.

1002
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,630
Speaker 3:  And were back with the lightening round. There's a lot

1003
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,870
Speaker 3:  of stuff I'm going to, I'm going to start actually,

1004
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,650
Speaker 3:  because that was not the only QD Allah display we saw this week,

1005
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:15,490
Speaker 3:  or Like, I'm sorry. Nila is not here.

1006
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:19,330
Speaker 3:  He's not here to like keep me from going on display tangents. There's

1007
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:22,450
Speaker 3:  like, I have all the power right now and I'm going to use it.

1008
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,840
Speaker 6:  I think he's going to be upset that he missed this because we're having some

1009
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,520
Speaker 6:  really great display conversation.

1010
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,450
Speaker 3:  Robinson, this is fun. And Samsung FA is showing off

1011
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:35,440
Speaker 3:  it's its new QD OLED TV. We didn't go to CES where I think

1012
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,250
Speaker 3:  some people saw it, but Chris Welch went out and saw the display and was

1013
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:43,120
Speaker 3:  like, all right. Yeah, this is, this is legit. And he saw it in the TV

1014
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:47,080
Speaker 3:  version and that means like Samsung and all these other plate people,

1015
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,980
Speaker 3:  when they do these, these TV like displays like show

1016
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,550
Speaker 3:  offs, they usually have a couple other TVs there and they always say, we're

1017
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,310
Speaker 3:  not going to tell you what the TVs are. And they're very obviously like a

1018
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:01,240
Speaker 3:  Sony and an LG display. And it's like, thank you for

1019
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,200
Speaker 3:  putting a small piece of black tape over the Sony, but we know what it is.

1020
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,010
Speaker 3:  And he got to go and he saw it like with the other TV is, and he's like,

1021
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:13,000
Speaker 3:  oh no, this is, this is legit. This is very, very cool. And like, you

1022
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,730
Speaker 3:  can see it. And 90% of people probably won't

1023
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:19,110
Speaker 3:  care. And I'm like, I'm, I'm the

1024
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,090
Speaker 3:  10%. So I'm like, yes,

1025
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:25,050
Speaker 6:  These are a premium TVs. So like, you know, they're the higher end of the

1026
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,470
Speaker 6:  market and like that, you know, person buying that is probably a little more

1027
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:31,620
Speaker 6:  discerning. I think it's exciting that Samsung is finally playing in the

1028
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:35,400
Speaker 6:  old led space on TVs. We known Samsung makes OLED screens for

1029
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,060
Speaker 6:  phones, tablets, and laptops for very long time. But like we've not seen

1030
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,780
Speaker 6:  them on TV. So it's exciting that they're here and they're this

1031
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,380
Speaker 6:  good from what we can tell, obviously we'll be reviewing it and have more

1032
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,220
Speaker 6:  final, you know, real world impressions later

1033
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:53,580
Speaker 3:  Expensive too. Like you will not be

1034
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:56,160
Speaker 3:  finding one of these,

1035
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,030
Speaker 6:  This isn't, this isn't your black Friday thousand dollar Olin TV. Like you're

1036
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,560
Speaker 6:  not going to find the deal on this.

1037
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,460
Speaker 3:  Here's this isn't like the B the BX or the CX

1038
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:09,270
Speaker 3:  when it goes on sale, this is your good pudding. This is the old school led

1039
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:11,070
Speaker 3:  where you're absolutely gonna put some money into it.

1040
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,220
Speaker 6:  Yeah. At least this year. I mean, give it a couple of generations and the

1041
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,710
Speaker 6:  prices will certainly come down, but it's exciting. It's exciting that they're

1042
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,340
Speaker 6:  here. It's exciting that effectively LG has been like the

1043
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:23,340
Speaker 6:  only LG display I should say, which is their display

1044
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:27,060
Speaker 6:  subsidiary or division has been like the only player in

1045
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,480
Speaker 6:  consumer Owlette televisions, especially in the U S if you've got a Sony,

1046
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,130
Speaker 6:  it's got an old LG panel, obviously the LGS have an LG OLED

1047
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:37,770
Speaker 6:  panel. So now we've got like another option and

1048
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,330
Speaker 6:  Competition. Competition's great.

1049
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:42,210
Speaker 3:  It's great. Where's my E ink TV. That would be

1050
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:45,360
Speaker 3:  terrible. That would be the ugliest

1051
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,620
Speaker 6:  Monitors for you, Alex.

1052
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,070
Speaker 3:  I know. And they're terrible. I tried to use one and I was

1053
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:54,060
Speaker 3:  like, I couldn't even, I like open slack and I had it in dark mode. And so

1054
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,630
Speaker 3:  it was just like all black on the screen. I couldn't see

1055
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:01,050
Speaker 3:  anything. Like, I couldn't even refresh because I was like, I don't know

1056
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:04,950
Speaker 3:  what's happening. Just darkness. Do not. I mean, you can try it.

1057
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:08,400
Speaker 3:  I encourage everyone to try something once, but you'll do it once. And you'll

1058
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,320
Speaker 3:  be like, yeah, she was right. That was bad.

1059
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,800
Speaker 6:  The other Samsung thing that Chris got to see, it's the latest frame TV.

1060
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,800
Speaker 6:  And I think like, to your point, Alex, like about most people not caring

1061
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,730
Speaker 6:  about the QD OLED versus Olin debate, people love, the people love the frame.

1062
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:24,420
Speaker 6:  Like the frame TV is like super popular. I think it like scratches an

1063
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:28,410
Speaker 6:  itch that like people feel like they don't like

1064
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,350
Speaker 6:  having, this is the reason that everyone has this idea of projectors being

1065
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,870
Speaker 6:  so great. And I think we talked about this in the past because they don't

1066
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,860
Speaker 6:  like a big black square on their wall that just sits there and takes

1067
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:41,340
Speaker 6:  up space all the time. So Samsung solution is to make it display

1068
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,030
Speaker 6:  art. And this year it's got a matte display so that it

1069
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:48,300
Speaker 6:  actually looks more like art, as opposed to a screen. That's showing you

1070
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,080
Speaker 6:  something, which is very cool. I think that's it. And Chris says, it's very

1071
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,320
Speaker 6:  convincing. You have to like really get close to it to realize that it's

1072
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,650
Speaker 6:  actually a screen that's emitting light as opposed to something that's

1073
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:00,550
Speaker 6:  more, you know, passive

1074
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:04,090
Speaker 3:  The sacrifice you're making. Cause like doing the mat display and stuff that,

1075
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,240
Speaker 3:  that affects the quality of the display

1076
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,990
Speaker 6:  In theory, Samsung claims it doesn't. But you know, again, we'll, we'll,

1077
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,490
Speaker 6:  we'll be testing it out for sure.

1078
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:15,450
Speaker 3:  Absolutely. Like everybody would be doing mat displays

1079
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,850
Speaker 3:  if it didn't affect the quality. But I think for

1080
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:22,630
Speaker 3:  90% of people that's enough. I'm I'm honestly, I'm

1081
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:26,620
Speaker 3:  still kind of stunned that Samsung has this thing that sells

1082
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,370
Speaker 3:  pretty well. It's very popular. People love it. It's very aspirational

1083
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:34,210
Speaker 3:  technology and not a single other TV company has been like, man,

1084
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,820
Speaker 3:  we should make like a TV that doesn't look

1085
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,360
Speaker 3:  ugly, Like low

1086
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,780
Speaker 3:  stakes. Like just make it look like a cool frame. And everybody's like,

1087
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:47,140
Speaker 3:  no, we're just going to make the black square.

1088
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,870
Speaker 6:  And the frame is not new. It's been out for like half a decade, at least.

1089
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:53,140
Speaker 6:  So like, there's been, there's lots of time for other manufacturers to get

1090
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,710
Speaker 6:  in this. I think, you know, it depends on the technology. They were aligned.

1091
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:00,400
Speaker 6:  LG loves it's old TVs, right? Th that's like their premium flagship technology.

1092
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,000
Speaker 6:  You can't leave a static image on an OLED TV. It will absolutely degrade

1093
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,360
Speaker 6:  the panel. And then you'll have burn-in. So like Samsung is using LCDs and

1094
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,170
Speaker 6:  many LEDs here that it can get away with that much

1095
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:15,160
Speaker 6:  easier than say LG could, but you know, why isn't TCL doing it

1096
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,200
Speaker 6:  or whatever the other brands,

1097
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,110
Speaker 3:  I wonder what the power bill is. Like, maybe that's the reason, cause you've

1098
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,590
Speaker 3:  got a TV on for just 24 7.

1099
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,170
Speaker 6:  Well, they have, they have the sensor in there. Right? So like, it turns

1100
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,810
Speaker 6:  off if nobody's in the room and then if someone's in the room, it comes on

1101
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:31,720
Speaker 6:  and it's got the ambient light sensor and adjust it and all that stuff. I

1102
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,570
Speaker 6:  think the, like if you look at the, like the, the power usage on them, I

1103
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:38,140
Speaker 6:  think the maximum usage is like 60 Watts. It's not a ton. And so

1104
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,650
Speaker 6:  like, that's like a light bulb was 20 years ago. So

1105
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:44,800
Speaker 9:  Couldn't it be eating? Did we, Tara, did we come full

1106
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,190
Speaker 9:  circle? But what if it was eating,

1107
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,840
Speaker 6:  But what if it was eating?

1108
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,380
Speaker 3:  It was like, you just roll an E ink. Like, like how the, the

1109
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:57,160
Speaker 3:  LG rolling display. You just roll an E ink display in

1110
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,580
Speaker 3:  front of it and like bam, beautiful black and white art.

1111
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,510
Speaker 9:  Yep.

1112
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:05,500
Speaker 3:  That's it. I, this I, that is a, somebody can take that idea. I'm

1113
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,550
Speaker 3:  just put it out there in the

1114
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:08,200
Speaker 6:  World by that.

1115
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,040
Speaker 3:  Like I would buy that. I like, at least Alison sounded like she might almost

1116
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:12,120
Speaker 3:  be

1117
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,390
Speaker 9:  I've probably. Yeah, sure. I

1118
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:16,420
Speaker 3:  Can get one or two customers.

1119
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:20,290
Speaker 6:  I would want it to run the Kindle app.

1120
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:20,560
Speaker 3:  Read

1121
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,510
Speaker 6:  EBooks on my,

1122
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:25,900
Speaker 3:  Just really enjoy it. I Alison what's what's the news that you love

1123
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:26,950
Speaker 3:  today.

1124
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:30,850
Speaker 9:  I was just really loving Andy Hawkins back to

1125
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:34,270
Speaker 9:  the future jokes with this DeLorean

1126
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:38,110
Speaker 9:  story. It's I don't understand cars. I don't follow the cars, but there's

1127
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:41,410
Speaker 9:  a DeLorean. That's going to be an

1128
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:45,310
Speaker 9:  electric vehicle in the future.

1129
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:48,430
Speaker 9:  So they say it's sad. There's a very like dubious kind of

1130
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:52,000
Speaker 9:  vibe to this article. They've promises

1131
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,800
Speaker 9:  before.

1132
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,020
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It'll presumably go 88 miles per

1133
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,500
Speaker 3:  hour. It will presumably not run on

1134
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,230
Speaker 3:  nuclear fuel that

1135
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:04,180
Speaker 6:  Won't run on a blender. I

1136
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,150
Speaker 3:  Mean, it will actually, depending on where you

1137
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,990
Speaker 3:  live, it will be running on nuclear power because you're gonna have to charge

1138
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:14,440
Speaker 3:  it and maybe you hear your power, so, oh my God.

1139
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,510
Speaker 9:  But can you get to the future that way?

1140
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:21,110
Speaker 3:  I do not think you can get to the future, but yeah. Doloria

1141
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:25,010
Speaker 3:  like, is it a, this big like car company? They

1142
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:27,830
Speaker 3:  didn't really make a whole lot of cars, right?

1143
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:31,340
Speaker 6:  No, they have a very famous a fall from grace story. John

1144
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:35,330
Speaker 6:  DeLorean had a lot of legal troubles, which eventually tanked his company.

1145
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:38,510
Speaker 6:  And so they became iconic when, you know, back to the future, came out in

1146
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:42,350
Speaker 6:  the mid eighties and doc brown turned to his old DeLorean into a time

1147
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,650
Speaker 6:  machine.

1148
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:45,650
Speaker 3:  I see one on the road. I still scream.

1149
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,450
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, they're very rare.

1150
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:51,230
Speaker 3:  It's like seeing a famous person. I know. I don't even

1151
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:54,740
Speaker 3:  scream when I see a famous person. I'm just like, yeah.

1152
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:58,550
Speaker 3:  Okay. Like I saw Emily blunt runtime in the street. I was like, oh yeah,

1153
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:01,790
Speaker 3:  she's tall. And I, and I kept on, I see a DeLorean in the street. I'm like,

1154
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,440
Speaker 3:  oh

1155
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,350
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And there and there, you know, there's a whole lot of like community

1156
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:10,310
Speaker 6:  of like restorers that keep them alive, but they are getting older and

1157
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:13,160
Speaker 6:  the parts are becoming less and less available. So the odds of you seeing

1158
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,940
Speaker 6:  an actual DeLorean on the road are becoming less and less, but this is like

1159
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,180
Speaker 6:  a new car with the DeLorean brand. You

1160
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:23,840
Speaker 6:  know, it's a new company, you know, so on and so forth.

1161
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,990
Speaker 3:  So this is a lot like when somebody was like, we're going to launch a new

1162
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:30,680
Speaker 3:  Atari console and we were like, oh yeah, good luck with that, buddy. When

1163
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,550
Speaker 3:  you, when you, when you show us the console and we can play games on it,

1164
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:35,840
Speaker 3:  we'll believe you.

1165
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,740
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So they say August 18th, 20, 22, we

1166
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,740
Speaker 6:  will see more. So like right now they've shown the left tail

1167
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:43,850
Speaker 6:  light.

1168
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,910
Speaker 3:  That's as much as the computer could render of the 3d

1169
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:50,390
Speaker 3:  render, they couldn't finish the rest of the time for the

1170
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,110
Speaker 3:  announcement.

1171
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:55,070
Speaker 9:  You don't have a right tail light without a left tail light. So they're

1172
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,720
Speaker 9:  off to a good start. I think.

1173
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It looks like this might have a, a side view mirror,

1174
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,430
Speaker 9:  At least one,

1175
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:05,390
Speaker 3:  At least one or his brake lights. Like so, so when it's driving and it hits

1176
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:08,810
Speaker 3:  the brakes, presumably you'll be able to see out of one, one tail light.

1177
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:12,350
Speaker 3:  But yeah, this is probably we'll we'll maybe, maybe

1178
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:16,160
Speaker 3:  August we'll see something for real. Maybe August. We'll see

1179
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:20,090
Speaker 3:  yet another very obvious 3d render because it, it

1180
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:24,020
Speaker 3:  wasn't an obvious 3d render. We would've seen more than the tail light.

1181
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,470
Speaker 3:  Just throwing that out there. Just, just possibly,

1182
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:30,890
Speaker 9:  Oh, mark my calendar. I'll check in and see how that's going. You work

1183
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,930
Speaker 3:  With Andy on it. You guys,

1184
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:34,760
Speaker 9:  I just, I just assigned myself that

1185
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,010
Speaker 9:  one.

1186
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:39,500
Speaker 3:  Dan, what's the big news that jumped out at you this week.

1187
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,070
Speaker 6:  I want to just highlight Shawn Hollister had a, really a great piece

1188
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:46,880
Speaker 6:  on logic techs. What he calls it, the magic mouse, but it's

1189
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,720
Speaker 6:  like not apples magic mouse. Everyone knows Apple's magic mouse is the

1190
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,110
Speaker 6:  one that you have to like flip it upside, upside down to charge it. And you

1191
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:58,100
Speaker 6:  can't charge it while you're using it with logic techs, mouse.

1192
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,550
Speaker 6:  That's actually been out for like five years, just charges

1193
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:05,300
Speaker 6:  forever on its mousepad. And it's like a wireless mouse that wirelessly charges

1194
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,480
Speaker 6:  on his mouse pad. And it's very, very cool. It's been popular for a long

1195
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,410
Speaker 6:  time, but you know, there's always something cool out there that that's been

1196
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,130
Speaker 6:  popular for a while, but it's really interesting.

1197
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The magic mouse, the real appeal of the magic mouse Apple's

1198
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,820
Speaker 3:  magic mouse is that you can scroll sideways, easily.

1199
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:21,990
Speaker 6:  Timeline goes sideways.

1200
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,410
Speaker 3:  That's it? Everything else is like terrible about it. Like the, the

1201
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,830
Speaker 3:  ergonomics are awful. The fact that like you have, you can't use it when

1202
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:32,280
Speaker 3:  you need a charge. It is mind numbingly stupid

1203
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,030
Speaker 3:  by by 2022, but you can scroll

1204
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:39,930
Speaker 3:  sideways. Can you scroll sideways with Sean's Logitech mouse?

1205
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:43,890
Speaker 6:  You know, I, I suppose if you have the scrolly wheel, it's like

1206
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:46,860
Speaker 6:  a very traditional gaming mouse is the thing it's like, it looks

1207
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:50,550
Speaker 6:  like any other Logitech gaming mouse. It's just, you put this

1208
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:54,510
Speaker 6:  special mouse pad under it and it automatically charges it, which is

1209
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,810
Speaker 6:  like, you never have to plug the thing in and you have the freedom of wireless

1210
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,900
Speaker 6:  control without the wires slowing you down. When you're, you

1211
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,640
Speaker 6:  know, 360

1212
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,820
Speaker 3:  Mousepad got to embrace the mouse in the pad,

1213
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:09,120
Speaker 6:  You know, looking at it. I don't think it has a sideways scroll wheel,

1214
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,750
Speaker 6:  but pro tip, if you hold the shift key and use the

1215
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:16,170
Speaker 6:  regular scroll bar, it goes sideways. But yeah, that's a, it's a fun piece

1216
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:19,770
Speaker 6:  that Sean talked to lodger tech. He like kinda got their like

1217
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:23,670
Speaker 6:  perspective on it. They say it's very popular, which is not surprising. Gaming

1218
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:27,210
Speaker 6:  mice have been very, very popular over the past couple of years. This is

1219
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:31,020
Speaker 6:  one of them, but they like haven't iterated on it in five or six years. So

1220
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:34,860
Speaker 6:  it's kind of just like sat there and done its thing and kept going.

1221
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,820
Speaker 3:  I love it. I love it. All right. That's the show. If

1222
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,580
Speaker 3:  you're listening to this, you should also be listening to the Dakota. There's
