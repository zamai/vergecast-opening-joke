Description: The Verge's David Pierce, Alex Cranz, Lauren Feiner and Nilay Patel discuss the breaking news about the the US Department of Justice accusing Apple of operating an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market in an expansive new antitrust lawsuit.

2
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:20,635
Speaker 3:  Welcome

3
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:24,435
Speaker 4:  To. The Vergecast. The flagship podcast of the performance smartphone market.

00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:25,995
Speaker 4:  Neil, which means something.

5
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:27,235
Speaker 3:  It means Neil.

6
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:29,915
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we're gonna spend the whole show figurine out what the performance

7
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:33,355
Speaker 4:  smartphone market is because that's what we do here on The Vergecast, I'm

8
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,035
Speaker 4:  your friend David Pierce. Alex Cranz is here. Hi Alex. I'm your

9
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:38,915
Speaker 5:  Friend who is so excited to talk about the news we've got today. Oh my

10
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:42,715
Speaker 4:  God. Pure unadulterated chaos. NELI Patel is not

11
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:45,715
Speaker 4:  here he is. I think last we heard in an airport

12
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:50,205
Speaker 4:  somewhere, somewhere Florida, maybe Florida. I don't know. NELI is gonna

13
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:53,965
Speaker 4:  come on the show in a little while because he could not possibly

14
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:56,325
Speaker 4:  ditch The Vergecast. But for now, Lauren Feiner here. Hi Lauren.

15
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:57,165
Speaker 6:  Hi.

16
00:01:57,865 --> 00:02:01,765
Speaker 4:  You've had what I would call a couple of days. How are you holding up?

17
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,845
Speaker 6:  I truly have. I'm hanging in there. It's been busy.

18
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:10,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, I believe it. So we have a lot to talk about and almost

19
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:14,045
Speaker 4:  all of it is just about Apple. Huge antitrust lawsuit against

20
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:16,605
Speaker 4:  Apple. We're gonna talk about that, then we're gonna talk about that more.

21
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:19,925
Speaker 4:  And then we're gonna do a lighting round and not talk about antitrust law

22
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:23,765
Speaker 4:  for once. But let's just dive right in. There is lots to get to here and

23
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:27,605
Speaker 4:  I think the first thing we should try to do is just like explain this

24
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:31,805
Speaker 4:  messy, long, complicated complaint as well as we can.

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,925
Speaker 4:  So Lauren at the risk of totally setting you up to do something

26
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:39,445
Speaker 4:  impossible here. Just start at the beginning. What, what happened here today?

27
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:43,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so this morning the DOJ and 16 state and District

28
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:47,965
Speaker 6:  attorney's general sued Apple for maintaining an illegal

29
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,605
Speaker 6:  monopoly in the smartphone market. So basically what they're saying here

30
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,645
Speaker 6:  is that Apple has basically made

31
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:59,685
Speaker 6:  consumers and developers more reliant on their ecosystem

32
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:04,445
Speaker 6:  through a series of actions. So they say they've done things like

33
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:08,525
Speaker 6:  disrupt super apps that could encompass a bunch of different

34
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:12,085
Speaker 6:  programs that would make the stickiness of iOS

35
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:16,685
Speaker 6:  less for consumers and developers or suppressing

36
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:20,605
Speaker 6:  the quality of messaging between iPhones and Androids,

37
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:24,885
Speaker 6:  you know, those infamous green bubbles. So there's all

38
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:28,805
Speaker 6:  sorts of things in this lawsuit that the DOJ is going after. And

39
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:32,285
Speaker 6:  basically just saying that Apple has

40
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:35,525
Speaker 6:  a abused its dominant position in the smartphone market.

41
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I feel like I, I've been trying to think how I would summarize all

42
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:43,085
Speaker 4:  of this and there's a ton of details and I actually think one very useful

43
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:46,885
Speaker 4:  thing this suit did was sort of divide itself into five categories. And I

44
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:49,565
Speaker 4:  wanna talk about each of those five categories, but I feel like

45
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:54,125
Speaker 4:  in a lot of cases it's basically like you either

46
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:58,285
Speaker 4:  bought your way into a monopoly, which is allowed, not allowed,

47
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,445
Speaker 4:  or you have done some kind of shady stuff in order to

48
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:05,205
Speaker 4:  remain in a monopoly, which is also not allowed. This is neither of those

49
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:06,045
Speaker 4:  things. This

50
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,885
Speaker 5:  Is, this is basically like they took all of my complaints about

51
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,125
Speaker 5:  iOS and said, actually that's illegal.

52
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:15,325
Speaker 4:  I mean, kind of. Yeah.

53
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:19,045
Speaker 5:  And I'm like, I was reading it, I was like, yes, yes. You get it. I hate

54
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:20,045
Speaker 5:  the green bubbles. Yeah,

55
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:21,005
Speaker 4:  I should off should

56
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:24,925
Speaker 5:  Be able to use a different watch. I was like, get it Cantor. I had

57
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:28,325
Speaker 5:  the best time reading it. I don't know if it's actually illegal, but I guess

58
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:30,565
Speaker 5:  that's why we have a court system, huh? Yeah,

59
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:34,405
Speaker 4:  We're we're gonna get to that because I too have that question. But

60
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:38,165
Speaker 4:  I feel like Lauren, tell me what you think of this. This read that I've been

61
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:41,765
Speaker 4:  workshopping over the last few hours, which is that basically what the DOJ

62
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:45,605
Speaker 4:  is saying is that Apple has done a

63
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:48,725
Speaker 4:  series of things to keep competitors

64
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:53,205
Speaker 4:  and users from getting the most outta their iPhone

65
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:56,125
Speaker 4:  or the most out of all the experiences they have in the iPhone. And so what

66
00:04:56,525 --> 00:05:00,485
Speaker 4:  consumers are getting is worse products for more money

67
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:05,125
Speaker 4:  that are harder to walk away from in any way, shape or form. and

68
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,925
Speaker 4:  that that is how Apple has abused its monopoly, that it is so powerful.

69
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:13,445
Speaker 4:  Not that it is explicitly doing something

70
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:17,445
Speaker 4:  nefarious to one of its competitors, but that it is just

71
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:20,645
Speaker 4:  making everything worse for everybody and that that shouldn't be

72
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,765
Speaker 4:  allowed. How far off am I?

73
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:26,805
Speaker 6:  That's essentially the argument. you know, they're basically saying, you

74
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:30,525
Speaker 6:  know, apple has through many different actions across

75
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:34,165
Speaker 6:  different areas, you just made it so that

76
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,205
Speaker 6:  it's just a little bit worse to

77
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:41,485
Speaker 6:  use its products or use someone else's products in combination.

78
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:46,445
Speaker 6:  So, you know, just making it so it's, there's more incentive to stay

79
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:50,485
Speaker 6:  on the Apple platforms than to try to

80
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,845
Speaker 6:  combine it with something else or move to something else,

81
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:56,565
Speaker 5:  Which is like by design. Like we talk about it all the time on the show.

82
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:59,245
Speaker 5:  Apple does all of this because it likes money.

83
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:02,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it's not illegal to like money.

84
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Apparently it is a little illegal.

85
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:10,525
Speaker 4:  Well and that's the, that's the like crazy mental gymnastics

86
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:13,845
Speaker 4:  of this suit to me. Which I think it's gonna be so interesting to see how

87
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:17,815
Speaker 4:  all of this goes. 'cause it's basically saying the iPhone

88
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:22,055
Speaker 4:  is bad. It's like a fundamental part of this argument. Or like

89
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:25,455
Speaker 4:  at least if it's not bad, it's not nearly as good as it could be. And

90
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:29,735
Speaker 4:  Apple is doing that on purpose. And the only reason Apple

91
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:33,535
Speaker 4:  would do that on purpose is to prevent people from leaving, which If you

92
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:37,335
Speaker 4:  think about it and just say it like that is bananas

93
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:38,255
Speaker 5:  It, but like,

94
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:41,575
Speaker 4:  But also it it like, it sort of holds and this is where we should probably

95
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:45,415
Speaker 4:  get into like each of the five things that that Apple

96
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:48,895
Speaker 4:  is being sort of accused of doing this to. And there's a much longer list

97
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:52,835
Speaker 4:  of, of like actual accusations here. But

98
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:57,035
Speaker 4:  the DOJ really boils it down to five things. And I'm just gonna read the

99
00:06:57,035 --> 00:07:00,675
Speaker 4:  five things. So it's basically super apps, which Lauren you mentioned

100
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:04,715
Speaker 4:  cloud streaming services by which it mostly means game streaming services.

101
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:08,475
Speaker 4:  Yep. Messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets.

102
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,555
Speaker 4:  What a fivesome.

103
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:14,315
Speaker 4:  But let's, let's just do these one at a time and I think we should basically

104
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:18,275
Speaker 4:  do it in the order in which the suit does it. And Alex, you and I

105
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:21,235
Speaker 4:  have been talking about the super apps thing all day. Yeah. So explain the

106
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:22,475
Speaker 4:  case for the super apps here.

107
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:26,515
Speaker 5:  Okay, so they are saying that super apps, which are super, super popular

108
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:30,595
Speaker 5:  in Asia to the point that Apple, they have like notes

109
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:33,795
Speaker 5:  from Apple being like, yeah those are super popular in Asia. That would be

110
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:36,075
Speaker 5:  super bad if they got super popular here in the United States.

111
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:39,195
Speaker 4:  And by super apps it's like, I mean WeChat ca like canonical

112
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:42,515
Speaker 5:  Example, right? Yeah. WeChat, cacao talk a lot. Like most

113
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:46,555
Speaker 5:  countries in Asia have some sort of app that like you can do just everything

114
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:49,875
Speaker 5:  in and, and we don't have that, we have iOS right at Android here

115
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:54,155
Speaker 5:  and, and so they're saying that these apps have been consistently like

116
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:58,115
Speaker 5:  kind of deprioritized and made worse on iOS and

117
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:01,955
Speaker 5:  they go through a lot of it. And it's kind of true, like

118
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:06,825
Speaker 5:  we don't know quite if people don't like super apps in the United States

119
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:11,345
Speaker 5:  because we just don't like Super apps or if it's because the experience is

120
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:14,865
Speaker 5:  kind of crummy on iOS and we all use iOS, well not all,

121
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:19,385
Speaker 5:  but a big chunk of us, 60 something percent of the market I think is

122
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:20,425
Speaker 5:  what the DOJ said.

123
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:24,825
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And, and they, they kept saying things like 75% of new phones are

124
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:28,665
Speaker 4:  bought are our iPhones and even that probably underrepresents the

125
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,065
Speaker 4:  monopoly number and it's like, well then tell me what the monopoly number

126
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:34,985
Speaker 4:  is. But anyway, I digress. Lauren, I'm really curious what your read

127
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:38,665
Speaker 4:  on this one was to me because I think the other four here are

128
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:42,545
Speaker 4:  things we've heard everybody yell at Apple about for a

129
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:45,585
Speaker 4:  very long time, right? Like it was pretty obvious this was gonna be about

130
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:48,625
Speaker 4:  game streaming. It was pretty obvious this was gonna be me messaging apps,

131
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:53,225
Speaker 4:  smart watches was a little bit of a right turn, but so was digital

132
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:56,285
Speaker 4:  wallets. But we can come back to this super apps. I would not, in a million

133
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,485
Speaker 4:  years If, you had been like, David, what are the 50 things in this lawsuit

134
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:03,405
Speaker 4:  gonna be about? I would not have picked super apps. What what's your

135
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:04,045
Speaker 4:  read on all this?

136
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:08,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that was surprising to me too. I think it just seems to fit

137
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:12,005
Speaker 6:  this general theme that the DOJ is going after that

138
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:16,045
Speaker 6:  super apps that basically they're saying that

139
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:20,045
Speaker 6:  Apple is trying to lock down its ecosystem

140
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:25,045
Speaker 6:  so that you know, developers can only do so much and you know, you

141
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:28,925
Speaker 6:  can't interoperate to a great degree and they don't wanna do things

142
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:32,765
Speaker 6:  that will take away from Apple's

143
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:36,765
Speaker 6:  own services and its own ecosystem. That that this

144
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:40,205
Speaker 6:  is how the DOJ is characterizing it. So I think it just fits the theme.

145
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:43,805
Speaker 6:  And so that's something that they decided to go with. I think

146
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:48,485
Speaker 6:  it, it is kind of surprising given given that, you know, we don't really

147
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:52,925
Speaker 6:  see a lot of super apps here in the US so it's kind of

148
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,405
Speaker 6:  like, is that a chicken or the egg problem? Is it, would we have more super

149
00:09:56,405 --> 00:10:00,165
Speaker 6:  apps if Apple was open to them or are they just not that popular

150
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:01,405
Speaker 6:  here for other reasons?

151
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I've spent a decade talking to people about that question and over

152
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:08,405
Speaker 4:  and over, the answer from people has been, well we just don't want it in

153
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:12,045
Speaker 4:  the us. But I do think it's true that it is also,

154
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,085
Speaker 4:  we've never really tested the theory in the US like WeChat is on the

155
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:19,405
Speaker 4:  app store, which I suspect Apple will be happily reminding lots and lots

156
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:23,325
Speaker 4:  of people of in the very near future. But it's not the same app. No,

157
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:27,445
Speaker 4:  and like the thing about WeChat is that like ESP

158
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:31,245
Speaker 4:  in a place like China and I have not lived in China. So, I can't

159
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:35,285
Speaker 4:  say this for sure, but I've heard that this is true. Is that like WeChat

160
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,445
Speaker 4:  is more important than your phone, right? Yeah. Like WeChat is the

161
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:43,135
Speaker 4:  thing and as long as it's there, you're good. Like the

162
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:46,975
Speaker 4:  hardware doesn't matter as much. So on the one hand A that has made China's

163
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:50,935
Speaker 4:  smartphone market like incredibly cool and competitive because all you

164
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:53,615
Speaker 4:  need is something that runs WeChat. So they all have to compete on something

165
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:56,695
Speaker 4:  else. So they build all this wacky hardware. There are a million different

166
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:59,655
Speaker 4:  brands out there doing stuff. They were early on Foldables, they were early

167
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:02,655
Speaker 4:  on flip phones, they were early on big new F phones. Like

168
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,375
Speaker 4:  the China market is thriving kind of as hardware in part because

169
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:08,735
Speaker 4:  WeChat is the thing.

170
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:12,495
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Which is kind of proving the point that the DOJ makes, which is that

171
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:17,215
Speaker 5:  we can't do all the cool stuff here because Apple is standing in the way

172
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:18,095
Speaker 5:  of it. And that's,

173
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:23,055
Speaker 5:  I don't know, that always feels true to me that that that that has felt like

174
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,735
Speaker 5:  a complaint. We're all like, yeah, I really want a folding phone. Well I'm

175
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:26,775
Speaker 5:  gonna wait until Apple Banks one.

176
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:30,615
Speaker 4:  No, I I think that's totally fair. Also, have you ever used WeChat?

177
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:31,535
Speaker 5:  No.

178
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:35,615
Speaker 4:  That app is a nightmare. Yeah, it's, it's just, and this is, this is

179
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:39,055
Speaker 4:  kind of what we're talking about. Like it's either a cultural difference

180
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,975
Speaker 4:  and there are a lot of people who make the case that it is a cultural difference

181
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:45,895
Speaker 4:  that in the US we like, we like cleaner, simpler,

182
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:50,055
Speaker 4:  more sort of straightforward and siloed off software. That is, that is, I

183
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:51,695
Speaker 4:  don't know how you prove that, but that is a thing you say, I

184
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:52,015
Speaker 5:  Mean Apple

185
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:55,845
Speaker 4:  Like that and has been true for a long time, right? Yeah. Whereas in

186
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:59,485
Speaker 4:  China, the idea of having every

187
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:04,085
Speaker 4:  possible thing that exists in the world just sort of shoved in one

188
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:07,405
Speaker 4:  place works. That's just what folks are used to and

189
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:11,245
Speaker 4:  yeah, like the counterfactual of like if it were just as easy to do in the

190
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:14,605
Speaker 4:  us would we have it? We'll never know. But I do agree with you that like

191
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:17,885
Speaker 4:  there is something in that logic that holds that If, you make the app

192
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:21,285
Speaker 4:  then the app has all kinds of fascinating antitrust things and would probably

193
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:24,925
Speaker 4:  be getting sued for the same thing. But at least like if If you wanna make

194
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:28,365
Speaker 4:  the case that that is what is keeping the hardware market from thriving China

195
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:29,965
Speaker 4:  seems like it would prove that case. Yeah.

196
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:33,845
Speaker 5:  And I, I think like what we see again and again in this complaint from

197
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:37,675
Speaker 5:  the US government is that they feel the united,

198
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:42,155
Speaker 5:  they feel Apple has become dominant. Apple dominates the market in the

199
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:46,115
Speaker 5:  United States specifically. Right. and that has totally warped how we

200
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:49,795
Speaker 5:  use different apps. and that is like just straight up true.

201
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:54,235
Speaker 5:  Right? Every single time we write a story about a green bubble, some of our

202
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:57,435
Speaker 5:  international colleagues are like, why are you writing about Green Bubbles?

203
00:12:57,435 --> 00:13:01,115
Speaker 5:  Do you know WhatsApp exists? And it's like, for sure. Yeah. And we don't

204
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,835
Speaker 5:  use it because we use iMessage because it is the dominant platform in the

205
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:07,755
Speaker 5:  United States because Apple is the dominant smartphone maker in the United

206
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:07,755
Speaker 5:  States.

207
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:10,835
Speaker 4:  I see. But then If you like rewind back further.

208
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:16,195
Speaker 4:  We adopted things earlier in the United States. So what we

209
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,155
Speaker 4:  actually did was we got hooked on SMS and, and WhatsApp came

210
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:24,115
Speaker 4:  up because SMS was really expensive in places where people couldn't

211
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:28,515
Speaker 4:  afford sms and in the US, by and large we could. And so

212
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:31,995
Speaker 4:  we just, we got hooked on SMS and then WhatsApp like end rounded it. And

213
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:34,675
Speaker 4:  the thing that iMessage did that was so smart was built on top of it, right?

214
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:38,355
Speaker 4:  Which is also in the same antitrust suit.

215
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:42,595
Speaker 4:  But Lauren, the thing I kept thinking about was I expected this first thing

216
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:46,155
Speaker 4:  that's actually about super apps to be about web apps. And, and this is the

217
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:48,795
Speaker 4:  thing we've been hearing a lot of is that like there's been this big fight

218
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,355
Speaker 4:  over the PWAs progressive web apps and this idea that like actually what

219
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,075
Speaker 4:  Apple is doing is systematically making the web worse. And this has been

220
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:59,995
Speaker 4:  a big part of the fight in the EU over how to make sort of these

221
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:03,755
Speaker 4:  cross platform web apps work better on the iPhone. Whether Apple

222
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,915
Speaker 4:  allows it or not. There wasn't really that much of

223
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,675
Speaker 4:  like the web in this complaint. Was that

224
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:14,955
Speaker 4:  as surprising to either of you as it was to me that I shocked me. Honestly,

225
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:19,475
Speaker 6:  I guess it's because they're focusing on this, you know, iPhone mobile device

226
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:23,195
Speaker 6:  ecosystem and it, it seems like everything is really focused on,

227
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,555
Speaker 6:  you know, how they've been able to advance this iPhone

228
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,715
Speaker 6:  platform to, you know, maintain their monopoly.

229
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:35,355
Speaker 5:  They do talk about web apps in this and what was interesting was they were

230
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,835
Speaker 5:  like, basically we considered web apps that is part of this, but that's already

231
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:42,555
Speaker 5:  part of the monopoly because it all has to be built on like

232
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:45,915
Speaker 5:  it's part of the bigger complaint, which is that Apple forces people to do

233
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:49,435
Speaker 5:  things in the Apple way, thus limiting development. Limiting

234
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:49,995
Speaker 5:  limiting

235
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,195
Speaker 5:  progress, right?

236
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,435
Speaker 4:  It's in sort of a tangential way. Yeah.

237
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,275
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So it's like tangential, but it's like, well you have to use WebKit

238
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:01,035
Speaker 5:  to do anything on an iPhone, right? So you are, you like,

239
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:04,275
Speaker 5:  you're stuck in it. We can't even talk about web apps because

240
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:07,435
Speaker 5:  WebKit exists is kind of like how they, they treat it.

241
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:11,595
Speaker 4:  My theory is also that whoever wrote and filed

242
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:14,675
Speaker 4:  this lawsuit decided that trying to explain the concept of

243
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:19,195
Speaker 4:  PWAs and browser engines Nope. And all of this was just like not

244
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,075
Speaker 4:  worth the hassle. Whereas you can just say super app out loud and people

245
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:26,875
Speaker 4:  like sort of understand what it is. Yeah. Where you're like the, the progressive

246
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,155
Speaker 4:  web app on my phone doesn't have access to the local C like everybody just

247
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:31,755
Speaker 4:  falls asleep. So they

248
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:35,475
Speaker 5:  Specifically say that's my right theory. They specifically say in it. Yeah.

249
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:39,275
Speaker 5:  Nobody knows how to use web apps on iOS because it's really complex and

250
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:42,435
Speaker 5:  weird and hard and I was like that. That's all. Yeah, that's true.

251
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:46,275
Speaker 4:  Do you even know how to find the ad to home screen button? Like no, no one

252
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:46,435
Speaker 4:  knows

253
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:46,955
Speaker 5:  Sometimes

254
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:51,115
Speaker 6:  I think you really can't underestimate how much the DOJ is going to have

255
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:54,715
Speaker 6:  to like really simplify this when they get to court.

256
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:59,795
Speaker 6:  Because having gone to the DOJ Google trial,

257
00:16:00,615 --> 00:16:04,315
Speaker 6:  you know, there's a lot, you know, the judge at times would be like,

258
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:08,635
Speaker 6:  you know, what are these things? And sometimes they're simple

259
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:12,515
Speaker 6:  things, sometimes they're complicated terms, but these are judges

260
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,475
Speaker 6:  that, you know, for one thing aren't usually taking antitrust

261
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,355
Speaker 6:  cases a lot of the time, especially not anti-monopoly cases. And second

262
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:24,315
Speaker 6:  of all, definitely don't know the ins and outs of such

263
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:28,035
Speaker 6:  a technical ecosystem. So, you know, I think there is

264
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:31,315
Speaker 6:  something to like, wanting to have a simple story to tell.

265
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,395
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And speaking of that, I think the, the next thing on the list, the

266
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,795
Speaker 4:  second one in the five was the game streaming services, which is another

267
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:42,715
Speaker 4:  one that I think is like a, a sort of viscerally understandable

268
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:47,475
Speaker 4:  thing. Like why can't I play Fortnite on my iPhone is actually like a

269
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:51,155
Speaker 4:  sort of universally understood question at this point. Alex, do you wanna

270
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:51,675
Speaker 4:  explain that one?

271
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:55,755
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So back in 2019 everybody said cloud gaming

272
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:59,035
Speaker 5:  is gonna be a thing and Apple said not on my watch.

273
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:03,315
Speaker 5:  And like that's, that's really what happened. Everybody was rolling it out,

274
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:07,035
Speaker 5:  it worked. You could get these apps on an Android and Apple was like, no,

275
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:10,715
Speaker 5:  we're not gonna put that on on our stuff. I remember talking to Google

276
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:14,515
Speaker 5:  and Microsoft and, and Nvidia at the time being like, do you guys wanna

277
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:18,475
Speaker 5:  give a comment on, on, on this? And then Epic sued Apple

278
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:23,275
Speaker 5:  saying, you know, you're, it was all related, right? Every, all of this was,

279
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:27,235
Speaker 5:  was related and Apple kind of like, would walk it back very occasionally

280
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:30,955
Speaker 5:  they'd be like, okay, well you can have cloud gaming, but it can only be

281
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:34,715
Speaker 5:  on those web apps that nobody knows how to use and that's,

282
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:38,235
Speaker 5:  that's one way you can do it or you can put it on the store, but we have

283
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:42,075
Speaker 5:  to approve every single game. And like no one

284
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:45,235
Speaker 5:  was gonna do that. If you've got 200 games, you have to get all 200 games

285
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:48,075
Speaker 5:  approved. If you've got three games, you have to get 'em all. Like, nobody

286
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:50,525
Speaker 5:  wants to do that. Right? You, you have to get every update approved. And

287
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:54,445
Speaker 5:  so it was really, really onerous and it really, it wasn't

288
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:58,405
Speaker 5:  the only reason Cloud gaming has not become just the, the

289
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:01,365
Speaker 5:  the new hot thing and everybody doesn't care about the PS five.

290
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:03,775
Speaker 4:  But it didn't help. It did

291
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,615
Speaker 5:  Not help. Yeah. It, it really hurt. It really hurt things and like, well,

292
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:06,775
Speaker 5:  and

293
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:10,375
Speaker 4:  I actually, I really liked this one in particular because I felt like that

294
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:14,255
Speaker 4:  was where the DOJ did the best job of explaining just like what a

295
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:18,255
Speaker 4:  gigantic pain in the ass Apple inflicts upon its

296
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:21,935
Speaker 4:  developers who wanna make things for iOS where it was basically like you,

297
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,015
Speaker 4:  like you said, you have to go through, you have to get every single game

298
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:27,935
Speaker 4:  approved. You have to run each one of them differently. These games get updated

299
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:32,175
Speaker 4:  constantly. Most of them are like service games that are just

300
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:36,055
Speaker 4:  running all the time. These live services games are everywhere now you

301
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:39,175
Speaker 4:  have to get every single update approved through this like opaque,

302
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:43,335
Speaker 4:  occasionally nonsensical Apple review process. Or

303
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:47,615
Speaker 4:  you have to like carve out a completely different game for

304
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:51,255
Speaker 4:  Apple and run everything over there elsewhere and then have a specific game

305
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,975
Speaker 4:  for the iPhone that it was just like, and this was kind of the point that

306
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:57,695
Speaker 4:  they're continuing to make is it doesn't necessarily matter whether

307
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:01,535
Speaker 4:  it's possible, but it is such a gigantic hassle

308
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:05,655
Speaker 4:  and pain and awful process for everyone involved that

309
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,975
Speaker 4:  no reasonable developer can be asked to do it. Yeah. And this is again where

310
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:12,455
Speaker 4:  I feel like we're in this weird sort of legal juujitsu thing that the DOJ

311
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:16,125
Speaker 4:  is trying to do, where it's like, if Apple had just

312
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:20,285
Speaker 4:  kept going to Epic and saying never game streaming on the app

313
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:24,005
Speaker 4:  store ever, that's a thing you can

314
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:27,085
Speaker 4:  poke at, right? Like that is a fight that you can actually pick in this way.

315
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:31,565
Speaker 4:  But what it's actually saying is like, okay, sure, good

316
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:35,445
Speaker 4:  luck assholes. Like, and that's, that's so much the vibe of like

317
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:37,925
Speaker 4:  a lot of what happens in the app store and we've all heard from developers

318
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:41,325
Speaker 4:  over the years who go through this awful process. Your app gets banned for

319
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:44,365
Speaker 4:  reasons you don't understand. Updates don't get approved for days or weeks

320
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:48,245
Speaker 4:  or months or ever. And so much of this just boils

321
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:51,885
Speaker 4:  down to this thing where like Apple is running its whole process

322
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:56,005
Speaker 4:  in such an awful way that it can't possibly be doing it for

323
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:59,205
Speaker 4:  anyone's benefit. It must be monopoly maintenance,

324
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:03,165
Speaker 4:  which is like, I don't know, slightly hard for me to wrap my head around,

325
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:06,365
Speaker 4:  but it it feels true in a certain way. Yeah.

326
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:07,765
Speaker 5:  It passes the stiff test

327
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:09,735
Speaker 4:  It does. I agree with that.

328
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:12,735
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like, like it it, it has a big whiff and we, we talked about this a

329
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:16,655
Speaker 5:  lot in the past few weeks because of what's going on in Europe where they're

330
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:19,975
Speaker 5:  like, oh yeah, yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna do what you ask in the most

331
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,735
Speaker 5:  obnoxious way possible and just, just make it as

332
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:26,895
Speaker 5:  painful as possible. You will hate yourself for it and you're probably not

333
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:29,295
Speaker 5:  gonna do it. And the government's like, Hey,

334
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:31,455
Speaker 5:  stop. Well,

335
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,335
Speaker 4:  And that's what we've heard from all the developers in the eu, right? Like

336
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:36,815
Speaker 4:  all the browser makers we're like, oh, that's so nice of you. We can use

337
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:40,055
Speaker 4:  our own rendering engine, but now we have to build two versions of our app

338
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:43,295
Speaker 4:  inside one version of our app that just sort of automatically selects like,

339
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:45,655
Speaker 4:  no, we're not doing that. And they've all, they've all basically been like,

340
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:49,005
Speaker 4:  no, this is actually worse than it was before. Yep. You've made our lives

341
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:53,125
Speaker 4:  harder in the name of pretending to make it easier. and that

342
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:57,085
Speaker 4:  feels like if I were to boil all of these accusations down, it

343
00:20:57,085 --> 00:21:00,765
Speaker 4:  would be that Yeah. That Apple, apple keeps claiming it's trying to do good

344
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:03,325
Speaker 4:  things for its users and all it does is make everything worse for everybody.

345
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:06,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Lauren how do you feel few times?

346
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,685
Speaker 6:  I think this one is interesting 'cause it, I think If, you look at the streaming

347
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:14,645
Speaker 6:  games claims, it kind of helps you understand the super apps claims in a

348
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:18,445
Speaker 6:  way because, you know, If you think about it like the way that David, you

349
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,285
Speaker 6:  were saying WeChat in China is like more important

350
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:26,085
Speaker 6:  than the phone itself. you know, the DOJ is saying here,

351
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,285
Speaker 6:  like Apple looked at cloud gaming and was like,

352
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:33,925
Speaker 6:  oh, if that is the North Star then the hardware

353
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,245
Speaker 6:  doesn't matter as much and we can't have the hardware not matter,

354
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:42,005
Speaker 6:  right? Because we want to make superior hardware and we want

355
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:45,965
Speaker 6:  that to be valuable to people. So I think that seems to be

356
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:48,525
Speaker 6:  like the theme that I'm seeing between those two claims

357
00:21:48,995 --> 00:21:52,525
Speaker 4:  That strikes me as way less compelling than the super app example. Like I,

358
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,485
Speaker 4:  I do think in theory the super app thing holds, and again, like in China

359
00:21:56,665 --> 00:22:00,445
Speaker 4:  it seems to be real. I just don't think there are that many people

360
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,165
Speaker 4:  out there who are like, if I can't play my two games,

361
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:08,485
Speaker 4:  I'm switching phone operating systems. No, I, maybe I'm wrong. I don't

362
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:10,125
Speaker 4:  think that was the argument. And maybe there's a whole generation of kids

363
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,165
Speaker 4:  who are like growing up on Roblox and Roblox will be more important to them

364
00:22:13,235 --> 00:22:16,925
Speaker 4:  than what phone they use. I don't know. But for right now, like it it does

365
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:19,605
Speaker 4:  seem like, yeah, like, like you're saying Lauren If, you go through the argument,

366
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,125
Speaker 4:  it's like, okay, if I can play cloud games, I all of a sudden realize, oh,

367
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:25,005
Speaker 4:  I can play cloud cloud games anywhere, I'm gonna switch phones.

368
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:28,615
Speaker 4:  I just, is that how that works? I don't know.

369
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:32,855
Speaker 5:  See this is where David, you're your gadget love

370
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:36,735
Speaker 5:  is, is shining through. Okay. And, and like Lauren, are you a giant

371
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:39,055
Speaker 5:  gadget nerd? It's okay if you're not,

372
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,895
Speaker 6:  I'm not the biggest gat nerd, but I like some gadgets. Okay,

373
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:45,455
Speaker 4:  Well that's Lauren Feiner everybody. I'm sorry you never be on the first

374
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:45,935
Speaker 4:  cast again.

375
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:48,735
Speaker 5:  No, but I think, I think this is a great moment for Lauren because David

376
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:52,735
Speaker 5:  and I we're gadget nerds. We know what the processor

377
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:55,655
Speaker 5:  is called in the iPhone and we care a lot about that and we care about that

378
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:58,495
Speaker 5:  speed and we care about that performance and the stuff outside of the apps.

379
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,615
Speaker 5:  Lauren, if If, you didn't have to like If, you could just get the cheapest

380
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,255
Speaker 5:  phone and would do all the stuff you needed it to do because it was all based

381
00:23:05,255 --> 00:23:08,615
Speaker 5:  in the cloud. Would you save, would you not spend

382
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:10,095
Speaker 5:  $1,600 on a new phone?

383
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:11,375
Speaker 6:  Probably.

384
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:16,215
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And a lot of people are that way and not like us and probably

385
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:19,655
Speaker 5:  most of our listeners are probably like Lauren. How dare you And guys I know,

386
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:22,575
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry. There's a lot, there's a lot of people around you who are just

387
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:25,975
Speaker 5:  like Lauren, many of your friends and family are probably like Lauren.

388
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:30,065
Speaker 5:  It's hard to understand. I'm, I'm working to process it as well. Please

389
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:33,985
Speaker 4:  Send all gadget recommendations to Lauren dot he@thebirch.com. She'd love

390
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:36,985
Speaker 4:  to hear from you. The more expensive, the better. No, I think, I think you're

391
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:40,185
Speaker 4:  right as a whole, yeah, right. Like on that theory, like I think about this

392
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:44,025
Speaker 4:  with like Chrome os, right? What Chrome OS proved is that

393
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:48,005
Speaker 4:  most people want the cheapest thing that kind of works. And this

394
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:50,605
Speaker 4:  has become a huge problem for Google because they can't sell you good things

395
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:53,365
Speaker 4:  that make money because all anybody wants is the cheapest thing that kind

396
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,285
Speaker 4:  of works. Yep. I think that's also true to an extent with a

397
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:00,685
Speaker 4:  lot of smart phones. And I think, I mean it, it's, it's surely not an accident

398
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:04,605
Speaker 4:  that Apple has not sold $400 phones because I think a lot of people would

399
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:08,085
Speaker 4:  buy them and that's actually pretty bad for business if you're Apple, right?

400
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:08,605
Speaker 4:  Like that's

401
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:11,045
Speaker 5:  You have a 30% markup on a phone. Yeah.

402
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:15,085
Speaker 4:  Granted, I'm just saying I don't think games are that thing. I think the

403
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:18,285
Speaker 4:  idea if I could have an exact, like an equivalent smartphone experience,

404
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:22,445
Speaker 4:  and to be fair, I think like if, again, a lot of this argument from

405
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:26,405
Speaker 4:  the DOJ adds up to what you're saying, like, I should be able to have an

406
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:29,805
Speaker 4:  equivalent smartphone experience anywhere and Apple is preventing me from

407
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:33,325
Speaker 4:  that. And if I could, a lot of people would leave the iPhone. I think that's

408
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:36,685
Speaker 4:  true and I think it's, it's gonna be really interesting to see to what extent

409
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,885
Speaker 4:  we actually get to see that bear out. Yeah. I'm just saying I don't think

410
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:40,725
Speaker 4:  games are that thing.

411
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:45,045
Speaker 5:  I would agree with that. Totally. And I say that as a gamer who used

412
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:48,245
Speaker 5:  every single one of those cloudy gaming services. Did you know Luna? Still

413
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:49,165
Speaker 5:  around? Oh,

414
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:49,565
Speaker 4:  Luna.

415
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:51,925
Speaker 5:  I remember Luna. Yeah. I

416
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:55,325
Speaker 4:  Is better at having products you forgot about but are still just kicking

417
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,485
Speaker 4:  than Amazon. Yeah, Google

418
00:24:56,615 --> 00:25:00,605
Speaker 5:  Kills them. And the ones you like, Amazon leaves the ones you've never heard

419
00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:01,085
Speaker 5:  of Alive for

420
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:04,405
Speaker 4:  20. Yeah. Amazon just puts it like further down in the menu system on amazon.com

421
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:07,445
Speaker 4:  and that's, that's all that happens to them. All right, we should go to the

422
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:10,645
Speaker 4:  next one, which is messaging apps. Lauren, do you wanna explain this one?

423
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:13,565
Speaker 4:  This one feels like the most like mainstream

424
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:17,245
Speaker 4:  relevant of the five. Do you wanna explain what's going on here? Totally,

425
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:21,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This is one that I think everyone is gonna be like, oh yeah, I've been

426
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:24,965
Speaker 6:  complaining about this for years. Which is that, you know,

427
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:29,125
Speaker 6:  it's basically the green bubble problem that when you are

428
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:33,005
Speaker 6:  messaging someone from an iPhone to an Android, you're seeing a

429
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:36,965
Speaker 6:  green bubble on your screen instead of blue. And so

430
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:40,205
Speaker 6:  basically the DOJ is saying like, this is very intentional

431
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:44,605
Speaker 6:  and this is really just another way to lock users

432
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:47,525
Speaker 6:  into the iPhone iOS ecosystem.

433
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:51,685
Speaker 6:  and that it's not just that it's like annoying, it's also that

434
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:55,965
Speaker 6:  there's just worse functionality when you're doing these, this

435
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:59,765
Speaker 6:  messaging between iPhone and Android. And they even

436
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,005
Speaker 6:  reference Tim Cook's comment of Buy your Mom

437
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:07,445
Speaker 6:  an iPhone where he told someone, you know,

438
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,285
Speaker 6:  oh, someone was complaining at a conference that,

439
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:15,765
Speaker 6:  you know, his mom, when he's texting with his mom, he

440
00:26:15,765 --> 00:26:19,685
Speaker 6:  is getting green texts and they said, he just said, buy your mom

441
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:22,405
Speaker 6:  an iPhone. That was the, that was the solution.

442
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:26,645
Speaker 4:  My hottest take about all of this is that I think that sentence is

443
00:26:26,645 --> 00:26:29,405
Speaker 4:  going to come back to haunt Tim Cook. Like I, I think that sentence will

444
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:32,045
Speaker 4:  haunt Tim Cook maybe for the rest of his career.

445
00:26:32,805 --> 00:26:36,725
Speaker 5:  I like when that happened when we, because it was at code 2022

446
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:40,645
Speaker 5:  and it was Tim Cook, it was Joni Ives, it was Lauren Powell

447
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:43,750
Speaker 5:  jobs. They were all hanging out with Kara Swisher was, was her last one.

448
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:48,005
Speaker 5:  And, and this guy gets up and is like, I can't text my mom. And

449
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:51,445
Speaker 5:  just, there's like a level of almost, I think we, we talked about it on the

450
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:55,325
Speaker 5:  show after that. He came off a little smug and

451
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,725
Speaker 5:  yeah, the DOJ noticed.

452
00:26:57,645 --> 00:27:00,245
Speaker 4:  I mean, it was a funny line at the time. It was very funny. Like, I think

453
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:02,965
Speaker 4:  it it, but it was like Ooh, it played very well in the room if I remember

454
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:06,885
Speaker 4:  correctly. But I think like the, I I was rereading

455
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:10,125
Speaker 4:  a bunch of stuff from the Microsoft antitrust trial from whatever, 25 years

456
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,965
Speaker 4:  ago. And there was this thing that a Microsoft executive said, I think in

457
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,725
Speaker 4:  an email, I could be wrong, but very early on, said something to the effect

458
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:20,565
Speaker 4:  of we have to cut off Netscapes air supply. and that

459
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:24,525
Speaker 4:  phrase became like the mantra of the case that

460
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:28,965
Speaker 4:  Microsoft is this nefarious company out to destroy anyone who would possibly

461
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:32,845
Speaker 4:  compete with it and is just going to squeeze everyone to death, I think

462
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:36,245
Speaker 4:  by your mom and iPhone is going to do that. Not

463
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:37,285
Speaker 5:  Barbarians at the gate.

464
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:41,445
Speaker 4:  No, that's like slightly too esoteric, I think, which is, it's like a cool

465
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:44,485
Speaker 4:  line. We should, I, I, I wrote that line down, we should read it. But

466
00:27:45,355 --> 00:27:48,685
Speaker 5:  That, that line came when they were talking about the super apps and apparently

467
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:52,285
Speaker 5:  an Apple exec was like, we can't let the super apps in the United States

468
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:54,365
Speaker 5:  and onto our platforms. It would be like the barbarian.

469
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:58,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So this is from the, the complaint. It says as, as one apple manager

470
00:27:58,465 --> 00:28:01,645
Speaker 4:  put it, allowing super apps to become the main gateway where people play

471
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:05,445
Speaker 4:  games, book a car, make payments, et cetera, would quote let the barbarians

472
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:09,365
Speaker 4:  in at the gate. Why? Because when a super app offers popular mini programs,

473
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:13,535
Speaker 4:  iOS stickiness goes down like lesson number one, everybody

474
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:16,255
Speaker 4:  don't send emails. But anyway,

475
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:17,655
Speaker 5:  That's the first lesson.

476
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:20,655
Speaker 4:  Just send emails to Lauren dot Feiner at the virgin.com with all of your

477
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:21,455
Speaker 4:  gadget recommendations.

478
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:22,455
Speaker 5:  Only emails allowed.

479
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:26,735
Speaker 4:  But no, I I think the messaging apps one I thought was

480
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,535
Speaker 4:  both, again, like you're saying Lauren the most sort of understandable to

481
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:34,375
Speaker 4:  the most people, but also maybe the most compelling if

482
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:37,615
Speaker 4:  your argument is that Apple is willfully making its products worse to make

483
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,895
Speaker 4:  it harder to leave. Like we talked about Beeper a ton on this show earlier

484
00:28:40,895 --> 00:28:42,815
Speaker 4:  this year, right. And the case Beeper, so

485
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:43,455
Speaker 5:  Did the DOJ.

486
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:46,175
Speaker 4:  So did the DOJ. Yeah, it was, it was in the complaint, like there were a

487
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:49,935
Speaker 4:  few companies that were very clearly being talked about but didn't get named.

488
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:53,455
Speaker 4:  Beeper was one of them. There's a section about, you know, a company promising

489
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:57,215
Speaker 4:  to make the security of the iPhone better for everybody. There was

490
00:28:57,215 --> 00:29:01,135
Speaker 4:  also one about like a company that canceled a smartwatch and it's just like

491
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:04,975
Speaker 4:  obviously Meta. But anyway, the, the Beeper

492
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:08,015
Speaker 4:  story was essentially they went around all of Apple's

493
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:11,775
Speaker 4:  systems in order to make your green bubbles blue. Even If you, you're on

494
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:14,615
Speaker 4:  an Android phone, apple said no, it was the whole thing. Everybody listening

495
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:18,295
Speaker 4:  to the show I'm sure knows, but what Bieber kept saying

496
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:22,695
Speaker 4:  is we are making text messaging more secure for

497
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:26,535
Speaker 4:  iPhone users because now instead of using SMS, which is

498
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:30,055
Speaker 4:  awful technology, bad user experience and fundamentally

499
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:33,575
Speaker 4:  insecure all of those things, undeniably true. Like if you've ever sent a

500
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:37,535
Speaker 4:  video over SMS, it sucks and it should not be allowed. and

501
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,935
Speaker 4:  that was the case they kept making and Apple basically shut it off because,

502
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,245
Speaker 4:  because they're like, well we're Apple, we can, and so the DOJ is coming

503
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:48,205
Speaker 4:  and saying, no, the fact that you are willingly and obviously

504
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:52,165
Speaker 4:  making your product worse, not just for other people but for your users

505
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:56,725
Speaker 4:  is pretty strong proof that you are not just doing

506
00:29:56,725 --> 00:30:00,605
Speaker 4:  things with your customers in mind. Yeah. That If you were, what you

507
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:04,485
Speaker 4:  would've given them is either access to more messaging

508
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:08,165
Speaker 4:  tools and competition and let other apps like WhatsApp and whoever else

509
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,925
Speaker 4:  access SMS, which is one of the things that this argues should be allowed

510
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:14,885
Speaker 4:  or you have to actually give your

511
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:18,685
Speaker 4:  customers the best product available to them. And they have, I mean there's

512
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:22,645
Speaker 4:  like this, the famous email from Tim Cook now shooting down the idea of putting

513
00:30:22,645 --> 00:30:25,965
Speaker 4:  iMessage on Android because the, his argument was that it would be worse

514
00:30:25,985 --> 00:30:29,005
Speaker 4:  for Apple than it would be good to, you know, have this platform set, which

515
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:32,925
Speaker 4:  is again, like you just cannot make the argument that that is good for users.

516
00:30:33,185 --> 00:30:37,165
Speaker 4:  You just can't. So you come back from it and say this is purely

517
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:39,645
Speaker 4:  monopoly maintenance to use their term.

518
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:44,845
Speaker 4:  I think this is going to end up being the one we talk about a lot in the

519
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,045
Speaker 4:  course of this trial. Personally.

520
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:49,885
Speaker 5:  I I, yeah, it's the most indefensible, apple has never been able to

521
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:53,245
Speaker 5:  adequately defend this and they try all the time, right? And every single

522
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:56,885
Speaker 5:  time, no, I don't think anyone believes them. I, I

523
00:30:57,075 --> 00:31:00,285
Speaker 5:  like, I would struggle to think of someone who's like, yeah, apple has totally

524
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:04,325
Speaker 5:  got it right? I am totally fine with garbage green bubbles and if

525
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:06,245
Speaker 5:  I don't like it, I can go use WhatsApp. Well,

526
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:09,805
Speaker 4:  The argument against it is that Apple doesn't have to, right? Like it's Apple's

527
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:12,525
Speaker 4:  platform. Apple can do what it wants. And, and the, and this is like what

528
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:15,005
Speaker 4:  the DOJ is saying is though, like, no, actually that's not how this works

529
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:19,005
Speaker 4:  and we're gonna prove it in court. And I assume all of apple's

530
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:21,845
Speaker 4:  extremely well-paid lawyers are like, bring it on.

531
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:25,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. The people really winning in this case are, are the lawyers.

532
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:26,725
Speaker 4:  Oh, as

533
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:28,365
Speaker 5:  Always. A lot of billable hours as their

534
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,525
Speaker 4:  Way as always. It's gonna be great. Alright, let's blow through these last

535
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:34,285
Speaker 4:  two and then we, we need to take a break because this is going to be a

536
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:38,285
Speaker 4:  19 hour long forecast. Alex, you wanna explain the smartwatches one? That's

537
00:31:38,285 --> 00:31:38,725
Speaker 4:  the next one, Luis.

538
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:40,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Smartwatches. This

539
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:43,245
Speaker 4:  One feels easy actually. This one is very easy in terms of like what the

540
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,045
Speaker 4:  problem is. Yeah.

541
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:47,245
Speaker 5:  The, the, the problem is If, you wanna have a good smartwatch experience

542
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:50,565
Speaker 5:  on iOS, you have to have an Apple watch. There's nothing else,

543
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:53,725
Speaker 5:  nothing else competes and If, you want a good

544
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:58,125
Speaker 5:  smartwatch experience on Android, you would probably want an an

545
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,725
Speaker 5:  Apple watch because it is in fact the best smartwatch right now. And you

546
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:05,005
Speaker 5:  can't do that either because it's gonna be a garbage experience on Android.

547
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:06,165
Speaker 5:  And it's just that I thought you

548
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:09,125
Speaker 4:  Were about to say you'd found some way to hack a on Apple watch onto Android

549
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,685
Speaker 4:  and I was like, let's talk about that for a while.

550
00:32:10,925 --> 00:32:14,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no, that's, that's, that's sad. That's next episode. But, but yeah,

551
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:18,765
Speaker 5:  it, it is very straightforward. It's a crummy experience and

552
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:21,805
Speaker 5:  I would've loved if they'd also brought in Bluetooth headphones here because

553
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:23,365
Speaker 5:  I got a lot, lot of feelings.

554
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:25,525
Speaker 4:  So I mean did explicitly mentioned that Bluetooth is bad, which I very much

555
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:28,805
Speaker 4:  appreciated. That was, it was like, If, you wanna use a non-Apple smartwatch,

556
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:31,365
Speaker 4:  you have to use Bluetooth. And it's, and just sort of leaves unsaid that

557
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:32,285
Speaker 4:  like, well that's a real bummer,

558
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:36,325
Speaker 4:  but I, I appreciated that and it was, yeah, I mean it was little things that

559
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:40,005
Speaker 4:  they brought up, like quick responses to messages, which came up like

560
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:43,765
Speaker 4:  enough times in this complaint that I feel like someone at the DOJ has like

561
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,645
Speaker 4:  a personal issue with not being able to send quick response from

562
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:50,525
Speaker 5:  Someone. Someone was using a pixel watch with their iPhone and they are

563
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:51,005
Speaker 5:  pissed.

564
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:54,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah, right. Like there's some, some like deputy ag somewhere who's like,

565
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:58,645
Speaker 4:  I just wanna send my text messages, what hell Apple? Like, it was very strange.

566
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:02,605
Speaker 4:  But yeah, I mean that, that's essentially the crux of it, right? Lauren that

567
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:06,485
Speaker 4:  it's like If, you want a good Apple experience,

568
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,845
Speaker 4:  you have to buy an Apple watch, which again, once you bought an Apple Watch

569
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:11,925
Speaker 4:  brings you even further into the iPhone ecosystem,

570
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:15,765
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. It just goes back to Apple wanting you to

571
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:18,845
Speaker 6:  just use Apple products and making it just de

572
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:23,045
Speaker 6:  disincentivizing you, like mixing and matching

573
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:26,125
Speaker 6:  between Apple products and other products or just switching all together.

574
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:30,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Which is I think a very funny way of looking

575
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:33,925
Speaker 4:  at exactly the same thing that Apple has always said, right? Like

576
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:38,525
Speaker 4:  Apple on its face shouldn't disagree with any of this,

577
00:33:38,535 --> 00:33:42,165
Speaker 4:  right? Like for Apple to say like, oh yeah, the Apple watch is better If,

578
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:44,845
Speaker 4:  you also have an iPhone. Like Apple's been making commercials about that

579
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:48,805
Speaker 4:  for decades. That's the whole pitch is that like we integrate

580
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,245
Speaker 4:  the hardware to the software and the services so that it's better apple's.

581
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:55,125
Speaker 4:  Like yeah, that's the point. And now the DOJ is saying, you know,

582
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:59,245
Speaker 4:  actually what you're doing is you're not making it better when those things

583
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,205
Speaker 4:  are together, you're just making everything else worse. And again, this is

584
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:06,185
Speaker 4:  where I come back to like, I'm not a lawyer, so don't take any of this

585
00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:10,705
Speaker 4:  seriously, but I, it seems to me that that is a much harder

586
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:15,665
Speaker 4:  like argument to pull and a like a string to pull on over the course

587
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:16,065
Speaker 4:  of a trial.

588
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,225
Speaker 5:  I mean, it's just a, it's a, it's a major philosophical difference and it,

589
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,585
Speaker 5:  I it sounds like, I mean, Lauren correct me if I'm wrong, but this is gonna

590
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:25,345
Speaker 5:  be down to the judge to decide like who's right because both are right. And,

591
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:28,545
Speaker 5:  and in the cases of vertical integration, vertical integration always makes

592
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:31,505
Speaker 5:  things much more smooth and, and, and, and

593
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:36,265
Speaker 5:  seamless. It also makes things much more difficult. If you wanna change and,

594
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:38,705
Speaker 5:  and we can see that in the healthcare industry. We can see it in a lot of

595
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:42,225
Speaker 5:  industries where they say, yeah, we vertically integrated everything. And

596
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:46,525
Speaker 5:  repeatedly they've been like, actually you ver you did too much.

597
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:49,765
Speaker 5:  There's like, there's some, and, and we don't know what that line is, but

598
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:53,005
Speaker 5:  it feels like the courts eventually find it. Is that right? Lauren?

599
00:34:53,435 --> 00:34:56,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's basically right. I mean, I think the judge is gonna have to

600
00:34:56,165 --> 00:35:00,085
Speaker 6:  weigh like, was there a legitimate business reason that Apple did these things?

601
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:01,605
Speaker 6:  Or you know,

602
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:07,645
Speaker 6:  or like, is the effect of these things taken

603
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:11,005
Speaker 6:  together because of its dominant position in the market?

604
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:16,125
Speaker 6:  Is it too much? And you know, does it fall into the category of

605
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:19,285
Speaker 6:  becoming a legal monopolistic behavior?

606
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,525
Speaker 5:  And that's kind of the key difference here, between like

607
00:35:23,145 --> 00:35:26,805
Speaker 5:  2000 when you could only use an iPod on an Apple

608
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:30,685
Speaker 5:  device. That was because it was fine then because Apple didn't have

609
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:34,805
Speaker 5:  a huge section of the market for laptops. It didn't have

610
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:38,925
Speaker 5:  a huge section of any markets really. And so it was like, okay, cool, you're,

611
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:42,085
Speaker 5:  you're, you're making new things, you're innovating and now the difference

612
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:45,245
Speaker 5:  is that now Apple is huge. Is that right?

613
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:49,765
Speaker 6:  That's exactly right. And that's why you see Apple saying

614
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:53,085
Speaker 6:  that they don't think that the US smartphone market is the relevant market.

615
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:57,205
Speaker 6:  It's really the global smartphone market. And that's really like the

616
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:01,165
Speaker 6:  go-to response in pretty much ev any monopoly

617
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:04,405
Speaker 6:  lawsuit is to say like, this is the wrong market. Look at this much bigger

618
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:06,445
Speaker 6:  market where we're just like a speck on the map.

619
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:10,365
Speaker 4:  Does Apple know that the United States Department of Justice is not like

620
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:14,045
Speaker 4:  a global organization? Is that No, I believe

621
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:15,605
Speaker 6:  They're probably aware. Okay,

622
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:18,885
Speaker 4:  Cool. Just checking in case you're not, Tim, I know you're listening. Just

623
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:21,965
Speaker 4:  Ffy. I that's how that works. All right, one more and then we should take

624
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:24,845
Speaker 4:  a break. Alex you, you explained this one because you've been sitting at

625
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:28,205
Speaker 4:  your desk just like muttering about banks all day. Yeah. So explain the digital

626
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:29,085
Speaker 4:  wallets one. This

627
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:33,005
Speaker 5:  One Lauren agree. Like, correct me if I'm wrong, this one was the most surprising

628
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:36,285
Speaker 5:  one for me. That, that it popped up here and then the more I read about it

629
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:40,165
Speaker 5:  I was like, oh, someone at the banks was in the, the Attorney

630
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,245
Speaker 5:  General's ear being like,

631
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:44,285
Speaker 4:  Do either of you ever spend any time thinking about your digital wallet?

632
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:47,765
Speaker 4:  No. Like I feel like on the list of like things I care about on my phone,

633
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:49,725
Speaker 4:  I would rank digital wallets so low.

634
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:54,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, and I I I would chase feel that way or

635
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:58,165
Speaker 5:  some of the other large banks, I don't know. I I think they feel

636
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:02,005
Speaker 5:  differently. And, and, and that's what that was like

637
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:04,485
Speaker 5:  me reading between the lines on this part of the complaint and the complaint

638
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:07,805
Speaker 5:  is that digital wallets, you can really can't use any other digital wallet

639
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,725
Speaker 5:  on Apple devices because of how the NFC chip works and how their

640
00:37:11,915 --> 00:37:15,885
Speaker 5:  APIs work. Nothing else works on it. So you have to partner

641
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:19,285
Speaker 5:  with Apple, you have to pay their fees, If, you wanna do transaction,

642
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:23,085
Speaker 5:  you, you basically have to engage with them in a, in the same way that you

643
00:37:23,085 --> 00:37:26,405
Speaker 5:  have to engage with the app store. And crucially you have

644
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:30,605
Speaker 5:  share data that you might not otherwise share. Both the consumer and the

645
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:34,205
Speaker 5:  banks have to share data that they wouldn't normally share with Apple in

646
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:35,165
Speaker 5:  order to make all of this work.

647
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,085
Speaker 4:  Well, because Apple's sitting there in the middle.

648
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:40,725
Speaker 5:  Right? Right. And, and so the DOJ is basically saying Apple has inserted

649
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,885
Speaker 5:  itself into this process and is refusing to allow anybody else to do that

650
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:45,325
Speaker 5:  and that is wrong. And

651
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:51,005
Speaker 5:  like, I was like, oh, that's, that's, I never thought about that, but yeah,

652
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:54,005
Speaker 5:  that's 'cause I don't think about my digital wallet because I'm not Chase

653
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,285
Speaker 5:  bank, right? So, so, and then I look, I was like, yeah, that, that actually

654
00:37:57,285 --> 00:38:00,385
Speaker 5:  makes sense and is probably not great. Well,

655
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:04,185
Speaker 4:  And this is like, I, the only thing I can think is that every

656
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:08,345
Speaker 4:  FinTech company has been in the DOJs ear over the last year

657
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:12,265
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Talking to 'em about this because part of the point that they're making

658
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:15,305
Speaker 4:  is that you don't think about your digital wallet because your digital wallet

659
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:18,705
Speaker 4:  sucks because no one else is allowed to compete with Apple, right? Yeah.

660
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:22,385
Speaker 4:  That if you're If you wanna build some kind of payment

661
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:25,505
Speaker 4:  product on the iPhone, you are required to integrate it with the Apple Wallet

662
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:29,385
Speaker 4:  app. You can't use tap to pay, you're just hamstrung in all of these ways

663
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:32,425
Speaker 4:  that actually go out of their way to promote Apple Wallet specifically. Yep.

664
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:35,105
Speaker 4:  So If, you wanted to do something like, and it actually mentioned digital

665
00:38:35,345 --> 00:38:38,885
Speaker 4:  Car keys as a version of this that has been kind of under innovated as a

666
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:41,205
Speaker 4:  result because there's no good way to do it.

667
00:38:41,345 --> 00:38:43,965
Speaker 5:  And they specifically said they had a bunch of examples, they didn't name

668
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:47,045
Speaker 5:  names, but they had a bunch of examples of where like app developers and

669
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:50,925
Speaker 5:  banks and in car companies would just had to give up on developing

670
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:54,805
Speaker 5:  certain applications and c certain features because it wouldn't work with

671
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:58,725
Speaker 5:  iOS because Apple wouldn't allow it to use the parts of the phone that it

672
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:01,485
Speaker 5:  would need to make it all work. And like Ooh,

673
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:06,245
Speaker 5:  that's not a great look for Apple. That's a really bad look.

674
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:10,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. You just think of it, and this one feels like probably

675
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:14,085
Speaker 5:  one of the biggest slam dunks, but also the least

676
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:18,005
Speaker 5:  interesting one for 99.9% of people who don't work at Chase Bank.

677
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:22,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This one has the fewest sort of sympathetic victims. Yeah.

678
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:26,285
Speaker 4:  It's like, oh no, poor Goldman Sachs can't do what it wants on the iPhone.

679
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:28,005
Speaker 4:  That sounds awesome. Aw.

680
00:39:29,025 --> 00:39:31,965
Speaker 5:  And they, they try to make it about the consumer by saying, you know, you

681
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:34,205
Speaker 5:  have to share this data, you have to share stuff that you wouldn't normally

682
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,075
Speaker 5:  share. And and that's also true and, and not great. And I,

683
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:40,795
Speaker 5:  I loved just, I know we're, we're, we're gonna take a break here in a second,

684
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:43,715
Speaker 5:  but I did love, there was this through line throughout the thing that was

685
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,675
Speaker 5:  like, you know what? Everything Apple says about privacy and security is

686
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:50,795
Speaker 5:  absolute bullshit. And every single time they are,

687
00:39:50,945 --> 00:39:54,835
Speaker 5:  they are making the privacy and security worse by, by doing

688
00:39:54,835 --> 00:39:58,475
Speaker 5:  this. and that I'm not entirely sure of, right? Because the digital

689
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:01,595
Speaker 5:  wallet, a big part of that is they've got the secure enclave on the device

690
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:05,555
Speaker 5:  and they don't want anybody else interacting with that. and that from a security

691
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:08,715
Speaker 5:  standpoint, that makes sense. Like Apple's argument there makes sense, but

692
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:09,275
Speaker 5:  at the same time,

693
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:15,205
Speaker 5:  green Bubbles, there's all these other places where they have made it less

694
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:15,485
Speaker 5:  secure.

695
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:19,205
Speaker 4:  Right? Even I, and I think this is part of what the DOJ is trying to do,

696
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:22,445
Speaker 4:  is that say even if individually these things are

697
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:26,725
Speaker 4:  sort of gross but not illegal, put them all together and it

698
00:40:26,755 --> 00:40:30,725
Speaker 4:  adds up to something bigger. And they had a bunch of other ones that there's

699
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:33,365
Speaker 4:  like a list at the end of just like all the other crappy things Apple has

700
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:36,365
Speaker 4:  ever done, which I thought was very funny. And it names, let's see, it names

701
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,845
Speaker 4:  FaceTime, third party, iOS web browsers,

702
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:44,725
Speaker 4:  eims Cloud Storage, iCloud sales

703
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:48,605
Speaker 4:  Channels, and Siri, which is my favorite. They

704
00:40:48,605 --> 00:40:49,645
Speaker 5:  Don't basically,

705
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:53,525
Speaker 4:  Basically like Siri sucks and it's Apple's fault and it's illegal. And I

706
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:56,325
Speaker 4:  think it's, I think it should be illegal for Siri to be as bad as it is.

707
00:40:56,545 --> 00:41:00,125
Speaker 4:  So I'm in full support of that. Lauren, before we let you go,

708
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:03,565
Speaker 4:  you've, you've been talking to folks all day, there was a DOJ

709
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:06,605
Speaker 4:  briefing right after this went out. There was an Apple briefing right after

710
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:10,165
Speaker 4:  this went out. What's the, what are the vibes like in the hours after this

711
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:11,405
Speaker 4:  comes out? What are you hearing? Yeah.

712
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:14,845
Speaker 6:  Well, I, I haven't gotten a chance to catch up with too many people yet,

713
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:18,885
Speaker 6:  but, you know, coming out of the briefing and you know, just seeing

714
00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:22,725
Speaker 6:  what's out there right now, I think, you know, developers that have been

715
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,885
Speaker 6:  complaining about this for a while are really excited.

716
00:41:26,675 --> 00:41:29,645
Speaker 6:  They're happy to see the US finally take on Apple

717
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:31,685
Speaker 6:  in this really big way.

718
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:35,325
Speaker 4:  Is this big enough for those people? Like are they, are they, I feel like

719
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:39,165
Speaker 4:  a lot of times folks get mad and they yell and they want big action

720
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:42,365
Speaker 4:  and then they get small action and they get frustrated. But the little bit

721
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:46,005
Speaker 4:  that I've heard is folks saying like, this is the big swing we've been waiting

722
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,725
Speaker 4:  for. Is that what you're hearing too? I think it's

723
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:51,245
Speaker 6:  A pretty big case. you know, I think everyone

724
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:55,085
Speaker 6:  is gonna want to see like their, their little piece of the

725
00:41:55,285 --> 00:41:58,445
Speaker 6:  complaint that they've had for years in this. But I think it's a, it's a

726
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:02,365
Speaker 6:  pretty sweeping complaint. So I think that a lot of

727
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:05,725
Speaker 6:  developers will be happy to see this And Welcome it. I think,

728
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:09,485
Speaker 6:  you know, the problem with cases like this and you know, every

729
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:13,685
Speaker 6:  antitrust case in the US is that it takes a long time to see

730
00:42:13,685 --> 00:42:17,205
Speaker 6:  them play out. So, you know, I I think it's gonna be

731
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:21,045
Speaker 6:  maybe a little bit disappointing to people who have wanted to see action

732
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:24,245
Speaker 6:  for a really long time to see that, you know, it's gonna take a while.

733
00:42:24,985 --> 00:42:28,325
Speaker 6:  you know, the DOJ filed its first Google lawsuit

734
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:33,445
Speaker 6:  back in 2020. It went to trial in 2023. So this is

735
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:34,965
Speaker 6:  gonna take a long time to resolve.

736
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:38,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All right. Before we let you go here and we go take a break, I'm gonna

737
00:42:38,565 --> 00:42:42,485
Speaker 4:  put the over under at 2030. Is this resolved before or

738
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:44,525
Speaker 4:  after? Are we going over or are we under, do

739
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:48,285
Speaker 6:  We mean like past, like exhausting the Supreme Court

740
00:42:48,285 --> 00:42:49,045
Speaker 6:  option and

741
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:52,685
Speaker 4:  Everything over? We, the, the last pieces of paperwork have been filed,

742
00:42:53,285 --> 00:42:54,845
Speaker 4:  whatever that turns out to mean 2030,

743
00:42:57,245 --> 00:43:00,365
Speaker 6:  I think over, but it might be close.

744
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:04,405
Speaker 4:  Okay. Okay. That's good. So, I've set the odds correctly. This is, this is

745
00:43:04,405 --> 00:43:07,645
Speaker 4:  good. I feel good about it. Alright. Alright, we gotta take a break. Lauren,

746
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:11,445
Speaker 4:  thank you so much. We're gonna come back and just talk more about this.

747
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:12,125
Speaker 4:  We'll

748
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:38,665
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back and we have a guest, our good friend

749
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:43,105
Speaker 4:  Vacation NELI. What up? Who is a whole other guy than

750
00:46:43,105 --> 00:46:44,785
Speaker 4:  normal NELI? How you doing buddy?

751
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:48,465
Speaker 8:  I'm good. I haven't been on vacation like this since 2019 and of course,

752
00:46:49,045 --> 00:46:52,945
Speaker 8:  of course the DOJ suited Apple for being in Monopoly while I was in

753
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:53,745
Speaker 8:  the air to Mexico.

754
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:57,625
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there was no chance something was, everything was just gonna be chill

755
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:01,545
Speaker 4:  for a week while you were gone. Just no chance. Yeah, I assume we're gonna

756
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:04,945
Speaker 4:  do like four or five emergency forecasts over the next eight days or so.

757
00:47:04,945 --> 00:47:05,825
Speaker 4:  It's gonna be great. Yeah,

758
00:47:05,885 --> 00:47:09,545
Speaker 8:  Tim Cook is gonna overthrow the government. Brooklyn, here's Max. Max is

759
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:12,225
Speaker 8:  just running around. Hey Max, come say hi to the, there she

760
00:47:12,225 --> 00:47:14,625
Speaker 4:  Goes. Yeah, perfect. That's, that's, that's the energy we're looking for

761
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:18,425
Speaker 4:  for Max. So we just talked with Lauren, we went through kind of the, the

762
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:21,625
Speaker 4:  bones of the complaint. We talked about like the five big sections of what's

763
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:25,465
Speaker 4:  going on. And, honestly, I'm just curious for,

764
00:47:25,605 --> 00:47:29,405
Speaker 4:  for NELI vibes, we have a lot of like legal thinking questions about

765
00:47:29,405 --> 00:47:33,365
Speaker 4:  how this case differs and is similar to some of the old cases we've

766
00:47:33,365 --> 00:47:36,405
Speaker 4:  seen, especially the Microsoft one from, you know, 25 years ago. But

767
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,165
Speaker 4:  I'm sure you read the complaint on the plane, like all cool vacation people.

768
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:42,405
Speaker 4:  What do you make of it? Where's your head so far?

769
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:46,605
Speaker 8:  So I, you know, I interviewed Jonathan Canter on Decoder a few weeks

770
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:50,405
Speaker 8:  ago and I asked him about this case and he was very pagey

771
00:47:50,405 --> 00:47:53,925
Speaker 8:  about then my impression of this whole

772
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,325
Speaker 8:  Jonathan Andrew is the assisting attorney general for antitrust in Pharmac

773
00:47:57,325 --> 00:47:58,485
Speaker 8:  Justice. He was on

774
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:04,045
Speaker 8:  my read on it, is that they are explicitly

775
00:48:04,545 --> 00:48:07,845
Speaker 8:  trying to link Apple to Microsoft in the nineties, right? They're trying

776
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:11,405
Speaker 8:  to say there was a big bad in the nineties, there was Microsoft. Microsoft

777
00:48:11,415 --> 00:48:15,365
Speaker 8:  tried to kill Netscape and tried to kill Java and we stopped them from

778
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:19,165
Speaker 8:  doing that. and that is what let a bunch of other innovative companies

779
00:48:19,305 --> 00:48:19,685
Speaker 8:  do. All

780
00:48:19,795 --> 00:48:20,645
Speaker 4:  Including Apple.

781
00:48:21,035 --> 00:48:24,805
Speaker 8:  Including specifically including Apple. Yeah, right. Microsoft

782
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:29,045
Speaker 8:  tried to kill QuickTime on Windows. They, they, they basically nerfed it.

783
00:48:29,845 --> 00:48:33,005
Speaker 8:  Microsoft probably didn't wanna let iTunes be a first class application on

784
00:48:33,005 --> 00:48:36,965
Speaker 8:  Windows and letting 'em do that is what let the iPod tick off, right? When

785
00:48:36,965 --> 00:48:39,725
Speaker 8:  they finally were bring the iPod windows. So they're, they're making that

786
00:48:40,135 --> 00:48:43,725
Speaker 8:  comparison very explicitly in the complaints. But then also I think just

787
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:47,685
Speaker 8:  from like a vibes perspective, the attitude of

788
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:51,605
Speaker 8:  the DOJ is, okay, well Microsoft

789
00:48:51,705 --> 00:48:55,685
Speaker 8:  itself was built on IBM compatibility, right?

790
00:48:55,795 --> 00:48:59,565
Speaker 8:  Like there was an IBM platform that allowed Microsoft to go on popular

791
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:04,365
Speaker 8:  Microsoft. We stopped Microsoft from being the big, big bad that allowed

792
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:07,645
Speaker 8:  Apple Resurgents guests. but it also created the opportunity for Google to

793
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,245
Speaker 8:  exist because Google is a browser company. The application

794
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:15,325
Speaker 8:  layer moved from Wintel to the web because of the web

795
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:18,685
Speaker 8:  and that allowed Google to this. And then they even go so far as to, you

796
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:22,245
Speaker 8:  know, when you, when you hear them make the argument, you're like, and then

797
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:26,035
Speaker 8:  Amazon was built on top of Google, which is Yeah,

798
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:27,795
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's a theory.

799
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,995
Speaker 8:  Sure. But the idea that people were searching for products and they landed

800
00:49:30,995 --> 00:49:33,555
Speaker 8:  on Amazon and Amazon became the best retailer 'cause had the most selection.

801
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:37,995
Speaker 8:  Their point is the natural evolution of technology is for one

802
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:41,755
Speaker 8:  platform to provide a boost to the next one

803
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:46,015
Speaker 8:  and for people to move sort of like higher and higher up levels of

804
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:49,855
Speaker 8:  extraction. And what Apple has done is they basically forbidden that

805
00:49:49,855 --> 00:49:53,015
Speaker 8:  from happening. So If you think like they keep talking about super apps in

806
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:56,935
Speaker 8:  the complaint, the comparison that they, they make, I

807
00:49:56,935 --> 00:50:00,535
Speaker 8:  think they were gonna make it more loudly. In the Windows case

808
00:50:00,725 --> 00:50:04,615
Speaker 8:  they called it middleware, which is a deeply funny word. And I think they

809
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,855
Speaker 8:  were gonna try to use that word again. It's still in this complaint a little

810
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:08,295
Speaker 8:  bit. But the idea is like

811
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:12,935
Speaker 8:  Java was middleware on Windows. So you don't have to write to Windows, you

812
00:50:12,935 --> 00:50:15,895
Speaker 8:  can write to Java and you could deploy an app anywhere. You don't have to

813
00:50:15,975 --> 00:50:19,965
Speaker 8:  write to Windows, you can write to the web and you can deploy anywhere. Flash

814
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:22,605
Speaker 8:  is a type of middleware, which the people are gonna have a lot of feelings

815
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:26,325
Speaker 8:  on. But Apple is basically forbidden. All of these things

816
00:50:26,715 --> 00:50:29,605
Speaker 8:  from being actual competitors to running natively on the phone.

817
00:50:30,545 --> 00:50:33,725
Speaker 8:  So like web apps, they're not a good competitor for real apps on the phone

818
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:35,685
Speaker 8:  even that they were intended to be in the beginning. If you remember which

819
00:50:35,685 --> 00:50:36,005
Speaker 8:  Steve Jobs.

820
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:37,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

821
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:41,805
Speaker 8:  And I, I think people have a lot of feelings about that, like on both sides,

822
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:45,605
Speaker 8:  right? And I think they went away from like web apps and middleware,

823
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:49,485
Speaker 8:  the super apps and here's my hottest take. I think they're talking about

824
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:53,405
Speaker 8:  super apps so much 'cause they know Elon Musk wants X to be a

825
00:50:53,405 --> 00:50:57,205
Speaker 8:  super app. And so if they get Elon Musk to say Apple's the monopoly,

826
00:50:57,205 --> 00:50:58,125
Speaker 8:  like that's good for them.

827
00:50:58,705 --> 00:50:59,045
Speaker 4:  Is it?

828
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:03,085
Speaker 8:  That's just like, that's too pin lines man. That's, that's just me staring

829
00:51:03,085 --> 00:51:07,045
Speaker 8:  at the ocean and being like, why do you wanna keep talking about super

830
00:51:07,045 --> 00:51:08,805
Speaker 8:  apps? It's to get Elon to tweet about it.

831
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,805
Speaker 4:  I love the political theory that getting Elon on your side is, is the

832
00:51:12,905 --> 00:51:15,405
Speaker 4:  surest way to winning in the courts right now?

833
00:51:15,745 --> 00:51:19,725
Speaker 8:  It sure is. If, you think maybe Trump might win, right? Fair

834
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:23,445
Speaker 8:  If. you think Trump is trying to woo Elon and you think there might be a

835
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:27,205
Speaker 8:  change of regime at the Department of Justice? You, you probably want

836
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:31,005
Speaker 8:  this to appear to be really bipartisan. You probably want to say

837
00:51:31,025 --> 00:51:34,725
Speaker 8:  the richest man, the most innovative triangle car man in the world

838
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:38,045
Speaker 8:  thinks that the case's a good idea. 'cause then he can make the super app

839
00:51:38,045 --> 00:51:41,925
Speaker 8:  that all innovative guys who Mely Ken Funnel

840
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:46,565
Speaker 8:  and robots wanna do. I don't know, like I

841
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:50,285
Speaker 8:  think that's a better argument politically than web app

842
00:51:50,285 --> 00:51:54,075
Speaker 8:  could be as powerful as Native app, which is I I

843
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:57,315
Speaker 8:  which is what I believe, but don don't Yeah, I'm not allowed. Like

844
00:51:57,315 --> 00:52:00,755
Speaker 5:  That's probably part of the reason that the digital wallet stuff is in here.

845
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,995
Speaker 5:  It's because you, it is bipartisan. Like the banks

846
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:08,115
Speaker 5:  want wanna get rid of that. They, they wanna be able to put their own wallets

847
00:52:08,115 --> 00:52:12,035
Speaker 5:  on the phone and, and now the the DOJ is

848
00:52:12,035 --> 00:52:14,195
Speaker 5:  saying, yeah, we want you to do that too. Yeah.

849
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:18,035
Speaker 4:  Also, just in case you're wondering, Elon Musk has tweeted twice today about

850
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:21,675
Speaker 4:  the Woke Mind virus and Zero Times about Apple and the GOJ.

851
00:52:22,415 --> 00:52:24,275
Speaker 4:  So not great so far.

852
00:52:24,505 --> 00:52:28,475
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean, look, the man does not love, does not love a government regulator.

853
00:52:28,905 --> 00:52:32,795
Speaker 8:  They're not his favorite. But I'm just saying like, If, you can use some

854
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:36,515
Speaker 8:  vocabulary that is more popular over there in Crazy

855
00:52:36,745 --> 00:52:40,475
Speaker 8:  Town. You're better off than talking about middleware or whatever

856
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:44,595
Speaker 8:  nonsense they were gonna talk about before. Yeah. I also think, yeah,

857
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:48,275
Speaker 8:  there are So I think Apple's response to this is like, bear, they're like,

858
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:51,435
Speaker 8:  this is our business model. We make products that work really well together.

859
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:54,955
Speaker 8:  I'm sorry if Janie Diamond and Elon Musk are mad at us, like

860
00:52:55,855 --> 00:52:59,595
Speaker 8:  we stand between you and the, you know, capricious avaricious banks.

861
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:03,395
Speaker 8:  Like that's a pretty good argument. I I don't, yeah. I'm not sitting here

862
00:53:03,395 --> 00:53:07,315
Speaker 8:  being like, man, I wish I could deal with my bank more directly. I, but

863
00:53:07,355 --> 00:53:10,275
Speaker 8:  I I I do think there's like a political coalition that they're trying to

864
00:53:10,275 --> 00:53:11,155
Speaker 8:  make out of it. Yeah.

865
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,675
Speaker 4:  Well we were talking a little bit about this with Lauren in the last segment,

866
00:53:14,055 --> 00:53:17,875
Speaker 4:  but the, the fact that what Apple is being accused

867
00:53:17,935 --> 00:53:21,635
Speaker 4:  of is the same thing that Apple has always said that it does,

868
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:25,725
Speaker 4:  which is build hardware, software and services that work best

869
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:29,485
Speaker 4:  together. And so like the argument that the Apple Watch is the best way to

870
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:33,085
Speaker 4:  use a smartwatch with an iPhone, like every single person at Apple Park is

871
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,485
Speaker 4:  like, yep, that's right. And it's just a question of, and I feel like this,

872
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:40,205
Speaker 4:  this to me reminds me a little bit of like, when I was at the

873
00:53:40,205 --> 00:53:44,165
Speaker 4:  Google Antitrust trial and they were arguing about basically Google's

874
00:53:44,315 --> 00:53:47,525
Speaker 4:  bigness and why Google has so much market share and Google was like,

875
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:51,845
Speaker 4:  no, it's 'cause we're very good and we make good products. Yeah. And the

876
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:54,725
Speaker 4:  government was like, well no.

877
00:53:56,305 --> 00:54:00,165
Speaker 4:  And it just like that proving the opposite of that point seems

878
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:04,085
Speaker 4:  very difficult to me in a way that like the DOJ set itself up with

879
00:54:04,085 --> 00:54:07,805
Speaker 4:  this really interesting narrative that kind of starts at

880
00:54:08,185 --> 00:54:12,165
Speaker 4:  the iPhone isn't very good and ends at Monopoly. And I think you

881
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:15,365
Speaker 4:  can sort of get there, but it just seems to me that like legally speaking

882
00:54:15,395 --> 00:54:19,365
Speaker 4:  jump, like proving the case from hoop to hoop there seems very complicated.

883
00:54:19,955 --> 00:54:23,245
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I don't know that they start with the iPhone isn't very good. I think

884
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:27,125
Speaker 8:  they're more or less like the iPhone's great. And we

885
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:31,085
Speaker 8:  have all of this evidence that Apple actually doesn't feel

886
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:32,725
Speaker 8:  any competitive pressure on the iPhone.

887
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:36,565
Speaker 4:  Right. But I think, but part of that is Apple saying the iPhone is not as

888
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:39,805
Speaker 4:  good as it could be. That like what they're saying is your experience would

889
00:54:39,805 --> 00:54:42,525
Speaker 4:  be better if there was more competitive, if there was more competition in

890
00:54:42,525 --> 00:54:42,845
Speaker 4:  this space.

891
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:45,165
Speaker 8:  Right. And even so we don't have all the evidence. They haven't seen all

892
00:54:45,465 --> 00:54:49,085
Speaker 8:  it, it sounds like there's just like oceans of Apple discovery, right?

893
00:54:49,235 --> 00:54:52,005
Speaker 8:  Like that exists. God yeah, it's pretty good.

894
00:54:53,145 --> 00:54:56,925
Speaker 8:  And but even in this complaint, there's the marketing manager for the iPhone

895
00:54:56,925 --> 00:55:00,205
Speaker 8:  saying, we made the phone too good. Like the the features are good enough

896
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:03,605
Speaker 8:  already. Right? We didn't have to put more expense into the phone.

897
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:06,885
Speaker 8:  We, we made the phone too good. We should, especially if the features are

898
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:10,645
Speaker 8:  gonna be expensive. I think the quote is like, we could challenge expensive

899
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:12,445
Speaker 8:  features going to the consumer phone, right?

900
00:55:13,165 --> 00:55:16,205
Speaker 4:  'cause like it would be good enough today what we did a while ago. Yeah.

901
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:20,125
Speaker 8:  Right? Like we were making things better for no reason. That's bad.

902
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:24,245
Speaker 8:  Right. What you want is Apple saying Samsung is on our ass, like

903
00:55:24,785 --> 00:55:28,125
Speaker 8:  Lenovo is on our ass, whoever, like Motorola, right? Yeah. And we should

904
00:55:28,355 --> 00:55:30,805
Speaker 8:  make the phone as good as possible to win market share, otherwise people

905
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:34,645
Speaker 8:  will switch. And the argument that the DOJ is making again

906
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:38,365
Speaker 8:  comes back to just like where is the application layer with, because the

907
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:41,125
Speaker 8:  application layer moves up one level

908
00:55:42,495 --> 00:55:46,245
Speaker 8:  super apps or the web, instantly the

909
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:49,365
Speaker 8:  iPhone gets disintermediated and they have to compete. And this is by the

910
00:55:49,365 --> 00:55:53,165
Speaker 8:  way, exactly what happened through Windows. I, we

911
00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:57,245
Speaker 8:  just had Dylan Field at South by Southwest with us talking about Figma and

912
00:55:57,245 --> 00:56:00,445
Speaker 8:  he was like, the app, the best way to deploy applications to desktop computers

913
00:56:00,455 --> 00:56:04,165
Speaker 8:  today is the web. Yep. Right? No one writes Native

914
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:07,405
Speaker 8:  window. Binary is not, you're writing games or you need some other specific,

915
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:11,245
Speaker 8:  very specific access to the hardware, which some, some people do. I'm not

916
00:56:11,245 --> 00:56:14,285
Speaker 8:  saying it's completely dead, but there's a reason that like Windows apps

917
00:56:14,305 --> 00:56:18,085
Speaker 8:  aren't the hotness desktop apps. All right? Like, or

918
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:21,805
Speaker 8:  I, the reason Windows apps aren't the hotness web apps all, and they all

919
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:24,645
Speaker 8:  live in the cloud and some of 'em have innovative access. Like big one does

920
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:25,965
Speaker 8:  a lot of cool stuff in web assembly.

921
00:56:26,195 --> 00:56:29,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean Electron is like the new middleware, right? Like it is, it is

922
00:56:29,605 --> 00:56:32,725
Speaker 4:  a thing that let let you run write one app that runs lots and lots of places

923
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:36,605
Speaker 8:  And people can have a lot of feelings about, like Electron is not great and

924
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:39,245
Speaker 8:  a lot of like electron destroys your compute and like they try to make it

925
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:42,845
Speaker 8:  better. But all that means is, in particular for Apple,

926
00:56:43,075 --> 00:56:46,885
Speaker 8:  when the application layer moved to the web, they were able to

927
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:50,645
Speaker 8:  ship the iMac and take market share away from Windows.

928
00:56:51,665 --> 00:56:55,445
Speaker 8:  and that is a that right? That created the opportunity for Apple to exist.

929
00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:59,445
Speaker 8:  And so if the DOJ is basically saying, look, apple is

930
00:57:00,005 --> 00:57:02,965
Speaker 8:  restricting the natural evolution of technology and they're not letting the

931
00:57:02,965 --> 00:57:06,805
Speaker 8:  application layer move to Super app or the web or wherever ai wherever it

932
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:10,605
Speaker 8:  might go. and that means the next generation of competitors is not

933
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:13,725
Speaker 8:  forming. And here's the evidence, which is Apple is artificially keeping

934
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:17,325
Speaker 8:  the price of the phone high and they're not trying very hard. And here's

935
00:57:17,325 --> 00:57:20,605
Speaker 8:  some quotes in the complaint where they're explicitly not on one of them.

936
00:57:20,995 --> 00:57:24,725
Speaker 8:  They gotta prove all this, this is a complaint. Right? But I see the argument

937
00:57:24,885 --> 00:57:27,085
Speaker 8:  'cause it is exactly the argument that allowed the iMac to exist.

938
00:57:27,595 --> 00:57:31,365
Speaker 4:  Well, and to that point, like Apple understands better than

939
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,925
Speaker 4:  anybody the consequences of this because Apple exists because of those consequences.

940
00:57:34,925 --> 00:57:37,885
Speaker 4:  Right? Like it is, I think the, the

941
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:42,045
Speaker 4:  basically like the Microsoft antitrust trial led to the success of the

942
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:44,285
Speaker 4:  iPod is like a slightly wild take.

943
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:49,845
Speaker 8:  I think that's going too far. I-I-I-I-I think it it led to the success of

944
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:51,165
Speaker 8:  the web, which allowed the imex

945
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,415
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I think that's a better argument. But the complaint says the iPod

946
00:57:55,415 --> 00:57:56,415
Speaker 4:  did it. Well it's,

947
00:57:56,415 --> 00:58:00,015
Speaker 5:  It's going the, the complaints is the iPod because they wanted to connect

948
00:58:00,015 --> 00:58:03,655
Speaker 5:  QuickTime where they had all these quotes from Apple executives talking about

949
00:58:03,655 --> 00:58:07,015
Speaker 5:  QuickTime and how it was hindered on, on windows. So like

950
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:11,405
Speaker 5:  that, that they had, they wanted to stay in theme and make and reuse Apple

951
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,005
Speaker 5:  quotes to be like, yeah, suck it Apple. Right?

952
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:17,205
Speaker 8:  And all those people are like rich or gone doesn, it doesn't matter.

953
00:58:18,305 --> 00:58:22,245
Speaker 8:  But that thing, like I I I, I just, we've talked

954
00:58:22,245 --> 00:58:25,405
Speaker 8:  enough about like in many ways the complaint reads like a bird cast episode.

955
00:58:25,825 --> 00:58:26,805
Speaker 4:  It kind of does. Which I,

956
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:30,725
Speaker 8:  It's like fascinating to me. It's like bringing bubbles and like NFC

957
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:34,685
Speaker 8:  excess, like it's very wonky. Like I, you know, I,

958
00:58:34,885 --> 00:58:38,005
Speaker 8:  I did just spend an hour with Danter on a stage. Like the dude is a nerd.

959
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:42,835
Speaker 8:  We, he, I think he gets it in a way that, you know, I think it's, it's

960
00:58:42,835 --> 00:58:46,795
Speaker 8:  very tempting to say like I York computer something like I spent

961
00:58:46,795 --> 00:58:50,115
Speaker 8:  some time with him recently. I, I think he gets it. I think the point he's

962
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:52,435
Speaker 8:  trying to make is

963
00:58:54,025 --> 00:58:57,795
Speaker 8:  make like over and over again what happens in technology is the

964
00:58:57,795 --> 00:59:01,755
Speaker 8:  application layer moves up one level of abstraction. I'll

965
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:05,315
Speaker 8:  give you an example that's totally unrelated. This is more peanut water thoughts,

966
00:59:05,735 --> 00:59:09,715
Speaker 8:  but I'll give you more, one more example. It's totally unrelated. This Jensen

967
00:59:09,745 --> 00:59:13,495
Speaker 8:  Wong from Nvidia, like he just on

968
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:16,015
Speaker 8:  stage said, I don't think people are gonna have to know how to code anymore.

969
00:59:16,305 --> 00:59:18,775
Speaker 8:  Right? Because they'll just tell the AI what to do and the AI will generate

970
00:59:18,775 --> 00:59:22,655
Speaker 8:  applications for them. That's a huge step up in levels

971
00:59:22,755 --> 00:59:26,555
Speaker 8:  of abstraction. It's massively inefficient to say,

972
00:59:26,675 --> 00:59:30,595
Speaker 8:  I will no longer know how to program a computer. I will tell

973
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:34,395
Speaker 8:  a data center full Nvidia unique views to write programs

974
00:59:34,415 --> 00:59:36,835
Speaker 8:  for another computer. Like massively inefficient.

975
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:42,355
Speaker 8:  But that's, everyone believes in, and I, I I, you know, I think If you believe

976
00:59:42,355 --> 00:59:46,315
Speaker 8:  that that is the arc of technology then you, you, it's hard

977
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:50,155
Speaker 8:  to look at the iPhone and say, well where are the really interesting

978
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:54,595
Speaker 8:  electron is at where are the really interesting super abstinence

979
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:58,515
Speaker 8:  punches? We have had a coverage of super apps are coming on the

980
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:02,355
Speaker 8:  word for five years. Like ever since anybody woke up and

981
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:06,275
Speaker 8:  saw WeChat in China and said, oh look, the Chinese market, there's a lot

982
01:00:06,275 --> 01:00:09,835
Speaker 8:  of switching between phones. It was like, it's a more vibrant market over

983
01:00:09,835 --> 01:00:13,675
Speaker 8:  there and smartphones because this one app is actually the operating system.

984
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:17,835
Speaker 8:  Right? Right. Why doesn't that kind of thing happen inside that Google doesn't

985
01:00:17,835 --> 01:00:21,315
Speaker 8:  want that to exist? Not that meta wouldn't do that tomorrow with Facebook

986
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:23,195
Speaker 8:  if that Apple is basically for the king.

987
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:26,555
Speaker 4:  I mean that's functionally what Facebook has been trying to do for a decade

988
01:00:26,775 --> 01:00:30,395
Speaker 4:  now is, is build more and more of that stuff in. And ironically on the web

989
01:00:30,695 --> 01:00:33,835
Speaker 4:  for a long time it worked really well. And then, yeah, and this is, we were

990
01:00:33,835 --> 01:00:37,795
Speaker 4:  talking about the, the super app thing and whether it's like a function

991
01:00:37,795 --> 01:00:40,595
Speaker 4:  of the way Apple works or just a genuine cultural difference. And it, this

992
01:00:40,715 --> 01:00:43,075
Speaker 4:  hadn't occurred to me until now, but I think maybe the best argument you

993
01:00:43,075 --> 01:00:46,555
Speaker 4:  could make for why it's just a cultural difference is that everybody hated

994
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:49,715
Speaker 4:  when Facebook got really cluttered. Oh my goodness. Like ran away from the

995
01:00:49,715 --> 01:00:53,675
Speaker 4:  app and, and Facebook like pretty nakedly and loudly.

996
01:00:53,705 --> 01:00:57,235
Speaker 4:  Like tried to learn from WeChat and just pull more and more of that in. And

997
01:00:57,235 --> 01:01:01,035
Speaker 4:  it got messy and it got weird and it got complicated. And then, you know,

998
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:04,875
Speaker 4:  politics happened and people started to like flee Facebook. But

999
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:07,955
Speaker 4:  still people use marketplace in groups and like Facebook is in a very real

1000
01:01:08,055 --> 01:01:11,675
Speaker 4:  way a super app. It is the closest thing we have in the United States to

1001
01:01:11,675 --> 01:01:12,435
Speaker 4:  a super app, I would say.

1002
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:14,435
Speaker 8:  Yeah, but it's not close enough. It's not,

1003
01:01:14,695 --> 01:01:16,115
Speaker 4:  No, and it can't do it on mobile,

1004
01:01:16,165 --> 01:01:19,515
Speaker 8:  Right. It's not, I do everything with app. So. I can switch to a Samsung

1005
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:23,075
Speaker 8:  phone or whatever kind of other phone a pixel and

1006
01:01:23,505 --> 01:01:27,475
Speaker 8:  basically recreate my experience. and that the point is, If,

1007
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:31,155
Speaker 8:  you could If you can switch your services or you can switch your

1008
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:34,795
Speaker 8:  application environment easily. You'll be very likely to switch your

1009
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:38,835
Speaker 8:  hardware. Yeah. And the, there's a line in the complaint that another

1010
01:01:38,845 --> 01:01:42,335
Speaker 8:  Apple quote, this is the one that led me to believe there's a mountain of

1011
01:01:42,455 --> 01:01:46,175
Speaker 8:  evidence in this case where it's an email from an unnamed Apple

1012
01:01:46,175 --> 01:01:50,015
Speaker 8:  executive who says, if we let this cloud stuff happen, anyone can just

1013
01:01:50,095 --> 01:01:52,455
Speaker 8:  buy a $25 Android and have a great experience.

1014
01:01:52,795 --> 01:01:56,015
Speaker 4:  He said Bucks and it and spelled bucks with an X. That's the best. Which

1015
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:57,655
Speaker 4:  I hate part hate so much. That's good.

1016
01:01:58,195 --> 01:02:00,735
Speaker 8:  And I believe you said that that's the barbarians at the gate.

1017
01:02:02,525 --> 01:02:03,695
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's pretty good. Right? And

1018
01:02:03,695 --> 01:02:07,375
Speaker 8:  That's like Apple, like openly being afraid of

1019
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:11,655
Speaker 8:  Android in that way. Not because it's better, but because it's deeper

1020
01:02:12,115 --> 01:02:15,375
Speaker 8:  and saying we have to make sure it's not a good experience over there.

1021
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:20,005
Speaker 8:  Not by making our phone great, but by letting, making sure that

1022
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:23,765
Speaker 8:  application developers can't do things over there that can do here. Or making

1023
01:02:23,765 --> 01:02:27,725
Speaker 8:  sure that if they do things over here, it's costly. Like cloud gaming. Right?

1024
01:02:27,805 --> 01:02:30,965
Speaker 8:  I think that was the example there. We allowed cloud gaming. Anyone can buy

1025
01:02:30,965 --> 01:02:33,125
Speaker 8:  cheap and Android. I thought I have a great experience 'cause we'll just

1026
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:36,845
Speaker 8:  be cloud gaming that's bad. Like I can't

1027
01:02:36,845 --> 01:02:40,645
Speaker 8:  stress enough how bad that is. And again, I'll come back to Figma just 'cause

1028
01:02:40,645 --> 01:02:44,245
Speaker 8:  we had Dylan on the phone recently. I know a lot of designers who have given

1029
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:47,885
Speaker 8:  up their MacBooks because they spend all day using Figma on a

1030
01:02:47,885 --> 01:02:51,685
Speaker 8:  Chromebook and then they, they, you know, they allocate their dollars elsewhere.

1031
01:02:52,345 --> 01:02:56,325
Speaker 8:  That's fascinating. It's just a, a fascinating turn of events that just

1032
01:02:56,485 --> 01:03:00,375
Speaker 8:  happened in that market. It's crazy that nothing has gotten

1033
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:03,415
Speaker 8:  in between phone. Now, just for the sake of the argument, I will make all

1034
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:06,095
Speaker 8:  of Apple's arguments without having really read their responses. Because

1035
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,135
Speaker 8:  again, I don't think sleep can

1036
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:10,695
Speaker 4:  They are what you think they are. Yeah. I'll tell you that. Like there was,

1037
01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:13,215
Speaker 4:  there's, they, they did a background briefing with a bunch of reporters and

1038
01:03:13,285 --> 01:03:16,615
Speaker 4:  have put out a couple of statements and nothing in it will remotely surprise

1039
01:03:16,615 --> 01:03:17,175
Speaker 4:  you. None

1040
01:03:17,175 --> 01:03:17,375
Speaker 5:  Of it.

1041
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:20,335
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I I do love that the briefing was on background by the way.

1042
01:03:21,515 --> 01:03:22,895
Speaker 8:  We are mad said no one.

1043
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:28,975
Speaker 8:  Cool. Anyhow, I'm guessing they're like, the

1044
01:03:29,215 --> 01:03:31,735
Speaker 8:  security is really important. These things, we are in pockets all the time.

1045
01:03:33,195 --> 01:03:36,935
Speaker 8:  We craft integration of hardware, software and services that no else does.

1046
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:40,215
Speaker 8:  Like that's actually the business, not this other stuff

1047
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,295
Speaker 4:  That is alarmingly close. Yeah,

1048
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:46,175
Speaker 8:  Sure. Yeah. But we've covered this company for a long time and then I'm wondering

1049
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,135
Speaker 8:  if they brought up Battery Life because that, that's the one to me that's

1050
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:49,215
Speaker 8:  like

1051
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:55,275
Speaker 8:  our producer, Liam was just at my house and we were on a Google meet with

1052
01:03:55,275 --> 01:03:58,795
Speaker 8:  my 2015 iMac and he was like, what's that noise? And I was like, that's the

1053
01:03:59,065 --> 01:04:03,035
Speaker 8:  iMac, that's the fans from the iMac trying to run this web app

1054
01:04:03,035 --> 01:04:04,995
Speaker 8:  right now. And he was like, I thought that was your fur.

1055
01:04:07,735 --> 01:04:10,435
Speaker 5:  It was your 2015 iMac.

1056
01:04:11,045 --> 01:04:14,835
Speaker 8:  There are a lot of arguments, especially on a mobile phone, power constraints,

1057
01:04:14,945 --> 01:04:18,555
Speaker 8:  ball device, blah, blah blah. Network constrained where you want to be in

1058
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:22,335
Speaker 8:  tight control of what an application can do. I I totally,

1059
01:04:22,615 --> 01:04:26,575
Speaker 8:  I totally buy it there. I don't think those arguments are wrong. I just think

1060
01:04:26,705 --> 01:04:30,455
Speaker 8:  Apple probably ever since Tim Cook said

1061
01:04:30,725 --> 01:04:34,135
Speaker 8:  like services revenue and a, a call five years ago

1062
01:04:34,835 --> 01:04:38,655
Speaker 8:  has been actively protecting the business as opposed to growing it.

1063
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:42,305
Speaker 8:  And I think there, I think there's a bunch of evidence to that, to that effect.

1064
01:04:42,805 --> 01:04:46,705
Speaker 5:  So Apple didn't mention Battery Life on super apps instead all on

1065
01:04:46,705 --> 01:04:50,425
Speaker 5:  background again. So we don't know who actually said any of this. Maybe it

1066
01:04:50,425 --> 01:04:54,185
Speaker 5:  wasn't even Apple. Maybe it was orange, but, but they said that

1067
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:58,105
Speaker 5:  super apps exist already and, and that anything they do is for privacy

1068
01:04:58,325 --> 01:05:01,265
Speaker 5:  and security reasons, which is the big theme.

1069
01:05:01,975 --> 01:05:04,905
Speaker 8:  What do countries do? They call out to grab existing in

1070
01:05:06,075 --> 01:05:07,305
Speaker 4:  China and India. Yep.

1071
01:05:07,645 --> 01:05:08,625
Speaker 5:  WeChat and Tata.

1072
01:05:08,955 --> 01:05:12,385
Speaker 8:  Right. So two countries that

1073
01:05:12,745 --> 01:05:14,505
Speaker 8:  regulate the shit out of Apple.

1074
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:15,465
Speaker 4:  Yep.

1075
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:20,065
Speaker 8:  I just wanna be blunt, like China basically is like, you're gonna give our

1076
01:05:20,065 --> 01:05:23,625
Speaker 8:  user data to the state. And China and Apple's like cool China

1077
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:28,265
Speaker 8:  from John Gruber I think reported this. China's the one that said

1078
01:05:28,265 --> 01:05:31,835
Speaker 8:  you're gonna do RCS and Apple finally caved. Wow. Probably for bad reasons,

1079
01:05:31,835 --> 01:05:35,235
Speaker 8:  right? I think China wants Apple to move to RCS. The people will stop using

1080
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:39,315
Speaker 8:  encrypted I Cap or I method. Yeah, that's bad. But they're gonna do it.

1081
01:05:39,805 --> 01:05:43,715
Speaker 8:  India also extraordinarily interested in regulating Apple

1082
01:05:44,105 --> 01:05:48,035
Speaker 8:  also. I don't know If, you saw the pictures of Rihanna performing at a wedding

1083
01:05:48,035 --> 01:05:51,475
Speaker 8:  in India lately. Psh Ban's son's

1084
01:05:52,155 --> 01:05:55,795
Speaker 8:  wedding. Shaima owns Reliance. Gia the largest carrier

1085
01:05:55,975 --> 01:05:59,675
Speaker 8:  in India. He's the major benefactor of the government. And when the

1086
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:02,995
Speaker 8:  wireless carrier in India says, we wanna make sure people can switch easily,

1087
01:06:03,805 --> 01:06:07,795
Speaker 8:  apple gives up. Right? And like that's a big thing. My

1088
01:06:07,915 --> 01:06:10,595
Speaker 8:  favorite fact that the Indians farm from the market is they're like 10 phone

1089
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:14,515
Speaker 8:  launches a week or some insane number like that. That's the dream. 'cause

1090
01:06:14,515 --> 01:06:17,555
Speaker 8:  people are switching, people are switching so hard all over the place because

1091
01:06:17,615 --> 01:06:21,275
Speaker 8:  the application layer, the network layer is actually to some extent on

1092
01:06:21,275 --> 01:06:25,075
Speaker 8:  reliance. Like reliance via the network is actually the application

1093
01:06:25,075 --> 01:06:28,075
Speaker 8:  layer there, which is utterly fascinating. Yeah. So I would just point out

1094
01:06:28,075 --> 01:06:31,515
Speaker 8:  like Apple's saying it, super Rapids exists and not mentioning that in the

1095
01:06:31,515 --> 01:06:34,915
Speaker 8:  two countries that regulates Apple the hardest in various ways. It's pretty

1096
01:06:34,915 --> 01:06:38,435
Speaker 8:  funny man. It's how it appears to be on background.

1097
01:06:39,135 --> 01:06:43,075
Speaker 8:  So we don't even know because someone whispered this Yeah. In a

1098
01:06:43,075 --> 01:06:45,475
Speaker 8:  meeting and, and no one was allowed to ask that person. Who knows

1099
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:45,915
Speaker 4:  I

1100
01:06:45,915 --> 01:06:47,835
Speaker 5:  Fell asleep and I woke up and had these arguments

1101
01:06:47,835 --> 01:06:51,515
Speaker 4:  In I knew it. My head So I knew in my head. Yeah. Yeah. Neil, why do you

1102
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:54,355
Speaker 4:  think they didn't talk about the web more in this complaint? The, the, the

1103
01:06:54,355 --> 01:06:58,075
Speaker 4:  thing that surprised me the most was that all of the arguments that we've

1104
01:06:58,075 --> 01:07:01,955
Speaker 4:  been talking about on The Vergecast for months now, about what the

1105
01:07:01,955 --> 01:07:05,835
Speaker 4:  open web could be like. I just imagine Dieter bone reading this and like

1106
01:07:05,905 --> 01:07:09,635
Speaker 4:  screaming about progressive web apps and he's like, this

1107
01:07:09,635 --> 01:07:13,035
Speaker 4:  solves all problems. The Palm pri knew it, everything would've been great,

1108
01:07:13,895 --> 01:07:17,775
Speaker 4:  but the open web wasn't really a thing. Like they, they didn't talk about

1109
01:07:17,775 --> 01:07:21,175
Speaker 4:  web browsers except sort of obliquely. There were not big discussions about

1110
01:07:21,175 --> 01:07:23,975
Speaker 4:  what web apps could do to make these things better. Like why, what's your

1111
01:07:23,975 --> 01:07:26,335
Speaker 4:  read on why that was not part of this complaint?

1112
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:30,335
Speaker 8:  One, I, I texted Dieter today and I said, I miss you. The United

1113
01:07:30,335 --> 01:07:32,015
Speaker 8:  States government says web apps are

1114
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:36,895
Speaker 8:  important. He was just like, go on vacation. Like stop this.

1115
01:07:37,195 --> 01:07:40,095
Speaker 4:  He texted you back from messages.google.com the web app.

1116
01:07:40,655 --> 01:07:41,335
Speaker 8:  Yeah, exactly.

1117
01:07:43,835 --> 01:07:47,735
Speaker 8:  So yeah, good call out there. I so again, I, I think this is

1118
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:51,535
Speaker 8:  a political thing. I I think that that stuff is in there. I

1119
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:55,295
Speaker 8:  I know for a fact the DOJ has been paying a lot of attention

1120
01:07:55,995 --> 01:07:59,735
Speaker 8:  to Apple's compliance, the DMA in Europe and their move to,

1121
01:07:59,835 --> 01:08:03,775
Speaker 8:  you know, disallow web apps. Yeah. And then like bring them back

1122
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:07,535
Speaker 8:  because the Regor by the way, that web app thing, you know,

1123
01:08:07,555 --> 01:08:11,415
Speaker 8:  I'm not like a crypto per thing, but there is

1124
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:15,405
Speaker 8:  a huge freak out because there are crypto apps that store web that are web

1125
01:08:15,405 --> 01:08:19,085
Speaker 8:  apps that store the data locally. And Apple was about to wipe out people's

1126
01:08:19,085 --> 01:08:22,725
Speaker 8:  wallets by disallowing web apps. 'cause they were just gonna get rid of the

1127
01:08:22,925 --> 01:08:23,245
Speaker 8:  functionality.

1128
01:08:23,435 --> 01:08:27,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Literally the, the local data on their phone that was stored there

1129
01:08:27,115 --> 01:08:29,885
Speaker 4:  with their money would've just been gone insane.

1130
01:08:29,935 --> 01:08:33,805
Speaker 8:  Which is, I mean, hilarious. It's So I. I know the DOJ has been paying

1131
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:37,805
Speaker 8:  a lot of attention to everything there. I really think this comes down

1132
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:41,765
Speaker 8:  to who is the audience for this, for this complaint.

1133
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:44,565
Speaker 8:  I was talking to Sarah John about it. This complaint is a press release.

1134
01:08:45,115 --> 01:08:47,605
Speaker 8:  It's fundamentally press, it's written like a press release. It's a story.

1135
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:51,965
Speaker 8:  It begins with like, it's Steve Jobs in Media Red, like doing

1136
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,005
Speaker 8:  a thing. you know, it's like, it, it's a story.

1137
01:08:54,345 --> 01:08:58,125
Speaker 4:  It starts with a Kindle ad. Like truly what a win for the Kindle

1138
01:08:58,125 --> 01:08:58,445
Speaker 4:  today.

1139
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:02,245
Speaker 4:  The Kindle is the bastion of openness.

1140
01:09:02,995 --> 01:09:06,645
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And I I think telling people the, we,

1141
01:09:06,825 --> 01:09:09,885
Speaker 8:  you know, the web apps are gonna do it on a phone. It's like people know

1142
01:09:09,885 --> 01:09:13,525
Speaker 8:  what websites look like on a phone. We have no good ones.

1143
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:17,565
Speaker 8:  The only good ones. Yeah. That is true. All the rest of them are, are trying

1144
01:09:17,565 --> 01:09:21,365
Speaker 8:  to mug you in a dark alley. IIII think they had to move on and say like,

1145
01:09:21,475 --> 01:09:24,765
Speaker 8:  there's a next generation of products that's being held back. By the way,

1146
01:09:25,275 --> 01:09:29,125
Speaker 8:  Elon Musk proprietor Triangle Cars wants to build one right now,

1147
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:33,085
Speaker 8:  doesn't it? And I think that's a, it's a much better story to,

1148
01:09:33,155 --> 01:09:36,525
Speaker 8:  it's a story about The future and that story about the path. But I think

1149
01:09:36,555 --> 01:09:40,525
Speaker 8:  fundamentally, you know, the recent history of technology

1150
01:09:40,525 --> 01:09:44,125
Speaker 8:  suggests the web is actually the best application platform. Yeah. Yep. It

1151
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:48,085
Speaker 8:  distributes us widely. And it has in fact taken over on

1152
01:09:48,195 --> 01:09:52,165
Speaker 8:  Deca like in a real way, a lot of the native apps that you think you're

1153
01:09:52,165 --> 01:09:56,125
Speaker 8:  using on a macro PC are in fact electronics. Yep. They're

1154
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,285
Speaker 8:  just wrappers around web apps.

1155
01:09:57,595 --> 01:10:01,405
Speaker 4:  I've been covering browsers more in the last 12 months than I have in like

1156
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,885
Speaker 4:  the previous decade because again, the, the, the layer of

1157
01:10:04,885 --> 01:10:08,325
Speaker 4:  applications is moving and all these browsers are starting to realize like,

1158
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:12,085
Speaker 4:  oh, your operating system isn't actually the place that can do all this stuff

1159
01:10:12,085 --> 01:10:16,005
Speaker 4:  for you online. It's your browser. Yep. So we're, we're going to give you

1160
01:10:16,005 --> 01:10:19,365
Speaker 4:  more cross-platform tools. We're gonna rethink the way extensions work.

1161
01:10:19,785 --> 01:10:23,085
Speaker 4:  Arc is one of a bunch of browsers doing it at bunch of interesting stuff

1162
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:26,965
Speaker 4:  with ai. And so like that's the same sort of layer of

1163
01:10:26,965 --> 01:10:30,605
Speaker 4:  app abstraction that you're talking about. And it's making browsers at least

1164
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:32,925
Speaker 4:  on desktops, like really interesting and important. Again,

1165
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,525
Speaker 5:  It's all about Microsoft Edge.

1166
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:39,525
Speaker 4:  Well, and even again, like Microsoft now is like, edge is a crucially

1167
01:10:39,525 --> 01:10:43,485
Speaker 4:  important thing to Microsoft in a way that like, remember the last time

1168
01:10:43,485 --> 01:10:46,645
Speaker 4:  browsers were important to Microsoft. I know.

1169
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:50,565
Speaker 5:  Well that, that's, that's for 2040. 2040 Microsoft Edge is gonna

1170
01:10:50,565 --> 01:10:53,165
Speaker 5:  be a horrible monopoly. Just you Wait,

1171
01:10:54,395 --> 01:10:55,775
Speaker 4:  That's a good take. Yeah, I appreciate

1172
01:10:55,775 --> 01:10:59,655
Speaker 8:  That. I mean this is just a circle of life, right? Yeah. I would just

1173
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:03,255
Speaker 8:  like, the thing I would say is like a bunch of these quote unquote middleware,

1174
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:07,585
Speaker 8:  it was like, did turn out to be garbage. Like I don't, like Java did not

1175
01:11:07,585 --> 01:11:11,345
Speaker 8:  turn out the excellent application environment and Flash

1176
01:11:11,785 --> 01:11:15,725
Speaker 8:  I think somewhat famously was a piece of crap. But If, you don't

1177
01:11:15,775 --> 01:11:19,685
Speaker 8:  allow the things to like take hold in the market then you are gonna

1178
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:23,125
Speaker 8:  be stuck with one vendor kind of controlling everything. And I, I

1179
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:26,965
Speaker 8:  I wonder how much of a shotgun gun approach this complainant? Again, it's

1180
01:11:26,965 --> 01:11:30,285
Speaker 8:  everything. It's iMessage, it's applications, it's super apps, it's

1181
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:34,805
Speaker 8:  wallet wallets, it's, I mean smart watch. It's everything. And I

1182
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:38,565
Speaker 8:  wonder how much of this is like, let's put it out there so people grab onto

1183
01:11:39,305 --> 01:11:41,125
Speaker 8:  and then Yeah. And then follow up on that one.

1184
01:11:41,555 --> 01:11:42,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. How

1185
01:11:42,325 --> 01:11:46,205
Speaker 5:  Much of the case when it finally goes is just gonna be spicy Apple

1186
01:11:46,225 --> 01:11:50,125
Speaker 5:  quotes and then being like, look how spicy this is. Destroy them.

1187
01:11:50,355 --> 01:11:54,205
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I think what we've learned from all of these recently is

1188
01:11:54,205 --> 01:11:58,045
Speaker 8:  there's nothing more fun than putting a powerful executive on a

1189
01:11:58,045 --> 01:11:59,685
Speaker 8:  stand and just reading their email to them.

1190
01:12:01,265 --> 01:12:03,485
Speaker 8:  You, you read this email that you're not certain. They're like, I don't recall.

1191
01:12:04,545 --> 01:12:07,045
Speaker 8:  That's pretty good. Like I'll watch that. you know,

1192
01:12:07,265 --> 01:12:08,405
Speaker 4:  We have seen a lot of that.

1193
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:09,765
Speaker 8:  The thing I warn everybody

1194
01:12:11,585 --> 01:12:15,405
Speaker 8:  is the Microsoft case in the nineties took a a decade,

1195
01:12:16,055 --> 01:12:18,845
Speaker 8:  right? It was like three or four years in trial, then three or four years

1196
01:12:18,865 --> 01:12:22,245
Speaker 8:  of appeal, then I got kicked back then there was a settlement at one point.

1197
01:12:23,925 --> 01:12:27,805
Speaker 8:  I have this very distinct memory of standing in the Target and

1198
01:12:27,805 --> 01:12:31,085
Speaker 8:  we're seeing Wisconsin, it's like a child teenager

1199
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:35,245
Speaker 8:  reading the Newsweek that was describing how Microsoft could be

1200
01:12:35,245 --> 01:12:38,125
Speaker 8:  split up into something called Apps Co and Osco. Yep.

1201
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:39,085
Speaker 4:  Because

1202
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:41,285
Speaker 8:  They were gonna split windows from application business. I don't know why

1203
01:12:41,285 --> 01:12:44,125
Speaker 8:  this happened in Target and we're seeing, I mean I know why I think we're

1204
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:47,405
Speaker 8:  seeing Wisconsin that I grew up, but I don know why this memory specific

1205
01:12:47,425 --> 01:12:51,405
Speaker 8:  to standing in a project reading Newsweek print. but it is, that's

1206
01:12:51,405 --> 01:12:53,725
Speaker 8:  what I got for you. I can't remember anyone's names today. I remember that.

1207
01:12:54,665 --> 01:12:58,485
Speaker 8:  That's who I am. Yeah. You go and like it got all the way to the

1208
01:12:58,485 --> 01:13:01,245
Speaker 8:  DOJ is gonna break up Microsoft. It came all the way back down and that took

1209
01:13:01,665 --> 01:13:05,445
Speaker 8:  10 years. And So I think this is a decade, but

1210
01:13:05,445 --> 01:13:09,165
Speaker 8:  this is a gravitational Well that will last a decade. Like the

1211
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:12,965
Speaker 8:  entire industry is gonna bend around this case for a decade.

1212
01:13:13,595 --> 01:13:17,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We, we gave Lauren the over under of 2030 and for

1213
01:13:17,525 --> 01:13:21,205
Speaker 4:  this to be like fully all the way done and dusted and she sort of

1214
01:13:21,425 --> 01:13:25,365
Speaker 4:  gently took the over it sounds like you're, you're like hard over on

1215
01:13:25,365 --> 01:13:25,805
Speaker 4:  2030.

1216
01:13:26,395 --> 01:13:27,565
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean, unless

1217
01:13:30,395 --> 01:13:34,355
Speaker 8:  I think the only difference to me in my mind is that the DNA exists

1218
01:13:34,455 --> 01:13:37,875
Speaker 8:  in the EU now and Apple is making these changes anyway. And so it's gonna

1219
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:41,835
Speaker 8:  collect some data about how much money it can make in the meantime

1220
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:46,455
Speaker 8:  and what that would be like here each other. There's a possibility that

1221
01:13:46,645 --> 01:13:50,495
Speaker 8:  that breaks this case and makes it go shorter, but they're

1222
01:13:50,595 --> 01:13:54,455
Speaker 8:  mad. Like this is a company that is idealistically ideologically

1223
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:57,135
Speaker 8:  upset at the note thing, but we can't do whatever it wants.

1224
01:13:58,585 --> 01:14:02,285
Speaker 8:  And I get it. Like, I I don't like being told what to do. No one does. I

1225
01:14:02,285 --> 01:14:06,005
Speaker 8:  dunno if anyone has ever noticed, but I think in this case, like again, I

1226
01:14:06,425 --> 01:14:10,165
Speaker 8:  to some extent this complaint reads like To Vergecast. It's like why, why,

1227
01:14:10,465 --> 01:14:13,685
Speaker 8:  why did it take so long for Apple to allow games Finn the app than iPhone?

1228
01:14:13,865 --> 01:14:16,925
Speaker 8:  Oh. 'cause they wanna protect the app store. Right. It's as simple as that.

1229
01:14:17,355 --> 01:14:20,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. So one more thing and then we should let you go because you have

1230
01:14:20,845 --> 01:14:22,045
Speaker 4:  many more pina coladas to drink

1231
01:14:23,145 --> 01:14:26,965
Speaker 8:  So many. How do you feel like I'm never coming home that's,

1232
01:14:27,315 --> 01:14:31,245
Speaker 4:  This is Mexico NELI is gonna be a whole new addition to The Vergecast. I

1233
01:14:31,245 --> 01:14:31,485
Speaker 4:  love this.

1234
01:14:32,995 --> 01:14:36,725
Speaker 4:  Talk to me about how you feel about this. Like as a, as a lawyer who would

1235
01:14:36,725 --> 01:14:39,125
Speaker 4:  have to argue this case, because one of the things Alex and I have been arguing

1236
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:42,645
Speaker 4:  about all day is my feeling is that one of the big things that happened

1237
01:14:43,105 --> 01:14:47,005
Speaker 4:  in the Microsoft case was that you had Netscape, which was this like one

1238
01:14:47,095 --> 01:14:50,485
Speaker 4:  party that had been like viciously loudly wronged.

1239
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:54,165
Speaker 4:  And it actually ended up not being the most important part of that case.

1240
01:14:54,165 --> 01:14:57,445
Speaker 4:  but it, it was like, it was a very helpful victim that you could argue this

1241
01:14:57,445 --> 01:15:00,765
Speaker 4:  is the bad thing that was done to someone and it crushed them.

1242
01:15:01,225 --> 01:15:04,005
Speaker 4:  And, and maybe it's just too early to know the answer to this question, but

1243
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:08,245
Speaker 4:  my argument has been that there isn't a version of that in this complaint.

1244
01:15:08,665 --> 01:15:12,565
Speaker 4:  Alex's response, which I think is fair, is that basically the, the

1245
01:15:12,565 --> 01:15:16,165
Speaker 4:  victim in this is us, the people who use these devices, but like

1246
01:15:16,865 --> 01:15:20,405
Speaker 4:  if If you were a lawyer standing up in front of people trying to argue this

1247
01:15:20,405 --> 01:15:24,325
Speaker 4:  case, how does it feel to you from seeing the complaint? It

1248
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:27,765
Speaker 4:  it you in terms of just like handicapping your chances of being able to prove

1249
01:15:27,765 --> 01:15:28,205
Speaker 4:  this in court?

1250
01:15:30,355 --> 01:15:33,875
Speaker 8:  I, I, I wish I knew what evidence they were sitting on. What I would say

1251
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:37,235
Speaker 8:  is Netscape was a very convenient victim

1252
01:15:37,585 --> 01:15:40,675
Speaker 8:  because it was the web, it represented the thing that people liked.

1253
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:45,195
Speaker 8:  Here's the exciting new thing, like why are you getting on the internet to,

1254
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:49,195
Speaker 8:  to use this? And Microsoft wants to crush it and

1255
01:15:49,255 --> 01:15:53,155
Speaker 8:  own it. And that's a good story to tell. I think in this case,

1256
01:15:53,185 --> 01:15:57,035
Speaker 8:  it's much more like look at Apple looking at any threats to

1257
01:15:57,035 --> 01:16:00,675
Speaker 8:  its business and sending emails saying we can't let that buy. Look at Apple

1258
01:16:00,675 --> 01:16:03,435
Speaker 8:  saying we cannot allow people to buy cheaper things.

1259
01:16:05,585 --> 01:16:08,985
Speaker 8:  I, you know, we, we've talked a lot really just talking about, about like

1260
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:12,265
Speaker 8:  theories of antitrust law on this show and like

1261
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:16,745
Speaker 8:  trying to change them from like the consumer welfare standard to blah, you

1262
01:16:16,745 --> 01:16:19,585
Speaker 8:  know, like all this stuff. And one thing that's really notable about this

1263
01:16:19,905 --> 01:16:23,865
Speaker 8:  complaint is there's no esoteric new antitrust,

1264
01:16:24,005 --> 01:16:27,345
Speaker 8:  new brand. It's Apple kept prices high.

1265
01:16:27,765 --> 01:16:31,545
Speaker 8:  That's the argument. Yep. Yep. Apple won't by by by

1266
01:16:31,845 --> 01:16:35,585
Speaker 8:  not allowing or these new application model to take take hold. Apple

1267
01:16:35,615 --> 01:16:39,145
Speaker 8:  gets to keep that price and high. And I think that actually

1268
01:16:39,205 --> 01:16:43,045
Speaker 8:  that's what I would focus on is you don't need this. Right?

1269
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:46,645
Speaker 8:  Like yeah, the Gmail app runs everywhere. Why doesn't Xbox run

1270
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:50,445
Speaker 8:  everywhere? Well, it's because Apple won't let it. Like what are the number

1271
01:16:50,465 --> 01:16:53,885
Speaker 8:  of things we can see in this industry that basically don't happen

1272
01:16:54,155 --> 01:16:57,325
Speaker 8:  because Apple won't let that happen on the iPhone. Like for lock thinking,

1273
01:16:57,395 --> 01:17:01,285
Speaker 8:  blah, blah. There's a lot. And I, I think the funny thing

1274
01:17:01,285 --> 01:17:04,485
Speaker 8:  is all those victims are also companies. The DOJ is suing.

1275
01:17:05,555 --> 01:17:09,180
Speaker 8:  Like, like Google is like writing out lists of the bare villain. Villain.

1276
01:17:09,435 --> 01:17:12,725
Speaker 8:  Meta is in that list. They're a villain. So I think it's gonna be much more

1277
01:17:12,725 --> 01:17:15,285
Speaker 8:  about painting Apple as a villain rather than trying to find a victim.

1278
01:17:16,205 --> 01:17:16,325
Speaker 2:  Hmm.

1279
01:17:16,745 --> 01:17:17,165
Speaker 4:  That's

1280
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:06,925
Speaker 4:  we're back. We're gonna do an actual lightning round. Yes. Because NELI is

1281
01:20:06,925 --> 01:20:10,885
Speaker 4:  not not here. So we can do this quickly as we like to do from time to time.

1282
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:14,805
Speaker 4:  NELI, by the way, If, you see him on the beach somewhere in Mexico?

1283
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:19,285
Speaker 4:  Pour him a tequila shot. He'll like that very much. Yes. All right, let's

1284
01:20:19,285 --> 01:20:22,205
Speaker 4:  do, we're gonna do two things each because there's been a lot of like little

1285
01:20:22,205 --> 01:20:23,885
Speaker 4:  news, so let's just bounce through some of it and then we'll get outta here.

1286
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:24,685
Speaker 4:  You go first. What do you got?

1287
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:28,805
Speaker 5:  All right. First up, YouTube is, is is bringing

1288
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:31,885
Speaker 5:  their multiview that they do for sports and stuff. They're bringing it to

1289
01:20:31,885 --> 01:20:34,245
Speaker 5:  the iPad and iOS, which is very exciting.

1290
01:20:34,265 --> 01:20:37,685
Speaker 4:  Oh wait, really? Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. I think

1291
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:42,165
Speaker 4:  one of the hot takes I've developed recently is that split screen is a thing

1292
01:20:42,165 --> 01:20:45,285
Speaker 4:  that should exist in every app on every device. Yes. For everything all the

1293
01:20:45,285 --> 01:20:49,205
Speaker 4:  time. Yes. Like the more I use it on like the, the Samsung phones or the

1294
01:20:49,205 --> 01:20:52,405
Speaker 4:  pixels where they're getting better at sort of letting you drag apps up and

1295
01:20:52,405 --> 01:20:55,165
Speaker 4:  down. It's just great. It's, it's such a, and all the arguments are like,

1296
01:20:55,165 --> 01:20:58,125
Speaker 4:  oh, the screen's too small. You don't, no, screw that. My phone's enormous.

1297
01:20:58,465 --> 01:20:59,605
Speaker 4:  Let me look at two apps. Yeah,

1298
01:20:59,965 --> 01:21:02,885
Speaker 5:  They aren't the only ones doing multiview. The other MULTIVIEW news this

1299
01:21:02,885 --> 01:21:06,685
Speaker 5:  week was from Peacock, which is gonna be doing multiview up to four streams

1300
01:21:06,785 --> 01:21:10,725
Speaker 5:  for the Olympics. And then they are planning to have that stick around

1301
01:21:10,725 --> 01:21:14,005
Speaker 5:  for sports, maybe even like scripted content. So you can watch

1302
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:18,165
Speaker 5:  Below deck on like four streams at once. If, you wanted to theoretically

1303
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:21,005
Speaker 5:  and that's, I wouldn't want to,

1304
01:21:21,265 --> 01:21:25,245
Speaker 4:  So there's this sports podcast I listen to shout out to the Bill

1305
01:21:25,245 --> 01:21:28,085
Speaker 4:  Simmons podcast and he always talks about

1306
01:21:29,015 --> 01:21:32,765
Speaker 4:  being able to watch basketball on one screen and movies

1307
01:21:32,905 --> 01:21:36,845
Speaker 4:  on another screen. And his argument is essentially if he like looks

1308
01:21:36,845 --> 01:21:39,685
Speaker 4:  over at the movie and it's a good part, he'll flip the volume to that and

1309
01:21:39,685 --> 01:21:41,845
Speaker 4:  just like watch it for a few minutes. Or if the game goes to commercials.

1310
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:45,485
Speaker 4:  And I used to think that was ridiculous. And now every single time he mentions

1311
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:48,485
Speaker 4:  it, I'm my God, that sounds awesome. Yeah. Like one thing hits commercials,

1312
01:21:48,485 --> 01:21:52,065
Speaker 4:  you just flip to the other one, go back and forth. You're like, oh, well

1313
01:21:52,105 --> 01:21:54,465
Speaker 4:  I don't care about the next five minutes of this dads, I'm gonna watch 10

1314
01:21:54,465 --> 01:21:56,385
Speaker 4:  minutes of The Godfather. Like that rules. Yeah. The

1315
01:21:56,385 --> 01:21:58,985
Speaker 5:  Cool dads in the nineties, they just did that. They just had like picture

1316
01:21:59,005 --> 01:22:02,825
Speaker 5:  and picture and for some reason computers were like, we can do that,

1317
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:03,945
Speaker 5:  but we're not gonna,

1318
01:22:04,165 --> 01:22:07,745
Speaker 4:  Or the back button on a TV remote A plus choice.

1319
01:22:07,935 --> 01:22:10,785
Speaker 4:  Yeah. YouTube TV should have this, but they should have it for everything.

1320
01:22:10,785 --> 01:22:13,105
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I should just be able to have four screens of whatever the hell I wanna

1321
01:22:13,105 --> 01:22:14,745
Speaker 4:  watch at any time. And Peacock

1322
01:22:14,895 --> 01:22:18,825
Speaker 5:  Important is gonna work on every everywhere. So it's not just gonna, it's

1323
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:21,265
Speaker 5:  gonna work on the apps, it's gonna work in the smart tv. Like they're rolling

1324
01:22:21,265 --> 01:22:22,545
Speaker 5:  it out across the board, not

1325
01:22:22,545 --> 01:22:25,225
Speaker 4:  Just, I say I love that you're a peacock convert now. I I'm a peacock convert.

1326
01:22:25,225 --> 01:22:29,185
Speaker 4:  We should disclose here now. NBC Universal, which is a, a division

1327
01:22:29,185 --> 01:22:33,105
Speaker 4:  of Comcast, is a minority investor in Vox Media. NELI

1328
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:36,785
Speaker 4:  will happily come home from Mexico and tell you that he executive produced

1329
01:22:36,865 --> 01:22:39,185
Speaker 4:  a show for Netflix called The future of It's very good. Everybody should

1330
01:22:39,185 --> 01:22:42,905
Speaker 4:  watch it. Alex loves Peacock now, apparently. Yeah. I have always loved Peacock.

1331
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:46,905
Speaker 4:  You think Netflix is gonna die. Which is weird. It's on a 40.

1332
01:22:46,935 --> 01:22:47,225
Speaker 5:  It's

1333
01:22:47,285 --> 01:22:48,065
Speaker 4:  On 40. That's enough.

1334
01:22:48,415 --> 01:22:51,265
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's, I didn't say 90. Like it's gonna die eventually. Everything

1335
01:22:51,265 --> 01:22:51,505
Speaker 5:  does.

1336
01:22:52,495 --> 01:22:53,025
Speaker 4:  It's beautiful.

1337
01:22:54,645 --> 01:22:57,585
Speaker 4:  All right. My first one is, which one of these do I wanna do first?

1338
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:02,465
Speaker 4:  Let's talk about Beeper. So we mentioned Beeper a few minutes ago as one

1339
01:23:02,465 --> 01:23:05,925
Speaker 4:  of the apps that has actually become like embroiled in this whole Apple

1340
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:10,085
Speaker 4:  antitrust saga gave up on the idea of trying to replace iMessage.

1341
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:13,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Which good idea. Someday you might be able to, but that's a

1342
01:23:13,965 --> 01:23:17,485
Speaker 4:  very long time from now. And it's just back to building like a kick ass cross

1343
01:23:17,765 --> 01:23:21,525
Speaker 4:  platform messaging app. Which rules? They just rolled out a new app for Android

1344
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:25,365
Speaker 4:  in, I think it's in public beta now. Okay. It's really good. Is it?

1345
01:23:25,555 --> 01:23:29,485
Speaker 4:  It's like the thing that they got back to, which I appreciate is

1346
01:23:29,485 --> 01:23:32,925
Speaker 4:  they're like, what if we just took Signal and WhatsApp and your Instagram

1347
01:23:33,225 --> 01:23:37,165
Speaker 4:  dms and LinkedIn and XI think still works. even that,

1348
01:23:37,165 --> 01:23:39,805
Speaker 4:  that API has been weird. I could be wrong. I'm not sure. I haven't used that

1349
01:23:39,825 --> 01:23:43,565
Speaker 4:  in a long time. So don't believe anything I say about X. Yeah. But basically

1350
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:47,085
Speaker 4:  all the messages you get and just sort of put them all into one Organizable

1351
01:23:47,135 --> 01:23:50,645
Speaker 4:  inbox. That makes sense. Which with or without SMS and I message

1352
01:23:51,445 --> 01:23:52,405
Speaker 4:  terrifically used service.

1353
01:23:52,405 --> 01:23:52,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1354
01:23:52,725 --> 01:23:56,085
Speaker 4:  I want that. And the app is, has always been like a little

1355
01:23:57,015 --> 01:24:00,965
Speaker 4:  funky at times. More janky. It's, it's sort of just built on

1356
01:24:00,965 --> 01:24:04,805
Speaker 4:  a series of elaborate hacks. Yeah. But they're getting very good at it

1357
01:24:04,805 --> 01:24:08,045
Speaker 4:  now. And the new app is really nice. So If, you use Beeper and are on Android

1358
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:12,325
Speaker 4:  It Rules and it is the rare app that is way better on Android than

1359
01:24:12,325 --> 01:24:15,925
Speaker 4:  on iOS. So for all the Android using Verge staffers and Vergecast listeners,

1360
01:24:16,155 --> 01:24:17,245
Speaker 4:  this is a victory for You. Don't

1361
01:24:17,245 --> 01:24:21,125
Speaker 5:  Worry. I'm gonna wait till 20, 20, 30 maybe

1362
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:23,085
Speaker 5:  2032 it sounds like. And and I'll have this app too.

1363
01:24:23,085 --> 01:24:26,045
Speaker 4:  There you go. Dude. The messaging app is about to get, or the messaging app

1364
01:24:26,045 --> 01:24:29,485
Speaker 4:  world in general is about to get real weird. Yeah. WhatsApp is doing the

1365
01:24:29,485 --> 01:24:32,525
Speaker 4:  thing where it's interoperating, the EU is forcing everybody to interoperate.

1366
01:24:32,915 --> 01:24:36,365
Speaker 4:  Like it's gonna get very strange. But I think in mostly really good ways

1367
01:24:36,385 --> 01:24:39,125
Speaker 4:  you're gonna be able to just like get all your messages, all the places,

1368
01:24:39,215 --> 01:24:40,885
Speaker 4:  which is how this should have worked forever.

1369
01:24:41,225 --> 01:24:45,045
Speaker 5:  So the 2002 is gonna come back, but instead of like Adio

1370
01:24:45,045 --> 01:24:47,525
Speaker 5:  and whatever the Windows version of that was called, start with a T.

1371
01:24:48,485 --> 01:24:49,125
Speaker 4:  Trillion. Trillion,

1372
01:24:49,155 --> 01:24:49,645
Speaker 5:  That was it.

1373
01:24:49,885 --> 01:24:50,965
Speaker 4:  There was also Pigeon. Oh yeah.

1374
01:24:51,015 --> 01:24:51,405
Speaker 5:  Which I,

1375
01:24:52,075 --> 01:24:55,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's good. Give, inject all those apps back into my van. Go just right

1376
01:24:55,635 --> 01:24:57,205
Speaker 4:  into your vans. All right. What's your second one?

1377
01:24:57,275 --> 01:25:01,205
Speaker 5:  Okay, my second one is, Allison wrote a really cute piece this

1378
01:25:01,205 --> 01:25:04,125
Speaker 5:  week and it just felt appropriate. We talked so much about super apps. I

1379
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:07,165
Speaker 5:  kind of think SGO Mini is like a super app, but for babies

1380
01:25:09,925 --> 01:25:11,625
Speaker 4:  Now we're talking. Tell me so much more.

1381
01:25:13,215 --> 01:25:17,185
Speaker 5:  Well, you know, she, she, she was like, she, she compared it

1382
01:25:17,185 --> 01:25:20,905
Speaker 5:  to, to like Blippy but not Blippy. Oh. She was just like, it gives

1383
01:25:21,065 --> 01:25:24,625
Speaker 5:  a bunch of little games that kids can play. It's all in one place.

1384
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:28,025
Speaker 5:  They're all like good games for small children, for babies.

1385
01:25:29,065 --> 01:25:31,745
Speaker 5:  'cause she has a baby like two years of babies. Right.

1386
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:35,985
Speaker 4:  You said super app for babies. And I started imagining like my 15 month

1387
01:25:35,985 --> 01:25:39,625
Speaker 4:  old son running around being like, I got Goodnight Moon in here. I got a

1388
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:43,385
Speaker 4:  bunch of trucks in here. Ah, sick Honey Nut Cheerios. Got that in here.

1389
01:25:43,935 --> 01:25:44,665
Speaker 5:  Like I can message

1390
01:25:44,725 --> 01:25:47,905
Speaker 4:  My mom. Yeah. The rules. I'm into this. It's, it's

1391
01:25:47,905 --> 01:25:51,465
Speaker 5:  Not quite their yet. I don't know if that's their, that's 2.0 Yeah. That,

1392
01:25:51,465 --> 01:25:54,665
Speaker 5:  yeah. I don't know if that's actually their ambitions, but it feature

1393
01:25:54,665 --> 01:25:55,305
Speaker 4:  Cheerios like

1394
01:25:55,305 --> 01:25:58,185
Speaker 5:  That's, they, they, it's, it's a lot of structured games and it's for, it's

1395
01:25:58,185 --> 01:26:01,585
Speaker 5:  for really small children instead of, because like If, you go on YouTube

1396
01:26:01,685 --> 01:26:05,285
Speaker 5:  If, you go to to the app store and you try to find

1397
01:26:05,855 --> 01:26:08,915
Speaker 5:  games for babies, you'll have a time

1398
01:26:09,775 --> 01:26:13,675
Speaker 4:  Oh, it's a mess. Yeah. It's a total mess. And I will say this is, I'm, I'm

1399
01:26:13,675 --> 01:26:17,435
Speaker 4:  glad you brought this up because we get a surprising amount of emails

1400
01:26:17,735 --> 01:26:20,995
Speaker 4:  and calls to the hotline basically all asking

1401
01:26:21,205 --> 01:26:24,315
Speaker 4:  variations of the same question, which is just like, what do I do with my

1402
01:26:24,335 --> 01:26:28,075
Speaker 4:  kid on screens and devices and computers? 'cause we're like

1403
01:26:28,575 --> 01:26:32,395
Speaker 4:  at this point where I, when kids are like, I don't know, eight.

1404
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:35,955
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You have to start having like a really real series of complicated conversations

1405
01:26:35,955 --> 01:26:39,195
Speaker 4:  about like what it means to use the internet younger than that. It's just

1406
01:26:39,595 --> 01:26:43,345
Speaker 4:  like, I I I'm just gonna plant you in front of something and something's

1407
01:26:43,345 --> 01:26:47,065
Speaker 4:  gonna happen. But this question of like, is YouTube kids a safe place to

1408
01:26:47,065 --> 01:26:50,265
Speaker 4:  be is increasingly kind of fraught because there's all kinds of weird stuff

1409
01:26:50,265 --> 01:26:52,705
Speaker 4:  on YouTube kids. Yeah. It gets weird and like there's been this stuff recently

1410
01:26:52,705 --> 01:26:55,945
Speaker 4:  with AI generated videos going in front of kids that is spooking a lot of

1411
01:26:55,945 --> 01:26:58,985
Speaker 4:  people I think for totally good reasons. So there's this sense of like,

1412
01:27:00,055 --> 01:27:03,705
Speaker 4:  what is the right call here? And we're having all these complicated que discussions

1413
01:27:03,705 --> 01:27:06,865
Speaker 4:  about screen time and what it means to be put in front of these devices.

1414
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:10,505
Speaker 4:  And so for stuff like this that's just like cool, silly,

1415
01:27:10,885 --> 01:27:14,345
Speaker 4:  low stakes, fun stuff. Like Yeah. There's so little of that in

1416
01:27:14,725 --> 01:27:16,665
Speaker 4:  the world right now. I honestly, I'm very glad,

1417
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:20,265
Speaker 5:  I wish I'd known about this before all of this because

1418
01:27:20,655 --> 01:27:23,465
Speaker 5:  when I saw my, my godson recently, I was like, I don't know what to do. And

1419
01:27:23,465 --> 01:27:26,025
Speaker 5:  like pulled up one of those videos where like the squirrel eats nuts that's

1420
01:27:26,065 --> 01:27:29,865
Speaker 5:  supposed to distract cats. And I was like, does this work for a

1421
01:27:29,865 --> 01:27:30,865
Speaker 5:  6-year-old? It doesn't

1422
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:34,625
Speaker 4:  It I bet. I bet it doesn't. I will say I found an hour long video that's

1423
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:38,545
Speaker 4:  just people feeding red pandas and you know

1424
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:42,105
Speaker 4:  who that super worked for is both me and my son. Yeah. We sat like

1425
01:27:42,335 --> 01:27:44,865
Speaker 4:  wrapped in front of that thing for an entire hour.

1426
01:27:44,865 --> 01:27:47,545
Speaker 5:  Like you watch those animals eat and you're like, wow, look at them. Go,

1427
01:27:47,575 --> 01:27:49,585
Speaker 5:  yeah, that's great. I wanna do that. It was,

1428
01:27:49,845 --> 01:27:53,025
Speaker 4:  Oh it was so nice. I have known notes. My son's also very into trains,

1429
01:27:53,925 --> 01:27:57,305
Speaker 4:  so we just watch a lot of videos. I just wanna say there is a, there is a

1430
01:27:57,325 --> 01:28:01,025
Speaker 4:  man on the internet who just makes hour

1431
01:28:01,095 --> 01:28:04,945
Speaker 4:  long videos of trains. Yeah. And it just cuts from train to

1432
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:08,185
Speaker 4:  train and he travels the world and does all the trains. His name is Mike

1433
01:28:08,295 --> 01:28:11,585
Speaker 4:  something and I love him. He, you are my favorite.

1434
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:13,545
Speaker 4:  Let's be friends.

1435
01:28:14,265 --> 01:28:16,225
Speaker 5:  I love a train guy. I love a train guy.

1436
01:28:16,325 --> 01:28:19,985
Speaker 4:  And they all have like 10 million views. Yeah. Which is so funny. Yeah, it's

1437
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:24,425
Speaker 4:  great. Alright, my second one is that I saw the Humane

1438
01:28:24,655 --> 01:28:28,505
Speaker 4:  pin this morning. Ooh. This is the reason I'm in New York. What? So

1439
01:28:28,505 --> 01:28:29,225
Speaker 4:  the Humane pin is coming out

1440
01:28:30,465 --> 01:28:32,755
Speaker 5:  Someday. We waited until now.

1441
01:28:33,305 --> 01:28:37,035
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We have two to three more hours of this to do. Yes. Get ready

1442
01:28:37,135 --> 01:28:40,955
Speaker 4:  and a Humane put out a video yesterday Wednesday

1443
01:28:41,665 --> 01:28:45,475
Speaker 4:  that I think was the single most useful piece of content Humane

1444
01:28:45,475 --> 01:28:48,555
Speaker 4:  has ever published. Okay. It's like almost 20 minutes long. And they're basically

1445
01:28:48,555 --> 01:28:52,195
Speaker 4:  just like, here's what the AI pin is, here's what it does and here's how

1446
01:28:52,195 --> 01:28:55,435
Speaker 4:  it works. Okay. Very helpful. And then I got to go see it this morning and

1447
01:28:55,435 --> 01:28:59,315
Speaker 4:  talk to Iran and Bethany, the co-founders of the company spent like 90 minutes

1448
01:28:59,425 --> 01:29:03,085
Speaker 4:  just like goofing around with the thing. I still have

1449
01:29:03,155 --> 01:29:06,005
Speaker 4:  lots of questions. We're gonna get to review it at some point. I'm very excited

1450
01:29:06,005 --> 01:29:08,605
Speaker 4:  about it, but I actually got to like, hold the thing in my hand and use it.

1451
01:29:08,665 --> 01:29:12,565
Speaker 4:  And I will say I have, I have said a lot of mean things about the AI

1452
01:29:12,585 --> 01:29:16,565
Speaker 4:  pin on this podcast. It's a very cool piece of technology. Is it

1453
01:29:16,605 --> 01:29:20,525
Speaker 4:  a good product that is worth the money? I, no, I just still feels like

1454
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:23,325
Speaker 4:  probably not, but like they made the thing like it works.

1455
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:27,725
Speaker 5:  I wanna point out, I I, I'm now a Peacock fan and

1456
01:29:27,725 --> 01:29:28,325
Speaker 5:  you're now, oh

1457
01:29:28,325 --> 01:29:29,485
Speaker 4:  My God, what have we become? Well

1458
01:29:29,485 --> 01:29:30,765
Speaker 5:  Who are we? Like I know NELI goes

1459
01:29:30,895 --> 01:29:31,605
Speaker 4:  Tonik Nico

1460
01:29:31,915 --> 01:29:32,925
Speaker 5:  Hate. Oh my God.

1461
01:29:32,925 --> 01:29:35,565
Speaker 4:  This is where we are. This is life now. Every, but no, I, I'm actually very

1462
01:29:35,565 --> 01:29:38,485
Speaker 4:  excited about it because we're, we're in this phase now where we're gonna

1463
01:29:38,485 --> 01:29:42,205
Speaker 4:  get the Humane AI pin and then I think sometime like in

1464
01:29:42,215 --> 01:29:45,725
Speaker 4:  weeks, not months later, we're gonna get the Rabbit R one. Yeah. And then

1465
01:29:45,725 --> 01:29:48,485
Speaker 4:  there's also this company Brilliant Labs, which makes the frame glasses.

1466
01:29:48,785 --> 01:29:52,525
Speaker 4:  And I was talking to their CEO yesterday, they're about to ship in April.

1467
01:29:53,265 --> 01:29:57,125
Speaker 4:  And so we're getting this first run of like, real

1468
01:29:57,185 --> 01:30:01,045
Speaker 4:  honest to God AI gadgets. Yes. And it's gonna be really

1469
01:30:01,285 --> 01:30:04,005
Speaker 4:  interesting. And we're like, the big question is basically like,

1470
01:30:05,545 --> 01:30:09,405
Speaker 4:  are any of these better than a smartphone? Do I need this if I have

1471
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:13,045
Speaker 4:  a smartphone? Shouldn't these have just been smartphone apps? Like super

1472
01:30:13,185 --> 01:30:16,125
Speaker 4:  fun, interesting questions. Like what does a smartphone mean in my life?

1473
01:30:16,225 --> 01:30:20,005
Speaker 4:  Is I think like a big question of 2024 for a lot of people. It certainly

1474
01:30:20,005 --> 01:30:23,685
Speaker 4:  has been for me so far. And like, I'm just very excited to try all of these

1475
01:30:23,685 --> 01:30:27,125
Speaker 4:  gadgets and just playing with the pen, it was like, okay, I have big questions

1476
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:30,925
Speaker 4:  about how this fits into my life. And whether, yeah, $700 and a pretty

1477
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:34,755
Speaker 4:  expensive monthly subscription is a pretty steep

1478
01:30:34,755 --> 01:30:38,275
Speaker 4:  price tag that this thing meets TBD. But like

1479
01:30:38,615 --> 01:30:41,555
Speaker 4:  how did it feel? The thing works, it feels really good. Does it just from

1480
01:30:41,555 --> 01:30:45,275
Speaker 4:  like a pure, like they made a gadget thing,

1481
01:30:45,735 --> 01:30:48,395
Speaker 4:  it just feels good. It hits, got a charging case that feels like one of those

1482
01:30:48,395 --> 01:30:52,155
Speaker 4:  sort of worry stones and has a really nice hinge. Like it's, it's made

1483
01:30:52,255 --> 01:30:55,315
Speaker 4:  by people who love hardware in a way that I very much appreciate. Did they

1484
01:30:55,315 --> 01:30:58,675
Speaker 4:  make a good product? I don't know, but boy did they make a cool thing that

1485
01:30:58,735 --> 01:31:02,435
Speaker 4:  I'm like the laser projector. I'm so spectacularly

1486
01:31:02,465 --> 01:31:06,395
Speaker 4:  unconvinced by. Yeah. But it's kind of fun to like do the thing

1487
01:31:06,395 --> 01:31:09,835
Speaker 4:  and you like tip your hand forward to scroll down and it's like deeply silly.

1488
01:31:09,935 --> 01:31:11,675
Speaker 4:  but it was kind of fun. I

1489
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,435
Speaker 5:  Loved watching you do this just now.

1490
01:31:13,455 --> 01:31:16,275
Speaker 4:  That's literally what you do. You hold it up and it's like kind of right

1491
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:19,835
Speaker 4:  at this level. And then If, you wanna scroll down, you literally just tilt

1492
01:31:19,835 --> 01:31:22,555
Speaker 4:  your hand towards you. So, and If, you wanna scroll up, you tilt your hand

1493
01:31:22,555 --> 01:31:26,075
Speaker 4:  away like a segue and you, and then you click to click. It's, it's a, it's

1494
01:31:26,075 --> 01:31:29,995
Speaker 4:  a hand segue. It's a, it's a virtual segue

1495
01:31:30,575 --> 01:31:31,875
Speaker 4:  for your poem. Yeah,

1496
01:31:32,015 --> 01:31:34,755
Speaker 5:  Of course. That's how they actually marketing pitched it to everyone

1497
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:38,515
Speaker 4:  Market. Yeah. That's perfect. But yeah, I, I suspect if, if Humane is

1498
01:31:38,685 --> 01:31:42,475
Speaker 4:  right about when it's gonna ship, that should happen very soon. They've been

1499
01:31:42,475 --> 01:31:45,595
Speaker 4:  saying like, end of March, it was supposed to be earlier in March. They've

1500
01:31:45,595 --> 01:31:48,155
Speaker 4:  been saying end of March, I think into April potentially.

1501
01:31:49,535 --> 01:31:52,395
Speaker 4:  So like all of this is happening and we've been talking about these gadgets

1502
01:31:52,395 --> 01:31:55,075
Speaker 4:  for months. Yeah. And we're actually gonna get to like, use them in the world

1503
01:31:55,495 --> 01:31:56,355
Speaker 4:  and I'm very excited about

1504
01:31:56,355 --> 01:31:57,515
Speaker 5:  It. I am so excited for you.

1505
01:31:57,515 --> 01:32:00,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's gonna be good stuff. I'm so excited. My goal is for my review

1506
01:32:00,505 --> 01:32:04,485
Speaker 4:  of the AI pin to be longer than Eli's 8,500

1507
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:05,725
Speaker 4:  word review of the Vision Pro.

1508
01:32:06,345 --> 01:32:06,845
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna put

1509
01:32:06,845 --> 01:32:07,925
Speaker 4:  A, I'm really excited. Word

1510
01:32:07,925 --> 01:32:09,645
Speaker 5:  Count. Like maximum long.

1511
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:13,285
Speaker 4:  Just close the Google doc. Yeah. At 2,500 words. That feels right. Yeah.

1512
01:32:13,685 --> 01:32:17,005
Speaker 4:  Alright. We have gone on way too long. We've had a great time as we are want

1513
01:32:17,005 --> 01:32:19,325
Speaker 4:  to do this has been very fun. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for doing this. Thanks

1514
01:32:19,345 --> 01:32:22,125
Speaker 4:  to Lauren for being here. She's lovely. Meli for joining from the beach.

1515
01:32:23,065 --> 01:32:27,005
Speaker 4:  We are also going to be talking so much about this. Like, I

1516
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:30,605
Speaker 4:  think it's, it's gonna be a weird case because it's going to ebb and flow

1517
01:32:30,605 --> 01:32:34,285
Speaker 4:  pretty aggressively. Like, I think my guess would be that we're gonna have

1518
01:32:34,325 --> 01:32:37,925
Speaker 4:  a bunch more news in the next few days as reactions start to come in and

1519
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:40,885
Speaker 4:  we start to get more reporting on what people are thinking and where some

1520
01:32:40,885 --> 01:32:43,125
Speaker 4:  of this evidence comes from. And who are the other companies that are being

1521
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,845
Speaker 4:  kind of obliquely referred to in the complaint.

1522
01:32:46,385 --> 01:32:48,365
Speaker 4:  Big lull. Like big lull.

1523
01:33:20,525 --> 01:33:22,125
Speaker 5:  a cool, a regular smartphone.

1524
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:23,565
Speaker 4:  It's a cool smartphone. It's

1525
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:24,365
Speaker 5:  A cool smartphone.
