Description: This episode is all about companies in flux. First, we chat with The Verge's Alex Heath about all things Meta — whether the company is still serious about the metaverse, why its AI plans seem to be going so well, what "OG Facebook" really means, and what headsets to expect this year. After that, The Verge's Chris Welch takes us through the last year at Sonos, from the disastrous app launch to the pretty good headphones that were totally derailed by the disastrous app launch. Can the company get it together in order to launch its next big swing, a set-top box codenamed Pinewood? Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline all about business cards. Because, yes, it's 2025, but sometimes you still need a place to put a business card.

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,635
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of completely

3
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:10,635
Speaker 2:  unnecessary corporate pivots. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I have a

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:14,435
Speaker 2:  new webcam. This will not be interesting to anyone who is just listening

5
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:18,075
Speaker 2:  to this show, which is most of you, but if you're watching this on YouTube,

6
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:21,955
Speaker 2:  you'll notice frankly that I look both hopefully better

7
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:26,035
Speaker 2:  and probably slightly worse. So I've had this Sony

8
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:29,675
Speaker 2:  Zv one lying around for a while. I got it with the intention of

9
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:33,475
Speaker 2:  upgrading my video conferencing and podcast video setup.

10
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:37,795
Speaker 2:  But it turns out that whenever you introduce like an actual camera to your

11
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:41,235
Speaker 2:  system, it makes everything more annoying. There are more things you have

12
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:43,955
Speaker 2:  to turn on and off. There are more systems you have to figure out. There's

13
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:47,595
Speaker 2:  more really awful Sony software that you have to download. And so

14
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:51,195
Speaker 2:  most of the time I just end up using a webcam like this one, just a normal

15
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:55,075
Speaker 2:  Insta 360 webcam. But then recently I was like, okay,

16
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:59,515
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna try and upgrade and see if I can make myself look a little better.

17
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:03,475
Speaker 2:  So in a certain way, this camera is a huge improvement, but it also only

18
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:07,595
Speaker 2:  does seven 20 P when you're using it as a webcam, which it's 2025.

19
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:11,115
Speaker 2:  That's ridiculous. So we're trying this out. We'll see how it goes. And if

20
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:14,475
Speaker 2:  you're wondering why it's nighttime behind me, that's because it's nighttime

21
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,435
Speaker 2:  behind me. And this at this point is the only time I

22
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:22,235
Speaker 2:  have to endlessly mess with my desktop setup. 'cause during the day, I have

23
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:25,515
Speaker 2:  to like, you know, work like a real person. It's awful. I don't recommend

24
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:28,595
Speaker 2:  it. Anyway, that is not what we're here to talk about today. On the show,

25
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,235
Speaker 2:  we are going to do two things. First, we're gonna talk about Meta,

26
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:36,355
Speaker 2:  which is a company very much in transition. This is

27
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:40,115
Speaker 2:  a company called Meta who seems to be interested in lots of other

28
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:43,595
Speaker 2:  things and not the Metaverse. So we're gonna talk about that. We're gonna

29
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:47,515
Speaker 2:  talk about how the company has changed internally and externally, and

30
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:51,555
Speaker 2:  what 2025 holds for the company as well. Then we're gonna

31
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:55,075
Speaker 2:  talk about Sonos, which is actually a company in a similar

32
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:58,755
Speaker 2:  spot after a year full of a huge number of

33
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:02,515
Speaker 2:  self-inflicted wounds around the app and the ACE

34
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:06,435
Speaker 2:  headphones and the way that it responded to the app and to the launch of

35
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:10,395
Speaker 2:  the Ace headphones. Sonos is just in a weird place, but I

36
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:14,115
Speaker 2:  think the company is actually kind of unusual and interesting,

37
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,235
Speaker 2:  and we've talked about it a ton on this show, but I thought it might be good

38
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:21,115
Speaker 2:  to just try and tell the whole story all at once and see

39
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:24,715
Speaker 2:  if we can figure out what it means. We also have a hotline on a sort of unusual

40
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:27,115
Speaker 2:  topic, which is a thing I have not thought about in a while, which is fun.

41
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:31,395
Speaker 2:  And we're gonna get to all of that in just a second. But

42
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:35,635
Speaker 2:  first, I feel like I'm like zoomed in a little too far. And now

43
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:38,955
Speaker 2:  I'm going to spend just an outrageous amount of time mucking around in the

44
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:42,875
Speaker 2:  camera settings, trying to make all this work. This is The Vergecast. We'll

45
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,195
Speaker 2:  be right back.

46
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:19,435
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Let's talk about Meta first because I think

47
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:23,635
Speaker 2:  If you look at the sweep of the tech industry right now, whether

48
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:27,275
Speaker 2:  you wanna talk about technology in general or AI

49
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:31,275
Speaker 2:  specifically or how tech and politics or interacting,

50
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,595
Speaker 2:  I think you could argue that Meta is the single most central company

51
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:39,515
Speaker 2:  in all of that right now. Whether you wanna talk about the future of social

52
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:42,835
Speaker 2:  and what it means for us to be people online in this information ecosystem,

53
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:46,755
Speaker 2:  or you just wanna talk about like AI glasses and the metaverse and

54
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,915
Speaker 2:  whatever. But at the same time, this company seems to be changing.

55
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:54,755
Speaker 2:  They've changed a lot of content policies recently. Mark Zuckerberg went

56
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:58,475
Speaker 2:  on Joe Rogan's podcast and talked about needing more masculine energy at

57
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:02,395
Speaker 2:  Meta. This company just feels like it is not going to be

58
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:05,755
Speaker 2:  the company we've known it to be for a very long time. And frankly, even

59
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:09,315
Speaker 2:  as Meta has changed a lot, I feel like we've been able to

60
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:13,515
Speaker 2:  sort of chart its path, but this feels like an inflection point and I just

61
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:17,075
Speaker 2:  wanna see if I can make sense of that. So I asked Alex Heath, who

62
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:20,915
Speaker 2:  Chronicles Meta and many others in his newsletter for The Verge called Command

63
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:24,715
Speaker 2:  Line. It's very good. You should subscribe. He is inside of Meta

64
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:28,395
Speaker 2:  in a way that very few people are and I figured could help us out. So let's

65
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:32,315
Speaker 2:  just dig into this. Alex Heath, welcome back to the show. Hey, it's

66
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,715
Speaker 2:  been a minute. Yeah, it has. We haven't done this in a little while. Yeah,

67
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:38,155
Speaker 2:  it's nice to see you again. Good to be back. I wanna talk about Meta

68
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:42,395
Speaker 2:  because there's been a lot going on with this company the last few months

69
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:46,555
Speaker 2:  and I've been thinking a lot in particular about a memo

70
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,755
Speaker 2:  that Andrew Bosworth sent about the Metaverse that I wanna talk about. That's

71
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,995
Speaker 2:  really fascinating. But it feels like you've been inside of a lot of these

72
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:56,035
Speaker 2:  meetings that the company's having, you've been reporting on a lot of the

73
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,365
Speaker 2:  goings on, they're very mad at you specifically about some of the leakers

74
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:03,125
Speaker 2:  that are going on. And I feel like Meta is in the middle of becoming

75
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:07,165
Speaker 2:  a very different kind of company than frankly, than it was

76
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:11,325
Speaker 2:  six months ago or three years ago, or like when it changed its name

77
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:15,005
Speaker 2:  to Meta. And I'm curious, like does it, does it feel

78
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,725
Speaker 2:  like this company is becoming something else right in front of our eyes right

79
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:18,845
Speaker 2:  now?

80
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:23,405
Speaker 8:  I'm not sure. I mean, I see what you're saying about becoming a different

81
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:27,325
Speaker 8:  company. I feel like Meta changes more than any of the other

82
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,045
Speaker 8:  big tech companies. Like it's definitely more chaotic. I think that's just

83
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:35,085
Speaker 8:  a function of Zuckerberg controlling the company and

84
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:38,275
Speaker 8:  it really being a, I would say,

85
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:41,315
Speaker 8:  imprint of his psyche at any given moment.

86
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:44,875
Speaker 2:  Fair. Yeah. He can get away with being chaotic because there's no one to

87
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,595
Speaker 2:  stop him really.

88
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:49,595
Speaker 8:  Right. And so, you know, it was interesting, I reported on this all

89
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:53,555
Speaker 8:  hands meeting that Zuckerberg had with employees a couple

90
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:57,315
Speaker 8:  weeks ago now, and I did a little word check

91
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,075
Speaker 8:  and he said the word metaverse once in an hour. Mm.

92
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:05,275
Speaker 8:  He said AI a lot and I think that's a pretty good

93
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:09,155
Speaker 8:  indicator of where things are at. But I don't actually

94
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:13,995
Speaker 8:  buy the external analysis that's out there

95
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,435
Speaker 8:  that this means they're giving up on the Metaverse stuff.

96
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:20,675
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting. Okay. Well so let me, lemme just read the bit of Bosworth's

97
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:24,595
Speaker 2:  memo that that has stuck in my brain and then I want you

98
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:28,275
Speaker 2:  to explain what you mean by that. So he, he

99
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:31,475
Speaker 2:  basically said it's going to be either quote the work of visionaries or a

100
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:34,795
Speaker 2:  legendary misadventure and then he said we had the best portfolio of products

101
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:37,315
Speaker 2:  we've ever had in market and are pushing our advantage by launching a half

102
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:41,235
Speaker 2:  dozen more AI powered wearables. We need to drive sales retention and engagement

103
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:44,515
Speaker 2:  across the board, but especially in Mr Fixed reality and Horizon World on

104
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:48,275
Speaker 2:  Mobile absolutely has to break out for our long-term plans to have a chance.

105
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:52,715
Speaker 2:  It was like literally like thi this is either, either we're geniuses or idiots

106
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:56,315
Speaker 2:  is like in his words the thing that they're using. And I, and I think you're

107
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:59,035
Speaker 2:  right that a lot of people took that to mean and obviously it's not gonna

108
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:01,875
Speaker 2:  work this year, so Meta's gonna be out on the metaverse and this is just

109
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,915
Speaker 2:  him setting the scene for that. Why do you think that's not what's going

110
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:04,315
Speaker 2:  on here?

111
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:09,175
Speaker 8:  Oh I think that's right. My point was more just that the AI

112
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:13,095
Speaker 8:  focus or pivot as some would say does not mean that

113
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:16,975
Speaker 8:  the Metaverse stuff is going away. I think Zuckerberg

114
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:20,295
Speaker 8:  actually used the phrase like Walk and chew gum at the same time in this

115
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:23,855
Speaker 8:  all hands meeting and they are still spending an

116
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,615
Speaker 8:  absurd amount of money on reality labs, which is the division

117
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:31,455
Speaker 8:  Bosworth who you just mentioned runs that bills all the metaverse stuff.

118
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:35,695
Speaker 8:  I think maybe it would be helpful to just like put that in context before

119
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:39,655
Speaker 8:  we talk about all the devices. Like please, I was looking through Meta's

120
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:42,895
Speaker 8:  filings with the SEC, their annual report.

121
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:47,895
Speaker 8:  They spent, well actually more specifically reality

122
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:51,855
Speaker 8:  Labs reduced their profit by nearly $18 billion last

123
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,520
Speaker 8:  year. Wow. That's a lot of money. And that keeps going up year after year.

124
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,485
Speaker 8:  That's more than Amazon paid for Whole Foods. It's more than three

125
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:03,565
Speaker 8:  x what OpenAI spent to run its entire company last year. Wow. Yeah.

126
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:07,565
Speaker 8:  It's the total market value of Snap the company is what they

127
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:09,165
Speaker 8:  spent on Reality Labs last year. They

128
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,285
Speaker 2:  Just lose a snap every year.

129
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:14,445
Speaker 8:  So to say that they're giving up on the metaverse, it doesn't bear out in

130
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:18,165
Speaker 8:  the numbers that they report to the SEC. And I thought another interesting

131
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:22,125
Speaker 8:  thing, I'm, I'm a, I'm a nerd about this stuff is

132
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:26,005
Speaker 8:  that they said in this report that this year they

133
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:29,485
Speaker 8:  expect to spend half of reality Labs is

134
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,285
Speaker 8:  spending on wearables, which is everything not Quest

135
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:38,165
Speaker 8:  and not Horizon. And historically they were spending

136
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:42,205
Speaker 8:  most on Quest. But what has happened in the last year or

137
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:46,125
Speaker 8:  two and something we reported out of that meeting that Zuckerberg had that

138
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,565
Speaker 8:  he disclosed for the first time is that the Met Ray Band glasses

139
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:53,765
Speaker 8:  are growing a lot faster than they anticipated. They've sold over 1 million

140
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:57,445
Speaker 8:  units of them, which isn't a lot in the grand scheme of the Quest, you know,

141
00:09:57,445 --> 00:10:01,365
Speaker 8:  the Quest sells millions of units a year, right? It's already at like what

142
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:05,045
Speaker 8:  a solid gaming console, you know, annual sales would be.

143
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:09,485
Speaker 8:  But they see a lot more potential and what the Raybans represent

144
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:13,205
Speaker 8:  because they see it as a much more mass consumer device

145
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:16,925
Speaker 8:  than the Quest which even despite their best attempts over the years

146
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,645
Speaker 8:  still remains a gadget for

147
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:23,565
Speaker 8:  teen boys and gamers. I would say mostly.

148
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,445
Speaker 2:  Do you think Meta's right to think that there's more mainstream potential

149
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:28,645
Speaker 2:  in the RayBan glasses?

150
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:30,245
Speaker 8:  I don't know. I think

151
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:35,565
Speaker 8:  they're easier to wear. You know, Meta knows internally that one of the

152
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:38,965
Speaker 8:  biggest barriers to adoption for the Quest has been that it's just not comfortable

153
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:42,085
Speaker 8:  and it doesn't look good when you wear it. It's not a thing you wear out.

154
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:45,405
Speaker 8:  Right. Right. Whereas Raybans are things that are, and the other glasses

155
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:48,525
Speaker 8:  are gonna do or designed to be worn out. They're designed to be used more

156
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:52,205
Speaker 8:  like you would use a phone. Whereas the quest and mixed reality, even with

157
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:55,845
Speaker 8:  the mixed stuff they're doing, it really is more of an isolating experience.

158
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:59,685
Speaker 8:  Something that you would use in your house. And I don't think

159
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:02,645
Speaker 8:  that's gonna change. I think if anything those two product lines will further

160
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:06,405
Speaker 8:  separate from each other before coming back together. I do think they will

161
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:09,365
Speaker 8:  come back together, but it may take like 10 years when the tech gets really

162
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:12,845
Speaker 8:  good enough. So yeah, that's kind of the state of where things are. And just

163
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:16,565
Speaker 8:  back to your original point, like are they changing? I think the change

164
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,975
Speaker 8:  is that the Ray Bands and Zuckerberg's

165
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:24,775
Speaker 8:  excitement about them and also his kind of obsession with everything

166
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:28,735
Speaker 8:  AI that they're doing and how that intersects with the Ray band specifically

167
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:32,575
Speaker 8:  has really shifted a lot of the attention and a lot of the spending into

168
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:33,575
Speaker 8:  the wearable segment.

169
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:37,135
Speaker 2:  Right. I do think though I, if I were to

170
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:41,695
Speaker 2:  Galaxy Brain all of this for a second, it seems like Meta has

171
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:45,855
Speaker 2:  been desperately trying to invent its own more or

172
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:49,655
Speaker 2:  less solely controlled platform for a very long time.

173
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:53,565
Speaker 2:  Right. It got, it got hosed by mobile in so, so many ways. And

174
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:57,645
Speaker 2:  well Apple's. Yeah, Apple's control. Well Mobile made Facebook but also like

175
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,485
Speaker 2:  Right. Kept it from making a lot more money than it could have. And Apple

176
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:03,085
Speaker 2:  has made Meta's life very hard in a number of ways over the years.

177
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,205
Speaker 8:  Poor Meta. They're only worth $2 trillion.

178
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:08,205
Speaker 2:  I know. It's gotta be awful honestly. Yeah. Like I feel bad for Mark and

179
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,085
Speaker 2:  his gold chains. But

180
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:14,445
Speaker 2:  so I think a, a real impetus for trying to make the Metaverse happen was

181
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,685
Speaker 2:  based on the assumption that okay, this is going to be the next platform

182
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:20,525
Speaker 2:  and we have to be the ones who make it. Like I think that's been very important

183
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:23,925
Speaker 2:  to this company. And I think If you squint a little at

184
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:28,245
Speaker 2:  the combination of Meta AI and the RayBan Smart

185
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:32,075
Speaker 2:  Glasses, there's a platform in there and that that maybe

186
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:35,195
Speaker 2:  what is happening is Mark Zuckerberg is looking and saying, okay, I can bet

187
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:39,475
Speaker 2:  many, many, many billions of dollars on this really expensive, really complicated

188
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:43,315
Speaker 2:  virtual world thing that is at best a ways away

189
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:47,315
Speaker 2:  and at worst just not interesting to most people. Or I can

190
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:51,075
Speaker 2:  invent this other platform that I sort of accidentally discovered

191
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,715
Speaker 2:  just by partnering with a cool company in Italy. And so like

192
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,635
Speaker 2:  that's where I'm like maybe, maybe the big thing that Meta needs

193
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:03,955
Speaker 2:  it thinks it can get out of this combination of AI and smart glasses is much

194
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,875
Speaker 2:  more quickly than it can get it out of the metaverse.

195
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:10,625
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I think the Metaverse is more of a grind. I think

196
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,425
Speaker 8:  if antitrust did not exist, if scrutiny of Meta did not exist, they

197
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:17,585
Speaker 8:  would've probably just like bought Roblox for an absurd amount of money right

198
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:20,345
Speaker 8:  now and made it horizon worlds. That's really what they want it to be.

199
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:23,505
Speaker 2:  That's such an interesting parallel universe in which that was allowed to

200
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:24,425
Speaker 2:  happen, right?

201
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:28,705
Speaker 8:  Like I think it would And the reason that Bosworth says in that

202
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:32,425
Speaker 8:  memo that Horizon has to work is that they can't just

203
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:36,345
Speaker 8:  have dumb hardware that doesn't have software. Right. The Ray

204
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:40,105
Speaker 8:  bands have the ai, the voice stuff, the camera, they have

205
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:43,985
Speaker 8:  utility. The Quest is a content device, it's an entertainment device,

206
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:48,105
Speaker 8:  an immersion device. And for Meta's business model,

207
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:51,945
Speaker 8:  which is ads, right? To really extend into the metaverse and eventually pay

208
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:55,905
Speaker 8:  for all this, they really need a social platform that is

209
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:59,905
Speaker 8:  embodied avatars that works in that kind of a context. And horizon is still

210
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,665
Speaker 8:  way behind, you know, it's still way behind where Roblox is way

211
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:07,025
Speaker 8:  behind where Epic is with its Fortnite kind of world building

212
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:11,225
Speaker 8:  experiment that it's earlier in than Roblox but making progress in.

213
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:16,225
Speaker 8:  So I mean he's right in that sense. Horizon needs to work, they need to have

214
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:20,145
Speaker 8:  their own social experience on this. They're just not there yet. Right.

215
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:22,185
Speaker 8:  I mean look, would a lot of companies,

216
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:27,525
Speaker 8:  you know much smaller than Medicare for having

217
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:30,885
Speaker 8:  something like the Quest? I don't know. I mean it sells millions of units

218
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:34,285
Speaker 8:  a year. They don't really make money on the hardware, but they are

219
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:39,285
Speaker 8:  seeding the world with millions of these devices. You

220
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:42,205
Speaker 8:  know, they're not very retentive devices. That's been a big problem though,

221
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:45,805
Speaker 8:  is that like, unless you're a gamer or like a young boy

222
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:49,925
Speaker 8:  who likes to troll people on in virtual reality, it's,

223
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:53,325
Speaker 8:  they're just really not something that people come back to. I'm also like

224
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,845
Speaker 8:  speaking from experience there, it's just not something that

225
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:59,685
Speaker 2:  Is Yeah. Mine's sitting right over there and I haven't picked it up in a

226
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,245
Speaker 2:  frustratingly long period of time.

227
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:04,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah. 'cause you don't have a really good reason to unless there's like a

228
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:07,525
Speaker 8:  game or something that you really wanna play. Whereas the Raybans are like,

229
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:10,285
Speaker 8:  these could actually just be your glasses. Right. And they actually just

230
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:14,125
Speaker 8:  upgrade what your glasses can do. Yeah. And you know, that's where

231
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,285
Speaker 8:  things get really interesting And you know, something that

232
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:21,485
Speaker 8:  Zuckerberg said in this recent all hands about that is that, you know,

233
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:25,205
Speaker 8:  this is going to be the year where basically they know

234
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:29,005
Speaker 8:  whether AI glasses as they now call them, instead of

235
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:32,565
Speaker 8:  AR glasses are going to be this next mass market

236
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,525
Speaker 8:  iPhone level thing based on the sales trajectory or whether it's going to

237
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:40,445
Speaker 8:  be in his own words, a grind. Interesting. And If you had

238
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:44,365
Speaker 8:  to describe Meta's entire hardware adventure over the last

239
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:47,645
Speaker 8:  10 years, it would definitely be a grind. So yes, they're prepared to keep

240
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:51,805
Speaker 8:  grinding, but I think, you know, this year it's a matter of whether,

241
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:55,725
Speaker 8:  look do the Ray Bands end the year it's 5 million sales, 10 million sales,

242
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,805
Speaker 8:  do the devices they're planning to ship, you know, later this year

243
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:03,805
Speaker 8:  really, you know, get people excited or do they flop? You know, that's the

244
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:06,245
Speaker 8:  stakes and I think he feels the stakes of that.

245
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:10,685
Speaker 8:  But you know, we have yet to see those devices. They're coming very soon.

246
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:14,245
Speaker 2:  What are those devices? You've scooped the roadmap so many times I've lost

247
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:17,885
Speaker 2:  track of what's coming and there's the Orion ones, which you saw Yeah

248
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,405
Speaker 2:  last year we talked about on the show. And those are not coming

249
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:25,685
Speaker 2:  this year. But something on the journey to that is coming this year. We think

250
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:25,765
Speaker 2:  that

251
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:29,425
Speaker 8:  Right? That's right. Yeah. Orion is not and Orion

252
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:32,985
Speaker 8:  itself what, and it was very clear on the writeup for us that it is not the

253
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:36,865
Speaker 8:  thing they're gonna ship a version that is like it will ship but it will

254
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:39,665
Speaker 8:  not ship until at least 2027 and it's gonna be very expensive. It's gonna

255
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,185
Speaker 8:  cost like what a decked out MacBook Pro costs.

256
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:47,785
Speaker 8:  What what is happening later this year is the first pair of

257
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:51,865
Speaker 8:  Meta designed glasses. So what they've done with

258
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,505
Speaker 8:  Ray Band and Luxottica to date, I think they've really rode the coattails

259
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:59,225
Speaker 8:  of that brand. And you know, Wayfairs are just this like super

260
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:02,025
Speaker 8:  classic cool classes design that everyone,

261
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:05,145
Speaker 2:  It does sort of feel like If you have access to Wayfairs, why would you,

262
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,465
Speaker 2:  why reinvent the wheel? Sure. Like, I don't know.

263
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,985
Speaker 8:  Well because they had already been building this device that

264
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:14,785
Speaker 8:  that the hardware takes a long time and this device was starting in the works

265
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:19,105
Speaker 8:  way before the, the Ray bands took off. It's called it's

266
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:22,345
Speaker 8:  Hyper Nova, it's gonna have a heads up display, it's basically their version

267
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:25,945
Speaker 8:  of Google Glass. It's going to be much better than what Glass was 10 years

268
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:29,745
Speaker 8:  ago. But it's gonna have the heads up display for things like showing

269
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,945
Speaker 8:  the photos you take incoming notifications, your interactions with Meta

270
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,945
Speaker 8:  ai getting some more visual feedback. They're gonna be pricey. I

271
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:41,665
Speaker 8:  wouldn't have be surprised if they're at least a thousand dollars. And the

272
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:45,105
Speaker 8:  stakes are that again, these are not designed as

273
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:49,325
Speaker 8:  raybans, they're Meta glasses and I think Luxotica will obviously play

274
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:52,605
Speaker 8:  a role in how they are distributed and maybe we'll do things like prescriptions

275
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:56,445
Speaker 8:  for them. But this is Meta's first real like shot at

276
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,325
Speaker 8:  can we do glasses ourselves from a societal

277
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:04,645
Speaker 8:  acceptance perspective? Right? Sure. And they're gonna be

278
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:08,085
Speaker 8:  pricey and they're gonna be an early adopter thing and if it ends up being

279
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:11,885
Speaker 8:  just a bad product, that's really not good for what Meta

280
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:15,605
Speaker 8:  is trying to do over the long run. And then they're also going to be doing

281
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:19,645
Speaker 8:  a lot more with Luxotica that I that I think while there's still risk there,

282
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:23,645
Speaker 8:  it's way less risky again because of the fact that Luxottica is

283
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:27,045
Speaker 8:  designing these things and Meta is basically just like the tech supplier.

284
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:31,445
Speaker 8:  So they're gonna do glasses with Oakley for athletes. I wouldn't

285
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:35,045
Speaker 8:  be surprised if we see, you know, Luxotica owns Supreme now would be surprised

286
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:37,645
Speaker 8:  if we see Supreme Glasses down the road. They're gonna do all kinds of these

287
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:41,365
Speaker 8:  glasses with Luxotica. But those are gonna be, you know, few hundred bucks

288
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:45,885
Speaker 8:  not ar at least to start. And then Hyper

289
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:50,045
Speaker 8:  Nova. And the reason Bosworth says in that memo, you know we're

290
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,325
Speaker 8:  gonna have half a dozen wearables this year is they're gonna have variants

291
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:56,365
Speaker 8:  of Hyper Nova but they're also gonna be finally shipping this thing that

292
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,765
Speaker 8:  I wrote about with Orion, which is their wristband. Which Oh right. Is

293
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:04,645
Speaker 8:  really one of the coolest pieces of technology I've used in a long time.

294
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:09,805
Speaker 8:  And I'm really interested to see how the world at large receives this

295
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:13,445
Speaker 8:  thing. It's how you controlled Orion and it's how you'll control

296
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:17,165
Speaker 8:  Hyper Nova these glasses later this year. And

297
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,565
Speaker 8:  it's uses EMG technology to basically

298
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:25,285
Speaker 8:  read your mind. They don't say that and that's not what's happening but it

299
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:28,965
Speaker 8:  feels that way. Yeah. Where you can, you know, do a very subtle

300
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:33,125
Speaker 8:  pinch gesture to click drag, that sort of stuff. Interact

301
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,525
Speaker 8:  like minority report style listing things. And it's the first time I've used

302
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:40,125
Speaker 8:  like a new input method and a really long time

303
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:44,125
Speaker 8:  that felt supernatural. I would put it on par with like,

304
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:47,245
Speaker 8:  you remember the first time you did eye tracking with the Vision Pro?

305
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:48,485
Speaker 2:  Sure, yeah.

306
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:52,045
Speaker 8:  Something like that where it's like wow, this is just a way more natural

307
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:56,045
Speaker 8:  way to interact with something. So that's gonna be really interesting

308
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:59,965
Speaker 8:  to see how that works with the glasses later this year. And it

309
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,365
Speaker 8:  will get people a taste of what's coming with the full fledged air glasses

310
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,565
Speaker 8:  in a few years. But the Ray bands for now are very much what

311
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:11,205
Speaker 8:  they're putting a lot of, you know, marketing and investment

312
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:15,285
Speaker 8:  into, we just saw the Super Bowl ad and I think they're gonna be riding

313
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:17,685
Speaker 8:  that hype wave for a

314
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:21,165
Speaker 2:  While. Yeah, I mean it, it seems like Meta in a really interesting way is

315
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:24,725
Speaker 2:  both trying to do the opposite of Apple, which we've been talking about for

316
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,845
Speaker 2:  a while, right? Apple is like we're going to build the best thing humanity

317
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:31,805
Speaker 2:  can possibly create and it's gonna cost $700,000 and no one's gonna

318
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:34,485
Speaker 2:  like it, but, and then, and then we'll figure out what to do from there.

319
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:38,245
Speaker 2:  That hasn't gone so great. Meta, I think

320
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:42,565
Speaker 2:  sort of by accident frankly seems to have found the exact opposite approach

321
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,085
Speaker 2:  where they're like, we're gonna take a thing that you already, like we're

322
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:47,280
Speaker 2:  going to make it a little bit better and then we're just gonna kind, kind

323
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,125
Speaker 2:  of keep adding stuff from there. And so it feels like, the question for

324
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:55,085
Speaker 2:  me is I think the, the Meta Ray band thing is is like that's,

325
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:58,965
Speaker 2:  that works like that I think is going to be a thing that will show up in

326
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:02,845
Speaker 2:  mainstream glasses everywhere, right? The like your glasses are now also

327
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,725
Speaker 2:  headphones and a little AI chat bot and there's a camera in the temple

328
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:10,685
Speaker 2:  like done. I think that is absolutely a mainstream use case.

329
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:15,125
Speaker 2:  Not very long from now. The question is how far up you can go from

330
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,005
Speaker 2:  there before you start losing people. Yeah. And to me that's the big question

331
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:19,965
Speaker 2:  of this year. 'cause we're gonna see a lot of people try, right? There were

332
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:23,605
Speaker 2:  all those companies that CES that were doing the little like green

333
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:27,285
Speaker 2:  heads up display right in front of the eyes. Some people will like that,

334
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:31,045
Speaker 2:  some people are gonna hate that it's, and so Meta seems like it's, it's

335
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:34,885
Speaker 2:  trying to like pull up on the the like how much

336
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:38,285
Speaker 2:  can this thing be chain? And I, I think

337
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:42,165
Speaker 2:  this is going to be an interesting year to see whether any of that actually

338
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:45,485
Speaker 2:  matters to most people or if everybody starts to be like, oh you've just

339
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:48,405
Speaker 2:  made a thing I wanna wear less. Which defeats the purpose of the whole thing.

340
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:52,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And that's the real stress for them with Hyper Nova. The

341
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:55,845
Speaker 8:  glasses that they're putting out with the display is, and the band is like

342
00:21:56,055 --> 00:22:00,005
Speaker 8:  we're taking we Ray bands that have tech in them and giving you like a

343
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:03,805
Speaker 8:  roughly a thousand dollars Google Glass redux device, but

344
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:07,765
Speaker 8:  it's Meta, you know, all the brand concerns there. And by the way

345
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:10,605
Speaker 8:  there's like a mind reading band that you have to like relearn how to interact

346
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:14,365
Speaker 8:  with a computer and like maybe early adopters will love it if they

347
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:18,245
Speaker 8:  don't. That's pretty tough for you know, something that Meta is spending

348
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:21,565
Speaker 8:  billions a year on and has yet to really see any meaningful, you know, profit

349
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:25,565
Speaker 8:  from. But do not discount Zuckerberg's

350
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:28,885
Speaker 8:  willingness to grind this out. It's really interesting to me that like in

351
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:32,445
Speaker 8:  the 10 years that Reality Labs has been going now roughly

352
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:36,565
Speaker 8:  I this it's been like eight is that, you know, there's been so much

353
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:40,445
Speaker 8:  written about how this is a, you know, waste and how Meta it's gonna

354
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:44,365
Speaker 8:  tank Meta. And Meta has literally added like a trillion dollars in

355
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:48,325
Speaker 8:  market cap since it started Reality Labs. So they

356
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,565
Speaker 8:  can afford to walk in chew gum as Zuckerberg says. It's just a matter of

357
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,725
Speaker 8:  how long and like if the products don't actually

358
00:22:55,785 --> 00:22:59,685
Speaker 8:  get used or received well in the next year or two, it's

359
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:02,845
Speaker 8:  gonna really set them back. And you know, he said in this meeting, like we

360
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:06,605
Speaker 8:  have a wide open, you know, field right now because Apple's dialed back,

361
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:11,125
Speaker 8:  you know, Google's still trying to get its, you know, whatever the 15th version

362
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,285
Speaker 8:  of its AR strategy off the ground. Yeah. No

363
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:15,445
Speaker 2:  One's afraid of Google's hardware division. Yeah.

364
00:23:15,905 --> 00:23:19,885
Speaker 8:  And so they have the early start and it's a matter of whether they can capitalize

365
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:23,525
Speaker 8:  on that and whether these products will really hit or not. And they've gotta,

366
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:27,405
Speaker 8:  you know, the quest is like we, we don't talk about it as much 'cause it's

367
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,285
Speaker 8:  just not as exciting anymore. But like they have to make that work, they

368
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,765
Speaker 8:  have to make it retentive. They have to find a way to make money from that

369
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:37,445
Speaker 8:  multi-year investment and horizon. They

370
00:23:37,445 --> 00:23:41,245
Speaker 8:  really needed to be a thing that is like a creator platform as well

371
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:44,725
Speaker 8:  that people wanna build worlds in. And that's where the AI stuff starts to

372
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:48,525
Speaker 8:  intersect. It's like AI and PC's, generative

373
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:52,165
Speaker 8:  world building where it could kind of accelerate that stuff. But they're

374
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:56,165
Speaker 8:  still so behind Roblox and Epic on just the tooling and

375
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:59,965
Speaker 8:  the ease of use. So I don't even think Horizon is even in the App store still.

376
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:03,485
Speaker 8:  I think it's just a web app. Maybe that's changed recently. But I mean

377
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:07,125
Speaker 2:  It's, it's one thing to look at Horizon as like a

378
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:11,325
Speaker 2:  sort of primitive version of a technology to come. Yeah. And it's like, okay,

379
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,565
Speaker 2:  well clearly they were too early, this thing isn't very good yet. Maybe there's

380
00:24:14,565 --> 00:24:18,285
Speaker 2:  a roadmap to it but you put it next to Roblox and Fortnite which people are

381
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:22,485
Speaker 2:  functionally using for the exact things that Meta is looking for and it

382
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:26,325
Speaker 2:  just, it just looks like a disaster. Yeah. So let's talk about the

383
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:29,685
Speaker 2:  social thing on the other side of this because I think if I were to give

384
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:32,685
Speaker 2:  Meta credit for one thing in particular, it's that it has figured out how

385
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:36,525
Speaker 2:  to make AI in a way that makes sense for literally

386
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:39,925
Speaker 2:  everything it's doing. Like what you just described is like Meta has built

387
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:44,085
Speaker 2:  all this AI so that it works for reality labs. It

388
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:47,685
Speaker 2:  also has made these glasses a hit. In part it's also powering the ads business,

389
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:50,965
Speaker 2:  which is really like that trillion dollars is like in large part because

390
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:54,565
Speaker 2:  Meta has made its ads better thanks to ai. Like yeah we don't talk about

391
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:57,245
Speaker 2:  that 'cause it's really boring, but like that's what happened. Yeah, Google

392
00:24:57,345 --> 00:25:00,685
Speaker 2:  is like, you can write emails and Meta metas like our ads are better now

393
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:04,805
Speaker 2:  and everybody gives them money. But then on the other

394
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:07,925
Speaker 2:  side there is like Facebook and Instagram

395
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:11,685
Speaker 2:  and Threads, which I feel like we don't talk about anymore because they're

396
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:14,405
Speaker 2:  just like, they're like furniture. They just sort of exist and we don't worry

397
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:18,365
Speaker 2:  about them. But then like in in on earnings calls

398
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:20,925
Speaker 2:  and in meetings and stuff, Zuckerberg is talking about bringing back the

399
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,605
Speaker 2:  OG Facebook. Yeah. And they're talking about bringing AI to more of Facebook.

400
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:27,405
Speaker 2:  Like what, what is coming on the social side of Meta that

401
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:27,925
Speaker 2:  you're hearing about

402
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:31,685
Speaker 8:  The OG Facebook stuff is something I'm still digging into and very interested

403
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:35,165
Speaker 8:  by. They've been trying to position Facebook as a

404
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:39,405
Speaker 8:  Gen Z app for the last few years. They're

405
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:43,005
Speaker 8:  keenly aware and we saw this actually in the stuff we saw through the Haugen

406
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:46,445
Speaker 8:  leakers that if they start to lose younger

407
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:50,605
Speaker 8:  users over time, it's really bad for a social network company.

408
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:54,565
Speaker 8:  So they have to make Facebook something that like, you know,

409
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:58,245
Speaker 8:  it's not just something you check once a year to see why

410
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:02,285
Speaker 8:  your parents are saying what they're saying to their friends on social media.

411
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:05,365
Speaker 8:  Right. It needs to be a thing that is like relevant beyond marketplace or

412
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:08,965
Speaker 8:  whatever and groups is working for them a little bit there. But I thought

413
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:11,365
Speaker 8:  it was interesting on the last earnings call he said he wants it to be a

414
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:13,645
Speaker 8:  lot more culturally influential.

415
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,765
Speaker 2:  I mean, don't we? All right. Like

416
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:19,935
Speaker 8:  Yeah, don't we all Sure. This I think has to do with ego

417
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:23,895
Speaker 8:  a bit. I mean this is what started the company. It is one of the

418
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:27,375
Speaker 8:  biggest products of all time that has had the most longevity, but it has

419
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,095
Speaker 8:  lost its influence. No question

420
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:34,455
Speaker 8:  that's gonna be really tough. And I'm not sure how they make it cool. Again,

421
00:26:34,455 --> 00:26:38,215
Speaker 8:  they've been trying, like I said, for years, but Instagram, you know, is

422
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:41,855
Speaker 8:  staying strong for them. It's not growing quite as fast still as they had

423
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:45,605
Speaker 8:  hoped, but it's just like really saturated in culture and that's really good

424
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:45,885
Speaker 8:  for them.

425
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:49,885
Speaker 2:  Instagram actually strikes me as the most sticky thing. Like

426
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:53,365
Speaker 2:  if, If you were to say like I've come from the future

427
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:57,845
Speaker 2:  it's, it's 2029 and there's only one Meta service left,

428
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:01,005
Speaker 2:  I would, I would guess it's Instagram at this point. I really would. Which

429
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:02,285
Speaker 2:  I would not have said a few years ago.

430
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:06,565
Speaker 8:  You might be right there. It's definitely got staying power and

431
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:10,645
Speaker 8:  relevance and it's more, you know, used by, by younger people.

432
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:14,605
Speaker 8:  Obviously Threads is earlier, but like it's still

433
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:18,445
Speaker 8:  writing a lot of Instagram's engagement loops. Yeah. They really

434
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:22,365
Speaker 8:  haven't made it a standalone growth entity and they really haven't

435
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:26,325
Speaker 8:  figured out like how it relates to X and blue sky. I think

436
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:29,165
Speaker 8:  the next year or so, especially on the political front will be really interesting

437
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:29,445
Speaker 8:  for that.

438
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:34,965
Speaker 8:  But yeah man bringing Facebook back, who would've thought 20 years later

439
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:38,285
Speaker 2:  It will be purely from a like

440
00:27:39,035 --> 00:27:42,405
Speaker 2:  reporting and person on the internet perspective. It's gonna be fascinating

441
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:45,485
Speaker 2:  because that would be a, a truly

442
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:50,405
Speaker 2:  unique moment on the internet to bring something like that all the way

443
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,845
Speaker 2:  back around to the point that it became like a must visit

444
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:57,885
Speaker 2:  destination for young people. Which it was

445
00:27:57,955 --> 00:28:01,685
Speaker 2:  like, yeah, Facebook was the most, like when I was in college, it was the

446
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:05,645
Speaker 2:  most important thing on the internet. Yeah. And, and it is, it is no longer

447
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:09,205
Speaker 2:  that to, I think anybody getting that back would be really something.

448
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:13,085
Speaker 8:  It would. And you know, I've done a lot of actually reporting and

449
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:17,325
Speaker 8:  analysis of that like over the last 10 years. Facebook itself

450
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:20,645
Speaker 8:  has done actually a lot to fragment the internet and fragment the social

451
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:24,525
Speaker 8:  internet specifically by cramming video in there for ads by

452
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:28,685
Speaker 8:  cramming AI into their stuff from people you don't follow.

453
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:33,525
Speaker 8:  Instead of trying to actually address the core thing that Facebook was, which

454
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:36,965
Speaker 8:  was a place you could reliably see interesting stuff from the people you

455
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:40,525
Speaker 8:  actually know. They basically just slowly mutated the product

456
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:44,885
Speaker 8:  over a decade to be something that is like unrecognizable and not

457
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:48,445
Speaker 8:  personal at all for people that are under 45

458
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:52,405
Speaker 8:  and undoing. That seems really tough.

459
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:55,485
Speaker 8:  I'm sure there's a lot of people who haven't deleted their accounts but like

460
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:59,085
Speaker 8:  getting them back in and I think the internet actually could use what Facebook

461
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:02,645
Speaker 8:  originally was though, doesn't it? It feels super fragmented with x and blue

462
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:06,245
Speaker 8:  sky and all and group chats and a lot of the group chat activity is because

463
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:10,205
Speaker 8:  Facebook pushed people out of feeds that were strangely starting to feel

464
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:13,885
Speaker 8:  foreign and and bad and like they were killing democracy into group

465
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:17,165
Speaker 8:  chats. Can you get them back out of group chats into a feed of your friends?

466
00:29:17,945 --> 00:29:21,005
Speaker 8:  That's gonna be really interesting to see. I'm, I'm very skeptical of that,

467
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,965
Speaker 8:  but it's something we're gonna be paying close attention to.

468
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:28,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it is one of the, one of those things that if he's serious about it,

469
00:29:28,325 --> 00:29:31,845
Speaker 2:  there are a few CEOs other than Mark Zuckerberg who could make the hard decisions

470
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,645
Speaker 2:  required to do that. Yeah. Because it would, it would cost you a lot of money.

471
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:37,325
Speaker 2:  Like just pretty straightforwardly,

472
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,925
Speaker 8:  You know, he actually, people didn't catch that. He actually hinted at that

473
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:44,605
Speaker 8:  in the last earnings call. He said something, I'm paraphrasing, but it was

474
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:47,565
Speaker 8:  a almost throwaway line where he was like, and we're gonna do things that

475
00:29:47,565 --> 00:29:51,405
Speaker 8:  like will impact near term results but it's gonna be good for the

476
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:55,365
Speaker 8:  future. So I think the Facebook app, what you see when you open it is

477
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:57,285
Speaker 8:  going to change pretty dramatically in the next year.

478
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:01,725
Speaker 2:  Fascinating. Listen, if, if Mark Zuckerberg can get me using Facebook again

479
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:04,765
Speaker 2:  every day, that will be the, the tech CEO coup of the century

480
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:09,845
Speaker 2:  and I, and there are a lot of those going on right now. Last thing

481
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:13,245
Speaker 2:  before we go, there's been a lot of fallout internally that you've been tracking

482
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:16,805
Speaker 2:  and reporting on after Zuckerberg goes on Joe Rogan and talks about masculine

483
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:20,445
Speaker 2:  energy, they've done some layoffs. Part of what I'm thinking about when I

484
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:24,365
Speaker 2:  mention like this feels like a different kind of company I is just

485
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:28,245
Speaker 2:  like they've changed the way they talk to staff in these all hands. Like

486
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:31,005
Speaker 2:  Mark is yelling about leakers and posting your stories about the leakers,

487
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:34,965
Speaker 2:  about the leakers. Like what is your read on kind of the vibe

488
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:38,685
Speaker 2:  inside of Meta as those things shift? Well,

489
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:42,205
Speaker 8:  I mean it's tough. Meta is a huge company. I think when you talk about the

490
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:45,885
Speaker 8:  vibe of a 77,000 person company, you have to obviously

491
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,765
Speaker 8:  acknowledge that it's not a monolith. And there are a lot of lifers still.

492
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,925
Speaker 8:  There's people who try to tune out the drama.

493
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:57,085
Speaker 8:  There is a strong growing faction of

494
00:30:57,085 --> 00:31:00,965
Speaker 8:  disillusioned, you know, pissed off people at, you

495
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:04,925
Speaker 8:  know, what has happened in the last couple of months with all the MAGA fueled

496
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:08,485
Speaker 8:  content changes, the Joe Rogan stuff,

497
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:12,805
Speaker 8:  taking tampons outta the men's room, all this culture war,

498
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:17,005
Speaker 8:  anti woke stuff and then how

499
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:20,365
Speaker 8:  these layoffs have been handled. You know, he basically copied Elon with

500
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:23,965
Speaker 8:  that and said they were gonna be targeting low performers, which

501
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:28,205
Speaker 8:  is rough. It's, it's a rough way to go out to, to have the CEO saying, you

502
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:31,845
Speaker 8:  know, this person's a low performer and have it be

503
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:35,885
Speaker 8:  SEOed to death for forever. So that's not

504
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:39,325
Speaker 8:  endeared a lot of goodwill. I think there's gonna be a lot more to come on.

505
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:43,205
Speaker 8:  The employee versus management tension there kind of reminds

506
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:46,805
Speaker 8:  me of where Google was, I don't know, six or seven years ago

507
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:50,645
Speaker 8:  when they were really going through all that employee upheaval and

508
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:54,205
Speaker 8:  Google still has it, but they've largely stamped it out or at least like

509
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:58,765
Speaker 8:  tamed it to such a degree that it doesn't feel, I don't know as dramatic

510
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:02,685
Speaker 8:  as it does at Meta right now. But Meta is very much going through a cultural

511
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:06,325
Speaker 8:  shift, which is what I've been writing about, where it was probably the most

512
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:10,365
Speaker 8:  open internally big tech company. And they're realizing they can no longer

513
00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:13,565
Speaker 8:  do that with how big it is. And also just how

514
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:17,525
Speaker 8:  pissed off some people are at how things are going right. And so they're

515
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:21,085
Speaker 8:  clamping down on that stuff and we saw some of that with the Francis Haugen

516
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:23,965
Speaker 8:  leakers and how they reacted to that. But this feels like the next turn there.

517
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:27,485
Speaker 8:  And I do think metal will look a lot different, not just externally but internally

518
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:29,285
Speaker 8:  in the next year or so.

519
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:17,085
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. We've talked a lot about Sonos on this show

520
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:21,005
Speaker 2:  over the last year. I think more than most companies its size

521
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:25,325
Speaker 2:  actually it is just a weird, interesting important company

522
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:28,245
Speaker 2:  in this space. I think if you're a listener to the show, I would say there's

523
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:31,805
Speaker 2:  a higher than average chance that you own some Sonos stuff.

524
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:35,925
Speaker 2:  This company has just kind of been around in our lives as things that people

525
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:39,765
Speaker 2:  who like technology like for a long time. But then Sonos kind of

526
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:43,165
Speaker 2:  spent last year setting all of that goodwill on fire

527
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:47,085
Speaker 2:  and we've talked about a lot of the news moments here. Sonos released an

528
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,485
Speaker 2:  app, Sonos released headphones, the app went terribly, the headphones were

529
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:54,455
Speaker 2:  fine. Patrick Spence, the CEO ended up being ousted. We've

530
00:34:54,455 --> 00:34:58,175
Speaker 2:  talked about a lot of that, but I think I wanna go back and understand

531
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:02,695
Speaker 2:  the full story and see what happened inside of that company

532
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:06,535
Speaker 2:  and what we can learn. So again, it helps that I have access to

533
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:09,175
Speaker 2:  one of the people who knows this story the best. Chris Welch who has been

534
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:12,695
Speaker 2:  chronicling this story for us since the beginning and has gotten lots of

535
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:16,655
Speaker 2:  scoops and has some big scoops on what's to come from Sonos. So

536
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:20,335
Speaker 2:  let's get Chris and just dive into this. Chris Welch, welcome back to the

537
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:23,215
Speaker 2:  show. Hello David. It's good to be back. There's been a lot that's happened

538
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:26,535
Speaker 2:  in the last few months. There really is. And for once, I have not brought

539
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:30,455
Speaker 2:  you here to test terrible microphones, but, but what I

540
00:35:30,455 --> 00:35:34,415
Speaker 2:  wanna do is I wanna talk about like the last 12

541
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:37,885
Speaker 2:  months of Sonos, which is a thing we've covered, covered a lot on the show,

542
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:41,605
Speaker 2:  but we've covered it kind of in newsy moments and

543
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,645
Speaker 2:  I have found myself, the further we get into the Sonos story, I

544
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:49,405
Speaker 2:  feel like the less I understand what actually happened here and what is

545
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:53,285
Speaker 2:  going on inside of this company and what is gonna happen next for

546
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:57,165
Speaker 2:  Sonos. And you, you had this big scoop last week about Pinewood, the set

547
00:35:57,165 --> 00:36:00,245
Speaker 2:  top box that Sonos is working on, which I think is gonna be another moment

548
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:03,965
Speaker 2:  in time, but I just wanna sort of, as best we can tell the story

549
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:07,885
Speaker 2:  of really 2024 for Sonos. Yeah. And kind of

550
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:09,765
Speaker 2:  what that means going forward. Does that, does that sound all right to you?

551
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:10,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

552
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:11,325
Speaker 13:  Absolutely. Okay.

553
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:15,445
Speaker 2:  So I wanna start, I think it was in March of last year

554
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,405
Speaker 2:  when you had a scoop that Sonos was

555
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:21,245
Speaker 2:  releasing a new app.

556
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:26,525
Speaker 2:  What do you remember what you knew about this app at the time

557
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:29,085
Speaker 2:  that was like what we thought was coming back in March?

558
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:33,165
Speaker 13:  So the word back then is they were working on a new app for their headphones,

559
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:36,405
Speaker 13:  the Ace. And at the time we didn't realize it was gonna be like the whole

560
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:40,165
Speaker 13:  new Sonos app, but that's what it came to be like a whole

561
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:44,045
Speaker 13:  huge overhaul of the Sonos app, like a whole do over essentially of like

562
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:47,445
Speaker 13:  all the core technology in there and stuff like that. And so it was a huge

563
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:51,005
Speaker 13:  project and there were good reasons for doing so because like the,

564
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:55,165
Speaker 13:  so much of the Sonos like foundation is ancient, like the Sonos APIs held

565
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:58,485
Speaker 13:  together with like duct tape and bubble gum, like it's been around forever

566
00:36:58,545 --> 00:37:01,765
Speaker 13:  and they've like barely worked on it. And so it's like kind of amazing that

567
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:04,885
Speaker 13:  Sonos whole platform still works as well as it does all these years later.

568
00:37:05,545 --> 00:37:09,405
Speaker 13:  So they had good reasons to like redo the app and start from scratch and,

569
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:13,285
Speaker 13:  and do a big overhaul, but the way they went about it was just the

570
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:14,245
Speaker 13:  worst way imaginable.

571
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:18,165
Speaker 2:  Right. And I, in in retrospect we've, we've definitely

572
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:21,965
Speaker 2:  connected all of this change to Sonos is about to launch a pair of headphones

573
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:26,245
Speaker 2:  and needed this big sort of infrastructural upgrade. Like you're

574
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:30,205
Speaker 2:  talking about what do we know about what actually needed to happen there?

575
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:34,125
Speaker 2:  Like was this a thing Sonos actually had to do together that it

576
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:37,965
Speaker 2:  was like the, these headphones are coming out, we have to do this new technical

577
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:41,085
Speaker 2:  upgrade to make this possible. Did they just sort of decide to do it all

578
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:44,805
Speaker 2:  at once for big, you know, launchy branding energy? Like what was

579
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:47,125
Speaker 2:  actually necessary here to get the headphones out the door?

580
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,285
Speaker 13:  I think the leadership thought the whole process was gonna be a lot easier

581
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:54,205
Speaker 13:  than it was because from the start the ACE were like built only to

582
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,525
Speaker 13:  support the new app. Like they didn't, they never worked with the old one

583
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:59,125
Speaker 13:  at all. It's like from the jump they were like designed for the new app

584
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,165
Speaker 13:  and so they, they had planned all this like coincide at the same time.

585
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,845
Speaker 13:  And so I think they were very, very optimistic and like why

586
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:10,565
Speaker 13:  they like decided to like put the app out and not do a

587
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:14,605
Speaker 13:  beta or anything like that is still kind of a mystery. That's

588
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:17,445
Speaker 13:  something I'm sure that Patrick Spence is very

589
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:22,205
Speaker 13:  mad about these days. Yeah. His choices back then. And so

590
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:25,765
Speaker 13:  yeah, so the plan was to like do it all at once, put the headphones out,

591
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:29,685
Speaker 13:  make a big splashy introduction for the ace. This whole situation

592
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:32,365
Speaker 13:  has now caused those, caused those headphones to fall on their face and

593
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:36,205
Speaker 13:  I don't think they're ever gonna recover unfortunately. So it was

594
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:37,845
Speaker 13:  all for Naugh unfortunately.

595
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:41,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. So I'm, I'm getting ahead of myself in this story here, but I

596
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:44,205
Speaker 2:  I that you just brought up, one of the things I had been thinking about the

597
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:47,925
Speaker 2:  most with the Sonos story is obviously by now

598
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,205
Speaker 2:  everybody knows the Bones app ships in May total disaster

599
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:55,845
Speaker 2:  kind of ruins Sonos in a very real way. The headphones are

600
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:59,645
Speaker 2:  very good, right? Yeah. Do you, is there a parallel universe

601
00:38:59,825 --> 00:39:03,595
Speaker 2:  in which Sonos does like the

602
00:39:03,595 --> 00:39:07,495
Speaker 2:  least with the headphones, like ships the,

603
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:11,055
Speaker 2:  the app with like whatever tiny upgrades they needed but didn't try to sort

604
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:14,775
Speaker 2:  of reinvent everything about the entire Sonos system to make the Ace work

605
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:19,295
Speaker 2:  the ace ships and it's a huge hit. Like is that, could that have happened?

606
00:39:20,215 --> 00:39:23,415
Speaker 13:  I think it was always gonna be a pretty uphill climb for the Ace just 'cause

607
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:26,175
Speaker 13:  there's so much competition. Like Sonos saw this as a huge market opportunity

608
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:29,695
Speaker 13:  and it is a huge market, but you've got long time

609
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:33,735
Speaker 13:  heavyweights like Apple Beats, Bose, Sony brands that have

610
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:36,655
Speaker 13:  been around forever have their reputation. And so they were coming in with

611
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:39,255
Speaker 13:  these headphones that are very good, like you said, they're super comfortable,

612
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:42,295
Speaker 13:  they sound great. The TV audio swap feature is very neat.

613
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:46,655
Speaker 13:  And so yeah, they had like good aspects, but

614
00:39:46,955 --> 00:39:50,535
Speaker 13:  trying to like top, you know, face off against Apple and

615
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,255
Speaker 13:  and and Bose is just a pretty daunting task.

616
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:57,975
Speaker 2:  Fair. But it does seem like even in that case, I think there's

617
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:01,295
Speaker 2:  an interesting thing that I think was happening at Sonos and has been happening

618
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:04,855
Speaker 2:  for a while where like this company is desperate to be a mainstream

619
00:40:05,385 --> 00:40:06,815
Speaker 2:  brand. They're desperate

620
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:10,175
Speaker 13:  For growth. Sure, that's fair. One key question about this whole situation

621
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:14,095
Speaker 13:  is like, should Sonos should ever have gone public in the first place? Because

622
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:17,415
Speaker 13:  now they're a company that is like after growth above all else, finding

623
00:40:17,475 --> 00:40:21,015
Speaker 13:  new customers trying to expand their customer base. And it's like how does

624
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:23,975
Speaker 13:  an audio speaker company really do that? You know, how much growth is there

625
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:27,775
Speaker 13:  really? And so that's a big, like should they have stayed private like

626
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:30,655
Speaker 13:  Bose and just like done their own thing forever and just like put out nice

627
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:34,295
Speaker 13:  new products every few years and just made a decent amount of income and

628
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:38,175
Speaker 13:  revenue and just been happy with that. But they are public now and

629
00:40:38,215 --> 00:40:42,135
Speaker 13:  I think their biggest stock shareholder is BlackRock. And so these

630
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:46,015
Speaker 13:  like giant corporations that are gonna like push them to like grow and

631
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:47,615
Speaker 13:  grow and grow and so, right.

632
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:51,255
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean it, it is a thing I've always wondered is, is

633
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:55,015
Speaker 2:  what was it that caused Sonos to stop wanting to be

634
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:59,455
Speaker 2:  kind of a niche high-end audio company? And there are lots of those out there,

635
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:02,415
Speaker 2:  right? Like I think about like Bowers and Wilkins a lot, which is like a

636
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:05,455
Speaker 2:  company that a lot of people really care about. But if you're not like an

637
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:08,895
Speaker 2:  audio person, you've probably never heard of it. And one of the things that

638
00:41:09,145 --> 00:41:13,135
Speaker 2:  Sonos did for so long that was so impressive was it had this kind

639
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:16,815
Speaker 2:  of high-end technology. Its stuff was very good, but it was like known

640
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:20,735
Speaker 2:  to humans. Like regular people bought Sonos stuff in a way that most people

641
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:23,975
Speaker 2:  were not running around buying Bowers and Wilkins stuff, right? And that's

642
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:26,295
Speaker 2:  so shade to Bowers and Wilkins, it's just like a different kind of brand.

643
00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:30,335
Speaker 2:  But Sonos had found this thing where it was, it was like a

644
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:34,045
Speaker 2:  luxury audio company without being

645
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,885
Speaker 2:  sort of snobby about it. Yeah. In a way that was actually really powerful

646
00:41:37,905 --> 00:41:41,845
Speaker 2:  for Sonos. And it feels like if it had just stayed there, it could have

647
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:45,805
Speaker 2:  done that thing for a very long time. And instead it was like, okay, what

648
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:49,125
Speaker 2:  can we do that will make us, I don't know,

649
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:53,605
Speaker 2:  relevant to people who don't otherwise care. And I, what I've

650
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:56,765
Speaker 2:  always wondered is like, is that Patrick Spence being like, how do I be cooler

651
00:41:56,825 --> 00:42:00,605
Speaker 2:  and fancier and more famous? Or is it investors being like, where

652
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,965
Speaker 2:  is the quarterly growth? And it sounds like maybe it's a little of both,

653
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,165
Speaker 2:  but mostly the second thing. Yeah,

654
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:09,545
Speaker 13:  I think Patrick Spence is a quite a story because I think like for the most

655
00:42:09,545 --> 00:42:13,025
Speaker 13:  part he was a pretty good CEO. Like Sonos had a lot of good products under

656
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:16,185
Speaker 13:  him. You know, the arc, the Rome and the move,

657
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:20,025
Speaker 13:  you know, quite a few string of hits. They were good products at least.

658
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:23,505
Speaker 13:  Yeah. But like this, this whole app debacle was like really his undoing

659
00:42:23,505 --> 00:42:27,465
Speaker 13:  and like he should have, you know, played it much safer than he did.

660
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:30,105
Speaker 13:  And like part of that shift was like all the marketing they brought in this

661
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:33,985
Speaker 13:  guy from Dyson Jordan, sax Mar who got fired last week or

662
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:37,625
Speaker 13:  this week rather. And his whole thing was like, he wanted to make Sonos

663
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,945
Speaker 13:  more fashionable and like more mainstream. And like that was his world.

664
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:44,185
Speaker 13:  Like he came from Dyson, like high fashion. Right. You know, fancy tech.

665
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:47,665
Speaker 13:  And so like, and so he didn't hold the Sonos core customer base in high

666
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,305
Speaker 13:  regard. Like you saw them as kind of like niche and wanted to like expand

667
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:54,275
Speaker 13:  and grow and grow and grow. And the Ace was the whole big fixture

668
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:57,515
Speaker 13:  of this whole plan and didn't, didn't quite pan out. And like the marketing

669
00:42:57,515 --> 00:43:00,755
Speaker 13:  around the ace was strange. Like they spent a lot of money. Like if it's

670
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:03,515
Speaker 13:  like last fall you couldn't miss the Sonos Ace subway campaigns in York.

671
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:03,875
Speaker 13:  They were

672
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:04,275
Speaker 2:  Everywhere,

673
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:06,995
Speaker 13:  But they didn't really say anything about the headphones. It just like photos,

674
00:43:07,215 --> 00:43:10,075
Speaker 13:  pretty photos and like showed the headphones, but they didn't say like what

675
00:43:10,075 --> 00:43:13,195
Speaker 13:  they did, why they were different from like your standard Bose headphones.

676
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:16,635
Speaker 13:  And so like they spend a lot of money but like for what gain not much. So

677
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,635
Speaker 13:  like that was his whole idea is just to like, make Sonos more fashionable,

678
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:23,835
Speaker 13:  more beautiful and like bring in like that crowd and

679
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:25,155
Speaker 13:  not sure it was the play.

680
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:29,075
Speaker 2:  Well that's, I mean this is the thing I find so fascinating is like there's

681
00:43:29,115 --> 00:43:32,835
Speaker 2:  a version of that strategy that I think could have worked right?

682
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:37,075
Speaker 2:  Like Sonos, Sonos as a sort of lifestyle brand kind of tracks

683
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:40,195
Speaker 2:  for me, right? Like I think in the way that people recognize Bose as more

684
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:43,955
Speaker 2:  than just a set of headphones, like people, people know Bose

685
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:47,875
Speaker 2:  for like the science of sound stuff and Beats is a lifestyle

686
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,315
Speaker 2:  brand, but in like a very different direction. I think like I can see why

687
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:54,995
Speaker 2:  Sonos would make that decision, but then like you have to keep shipping things

688
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:57,915
Speaker 2:  that are good, which brings us back to the app. And so this, this is kind

689
00:43:57,915 --> 00:44:01,355
Speaker 2:  of the, the moment that you've chronicled a lot at

690
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:05,755
Speaker 2:  Sonos over the last whatever, 10 months since this happened. But the app

691
00:44:05,915 --> 00:44:09,635
Speaker 2:  ships in May, the response is horrific. Like immediately off the jump,

692
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:13,595
Speaker 2:  everybody hates the app, it becomes a, it, it starts to snowball and

693
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:16,995
Speaker 2:  become a huge problem. Like what, what is your sense having reported this

694
00:44:16,995 --> 00:44:20,915
Speaker 2:  out months later of kind of what the summer was like inside

695
00:44:20,915 --> 00:44:24,235
Speaker 2:  of Sonos as all of this is roiling and going on?

696
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:28,075
Speaker 13:  I think they knew what they were in for quite honestly. 'cause like there

697
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:30,955
Speaker 13:  were people inside Sonos who knew from the jump that like it was buggy not

698
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,445
Speaker 13:  where it needed to be to like stay on target After that launch. And they

699
00:44:34,445 --> 00:44:38,325
Speaker 13:  had people, like, they had a small group of beta testers who, who like

700
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:40,525
Speaker 13:  definitely were complaining but like felt like they weren't getting any

701
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:43,445
Speaker 13:  feedback for those complaints. They were just like filing bug reports and

702
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:47,045
Speaker 13:  getting nothing back. And so yeah, it was just a slow,

703
00:44:47,595 --> 00:44:51,485
Speaker 13:  slow roll of a very big disaster coming and like, they should

704
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:54,845
Speaker 13:  have seen it coming. They should have, you know, paused or at least like

705
00:44:54,845 --> 00:44:58,005
Speaker 13:  delayed the ace until the fall. Like I've always wondered like why not just,

706
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:01,405
Speaker 13:  you know, punt the ace to like the holidays and put 'em out. Then the app

707
00:45:01,405 --> 00:45:05,245
Speaker 13:  would've been in a slightly better state than it was then. And so, but

708
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:09,285
Speaker 13:  no, they just went full steam ahead. Yeah. People were like crunched,

709
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:12,965
Speaker 13:  they were like working overtime, like hours and hours and hours. Their chief

710
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:15,605
Speaker 13:  software guy and Nick Millington was sending out video messages to like

711
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:18,565
Speaker 13:  all the staff saying, you know, please everybody work a little bit harder,

712
00:45:18,825 --> 00:45:21,765
Speaker 13:  put in a few more hours and people were just burned out and yeah. And like,

713
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:24,685
Speaker 13:  yeah and people, people at Sonos really care about Sonos. Like that's what

714
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:27,605
Speaker 13:  I've learned covering them so much. Like they've got a great staff, very

715
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:31,125
Speaker 13:  passionate about the brand, but they were pushed to their limits and like

716
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:35,005
Speaker 13:  then, you know, so the AF happens and since that they've laid off 300

717
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:37,925
Speaker 13:  people and like they've all lost their jobs because of like bad decisions

718
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:41,365
Speaker 13:  by Spence and, and his cohorts. So yeah, it's been tough to see,

719
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:45,245
Speaker 2:  Draw that line for me a little bit actually. 'cause I think this is, there

720
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:49,165
Speaker 2:  was an interesting thing that happened where I think the perception of the

721
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:53,085
Speaker 2:  app debacle became so bad and I think to

722
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:56,965
Speaker 2:  some extent we can talk about this, but like, I actually think we will

723
00:45:57,445 --> 00:45:59,445
Speaker 2:  remember the app as being worse than it actually was.

724
00:46:01,145 --> 00:46:04,765
Speaker 2:  It, it made a huge mistake of pissing off the people who like Sonos the most.

725
00:46:06,575 --> 00:46:09,845
Speaker 2:  Which is, which is a stupid thing to do, but as a, as a like it's not like

726
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:13,045
Speaker 2:  it broke every Sonos speaker in existence, right? Yeah. And I think the way

727
00:46:13,045 --> 00:46:15,765
Speaker 2:  we remember it is like it completely destroyed everything and it's like,

728
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:18,845
Speaker 2:  no, they, they just didn't ship a sleep timers, right? Which is like, yeah,

729
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:20,965
Speaker 2:  there, there was a bunch of stuff missing and that stuff is real, but I think

730
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:25,485
Speaker 2:  it was not the like five alarm fire of a disaster that it could have been,

731
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:27,925
Speaker 2:  but it became that over time for some people

732
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:30,525
Speaker 13:  It was like, honestly like, I think and like sometimes it would work and

733
00:46:30,525 --> 00:46:32,805
Speaker 13:  then it would just stop working like out of nowhere. Like all your speakers

734
00:46:32,805 --> 00:46:35,005
Speaker 13:  would like vanish from the app and like If you were having a party or hosting

735
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:37,325
Speaker 13:  like a big event and like that's when the app went on the fritz. I could

736
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:40,045
Speaker 13:  see how that would be infuriating. Yeah. So like yeah,

737
00:46:40,135 --> 00:46:43,485
Speaker 2:  Especially for a company whose whole thing was that, that never ever happened,

738
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:46,245
Speaker 2:  right? Yeah. Like for years that never ever happened to people.

739
00:46:46,715 --> 00:46:49,485
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Yeah. So there plays some issues with like, just like products just

740
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:52,525
Speaker 13:  like vanishing from the app for no reason and stuff like that. But like

741
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:56,325
Speaker 13:  on the whole, like for me it's been fairly solid since May. Like I

742
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:58,445
Speaker 13:  haven't had that many problems. I've had like the occasional, you know,

743
00:46:58,535 --> 00:47:02,285
Speaker 13:  issue or bug, but on the whole it's just like, yeah, things are missing

744
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:05,925
Speaker 13:  a feature were of absent for months that took way too long to bring back.

745
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:09,365
Speaker 13:  And so like this all just tells you like there should have been a beta from

746
00:47:09,365 --> 00:47:12,485
Speaker 13:  the, from the very beginning they should have had two apps like out at the

747
00:47:12,485 --> 00:47:16,325
Speaker 13:  same time during this transition. And so yeah, it's just kind of,

748
00:47:17,845 --> 00:47:20,205
Speaker 13:  I don't know, it just boggles the mind that like no one there like made

749
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,485
Speaker 13:  that decision so it was too late.

750
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:25,325
Speaker 2:  It reminds me a little of the, the stories we've heard about the, the humane

751
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,845
Speaker 2:  pin from last year that there were groups of those early

752
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,485
Speaker 2:  testers who were basically screaming as though they were blue in the face

753
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:36,205
Speaker 2:  about like, this thing doesn't work, you can't ship it. And and eventually

754
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:39,765
Speaker 2:  I, and I think it's, I'm I'm actually sort of sympathetic to tech companies

755
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:42,365
Speaker 2:  in this spot because you hit a point where it's like, okay, we have, we have

756
00:47:42,365 --> 00:47:46,125
Speaker 2:  booked ad campaigns, we have, we have giant inventory sitting in a warehouse

757
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:49,765
Speaker 2:  that costs us money every day. We don't sell it. This stuff is, it is hard

758
00:47:50,425 --> 00:47:54,325
Speaker 2:  to pull back once you have already committed, right? Right. And so I

759
00:47:54,325 --> 00:47:58,205
Speaker 2:  think what you see over and over these companies do is just, just keep charging

760
00:47:58,205 --> 00:48:01,565
Speaker 2:  through. And I think it's usually a mistake, but I also completely understand

761
00:48:01,565 --> 00:48:05,005
Speaker 2:  why these companies keep making that mistake. It is just a, it's a hard moment,

762
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:08,405
Speaker 2:  but like when, when the people who make these products are

763
00:48:08,715 --> 00:48:12,405
Speaker 2:  screaming at you about how they don't work, you should probably listen to

764
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:14,605
Speaker 2:  them. It's just a good rule of thumb I would say.

765
00:48:14,965 --> 00:48:18,405
Speaker 13:  I agree. Like they saw the ace as like this like huge moment where they

766
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:20,885
Speaker 13:  would like have this new revenue driver and a big new product. And so I

767
00:48:20,885 --> 00:48:24,725
Speaker 13:  think their mindset was like, let's just get it out and like,

768
00:48:24,855 --> 00:48:28,165
Speaker 13:  let's see how it goes. We'll fix it afterwards. They didn't realize like

769
00:48:28,165 --> 00:48:32,045
Speaker 13:  how bad the bugs would be for so many people all at once. And so,

770
00:48:32,555 --> 00:48:32,845
Speaker 13:  yeah.

771
00:48:33,305 --> 00:48:37,005
Speaker 2:  So is that, is that the kind of like I I, I mentioned sort of drawing the

772
00:48:37,005 --> 00:48:40,765
Speaker 2:  line from bad app launch to sort of corporate

773
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:44,205
Speaker 2:  chaos. Lots of people get laid off, huge changes. Patrick Spence is out.

774
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,885
Speaker 2:  Sort of walk me through that spiral, I guess, like how do we get from that

775
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:52,685
Speaker 2:  launch to Sonos becoming sort of internally a very different

776
00:48:52,685 --> 00:48:52,965
Speaker 2:  company?

777
00:48:53,435 --> 00:48:57,285
Speaker 13:  Yeah, so the app came out, there were months and months of like just

778
00:48:57,345 --> 00:49:00,525
Speaker 13:  bad vibes in the Sonos subreddit. Just complaints everywhere, every day.

779
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:04,045
Speaker 13:  And so it's been a pretty sad place for a few months. Did

780
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:07,925
Speaker 2:  You have a lot of people constantly telling you to keep yelling about how

781
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:08,725
Speaker 2:  bad the app is?

782
00:49:08,915 --> 00:49:10,005
Speaker 13:  Yeah, yeah, of course.

783
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:12,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I remember there were times where you were getting emails like all

784
00:49:12,685 --> 00:49:15,165
Speaker 2:  day every day from people being like, you're not being mean enough to the

785
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:15,365
Speaker 2:  app.

786
00:49:15,795 --> 00:49:19,165
Speaker 13:  Yeah. And it's like Sonos didn't help itself. Like there was one interview,

787
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:23,605
Speaker 13:  one statement they sent me where the now ex chief product officer said that

788
00:49:23,605 --> 00:49:26,685
Speaker 13:  it took courage to put out the app, which it's never a word you want to

789
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:27,885
Speaker 13:  use in this industry. Yeah.

790
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:30,805
Speaker 2:  Again, while we're giving free advice to tech founders, don't say that. Yeah.

791
00:49:31,085 --> 00:49:33,485
Speaker 2:  Just it didn't, it didn't work for Apple when they talked about courage.

792
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:36,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It didn't work for Sonos. Like, don't talk about your courage in putting

793
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,325
Speaker 2:  out products people don't like. Yeah.

794
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:41,525
Speaker 13:  So that, that didn't help. And it took like just way too long for Patrick

795
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:44,845
Speaker 13:  to come out and like make an apology. Like it took several weeks. Like he

796
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:47,365
Speaker 13:  had said, oh, we're working on it. And then finally he was like, we apologize.

797
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,485
Speaker 13:  I think back in November they put up this like multi-step plan, like, we're

798
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:54,885
Speaker 13:  gonna be much more careful with our software now we're gonna bring in a,

799
00:49:55,045 --> 00:49:58,925
Speaker 13:  a quality ombudsperson was the role I think they had planned. And,

800
00:49:59,025 --> 00:50:02,325
Speaker 13:  and just to like have like much more steps to make sure this would never

801
00:50:02,325 --> 00:50:05,245
Speaker 13:  happen again. And more transparency for like people inside the company.

802
00:50:05,245 --> 00:50:08,005
Speaker 13:  Like if they're saying, like trying to sound alarms, saying like, Hey, this

803
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,965
Speaker 13:  thing is a goddamn mess. Like what are we doing? And so do you think

804
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:14,605
Speaker 2:  That was good faith? I mean there's, there's a certain piece of this I think

805
00:50:14,605 --> 00:50:18,565
Speaker 2:  that was like, like we were just talking about, they heard

806
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:22,325
Speaker 2:  the feedback people, people knew there were people who were unhappy, people

807
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:25,725
Speaker 2:  who were making this stuff presumably knew there were bugs and you, you eventually

808
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:29,645
Speaker 2:  sit around a conference table with executives and decide, well the,

809
00:50:29,825 --> 00:50:33,765
Speaker 2:  the benefits of going ahead outweigh the costs of going ahead. We're just

810
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:37,325
Speaker 2:  gonna keep going. Like, do you think this idea of like, let's hire more people

811
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:41,005
Speaker 2:  to yell at us about when our products are bad was a real good faith

812
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:41,365
Speaker 2:  effort?

813
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:45,725
Speaker 13:  I think it was. 'cause I saw like how huge this had grown, this controversy.

814
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:49,965
Speaker 13:  And I think, yeah, I mean part of that plan was they were

815
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:53,685
Speaker 13:  gonna, like if Sonos didn't meet its targets, the topic executives like

816
00:50:53,685 --> 00:50:57,005
Speaker 13:  weren't gonna get their bonus, which that provision like just made people

817
00:50:57,275 --> 00:51:00,405
Speaker 13:  like what? Like who cares about your bonus? Like this is the most tone deaf

818
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:04,085
Speaker 13:  thing I could ever imagine. And so yeah, that didn't go over super well.

819
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:07,245
Speaker 13:  People were like super skeptical, which made sense after like going through

820
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:10,405
Speaker 13:  this whole mess. And so a few months later Patrick was out.

821
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:15,165
Speaker 13:  Tom Conrad, who's a long time SOAs board member, Tom is a

822
00:51:15,165 --> 00:51:17,565
Speaker 13:  product guy. So like If you want someone to like steer the ship back in

823
00:51:17,565 --> 00:51:20,805
Speaker 13:  the right direction, he had his first earnings call last week. He was like,

824
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:24,125
Speaker 13:  we have a lot more work to do. So he was pretty like mindful of like where

825
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:25,845
Speaker 13:  they are and where they have to go.

826
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:29,805
Speaker 2:  W where do you think that is at this moment? Like where would you put

827
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:34,005
Speaker 2:  Sonos kind of in, its in its own journey at this point? Because I think

828
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:38,405
Speaker 2:  to me maybe the most lingering thing from

829
00:51:38,835 --> 00:51:42,605
Speaker 2:  what happened last year is that I think Sonos has burned a lot of the,

830
00:51:43,635 --> 00:51:47,565
Speaker 2:  this stuff just works Goodwill that it had, right? Like I, I suspect

831
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:50,765
Speaker 2:  you and I have both told many people in our lives over the years to buy Sonos

832
00:51:50,765 --> 00:51:54,045
Speaker 2:  stuff and so much of the logic is it sounds great,

833
00:51:54,715 --> 00:51:58,445
Speaker 2:  it's 30% more expensive than everything else

834
00:51:58,545 --> 00:52:02,485
Speaker 2:  it competes with, but it works. Yeah. And it is, it is,

835
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:06,445
Speaker 2:  it is worth the price. And I think to some extent that's still

836
00:52:06,445 --> 00:52:08,765
Speaker 2:  true for a lot of Sonos products, but I think they have, it's

837
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:11,365
Speaker 13:  Still true. Like no one else does quite what Sonos does when it comes to

838
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:14,205
Speaker 13:  like co home audio and like playing your TV sound over like all the speakers

839
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:16,725
Speaker 13:  in your house. Like there's whim, but that's like more of a niche, even

840
00:52:16,725 --> 00:52:20,045
Speaker 13:  more niche than Sonos and it takes a lot more setup and, and that kind of

841
00:52:20,045 --> 00:52:23,005
Speaker 13:  thing. And so like no one else really like offers that core Sonos value.

842
00:52:23,905 --> 00:52:25,405
Speaker 13:  And so I think that's still there.

843
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:29,605
Speaker 2:  But it seems like Sonos has kind of burned that perception. Yeah. In a, in

844
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,725
Speaker 2:  a real way. Like deserved or not it has, it has burned that perception from

845
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:36,565
Speaker 2:  people. And so, and I guess this brings

846
00:52:36,765 --> 00:52:40,485
Speaker 2:  us a little bit to Pinewood, which is well why don't you explain,

847
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:43,685
Speaker 2:  you've, you've, you've seen that, you know what the thing looks like. Yeah.

848
00:52:43,685 --> 00:52:45,485
Speaker 2:  You've heard a bunch about it. What is Pinewood?

849
00:52:46,445 --> 00:52:48,805
Speaker 13:  So they got back on track late last year with the culture. We should mention

850
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:52,165
Speaker 13:  that, which was great. Fantastic soundbar. And so it proves like they, they

851
00:52:52,165 --> 00:52:55,925
Speaker 13:  still know how to make a very good speaker, you know? And so that, that

852
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:59,885
Speaker 13:  was promising. I think that helped boost morale at the company back to

853
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,005
Speaker 13:  where it needed to be. But even

854
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:04,245
Speaker 2:  Like I read your review of of that of the Ultra Yeah. And you're like,

855
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:05,565
Speaker 13:  Don't call it a comeback yet.

856
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:09,045
Speaker 2:  That's the thing. Even still, it's like this thing is great. It it is, it

857
00:53:09,045 --> 00:53:12,365
Speaker 2:  is proof positive that Sonos can still do the thing that it does very well.

858
00:53:13,105 --> 00:53:16,485
Speaker 13:  But the next thing is gonna be like the key indicator of like where we're

859
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:16,565
Speaker 13:  going

860
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:20,685
Speaker 2:  And there's still some reservation in you that is like I, yeah. I don't know

861
00:53:20,685 --> 00:53:23,525
Speaker 2:  if I can just wholeheartedly tell you, this thing is wonderful and you should

862
00:53:23,525 --> 00:53:26,330
Speaker 2:  get it and it will make your life better because like there's just something

863
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:31,085
Speaker 2:  that Sonos name doesn't quite communicate the safety

864
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:34,565
Speaker 2:  and excitement that it once did. Yeah. And I wonder what it'll take to get

865
00:53:34,565 --> 00:53:38,325
Speaker 2:  that back. But you're right, it is also not, it's not how Sonos proves it

866
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:40,445
Speaker 2:  can do the thing it's been trying to do for a while. Yeah.

867
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:43,085
Speaker 13:  So I think that's gonna come through the app. We'll see how much better

868
00:53:43,165 --> 00:53:46,205
Speaker 13:  it gets. And then Pinewood, which I think is coming this year as far as

869
00:53:46,245 --> 00:53:50,205
Speaker 13:  I know, a very expensive streaming box that can also serve

870
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:53,205
Speaker 13:  as an HDMI switch. So you can plug in like your gaming consoles and your

871
00:53:53,205 --> 00:53:57,005
Speaker 13:  other devices and it can like see all that stuff and switch between them.

872
00:53:57,665 --> 00:54:01,485
Speaker 13:  And you can make your own custom Sonos surround sound speaker setups.

873
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:04,205
Speaker 13:  So like you don't need a soundbar to have surround anymore or you won't,

874
00:54:04,435 --> 00:54:07,645
Speaker 13:  that'll be like one of the core selling points of Pinewood. But like

875
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:11,565
Speaker 13:  this does feel like the same kind of vibes as the ace is like you're getting

876
00:54:11,565 --> 00:54:15,485
Speaker 13:  into this like super saturated market with like people that sell like

877
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:18,605
Speaker 13:  $40 streaming boxes like KU and Amazon. Yeah. If

878
00:54:18,725 --> 00:54:22,565
Speaker 2:  Anything it's harder than the high-end headphone market because at least

879
00:54:22,565 --> 00:54:26,325
Speaker 2:  people who are spending what, $250 and up on

880
00:54:26,325 --> 00:54:30,285
Speaker 2:  headphones understand the kind of value prop there and like

881
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:34,165
Speaker 2:  you know what you're getting when you spend more money on headphones, on

882
00:54:34,515 --> 00:54:38,485
Speaker 2:  streaming boxes, all we've seen for a decade now is just an absolute

883
00:54:38,555 --> 00:54:42,445
Speaker 2:  race to the bottom. Like they will literally give you a television now

884
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,805
Speaker 2:  because Yeah. It's so there because there's just no money in selling you

885
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:49,525
Speaker 2:  the hardware. And so I think it's really interesting to see, especially after

886
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:53,405
Speaker 2:  coming off of the Ace, which I think was designed to do the same thing, right?

887
00:54:53,405 --> 00:54:57,165
Speaker 2:  Like bring the Sonos brand and ethos into a very sort of

888
00:54:57,485 --> 00:55:01,245
Speaker 2:  adjacent but very different kind of market. Yeah. To see them

889
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:05,045
Speaker 2:  willing to run this back. And, and I feel like even in the story you wrote

890
00:55:05,045 --> 00:55:09,005
Speaker 2:  about Pinewood, there seems to be some consternation inside the company about

891
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,085
Speaker 2:  like how do we not make the same mistake we made last time? Yeah. And and

892
00:55:12,085 --> 00:55:15,685
Speaker 2:  is this the thing that will actually get us there if the ace wasn't it?

893
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:19,285
Speaker 13:  We'll see like what it, the final form of this thing, like what it looks

894
00:55:19,285 --> 00:55:21,725
Speaker 13:  like, what it's priced at I I've heard it's gonna be priced between 200

895
00:55:21,725 --> 00:55:25,525
Speaker 13:  and $400, which if it's on that upper end would be obscene for

896
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:29,285
Speaker 13:  like what it is compared to like the Apple TV 4K or like the Nvidia

897
00:55:29,405 --> 00:55:32,565
Speaker 13:  Shield, which is nowhere near that expensive. So I think they have to nail

898
00:55:32,565 --> 00:55:36,205
Speaker 13:  the marketing and the messaging, which they put

899
00:55:36,485 --> 00:55:38,805
Speaker 13:  this person Lindsay in charge of marketing now she's been at Sonos for 20

900
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:41,725
Speaker 13:  years. So if anybody can like speak to like the core value and like what

901
00:55:41,725 --> 00:55:45,525
Speaker 13:  sets Sonos apart, it should be her. So that's promising.

902
00:55:46,225 --> 00:55:48,885
Speaker 13:  But as far as like what this device will do for the company, like will it

903
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:52,645
Speaker 13:  make a big difference? Hopefully it'll bring in some revenue and it'll help

904
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:55,845
Speaker 13:  grow the business. Right. You know, they keep talking about like new product

905
00:55:55,845 --> 00:55:58,685
Speaker 13:  categories. Like even on last week's call they were talking about like we

906
00:55:58,685 --> 00:56:02,125
Speaker 13:  were gonna be careful about spending every dollar making and like helping

907
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,405
Speaker 13:  to grow the company and like grow the Sonos ecosystem. And it's just like

908
00:56:05,505 --> 00:56:08,965
Speaker 13:  how, like with what products? Like you know like I'm just waiting for like

909
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:12,285
Speaker 13:  a new Sonos five. Like that's my favorite all in one speaker. It's been

910
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:15,125
Speaker 13:  around forever. They haven't, they haven't updated it in forever. It's clearly

911
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:19,165
Speaker 13:  not a priority for them. That's the product I wanna see. Or some kinda like

912
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:23,005
Speaker 13:  era 500, like a higher end speaker. But I think

913
00:56:23,045 --> 00:56:26,405
Speaker 13:  think for now it's gonna be Pinewood After that they're working on like

914
00:56:26,405 --> 00:56:30,125
Speaker 13:  a full on like receiver, like an audio receiver. I'm not sure how far along

915
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:33,965
Speaker 13:  that is, but that's in the works. But like most of all is like the app,

916
00:56:33,965 --> 00:56:36,765
Speaker 13:  like most important of all is the app. This core experience is what Tom

917
00:56:36,765 --> 00:56:40,125
Speaker 13:  Conrad called it last week on the call. He was like, we've gotta fix our

918
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:43,565
Speaker 13:  core experience. 'cause if we don't like nothing else matters. And so he's

919
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:46,925
Speaker 13:  cognizant of that, which is promising, but they've got a long road ahead.

920
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:50,365
Speaker 13:  They've gotta build back all that goodwill. They've gotta keep their employees

921
00:56:50,455 --> 00:56:54,125
Speaker 13:  happy. Which, you know, that's its own set of challenges right now.

922
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:57,885
Speaker 2:  I think I, I am curious how you

923
00:56:58,735 --> 00:57:02,685
Speaker 2:  would rate Sonos chances at being a great software company because I would

924
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:06,645
Speaker 2:  argue Sonos has been a really great like

925
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:10,565
Speaker 2:  firmware company and it is very good at making products that work

926
00:57:10,565 --> 00:57:14,085
Speaker 2:  well and work well together. And that is like sincerely an accomplishment.

927
00:57:14,925 --> 00:57:18,045
Speaker 2:  I don't know that I have ever experienced user facing

928
00:57:18,695 --> 00:57:22,325
Speaker 2:  Sonos software as like really great. And I think Sonos has had some really

929
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:25,205
Speaker 2:  interesting ideas over the years, right? Like putting all the music stuff

930
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,005
Speaker 2:  into one app I think was a really interesting idea. They've done a bunch

931
00:57:28,005 --> 00:57:31,765
Speaker 2:  of really interesting work on sort of multiple voice assistant stuff that

932
00:57:31,765 --> 00:57:35,605
Speaker 2:  I think honestly has mostly come to nothing but is like full of good ideas

933
00:57:37,145 --> 00:57:40,045
Speaker 2:  And, and again, with all of this stuff that we're talking about with Pinewood,

934
00:57:40,045 --> 00:57:43,605
Speaker 2:  the idea of like, we're gonna bring all this stuff into a more functional

935
00:57:43,605 --> 00:57:47,525
Speaker 2:  sort of universal search system is the right idea. Like I, I want all of

936
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:51,205
Speaker 2:  the things that Sonos wants to do, but I feel like the track record of them

937
00:57:51,315 --> 00:57:54,725
Speaker 2:  executing on these good ideas in software

938
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:59,125
Speaker 2:  is not impressive. Yeah. But maybe I'm, maybe I'm being too pessimistic

939
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:02,965
Speaker 2:  because I mostly just use like the Spotify airplay thing to my Sonos speaker.

940
00:58:03,065 --> 00:58:06,605
Speaker 2:  So maybe I'm not giving Sonos enough credit, but like is there a good software

941
00:58:06,605 --> 00:58:07,885
Speaker 2:  company inside of this company?

942
00:58:09,525 --> 00:58:13,405
Speaker 13:  I think there is. I mean, so like last week Tom said

943
00:58:13,405 --> 00:58:17,165
Speaker 13:  that the hardware team or the software team is like twice the size of the

944
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,485
Speaker 13:  hardware team. So they've got a lot more people working on, on software

945
00:58:19,485 --> 00:58:22,045
Speaker 13:  than hardware. And so you would hope that there's a good software company

946
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:24,645
Speaker 13:  inside there. I think there are people who would care who wanna like fix

947
00:58:24,645 --> 00:58:27,165
Speaker 13:  this app and get it to where it needs to be. Like the ideas in the app are

948
00:58:27,165 --> 00:58:30,245
Speaker 13:  good, you know, it's design is is nice. But as far as like will it ever

949
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:33,765
Speaker 13:  be like an Apple type UX quality? I don't know. You know, we,

950
00:58:33,825 --> 00:58:37,285
Speaker 13:  people have been saying forever like why won't Apple just buy Sonos? They

951
00:58:37,285 --> 00:58:40,565
Speaker 13:  could probably get a bargain right now if they wanted to. Probably true.

952
00:58:41,145 --> 00:58:44,365
Speaker 13:  But as far as like Sonos core software ability, you know, we'll see. I mean

953
00:58:44,365 --> 00:58:46,565
Speaker 13:  it's usable. It works, it did work.

954
00:58:48,685 --> 00:58:52,125
Speaker 13:  And so I think it, yeah, it's fine for the purpose. People don't expect

955
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:54,765
Speaker 13:  like miracles from this company just make the stuff work, right? I mean

956
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:57,405
Speaker 13:  stuff like volume started to like take a long time, like changing the volume

957
00:58:57,545 --> 00:59:01,445
Speaker 13:  on a speaker. If that has lagged then you've, you've

958
00:59:01,445 --> 00:59:04,965
Speaker 13:  certainly gone astray. And so things like that are slowly getting fixed

959
00:59:04,965 --> 00:59:08,885
Speaker 13:  finally. But yeah, there's a lot of, a lot of work to do, a lot,

960
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:10,365
Speaker 13:  a lot of polishing. Yeah.

961
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:12,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's, it's gonna be a really interesting year because I think the,

962
00:59:12,805 --> 00:59:16,045
Speaker 2:  the fact that Sonos is working on both a high-end receiver

963
00:59:17,025 --> 00:59:20,925
Speaker 2:  and a set top box signals to me that maybe this company is not,

964
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,365
Speaker 2:  not exactly sure what its audience wants from it. For me it's just like,

965
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:28,245
Speaker 2:  just keep making Romes, just gimme more and more like go the,

966
00:59:28,305 --> 00:59:31,685
Speaker 2:  the like Logitech ultimate ears strategy and just give me romes of every

967
00:59:31,695 --> 00:59:34,605
Speaker 2:  imaginable shape and size and price. Yeah. And I'll almost certainly end

968
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:38,045
Speaker 2:  up buying them all. The Rome two is great, so that's fine.

969
00:59:38,395 --> 00:59:41,205
Speaker 13:  Rome two is great. The move to is fantastic that like, that's my favorite

970
00:59:41,255 --> 00:59:44,285
Speaker 13:  thing of theirs right now is the move to speaker. It's so good. If it

971
00:59:44,285 --> 00:59:46,325
Speaker 2:  Wasn't so huge I would probably have gotten a move.

972
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:50,085
Speaker 13:  Yeah, yeah. Fair. But like Pinewood, you know, I think it was so far like

973
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:51,885
Speaker 13:  towards the release center or Patrick that they couldn't just cancel it

974
00:59:51,885 --> 00:59:54,165
Speaker 13:  like yeah, you know they spent all that money on like r and d and like,

975
00:59:54,185 --> 00:59:56,245
Speaker 13:  you know, it's getting it out the door so it's like close enough, let's

976
00:59:56,245 --> 00:59:59,405
Speaker 13:  get it out, see how it does. Hopefully you know, they can like find the

977
00:59:59,405 --> 01:00:03,165
Speaker 13:  right messaging, the right appeal and sell it to their core customer base,

978
01:00:03,165 --> 01:00:06,005
Speaker 13:  which people have been like asking for like a custom like surround sound

979
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:09,765
Speaker 13:  option out of Sonos forever. So yeah, so if it offers that, like people

980
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:13,485
Speaker 13:  will pay for it, some people will will buy it and if they can like, you

981
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,005
Speaker 13:  know, like somehow do like unified search with Netflix, which has always

982
01:00:16,005 --> 01:00:18,725
Speaker 13:  been stubborn about like trying to like have their content mixed with other

983
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:22,765
Speaker 13:  services. Like if they can make that work somehow and I don't see how Sonos

984
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:26,605
Speaker 13:  would be that company, but maybe I'll be surprised. Yeah. So we'll

985
01:00:26,605 --> 01:00:26,765
Speaker 13:  see.

986
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:30,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah as ever Sonos seems to be working on the thing I would want

987
01:00:31,105 --> 01:00:34,325
Speaker 2:  and we'll just, we'll see how it actually goes. But yeah, what is the state

988
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:37,725
Speaker 2:  of the Sonos app at this point before we go? I, I have essentially stopped

989
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:41,565
Speaker 2:  using it in all of the chaos. It's fine but like

990
01:00:41,565 --> 01:00:43,005
Speaker 2:  are people happy again? Is it back?

991
01:00:44,245 --> 01:00:47,085
Speaker 13:  It's up and down on the Sonos sub. That's my main way of like gauging how

992
01:00:47,085 --> 01:00:49,565
Speaker 13:  things are going. I just check in like some people say it's gotten a lot

993
01:00:49,565 --> 01:00:53,365
Speaker 13:  better this last month, like in particular. So I think, you know,

994
01:00:53,915 --> 01:00:57,485
Speaker 13:  yeah they're making steady progress. I don't think layoffs help make an

995
01:00:57,485 --> 01:01:00,845
Speaker 13:  app better, especially when it, there were quite a few engineers who were

996
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:04,805
Speaker 13:  let go in this latest round, which seems kind of mystifying but

997
01:01:04,805 --> 01:01:08,605
Speaker 13:  slowly but surely they're getting back to where it needs to be and we'll

998
01:01:08,605 --> 01:01:11,565
Speaker 13:  just have to see like was too much damage done all for a set of headphones.

999
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:15,165
Speaker 13:  That could have been great. But I mean one of the funniest quotes

1000
01:01:15,525 --> 01:01:18,765
Speaker 13:  last week on the call, the CFO was like, the ACE came out at the worst possible

1001
01:01:18,765 --> 01:01:22,525
Speaker 13:  time like in regards to our app. It's like, well whose fault was that? Like

1002
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:22,765
Speaker 13:  you

1003
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:24,005
Speaker 2:  Who could have known,

1004
01:01:25,345 --> 01:01:28,005
Speaker 13:  Who could have foreseen the situation,

1005
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:33,005
Speaker 13:  it would just ruin your headphones forever. So yeah, they're gonna

1006
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:35,525
Speaker 13:  headphones. It is sad. They cost a little bit too much I think for what

1007
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,005
Speaker 13:  they are. So like a price cut would help I think boost those up a little

1008
01:01:38,005 --> 01:01:39,805
Speaker 13:  bit. But you know.

1009
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:43,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I look forward to buying like a refurbished pair of Ace

1010
01:01:43,955 --> 01:01:47,925
Speaker 2:  when exactly the ACE two inevitably come out and I I'm sure I'll like

1011
01:01:47,925 --> 01:01:48,325
Speaker 2:  them very much.

1012
01:01:49,945 --> 01:01:51,165
Speaker 2:  All right Chris, thank you as

1013
01:03:37,755 --> 01:03:41,255
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the hotline as always. The number 8 6 6

1014
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:45,495
Speaker 2:  VERGE one, one, the email vergecast at The Verge dot com. Send us all

1015
01:03:45,495 --> 01:03:49,055
Speaker 2:  of your questions. We try to answer as many of them as we can. We've gotten

1016
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:53,055
Speaker 2:  a few recently that have sent me on like huge giant reporting journeys that

1017
01:03:53,055 --> 01:03:56,695
Speaker 2:  are gonna turn into fun stuff on this show. So all of your thoughts, questions,

1018
01:03:56,755 --> 01:04:00,655
Speaker 2:  big or small, send 'em all to us this week. We have a question about

1019
01:04:00,855 --> 01:04:01,175
Speaker 2:  business cards.

1020
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:06,745
Speaker 18:  Hey guys, my name is Derek. I've in the past, we're

1021
01:04:06,745 --> 01:04:10,505
Speaker 18:  talking several years ago now, was able to take a picture of a

1022
01:04:10,705 --> 01:04:14,345
Speaker 18:  business card when somebody handed it to me and my phone,

1023
01:04:14,565 --> 01:04:18,185
Speaker 18:  my Android phone would prompt me to add it to my contact.

1024
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:22,425
Speaker 18:  It was one click, it was really easy. It generally works pretty well. Sometimes

1025
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:26,065
Speaker 18:  there was a mis number, but most everything worked well. Now

1026
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:29,985
Speaker 18:  if I take a photo of business card who will prompt me to go

1027
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:34,205
Speaker 18:  buy business cards, which is not useful at all. I was

1028
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:37,965
Speaker 18:  wondering is there a current way to do this or

1029
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:41,885
Speaker 18:  is this just a lost bit of history to the internet?

1030
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:46,225
Speaker 2:  Right? So I have two thoughts on this. One is that I miss

1031
01:04:46,535 --> 01:04:50,185
Speaker 2:  when phone cameras did a better job of kind of

1032
01:04:50,185 --> 01:04:54,105
Speaker 2:  automatically adapting to what was in them. Right now you have lots

1033
01:04:54,105 --> 01:04:57,825
Speaker 2:  of options in your camera and they do a pretty good job of like

1034
01:04:57,825 --> 01:05:00,625
Speaker 2:  seeing what's in the photo after you take the photo. One of the cool things

1035
01:05:00,845 --> 01:05:04,825
Speaker 2:  AI can do is pretty usefully recognize what's inside a photo,

1036
01:05:05,765 --> 01:05:09,025
Speaker 2:  but cameras increasingly don't even try to do this in real time. I think

1037
01:05:09,455 --> 01:05:13,425
Speaker 2:  they realize that doing something like scanning a business card in your

1038
01:05:13,425 --> 01:05:17,405
Speaker 2:  phone camera app is a relatively niche feature, which is true. And so in

1039
01:05:17,405 --> 01:05:20,885
Speaker 2:  the name of making these very important camera apps simpler,

1040
01:05:21,275 --> 01:05:24,885
Speaker 2:  they just decided to take all that stuff out, which

1041
01:05:25,115 --> 01:05:29,005
Speaker 2:  fine, I suppose I understand, but I do miss that. And I think the

1042
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:32,965
Speaker 2:  idea of having a camera that recognizes what you're looking at

1043
01:05:32,985 --> 01:05:36,245
Speaker 2:  and adapts itself accordingly is actually about to make a comeback. We're

1044
01:05:36,245 --> 01:05:39,885
Speaker 2:  thinking about things like visual intelligence and all of these multimodal

1045
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:44,015
Speaker 2:  AI systems that relies on understanding what's on the other side of

1046
01:05:44,015 --> 01:05:47,615
Speaker 2:  your camera. So it's possible that we are going to inadvertently

1047
01:05:47,805 --> 01:05:51,735
Speaker 2:  resolve this business card problem, just not yet. In the meantime,

1048
01:05:51,825 --> 01:05:55,655
Speaker 2:  there are basically two places you can go. One

1049
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:59,855
Speaker 2:  is a business card specific app

1050
01:06:00,035 --> 01:06:02,695
Speaker 2:  and there are lots of those out there. There's one called Haystack that's

1051
01:06:02,695 --> 01:06:06,255
Speaker 2:  pretty popular. There's one called Hi, hello, that's pretty popular. There's

1052
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:10,055
Speaker 2:  Biz Connect. There's one called Cam Card I think, which

1053
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:14,295
Speaker 2:  sounds creepier than it actually is. But anyway, all of these things

1054
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:17,855
Speaker 2:  want to be more than just business card scanning apps. They want to be like

1055
01:06:17,855 --> 01:06:21,135
Speaker 2:  contact management and CRM systems. They're designed for people who like

1056
01:06:21,135 --> 01:06:24,615
Speaker 2:  get a lot of business cards and have to do a lot of lead generation and following

1057
01:06:24,615 --> 01:06:27,975
Speaker 2:  up. They do a pretty good job with business card scanning,

1058
01:06:28,635 --> 01:06:31,975
Speaker 2:  but I don't recommend using them. They all want access to your contacts.

1059
01:06:31,975 --> 01:06:35,855
Speaker 2:  They all want you to subscribe to stuff. They all want to be a bigger platform

1060
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:39,735
Speaker 2:  than just a place to scan a business card. You can use those apps, but I

1061
01:06:39,735 --> 01:06:43,295
Speaker 2:  don't recommend it. What I would do instead is use a more

1062
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:47,295
Speaker 2:  generic document scanning app. And there are a bunch of ways to do this.

1063
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:51,375
Speaker 2:  You can do something like take a picture in Apple Notes and then actually

1064
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:54,695
Speaker 2:  search for that person's name. If you wanna just store all your business

1065
01:06:54,695 --> 01:06:58,655
Speaker 2:  cards in a note. Google Drive also does this very well. You can just take

1066
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:02,055
Speaker 2:  a picture in the Drive app and it will scan the document and upload it and

1067
01:07:02,055 --> 01:07:04,695
Speaker 2:  then If you search for the name or whatever, it'll actually surface the business

1068
01:07:04,695 --> 01:07:08,655
Speaker 2:  card. That's the simple way, the most

1069
01:07:08,985 --> 01:07:12,095
Speaker 2:  impressive way I think. And the thing I would recommend to anyone looking

1070
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:16,015
Speaker 2:  to do this is just to use the Adobe Scan app. It's free.

1071
01:07:16,515 --> 01:07:19,895
Speaker 2:  It again wants to upsell you into the whole creative cloud ecosystem and

1072
01:07:19,895 --> 01:07:23,095
Speaker 2:  make it all really complicated. But you can just avoid all of that and just

1073
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,455
Speaker 2:  take pictures with the scan app and do everything you want.

1074
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:30,095
Speaker 2:  And the thing that I really like about it is when you open the scan app,

1075
01:07:30,095 --> 01:07:33,935
Speaker 2:  it lets you choose what you're taking a picture of. You can, you can pick

1076
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:37,895
Speaker 2:  a whiteboard or a book or a document or an ID card or a business card.

1077
01:07:38,435 --> 01:07:42,375
Speaker 2:  And that actually again adapts the camera to take different kinds of pictures

1078
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:46,335
Speaker 2:  and pull different kinds of information out on the business card. One in

1079
01:07:46,335 --> 01:07:50,175
Speaker 2:  particular, when you take a picture, it will actually allow you then

1080
01:07:50,355 --> 01:07:53,815
Speaker 2:  to save it directly to your contacts. It will extract the information out

1081
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:57,655
Speaker 2:  and dump it into your contacts and it does that directly on your device in

1082
01:07:57,655 --> 01:08:01,535
Speaker 2:  a way that I like very much. The scan app is not perfect.

1083
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:06,135
Speaker 2:  It seems to really want a business card that is

1084
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:10,215
Speaker 2:  optimized in a very specific way, like big company logo

1085
01:08:10,275 --> 01:08:13,935
Speaker 2:  at the top and then below it in like smaller bold letters,

1086
01:08:14,055 --> 01:08:17,965
Speaker 2:  person's name and then below it. Lots of information. If you get

1087
01:08:17,965 --> 01:08:20,965
Speaker 2:  one like that, it will almost always get it right. But I'm looking at one

1088
01:08:20,965 --> 01:08:24,845
Speaker 2:  right now that has the first and last name in

1089
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:28,725
Speaker 2:  big blue letters and right below it in smaller letters, the

1090
01:08:28,835 --> 01:08:32,805
Speaker 2:  company name and it thinks of those things in reverse. So

1091
01:08:32,805 --> 01:08:36,165
Speaker 2:  it thinks this person whose name is Daniel is the name of the company and

1092
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:38,845
Speaker 2:  it thinks their company is their first name. So I had to go in and fix that

1093
01:08:38,965 --> 01:08:42,685
Speaker 2:  a little bit, but it got their email address right, it got their phone number

1094
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:46,165
Speaker 2:  right. It like pulled all of the relevant data pretty successfully,

1095
01:08:46,475 --> 01:08:49,885
Speaker 2:  certainly easier than manually typing this whole thing into the context on

1096
01:08:49,885 --> 01:08:53,565
Speaker 2:  my computer. There are again, lots of apps that will scan

1097
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:57,405
Speaker 2:  information on business cards and like use OCR optical

1098
01:08:57,405 --> 01:09:01,245
Speaker 2:  character recognition to pull it out so that you can find it later. But Adobe

1099
01:09:01,355 --> 01:09:05,125
Speaker 2:  Scan is just the most straightforward, most simple one that actually

1100
01:09:05,195 --> 01:09:08,125
Speaker 2:  will pull out the information and then let you put it where you want it to,

1101
01:09:08,175 --> 01:09:11,645
Speaker 2:  which is in your contacts and it does it with no strings attached

1102
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:15,085
Speaker 2:  as long as you ignore the occasional upsell to Creative Cloud. And hey, If

1103
01:09:15,085 --> 01:09:18,805
Speaker 2:  you already pay for Creative Cloud, terrific. You can also have PDFs of your

1104
01:09:19,005 --> 01:09:22,965
Speaker 2:  business cards. So that's what I'd recommend. Put the scan app on

1105
01:09:22,965 --> 01:09:25,645
Speaker 2:  your home screen and you can also use it. It's really handy for doing things

1106
01:09:25,645 --> 01:09:28,845
Speaker 2:  like scanning documents and turning them into editable PDFs.

1107
01:09:29,435 --> 01:09:33,365
Speaker 2:  It's really great when you wanna take a picture of a whiteboard or any kinds

1108
01:09:33,365 --> 01:09:37,245
Speaker 2:  of these other things that you wanna make not only accessible but actually

1109
01:09:37,395 --> 01:09:40,725
Speaker 2:  extract the information out of and make it useful in some other way.

1110
01:09:41,105 --> 01:09:44,165
Speaker 2:  That's like Adobe's whole thing, right? They want you to then go use Acrobat

1111
01:09:44,165 --> 01:09:47,965
Speaker 2:  to mess with the PDF. But the good news is you don't have to, you can just

1112
01:09:47,965 --> 01:09:51,245
Speaker 2:  dump all this stuff where you need it to be and move on with your day. So

1113
01:09:51,245 --> 01:09:54,965
Speaker 2:  that's my recommendation. Use Adobe Scan. But also I am curious if

1114
01:09:55,205 --> 01:09:59,165
Speaker 2:  a, you found a way in the default camera app on your phone to do something

1115
01:09:59,165 --> 01:10:02,645
Speaker 2:  cool and interesting with this, or B, if there's another app for scanning

1116
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:06,165
Speaker 2:  business cards in particular, but really documents of all kind that you like

1117
01:10:06,325 --> 01:10:10,085
Speaker 2:  better than Adobe Scan. I wanna hear about that too. This is a thing I

1118
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:13,765
Speaker 2:  encounter more than I've realized in the past. Not even just with business

1119
01:10:13,765 --> 01:10:17,325
Speaker 2:  cards, but like in an effort to go fully paperless and just

1120
01:10:17,915 --> 01:10:21,725
Speaker 2:  dump all of the paper bills and like I got a speeding

1121
01:10:21,725 --> 01:10:25,645
Speaker 2:  ticket the other day because Washington DC has the speeding cameras and

1122
01:10:25,645 --> 01:10:29,285
Speaker 2:  they are ruthless and it would be nice to just be able to like take a picture

1123
01:10:29,285 --> 01:10:32,885
Speaker 2:  of that, pull out the information and upload it. And you can kind of sorta

1124
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:36,645
Speaker 2:  do that in lots of ways and they kind of sort of work, but it does feel like

1125
01:10:36,645 --> 01:10:39,885
Speaker 2:  this could all be better and Adobe Scan is the best I've found. But If you

1126
01:10:39,885 --> 01:10:43,485
Speaker 2:  have a better idea, if, especially if it is wonky and complicated and

1127
01:10:43,645 --> 01:10:47,565
Speaker 2:  involves a lot of weird AI stuff, I want to hear all about it. For now,

1128
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:51,325
Speaker 2:  that is it for our show. Thank you to

1129
01:10:51,475 --> 01:10:54,405
Speaker 2:  everybody who was on the show. Thank you to everybody who called the hotline

1130
01:10:54,465 --> 01:10:57,405
Speaker 2:  and thank you as always for listening. There's lots more on everything. We

1131
01:10:57,405 --> 01:11:01,205
Speaker 2:  talked about all of Alex Heath's coverage of Meta in his Command line

1132
01:11:01,205 --> 01:11:05,125
Speaker 2:  newsletter and elsewhere, all of Chris Welch's Sonos coverage, lots of stuff.

1133
01:11:05,585 --> 01:11:09,405
Speaker 2:  He convinced me to buy a pair of the new Powerbeats Pro headphones. You can

1134
01:11:09,405 --> 01:11:12,565
Speaker 2:  read the songs review all on the website. I'll put some stuff in the show
