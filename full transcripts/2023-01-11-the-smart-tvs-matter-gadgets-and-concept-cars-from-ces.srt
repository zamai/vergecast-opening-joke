Speaker 4:  Hello. Two of the three of these people were at CES last

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,960
Speaker 4:  week and so we're gonna be talking a lot about CES today. We're gonna

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,120
Speaker 4:  be talking about smart homes, we're gonna be smart talking about TVs. And

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,280
Speaker 4:  as you probably guessed from Andy being here, we're gonna be talking about

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,680
Speaker 4:  cars and next week we're gonna have another special episode

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,600
Speaker 4:  still getting into ces, where we're gonna be talking with Monica all about

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,440
Speaker 4:  the laptops and the weird dual screen laptop that she's actually

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,920
Speaker 4:  obsessed with. And we're gonna talk with Victoria Song about all kinds of

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,320
Speaker 4:  health stuff that happened at the show. But today we're talking about what

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,280
Speaker 4:  really matters matter.

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,040
Speaker 5:  That was my segue there, wasn't it?

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,240
Speaker 4:  That was your segue. But let's, let's get get started because Jen, it

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,120
Speaker 4:  feels like we, we voted matter as like the thing of c e s.

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,960
Speaker 4:  This was, this was the big thing at ces. You, you made a very

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,680
Speaker 4:  passionate case for it. Now you have to do it again for all of our listeners.

33
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,040
Speaker 5:  I did not, it was not my suggestion. I just wanna point that out.

34
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,840
Speaker 5:  I, I held back, I mean not that I didn't agree, but you know, it was kind

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,240
Speaker 5:  of obvious coming from me. But the rest of the team actually was like, you

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,000
Speaker 5:  know, it was kind of the thing, we couldn't escape it.

37
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,520
Speaker 5:  Even Chris was like, the Samsung booth was terrible

38
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,600
Speaker 5:  because it was all smart home. So okay, weird. He said it was weird. Not

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,200
Speaker 5:  terrible, sorry.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,240
Speaker 6:  It was different cuz you expect like every year you go there and it's like

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,320
Speaker 6:  TVs and gaming monitors and all this flashy stuff and hardware and this year

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,720
Speaker 6:  some of that stuff was there. But like on the whole, just like Jen saying

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,480
Speaker 6:  it was all matter stuff and smart things, this and that and it was just very

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,800
Speaker 6:  different.

45
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,800
Speaker 5:  It was very notable. I mean the last, so the first CS I went to,

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,440
Speaker 5:  I wanna say it was 2019 and I remember going to the Samsung booth which was

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,280
Speaker 5:  the, which was, you know the, the place that Chris loves

48
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,840
Speaker 5:  huge TVs. It was I think when they debuted the wall and in one

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Speaker 5:  little corner I managed to find a smart things hub and a few sensors.

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,880
Speaker 5:  And then this year the entire booth was smart things

51
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,680
Speaker 5:  and you literally had to go find the TV that was hidden in a room somewhere.

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Speaker 5:  I mean it was, it was notable and

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,400
Speaker 5:  that's not the case for everyone. But you know, the LGS booth still had the

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Speaker 5:  giant walls of TVs and, but Samsung really went all

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Speaker 5:  out with smart things and the smart home and in general, so

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,880
Speaker 5:  for people that aren't familiar, CES isn't two venues. So there's the

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,600
Speaker 5:  big Las Vegas convention center, which is where the Samsung and the LG booths

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,200
Speaker 5:  are. And then there's the Venetian Convention Center formerly called the

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,000
Speaker 5:  Sands, which is where the smart home had always been put and again

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
Speaker 5:  had sort of been in a corner in the conference room in the major sort of

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 5:  conference space. And now again you walked in and it was the first thing

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,920
Speaker 5:  you saw and it took up half the show floor. It was, it was definitely Smart

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,800
Speaker 5:  Home's year and Matter obviously is a big topic in the smart home

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Speaker 5:  right now. So Matter was everywhere. I mean literally I

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,280
Speaker 5:  took our video director to try and sort of shoot some footage cuz when we

66
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,000
Speaker 5:  announced that matter was the best in show, he said, what am I supposed to

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 5:  shoot? It's not a tv.

68
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,280
Speaker 5:  What do I shoot? So we went around looking for the

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Speaker 5:  logos and yes the, and they were everywhere. I think as I said in

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Speaker 5:  my piece, it was like the easiest game of Wears Waldorf ever because

71
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,520
Speaker 5:  they were just matter logos just

72
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,400
Speaker 4:  Per everywhere.

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,160
Speaker 5:  Just perforating. Yes but, and you know, it's not like now matters

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,480
Speaker 5:  here, it's ready and we can all just run off and enjoy this great new smart

75
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,400
Speaker 5:  home. It's still early days but the sheer number of announcements,

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,280
Speaker 5:  the sheer number of new products, the real concrete details we,

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,920
Speaker 5:  we are getting about how this smart home protocol is gonna work in our homes

78
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,040
Speaker 5:  definitely made it feel like something much more tangible than it has been

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,760
Speaker 5:  for the last three years. So that was one of the reasons we kind of gave

80
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,080
Speaker 5:  it this big accolade.

81
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,040
Speaker 4:  Well kind of walk us through those, those details cuz honestly I was

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,240
Speaker 4:  surprised to see Samsung Smart things come back. I feel like it has a really

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,320
Speaker 4:  passionate, really small user base

84
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,600
Speaker 4:  and and now it seems like Samsung's like oh wait, we still have this, we

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,080
Speaker 4:  should do something with It matters here.

86
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah so from the smart things side, I mean the smart things you see

87
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,760
Speaker 5:  today is not really the smart things you are thinking of not the original

88
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,080
Speaker 5:  kind of groovy based smart things for the

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
Speaker 5:  tinkerers that's still there. And they're very keen to point out that you

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
Speaker 5:  know, they haven't got rid of that although they are transitioning. But what

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,120
Speaker 5:  smart things really is now today is Samsung's connectivity

92
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,440
Speaker 5:  platform for its home appliances and TVs. Okay. But they

93
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
Speaker 5:  have remained open. So it's always been the most

94
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,840
Speaker 5:  open of all the smart home platforms because it, it works with ZigBee and

95
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,680
Speaker 5:  Z-Wave and a whole host of cloud provided smart

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,560
Speaker 5:  home integrations too. So you know, you can use, I am I allowed to

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,440
Speaker 5:  say things like Alexa or people gonna get mad at me, but you can use the

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,120
Speaker 5:  Amazon Smart Home Assistant, the Google Smart Home assistant or with

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,320
Speaker 5:  smart things, it's very open, it's very interoperable and they're keeping

100
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,000
Speaker 5:  that and then Matter obviously is making it even more open.

101
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,520
Speaker 5:  So it means that now things will work with Apple Home as well as Samsung

102
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,760
Speaker 5:  Smart things. You know, and Apple obviously wasn't on the show floor but

103
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,720
Speaker 5:  it was a big part of what's make, you know, the push for matter.

104
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,480
Speaker 5:  They created matter along with all of the other companies we've mentioned

105
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,200
Speaker 5:  and as they like to say, they contributed the main framework of home kit

106
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,000
Speaker 5:  to the matter protocol. So it feels a lot like using Apple

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,880
Speaker 5:  Home Kit when you use Matter products which I've done managed to use a few

108
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,600
Speaker 5:  and it is, it does feel a lot like using Apple Home with a

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,000
Speaker 5:  sprinkle of smart things and a sprinkle of Amazon and a touch of Google.

110
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,560
Speaker 4:  So you they felt like Apple was still kind of there at the show even though

111
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,560
Speaker 4:  they weren't

112
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
Speaker 5:  Actually isn't that always the way?

113
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,360
Speaker 4:  But they don't have a booth, there's not like a special room where you go

114
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,320
Speaker 4:  and meet with Apple people unless you're doing like talking about monitors

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,600
Speaker 4:  that you wanna own.

116
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,360
Speaker 5:  No, yeah they're not there. There's no home kit presence but a lot of new

117
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,760
Speaker 5:  products that were announced were from companies that traditionally hadn't

118
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,560
Speaker 5:  worked with Apple Home and now because of Matter

119
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,440
Speaker 5:  are gonna be able to work in that ecosystem because Apple is fully

120
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,360
Speaker 5:  in on matter. So if your device works with Matter it will work

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,200
Speaker 5:  with Apple Home. And then there's the vice Versa Pro products that only worked

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,960
Speaker 5:  with Apple Home will now work outside of Apple Home like that

123
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,720
Speaker 5:  Eve, which we've who we've covered quite extensively. But for example like

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,680
Speaker 5:  Govie and Ye Light and GE Sync are

125
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,640
Speaker 5:  all brands that have light lighting cuz lighting's big and matter right now

126
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,320
Speaker 5:  cause it's one of the first device types supported, those companies

127
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,280
Speaker 5:  all announce products that will now support matter. That

128
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Speaker 5:  means you can buy those inexpensive, which is not normally something that

129
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,800
Speaker 5:  you associate with Apple Home products. Those inexpensive devices

130
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,760
Speaker 5:  will now work with Apple Home if you want to use that as your main matter

131
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,040
Speaker 5:  interface. And you know, that's quite exciting for a lot of people that like

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,760
Speaker 5:  Apple Home because it has traditionally been an expensive smart home space

133
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,560
Speaker 5:  to play in. And you know, Amazon on the other hand you can use

134
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,240
Speaker 5:  its smart home assistant with many inexpensive

135
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,120
Speaker 5:  brands that you can find on Amazon of dubious quality in some

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,840
Speaker 5:  cases. But

137
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah, like I, I think I gave up on using Amazon as my smart home because

138
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,560
Speaker 4:  it just, I moved houses and it was like okay you need to

139
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,920
Speaker 4:  manually delete every single light and then manually

140
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,000
Speaker 4:  re-add every single light. And I had like 20 lights on there and I was like

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
Speaker 4:  no I'm just stop, I'm just done here.

142
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,280
Speaker 5:  They fix that, they have fixed that or about to fix that. Okay. That's quite

143
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,120
Speaker 5:  exciting. It's not really to do with matter. I'm I'm hoping it will

144
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,080
Speaker 5:  become an a thing with matter though because there could be a lot of duplicates

145
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,120
Speaker 5:  if you start using multiple smart home platforms that that could

146
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,600
Speaker 5:  be one of the problems but hopefully so what's kind of happening with Matter

147
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,560
Speaker 5:  is that each company is doing something new or bringing a new

148
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,440
Speaker 5:  sort of slant to it and we are kind of waiting to see whether

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,520
Speaker 5:  the other companies will all follow track because the whole point of matter

150
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,200
Speaker 5:  is that everyone should be able to be interoperable in the same way. So for

151
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,760
Speaker 5:  example, the Amazon feature is there now working with

152
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,640
Speaker 5:  device group sync. So if you have, if you

153
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Speaker 5:  add a device to Amazon and you also, you know, it's say it's a hub

154
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,400
Speaker 5:  bulb rather than it being called Kitchen light in Hue and then

155
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,360
Speaker 5:  just light one in Amazon, which is for some reason the way it defaults

156
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,320
Speaker 5:  now it will sync the name across which is gonna be really useful cause you

157
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,920
Speaker 5:  know when you say hey a turn on the lights and it's like you have

158
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,880
Speaker 5:  500 devices named light, which one would you like to turn on?

159
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,800
Speaker 5:  This will help with that. And you know that kind of just keeping your smart

160
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,600
Speaker 5:  home a bit tidier cuz you're so right. You should see my Amazon Alexa app.

161
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,520
Speaker 5:  It's kind of scary how many devices I have in it and

162
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,360
Speaker 4:  I I think we're gonna save that one for the Halloween episode. Like we

163
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,640
Speaker 4:  can't show that right now. It's too sensitive, too scary.

164
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,280
Speaker 7:  I have a question. Yes.

165
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,520
Speaker 5:  And

166
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,560
Speaker 7:  As a smart home agnostic, I don't have any smart devices

167
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,880
Speaker 7:  in my home and I'm generally wary of

168
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,680
Speaker 7:  handing over my personal data to companies like this and

169
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,360
Speaker 7:  I have, you know, sort of like the the basic laundry list of concerns that

170
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,320
Speaker 7:  people have for not for not, you know, installing any of these devices

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,080
Speaker 7:  in your home. Did you get a sense from the show that the companies

172
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Speaker 7:  that are building these, these products are getting better at bringing new

173
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Speaker 7:  people in as consumers or they, do you feel like they're, they're preaching

174
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,080
Speaker 7:  to the choir and still continuing to send sell things to like the people

175
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,120
Speaker 7:  who are already like invested in turning their home into a smart home?

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,520
Speaker 5:  That's an excellent question and actually one that was definitely on everyone's

177
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,400
Speaker 5:  mind because it is the latter because Matter

178
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,320
Speaker 5:  isn't actually going to be that great initially for people

179
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,960
Speaker 5:  who are already invested in the smart home. It isn't as

180
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,200
Speaker 5:  functionally advanced so you won't be able to do things like adaptive lighting

181
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,000
Speaker 5:  so you know where you have your lights change color with in sync with the

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,960
Speaker 5:  sun or dynamic lighting effects like you know, your

183
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,840
Speaker 5:  hue lights will kind of flash with your tv. Those kind of things,

184
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,760
Speaker 5:  those features aren't available in matter so doesn't mean you won't be

185
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,480
Speaker 5:  able to use them, you'll just have to use the relevant company's app

186
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,200
Speaker 5:  to get to that function. So really what matter is designed

187
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,920
Speaker 5:  for is to be really simple for people who've never used the smart home

188
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Speaker 5:  before. So that when you go to the, you go to Lowe's or you

189
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,600
Speaker 5:  shop on Amazon or Best Buy and you are like, well I need a new

190
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,520
Speaker 5:  thermostat and maybe I need some new light bulbs and you buy them and as

191
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,040
Speaker 5:  long as they work with matter then you can set them up with any smartphone,

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,800
Speaker 5:  any ecosystem, any smart speaker you have in your house. You don't have to

193
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,480
Speaker 5:  look for all the little works with badge to see whether it works with your

194
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,400
Speaker 5:  phone or works with your voice assistant. So that's really the sort of

195
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,280
Speaker 5:  core purpose of matter is to make it really simple so that everyone can use

196
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,200
Speaker 5:  it. Because right now the smart home is not simple, it's far from it,

197
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
Speaker 5:  which is why I have a job really

198
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,840
Speaker 7:  Well thank God for that. Then

199
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Speaker 4:  It's like Jen HomeBridge hoops, these guys are like we we need,

200
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,680
Speaker 4:  we needed to be super complex for as long as

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,560
Speaker 5:  Possible. Yeah, I mean home and and Matter does work with those

202
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,760
Speaker 5:  platforms too. So you know, it's less exciting right now for people who

203
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,720
Speaker 5:  are already really deeply involved in the smart home. The most excited

204
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,440
Speaker 5:  group was probably the home kit users because they're getting access to

205
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,400
Speaker 5:  devices that they didn't have and they won't have to use devices, they won't

206
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,760
Speaker 5:  have to use hoops and HomeBridge to bring those devices into their

207
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
Speaker 5:  ecosystem. Like your Nest thermostat will work in home kit

208
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,480
Speaker 5:  natively. Now your new one though, not the old one, which is really annoying

209
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,840
Speaker 5:  cuz I want the learning thermostat in my home kit. But anyway

210
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,400
Speaker 5:  digress. Yes and that's where you hear a lot of complaints about matters.

211
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,920
Speaker 5:  People are like, oh it's really not that exciting, it doesn't really add

212
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,600
Speaker 5:  any new features, it's kind of boring. Well that's kind of the point.

213
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,560
Speaker 5:  It's plumbing. Yeah it's roads, yeah it's infrastructure. It's

214
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,440
Speaker 5:  just making everything work properly, which it hasn't done for a

215
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,800
Speaker 5:  long time.

216
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,200
Speaker 4:  Chris, you saw a bunch of TV stuff, were you seeing any like that ma was

217
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,560
Speaker 4:  matter trickling in there too for you?

218
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think they said that all the lgs, I know support matter they did

219
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 6:  last year too I believe. But this year that's there again and I think some

220
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,160
Speaker 6:  other companies are also on board but so yeah it's definitely kind of like

221
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,120
Speaker 6:  naturally making its way across all the big brands. I'm

222
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,520
Speaker 6:  not sure what that'll look like in TVs necessarily. Like some might have

223
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,200
Speaker 6:  hub apps and stuff like that but they will support it like at the core, which

224
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,880
Speaker 6:  is nice to see.

225
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think Hiene just announced that it's supporting matter, it

226
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,560
Speaker 5:  just announced that it's CS and basically I think ultimately

227
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,920
Speaker 5:  TVs can be matter controllers so you wouldn't even necessarily need

228
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,880
Speaker 5:  a any kind of hub device separately. And that's another part

229
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,640
Speaker 5:  of matter is the idea being that these hub devices will already just be built

230
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,160
Speaker 5:  into what you own or buy. So you're not gonna have to buy extra little

231
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,800
Speaker 5:  Dons and what's its names to to make your smart home work.

232
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,400
Speaker 5:  And then Samsung actually announce that going forward it's gonna build

233
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,960
Speaker 5:  matter and thread directly into its products. So

234
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,040
Speaker 5:  all TVs monitors and their smart fridges will have

235
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,040
Speaker 5:  refrigerators and the fridges. Yes, yes. They'll all,

236
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,720
Speaker 5:  so they all currently have smart things software hubs in and then they will

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,600
Speaker 5:  also get a matter thread chip, ZigBee matter thread,

238
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,080
Speaker 5:  ZigBee chip, nosy wave.

239
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,040
Speaker 4:  How far do these upgrades go back cuz like I know I've got a

240
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,960
Speaker 4:  2017 LG that I'm trying to bully Eli to

241
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,760
Speaker 4:  also replacing his and we're stuck on the pre home

242
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,560
Speaker 4:  kit Premar home stuff right now. They're like no we don't have

243
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,240
Speaker 4:  support for airplay, we don't have support for Chromecast sex to be you

244
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,480
Speaker 4:  and we're probably not gonna get that support now, right? Like, like

245
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,880
Speaker 4:  these older products just aren't gonna get it. You're just gonna be sol.

246
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no, yeah unfortunately there's, there was a lot of talk

247
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,800
Speaker 5:  about backward compatibility and for connected

248
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Speaker 5:  devices, in some cases there will be bridging

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,720
Speaker 5:  opportunities. So like Phillips HU has a

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,960
Speaker 5:  matter bridge, oh sorry its bridge will be updated to support matter and

251
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,280
Speaker 5:  it's proudly said and rightly so, that it's original

252
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,320
Speaker 5:  Phillips hub bulb that you could have bought 10 years ago will support matter

253
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,080
Speaker 5:  through that bridge. So that's great but there's not a lot of,

254
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,800
Speaker 5:  you know, it's gonna be down to individual manufacturers to support that

255
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,120
Speaker 5:  to add matter to their bridges If they have devices that connect to the

256
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,960
Speaker 5:  bridge that can then connect to matter. But in general most of

257
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,320
Speaker 5:  the benefit of matter is gonna be going forward when you buy new devices,

258
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,960
Speaker 5:  you're gonna see an easier setup and easier connectivity and

259
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,840
Speaker 5:  easier interoperability. One good sign for

260
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,440
Speaker 5:  your old TVs though and old fridges and old washing machines

261
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,720
Speaker 5:  if they have any kind of wifi compatibility. So you

262
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,320
Speaker 5:  know, going back about 10 years, most appliances have some

263
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,120
Speaker 5:  compatibility with wifi. There is this, the new Home connectivity

264
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,280
Speaker 5:  alliance is working to do sort of a similar thing

265
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,080
Speaker 5:  to matter but cloud to cloud cause matter's local, which is something we

266
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,920
Speaker 5:  didn't mention right? But that's one of its sort of selling points and this

267
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,280
Speaker 5:  new alliance which is run by Samsung and includes

268
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,480
Speaker 5:  LG higher, which is like GE and it's like 80

269
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,520
Speaker 5:  to 90% of the home appliance industry, which is what like five companies

270
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Are all on board with this home connectivity alliance.

271
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,400
Speaker 5:  And they have said going any device that had wifi capability will

272
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,080
Speaker 5:  work with hca which means that you can control it through any

273
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,040
Speaker 5:  app that you like that is, so like if you have an LG think Q app

274
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,840
Speaker 5:  and a Samsung tv, you can control your Samsung TV through that

275
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,960
Speaker 5:  LG think Q app. So you could use, you could w have all your devices in

276
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,440
Speaker 5:  one app, all your home appliances.

277
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,880
Speaker 4:  So theoretically,

278
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,400
Speaker 5:  Theoretically. That's a good point.

279
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,240
Speaker 4:  Well like cuz I, I mean I definitely have that horrible

280
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,760
Speaker 4:  LG app and it is truly the worst. It's one of the worst apps on my

281
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,600
Speaker 4:  phone. I only use it like when I can't find the remote and I'm too

282
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,360
Speaker 4:  late and too tired at night to like look for it re reasonably

283
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,240
Speaker 4:  and even then I cry when I use it. But they don't care about those

284
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,880
Speaker 4:  apps, right? They, they haven't cared about those apps for years. They've

285
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,200
Speaker 4:  kind of just like they did 'em, they made 'em and they're like, all right,

286
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,880
Speaker 4:  it's here. Enjoy your slop. Do you think we'll start seeing other like third

287
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,840
Speaker 4:  parties making apps to be like, okay here's your app to control all

288
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,080
Speaker 4:  your 10 year old appliances.

289
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,640
Speaker 5:  So yes I think, we'll we may see that but with the HCA it has

290
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,520
Speaker 5:  to be one of their appliance companies. But where you will

291
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,200
Speaker 5:  be able to use it is smart things because that's Samsungs

292
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,280
Speaker 5:  so you'll be able to control all your old LG appliances with the smart things

293
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,240
Speaker 5:  app. So you're all in on Samsung now. You look

294
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,160
Speaker 5:  really thrilled about that

295
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,920
Speaker 4:  Idea whether you want it or not, you're all in on Samsung.

296
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:16,880
Speaker 4:  There

297
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Speaker 5:  Is a chance though that the Home Connectivity Alliance and Matter

298
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,720
Speaker 5:  will get together at some point. I mean they are talking to each other

299
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,240
Speaker 5:  so it is and white good appliances and televisions are

300
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,000
Speaker 5:  in the matter spec, so you know there's gonna be some more

301
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,960
Speaker 5:  political shuffling going on. But I wouldn't be surprised if if eventually

302
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,880
Speaker 5:  they converge. I did hear the, the chairman of the H

303
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,160
Speaker 5:  C A joke that they were just waiting for matter to pay buy them for a billion

304
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,920
Speaker 5:  dollars. Which is kind of funny when C S A is a nonprofit

305
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,720
Speaker 5:  and Samsung runs the hta. So I'm not sure which should

306
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,520
Speaker 5:  buy which, but

307
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,000
Speaker 4:  Well okay, so it was a lot of matter. What was like the coolest

308
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,040
Speaker 4:  matter thing you saw the coolest implementation that had you really excited?

309
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,240
Speaker 5:  Ooh, there were a couple things I think most exciting

310
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,040
Speaker 5:  for me was probably the MOI board. And it's not

311
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,760
Speaker 5:  that it is necessarily a sort of whizbang technologically

312
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,760
Speaker 5:  exciting device, it's more of a sort of shows what matter could bring us,

313
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,000
Speaker 5:  which is because companies don't have to develop for all

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,440
Speaker 5:  different platforms now and they don't have to, startups don't have to spend,

315
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,360
Speaker 5:  you know, 90% of their budget with their engineers having to develop for

316
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,160
Speaker 5:  five different platforms. They can really focus on innovation that we might

317
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,040
Speaker 5:  start to see some more interesting devices in the smart home. And the

318
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,960
Speaker 5:  MOI board is, is a piece of wood with l e d lights behind it

319
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,920
Speaker 5:  that just is touch sensitive so you can, you know, you can

320
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,560
Speaker 5:  touch it to turn your lights on and off, you can draw on it. It's just a,

321
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,080
Speaker 5:  it's a very sort of delightful device. It doesn't feel like technology

322
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,080
Speaker 5:  And that's something if anyone's been following my coverage they'll see,

323
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,000
Speaker 5:  you know, I have a real, I don't like smart home tech that feels like technology.

324
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,800
Speaker 5:  I think it's important that your smart home tech needs to fit into your home

325
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,600
Speaker 5:  and you know, Google's been trying this with all their sort of fabricy mesh

326
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Speaker 5:  things and there have been numerous sort

327
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,040
Speaker 5:  of shifts in the way smart home technology looks. So that doesn't sort of

328
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,760
Speaker 5:  stand out too much in your home. But that's what the MOI board does.

329
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,040
Speaker 5:  It's, it's not really a product. I mean they say you're gonna be able to

330
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,640
Speaker 5:  buy it, it's gonna be on Kickstarter. It's more of a kind of concept though,

331
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,600
Speaker 5:  you know, like this is what we can do. Yeah and that's what I'm excited about

332
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,280
Speaker 5:  with Matter that we'll see more of these things because now that you just

333
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,120
Speaker 5:  have to develop for one protocol, it's gonna be a lot easier for startups

334
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,560
Speaker 5:  and inventors to kind of come up with cool ideas for the smart home.

335
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,720
Speaker 5:  And you know, there's obviously there's some fun stuff like I actually think

336
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,400
Speaker 5:  some of the new hubs we're gonna get are kind of fun. Like Samsung

337
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,160
Speaker 5:  came out with the smart things hub, which was a shocker because they had

338
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,880
Speaker 5:  stopped making smart things hubs years ago, but it's it three

339
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Speaker 5:  in four in one device, it's also a wireless charger. It's also a find

340
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,640
Speaker 5:  my or Samsung's thing finder, whatever their name is for find

341
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,520
Speaker 5:  my, so it has you know, multi-function and that's something we saw

342
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,920
Speaker 5:  a trend of. There were four or five new devices that were announced as

343
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,400
Speaker 5:  matter controllers.

344
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,280
Speaker 4:  It's because I can kind of haven't broken out of that mindset that hubs need

345
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,040
Speaker 4:  to happen. But now they're like, oh but hubs can't just be hubs.

346
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,040
Speaker 5:  Yes. So that, that's the thing. Hubs no longer are just going to be

347
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,760
Speaker 5:  hubs on their own. They're gonna be in your tv, they're gonna be in your

348
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,160
Speaker 5:  wifi router, they're gonna be in your wireless charger, they're gonna be

349
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,280
Speaker 5:  in your temperature sensor. Will

350
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,240
Speaker 4:  They be in your car?

351
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,320
Speaker 5:  I dunno. Andy what do you think?

352
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,640
Speaker 7:  They've been trying to stick smartphone operability in cars for

353
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,400
Speaker 7:  years now with like I would, I would argue less success

354
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,040
Speaker 7:  than they've had in the home. And it's all basically about right, like

355
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,000
Speaker 7:  controlling your car from your home but not vice versa. I don't, I

356
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,280
Speaker 7:  think, and I think maybe they're starting to pick up a little bit on doing

357
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,200
Speaker 7:  home stuff from your car, but there is a sense that like, oh you're in your

358
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,080
Speaker 7:  home, you, you've got a, you know, Tesla sitting out

359
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,680
Speaker 7:  in the driveway, maybe you should get the battery started on that car.

360
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,520
Speaker 7:  It'd be nice to be able to do it from your bedroom as opposed to, you know,

361
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,920
Speaker 7:  while you're sitting freezing your buns off in the car itself. But you're

362
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,720
Speaker 7:  dealing with all these companies that have all, you know, that everyone wants

363
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,600
Speaker 7:  to, you know, lock everyone in their various, you know, walled gardens

364
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,720
Speaker 7:  and I think that they haven't quite figured out how to move forward from

365
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:20,840
Speaker 7:  that.

366
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,800
Speaker 5:  Well that's what they need then matters all about. Yeah, breaking down the

367
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,680
Speaker 5:  walled gardens. So, and the csa, which is the Connectivity

368
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,840
Speaker 5:  Standards Alliance, who promotes and runs matter has said that they are

369
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,760
Speaker 5:  very much looking at bringing matter to other parts of the

370
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,600
Speaker 5:  connected world including cars. They need to get the home sorted out first

371
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,000
Speaker 5:  but hopefully they'll move in, you know, and that's the natural next step

372
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,920
Speaker 5:  would be automotive because there's so much connection between the home

373
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,640
Speaker 5:  and the car. And in particular because one of the things that matter

374
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,080
Speaker 5:  hopefully will really help Kickstart is home energy

375
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,360
Speaker 5:  management should make it a lot easier for

376
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,440
Speaker 5:  apps and infrastructure for energy to sort of

377
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,360
Speaker 5:  talk to each other and gain data to be able to understand

378
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,360
Speaker 5:  energy usage. And obviously cars and EVs are kind of key to that

379
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,120
Speaker 5:  when it comes to home energy management. So I could definitely see some

380
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,040
Speaker 5:  integration that's kind of gonna come along in that space to make it

381
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,480
Speaker 5:  easier from an energy standpoint. And then that could also make it easier

382
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Speaker 5:  from a user sort of interface standpoint. I mean I actually did

383
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
Speaker 5:  see, I did a demo with Apple CarPlay in the Amazon

384
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,320
Speaker 5:  booth where I could talk to both Alexa and Siri at the

385
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,600
Speaker 5:  same time in one device.

386
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,800
Speaker 7:  Oh that must have been a fascinating conversation.

387
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,480
Speaker 5:  It was, it was very cute because it was the way Amazon was going, look, you

388
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,000
Speaker 5:  would ask Siri for these things and then you these things you would ask

389
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,720
Speaker 5:  Amazon for. I'm like, but I could ask Siri for all those things too, you

390
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,680
Speaker 5:  know, I don't really need, I don't really need Alexa but, but

391
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,600
Speaker 5:  their point was if I like to use Siri and all

392
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,160
Speaker 5:  and my husband likes to use the Amazon assistant, you know

393
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,440
Speaker 5:  you can do it all in one device but you could go back and I said, but can

394
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,160
Speaker 5:  I, can I talk to 'em both at the same time? Cuz you know, that sounds like

395
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,120
Speaker 5:  fun. And they're like, yeah. Oh wow. So that was, that was kind of

396
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,520
Speaker 5:  interesting.

397
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,360
Speaker 4:  Chris, how angry do you think Sonos is that

398
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,880
Speaker 4:  these car companies and stuff are getting to like good question, proper voice

399
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,160
Speaker 4:  integration when Sonos is like struggled with it for five years?

400
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,760
Speaker 6:  I think they're mostly, mostly happy with being in the home. They've had

401
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,800
Speaker 6:  some card partnerships, I think they did one last year pretty recently. So

402
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,760
Speaker 6:  I think it's more of like a hey we're here and just have like some, some

403
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,320
Speaker 6:  kind of Sonos branding in the car. But I think on the home on the whole they're

404
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,080
Speaker 6:  very happy to just, you know, focus on your home home theater and

405
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,400
Speaker 6:  maybe headphones down the line and who knows what else. But I think cars

406
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,320
Speaker 6:  are like a secondary thing for them

407
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,760
Speaker 4:  That's way back in the back. They're like it's in the rear view mirror for

408
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,880
Speaker 4:  them. I'm so sorry NEI somewhere groaning

409
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,680
Speaker 4:  like Sonos isn't part of matter, right? Like they, they because it

410
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,520
Speaker 4:  doesn't have the, the audio integration yet.

411
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,040
Speaker 5:  So they are member of the CSA if I

412
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,280
Speaker 5:  remember correctly. But from the conversations that we had

413
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,080
Speaker 5:  in Amsterdam, which is where they had a matter kickoff event last year,

414
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,680
Speaker 5:  they're sort of just there for the view at the moment.

415
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,120
Speaker 5:  You know, just kinda looking around seeing what's going on. Yeah.

416
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And that's true of a lot of the sort of speaker manufacturers

417
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,440
Speaker 5:  outside of the smart speaker, voice assistant

418
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,280
Speaker 5:  manufacturers. Because for them, especially for Sonos who

419
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,160
Speaker 5:  already has their sort of home audio sys

420
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,360
Speaker 5:  multi-room audio pretty nailed down there isn't really a much benefit that

421
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,200
Speaker 5:  they can see at the moment. Right now speakers are not part of

422
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,120
Speaker 5:  any matter spec. So I know one of the questions people kept asking me was,

423
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,080
Speaker 5:  oh now can I add my Google Nest hub to my Apple home kit? And you know that

424
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,000
Speaker 5:  that that stuff isn't gonna work yet. But I think in the

425
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,680
Speaker 5:  future they are trying to move that way. I think there's resistance though

426
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,400
Speaker 5:  from, because the way the way matter works is they create tiger

427
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,040
Speaker 5:  teams. Wow. Where they get all the people from

428
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,920
Speaker 5:  each group together who are, you know, so like Sonos

429
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,720
Speaker 5:  and Bows and name me some speaker companies, Chris

430
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,280
Speaker 4:  JL J

431
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,840
Speaker 5:  Sure. We'll get together in a room and talk about how they want matter

432
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,560
Speaker 5:  to work with their speakers and then they go to the

433
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,920
Speaker 5:  CSA and they don't, right. And that's saying they don't do that. So that

434
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,640
Speaker 5:  hasn't happened yet from what I've heard. So it, it would need some consumer

435
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,040
Speaker 5:  pressure I think to move it along.

436
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,000
Speaker 4:  All right, well we're gonna take a break and when we're back, Chris is gonna

437
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,520
Speaker 4:  tell us all about the TVs that truly sucked at C

438
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,800
Speaker 4:  ces. I'm so sorry. I will not stop,

439
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,840
Speaker 4:  stay tuned. We'll be back.

440
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,750
Speaker 4:  And we're back Chris. I know this was like, this was such a big c s show.

441
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,550
Speaker 4:  Jen was having an awesome time seeing everything and TVs were kind

442
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,390
Speaker 4:  of like a little quiet this year. There weren't, were, there wasn't as much

443
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,750
Speaker 4:  big stuff happening in that space.

444
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,310
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it was pretty low key. I think we finally got over that hump of, of

445
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,990
Speaker 6:  like two years ago where like some of like all these HDM I 2.1 features like

446
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,830
Speaker 6:  4K and one 20 VR R, those are finally fairly widespread across

447
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,750
Speaker 6:  all TVs right now. So if you spend like 700 or $800

448
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,270
Speaker 6:  on a tv, you're gonna have those features Now that really wasn't the case

449
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,630
Speaker 6:  necessarily two years ago or even last year in some cases. So I think that's

450
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,710
Speaker 6:  finally settled and this year we saw like a focus on brightness,

451
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,950
Speaker 6:  especially with O lid. Those are getting brighter and trying to close the

452
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,640
Speaker 6:  gap with many LEDs. So both Samsung and LG said

453
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,280
Speaker 6:  they have the brightest oles yet they've ever made. So they're trying to

454
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,960
Speaker 6:  close that gap with mini LEDs from TCL and HS and, and just get the best

455
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,560
Speaker 6:  of both worlds. But on the whole it was like software they're saying oh we

456
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,480
Speaker 6:  can, you know, pick out the subject in scenes now and give them more depth

457
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,400
Speaker 6:  and make them feel more lifelike. There were quite a few Trix

458
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,760
Speaker 6:  using ai. What

459
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,280
Speaker 4:  Does that mean?

460
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,080
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. Just making

461
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,600
Speaker 6:  things feel more life flight.

462
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,480
Speaker 4:  That's one of those things I always hear. I don't know, I, I come

463
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,240
Speaker 4:  from the, I want it to be exactly what the director

464
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,040
Speaker 4:  intended, even though I don't have a 30,000 reference monitor, right.

465
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,840
Speaker 6:  And I always say, well you can turn all these AI features off if you want,

466
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,680
Speaker 4:  But why put 'em in there and to begin with Jen Andy, do you guys use the

467
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,560
Speaker 4:  AI features on your tv? Oh

468
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,080
Speaker 7:  Hell no.

469
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,080
Speaker 5:  I dunno if mine has, I

470
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,600
Speaker 7:  Don't know if, yeah, I don't know if mine does. Honestly either. I I assumed

471
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,320
Speaker 7:  you were talking about motion smoothing, right? That's what we're talking

472
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,520
Speaker 7:  about. No, I'm kidding.

473
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,200
Speaker 4:  No, but motion smooth. Like I just, I like Chris, why do

474
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,080
Speaker 4:  they keep putting all of these crappy things that we don't actually want

475
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,960
Speaker 4:  on our TVs onto our TVs? And then you always get at least one

476
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,240
Speaker 4:  person who's like, well actually I like the motion smoothing. It makes the

477
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,560
Speaker 4:  ball look fast and like that person's dumb.

478
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,520
Speaker 6:  There are sickos out there who love motion smoothing, but I think,

479
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,720
Speaker 6:  but I think all TVs are really pretty good now. So like manufacturers are

480
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,360
Speaker 6:  trying to come up with ways to like differentiate and like get you to upgrade

481
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,320
Speaker 6:  after five or six years or however long people keep TVs

482
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,720
Speaker 6:  nowadays. So it's all software, software, software and like very gradual

483
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,560
Speaker 6:  picture refinements too. So that was the case this year. But it was nice,

484
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,120
Speaker 6:  we saw a lot of very nice TVs and quite a few

485
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,480
Speaker 6:  gimmicky TVs as well.

486
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,800
Speaker 4:  We should talk about the gimmicky TV because this was one of my

487
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,960
Speaker 4:  favorite things to come outta ces and I think the worst part was,

488
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,680
Speaker 4:  I was reading your story earlier and I was like, wait, I, I almost wanna

489
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,360
Speaker 4:  buy this tv. Can you, well what was it called? It was called like it, it

490
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,040
Speaker 4:  used to vacuum but I cannot remember the name of the TV now.

491
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a startup called Displace. I think this was their first time at

492
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,320
Speaker 6:  cs. I haven't seen them before. Okay. But I saw like earlier in the show

493
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,520
Speaker 6:  there were some tweets about it and I was like oh this is gonna be the thing

494
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,200
Speaker 6:  that everybody kind of like, oh it gets excited about,

495
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,160
Speaker 6:  it's some kind of silly gimmick. So it costs $3,000. It's a

496
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,040
Speaker 6:  55 inch 4K olet TV that is totally wireless.

497
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,200
Speaker 6:  And so there are four batteries that you can hot swap around and

498
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Speaker 6:  charge and keep it running at all times. There's a base station where you

499
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,640
Speaker 6:  plug in all your stuff, same sort of thing as the LG wireless thing that

500
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,200
Speaker 6:  we talked about a few last week and, but this one is totally wireless. Even

501
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,080
Speaker 6:  the power is handled by batteries and it lasts. So if you watch TV

502
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,920
Speaker 6:  for six hours a day, then it'll last a month and you can watch for seven

503
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,480
Speaker 6:  point, 7.5 days straight through. And I've seen like already on Twitter,

504
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,160
Speaker 6:  people are like, those batteries are nowhere near big enough to like have

505
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,120
Speaker 6:  that kind of a charge.

506
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,360
Speaker 4:  But there's a key thing about the batteries. Yeah cuz it sucks.

507
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,480
Speaker 4:  It sucks itself on yeah, to the wall, right?

508
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So there's a vacuum suction system. So you hold the TV against the

509
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,400
Speaker 6:  wall and after a few seconds it like wears up, you can hear it and then it

510
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,920
Speaker 6:  just kinda like sticks to the wall and you just kind of back away and it's

511
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,240
Speaker 6:  on there and you can like pull at it and tug pretty hard and it stays on

512
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,160
Speaker 6:  there. But that is also battery powered. So in the event that all the batteries

513
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,600
Speaker 6:  run out, your $3,000 TV will just fall to the floor.

514
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,440
Speaker 4:  That's,

515
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:11,080
Speaker 6:  That's where we're at with the CES gimmicks.

516
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,240
Speaker 5:  I'm all for the wireless stuff though ultimately, you know, I don't think,

517
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,440
Speaker 5:  we'll one day we'll have no wires on our own whatsoever. Right. Anyway. Yeah.

518
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,880
Speaker 5:  You know our lighting doesn't need wires, you know, things just don't need

519
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,280
Speaker 5:  wires. We have wireless power. I mean that's something we saw the wireless

520
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,160
Speaker 5:  power, which I know has been around, they've been promising for years but

521
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,200
Speaker 5:  it seems like it's getting closer.

522
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,640
Speaker 4:  The they'll get there one day,

523
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,360
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. Patience. Patience. Y'all just don't force the hand. You know,

524
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,480
Speaker 6:  you've got both LG and this company doing it this year and it's like, you

525
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,760
Speaker 6:  know, WiFi's not there yet.

526
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,960
Speaker 4:  Do you think like next year displace in partnership with the guys

527
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,800
Speaker 4:  who who've been doing the wireless power for years trying to

528
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,680
Speaker 4:  keep that TV up on the wall but just did they

529
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,360
Speaker 4:  explain what they expected to happen if the batteries ran out? Like

530
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,880
Speaker 4:  were they, were they like, oh no, people will always remove their TV with

531
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,360
Speaker 4:  not in use and put it in the closet.

532
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,760
Speaker 6:  I mean they're hot swappable so I guess the idea is you'll always be like

533
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,440
Speaker 6:  popping one or two in at a time and switching them out and who wants to maintain

534
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,840
Speaker 6:  that schedule? You know, that's

535
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,440
Speaker 4:  So much work.

536
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,000
Speaker 6:  It's like having to remember that and there's like a base station that charges

537
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,600
Speaker 6:  all the batteries but it's just like more and more anxiety that like isn't

538
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,760
Speaker 6:  even there right now. Who wants like, you know like battery charge status

539
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,400
Speaker 6:  for your tv,

540
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,640
Speaker 5:  It's like range anxiety for your ev

541
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,200
Speaker 6:  Right? That's the same exact thing. But for TVs now, suction anxiety.

542
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,480
Speaker 4:  Yes.

543
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,480
Speaker 5:  We have to pause a minute for that one.

544
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,200
Speaker 7:  I'm so worried that my TV isn't sucking well enough.

545
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,000
Speaker 4:  How do you go to bed at night? Like, oh no I can't. Like we just,

546
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,760
Speaker 4:  I would wake up every, every 30 minutes being like, is my TV still on my

547
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,520
Speaker 4:  wall? I could just take

548
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,920
Speaker 6:  It off the wall. Honey, did you take it down? I didn't take it down.

549
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,320
Speaker 7:  Maybe we just need to position like a bunch of pillows under the TVs

550
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,720
Speaker 7:  so that it can fall gracefully some sort of

551
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,160
Speaker 4:  Net. I was just thinking of like the person who has this and then also has

552
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,000
Speaker 4:  all the IKEA blinds and then they just have another room for all of the battery

553
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,800
Speaker 4:  packs. They have to keep constantly charged. So they're, they're super smart

554
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,800
Speaker 4:  of the future home works.

555
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so it's kind of silly. I think they know it's a concept thing. They're

556
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,800
Speaker 6:  only gonna sell a hundred of them so they're not saying oh this is gonna

557
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,360
Speaker 6:  be like a mainstream tv but, but it got a lot of buzz on the show floor and

558
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,600
Speaker 6:  was very c e s

559
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,600
Speaker 4:  That TV without the suction. That's like a thousand dollars tv

560
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,000
Speaker 4:  right?

561
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,280
Speaker 6:  Right. Yeah it's just your standard like LG display ole panel. Probably not

562
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,600
Speaker 6:  even 55 inch, $700 or so. So

563
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,880
Speaker 4:  Can you vacuum with it?

564
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,080
Speaker 6:  It doesn't have the vacuums.

565
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,240
Speaker 4:  Okay. Well it's even it's sucking like I, I don't, I just don't know if you

566
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,920
Speaker 4:  can suck other things. So we saw, you saw that TV

567
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,000
Speaker 4:  moving on, we saw that TV but you also saw

568
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,320
Speaker 4:  like a lot of, I feel like we saw a lot of like light stuff happening behind

569
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,760
Speaker 4:  the TVs. I know we talked about Gove earlier but there was a couple of other

570
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,680
Speaker 4:  people doing that that Phillips hu what if we have lights behind the

571
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,080
Speaker 4:  TVs?

572
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,720
Speaker 5:  That's a big theme this year. I think there were like six

573
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,360
Speaker 5:  maybe announcements around tv, audio

574
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,480
Speaker 5:  gaming syncing. So yeah the Gove sink box.

575
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,760
Speaker 5:  Nano Leaf had one which used a camera and then there was

576
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,600
Speaker 5:  one from Twinkly which is an Italian company and

577
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,400
Speaker 5:  that was, that's an app based one which is similar to the

578
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,440
Speaker 5:  Phillips Hue app based one but the Twinkles costs

579
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,400
Speaker 5:  $0 whereas Phillips Hughes costs $130

580
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,600
Speaker 5:  but you know they only work with their own light systems. So there's

581
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,160
Speaker 5:  Phillips Hu has a lot more options when it comes to immersive

582
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,040
Speaker 5:  lighting. And then I think there were a couple others and there are some

583
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,800
Speaker 5:  that already exist. So now it seems like everyone thinks that everyone

584
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,640
Speaker 5:  really wants flashing lights when they're watching tv. Chris, I dunno,

585
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,160
Speaker 5:  what do you think?

586
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah, this whole market is so fascinating to me.

587
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean I've done it once and I liked, like I tested one box and it

588
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,080
Speaker 5:  was kind of fun for some movies but I probably only turned it

589
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,680
Speaker 5:  on once or twice after you know, doing the testing cuz you know, you don't

590
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,560
Speaker 5:  wanna watch the nightly news and see like black and red sort of

591
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,040
Speaker 5:  flashing in the background as it, it it's, it's really quite

592
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,000
Speaker 5:  specific for certain entertainment. And then obviously gamers. I think gamers

593
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,680
Speaker 5:  are really the the market. No, yeah,

594
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,040
Speaker 6:  Yeah for sure. I mean I don't really know anybody who like has these lights

595
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:20,760
Speaker 6:  in their

596
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,280
Speaker 4:  Home. Oh I definitely do.

597
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,400
Speaker 6:  Certain people definitely do. Like there are, yeah like I know a to of people

598
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,120
Speaker 6:  who don't. So

599
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,400
Speaker 4:  One out of four super nerds on this call has it,

600
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,520
Speaker 4:  that is a small percentage of the wider population.

601
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,040
Speaker 5:  The problem I have though is you can't sync it. Like I have a framed TV

602
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,640
Speaker 5:  so it doesn't really go with the whole lifestyle TV

603
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,480
Speaker 5:  trend. There's definitely two diverging things here. So we got

604
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,400
Speaker 5:  the frame because I love the idea of it not looking like a TV but

605
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,280
Speaker 5:  then I can't fit my lights l e d light strips behind it cuz it's on the

606
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,400
Speaker 5:  wall and it's like this thin. Yeah. So yeah, I mean you can do it with other

607
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,320
Speaker 5:  lights but it seems more suited to gaming monitors honestly than

608
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Speaker 5:  to, than to TVs. I know Thomas Ricker tested it out,

609
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,200
Speaker 5:  tested out the gov one and he really liked that. The older gov one. Now this

610
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,040
Speaker 5:  is a new version I think, but it's definitely a trend syncing with

611
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,760
Speaker 5:  your content and audio. It's not just so it's

612
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,240
Speaker 5:  visual and audio and the, the key difference here between say like

613
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,640
Speaker 5:  what you can do with Phillips Hue music sync in the

614
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,520
Speaker 5:  app and doing this on the TV for all of these products is that it

615
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,960
Speaker 5:  uses software to go across multiple lights.

616
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,760
Speaker 5:  So like you can buy a light strip with a microphone and just sync that light

617
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,640
Speaker 5:  strip to the beat if you want one little light strip. But this way

618
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,440
Speaker 5:  you can go across the entire ecosystem so you could have your

619
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,360
Speaker 5:  whole house flashing in the beat with the beat, which I might have to do

620
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,200
Speaker 5:  for Halloween next year. That would be fun. It's,

621
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,480
Speaker 4:  It's the worst thing in the world. I've done it and then it's just like

622
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,200
Speaker 4:  I just realized I'm too old. I was like if, if I was like

623
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,080
Speaker 4:  set, if I was like 18, 19 in a dorm room, it

624
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,640
Speaker 4:  is the coolest thing in the world. I feel like so awesome.

625
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,600
Speaker 4:  But I am about to hit 40. I am so like no

626
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,760
Speaker 4:  I want my house to look like a house, not the inside

627
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,640
Speaker 4:  of my computer.

628
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,440
Speaker 5:  Right. Not a disco party. Yeah.

629
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,280
Speaker 4:  But this, I was gonna, going back to like this was how Phillips

630
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,480
Speaker 4:  Hughes started, right? Like it was originally they had, they had these lights

631
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,360
Speaker 4:  on the back of Phillips TVs like 10, 15 years ago and they

632
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,200
Speaker 4:  realized there was no market for it and nobody bought them and they got

633
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,120
Speaker 4:  like, or a few people, you know, a quarter of the nerdiest of the

634
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,040
Speaker 4:  nerds bought it and and nobody else and then it went away. And

635
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,400
Speaker 4:  so I'm like is it coming back just because it's easier just because more

636
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,920
Speaker 4:  companies have figured out the secret sauce that that Phillips had all those

637
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,200
Speaker 4:  years ago. Like why is it back again?

638
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,080
Speaker 6:  I think the less you need hubs and like all these accessories like that makes

639
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,880
Speaker 6:  it more enticing. Like if you don't have to like hook up, hook up like 10

640
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,560
Speaker 6:  things to make it work up and sync up. It's like the easier it gets, the

641
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,120
Speaker 6:  more tempting it is for everybody. I think

642
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,080
Speaker 4:  That's fair. That's fair. You can actually, you don't have to put your camera

643
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,640
Speaker 4:  like pacing at your TV all the time if you give 'em just natively out of

644
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,200
Speaker 4:  the back of the tv. Well what kind of, so you saw, I know some of the other

645
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,800
Speaker 4:  things you were kind of excited about the CES was we, we saw

646
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,720
Speaker 4:  Roku announced their own TV sets, which I was less enthusiastic but you

647
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,560
Speaker 4:  seemed pretty enthusiastic about so I'm willing to fight with you on the

648
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,880
Speaker 4:  Verge cast now if you want Chris.

649
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,600
Speaker 5:  I didn't even bother going and looking at their smart home stuff. They had

650
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,520
Speaker 5:  all their smart home stuff out there. I was like cat. Aw. So I'll fight

651
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,040
Speaker 5:  with you Alex.

652
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,880
Speaker 4:  Thank you. We're here to gang up on Chris. Andy you have to, you have to

653
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,680
Speaker 4:  side with Chris. Okay that's fine with me.

654
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,440
Speaker 6:  So I think that's a not so much a case about like the actual TVs themselves,

655
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,080
Speaker 6:  they're gonna be fine decent TVs but like more so Roku making

656
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,960
Speaker 6:  its own TVs quote unquote. Like we don't know who's making these, we

657
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,680
Speaker 6:  thought it might be T still or license and apparently it's not. So it could

658
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,840
Speaker 6:  be like a Foxcon situation or who knows. But the fact that they're like coming

659
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,720
Speaker 6:  in now, like apparently it wasn't enough to sell, they said like one out

660
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,240
Speaker 6:  of every three TV sold in the US as is runs Roku software

661
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,320
Speaker 6:  and so now they wanna like come in with their own TVs on top of all of that

662
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,800
Speaker 6:  and they're gonna be priced like super aggressively and yeah it's gonna be

663
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,360
Speaker 6:  pretty fascinating to see like just like what happens throughout the industry

664
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,320
Speaker 6:  cuz like what are TCL and he's gonna do now? Like are they gonna still make

665
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,080
Speaker 6:  Roku TVs like very similar price points or like will they go all in

666
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,280
Speaker 6:  Google TV now because Google making its own TV seems

667
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,120
Speaker 6:  pretty unlikely but I don't wanna speak too soon. Who knows?

668
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,000
Speaker 4:  Like Apple making their own car, right? Because like Roku, the reason that

669
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,120
Speaker 4:  we know who TCL and Heiss are, the reason they've come as close as they have

670
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,800
Speaker 4:  been to being like name brands that we all recognize in our homes is because

671
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,520
Speaker 4:  of Roku, right? Like these were two smaller Chinese TV manufacturers that

672
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,320
Speaker 4:  nobody had heard of and they were like, okay, our first inroads are gonna

673
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,000
Speaker 4:  be on Roku. Is there like, were you seeing like friction there

674
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,520
Speaker 4:  between these companies now that Roku's like we're doing it on our own.

675
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,160
Speaker 4:  That's

676
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,120
Speaker 6:  A bit too early to say I think. But like all the TVs that were announced

677
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,040
Speaker 6:  by tcl, this cs, those are only Google TVs and also Hyen

678
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,800
Speaker 6:  the same thing. So all they showed off were Google TVs now they come in waves,

679
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,160
Speaker 6:  like sometimes T-Cell will do like a phase of like Google TVs and then

680
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,880
Speaker 6:  come spring they'll do Roku. So it's like too early to say like what the

681
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,720
Speaker 6:  ripple effect's gonna be. They know obviously that Roku's coming into like

682
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,560
Speaker 6:  their, their space and yeah we'll see like how good the TVs are and very

683
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,200
Speaker 6:  curious about, cause like T-Cell and license make very phenomenal

684
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,120
Speaker 6:  TVs for like $800, a thousand dollars. So I'm not sure that Roku

685
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,640
Speaker 6:  can really like top them just coming right out of the gate. But we'll see

686
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,680
Speaker 6:  what they can manage. And I think like, I'm not sure how it's gonna matter.

687
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,440
Speaker 6:  Jesus, I'm not sure how much it's gonna matter if

688
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,160
Speaker 6:  they don't actually like beat TCL license, like based on, you know,

689
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,720
Speaker 6:  just like sheer picture quality. Cause they're gonna be in like every Walmart

690
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,640
Speaker 6:  and Target and be priced super aggressively. So I think they'll make a dent.

691
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,760
Speaker 4:  That was like a big part of their selling point with those original TVs,

692
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Speaker 4:  right? Like they were like, right, okay, you don't know who TCL is, you don't

693
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,040
Speaker 4:  know who heis is, but we, you know, Roku and we worked with them to make

694
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,640
Speaker 4:  sure the picture quality is good. So it's kinda like they're doing that again,

695
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,760
Speaker 4:  but they're like, but we don't wanna even partner with these brands. We just

696
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,680
Speaker 4:  want our name on it. Don't care about who it is.

697
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Speaker 6:  Right, yeah. So they're gonna be out this spring, they're come in like a

698
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,760
Speaker 6:  ton of sizes. They start very cheap. I think even like the 75 inch model

699
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,560
Speaker 6:  is like well under a thousand dollars, so Oh wow. Yeah, so

700
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,920
Speaker 6:  they're, they're coming full of force.

701
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,200
Speaker 4:  Are you gonna be just surrounded by TVs when I get to the office

702
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,760
Speaker 4:  softly weeping under your Roku pile?

703
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,160
Speaker 6:  That is very likely come April. It's always that time of year where they

704
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,080
Speaker 6:  start, they start coming in, so, so we shall see how

705
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,000
Speaker 6:  they end up. But yeah, plus like Roku now they can like have the full stack.

706
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,160
Speaker 6:  They can like do all this advertising stuff. They already do a ton of advertising

707
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,480
Speaker 6:  that's like huge part of their business and now they have the full stack

708
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,320
Speaker 6:  of hardware and software and so that just gives them even more power

709
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,840
Speaker 6:  and control.

710
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,480
Speaker 4:  Was there anything besides Roku that really just got you excited

711
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,320
Speaker 4:  as far as TVs go, despite it being kind of a all right

712
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,760
Speaker 4:  year for TVs?

713
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,160
Speaker 6:  Probably the Samsung cutie oli. I think it's kind of super fascinating how

714
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,680
Speaker 6:  like within two years Samsung display has kind of come into the oli market

715
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,760
Speaker 6:  and like beaten LG display at it. The cutie oles.

716
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,160
Speaker 4:  Really?

717
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so like it's more vivid color and the color brightness is

718
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,480
Speaker 6:  better. So like it gets brighter and it looks better than LGS do. Samsung

719
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,280
Speaker 6:  TV still don't do Adobe vision, which is like their one like major

720
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,520
Speaker 6:  come on already, let's, let's just do this. I mean you have, they've got

721
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,360
Speaker 6:  atmos but no vision. So it's like they're just saving that for one

722
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,520
Speaker 6:  year where there's nothing else to announce. And they're like, okay, now

723
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,280
Speaker 6:  we have double vision as well. They like, so they said the, the cutie can

724
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,320
Speaker 6:  reach up to 2000 knits of brightness, which is like right up there with the

725
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,840
Speaker 6:  very brightest mini LEDs. And like granted that's just like one small part

726
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,360
Speaker 6:  of the screen that's gonna hit 2000 knits, but that's like way better than

727
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,280
Speaker 6:  than where things were even like two or three years ago. So then like a very

728
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,800
Speaker 6:  short time period. Yeah, these oles have gotten very, very good. So

729
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,760
Speaker 6:  that's the TV I'm probably most excited about.

730
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,200
Speaker 4:  So for years now, it's always been like, if somebody says I wanna buy a TV

731
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,680
Speaker 4:  and I don't want it to be like a TCL or a high sense, I wanna spend some

732
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,400
Speaker 4:  money, you just say go get an LG oled. Are you, are you now saying

733
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,280
Speaker 4:  maybe go look at those Samsungs?

734
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah, the Samsung was great last year too. That was their first model last

735
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,080
Speaker 6:  year. It was the S 95 B and then Sony had their like top, top, top one that

736
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,960
Speaker 6:  used the same panel as Samsung. But Sony has better processing and like better

737
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,520
Speaker 6:  sound and speakers and stuff like that. So if you want like the absolute

738
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,920
Speaker 6:  best tv, Sony's usually the way to go. We didn't see them at CS this year,

739
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,520
Speaker 6:  they didn't do TVs. They had a car, which we'll cover shortly, but

740
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,320
Speaker 6:  they kind of, they kind of punted their TVs to later on.

741
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,120
Speaker 6:  So we'll see what's coming from them pretty soon.

742
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,560
Speaker 4:  All right, well speaking of, we are gonna zoom to another break

743
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,640
Speaker 4:  and then when we're back, we're gonna talk with Alex.

744
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,280
Speaker 4:  When is enough we're gonna talk with the handy about cars.

745
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,400
Speaker 7:  Just don't say start your engines,

746
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,000
Speaker 4:  Start your, no name it. No, you can't do it now. You

747
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,480
Speaker 4:  ruin it

748
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,080
Speaker 5:  All time for a pit stop. Yes.

749
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,360
Speaker 4:  We're gonna take a pit stop and when we're back we're gonna talk about cars.

750
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,320
Speaker 4:  See you soon.

751
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,320
Speaker 4:  And we're back. Andy.

752
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,040
Speaker 7:  Hello.

753
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,720
Speaker 4:  How's the drive? How are the cars?

754
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,400
Speaker 7:  I thought this year was surprisingly great for cars,

755
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,880
Speaker 4:  Even though we had the big goofy concepts.

756
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,680
Speaker 7:  Even that even cuz who doesn't love a big goofy concept? I mean everyone

757
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,040
Speaker 7:  loves true, you know, a a bunch of like, you know, a

758
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,720
Speaker 7:  pastiche of like ridiculous ideas meshed together

759
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,200
Speaker 7:  in the shape of a car. That's, that's, that's what's fun about CES is just

760
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,160
Speaker 7:  looking at goofy concepts and, and imagining, you know, what is

761
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,880
Speaker 7:  possibly something that could end up in the, in, in an actual future production

762
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,800
Speaker 7:  vehicle. And I think this year was, was was a good year in terms of that.

763
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,760
Speaker 7:  And we also got some, some actual cars and real life cars that we'll see

764
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:41,800
Speaker 7:  in real life in the future alongside the, the color changing cars

765
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,760
Speaker 7:  and the, the weirder stuff. So for, for that reason, I thought it

766
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,560
Speaker 7:  was a good balance between like actual legitimate, like this is

767
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,520
Speaker 7:  gonna be something that you could potentially end up buying in the future.

768
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,880
Speaker 7:  And also just like here's a little bit of a, you know, a whimsical

769
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,400
Speaker 7:  bit of imagination for, for, for you to take with you.

770
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,400
Speaker 7:  How about a color changing car? That, that would be great, right?

771
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,440
Speaker 5:  Are you saying we're not gonna get a color changing car? Cuz that's what

772
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,080
Speaker 5:  I want. I love that idea.

773
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,360
Speaker 7:  I don't wanna rain on anyone's parade, but it seems very unlikely

774
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,920
Speaker 7:  that you can actually have a production car that's covered in e ink.

775
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,200
Speaker 7:  It just seems, I know you Alex you tell me as soon as there's a hail storm,

776
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,400
Speaker 7:  like what's gonna happen to that car?

777
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah, your car will look so sick and so

778
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,640
Speaker 4:  busted.

779
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,200
Speaker 4:  Like, no, no, no. This is the aesthetic.

780
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,240
Speaker 7:  If that's what people want, if they're willing to take that risk in order

781
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,000
Speaker 7:  to have a car that, that has 32 different color options as

782
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,840
Speaker 7:  the BMW I vision d purports to have, then

783
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,480
Speaker 7:  yeah, why not? Who knows?

784
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,480
Speaker 5:  I loved it felt very back to the future like though, right? Didn't they change

785
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,440
Speaker 5:  car colors in that or in some like sci-fi movies? I love concepts like

786
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,680
Speaker 5:  this that feel like we could actually get something we've seen in the movies.

787
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,800
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it felt very like old school ces. Like I was like, oh yeah,

788
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,560
Speaker 7:  people remembered what this show is truly about and it's about

789
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:03,840
Speaker 7:  presenting a ridiculous concepts that probably

790
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,520
Speaker 7:  don't have much chance of ever being a reality, but

791
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,120
Speaker 7:  are still super fun to look at and think about and talk about

792
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,800
Speaker 7:  and share videos about. And you know, it makes us feel

793
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,680
Speaker 7:  good and warm and fuzzy about the future.

794
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,320
Speaker 4:  Well, we talked a bunch last week about the a,

795
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,600
Speaker 7:  The aph,

796
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,480
Speaker 4:  The A, but what were the cars that, like what were the

797
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,120
Speaker 4:  concepts that you were actually excited about? Was it the

798
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,560
Speaker 4:  Aila?

799
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,000
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I, I I think legitimately the, the appeal is a ver is an interesting

800
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,240
Speaker 7:  concept because, well, first of all you've got Sony who has not previously

801
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,160
Speaker 7:  ever made a car deciding suddenly that they are going to make

802
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,120
Speaker 7:  a car with Honda, which is a company that has a ton of experience

803
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,640
Speaker 7:  making cars and it seems kind of like a natural pairing between the two of

804
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,280
Speaker 7:  them to work together on a, on a production vehicle. So that's

805
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,600
Speaker 7:  exciting. This is a, a new brand, a new name. It's ridiculous sounding. But

806
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,360
Speaker 7:  then again, you know, all car companies tend to be named after like

807
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,320
Speaker 7:  white dudes. So why not just have like a completely name made up name

808
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,320
Speaker 7:  to name a car company after too. Like it's that it's not too

809
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,840
Speaker 7:  outlandish to think that we're just like making names up. I mean that's,

810
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,760
Speaker 7:  that is what branding is all about, is just inventing a, a new word by

811
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,440
Speaker 7:  sticking a vowel at the, the, the front and end of the word feel.

812
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,360
Speaker 7:  Sure, why not? So I think that that's exciting. I think Sony

813
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,320
Speaker 7:  has a lot to offer the car space, especially when it comes to

814
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,120
Speaker 7:  things like computers, electronics, entertainment, sound system,

815
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,720
Speaker 7:  enter, you know, all infotainment, all of the things that

816
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:38,720
Speaker 7:  CS is typically about, you know, sort of like the future of the in-car

817
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,320
Speaker 7:  experience in a lot of ways. And I think Sony has a lot to bring to that

818
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,680
Speaker 7:  conversation, which I think is really interesting. And, and they've, they've

819
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,080
Speaker 7:  said a production schedule for themselves. They say in three years we'll

820
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,640
Speaker 7:  have this car, it's gonna be available, you'll be able to drive it, you'll

821
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,080
Speaker 7:  be able to buy it.

822
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,520
Speaker 4:  But is that real?

823
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,800
Speaker 7:  I mean, like maybe it's, it is like, you know, it's, they're not just

824
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,680
Speaker 7:  like some flyby night company that can like, make up deadlines for themselves

825
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,080
Speaker 7:  too. I mean,

826
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,160
Speaker 4:  They're not displaced.

827
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,960
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah. And Sony's a gigantic, you know, global

828
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,880
Speaker 7:  conglomerate that has shareholders and expectations and like, you know,

829
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,800
Speaker 7:  and they're, and they're not run by a guy named Elon Musk. So they're, you

830
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,320
Speaker 7:  know, they potentially have like a little bit more of, I think a little bit

831
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,200
Speaker 7:  of credibility I think when it comes to saying the stuff. I mean like, Chris,

832
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,760
Speaker 7:  you tell me you, you know, when Sodi Sodi obviously didn't have any TVs this

833
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,000
Speaker 7:  year, but when they come out and say that, that we're gonna do something,

834
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,520
Speaker 7:  they tend to follow up on that for the most part, right? Yeah. And you know,

835
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,280
Speaker 7:  the PS five is now app apparently like readily available to anyone who wants

836
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,120
Speaker 7:  to buy it. So it stands to reason that they'll have a car eventually

837
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,880
Speaker 7:  too. So I think that that's kind of exciting, you know, like a, a brand

838
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,760
Speaker 7:  new brand a a new company that has not previously been in the space. Now

839
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,600
Speaker 7:  there's a lot of, I think, challenges along the way. I think we've, we've

840
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,520
Speaker 7:  seen companies come out that are non-car companies that say that

841
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,920
Speaker 7:  they wanna make cars and it has not worked out so great for them. I mean,

842
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,720
Speaker 7:  Dyson is like the one that sort of springs to mind immediately when they

843
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Speaker 7:  said that they were gonna make an electric car and everyone's like, oh sure,

844
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,520
Speaker 7:  yeah, you, you made a, a really cool vacuum. Why, why wouldn't you be able

845
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,040
Speaker 7:  to make a car? And so just because you make an amazing

846
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,240
Speaker 7:  TV or a a console or something like that does not necessarily

847
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,960
Speaker 7:  translate into the, the business of making a cool car. But again, Honda,

848
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,760
Speaker 7:  you know, Honda does make cars so

849
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,080
Speaker 5:  Well because they're working with a actual car company, it makes it like

850
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,800
Speaker 5:  80% more likely to happen. Right? I agree. Well, yeah, it

851
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,520
Speaker 5:  gives it, it gives it some cache

852
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,520
Speaker 7:  And Honda's not gonna like, you know, stake its name on a project that I

853
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,360
Speaker 7:  think ends up flopping, you know, with like you know necessarily

854
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,160
Speaker 7:  as well. I think that they have a stake in this to make sure that it happens.

855
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,800
Speaker 7:  And Honda is a company that's also working with one of the biggest

856
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,320
Speaker 7:  car companies in the world, GM on electric car technology.

857
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,320
Speaker 7:  So there's like a lot of through lines here that could be really interesting

858
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,240
Speaker 7:  I think, depending on how this exactly shakes out. So I

859
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,000
Speaker 7:  think that that's exciting.

860
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,040
Speaker 4:  Could it also just end up being like that very first iTunes phone,

861
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,240
Speaker 4:  it's like Sony Erickson or something, which just like, and we had iTunes

862
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,280
Speaker 4:  on it. Bam. Oh

863
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,640
Speaker 7:  Yes, the rocker. I don't know, I I, I think like if you went up to somebody

864
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,080
Speaker 7:  and it was like a PS five, but you can drive it, like that's

865
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,320
Speaker 7:  like, people would be very excited for something like that.

866
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,760
Speaker 7:  So I think that there, you know, there's maybe like a little bit

867
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,240
Speaker 7:  more like kind of like as a foundation potentially.

868
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,320
Speaker 7:  But then again the car itself was a little silly looking. It

869
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,040
Speaker 7:  was not like the most, like design-wise, it was not the most like arresting

870
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,320
Speaker 7:  vehicle that I had ever seen. It looked like, yeah, a mashup of like a portion

871
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,720
Speaker 7:  nine 11 and a lucid air. So it was not, they were not breaking new ground

872
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,160
Speaker 7:  design-wise, but at the same time, maybe that's good. Maybe

873
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,440
Speaker 7:  like, you know, they're sitting their sights, you know, somewhere more realistic.

874
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,760
Speaker 7:  They're not trying to reinvent the wheel necessarily. And

875
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:55,080
Speaker 7:  I think it's, it's there, there's a strong possibility that, and,

876
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,760
Speaker 7:  and if I turned out to be wrong, then you can bring this podcast

877
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,400
Speaker 7:  back and shove it in my face and show me how stupid I sound.

878
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,760
Speaker 4:  We're just gonna play clips of it. If you're wrong

879
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,120
Speaker 7:  To humiliate me, I would welcome that.

880
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:11,160
Speaker 4:  Well, what other concepts did you see that you were like kind of

881
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,400
Speaker 4:  excited about? Or it doesn't have to be concepts, it can also be real cars

882
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,120
Speaker 4:  that we know will actually exist next

883
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,600
Speaker 7:  Year. Yeah, so like Volkswagen came with a real car. They have a, the ID

884
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,360
Speaker 7:  seven which is a, a family sized sedan and their next global

885
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,120
Speaker 7:  EV after the ID four, which has been on sale for a number of years. And

886
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:31,040
Speaker 7:  I think it's kind of cool that it's a sedan. I mean that's not something

887
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,840
Speaker 7:  that most car makers are proposing these days, especially American

888
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,640
Speaker 7:  car makers. And we saw that with Ram at the, at the show they had their

889
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,600
Speaker 7:  Ram 1500 revolution, which was a big ass truck.

890
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,360
Speaker 7:  And that makes sense because Americans love their big ass trucks, but here

891
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,040
Speaker 7:  comes the, the Germans and they're like, oh, but what about the sedan? Yeah.

892
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,200
Speaker 7:  And I think that that's kind of cool because I think like they can't

893
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,280
Speaker 7:  all be giant humongous trucks

894
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,480
Speaker 7:  with Yeah, batteries as heavy as a Honda Accord

895
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,360
Speaker 7:  because then you're kind of negating the whole idea of electrification.

896
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,800
Speaker 7:  The industry is shifting to electric if they're all trucks.

897
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,800
Speaker 7:  We're just gonna end up in the same place that we are today with a lot

898
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,760
Speaker 7:  of environmental disaster basically because of the mining that needs

899
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,120
Speaker 7:  to take place, the effect that these heavy vehicles have on our roads today.

900
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,080
Speaker 7:  There's way too heavy to really, our road infrastructure already sucks

901
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:28,240
Speaker 7:  at supporting Ram 15 hundreds in their ilk. And

902
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,600
Speaker 7:  I think the fact that the, a battery powered RAM 1500 would be

903
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,400
Speaker 7:  exponentially heavier than the gas powered one is just going to

904
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,680
Speaker 7:  you, you're gonna see sinkhole across the nation as a potential outgrowth

905
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,920
Speaker 7:  of that. So I thought it was cool that Volkswagen was like, Hey, what about

906
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,360
Speaker 7:  a sedan? I don't know. We'll see how well that sells in America. But I think

907
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,280
Speaker 7:  like you need to have all the form factors. If we're gonna be like an electric

908
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,120
Speaker 7:  car world now with no more gas, that's gonna take

909
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:58,280
Speaker 7:  a couple decades to do and they can't all be trucks and SUVs. There needs

910
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,760
Speaker 7:  to be a mix of, of form factors. And the sedan is obviously, I think a very

911
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,720
Speaker 7:  important one to keep in the mix. And so I'm glad to see

912
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,480
Speaker 7:  Volkswagens keeping, keeping the torch lit for the sedan, the family sedan.

913
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well honestly the EVs are never gonna take off until you take, until

914
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,800
Speaker 5:  you get the soccer mom into the ev and right now there is not a decent

915
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,560
Speaker 5:  vehicle for a family. That's right. I have, I don't, and you know, you really,

916
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,800
Speaker 5:  we are the ones on the road all the time, so

917
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,720
Speaker 7:  Yeah, no, I know. We need a minivan too. There needs to be electric

918
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,280
Speaker 7:  Honda Odyssey Electric, Chrysler Pacificas, you know,

919
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,720
Speaker 7:  Kia Sorentos. There needs to be all the beaters and the Jalopies

920
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,440
Speaker 7:  and the Junkers. We need all of those to be electric because that's the only

921
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,360
Speaker 7:  way we're gonna get like carbon out of the situation altogether. And obviously

922
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,920
Speaker 7:  we need bikes and scooters and like smaller form factor vehicles as well.

923
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,200
Speaker 7:  And there were a lot of those at cs and there were some cool ones to, to

924
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,960
Speaker 7:  see I think Cake, which is a great

925
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,240
Speaker 5:  Band,

926
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:57,360
Speaker 7:  A great, a great nineties band, but also a great Swedish

927
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,040
Speaker 7:  electric motorbike company. They released at the show a pretty cool looking

928
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,760
Speaker 7:  e-bike that's for the US for the first time. Really great looking. The

929
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,640
Speaker 7:  design is awesome. I know Thomas Ricker has tested out one of their

930
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,840
Speaker 7:  vehicles in the past. He's really excited about this new one that they've

931
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,480
Speaker 7:  got coming out. So more smaller form sedans

932
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,880
Speaker 7:  obviously, but also more smaller form, weird smart cars,

933
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,640
Speaker 7:  neighborhood electric vehicles. There were a lot of those at the show too.

934
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,040
Speaker 7:  And I think that that that's, you know, like a neighborhood full of electric

935
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,800
Speaker 7:  golf carts that can go 30 miles per hour would be a really interesting

936
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,400
Speaker 7:  concept that you'll never see.

937
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,160
Speaker 5:  You know, that's actually my neighborhood.

938
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,520
Speaker 7:  Well, do you live in the villages in Florida? Is

939
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,720
Speaker 4:  That, I was like, that's my, that's my mom's neighborhood currently. Like,

940
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:42,960
Speaker 5:  But we need

941
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,880
Speaker 7:  To get our seniors into electric golf carts. And so those are, those

942
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,760
Speaker 7:  are a good way to do it. Those were like the main concept, I would say the

943
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,400
Speaker 7:  the BMW color changing car, the Volkswagen sedan, the Ram truck.

944
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,440
Speaker 7:  And there were some other, there were some other ones as well, but I thought

945
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,080
Speaker 7:  most of the, the show was focused on what's going on inside the car

946
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,400
Speaker 7:  screen stuff, tech stuff. We were seeing like

947
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,680
Speaker 7:  Chrysler and reimagining sort of the cockpit

948
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,880
Speaker 7:  BMW was like, Hey, how about no screens, but your

949
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,800
Speaker 7:  windshield is an AR screen. And everyone went,

950
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,120
Speaker 7:  yeah,

951
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:16,720
Speaker 4:  No,

952
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,680
Speaker 7:  That's a bad,

953
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:18,840
Speaker 5:  It's a

954
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,520
Speaker 4:  Bring the cause

955
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,200
Speaker 7:  We need to see through the windshield so that we don't run over people.

956
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,040
Speaker 7:  And if I'm getting notifications about all of my, you know, if I'm getting

957
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,720
Speaker 7:  Slack notifications on my, my windshield while I'm driving, that doesn't,

958
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:35,160
Speaker 7:  that doesn't seem safe, but it's an interesting concept

959
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,920
Speaker 7:  and that's what CS is all about. It's interesting concepts. Well,

960
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,800
Speaker 4:  And this is, we've we've still got the, the Detroit Auto Show coming up

961
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,840
Speaker 4:  pretty quickly, right. And that's where we'll see the more

962
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,960
Speaker 7:  Action actually no, they, they've, they've moved the date of that. It used

963
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,880
Speaker 7:  to be right after ces, which was always fun for all of

964
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,760
Speaker 7:  the auto reporters and their deteriorating health. But now

965
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,240
Speaker 7:  they've moved it to the, the summer. I think the Detroit realized they can't

966
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,040
Speaker 7:  compete anymore since CES has become such a car show over the years that

967
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,720
Speaker 7:  they just threw their hands up and said, screw it, we're gonna move the show

968
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,680
Speaker 7:  to the summertime. So now it's Detroit in the summertime. And you

969
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,560
Speaker 7:  know, auto shows in general have like waned in relevancy over the last decade

970
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,280
Speaker 7:  or so, but CS still stays, has remained I think a pretty

971
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,560
Speaker 7:  relevant auto show. And I, I don't think the pandemic has really

972
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,960
Speaker 7:  had an effect in that, in that respect. It's still is still a pretty great

973
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,600
Speaker 7:  car show and I think it's going to remain a really important car show. I

974
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,720
Speaker 7:  think moving, moving ahead.

975
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,760
Speaker 5:  Well, and they have tractors and boats and stuff. There aren't too. Yeah.

976
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's

977
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,800
Speaker 7:  Like all manners of moving, moving vehicles. There were electric boats,

978
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,440
Speaker 7:  there was tractors. Yeah, I mean like that's, you know, I thought it was

979
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,880
Speaker 7:  a, a positive development to see that that, you know, the, the electrification

980
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,200
Speaker 7:  shift and also more AI focused

981
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,720
Speaker 7:  software applications. Were also making their way into like beyond

982
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,480
Speaker 7:  like the consumer vehicle and into more industrial and commercial applications,

983
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,720
Speaker 7:  which I think is really interesting, especially for autonomy, because that's

984
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,560
Speaker 7:  like, when you think about like a tractor, you don't need a guy sitting in

985
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,200
Speaker 7:  a tractor driving that back and forth across the field. A

986
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,600
Speaker 7:  robot could very easily handle that type of situation. So

987
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:16,600
Speaker 7:  that's a really interesting application. I think a a lot more realistic

988
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,560
Speaker 7:  application than your robo taxis and your Tesla

989
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,480
Speaker 7:  full self-driving and things like that is something where you've

990
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,360
Speaker 7:  got like a contain, you know, sort of a very well-defined operational domain,

991
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,920
Speaker 7:  like a field, like a soybean field or a cornfield like that

992
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,760
Speaker 7:  makes a whole lot more sense to, to have an autonomous

993
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,680
Speaker 7:  driving bit of software doing that as opposed to your

994
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,560
Speaker 7:  Tesla model three.

995
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:44,680
Speaker 4:  Well there was, I will say I was watching NBC this weekend after the

996
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,320
Speaker 4:  show and there was a whole segment about

997
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,360
Speaker 4:  autonomous electric race cars. Oh yeah. Did you, did you

998
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,520
Speaker 4:  check out the, the autonomous race cars?

999
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,760
Speaker 7:  I have not personally checked it out, but I've, I've been pitched by the

1000
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,640
Speaker 7:  Indie autonomous racing organization many times and they, they

1001
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,240
Speaker 7:  seem like it's really, they've got, I'd love to check that out someday. They,

1002
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,480
Speaker 7:  they're, they're an exciting organization. They, yeah, the, the, all the,

1003
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,800
Speaker 7:  the vehicles are driverless. They operate obviously on a, on a racetrack

1004
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,240
Speaker 7:  and it's all about speed, which is not something that you typically see

1005
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:19,920
Speaker 7:  AV developers focused on. They're all focused on safety and following the

1006
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,480
Speaker 7:  rules and making sure that we don't run over pedestrians.

1007
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:26,280
Speaker 5:  This is just go for it. Knock everything over. Yeah.

1008
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,520
Speaker 7:  And the racing guys are like, let's just make this go as fast as we possibly

1009
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,400
Speaker 7:  can, which is kind of exciting. And I think you're starting

1010
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,520
Speaker 7:  to see like motorsports are like really kind of like gaining prominence in

1011
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,240
Speaker 7:  the US especially with like the popularity of f1. And then you've also got

1012
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,480
Speaker 7:  obviously Formula E, which is I think gaining a lot of popularity as well.

1013
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,160
Speaker 7:  So this is like, this could be like a next, a possible next step

1014
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,120
Speaker 7:  beyond Formula E autonomous racing vehicles I think is a,

1015
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,120
Speaker 7:  is a very cool concept. And it'd be maybe like, you know, they'll get picked

1016
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,400
Speaker 7:  up for like a Netflix series or something someday, but like

1017
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,960
Speaker 4:  Would you really watch two computers just race each other? Isn't that just

1018
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,680
Speaker 4:  like watching the bots and Mario Cart race each other?

1019
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:04,440
Speaker 4:  People

1020
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,000
Speaker 7:  Watch the robots fight, right? Isn't there like bot wars?

1021
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I say robot

1022
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,880
Speaker 7:  Wars, robot wars people

1023
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,840
Speaker 5:  Love, I've watched my vacuums fight each other. It's so much fun. People

1024
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,040
Speaker 7:  Love that stuff. So the idea, because like there is like a human, there's

1025
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,880
Speaker 7:  still a human element, like somebody had to develop the software and the

1026
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,720
Speaker 7:  vehicle, there are people behind this robot that are, that are racing on

1027
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,440
Speaker 7:  the track and while there may not be a guy in the car itself,

1028
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,960
Speaker 7:  like there is still some sort of human element that was, you know, and human

1029
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,880
Speaker 7:  ingenuity and all, you know, all the effort and

1030
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,800
Speaker 7:  work that went into making those, those cars drive themselves that I think

1031
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,600
Speaker 7:  you can still celebrate and feel excited for.

1032
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:42,080
Speaker 4:  Well you almost got me excited about autonomous racing, so welcome
