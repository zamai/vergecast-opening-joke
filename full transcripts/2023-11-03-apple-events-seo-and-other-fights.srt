20
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:24,715
Speaker 3:  Hello and Welcome. To Vergecast. The flagship podcast of the Touch Bar.

21
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:25,915
Speaker 4:  It's

22
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:27,635
Speaker 3:  Good. Only one of us thinks that Alex,

23
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:28,155
Speaker 1:  It's,

24
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:28,475
Speaker 4:  It's

25
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:29,235
Speaker 3:  True. Two

26
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:36,275
Speaker 3:  I, okay. One thing that is true is that I became friends with a

27
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:39,235
Speaker 3:  very famous record producer on Instagram because of the Touch Bar.

28
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,075
Speaker 4:  That was the best humble brag I've heard a lot. That's

29
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:42,315
Speaker 3:  Pretty good.

30
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:43,115
Speaker 4:  Who?

31
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:46,155
Speaker 1:  Who? Okay. So Neli and David gta are best friends.

32
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,995
Speaker 3:  No. Oak Felder. You should follow him on Instagram. He's Oak Orchestra. Oh

33
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:53,915
Speaker 3:  yeah, he's, he's super cool. Okay. They're just like dad friends. We just

34
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:57,355
Speaker 3:  like, like pictures of each other's kids now of this for you. But he did

35
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:01,035
Speaker 3:  a video with us just about how to make music with a Mac during one of our

36
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:04,075
Speaker 3:  music video series. And he was like, I, and he was using the Touch Bar on

37
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:08,035
Speaker 3:  his computer and I was like, what are you doing? And he was like, I

38
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:10,475
Speaker 3:  love this thing. And he was like swiping through logic on the Touch Bar and

39
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:13,955
Speaker 3:  we just started. Wow. That's it. That's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

40
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:14,395
Speaker 3:  That's

41
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:15,875
Speaker 4:  Beautiful. Yeah. I should have talked to

42
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,835
Speaker 3:  Him. A beautiful dad friendship. Yeah. He doesn't post about the Touch Bar

43
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:22,555
Speaker 3:  on his Instagram. It's mostly like him doing recording artist stuff and

44
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:22,915
Speaker 3:  pictures.

45
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,395
Speaker 4:  I think if more people had it probably wouldn't have gone away. Yeah. If

46
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:29,995
Speaker 3:  More Grammy award winning musicians were like the Touch Bar rules, I think

47
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:32,835
Speaker 3:  we'd be in a very different spot in America in 2023

48
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,755
Speaker 4:  Only. It would only be on the 16th. Hi,

49
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,235
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend. Neli Alex. Cranz is here.

50
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:40,115
Speaker 4:  Hi. I'm your friend who loves the Touch Bar and the Texas Rangers who are

51
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:43,635
Speaker 4:  now have a World Series pin. It. I don't know how the World Series works,

52
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:45,355
Speaker 4:  but I've been waiting 30 years. It's awesome.

53
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:49,035
Speaker 3:  You've been waiting 30 years and learned none of the vocabulary of

54
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,675
Speaker 4:  It along the way. None of it. None of it. I learned who Nolan Ryan and Jose

55
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:55,675
Speaker 4:  Sseko were in 1993. Nice. And nothing until this year.

56
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:58,115
Speaker 4:  And apparently the Rangers rule you

57
00:02:58,115 --> 00:03:01,045
Speaker 5:  Didn't miss that much between the two to be fair. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm

58
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:04,245
Speaker 3:  Okay. I follow one of those threads accounts. It's like freezing cold sports

59
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:07,125
Speaker 3:  takes. And they had one about the Rangers and it was like, I don't know who

60
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:11,045
Speaker 3:  any of those names are or what baseball is David. Pierce is

61
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:14,565
Speaker 5:  Here. What's up guys? I'm in my sick gamer YouTube channel

62
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:16,815
Speaker 5:  set up. David's

63
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:19,575
Speaker 3:  In our DC office, the Vox Media DC office, which is

64
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:22,615
Speaker 5:  Aka a our Sik Gamer YouTube channel set up. I feel like I said that already.

65
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:26,135
Speaker 3:  That office is mostly populated by like the corporate staff of the company

66
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:29,775
Speaker 3:  and then vox.com. And a little bit of estimation, I think.

67
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:33,335
Speaker 3:  And of course when you think of vox.com, you think of gamer lights. Yeah,

68
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:36,975
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Obviously, I will say I'm here because I lost power

69
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:40,935
Speaker 5:  today just out of nowhere. On a sunny day in the middle

70
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:45,175
Speaker 5:  of an interview for The Vergecast with two of the people who made

71
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:49,375
Speaker 5:  Planet Earth three. We were having an unbelievable time

72
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,775
Speaker 5:  talking about cool drone photography in caves, which someday,

73
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:57,775
Speaker 5:  Lord willing you will hear on The Vergecast. And my power just

74
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:00,735
Speaker 5:  disappeared. And now I'm here. I hate it. It's been a day.

75
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:04,815
Speaker 3:  I took a meeting with a, a developer who's making a cool app

76
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:07,335
Speaker 3:  the David was supposed to be on, and I said, David lost power. And he looked

77
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:09,295
Speaker 3:  at the weather and said, it's not raining out there. Yep.

78
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,175
Speaker 3:  Very

79
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:13,855
Speaker 5:  Good. It's not

80
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:17,295
Speaker 3:  Bunch of news. This week there was an Apple event, which we, we should talk

81
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:21,135
Speaker 3:  about. A lot of people have a lot of feelings about this event and particularly

82
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,615
Speaker 3:  how it was shot. Oh, oh my. Sometimes The Verge,

83
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:27,295
Speaker 3:  you're on a publication, you're lucky if everyone's talking about one story.

84
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:31,455
Speaker 3:  We had like three different groups of people sort of like up in arms

85
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:35,375
Speaker 3:  about three different stories this week. And I was like, oh, we are the only

86
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,055
Speaker 3:  tech site that remains on the internet. There's, there's no one else to yell

87
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:42,535
Speaker 3:  it but us. But Apple Event, new Max, we should talk about those.

88
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:46,455
Speaker 3:  We published the next installment of our big Google package about

89
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:50,655
Speaker 3:  sort of where we are on the web and what's going on with search. Now

90
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:54,735
Speaker 3:  AI is coming. I would say that really

91
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,215
Speaker 3:  got a lot of people going. And those people happen to be search engine

92
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:02,015
Speaker 3:  optimization experts. So their comments are impeccably

93
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,935
Speaker 3:  formatted for discoverability. That's true. It's a

94
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:06,855
Speaker 5:  Nice reminder every once in a while. Like, do you have those moments where

95
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:10,815
Speaker 5:  like a, an a corner of the internet wakes up in response to something

96
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:13,695
Speaker 5:  and you're like, oh, I didn't even know you were there. Yeah. Yeah. It's

97
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:16,775
Speaker 5:  like, like when, when the knitters get really angry, you're just like, oh,

98
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:19,615
Speaker 5:  all the people who love to knit, they just hang out together. That's so cool.

99
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:19,855
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

100
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:22,815
Speaker 3:  That's not a win. That's a permanent case with the knitting c that is

101
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:24,935
Speaker 5:  Just constant rage pit at all

102
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:27,655
Speaker 3:  Times. They're holding needles in their not afraid to use them, sir.

103
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:31,495
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But it was just like, it was like we, we accidentally walked into the

104
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:32,535
Speaker 5:  SEO bar this week.

105
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:34,735
Speaker 3:  No, we bared into it and said, you all suck.

106
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:35,935
Speaker 5:  That's,

107
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,535
Speaker 3:  That's what we did. That's fair. And I, I don't want to, that's shy away

108
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:39,215
Speaker 3:  from it. We'll get to that

109
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:44,175
Speaker 3:  more Google News. They're about to go to trial and the antitrust case with

110
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:47,855
Speaker 3:  Epic. David was in the other antitrust

111
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:51,695
Speaker 3:  trial this week. Sundar Phai testified. We gotta talk about that. There's

112
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:55,575
Speaker 3:  some spicy documents from Apple that were revealed in that case. That's pretty

113
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:56,095
Speaker 3:  good. Spicy

114
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,965
Speaker 5:  Documents. I love a spicy document.

115
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:02,045
Speaker 3:  I love a spicy document. Eddie Q's like, put some hot sauce on

116
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,765
Speaker 3:  that before you send it out. It's just the little, the little salt in the

117
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:08,485
Speaker 3:  cold storage for the prosecutors to find 10 years from now. And then there's

118
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:12,005
Speaker 3:  a bunch of streaming news. Yeah. People are buying things. Prices are inevitably

119
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,685
Speaker 3:  going up. And we got a lightning round, which is still not sponsored. And

120
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:19,125
Speaker 3:  I implore you major American ship maker

121
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:24,475
Speaker 3:  to call our financial sac, our business, our business development

122
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,235
Speaker 3:  person. Make it happen.

123
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,355
Speaker 3:  Yeah, there's, there's some good stuff in line too. Okay, let's start with

124
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,635
Speaker 3:  the Apple event. Scary fest. I would say

125
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:38,285
Speaker 3:  I was very disappointed. There were not more Halloween jokes.

126
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:40,445
Speaker 3:  There were a, you

127
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:43,445
Speaker 5:  Were also just wrong. Like we should just call this what you were, you were

128
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:47,205
Speaker 5:  wrong. And I feel like this is, this is the time when you should atone for

129
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:50,725
Speaker 5:  how wrong you were about what Hale was doing here. Yeah. Where's your scary

130
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,005
Speaker 5:  costume today, Eli?

131
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:53,805
Speaker 3:  No, thank you.

132
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:58,525
Speaker 3:  I did dress, I dressed, my parents were here for trick free. I dressed them

133
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:02,245
Speaker 3:  up as a witch in a warlock, which means I put hats on them. Yes.

134
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:05,125
Speaker 3:  And that's, and and then my dad was like, oh no, I lost the hat.

135
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:10,845
Speaker 3:  What a surprise. My prediction, if I recall this correctly, would just be

136
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:14,205
Speaker 3:  like over the top TV production, they're gonna compete with money at football.

137
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,845
Speaker 3:  Craig Federighi doing a Vampire Voice the whole time. That did

138
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,925
Speaker 3:  not happen. And I want to make it clear I was wrong about that, but also

139
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:26,285
Speaker 3:  that I was right in that it should have been what happened because the

140
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:30,045
Speaker 3:  actual announcements were so lackluster that Craig Federighi

141
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:33,605
Speaker 3:  doing a vampire voice, I think would've been more fulfilling to people. Yeah.

142
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:34,765
Speaker 3:  Right. Yeah.

143
00:07:34,765 --> 00:07:38,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Nila, you posted at one point on threads, I think something to the

144
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:41,845
Speaker 5:  effect of Apple has lost the plot of why people actually watch these things.

145
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:42,765
Speaker 5:  What did you mean

146
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:46,445
Speaker 3:  This one in particular? So if you go back

147
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:50,645
Speaker 3:  and watch a Steve Jobs Apple event, he was the

148
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:54,365
Speaker 3:  master of making you feel like, one,

149
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:57,645
Speaker 3:  he understood the problem and two, only he could solve it.

150
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,755
Speaker 3:  And three, the product was cool as hell. Right? th and that here is the solution

151
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:06,275
Speaker 3:  to the product. And that first part I understand the problem

152
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:11,155
Speaker 3:  is the, I I think is a person who came up covering these

153
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:14,755
Speaker 3:  events and watching them unfold and watching them grow to what they are now.

154
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:18,715
Speaker 3:  That's the part that's gone. But it's also the thing that was the most fulfilling.

155
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:23,155
Speaker 3:  Everyone knows the first iPhone event, right? The problem is all these buttons

156
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:26,995
Speaker 3:  down here, so we're gonna make a touch screen. Like any put up

157
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:30,155
Speaker 3:  the problem. He was like, here's a picture of other people's idiot problems

158
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:33,715
Speaker 3:  and I'm gonna fix it for you. And this is how smartphones are gonna work.

159
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:37,635
Speaker 3:  Now he did that like all the time. And Apple traditionally kind

160
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:40,275
Speaker 3:  of does that, right? They like identify the problem and they're like, here's

161
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:44,115
Speaker 3:  how we're gonna solve it. And this one in particular, I just

162
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:48,035
Speaker 3:  felt like identified no problems. It was like our,

163
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,755
Speaker 3:  the problem we're solving is that the chip is even faster,

164
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:55,850
Speaker 3:  Right? And then, and then you look at how they were trying to sell it. They

165
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,045
Speaker 3:  were like, this one is for creative professionals. If you're coming from

166
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:02,725
Speaker 3:  an Intel Mac, it'll be 11 times faster. They just weren't

167
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:07,125
Speaker 3:  solving any problems with the products. It was just like

168
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,925
Speaker 3:  pure marketing. There's just a moment in the middle of it. I actually didn't

169
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,805
Speaker 3:  put it on threads. I just said that to you privately. You doxxed me,

170
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:19,165
Speaker 3:  my bad, whatever. I'll say, I'll say it now. There was just a moment in that

171
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:22,545
Speaker 3:  where I was like, this could be any company. Like this is how basically every

172
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:25,705
Speaker 3:  company markets their products now. They're just like, look at how good it

173
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:25,825
Speaker 3:  is.

174
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:29,985
Speaker 4:  It was just an AMD keynote. AMD also loves to do an

175
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:33,345
Speaker 4:  evening keynote. Everybody loves to wear all black. There's usually some

176
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:37,145
Speaker 4:  leather involved, but not in a fun way. And then they talk about a bunch

177
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:38,745
Speaker 4:  of processors and show a bunch of charts.

178
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:42,825
Speaker 3:  So Qualcomm had an event the same week, ALS and Johnson was in Hawaii

179
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:46,145
Speaker 3:  for the event. She wrote a great piece about it. Festival of Marketing. And

180
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:49,225
Speaker 3:  the piece is basically about the festival of marketing. Qualcomm's processor

181
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:53,345
Speaker 3:  graphs are the same as Apples. They're the same unlabeled graph. And you

182
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:56,865
Speaker 3:  could argue that they're just copying Apple or Apple's copying Qualcomm or

183
00:09:56,865 --> 00:10:00,495
Speaker 3:  there's a long history of these graphs. But just from the perspective of

184
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:04,535
Speaker 3:  are these events different? Do these companies act differently? The answer

185
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:07,615
Speaker 3:  is, oh, they're converging. They're all converging on the same sort of marketing.

186
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,015
Speaker 3:  I don't mean to say that the products are bad. I have a 16 inch M one Pro

187
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:14,255
Speaker 3:  MacBook Pro. It is the best computer I have ever owned.

188
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:18,895
Speaker 3:  You, you put a better chip in it. You do some software tweaks to make it

189
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:22,655
Speaker 3:  600 knits instead of 500. I'm happy as long as the battery life lasts, as

190
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,935
Speaker 3:  long as this one does. The problem is they've so fundamentally solved the

191
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:26,135
Speaker 3:  problem.

192
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:28,095
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

193
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:31,495
Speaker 3:  That they're, they're just going, they're kind of reverting to marketing

194
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:31,895
Speaker 3:  and

195
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:35,455
Speaker 4:  It, they've been doing it honestly for a little while now. Like it's, it's

196
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:38,535
Speaker 4:  been a couple of years of they're not really solving a problem. They're inventing

197
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:42,375
Speaker 4:  problems to solve on stage. And So I think we see that a lot

198
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,735
Speaker 4:  with, with with a lot of the camera stuff they're doing. They're like, don't

199
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:48,415
Speaker 4:  you hate that you can't see every fiber of a sweater? And it's like

200
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:52,535
Speaker 4:  three people hate that, but most people are fine. and it it,

201
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:56,015
Speaker 4:  I I do agree with you that in the beginning it really felt like there was

202
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,935
Speaker 4:  a problem and they were solving it. And in some cases it was the

203
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:03,575
Speaker 4:  problem was Apple's own making. 'cause Apple was at that time, like a pretty

204
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:07,375
Speaker 4:  crummy company and it got better. And now it's just like, okay, you're at

205
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,295
Speaker 4:  the top of your game. What do you do next? And they're like, we do it at

206
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,175
Speaker 4:  night. Right.

207
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:16,095
Speaker 3:  And that's not enough. And mostly they're mostly the, we have solved a problem

208
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:20,455
Speaker 3:  involved the introduction of a new category. Right. So they the iPod

209
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:24,365
Speaker 3:  that watch the iPod launch event, right. He's like a thousand songs

210
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:24,925
Speaker 3:  in your pocket.

211
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,125
Speaker 4:  Creative Jukebox in the audience Furious.

212
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:29,605
Speaker 3:  Right. He put up a picture of that thing and it was like, this thing sucks.

213
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:33,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like he really did. He was like, here's the MP three players of the

214
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,645
Speaker 3:  of the day. Here's the ones that are flash memory, here's the hard drive

215
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:39,365
Speaker 3:  ones. These suck. I made a good one. Yeah. And, and then every iPod every

216
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:43,325
Speaker 3:  year after he invented a reason, well that was like why they were bad

217
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:46,765
Speaker 3:  and they like fix it. Whatever the iPad,

218
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:51,695
Speaker 3:  if you watch the iPad one, it is remarkable

219
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:55,325
Speaker 3:  actually. 'cause he is like, you have a phone and a laptop and there's some,

220
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:57,045
Speaker 3:  there's space in between.

221
00:11:57,825 --> 00:12:01,805
Speaker 5:  He brought like a comfy armchair Yeah. On stage. Like that was, that was

222
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:05,525
Speaker 5:  the thing. It was the armchair computer. Right? Like that was he he did such

223
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,685
Speaker 5:  a good job of that. Yeah. He

224
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:10,525
Speaker 3:  He had a show to put on for you in You know whatever Steve Jobs

225
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:14,445
Speaker 3:  was Steve Jobs. I'm just saying that was the thing. And I think Apple

226
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,885
Speaker 3:  has now gotten to this place where these are in, it's an infomercial. We

227
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:21,285
Speaker 3:  all sat around and watched a 23 minute infomercial the other night. It was

228
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:23,885
Speaker 3:  produced like one, it was shot like one. I understand people have a lot of

229
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:27,085
Speaker 3:  feelings about that, but it was a TV show. Yeah. They should have done more

230
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:30,765
Speaker 3:  vampire voices. I will. Tim Cook kind of did one

231
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:34,805
Speaker 3:  with the first Good Evening and Johnny Shreeji was like, Welcome To my

232
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:38,405
Speaker 3:  lab. And he was clearly, if they had let him, he would've done the whole

233
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:41,605
Speaker 3:  thing in the Voice. Yes. But those are the only two I got out of it. There

234
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:45,485
Speaker 3:  were some eyes blinking in the background, whatever. All the, all I'm saying,

235
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:47,965
Speaker 3:  and this is the most minor criticism because we should talk, actually talk

236
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:51,885
Speaker 3:  about the products, the show of it, ever since it's become a

237
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:55,685
Speaker 3:  TV show has veered into just sort of regular

238
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:59,525
Speaker 3:  marketing and not the Apple will identify

239
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:03,325
Speaker 3:  a thing that everyone is frustrated with or has never thought of and show

240
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,165
Speaker 3:  you something. The Vision Pro is arguably that product right now.

241
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:09,845
Speaker 3:  Right. It's the new category. It's the new use cases,

242
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,885
Speaker 4:  But they didn't have a problem to solve for it.

243
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:16,205
Speaker 3:  That's, I would say is the problem. Yeah. And. what?

244
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:19,005
Speaker 3:  We'll see how it goes. But yeah, I don't, we don't need to over index on

245
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:22,925
Speaker 3:  whether the 23 minute, last minute Mac infomercial was like the

246
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:26,005
Speaker 3:  best Apple keynote of all. I'm, when I say they've lost the plot on why people

247
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,335
Speaker 3:  watch these, it's if you just watch them now, the only problem they have

248
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:32,095
Speaker 3:  to solve is like, five years ago you bought an Intel Mac and now you should

249
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:34,735
Speaker 3:  buy a new one. And that's not a great problem to solve. Yeah.

250
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:38,135
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Which I think is why they're leaning ever harder into

251
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:41,135
Speaker 5:  pros. Right. And that's like, that was so much of what this event was about.

252
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:44,895
Speaker 5:  I just keep thinking about when they launched the Mac Pro and we were getting

253
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:48,735
Speaker 5:  demos of it and seeing how things worked, the demo was literally

254
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:52,895
Speaker 5:  avatar. Yeah. That it's like, this is, these computers are so good.

255
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:57,615
Speaker 5:  Imagine if you were making the most complicated movie ever made in history,

256
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:02,495
Speaker 5:  you would need this Mac Pro and you're just like, All. right. Sick. Like

257
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:06,335
Speaker 5:  how many Chrome taps can it handle? Like what I just is they,

258
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,855
Speaker 5:  they, we've just gotten into these tiny niches where this stuff, especially

259
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:12,975
Speaker 5:  having to do this every year, right? Like if Apple only had to tell this

260
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:16,895
Speaker 5:  story every five years, it wouldn't be that hard telling everybody who bought

261
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:20,775
Speaker 5:  a computer in 2018, why the M three MacBook Pro is gonna blow your mind

262
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:24,535
Speaker 5:  is not complicated. But they have to keep telling this story

263
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:29,055
Speaker 5:  year after year after year. And, and it does, you can just see it

264
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:33,015
Speaker 5:  get sort of smaller and smaller and smaller. The people who are sort of actually

265
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:36,295
Speaker 5:  meaningfully going to notice the thing over the last year. And again, in

266
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:39,735
Speaker 5:  a lot of ways that's a really good thing. Like these are great super mature

267
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:43,615
Speaker 5:  products. It just, it just makes this particular job much

268
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:44,775
Speaker 5:  harder, I think. Yeah. I

269
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:47,975
Speaker 4:  That's why Qualcomm does it in Hawaii is because

270
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:48,575
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

271
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,350
Speaker 4:  Seriously. 'cause they, they ran into the same issue. Like all of the processor

272
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:54,525
Speaker 4:  companies have been dealing with this for a very long time. And Apple's now

273
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:57,365
Speaker 4:  having to reckon with it too, where like, yeah, these speed improvements

274
00:14:57,365 --> 00:15:00,445
Speaker 4:  are nice, but they're mainly nice for when you look back five years.

275
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:05,245
Speaker 4:  And most people in our industry don't care about that. And a lot of our readers

276
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:09,685
Speaker 4:  probably don't care about it. Like my brother who has a five-year-old computer

277
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,765
Speaker 4:  might care. But, but tho those people who, who tune into these

278
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:17,405
Speaker 4:  events to see the next big thing don't care about a small

279
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,885
Speaker 4:  speed bump. Yeah.

280
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,955
Speaker 3:  I will say that there was one problem that they created that they solved

281
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:25,875
Speaker 3:  to grade acclaim, which was the Touch Bar and the butterfly keyboard.

282
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:26,515
Speaker 3:  The

283
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:27,195
Speaker 4:  Butterfly keyboard

284
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:30,515
Speaker 3:  Don't give, and the utter lack of ports on the MacBook Pro.

285
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:33,995
Speaker 3:  And they, they fixed that a couple years ago. Yeah. Again, best computer

286
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:37,795
Speaker 3:  I've ever owned. And then this year was the end of the 13 inch

287
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:38,635
Speaker 3:  MacBook Pro with the Touch

288
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:42,315
Speaker 4:  Bar. Yeah. Yeah. I I feel like we, we've kind of been memorializing it

289
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:46,235
Speaker 4:  since it stopped getting a lot of the same updates as everybody else. It

290
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:49,635
Speaker 4:  was kind of sitting off in the corner by itself, clearly on its last legs.

291
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,635
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But this year they were like, no, we're done.

292
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:52,635
Speaker 3:  We're

293
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:55,915
Speaker 4:  Out. Yeah. We're putting the stake in the heart. We're we're salting the

294
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:58,275
Speaker 4:  earth. We're Closing the door. We're done with it. And it's a bummer.

295
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,875
Speaker 3:  Good vampire imagery. Yeah.

296
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,235
Speaker 4:  Oh, I, I'm bringing it. Apple didn't, but I did.

297
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:07,995
Speaker 4:  I I, I still liked the concept of the thing. I

298
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:11,915
Speaker 4:  still wish they had like, leaned in on the Touch Bar, but the Touch Bar

299
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:15,475
Speaker 4:  was really a placeholder for the, the M one,

300
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:18,715
Speaker 4:  like the Touch Bar came out because they wanted to show everybody they cared

301
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:22,555
Speaker 4:  about laptops because in 2016 they didn't care about laptops.

302
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:26,315
Speaker 4:  They were running all the MacBook posts had, has wells in 'em from like 2014

303
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:30,195
Speaker 4:  or 2013. And, and they were like, no, no, we care. We care. So

304
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:32,955
Speaker 4:  look, we've got this cool new way of thinking about computers. We're putting

305
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,755
Speaker 4:  a Touch Bar in it. And everybody's like, cool, what can we do with it? And

306
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:39,155
Speaker 4:  they're like, we'll get back to you. Yeah. But it's cool. And then a few

307
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:41,075
Speaker 4:  years later they're like, we've got them one and this is really cool. And

308
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:45,035
Speaker 4:  everybody's like, oh, that is cool. I want that. And So I always

309
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:48,635
Speaker 4:  feel like it was just a placeholder to keep people invested in Apple

310
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:52,235
Speaker 4:  laptops until the real deal showed up a few years later.

311
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,835
Speaker 3:  I That's a very kind way of thinking about the touch force.

312
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:58,515
Speaker 4:  I was just You know when you, when you care about something that deeply,

313
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,395
Speaker 4:  you're always looking for the good. Yeah.

314
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:04,515
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I think they made a giant mistake and refused to admit it for several

315
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:08,195
Speaker 3:  years. That honestly, I think they, that that was the period where

316
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:12,355
Speaker 3:  they thought the future of computing was the iPad and they were pushing

317
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:15,315
Speaker 3:  everyone towards the iPad. And then Mac was languishing. Yeah. And they're,

318
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,835
Speaker 3:  and everyone thought you need to put a touchscreen on the Mac. And they were

319
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:18,635
Speaker 4:  Like, no, they're

320
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:21,795
Speaker 3:  Still, maybe some people kind of do, there's a Bloomberg report, by the way,

321
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:25,715
Speaker 3:  this week or the week before where Germin said a forthcoming

322
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:26,955
Speaker 3:  touchscreen Mac. Oh,

323
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:27,395
Speaker 4:  What?

324
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,635
Speaker 3:  Wow. This is a real thing. Who knows? We

325
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:30,955
Speaker 4:  Yeah. One day.

326
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,195
Speaker 3:  But Robert wrote, right, this was the height of what you might call Apple's

327
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:38,115
Speaker 3:  Touch era. And they, they weren't gonna do it on the Mac 'cause they didn't

328
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:40,875
Speaker 3:  want to cannibalize the iPad in anyway. So they're like, you want a touchscreen

329
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,555
Speaker 3:  on the Mac? Here's a weird little one. Also, the keyboard

330
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:48,435
Speaker 3:  is garbage and it has no ports. And people resolutely

331
00:17:48,455 --> 00:17:52,335
Speaker 3:  refuse to let the Mac die until they re-upped the MacBook Air. And then

332
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:56,015
Speaker 3:  eventually M one came out. And then the weird thing was

333
00:17:56,925 --> 00:18:00,335
Speaker 3:  they did the good MacBook Pro, the 14 inch MacBook Pro,

334
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:03,895
Speaker 3:  they did the MacBook Air, the MacBook Air got all the way to M two and this

335
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:07,815
Speaker 3:  weird dumb 13 inch MacBook Pro at the Touch Bar just

336
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:11,895
Speaker 3:  persisted. I wanna, it's, it's like two years beyond

337
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,455
Speaker 3:  its expiration date at least. Yeah.

338
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:16,775
Speaker 4:  I wanna know who, who are the people who, were the people still buying it

339
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:17,375
Speaker 4:  there at the end?

340
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:18,855
Speaker 3:  Some people,

341
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:21,815
Speaker 5:  I don't know man. We, we wrote a story a couple of weeks ago about somebody

342
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:24,975
Speaker 5:  who bought a weu the other day. That's fair. There's people out there That's

343
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:28,295
Speaker 5:  fair. There's there's people out there doing stuff. But no, I think, I think

344
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:32,255
Speaker 5:  Apple made two mistakes with the Touch Bar, which I do not

345
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:35,535
Speaker 5:  believe still to this day was a fundamentally bad idea. It

346
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:36,295
Speaker 4:  Is a good concept.

347
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:40,335
Speaker 5:  Mistake number one, look down at your laptop right now and if you're in your

348
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:42,495
Speaker 5:  car, if, imagine a laptop.

349
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:45,775
Speaker 3:  If you're in your car and you have the ability to look down at your laptop

350
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,695
Speaker 3:  right now, pull over in your car

351
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:52,495
Speaker 5:  And also call The Vergecast hotline because you are our people. Do you

352
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:55,575
Speaker 5:  see, do you see how you have all the function buttons on your, on your laptop?

353
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:59,615
Speaker 5:  Do you see how there's still some space above it between the, where there's

354
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:03,495
Speaker 5:  just space Put the Touch Bar there. That's the

355
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:07,375
Speaker 5:  answer. Like they said, what if we took away a bunch of buttons you

356
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,015
Speaker 5:  love and replaced it with mostly nothing. Like that's terrible. Yeah. That's

357
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:14,775
Speaker 5:  not, that's not anything. I still believe to this day that if the first version

358
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:18,535
Speaker 5:  of the Touch Bar had kept the escape key, the Touch Bar had like a 60%

359
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:22,015
Speaker 5:  chance to be successful, but it was because it didn't have the escape key.

360
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:25,775
Speaker 5:  And all of a sudden this very basic thing that professional computer users

361
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:29,815
Speaker 5:  do all day every day became harder because your finger couldn't

362
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:33,575
Speaker 5:  find it anymore. Like instant disaster. Yeah. That's mistake number one

363
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:37,455
Speaker 5:  was getting rid of keys people use to add this weird thing that

364
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,615
Speaker 5:  no one ever asked for. Mistake number two was

365
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:45,375
Speaker 5:  stopping investing in it. Like Apple has a good history of

366
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,895
Speaker 5:  saying we care about this thing. And thus you developers should figure out

367
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:52,495
Speaker 5:  what to do with it. And if it does that long enough, it usually works. And

368
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:55,895
Speaker 5:  on the Touch Bar for like 15 minutes, they were like, come build cool apps.

369
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:58,575
Speaker 5:  And then they were like, ah, nevermind. We're probably gonna bail on this

370
00:19:58,575 --> 00:19:58,775
Speaker 5:  idea.

371
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:02,015
Speaker 3:  No. So they had a huge problem here. They do this all the time. The best

372
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:05,215
Speaker 3:  example is iPhone, right? They bring a, a high-end feature to an iPhone Pro

373
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:09,375
Speaker 3:  and the next year the regular iPhone gets it and then everyone has it. Yeah.

374
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:11,855
Speaker 3:  And then developers are like, wow, look at all this cool stuff Apple made.

375
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:14,495
Speaker 3:  I've got some ideas they need too. They never brought the Touch Bar out of

376
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:15,215
Speaker 3:  the MacBook Pro.

377
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:16,815
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Or, and even

378
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,015
Speaker 4:  Out

379
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,735
Speaker 3:  Of the, because they knew it was bad. Aw. They were watching

380
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,655
Speaker 3:  all these pro users stare at their horrible keyboards

381
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:27,815
Speaker 3:  and they thought to themselves, we cannot give this to the general public.

382
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:32,135
Speaker 5:  Hence mistake number one. Yeah. Like you can't get rid of the function

383
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:35,575
Speaker 5:  keys. Yeah. It's like if Apple was like, look, we built this

384
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:39,575
Speaker 5:  cool Touch Bar, but also we just scrambled all your letter keys around like,

385
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:40,695
Speaker 5:  no, don't do that.

386
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:43,895
Speaker 3:  Look, it's dead here, here. It's amazing to me that we've spent this much

387
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:47,325
Speaker 3:  time in the Touch Bar, which I finally vanquished. They announced like three

388
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,525
Speaker 3:  new processors and four new computers. No, it's,

389
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:52,005
Speaker 5:  We talked about all that on Wednesday. Who cares? You know

390
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:54,925
Speaker 4:  What we talked earlier about how they didn't solve a problem during this

391
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:57,045
Speaker 4:  event. They did. They got

392
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:58,565
Speaker 3:  Rid of the Touch Bar not having enough processors.

393
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:01,765
Speaker 4:  No, they got rid of the Touch Bar. They solved a problem if they had led

394
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:03,085
Speaker 4:  with that. Like

395
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:07,605
Speaker 3:  See, that's a good Halloween show. Yeah. Tim Cook dressed up as the

396
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:11,445
Speaker 3:  grim reaper chasing Eddie Q in a Touch Bar outfit

397
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:15,085
Speaker 3:  down the hallway. I would've watched two hours of that. That's pretty good.

398
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:17,245
Speaker 3:  I probably would've That's good. I would've put pre-ordered at the end.

399
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:20,765
Speaker 4:  I don't wanna watch that show. But I would've watched gifs of it. I would've

400
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:21,605
Speaker 4:  watch the TikTok clips

401
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:22,525
Speaker 3:  Pronounced gif.

402
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:27,085
Speaker 3:  So if you wanted the deep dive on the main announcements, the Wednesday show

403
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:31,005
Speaker 3:  is there for you quickly. They basically spec bumped the 14 inch and

404
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,765
Speaker 3:  16 inch MacBook Pro. They spec bumped the

405
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:39,205
Speaker 3:  iMac. They did not do a bigger screen size. They spent an like an

406
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:42,965
Speaker 3:  inor amount of time saying that 24.5 inches,

407
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:44,925
Speaker 3:  4.5 K display was perfect.

408
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:48,725
Speaker 4:  Sounded a lot like the Touch Bar is gonna revolutionize.

409
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:52,165
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It was just a lot of like, this is the perfect size in between four

410
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:56,045
Speaker 3:  K and five K and it's like, is it, or is it just the size in

411
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:56,965
Speaker 3:  between four K and five

412
00:21:57,045 --> 00:22:00,405
Speaker 5:  K? It's just the one you already made a lot of. That's

413
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:03,445
Speaker 3:  It. I am, I'm dying because I

414
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:07,045
Speaker 3:  really wanted a new 27 inch iMac to replace my, my

415
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:10,485
Speaker 3:  20 15 27 inch iMac that I already

416
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,925
Speaker 3:  rescued from its planned obsolescence in our studio. Couldn't

417
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:16,205
Speaker 4:  You just get like a Mac studio and slap it on the end? But

418
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,485
Speaker 5:  Then I have to

419
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:19,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But then I have to like buy a new monitor, all this stuff. Anyway,

420
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:23,235
Speaker 3:  we, they just sent me a new USB audio interface

421
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:27,475
Speaker 3:  for recording at home. 'cause my old one is kind of flaking out. Yeah,

422
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:28,555
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm aware

423
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,595
Speaker 3:  It's A-U-S-B-C only. So I've got, I gotta get

424
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:35,395
Speaker 3:  a new Mac So I was like, I'll just buy the new 27 inch Trimm Mac have to

425
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,915
Speaker 4:  Get a new Mac. That's the only solution. I gotta

426
00:22:36,915 --> 00:22:40,715
Speaker 3:  Do something now. But now, now, but I'm not gonna buy this little

427
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:41,155
Speaker 3:  baby

428
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:45,315
Speaker 5:  Mac. Yeah. My in-laws had a 27 inch iMac from

429
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:49,435
Speaker 5:  I think 2011, possibly even like 2009. They had

430
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:53,395
Speaker 5:  this thing forever and it finally got to the point where it's like they tried

431
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:56,795
Speaker 5:  to load the tax website and it just didn't, it was like this, this computer

432
00:22:57,015 --> 00:23:00,995
Speaker 5:  is a security risk. Like we can't do this anymore guys. So they've

433
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:04,115
Speaker 5:  been asking me for like a year and a half. When is the 27 inch iMac coming

434
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:07,955
Speaker 5:  out? And I kept saying, I went from, I think

435
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:10,835
Speaker 5:  it's gonna happen. Give it a minute to, I don't think this is gonna happen.

436
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:14,555
Speaker 5:  'cause the Mac studio and the studio display or the answers So, I got them

437
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:18,115
Speaker 5:  to buy a Mac mini and a monitor, which I actually think is a

438
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:21,995
Speaker 5:  cheaper combo and works just as well. But setting this thing up

439
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:25,715
Speaker 5:  for them gave me like a real new understanding of why the

440
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:29,755
Speaker 5:  iMac is great. Yeah. Because I had to buy them a webcam. We had

441
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:33,555
Speaker 5:  to go through this whole crazy rigmarole with their keyboard because you

442
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:37,315
Speaker 5:  can't set up a Mac without a keyboard and you can't connect a keyboard without

443
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,315
Speaker 5:  setting up your Mac. So you need a wired keyboard, which no one has because

444
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:41,555
Speaker 5:  it's 2023. No way.

445
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:42,195
Speaker 3:  And that

446
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,655
Speaker 5:  Be right. I'm not a PC gamer. That's real. It's,

447
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:48,655
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It does not like Bluetooth. I always have to scramble.

448
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:52,015
Speaker 5:  The advice they give you on the internet is keep a wired keyboard around

449
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:54,615
Speaker 5:  just in case you have to set up a computer. Full chaos.

450
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,535
Speaker 5:  So I went through this whole thing and like, we eventually got it set up

451
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:00,415
Speaker 5:  and I was like, boy, it would've been really nice if I could've just like

452
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:02,975
Speaker 5:  pulled a thing out of a box, plugged it in and turned it.

453
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:07,655
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Look, I'm an iMac person, that's why. Yeah. Although

454
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:11,375
Speaker 3:  my iMac has all this stuff plugged into it, including an ancient flaky USB

455
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,015
Speaker 3:  audio interface that needs to be replaced. So

456
00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:13,815
Speaker 5:  You gotta buy a new Mac,

457
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,095
Speaker 3:  So I. Gotta buy a new Mac.

458
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:17,695
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's how you do it. It's called VERGE Logic right there. It,

459
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:20,815
Speaker 3:  It really makes a lot of sense when you think about it. I'm just gonna buy

460
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:24,375
Speaker 3:  like a 2017 iMac with USBC. This is my idea.

461
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:30,065
Speaker 3:  All. right. Let's talk about shot on iPhone for two minutes. Okay.

462
00:24:30,645 --> 00:24:34,265
Speaker 3:  So at the end of the event, apple puts up a label. It says shot on iPhone.

463
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:37,865
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I wanna, I I know why they're able to do this now. We will come to

464
00:24:37,865 --> 00:24:41,665
Speaker 3:  that. And then a little bit later they release some behind the scenes and

465
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:45,415
Speaker 3:  they show massive production. Like

466
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:46,175
Speaker 3:  cool, like cool

467
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:49,295
Speaker 4:  Stuff. Big lenses bolted to the front of iPhones and stuff like that. Yeah,

468
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:52,735
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Big lights, big lenses. You know, there's like drone shots and CGI,

469
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:56,495
Speaker 3:  it's a tv. They made a TV show. Yep. Apple is a TV company.

470
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:57,215
Speaker 3:  It's like a high

471
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:57,775
Speaker 5:  End one. They

472
00:24:57,775 --> 00:25:01,615
Speaker 3:  Made that, they made a TV show. Great. So we have a story that's like,

473
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:05,175
Speaker 3:  here's what they mean when I say shot on iPhone and the story, it contains

474
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:09,375
Speaker 3:  almost no take. There's I, I will get to it,

475
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:13,095
Speaker 3:  but it contains almost no take. It's just, here's all the stuff, here's the,

476
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:16,455
Speaker 3:  if you wanna do this, it costs us much money. People are freaking out that

477
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:20,335
Speaker 3:  we're like accusing Apple being liars. and it's like, no,

478
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:24,055
Speaker 3:  this is just at the end of the video. It doesn't show you the stuff. It's

479
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,935
Speaker 3:  just a shot on iPhone. Yeah. Yeah. And the very obvious thing that they want

480
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:31,755
Speaker 3:  you to think is that you can do this with an iPhone and then

481
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:33,635
Speaker 3:  it's cool. They show you behind the scenes of what you need to do if you

482
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:36,955
Speaker 3:  just wanna do an iPhone. They, and they did the same thing with Olivia Rodrigo,

483
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:40,955
Speaker 3:  right? She has a music video they shot on iPhone. They're running national

484
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:44,915
Speaker 3:  ads during football games showing the thing in a gimbal.

485
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:48,355
Speaker 3:  Like they're not hiding the ball. But shot on iPhone

486
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,915
Speaker 3:  is meant to make you feel good about the iPhone not

487
00:25:53,305 --> 00:25:57,275
Speaker 3:  make you consider the production. It it's

488
00:25:57,275 --> 00:26:01,075
Speaker 3:  just marketing. Yeah. I don't, I feel great about iPhones. I don't know,

489
00:26:02,355 --> 00:26:05,875
Speaker 3:  I I bear no ill will towards the iPhone because they put it in a gimbal.

490
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:11,115
Speaker 3:  But the point of it is like, look how cool the iPhone is. If

491
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:14,235
Speaker 3:  you had an iPhone, you too could be some combination of

492
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:18,885
Speaker 3:  Vampire Tim Cook and Olivia Rodrigo. That's how I feel every

493
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:19,845
Speaker 3:  time I pick up my phone. That's

494
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:20,645
Speaker 5:  The dream. Yeah. Yeah.

495
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:24,245
Speaker 3:  Whatever. I, I think people are upset about this

496
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:28,335
Speaker 3:  for like the, I'm smarter than you reason,

497
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:32,975
Speaker 3:  like You know it ins, like if you're a Verge reader, You know instinctively

498
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:36,655
Speaker 3:  that Apple has a lot of lights. Right. And when they shoot the thing on the

499
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:39,055
Speaker 3:  iPhone and the idea that other people would know that

500
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:43,460
Speaker 3:  and that would be surprising to them and make them feel feelings about Apple

501
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:46,925
Speaker 3:  just made a bunch of Apple people mad. That's like basically my summation

502
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:49,405
Speaker 3:  of this controversy, whatever. It's like

503
00:26:49,705 --> 00:26:52,725
Speaker 4:  All it did was make me realize that all of those shot on iPhone photos

504
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:54,245
Speaker 4:  might also

505
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:57,365
Speaker 3:  Have, have had lights. Have had lights and lights. So here's the thing you

506
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,805
Speaker 3:  can do. If you give me enough lights, I can make any camera look good.

507
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,005
Speaker 3:  Actually, not me. If you give Becca enough lights, you can make any

508
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:05,005
Speaker 5:  Yes.

509
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:09,365
Speaker 3:  That's great. Like, that's well known. Any person who has played with

510
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:13,285
Speaker 3:  photography knows like, give me enough lights and lenses and stuff. You

511
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:16,165
Speaker 3:  can pretty much make any camera look good. I think the reason they're able

512
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:19,405
Speaker 3:  to shot on iPhone with the iPhone 15 Pro Max or whatever is not

513
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:24,245
Speaker 3:  the camera system. It's that they can get the footage off the

514
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:28,045
Speaker 3:  phone at US BBC speeds. Yep. and it shoots in

515
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,765
Speaker 3:  log, which is software. I bet. I, I bet if Apple wanted to write a custom

516
00:27:31,765 --> 00:27:35,645
Speaker 3:  version of iOS that could shoot in log that could do it. But the 15 can now

517
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:39,305
Speaker 3:  do it for everybody and it has a, the

518
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:43,385
Speaker 3:  hardware capability of getting the footage off the phone. And so

519
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:45,705
Speaker 3:  these are two things that are very important for pros and apple's shutting

520
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,545
Speaker 3:  off. Like, look, this sensor and this thing, and the the thing is good enough

521
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:53,785
Speaker 3:  where you can replace a professional camera in some context if you have enough

522
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:57,345
Speaker 3:  lights and professional things. But that's like a very hard thing to communicate.

523
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,985
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like we, we've changed the port to USBC,

524
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:04,665
Speaker 3:  so now you can shoot a professional production on the phone and you don't

525
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:08,545
Speaker 3:  have to wait six days to get the files off the phone. I would say

526
00:28:08,545 --> 00:28:12,505
Speaker 3:  not the world's greatest marketing message shot an iPhone. Very good.

527
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:12,985
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

528
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:17,385
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think to me the, the challenge is always that when we talk about

529
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:21,905
Speaker 5:  smartphone shooting, it's, it's kind of

530
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:25,865
Speaker 5:  two different things that actually are totally different, but

531
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:28,505
Speaker 5:  everybody kind of wants to have the best of both worlds. So on the one side

532
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:31,785
Speaker 5:  you have something like this, which is like a very high-end production. And

533
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:35,545
Speaker 5:  basically all they did was take out a

534
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:39,425
Speaker 5:  fancy camera. Like they, they took out a Cannon camera and put in an iPhone.

535
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:43,465
Speaker 5:  Otherwise, the whole setup is essentially the same. And that's actually what

536
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:46,025
Speaker 5:  they say in the behind the scenes videos that one of the coolest things about

537
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:49,225
Speaker 5:  it is how little of the process they had to change. They can still see the

538
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:51,425
Speaker 5:  footage and all their monitors, they can still do the stuff in real time.

539
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:54,985
Speaker 5:  They can get all the stuff that they need, like plug and play

540
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:58,105
Speaker 5:  into an otherwise very expensive professional setup is one side of thing.

541
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:01,705
Speaker 5:  Right. The other thing we talk about with smartphone photos and video is

542
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:05,505
Speaker 5:  that it lets you do stuff you couldn't do otherwise. Right. Like, I remember

543
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:08,305
Speaker 5:  Anthony Bourdain's team used to talk about this, that like when they started

544
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:12,345
Speaker 5:  shooting with iPhones and restaurants instead of big TV cameras,

545
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:16,465
Speaker 5:  it changed the vibe and you can just get places you couldn't otherwise.

546
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:19,425
Speaker 5:  Like nature photographers talk about this too, that like, you can get up

547
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,745
Speaker 5:  close to things with a phone in a way that you can't with a giant camera,

548
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:24,785
Speaker 5:  with a giant lens. And so we have this idea that when we say things like

549
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:29,265
Speaker 5:  shot on iPhone, the the mental image is like a person holding a phone

550
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:33,185
Speaker 5:  up in front of their face. That's obviously not how It works. Like

551
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:37,265
Speaker 5:  no professional anything is actually shot that way. But

552
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,945
Speaker 5:  the mental image that I think Apple and everyone else wants you to have when

553
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,765
Speaker 5:  you, you think about that is that it's essentially Tim Cook standing there

554
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:48,125
Speaker 5:  and like, I don't know Craig Federighi standing there just like standing

555
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:48,925
Speaker 4:  His eyes on me. Tim,

556
00:29:50,465 --> 00:29:53,205
Speaker 5:  If you think about it for one and a half seconds. Yeah. That's obviously

557
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:54,645
Speaker 5:  not what's going on. But like, and

558
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:57,655
Speaker 3:  This is what I'm saying, I think this is what people are, they're like mad

559
00:29:57,655 --> 00:30:01,575
Speaker 3:  about is they've thought about it. And sometimes when

560
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:04,455
Speaker 3:  other people learn something, a reaction of people on the internet is to

561
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:05,335
Speaker 3:  get very mad about that.

562
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:08,855
Speaker 4:  I mean, I do that anytime someone says, have you heard of this film? Yeah.

563
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:10,415
Speaker 4:  I get so annoying.

564
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:12,055
Speaker 3:  It's just, it's just weird. It's like, yeah,

565
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:12,975
Speaker 5:  I've heard of all the films,

566
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:14,055
Speaker 4:  Every film

567
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:17,175
Speaker 3:  I, it's, I I think it's very human. I'm not blaming anybody for this reaction.

568
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:20,975
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I'm just saying, I think I, I'm identifying a thing that is happening

569
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:25,295
Speaker 3:  that has nothing to do with whether marketing all aligns the difference between

570
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:29,415
Speaker 3:  a professional camera shoot and Craig Federighi holding up. Like of course

571
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:32,975
Speaker 3:  the marketing elides the difference between those two things. It's an ad

572
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,655
Speaker 3:  like I'm, yeah, it's the richest company in the world is making ads like,

573
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,095
Speaker 3:  duh,

574
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:42,855
Speaker 4:  I really want Craig to shoot the next iPhone keynote. Just only

575
00:30:42,855 --> 00:30:43,015
Speaker 4:  Craig.

576
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:45,735
Speaker 3:  He's just, he's just chasing Olivia Rodrigo around while she crashes Cars

577
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:51,095
Speaker 3:  in a vampire outfit. All. right? That's that. Whatever you can feel however

578
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,975
Speaker 3:  you want. I hope you enjoy your iPhone. Please shoot more music videos and

579
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:56,855
Speaker 3:  send 'em to us. Olivia

580
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:57,495
Speaker 4:  Rodrigo,

581
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,735
Speaker 3:  The other group of people that was really mad at us this week that I mentioned

582
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:04,615
Speaker 3:  in at the top of the show was SEO professionals who, again, I really

583
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:08,495
Speaker 3:  encourage you to one, go read our piece by a man of Chicago Lewis about the

584
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:12,455
Speaker 3:  culture of SEO, which no one ever writes about. And we can get to

585
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:16,015
Speaker 3:  the piece, but then read the comments from the angry SEO people because the

586
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:19,975
Speaker 3:  comments are some of the best formatted, most, or like,

587
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:23,095
Speaker 3:  if they could have put h twos in the comments for better search discoverability,

588
00:31:23,285 --> 00:31:23,975
Speaker 3:  they would have.

589
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:28,815
Speaker 3:  It is amazing. The keywords are impeccable. It is. The funniest thing about

590
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:31,775
Speaker 3:  this whole situation is the SEO professionals being mad at us, but doing

591
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:35,615
Speaker 3:  perfect SEO by instinct in all of the places where they're yelling at us.

592
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:40,095
Speaker 3:  Ah, chef's Kiss. So we have this big package all year. It's been the

593
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:44,015
Speaker 3:  running theme of our year. If you care about AI and

594
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:47,295
Speaker 3:  you think AI is transformative, which I, I think a lot of people do, and

595
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:50,615
Speaker 3:  you are looking at the canon of c plus AI

596
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:54,535
Speaker 3:  generated content that is being fired at every platform in the world.

597
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:58,495
Speaker 3:  You're like, oh boy, the web's gonna be weird. Oh boy, what's Google

598
00:31:58,505 --> 00:32:02,295
Speaker 3:  gonna do? What's Google gonna do when it starts doing more of the

599
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,175
Speaker 3:  generated answers instead of just 10 blue links? What's Apple gonna do

600
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:10,015
Speaker 3:  when Google starts doing that? And their search revenue deal changes in

601
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,975
Speaker 3:  big ways. Like if you, if you undo search in any way,

602
00:32:14,555 --> 00:32:18,375
Speaker 3:  the knock on effects are gigantic. It is the architecture of the

603
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,175
Speaker 3:  web. So we're just like writing about it.

604
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,055
Speaker 5:  Did we talk about the melting egg thing? No. On this show yet? Did you guys

605
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:26,735
Speaker 5:  see this? This is just the tiniest little version of this thing and it's,

606
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:30,335
Speaker 5:  it's just my favorite. So Quora, the question and answer

607
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:34,255
Speaker 5:  website has been doing work with AI generated

608
00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:37,695
Speaker 5:  answers to people's questions. It's possible that I'm misremembering this,

609
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:41,085
Speaker 5:  but I don't think so. There was a question on Quora that said, can you melt

610
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:44,735
Speaker 5:  an egg? And so chat

611
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:48,495
Speaker 5:  GPT through Quora answered, yes, you can melt an egg, which you

612
00:32:48,495 --> 00:32:52,175
Speaker 5:  obviously cannot Google indexes Quora

613
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:56,095
Speaker 5:  because it's a higher ranking site full of good user generated content. So

614
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:59,855
Speaker 5:  now if you Google, can you melt an egg? Google says yes, you can melt an

615
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:03,375
Speaker 5:  egg even though that's not true. So then a bunch of news outlets pick up

616
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:07,135
Speaker 5:  this story about being able to melt an egg, which feeds more data back

617
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:11,215
Speaker 5:  into these generative systems. And so now there's all kinds of data

618
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:14,975
Speaker 5:  on the internet in which phrases like you can melt an egg exist

619
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:19,015
Speaker 5:  on high ranking websites. And so we got to the point where the question

620
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:23,375
Speaker 5:  can you melt an egg became like absolute certainty to Google

621
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:27,455
Speaker 5:  through all of the signals that at once about how things should work. Because

622
00:33:27,595 --> 00:33:29,895
Speaker 5:  one little tiny AI system said so

623
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:30,695
Speaker 3:  They fixed it.

624
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:33,655
Speaker 5:  They have fixed it since. But that's like, there are going to be, I, I

625
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:34,455
Speaker 4:  Don't know if they

626
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:36,335
Speaker 5:  Did literally an infinity of examples like that because

627
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:39,495
Speaker 4:  I just Googled it and apparently the most common way to melt an egg is to

628
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:43,295
Speaker 4:  heat it using a stove or microwave. That's from

629
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:46,255
Speaker 4:  t nnn support.com.

630
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:47,575
Speaker 3:  It's good trusted

631
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:48,495
Speaker 4:  Source for egg

632
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:52,335
Speaker 3:  Melting. Okay. So if you, good, good example everyone,

633
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:54,175
Speaker 3:  we did it.

634
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:59,935
Speaker 3:  If you think that these things are worth talking about, you

635
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:03,655
Speaker 3:  might direct your resources at covering the present state of Google

636
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:08,055
Speaker 3:  and the web and how we got here. Google search so that you might

637
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:12,615
Speaker 3:  be better positioned to cover what happens next, which appears

638
00:34:13,035 --> 00:34:15,455
Speaker 3:  to be a snake eating its tail of melted eggs.

639
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:17,095
Speaker 4:  Delicious.

640
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,815
Speaker 5:  Pretty soon we will all be melting eggs thanks to Google.

641
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:23,735
Speaker 3:  These are just crazy outcomes. Right. And they're culture shaping outcomes.

642
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,975
Speaker 3:  A real reason that the flat earth conspiracy has as much

643
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:32,335
Speaker 3:  traction as it does is because every time another NBA player

644
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:36,175
Speaker 3:  says they believe in a flat earth conspiracy, people Google it

645
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,615
Speaker 3:  and then a million websites see that in Google Trends and they write about

646
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:43,615
Speaker 3:  flat earth stuff. Yep. And that is just a feedback loop

647
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:47,495
Speaker 3:  that has made more people be like, flat Earth is a reasonable debate

648
00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:50,535
Speaker 3:  to have because I see it in the information ecosystem.

649
00:34:51,115 --> 00:34:52,055
Speaker 4:  People are stupid.

650
00:34:52,065 --> 00:34:54,615
Speaker 3:  We've written that story. We'll put it in the show notes. So it was just

651
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:58,335
Speaker 3:  one of the weirdest things. I was like, I'm go explain how search made the

652
00:34:58,335 --> 00:35:01,105
Speaker 3:  flat earth happening. and it, we did,

653
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:03,825
Speaker 4:  It's kind of weird that people forgot that the Google bomb exists.

654
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:06,865
Speaker 3:  So we wrote that story. So in our package, right? Yeah. We wrote an entire

655
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:10,665
Speaker 3:  story about how the culture, our broader pop culture for a minute,

656
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:15,465
Speaker 3:  the algorithm at the center of it was the Google search algorithm. Ryan

657
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:18,105
Speaker 3:  Broder wrote that story for us. Yeah. And now the algorithm at the center

658
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:21,305
Speaker 3:  of the culture is the TikTok algorithm. Maybe three years ago the, the algorithm

659
00:35:21,305 --> 00:35:24,985
Speaker 3:  at the center of the culture was the YouTube algorithm. There's a brief enduring

660
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:28,905
Speaker 3:  moment where it's the Instagram algorithm that provided you the

661
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:32,585
Speaker 3:  Kardashians just you open Instagram. It's like, do you, here's another one.

662
00:35:32,985 --> 00:35:34,145
Speaker 4:  I just watched them on E

663
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:39,035
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But the, the E But they, they were like masters of one platform.

664
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:41,675
Speaker 3:  They haven't jumped to another. That's true. Right. And it's just, I think

665
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:45,035
Speaker 3:  it's important to look at the search algorithm and say this thing once ran

666
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:48,395
Speaker 3:  the culture, it's still how information is organized around the world.

667
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:50,955
Speaker 3:  Everyone writes to it.

668
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:55,195
Speaker 4:  I mean, I think about SEO like it's not my Roman empire, but it's up

669
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:55,395
Speaker 4:  there.

670
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:59,155
Speaker 3:  What a phrase. See that's a, that's a TikTok phrase. Yep.

671
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:03,355
Speaker 3:  The algorithm at the center of the culture is, is it's ever changing, but

672
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:06,195
Speaker 3:  you can almost always identify it. So writing all these pieces, we'll link

673
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:09,635
Speaker 3:  to all of them. Last week we had a piece about restaurants naming themselves

674
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:13,395
Speaker 3:  near me. Mia wrote it. It's incredible. It's great. Thai food near me is

675
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,955
Speaker 3:  a real restaurant you can go to in New York. Food's actually quite good.

676
00:36:16,115 --> 00:36:18,715
Speaker 3:  Mia says, so we'll link to that. We've got a bunch of these this week it

677
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:22,675
Speaker 3:  was Amanda Chicago, Lewis writing about the culture of people who practice

678
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:26,035
Speaker 3:  SEO, not technical SEO tips

679
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:31,035
Speaker 3:  of which this piece contained none. I and I,

680
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:35,155
Speaker 3:  everyone's like responding to it as though this is how to do SEO.

681
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:39,155
Speaker 3:  No, no, no. This is a piece about the, the culture of the people

682
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,435
Speaker 3:  who practice it professionally and the conferences they go to and how they

683
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:43,035
Speaker 3:  talk about Google

684
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:46,075
Speaker 4:  And a five and a half foot long alligator

685
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:49,475
Speaker 3:  Into five and the conferences they go in Florida. Yeah. Generally Florida

686
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:53,395
Speaker 3:  is a concept, is in this piece quite a lot. And, what is, I would

687
00:36:53,395 --> 00:36:57,115
Speaker 3:  just point out to everyone, this is like a well-known thing you can do.

688
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,555
Speaker 3:  You can say we're sitting in the financial district in New York. I would

689
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:03,675
Speaker 3:  like to write a piece about the culture of finance. Pros is like a real thing

690
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:07,795
Speaker 3:  many magazines do all the time because they, they're

691
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:08,635
Speaker 3:  cartoonish and then

692
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:11,795
Speaker 4:  They make movies about it and they star Leonardo DiCaprio And

693
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:15,675
Speaker 3:  True. And very rarely do the movies contain technical

694
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:18,915
Speaker 3:  explanations of what the finance pros are doing all day long. How to do finance.

695
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:24,035
Speaker 3:  You can, right. Like many television shows are about the culture

696
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:27,855
Speaker 3:  of being a lawyer. Very rarely does suits

697
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:31,855
Speaker 3:  ever get any part of the law. Right? I can't watch this show. It's so bad.

698
00:37:32,765 --> 00:37:35,975
Speaker 3:  It's everywhere. The algorithms just want to make me watch the

699
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:36,535
Speaker 4:  Torres

700
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:40,775
Speaker 3:  It. But this is just a thing, right? The the culture of a profession is

701
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:44,655
Speaker 3:  a reasonable thing to write about. Yeah. So our piece is about the culture

702
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:47,815
Speaker 3:  of the profession and like how they feel about

703
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:52,695
Speaker 3:  doing a thing that scammers do to make money and that other people do

704
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:56,255
Speaker 3:  to just get you to go to their doctor's office or whatever. Right. Piece

705
00:37:56,275 --> 00:38:00,095
Speaker 3:  is great. and it is, it's a bunch of characters because

706
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,815
Speaker 3:  the people who are best at SEO make a lot of money and they have

707
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:07,015
Speaker 3:  silly cars and they buy alligators for their conferences

708
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:11,575
Speaker 3:  and they're just loud characters. And one of the central points of this

709
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:15,375
Speaker 3:  story is the guy at Google who used to sort of manage the SEO

710
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:18,495
Speaker 3:  industry. It was a guy named Matt Cots who talked to us for the story. Matt

711
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:22,135
Speaker 3:  has been outta Google forever. He went to the US digital service under

712
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:25,615
Speaker 3:  Barack Obama. So he was in the government, he was ACTO, I think the USTS

713
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:30,135
Speaker 3:  and Google to replace him. Hired a whole bunch of people. One

714
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:32,135
Speaker 3:  of those people was a guy named Danny Sullivan. Danny Sullivan used to be

715
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,740
Speaker 3:  a journalist. He ran a site called Search Engine Land. I used to be a regular

716
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,565
Speaker 3:  reader of search engine land. Now he's a guy who works at Google and sort

717
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:41,585
Speaker 3:  of interfaces with people who wanna do SEO.

718
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:45,985
Speaker 3:  The people in our story are like, things changed when one guy left and another

719
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:49,735
Speaker 3:  guy came in, which is a totally reasonable thing to say, right? The

720
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:53,215
Speaker 3:  posture of the company changed when this sort of ad hoc guy

721
00:38:53,715 --> 00:38:57,015
Speaker 3:  in 2009 was doing it. And then he left and they built an entire function

722
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,295
Speaker 3:  to replace him in the face of that function. Is this guy,

723
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,975
Speaker 3:  Danny's been doing this a long time. I, I think

724
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:07,175
Speaker 3:  having, I know a lot of people who have reported on search, we've done a

725
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:11,055
Speaker 3:  lot of stories about search. I think the scrutiny of Search And

726
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:14,815
Speaker 3:  what it is and how It works is frustrating to people at Google

727
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:18,495
Speaker 3:  who are in general idealistic about what it should do.

728
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:22,975
Speaker 3:  Right? There's a trial like David this week published the list of

729
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:26,695
Speaker 3:  the, was it top 10 most lucrative search terms in 2018?

730
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:31,215
Speaker 3:  Yep. And the idea that search has a deeply commercial business

731
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:34,895
Speaker 3:  really rankles Google, but it is their entire business.

732
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:38,375
Speaker 5:  I don't think that's true. No, I don't like, I actually don't think Google

733
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:42,495
Speaker 5:  is like afraid of the idea that it makes money from search. Like I

734
00:39:42,695 --> 00:39:45,455
Speaker 5:  actually think that that's one step too far. I think what Google believes

735
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:48,375
Speaker 5:  earnestly, like at its corporate center

736
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:53,175
Speaker 5:  is that what's good for Google is good for the web. Yeah. Yes.

737
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:56,775
Speaker 5:  And by making Google better and giving more people more access to Google,

738
00:39:57,035 --> 00:40:00,855
Speaker 5:  Google has made the web better. Like Sundar just said that in court

739
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:04,655
Speaker 5:  this week. I genuinely believe that that is a thing that Google as a

740
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:08,415
Speaker 5:  company believes. And so for us to come in and say

741
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:12,575
Speaker 5:  essentially that what you've done is you've created a game to be won

742
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:16,015
Speaker 5:  And. what everybody is doing is doing these things in order to win it. And

743
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:18,855
Speaker 5:  by doing so, they're ruining the internet. Essentially what we're saying

744
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:22,295
Speaker 5:  to Google is like, and I I I think it's true. I think you look at the internet

745
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,215
Speaker 5:  and it is like proably true at this point. But what we're saying is Google,

746
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:29,615
Speaker 5:  by trying to grow Google, you've not only grown the web, you've re

747
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:33,095
Speaker 5:  incentivized the web Yep. To make it worse in order to serve

748
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:34,095
Speaker 5:  you better.

749
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:38,135
Speaker 3:  Right. If I was to say to you, how do you win the Instagram algorithm?

750
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:42,015
Speaker 3:  You have a mental model in your head. Yeah. Absent reels or whatever. But

751
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:45,375
Speaker 3:  like in that, in the moment of Instagram's greatest power, you have a mental

752
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:49,295
Speaker 3:  model of how that incentive structure worked. If I was to say to you,

753
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:52,135
Speaker 3:  how do you win the TikTok algorithm, you may or may not have a mental model.

754
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:56,255
Speaker 3:  How do you win the Logan Paul era YouTube

755
00:40:56,805 --> 00:41:00,375
Speaker 3:  algorithm? You probably have a mental model, right? It's not a good one,

756
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,935
Speaker 3:  but Yeah. But it's there, right? Like you do a bunch of pranks with your

757
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:07,815
Speaker 3:  Bross, like it, whatever, all those things change and they come and go.

758
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:11,095
Speaker 3:  But the idea that there's an algorithm that can be gamed, people try to game

759
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:14,255
Speaker 3:  it, that leads to a type of content or a culture of those creators.

760
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:18,815
Speaker 3:  When we go talk to the platform companies, the idea that we're doing a story

761
00:41:18,815 --> 00:41:22,695
Speaker 3:  like this never surprises them. It never rankles them and ever irritates

762
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:25,695
Speaker 3:  them. It's just the thing that we do. Right? When you, when we have been

763
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:29,575
Speaker 3:  going to do it with search, Hey, you, there's an algorithm that creates

764
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,775
Speaker 3:  a bunch of incentives and there's a bunch of creators out there who are trying

765
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:35,445
Speaker 3:  to game the algorithm. And that means the culture of the web and the content

766
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:38,165
Speaker 3:  we create looks like it responds to your incentives.

767
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:41,205
Speaker 3:  That's where I think Google is very frustrated.

768
00:41:41,225 --> 00:41:43,725
Speaker 5:  Oh, I think that's right. Yeah. I think because I think what Google would

769
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:46,565
Speaker 5:  tell you is that it is designed to reflect

770
00:41:47,665 --> 00:41:51,165
Speaker 5:  the best of the web. Yeah. And in reality, what it did was decide what the

771
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,845
Speaker 5:  best of the web is and then force everyone into that specific

772
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:55,165
Speaker 5:  box.

773
00:41:55,255 --> 00:41:59,205
Speaker 3:  Right. And the particular thing that Danny

774
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:02,405
Speaker 3:  read our piece, he doesn't like it because he is characterized as being somewhat

775
00:42:02,405 --> 00:42:06,245
Speaker 3:  unhappy with our reporter on the piece. And we link to Danny's

776
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:09,525
Speaker 3:  response on, on the homepage. You can read that too. But where he and I have

777
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:13,745
Speaker 3:  been going back on, on threads is Google

778
00:42:13,755 --> 00:42:17,505
Speaker 3:  keeps saying, we publish all of these guidelines and we tell

779
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:21,265
Speaker 3:  people not to do the things that the guidelines don't say. Like the response

780
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:23,905
Speaker 3:  to every one of our pieces about Google search this year has been, that's

781
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:24,785
Speaker 3:  not what the guidelines say,

782
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:26,025
Speaker 4:  Which is just

783
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:30,265
Speaker 3:  Thousands of pages. And then also in the next breath, they're like, the best

784
00:42:30,265 --> 00:42:31,625
Speaker 3:  thing to do is not read the guidelines.

785
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:33,105
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Just make great content. Just

786
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:35,345
Speaker 3:  Make great stuff. And it's like, well, why do you publish all these guidelines?

787
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:39,345
Speaker 3:  Right. If you don't want anyone to read them. And there's a real tension

788
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:42,985
Speaker 3:  in there. Like if you are a person who builds a website, our

789
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:46,945
Speaker 3:  website, a lot of the schema of our website is designed for

790
00:42:46,945 --> 00:42:50,385
Speaker 3:  Google. Like the, the underpinning of the layouts of our pages

791
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:55,345
Speaker 3:  are designed to be predictable for Google. Okay. Like, I don't

792
00:42:55,455 --> 00:42:59,385
Speaker 3:  feel bad about that. I, I want our stuff to be searchable and discoverable,

793
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:02,985
Speaker 3:  but I also don't want us to write headlines for the Google search robot.

794
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:06,625
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I want us to write headlines for people. And like, there's a real tension

795
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:10,705
Speaker 3:  there. And one of the things that makes that tension worse, I think for on

796
00:43:10,705 --> 00:43:13,305
Speaker 3:  the web in general is Google

797
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:18,485
Speaker 3:  doesn't like recognize that tension exists. So when the people, when

798
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:21,245
Speaker 3:  scammers write headlines to fool Google, they win. Right. Or when

799
00:43:21,325 --> 00:43:25,285
Speaker 4:  A company I like, like we see this a lot in, in our industry and every

800
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:28,605
Speaker 4:  elsewhere. I think we all think about SEO a lot. And that is one of the reasons

801
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:32,285
Speaker 4:  this story means a lot to people at The Verge is because we have to think

802
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:35,885
Speaker 4:  about SEO. It's important and we have to think, okay, well how far do we

803
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:39,325
Speaker 4:  go? How, how, how. Because there is that way where you can win the web. Yeah.

804
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:42,845
Speaker 4:  And you can show, prove everyone that you can melt an egg. We

805
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:45,925
Speaker 3:  Are six months away from one of our major competitors

806
00:43:46,965 --> 00:43:48,925
Speaker 3:  emerging is like a totally AI written content

807
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:49,765
Speaker 4:  Form. Exactly.

808
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,165
Speaker 3:  I i I feel it in my bones that that is the thing we'll compete against with

809
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:54,765
Speaker 3:  next year for search traffic. Yep.

810
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:57,605
Speaker 4:  And, and I mean that, that's exactly what's happening. We're seeing our major

811
00:43:57,605 --> 00:44:01,165
Speaker 4:  competitors go down that road after we already watch them go and do things

812
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:05,285
Speaker 4:  like You know say, Hey, check out the hands-on for the new iPhone

813
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:08,885
Speaker 4:  15 Pro two weeks before it was announced. Just so they can

814
00:44:08,885 --> 00:44:11,845
Speaker 3:  Gain Wait, can can we just do some SEO scam rundowns? Yeah. Our competitors

815
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:15,125
Speaker 3:  have, real competitors have done. Yes. So the, the one Alex is talking about,

816
00:44:15,305 --> 00:44:18,965
Speaker 3:  we have a lot of competitors who a month before a device, any devices

817
00:44:19,645 --> 00:44:21,365
Speaker 3:  released, they will put up a page

818
00:44:21,665 --> 00:44:25,245
Speaker 4:  And it's a hands-on page. It's basically a holding page. The headline at

819
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,045
Speaker 4:  the top, a lot of the copy is about the hands-on. And then it'll be like,

820
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:30,125
Speaker 4:  come back on this day to check it out.

821
00:44:30,675 --> 00:44:34,165
Speaker 3:  This is just an SEO game. Like I, I think that's Fake. And now we have covered

822
00:44:34,165 --> 00:44:37,925
Speaker 3:  this a lot too. We have big competitors like Geo

823
00:44:37,935 --> 00:44:41,845
Speaker 3:  Media and CNET and others who are running trials of AI generated

824
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,565
Speaker 3:  content. And their staffs are furious about this. They're not happy. The,

825
00:44:45,565 --> 00:44:47,845
Speaker 3:  the people who make the work are not happy about this, but the corporations

826
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:50,925
Speaker 3:  are doing it and they all say the same excuse, which is, we have to learn

827
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:54,045
Speaker 3:  how to use this stuff. And it's like you're learning nothing. Yeah. What

828
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:54,485
Speaker 3:  have you learned?

829
00:44:54,635 --> 00:44:57,685
Speaker 5:  Well, the other one, I think my, my guess would be one a lot of people have

830
00:44:57,685 --> 00:45:01,045
Speaker 5:  encountered is when you search for some kind of coupons on the internet,

831
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:05,205
Speaker 5:  the number of sites that you would not expect to have a sneaky hidden

832
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:09,365
Speaker 5:  coupons page for Bed Bath and Beyond that nevertheless has a sneaky hidden

833
00:45:09,385 --> 00:45:12,405
Speaker 5:  coupon page for Bed Bath and Beyond is like alarming.

834
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:15,005
Speaker 3:  And it's, I just look, I just bought a solo stuff. I took the coupon right

835
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:18,605
Speaker 3:  from wire.com. There you go. That was a totally weird experience, but I was

836
00:45:18,605 --> 00:45:19,565
Speaker 3:  like, I'm supporting my friends.

837
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:21,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's, I mean, this is a thing we've talked about a lot on this

838
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:23,925
Speaker 5:  show, right? There is like a, there's an internet for humans and there's

839
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:27,885
Speaker 5:  an internet for robots and Google is the robots. Yeah. Like

840
00:45:27,885 --> 00:45:31,725
Speaker 5:  it's, it's AI is becoming the robots, but Google has been the robots

841
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:35,605
Speaker 5:  for a really long time and it has demanded a lot of people's time and energy

842
00:45:36,395 --> 00:45:39,965
Speaker 5:  because at the end of it, it's the discovery engine for the internet.

843
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:44,165
Speaker 5:  And Google, like really would love you to believe what they always say,

844
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:48,045
Speaker 5:  which is just do good stuff and we'll help people find it. And I think

845
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,765
Speaker 5:  anyone who has ever tried to do good stuff on the internet can tell you it's

846
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:53,645
Speaker 5:  not, it's just not nearly that simple. Yeah.

847
00:45:53,945 --> 00:45:57,485
Speaker 3:  Anyway, so that's the dispute. You can all evaluate the

848
00:45:57,495 --> 00:46:01,325
Speaker 3:  disclosure. We have a website. There are people at our

849
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,845
Speaker 3:  company that professionally do SEO. Yeah.

850
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,445
Speaker 5:  And if you Google things, you might find our website. Yeah.

851
00:46:06,505 --> 00:46:09,845
Speaker 3:  Our, our website is designed to be surfaced in Google search. I I think about,

852
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:12,125
Speaker 3:  oh, there's one part. Can I, can I tell this story? Sorry. Yeah. Sorry,

853
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:15,765
Speaker 4:  I didn't mean to No, no, no. I was just gonna say, I love SEO. I, I want

854
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:16,725
Speaker 4:  people to read my stuff.

855
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:20,845
Speaker 3:  All, right? Maybe not that far. Maybe, maybe Alex is like running chat. Bt

856
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:22,205
Speaker 3:  in the corner to replace us all.

857
00:46:23,725 --> 00:46:27,645
Speaker 3:  There's one, Danny calls out when we were redesigning the site. He

858
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:31,565
Speaker 3:  says, Neil, I emailed me and wanted to know about some SEO question, which

859
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:34,085
Speaker 3:  is true. I emailed him and said, we're gonna have these quick posts. We're

860
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:37,805
Speaker 3:  redoing this thing. Our internal SEO team we're having a debate about whether

861
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:41,645
Speaker 3:  to index the quick posts. This is a true thing. I say, Danny is the search

862
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:44,045
Speaker 3:  liaison. I know him. I emailed him and said, Hey, I've got this question.

863
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:48,605
Speaker 3:  And he was, he was like this, read the guidelines that's what Danny said,

864
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,685
Speaker 3:  which is the thing that he is supposed to do. Yeah. Professionally, what

865
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:54,885
Speaker 3:  he says to everybody is read the guidelines, no special treatment for anyone.

866
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,925
Speaker 3:  And I was like, I don't think the guidelines are helping me here because

867
00:46:57,925 --> 00:47:01,645
Speaker 3:  they are designed to tell people who spam affiliate links not.

868
00:47:01,645 --> 00:47:04,965
Speaker 3:  They'll get down ranked and our quick posts aren't that, but they're also

869
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:08,925
Speaker 3:  very short and like the folk wisdom of SEO is that short things are bad.

870
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:11,085
Speaker 3:  You know, like there's all this stuff and we just Don the answer. And his

871
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:14,885
Speaker 3:  answer was like, do what's best. Great. Like that I, that's a totally,

872
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:17,645
Speaker 3:  I presume a totally reasonable interaction.

873
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,785
Speaker 3:  And then we didn't index the quick post because we didn't want to tank the

874
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:25,145
Speaker 3:  traffic to our other pages by having something that might be whatever. Okay.

875
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:28,585
Speaker 3:  That's like a normal sort of like business conversation that you might have.

876
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:32,885
Speaker 3:  We didn't have any terms, it was just advice. Right? Like I'm

877
00:47:33,355 --> 00:47:37,165
Speaker 3:  operating to the search liaison. It's not a commercial conversation. It's

878
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:40,405
Speaker 3:  not the wrong side of the house. And I know Danny, so

879
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:44,725
Speaker 3:  he calls us up as if to say like us caring

880
00:47:44,855 --> 00:47:48,605
Speaker 3:  about SEO somehow negates us from criticizing the

881
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:49,525
Speaker 3:  practice of SEO.

882
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:53,565
Speaker 4:  In fact it makes us more like qualified

883
00:47:53,945 --> 00:47:56,805
Speaker 4:  to critique it. I feel much more qualified than Yeah. We like

884
00:47:56,805 --> 00:47:57,205
Speaker 3:  Do the thing.

885
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like I do it all the time. I'm feeling very

886
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:01,805
Speaker 3:  Qualified also and and we have a lot of commenters who are like, but you

887
00:48:01,805 --> 00:48:04,645
Speaker 3:  have yeah. Posts that I want, we want you to reads,

888
00:48:04,645 --> 00:48:05,245
Speaker 4:  Read our website.

889
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:09,205
Speaker 3:  Do you want you to read our website but also just like, just turn the knob

890
00:48:09,205 --> 00:48:12,685
Speaker 3:  all the way. I will concede that we are the worst SEO scammers on the internet.

891
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:17,365
Speaker 3:  The worst we're gonna find you and we're gonna sell you some car insurance

892
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:20,565
Speaker 3:  tomorrow. You looking for a wireless plan?

893
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:25,845
Speaker 3:  Get that solo student. That would be great if we sold wireless plants. We're

894
00:48:25,845 --> 00:48:26,725
Speaker 3:  like don't buy any of them.

895
00:48:28,795 --> 00:48:30,605
Speaker 3:  None of these will let you do surgery on a grape.

896
00:48:32,825 --> 00:48:36,525
Speaker 3:  It, I'll concede it to you all the way. That doesn't change the idea that

897
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:40,165
Speaker 3:  people who practice SEO have a culture anyway. You can tell that I care about

898
00:48:40,165 --> 00:48:42,565
Speaker 3:  this a lot. Yeah. David, I wanna come back to a thing that you said real

899
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:46,455
Speaker 3:  quick and then we can wrap this up. Like Google doesn't care. If you think

900
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:49,455
Speaker 3:  about search for the business, you were in the courtroom this week

901
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:54,325
Speaker 3:  where literally the CEO of Google was talking about Google search

902
00:48:54,345 --> 00:48:57,645
Speaker 3:  as a business, And what it means and how It works in this big deal with Apple.

903
00:48:58,465 --> 00:48:59,325
Speaker 3:  What's going on there?

904
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:03,885
Speaker 5:  It was really interesting 'cause the deal with Apple has been

905
00:49:04,305 --> 00:49:07,765
Speaker 5:  the story of this trial so far. Like fundamentally, if you really wanna boil

906
00:49:07,795 --> 00:49:11,645
Speaker 5:  this entire antitrust trial down to one question, it's

907
00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:16,325
Speaker 5:  is it anti-competitive for Google to give Apple what

908
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:20,205
Speaker 5:  we now know to be $18 billion a year in order

909
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:23,125
Speaker 5:  to be the default search engine in Safari? Like that's it. That's the whole

910
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:26,605
Speaker 5:  question. Because even if that one deal goes away,

911
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:31,165
Speaker 5:  everyone else testifying is saying that blows the search market

912
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,965
Speaker 5:  wide open. But so sooner Petre gave this like long

913
00:49:35,345 --> 00:49:39,125
Speaker 5:  mostly uns spicy testimony. Like Satya Nadella was very spicy,

914
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:44,555
Speaker 5:  Sundar less spicy. But essentially what he argued over

915
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:48,235
Speaker 5:  and over is that like Google is a business, it's a

916
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:52,115
Speaker 5:  competitive business. There are a lot of things out there. Part of Google's

917
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:55,795
Speaker 5:  line is that like everyone is coming for search all the time. Provo Raghavan

918
00:49:55,795 --> 00:49:59,755
Speaker 5:  who runs search for Google, talked a lot about TikTok and vertical search

919
00:49:59,755 --> 00:50:02,635
Speaker 5:  engines and this idea that like people look for information in lots of places

920
00:50:02,775 --> 00:50:05,555
Speaker 5:  and that's fundamentally what Google does. It's very competitive on and on.

921
00:50:06,055 --> 00:50:09,915
Speaker 5:  And sooner Pro I just kept saying, look, we give all these companies

922
00:50:09,915 --> 00:50:13,515
Speaker 5:  all this money because it's it, it makes us more money.

923
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:17,995
Speaker 5:  And like it's just that simple. Like Google wouldn't give Apple

924
00:50:18,555 --> 00:50:22,075
Speaker 5:  $18 billion a year if Google didn't make more than

925
00:50:22,275 --> 00:50:26,195
Speaker 5:  $18 billion a year as a result. Right? Like John sch fit line, the

926
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:30,125
Speaker 5:  the lawyer for Google asked him about like, you have a fiduciary duty to

927
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,885
Speaker 5:  shareholders to make money, right? And sooner I was like, yes. Like I,

928
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:37,445
Speaker 5:  we do these deals because they are good value and Google is a business and

929
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:41,325
Speaker 5:  when people use our search engine, we make money from it. Like that fact

930
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:45,045
Speaker 5:  is not unclear to anyone. Right. I think if you wanna talk

931
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:48,685
Speaker 5:  about the ways in which Google's search has gotten worse over time, which

932
00:50:48,835 --> 00:50:52,045
Speaker 5:  many people perceive that it has. If you wanna talk about whether there are

933
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:55,965
Speaker 5:  too many ads or Google hides the fact that their ads or AI is gonna

934
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:58,645
Speaker 5:  ruin the quality of your search results. Like that's all really interesting

935
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:02,645
Speaker 5:  questions. But Google's coming out here and basically saying like, we

936
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:04,445
Speaker 5:  are a business, we make an awful lot of money.

937
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:10,605
Speaker 5:  What do you want from us? Like the, the idea that Google

938
00:51:11,275 --> 00:51:15,005
Speaker 5:  started out as this company at in the relatively early days of the web and

939
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,165
Speaker 5:  said, we are going to bet on the web, we are going to bet that we can be

940
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,965
Speaker 5:  essentially infrastructure for the entire web and that if we

941
00:51:22,325 --> 00:51:26,245
Speaker 5:  help more people do more stuff on the web that will accrue value back

942
00:51:26,245 --> 00:51:30,125
Speaker 5:  to Google. That has been one of the great bets of business Yeah.

943
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:34,285
Speaker 5:  Of all time. Like, holy God was that a good idea from Google 25 years

944
00:51:34,285 --> 00:51:38,245
Speaker 5:  ago? And the question in front of Google and it was kind of

945
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:40,805
Speaker 5:  put to sooner or a bunch of different ways is like, has that turned like,

946
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:44,765
Speaker 5:  are you no longer good for the web because you're so big, because you're

947
00:51:44,765 --> 00:51:48,645
Speaker 5:  so powerful because you're so sort of singular

948
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:52,205
Speaker 5:  in your power as that infrastructural layer. And that's obviously a more

949
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:55,285
Speaker 5:  charger question to answer. And obviously Sundar is not going to say, yes,

950
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:59,285
Speaker 5:  we're too big, it's a huge problem. But that

951
00:51:59,535 --> 00:52:03,365
Speaker 5:  thing that they bet on the web and the web got to take over the world. And

952
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:07,125
Speaker 5:  so did Google is like the central tension of all of this

953
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:11,045
Speaker 5:  because it's like at what point does that go from, I think

954
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,765
Speaker 5:  we all rooted for Google for a really long time because it was true that

955
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:14,245
Speaker 5:  I think we

956
00:52:14,245 --> 00:52:16,605
Speaker 3:  Have, I think a lot of our listeners are still rooting for Google for

957
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:20,525
Speaker 5:  Sure. Like it's, it was, it was a company that believed in

958
00:52:20,525 --> 00:52:23,125
Speaker 5:  the internet. Yeah. At a time that I think it was good to have a company

959
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:23,605
Speaker 5:  that believed in

960
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:26,565
Speaker 3:  Internet in many ways when we interact with people from various companies,

961
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:28,885
Speaker 3:  the people from Google are easily the most sincere.

962
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:32,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And they want the web to be a good place full of good things

963
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:36,485
Speaker 5:  that people can access and use. Like I think that rules, when does that

964
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:40,645
Speaker 5:  turn on you? And you become, you have to tamp

965
00:52:40,645 --> 00:52:44,125
Speaker 5:  down the web to keep it the way that you want it. That's the question. And

966
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:47,925
Speaker 5:  like has Google tipped over that line? Was what Sundar was kind of being

967
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:51,285
Speaker 5:  asked indirectly over and over and it was just, it was fascinating to see

968
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:52,405
Speaker 5:  it distilled down. I would

969
00:52:52,405 --> 00:52:55,085
Speaker 3:  Point, we were gonna link to this too, David wrote a story about Google Amp

970
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:59,165
Speaker 3:  is part of our Google package when Google clearly went over the line. Yeah.

971
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:01,285
Speaker 3:  And had to roll it all back. But that's

972
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:03,885
Speaker 5:  Such a fun example, right? Because Google is like, okay, if we don't do this,

973
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:07,885
Speaker 5:  Facebook will, right? Like it's a they, that's a response to a real threat

974
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:11,325
Speaker 5:  from a company that was like actively trying to destroy the open web. Like

975
00:53:11,465 --> 00:53:15,165
Speaker 5:  that's just like naked aggression against you and web. And so Google

976
00:53:15,345 --> 00:53:19,285
Speaker 5:  did what it decided to do I think

977
00:53:19,385 --> 00:53:23,365
Speaker 5:  was way too far over the line. But to respond to that in some way and

978
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:27,245
Speaker 5:  say we have to preserve the open web not wrong and not

979
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:31,445
Speaker 5:  out of bounds with what Google had always said that it was, but it's just,

980
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:35,405
Speaker 5:  it's that same thing. It's like where do you go from what's good for the

981
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:39,325
Speaker 5:  web is good for Google and everybody wins to we have to keep

982
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:42,205
Speaker 5:  the web just like this so that Google can keep winning. Yeah.

983
00:53:43,155 --> 00:53:47,135
Speaker 3:  And I think that the interesting thing about the sort of like dominant algorithm

984
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:50,775
Speaker 3:  theory is it's weird that the web is shaped

985
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:54,935
Speaker 3:  for search. That there's no other discovery engine. That there's no other

986
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:58,655
Speaker 3:  competing incentive. You can't just make a weird website and sort of like

987
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,815
Speaker 3:  assume Google will find it. Right.

988
00:53:59,815 --> 00:54:03,775
Speaker 5:  And it's really telling that Google now is even struggling to do that. It's

989
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,375
Speaker 5:  trying to find all these new ways to show you stuff. It's trying to do the

990
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:10,055
Speaker 5:  more multimedia search and it's just like, I don't know. Have you found yourself

991
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:12,855
Speaker 5:  on one of those pages where you do a Google search and instead of getting

992
00:54:12,895 --> 00:54:16,255
Speaker 5:  a bunch of links to stuff they just show you like vertical videos? Yeah.

993
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:19,215
Speaker 5:  Yeah. In a row. It feels bad. I don't like it. Yeah. I,

994
00:54:19,295 --> 00:54:21,775
Speaker 4:  I click out every time. Especially if it's like I'm trying to figure out

995
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:22,695
Speaker 4:  how to grill something

996
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:26,295
Speaker 3:  You know. I know I so bad. It's because you don't know that you can ever

997
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:29,725
Speaker 3:  get back there. Yeah, that's, yeah. There's something really permanent about

998
00:54:29,815 --> 00:54:32,325
Speaker 3:  doing a Google search and finding a page and be like All, right? I looked

999
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:34,365
Speaker 3:  through some of these, I'll come back to it or whatever. For

1000
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:37,085
Speaker 4:  Me it was just, oh God, I'm gonna have to watch a video. I just wanna like

1001
00:54:37,225 --> 00:54:38,325
Speaker 4:  go and scan a,

1002
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,125
Speaker 3:  I'm told the video is the highest

1003
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:41,325
Speaker 5:  Band. Yeah. That's just 'cause you're old.

1004
00:54:41,415 --> 00:54:42,845
Speaker 4:  Sorry. Sorry, I'm just old. Old.

1005
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:43,725
Speaker 5:  That nonsense.

1006
00:54:43,795 --> 00:54:46,285
Speaker 3:  Okay, we gotta take a break. I'll just say this at the very end we were getting

1007
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:49,445

1044
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,785
Speaker 3:  round. Pew pew.

1045
00:57:13,855 --> 00:57:14,745
Speaker 4:  That was was my streaming.

1046
00:57:14,745 --> 00:57:16,305
Speaker 3:  Alex Alex Cranz. Take it away.

1047
00:57:18,305 --> 00:57:22,145
Speaker 4:  A lot happened this week. I'm gonna kick it off with Casey Boyz, who is

1048
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:25,945
Speaker 4:  currently running HBO and during the early days of the,

1049
00:57:25,965 --> 00:57:29,545
Speaker 4:  the pandemic was a little too into his phone and was directing

1050
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:33,105
Speaker 4:  people to direct interns to harass

1051
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:37,625
Speaker 4:  or not to harass, but to Troll Critics online of

1052
00:57:37,765 --> 00:57:38,185
Speaker 4:  HBO shows

1053
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:42,025
Speaker 3:  This like Warner Media classic move. Yeah.

1054
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:46,185
Speaker 4:  Hysterical. He has since apologized. Oh my. Because this, this all

1055
00:57:46,185 --> 00:57:49,585
Speaker 4:  came out because one of those interns is suing the company for wrongful

1056
00:57:49,585 --> 00:57:52,385
Speaker 4:  termination. So it all came out from that. It was in this big Rolling stone

1057
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,065
Speaker 4:  piece all about the company. A lot of really good reporting in that piece.

1058
00:57:55,525 --> 00:57:58,985
Speaker 4:  She go track it down. But since then Kissy Boys has addressed it and he was

1059
00:57:58,985 --> 00:58:02,945
Speaker 4:  basically like, I was too into my phone and now I just

1060
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:06,425
Speaker 4:  DM when I'm angry at Critics instead.

1061
00:58:06,965 --> 00:58:07,425
Speaker 3:  Oh my.

1062
00:58:07,725 --> 00:58:11,465
Speaker 5:  Is that, that's really, that's the, the You know huge

1063
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,705
Speaker 5:  feat of self-realization that he's gone through

1064
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:17,105
Speaker 3:  This. He just direct messages

1065
00:58:17,645 --> 00:58:18,025
Speaker 5:  You myself.

1066
00:58:18,025 --> 00:58:21,025
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So, so he's so he's DMing his criticism more. And

1067
00:58:21,945 --> 00:58:25,585
Speaker 4:  honestly I would rather, I would rather have Tim Cook come into my

1068
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:28,625
Speaker 4:  dms, be like, that was a real rude thing you said about that phone. The

1069
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:30,025
Speaker 3:  Flash was good. Yeah. I

1070
00:58:30,025 --> 00:58:32,345
Speaker 4:  Would, I I think I'd rather like prefer that

1071
00:58:32,615 --> 00:58:35,145
Speaker 3:  What he, what are you, what are you trying to say? Casey Blois.

1072
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:39,505
Speaker 5:  Okay, I have two. I have two things to say to Casey. Blois Casey,

1073
00:58:39,825 --> 00:58:43,065
Speaker 5:  I know you're listening. So pull over your car, take notes. Yeah. Thing number

1074
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:45,065
Speaker 5:  one is use your own burners man, come on.

1075
00:58:45,505 --> 00:58:45,665
Speaker 3:  Like

1076
00:58:46,165 --> 00:58:49,865
Speaker 5:  I'm all for having burners and NBA athletes do it.

1077
00:58:50,415 --> 00:58:54,345
Speaker 5:  Everybody has a burner that they use just for looking at accounts that

1078
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:57,985
Speaker 5:  just in case they like one by accident. Everybody, everybody has burners,

1079
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:02,105
Speaker 5:  but you gotta have your own burners. And if you're not gonna have your own

1080
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:06,065
Speaker 5:  burners, at least like do it for real and get like a bot farm

1081
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,825
Speaker 5:  You. know what I mean? Like he, he did this like half measure that. It's

1082
00:59:09,825 --> 00:59:12,945
Speaker 5:  like if you're gonna go for it, go for it. Otherwise just

1083
00:59:13,895 --> 00:59:17,065
Speaker 5:  pretend you're like a random stranger and defend yourself and you'll inevitably

1084
00:59:17,165 --> 00:59:21,065
Speaker 5:  get caught. And it'll be very funny. This is the weirdest, worst way

1085
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:24,245
Speaker 5:  to do it. To like yell at your desistence to defend you on the internet.

1086
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:24,805
Speaker 5:  Like don't do

1087
00:59:24,805 --> 00:59:26,165
Speaker 3:  That. Yeah. It's not great. No,

1088
00:59:26,305 --> 00:59:29,925
Speaker 4:  He says, he says it's much better now because he has, many of them are

1089
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:34,005
Speaker 4:  gracious enough to engage with him back and forth. So it's much

1090
00:59:34,005 --> 00:59:37,685
Speaker 4:  better now instead of having the intern say you souk.

1091
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:41,805
Speaker 4:  'cause that was, that was the gist of the ones they confirmed were coming

1092
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:42,805
Speaker 4:  from, from this person.

1093
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:46,645
Speaker 3:  I mean, okay, I'm gonna disagree with you. It's not even good. I want an

1094
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:50,005
Speaker 3:  army of interns with burner accounts to tweet at our Critics.

1095
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:53,365
Speaker 3:  And if you're interested in this job, you can just email us at Vergecast

1096
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:57,045
Speaker 3:  at The Verge dot com and we'll see. We'll see what happens next. We'll

1097
00:59:57,045 --> 00:59:57,605
Speaker 4:  Pay you in merch.

1098
00:59:57,605 --> 01:00:00,605
Speaker 3:  Also, those Critics are not being very gracious 'cause they didn't know that

1099
01:00:00,605 --> 01:00:04,405
Speaker 3:  the army of anonymous interns was tweeting. You suck at them.

1100
01:00:04,515 --> 01:00:06,885
Speaker 3:  Yeah, because it was like, it wasn't like, it wasn't like Casey was like,

1101
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:10,805
Speaker 3:  Hey, so all those weird anon accounts that have been tweeting

1102
01:00:10,805 --> 01:00:14,445
Speaker 3:  you suck at you. That was me. I prefer to start DMing now. And they're like,

1103
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:16,965
Speaker 3:  oh yes, of course Casey come in like

1104
01:00:18,225 --> 01:00:19,645
Speaker 3:  no, he just started DMing them

1105
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:24,575
Speaker 3:  All. right. Here's my, it's staying on HBO Max, here's my lightning round

1106
01:00:24,575 --> 01:00:24,775
Speaker 3:  one.

1107
01:00:26,595 --> 01:00:30,415
Speaker 3:  In the grand scheme of everything getting more expensive, if you're on

1108
01:00:30,435 --> 01:00:33,495
Speaker 3:  HBO Max and you had ad free, now they're gonna charge you more money for

1109
01:00:33,495 --> 01:00:36,455
Speaker 3:  four K. God dammit. If you get a legacy ad free account,

1110
01:00:38,195 --> 01:00:42,055
Speaker 4:  How much am I paying now? I miss this and I'm

1111
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:42,575
Speaker 4:  very upset.

1112
01:00:43,075 --> 01:00:44,215
Speaker 3:  You have to go to 20 bucks a

1113
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:47,775
Speaker 5:  Month. So if you're on the standard, if you're on the standard

1114
01:00:48,075 --> 01:00:51,975
Speaker 5:  ad free one that you used to get four K on, which I think is 16 bucks a month,

1115
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:55,615
Speaker 5:  you're gonna lose four K. You have to upgrade the ultimate at 20 bucks a

1116
01:00:55,615 --> 01:00:57,495
Speaker 5:  month and then you get four K back.

1117
01:00:57,955 --> 01:01:01,495
Speaker 4:  I'm not gonna have any money for my children. I don't have any, did

1118
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:01,935
Speaker 5:  We get,

1119
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,975
Speaker 3:  Mine is named Max. I get nothing for this. I should get a

1120
01:01:05,975 --> 01:01:07,735
Speaker 3:  substantial discount. You should.

1121
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:11,535
Speaker 5:  Where did we land on our, would you cancel your streaming services

1122
01:01:11,595 --> 01:01:13,535
Speaker 5:  before you gave up four K? A lot of

1123
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:16,335
Speaker 4:  People agreed with me. That's, that's what I'm gonna say. Okay. Is a lot

1124
01:01:16,335 --> 01:01:19,895
Speaker 4:  of people agree that yeah, they would rather cancel than give up four K.

1125
01:01:19,895 --> 01:01:20,175
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

1126
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:21,935
Speaker 5:  That was the most of the feedback I heard too. I think

1127
01:01:22,175 --> 01:01:25,975
Speaker 4:  Honestly the audacity of Max who was late to four

1128
01:01:26,055 --> 01:01:29,535
Speaker 4:  K and half-assed four K and is still half-assing four K

1129
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:33,775
Speaker 4:  to expect me to pay more. I'm gonna do it, but I'm gonna be so

1130
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:34,815
Speaker 4:  furious the whole time.

1131
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:37,335
Speaker 3:  This is the problem with millennials. Alex. Yeah.

1132
01:01:37,335 --> 01:01:38,215
Speaker 4:  This is the same energy I

1133
01:01:38,215 --> 01:01:42,175
Speaker 3:  Bring you and your avocado coast. Your $20 a month of garbage. Four K no

1134
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:44,095
Speaker 4:  Children. What am I doing with my life?

1135
01:01:44,515 --> 01:01:47,095
Speaker 5:  Do You know what I've realized recently? Yeah. So I've been sort of systematically

1136
01:01:47,095 --> 01:01:50,295
Speaker 5:  going and downgrading everything to the ad plans because I just want the

1137
01:01:50,295 --> 01:01:52,455
Speaker 5:  ads like I'm good. Give me, give me the ads. Four K

1138
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:54,055
Speaker 4:  Ads. Yeah. You want that Myrtle Beach timeshare.

1139
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:58,095
Speaker 5:  The strangest thing I have discovered is that I kind of love it because

1140
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:02,095
Speaker 5:  it's a phone break. I now like four times an hour I get a phone break.

1141
01:02:02,275 --> 01:02:05,695
Speaker 5:  So. I. Don't look at my phone during shows anymore because I know that in

1142
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:09,695
Speaker 5:  seven minutes I'm going to get three minutes to look at Reddit

1143
01:02:09,695 --> 01:02:13,335
Speaker 5:  or check my texts or whatever. And then we're gonna, it's perfect. It's just

1144
01:02:13,335 --> 01:02:16,535
Speaker 5:  like a tiny little intermission where whatever's happening on the TV happens

1145
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:18,215
Speaker 5:  on the tv. But I get to look at TikTok.

1146
01:02:18,365 --> 01:02:21,485
Speaker 3:  Your house sounds horrible. You're watching like four 80 p survivor

1147
01:02:22,145 --> 01:02:25,845
Speaker 3:  on a garbage fast service. Oh yeah. Looking at your phone and for three minute

1148
01:02:25,845 --> 01:02:26,205
Speaker 3:  chunks,

1149
01:02:26,305 --> 01:02:30,285
Speaker 5:  Anna's sitting next to me doing spelling Bee and I'm sitting here.

1150
01:02:30,805 --> 01:02:33,965
Speaker 5:  I do connections during one, I look at Reddit during another one. I check

1151
01:02:33,965 --> 01:02:37,525
Speaker 5:  my email and Slack during another one and then it's the end of the hour and

1152
01:02:37,525 --> 01:02:39,245
Speaker 5:  I've watched the whole show. It's perfect.

1153
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:43,005
Speaker 3:  I don't want this All. right. What's your lightning A one beyond your bad

1154
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:44,165
Speaker 3:  idea about watching ads.

1155
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:48,045
Speaker 5:  Ads. What if there was an ad break but just no ads. It's just silence on

1156
01:02:48,045 --> 01:02:48,645
Speaker 5:  the TV for two.

1157
01:02:48,645 --> 01:02:50,205
Speaker 3:  Everybody gets a phone break. Yeah,

1158
01:02:50,235 --> 01:02:52,005
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Sponsored

1159
01:02:52,065 --> 01:02:52,605
Speaker 4:  By Intel.

1160
01:02:52,955 --> 01:02:56,805
Speaker 5:  Mine is Disney appears to be actually for

1161
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:59,685
Speaker 5:  real about to own all of Hulu, which we've kind of known is coming for a

1162
01:02:59,685 --> 01:03:03,605
Speaker 5:  while. But it seems like approximately one minute after

1163
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:07,325
Speaker 5:  Comcast was allowed to exercise the clause that would force

1164
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,165
Speaker 5:  Disney to buy the rest of Hulu. It did. So now comes

1165
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:15,045
Speaker 5:  the part where Disney and Comcast have to figure out what Hulu

1166
01:03:15,045 --> 01:03:18,685
Speaker 5:  is worth, which I think is gonna be really fascinating. They set it up in

1167
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:21,085
Speaker 5:  such a way basically, and Alex, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I understand

1168
01:03:21,085 --> 01:03:24,885
Speaker 5:  this right, which is that a bunch of years ago when they made this deal that

1169
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,645
Speaker 5:  would allow Disney need to eventually buy all of Hulu, they valued Hulu about

1170
01:03:28,645 --> 01:03:32,045
Speaker 5:  $27 billion, which meant that the roughly third

1171
01:03:32,985 --> 01:03:36,765
Speaker 5:  of the service that Comcast owned was worth like eight and change billion

1172
01:03:36,765 --> 01:03:40,605
Speaker 5:  dollars. Now that's the minimum price Disney is gonna have to pay.

1173
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:44,245
Speaker 5:  If the price has gone down since then. Sucks for Disney, they still have

1174
01:03:44,245 --> 01:03:47,845
Speaker 5:  to pay that money. I don't think it has, if that price has gone up, Disney's

1175
01:03:47,845 --> 01:03:50,965
Speaker 5:  gonna have to pay the eight and change plus

1176
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:55,405
Speaker 5:  whatever percentage difference there is based on the new valuation of Hulu.

1177
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:58,805
Speaker 5:  So the question now is what is Hulu worth in the market?

1178
01:04:00,405 --> 01:04:03,825
Speaker 5:  And we're about to find out. It's a deeply weird time in the Streaming world.

1179
01:04:03,825 --> 01:04:07,635
Speaker 5:  Streaming is both like ascendant and a mess. I have no idea.

1180
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:11,515
Speaker 5:  But I think figuring out how much money this is, especially for Disney, which

1181
01:04:11,535 --> 01:04:15,475
Speaker 5:  is not in a super good position to be writing checks for eight plus

1182
01:04:15,475 --> 01:04:18,715
Speaker 5:  billion dollars at this moment in time. It's about to get really weird.

1183
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,715
Speaker 4:  I think it's gonna force Disney to actually think about

1184
01:04:23,145 --> 01:04:25,875
Speaker 4:  what it's doing, And what its strategy

1185
01:04:26,055 --> 01:04:26,275
Speaker 3:  Is.

1186
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:30,915
Speaker 4:  I don't think Disney's been doing that lately.

1187
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:35,155
Speaker 3:  It is a weird time to announce this deal when the cover of Variety is,

1188
01:04:35,695 --> 01:04:39,275
Speaker 3:  is Marvel screwed? Yeah. Which is a piece worth reading.

1189
01:04:39,465 --> 01:04:39,755
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

1190
01:04:39,825 --> 01:04:43,675
Speaker 4:  It's a great piece. I, I wrote kind of an addendum to it. It's on the

1191
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:47,355
Speaker 4:  site right now. They, they don't know how Marvel like,

1192
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:50,915
Speaker 4:  like Marvel's just in a bad spot. And, and the piece was very kind of weird

1193
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:54,635
Speaker 4:  because it refused to blame Kevin gy who, who runs Marvel

1194
01:04:54,665 --> 01:04:58,555
Speaker 4:  Studios for anything. But then everything seemed to quietly like, they'd

1195
01:04:58,555 --> 01:05:00,995
Speaker 4:  be like, yeah, there's someone at the top and we don't know what to do. And

1196
01:05:00,995 --> 01:05:04,795
Speaker 4:  it's like Weird story. But yeah, I I think Disney has to figure out

1197
01:05:04,865 --> 01:05:08,555
Speaker 4:  it's got these, it's got multiple services. For a long time it was like,

1198
01:05:08,555 --> 01:05:12,195
Speaker 4:  this is for adults and Disney Plus is for babies and maybe it's gonna

1199
01:05:12,205 --> 01:05:16,115
Speaker 4:  merge the two together. It's also got the Hulu live subscription and

1200
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:20,165
Speaker 4:  there's a, a reasonable amount of subscribers there, but not as many as you

1201
01:05:20,535 --> 01:05:24,405
Speaker 4:  think Hulu is still way below Disney Plus and subscriptions. So

1202
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:28,045
Speaker 4:  it's gonna be like they, they already own all of, they

1203
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:31,525
Speaker 4:  own everything on it. 'cause it's all Fox in, in ABC shows. So they own everything.

1204
01:05:31,525 --> 01:05:32,485
Speaker 4:  It's just like, what do you,

1205
01:05:34,485 --> 01:05:38,325
Speaker 4:  I don't know. I I think that all the people who have to to figure this, the

1206
01:05:38,325 --> 01:05:41,965
Speaker 4:  price out are gonna fight like the Comcast and the Disney folks. I wanna

1207
01:05:41,965 --> 01:05:45,085
Speaker 4:  be in that room watching those two groups fight each other. 'cause that's

1208
01:05:45,085 --> 01:05:46,325
Speaker 4:  gonna be really cool. But

1209
01:05:46,705 --> 01:05:50,205
Speaker 3:  One assumes that Disney is planning to sell ESPN and Comcast

1210
01:05:50,415 --> 01:05:54,045
Speaker 3:  knows this and they would like some of that money to come back to Comcast.

1211
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:55,125
Speaker 4:  That's

1212
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:58,525
Speaker 3:  Fair disclosure. N BBC Universal division of Comcast

1213
01:05:58,945 --> 01:06:02,925
Speaker 3:  is a minority investor at Vox Media, our parent company. We produced a

1214
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,405
Speaker 3:  Netflix show, which you should go watch. It's called The Future of, I was

1215
01:06:05,405 --> 01:06:08,925
Speaker 3:  the executive producer of that show. It's really quite good. But I'm hopelessly

1216
01:06:08,925 --> 01:06:11,005
Speaker 3:  biased in favor of that show, which

1217
01:06:11,005 --> 01:06:12,005
Speaker 5:  You should watch on Netflix.

1218
01:06:12,005 --> 01:06:13,005
Speaker 3:  Which you should watch. You should.

1219
01:06:15,315 --> 01:06:15,885
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That's it.

1220
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:16,885
Speaker 5:  I think that's all for now. Yeah.

1221
01:06:17,185 --> 01:06:19,965
Speaker 3:  We all have televisions. I think those are the ones that are implicated in

1222
01:06:19,965 --> 01:06:23,885
Speaker 3:  this conversation. I do. Again, our site is discoverable

1223
01:06:23,945 --> 01:06:24,445
Speaker 3:  in search.

1224
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:27,325
Speaker 3:  We have a TikTok account.

1225
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:29,965
Speaker 3:  We

1226
01:06:29,965 --> 01:06:30,525
Speaker 4:  Use YouTube

1227
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:35,205
Speaker 3:  Two more. We YouTube we won an Emmy this week. Hell yeah. We is

1228
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:39,165
Speaker 3:  to won an Emmy. Yeah. For her YouTube series. Full frame. Big

1229
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:43,085
Speaker 3:  bias in favor of winning Emmy's. Just know you can't trust anything we say

1230
01:06:43,105 --> 01:06:44,405
Speaker 3:  if it's not gonna win. It's an Emmy.

1231
01:06:44,785 --> 01:06:47,965
Speaker 5:  One more thing before we move on from the Streaming stuff. There was a big

1232
01:06:47,965 --> 01:06:51,845
Speaker 5:  debate in our comments on the Hulu Disney thing about whether, if you're

1233
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:54,445
Speaker 5:  gonna com, if you're Disney and you're gonna combine all your streaming services,

1234
01:06:54,545 --> 01:06:58,125
Speaker 5:  should you call it Disney Plus? Or should you call it Hulu? I think this

1235
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:01,285
Speaker 5:  is the most obvious question ever, but I'm curious what you two think.

1236
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:06,065
Speaker 4:  Ooh, I think if if Disney knew what they were doing, they would call it Hulu.

1237
01:07:06,325 --> 01:07:09,625
Speaker 4:  No. Yes, a hundred percent. Because Disney itself has

1238
01:07:10,265 --> 01:07:12,265
Speaker 4:  a very specific brand identity and that's what

1239
01:07:12,415 --> 01:07:15,385
Speaker 5:  They're terrified. You mean the best brand identity potentially of any brand

1240
01:07:15,785 --> 01:07:16,745
Speaker 5:  anywhere on planet Earth.

1241
01:07:17,485 --> 01:07:18,145
Speaker 4:  But also

1242
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:21,745
Speaker 5:  Disney is the good brand. That's literally what it is. Yeah. It's the good

1243
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:23,625
Speaker 5:  brand. It's goodness and happiness and joy. I literally

1244
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:27,785
Speaker 3:  Heard one of Becky's ants say out loud,

1245
01:07:28,455 --> 01:07:32,425
Speaker 3:  what is the difference between Hulu and Roku? And

1246
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,625
Speaker 3:  I looked at her and I was like, You know what? That is a

1247
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:38,385
Speaker 3:  surprisingly deep and meaningful and good question.

1248
01:07:38,545 --> 01:07:39,905
Speaker 4:  That's it's a good question. It's

1249
01:07:40,215 --> 01:07:40,505
Speaker 5:  It's

1250
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:41,585
Speaker 3:  Right. I think

1251
01:07:41,585 --> 01:07:42,225
Speaker 4:  That's a good question.

1252
01:07:42,455 --> 01:07:44,585
Speaker 3:  Like it's just TV stuff. Yeah.

1253
01:07:44,585 --> 01:07:48,545
Speaker 4:  But the problem with Disney is that Disney is not just Disney. It's,

1254
01:07:48,545 --> 01:07:51,745
Speaker 4:  it's A, B, C. Well for now it's A, B, C. It's these, these

1255
01:07:51,745 --> 01:07:52,505
Speaker 3:  Are all solvable problems.

1256
01:07:52,575 --> 01:07:55,625
Speaker 4:  It's all of these things. And they're running into the exact same problem

1257
01:07:56,245 --> 01:08:00,025
Speaker 4:  as HBO or as Warner Brothers. And Warner Brothers obviously went with the

1258
01:08:00,025 --> 01:08:01,265
Speaker 4:  incredible Max

1259
01:08:03,085 --> 01:08:05,945
Speaker 4:  and here's the real opportunity for them to be like, we're not gonna do that.

1260
01:08:06,485 --> 01:08:10,305
Speaker 4:  Disney Plus was always kind of a stupid name because it was, and instead

1261
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:11,505
Speaker 4:  we're just, we're just gonna click

1262
01:08:12,205 --> 01:08:14,265
Speaker 3:  To Hulu. Here's what they're gonna do. They're called the Everything app.

1263
01:08:14,265 --> 01:08:17,725
Speaker 3:  It's gonna be called X. It's gonna do payments. You can date Mini Mouse.

1264
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:22,085
Speaker 3:  It's gonna be amazing. Elon will be, it's all gonna be great. All right?

1265
01:08:22,085 --> 01:08:25,205
Speaker 3:  We gotta take a break. We'll be right back with with Lightning Round part

01:10:25,765 --> 01:10:29,565
Speaker 3:  covered on TikTok by the way. T Ffl Truck, one of my all time

1297
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:33,285
Speaker 3:  favorite. They're just, it's just a website about trucks that they rule.

1298
01:10:33,715 --> 01:10:34,165
Speaker 3:  It's great.

1299
01:10:35,685 --> 01:10:39,525
Speaker 3:  There're some car show. The guy's like, I'm here with a Ford

1300
01:10:39,605 --> 01:10:43,565
Speaker 3:  F one 50 Lightning at the Borla booth and he goes to the Borla guy and he

1301
01:10:43,565 --> 01:10:47,365
Speaker 3:  is like, so you've built an exhaust system for the F one 50 Lightning.

1302
01:10:47,585 --> 01:10:50,445
Speaker 3:  And the guy looks at me and goes, it's really more of an aftermarket sound

1303
01:10:50,765 --> 01:10:50,885
Speaker 3:  solution.

1304
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:57,605
Speaker 3:  And then he goes, it can play futuristic sounds too. It this, this is

1305
01:10:57,605 --> 01:11:01,485
Speaker 3:  a thing that happens in this video. I lost my mind. I've watched him

1306
01:11:01,865 --> 01:11:05,845
Speaker 3:  say it's really more of an aftermarket sound solution a thousand

1307
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,405
Speaker 3:  times. Did he play it? The confidence?

1308
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:13,685
Speaker 3:  It's really more of an aftermarket sound solution. What he means by

1309
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:17,565
Speaker 3:  this is that there are speakers mounted under the

1310
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:21,365
Speaker 3:  bumper of the truck. What? And then when he pushes the accelerator

1311
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:24,805
Speaker 3:  down, it makes engine sounds remove and it's all very complicated,

1312
01:11:25,455 --> 01:11:28,365
Speaker 3:  right? He's like, look, we're plugged into the systems. The truck we're we're,

1313
01:11:28,495 --> 01:11:31,845
Speaker 3:  we're measuring the distance accelerator pedals pushed to the floor, the

1314
01:11:31,845 --> 01:11:35,685
Speaker 3:  load on the engine. We've got simulated gear shift sounds on

1315
01:11:35,685 --> 01:11:39,365
Speaker 3:  an electric truck. And then he's like, and there's,

1316
01:11:39,365 --> 01:11:42,885
Speaker 3:  there's buttons and knobs. So there's one knob switches between

1317
01:11:43,355 --> 01:11:46,725
Speaker 3:  four presets. The other one is the volume. You can change the presets on

1318
01:11:46,725 --> 01:11:49,445
Speaker 3:  your phone to futuristic sounds. It's really more of an aftermarket sound

1319
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:53,005
Speaker 3:  solution. And then he is like, here's what you can set it to right now.

1320
01:11:54,295 --> 01:11:57,865
Speaker 3:  Mind you, this is a Ford truck. He's like a Chevy Silverado. What

1321
01:11:58,265 --> 01:11:59,225
Speaker 3:  a Dodge Charger.

1322
01:12:00,815 --> 01:12:04,625
Speaker 3:  And I'm like, there was a meeting that

1323
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:08,145
Speaker 3:  the exhaust company, Borla is a famous exhaust company and they had a meeting

1324
01:12:08,165 --> 01:12:11,705
Speaker 3:  and they're like, this EV thing is killing us. No one's gonna buy

1325
01:12:12,255 --> 01:12:15,945
Speaker 3:  exhaust pipes from us anymore. Headers out the window. Yeah. We're not doing

1326
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:19,715
Speaker 3:  this. What's our plan? And someone's like aftermarket

1327
01:12:19,725 --> 01:12:23,275
Speaker 3:  sound solutions. We're gonna put speakers on the trucks and we're gonna make

1328
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:25,195
Speaker 3:  Ford trucks. Sounds like they have Chevy v eights in them.

1329
01:12:26,215 --> 01:12:26,995
Speaker 5:  How are they gonna roll

1330
01:12:26,995 --> 01:12:28,475
Speaker 3:  Calls? There was a meeting Alex.

1331
01:12:31,275 --> 01:12:35,115
Speaker 3:  I love it. Just go watch this video. It's not even our video. I just quick

1332
01:12:35,115 --> 01:12:38,475
Speaker 3:  posted a TikTok from another publication 'cause I can't get enough of this

1333
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:41,635
Speaker 3:  guy saying it's really more of an aftermarket sound solution. There

1334
01:12:41,635 --> 01:12:45,555
Speaker 5:  Was a period of time like two months ago, I would say, where

1335
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:48,955
Speaker 5:  Neli, you missed a couple of shows in a row. You were super busy.

1336
01:12:50,335 --> 01:12:53,035
Speaker 5:  You didn't do the iPhone review this year. You were doing code, you were

1337
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,635
Speaker 5:  moving, A lot was going on. And we got a bunch of emails being like, is is

1338
01:12:55,665 --> 01:12:58,715
Speaker 5:  Neli leaving? Is he going off to like some big job? And I want everyone to

1339
01:12:58,715 --> 01:13:02,035
Speaker 5:  know that when Neli does leave, it will be to do the thing he just described

1340
01:13:02,385 --> 01:13:06,275
Speaker 5:  just now. Neli will leave us to go do aftermarket

1341
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:10,115
Speaker 5:  sound solution truck TikTok. And that will be the end. That's the only thing.

1342
01:13:10,115 --> 01:13:13,715
Speaker 5:  If ever Neli disappears, look for him on truck TikTok. And that's,

1343
01:13:14,175 --> 01:13:15,115
Speaker 5:  that's what it will be.

1344
01:13:15,795 --> 01:13:19,435
Speaker 3:  I just got Go watch the video. Well it's just the confidence. It's really

1345
01:13:19,435 --> 01:13:21,435
Speaker 3:  more of an aftermarket sound solution. You're

1346
01:13:21,435 --> 01:13:24,235
Speaker 4:  Very like, I feel confident listening to you say it.

1347
01:13:24,995 --> 01:13:25,795
Speaker 3:  I just like, if you're buying

1348
01:13:26,415 --> 01:13:26,915
Speaker 4:  The way it

1349
01:13:26,915 --> 01:13:30,835
Speaker 3:  Just, the number of companies that are solving the sort of like

1350
01:13:30,945 --> 01:13:34,875
Speaker 3:  political culture, war of EVs by being like, here's what we're gonna do

1351
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:35,795
Speaker 4:  Making

1352
01:13:35,985 --> 01:13:38,675
Speaker 3:  Loud. We're gonna have speakers on the car and we're gonna make 'em sound

1353
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:42,555
Speaker 3:  like they burn gas and that'll fix it. Dodge is doing

1354
01:13:42,555 --> 01:13:43,315
Speaker 3:  this. They

1355
01:13:43,315 --> 01:13:43,435
Speaker 4:  Are,

1356
01:13:43,945 --> 01:13:47,195
Speaker 3:  They call it the fret sonic exhaust system. And they won't admit that they're

1357
01:13:47,195 --> 01:13:50,595
Speaker 3:  putting speakers under the car. At least Borla is like, yeah, it's a, what

1358
01:13:50,595 --> 01:13:52,075
Speaker 4:  Does it sound when it's like crossing water,

1359
01:13:53,305 --> 01:13:55,515
Speaker 3:  Like the speakers are drowning it.

1360
01:13:56,825 --> 01:13:58,075
Speaker 5:  That was very good actually.

1361
01:13:58,255 --> 01:13:59,475
Speaker 3:  It was really good. That's really

1362
01:13:59,475 --> 01:13:59,675
Speaker 5:  Good.

1363
01:14:01,695 --> 01:14:01,915
Speaker 5:  Did

1364
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:04,635
Speaker 3:  You say, well you want us to drive your battery powered truck into some water

1365
01:14:04,655 --> 01:14:08,595
Speaker 3:  and make it bubble. Everyone very confident that that's a good situation.

1366
01:14:08,665 --> 01:14:12,525
Speaker 5:  Nila, did you say it's called Fret Sonic or Frat Sonic. Frat Sonic with

1367
01:14:12,725 --> 01:14:15,165
Speaker 5:  z Frat Sonic. That's that's fantastic. Frats.

1368
01:14:15,465 --> 01:14:15,885
Speaker 4:  That's

1369
01:14:16,325 --> 01:14:17,365
Speaker 3:  Whatever man. All. right? What's yours?

1370
01:14:18,115 --> 01:14:21,925
Speaker 4:  Okay. Mine is Chris person who friend of The. Verge has a great story

1371
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:25,725
Speaker 4:  up on the site where he hacked a robot vacuum to make it

1372
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:29,725
Speaker 4:  more like secure because robot vacuums You know they're

1373
01:14:29,725 --> 01:14:32,485
Speaker 4:  going around your house, you're hopefully wearing pants when they're going

1374
01:14:32,485 --> 01:14:36,405
Speaker 4:  around your house. Yeah. Always wear pants and, and they're

1375
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,925
Speaker 4:  mapping your house. They're mapping everything. And then they're uploading

1376
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:42,485
Speaker 4:  all of that to the cloud. And while it is typically pretty secure, it is

1377
01:14:42,485 --> 01:14:46,445
Speaker 4:  also a privacy potential. Privacy nightmare. Yeah. And, and so he

1378
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:50,205
Speaker 4:  had to go use this, this project called Val Vale Tudo.

1379
01:14:50,345 --> 01:14:51,485
Speaker 3:  That's a great name. Bill

1380
01:14:51,645 --> 01:14:51,885
Speaker 4:  Tudo

1381
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:52,925
Speaker 3:  Vale. Tudo

1382
01:14:53,245 --> 01:14:56,845
Speaker 4:  Vale Tudo. And, and so he, he used this project to hack

1383
01:14:57,245 --> 01:15:01,165
Speaker 4:  a robot vacuum and, and, and make it, disconnect

1384
01:15:01,165 --> 01:15:03,445
Speaker 4:  it from the cloud and still make it work and do all this stuff. and it worked.

1385
01:15:04,025 --> 01:15:07,845
Speaker 4:  But he You know he's hacking. This is not He's in just Yeah, he's he's in

1386
01:15:07,845 --> 01:15:11,725
Speaker 4:  the system. He's physically removing boards and adding new boards.

1387
01:15:11,945 --> 01:15:15,125
Speaker 4:  And he was working on this for a while and he was working with I believe

1388
01:15:15,235 --> 01:15:18,325
Speaker 4:  Danford and Dan would just be like, oh yeah, I'm just getting all these pictures

1389
01:15:18,325 --> 01:15:21,885
Speaker 4:  of robot vacuum guts. And you're like, how is going on over there?

1390
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:25,365
Speaker 3:  Has he thought about adding an aftermarket sound solution to his robot vacuum?

1391
01:15:27,635 --> 01:15:30,565
Speaker 3:  Just full Silverado Vette powering through the living room.

1392
01:15:30,715 --> 01:15:34,605
Speaker 4:  It's gonna sound great, but, but the story is really cool and, and I

1393
01:15:34,605 --> 01:15:38,405
Speaker 4:  love the idea of it, especially as the other day, like I kept having

1394
01:15:38,405 --> 01:15:41,445
Speaker 4:  to stand in front of my robot vacuum cleaner and it would like bump into

1395
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:45,325
Speaker 4:  me. And I was like, oh my God, none of these photos can ever like

1396
01:15:45,345 --> 01:15:48,605
Speaker 4:  be leaked. 'cause it's just the worst look for you.

1397
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:53,045
Speaker 4:  They're just horrible. 'cause it's like, it's from your feet up. Yeah. So

1398
01:15:53,045 --> 01:15:56,845
Speaker 4:  it's like, it's, it's, it's basically even worse than that one where you

1399
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:58,965
Speaker 4:  pull your phone out and you go to check something and the camera's facing

1400
01:15:58,965 --> 01:16:01,765
Speaker 4:  you and you're not expecting it. And you've got four chins. There's like

1401
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:06,005
Speaker 4:  12 chins on your ass on your face. There's a lot

1402
01:16:06,005 --> 01:16:09,645
Speaker 4:  of chins happening. And, and nobody needs to see that. So I might, I feel

1403
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:10,805
Speaker 4:  like I kinda wanna hack mine now.

1404
01:16:11,105 --> 01:16:14,805
Speaker 5:  My robot has become a super villain in my house. The noise

1405
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:17,805
Speaker 5:  that the little like boop boop thing that it does right before it starts

1406
01:16:18,105 --> 01:16:22,045
Speaker 5:  scares the hell out of my dog for some reason. She like, literally

1407
01:16:22,045 --> 01:16:24,845
Speaker 5:  as soon as any the vacuum is, you don't have to move. As soon as she hears

1408
01:16:24,845 --> 01:16:27,765
Speaker 5:  that noise, which it for some reason will occasionally just make randomly

1409
01:16:27,785 --> 01:16:31,725
Speaker 5:  out of nowhere, she just goes flying upstairs and hides in the

1410
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:35,605
Speaker 5:  bed under the covers and will not come back for hours. Aw. And our 11 month

1411
01:16:35,605 --> 01:16:38,565
Speaker 5:  old, he's now crawling like a maniac and he sees this little

1412
01:16:39,355 --> 01:16:43,165
Speaker 5:  glowing light and he presses the button 'cause that's fun. And then it

1413
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:46,645
Speaker 5:  moves and it hits him. And he doesn't like that. No. And then it's like,

1414
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:49,925
Speaker 5:  oh, well I have to get around this. So he, it just keeps moving a little

1415
01:16:49,925 --> 01:16:53,325
Speaker 5:  bit like an inch at a time and just bashing into his legs over and over.

1416
01:16:53,785 --> 01:16:56,845
Speaker 5:  So. I have to, I have to figure out a place to put the

1417
01:16:57,615 --> 01:17:01,525
Speaker 5:  robot vacuum that is somehow accessible to no one but can still vacuum my

1418
01:17:01,525 --> 01:17:05,285
Speaker 5:  floors. So if anybody has any like sneaky

1419
01:17:05,345 --> 01:17:06,645
Speaker 5:  hiding places for

1420
01:17:06,645 --> 01:17:09,045
Speaker 4:  Your vacuum vacuum places, I think you get a drone apparatus for your child.

1421
01:17:09,345 --> 01:17:12,045
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. I'll get the ring flying camera. That'll go super good. Yeah. My

1422
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:12,805
Speaker 5:  dog will love that. You get

1423
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:13,045
Speaker 3:  Tougher.

1424
01:17:13,515 --> 01:17:14,245
Speaker 5:  That'll go really

1425
01:17:14,245 --> 01:17:16,805
Speaker 3:  Well. Every time I've ever bought an expensive vacuum, it's been shittier

1426
01:17:16,805 --> 01:17:20,725
Speaker 3:  than the like $30 vacuum we bought when we were like very young. We

1427
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:20,885
Speaker 3:  were,

1428
01:17:21,185 --> 01:17:24,885
Speaker 5:  We were in a hotel in Tennessee a couple of weeks ago and

1429
01:17:25,385 --> 01:17:29,005
Speaker 5:  the the one vacuum that they had in there was this like,

1430
01:17:29,255 --> 01:17:33,165
Speaker 5:  piece of crap dust devil that weighed nothing. And all

1431
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:36,165
Speaker 5:  anyone talked about all weekend was how nice it was because it was so light

1432
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:39,885
Speaker 5:  and small. Yeah. It was like this piece of junk vacuum is like my favorite

1433
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:42,525
Speaker 5:  thing I've ever used to clean floors because it weighs nothing. I have a

1434
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:46,205
Speaker 3:  Thousand dollars LG vacuum with wifi

1435
01:17:46,915 --> 01:17:50,805
Speaker 3:  that empties itself into a stand. I thought this was so

1436
01:17:50,805 --> 01:17:54,565
Speaker 3:  cool. It looks so good, man. Ugh. I just like looking at it.

1437
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:57,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah. We have a $30 shark that just

1438
01:17:58,035 --> 01:18:01,845
Speaker 3:  outperforms that thing. Yep. Coming and going. Yep. Just all that money

1439
01:18:01,845 --> 01:18:04,845
Speaker 3:  is in the wifi chip and not in the part that sucks up dirt.

1440
01:18:05,235 --> 01:18:08,955
Speaker 4:  It's, I I I haven't run four times a week and

1441
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:10,235
Speaker 4:  that kind of helps. Yeah.

1442
01:18:10,545 --> 01:18:10,835
Speaker 5:  I've

1443
01:18:10,835 --> 01:18:13,315
Speaker 3:  Never had any luck with robot vacuums and now I've heard about the ash chin

1444
01:18:13,635 --> 01:18:14,555
Speaker 3:  situation and I never will.

1445
01:18:14,705 --> 01:18:16,195
Speaker 4:  Yeah, don't, don't go look at the

1446
01:18:16,195 --> 01:18:17,795
Speaker 3:  Images. That's David. What's your lightning round item?

1447
01:18:18,335 --> 01:18:21,675
Speaker 5:  If we could title this episode of the podcast, the Ash Chin situation,

1448
01:18:22,275 --> 01:18:23,915
Speaker 5:  I would very much appreciate that.

1449
01:18:25,215 --> 01:18:29,195
Speaker 3:  That'd be great for SEO no one's Google and Ashton situations.

1450
01:18:30,065 --> 01:18:33,995
Speaker 5:  Mine is, I was picking between two Google things. One is that now you can

1451
01:18:33,995 --> 01:18:37,835
Speaker 5:  put the Chrome URL bar on iOS down at the bottom. Most controversial

1452
01:18:38,075 --> 01:18:40,795
Speaker 5:  decision on the internet for a while there, if you guys remember. But the

1453
01:18:40,795 --> 01:18:44,435
Speaker 5:  one I ended up choosing was Google is now selling

1454
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:47,995
Speaker 5:  like in pre registries NG domains.

1455
01:18:48,915 --> 01:18:51,395
Speaker 5:  A fun fact about me is I'm obsessed with domain names. I find them totally

1456
01:18:51,715 --> 01:18:55,635
Speaker 5:  fascinating. And there was this thing like 10 years ago where ICAN was like,

1457
01:18:55,635 --> 01:18:59,075
Speaker 5:  we're gonna put out a million new kinds of domains. You can be pizza, you

1458
01:18:59,075 --> 01:19:02,995
Speaker 5:  can be restaurant, you can be online. And we're gonna reinvent the way people

1459
01:19:02,995 --> 01:19:06,955
Speaker 5:  think about web webpages. Instead of trying to be a.com, you can

1460
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:10,875
Speaker 5:  just be You know Alfredo's Pizza and that's

1461
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:14,835
Speaker 5:  your restaurant. That didn't work at all. And if you go to like

1462
01:19:15,355 --> 01:19:18,395
Speaker 5:  a messaging system or email or Slack or whatever, most of those don't even

1463
01:19:18,395 --> 01:19:22,355
Speaker 5:  show up as URLs, which I would argue is like pretty spectacular failure.

1464
01:19:22,775 --> 01:19:26,155
Speaker 5:  So now Google's out here trying to make IG happen and their thing is like,

1465
01:19:26,155 --> 01:19:30,075
Speaker 5:  if you want it to be You know, if you're a flight booking company,

1466
01:19:30,095 --> 01:19:33,995
Speaker 5:  you do book IG or Fly I Nng and

1467
01:19:33,995 --> 01:19:37,955
Speaker 5:  they're charging a ton of money for it. R dot i nng, which would be

1468
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:41,435
Speaker 5:  ring obviously. It's like if you wanna, if you're Victoria, not Victoria's

1469
01:19:41,435 --> 01:19:45,235
Speaker 5:  Secret. If you're Tiffany's or whoever, $130,000 a year for this

1470
01:19:45,235 --> 01:19:47,675
Speaker 5:  domain name. And I just think, whoa,

1471
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:48,675
Speaker 3:  Google

1472
01:19:48,775 --> 01:19:51,875
Speaker 5:  Has been way out in front of these. They're called top level domains or TLDs

1473
01:19:51,975 --> 01:19:55,955
Speaker 5:  and all these like alternate TLDs. Google has been out in front of for

1474
01:19:55,955 --> 01:19:59,275
Speaker 5:  forever. XYZ has actually been fairly successful as a kind of

1475
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:03,555
Speaker 5:  catchall thing. AI had a moment, social has kind of had a

1476
01:20:03,555 --> 01:20:06,475
Speaker 5:  moment. And now Google is gonna try really, really, really hard to make

1477
01:20:07,565 --> 01:20:08,605
Speaker 5:  ing a thing.

1478
01:20:09,165 --> 01:20:12,645
Speaker 4:  I, I really want to have They see me roll

1479
01:20:13,205 --> 01:20:15,005
Speaker 5:  Ing. That's very good. Alex, but that's

1480
01:20:15,005 --> 01:20:16,365
Speaker 4:  Very good. I don't have i's

1481
01:20:16,365 --> 01:20:18,005
Speaker 3:  Like $200,000 a year.

1482
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:20,405
Speaker 4:  Like Neli can, can I have some money?

1483
01:20:22,205 --> 01:20:23,205
Speaker 4:  I got an idea. Wait,

1484
01:20:23,205 --> 01:20:25,365
Speaker 3:  Didn't Google leave the domains business?

1485
01:20:26,185 --> 01:20:30,125
Speaker 5:  Google Domains business I had not even sold. I think just gave to Squarespace,

1486
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:34,285
Speaker 5:  which some people are very mad about. Yeah. But it still has,

1487
01:20:34,465 --> 01:20:38,365
Speaker 5:  its like overarching TLD registry thing.

1488
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:42,445
Speaker 5:  So it it like administers these domain names but it doesn't Gotcha. Do the

1489
01:20:42,825 --> 01:20:45,085
Speaker 5:  buying and selling and management of them, are

1490
01:20:45,085 --> 01:20:46,725
Speaker 3:  They gonna have message ing?

1491
01:20:48,705 --> 01:20:49,405
Speaker 4:  That's a good one.

1492
01:20:49,405 --> 01:20:53,125
Speaker 3:  They should just call it Gchat. Just put it, put the,

1493
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:57,125
Speaker 3:  put full manifestation. Just call it Gchat. All

1494
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,765
Speaker 3:  will be forgiven. The government will give up your, their antitrust trials.

1495
01:21:00,415 --> 01:21:03,925
Speaker 3:  We'll stop covering SEO. Just call it Gchat.

1496
01:21:04,015 --> 01:21:05,245
Speaker 4:  We're so easily bought.

1497
01:21:06,465 --> 01:21:09,805
Speaker 3:  That's that's your disclosure. If they just call it Gchat, we'll back all

1498
01:21:09,805 --> 01:21:13,325
Speaker 3:  the way off. Huh? Deal. No deal.

1499
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:18,965
Speaker 3:  Last one I wanna call out. X had its first all hands with Elon and

1500
01:21:18,965 --> 01:21:22,925
Speaker 3:  Linda Yao. Alex Heath has the full transcript of that

1501
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:26,485
Speaker 3:  meeting. You should go read it Just to witness

1502
01:21:26,745 --> 01:21:30,645
Speaker 3:  the wild vacillations of Elon making stuff up and

1503
01:21:30,645 --> 01:21:34,485
Speaker 3:  Linda having to pretend it was part of the plan. Yep. There's one point

1504
01:21:34,485 --> 01:21:37,285
Speaker 3:  where I don't remember exactly what he was saying, but Elon was like, I'd

1505
01:21:37,285 --> 01:21:40,125
Speaker 3:  like to start with this. and it was obviously a surprise to her and she was

1506
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:44,005
Speaker 3:  like, I'd raise my hand to be a part of that. Perfect. Yeah,

1507
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:44,765
Speaker 3:  perfect.

1508
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:51,445
Speaker 3:  It's very good. That's what you want out of your CEO. Just complete

1509
01:21:51,445 --> 01:21:52,725
Speaker 3:  befuddlement and surprise

1510
01:21:53,595 --> 01:21:54,165
Speaker 4:  Love chaos.

1511
01:21:54,425 --> 01:21:56,765
Speaker 3:  That's a good piece. We got a bunch of good stuff on the site this week.

1512
01:21:57,825 --> 01:22:01,645
Speaker 3:  Liz. In addition to the things people are very unhappy about, Liz

1513
01:22:01,665 --> 01:22:05,565
Speaker 3:  has been covering the FDX trial. Sam Bankman Free was

1514
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:09,365
Speaker 3:  on the stand. He is lighting himself on fire.

1515
01:22:09,395 --> 01:22:12,965
Speaker 3:  There's no other way to describe what is happening in this trial. That dude's

1516
01:22:12,965 --> 01:22:15,445
Speaker 3:  gonna jail. But you should read the coverage 'cause Liz is a great writer

1517
01:22:15,465 --> 01:22:17,365
Speaker 3:  and she's having the time of her life covering this trial.

1518
01:22:17,505 --> 01:22:20,925
Speaker 5:  And also it's probably gonna be over very, there's, there's a non-zero chance

1519
01:22:20,925 --> 01:22:23,845
Speaker 5:  that by the time you're listening to this, that a verdict has come in.

1520
01:22:25,105 --> 01:22:27,205
Speaker 5:  And we're gonna talk about that on the show next week for

1521
01:22:27,205 --> 01:22:28,045
Speaker 3:  Sure. Yeah. And

1522
01:22:30,595 --> 01:22:31,485
Speaker 3:  it's gonna be guilty.

1523
01:22:32,565 --> 01:22:33,685
Speaker 5:  I agree with that. It

1524
01:22:33,685 --> 01:22:37,205
Speaker 3:  Would be a shock if it was not. We have a great video

1525
01:22:37,395 --> 01:22:40,205
Speaker 3:  Andy Hawkins made about delivery robots, which is very cool. You should go

1526
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:43,525
Speaker 3:  watch that. Like I said, Becca won an Emmy this week, which is incredible.

1527
01:22:43,865 --> 01:22:47,525
Speaker 3:  Go watch some full frame in celebration. And then like I said, we've talked

1528
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:49,805
Speaker 3:  about this whole, we have a big feature this week on SE. You should go read

1529
01:22:49,805 --> 01:22:53,725
Speaker 3:  it. We'll link it in the show notes. And then speaking of Andy, he has

1530
01:22:53,725 --> 01:22:57,405
Speaker 3:  a great piece about the EV transition and the weird liminal spot it's in

1531
01:22:57,895 --> 01:23:01,845
Speaker 3:  right now where it seems like it's ready to start happening. But instead

1532
01:23:02,445 --> 01:23:05,900
Speaker 3:  cul culture, war instead culture, war America 2023.

1533
01:23:06,545 --> 01:23:09,245
Speaker 3:  Go read that. But it's also, the car makers have kind of blown it, right?

1534
01:23:09,245 --> 01:23:12,925
Speaker 3:  They assumed that all the demand for Teslas could be applied to their existing

1535
01:23:13,205 --> 01:23:16,365
Speaker 3:  business models. And so they made big stupid trucks

1536
01:23:17,115 --> 01:23:20,645
Speaker 3:  instead of like little EVs that people wanna buy like hundred

1537
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:24,805
Speaker 3:  like Chevys. Like look at our a hundred thousand dollars Silverado instead

1538
01:23:24,805 --> 01:23:28,485
Speaker 3:  of look at our bolt. Which is I, it feels like an error.

1539
01:23:28,515 --> 01:23:32,325
Speaker 3:  Like the people who wanna buy EVs are not up there. Yeah. Anyway,

1540
01:23:32,325 --> 01:23:34,765
Speaker 3:  that's a great piece because you'll read it and there's also obviously some

1541
01:23:34,925 --> 01:23:38,565
Speaker 3:  coverage of charging networks in there. And lastly, before we break, we

1542
01:23:38,975 --> 01:23:41,895
Speaker 3:  wanna know how you feel about the Red Chest on YouTube, right? Watching it

1543
01:23:42,235 --> 01:23:45,535
Speaker 3:  on YouTube. Are you catching the Easter eggs in the background or are you

1544
01:23:45,655 --> 01:23:47,855
Speaker 3:  sticking with the podcast player? What do you like about the show on YouTube?

1545
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:50,215
Speaker 3:  What don't you like? We know you want us to cut to more pictures of things

1546
01:23:50,215 --> 01:23:53,295
Speaker 3:  and add chapter, we'll do all that stuff. But beyond that, what do you want

1547
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:57,175
Speaker 3:  from us on YouTube? We're growing on YouTube. It's great. It's fun to be

1548
01:23:57,175 --> 01:23:59,815
Speaker 3:  in the comments on YouTube, but we wanna make it better. Let us know what

1549
01:23:59,815 --> 01:24:02,095
Speaker 3:  you think in the comments on YouTube

1550
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:04,015
Speaker 9:  Bringing the multiple Astons to

1551
01:24:04,015 --> 01:24:07,495
Speaker 3:  YouTube. Amazing. That's it. Thank you so much.

1552
01:24:07,765 --> 01:24:08,055
