Description: This week on The Vergecast, the co-founder and former CEO of iRobot, Colin Angle, joins The Verge’s smart home reviewer, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, to discuss what the ideal home robot is. Are we close to creating a Rosie the Robot — an all-in-one humanoid robot that can take care of our homes, or should we take an entirely different approach to home robotics? They dive into the advances in technology powering this shift and ponder what purpose robotics in the home should really serve.

Then, Jen takes a journey back into smart home history to help us understand its future. Grant Erickson, Principal of Nuovations, a former Apple, Nest, and Google engineer who was part of the team that developed Thread, joins the show.

He shares the story of how and why, back in 2011, the Nest team, led by Tony Faddell and Matt Rogers, decided to create a smart home protocol. It involves a thermostat, fragmented ecosystems, and one of the best smart home products ever made.

They discuss how Thread became the foundation of the Matter smart home standard — an unprecedented industry collaboration with a herculean task — to make the smart home simpler.

To close out the show, Grant sticks around to help answer a Vergecast hotline question (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com) about how Matter manages your data.

00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:07,235
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Why Matter Matters.

3
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:11,675
Speaker 2:  No matter what David Pierce has to say about it. I'm your friend, Jen

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:15,155
Speaker 2:  Tuey, the Verges senior smart home reviewer, and today

5
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:19,195
Speaker 2:  we're talking about the future. First, the founder of

6
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:23,675
Speaker 2:  iRobot joins me to talk about how close we're to an all

7
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:27,195
Speaker 2:  in one robot that will take care of all our household needs,

8
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:31,275
Speaker 2:  but more importantly, whether that's what we really want. Then

9
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,195
Speaker 2:  we'll turn to the future of the Smart Home Grant. Erickson, a

10
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:39,075
Speaker 2:  former Apple Nest and Google engineer joins me to talk

11
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:42,595
Speaker 2:  about how and really why they decided to build

12
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:46,835
Speaker 2:  yet another Smart Home Protocol Thread. This is

13
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,475
Speaker 2:  The Vergecast Stay tuned

14
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:34,805
Speaker 2:  futuristic version of the Flintstones Set. In

15
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,845
Speaker 2:  2060s, there were flying cars that folded

16
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:42,365
Speaker 2:  up into briefcases 3D food printers, and my favorite,

17
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,365
Speaker 2:  a robot made named Rosie. It's

18
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,285
Speaker 6:  Time to blast off for dreamland. Well, okay, if Rosie

19
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:53,205
Speaker 6:  tucks me in and tells me about the cow that they gravitated over the moon,

20
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:57,285
Speaker 6:  miss, I got it here too. Will you, Rosie? Yes, ma'am.

21
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:00,965
Speaker 6:  Thank you, ma'am. Goodnight ma'am.

22
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:05,285
Speaker 2:  Rosie was a big blue metal robot that rolled around on wheels.

23
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:09,205
Speaker 2:  She had dials for eyes and claws for hands, and a pretty little

24
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:13,165
Speaker 2:  apron. She cleaned the house, took care of the kids, and even

25
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:17,045
Speaker 2:  functioned as a security system. Now Rosie inspired a

26
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,885
Speaker 2:  generation of roboticists to create home robots.

27
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:25,205
Speaker 2:  Today we have robots that vacuum your floor. We have ones that scoop

28
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,525
Speaker 2:  your kitty litter, mow your lawn, even wash your windows.

29
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:32,085
Speaker 2:  But we don't have a rosy, at least not yet.

30
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:36,765
Speaker 2:  So is a humanoid helper robot something we

31
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:40,445
Speaker 2:  could actually achieve? And maybe more importantly,

32
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:44,445
Speaker 2:  is it something we actually want to answer these questions? I

33
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:47,645
Speaker 2:  invited a leading expert on home robotics to join me.

34
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:52,005
Speaker 2:  Colin Angle is the co-founder and former CEO of one of the world's

35
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:56,005
Speaker 2:  first robotics companies, iRobot. And while

36
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:59,925
Speaker 2:  it became known best for its Roomba robot vacuums, iRobot

37
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:03,485
Speaker 2:  was originally founded to develop robots for all sorts of applications.

38
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,645
Speaker 2:  From exploring Mars to building stair climbing robots for the military,

39
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,605
Speaker 2:  essentially angle in his co-founders, all MIT

40
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:15,525
Speaker 2:  roboticists laid the foundation for the robotic future we

41
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,555
Speaker 2:  may all be living in one day. Hello, Colin, thank you so much

42
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,275
Speaker 2:  for joining me. It's great to see you.

43
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:23,995
Speaker 7:  I'm happy to be chatting once again with you.

44
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,595
Speaker 2:  It's been a while since we talked. You've been under the radar

45
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,675
Speaker 2:  a bit since stepping down from iRobot last year, following this sale to

46
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:36,635
Speaker 2:  Amazon, falling through. But I understand you're still working in robotics

47
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:40,875
Speaker 2:  with a new startup called Familiar Machines and Magic.

48
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:44,115
Speaker 2:  How much can you tell us right now about what, what you're working on?

49
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:49,085
Speaker 7:  Not very much. I mean, darn, we're, we're, we're still in, in stealth mode,

50
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:53,085
Speaker 7:  but I think that it'll be fun to be

51
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:57,005
Speaker 7:  able to sort of pull back the veil, you know, as we get

52
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,925
Speaker 7:  toward the end of this year into the next year. And I think that if the name

53
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:04,685
Speaker 7:  is a bit intriguing, what we're doing will be even more so.

54
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:05,365
Speaker 7:  Ooh,

55
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:09,285
Speaker 2:  Good tease for the future. We'll definitely have you back on when we can

56
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:13,085
Speaker 2:  talk more, but today we wanna, we wanna talk about what's going on now, right.

57
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:16,805
Speaker 2:  Today in the state of home robotics. So just to sort of kick us off,

58
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:21,205
Speaker 2:  I kind of wanted to start by getting your thoughts on, on the, the current

59
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:25,245
Speaker 2:  home robotics field, you know, what's good in the space today, what's

60
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,605
Speaker 2:  bad, and, you know, what is the potential here to be

61
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:31,245
Speaker 2:  really game changing in home robotics?

62
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:35,935
Speaker 7:  So, you know, a a, you know, Wiley

63
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:39,895
Speaker 7:  Coyote Acme robotics kit was just dropped

64
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:43,975
Speaker 7:  from the heavens on us, so, you know, a year or two ago. And, and

65
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:47,735
Speaker 7:  that obviously was generative AI and

66
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:51,695
Speaker 7:  its remarkable ability to impact

67
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:56,095
Speaker 7:  the entire field of robotics. But even before generative

68
00:05:56,195 --> 00:06:00,165
Speaker 7:  ai, I think that the, the industry wr large has been,

69
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:04,045
Speaker 7:  you know, struggled with what is the role

70
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:08,925
Speaker 7:  of robotics in our home, in our everyday

71
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:12,885
Speaker 7:  lives. You know, I I, you know, back when we founded iRobot, if you say,

72
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:16,365
Speaker 7:  okay, 35 years would go by and

73
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:19,445
Speaker 7:  the best we had was

74
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,285
Speaker 7:  mainstream floor care. I think that

75
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:28,065
Speaker 7:  I and everyone else who heard that answer would be up in arms

76
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:32,385
Speaker 7:  in violent disappointment that we couldn't do more,

77
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,585
Speaker 7:  more rapidly. Yeah, I think we're still learning,

78
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:40,945
Speaker 7:  and even though we have great new tools, we

79
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:44,665
Speaker 7:  shouldn't forget that we hadn't finished learning the first set of

80
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,415
Speaker 7:  lessons even prior to getting these new tools.

81
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:52,935
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And now obviously generative AI seems like it's gonna be a big game

82
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:56,655
Speaker 2:  changer for robotics, And I definitely wanna dive a little

83
00:06:56,655 --> 00:07:00,575
Speaker 2:  deeper into that or a lot deeper into that. But just in terms of like the

84
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:04,295
Speaker 2:  space today, where do you feel like

85
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:09,135
Speaker 2:  most people have embraced home robotics? I think, I think a

86
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:12,535
Speaker 2:  lot of people don't really realize how many robots they actually have

87
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,535
Speaker 2:  in their home today. Yeah. I mean,

88
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:18,455
Speaker 7:  It, it, it gets at what is your definition of a robot, obviously.

89
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,375
Speaker 2:  Yes, exactly. What is yours?

90
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,215
Speaker 7:  You know, I, I've gone through many different

91
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,935
Speaker 7:  generations of, of answering of that question. You know, it, it started out

92
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:32,815
Speaker 7:  with a robot is something that can perceive its environment. Think about

93
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:36,615
Speaker 7:  it, what's it has perceived, and then take in an

94
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:40,255
Speaker 7:  action based on that thinking. But by that definition,

95
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:43,855
Speaker 7:  virtually every device that we have in our world is a robot.

96
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:48,295
Speaker 7:  And I was forced to say, okay, that doesn't quite work anymore. At least

97
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:52,895
Speaker 7:  it doesn't fit with my gut definition. And,

98
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:56,895
Speaker 7:  and evolve to, you know, a robot is

99
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,855
Speaker 7:  a machine you name as a imperfect but

100
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:05,465
Speaker 7:  more accurate description of, of what a robot

101
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:09,225
Speaker 7:  might mean. Because I think that there's an

102
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:13,065
Speaker 7:  aspect of the, of my interpretation of what robot

103
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:17,235
Speaker 7:  means that involves a human connection of

104
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:20,875
Speaker 7:  some sort. And the, that human

105
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:24,075
Speaker 7:  connection is crucial

106
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,715
Speaker 7:  in a class of machine, which goes

107
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:32,795
Speaker 7:  beyond pure function into support

108
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:36,355
Speaker 7:  and relationship. And so by that

109
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:40,315
Speaker 7:  definition, there's a lot fewer robots out there, and there

110
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:43,155
Speaker 7:  may be some things that are technologically

111
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:47,665
Speaker 7:  simple and yet fit the definition.

112
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:50,625
Speaker 2:  Thi this is something that I've been struggling with and one of the reasons

113
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:54,265
Speaker 2:  I wanted to have you on to really dive into this. So I've spent a lot of

114
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:57,725
Speaker 2:  time with the robots that you were originally describing, not the ones that

115
00:08:57,765 --> 00:09:01,685
Speaker 2:  I necessarily named. So like the vacuums, the robot lawn mowers, the

116
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,405
Speaker 2:  robot kitty litter, things that have a purpose and have some

117
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:08,405
Speaker 2:  intelligence because they know to do something at a certain time or when

118
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:12,325
Speaker 2:  something happens, rather than me having to direct it, then we've,

119
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:16,005
Speaker 2:  you know, anyone that's been in the smart home at all, the dream that's sort

120
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:19,885
Speaker 2:  of been forced on us has always been this rosy, the robot, she

121
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:23,605
Speaker 2:  was a character in a cartoon, the Jetsons from the sixties

122
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:27,405
Speaker 2:  that has sort of long been held up, not so much as what we

123
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:30,925
Speaker 2:  ultimately want in a robot, but sort of an inspirational

124
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:35,245
Speaker 2:  device for what we may see in our home. A

125
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:39,965
Speaker 2:  multimodal humanoid robot that can do

126
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:43,725
Speaker 2:  chores for us, that can do the laundry, that can wash the windows, that can

127
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:47,165
Speaker 2:  make dinner, that can play with the kid, that can do, do these

128
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:51,085
Speaker 2:  chores. And, and, and then as you say, and in, in the Jetsons, this is

129
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:54,925
Speaker 2:  very, very much part of the character becomes part of the

130
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:57,925
Speaker 2:  family. And that's, you know, that's an, that's an area where it starts to

131
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:01,325
Speaker 2:  obviously get to another level. But in terms of the actual

132
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:05,005
Speaker 2:  technical achievement that we are looking at towards getting

133
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,405
Speaker 2:  a humanoid robot in our home, a rosy, the robot

134
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:13,605
Speaker 2:  inspired robot, do you feel like we are close to that?

135
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:17,845
Speaker 2:  And if, if yes, if not, what is the tech that's kind of

136
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:20,165
Speaker 2:  pushing us to that? And do we want that?

137
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:25,245
Speaker 7:  Well, I think that the, do we want that or when do we want

138
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:28,965
Speaker 7:  that is maybe the more interesting question

139
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:32,045
Speaker 7:  from the can we

140
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:32,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

141
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:36,655
Speaker 7:  Because you know, it is certainly

142
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:41,215
Speaker 7:  within the realm of technology that exists today

143
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,975
Speaker 7:  to do something rosy. Like, could we build

144
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:45,735
Speaker 7:  such a thing?

145
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:46,535
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

146
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,435
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You could build that. Is there a demand for it or is it

147
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:55,645
Speaker 7:  what we really want today? No, not at all.

148
00:10:56,645 --> 00:11:00,605
Speaker 7:  Humanity has a long way to go before Rosie

149
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:05,285
Speaker 7:  is what we really want. In fact, one of my

150
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:08,845
Speaker 7:  journey, my journey at, in, at iRobot, the question of

151
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,565
Speaker 7:  after vacuuming, what do people want?

152
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,605
Speaker 7:  And even within the realm of floor care, what did it

153
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:21,485
Speaker 7:  take to grow to the point we are today

154
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:25,165
Speaker 7:  where robot vacuuming is generally

155
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:29,325
Speaker 7:  accepted as a mainstream alternative to upright

156
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,845
Speaker 7:  vacuuming? One of the things that I got most wrong

157
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:37,045
Speaker 7:  in the early days of Roomba was imagining

158
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:41,645
Speaker 7:  that the perfect Roomba was a Roomba. You never saw, you never touched,

159
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:45,005
Speaker 7:  you just came home every day to a perfectly clean home.

160
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:49,525
Speaker 7:  And that was completely wrong. The perfect Roomba was the

161
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:53,285
Speaker 7:  Roomba that cleaned around your kitchen table, did a great

162
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:57,185
Speaker 7:  job eventually earning your trust that it

163
00:11:57,185 --> 00:12:00,625
Speaker 7:  could actually do that job, at which point you would give it

164
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:04,265
Speaker 7:  permission to clean the rest of the kitchen, at which point,

165
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:07,705
Speaker 7:  after proving that it could successfully clean the kitchen,

166
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:12,585
Speaker 7:  you would give it permission to do more. And so that

167
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,625
Speaker 7:  people don't instantly trust technology.

168
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:18,225
Speaker 2:  That's very true.

169
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:22,585
Speaker 7:  And so that this fundamental disconnect between what is technologically easy

170
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:25,625
Speaker 7:  and what do people want their technology to do,

171
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:30,465
Speaker 7:  create real barriers to progressing

172
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:33,665
Speaker 7:  down the path of customer acceptance.

173
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:38,305
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean, your example there of saying, well, I, I'll try one thing and

174
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:41,465
Speaker 2:  if it does it well, I might let it do the next thing that I can see that

175
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,465
Speaker 2:  logic. And, but we are seeing companies with

176
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,985
Speaker 2:  these humanoid robots, In fact just recently figure,

177
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:52,625
Speaker 2:  they're really all really pushing hard on

178
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:56,705
Speaker 2:  their own generative AI models that use vision,

179
00:12:57,105 --> 00:13:01,025
Speaker 2:  language action to create these humanoid robots. They have a video

180
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:05,185
Speaker 2:  where gentlemen is told these two robots to put the groceries away and

181
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,825
Speaker 2:  they, you we see these humanoid robots actually sorting the

182
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:12,625
Speaker 2:  groceries, passing them back and forth to each other, putting them

183
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:16,345
Speaker 2:  in, you know, the fridge or in the pantry. If these

184
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:20,305
Speaker 2:  humanoid robots could really do so much more for people in their homes,

185
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:24,825
Speaker 2:  I think I could see where people might be drawn to them. Right now

186
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:28,945
Speaker 2:  we're not spending $10,000 for, for a robot to

187
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:32,625
Speaker 2:  do this, but this kind of is the, you know, the future Rosie,

188
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:35,945
Speaker 2:  the Rosie that, I guess when we're talking about the science fiction of the

189
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:39,505
Speaker 2:  humanoid robot, this is probably what people envision. What do you think

190
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:43,305
Speaker 2:  about this type of robot? I mean there's the Tesla Optimus, there's Boston

191
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:47,225
Speaker 2:  Dynamics Atlas. I mean, we've seen these being developed and

192
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,585
Speaker 2:  although mostly for industrial applications, you know,

193
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:55,705
Speaker 2:  figure and Tesla have very much expressed their desire

194
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:57,225
Speaker 2:  to push into the home. So

195
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:01,985
Speaker 7:  I mean, technologically, this is a marvel. I mean this is

196
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,265
Speaker 7:  incredibly exciting, but is it a product

197
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:10,605
Speaker 7:  that people want? Yeah. And if so, why?

198
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:15,685
Speaker 7:  You know, it's, that's a completely different question. And and forgetting

199
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:19,325
Speaker 7:  to get good answers to that question can lead you to,

200
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:24,805
Speaker 7:  you know, making some mistakes as far as where you put

201
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:28,125
Speaker 7:  your energy. Yeah. So I mean I'm, I think that is a

202
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,965
Speaker 7:  magnificent video of robotic competence.

203
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:36,525
Speaker 7:  I think it is irrelevant from the perspective of

204
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:41,485
Speaker 7:  any kind of realistic vision for robots in

205
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:45,245
Speaker 7:  the home. Yeah. Because it's, is that really

206
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:45,725
Speaker 7:  a problem?

207
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:50,245
Speaker 2:  Right. Most of us could put our groceries away relatively easily.

208
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,605
Speaker 7:  You know, at iRobot we would create a graph where

209
00:14:56,785 --> 00:15:00,245
Speaker 7:  on one axis of the graph it was activities,

210
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:04,685
Speaker 7:  the frequency with which an activity was done in the home.

211
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,885
Speaker 7:  And then on the other graph was how much was that activity

212
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:10,005
Speaker 7:  hated,

213
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:13,045
Speaker 7:  you know? And so that if

214
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:14,605
Speaker 2:  Emptying the dishwasher,

215
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:19,645
Speaker 7:  Well, I mean, so emptying the dishwasher, okay, there's something that's

216
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:20,365
Speaker 7:  disliked

217
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:21,645
Speaker 2:  And done frequently.

218
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:26,165
Speaker 7:  Okay. And, you know, vacuuming

219
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:30,765
Speaker 7:  was done also frequently and

220
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:34,805
Speaker 7:  disliked mopping was disliked so much that

221
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:38,045
Speaker 7:  it wasn't done frequently. And people would

222
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:42,245
Speaker 7:  value the mopping robot far, far less

223
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:46,765
Speaker 7:  than the vacuuming robot, simply because they had trained

224
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:49,965
Speaker 7:  themselves to be okay without mopping

225
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:53,365
Speaker 7:  every day. And so that they, they sort of mentally

226
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,245
Speaker 2:  Didn't have to be done. It didn't feel like it had to be done.

227
00:15:56,245 --> 00:16:00,205
Speaker 7:  It had to be done so that, you know, and ultimately mopping as a standalone

228
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:03,765
Speaker 7:  robot failed, it became at best

229
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,165
Speaker 7:  differentiator if you could buy a vacuum that mopped two

230
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:12,685
Speaker 7:  that was better than a vacuum that didn't mop. And so it was a

231
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:15,845
Speaker 7:  secondary feature that had some differentiating benefit.

232
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,165
Speaker 7:  And you know, you, you talk about emptying the dishwasher. I mean, I think

233
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:24,005
Speaker 7:  that's interesting because it is done frequently and it is

234
00:16:24,245 --> 00:16:27,405
Speaker 7:  disliked, in which case you say, okay, well how much

235
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:32,065
Speaker 7:  would you be willing to pay to not have

236
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:32,665
Speaker 7:  to do that?

237
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:34,665
Speaker 7:  And

238
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:37,505
Speaker 2:  $20, that's how much I pay my daughter a month,

239
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:41,305
Speaker 7:  $20 a month to empty the

240
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:44,425
Speaker 2:  Dishwash. Not the same as buying a humanoid robot from Tesla.

241
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,625
Speaker 7:  I mean, this is where it gets hard.

242
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:47,305
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

243
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:51,955
Speaker 7:  You know, and, and trying, you know, I think that it makes

244
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:55,755
Speaker 7:  sense to me that so much energy is going into sort of

245
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:59,875
Speaker 7:  B2B applications. Yeah. Because you can sit down

246
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,595
Speaker 7:  with a spreadsheet and you can decide

247
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:07,835
Speaker 7:  what needs to be true in order for your

248
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:11,955
Speaker 7:  robot to be economically viable. Now you may not like

249
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:15,555
Speaker 7:  that math, but at least it's doable math.

250
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:19,745
Speaker 7:  Yeah. You know, and when you start to say,

251
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:23,185
Speaker 7:  okay, let's just vision cast into the home

252
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,865
Speaker 7:  where we can make some holy cow, that's ridiculously

253
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:31,625
Speaker 7:  awesome kinds of videos, but does that translate

254
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:35,625
Speaker 7:  into people opening their wallet for it? Yeah.

255
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:39,625
Speaker 7:  You know, that's a whole different world that

256
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:44,115
Speaker 7:  the industry of physical AI is going to have to be very careful of

257
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,835
Speaker 7:  or else, you know, we're going to be sitting, you

258
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,045
Speaker 7:  know, 10, 20 years from now feeling like,

259
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:56,325
Speaker 7:  gee, not much progress has been made because

260
00:17:57,265 --> 00:18:01,125
Speaker 7:  not many of these robots have been sold. And the other thing that

261
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:05,125
Speaker 7:  is, you know, I've been on both sides of, but I sort of had

262
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,765
Speaker 7:  to based on brutal experience,

263
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:12,765
Speaker 7:  except the fact that general purpose robotics

264
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:17,485
Speaker 7:  doesn't translate well into product.

265
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:18,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

266
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:22,725
Speaker 7:  Meaning that if you said, well, putting away the dishes is worth $20

267
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:26,765
Speaker 7:  a month, folding the laundry is worth $30 a month, pushing

268
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:30,845
Speaker 7:  a vacuum cleaner is worth $5 a month. And so that the

269
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,885
Speaker 7:  value of this robot is the sum of all those values

270
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:39,405
Speaker 7:  doesn't actually work, at least not in traditional

271
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:43,925
Speaker 7:  consumer behavior. And so that it's more like add up all the applications

272
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:47,165
Speaker 7:  and if five of them then divide by five

273
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:51,725
Speaker 7:  or pick the one that the consumer's gonna actually

274
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:55,725
Speaker 7:  want, and then that's the value. And So if you had all these things, one

275
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:59,325
Speaker 7:  of them was the, the $5 push of vacuum, then It could be

276
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:03,565
Speaker 7:  the $5 is the perceived value. And people don't do

277
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:07,885
Speaker 7:  summation of benefit math in their head very

278
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:09,045
Speaker 7:  well.

279
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:13,765
Speaker 2:  You know, you're talking here about how we should focus on the use case,

280
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:18,205
Speaker 2:  but there is a lot of interest in some type of

281
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:22,685
Speaker 2:  sentient robot in our homes. I mean we have seen

282
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,285
Speaker 2:  in the last five or six years more recently,

283
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:30,845
Speaker 2:  Samsung, lg, Amazon, all coming up with their

284
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:34,245
Speaker 2:  own home robot that doesn't really do anything

285
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:39,685
Speaker 2:  but does have a position in the home. And, and what

286
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:43,485
Speaker 2:  that position in the home is is still very fuzzy.

287
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:47,845
Speaker 2:  We've got Samsung's barley and then Amazon's

288
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:51,765
Speaker 2:  Astro, which I actually tested in my home and it was very cute and it had

289
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:54,805
Speaker 2:  a lot of personality. To your point earlier about having something in your

290
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:58,005
Speaker 2:  home that you have a connection with.

291
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,205
Speaker 2:  Our former deputy editor, Dan Seaford, actually described that

292
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:06,205
Speaker 2:  astro as a love child between a Roomba and an Echo show smart display,

293
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,805
Speaker 2:  which I think was the best way of suming summarizing that creature,

294
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:13,325
Speaker 2:  except for it couldn't vacuum, it didn't have an actual

295
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:17,525
Speaker 2:  obvious purpose. We've seen Apple has been working on

296
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:21,565
Speaker 2:  as a tabletop robot with sort of

297
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:24,885
Speaker 2:  personality, they did a whole sort of white paper on

298
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:29,805
Speaker 2:  investigating the value of having sort of a connection to the

299
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,125
Speaker 2:  robot. Yeah. And when you were a iRobot, you And I talked about

300
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:37,525
Speaker 2:  this a few times, you were developing something called an iRobot os, which

301
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:40,965
Speaker 2:  was, which is still, you know, something that the robots have rumors have

302
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:44,645
Speaker 2:  worked on for the last few years, an operating system. And it gives the

303
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,510
Speaker 2:  robots, and these were your words at the time, I think like, like a deeper

304
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,285
Speaker 2:  understanding of your home and your habits so that they can clean harder

305
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:55,285
Speaker 2:  and smarter. So, and at the time, I think when this happened, I

306
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:58,845
Speaker 2:  surmised that this was one of the reasons that Amazon wanted to buy

307
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:02,845
Speaker 2:  iRobot because it was creating this kind of purpose

308
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:07,565
Speaker 2:  for robotics in the home. Like a central intelligence,

309
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:11,605
Speaker 2:  I suppose, of your smart home, a robot that knew what was

310
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:15,445
Speaker 2:  happening in your home. So do you think that kind of central

311
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:19,005
Speaker 2:  intelligent device in the home is kind of the key to

312
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:22,845
Speaker 2:  unlocking that value of the domestic robot? Is that what l LG and

313
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:26,765
Speaker 2:  Samsung and Amazon are sort of working towards and what's

314
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:28,165
Speaker 2:  that gonna look like when we get it?

315
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:32,885
Speaker 7:  It's a great question And I have many

316
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:36,605
Speaker 7:  opinions, but the, you know, to try to

317
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:40,325
Speaker 7:  unpack the question down to, you know, what was

318
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:44,165
Speaker 7:  iRobot os about, what might the smart home be?

319
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,845
Speaker 7:  You know, you brought up Rosie and, and if you talk to anyone

320
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:52,365
Speaker 7:  who has been living the smart home challenge,

321
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:58,365
Speaker 7:  there's a, a first question in approach. And that is,

322
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:01,885
Speaker 7:  are you trying to build Rosie the robot or the Starship Enterprise?

323
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:05,965
Speaker 2:  Yes. Well, and you know, that's what Amazon's trying to build with Alexa.

324
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,125
Speaker 2:  It's like these two things coming together. Right.

325
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:12,725
Speaker 7:  Well obviously, you know, Rosie, the robot would be the general

326
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:14,485
Speaker 7:  purpose robot that does everything in your home.

327
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:15,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

328
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:19,365
Speaker 7:  The Starship Enterprise is the home is the robot.

329
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,885
Speaker 7:  And so, you know, the Roomba is a, a white blood cell.

330
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:28,245
Speaker 7:  The thing that changes the thermostat is, is you know, a a, you know, a

331
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:32,005
Speaker 7:  control system in, in the body and, and you know, maybe the

332
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:35,645
Speaker 7:  eyelids or the opening and closing of the shades in your home. And the,

333
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:39,765
Speaker 7:  if you can think about the home as the

334
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:43,675
Speaker 7:  robot, then it leads you down a very

335
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:47,475
Speaker 7:  interesting path, which to date,

336
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:51,755
Speaker 7:  there's been a one of these barrier tapes across

337
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:56,115
Speaker 7:  after you take the first three steps and the barrier tape across

338
00:22:56,335 --> 00:23:00,115
Speaker 7:  the journey toward building the Starship Enterprise is

339
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:04,825
Speaker 7:  complexity overload. Right. I mean the Right, the you.

340
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:08,465
Speaker 7:  Okay, I love this idea. I'm just gonna go incrementally add things to my

341
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:12,425
Speaker 7:  home and when I have enough things, I'll be able

342
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:16,025
Speaker 7:  to say computer make my housework and

343
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:19,985
Speaker 7:  everything will, will magically happen. And I'll feel like I'm living

344
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:23,625
Speaker 7:  inside a caring dwelling that looks after me,

345
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:27,825
Speaker 7:  except for it doesn't work. The maintenance of

346
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:31,895
Speaker 7:  this home of the I as the robot concept

347
00:23:32,835 --> 00:23:36,815
Speaker 7:  has been blocked by complexity. So Acme

348
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:40,575
Speaker 7:  toolkit comes down, you need to have an

349
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:42,655
Speaker 7:  architect willing to

350
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:47,285
Speaker 7:  prioritize consumer experience over

351
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:51,125
Speaker 7:  inclusiveness and force

352
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:55,485
Speaker 7:  some of the, you know, that usability

353
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:59,085
Speaker 7:  magic that made the iPhone such a success.

354
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:03,565
Speaker 7:  And, you know, we can start to see

355
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:07,605
Speaker 7:  the Starship Enterprise take shape. And I think applying

356
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:11,525
Speaker 7:  generative ai, the, the ability to

357
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:15,645
Speaker 7:  unlock perception, to extract user

358
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:19,445
Speaker 7:  intent without burdening the user with complexity,

359
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,625
Speaker 7:  that is a very interesting journey.

360
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:28,345
Speaker 7:  And the cool thing about the home is the robot or the Starship

361
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:32,305
Speaker 7:  Enterprise metaphor is you already own the Starship Enterprise. And so

362
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:36,185
Speaker 7:  that you're just adding little things and so that some of the investment

363
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:40,225
Speaker 7:  dollars required can be minimized and, and

364
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:44,465
Speaker 7:  you can go buy the thing, the function you want to add your home and it just,

365
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:47,945
Speaker 7:  it can sort of incrementally do what you

366
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:52,425
Speaker 7:  expect. And so I feel like, you know, I'm not sure these

367
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:56,185
Speaker 7:  attempts at rolling something down the middle of the,

368
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,585
Speaker 7:  of Rosie and, and the Starship Enterprise are, are

369
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:03,745
Speaker 7:  strategies that I would advocate, you know, once you have the, the Starship

370
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:07,545
Speaker 7:  Enterprise, maybe there's a GS the butler that

371
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:11,825
Speaker 7:  has a role, but it's, its role is to interact with people.

372
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:15,785
Speaker 7:  And so go build it in a way that interacts with people. If that has

373
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:19,785
Speaker 7:  emerged as something being sufficiently valuable that people would pay

374
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:23,865
Speaker 7:  X thousand dollars to have that. And maybe that's the humanoid Yeah. 'cause

375
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:27,705
Speaker 7:  then it's the humanoid being used for its core

376
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:31,705
Speaker 7:  functionality. Yeah. And I think that that's an in very interesting

377
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:35,465
Speaker 7:  direction that I think the smart home

378
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:39,385
Speaker 7:  would go, but the common trip up

379
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:43,345
Speaker 7:  is everyone thinks they can run through that yellow barrier tape and it's

380
00:25:43,345 --> 00:25:46,985
Speaker 7:  just gonna be okay. And they get tangled and nearly

381
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:50,945
Speaker 7:  decapitated as a result of ignoring that being

382
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:53,945
Speaker 7:  fundamental problem of the Starship enterprise. The

383
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:54,745
Speaker 2:  Complexity

384
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:56,265
Speaker 7:  Complex. The complexity, yeah.

385
00:25:56,415 --> 00:26:00,065
Speaker 2:  Well, and now the Starship Enterprise was run by a central computer.

386
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:03,905
Speaker 2:  So for this home as a computer to work, we need that central

387
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:05,225
Speaker 2:  intelligence.

388
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:08,305
Speaker 7:  I mean, and that, and that's another benefit of the Starship Enterprise.

389
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:11,305
Speaker 7:  'cause that could be up in the cloud and be very

390
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:15,625
Speaker 7:  efficient. You know, it, you know, the most expensive possible thing to do

391
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:19,465
Speaker 7:  with that compute is put it on a wheeled platform or something. I mean

392
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,065
Speaker 7:  it's why would you do that?

393
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:24,865
Speaker 2:  Making it in. Yeah. But, but what we do have today already are voice

394
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:28,825
Speaker 2:  assistants and we are seeing the slow painful shift

395
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:32,985
Speaker 2:  of the voice assistant from the command and control device

396
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:36,265
Speaker 2:  like, like a robot command and control to the generative AI

397
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:40,265
Speaker 2:  intelligence infused voice assistant like Alexa Plus, which has

398
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:44,205
Speaker 2:  recently launched to some, and Google assistant and

399
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:48,045
Speaker 2:  Amazon, I mean, Apple's Siri is supposedly undergoing a transformation.

400
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:51,885
Speaker 2:  So is that really the rosy of the future? Like this sort of sentient

401
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:53,485
Speaker 2:  being in the home

402
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:57,685
Speaker 7:  If you buy into building the Starship enterprise? Yeah.

403
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:02,085
Speaker 7:  Then one of the best parts of the acne toolkit

404
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:07,205
Speaker 7:  is speaker independent natural language command and interface with

405
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:09,965
Speaker 7:  with the enterprise. Yes. Because

406
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,445
Speaker 2:  That's what I want.

407
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:15,365
Speaker 7:  Right. Right. I mean it's the, you know, we had

408
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:19,525
Speaker 7:  voice connection with Roomba for

409
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:24,125
Speaker 7:  a very, very long time and it was unfortunately

410
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,245
Speaker 7:  disappointing how rarely that got used.

411
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:31,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It had to be so precise. You had to remember the

412
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:34,925
Speaker 2:  exact phrasing. And I remember, I mean, Roomba had like, what, like 600

413
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:38,485
Speaker 2:  commands you could use, but no one can remember all of those.

414
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:39,125
Speaker 2:  So they

415
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,765
Speaker 7:  Would Well it was actually much, much, much larger than that because we,

416
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:45,685
Speaker 7:  we tried to imagine every possible way that you

417
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:47,805
Speaker 7:  could say, go clean the kitchen

418
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:52,645
Speaker 7:  and we thought we did a pretty good job, but you know,

419
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:56,365
Speaker 7:  98% accurate isn't good enough. Yeah.

420
00:27:57,145 --> 00:28:00,965
Speaker 7:  And it only takes a couple of failures before you never

421
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:04,765
Speaker 7:  do it again. Yeah. And so that this idea that with

422
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:08,525
Speaker 7:  generative ai, we can start having natural

423
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:12,525
Speaker 7:  language interfaces that actually work is going to unlock

424
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:14,925
Speaker 7:  usability. Yeah.

425
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:17,685
Speaker 2:  Breakthrough that yellow tape of complexity.

426
00:28:17,685 --> 00:28:20,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean the difference between 98% and

427
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:24,845
Speaker 7:  99.99% sounds little,

428
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:26,805
Speaker 7:  but it's transformational,

429
00:28:27,215 --> 00:28:28,885
Speaker 2:  Especially in a home environment.

430
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:32,725
Speaker 7:  You know, I I think that all of the lessons I'm voice

431
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:36,205
Speaker 7:  should be thrown out and we should start again

432
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:40,505
Speaker 7:  with the power of

433
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:44,425
Speaker 7:  actual natural language comprehension. Yeah.

434
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:48,785
Speaker 7:  Because there's, there's so many, well that didn't work well now they will.

435
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:53,065
Speaker 7:  And a lot of conviction around the limitations of

436
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:56,945
Speaker 7:  voice as interface needs to be completely rethought

437
00:28:57,685 --> 00:29:01,425
Speaker 7:  as it comes to how do humans and, and machines interact.

438
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:05,265
Speaker 7:  I think that's one of the exciting things to see. Yeah. And then translate

439
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:08,665
Speaker 7:  that over to machine vision and the amount of

440
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:12,465
Speaker 7:  perception that is capable, machines are capable now

441
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:16,345
Speaker 7:  is is a little night and day as well. Yeah. Okay. Now

442
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:17,585
Speaker 7:  go find the right application

443
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:21,545
Speaker 2:  That Well, and this comes back to the application And I get I that and that's,

444
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:24,505
Speaker 2:  it's a very good point. And I guess, I guess I have two more questions around

445
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:28,425
Speaker 2:  this for you before we let you go. So there's one that I wanna wrap

446
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:31,345
Speaker 2:  up with, but then there's one that I, I don't think my, any of the listeners

447
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:34,745
Speaker 2:  or my readers would forgive me if I didn't ask you about. Okay.

448
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:39,065
Speaker 2:  Is appendages robots with arms and legs,

449
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:43,085
Speaker 2:  we've already seen a robot vacuum manufacturers come out with an arm

450
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:47,005
Speaker 2:  to pick things up. Yep. That, I know you've told me in the past that you

451
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:50,165
Speaker 2:  guys, and you did actually develop a stair climbing robot, not for the home,

452
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:54,245
Speaker 2:  but for military applications. So if whether we are

453
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:58,005
Speaker 2:  talking about humanized robot or a computer like Star Trek enterprise,

454
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:02,325
Speaker 2:  we are still going to want our robots to do a bit more than they do

455
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:06,085
Speaker 2:  today. So what's the next step there? Where do you think that we're going

456
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:09,925
Speaker 2:  to be able to get more utility out of current

457
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:13,565
Speaker 2:  robots without getting to the humanoid necessarily going to the humanoid

458
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:13,805
Speaker 2:  level?

459
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:17,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think generalizing appendages is, is is

460
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:21,845
Speaker 7:  mistake because I think legs and arms are completely

461
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:25,205
Speaker 7:  different. Yeah. Yeah. I think arms with

462
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:29,885
Speaker 7:  our favorite gen AI acme toolkit are about

463
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:32,765
Speaker 7:  to become spectacularly useful.

464
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:34,285
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Yeah.

465
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:38,165
Speaker 7:  And so that, you know what you can do with a single arm, dual arm manipulators,

466
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:42,605
Speaker 7:  I think that the costs of high performance

467
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:46,765
Speaker 7:  dual arm manipulators are coming down very quickly. And so putting an arm

468
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:50,725
Speaker 7:  on something is suddenly wildly

469
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:54,565
Speaker 7:  more useful than it used to be because we

470
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:58,525
Speaker 7:  can grasp organically shape objects, we can recognize where they are.

471
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:02,325
Speaker 7:  We understand this, this visual perception that I was alluding to earlier

472
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:07,565
Speaker 7:  is, is suddenly made the fact that once I'm holding this, putting

473
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,645
Speaker 7:  it away is now, now is something that I can do because I actually understand

474
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:14,565
Speaker 7:  where stuff can go And I understand, you know, I can, I can, you

475
00:31:14,565 --> 00:31:18,445
Speaker 7:  know, go get me a beer suddenly makes sense because I know where the kitchen

476
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:22,165
Speaker 7:  is, I know where the fri I can recognize the refrigerator, I can open it

477
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:26,005
Speaker 7:  up and so now I can pick up a beer. And those were all really, really,

478
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:29,725
Speaker 7:  really, really hard problems prior to, you know, gen AI

479
00:31:30,445 --> 00:31:34,405
Speaker 7:  changing the rules. I think that the idea, if, you know, if I was

480
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:37,765
Speaker 7:  building a warehouse robot, I would put arms on it

481
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:41,045
Speaker 7:  immediately, but I wouldn't put legs on it

482
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:46,125
Speaker 7:  because warehouses are flat wheels worked

483
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,925
Speaker 7:  really, really good on flat. So

484
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:50,845
Speaker 2:  Rosie had it right. I mean she was arms and no legs.

485
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:55,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I think Rosie did have it right, honestly. And, and if she wanted to

486
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:58,005
Speaker 7:  go upstairs, she just hovered, which was like the, you know,

487
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:02,565
Speaker 7:  just like RD two could magically make itself upstairs until

488
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:06,445
Speaker 7:  they put rockets on it, which really wouldn't work very well in a home

489
00:32:06,445 --> 00:32:09,805
Speaker 7:  environment. But, you know,

490
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:14,165
Speaker 7:  but I think the legs are hard. You know, the amount of force

491
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:18,525
Speaker 7:  that needs to be stored in the knee of a leg in order

492
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:22,485
Speaker 7:  for it to do the types of things, lifting moves and

493
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:26,725
Speaker 7:  if that, that that amount of energy in the knee is

494
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,925
Speaker 7:  not necessarily something you want people near. And

495
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:34,845
Speaker 7:  so that there's some physics that need to be figured out a

496
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:38,645
Speaker 7:  little bit as we think about the realities of

497
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:42,645
Speaker 7:  thoughtful Rosie the robot design.

498
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:46,765
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So that we can get all of the good minimized cost

499
00:32:46,825 --> 00:32:50,765
Speaker 7:  and maximize safety and, and that will require letting go of some of the

500
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:53,885
Speaker 7:  preconceptions of how things need to be.

501
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:58,165
Speaker 2:  No, that makes a lot of sense. I see an arm being much more useful.

502
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:01,805
Speaker 2:  Although to date, the arm that I've tried in my house has not

503
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:05,845
Speaker 2:  really been very useful, but I can, but the potential's there and we getting

504
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:08,885
Speaker 2:  the potential is there and that's, we've seen. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's

505
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:12,485
Speaker 2:  exciting. It is exciting. But just to sort of wrap up and to bring us sort

506
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:16,125
Speaker 2:  of full circle to when you first talked at the beginning of the, of the chat

507
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:19,485
Speaker 2:  about where you feel, I think you mentioned like

508
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:23,165
Speaker 2:  companionship and bringing like robots that have a connection

509
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:26,805
Speaker 2:  with people in the home. This is something that I've been

510
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:30,525
Speaker 2:  struggling with in my mind. It's like the idea of anthropomorphizing appliances

511
00:33:30,705 --> 00:33:34,125
Speaker 2:  is sort of brings with it to like a whole host of complicated

512
00:33:34,605 --> 00:33:38,085
Speaker 2:  challenges to me around like the nature of consciousness and the boundaries

513
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:41,925
Speaker 2:  of humanity. And we don't have to dive into all of that now, but I would

514
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:45,525
Speaker 2:  love to just sort of ask you if you think, if you, if as you said

515
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:49,205
Speaker 2:  generative AI and this sort of more true intelligence

516
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:52,965
Speaker 2:  in robots is going to be, become very much part

517
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:57,045
Speaker 2:  of the future of home robots. And if we are building something

518
00:33:57,045 --> 00:34:00,965
Speaker 2:  that we're looking to have a connection with that is perhaps part

519
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:04,485
Speaker 2:  of our life or our family, not just a machine.

520
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,045
Speaker 2:  What, what is that?

521
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:10,805
Speaker 7:  You know, like everything robotics, it's complicated, right?

522
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:12,365
Speaker 7:  You know, the,

523
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,455
Speaker 7:  I think that what is true is

524
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:22,095
Speaker 7:  humanity is desperately isolated and lonely and,

525
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:26,135
Speaker 7:  you know, 50% of Americans would

526
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:30,295
Speaker 7:  self-identify as feeling isolated

527
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:33,935
Speaker 7:  and lonely. And the, the health impact of feeling self

528
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:38,575
Speaker 7:  isolated and lonely has been well documented as you know, a

529
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:42,215
Speaker 7:  US surgeon general number of years ago said it was the same as

530
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:45,895
Speaker 7:  smoking 15 cigarettes a day in

531
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:50,175
Speaker 7:  its negative impact. And so this is a

532
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:55,175
Speaker 7:  epidemic level challenge that society is

533
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:57,455
Speaker 7:  facing. Where do robots come into this?

534
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:58,255
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

535
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:02,775
Speaker 7:  And I would argue that building, whether it

536
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:06,175
Speaker 7:  be Rosie the robot or the Starship enterprise,

537
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:10,535
Speaker 7:  without considering the fact that

538
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:14,875
Speaker 7:  what you're doing is creating an

539
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:18,395
Speaker 7:  opportunity for real human connection is a mistake.

540
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:23,155
Speaker 7:  Now once you've realized, and once you've committed yourself to the

541
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:26,675
Speaker 7:  fact that human connection is an important

542
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:30,315
Speaker 7:  part of what the world needs,

543
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:35,155
Speaker 7:  then there's a question of, okay, where are the challenges that

544
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:39,125
Speaker 7:  we need to make sure that we're very aware of what metaphors can be

545
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:43,005
Speaker 7:  healthfully imposed? Is it recognized that

546
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:46,925
Speaker 7:  the goal of your smart home is this

547
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,685
Speaker 7:  occasionally motivate you to get out of the home and go do something

548
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:54,845
Speaker 7:  that would drive additional human connection? Or

549
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:58,205
Speaker 7:  how do you become part of the solution as opposed to

550
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,365
Speaker 7:  an increasing part of the problem? But it begins with a recognition

551
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:06,725
Speaker 7:  that this is a important challenge

552
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:11,165
Speaker 7:  and generative ai, without taking on

553
00:36:11,785 --> 00:36:15,645
Speaker 7:  at a very fundamental level, the opportunity

554
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:19,565
Speaker 7:  and challenge of human connection is not going

555
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:21,925
Speaker 7:  to succeed in the long term.

556
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:26,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, it's there, it's

557
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:28,325
Speaker 2:  happening. Do, how do we make sure we do it right?

558
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:32,645
Speaker 7:  And part of doing it right is having it be just

559
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:36,485
Speaker 7:  a wonderful and healthy experience and not just a wonderful

560
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:37,285
Speaker 7:  experience.

561
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:41,845
Speaker 2:  Well, And I know you can't tell us much, but I'm, I'm just guessing from

562
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:43,325
Speaker 2:  the name of your new business

563
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:48,605
Speaker 2:  Familiar Ma Machines and Magic that maybe this is something we might be hearing

564
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:52,485
Speaker 2:  more about from you later. And I'm excited one

565
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:56,325
Speaker 2:  day hopefully to hear more, but I really appreciate your time chatting

566
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:59,965
Speaker 2:  with me today, walking me through this and helping me sort of figure out

567
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:03,845
Speaker 2:  what, what I actually want from my home robotics. It's been very,

568
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,365
Speaker 2:  very illuminating and really interesting And I very much appreciate you sharing

569
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:09,165
Speaker 2:  your time with us today, Colin. Thank you.

570
00:37:09,985 --> 00:37:10,565
Speaker 7:  My pleasure.

571
00:37:11,055 --> 00:37:14,245
Speaker 2:  Thank you very much. And we are gonna take another ad break and when we come

572
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:18,005
Speaker 2:  back we're going to be talking about the Thread, no, not meta social

573
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:21,925
Speaker 2:  network, but the Thread protocol and how one goes about creating

574
00:37:22,285 --> 00:37:24,765
Speaker 2:  a smart home protocol. We'll be right back.

575
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:45,795
Speaker 2:  Internet of things, the IOT, they've all used

576
00:40:45,825 --> 00:40:49,635
Speaker 2:  different protocols and created different walled gardens,

577
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:54,355
Speaker 2:  ZigBee Z-Wave Home Kit, Bluetooth, wifi Thread

578
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:58,395
Speaker 2:  Weave and more. I could go on and on. It's been a

579
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:02,475
Speaker 2:  frustrating experience for consumers. Do I need a hub? Will it work with

580
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:06,195
Speaker 2:  my Android and my spouse's iPhone? Am I locked

581
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:10,195
Speaker 2:  into one manufacturer ecosystem if I just want to turn my lights

582
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:14,035
Speaker 2:  on with a voice command? So to fix all of this,

583
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,955
Speaker 2:  about five years ago, apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung

584
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,075
Speaker 2:  and a bunch of manufacturers but not all

585
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:25,235
Speaker 2:  rallied together to create a solution matter.

586
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:30,355
Speaker 2:  Think of matter as a shared language for your smart home devices so that

587
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:33,955
Speaker 2:  they can talk to each other no matter where they came from.

588
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:38,595
Speaker 2:  But for them to talk, they need a way to do that. They need

589
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:41,675
Speaker 2:  like telephone lines or a network infrastructure

590
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:46,075
Speaker 2:  And Matter works with two. One is wifi and it's

591
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:49,715
Speaker 2:  hardwired Sibling ethernet. And the other one you may be

592
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,395
Speaker 2:  unfamiliar with, it's called Thread.

593
00:41:53,295 --> 00:41:57,195
Speaker 2:  Thread is a low power, low bandwidth mesh networking protocol.

594
00:41:57,455 --> 00:42:00,995
Speaker 2:  Vat. Unlike all those other protocols, was

595
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:05,355
Speaker 2:  specifically designed for smart home devices. It's super fast,

596
00:42:05,525 --> 00:42:09,315
Speaker 2:  works locally and doesn't need an internet connection to turn on your lights.

597
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:13,995
Speaker 2:  Today we're going to do a deep dive into Thread, how it came

598
00:42:13,995 --> 00:42:17,715
Speaker 2:  to be, what makes it stand out, and then explore why

599
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:21,475
Speaker 2:  matter and Thread haven't yet seen the widespread

600
00:42:21,715 --> 00:42:25,635
Speaker 2:  adoption that some were hoping for. To do this, I've invited someone who's

601
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:29,915
Speaker 2:  probably forgotten more about Thread than most people know. Grant Erickson

602
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,835
Speaker 2:  is an engineer who actually developed Thread while working on nests

603
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:37,675
Speaker 2:  early smart home products. He then helped grow the protocol as

604
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:41,475
Speaker 2:  president of the Thread group and was instrumental in bringing together

605
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:45,475
Speaker 2:  Google, apple and Amazon to form the matter. Smart Home Standard.

606
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:49,475
Speaker 2:  Hi Grant, welcome and thank you so much for joining me.

607
00:42:49,705 --> 00:42:52,435
Speaker 9:  Good morning Jennifer. It's a pleasure to be here and a pleasure to finally

608
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:53,875
Speaker 9:  be able to chat live.

609
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:58,035
Speaker 2:  Wonderful. Great. Yes, we've communicated over the years over email and this

610
00:42:58,035 --> 00:43:01,875
Speaker 2:  is our first time face-to-face, so it's exciting for me. Can't

611
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:05,595
Speaker 2:  wait to get some more insight here. And just to kick us off, can you just

612
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:08,715
Speaker 2:  give us kind of a brief overview of what is Thread?

613
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:13,155
Speaker 9:  Absolutely. So in order to really or er yourself to

614
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:16,755
Speaker 9:  what Thread is and where it fits, I think the best peer that you can think

615
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:20,555
Speaker 9:  of is wifi. We love wifi. It's on our phones, it's on our tablets,

616
00:43:20,555 --> 00:43:23,475
Speaker 9:  it's on our laptops, it's on our computers at home. It allows us to do things

617
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:27,475
Speaker 9:  like stream Netflix or look at Facebook or do

618
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:30,755
Speaker 9:  all the things that sort of the killer app of of the internet and the web

619
00:43:30,865 --> 00:43:34,635
Speaker 9:  have become. But wifi is in addition to providing a lot of

620
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:38,155
Speaker 9:  bandwidth, it needs a lot of power to do what it does. And for

621
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:42,075
Speaker 9:  constrained devices that either need to be small and tiny or need to run

622
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:45,875
Speaker 9:  on a very tiny battery, wifi can be made to work. But it's not

623
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:48,875
Speaker 9:  ideal because you're often gonna replace batteries very frequently. You're

624
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:51,795
Speaker 9:  gonna have to figure out how to plug the thing into a wall. And Thread is

625
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,675
Speaker 9:  really the low power sort of constrained wireless network peer

626
00:43:55,695 --> 00:43:59,595
Speaker 9:  to wifi. It allows you to sort of bring internet connectivity to things

627
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:03,755
Speaker 9:  for which it was either previously impossible or expensive or

628
00:44:04,295 --> 00:44:08,035
Speaker 9:  as people in the biz love to acknowledge required gateways

629
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:11,955
Speaker 9:  and coordinators and and bridges and all these other types of technology

630
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:15,675
Speaker 9:  that consumers really hubs Exactly. Consumers don't care about or don't want.

631
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:19,555
Speaker 9:  But there's sort of little necessary evils that we have to bring in when

632
00:44:19,555 --> 00:44:22,995
Speaker 9:  the technology doesn't get us to the internet end to end. So in summary,

633
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:26,955
Speaker 9:  really think of Thread as a super low power compliment to wifi

634
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:30,955
Speaker 9:  for bringing devices that previously couldn't connect to the internet, to

635
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:34,325
Speaker 9:  connect to the internet and other wireless devices or wired devices.

636
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:38,605
Speaker 2:  Excellent. But one of the main things I wanted to talk to you about, because

637
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:42,805
Speaker 2:  I think it's fascinating that you created a new, a new smart home

638
00:44:43,045 --> 00:44:46,965
Speaker 2:  protocol. So we're gonna go back in time and do a bit of smart home law

639
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:50,005
Speaker 2:  here. And this is for the Smart Home Geeks alum here. And I hope you guys

640
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:53,605
Speaker 2:  will enjoy this. But Thread began way back in 2011

641
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:57,765
Speaker 2:  with the original Nest Learning thermostat and you were involved in

642
00:44:57,765 --> 00:45:01,285
Speaker 2:  developing that, having worked with Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers at Apple

643
00:45:01,385 --> 00:45:05,365
Speaker 2:  before joining them when they founded Nest. So can you tell

644
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:09,165
Speaker 2:  us why you guys decided to create your very

645
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:13,005
Speaker 2:  own smart home protocol, considering there were already a

646
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:14,765
Speaker 2:  few of them, why create Thread?

647
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:19,365
Speaker 9:  So back when I got the call from Matt Rogers to join getting the

648
00:45:19,365 --> 00:45:22,845
Speaker 9:  band back together was with my wife at the Space Needle in Seattle.

649
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:27,205
Speaker 9:  And even at the moment that he had called, there was already a prototype

650
00:45:27,205 --> 00:45:31,085
Speaker 9:  and even before I joined of the Nest Learning thermostat and it had what

651
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:34,845
Speaker 9:  we call some dark silicon in it. And I think it was the TICC

652
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:38,725
Speaker 9:  something or another 8 0 2 15 4 radio. For those in the audience that aren't

653
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:42,685
Speaker 9:  aware, your thermostat fundamentally controls one of the largest energy

654
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:46,445
Speaker 9:  loads in your home. And the ZigBee Alliance of course at the time had

655
00:45:46,725 --> 00:45:50,645
Speaker 9:  a standard called Smart Energy profile and the idea was that the

656
00:45:50,645 --> 00:45:54,525
Speaker 9:  Nest Learning thermostat was gonna participate with your energy meter in

657
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:58,365
Speaker 9:  your home through the smart energy profile. And by the time I joined I was

658
00:45:58,365 --> 00:46:01,125
Speaker 9:  sort of helping lead the charge with some other engineers on how we were

659
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,885
Speaker 9:  gonna make this work. And we found something very interesting and that is,

660
00:46:04,885 --> 00:46:08,605
Speaker 9:  even though there was a smart energy profile and standard as we

661
00:46:08,805 --> 00:46:11,805
Speaker 9:  approached, for example Pacific Gas and Electric or

662
00:46:12,655 --> 00:46:16,005
Speaker 9:  ConEd, all the different energy companies, even though there was a standard

663
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:19,925
Speaker 9:  at the top of that standard, each energy company had a special sauce in terms

664
00:46:19,925 --> 00:46:23,605
Speaker 9:  of onboarding and security in terms of how the device

665
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:27,085
Speaker 9:  would get involved on their platform, on their network and participate.

666
00:46:27,425 --> 00:46:31,045
Speaker 9:  And what we quickly realized is, wait, we're a small startup, we only have,

667
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:35,045
Speaker 9:  you know, less than 50 employees, there are 20 energy major energy companies.

668
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:38,725
Speaker 9:  We are gonna have to have effectively 20 different firmware loads for our

669
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:42,645
Speaker 9:  thermostat to deploy this across the country. And we're like, disaster.

670
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:46,485
Speaker 9:  That's not gonna work, that's not scalable. We, we just simply can't support

671
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:50,245
Speaker 9:  this. And so we basically said, let's stop, let's retrench, let's re-figure

672
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:53,125
Speaker 9:  this out. And what we ultimately did, which I think was the right choice,

673
00:46:53,305 --> 00:46:56,445
Speaker 9:  is of course all these energy providers had cloud platforms. And what we

674
00:46:56,765 --> 00:47:00,565
Speaker 9:  realized is we could integrate at the cloud level where software and resources

675
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:04,485
Speaker 9:  are are much more fungible and and easily changed and redeployed.

676
00:47:04,945 --> 00:47:07,885
Speaker 9:  And so we did cloud to cloud integrations with all the energy providers.

677
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:11,485
Speaker 9:  And so what that meant is we now had this radio that we thought we knew what

678
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:14,445
Speaker 9:  we wanted to use it for, but suddenly we didn't have a use for it that we

679
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:18,325
Speaker 9:  thought we did. So that kind of brings us to the next part of

680
00:47:18,325 --> 00:47:22,285
Speaker 9:  the journey and that is, it's important to understand the company was called

681
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:25,365
Speaker 9:  Nest. It wasn't called the Nest Learning Thermostat Company, it wasn't called

682
00:47:25,365 --> 00:47:28,965
Speaker 9:  the Nest Security Company. There was always a vision for an ecosystem

683
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:32,925
Speaker 9:  of connected products and services, not just within the walls of Nest, but

684
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:36,805
Speaker 9:  outside to other partners and and products and services outside of Nest.

685
00:47:37,385 --> 00:47:41,245
Speaker 2:  And Nest presumably being like the home, like nesting in your home.

686
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:41,805
Speaker 2:  Exactly.

687
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:45,285
Speaker 9:  Exactly. And so there was always this vision for more than just the

688
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:48,205
Speaker 9:  thermostat and there was always a vision for

689
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:51,685
Speaker 9:  connectivity, both outside the home, you're outside the home, you want to

690
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:54,405
Speaker 9:  have awareness of what's going on in your home, how do you connect through

691
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:58,005
Speaker 9:  back to your products and back to your home. There's a notion of I'm in the

692
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:01,565
Speaker 9:  home, I wanna control my thermostat from the bed, maybe not going all the

693
00:48:01,565 --> 00:48:04,165
Speaker 9:  way up through the cloud. As a lot of early smart home integrations were,

694
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:08,365
Speaker 9:  what would this need to look like? And In fact, even before the fact we were

695
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:11,925
Speaker 9:  of course many of us Apple alumni, but we knew that Apple was not the

696
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:15,645
Speaker 9:  start and the end of mobile platforms and tablets. And so we were thinking

697
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:19,485
Speaker 9:  about again, Android and Google and other ecosystems. And so we asked

698
00:48:19,485 --> 00:48:23,365
Speaker 9:  ourselves, what technologies do we need to bring to bear to bring

699
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:27,125
Speaker 9:  this vision to life? Hey, we've got this 15 four radio, what could we do

700
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:30,525
Speaker 9:  with that? And the real key moment for us was,

701
00:48:30,905 --> 00:48:34,205
Speaker 9:  and this sort of Wayne Gretzky moment skate to where the puck is going, not

702
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:38,125
Speaker 9:  where the puck is. We bet on ip. We said yeah, there's all these protocols.

703
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,925
Speaker 9:  Yeah, they're, they've got some market traction. But ultimately if we want

704
00:48:41,925 --> 00:48:45,205
Speaker 9:  people to start with a particular product in our ecosystem,

705
00:48:45,745 --> 00:48:48,885
Speaker 9:  we don't want them to have to start with that product plus, oh you need to

706
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:52,685
Speaker 9:  buy a gateway or a hub or Oh I have the product but I want connectivity.

707
00:48:52,885 --> 00:48:56,645
Speaker 9:  I can't do it until I get this hub. And so we really wanted to make the

708
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:59,605
Speaker 9:  ability for consumers to choose the product in our ecosystem they wanted

709
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:02,965
Speaker 9:  to start with and be able to incrementally grow from there without having

710
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:06,405
Speaker 9:  to be networking engineers or without having to buy additional pieces of

711
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:09,925
Speaker 9:  just sort of network only hardware to make the whole ecosystem work. And

712
00:49:10,085 --> 00:49:12,205
Speaker 9:  ultimately we decided we needed to build something ourselves.

713
00:49:13,185 --> 00:49:16,925
Speaker 2:  But building yourself, I mean you mentioned earlier you're a 50 person company

714
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:21,045
Speaker 2:  I think you said, right? Yeah. And that was an already taking on

715
00:49:21,685 --> 00:49:25,525
Speaker 2:  a large project, launching essentially the first smart

716
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:28,925
Speaker 2:  thermostat. I think It could be was there just before you guys, but

717
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:34,085
Speaker 2:  what made you think, okay, let's, let's create a whole new smart home protocol

718
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:37,805
Speaker 2:  and and how did you then decide to develop

719
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:38,325
Speaker 2:  Thread?

720
00:49:39,265 --> 00:49:43,045
Speaker 9:  So the actual genesis for Thread didn't actually start

721
00:49:43,045 --> 00:49:45,805
Speaker 9:  with a thermostat. The thermostat was the thing that kind of triggered the

722
00:49:45,805 --> 00:49:49,525
Speaker 9:  vision. But by time we released the thermostat, the first generation,

723
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:53,005
Speaker 9:  we already had our second product in the pipeline and engineering development.

724
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:56,285
Speaker 9:  And that was Nest Protect. And Nest Protect had this interesting problem

725
00:49:56,745 --> 00:50:00,525
Speaker 9:  of a regulatory perspective having to be interconnected.

726
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:04,525
Speaker 2:  Just to clarify for everyone, that is the amazing smoke alarm

727
00:50:05,675 --> 00:50:09,045
Speaker 2:  that was the first smart smoke alarm? Yes. Which

728
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:12,765
Speaker 2:  unfortunately has recently been discontinued, but I still have two in my

729
00:50:12,765 --> 00:50:15,845
Speaker 2:  home. I'm hanging on, I think my, my next expire this month.

730
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:20,165
Speaker 9:  Ah, okay. Yeah, it's, it's really a fantastic product. One of it is one of

731
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:23,685
Speaker 9:  the best I've worked on in my career. So yes, that is the smoke and co alarm.

732
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:27,445
Speaker 9:  And of course it's not just enough to detect Smoke and Co where

733
00:50:27,465 --> 00:50:30,805
Speaker 9:  you detect it, you have to broadcast that alarm to every other

734
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:34,965
Speaker 9:  connected alarm that's in the home. And so we had a challenge of,

735
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:38,725
Speaker 9:  okay, we have these connectivity requirements for people, for end users for

736
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:42,205
Speaker 9:  the cloud, but we also need these smoke detectors to connect to one another.

737
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:46,245
Speaker 9:  Hmm, okay, what does, what does that need to look like? How, what do we need

738
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:50,045
Speaker 9:  to design to make that happen? And that was really where the genesis of Thread

739
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:53,845
Speaker 9:  started to come to the fore. Again, we looked at all sorts of different

740
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:57,485
Speaker 9:  technologies, proprietary radios from different vendors that we could have

741
00:50:57,485 --> 00:51:01,125
Speaker 9:  done other network types. And ultimately we said, okay, we could do this

742
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:04,605
Speaker 9:  with this particular technology. Like, okay, well now we need to have that

743
00:51:04,605 --> 00:51:08,485
Speaker 9:  radio plus we need to have connectivity to the cloud that increases our

744
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:12,445
Speaker 9:  product costs. What can we do with just one radio, one network stack

745
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:16,725
Speaker 9:  being interconnected alarm and do all of this and still

746
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:19,725
Speaker 9:  achieve the vision of, okay, let's say people just start in their home with

747
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:23,285
Speaker 9:  Nest Protect and wanna grow from there. What would that look like? And

748
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:27,365
Speaker 9:  ultimately that was sort of the seeds to get us to Thread. And again, we

749
00:51:27,365 --> 00:51:31,085
Speaker 9:  went back to that North Star, which is this has all gotta be ip, it's gotta

750
00:51:31,085 --> 00:51:34,525
Speaker 9:  be mobile connected, it's gotta be cloud connected, these things have to

751
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:38,405
Speaker 9:  be connected to each other. We need something that can carry IP but can

752
00:51:38,405 --> 00:51:42,205
Speaker 9:  also talk to each other when the internet is down, broadcast,

753
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:45,885
Speaker 9:  these alarms, all that. And that really was the genesis of,

754
00:51:45,955 --> 00:51:49,845
Speaker 9:  okay, we need an IP based wireless mesh network that's low power. Because

755
00:51:49,865 --> 00:51:53,845
Speaker 9:  yes, some homes have connected powered smoke and co detectors, they've

756
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:57,165
Speaker 9:  got line voltage in the the box behind them, but some don't. Some just have

757
00:51:57,165 --> 00:52:00,525
Speaker 9:  to run on batteries and those batteries have to last for a couple of years.

758
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:04,925
Speaker 9:  And so how do we do that? How do we meet that multi-year AA battery

759
00:52:05,365 --> 00:52:09,125
Speaker 9:  lifetime with an interconnected wireless alarm and, and meet those

760
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,965
Speaker 9:  product costs and technology constraints? And so Thread was born and

761
00:52:12,965 --> 00:52:14,805
Speaker 9:  that was, that was the genesis. And

762
00:52:14,805 --> 00:52:18,605
Speaker 2:  What was the vision then, like in this was we, in 2012,

763
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:21,645
Speaker 2:  I think you said 20 12, 20 13. So what was the vision then? What was coming

764
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:21,965
Speaker 2:  next?

765
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:26,285
Speaker 9:  I mean, again, at that point we already knew that there was the thermostats

766
00:52:26,285 --> 00:52:29,765
Speaker 9:  even with the first generation, the second generation was already on the

767
00:52:29,765 --> 00:52:33,445
Speaker 9:  drawing boards. We had Nest Protect already in flight. Nest Guard

768
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:36,325
Speaker 9:  was already on the drawing board. We already knew we were gonna be building

769
00:52:36,485 --> 00:52:40,045
Speaker 9:  eventually a security system. We had, you know, ideas of

770
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:44,285
Speaker 9:  additional sensors. We had the Nest Yale Lock was already in

771
00:52:44,285 --> 00:52:47,645
Speaker 9:  flight at that point. So we already had a first party

772
00:52:47,755 --> 00:52:51,685
Speaker 9:  ecosystem that we had a roadmap for and we had different points on that roadmap

773
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:53,605
Speaker 9:  for here's what we're gonna do this and here's what we're gonna do that.

774
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:57,525
Speaker 9:  So as we were building that first product, we already had, you know,

775
00:52:57,525 --> 00:53:00,805
Speaker 9:  points on the horizon that we knew we needed to get to. So as we were making

776
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:04,885
Speaker 9:  decisions, again, we already kind of had needles that we needed

777
00:53:04,885 --> 00:53:07,725
Speaker 9:  to Thread to make sure off we make this decision, we need to make sure that

778
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:10,965
Speaker 9:  we're enabling that. And even at that time we also had the Works with Nest

779
00:53:10,965 --> 00:53:14,005
Speaker 9:  program that was getting off the ground and that was of course a cloud-based

780
00:53:14,005 --> 00:53:17,525
Speaker 9:  integration. But we always had it in mind that in addition to cloud-based

781
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:21,205
Speaker 9:  integrations, we wanted to have local integrations. We wanted to bring weave

782
00:53:21,225 --> 00:53:24,725
Speaker 9:  and Thread to other first party, second party, third party partners

783
00:53:25,145 --> 00:53:28,405
Speaker 9:  for doing integrations within the home outside the cloud. So again, all this

784
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:32,285
Speaker 9:  stuff was even as early as 20 11, 20 12 stuff that we

785
00:53:32,285 --> 00:53:35,765
Speaker 9:  needed, we knew we needed to get done and, and we needed to Thread that needle

786
00:53:35,765 --> 00:53:37,405
Speaker 9:  correctly to make sure we got there.

787
00:53:37,995 --> 00:53:41,645
Speaker 2:  Well, and then something happened, Google bought Nest

788
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:45,965
Speaker 2:  in 2014. What specifically happened to the technology of threat

789
00:53:45,995 --> 00:53:46,805
Speaker 2:  when that happened?

790
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:51,165
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's an excellent question and I'll do a, an unofficial

791
00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:54,725
Speaker 9:  plug for those in the audience that haven't read it. Tony Fidel's excellent

792
00:53:54,725 --> 00:53:58,685
Speaker 9:  book build really covers a lot of detail that we probably won't cover

793
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:02,565
Speaker 9:  today about that relationship and that acquisition. But

794
00:54:02,565 --> 00:54:06,245
Speaker 9:  there sort of was an interesting, I don't wanna say cultural clash, but

795
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:10,485
Speaker 9:  an interesting clash of sort of agendas and goals. Of course, Nest at

796
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:13,645
Speaker 9:  the time we required was probably a hundred seventy five, a hundred fifty

797
00:54:13,925 --> 00:54:16,925
Speaker 9:  employees, very small, still laser focused on what we were doing.

798
00:54:17,725 --> 00:54:21,245
Speaker 9:  Google of course at that time was a multi-billion dollar international company

799
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:24,925
Speaker 9:  with many divisions, many different initiatives. And

800
00:54:25,145 --> 00:54:28,885
Speaker 9:  of course schools famous for sort of controlled chaos and, and not

801
00:54:28,885 --> 00:54:32,365
Speaker 9:  top-down decision making. So one of the interesting things that that happened,

802
00:54:32,365 --> 00:54:36,245
Speaker 9:  of course, is IO OT and Smart Home was sort of getting off the ground but

803
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:39,685
Speaker 9:  had not been acquired. And that was sort of a, a, a, you know, a match in

804
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:42,685
Speaker 9:  the haystack for igniting interest in that space.

805
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:46,565
Speaker 9:  But it was interesting when the day we acquired, one of the founders of Google

806
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:49,965
Speaker 9:  sort of said, you know, to the extent that we are doing other things related

807
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:53,485
Speaker 9:  to IOT within Google today, we are gonna stop doing those and we're focused

808
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:57,205
Speaker 9:  on Nest. And that was kind of sort of true. There was initiative within

809
00:54:57,205 --> 00:55:00,925
Speaker 9:  Google called Android at home and within a week

810
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:04,165
Speaker 9:  of, of that acquisition, Android at Home was shut down.

811
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,925
Speaker 9:  There was an opportunity for those teams to, you know, come together and

812
00:55:07,925 --> 00:55:11,685
Speaker 9:  work together with Nest. But what was interesting and what we learned

813
00:55:11,685 --> 00:55:15,165
Speaker 9:  shortly thereafter is I'd say within a month of that acquisition,

814
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,365
Speaker 9:  we, many of us would start getting meeting requests for, Hey, I'm working

815
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:21,805
Speaker 9:  on this little IO OT project and how can Nest help me in my I OT project?

816
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:25,765
Speaker 9:  And there literally was, was tens if not hundreds of iot initiatives within

817
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:29,725
Speaker 9:  Google. And so how do we make Thread and weave move forward?

818
00:55:29,745 --> 00:55:32,965
Speaker 9:  Of course it was, it was abundantly clear that we needed to do what we needed

819
00:55:32,985 --> 00:55:36,525
Speaker 9:  to do to achieve our roadmap, but there was a lot of, I would say,

820
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:40,325
Speaker 9:  competing interests within Google that were not aligned and convinced that

821
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:44,205
Speaker 9:  what we were doing was the right choice. And so a lot of us spent a lot of

822
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:47,725
Speaker 9:  time and energy trying to convince Google what we were doing was the right

823
00:55:47,725 --> 00:55:50,965
Speaker 9:  choice. And, and that wasn't obvious to them, even though it maybe seemed,

824
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:54,685
Speaker 9:  you know, apparent to us based on what we were doing and our vision. But

825
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:57,685
Speaker 9:  ultimately, you know, the, the people that needed to be were supportive and

826
00:55:57,685 --> 00:56:01,245
Speaker 9:  we kept moving forward and kept doing what we were doing. But certainly there

827
00:56:01,245 --> 00:56:04,685
Speaker 9:  was I think a lot of confusing competing initiatives

828
00:56:05,085 --> 00:56:08,285
Speaker 9:  within Google with their partner ecosystem and what they were doing with

829
00:56:08,505 --> 00:56:12,165
Speaker 9:  IOT that made it beyond the challenges that we've talked about already.

830
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:16,205
Speaker 9:  There was a lot of internal challenges that again, just made that journey

831
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:19,045
Speaker 9:  a lot more difficult than probably otherwise could have been or should have

832
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:19,165
Speaker 9:  been.

833
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:23,725
Speaker 2:  Well, and then in 2016, Google open sourced Thread,

834
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:24,245
Speaker 2:  correct?

835
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:28,205
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that was, that was an interesting moment. Open Thread is really another

836
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:32,165
Speaker 9:  interesting part of this journey. What you typically see a lot

837
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:35,845
Speaker 9:  historically in the world of standards is sort of what I call leading with

838
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:39,765
Speaker 9:  paper. You sort of have multiple companies coming together with an idea.

839
00:56:40,185 --> 00:56:43,205
Speaker 9:  And the idea is that we're gonna write a specification, we're gonna write

840
00:56:43,245 --> 00:56:46,925
Speaker 9:  a standard, and eventually to the extent that standard and that that

841
00:56:47,165 --> 00:56:50,685
Speaker 9:  document generates excitement, you get multiple takers, multiple,

842
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:54,445
Speaker 9:  multiple comers on that say we're gonna write a, a software to that standard.

843
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:59,085
Speaker 9:  And different standards bodies have different thresholds. Some require one

844
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:03,165
Speaker 9:  implementer, some require two, some require three. But the idea is

845
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:06,765
Speaker 9:  we're gonna get some number of implementers and we're gonna have a race to

846
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:09,765
Speaker 9:  have them all implement this. And then we're gonna do an interop fest to

847
00:57:09,765 --> 00:57:12,725
Speaker 9:  make sure they all work together. And when we get sort of the right level

848
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:15,765
Speaker 9:  of convergence and interoperability, we're gonna laugh and clap and say,

849
00:57:15,825 --> 00:57:18,845
Speaker 9:  the standard is complete. We have this many implementations and it's done.

850
00:57:19,665 --> 00:57:23,605
Speaker 9:  And that is an okay of way of working, but we needed to move faster.

851
00:57:23,785 --> 00:57:27,165
Speaker 9:  As you knew, as you heard earlier, we had a lot of products, we had a lot

852
00:57:27,165 --> 00:57:30,805
Speaker 9:  of ambition, we had a lot of vision we needed to get done and we needed to

853
00:57:30,805 --> 00:57:34,725
Speaker 9:  get done quickly. And so as, as that process was happening within the

854
00:57:34,725 --> 00:57:38,605
Speaker 9:  Thread group and was not necessarily happening at the speed and the quality

855
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:42,485
Speaker 9:  that we wanted it to happen, we had a unique opportunity. We had a, a brilliant

856
00:57:42,485 --> 00:57:45,845
Speaker 9:  hire in the industry. Jonathan Way we picked up from Cisco.

857
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:50,445
Speaker 9:  Jonathan had a ton of experience in this space and he and

858
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:53,885
Speaker 9:  the rest of the team suggested, Hey, I think I could write a, a Thread stack

859
00:57:53,885 --> 00:57:57,285
Speaker 9:  and we could open source it and really unlock and scale this market in a

860
00:57:57,285 --> 00:58:00,925
Speaker 9:  way that's different from the way this industry works in the past. And Open

861
00:58:00,925 --> 00:58:04,685
Speaker 9:  Thread was born and we approached some partners and we said, Hey, we're

862
00:58:04,685 --> 00:58:07,125
Speaker 9:  we're doing this. And they're like, oh my God, this has never been done before.

863
00:58:07,475 --> 00:58:10,165
Speaker 9:  Like, this is fantastic. Can you really do this? I'm like, yep, we're doing

864
00:58:10,165 --> 00:58:13,685
Speaker 9:  it. And Jonathan got it done and we we went and did it. And

865
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:18,005
Speaker 9:  it really, again, took Thread from sort of in terms of silicon

866
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:21,285
Speaker 9:  vendors and stacks and availability from very small number

867
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:25,125
Speaker 9:  till we literally had 15 partners overnight with Open Thread. It was, it

868
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,045
Speaker 9:  was truly a watershed moment for, for Thread.

869
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:30,305
Speaker 2:  And Jonathan is, is Google correct? He's, I mean, he's still,

870
00:58:30,585 --> 00:58:33,825
Speaker 9:  Jonathan is still at Google. He is actually also VP of Technology of Thread

871
00:58:33,825 --> 00:58:34,305
Speaker 9:  Group as well

872
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:38,225
Speaker 2:  Right now. So you mentioned Thread Group. Now, when did that develop

873
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:43,145
Speaker 2:  because that came in. So you, so Nest was bought by

874
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,945
Speaker 2:  Google and then Open Source Thread. Somewhere in the, the

875
00:58:46,945 --> 00:58:50,465
Speaker 2:  point here, this becomes Thread becomes a small industry

876
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:53,745
Speaker 2:  collaboration, right? With Thread Group, I think Nest, you mentioned Yale,

877
00:58:54,585 --> 00:58:58,185
Speaker 2:  I believe Silicon Labs. How did all these guys come together and what was

878
00:58:58,185 --> 00:58:59,905
Speaker 2:  the sort of impetus of creating Thread group?

879
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:04,225
Speaker 9:  So we talked about Winter 2011 kicking off the Nest Protect

880
00:59:04,225 --> 00:59:08,105
Speaker 9:  program. Again, when you sort of think about things from

881
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:12,025
Speaker 9:  a supply chain perspective, thinking about Apple levels of scale of

882
00:59:12,025 --> 00:59:15,665
Speaker 9:  producing something, one of the worst things you can do in the

883
00:59:15,865 --> 00:59:19,185
Speaker 9:  industry is have single source suppliers. Like, oh wait, we've got a production

884
00:59:19,185 --> 00:59:22,845
Speaker 9:  problem. We can't move forward because we're, we're locked into the single

885
00:59:23,165 --> 00:59:27,085
Speaker 9:  supplier. And so, as I mentioned, choosing 8 0 2 15 4 was a

886
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,925
Speaker 9:  key choice to make sure, one, we didn't have to spin up that Silicon program,

887
00:59:30,425 --> 00:59:33,805
Speaker 9:  but two, there was already a wide range of silicon vendors that were all

888
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:37,685
Speaker 9:  making 8 0 2 15 4 solutions. And so as we launched

889
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:41,685
Speaker 9:  the Nest Protect program, we were out looking for who is gonna

890
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:45,525
Speaker 9:  be our supplier for 15 four solutions in the Nest Protect. And

891
00:59:45,525 --> 00:59:49,005
Speaker 9:  we went and talked to all the major players and we talked about our vision,

892
00:59:49,065 --> 00:59:52,525
Speaker 9:  we talked about the problems, and they said, Hey, we actually believe in

893
00:59:52,525 --> 00:59:56,045
Speaker 9:  this. We have been hearing from our customers a lot of the same things. We

894
00:59:56,045 --> 00:59:59,685
Speaker 9:  think you Nest have the right vision. We're we're on board with this.

895
00:59:59,905 --> 01:00:03,805
Speaker 9:  And so we started to sort of think to ourselves, maybe the

896
01:00:03,805 --> 01:00:07,365
Speaker 9:  right way to do this is not just a sort of a, a vendor to vendor relationship.

897
01:00:07,365 --> 01:00:10,485
Speaker 9:  Maybe there's an industry collaboration here. And so we had a meeting even

898
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:14,045
Speaker 9:  before the Nest Protect program was fully kicked off, and

899
01:00:14,555 --> 01:00:18,125
Speaker 9:  Tony and Matt said, no, we are going to make this an industry initiative.

900
01:00:18,225 --> 01:00:21,445
Speaker 9:  And so we got all the different silicon suppliers we were talking to together,

901
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:25,565
Speaker 9:  NXP, Silicon Labs, et cetera, Texas Instruments, so

902
01:00:25,565 --> 01:00:28,165
Speaker 9:  on and so forth, and said, Hey, we're gonna create an industry. Do you guys,

903
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:31,605
Speaker 9:  you know, wanna be a part of this? And they were like, yep, absolutely. And

904
01:00:31,605 --> 01:00:35,205
Speaker 9:  at that point, my predecessor as the Thread group president, Chris Boros

905
01:00:35,305 --> 01:00:39,285
Speaker 9:  was actually our first partnership lead. He was already working with the

906
01:00:39,285 --> 01:00:42,725
Speaker 9:  likes of big ass fans and Yale, et cetera, on the Nest Lock and, and other

907
01:00:42,725 --> 01:00:45,925
Speaker 9:  programs. And we got them together and said, Hey, we're thinking about doing

908
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,605
Speaker 9:  this thing and here's the vision and here's the idea. And they're like, yes,

909
01:00:48,965 --> 01:00:52,045
Speaker 9:  absolutely. How do we be part of this? And so we got sort of this core group

910
01:00:52,045 --> 01:00:55,845
Speaker 9:  of, I think it was 11 or 13 companies together up and down the

911
01:00:55,845 --> 01:00:59,685
Speaker 9:  supply chain and Thread group was born even before we started

912
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:00,765
Speaker 9:  on the Nest Protect.

913
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:03,645
Speaker 2:  So sounds very familiar

914
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:09,605
Speaker 2:  to something that's happened more recently. It's very much, I mean, I went,

915
01:01:09,635 --> 01:01:13,325
Speaker 2:  went back and read the first press release from Thread Group and it

916
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:16,845
Speaker 2:  basically sounds exactly what, like the idea was what matter

917
01:01:16,845 --> 01:01:20,765
Speaker 2:  eventually became. I think the quote that caught me was the Thread protocol

918
01:01:20,765 --> 01:01:24,605
Speaker 2:  takes existing technologies and combines the best parts of each to provide

919
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:28,565
Speaker 2:  a better way to connect products in the home. But then this was 20,

920
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:32,285
Speaker 2:  what is this, 20 13, 20 12. Now

921
01:01:32,795 --> 01:01:36,005
Speaker 2:  that was a, that's a long time ago. Matter came in

922
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:39,645
Speaker 2:  2019. Just for some of our listeners who maybe

923
01:01:39,705 --> 01:01:43,685
Speaker 2:  aren't super keyed in to the smart home space, what is

924
01:01:43,685 --> 01:01:43,965
Speaker 2:  matter?

925
01:01:44,765 --> 01:01:48,685
Speaker 9:  Absolutely. So we talked about with wifi that there's a killer

926
01:01:48,745 --> 01:01:52,725
Speaker 9:  app and the killer app for wifi ultimately became the web and all the different

927
01:01:52,785 --> 01:01:56,525
Speaker 9:  web properties and applications ultimately matter, like its peers,

928
01:01:56,555 --> 01:02:00,125
Speaker 9:  home kits or Open Weave or ZigBee is an IOT

929
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:03,885
Speaker 9:  application layer. But what really was critical for matter is matter is based

930
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:07,605
Speaker 9:  on the internet protocol or ip. And because Thread is ip, just like

931
01:02:07,805 --> 01:02:11,725
Speaker 9:  wifi is IP and ethernet is ip, you suddenly have a singular

932
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:15,765
Speaker 9:  application layer that can connect devices that are on any of these IP

933
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:19,485
Speaker 9:  together to connect to interoperate with one another and, and work together

934
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:21,965
Speaker 9:  to provide features and services in the home.

935
01:02:22,535 --> 01:02:26,525
Speaker 2:  Right. So Thread is like the, the plumbing and matter is

936
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:30,405
Speaker 2:  like the fun stuff, the showers and the taps. And I mean, not a great

937
01:02:30,405 --> 01:02:31,365
Speaker 2:  analogy, I'm sorry.

938
01:02:31,645 --> 01:02:32,045
Speaker 9:  Exactly.

939
01:02:32,825 --> 01:02:36,805
Speaker 2:  But for the smart home it's cre it's helping run, do

940
01:02:36,805 --> 01:02:40,325
Speaker 2:  the fun things that we see and Thread is the is working

941
01:02:40,865 --> 01:02:43,605
Speaker 2:  behind the scenes to make sure everything connects with each other.

942
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:47,285
Speaker 9:  Exactly. To borrow a popular metaphor from Linis Torvalds

943
01:02:47,565 --> 01:02:50,565
Speaker 9:  Thread is the plumbing matter is the porcelain. Right?

944
01:02:50,565 --> 01:02:54,285
Speaker 2:  So the the main, the key here is that interoperability, right? Exactly.

945
01:02:54,585 --> 01:02:58,405
Speaker 2:  Any, any device can work with any platform. And that's something that's

946
01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:01,325
Speaker 2:  really been a struggle in the smart home to date

947
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:05,605
Speaker 2:  silos and walled gardens. And now

948
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:08,405
Speaker 2:  everyone's coming together, all the big companies, everyone's involved in

949
01:03:08,405 --> 01:03:12,005
Speaker 2:  matter, right? Apple, Google, Samsung, most of smart home

950
01:03:12,005 --> 01:03:15,605
Speaker 2:  manufacturers, the chip makers, everyone's come together and said like, this

951
01:03:15,745 --> 01:03:19,445
Speaker 2:  is what we need. And Thread along with wifi are the sort of

952
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:21,565
Speaker 2:  underpinnings of matter today

953
01:03:21,835 --> 01:03:25,685
Speaker 9:  Exactly. To have, you know, a a a home that you want to

954
01:03:25,685 --> 01:03:28,725
Speaker 9:  invite people into a a hotel you wanna invite people into, like they're not

955
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:31,485
Speaker 9:  looking under the cabinets. They don't necessarily care what the plumbing

956
01:03:31,485 --> 01:03:34,365
Speaker 9:  is. The engineers do, the people making the products do the people building

957
01:03:34,365 --> 01:03:37,925
Speaker 9:  the building do. But what people interact with is the porcelain. And so

958
01:03:38,265 --> 01:03:41,445
Speaker 9:  an application layer, that killer app that has the right

959
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:45,245
Speaker 9:  ingredients, the right special sauce to bring all this stuff together, to

960
01:03:45,245 --> 01:03:48,925
Speaker 9:  bring the vision alive was what we ultimately needed for this whole industry

961
01:03:48,945 --> 01:03:52,685
Speaker 9:  to really take off. I can imagine our colleagues and peers

962
01:03:52,685 --> 01:03:55,965
Speaker 9:  over at Apple thought they were doing the same thing with HomeKit and Truth

963
01:03:56,035 --> 01:03:59,885
Speaker 9:  told, I think Apple was really doing a fantastic job with

964
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:03,485
Speaker 9:  building out as there want to do with made for iPod, made for iPhone, a really

965
01:04:03,515 --> 01:04:07,245
Speaker 9:  rich, vibrant partner ecosystem with HomeKit, of course the

966
01:04:07,245 --> 01:04:10,525
Speaker 9:  ZigBee Alliance had been doing this long ago since roughly, you know, the

967
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:14,245
Speaker 9:  early aughts. And so we were all kind of doing our thing in

968
01:04:14,305 --> 01:04:18,125
Speaker 9:  our silos to try to bring this vision to life, but ultimately

969
01:04:18,265 --> 01:04:21,965
Speaker 9:  to make the plumbing valuable. People needed a killer app. And you know,

970
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:25,325
Speaker 9:  let's be candid, most companies aren't as insane as Nest to say here's this

971
01:04:25,325 --> 01:04:29,045
Speaker 9:  super ambitions vision and we're gonna go do this with a limited

972
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:33,005
Speaker 9:  number of people. Most companies are fast followers. They just say,

973
01:04:33,025 --> 01:04:36,085
Speaker 9:  you know, tell me what to do, tell me what to adopt and then we'll go make

974
01:04:36,085 --> 01:04:39,765
Speaker 9:  product based around that. They're not necessarily technology creation companies,

975
01:04:39,765 --> 01:04:43,605
Speaker 9:  they're product creation companies. So we're all kind of doing our thing

976
01:04:43,605 --> 01:04:46,845
Speaker 9:  in our silos trying to figure out a way to be successful in this market.

977
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:51,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well and and you mentioned Apple there, they did

978
01:04:51,405 --> 01:04:55,005
Speaker 2:  adopt Thread, right? In 2018 They did. So how did that happen?

979
01:04:55,705 --> 01:04:59,605
Speaker 9:  So we talk about plumbing and choosing the right plumbing for the smart home

980
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:03,205
Speaker 9:  or the smart building and one of the sort of elbows, pipe

981
01:05:03,205 --> 01:05:06,925
Speaker 9:  fittings, et cetera, sitting on the table is Bluetooth. And you might think,

982
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:10,645
Speaker 9:  Hey, Bluetooth is everywhere. It's in my car, it's in my phone. Maybe you

983
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:14,525
Speaker 9:  think I'm gonna build an IOT solution out of Bluetooth. Bluetooth is

984
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:18,125
Speaker 9:  great, love Bluetooth, but ultimately the best way to think about Bluetooth

985
01:05:18,345 --> 01:05:22,285
Speaker 9:  is sort of a wireless USB. What are the applications that really

986
01:05:22,395 --> 01:05:26,245
Speaker 9:  made Bluetooth prevalent? It was telephony, it was headsets

987
01:05:26,245 --> 01:05:30,005
Speaker 9:  and audio, it was human input devices, keyboards,

988
01:05:30,165 --> 01:05:33,725
Speaker 9:  mice, et cetera. If you put a USB cable between any of those two devices,

989
01:05:33,775 --> 01:05:36,925
Speaker 9:  you'd be like, oh, okay. It's a point-to-point connection. It's, it's not

990
01:05:37,025 --> 01:05:41,005
Speaker 9:  nec it's networking, but it's not a network in and of itself. Yeah.

991
01:05:41,185 --> 01:05:44,605
Speaker 9:  And so, you know, you translate that, and again, I'm, I'm speculating here.

992
01:05:44,685 --> 01:05:47,765
Speaker 9:  I, I don't have an official line since I wasn't involved in their product

993
01:05:47,765 --> 01:05:49,165
Speaker 9:  development plans. Oh,

994
01:05:49,185 --> 01:05:50,525
Speaker 2:  The Apple guy's still in you there

995
01:05:53,465 --> 01:05:54,485
Speaker 2:  not speaking for Apple,

996
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:59,405
Speaker 9:  But you can imagine a Bluetooth home kit door lock on your front door,

997
01:05:59,575 --> 01:06:03,485
Speaker 9:  right? And now I happen to be upstairs in the

998
01:06:03,485 --> 01:06:07,405
Speaker 9:  bedroom And I wanna unlock my front door because my kid has come home

999
01:06:07,435 --> 01:06:10,525
Speaker 9:  late. Somebody's come, the dog walker's come whenever it is And I wanna open

1000
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:14,285
Speaker 9:  the front door. Ooh. But wait, guess what? The bedroom and the front door

1001
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,525
Speaker 9:  are too far apart. Too far away. They can't talk to each other. Yeah. And

1002
01:06:17,525 --> 01:06:20,565
Speaker 9:  now the question is how do I solve that? Well, I can move closer to the door

1003
01:06:20,565 --> 01:06:20,805
Speaker 9:  lock,

1004
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,925
Speaker 2:  But then I may as well open it manually.

1005
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:27,125
Speaker 9:  Exactly. But because Bluetooth isn't a network, there is

1006
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:30,845
Speaker 9:  no repeater, there is no router, there is no additional

1007
01:06:31,045 --> 01:06:34,685
Speaker 9:  devices or things I can put between me and the front door

1008
01:06:35,105 --> 01:06:38,925
Speaker 9:  to make that experience better. And so my suspicion

1009
01:06:39,265 --> 01:06:43,045
Speaker 9:  is that like many companies that were building their IOT strategy

1010
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:46,925
Speaker 9:  around Bluetooth was we need to do something different to

1011
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:50,525
Speaker 9:  make this experience better for customers. We need a network.

1012
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:55,205
Speaker 9:  And I think, you know, I love Apple and, and, and they're great because

1013
01:06:55,685 --> 01:06:59,565
Speaker 9:  ultimately as we were at Nest, they were believers in IP of, again, Gretzky

1014
01:06:59,565 --> 01:07:02,525
Speaker 9:  skating to where that puck is going. And I think they reached the conclusion

1015
01:07:02,555 --> 01:07:06,085
Speaker 9:  like many companies in the ecosystem, did we need something beyond

1016
01:07:06,085 --> 01:07:10,045
Speaker 9:  Bluetooth to make this in-home networking experience for iot better? We

1017
01:07:10,045 --> 01:07:13,325
Speaker 9:  need to be able to have a home pod, for example, sitting between me and the

1018
01:07:13,325 --> 01:07:17,205
Speaker 9:  bedroom on my iPhone and the door lock and hey, now they're all Thread, they're

1019
01:07:17,205 --> 01:07:20,645
Speaker 9:  all meshed together. My request to open the door jumps to the home pod, the

1020
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:24,005
Speaker 9:  home pod jumps to the front door, great, I've got a Nest Protect sitting

1021
01:07:24,005 --> 01:07:27,565
Speaker 9:  somewhere between those. I jump from my phone to the Nest Protect to the

1022
01:07:27,565 --> 01:07:31,005
Speaker 9:  home pod to the front door. Again, it's just sort of a network that grows

1023
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:34,325
Speaker 9:  as you add devices, customers don't have to think about it. And so I again,

1024
01:07:34,325 --> 01:07:38,205
Speaker 9:  think Thread was a natural way for them to expand HomeKit

1025
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:41,245
Speaker 9:  and sort of solve some of those customer experience problems that I imagine

1026
01:07:41,245 --> 01:07:44,805
Speaker 9:  they were having. And again, HomeKit already worked over

1027
01:07:45,105 --> 01:07:48,885
Speaker 9:  IP because they had a cloud component of HomeKit. And so for them to adapt

1028
01:07:49,285 --> 01:07:53,125
Speaker 9:  that HomeKit over the cloud component to Thread was I suspect

1029
01:07:53,205 --> 01:07:55,245
Speaker 9:  a pretty easy exercise for them to do.

1030
01:07:55,835 --> 01:07:59,485
Speaker 2:  Okay. Right. So we've, we've now got Thread quite established,

1031
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:03,525
Speaker 2:  right? And we've got HomeKit using it, we've got, we've

1032
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:07,045
Speaker 2:  using it, we've got Google and Apple. I think Samsung was also involved in

1033
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:09,325
Speaker 2:  the Thread group here at some point. So they were interested,

1034
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:10,165
Speaker 9:  They were also very early.

1035
01:08:10,635 --> 01:08:14,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So, but we still have these ecosystems. We still have these

1036
01:08:14,735 --> 01:08:18,645
Speaker 2:  silos of the smart home. The smart home is stalling out to some extent at

1037
01:08:18,645 --> 01:08:22,205
Speaker 2:  this point because people are confused, tearing their hair out, trying to

1038
01:08:22,205 --> 01:08:25,965
Speaker 2:  make things work. I've spoken to a few people about this in my time

1039
01:08:25,965 --> 01:08:28,765
Speaker 2:  reporting on matter, but I understand there was a moment,

1040
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:33,685
Speaker 2:  Michelle Turner and yourself from Google, apple, Amazon

1041
01:08:33,685 --> 01:08:37,565
Speaker 2:  counterparts and the ZigBee Alliance all came together to

1042
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:41,245
Speaker 2:  figure this out. Was this kind of a watershed moment like Apple,

1043
01:08:41,505 --> 01:08:45,085
Speaker 2:  Amazon, Google, ZigBee, all sitting down together and being like,

1044
01:08:45,295 --> 01:08:46,445
Speaker 2:  we're gonna work together on this?

1045
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:52,005
Speaker 9:  I think so. I think all the players had reached a point where we

1046
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:55,805
Speaker 9:  sort of had figured out what we need to do to get to the vision of

1047
01:08:55,805 --> 01:08:59,765
Speaker 9:  where we need to go. We think we can make a bigger market, we think

1048
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:03,525
Speaker 9:  we can make it better for consumers. We think we can improve all of this.

1049
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:07,485
Speaker 9:  And so with that, the team started working together, figuring out what the

1050
01:09:07,485 --> 01:09:10,805
Speaker 9:  best of each of these things was and how we were gonna bring it all together.

1051
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:14,205
Speaker 9:  And as somebody who's been using it, certainly it's, it's got warts, but

1052
01:09:14,365 --> 01:09:17,645
Speaker 9:  I think relative to where it was say 10 years ago, 20 years ago,

1053
01:09:18,155 --> 01:09:19,525
Speaker 9:  it's getting there. It's getting to the vision,

1054
01:09:20,105 --> 01:09:23,765
Speaker 2:  Why was it Thread and wifi and why not ZigBee or

1055
01:09:23,905 --> 01:09:27,645
Speaker 2:  Z-Wave or, I mean Bluetooth mesh was an option that some

1056
01:09:27,965 --> 01:09:31,805
Speaker 2:  companies used. There were other things out there. Was this

1057
01:09:31,885 --> 01:09:35,845
Speaker 2:  a political move to some extent? I mean I know with protocols there's

1058
01:09:35,845 --> 01:09:39,725
Speaker 2:  a lot of politics or was it very much based on the

1059
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:42,205
Speaker 2:  technology? Like was it a mix of the two?

1060
01:09:42,505 --> 01:09:45,205
Speaker 9:  No, it was absolutely technology. We really, again,

1061
01:09:46,335 --> 01:09:49,805
Speaker 9:  we're putting the consumer first and in order to have the consumer

1062
01:09:49,805 --> 01:09:53,685
Speaker 9:  experience that those of us who were in product wanted to have, which is,

1063
01:09:53,865 --> 01:09:56,445
Speaker 9:  you know, you start with this product, you start with this product, you start

1064
01:09:56,445 --> 01:10:00,045
Speaker 9:  with this product and, and add incrementally over time and things just

1065
01:10:00,045 --> 01:10:03,685
Speaker 9:  evolve and get better as as you add those products to the mix. We

1066
01:10:03,695 --> 01:10:07,525
Speaker 9:  again had a very fine line on the horizon that

1067
01:10:07,525 --> 01:10:11,165
Speaker 9:  said we don't want people to have to acquire gateways, converters,

1068
01:10:11,435 --> 01:10:14,645
Speaker 9:  bridges, et cetera, just for the sake of converting one protocol to another.

1069
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:18,525
Speaker 9:  But there was another practical reason for all that. Another North Star

1070
01:10:18,865 --> 01:10:22,285
Speaker 9:  was, you know, at Nest we had the Nest detect window door sensor.

1071
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:23,045
Speaker 9:  Oh, I

1072
01:10:23,045 --> 01:10:26,765
Speaker 2:  Love that Fink so much. I'm so sad.

1073
01:10:26,795 --> 01:10:27,285
Speaker 2:  It's gone.

1074
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:31,725
Speaker 9:  The resources on that were mindbogglingly small and

1075
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:34,925
Speaker 9:  the fact that we packed Bluetooth and Thread

1076
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:38,965
Speaker 9:  into that thing and it could connect directly to the Nest cloud. Yeah, it

1077
01:10:38,965 --> 01:10:42,605
Speaker 9:  could connect directly to the security system and to do all that in the form

1078
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,805
Speaker 9:  factor that we did and to have it last as long as it tiny little better.

1079
01:10:45,805 --> 01:10:49,085
Speaker 9:  Tiny. Tiny, exactly. Yeah. Was incredible. Mm. And so what you, what you

1080
01:10:49,085 --> 01:10:51,565
Speaker 9:  learn from an engineering perspective when you're building these products

1081
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:54,605
Speaker 9:  is every protocol you add is call it another

1082
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:59,005
Speaker 9:  128 K of Ram and flash you need. Mm. And so to add this

1083
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:02,485
Speaker 9:  thing that isn't an ip, great, there's another chunk of space we need to

1084
01:11:02,485 --> 01:11:05,285
Speaker 9:  find and now you need to add this thing, another chunk of space you need

1085
01:11:05,285 --> 01:11:08,605
Speaker 9:  to find. And so we already had IP and Bluetooth in there, there just was

1086
01:11:08,605 --> 01:11:12,485
Speaker 9:  no room for anything else. And so between the, the customer vision

1087
01:11:12,585 --> 01:11:16,125
Speaker 9:  of all this stuff connected without gateways, bridges, and, and converters

1088
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:19,685
Speaker 9:  and the engineering constraints of this all has to fit in window and door

1089
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:23,325
Speaker 9:  sensors. It really had to be as simple as possible. And again, IP was, we

1090
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:25,765
Speaker 9:  knew where where we needed to go because we knew we needed to connect to

1091
01:11:25,765 --> 01:11:28,565
Speaker 9:  the cloud. We knew we needed to connect to mobiles, we knew we needed to

1092
01:11:28,565 --> 01:11:32,365
Speaker 9:  connect to other devices that was key. And so we didn't

1093
01:11:32,365 --> 01:11:35,565
Speaker 9:  say no, you couldn't have these other protocols. But ultimately

1094
01:11:36,265 --> 01:11:40,085
Speaker 9:  the way matter brings those into the fore is you sort of virtualize them

1095
01:11:40,155 --> 01:11:43,925
Speaker 9:  into the matter ecosystem. You have hubs or things that sort of say, oh

1096
01:11:44,145 --> 01:11:47,285
Speaker 9:  the ZigBee light bulb over here is actually a matter light. And so you interact

1097
01:11:47,285 --> 01:11:51,205
Speaker 9:  with it from the matter perspective and then that thing reflects that off

1098
01:11:51,205 --> 01:11:54,245
Speaker 9:  into the ZigBee world or the Z-Wave world or whatever it happens to be.

1099
01:11:54,555 --> 01:11:58,165
Speaker 2:  Okay. Well you brought it up. So I, this is a, I love the story,

1100
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:02,005
Speaker 2:  this is wonderful. It's great to ha and it was a really interesting and exciting

1101
01:12:02,075 --> 01:12:05,885
Speaker 2:  like moment it sounds like for everyone in the industry to see

1102
01:12:05,885 --> 01:12:09,685
Speaker 2:  this sort of north star. Okay, we can, we can get there, but I'm gonna kind

1103
01:12:09,685 --> 01:12:11,645
Speaker 2:  of bring us slightly crashing back down to earth because

1104
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:17,325
Speaker 2:  you were going, you were mentioning there that this big selling point here

1105
01:12:17,385 --> 01:12:21,085
Speaker 2:  is we don't need proprietary hubs, bridges and gateways. You know, like to

1106
01:12:21,085 --> 01:12:24,805
Speaker 2:  this point, anyone in the smart home has maybe a HU Bridge, a Lutron Bridge,

1107
01:12:25,385 --> 01:12:28,365
Speaker 2:  an Apple Home Hub, maybe an echo device,

1108
01:12:29,255 --> 01:12:33,245
Speaker 2:  maybe a smart things hub. There's also so many hubs. My, if I showed

1109
01:12:33,245 --> 01:12:36,565
Speaker 2:  you my hub closet, you might have a heart attack. So this is a big selling

1110
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:40,445
Speaker 2:  point, but it really wasn't true, was it? Because Matter does need

1111
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:44,405
Speaker 2:  a hub and Thread needs a hub Thread, border router.

1112
01:12:44,755 --> 01:12:48,485
Speaker 2:  Okay, maybe nomenclature is a little, you know, we, we

1113
01:12:48,955 --> 01:12:52,645
Speaker 2:  some marketing speak the word hub kind of disappeared.

1114
01:12:52,745 --> 01:12:56,565
Speaker 2:  But can you dive in a little bit there just briefly, like what

1115
01:12:56,565 --> 01:13:00,445
Speaker 2:  is it about Matter and Thread that makes it different from what the hub

1116
01:13:00,575 --> 01:13:03,565
Speaker 2:  world we were coming from to today?

1117
01:13:04,475 --> 01:13:08,445
Speaker 9:  Yeah, absolutely. So from a Thread perspective, you have

1118
01:13:08,475 --> 01:13:12,445
Speaker 9:  different roles in the network just as you have in, in the world

1119
01:13:12,445 --> 01:13:16,245
Speaker 9:  of IP or or wifi. In fact you, you know, have access points and

1120
01:13:16,245 --> 01:13:19,525
Speaker 9:  you've got stations and you've got repeaters et cetera. You've got routers

1121
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:23,405
Speaker 9:  and switches and and hubs, et cetera. So from a Thread perspective,

1122
01:13:23,405 --> 01:13:27,285
Speaker 9:  from this plumbing perspective, these different roles are are Networky

1123
01:13:27,685 --> 01:13:31,485
Speaker 9:  plumbing bits. But the cool thing with from a Thread perspective is their

1124
01:13:31,485 --> 01:13:35,365
Speaker 9:  application agnostic. So if I've got a Thread border router or I've got

1125
01:13:35,365 --> 01:13:39,125
Speaker 9:  a Thread router, I could be running HomeKit over, it doesn't matter,

1126
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:42,325
Speaker 9:  doesn't care. I could be running matter over it doesn't know, doesn't care.

1127
01:13:42,745 --> 01:13:45,765
Speaker 9:  So these aren't necessarily sort of proprietary

1128
01:13:46,195 --> 01:13:50,165
Speaker 9:  ecosystem, vertical silo specific bits of networking. They're

1129
01:13:50,165 --> 01:13:53,525
Speaker 9:  just functionalities that you can build into other products. They could be

1130
01:13:53,525 --> 01:13:56,605
Speaker 9:  dedicated if they need to be. But again, going back to the Nest Protect,

1131
01:13:57,105 --> 01:14:00,885
Speaker 9:  we had wifi in the Nest Protect and we had Thread in the Nest Protect. So

1132
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:04,125
Speaker 9:  we already knew AP priori that if you had a house full of Nest protects,

1133
01:14:04,265 --> 01:14:07,965
Speaker 9:  you already had 2, 3, 4, 5 border routers and that and Thread

1134
01:14:07,965 --> 01:14:10,925
Speaker 9:  routers in your home and that you didn't have to think about it, you weren't

1135
01:14:11,005 --> 01:14:14,485
Speaker 9:  thinking about I need to buy these things. Additionally, you just suddenly,

1136
01:14:14,705 --> 01:14:18,285
Speaker 9:  you know, built out these Nest smoke and co detectors and suddenly you had

1137
01:14:18,285 --> 01:14:21,045
Speaker 9:  a Thread network that you didn't even know you had. And so that's really

1138
01:14:21,045 --> 01:14:24,325
Speaker 9:  the key to understanding Thread is it's, it's just networking, it's just

1139
01:14:24,485 --> 01:14:27,445
Speaker 9:  plumbing, it's just infrastructure. Again, no different from the stuff that

1140
01:14:27,445 --> 01:14:30,325
Speaker 9:  you have with your wifi network. You need to have that access point,

1141
01:14:30,655 --> 01:14:32,765
Speaker 2:  Right? And that's the Thread border router,

1142
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:35,885
Speaker 9:  The Thread border router of course is the thing that gets you from the Thread

1143
01:14:35,885 --> 01:14:39,845
Speaker 9:  network to other networks like wifi or Ethernet or DOCSIS or

1144
01:14:39,965 --> 01:14:43,525
Speaker 9:  DSL or whatever it happens to be. And then of course the Thread router is

1145
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:46,725
Speaker 9:  the thing within the network that gets you ho to hop across the mesh,

1146
01:14:46,935 --> 01:14:50,005
Speaker 2:  Right? So you have the Thread water routers, which can be anything which

1147
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:53,965
Speaker 2:  is kind of cool and then matter, you need a hub, which would be

1148
01:14:53,965 --> 01:14:57,685
Speaker 2:  from your ecosystem. But when this all rolled

1149
01:14:57,745 --> 01:15:01,565
Speaker 2:  out, I mean everyone was excited. I think the smart home community users,

1150
01:15:01,745 --> 01:15:05,045
Speaker 2:  not just, you know, as well as manufacturers and companies were, were excited,

1151
01:15:05,435 --> 01:15:08,685
Speaker 2:  were very sort of bullish on Thread because on paper it checks all the boxes.

1152
01:15:09,065 --> 01:15:12,965
Speaker 2:  And some of the first Thread devices I tested were super responsive and really

1153
01:15:12,995 --> 01:15:16,845
Speaker 2:  fast. But then when Matter did launch eventually, which took a

1154
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:20,165
Speaker 2:  while, I know in the scheme of things maybe not that long, but it felt like

1155
01:15:20,205 --> 01:15:24,125
Speaker 2:  a while for us as we were waiting for it, there were problems like only

1156
01:15:24,325 --> 01:15:28,005
Speaker 2:  a few companies had Thread products available. The infrastructure wasn't

1157
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:31,765
Speaker 2:  really there to support the protocol, not at least not in the way that

1158
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:35,405
Speaker 2:  perhaps matter promised. There were only a handful of Thread border

1159
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:39,205
Speaker 2:  routers. Amazon and Samsung were kind of slow to adopt

1160
01:15:39,395 --> 01:15:43,205
Speaker 2:  that protocol even though Samsung had been involved with Thread

1161
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:46,485
Speaker 2:  from the early days. And it really was Apple and Google that seemed to be

1162
01:15:46,485 --> 01:15:49,885
Speaker 2:  pushing it. And we ended up with these weird scenarios where companies had

1163
01:15:49,885 --> 01:15:53,445
Speaker 2:  to print like long lists of, on the sides of their boxes of what you wouldn't

1164
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:57,205
Speaker 2:  you could use to use this product in your home. And it felt like, ah, tearing

1165
01:15:57,205 --> 01:16:01,125
Speaker 2:  my hair out. We're just back to what it was like before. So

1166
01:16:01,425 --> 01:16:05,365
Speaker 2:  do you think there should have maybe been a bit more focus on

1167
01:16:05,365 --> 01:16:09,045
Speaker 2:  infrastructure rollout before the launch of Matter and Thread?

1168
01:16:09,185 --> 01:16:13,005
Speaker 2:  You know, was was that a big misstep or or am I

1169
01:16:13,005 --> 01:16:13,845
Speaker 2:  over egging it?

1170
01:16:15,165 --> 01:16:18,685
Speaker 9:  I think you can look at it both ways. I think there's sort of,

1171
01:16:19,185 --> 01:16:22,725
Speaker 9:  you know, how would you done it retrospectively from a perfect execution

1172
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:26,365
Speaker 9:  perspective. But I think given the state of the market, perfect

1173
01:16:26,505 --> 01:16:30,405
Speaker 9:  was the enemy of of good. And to me, proving things out in the market is

1174
01:16:30,405 --> 01:16:33,085
Speaker 9:  the best feedback that you can get about what actually works and what doesn't.

1175
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:37,045
Speaker 9:  So I think there was value in sort of having the vision,

1176
01:16:37,095 --> 01:16:40,645
Speaker 9:  right, sort of stepping and iterating your way to the product.

1177
01:16:40,985 --> 01:16:44,805
Speaker 9:  And, and again, I think missteps have happened, some experiences from a

1178
01:16:44,965 --> 01:16:47,805
Speaker 9:  customer perspective maybe not been quite as ideal as they could have been.

1179
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:51,205
Speaker 9:  Not quite to where the vision was. But again, I think getting that market

1180
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:55,285
Speaker 9:  feedback early and often was good in terms of providing real time feedback

1181
01:16:55,285 --> 01:16:58,645
Speaker 9:  to make things better. And of course you can always do that within one company

1182
01:16:58,645 --> 01:17:02,045
Speaker 9:  in the lab internally, but when you're collaborating across the industry,

1183
01:17:02,195 --> 01:17:06,125
Speaker 9:  it's kind of hard to to keep all that as, as behind closed doors as you might

1184
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:09,805
Speaker 9:  like. Yeah. And so it, it, it happens maybe a a little bit more out in the

1185
01:17:09,805 --> 01:17:11,725
Speaker 9:  open than, than we would ideally like it to be.

1186
01:17:12,675 --> 01:17:16,365
Speaker 2:  Well, and then the other issue I've seen here since the rollout is

1187
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:19,605
Speaker 2:  you mentioned at the beginning that wifi and Thread are kind of, you know,

1188
01:17:19,725 --> 01:17:23,485
Speaker 2:  partners. They, they, they do similar things but for different applications.

1189
01:17:23,545 --> 01:17:27,165
Speaker 2:  So wifi is good for high bandwidth, high power

1190
01:17:27,465 --> 01:17:30,685
Speaker 2:  use, low power, low bandwidth is great for Thread

1191
01:17:31,265 --> 01:17:35,085
Speaker 2:  and matter works over both wifi and Thread and everyone has

1192
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:38,805
Speaker 2:  wifi. So the infrastructure really wasn't an issue there for people

1193
01:17:38,995 --> 01:17:42,205
Speaker 2:  when a company came out with a matter product that works over wifi. They

1194
01:17:42,205 --> 01:17:45,725
Speaker 2:  don't have to worry if there's a Thread border router in the house. So

1195
01:17:46,225 --> 01:17:49,765
Speaker 2:  one of the things we started to see I think is a lot of companies launching

1196
01:17:50,225 --> 01:17:54,165
Speaker 2:  matter over wifi products that potentially would make more sense

1197
01:17:54,225 --> 01:17:57,925
Speaker 2:  as a matter over Thread product like light switches, some, you know, light

1198
01:17:58,015 --> 01:18:01,445
Speaker 2:  bulbs. And, and we also started to sort of see some

1199
01:18:01,925 --> 01:18:05,805
Speaker 2:  companies start sort of to pull away from Thread because of some of

1200
01:18:05,805 --> 01:18:09,485
Speaker 2:  this confusion and and issues early on.

1201
01:18:10,915 --> 01:18:14,045
Speaker 2:  Nano Leaf is one company that was very bullish on Thread but then recently

1202
01:18:14,205 --> 01:18:18,005
Speaker 2:  launched its own protocol called LightWave. A

1203
01:18:18,015 --> 01:18:21,685
Speaker 2:  carer is one company that offers both dual, now offers dual Thread and

1204
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:25,805
Speaker 2:  ZigBee devices because it's easier for the, I think one of the

1205
01:18:25,805 --> 01:18:28,925
Speaker 2:  reasons they've said to me is it's easier for their consumers if they don't

1206
01:18:28,925 --> 01:18:31,685
Speaker 2:  end up having a Thread border router, they're gonna be able to work with

1207
01:18:31,685 --> 01:18:35,645
Speaker 2:  their ZigBee hub. So I guess it sort of seems a little bit like

1208
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:39,525
Speaker 2:  the future that some of these manufacturers were building for didn't necessarily

1209
01:18:39,705 --> 01:18:43,605
Speaker 2:  arrive when they were, as you've pointed out, we know it was

1210
01:18:43,645 --> 01:18:47,005
Speaker 2:  a work in progress, but why do you think that that has been

1211
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:51,445
Speaker 2:  the adoption of Thread among manufacturers has been

1212
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:55,405
Speaker 2:  slower perhaps or struggle for some than perhaps you

1213
01:18:55,405 --> 01:18:56,285
Speaker 2:  would've wanted it to be?

1214
01:18:57,085 --> 01:19:00,805
Speaker 9:  I think as you, you stand in the home and you look out various windows,

1215
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:04,685
Speaker 9:  you see different views of what are ultimately the same environment. So I

1216
01:19:04,685 --> 01:19:07,405
Speaker 9:  think you can sort of stand on one side of the house and look out one window

1217
01:19:07,745 --> 01:19:10,845
Speaker 9:  and you see that, oh wow, there's, you know, now 220

1218
01:19:11,525 --> 01:19:15,125
Speaker 9:  Thread group member companies, there's now over 600 certified

1219
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:19,085
Speaker 9:  products and solutions. IKEA just came out and said going

1220
01:19:19,085 --> 01:19:23,005
Speaker 9:  forward they're, they're a Thread only. So I think different

1221
01:19:23,285 --> 01:19:26,725
Speaker 9:  companies sort of are at different places and positions in their journey,

1222
01:19:26,905 --> 01:19:30,645
Speaker 9:  but ultimately I think if you've either got a greenfield and you don't have

1223
01:19:30,645 --> 01:19:34,485
Speaker 9:  to think about the past and and legacy or legacy customers, there's sort

1224
01:19:34,485 --> 01:19:38,165
Speaker 9:  of one way to approach and engage with the market and and bet on the market.

1225
01:19:38,665 --> 01:19:41,685
Speaker 9:  But as you move across the house and look out a different window in the environment,

1226
01:19:42,265 --> 01:19:45,245
Speaker 9:  you still ultimately are seeing the same landscape but a different part of

1227
01:19:45,245 --> 01:19:48,565
Speaker 9:  it with a different view. And I think as you look at some players

1228
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:52,885
Speaker 9:  that do have legacy do have existing markets, existing customers to

1229
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:56,165
Speaker 9:  consider, there's a different set of constraints. And I know one of those,

1230
01:19:56,235 --> 01:20:00,125
Speaker 9:  yeah, constraints in particular is if you had a huge ZigBee

1231
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:03,965
Speaker 9:  installed base and you had 1 8 0 2 15 4 radio in your

1232
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,405
Speaker 9:  product, but you suddenly wanna make that product not only ZigBee compatible

1233
01:20:07,745 --> 01:20:11,565
Speaker 9:  but Thread and matter compatible, you now have this challenge in

1234
01:20:11,565 --> 01:20:15,125
Speaker 9:  that to share that 15 four radio across those two

1235
01:20:15,405 --> 01:20:18,965
Speaker 9:  protocols is actually a bit more of an engineering trick than it would

1236
01:20:18,965 --> 01:20:21,845
Speaker 9:  initially seem to be. And if you say that you wanna support both those at

1237
01:20:21,845 --> 01:20:25,805
Speaker 9:  the same time, that's a really challenging engineering problem to solve.

1238
01:20:25,865 --> 01:20:28,845
Speaker 9:  And and ultimately I think they're gonna solve those. But those are tough

1239
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:32,445
Speaker 9:  things to, to make work And I think that maybe explains some of the,

1240
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:34,685
Speaker 9:  the challenges that those players have had.

1241
01:20:35,305 --> 01:20:39,045
Speaker 2:  So what do you think needs to happen in the near term

1242
01:20:39,045 --> 01:20:43,005
Speaker 2:  future to make Thread a success for everyone? To make it

1243
01:20:43,075 --> 01:20:45,965
Speaker 2:  easy for everyone to jump onto that green playing field?

1244
01:20:47,245 --> 01:20:50,885
Speaker 9:  I mean I think really we've got the key components today. I think there's

1245
01:20:50,905 --> 01:20:54,205
Speaker 9:  one issue that probably warrants a bit more

1246
01:20:54,565 --> 01:20:58,405
Speaker 9:  standardization and refining to really make things as good as they can be.

1247
01:20:58,805 --> 01:21:02,205
Speaker 9:  I think Apple and Google have done some really fantastic work on their mobile

1248
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:06,205
Speaker 9:  platforms, but Thread credential sharing is of course a challenge that comes

1249
01:21:06,205 --> 01:21:10,125
Speaker 9:  up a lot in in your content with your audience. Others,

1250
01:21:10,715 --> 01:21:13,245
Speaker 2:  Will you explain just briefly what that issue is?

1251
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:17,325
Speaker 9:  Yeah, absolutely. So like any secure wireless network,

1252
01:21:17,765 --> 01:21:21,525
Speaker 9:  ultimately there's a number of different security credentials for securing

1253
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:25,325
Speaker 9:  actors on that network to make sure that they have permission to be there

1254
01:21:25,325 --> 01:21:28,685
Speaker 9:  or that they have permission to, to act on that network. And one of those

1255
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:32,245
Speaker 9:  is sort of the Thread administrative credential and it's just sort of like

1256
01:21:32,245 --> 01:21:36,165
Speaker 9:  your wifi password that you share or if you're an iOS user and or

1257
01:21:36,165 --> 01:21:39,245
Speaker 9:  next to another iOS user like hey would you like to share the wifi network

1258
01:21:40,005 --> 01:21:43,765
Speaker 9:  password with this other person? It's sort of synonymous with,

1259
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:47,365
Speaker 9:  with a Thread administrative credential. In the early days of Thread

1260
01:21:47,635 --> 01:21:51,045
Speaker 9:  that part of the spec was probably retrospectively

1261
01:21:51,045 --> 01:21:54,485
Speaker 9:  underspecified, but how do we share that credential

1262
01:21:55,385 --> 01:21:58,645
Speaker 9:  was not something, again, we standardized and we didn't, didn't think about

1263
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:02,405
Speaker 9:  how that would happen. But fast forward to where we are today and matter

1264
01:22:02,465 --> 01:22:06,285
Speaker 9:  and everything else, the question then becomes, well I created this

1265
01:22:06,285 --> 01:22:09,725
Speaker 9:  Thread network in my home or my business and now I want to add other devices

1266
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:13,805
Speaker 9:  and maybe they're not in my application ecosystem. How do we give

1267
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:17,205
Speaker 9:  people permission to add devices and share this credential in the way that

1268
01:22:17,205 --> 01:22:20,685
Speaker 9:  we do with wifi? And so that's ultimately the problem is how do you

1269
01:22:20,855 --> 01:22:23,925
Speaker 9:  share in a trustworthy, secure manner this wifi

1270
01:22:24,415 --> 01:22:28,045
Speaker 9:  equivalent to the wifi password, the Thread network administrative password

1271
01:22:28,305 --> 01:22:30,605
Speaker 9:  to other entities, other people, other ecosystems.

1272
01:22:30,865 --> 01:22:34,805
Speaker 2:  So Apple sharing with Amazon and Samsung sharing with Google, and this

1273
01:22:35,135 --> 01:22:39,005
Speaker 2:  comes back to the whole, all these guys are working together, but

1274
01:22:39,185 --> 01:22:40,205
Speaker 2:  how is that really going?

1275
01:22:40,725 --> 01:22:44,605
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So again, it's going as well as it could. And again, ku kudos to

1276
01:22:44,605 --> 01:22:48,445
Speaker 9:  Apple and Google for really saying the first place most people discover

1277
01:22:48,475 --> 01:22:51,725
Speaker 9:  this pain point is the mobile to mobile. Like I've got iOS in my family,

1278
01:22:51,795 --> 01:22:55,005
Speaker 9:  I've got Android. How does that happen across those two platforms? And again,

1279
01:22:55,005 --> 01:22:57,885
Speaker 9:  apple and Google did a great job of collaborating to make that experience

1280
01:22:57,885 --> 01:23:01,685
Speaker 9:  great, but now we need to say, okay, it's not an a mobile

1281
01:23:02,005 --> 01:23:05,245
Speaker 9:  platform, it's not Android, it's not iOS. How do we again standardize that?

1282
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:09,005
Speaker 9:  So It could be something else, another device, another you know, controller

1283
01:23:09,005 --> 01:23:12,445
Speaker 9:  device, a cloud service, whatever that might be. How do we share that?

1284
01:23:13,115 --> 01:23:16,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, And I mean when I remember when Matter launched in 2022

1285
01:23:16,945 --> 01:23:20,205
Speaker 2:  at the launch event, we, you could already see this could be an issue because

1286
01:23:20,205 --> 01:23:23,845
Speaker 2:  the issue that it's created is that people end up with multiple Thread networks

1287
01:23:23,845 --> 01:23:27,685
Speaker 2:  in their home. In theory, that shouldn't be a huge problem for

1288
01:23:27,685 --> 01:23:31,245
Speaker 2:  someone who's new to the smart home. But it is something that I've already,

1289
01:23:31,315 --> 01:23:34,925
Speaker 2:  I've seen from readers having issues with this. Like, so one device can't

1290
01:23:34,925 --> 01:23:38,685
Speaker 2:  necessarily communicate to the other device, it's, it can get messy. And

1291
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:42,125
Speaker 2:  I asked all the ecosystems right at the launch, like how are you gonna solve

1292
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:46,085
Speaker 2:  this? And they all said we're working on it, but like two years later they

1293
01:23:46,085 --> 01:23:50,045
Speaker 2:  still, you said Apple and Google work together, but everyone needs to

1294
01:23:50,045 --> 01:23:53,445
Speaker 2:  work together. And I guess one of the things that sort of exemplifies for

1295
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:57,085
Speaker 2:  me this issue, even though it feels like perhaps a small niche, one that

1296
01:23:57,085 --> 01:23:59,885
Speaker 2:  wouldn't necessarily affect a lot of users, but it

1297
01:24:00,925 --> 01:24:04,685
Speaker 2:  required everyone to work together to solve a so

1298
01:24:04,685 --> 01:24:08,525
Speaker 2:  this solution and they weren't able to do it in the end, the Thread group

1299
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:12,405
Speaker 2:  had to come out and say this is how you're going to do it. So I guess one

1300
01:24:12,405 --> 01:24:15,445
Speaker 2:  of my concerns, And I think a lot of concerns from people in the, in the

1301
01:24:15,685 --> 01:24:19,285
Speaker 2:  industry and users is this is an industry collaboration

1302
01:24:19,505 --> 01:24:23,085
Speaker 2:  matter and Thread is supposed to be about these major ecosystems and

1303
01:24:23,085 --> 01:24:26,965
Speaker 2:  manufacturers all playing nicely together. But are they really, is

1304
01:24:26,965 --> 01:24:30,565
Speaker 2:  this sustainable or could this all still implode from the

1305
01:24:30,705 --> 01:24:31,125
Speaker 2:  inside?

1306
01:24:32,465 --> 01:24:36,285
Speaker 9:  Is it sustainable? I think absolutely, yes. Could it implode

1307
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:39,645
Speaker 9:  from the inside? I think if you look at any one company,

1308
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:44,245
Speaker 9:  the answer is for that specific company, yes, companies

1309
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,725
Speaker 9:  are constantly shifting their priorities where they're investing. I think

1310
01:24:47,725 --> 01:24:51,605
Speaker 9:  if you looked back, you know, in the heydays of, of Nest and Google And I

1311
01:24:51,805 --> 01:24:55,765
Speaker 9:  OT and you said what's the next big thing? What have we predicted ai?

1312
01:24:55,985 --> 01:24:59,085
Speaker 9:  And the answer is probably not. We wouldn't have predicted that watershed

1313
01:24:59,085 --> 01:25:03,005
Speaker 9:  moment when Sha GBT came out and suddenly all this energy and investment

1314
01:25:03,145 --> 01:25:07,045
Speaker 9:  and money came flooding into ai. And so it, it may be that some

1315
01:25:07,485 --> 01:25:09,965
Speaker 9:  companies, one of these companies decides that, you know what Smart Home

1316
01:25:09,965 --> 01:25:12,965
Speaker 9:  is is not where it's at. We're gonna double down on AI and that's where we're

1317
01:25:12,965 --> 01:25:16,525
Speaker 9:  pumping all of our engineering and our money and our cash and, and we're

1318
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:20,365
Speaker 9:  gonna de-emphasize. But I think the use cases for the smart building

1319
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:24,365
Speaker 9:  space, the use cases for Smart Home remain. You talk to builders,

1320
01:25:24,365 --> 01:25:27,645
Speaker 9:  builders still see a tremendous amount of interest in people that wanna buy

1321
01:25:27,745 --> 01:25:31,445
Speaker 9:  new homes that have some level of smart home technology in it. As

1322
01:25:31,775 --> 01:25:35,565
Speaker 9:  again, things are shifting with post pandemic and return to office. And so

1323
01:25:35,565 --> 01:25:39,165
Speaker 9:  it's hard to say what the office of the future exactly looks like, but regardless,

1324
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:42,845
Speaker 9:  people that are owning those properties still wanna optimize resource usage,

1325
01:25:42,865 --> 01:25:46,725
Speaker 9:  energy usage, occupancy usage, et cetera. Ultimately that demands

1326
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:50,485
Speaker 9:  technology to help make those decisions and and run those resources

1327
01:25:50,505 --> 01:25:54,245
Speaker 9:  and optimize those resources. So I think again, short answer, it

1328
01:25:54,565 --> 01:25:57,885
Speaker 9:  continues, it, it has momentum on its own but individual companies may make

1329
01:25:57,885 --> 01:26:00,685
Speaker 9:  the decisions to say, you know, this isn't as important as we thought it

1330
01:26:00,685 --> 01:26:04,235
Speaker 9:  was. We're we're out. That certainly may happen And I suspect will happen.

1331
01:26:05,345 --> 01:26:09,235
Speaker 2:  Well yes, speaking of, of companies that might want to devalue the smart

1332
01:26:09,235 --> 01:26:12,755
Speaker 2:  home side and focus their efforts much more on ai.

1333
01:26:13,495 --> 01:26:17,035
Speaker 2:  Not to make too obvious of a jump here, but I would like to close things

1334
01:26:17,095 --> 01:26:20,875
Speaker 2:  out by come full circle by coming back to Google and

1335
01:26:21,105 --> 01:26:24,915
Speaker 2:  Nest and get your thoughts on how Google is

1336
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:28,795
Speaker 2:  implementing Thread in its Nest hardware today. I was

1337
01:26:28,985 --> 01:26:32,395
Speaker 2:  very vocal about how sad I was when the fourth Gen Nest Learning

1338
01:26:32,485 --> 01:26:36,435
Speaker 2:  thermostat was launched with no sign of Thread. So

1339
01:26:36,485 --> 01:26:40,035
Speaker 2:  would you be able to share just a few of your thoughts slash hopes

1340
01:26:40,335 --> 01:26:44,315
Speaker 2:  on what Google might be doing with its Nest hardware and where you

1341
01:26:44,315 --> 01:26:46,355
Speaker 2:  see the future there when it comes to Thread?

1342
01:26:46,905 --> 01:26:50,355
Speaker 9:  Yeah, absolutely. I'm not affiliated with any particular partner or company

1343
01:26:50,355 --> 01:26:53,715
Speaker 9:  anymore, including Google who is my, my happy employer for

1344
01:26:54,225 --> 01:26:58,075
Speaker 9:  many, many, many years. So I can only speculate and and project.

1345
01:26:58,295 --> 01:27:01,875
Speaker 9:  But I think to give you a short, concise, immediate answer,

1346
01:27:02,835 --> 01:27:06,155
Speaker 9:  I think the, the Google products graveyard killed by

1347
01:27:06,155 --> 01:27:09,915
Speaker 9:  google.com is a very popular, well-known

1348
01:27:10,275 --> 01:27:13,275
Speaker 9:  property. And you know, over the years, for one reason or another, Google

1349
01:27:13,415 --> 01:27:16,915
Speaker 9:  has a lot of initiatives that they decide are, are no longer important for

1350
01:27:17,115 --> 01:27:20,795
Speaker 9:  one reason or another. So that's sort of one way that we can maybe approach

1351
01:27:20,795 --> 01:27:24,555
Speaker 9:  and answer to the question and say maybe hard to say things change.

1352
01:27:24,585 --> 01:27:28,355
Speaker 9:  Yeah. But I think if you sort of look at some of the organizational

1353
01:27:28,575 --> 01:27:32,475
Speaker 9:  and product choices that have been made certainly would seem to me that there

1354
01:27:32,495 --> 01:27:35,875
Speaker 9:  is emphasis doubling down on platform.

1355
01:27:36,415 --> 01:27:39,715
Speaker 9:  So I know that the people at Google that I still have relationships with

1356
01:27:40,075 --> 01:27:43,955
Speaker 9:  doing Thread are still very active, very well supported. The

1357
01:27:43,955 --> 01:27:47,395
Speaker 9:  people at Google doing Matter are still very active, very well supported.

1358
01:27:47,855 --> 01:27:51,835
Speaker 9:  So what I see happening is Google's sort of saying we're a real believer

1359
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:55,395
Speaker 9:  in the platform and the infrastructure and that's the thing that we can do

1360
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:59,115
Speaker 9:  best, but as it concerns products, maybe

1361
01:27:59,405 --> 01:28:03,395
Speaker 9:  ecosystems and partners. So you saw that there was a transition of security

1362
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:07,315
Speaker 9:  from Nest Guard and and Nest detect off to a DT.

1363
01:28:07,455 --> 01:28:11,115
Speaker 9:  And so now as you see a DT trucks rolling around, you see a DT powered by

1364
01:28:11,115 --> 01:28:15,035
Speaker 9:  Google. And so that was a partnership relationship you

1365
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:18,915
Speaker 9:  saw with the Sun setting. Sad as it was of Nest Protect that

1366
01:28:19,275 --> 01:28:22,595
Speaker 9:  a actually Google invested effort to make sure that first alert and the,

1367
01:28:22,635 --> 01:28:26,355
Speaker 9:  I think what is the SC five follow on product actually is interoperable

1368
01:28:26,355 --> 01:28:29,555
Speaker 9:  with the Nest Protect. Yeah, they didn't, they didn't need to do that. But

1369
01:28:29,555 --> 01:28:32,555
Speaker 9:  that I think was a really important investment in the customer and making

1370
01:28:32,555 --> 01:28:35,955
Speaker 9:  sure that there was a seamless transition there. But again, the signal is,

1371
01:28:36,475 --> 01:28:39,195
Speaker 9:  hmm, we're not doubling down in that cat product category that's that's partner

1372
01:28:39,495 --> 01:28:43,275
Speaker 9:  as far as I can see. Speakers, displays, thermostats, cameras

1373
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:47,995
Speaker 9:  still seem to be invested in those well that remain forever. Hard to say.

1374
01:28:48,375 --> 01:28:52,195
Speaker 9:  It seems like speakers with the the locus of AI and an AI interaction

1375
01:28:52,195 --> 01:28:56,035
Speaker 9:  surface, it seems reasonable that they'll continue to do that. I suspect

1376
01:28:56,065 --> 01:28:59,915
Speaker 9:  cameras and the awareness service model that goes with cameras are

1377
01:29:00,075 --> 01:29:03,685
Speaker 9:  probably a a big revenue driver. Yeah. So maybe cameras will continue because

1378
01:29:03,685 --> 01:29:07,645
Speaker 9:  that's a lot of high margin service revenue. But as you And I know in the

1379
01:29:07,645 --> 01:29:10,565
Speaker 9:  actual hardware only business in which there isn't a service backing that

1380
01:29:11,265 --> 01:29:14,005
Speaker 9:  you know, you're either a premium product or it's a race to the bottom and

1381
01:29:14,005 --> 01:29:17,325
Speaker 9:  there's not a whole lot in between. So what happens with thermostats?

1382
01:29:17,755 --> 01:29:21,605
Speaker 9:  Hard to say. I mean again, I know just from how big that market

1383
01:29:21,665 --> 01:29:24,765
Speaker 9:  is, literally hundreds of millions of thermostats have been shipped around

1384
01:29:24,765 --> 01:29:28,565
Speaker 9:  the world. That's a big business. That's a big installed base. My my

1385
01:29:28,565 --> 01:29:31,405
Speaker 9:  gut tells me they'll continue to invest in that but it's hard to say.

1386
01:29:32,245 --> 01:29:35,045
Speaker 2:  Excellent. Well that's really interesting insight. Grant, can I get you to

1387
01:29:35,045 --> 01:29:39,005
Speaker 2:  stay around 'cause just for a few minutes because I have a really interesting

1388
01:29:39,245 --> 01:29:43,165
Speaker 2:  Vergecast hotline question that I think you would be is right up your alley.

1389
01:29:43,165 --> 01:29:44,845
Speaker 2:  Would you be willing to help me out with that one?

1390
01:29:44,975 --> 01:29:47,285
Speaker 9:  Happy to take a look. No promises, but happy to take a look.

1391
01:29:48,075 --> 01:29:51,405
Speaker 2:  Wonderful. Okay, so we're gonna take one more break and then we'll come back

1392
01:29:51,405 --> 01:29:51,965
Speaker 2:  with that question.

1393
01:32:56,865 --> 01:33:00,565
Speaker 2:  All right, we are back. Let's get to a question from The Vergecast

1394
01:33:00,635 --> 01:33:04,325
Speaker 2:  hotline as always. The number is 8 6 6 VERGE

1395
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:08,125
Speaker 2:  one one and the email is vergecast at The Verge dot com.

1396
01:33:08,425 --> 01:33:11,645
Speaker 2:  We love all of your questions and we try to answer at least one on the show

1397
01:33:11,645 --> 01:33:15,525
Speaker 2:  every week. This week. It's a question from John

1398
01:33:15,555 --> 01:33:19,325
Speaker 2:  from Massachusetts who had a surprisingly great experience

1399
01:33:19,325 --> 01:33:23,085
Speaker 2:  with a matter compatible device that he bought having previously had no

1400
01:33:23,115 --> 01:33:26,805
Speaker 2:  idea what that matter was even a thing and it got him to thinking about

1401
01:33:27,045 --> 01:33:30,845
Speaker 2:  a very important question in the smart home. Who gets your data?

1402
01:33:31,615 --> 01:33:32,405
Speaker 2:  Let's have a listen.

1403
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,085
Speaker 13:  Hey R Cast team, this is John from Massachusetts

1404
01:33:38,435 --> 01:33:42,325
Speaker 13:  last night I unboxed a new air conditioner

1405
01:33:42,505 --> 01:33:46,485
Speaker 13:  And I immediately opened up my phone and had

1406
01:33:46,525 --> 01:33:50,405
Speaker 13:  a matter notification saying that this device was ready to set up with

1407
01:33:50,425 --> 01:33:54,045
Speaker 13:  matter. I just scanned the code on the side of the air

1408
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:57,125
Speaker 13:  conditioner and it was in my Google Home instantly.

1409
01:33:57,825 --> 01:34:01,485
Speaker 13:  Who knew that was even a thing? Air conditioners with matter support. I

1410
01:34:01,485 --> 01:34:05,245
Speaker 13:  was surprised by this because there's this little symbol on the box that

1411
01:34:05,245 --> 01:34:08,855
Speaker 13:  says it works with the smart home app. There was

1412
01:34:08,855 --> 01:34:11,575
Speaker 13:  literally an app called Smart Home. How original,

1413
01:34:12,565 --> 01:34:15,975
Speaker 13:  this got me thinking when I'm setting up with Matter,

1414
01:34:16,325 --> 01:34:20,135
Speaker 13:  does the manufacturer get any data, like any user data, any

1415
01:34:20,225 --> 01:34:24,095
Speaker 13:  usage data? Is there a reason why a company might

1416
01:34:24,095 --> 01:34:28,055
Speaker 13:  not want to do matter? Like how they don't like it

1417
01:34:28,055 --> 01:34:31,655
Speaker 13:  when you use CarPlay in a car because they're not getting data they can

1418
01:34:31,655 --> 01:34:35,415
Speaker 13:  work off of? And is that why matter adoption is slowing?

1419
01:34:36,005 --> 01:34:37,775
Speaker 13:  Kind of curious on this. Thanks.

1420
01:34:39,135 --> 01:34:41,775
Speaker 2:  Excellent, thank you John. Yeah, this is a great question. It's actually

1421
01:34:41,775 --> 01:34:44,895
Speaker 2:  something Grant And I have talked about in the past because there have been

1422
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:49,015
Speaker 2:  some companies that have pulled back from Matter, we don't

1423
01:34:49,015 --> 01:34:52,775
Speaker 2:  necessarily know why. There is actually a competing organization or

1424
01:34:52,775 --> 01:34:56,215
Speaker 2:  competing slash potentially symbiotic organization called the Home

1425
01:34:56,215 --> 01:34:59,525
Speaker 2:  Connectivity Alliance, which is specifically for appliance

1426
01:34:59,525 --> 01:35:03,365
Speaker 2:  manufacturers and it uses all cloud-based

1427
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:07,045
Speaker 2:  integrations, which on the surface of it allows each

1428
01:35:07,045 --> 01:35:10,685
Speaker 2:  manufacturer to keep much more control over the

1429
01:35:10,885 --> 01:35:14,245
Speaker 2:  customer's data when using their apps. And In theory

1430
01:35:14,635 --> 01:35:18,485
Speaker 2:  with Matter you can set everything up in Google Home or Apple Home and

1431
01:35:18,485 --> 01:35:22,285
Speaker 2:  never touch the manufacturer app. So it does seem to

1432
01:35:22,285 --> 01:35:26,125
Speaker 2:  most people that that means that I no longer have a relationship directly

1433
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:29,845
Speaker 2:  with that manufacturer and perhaps that may be turning some companies

1434
01:35:29,905 --> 01:35:33,845
Speaker 2:  off from going to matter. So Grant, how

1435
01:35:33,845 --> 01:35:37,565
Speaker 2:  would you answer that question? Is that a reason for companies

1436
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:41,645
Speaker 2:  not to go with matter or is there a way for them to continue

1437
01:35:41,645 --> 01:35:43,245
Speaker 2:  that data sharing if they want to?

1438
01:35:43,945 --> 01:35:47,925
Speaker 9:  It isn't fundamentally a limitation. One of the precepts, sort of North

1439
01:35:47,925 --> 01:35:51,685
Speaker 9:  Stars about creating matter from the get go was local

1440
01:35:51,915 --> 01:35:55,685
Speaker 9:  only. And in particular everyone is very sensitive about data

1441
01:35:55,825 --> 01:35:59,805
Speaker 9:  and data sharing for that reason as well as performance and making sure that

1442
01:35:59,805 --> 01:36:02,085
Speaker 9:  everything still works when the internet's down, all those kind of things.

1443
01:36:02,665 --> 01:36:06,565
Speaker 9:  So fundamentally matter sets forth the precept that your

1444
01:36:06,565 --> 01:36:09,885
Speaker 9:  data is important, your security is important, and keeping that all in the

1445
01:36:09,885 --> 01:36:13,645
Speaker 9:  home by default is important. Now that's sort of the

1446
01:36:13,645 --> 01:36:17,405
Speaker 9:  default answer, but we talked to the, the Nest detect window and door sensor.

1447
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:20,325
Speaker 9:  We talked about how that sensor, in addition to being connected on the local

1448
01:36:20,325 --> 01:36:24,085
Speaker 9:  Thread network, also had the capability for a border router to talk

1449
01:36:24,365 --> 01:36:27,725
Speaker 9:  directly to Nest cloud services. So you talked about the instance in which

1450
01:36:27,785 --> 01:36:31,765
Speaker 9:  you've got this smart home, I'm using Apple's home kit app, I'm using Google

1451
01:36:31,765 --> 01:36:35,245
Speaker 9:  Smart Home app, I'm interacting in John's case, the air conditioner.

1452
01:36:36,025 --> 01:36:39,845
Speaker 9:  Now let's say that air conditioner has wifi, could that air

1453
01:36:39,845 --> 01:36:43,085
Speaker 9:  conditioner talk directly through the wifi network to the air conditioner's

1454
01:36:43,085 --> 01:36:46,325
Speaker 9:  manufacturer? Absolutely. A matter has no prohibition against that.

1455
01:36:47,005 --> 01:36:50,685
Speaker 9:  That's absolutely allowed. So if the vendor is saying, the only way I can

1456
01:36:50,755 --> 01:36:54,525
Speaker 9:  sort of get insight into customer interactions is through a mobile app, okay,

1457
01:36:54,525 --> 01:36:57,525
Speaker 9:  that's a, that's a particular design and engineering product choice, but

1458
01:36:57,525 --> 01:37:01,125
Speaker 9:  there's no reason to say that that air conditioner can't again still be connected

1459
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:04,765
Speaker 9:  to the vendor's cloud sending telemetry diagnostic data. How many cycles,

1460
01:37:04,905 --> 01:37:07,805
Speaker 9:  you know, what year was the average temperature? Any of that kind of stuff

1461
01:37:08,565 --> 01:37:11,405
Speaker 9:  directly through the cloud, through the air conditioner. Let's say that air

1462
01:37:11,405 --> 01:37:14,965
Speaker 9:  conditioner also implemented Thread because again, Thread is IP connected

1463
01:37:14,965 --> 01:37:18,205
Speaker 9:  just like the Nest detect window door sensor. It could also connect through

1464
01:37:18,205 --> 01:37:21,525
Speaker 9:  a border router to the provider's cloud. Again, share that data. So

1465
01:37:22,235 --> 01:37:25,885
Speaker 9:  data sharing and matter are sort of orthogonal issues. They're not

1466
01:37:26,245 --> 01:37:29,805
Speaker 9:  absolutely related, but matter says by default, within matter itself,

1467
01:37:30,635 --> 01:37:34,405
Speaker 9:  data stays in the home, interactions stay within the home. But again, let's

1468
01:37:34,405 --> 01:37:38,205
Speaker 9:  say your control surface is a Amazon Alexa or

1469
01:37:38,325 --> 01:37:41,525
Speaker 9:  a Google speaker device, there's nothing to say that those

1470
01:37:41,975 --> 01:37:45,685
Speaker 9:  can't interact with matter within the home, but then couldn't share those

1471
01:37:45,955 --> 01:37:49,725
Speaker 9:  bits of data up to the clouds of those providers. And there couldn't be relationships

1472
01:37:49,785 --> 01:37:53,405
Speaker 9:  to say Google and you know, works with Google Cloud interactions with, you

1473
01:37:53,405 --> 01:37:56,685
Speaker 9:  know, whoever the provider is. So there's all sorts of different opportunities

1474
01:37:56,745 --> 01:38:00,365
Speaker 9:  for data sharing to still occur and matter. Neither prohibits it nor

1475
01:38:00,395 --> 01:38:04,325
Speaker 9:  enables it. It's just, it's not part of what matter is about is data sharing.

1476
01:38:04,435 --> 01:38:06,405
Speaker 9:  Does that answer the question? Hopefully?

1477
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:10,205
Speaker 2:  Well, yeah, And I guess so for, especially for our listeners, a lot of them

1478
01:38:10,205 --> 01:38:13,685
Speaker 2:  are interested in a smart home that does not share their data with anyone,

1479
01:38:14,025 --> 01:38:17,805
Speaker 2:  but with matter and Thread and even wifi like it, it

1480
01:38:17,985 --> 01:38:21,685
Speaker 2:  can all be working locally in your home without a dependent internet

1481
01:38:21,685 --> 01:38:24,325
Speaker 2:  connection. Right? Absolutely. Ly it's all working over your local network.

1482
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:28,325
Speaker 2:  Absolutely. And you can control that as you say, you mentioned from ero or

1483
01:38:28,505 --> 01:38:32,405
Speaker 2:  you can actually control that point of connection with the

1484
01:38:32,565 --> 01:38:36,405
Speaker 2:  internet, but each device within the matter ecosystem is

1485
01:38:36,405 --> 01:38:40,285
Speaker 2:  only going to communicate with the matter ecosystem. You choose be

1486
01:38:40,285 --> 01:38:43,725
Speaker 2:  that Apple Home or Home Assistant or Alexa or Google

1487
01:38:44,225 --> 01:38:47,285
Speaker 2:  or any of the other companies that are starting to sort of, we've seen quite

1488
01:38:47,285 --> 01:38:51,245
Speaker 2:  a few platforms now that work with Matter. So there's a lot

1489
01:38:51,245 --> 01:38:55,165
Speaker 2:  of choice here. So I guess the answer really is your data is going

1490
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:58,245
Speaker 2:  to be shared with whichever platform you use

1491
01:38:58,985 --> 01:39:02,805
Speaker 2:  and look at what their data sharing policies are in terms

1492
01:39:02,805 --> 01:39:06,005
Speaker 2:  of what might leave your home and what can stay locally. And if you're very

1493
01:39:06,245 --> 01:39:09,565
Speaker 2:  advanced, you can make sure no one can talk to the internet at all.

1494
01:39:09,905 --> 01:39:10,565
Speaker 9:  Yep, exactly.

1495
01:39:11,065 --> 01:39:14,885
Speaker 2:  But of course there are benefits of connecting to the web, to the ip.

1496
01:39:15,345 --> 01:39:18,085
Speaker 9:  Yep, absolutely. Yeah, you really brought home an important point, which

1497
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:21,965
Speaker 9:  is with matter, you as the consumer get to choose. Yes. And it's

1498
01:39:21,965 --> 01:39:25,525
Speaker 9:  your conscious choice that you are choosing what gets shared and what doesn't.

1499
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:28,405
Speaker 9:  And So if you're not comfortable with that sharing then you, you get to say,

1500
01:39:28,485 --> 01:39:31,685
Speaker 9:  I don't want to do that. Of course, as we said, that means things can happen

1501
01:39:31,705 --> 01:39:34,525
Speaker 9:  on the side channel, But that is outside of matter,

1502
01:39:35,095 --> 01:39:38,805
Speaker 2:  Right? So then you just, it's, it's about which companies, which air conditioner

1503
01:39:38,805 --> 01:39:41,885
Speaker 2:  you bought. We don't know which brand you went with, so we can't answer that

1504
01:39:41,885 --> 01:39:45,285
Speaker 2:  one. But yes, that's where you have to keep an eye on if you are concerned

1505
01:39:45,285 --> 01:39:49,085
Speaker 2:  about data sharing. So hopefully that answered your question. John,

1506
01:39:49,495 --> 01:39:53,285
