00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:06,765
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of The Vergecast. I'm

3
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:09,765
Speaker 2:  your friend David Pierce, and I am currently in, I believe it's called Murphy

4
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:13,605
Speaker 2:  Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tennessee. We just had a long weekend of

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:17,485
Speaker 2:  family time and Dolly Parton related shenanigans, and at one point I drank

6
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:21,125
Speaker 2:  blueberry Blackberry wine, which I have a lot of thoughts about. But now

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,805
Speaker 2:  we're headed home and that means it's about to be flight number two for our

8
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:27,845
Speaker 2:  10 month old. Flight number one actually went pretty well, which I assume

9
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:31,325
Speaker 2:  means this one is going to be a total disaster. So to anyone who's listening

10
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:34,045
Speaker 2:  who may have been on this flight with us, just know that I'm very sorry.

11
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,685
Speaker 2:  Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up. We've asked over the last few

12
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:41,325
Speaker 2:  weeks people to send us questions about The Verge and The Vergecast, and

13
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:44,205
Speaker 2:  you've sent in some awesome ones. Thanks to everybody who called the hotline

14
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:47,965
Speaker 2:  and everybody who sent us emails, we got questions about how we run The

15
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:51,165
Speaker 2:  Vergecast, how we think about the stuff that we cover, what gear we use,

16
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:55,325
Speaker 2:  what Neli is like as a boss. Spoiler alert, the worst, but we'll get to

17
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:59,245
Speaker 2:  that. It's a super fun show. It's a weirdly odd thing

18
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:03,085
Speaker 2:  to spend all this time talking about yourself. It was kind of a fun exercise

19
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:06,925
Speaker 2:  for the three of us to do, along with Liam and Angel, our producers. So again,

20
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:10,485
Speaker 2:  thanks to everybody who's sent in questions. This is super fun. All of that

21
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:14,045
Speaker 2:  is coming up in just a sec, but first I gotta go get on this plane. Wish

22
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:17,925
Speaker 2:  me luck and maybe even more so wish luck to everyone sitting within six rows

23
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:20,045
Speaker 2:  of us. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

24
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:26,815
Speaker 3:  Support for The Vergecast comes from Quest three, the new mixed reality headset

25
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,735
Speaker 3:  from Meta. The new Meta Quest three lets you expand your worlds in ways you

26
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:34,495
Speaker 3:  never thought possible. It's their most powerful quest. Yet Meta sent me

27
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:38,135
Speaker 3:  one to try and I was so amazed by how easy it was to set up

28
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:41,535
Speaker 3:  with the Quest three. You can live in the action. You can feel what it's

29
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:45,055
Speaker 3:  like to step into the shoes of an assassin and Assassin's Creed nexus.

00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:55,705
Speaker 2:  Welcome back All, right? I made it. Home Flight went pretty well, thanks

47
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:59,685
Speaker 2:  to some well-timed PB and J sandwiches. I picked up a cold along the

48
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:03,605
Speaker 2:  way, but we're here. I'm in the studio. Neli and Alex are here

49
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:07,465
Speaker 2:  with me. Let's get into it. Neli Patel. Hello. Hello,

50
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:11,585
Speaker 2:  Alex Cranz. Hello. Hi. This is the day we

51
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:15,305
Speaker 2:  talk about the first cast, which we never normally do. We're not obsessed

52
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:19,065
Speaker 2:  with ourselves or our own podcast at all. But today people

53
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,745
Speaker 2:  ask us questions about the show, about The Verge. We got an

54
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:26,305
Speaker 2:  alarming number of questions asking if Neli is a good boss, which we're gonna

55
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:30,225
Speaker 2:  come around to. I don't know what people think or what to make of that,

56
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,545
Speaker 2:  but we got that question a number of times. So we're gonna come to that.

57
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:36,345
Speaker 2:  But basically, just so you guys know, I have set this up in such a way that

58
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:38,865
Speaker 2:  we got a bunch of questions about The Vergecast, which we're gonna answer.

59
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,025
Speaker 2:  Then we're gonna take a break. Then we got a bunch of questions about The

60
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:46,105
Speaker 2:  Verge, which we're gonna answer. And then we got a bunch of questions about

61
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:49,225
Speaker 2:  just like our feelings about the future. So I figured that's a good thing

62
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:52,185
Speaker 2:  to end on. That's good. So we'll end with that. So let's just dive right

63
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:56,065
Speaker 2:  in. You guys ready? Let's do this. Yeah. All, right? The first one we have,

64
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,105
Speaker 2:  this one's from Alex

65
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:58,345
Speaker 4:  Neil as a good boss.

66
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:04,385
Speaker 5:  Hi, this is Alex from Falls Church Virginia. I wanna say I

67
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,425
Speaker 5:  love Vergecast, I love decoder. I've learned a lot from you all

68
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:12,145
Speaker 5:  and laughed along with you all. And. what I wanna know is, David

69
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:15,825
Speaker 5:  Pierce has said a few times or there have been jokes about how much David

70
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:19,385
Speaker 5:  Pierce hates decoder. And I wanted to know

71
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:23,625
Speaker 5:  is, does David Pierce actually hate decoder? Is this a running joke?

72
00:04:24,245 --> 00:04:28,105
Speaker 5:  Did I miss something in an early podcast about this? So I? I just

73
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:31,665
Speaker 5:  am curious about the history about how and why David

74
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:35,785
Speaker 5:  Pierce hates decoder. Thanks very much. I look forward to

75
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:37,305
Speaker 5:  hearing your response.

76
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,305
Speaker 4:  I wanna know the answer to this question too.

77
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:43,145
Speaker 2:  The beauty of this is, this will be quick because yes, I absolutely hate

78
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:46,905
Speaker 2:  decoder. No, I love decoder and I actually, a thing we have talked about

79
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:50,505
Speaker 2:  a bunch recently is how to sort of bring our

80
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:54,465
Speaker 2:  podcasts closer together and do more stuff together like Neli.

81
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:57,705
Speaker 2:  I'm curious from your perspective, I don't hate decoder, but I think one

82
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,945
Speaker 2:  of the funny challenges of decoder and The Vergecast is that you are on both

83
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:04,625
Speaker 2:  of them. Yeah. And I know for a fact that you spend a lot of time

84
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,345
Speaker 2:  trying to figure out what goes where on our many, many two

85
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:12,305
Speaker 2:  podcasts, So, I think the ongoing question for me is like, how

86
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:15,545
Speaker 2:  do these two shows differ from each other? Especially given the fact that

87
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,745
Speaker 2:  one of the hosts is the same person. So

88
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:21,465
Speaker 4:  The the the top line is a decoder is a business show and

89
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:25,265
Speaker 4:  The Vergecast is a product show, a tech product show that is not

90
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:29,145
Speaker 4:  actually a good guideline. Everything is the same thing on our show.

91
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:32,345
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like I on decoder, I ask people what the products they make. I think

92
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:36,305
Speaker 4:  that's the most important and interesting and illuminating way to get

93
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:40,225
Speaker 4:  to the heart of like what a executive does. Like

94
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:42,065
Speaker 4:  if you're an executive and show decoder, you can't talk about your products.

95
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:45,465
Speaker 4:  Like I I know a lot about you as an executive. Yes. On the flip side, and

96
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:47,865
Speaker 4:  I think this is actually more important, it's funny that David jokes about

97
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:50,985
Speaker 4:  how much he hates decoder. We have only recently talked about bringing those

98
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:54,865
Speaker 4:  shows together. And I actually recently said to David that I had been

99
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,470
Speaker 4:  waiting for someone else to have that idea

100
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:02,605
Speaker 4:  because if I did it then I'm just munging everything together. Sure. And

101
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:06,005
Speaker 4:  when David came back and we were expanding The Vergecast, I I wanted to make

102
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:09,805
Speaker 4:  sure The Vergecast had a lot of space to grow into the next version of

103
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:13,045
Speaker 4:  itself, especially with David hosting the second episode. I think that's

104
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,685
Speaker 4:  done. I don't know, David, you you tell me, but it was your idea the other

105
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:18,485
Speaker 4:  day when you, when you said that to me, So I think that process is done.

106
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:22,405
Speaker 4:  And I do think we should, we can start talking about the interviews on decoder

107
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:26,085
Speaker 4:  more running this, clips more like using that the same way that we use

108
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:30,125
Speaker 4:  the other journalism on the site to enhance this show. 'cause it's, it's,

109
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,565
Speaker 4:  it's right there. I I don't think there's any particular reason that they

110
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:37,405
Speaker 4:  need to be so far apart, except you tell me. I think the character I play

111
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:40,245
Speaker 4:  on decoder is a little different than the character. I, I am on the Vergecast,

112
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:44,085
Speaker 4:  which is much more like myself, You know on decoder. It's, it's, it's a game.

113
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:47,405
Speaker 4:  It's a game that executives can try to win, which is, are you good at your

114
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:47,525
Speaker 4:  job?

115
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:51,845
Speaker 2:  I do like every time I start a decoder episode and I hear you doing the intro,

116
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:53,365
Speaker 2:  I'm like, oh, it's business Neli.

117
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:54,925
Speaker 4:  Like it's, it's,

118
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:59,005
Speaker 2:  It's like grownup Neli is the one who runs decoder and Bonkers Neli is

119
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,085
Speaker 2:  the one we get on The Vergecast. It's great. Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:02,765
Speaker 6:  Decoder Neli wears a tie.

121
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:04,005
Speaker 2:  Exactly.

122
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:07,805
Speaker 4:  But yeah, I, I, I think, I just think we've hit a pretty natural point in

123
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:11,205
Speaker 4:  the evolution of both of these shows where there's no reason to keep 'em

124
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:13,885
Speaker 4:  apart. I think it's very funny to have fake beef and we'll keep doing that

125
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:14,085
Speaker 4:  forever.

126
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,165
Speaker 2:  I do hate decoder, just to be very clear.

127
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,245
Speaker 6:  Decoder is the worst.

128
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:21,205
Speaker 2:  Okay. So that's, yeah, that's a good one. I think in general, like as we

129
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:25,045
Speaker 2:  grow our podcast universe, the big question for me is like how do you do

130
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,645
Speaker 2:  all that in a way that is cool but also like rewards people for listening

131
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:32,005
Speaker 2:  to everything? 'cause the thing that I hate, and there are podcasts out there

132
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:35,925
Speaker 2:  that I will not name that do this, is like they have shows that are essentially

133
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:38,645
Speaker 2:  just like compilations of other shows. Yeah. And so you're like, the more

134
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:42,485
Speaker 2:  I engage with you, the less it feels like it's worth my time

135
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:45,165
Speaker 2:  And. what I really don't wanna do is that where it's like if you've listened

136
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,125
Speaker 2:  to decoder and then you listen to The Vergecast, it's just like decoder again

137
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:52,325
Speaker 2:  or vice versa. Yep. I think that's very bad. But if we can find ways to put

138
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:55,525
Speaker 2:  those things together that like make sense and are good,

139
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:56,485
Speaker 2:  I'm all

140
00:07:56,485 --> 00:08:00,405
Speaker 4:  For it. Also, the point is to like grow, right? Like not in a rapacious

141
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:03,405
Speaker 4:  capitalistic way, but it's like find new audiences and like be service to

142
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,965
Speaker 4:  them. And if we're all, if we just make more Vergecast or

143
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:10,285
Speaker 4:  it's all decoder, we're actually not gonna grow. Like the things need to

144
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:13,765
Speaker 4:  be different so they can go attract different groups of people. And that

145
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:16,205
Speaker 4:  that's always just sort of on my mind. Like, are we just making more of the

146
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,925
Speaker 4:  same thing or are we actually making different products for different customers?

147
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,205
Speaker 4:  That's like the most decoder thing I've ever said. I'm gonna quit now.

148
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:25,525
Speaker 2:  Neil. I just put the tie on as he was saying. All. right. Let's get to the

149
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:29,165
Speaker 2:  next one. This is an email from James, which I'm using as kind of a proxy

150
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:33,125
Speaker 2:  for a bunch of emails. We got all on roughly the same subject.

151
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,485
Speaker 2:  James says, over time there have been a number of comments about Neli using

152
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:39,805
Speaker 2:  an SLR for his webcam, but I don't think he's ever given the details of that

153
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:42,485
Speaker 2:  setup and how he runs it. I'd love to know more of those details as I'm thinking

154
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:45,765
Speaker 2:  about how I might set up a better remote setup at home than just me sitting

155
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:49,405
Speaker 2:  in front of my computer. And the question we've gotten from a bunch of people

156
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:53,725
Speaker 2:  is just how, what gear do you use when you sit down to record

157
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:56,885
Speaker 2:  the podcast? They've asked this question about all three of us Neli. I think

158
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:59,565
Speaker 2:  you talk about it the most. And also you have that weird camera that hangs

159
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:02,485
Speaker 2:  down in front of your computer. So you've gotten it the most. So why don't

160
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:04,885
Speaker 2:  you start just like you're in the studio right now, but when you're at home,

161
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,125
Speaker 2:  you also just moved. So you're rethinking this. What is, what is the Neli

162
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,045
Speaker 2:  Patel home studio setup like right now? Yeah.

163
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:13,765
Speaker 4:  First I want to point out that David and Alex have gone through

164
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:17,525
Speaker 4:  just an incredible array of camera setups. Oh yeah. Yeah. Just the

165
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:20,005
Speaker 4:  most over complicated overthinking

166
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:23,165
Speaker 4:  software dependent. That's

167
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:23,405
Speaker 2:  Accurate.

168
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:26,645
Speaker 4:  Like at one point Alex Trans is like, You know what? I'm gonna hinge my career

169
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:31,005
Speaker 4:  on Sony software. That's a real choice that she attempted to make. I'm still

170
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:31,405
Speaker 6:  Here though.

171
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:36,205
Speaker 4:  It's true. We've survived. I'm just saying in the background of me

172
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:40,605
Speaker 4:  doing the dumbest thing, they're like overthinking it. So my setup

173
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:44,525
Speaker 4:  is super dumb. I am rethinking it 'cause we just moved and I, I've got some

174
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:47,525
Speaker 4:  new dedicated space to, to to monkey with, but it is

175
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:51,845
Speaker 4:  Sony's ZB ones. I use them both as the webcam for my meeting camera

176
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:55,685
Speaker 4:  at work and is the camera for the podcast setup. So it's a ZB one, they're

177
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:59,525
Speaker 4:  mounted on arms, they're fed into HDMI capture cards. That's

178
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:03,365
Speaker 4:  it. And I turn them on and it is a hardware solution

179
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:04,245
Speaker 4:  that looks good

180
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:08,125
Speaker 2:  Other than being expensive. That sounds like a pretty straightforward

181
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,485
Speaker 2:  setup. Yeah.

182
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:13,365
Speaker 4:  What I wanna get to is a setup at home that

183
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:17,485
Speaker 4:  looks as much like the look that we have in the studio. So it's

184
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:21,365
Speaker 4:  not jarring to the audience. Depending on where I am, this is

185
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:24,085
Speaker 4:  much more of a big deal for decoder because we're subject to other people's

186
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:28,005
Speaker 4:  schedules. So I, just wanna make it look like no matter where I am

187
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:31,925
Speaker 4:  or where we're doing a show, the look is the same. So that's kind of on my

188
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:35,845
Speaker 4:  mind as we, as I build up my new space, but sort of as a pandemic

189
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,325
Speaker 4:  panic purchase. Like I need a webcam that looks good. The ZV one was perfect

190
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:43,285
Speaker 4:  in its moment. Now they're onto the ZV two. I bet you could find new ZV ones

191
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:47,165
Speaker 4:  are cheap, but there's a bunch of Sony menus you gotta dig through and and

192
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:51,005
Speaker 4:  settings and da da da da da. It is not happy doing this all the time. Sometimes

193
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:54,485
Speaker 4:  it overheats and you gotta put it in different one whatever. You can get

194
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:57,525
Speaker 4:  it to a place where it just reliably serves as a webcam when you turn it

195
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:01,485
Speaker 4:  on. And all of that is hardware and not software. And I

196
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:04,125
Speaker 4:  cannot convince these two to stop using software.

197
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:07,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All, right? Alex go. What's yours? Okay.

198
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,285
Speaker 6:  The one I'm currently using Bulletproof for the last

199
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:15,125
Speaker 6:  two, two weeks so far is the, the

200
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:17,045
Speaker 6:  Insta 360 link. Oh

201
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:19,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This is very popular in our reviews team. Yeah.

202
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:22,965
Speaker 6:  Liam sent it to me because my last camera was the

203
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:27,085
Speaker 6:  Opal C one and it kept overheating and turning off during the recordings,

204
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,405
Speaker 6:  which was the theme for all of my cameras thus far. So we'll see how the

205
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,245
Speaker 6:  Insta 360 link does. But the, the Sony Sony

206
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:39,085
Speaker 6:  Imaging webcam was my original and it was plugging into

207
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:43,125
Speaker 6:  a Sony A seven three and it did not, did not do the

208
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:43,765
Speaker 6:  job very well.

209
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:47,725
Speaker 2:  The combination of old camera bad software is really just,

210
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:51,525
Speaker 6:  It was really bad. Well then I got like, I, like Peter was onto me and he

211
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,245
Speaker 6:  was like, just go get a cord and I got a cable. But unfortunately

212
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:59,525
Speaker 6:  it still would overheat constantly because the Sony A seven three is not

213
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:03,205
Speaker 6:  meant to be on no. Continuously shooting for an hour at a time. So

214
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:07,245
Speaker 6:  yeah, now I'm on that and I, I rock a seven or an SM

215
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:11,165
Speaker 6:  seven B Sure mic. Just the old fancy standard. It's very

216
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:15,085
Speaker 6:  fancy. It used to run into an MO two M two but there

217
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:18,845
Speaker 6:  was a terrible buzz periodically that no one could figure out

218
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:22,965
Speaker 6:  why it started or would stop and fine. Our audio

219
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,845
Speaker 6:  producer said Stop it and sent me a scarlet

220
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:30,765
Speaker 4:  They sent you the other entry level Yeah. Interface that no one likes

221
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:34,925
Speaker 2:  Alex has steadfastly refused to stop using her stupid hardware and

222
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,565
Speaker 2:  software. So I love it. Many times over the last 12 months we're like, Alex,

223
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:42,245
Speaker 2:  stop using the weird Nvidia thing. And she's like, no, I want to use the

224
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:42,925
Speaker 2:  weird NVIDIA

225
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:43,085
Speaker 4:  Thing.

226
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:44,685
Speaker 6:  It should work. Damn it,

227
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,885
Speaker 4:  It should work. By the way, what I'll tell you if if you go out to buy AUSB

228
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:52,085
Speaker 4:  to htm I capture card, you, you think they're all the same. They're not.

229
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:55,685
Speaker 4:  So you're not, you instinctively refuse to pay for a name brand. You'll go

230
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:58,885
Speaker 4:  on Amazon and be like, I could spend $20 in the name brand one or I could

231
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:02,765
Speaker 4:  spend seven on the alphabet soup brand. And there's a difference. I

232
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:05,965
Speaker 4:  just promise you there's a difference. Once you're like find yourself troubleshooting

233
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:09,925
Speaker 4:  like one UB dongle for three weeks, you're like, oh I should've just

234
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:13,285
Speaker 4:  spent this month. My time is worth infinitely more than $23.

235
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:16,805
Speaker 4:  And I, I'm not telling you that that happened to me, I'm just, I'm warning

236
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:17,765
Speaker 4:  you against an outcome

237
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,485
Speaker 6:  Hasn't happened to anyone on this show.

238
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:23,445
Speaker 2:  Do you guys ever feel like it's a miracle we actually successfully make a

239
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:24,325
Speaker 2:  podcast? Everything?

240
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:29,925
Speaker 2:  My setup is actually very similar to Alex's. I think I've been through an

241
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:33,845
Speaker 2:  even longer series of insane webcam ideas. I also had

242
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:36,925
Speaker 2:  an opal for a long time and then I got so annoyed with the Opal. I went back

243
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:40,885
Speaker 2:  to the Logitech C nine 20 that everybody has, it doesn't look very

244
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:44,605
Speaker 2:  good but It works really well. I had a long run of using

245
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:48,245
Speaker 2:  my phone as my webcam with the camo app, which is

246
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,885
Speaker 2:  wonderful. The only downside, which

247
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:53,765
Speaker 4:  Was hilarious because we couldn't text David, we couldn't send, he couldn't

248
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:57,045
Speaker 4:  use his phone while we were podcasting, which

249
00:13:57,305 --> 00:14:00,565
Speaker 2:  Is on one hand like useful that it forced me to pay attention to meetings

250
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:03,685
Speaker 2:  more, which was good. But the other part is like you're just constantly

251
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:08,085
Speaker 2:  rigging up and de rigging your webcam, which is very annoying but it looked

252
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:11,605
Speaker 2:  really good. Worked super well. So if you just like have a second phone lying

253
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:15,205
Speaker 2:  around, that's a great idea. But yeah, I'm also now on the Insta 360.

254
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:18,845
Speaker 2:  It works fine. I occasionally accidentally turn on the auto tracking and

255
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:22,005
Speaker 2:  it just follows me around my room, which creeps me out. But that's the best

256
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:25,685
Speaker 2:  part. Other, other than that, no complaints. It works pretty well. Webcams

257
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:28,725
Speaker 2:  are not as good as they should be is my overarching takeaway.

258
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you just buy a Sony ZV one, you put it on an arm, you mount the arm

259
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,005
Speaker 4:  at a ba eye level and you look down the barrel and everyone's like, what

260
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:38,445
Speaker 4:  magic are you doing? And it's like, I spent $500. That's the magic.

261
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:39,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

262
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:42,005
Speaker 2:  So do you have it? You have it in front of your computer screen?

263
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:45,885
Speaker 4:  So I have two. I have two setups 'cause I, I need to have physical

264
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:50,205
Speaker 4:  distance between podcasting mode and work mode. So I've got

265
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:53,845
Speaker 4:  the 2015 iMac, which is the podcast rig. And on that one the arm

266
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:57,565
Speaker 4:  comes down over in front of the screen. So I can have my notes

267
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:00,485
Speaker 4:  behind the camera, but then I can just like look down the barrel of the lens

268
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:03,605
Speaker 4:  and it, because it's a 27 inch screen, you can kind of just like make it

269
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:07,445
Speaker 4:  all work. And then on the sort of like the Zoom setup, I've got

270
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:11,325
Speaker 4:  my delightful Samsung Curve TV off to the side. It is actually great

271
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:15,205
Speaker 4:  for this purpose and the camera is on an arm and it's right in the

272
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,205
Speaker 4:  middle of that display. Got it. So I'm kind of just like always looking.

273
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:22,165
Speaker 4:  It looks like I'm looking at people and then I have my laptop there and that

274
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:24,805
Speaker 4:  that, I don't know if that is, I don't know if that's gonna persist. That

275
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:28,525
Speaker 4:  was like a, I made it during the pandemic and I convinced myself it was good.

276
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:29,085
Speaker 4:  I

277
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,965
Speaker 6:  Mean It works except for whenever there's someone directly behind your camera.

278
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And you're like, I got everybody and one person

279
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:37,325
Speaker 4:  And I forget the one person in the Zoom square. If you're listening to this,

280
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:40,205
Speaker 4:  the Google Meet team is listening to this. Make it So. I can block out the

281
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,405
Speaker 4:  middle square So I can put the camera in front of it like

282
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:43,845
Speaker 2:  The free space on the bingo card. Just

283
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,645
Speaker 4:  Block that. I just, just leave one square blank.

284
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:49,165
Speaker 2:  Alright, let's move on. This one we're just gonna do, because we get this

285
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:52,525
Speaker 2:  all the time and we should answer it on the show Again,

286
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:56,605
Speaker 2:  this is an email we got from George that says, it's been a while since I

287
00:15:56,605 --> 00:16:00,005
Speaker 2:  heard why you all don't do chapters. Figured I'd see if you all are using

288
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:02,845
Speaker 2:  the same reason. If it's not possible with your current contract, are you

289
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,965
Speaker 2:  all considering moving to another service? Please let me know who I should

290
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,605
Speaker 2:  be directing my inquiry to and I would bug them. People are so

291
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:13,805
Speaker 2:  mad that we don't have chapters in the audio version of this podcast. Liam,

292
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:17,405
Speaker 2:  our lead producer, Liam, do you wanna come answer this question? I'd like

293
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:18,165
Speaker 2:  you to answer this question.

294
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:22,245
Speaker 7:  The answer is that we use megaphone

295
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:26,365
Speaker 7:  product owned by Spotify. I think a vast majority of

296
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:30,205
Speaker 7:  large publishers use them because it allows us to manage

297
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:34,325
Speaker 7:  our advertising inventory effectively. Unfortunately

298
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:38,325
Speaker 7:  it does not support chapters is crazy and

299
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:42,085
Speaker 7:  something we've talked to them about many times and we are promised that

300
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:46,165
Speaker 7:  it is coming soon. But thus far we have not gotten that feature.

301
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:49,805
Speaker 2:  That answer is both true and complete and fills me with rage.

302
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:55,725
Speaker 2:  Surprising that Spotify is not a terrific place to listen to podcasts. Who

303
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,485
Speaker 2:  would've thunk? Yeah, that. I just wanted to get that outta the way. It is

304
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:02,405
Speaker 2:  real. We would like to do it. Chapters are great. They're so

305
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:06,165
Speaker 2:  good and I wish we had them and someday we will. And that will be, that will

306
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:09,005
Speaker 2:  be a great day. Alright, let's move on to the next one. We have a question

307
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:12,525
Speaker 2:  from Dennis. Dennis's question is, ever since the last redesign of The Vergecast,

308
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:15,125
Speaker 2:  I was wondering if you could tell us more about the new jingle. I really

309
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,925
Speaker 2:  dig it and maybe you could give some insights into the process of creating

310
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:21,525
Speaker 2:  this. Also, if you could publish a full version somewhere, I could really

311
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:25,165
Speaker 2:  see myself listening to it on its own. Mila, you really led this. You wanna

312
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:25,845
Speaker 2:  talk about the jingle?

313
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:30,125
Speaker 4:  So we were just rethinking how everything looked and we'd been using the

314
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,925
Speaker 4:  same theme, which I believe Josh Polsky just like made on his computer in

315
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:37,685
Speaker 4:  2011. And it's great. We love it that I I, we should

316
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:41,805
Speaker 4:  use it again. Classic Vergecast theme. One thing about things people like

317
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:44,005
Speaker 4:  is if you take 'em away for a while and you bring 'em back, people get really

318
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:46,925
Speaker 4:  excited. So I'm always thinking about that with our logos, with our themes,

319
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:50,685
Speaker 4:  all that stuff. Yep. But you gotta refresh and update. And we were launching

320
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:54,325
Speaker 4:  the second episode and sometimes the stuff you make just isn't, can't get

321
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:57,445
Speaker 4:  big enough. Like we didn't have enough stems. We didn't have enough like

322
00:17:57,475 --> 00:18:01,165
Speaker 4:  bits and bobs to extend the show the way we needed to. So we went out to

323
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:04,965
Speaker 4:  Breakmaster Cylinder who also did the decoder theme. And it was amazingly

324
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:08,765
Speaker 4:  fun working with them. And we, the only note I will give is we did a bunch

325
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:12,605
Speaker 4:  of rounds. We, it's built on the old theme so you can hear it's the same

326
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:16,605
Speaker 4:  pieces of music. And I just kept giving notes that I wanted it to

327
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:20,125
Speaker 4:  sound more like fascination Street by the Cure. And at some point Breakmaster

328
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:22,725
Speaker 4:  Cylinder was like, oh I get it, you want a rock song? And I keep making hip

329
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:26,565
Speaker 4:  hop songs and that was the, like the Heavens Burst

330
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:30,405
Speaker 4:  open. And then we had the theme. But the real piece of it, the real

331
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:33,725
Speaker 4:  important part of it was we needed something that was much more flexible

332
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,725
Speaker 4:  so we can make all the new kinds of shows that we were setting out

333
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:38,005
Speaker 4:  to make.

334
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:42,485
Speaker 2:  So speaking of that particular reboot, another question we got

335
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:46,445
Speaker 2:  was from Rafael and essentially says, I love the new

336
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:49,685
Speaker 2:  art formats and especially sound design. The podcast got, it's easy to relate

337
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:51,725
Speaker 2:  it to David's comeback, but I think it would be interesting to hear from

338
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:54,845
Speaker 2:  you how that went. If you have any other plans coming and your thoughts and

339
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:57,925
Speaker 2:  feelings in general, which is a very vague question, but I think generally

340
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:01,725
Speaker 2:  it's like we're we some point decided like we're gonna reboot The

341
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,845
Speaker 2:  Vergecast a bit and the the sort of impetus for that happened before I got

342
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:08,805
Speaker 2:  here. So like rewind, I don't know, 18 months we'd

343
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:12,085
Speaker 2:  been doing the show for 11 years at the time.

344
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:16,205
Speaker 2:  What was the conversation like that it was like, let's change what this thing

345
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:16,685
Speaker 2:  is a bit.

346
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:20,525
Speaker 4:  Well there are two things. One Dieter had just left. So

347
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:24,325
Speaker 4:  there was a big conversation about like how will we do this?

348
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:28,805
Speaker 4:  Will Neli just rant about USPC for one hour a week? Will that, is that an

349
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:31,165
Speaker 4:  acceptable show? Will that make us any money? Is that a good use of time?

350
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:35,485
Speaker 4:  The answer is no. I think very obviously. No. And so when I went to see if

351
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:38,805
Speaker 4:  David wanted to come back to The Verge, the thing I said was host The. Vergecast

352
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:42,765
Speaker 4:  like it is a big property. People care about it a

353
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,605
Speaker 4:  lot. It needs a lot of focused attention from someone who gets it.

354
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:50,805
Speaker 4:  And David was like, yes. And then five minutes later he showed up. So that

355
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:53,765
Speaker 4:  was like a big part of it was like if you're gonna change the host, you're

356
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:57,005
Speaker 4:  gonna change the show. The other part of it, which is the business part of

357
00:19:57,005 --> 00:20:00,685
Speaker 4:  it is that the show is successful. And so our company

358
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:04,645
Speaker 4:  wants more of it all the time. Just an infinite amount of

359
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:08,765
Speaker 4:  Vergecast and You know the, the dynamic there. The tension there is, I don't,

360
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:11,205
Speaker 4:  I don't think everybody like, I don't think the audience wants an infinite

361
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:13,885
Speaker 4:  amount of Vergecast. So it has to be really good and we have to like put

362
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:17,405
Speaker 4:  a boundary on how much we're gonna do. 'cause there's You know our effort

363
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:21,325
Speaker 4:  has to be sustained. So I think that's, that's it. Like I think

364
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:24,085
Speaker 4:  we're at a moment where we have the Friday show, which is like loose and

365
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:27,205
Speaker 4:  I think David once called them like the DVD liner notes of The Verge. Yeah.

366
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:31,645
Speaker 4:  And it's like really good. And then we have the Wednesday show, which

367
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:35,165
Speaker 4:  is much more focused and and narrative. And I think that is a really good

368
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:39,045
Speaker 4:  dynamic between those two episodes. I can see a world in

369
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:42,085
Speaker 4:  which we do something every day. I just dunno how to do it.

370
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,685
Speaker 2:  Like literally logistically.

371
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:48,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's like the, the bits and bobs of like who will go

372
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:51,245
Speaker 4:  where when we used to do it, we used to do 90 seconds on The Verge, I remember

373
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:55,125
Speaker 4:  this. That required us all to be very young and

374
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,605
Speaker 4:  mostly unmarried and have no children.

375
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:02,765
Speaker 4:  And hammered like also it required like an infinite amount of booze to pull

376
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:06,205
Speaker 4:  that off all the time. And some very dedicated people who are like fully

377
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:10,125
Speaker 4:  in startup mode if we wanna do that again. And I, I, I suspect we

378
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,765
Speaker 4:  should. I think we just have to build some systems. And I don't know that

379
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:17,605
Speaker 4:  that should be The Vergecast, but I that's like, I'm, I'm saying all this

380
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:21,045
Speaker 4:  stuff but I think we've all talked about it loosely. This is as specific

381
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:24,205
Speaker 4:  as we have ever been about this idea. Like where could we go?

382
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:28,365
Speaker 2:  Alex, you kind of came into The Vergecast in the middle of that

383
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,645
Speaker 2:  transition, right? What was that like?

384
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:35,005
Speaker 6:  It was kind of exciting and also alarming and terrifying

385
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:39,085
Speaker 6:  mainly to like come in with Neli and Dieter who are really, really,

386
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:42,925
Speaker 6:  really good at this. And I think like 90% of my early episodes I

387
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:46,885
Speaker 6:  don't say anything 'cause I'm just watching them and like studying

388
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:47,925
Speaker 6:  them the whole time.

389
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:51,805
Speaker 4:  No, no one understands that this is a test. It's like you have to talk and

390
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:53,165
Speaker 4:  if you don't talk and then it's not gonna

391
00:21:53,165 --> 00:21:55,685
Speaker 6:  Work. And then it'd be like, oh God, I gotta talk, I gotta say something.

392
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:58,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And so like trying to figure that out, trying to figure out like what

393
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:01,525
Speaker 6:  are the things I want to talk about on the show and, and make kind of part

394
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:04,765
Speaker 6:  of my character on the show. It was a lot of work and it was a lot of like

395
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:07,925
Speaker 6:  thinking about it and and talking with Dieter about it and and figuring it

396
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:11,765
Speaker 6:  all out. And then David came and was like, David, hello guide me. And

397
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:12,205
Speaker 6:  it was great.

398
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,405
Speaker 2:  Then I screwed everything up for you again. Yeah,

399
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:16,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You ruined everything. So thanks a lot.

400
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:20,245
Speaker 2:  I think the way you describe it, at least from my perspective, Neli, I was

401
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:23,245
Speaker 2:  pretty much about right. It was like, we want more Vergecast, come do it.

402
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:27,165
Speaker 2:  And I got a text from Dieter on my first day who was like,

403
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,445
Speaker 2:  You know good luck if you ruin The Vergecast, I'll kill you. Like in in

404
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:35,165
Speaker 2:  those words, in that order is what he said. And I sincerely hope I have not

405
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:38,525
Speaker 2:  ruined The Vergecast. I'm trying very hard to ruin it every single day. But

406
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,045
Speaker 2:  I don't think we've gotten quite there yet.

407
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:43,445
Speaker 4:  Success is right on the edge of ruining it. Oh yeah. That's the thing about

408
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,445
Speaker 4:  the show that no one quite understands. Agreed.

409
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:49,125
Speaker 2:  Alright, we have one more about The Vergecast and then

410
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:53,285
Speaker 2:  we're gonna take a break. This is from Ben and it's my favorite voicemail

411
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:54,205
Speaker 2:  we've gotten recently.

412
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:59,805
Speaker 8:  Hey, this is Ben. Oh really a question. Just wanna let Neli

413
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:03,605
Speaker 8:  know that pop up the volume is currently streaming on Max.

414
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:05,965
Speaker 8:  Alright. Have a nice day.

415
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:07,605
Speaker 2:  That's all you need to know about the first cast.

416
00:23:07,675 --> 00:23:11,365
Speaker 4:  It's very, it's very important information. So I think that we should do

417
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:14,605
Speaker 4:  a, like a watch party of this movie. The problem is that the movie

418
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:19,285
Speaker 4:  was made a while ago. There are, there are topless people

419
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:23,125
Speaker 4:  in it. There are some ideas in it that maybe don't hold up.

420
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:26,365
Speaker 4:  I would love to do this watch party. I just think we all have to sign contracts

421
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,005
Speaker 4:  agreeing that we know what we're getting into together before we begin.

422
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:34,045
Speaker 4:  But I'm promise you the scene and pump up the volume where

423
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:37,885
Speaker 4:  Christian Slater is driving around in his girlfriend's Jeep broadcasting

459
00:25:56,375 --> 00:26:00,335
Speaker 2:  like The Verge in general and Neli I think in particular. A

460
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:03,935
Speaker 2:  bunch of these are more for you as You know the boss,

461
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,335
Speaker 2:  but we got a bunch of good ones. So let's just dive in. First one is from

462
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:08,335
Speaker 2:  John Paul.

463
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:12,655
Speaker 10:  Hi, this is John Paul and I have a couple of questions for the meta episode

464
00:26:12,675 --> 00:26:16,655
Speaker 10:  you guys have said is coming up. First question, can you tell me how The

465
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:20,455
Speaker 10:  Verge is structured for someone who likes org chart so much? What, what's

466
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:24,335
Speaker 10:  the org chart look like and why did you set it up that way? Also, what's

467
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:28,015
Speaker 10:  The Verge relationship with Vox? How is it structured within the larger

468
00:26:28,015 --> 00:26:31,975
Speaker 10:  organization? Also, similar question. You are on a pretty big

469
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:35,535
Speaker 10:  newsroom and you make lots of decisions. Can you tell me how you make decisions?

470
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:38,455
Speaker 10:  What's your decision making framework? These questions might sound a little

471
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:40,615
Speaker 10:  familiar. Looking forward to hearing your answers. Bye.

472
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:45,005
Speaker 2:  I wish you all could see the smile on Mila's face right now. This is gonna

473
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,765
Speaker 2:  be the longest Vergecast of all time.

474
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:50,485
Speaker 4:  Your children have grown up to hoist you on the, on your own guitar. That

475
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:53,685
Speaker 4:  is the phrase. It's like, oh no, I did it to myself. Let's

476
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:57,125
Speaker 2:  Just do it in order. So the the first question is, how is The Verge structured?

477
00:26:57,355 --> 00:27:00,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think The Verge is structured, it's like a high performance

478
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:04,045
Speaker 4:  Montessori. Like my goal for The Verge is everyone just does whatever they

479
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:07,485
Speaker 4:  want and it's awesome. So we are structured to enable that

480
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:11,765
Speaker 4:  and that's like a very top blind thing. But basically we have desks,

481
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:15,885
Speaker 4:  right? We have a reviews desk, we have a policy desk, we have a creator's

482
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:19,205
Speaker 4:  desk that ladders into like just very top

483
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:23,325
Speaker 4:  line subjects like Jake Kakis is our tech editor.

484
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:27,205
Speaker 4:  It's basically by, by subject matter expertise is how we are structured.

485
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:30,165
Speaker 4:  And you can look at our mass set, you can see how that goes. Then next to

486
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:34,005
Speaker 4:  that we have audio and video, which is a format. So then we have

487
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:37,845
Speaker 4:  like a format specific division basically. And that's because

488
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:41,925
Speaker 4:  the tools and the processes and the cadences of that work

489
00:27:41,985 --> 00:27:45,765
Speaker 4:  are different than the newsroom in text. Those are the two sort of

490
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:49,965
Speaker 4:  axes that I think about is our features program runs on like

491
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:53,645
Speaker 4:  a year long cadence. And so they're thinking on very different timelines

492
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:57,485
Speaker 4:  than our news team. And so in the formats we have to manage

493
00:27:57,485 --> 00:28:00,245
Speaker 4:  different cadences and then we need to make sure that we have subject matter

494
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:04,205
Speaker 4:  expertise through all of that. And that is like you might

495
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:07,805
Speaker 4:  surmise that I enjoy messing with our org chart because those things are

496
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:11,325
Speaker 4:  intention. So you're, I like we are just always kind of like rebalancing

497
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:15,205
Speaker 4:  how that works and thinking about it. But those are the two things just

498
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:19,085
Speaker 4:  operationally that we have to manage. Like how long it takes to make something

499
00:28:19,585 --> 00:28:22,805
Speaker 4:  and then how much you need to know to make the thing and like where that

500
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:25,645
Speaker 4:  knowledge get concentrated and then how those timelines should be managed.

501
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:29,125
Speaker 2:  Alex, you're the person who spends all of your days like making all of that

502
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:29,325
Speaker 2:  work.

503
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah, Alex is the actual managing editor. Yeah,

504
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:35,485
Speaker 6:  I was like, I was like, I've memorized the org chart, I can list every single

505
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:39,365
Speaker 6:  person and who they report to at at The Verge. I don't know

506
00:28:39,365 --> 00:28:42,645
Speaker 6:  if I should have that information in my head, but there it is.

507
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:46,725
Speaker 2:  Does that structure make sense to you? Like is you, you're sort of operating

508
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,205
Speaker 2:  that structure day to day. Does that, does his description feel right to

509
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:49,925
Speaker 2:  you? Yeah, yeah

510
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:53,805
Speaker 6:  It does. I think like having different mediums is really,

511
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:57,725
Speaker 6:  they, they function totally differently, right? Like, like how the ideation

512
00:28:57,725 --> 00:29:01,285
Speaker 6:  works, how the timeline to getti things up works is totally, totally different.

513
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:04,405
Speaker 6:  So you kind of need a little bit of separation there, but then you also have

514
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:07,925
Speaker 6:  to make sure they overlap enough and they communicate enough that like good

515
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:11,685
Speaker 6:  conversations are happening and you don't have like somebody writing

516
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:15,405
Speaker 6:  a story and somebody doing a podcast that they are the exact same thing,

517
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:18,045
Speaker 6:  doing 'em in parallel without talking to each other. And so

518
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:20,285
Speaker 4:  This is especially hard remote. Yeah, I would say.

519
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:24,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So it's like constant, constant communication. But yeah, I think,

520
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:27,565
Speaker 6:  I think it makes sense and it's helpful to like, like I have like the big,

521
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:31,285
Speaker 6:  like the deputy editors and I go talk to the deputy editors and figure things

522
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:34,525
Speaker 6:  out. But then I also know, okay, I can drill down, I can go to

523
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:38,405
Speaker 6:  down to a desk editor, I can go down to, to a staff writer that reports up

524
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:41,445
Speaker 6:  to them and and get those details. And so it kinda like trickles down like

525
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:44,325
Speaker 6:  that. And It works really well. Yeah, I

526
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:47,565
Speaker 4:  Think my goal is that again, everyone just does whatever they want. There's

527
00:29:47,565 --> 00:29:50,485
Speaker 4:  a moment about a year into a new Verge

528
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:55,125
Speaker 4:  reporter's tenure where like they learn how to play the piano and

529
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:58,005
Speaker 4:  they're like, I can just do anything. And that's like, that's all that structure

530
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,685
Speaker 4:  is designed for that, for that moment to happen. 'cause that's the best.

531
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:04,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. And I think the, the like eternal struggle of the Virgin in

532
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:07,685
Speaker 2:  every organization is how to like that overlap. You're talking about Alex

533
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:11,565
Speaker 2:  where it's like how do we, how do we do really great stuff at

534
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:14,885
Speaker 2:  like the speed of the news business and also how do we, like when do you

535
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:17,565
Speaker 2:  take the moment where it's like, okay, I'm gonna go disappear for six months

536
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:21,485
Speaker 2:  and do this story even though there's constant news all the time. And

537
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:25,405
Speaker 2:  Nila, your immediate instinct is always just like news run faster, run faster,

538
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:28,085
Speaker 2:  run faster in so many ways. And it's really good in some ways. But it's also

539
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:31,245
Speaker 2:  like as The Verge has gotten bigger, figuring out how to do that and do all

540
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:34,045
Speaker 2:  the other stuff we have to do at the different speeds at which they happen

541
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:37,925
Speaker 2:  is like every newsroom's kind of constant struggle. 'cause like

542
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:38,885
Speaker 2:  things keep happening.

543
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:39,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And,

544
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:44,205
Speaker 2:  And you, you can be reactive to it forever and that works and you have to

545
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:47,765
Speaker 2:  do that. But also there's other stuff we wanna do that isn't just run as

546
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:49,125
Speaker 2:  fast as the news cycle all the time.

547
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,405
Speaker 4:  Well, I'll give you one very specific example that I think for chess

548
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:57,165
Speaker 4:  listeners will deeply understand news and reviews operate on

549
00:30:57,165 --> 00:31:00,925
Speaker 4:  different timelines like they just do to review a product. Well you have

550
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,605
Speaker 4:  to just fall into it. Like you have to pay attention to it for a significant

551
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:07,805
Speaker 4:  period of time and then you can like put out a good product review that takes

552
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:11,725
Speaker 4:  longer than writing the news. However, we have competitors that have

553
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:15,605
Speaker 4:  solved this problem by totally divorcing their news and reviews operations.

554
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:19,685
Speaker 4:  The reviewers never write news. The news reporters never write reviews. And,

555
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:23,565
Speaker 4:  what you get is a bunch of reporters who have

556
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:26,925
Speaker 4:  never used the products, who just don't understand the products and a bunch

557
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:30,765
Speaker 4:  of reviewers who have, who are writing reviews as though the news

558
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:34,285
Speaker 4:  is not happening. And like we talk about this, we've talked about this since

559
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:37,685
Speaker 4:  the beginning of The Verge. Like we see these other places that do this.

560
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:40,765
Speaker 4:  We don't ever wanna do that. The problem is that as you get bigger and you

561
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,925
Speaker 4:  wanna review more things and write more news, there's a reason that they

562
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:47,325
Speaker 4:  split those things up. Like there's a totally rational,

563
00:31:47,515 --> 00:31:51,285
Speaker 4:  explainable, deeply understandable reason why you would pull those teams

564
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,205
Speaker 4:  apart because they, they need to run in different directions and different

565
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:58,045
Speaker 4:  timelines. We're just insistent about smashing them together so

566
00:31:58,045 --> 00:32:01,765
Speaker 4:  that our reviews read as though they take place on the same

567
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:05,085
Speaker 4:  planet except everyone lives on. Yeah. And our news reporters

568
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:09,045
Speaker 4:  understand that you can't just assume that tech companies can

569
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:11,965
Speaker 4:  make every decision perfectly because they're actually using the products

570
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:14,725
Speaker 4:  and they're aware of the trade-offs that are inherent to like building any

571
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:18,685
Speaker 4:  product. And that I think is, that's what we do here. But

572
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:21,125
Speaker 4:  it after a while you're like, oh, this is the problem that I've signed up

573
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,725
Speaker 4:  to manage forever. Like the job is actually just this problem. Yeah, yeah.

574
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:27,485
Speaker 2:  That's fair. And I think you, you've kind of halfway answered this already,

575
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,965
Speaker 2:  but John-Paul did ask about how you make decisions, which is the decoder

576
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:33,645
Speaker 2:  question. So answer the damn decoder question Neli.

577
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:37,045
Speaker 4:  So if you listen to decoder and you listen to people and ask this question,

578
00:32:37,115 --> 00:32:40,885
Speaker 4:  some people are not prepared for it, which is very funny. Like just immediately

579
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:43,325
Speaker 4:  the funniest thing to me, like how do you not know this is coming? And then

580
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:46,645
Speaker 4:  there's like four or five variations and I am very much on the Amazon end

581
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,965
Speaker 4:  of that variation, which is you just need to divide up your decisions

582
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:53,925
Speaker 4:  into things that you can quickly undo and have low stakes and things that

583
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:57,605
Speaker 4:  have high stakes. And you need to make the low stakes decisions as fast as

584
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:59,805
Speaker 4:  you can and be ultra decisive about them.

585
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:03,125
Speaker 2:  That's the one-way door and two-way door strategy. Right? That's that's how

586
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:03,845
Speaker 2:  they talk about it. Yeah.

587
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:06,805
Speaker 4:  Or it's a type A and type B decision or type one and type two. And I always

588
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:09,485
Speaker 4:  forget which one's which. But yeah, there's the two-way door. You can just,

589
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:12,125
Speaker 4:  you can just go back and do it again. And then there's the like, oh this

590
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:16,045
Speaker 4:  is an existential important and So I try really hard to

591
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:19,485
Speaker 4:  make is to everyone's chagrin. I'm like, we should just do this all the time.

592
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:22,885
Speaker 4:  But I think that's really important for a newsroom. I think the challenge

593
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:26,485
Speaker 4:  is for a newsroom, a thing like a headline or an image choice or like, those

594
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:30,045
Speaker 4:  are actually one-way doors. You don't get to go back like your credibility's

595
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:33,445
Speaker 4:  on the line. So you have to build a set of instincts about that stuff that

596
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:37,365
Speaker 4:  I think is just hard fought and you need a lot of scar tissue.

597
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:41,565
Speaker 4:  But we are very blessed to have a large group of people that has honestly

598
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:45,005
Speaker 4:  worked together for a very long time comparatively to any

599
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:49,205
Speaker 4:  media organization and So I think there's, there's sort of a collective intelligence

600
00:33:49,205 --> 00:33:52,325
Speaker 4:  about what The Verge is that allows us to make those decisions very quickly.

601
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:55,565
Speaker 2:  Do you wanna say anything about the Verges relationship with Vox before we

602
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:57,205
Speaker 2:  skip onto our next person? We're a

603
00:33:57,205 --> 00:34:00,245
Speaker 4:  Pirate ship. I, I dunno what they do. Here we go.

604
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:04,605
Speaker 4:  It's a very honest, and our CEO has said this, like, for us, our audience

605
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:08,405
Speaker 4:  moves faster. It's a tech audience. It moves faster than a general news audience

606
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:12,245
Speaker 4:  or whatever. Our audience is younger than everybody else. This is a true

607
00:34:12,245 --> 00:34:15,445
Speaker 4:  thing. I think the only, only polygon singer to us, we have been given the

608
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:18,605
Speaker 4:  opportunity to, to run as fast as we want in, in the directions that we wanna

609
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:20,405
Speaker 4:  run it. And that's honestly great.

610
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:23,885
Speaker 2:  And speaking of one of those changes, here's our next voicemail from Austin.

611
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:28,365
Speaker 11:  Hey Bridge cast. This is Austin from Seattle. I got a question,

612
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:32,725
Speaker 11:  what has the emotional journey been like while y'all transition to

613
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:35,165
Speaker 11:  WordPress? Thanks. Hope to hear from you.

614
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:38,845
Speaker 2:  This is why I love Vergecast people, right? Like they understand that this

615
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:42,725
Speaker 2:  is an emotional journey and it has been one, how,

616
00:34:42,745 --> 00:34:45,325
Speaker 2:  how do you guys feel about it? This hasn't happened yet. It's still very

617
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:49,245
Speaker 2:  new, but we know it's happening. Y'all have been on chorus a lot longer

618
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:50,325
Speaker 2:  than I have. How are you feeling?

619
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:53,085
Speaker 4:  I feel joy. I feel nothing but joy.

620
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:57,525
Speaker 6:  A hundred percent. Yeah. Like Chorus is exceptional,

621
00:34:57,775 --> 00:35:01,725
Speaker 6:  right? It's it's an exceptional CMS I've used a lot

622
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:05,445
Speaker 6:  of CMSs. There was one where you couldn't use that I used where you couldn't

623
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:09,485
Speaker 6:  use the same image twice like ever. You would have to like ever.

624
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:13,805
Speaker 6:  So you'd have to like upload it flipped or like slightly

625
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:18,005
Speaker 6:  cropped. It was so dumb. That was horrible. And, and, and Chorus

626
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:21,885
Speaker 6:  has been really, really great. But I'm excited for WordPress. Like

627
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:25,485
Speaker 6:  that's where I first started. That was like my very first website that I

628
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:29,285
Speaker 6:  went and put on the web and and blogged on was a WordPress site. Yeah. And,

629
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:30,645
Speaker 6:  and I'm excited to go back there

630
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:34,325
Speaker 4:  To be clear it's joy because like we haven't yet gone on the first date.

631
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:35,885
Speaker 4:  We're just looking forward to it. You know.

632
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:39,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's like the anticipation we're like, ooh, yeah, what's

633
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:42,925
Speaker 4:  Gonna happen? But like fundamentally a lot of ideas that we have

634
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:46,725
Speaker 4:  are bottlenecked by the limitations of having to build our own

635
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:50,205
Speaker 4:  proprietary software. So there's a lot of things I wanna do. For example,

636
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:53,405
Speaker 4:  clicking more stories at the bottom of our homepage that should just infinite

637
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:56,925
Speaker 4:  scroll, right? It should obviously just infinite scroll. We either

638
00:35:57,435 --> 00:36:01,125
Speaker 4:  have to re-architect our own CMS and its API

639
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:04,965
Speaker 4:  to enable that. Or a million people have solved this problem or a press already.

640
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:08,525
Speaker 4:  And So I. I'm just excited about that. I'm excited about being able to trade

641
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:12,325
Speaker 4:  on a ecosystem like a huge software development ecosystem

642
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:16,525
Speaker 4:  and instead point our development resources at user

643
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:20,405
Speaker 4:  experiences. 'cause ultimately the media stopped trying to

644
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:23,605
Speaker 4:  compete with platforms and user experience. And I think that's take a look

645
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:27,525
Speaker 4:  around and we, we should try. So like that's, that's where the joy comes

646
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:31,005
Speaker 4:  from is, oh, why is our development effort pointed at a database and a word

647
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:31,845
Speaker 4:  processor like

648
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:33,725
Speaker 2:  Solve the problem's worth solving.

649
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,645
Speaker 4:  We should build user experiences. Yeah.

650
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:38,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I agree. I think everyone I've talked to is like deeply nervous because

651
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:42,565
Speaker 2:  we're a bunch of nerds who are like extremely attuned to the user experience

652
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:45,925
Speaker 2:  of the products that we use. And like we just got an email that we're about

653
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:48,405
Speaker 2:  to switch to the new slack and everyone is terrified. And so there's like

654
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:52,205
Speaker 2:  a lot of that energy in the WordPress transition too, that it's like we're

655
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:56,085
Speaker 2:  all sort of used to the good and bad things about Chorus, which is

656
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:58,845
Speaker 2:  a very good piece of software. We've been on it for a very long time. Like

657
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:01,805
Speaker 2:  the it's the devil You know and the devil you don't, right? But I, I do think

658
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:06,125
Speaker 2:  being open to like the entirety of the WordPress ecosystem is going to be

659
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,405
Speaker 2:  super, super cool and there's all kinds of stuff we can do.

660
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:11,045
Speaker 4:  And then we haven't even talked about Activity Pub yet, like,

661
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:14,085
Speaker 2:  Oh, we're getting to that. Yeah. Don't you worry. The last question is just

662
00:37:14,085 --> 00:37:17,325
Speaker 2:  four hours of Neli ranting about Activity Pub. So don't worry. Alright, let's

663
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,605
Speaker 2:  get to our next one, which comes from Charlotte.

664
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,485
Speaker 12:  Hi, my name is Charlotte. You guys talk a lot about other

665
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:26,765
Speaker 12:  journalists and other publications such as TechCrunch

666
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:31,365
Speaker 12:  and it seems like people move from The Verge to TechCrunch, et cetera,

667
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:35,445
Speaker 12:  all over. What's it like being friends with

668
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:39,245
Speaker 12:  your competitors and how do you kind of balance that work and

669
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:42,605
Speaker 12:  having to compete with them and also still being friends and collaborating.

670
00:37:43,025 --> 00:37:43,965
Speaker 12:  Thanks, bye.

671
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:47,365
Speaker 6:  They're our enemy. We don't collaborate.

672
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, David's moved around the most. Yeah, so you should answer this one.

673
00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:55,205
Speaker 2:  I think it's hard to explain, but really easy in

674
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:59,285
Speaker 2:  practice. Like I, I both love a lot of the people who work at a lot

675
00:37:59,285 --> 00:38:02,605
Speaker 2:  of other publications and absolutely earnestly want to kick their ass to

676
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:06,285
Speaker 2:  every story all the time. And I understand that there is like

677
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:10,005
Speaker 2:  cognitive dissonance there, but it's just true. And I think part of it is

678
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:13,685
Speaker 2:  also like this part of journalism is

679
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:16,925
Speaker 2:  relatively small. Like even the way that we think about tech,

680
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:20,325
Speaker 2:  everybody covers tech now. It's all over the place. It's huge in a way that

681
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:23,965
Speaker 2:  like in 2011 it was not right. Like it, the, the world of people who cared

682
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:27,445
Speaker 2:  about tech the way that we do is much smaller then it's still pretty small

683
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:30,765
Speaker 2:  now. Like there are a lot of people who cover these companies as big businesses.

684
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:34,525
Speaker 2:  There are a lot of people who cover them from like varying different

685
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,285
Speaker 2:  perspectives. But in this space of like people who cover

686
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:41,925
Speaker 2:  technology as technology, it's very small and having like

687
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:45,805
Speaker 2:  a bunch of other nerds around to talk about this stuff with is just

688
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,805
Speaker 2:  always fun. And there's so much to do in this space that I feel

689
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:52,925
Speaker 2:  like I, I probably feel less competitive than I should sometimes.

690
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:57,485
Speaker 2:  But at the same time, like we, we just see each other all the time in a way

691
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:01,365
Speaker 2:  that you don't in a lot of businesses, right? Like yeah, when companies do

692
00:39:01,725 --> 00:39:05,645
Speaker 2:  investor events, they don't have like hundreds of reporters that they

693
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:09,485
Speaker 2:  make stand in a room for hours drinking coffee before they go

694
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:13,525
Speaker 2:  see the, like quarterly earnings be unveiled. But we do that, we see all

695
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:16,245
Speaker 2:  these people at Apple events, we see them all at, at Google events. We see

696
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:19,365
Speaker 2:  them a bunch of times a year and we're just all talking about the same stuff

697
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:23,205
Speaker 2:  every day. So it's like natural. I think that you build a real like

698
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:26,525
Speaker 2:  kinship with these people and there's only like six publications. So we've

699
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:28,285
Speaker 2:  all worked together at one point or another. Yeah. We've,

700
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:31,805
Speaker 4:  We've killed most of the others. I want to be clear, we are soaked in blood,

701
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:36,045
Speaker 4:  we are smiling and blood drips down our fangs.

702
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:40,925
Speaker 4:  It wasn't us though, it was the, the larger, but it is true that our early

703
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:44,765
Speaker 4:  competitive set has been winnowed way, way, way down.

704
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:48,645
Speaker 4:  And that You know that I don't, I don't love that. I actually, we talk a

705
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:52,765
Speaker 4:  lot about needing great competitors because that, that's what keeps us

706
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:55,685
Speaker 4:  sharp and respecting your great competitors and being friendly with them

707
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:59,485
Speaker 4:  does not negate the fact that you feel competitive with them. Like in,

708
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:03,045
Speaker 4:  in like big ways. I would say this, like the power of The Verge over the

709
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:06,765
Speaker 4:  past decade has been, it's graduating classes. Like

710
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:10,885
Speaker 4:  we've graduated a lot of people out into a lot of publications,

711
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:14,925
Speaker 4:  most notably Bloomberg now. Like Bloomberg is just like Verge Midtown.

712
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:17,965
Speaker 4:  Like you just go, it's just a bunch of people we know. And so like that's

713
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:21,565
Speaker 4:  great. Like I, I like being the place where

714
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:25,605
Speaker 4:  people get good You know and like can go on and do other things. I like being

715
00:40:25,845 --> 00:40:29,565
Speaker 4:  the place where when our competitor publications look for leadership and

716
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:32,565
Speaker 4:  that's like the thing I like graduating at. I like graduating at senior people

717
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:35,925
Speaker 4:  and editors and leaders. I think that's just a good cycle. Like I I, the

718
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:38,245
Speaker 4:  earlier question where I was like, the main thing I think about is our culture.

719
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:41,845
Speaker 4:  Like that's what the culture develops and then all obviously all those people

720
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:45,765
Speaker 4:  are still very friendly with us, but we call 'em expats. Like they're still,

721
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:49,045
Speaker 4:  they're still The Verge. I, there's a lot of power in this world. I always

722
00:40:49,045 --> 00:40:52,085
Speaker 4:  joke with David that I have a theory of true power and it's like, by the

723
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:55,325
Speaker 4:  end of this we'll just run every publication. That's the goal.

724
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:58,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's a hundred percent it. Yeah. The, the The Verge diaspora is a

725
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:02,485
Speaker 2:  like extremely cool and increasingly powerful group of people.

726
00:41:02,555 --> 00:41:03,125
Speaker 2:  It's pretty awesome.

727
00:41:03,225 --> 00:41:05,965
Speaker 4:  The editor of Wired, by the way is a Verge expert. I just wanna put that

728
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:06,565
Speaker 4:  out there in the world.

729
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:08,205
Speaker 2:  We're taking over. It's what we do.

730
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,805
Speaker 4:  That's like a, and Katie's great and she, that has nothing to do with her

731
00:41:13,085 --> 00:41:16,965
Speaker 4:  Verge history. Like she's just great. If you had told us in 2011 that that

732
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:19,725
Speaker 4:  would be the direction I would've never believed you. Yeah.

733
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:23,645
Speaker 2:  Alright, next one. I, this is an email we got from Paul

734
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:27,085
Speaker 2:  that says, I think the casual reader at The Verge might assume the staff

735
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,885
Speaker 2:  are all very heavy tech users, constantly scrolling and getting notifications

736
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:32,925
Speaker 2:  from multitude of apps, upgrading the flip phones and MacBooks frequently.

737
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:36,805
Speaker 2:  But listening to the show, it seems like quite the opposite. Neli has mentioned

738
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:39,365
Speaker 2:  he blocks almost all notifications from his phone and that he removed apps

739
00:41:39,365 --> 00:41:42,485
Speaker 2:  with endless feeds. David mentioned before becoming a father that he wanted

740
00:41:42,485 --> 00:41:45,365
Speaker 2:  to avoid becoming a tech dad. I'm curious what views the rest of the team

741
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:47,925
Speaker 2:  has that may be counterintuitive for people who spend so much time thinking,

742
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:50,845
Speaker 2:  writing, and talking about tech. I guess what I'm asking is who is the biggest

743
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:54,645
Speaker 2:  Luddite at The? Verge, which a is a very good question and BI think the,

744
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:58,485
Speaker 2:  the sort of underlying question here is basically like, are you

745
00:41:58,485 --> 00:42:01,405
Speaker 2:  still a bunch of tech nerds who just love tech all the time? Wait,

746
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:04,925
Speaker 4:  Can I reject the premise of this question? Sure. Is that allowed? I mean,

747
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:07,765
Speaker 4:  I, I love you for listening and I love you for asking. I appreciate that

748
00:42:07,765 --> 00:42:11,045
Speaker 4:  you're asking. I I just don't think I agree with the premise that being a

749
00:42:11,045 --> 00:42:14,485
Speaker 4:  heavy user of tech requires you to have your notifications on.

750
00:42:15,475 --> 00:42:15,765
Speaker 4:  Okay.

751
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:16,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

752
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:20,285
Speaker 4:  Right. Like I, I think that this is actually a, a thing that gets conflated

753
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:24,205
Speaker 4:  like quite a bit. Like I am an intense user of technology. I will,

754
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:27,925
Speaker 4:  I spent my train ride to the office today reading about matter, adaptive

755
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:32,285
Speaker 4:  lighting upgrades, like that's where I'm at in life. You know what I

756
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:36,565
Speaker 4:  am selfish about And. what I'm not a heavy user of is like

757
00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:41,045
Speaker 4:  unfiltered garbage information and like mostly what, what people

758
00:42:41,045 --> 00:42:45,005
Speaker 4:  think of as tech products. Like just provide that to you like a, a nonstop

759
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:49,165
Speaker 4:  flood of garbage. And like, I would say that the the power

760
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:53,205
Speaker 4:  user move is to use the tools in the way that these companies do not want

761
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:56,965
Speaker 4:  you to use them and turn 'em all off and then only take what you want. And

762
00:42:56,965 --> 00:43:00,765
Speaker 4:  what I want is for home kid adaptive lighting to be compatible with

763
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:04,125
Speaker 4:  matter, which it is not at this time. You're

764
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,405
Speaker 2:  A simple man of simple needs.

765
00:43:06,515 --> 00:43:07,685
Speaker 6:  It's not, it's really brutal.

766
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,125
Speaker 4:  You can disagree with me. I think that's totally fair. But I I think there's

767
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,565
Speaker 4:  a, there's a thing in there, right? Which is like, are you a Luddite? 'cause

768
00:43:14,565 --> 00:43:17,725
Speaker 4:  you don't have all your notifications turned on. And it's like, no, I just,

769
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:21,125
Speaker 4:  I just don't need people to interrupt me. I'm busy You know, like I'll take

770
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:24,925
Speaker 4:  information on my terms, You know and I'm a in the news, so my terms are,

771
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:28,645
Speaker 4:  I want a lot of it. I just want to be focused. Most of these

772
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:32,085
Speaker 4:  platforms like Elon Musk is just like mask off with Twitter, right? He's

773
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:35,725
Speaker 4:  like, my focus is keeping you on the platform. I'm taking the headlines away.

774
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:39,605
Speaker 4:  And it's like, oh, I don't, I don't care about what you think. Like I'll,

775
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,405
Speaker 4:  I'm turning off your notifications. You can't have me. That to me

776
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:46,205
Speaker 4:  feels like more of a power user move. Like, maybe I'm wrong, maybe everyone's

777
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:48,565
Speaker 4:  gonna disagree with me, but that I would just, that's the turn I would make.

778
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:52,365
Speaker 6:  I think you're right. Like I think the power user move is to figure out which

779
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:55,565
Speaker 6:  bits you actually want to use and use them and incorporate them into your

780
00:43:55,565 --> 00:43:59,485
Speaker 6:  life in a really like satisfying way. And I would say the majority of

781
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:03,405
Speaker 6:  the staff does that. Like not everybody has the newest phone or, or

782
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:06,725
Speaker 6:  the newest laptop, but they have figured out a workflow that is

783
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:10,965
Speaker 6:  deeply profoundly nerdy and, and, and made

784
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:14,845
Speaker 6:  that work. And I think that's kinda like the core of The Verge is finding

785
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:18,365
Speaker 6:  those solutions that work for you. And it doesn't necessarily mean that you

786
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:22,325
Speaker 6:  have to have every single app constantly filtering things

787
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:26,325
Speaker 6:  in or you have to be like, like for the longest time I thought the real tech

788
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:29,525
Speaker 6:  nerd was the person who mastered rain meter on windows.

789
00:44:30,675 --> 00:44:34,405
Speaker 6:  Like that was it for me. And I think that is like, there's, there's definitely

790
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:38,165
Speaker 6:  tech nerdery to it, but it's not like the only part. And and,

791
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:41,285
Speaker 6:  and everybody's a different type of tech nerd. I know people who are super

792
00:44:41,355 --> 00:44:45,245
Speaker 6:  into phones and have no idea what matter, like how to use matter, what,

793
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:49,165
Speaker 6:  what the process there is. And I have friends who are super into their home

794
00:44:49,165 --> 00:44:53,045
Speaker 6:  theater systems to an alarming degree and they

795
00:44:53,045 --> 00:44:56,445
Speaker 6:  have like a six year old phone. Everybody's got a different kinda love of

796
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:56,725
Speaker 6:  tech.

797
00:44:57,005 --> 00:45:00,125
Speaker 2:  I do think there, there was a long period of tech where there were like a

798
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:03,965
Speaker 2:  small number of things to be really into. And so it was like, I mean you,

799
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:07,645
Speaker 2:  you rewind whatever 40 years and the only thing to be into was like PCs,

800
00:45:07,645 --> 00:45:10,765
Speaker 2:  right? So you were just like, and then, and then we got You know it expanded

801
00:45:10,885 --> 00:45:13,045
Speaker 2:  a little and then there were like phones and everybody's really into phones.

802
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:16,845
Speaker 2:  And now it's like, if you wanna be super weirdly into some

803
00:45:17,195 --> 00:45:20,925
Speaker 2:  line of tech, there are a billion to choose from. And I feel like what,

804
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:24,645
Speaker 2:  what's been fun about The Verge is watching everybody sort of pick their

805
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:28,125
Speaker 2:  thing, right? It's like, it's like being a, it's like being really into movies.

806
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:31,445
Speaker 2:  You end up sort of picking a thing that you care about more than everybody

807
00:45:31,445 --> 00:45:34,285
Speaker 2:  else and wanna talk to everybody else about, even though they don't care.

808
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:37,565
Speaker 2:  And like that's The Verge with tech. We all have things that no one else

809
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:40,405
Speaker 2:  caress about that we do. And that's the prerequisite of working here.

810
00:45:42,235 --> 00:45:44,525
Speaker 4:  Like I said, everyone's just doing whatever they want. Yeah, yeah. No, I

811
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:48,365
Speaker 4:  will talk your face off about building. I I need to build a new

812
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:50,045
Speaker 4:  home theater rig for the new house. Yeah.

813
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:53,285
Speaker 2:  Every time Neli brings up Dolby Atmos, that's when I just like, turn off

814
00:45:53,285 --> 00:45:55,245
Speaker 2:  my microphone and walk away for a few minutes of the podcast.

815
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:58,845
Speaker 4:  At this point Dolby's like, come to the office. Just come here. Just

816
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:03,085
Speaker 4:  by the way. But can I just answer that question Rick? It's Liz Lato. It's

817
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:04,045
Speaker 4:  the biggest sled I've ever

818
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:05,245
Speaker 6:  Oh, a hundred percent

819
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:08,205
Speaker 4:  Friend of The Verge, Brian Merchant who has written for us. We've exerted

820
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:11,045
Speaker 4:  his previous books. He's got a new book out, by the way, about the history

821
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:14,805
Speaker 4:  of Luddites And, what they were actually after. And it's like mind

822
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,245
Speaker 4:  blowing when the book comes out, we'll like have him on or something. It's

823
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:18,005
Speaker 4:  great. Alright,

824
00:46:18,145 --> 00:46:21,205
Speaker 2:  One more before we take a break. This is from Will Get Ready.

825
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:26,165
Speaker 13:  Hey, this is Will in San Diego. A two part question. Is

826
00:46:26,675 --> 00:46:30,165
Speaker 13:  Neli a cool boss and does he give

827
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:32,245
Speaker 13:  nice back rubs? All. right? Thank you.

828
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:36,405
Speaker 4:  Well, it's 2023 sir. No bosses should have given back rubs legally

829
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:38,405
Speaker 2:  We cannot answer that Second question.

830
00:46:39,665 --> 00:46:42,245
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm out here being like, I don't know if I can watch pump up the volume

831
00:46:42,245 --> 00:46:42,805
Speaker 4:  with these people.

832
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:47,485
Speaker 2:  I will say we got this question a lot, which makes me think we should like

833
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:48,685
Speaker 2:  actually try to answer it. The

834
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:49,165
Speaker 6:  Back rubs

835
00:46:49,365 --> 00:46:52,765
Speaker 2:  Question, not the back rubs question. Will's the only one who wondered about

836
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:55,405
Speaker 2:  the back rubs. Will, whatever that says about you, we'll, we'll come back

837
00:46:55,405 --> 00:46:59,125
Speaker 2:  to that. But the, is Neli a good boss question is when we actually got a

838
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:02,845
Speaker 2:  lot So Alex, I think we should attempt to answer this as earnestly and honestly

839
00:47:02,845 --> 00:47:03,885
Speaker 2:  as possible while

840
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:04,285
Speaker 4:  I'm here.

841
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:07,045
Speaker 2:  While Neli is here, we're gonna, this is,

842
00:47:07,555 --> 00:47:10,525
Speaker 4:  Well Neli is about to not be a very good boss. I'll tell you that one.

843
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,365
Speaker 6:  Neli is an exceptional boss.

844
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:15,645
Speaker 2:  I will say it. The question was not Is he a good boss? It's is he a cool

845
00:47:15,645 --> 00:47:19,085
Speaker 2:  boss? Subtly? Oh yeah. All, right? We did get good boss, but I like Cool

846
00:47:19,085 --> 00:47:20,165
Speaker 2:  boss as a question more.

847
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:24,445
Speaker 4:  No, I'm like cool boss. You should, you should just drink at home so you're

848
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:24,645
Speaker 4:  safe.

849
00:47:24,835 --> 00:47:28,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Neli and I have had like meetings about stuff while having a drink.

850
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:32,685
Speaker 6:  It's great. Like who doesn't love a drinking working meeting?

851
00:47:32,835 --> 00:47:35,725
Speaker 6:  It's wonderful. I think that's the definition of a cool boss.

852
00:47:36,115 --> 00:47:39,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's literally the definition of the cool mom from mean girls. I just

853
00:47:39,245 --> 00:47:39,565
Speaker 4:  wanna be

854
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,245
Speaker 6:  Clear that too, that too,

855
00:47:42,845 --> 00:47:46,605
Speaker 2:  I think the, the way I always describe Neli as a boss is that if you

856
00:47:47,315 --> 00:47:50,605
Speaker 2:  want to be as chaotic as Neli wants you to be,

857
00:47:51,185 --> 00:47:54,805
Speaker 2:  he is the best boss in the world. If, if Neli gets bored,

858
00:47:55,315 --> 00:47:56,645
Speaker 2:  it's a problem. So

859
00:47:56,995 --> 00:47:57,285
Speaker 4:  Then

860
00:47:57,285 --> 00:48:00,765
Speaker 2:  This is true in all things bored. Neli is a dangerous Neli. This is why we

861
00:48:00,765 --> 00:48:03,245
Speaker 2:  get worried when Neli iss like on a flight with no wifi. Like bad things

862
00:48:03,245 --> 00:48:06,605
Speaker 2:  happen when, when Neli has five hours to sit and think by himself.

863
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:07,845
Speaker 2:  The

864
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:09,925
Speaker 6:  Ideas are always great that come out of those flights.

865
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:13,125
Speaker 2:  There's always a Google doc. It's terrifying. But I think to me, one of the

866
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:16,885
Speaker 2:  things that is like fun about having you as my boss Neli, is that

867
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:20,045
Speaker 2:  you're like forever trying to do bigger,

868
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:24,445
Speaker 2:  weirder different things. Like I have worked at places that are very much

869
00:48:24,725 --> 00:48:27,845
Speaker 2:  like, here is what we do and our job is to keep doing it. And I understand

870
00:48:27,845 --> 00:48:30,765
Speaker 2:  why that's good and valuable and it has just like never been what like excites

871
00:48:30,765 --> 00:48:34,685
Speaker 2:  me day to day to just like keep doing my job every day. And I

872
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:37,045
Speaker 2:  feel like every three weeks Neli shows up and is like, what if we just did

873
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:39,605
Speaker 2:  everything super differently just to see what happens? And that's like, it

874
00:48:39,605 --> 00:48:42,765
Speaker 2:  is never boring with Neli is your boss, it's chaos.

875
00:48:42,835 --> 00:48:45,245
Speaker 4:  This is horrible. But it's, this is like having someone write your resume

876
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:48,765
Speaker 4:  in front of you. I I cannot tell you how much I dislike this

877
00:48:49,055 --> 00:48:50,645
Speaker 2:  Neela. Do you think you're a good boss? Cool

878
00:48:50,645 --> 00:48:51,605
Speaker 6:  Boss. Cool boss. Cool.

879
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:54,325
Speaker 4:  You are definitely, I'm definitely a cool boss. Yeah. Which means drunk.

880
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:58,285
Speaker 4:  I just wanna be clear, which means a lightly sauced. I've been watching a

881
00:48:58,285 --> 00:49:01,885
Speaker 4:  lot of Mad Men clips on TikTok. I've got a, I've picked up a bunch of ideas.

882
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:06,645
Speaker 4:  I don't know, I try really hard to be a good boss. I I, some days

883
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:10,565
Speaker 4:  I'm much worse than other days. The only thing that I

884
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:14,685
Speaker 4:  can measure that against is how confident our most junior

885
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,845
Speaker 4:  people are. Like, I don't worry about David. David's gonna tell me to fuck

886
00:49:17,845 --> 00:49:21,725
Speaker 4:  off. Like it's fine. And we have a lot of people on our staff who've been

887
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:25,165
Speaker 4:  with us for a long time who are very confident in telling me what to do and

888
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:28,805
Speaker 4:  that's great and I love them and cherish them. What I am always

889
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:32,725
Speaker 4:  thinking about is the youngest, most junior person on our staff and

890
00:49:32,745 --> 00:49:36,325
Speaker 4:  how far along they're on the road to playing the piano and being able to

891
00:49:36,325 --> 00:49:39,925
Speaker 4:  do whatever they want. And if they are unsure or they are

892
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:43,605
Speaker 4:  unclear or they are not confident, like we,

893
00:49:43,785 --> 00:49:46,605
Speaker 4:  the whole organization is fucked up, the culture's fucked up. I dunno if

894
00:49:46,605 --> 00:49:48,805
Speaker 4:  that's like the right measure. I don't know if I should measure like page

895
00:49:48,805 --> 00:49:52,165
Speaker 4:  views instead or like whatever. But that's, that's the thing I've been focused

896
00:49:52,185 --> 00:49:55,325
Speaker 4:  on and and the reason I'm always trying to blow everything up and I really

897
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:59,125
Speaker 4:  am always trying to blow everything up is like the media industry is a disaster

898
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,765
Speaker 4:  so we should probably try to invent a new one. Right? And and again, we've

899
00:50:02,765 --> 00:50:06,285
Speaker 4:  been given the license to go try to do it and along the way you've gotta,

900
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:09,165
Speaker 4:  you've gotta, I I just want the virtue to be a place where I would wanna

901
00:50:09,165 --> 00:50:12,485
Speaker 4:  work You know and like there's not a lot of places that like as evidence

902
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:15,365
Speaker 4:  by the fact that I've been here for a decade, not a lot of places I wanna

903
00:50:15,365 --> 00:50:17,685
Speaker 4:  work. That's it. That's what I dunno. I dunno if that's the right answer.

904
00:50:17,755 --> 00:50:21,045
Speaker 4:  This is horrible. I wanna die is really the answer. I'm like full body cringing.

905
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:24,325
Speaker 2:  Alright, we have a couple more quick ones. Let's take a break. We're gonna

906
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:26,005
Speaker 2:  do the last couple and then we'll get outta here. We'll

907
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:39,845
Speaker 15:  Good evening, I'm Noah Hassenfeld and there have been hundreds of reports

908
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:43,005
Speaker 15:  recently of orcas doing strange things to boats

909
00:50:43,225 --> 00:50:47,005
Speaker 16:  Around the world. Killer whales are attacking boats. We lost both

910
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:47,765
Speaker 16:  Rogers 30

911
00:50:48,055 --> 00:50:51,485
Speaker 17:  Orcas responded in moderating a killer Whale off twos

912
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:53,565
Speaker 17:  authorities are warning sailors to immediately,

913
00:50:57,865 --> 00:51:01,485
Speaker 15:  But the question is, is this a coordinated series of

914
00:51:01,485 --> 00:51:03,765
Speaker 15:  attacks or is it something else?

915
00:51:04,435 --> 00:51:08,405
Speaker 18:  They have these fads and rims and it's important for them

916
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:12,405
Speaker 18:  to be part of the group and to show that by yeah, we're all

917
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:16,125
Speaker 18:  doing this stupid thing together. All that is culture

Speaker 15:  This week. Un unexplainable. Do whales have culture

919
00:51:21,025 --> 00:51:24,965

940
00:52:38,705 --> 00:52:39,595
Speaker 2:  Neli. As a opposed

941
00:52:41,175 --> 00:52:44,315
Speaker 2:  no. Let's, we're we're gonna, we're gonna hard pivot away from that too.

942
00:52:44,735 --> 00:52:47,555
Speaker 2:  We have two, I think sort of bigger picture questions about how we think

943
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:51,395
Speaker 2:  about tech and The Verge and the future. So we're gonna do those before we

944
00:52:51,395 --> 00:52:53,395
Speaker 2:  get outta here. Here's the first one from Santiago.

945
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:57,595
Speaker 21:  Hey Verge team, this is Santiago from Orlando. I want to ask, how has

946
00:52:57,595 --> 00:53:01,315
Speaker 21:  your role in editorial stand shifted from the start of The Verge to today

947
00:53:01,775 --> 00:53:05,555
Speaker 21:  as we're more conscious of the possibility for technology misuse And how

948
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:08,595
Speaker 21:  have you seen your coverage on AI evolve as the product is more broadly

949
00:53:08,705 --> 00:53:12,395
Speaker 21:  used and becomes more integrated in everyday technology? Love the show.

950
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:13,315
Speaker 21:  Thanks for everything.

951
00:53:14,235 --> 00:53:17,155
Speaker 2:  I included this question because this is literally a conversation we have

952
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:20,595
Speaker 2:  been having internally about how we think about tech

953
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:24,555
Speaker 2:  now. Like I look back to 2011 and, and Neli, the thing you used to always

954
00:53:24,555 --> 00:53:27,925
Speaker 2:  say is one of the things we do at The Verge is we pedal hope that like the

955
00:53:27,925 --> 00:53:31,845
Speaker 2:  world can get better and technology is part of that. And that one

956
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:35,325
Speaker 2:  of the things we do is try to point people at what a better world looks like.

957
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:38,925
Speaker 2:  Does that hold 12 years later with everything we know about what

958
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:42,885
Speaker 2:  technology is and does and all the bad things we've seen in the last 12 years?

959
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:47,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think So I think we saw hope. Fundamentally we report on other people

960
00:53:47,445 --> 00:53:51,005
Speaker 4:  working really hard, right? I mean that's, the phone gets, well hopefully

961
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:52,925
Speaker 4:  the phone gets a little thicker than the battery. Life gets longer, but You

962
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:55,965
Speaker 4:  know the phone gets thinner, the screens get bigger, they get brighter, the

963
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:59,845
Speaker 4:  networks get faster. To what effect, who knows? But that dynamic right,

964
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:03,765
Speaker 4:  that I'm describing is a lot of people have to work really hard to put capabilities

965
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:07,565
Speaker 4:  into the world and to give you new tools. I think that is good. I i

966
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:11,565
Speaker 4:  like the most important thing is that is a positive feedback loop that

967
00:54:11,565 --> 00:54:15,485
Speaker 4:  like we invent things and we try hard and like there's a,

968
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,565
Speaker 4:  there's an earnestness to that that I never wanna lose sight of. The other

969
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:21,685
Speaker 4:  side of it is, well we made five G networks and we spent a lot of money and

970
00:54:21,785 --> 00:54:24,845
Speaker 4:  why did we do anything good with it? Has anything good happened? Is there

971
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:28,245
Speaker 4:  a robot surgery? And I think that is the side that the rest

972
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:32,565
Speaker 4:  of the media has focused on and obviously we've, we've layered a lot of

973
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:34,845
Speaker 4:  that into our coverage too, especially with social networks and things like

974
00:54:34,845 --> 00:54:38,805
Speaker 4:  that. It's weird that you that it is easier and faster to lie than

975
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:41,965
Speaker 4:  ever before. Should we have built those capabilities? Should we have stopped

976
00:54:41,965 --> 00:54:45,485
Speaker 4:  ourselves? May maybe. And those are societal questions. So I think in

977
00:54:45,485 --> 00:54:49,285
Speaker 4:  2011 that was our thesis, right? Like, oh the world because of phones

978
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:52,565
Speaker 4:  in particular, the world is on the cusp of a massive change and we should

979
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:55,925
Speaker 4:  have a publication that like technology is culture, tech, culture, that whole

980
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:59,805
Speaker 4:  thing. All that stuff we said over a decade ago is now everything

981
00:55:00,105 --> 00:55:03,925
Speaker 4:  it, everyone gets it. And so our differentiation I think is not

982
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:07,725
Speaker 4:  taking it for granted. The other line I always use is it's fun to be smart.

983
00:55:07,945 --> 00:55:11,205
Speaker 4:  You know, like we spend a lot of time just like thinking about stuff like

984
00:55:11,205 --> 00:55:15,165
Speaker 4:  our show our audience. That's why it's big 'cause there's actually way

985
00:55:15,165 --> 00:55:18,925
Speaker 4:  more people out there that wanna spend their time deeply thinking about

986
00:55:18,925 --> 00:55:22,845
Speaker 4:  these things than not You know. I would say that when I think about

987
00:55:22,845 --> 00:55:26,445
Speaker 4:  our differentiation in the media landscape, a lot of people take it for granted.

988
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:30,565
Speaker 4:  They just take it for granted that these are problems or these are trade-offs

989
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:33,645
Speaker 4:  or you can come to other solutions or even that it is fun to be smart about

990
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:37,605
Speaker 4:  them. That being a, it's like too nerdy or too weedsy and it's like, no

991
00:55:37,845 --> 00:55:41,805
Speaker 4:  actually you can walk up to any person on earth and ask them about their

992
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:45,605
Speaker 4:  phone and they will tell you something deeply nerdy. Like it is

993
00:55:45,765 --> 00:55:49,445
Speaker 4:  a, an absolute unifier that this technology exists and people have emotional

994
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:53,405
Speaker 4:  relationships with it and you can take it seriously. So I, I think

995
00:55:53,405 --> 00:55:56,565
Speaker 4:  it's You know many things have happened since we launched The Verge. Many

996
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:59,725
Speaker 4:  things continue to happen. AI is when I say it's easier to lie than ever

997
00:55:59,725 --> 00:56:03,245
Speaker 4:  before. Oh boy do I have thoughts? But the flip side of it is like, well

998
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:07,085
Speaker 4:  people, a lot of people have to work really, really hard to make

999
00:56:07,085 --> 00:56:10,925
Speaker 4:  these things and we should not take it for granted. And that like just

1000
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:14,685
Speaker 4:  in and of itself is like I to me is still a hopeful idea.

1001
00:56:15,195 --> 00:56:17,965
Speaker 2:  Alex, one of the things you and I talk about, I feel like half our Slack

1002
00:56:18,265 --> 00:56:21,845
Speaker 2:  dms are, we're covering this cool thing that exists and like AI is actually

1003
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,645
Speaker 2:  the perfect example of this right now. Now it's like this cool new thing

1004
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:28,125
Speaker 2:  that exists that You know OpenAI just launched Dolly three and look at all

1005
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:32,005
Speaker 2:  the wild stuff you can do. How many paragraphs do I have to

1006
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:35,405
Speaker 2:  write about all the awful things that can be used here? Does every story

1007
00:56:35,405 --> 00:56:39,245
Speaker 2:  about AI need to mostly be about the bad possibilities and the

1008
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:42,725
Speaker 2:  side effects and the, and the things we haven't had when we cover meta? Do

1009
00:56:42,725 --> 00:56:45,205
Speaker 2:  we need to re-litigate all the bad things that meta has done over the years?

1010
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:49,045
Speaker 2:  Like how do you talk about this stuff in a way that is both

1011
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:51,965
Speaker 2:  like hopeful and realistic and honest and

1012
00:56:52,415 --> 00:56:56,325
Speaker 2:  self-aware? Like do you feel like you and we have cracked that

1013
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:57,525
Speaker 2:  yet? I

1014
00:56:57,525 --> 00:57:00,645
Speaker 6:  Think it kind of hinges on the fact that one, we, we care about this stuff

1015
00:57:00,645 --> 00:57:03,925
Speaker 6:  and we're really passionate about it and and our readers are passionate about

1016
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:07,045
Speaker 6:  it. Our writers are passionate about it and, and we're, we're covering it

1017
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:10,805
Speaker 6:  every day. Like if you're only covering AI once a year, then

1018
00:57:10,945 --> 00:57:13,685
Speaker 6:  you really do have to re-litigate things because your audience may not be

1019
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:17,245
Speaker 6:  familiar with it, but our audience is typically pretty familiar with what's

1020
00:57:17,245 --> 00:57:21,165
Speaker 6:  going on. So we don't need to be like, oh remember that time? Like rehash

1021
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:24,325
Speaker 6:  everything that meta's done. That's awful. We all know they've done a lot

1022
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:27,845
Speaker 6:  of awful stuff. We can spend a line being like, Hey, by the way,

1023
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:32,205
Speaker 6:  meta did something awful once six years ago and continue on. Right? Like,

1024
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:36,205
Speaker 6:  like we could, we, we don't have to reeducate people. And I

1025
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:39,685
Speaker 6:  think that's something that a lot of publications like can kind of fall into

1026
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:43,245
Speaker 6:  the trap of of wanting to re-litigate things, wanting to

1027
00:57:43,825 --> 00:57:47,325
Speaker 6:  really focus on on the crummy stuff and the crummy stuff is crummy and we

1028
00:57:47,325 --> 00:57:50,205
Speaker 6:  need to talk about it, we need to write about it. But there's also really

1029
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:53,765
Speaker 6:  useful things and beneficial things and I think what we see with AI is kind

1030
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:57,525
Speaker 6:  of similar to what we saw with deep fakes where there was a lot of panic

1031
00:57:57,525 --> 00:58:00,605
Speaker 6:  around deep fakes because oh my God, it's gonna change everything. And yeah,

1032
00:58:00,605 --> 00:58:04,045
Speaker 6:  it does change things and it does demand better literacy from from

1033
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:07,965
Speaker 6:  audiences but at the same time it does a lot of really cool stuff. It

1034
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:11,525
Speaker 6:  enables a lot of really fun stuff. And as long as you find that balance and

1035
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:15,565
Speaker 6:  remember that and, and it doesn't go into like supervi land

1036
00:58:16,155 --> 00:58:20,045
Speaker 6:  then then it's fine. AI's a little trickier 'cause it is so

1037
00:58:20,045 --> 00:58:23,725
Speaker 6:  easy to lie with ai. But it does a lot of really cool stuff.

1038
00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:27,565
Speaker 6:  Like one day I'm not gonna have to schedule all my meetings. AI will do it

1039
00:58:27,565 --> 00:58:29,245
Speaker 6:  for me and I cannot wait.

1040
00:58:29,435 --> 00:58:32,005
Speaker 2:  Neil, I will never have to use software again because of AI

1041
00:58:32,965 --> 00:58:36,885
Speaker 4:  Software is the worst hardware only. That's the new Verge.

1042
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:37,645
Speaker 4:  No software

1043
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:40,925
Speaker 2:  Coverage. No, I think that's right. And I think like to the point about You

1044
00:58:40,925 --> 00:58:44,245
Speaker 2:  know it's fun to be smart is like being alive right now means holding a lot

1045
00:58:44,245 --> 00:58:47,405
Speaker 2:  of competing ideas in your head about what's good and what's bad and what's

1046
00:58:47,405 --> 00:58:49,845
Speaker 2:  safe and what's problematic and how much you should care about your privacy

1047
00:58:50,105 --> 00:58:53,925
Speaker 2:  versus all the cool stuff that exists. Like the goal I think is just to engage

1048
00:58:53,945 --> 00:58:57,845
Speaker 2:  all of that as honestly as we can rather than like try

1049
00:58:57,845 --> 00:59:01,765
Speaker 2:  to pretend it's all one or all the other or just ignore it all and talk about

1050
00:59:01,765 --> 00:59:05,005
Speaker 2:  stock prices, right? There's the, that's one really easy shortcut to a lot

1051
00:59:05,005 --> 00:59:07,485
Speaker 2:  of this is when the stock goes up it's good and when the stock goes down

1052
00:59:07,485 --> 00:59:11,085
Speaker 2:  it's bad. And that's a really handy way to cover tech that I think just like

1053
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:14,965
Speaker 2:  ignores what it's like to be a person in the world. And I think just

1054
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:18,365
Speaker 2:  coming into everything, acknowledging that it's all kind of a mess is a thing

1055
00:59:18,365 --> 00:59:22,285
Speaker 2:  The Verge is really good at and makes it like it's,

1056
00:59:22,285 --> 00:59:25,245
Speaker 2:  it's why it's fun to be engaged with this stuff every day. 'cause it doesn't

1057
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:29,165
Speaker 2:  get less messy. It just gets messy in new ways, which is really fun.

1058
00:59:29,755 --> 00:59:33,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Can I tell you my favorite Walt Mossberg story? Not that I experienced,

1059
00:59:33,245 --> 00:59:36,005
Speaker 4:  I have favorite ones that I experienced, but just in the legend of Walt Mossberg,

1060
00:59:36,035 --> 00:59:39,845
Speaker 4:  there's a, I believe it's a wired profile of him just like moving

1061
00:59:39,845 --> 00:59:43,645
Speaker 4:  through CES and he had just written some like horrible review

1062
00:59:43,985 --> 00:59:47,845
Speaker 4:  of like a serious XM radio or something. And the CEO of the company

1063
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:51,365
Speaker 4:  stops and is like, you trashed my stock price, like on the floor of CSS and

1064
00:59:51,365 --> 00:59:53,645
Speaker 4:  on the floor of css. Walt Mossberg looks at him dead in the eye and says,

1065
00:59:53,685 --> 00:59:55,045
Speaker 4:  I don't give a fuck about your stock price.

1066
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:56,245
Speaker 2:  Hell yeah,

1067
00:59:56,685 --> 00:59:58,765
Speaker 4:  I just like have held this in my heart the entire time.

1068
00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:01,725
Speaker 2:  I like that a lot. All, right? We have one more and then we're gonna get

1069
01:00:01,725 --> 01:00:04,805
Speaker 2:  outta here. The last question we have comes from Kevin.

1070
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,845
Speaker 22:  Hey, this is Kevin Lagree from beautiful Winona, Minnesota and I've been

1071
01:00:09,845 --> 01:00:12,165
Speaker 22:  an active reader of The Verge since around

1072
01:00:12,645 --> 01:00:16,565
Speaker 22:  November 1st, 2011. You've been around for a long time doing great things.

1073
01:00:16,665 --> 01:00:19,725
Speaker 22:  And I guess my real big question for everybody on The Vergecast, when you're

1074
01:00:19,725 --> 01:00:23,085
Speaker 22:  talking about Hot Takes and hot questions is what is your next,

1075
01:00:23,595 --> 01:00:24,565
Speaker 4:  Well, I'm here to announce,

1076
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:26,605
Speaker 2:  This is where he rans bad activity pub.

1077
01:00:27,065 --> 01:00:29,925
Speaker 4:  Is this where I ran about activity pub for four hours? Yeah, yeah. Okay.

1078
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:33,805
Speaker 4:  My, my plan for our site is to federate our content

1079
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:38,405
Speaker 4:  and to be more natively integrated with whatever new

1080
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:41,405
Speaker 4:  class of social networks that exist. I have no idea how any of this is gonna

1081
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:45,245
Speaker 4:  work. You can see the loose beginnings of how it might work on our

1082
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:49,085
Speaker 4:  site. You can see that people have built hacks to make it happen. I

1083
01:00:49,085 --> 01:00:52,885
Speaker 4:  love it. The space is great. Don't bother that guy too much. Don't overload

1084
01:00:52,885 --> 01:00:56,485
Speaker 4:  his server. But you can see how we're building towards, and then you can

1085
01:00:56,545 --> 01:01:00,405
Speaker 4:  see things like, well we've got a one column story stream. What if we

1086
01:01:00,405 --> 01:01:04,045
Speaker 4:  had two of them? What if we had three of them? What if you could follow our

1087
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:07,365
Speaker 4:  writers in the column or topics? What if, what if you could just follow gadgets

1088
01:01:07,365 --> 01:01:10,205
Speaker 4:  and get a stream of gadget news on our homepage? I dunno if any of that's

1089
01:01:10,205 --> 01:01:13,925
Speaker 4:  gonna work. I just think we have to build cooler user

1090
01:01:13,925 --> 01:01:17,885
Speaker 4:  experiences for people in media and not just be a

1091
01:01:18,085 --> 01:01:22,045
Speaker 4:  supplier of cheap undifferentiated content to Elon Musk. Maybe

1092
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,605
Speaker 4:  this is not like the most insane business proposition in the world, by the

1093
01:01:24,605 --> 01:01:26,725
Speaker 4:  way. If you like go anywhere else, you're like, what should you do? Should

1094
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:29,645
Speaker 4:  you have a relationship with your customer or should you give your shit away

1095
01:01:29,785 --> 01:01:33,765
Speaker 4:  for free to the richest man on earth like anyone else in the world who

1096
01:01:33,765 --> 01:01:36,325
Speaker 4:  knows the answer to that question. Media executives like, I don't know. I

1097
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:39,125
Speaker 4:  think we should give our shit away for free. And I just dunno why that is.

1098
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:43,565
Speaker 4:  Like our industry just like know has no self-esteem. So, I would like The

1099
01:01:43,685 --> 01:01:47,285
Speaker 4:  Verge to, to lead the way in having some confident ideas on like,

1100
01:01:47,465 --> 01:01:51,325
Speaker 4:  how do we build stuff that's cool? How do we compete in like software

1101
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:55,485
Speaker 4:  in addition to having really, really good work that is like has journalistic

1102
01:01:55,485 --> 01:01:59,005
Speaker 4:  ethics and all the other stuff. Yeah, that's, that's kind of my, my big idea.

1103
01:01:59,075 --> 01:02:02,645
Speaker 4:  I've, again, no idea how this will work. We have to build a lot of it.

1104
01:02:03,245 --> 01:02:06,245
Speaker 4:  We have to invent a bunch of it, but again, we've been given the license

1105
01:02:06,345 --> 01:02:09,845
Speaker 4:  to do it, which I think is a pretty incredible position to be in. Yeah,

1106
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:13,885
Speaker 2:  I think we, we've entered this place where like the media industry has spent

1107
01:02:13,905 --> 01:02:17,325
Speaker 2:  the last 15 years basically playing everybody else's game in the social world

1108
01:02:17,325 --> 01:02:20,445
Speaker 2:  where it's like you, you, you play somebody's game, you get free traffic,

1109
01:02:21,025 --> 01:02:24,925
Speaker 2:  you lightly monetize that traffic seems sort of like victory for

1110
01:02:24,925 --> 01:02:28,325
Speaker 2:  a minute. And we are coming out of that game in a pretty real way.

1111
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:32,525
Speaker 2:  Like just the fact that Twitter is now not showing headlines on link cards.

1112
01:02:32,525 --> 01:02:36,005
Speaker 2:  Like Elon Musk does not want you to leave his platform and so he's going

1113
01:02:36,005 --> 01:02:37,885
Speaker 2:  to make it very hard for you to leave his platform.

1114
01:02:38,105 --> 01:02:41,285
Speaker 4:  But, and Elon is just like a very convenient villain. This

1115
01:02:41,285 --> 01:02:43,765
Speaker 2:  Is what's happening to everybody, right? Like Google is less interested in

1116
01:02:43,765 --> 01:02:47,325
Speaker 2:  sending you stuff. Everybody is doing that now. And so this idea of like,

1117
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:50,725
Speaker 2:  I think the the thing you're gonna see from a lot of media organizations

1118
01:02:50,785 --> 01:02:54,365
Speaker 2:  is like, how do we build a place you want to be, which I think is, is correct.

1119
01:02:54,865 --> 01:02:58,085
Speaker 2:  And then the, the thing that we're also gonna try to figure out how to do

1120
01:02:58,085 --> 01:03:02,005
Speaker 2:  on top of that is how to like be out in the rest of the internet in

1121
01:03:02,005 --> 01:03:05,885
Speaker 2:  a way that makes sense and isn't just like a devil's bargain with Facebook,

1122
01:03:06,255 --> 01:03:08,445
Speaker 2:  which I think, I have no idea what it looks like, but I think it's gonna

1123
01:03:08,445 --> 01:03:08,845
Speaker 2:  be very cool.

1124
01:03:09,315 --> 01:03:11,485
Speaker 4:  I'll connect that You know. There's an earlier question about like how things

1125
01:03:11,485 --> 01:03:13,605
Speaker 4:  have changed since the beginning. And the beginning. We were just like pip

1126
01:03:13,685 --> 01:03:16,925
Speaker 4:  squeaks. Like I was at this last Apple event, I think I said this in the

1127
01:03:16,925 --> 01:03:20,365
Speaker 4:  show earlier, like, I was at this last Apple event and like the Cambrian

1128
01:03:20,365 --> 01:03:23,925
Speaker 4:  explosion of like TikTok rigs just like blew my mind.

1129
01:03:24,355 --> 01:03:28,085
Speaker 4:  Like people inventing things to make videos fast that we would've just never

1130
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:31,245
Speaker 4:  seen before. And the way that some of those folks were talking to me,

1131
01:03:32,195 --> 01:03:35,925
Speaker 4:  like, I love it when people call me the legacy media. Like, say it again,

1132
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:39,685
Speaker 4:  You know, like, I love it. Thank you for calling me the winner. I'll, I'll

1133
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:42,565
Speaker 4:  take it all day long. But the thing that has changed is like our role in

1134
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:46,165
Speaker 4:  the ecosystem has changed. And so we should build a product that is reflective

1135
01:03:46,165 --> 01:03:49,125
Speaker 4:  of that role in the ecosystem. A lot of which is like a linking to other

1136
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:53,005
Speaker 4:  people, right? Like our homepage is very much designed to link to

1137
01:03:53,005 --> 01:03:56,925
Speaker 4:  other great work to embed other great work on other platforms. I, I wanna

1138
01:03:56,925 --> 01:04:00,845
Speaker 4:  put some focus on that as much as like we're going to,

1139
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,365
Speaker 4:  I mean, we are always gonna make beautiful reviews and investigations and

1140
01:04:03,365 --> 01:04:07,085
Speaker 4:  write news fa like, but I think that piece of it where we're, we're a

1141
01:04:07,085 --> 01:04:10,445
Speaker 4:  utility and we're a trusted part of an ecosystem.

1142
01:04:11,195 --> 01:04:14,005
Speaker 4:  Most publishers have just gotten away. Like the New York Times won't even

1143
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:17,405
Speaker 4:  like link to other like, they're like, Ugh, another someone else read this.

1144
01:04:17,425 --> 01:04:21,325
Speaker 4:  Ugh, how dare you. And like we're, we're just

1145
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:23,845
Speaker 4:  not gonna be that. Right? We, we want to, we want to be the, the thing that

1146
01:04:23,845 --> 01:04:25,685
Speaker 4:  connects all kinds of smart people together.

1147
01:04:26,315 --> 01:04:30,245
Speaker 2:  Alex, any thoughts last, what's, what's on your mind for the next 12

1148
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:30,525
Speaker 2:  years?

1149
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,405
Speaker 6:  No, I I think you guys are exactly right. Like, like media's in a weird kind

1150
01:04:34,405 --> 01:04:37,925
Speaker 6:  of crisis point and finding a way to establish

1151
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:42,125
Speaker 6:  yourself and not have to like constantly go and, and pay

1152
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,925
Speaker 6:  homage to all of these big social media platforms is really, really important.

1153
01:04:45,305 --> 01:04:48,445
Speaker 6:  And it's the way you survive and it's the way you stay independent and it's

1154
01:04:48,445 --> 01:04:52,325
Speaker 6:  the way you actually cover what you wanna cover and not what some

1155
01:04:52,325 --> 01:04:55,845
Speaker 6:  algorithm you don't have any control over thinks needs to be covered.

1156
01:04:56,265 --> 01:04:59,085
Speaker 6:  And I think that's what we need to do at The Verge and that's what we do

1157
01:04:59,085 --> 01:05:02,925
Speaker 6:  at The Verge. So I'm really excited about it. It's a great, I like,

1158
01:05:02,925 --> 01:05:05,365
Speaker 6:  I'm excited about the next couple of years, even though I'm sure it's gonna

1159
01:05:05,605 --> 01:05:07,405
Speaker 6:  be kind of a hellscape for other people

1160
01:05:07,745 --> 01:05:11,685
Speaker 2:  12 years from now on your, on your brain machine implant that

1161
01:05:11,685 --> 01:05:15,645
Speaker 2:  is screwed into your head. We'll be there. I dunno what it's gonna

1162
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:16,165
Speaker 2:  look like. We'll be

1163
01:05:16,165 --> 01:05:16,845
Speaker 1:  There, but we'll be there.

1164
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,410
Speaker 6:  We'll be

1165
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:20,165
Speaker 2:  There. All, right? We gotta go. Thank you both for doing this. Thanks to

1167
01:05:22,645 --> 01:05:25,445
Speaker 2:  fun. I mean, there was one part of it that was horrible. The rest of it was

1168
01:05:25,445 --> 01:05:29,245
Speaker 2:  fun. Coming up next week, everybody's ratings on Neli as

01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:08,525
Speaker 2:  internet standards about how to post on the internet and much more. We'll

1180
01:06:08,525 --> 01:06:09,365
Speaker 2:  see you then rock and roll.

1181
01:06:20,995 --> 01:06:24,125
Speaker 23:  From the moment Twitter was founded, no one knew what it was supposed to

1182
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:26,925
Speaker 23:  be exactly, which was kind of great.

1183
01:06:27,355 --> 01:06:30,725
Speaker 24:  Some people would look at it and say, this is the future of communications.

1184
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:33,365
Speaker 24:  Others would look at it and say, this is the public square.

1185
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:36,525
Speaker 23:  Eventually it became not so great.

1186
01:06:36,995 --> 01:06:40,885
Speaker 25:  What we didn't foresee was that everybody having

1187
01:06:41,005 --> 01:06:44,525
Speaker 25:  a voice might produce a global

1188
01:06:45,445 --> 01:06:49,325
Speaker 25:  voracious mob, and there was only one place that that was happening.

1189
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,245
Speaker 25:  It was Twitter

1190
01:06:51,645 --> 01:06:55,205
Speaker 23:  A year ago in what was essentially the world's most expensive impulse

1191
01:06:55,525 --> 01:06:59,005
Speaker 23:  purchase. Elon Musk bought Twitter that made him

1192
01:06:59,005 --> 01:07:02,805
Speaker 23:  Twitter's most important user, but he's certainly not the only

1193
01:07:02,905 --> 01:07:06,885
Speaker 23:  one to fall for. Its spell. It's a spell. It promises attention, connection,

1194
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:07,605
Speaker 23:  and power.

1195
01:07:10,725 --> 01:07:14,285
Speaker 23:  I am Peter Kafka and I'm hosting Land of the Giants, the Twitter fantasy.
