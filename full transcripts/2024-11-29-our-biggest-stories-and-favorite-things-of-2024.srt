Description: 2024 is almost over, somehow. So we gathered a bunch of our Verge colleagues and told them each to tell us three things from the year: the biggest story, their favorite new tech thing, and their favorite new non-tech thing. We got a collection of big stories, cool gadgets, great movies, and more good stuff from the year that was.
We're also planning a special episode for Tuesday, December 10th, all about The Verge and The Vergecast. So if you have questions about how we work, what we cover, why we talk about copyright law so much, or what Nilay is actually like to work with every day, tell us! Call 866-VERGE11, or email vergecast@theverge.com, and we'll answer as many as we can on the 10th. Thanks in advance!

00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,515
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Cozy Games.

3
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:10,955
Speaker 1:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I just bought a bunch of pens. So we've

4
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:13,915
Speaker 1:  been talking a lot about notebooks and stuff on this show over the last few

5
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:16,315
Speaker 1:  weeks. We're actually gonna talk a little bit more about it on this show.

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,875
Speaker 1:  But a thing that I should admit that I don't talk about a lot here

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,795
Speaker 1:  on The Vergecast or in life is that on the side of

8
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:28,315
Speaker 1:  being like a digital note taking lunatic, I'm also

9
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:32,395
Speaker 1:  kind of a notebook lunatic. I go through these phases every

10
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:35,475
Speaker 1:  once in a while where I'm like, okay, I'm gonna become a notebook guy. I

11
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:38,875
Speaker 1:  spend too much time on my phone. My phone is really useful, but what I need

12
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:42,275
Speaker 1:  is just when I'm gonna write things down, I'm gonna do it on pen and paper.

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,195
Speaker 1:  It's gonna be great. Love it. I always forget that the real problem is that

14
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:49,955
Speaker 1:  my handwriting is awful and that my hand hurts when I write too much. So,

15
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:52,635
Speaker 1:  I just buy a bunch of notebooks. I'm like, this will fix it. So, I have like

16
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:56,595
Speaker 1:  old, like five starts school notebooks. I have,

17
00:00:56,915 --> 00:01:00,675
Speaker 1:  I have a bunch of like mole skin knockoffs. I have an actual

18
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:04,675
Speaker 1:  mole skin. I have this thing called the tote book from a company called Studio

19
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:08,755
Speaker 1:  Neat that I really like. I have one that I bought at Staples.

20
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:13,195
Speaker 1:  This one is my journal from high school in which I wrote

21
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:17,195
Speaker 1:  a bunch of poetry to my girlfriend that no one is ever allowed to read.

22
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:22,635
Speaker 1:  But the thing that I've realized most is that A, I need a notebook that is

23
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:25,195
Speaker 1:  with me most of the time. So what I usually end up doing is getting like

24
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:28,315
Speaker 1:  a little field notes thing that can just sort of live in my pocket. But the

25
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:31,835
Speaker 1:  main thing is I need pens, like a million pens and I don't wanna spend any

26
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:35,315
Speaker 1:  money on pens. So I'm gonna an Amazon and I bought these, they're called

27
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:39,275
Speaker 1:  the pilot Precise V five rt. I think I found them

28
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:42,115
Speaker 1:  from a Wirecutter review that was like, these are good pens that you don't

29
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:46,035
Speaker 1:  have to press super hard on. So. I bought 12 of them and my

30
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:49,875
Speaker 1:  plan is just to put them everywhere. Like one in the car, one in my backpack,

31
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:53,275
Speaker 1:  one at my desk, one upstairs, one next to the bed, and then the goal is just

32
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:57,115
Speaker 1:  to like always have a pen within reach. I try to carry

33
00:01:57,155 --> 00:02:00,235
Speaker 1:  a pen around, but I find I'm pretty good at having my notebook with me, but

34
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:03,835
Speaker 1:  terrible at having my pen with me. So I'm going with like an infinite pens

35
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:07,995
Speaker 1:  situation. It's gonna be great. And I'm going to write in notebooks more

36
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:11,875
Speaker 1:  often. Anyway, that is not what we're here to talk about today. It's

37
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:15,035
Speaker 1:  a holiday week, at least here in the US it's Thanksgiving. So instead of

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,955
Speaker 1:  normal newsy vergecast on a week where there's not really any news, we figured

39
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:22,115
Speaker 1:  we'd do something slightly different. So what we're gonna do today is we're

40
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:25,395
Speaker 1:  gonna talk to a bunch of different folks on our staff about some of the biggest

41
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,275
Speaker 1:  stories of the year, the most important things that they worked on,

42
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:32,955
Speaker 1:  the most important things that we covered, their favorite new thing that

43
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:35,555
Speaker 1:  happened this year that had nothing to do with any of the stuff that we covered.

44
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:39,555
Speaker 1:  It's just fun to talk to our staff and get to know them and what they're

45
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:43,075
Speaker 1:  into and what they're interested in. And we've done this before on the show

46
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:47,155
Speaker 1:  and I had a great time doing it and y'all seem to like it too. So we invited

47
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:50,555
Speaker 1:  a bunch of people back and talk to them about some of their favorite and

48
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:54,515
Speaker 1:  some of the biggest things from 2024. All that is coming up in just

49
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:58,235
Speaker 1:  a second. We got a bunch of people to get to lots of stuff. If you're

50
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:02,325
Speaker 1:  on like a long drive this weekend, lots of stuff for you to

51
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:05,645
Speaker 1:  listen to. Lots of fun verse to have to hang out with. All that's coming

52
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:09,445
Speaker 1:  up, But. first I really, I have to go distribute this mountain

53
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:12,645
Speaker 1:  of pens all over my house and then

54
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:16,725
Speaker 1:  systematically lose them one by one until I have to buy 12 more pens. This

55
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,245
Speaker 1:  is the first Vergecast, we'll be right back.

56
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,135
Speaker 1:  thoughts on what we should be doing but aren't. I wanna hear those too. Send

57
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:22,095
Speaker 1:  them all our way. You can either call the hotline eight six six VERGE one

58
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:25,695
Speaker 1:  one or email vergecast at The Verge dot com. It send us all your questions.

59
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:29,575
Speaker 1:  December 10th, we're gonna do that episode. It's gonna be really fun. Alright,

60
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:33,095
Speaker 1:  let's get into it. So we gave a bunch of folks on our staff,

61
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:37,615
Speaker 1:  very small bits of homework, basically come with what you

62
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:41,575
Speaker 1:  think is the Story of the year, your favorite tech thing of the year, and

63
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:45,175
Speaker 1:  your favorite new non-tech thing of the year. All these things are very broad

64
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:48,495
Speaker 1:  deliberately 'cause we figured people would interpret them differently and

65
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:52,215
Speaker 1:  come with different ideas about what makes for a Story of the year

66
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:55,655
Speaker 1:  and what constitutes new tech thing of the year.

67
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:59,845
Speaker 1:  Everybody came, came with delightfully different and interesting answers,

68
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:04,045
Speaker 1:  and I think we're gonna get a swath of basically all the things The

69
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:08,085
Speaker 1:  Verge cares about, kind of all in one place, plus just a sense

70
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:11,485
Speaker 1:  of some of our favorite new stuff. All right, we have eight people to go

71
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:15,445
Speaker 1:  through. Let's do this. First up, Jay Peters news editor on our

72
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,295
Speaker 1:  team, Jay Peters. Hello.

73
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,855
Speaker 4:  Hi, David. How are you?

74
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:23,375
Speaker 1:  I'm good. We are not going to talk about this for too long, but you're

75
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,335
Speaker 1:  here on Wired EarPods that you just bought, and this is

76
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:29,935
Speaker 1:  not going to factor into our discussion, but I just wanna say congratulations

77
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:33,455
Speaker 1:  on your wired EarPods. Thank you. The best headphones on earth for $20.

78
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:37,095
Speaker 4:  Yes, thank you. I am plugging them directly into my MacBook Air.

79
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:40,775
Speaker 4:  Someday I'll upgrade from my iPhone 12 mini, and guess what? They'll plug

80
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:43,775
Speaker 4:  straight into those two. It'll be fantastic. I can't wait,

81
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:48,175
Speaker 1:  Honestly, like all the cool kids wear wired headphones again, and I

82
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:52,055
Speaker 1:  get it. It's like I was on a train the other day and I accidentally

83
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:55,815
Speaker 1:  spent 20 minutes trying to connect my Mac to someone else's

84
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:59,295
Speaker 1:  Bose headphones instead of my Bose headphones. And I was like, oh, I have

85
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:03,015
Speaker 1:  the cable. And I plugged it in and it was fine. It's just this, it's life

86
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:06,095
Speaker 1:  is better this way. Yeah. All right. So we gave you some homework. Let's

87
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:08,215
Speaker 1:  start with Story of the year. What was your Story of the year?

88
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:12,175
Speaker 4:  The Story of the year to me. Is Google being ruled a

89
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:15,775
Speaker 4:  monopolist? Mm. I think this is huge

90
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:19,775
Speaker 4:  because depending on what happens as a result of that

91
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:23,255
Speaker 4:  ruling, including a potential breakup of the company,

92
00:07:23,255 --> 00:07:27,135
Speaker 4:  different pieces like it could fundamentally transform the way we use

93
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:28,695
Speaker 4:  the internet, how we search for things

94
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:34,215
Speaker 4:  and like what the defaults on our phones are. I think this could

95
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:38,095
Speaker 4:  be really, really, really massive in ways that we just don't even understand

96
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,575
Speaker 4:  yet because we don't know what the end result's gonna be.

97
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:45,055
Speaker 1:  I like this one. And I also feel like the fun thing about this story

98
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,685
Speaker 1:  is it, you might be correct this year

99
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:53,045
Speaker 1:  and next year and the year after that, and the year after that, and the year

100
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:56,405
Speaker 1:  after that. And then it might be nothing. Which is why this story is so much

101
00:07:56,405 --> 00:08:00,245
Speaker 1:  fun. Because it is, it is either, I think you're right, these

102
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,965
Speaker 1:  like single most consequential thing happening in tech or it is going to

103
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:07,805
Speaker 1:  be a awful lot of hand wringing and nonsense and lawyer fees and

104
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:09,205
Speaker 1:  ultimately amount to nothing.

105
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:10,125
Speaker 4:  Yep.

106
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:13,605
Speaker 1:  What If you? If, you were a betting man. Which one would you pick of those

107
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:14,125
Speaker 1:  two outcomes?

108
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:19,325
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna say a little bit closer to the big deal end versus

109
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:23,285
Speaker 4:  the nothing end. Okay. Because to me it seems like kind of

110
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:27,005
Speaker 4:  likely that the government's gonna say Google can't make the

111
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:30,965
Speaker 4:  default deals, especially like the one on the iPhone that has made it,

112
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:35,245
Speaker 4:  you know, the pervasive mobile search on iPhone. And so like, I think

113
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:37,565
Speaker 4:  that it's just gonna have an absolutely massive change down the line.

114
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:41,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I tend to agree, and I think I was reading something the other day

115
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:45,245
Speaker 1:  about the, all the ways in which this trial and the

116
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:49,165
Speaker 1:  Microsoft trial from 25 years ago are just scarily

117
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:52,245
Speaker 1:  similar in the way that they're going. Oh, interesting. Yeah. And, and that

118
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,855
Speaker 1:  one's a really fun case because what ultimately happened

119
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,615
Speaker 1:  was not that much, but while Microsoft was so focused on it, the internet

120
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:03,695
Speaker 1:  happened and this company called Google, like did a bunch of

121
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:07,095
Speaker 1:  smart things that Microsoft didn't have time or energy or attention to do.

122
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:10,215
Speaker 1:  And just the existence of that crazy thing

123
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:15,215
Speaker 1:  screwed up Microsoft and changed the internet.

124
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:18,655
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I think If you if, especially if you're a believer that AI is as

125
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:22,585
Speaker 1:  big a deal as people say, we're sitting in the middle of that again.

126
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:26,185
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It, it seems like the AI companies,

127
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:30,345
Speaker 4:  I don't see like a direct like, oh this is obviously the next Google type

128
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:33,505
Speaker 4:  thing, but like, it seems like there, there's something in that

129
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:37,665
Speaker 4:  everybody is starting to realize that maybe Google isn't the only option

130
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:41,945
Speaker 4:  and that could have very large ramifications in how we use

131
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:42,745
Speaker 4:  tech every single day.

132
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:46,265
Speaker 1:  I, I'm, I'm with you. Are you using any of the AI search engines by the way?

133
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:50,145
Speaker 4:  No, I so far have not been a huge fan of them,

134
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:55,465
Speaker 4:  but I think it's also time for me to explore them

135
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:56,065
Speaker 4:  a little bit more.

136
00:09:56,945 --> 00:10:00,865
Speaker 1:  I feel the same way. There's something in the muscle memory of it that

137
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:04,305
Speaker 1:  has just been much harder for me to change than I expected. And

138
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:07,425
Speaker 4:  That might just be because of my like day-to-day work of like

139
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:11,785
Speaker 4:  writing news as fast as possible all the time. Like yeah,

140
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,025
Speaker 1:  We like Google stuff for a living. Yeah. Like it's a real way.

141
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:18,905
Speaker 4:  I have like really specific ways that I find this information that I know

142
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:22,665
Speaker 4:  that it works 95% of the time that like other search

143
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:26,625
Speaker 4:  engines may not be strictly built for my use case, but that might also

144
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,625
Speaker 4:  not be true. Or there might be ways that I can use those things that I haven't

145
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,025
Speaker 4:  tried yet.

146
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,345
Speaker 1:  Yeah. All right. What's your New thing of the year? Presumably it's not a

147
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:34,905
Speaker 1:  search engine. What's your new thing

148
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:39,105
Speaker 4:  I would say? My favorite new thing is a game I played this year. It was

149
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,705
Speaker 4:  Final Fantasy seven Rebirth. I say this as a huge fan of the original

150
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:46,105
Speaker 4:  PlayStation game. I loved the remake and So I had the really high

151
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:49,745
Speaker 4:  expectations going into this one and it totally exceeded them. It's like

152
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:53,625
Speaker 4:  this just giant RPG, you're hanging out with your friends, these characters

153
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:57,305
Speaker 4:  that like, you know, I've followed and, you know, fallen in love with in

154
00:10:57,305 --> 00:11:00,505
Speaker 4:  various, you know, for various reasons playing the games forever.

155
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,705
Speaker 4:  And I thought Square Inc's just totally deliberate on this really incredible,

156
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:08,265
Speaker 4:  huge ambitious RPG. I also have a very special memory in that

157
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:12,185
Speaker 4:  I played so much of it in the middle of the night while my new child was

158
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,665
Speaker 4:  sleeping on me. So like I have this like kind of really cool attachment with

159
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:19,625
Speaker 4:  like what that game represented in addition to the time of my life

160
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,225
Speaker 4:  that I'm in right now.

161
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:24,745
Speaker 1:  The genre of video games you can play with a sleeping child on top of

162
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:27,065
Speaker 1:  you is a, is a special, special thing. Yeah.

163
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:27,625
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

164
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:31,225
Speaker 1:  Okay. I have never had the occasion to do this with somebody on this podcast,

165
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:35,225
Speaker 1:  and I'm gonna make you do this right now. Okay. I have never played one second

166
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:38,825
Speaker 1:  of Final Fantasy in my entire life. Okay. Not for any good reason. It's just

167
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:42,545
Speaker 1:  never happened. Yeah. So can you, can you give me like the,

168
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:46,505
Speaker 1:  the 62nd case for someone who has never played Final Fantasy to get

169
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:49,945
Speaker 1:  into specifically Final Fantasy? VII Rebirth?

170
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,605
Speaker 4:  Well, I wouldn't start with Rebirth Okay. Specifically 'cause it's part two

171
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:57,925
Speaker 4:  of a three part giant story. You should start with, oh,

172
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,485
Speaker 1:  See now I'm just tired already, Jay. I know, but you should, I know this

173
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:04,365
Speaker 4:  Is the problem with these games. I've already spent so much time in it that

174
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:06,645
Speaker 4:  I have to see it all the way through. All right, fair enough. If you're gonna

175
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:08,645
Speaker 4:  start, start with remake, which I think

176
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:13,925
Speaker 4:  it captures everything that people loved about the

177
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:17,885
Speaker 4:  original, on the original PlayStation brings it up to, what would you call,

178
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:20,845
Speaker 4:  you know, modern graphics and modern gay play standards. And

179
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:25,125
Speaker 4:  they, they clearly know the source material very well and they know that

180
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:29,005
Speaker 4:  people really, they really love it and they really treat it with

181
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:32,965
Speaker 4:  like care and, and expanding it in ways that are very interesting and

182
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:36,725
Speaker 4:  still feel very true to the source material, but also

183
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,125
Speaker 4:  have some kind of new interesting spins on the story that everybody's very

184
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:43,605
Speaker 4:  familiar with from your original game into this new stuff. So like, it's

185
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:47,405
Speaker 4:  long, you know, as a parent, I don't know, If, you're able to find 50 free

186
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:51,245
Speaker 4:  hours to dig into that, but like If, you really want something to like settle

187
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:55,205
Speaker 4:  into and, and just dig into. It's, it's awesome and it's really fun

188
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:55,925
Speaker 4:  to play too. Okay.

189
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,885
Speaker 1:  Is it the kind of game you can play in long stints

190
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,835
Speaker 1:  or short stints? Can you play 20 minutes of Final Fantasy at a

191
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:03,915
Speaker 1:  time?

192
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:08,315
Speaker 4:  Yes, I would. I would argue so if only because that's

193
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:12,075
Speaker 4:  a muscle I've had to develop since having a kid just in general is like understanding

194
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:15,795
Speaker 4:  that not every session is gonna be like two hours on the couch at the end

195
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,715
Speaker 4:  of a workday. It's like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there. And I think you

196
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,115
Speaker 4:  can do it in that there's always like either like little quests to be doing

197
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:26,195
Speaker 4:  or you can, you know, advance farther along along

198
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:30,355
Speaker 4:  whatever main story path that you're doing and you can play it on Steam deck,

199
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:34,195
Speaker 4:  which I dunno, If you have a steam deck, but I love my steam deck. It's fantastic

200
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:36,715
Speaker 4:  thing for If. you have a kid and you just need to play a game somewhere around

201
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,995
Speaker 4:  the house where you have time. I think you can do it.

202
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:43,195
Speaker 1:  All right. I love it. All right, last thing. Favorite non-text of the year?

203
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:47,515
Speaker 4:  Well, the Sentimental Choice is my new child, obviously, but if I, no, that

204
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:51,275
Speaker 4:  doesn't count. That's not true. If I have to pick, if I pick

205
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:55,155
Speaker 4:  something else, I got a pack of field

206
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:58,995
Speaker 4:  notes notebooks from attending the xo XO conference in the

207
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:02,835
Speaker 4:  final one in Portland this year. This is like a special brand that they made

208
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:07,075
Speaker 4:  just for the show. And normally I've not ever cared about Field

209
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:11,035
Speaker 4:  Notes, but I actually started like using them a bunch and I think

210
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:13,035
Speaker 4:  they're awesome. They're very pocketable.

211
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:18,275
Speaker 4:  I like the little grid on the ones that I got here. Just very nice for

212
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,965
Speaker 4:  sketching random stuff. And I find that, like, I'm finding that

213
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:25,365
Speaker 4:  writing to-do lists or, or outlining stories

214
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:29,365
Speaker 4:  just with pen and paper and no computer has been like a really

215
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:33,885
Speaker 4:  great thing for my brain to process stuff. And it's something

216
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,845
Speaker 4:  I've done just way more than I ever expected. Like I thought as

217
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,685
Speaker 4:  a new parent I'd be like, okay, super locked in all my tech stuff. I gotta

218
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:44,405
Speaker 4:  be super zeroed in on that. But sometimes just sketching in an notebook at

219
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:47,365
Speaker 4:  the end of the day has been a really, really good way to get a handle on

220
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:47,525
Speaker 4:  things.

221
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:51,925
Speaker 1:  I love that. I think field notes I have always struggled with because like

222
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:55,645
Speaker 1:  you said, they're the exact right size. Like as a, as notebooks

223
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:59,445
Speaker 1:  go, it is the thing I want, but I

224
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:02,285
Speaker 1:  have never figured out how to like, hold it in my hand

225
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,565
Speaker 1:  correctly to write in it. Let's

226
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:05,405
Speaker 4:  See. Because it's

227
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,085
Speaker 1:  Just, it's just not quite rigid enough. Yes. And and there's something I

228
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:12,645
Speaker 1:  I end up fascinating between these like giant super

229
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:17,045
Speaker 1:  sturdy notebooks that are like really easy to write on in any circumstance.

230
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:21,205
Speaker 1:  And these like teeny tiny ones that fit in my pocket. And I

231
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:23,685
Speaker 1:  love a field notes, they make great stuff. But there is, there is something

232
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:27,565
Speaker 1:  about it that is like, I just occasionally find it annoying to write in and

233
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:28,165
Speaker 1:  it drives me crazy.

234
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:32,325
Speaker 4:  What I think I found is I do like the, your hand is the, is

235
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:36,285
Speaker 4:  the back. Like it's the, the support for everything. But I'm also not

236
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,365
Speaker 4:  doing a ton of extensive journaling. It's like, oh, I'll dash

237
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:44,085
Speaker 4:  off a sentence here, or I'll write some bullets here. And that I think

238
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:48,525
Speaker 4:  makes it so, like, if I had to sit down and write, if I was sketching out

239
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:52,165
Speaker 4:  a novel on this, this would not be my favorite place to do it. Fair. But

240
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:55,405
Speaker 4:  for, for taking notes or thinking through ideas and, you know, I'll write

241
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:58,845
Speaker 4:  a sentence. I'll sit on something and think about it, write another sentence.

242
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:02,325
Speaker 4:  It's been really perfect for me. So I would recommend it for, for that. That's

243
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:03,325
Speaker 4:  really good use case.

244
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:06,725
Speaker 1:  I love that. Yeah. Field notes for the win. There's like an entire corner

245
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:09,205
Speaker 1:  of old head bloggers who just got very excited hearing you said

246
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:10,005
Speaker 4:  That, I'm sure. Yes.

247
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:12,565
Speaker 1:  So awesome Jay, thank you as always. Appreciate

248
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:13,165
Speaker 4:  It. Thanks David.

249
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:17,655
Speaker 1:  Okay, moving on. Next up, Jake Kastrenakes, the versus

250
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:20,155
Speaker 1:  executive editor. Jake. Hello.

251
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:21,475
Speaker 5:  Thanks for having me.

252
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:25,235
Speaker 1:  I, the sweater game with you is always very strong. Most people, it's all

253
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,315
Speaker 1:  moody. People will not be able to see this, but the, the sweater game is

254
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:28,675
Speaker 1:  very strong with Jake all the time.

255
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,315
Speaker 5:  Can I tell you, Thomas Ricker, when he came from the Netherlands, oh my

256
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:33,075
Speaker 1:  God. Spectacular.

257
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:35,555
Speaker 5:  That's the Europeans know what they're doing.

258
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:39,035
Speaker 1:  Thomas at one point was wearing a sweater that I thought was very good, and

259
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:41,635
Speaker 1:  then he put a scarf on over the sweater and I was like, God, it's even better.

260
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:45,195
Speaker 1:  And then he put a jacket on over the scarf in the sweater that was even better

261
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:47,235
Speaker 1:  and tie the whole thing. It was the most incredible thing I've ever experienced.

262
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,395
Speaker 5:  We're hopeless in comparison.

263
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:52,675
Speaker 1:  Truly, truly. All right, Jake, we gave you some homework. What's your Story

264
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:52,875
Speaker 1:  of the

265
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,595
Speaker 5:  Year? Okay. I hate to be that guy. I I really do.

266
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,575
Speaker 5:  I really do. But I have to tell you, it's ai.

267
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:01,335
Speaker 1:  Okay, listen. I

268
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,695
Speaker 5:  Mean Sure. Listen, it's okay. It's the obvious one. It's the obvious one.

269
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:07,695
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But look, we came from a year where AI is

270
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:08,095
Speaker 5:  the most

271
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,585
Speaker 5:  hopelessly overhyped technology

272
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:18,145
Speaker 5:  all year nonstop. And I hate to be the person, but I think AI

273
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:21,925
Speaker 5:  is actually good, not

274
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:25,685
Speaker 5:  necessarily for humanity. Okay. I, I don't wanna say that, but, but

275
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:30,125
Speaker 5:  just fundamentally on a product level, I can punch a button on my phone

276
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:34,205
Speaker 5:  and have a conversation with, I don't, I don't know

277
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:34,565
Speaker 5:  what it is.

278
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:35,805
Speaker 1:  It's, it's best not to think

279
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,525
Speaker 5:  About it. I can diagnose the problem with my air conditioning system,

280
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,805
Speaker 5:  right? Yeah. I I I don't know how to do that myself.

281
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:46,485
Speaker 1:  Can I, can I tell you my own story just from the other day? Yeah. So it's

282
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:49,765
Speaker 1:  open enrollment time at Vox Media. We're all doing our benefits. I

283
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:53,885
Speaker 1:  had to decide whether we wanted to do my health insurance that we get

284
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:58,285
Speaker 1:  or my wife's health insurance through her job. And I looked at the

285
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,245
Speaker 1:  summary of benefits document for like, I swear to God hours and

286
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:05,925
Speaker 1:  my eyes glaze over. I couldn't remember which was which the, the words.

287
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:10,165
Speaker 1:  I uploaded the two documents to Notebook lm and was

288
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:13,085
Speaker 1:  just like, which one's better given what I think is coming for the next year?

289
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:15,605
Speaker 1:  And laid out a couple of things and it told me the answer and it was correct.

290
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:18,565
Speaker 1:  It was the most incredible thing I've ever seen in a minute and a half. It

291
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,605
Speaker 1:  was just like, it was like, here's all the information you need about which

292
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:24,885
Speaker 1:  insurance to pick. And I was like, oh, I had the same thought you did. I

293
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:27,005
Speaker 1:  was like, oh, AI is good. Now I I take it back.

294
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:30,725
Speaker 5:  There's the thing e everybody has that moment eventually, and it's like,

295
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:35,235
Speaker 5:  I don't know that this is going to completely revolutionize the world, at

296
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:38,595
Speaker 5:  least as it is right now, but there are these small moments where it's like,

297
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:42,075
Speaker 5:  that just saved me 10 minutes of Googling. Right? It's not a hundred percent

298
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,875
Speaker 5:  correct, but like, it got me in the ballpark and, and yeah, that's actually

299
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,635
Speaker 5:  what I need right now.

300
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,715
Speaker 1:  I totally agree. I had somebody a while ago tell me that If, you just look

301
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:53,595
Speaker 1:  at AI as the world's most powerful summarization

302
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:57,275
Speaker 1:  machine that is both a much smaller vision

303
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,035
Speaker 1:  for it and also really cool and full of neat things that it can do. And I

304
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:03,435
Speaker 1:  like, I've been thinking about that ever since. And it's like that there

305
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,155
Speaker 1:  is a lot you can do there. And that's actually a thing it's good at.

306
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:10,315
Speaker 5:  I I think we have these maybe impossibly high standards for

307
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:14,275
Speaker 5:  AI and look like I, it's our job to hold these

308
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:17,035
Speaker 5:  companies to those high standards. That's fine. I'm going to keep demanding

309
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:20,915
Speaker 5:  that they make these things better. But If you told me, you know,

310
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:24,745
Speaker 5:  a year or two ago that I can on hand

311
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:28,625
Speaker 5:  have somebody who will, you know, gimme a ballpark correct answer

312
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:32,705
Speaker 5:  or do math for me or, or you know, write something

313
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:36,385
Speaker 5:  for me and it'll be like reasonably good. That would seem impossible.

314
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:40,745
Speaker 5:  And I think reasonably good is still pretty

315
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:44,545
Speaker 5:  impressive. Again, problems abound. I will be the first to

316
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:48,305
Speaker 5:  admit that, right? But these things exploded.

317
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:52,145
Speaker 5:  They are suddenly in everything. I do not know if people are

318
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,825
Speaker 5:  actually using them in most of these places, but I

319
00:19:56,255 --> 00:20:00,065
Speaker 5:  have a suspicion that a lot of these very minor small use

320
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,945
Speaker 5:  cases, just writing stuff better summarizing stuff is going to

321
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:06,145
Speaker 5:  become second nature for people very quickly.

322
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:10,545
Speaker 1:  Yeah, totally. And I think 2025 is, I hope the

323
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:13,985
Speaker 1:  year where the like high-minded rhetoric

324
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:18,705
Speaker 1:  gets a little closer to the actual reality. Like the tech

325
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:21,225
Speaker 1:  is gonna get a little better, but also everybody just needs to calm down

326
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:22,145
Speaker 1:  about it for a minute.

327
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:25,065
Speaker 5:  Everybody needs to calm down a bit and Nvidia is worth like

328
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:28,145
Speaker 5:  $500 trillion or something. I I don't,

329
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,945
Speaker 5:  don't quote me on that one Exactly. But

330
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:33,225
Speaker 1:  It's not investment advice. Some

331
00:20:33,255 --> 00:20:37,185
Speaker 5:  Something feels a little off there. Like it's cool technology, but like

332
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,305
Speaker 5:  yeah, people need to chill out a little bit.

333
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:43,505
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's not God just yet. Yeah. But maybe, you know, we'll do this

334
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:46,785
Speaker 1:  again in 12 months. Who knows? All right. What's your next one? Your your

335
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:47,965
Speaker 1:  favorite New thing of the year?

336
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:50,365
Speaker 5:  Favorite New thing of the year? I'm shooting a little bit 'cause this is

337
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:54,245
Speaker 5:  from end of last year. I bought it this year. But I wanna hype up

338
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:55,485
Speaker 5:  the Weam amp.

339
00:20:57,475 --> 00:21:01,285
Speaker 5:  This is If. you are a psycho like

340
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:04,925
Speaker 5:  me who has a bookshelf speaker

341
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:08,685
Speaker 5:  system, right? You don't have an all-in-one, right? No soundbar.

342
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:13,205
Speaker 5:  You didn't just buy some powered speakers. You have speakers that

343
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,925
Speaker 5:  need to be powered by an amp that need different input sources

344
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:20,885
Speaker 5:  fed into them. You've probably gone through the absolute

345
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:24,845
Speaker 5:  madness and chaos of having a bunch of different parts and pieces.

346
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:28,205
Speaker 5:  You need the amp, you need the streamer, you need the phono amp, you need

347
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,765
Speaker 5:  all these different things. The we Amp says, Hey,

348
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:36,655
Speaker 5:  I know it's all, it sounds better If. you get 500 different things

349
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:40,095
Speaker 5:  and, and come and and stack them all together. What if we just skip all that

350
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:44,615
Speaker 5:  isn't gonna, is it gonna put everything in one, $300? It

351
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:48,505
Speaker 5:  sounds reasonably good and it does all the things

352
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:52,585
Speaker 5:  that I I hate that all these fancy sound

353
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:56,345
Speaker 5:  system parts do not do. It automatically turns on and off.

354
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,065
Speaker 5:  It doesn't get flaming hot in my cabinet.

355
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:04,105
Speaker 5:  It streams things, it switches inputs automatically.

356
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,305
Speaker 5:  My TV can control it. It's great. I love it.

357
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:11,385
Speaker 1:  I cannot describe to you how convincing a pitch that just was.

358
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,505
Speaker 1:  I think about my parents all the time who bought this like as tall

359
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:20,185
Speaker 1:  as me set of speakers when I was a kid. Yeah. And they still

360
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:23,305
Speaker 1:  have it. And all the other parts of their system that they had the, you know,

361
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:26,865
Speaker 1:  the CD player and the FM radio, all that stuff is a million years old and

362
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:30,225
Speaker 1:  long dead. But the speakers still sound amazing and they have spent all this

363
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,385
Speaker 1:  time trying to figure out, the speakers are just sitting in the basement

364
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:36,065
Speaker 1:  and they're like, well, what do we do with these? Because again, like you

365
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:39,985
Speaker 1:  said, it's, do I rebuild a room full of stuff? I'm

366
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,505
Speaker 1:  gonna literally, I'm going to buy this for my parents for Christmas and it's

367
00:22:42,505 --> 00:22:43,225
Speaker 1:  going to blow their minds.

368
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:46,905
Speaker 5:  I'm telling you. It is, it is. As somebody who has done it over and over

369
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:50,705
Speaker 5:  again, it is not worth rebuilding. Like all these

370
00:22:50,985 --> 00:22:54,825
Speaker 5:  separate items and stringing 'em together. It is such a hassle. The

371
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:57,905
Speaker 5:  sound is not that much better. Don't come for me.

372
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:03,065
Speaker 5:  You know, just, just give into the simplicity. You know, your speakers are

373
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:06,825
Speaker 5:  still gonna sound great. And this has basically nearly everything

374
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:10,945
Speaker 5:  a sound system needs with the one exception of a a funnel input. It doesn't

375
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:14,745
Speaker 5:  have that, that's a bummer. So you do need a separate amp for that, but otherwise

376
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:17,345
Speaker 5:  it can stream Chromecast, it can stream airplay.

377
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:22,065
Speaker 5:  I don't know a can hook up to your tv. It's great.

378
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:26,025
Speaker 1:  I love it. All right. Well last thing. Favorite non-tech thing of the year?

379
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:30,465
Speaker 5:  Favorite non-tech thing of the year? This is a, again, not from

380
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:33,785
Speaker 5:  this year I'm cheating, but for me personally Yeah. New to you.

381
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:34,345
Speaker 1:  It counts.

382
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:38,145
Speaker 5:  This, this is a new to me thing. I found a card game

383
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:42,025
Speaker 5:  that has been a, a hit of all of the board game

384
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:45,845
Speaker 5:  nights I have been to. It is super simple. I think as I've gotten

385
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:49,565
Speaker 5:  older, I have strayed from the games where they take like two and a half

386
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:52,965
Speaker 5:  hours to play Yeah. And need to read an instruction manual for an hour beforehand.

387
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:57,485
Speaker 5:  The game is called Chronoloy. It is super simple. I love it. And basically

388
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:01,445
Speaker 5:  it's a deck of cards and each card has an event and a

389
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:05,165
Speaker 5:  year on it. And everybody starts out with one ear. Right.

390
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:09,845
Speaker 5:  And somebody's gonna read you another one. And so in front of you,

391
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,685
Speaker 5:  you might have something that says Apple Computers is

392
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,645
Speaker 5:  founded and it says 1976. That's what happened. Right. Okay. So

393
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:21,045
Speaker 5:  now's your turn David, and I'm gonna read you the next card. And it says,

394
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:25,605
Speaker 5:  LBJ becomes president after JFK's assassination.

395
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,285
Speaker 5:  And you have to say, did this happen before or after?

396
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:29,485
Speaker 1:  Before.

397
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:33,365
Speaker 5:  Before Easy. Okay. Not too bad. But now you've got two cards down, right?

398
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:37,445
Speaker 5:  You've got 1976. 1963 So I say The Beatles

399
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:41,365
Speaker 5:  appear on Ed Sullivan. What was that? Before, after, or in between?

400
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:45,485
Speaker 5:  Now it gets complicated. Ooh. Because you're like, Hmm. 60.

401
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:45,885
Speaker 5:  It

402
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:46,365
Speaker 1:  Was in between,

403
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:50,205
Speaker 5:  It was in between, it was 6 4, 12. Right. And it is fun. It's really, that

404
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:53,925
Speaker 5:  is very fun. It's really super easy to learn, super fast party game.

405
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:56,725
Speaker 5:  And it's fun because you get to, you know, rib your friends about not knowing

406
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:58,005
Speaker 5:  history. I don't know anything.

407
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:02,885
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I feel like I'd be, I'd be good until about the dates that you

408
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:06,085
Speaker 1:  said and then it would all fall apart for me. It's like the things where

409
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:09,405
Speaker 1:  people talk about something that happened in like the Roman Empire and I'm

410
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:13,005
Speaker 1:  like, oh, that was like the 1450s. Right? And they're like, that was 16

411
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,485
Speaker 1:  bc I'm always like, all right, cool.

412
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:19,605
Speaker 5:  The amount of time it took me to think on, I, I got

413
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:23,285
Speaker 5:  a Pompei card and I'm like, Jesus. I'm pretty sure that was,

414
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,805
Speaker 5:  that was far back. But I don't know

415
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:25,645
Speaker 1:  How there's a thousand years

416
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,325
Speaker 5:  I would say it was, it was pretty, yeah.

417
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. A lot of people made funny for that one. Turns out it was a really

418
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:33,085
Speaker 5:  long time ago. That

419
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:35,765
Speaker 1:  Should be enough. Like you should get a half point for just being like, it

420
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:37,565
Speaker 1:  was, it was before The Beatles. That's

421
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:40,005
Speaker 5:  All that's, I knew it was, I knew it was before you get the point. I knew

422
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,885
Speaker 5:  it was before The Beatles. That was all I needed to know.

423
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,125
Speaker 1:  That's pretty good. Game's called Chronoloy.

424
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:48,205
Speaker 5:  Chronoloy. All right. Highly recommended for Chill, fun

425
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:48,925
Speaker 5:  board game night.

426
00:25:49,325 --> 00:25:51,125
Speaker 1:  I like it. All right, Jake, thank you as always.

427
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:52,365
Speaker 5:  Cool. Talk to you later.

428
00:25:53,145 --> 00:25:56,675
Speaker 1:  Next up on the list, Justine Calma, our senior science reporter,

429
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,275
Speaker 1:  Justine. Hello.

430
00:25:58,845 --> 00:25:59,195
Speaker 6:  Hello.

431
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:03,635
Speaker 1:  Coming to us from the control room of one of our podcast studios.

432
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:08,115
Speaker 1:  Yes. I love this. All right, so we gave you some homework. The first thing

433
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:11,635
Speaker 1:  you had to do was come with your Story of the year. What was the Story of

434
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:11,795
Speaker 1:  the year?

435
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:16,115
Speaker 6:  Well, that for me was a no brainer. It was definitely the

436
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,515
Speaker 6:  US presidential election. Sure. Well, the outcome of the elections,

437
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:24,715
Speaker 6:  this is, you know, this is what I'm losing sleep over leading up

438
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:28,275
Speaker 6:  to next year. I mean, it just changes. It, it affects everything. Right.

439
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:32,795
Speaker 6:  For me on the science desk, I'm an environmental reporter and so there

440
00:26:32,795 --> 00:26:36,315
Speaker 6:  are literally studies out there around how much more

441
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:40,235
Speaker 6:  pollution we can expect with this next administration, how much more that's

442
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:44,085
Speaker 6:  gonna warm the planet. We cover a life in the future. And so, you know,

443
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:45,765
Speaker 6:  we're looking at a hotter future,

444
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:51,365
Speaker 6:  all kinds of fallout. And, you know, across all of

445
00:26:51,365 --> 00:26:55,285
Speaker 6:  the desks that we cover, I do a lot of work with the policy team. Over

446
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:59,005
Speaker 6:  the past year we were covering some major Supreme Court decisions.

447
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:02,965
Speaker 6:  The Supreme Court ha has been absolutely made over with

448
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:07,765
Speaker 6:  Trump's previous appointees. That's made it more difficult. Some of those

449
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:11,365
Speaker 6:  Supreme Court decisions have made it more difficult to regulate industry.

450
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:15,325
Speaker 6:  So, you know, that has wide reaching effects and

451
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:18,845
Speaker 6:  So I, that for me is a, the Story of the year

452
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:20,285
Speaker 6:  going into next year.

453
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:25,005
Speaker 1:  Is there anything on your mind on that front right now, other than

454
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:28,965
Speaker 1:  just sort of sheer abject screaming and

455
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:32,765
Speaker 1:  rage all the time? I feel like we're, we're in a moment now where, where

456
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:35,725
Speaker 1:  like we as reporters and also just like we as people are going to have to

457
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:39,645
Speaker 1:  figure out like how to talk about this stuff other than just

458
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:44,685
Speaker 1:  what sometimes feels like directionless screaming all

459
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:48,285
Speaker 1:  the time. Like what, what's on your mind as you're thinking about kind of

460
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:51,325
Speaker 1:  the, the stories inside of this that you're thinking about over the next

461
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:51,725
Speaker 1:  year or so?

462
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:55,905
Speaker 6:  One thing that's gonna be really interesting to watch is what happens at

463
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:59,865
Speaker 6:  the state and local level. You know, in the past that

464
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,985
Speaker 6:  that has been where people have counteracted

465
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:07,345
Speaker 6:  what's going on at the federal level, made progress when there's been an

466
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:10,905
Speaker 6:  action at the national level. And so it'll be really interesting to see

467
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,745
Speaker 6:  what comes out of that sort of local

468
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:18,465
Speaker 6:  organizing moving forward. And then another

469
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:22,505
Speaker 6:  interesting place to watch, which is like

470
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:26,465
Speaker 6:  very divisive in the environmental community, but surprisingly

471
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:30,145
Speaker 6:  super bipartisan is gonna be nuclear

472
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:32,145
Speaker 6:  energy. And So I was gonna ask you about this.

473
00:28:32,215 --> 00:28:32,505
Speaker 1:  Okay.

474
00:28:32,535 --> 00:28:35,785
Speaker 6:  Yeah, exactly. So I mean. If you're looking at just

475
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:40,545
Speaker 6:  my beat on The Verge, I think one of the biggest stories has been this,

476
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:45,665
Speaker 6:  is it too soon to say nuclear renaissance? It's probably too soon. But there's

477
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:50,465
Speaker 6:  anything Renaissance is like overkill, right? But yeah, but there's been

478
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:54,905
Speaker 6:  a whole lot of interest in nuclear energy, particularly from

479
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:59,025
Speaker 6:  tech companies looking for electricity,

480
00:28:59,365 --> 00:29:03,305
Speaker 6:  for energy hungry data centers. You know, this is a growing issue with

481
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:07,305
Speaker 6:  ai. We saw a slew of nuclear energy deals

482
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:10,145
Speaker 6:  from Amazon, Google,

483
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:11,865
Speaker 6:  Microsoft.

484
00:29:12,495 --> 00:29:16,105
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Three Mile Island is coming back. Like what a, what a weird

485
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:17,665
Speaker 1:  version of the timeline here.

486
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:21,585
Speaker 6:  So they say we'll have to watch and see. Fair. But,

487
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:25,945
Speaker 6:  but yes, but you know, Trump has been supportive of nuclear energy in the

488
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:29,185
Speaker 6:  past. It's gotten bipartisan support. If, you look at

489
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:33,985
Speaker 6:  Trump's pick to lead the Department of Energy, Chris Wright, he is

490
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:38,545
Speaker 6:  a fossil fuel executive, CEO of a fracking company, but also

491
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:42,405
Speaker 6:  sits on the board of a nuclear energy company with

492
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:46,045
Speaker 6:  Sam Altman. So that'll be really interesting to see that company is developing

493
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:50,765
Speaker 6:  advanced nuclear reactors. I don't know. We'll, we'll have to see what happens.

494
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:55,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I feel like with, with a lot of that stuff, I always get

495
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:58,925
Speaker 1:  tripped up trying to figure out how long these things take. Because on the

496
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:03,005
Speaker 1:  one hand we have these like super pressing issues and the,

497
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:06,325
Speaker 1:  there were the three Mile Island guy was basically saying like, we're ready.

498
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:09,205
Speaker 1:  Let's spin this back up and go back to work. Everything's gonna be terrific.

499
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,965
Speaker 1:  And then you hear about all these projects that are, you know, we're, we're

500
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:15,325
Speaker 1:  talking about like 20, 40 deadlines for things. And like, God only knows

501
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:19,205
Speaker 1:  where we'll be by 2040. Yeah. Is this stuff gonna start to

502
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:22,165
Speaker 1:  become sort of meaningfully real next year, do you think?

503
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:26,855
Speaker 6:  No. Okay. Okay. I think we, I think we may see more deals,

504
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:30,935
Speaker 6:  but the earliest projections that I've seen for the first advanced

505
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:34,495
Speaker 6:  nuclear reactors coming online are gonna be

506
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:38,415
Speaker 6:  probably the early 2030s. And so it's gonna be a while

507
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:42,615
Speaker 6:  before we see these, these new technologies. And to be clear,

508
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:46,375
Speaker 6:  those are next generation nuclear reactors that have not

509
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,855
Speaker 6:  been deployed in the US yet. You know, they still need to get all of the

510
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:53,175
Speaker 6:  regulatory approvals and everything. Not to mention

511
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:58,335
Speaker 6:  the costs, because Sure. Both tradition, like old school

512
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:02,615
Speaker 6:  nuclear reactors, the, the big plants that we, we

513
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:06,735
Speaker 6:  have today, they're really expensive to build this, these next

514
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:10,295
Speaker 6:  generation technologies are supposed to be smaller and cheaper, but

515
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:14,015
Speaker 6:  projects have also run into rising costs too. So yeah. So

516
00:31:14,135 --> 00:31:17,135
Speaker 6:  that's why a lot of this stuff is still up in the air. You have all of the

517
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:21,615
Speaker 6:  regulatory and permitting delays, and then you have everything that's going

518
00:31:21,615 --> 00:31:25,455
Speaker 6:  on when it comes to making this actually an

519
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:26,815
Speaker 6:  affordable source of energy.

520
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:30,175
Speaker 1:  Got it. Okay. And I would say, it doesn't seem like the regulatory state

521
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:34,015
Speaker 1:  is going to get more efficient and effective in, in the very near future.

522
00:31:34,115 --> 00:31:37,455
Speaker 1:  So I would not say My hopes are super high, but hey, we'll, we'll take it.

523
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:41,095
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. We'll see what this efficiency task fork does. I mean, it could

524
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:42,815
Speaker 6:  just be like, go ahead, do whatever you want.

525
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,495
Speaker 1:  I mean, fair. That would be, it would go faster than short. Yeah, it would

526
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:50,135
Speaker 1:  go faster. All right. What was your favorite

527
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,215
Speaker 1:  New thing of the year?

528
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:55,255
Speaker 6:  Year? Okay. So I have to plug, I, I'm a really big documentary fan.

529
00:31:56,495 --> 00:32:00,135
Speaker 6:  I just, I love nonfiction. But I had to plug

530
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,135
Speaker 6:  this documentary that is still in theaters

531
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:07,935
Speaker 6:  called Nurse Unseen. It's about Filipino nurses. I,

532
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:12,375
Speaker 6:  I'm Filipino, my mom is a nurse. And you know, at the Emmy's this year,

533
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:16,375
Speaker 6:  you saw the host talk about how er went like 15

534
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:19,975
Speaker 6:  seasons without ever having a Filipino nurse If. you go into

535
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:24,415
Speaker 6:  almost any hospital medical establishment, you're bound to find

536
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:28,415
Speaker 6:  a lot of Filipino nurses. And so this documentary goes into the whole history

537
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:32,095
Speaker 6:  of that, why there's been a pipeline of nurses coming to the US from the

538
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:36,015
Speaker 6:  Philippines since really World War ii, the Philippines was a US territory.

539
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:39,525
Speaker 6:  But it also just talks about, it really focuses on

540
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:44,085
Speaker 6:  how these nurses were on the front lines during the pandemic and So

541
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:47,405
Speaker 6:  I just think it really gives voice to a community that's been overlooked

542
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,725
Speaker 6:  and has just done a lot for our healthcare system.

543
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:55,285
Speaker 6:  So that was one of my favorite documentaries of, of the year. That's

544
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:57,485
Speaker 6:  a really good one. And hoping that it's streaming soon. I

545
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:59,925
Speaker 1:  Was just about to ask, it's still, it's still in theaters right now.

546
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:04,005
Speaker 6:  It's still in theaters. Okay. I have heard that they're, well, I don't know,

547
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:06,685
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna give anything away. I'm hoping that it's streaming soon. Fair

548
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:06,885
Speaker 6:  enough.

549
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:10,365
Speaker 1:  Fair enough. We'll, we'll, we'll track it down in a theater. I love a documentary

550
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:13,085
Speaker 1:  on the big screen, by the way. It's like, it's sort of an unusual thing.

551
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:17,005
Speaker 1:  It feels like this is gonna sound less like a compliment

552
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:20,405
Speaker 1:  than, I mean it, but it's, it feels like school in like the best possible

553
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:24,325
Speaker 1:  way to sit in a, in a, especially in like a little tiny like art

554
00:33:24,325 --> 00:33:27,725
Speaker 1:  house thing. I went to a jazz documentary, like, frankly, I don't care about

555
00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:29,805
Speaker 1:  jazz, but like, I just sat in a room with a bunch of people who are like,

556
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:32,885
Speaker 1:  I wanna spend two hours learning about jazz. And it was delightful. And I

557
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,925
Speaker 1:  like, I'm like, I give me more of those moments of like sitting in a lecture

558
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:38,645
Speaker 1:  hall watching something really interesting together. Like, I kind of miss

559
00:33:38,645 --> 00:33:39,725
Speaker 1:  those days. It's good stuff.

560
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:43,525
Speaker 6:  Well, okay, I'll say my guilty pleasure this year's. I did go to a cat film

561
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:45,725
Speaker 6:  festival in New York City, A

562
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:46,685
Speaker 1:  Cat film festival.

563
00:33:46,685 --> 00:33:50,165
Speaker 6:  Alright. Yeah. Which is exactly how it sounds. It's like basically your

564
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:53,925
Speaker 6:  Instagram or TikTok reel full of cat videos, but on a big screen.

565
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:58,125
Speaker 6:  But you don't go for the videos, you go for the community and all of the

566
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:58,325
Speaker 6:  people

567
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:03,725
Speaker 6:  who love cats as much as you do, and like all of the like, cute

568
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,765
Speaker 6:  kids that are having a great time. And it's just, I don't know. Yeah, exactly.

569
00:34:06,905 --> 00:34:10,005
Speaker 6:  You, you go to documentaries and

570
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:14,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah, those kinds of screenings to just be with your people.

571
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:18,485
Speaker 1:  That's fantastic. It's like a, it's like a fake or it's like a backwards

572
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:21,365
Speaker 1:  way of having a cat convention. I love that very much. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

573
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:24,245
Speaker 1:  They're like, we're gonna pretend this is a movie, but it's just so a bunch

574
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,285
Speaker 1:  of cat people can hang out with each other. It's gonna be fun, I

575
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:29,245
Speaker 6:  Think. Yeah. I think that film festival is on tour as well.

576
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:34,085
Speaker 1:  Idea Unbeliev wants to watch it idea. I have, I have no notes on that. All

577
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,445
Speaker 1:  right. Did you have one more pick for us? What, what else is on your list?

578
00:34:37,595 --> 00:34:41,525
Speaker 6:  Okay, well, okay. I did pick one other documentary that,

579
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:45,205
Speaker 6:  that I also saw in theaters, but it's also streaming on Disney Plus and Hulu.

580
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:48,965
Speaker 6:  It's called Sugarcane. It premiered at the 2024

581
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:52,645
Speaker 6:  Sundance Film Festival this year. It's a really important watch. It's a,

582
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:56,005
Speaker 6:  it's a tough one as well. It, it's about an, an investigation

583
00:34:56,955 --> 00:35:00,245
Speaker 6:  into abuse at an Indian

584
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:04,125
Speaker 6:  residential school run by the Catholic church in Canada after they found

585
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:07,725
Speaker 6:  unmarked graves. It was created

586
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:11,925
Speaker 6:  by an advocate who is actually a source that I've interviewed

587
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:15,645
Speaker 6:  in the past. He's an environmental justice advocate,

588
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:19,325
Speaker 6:  but he, his dad went to the school and it's a really

589
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:23,325
Speaker 6:  powerful story too, about healing and his

590
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:26,285
Speaker 6:  relationship with his dad and how they move forward.

591
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,525
Speaker 6:  So that was another, another pick for me.

592
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:33,925
Speaker 1:  That's a really good one. Yeah. I feel like we're in this funny moment

593
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:37,925
Speaker 1:  of like, there are so many great documentaries out

594
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,445
Speaker 1:  there and my list of ones to watch now is so

595
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:45,085
Speaker 1:  infuriatingly long that I just, I have to like, I

596
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:48,485
Speaker 1:  need to cancel all of my streaming services except for the documentary ones

597
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:51,565
Speaker 1:  for like six months and just catch up on documentaries and it's gonna be

598
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:55,085
Speaker 1:  great. Very excited about it. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. All right,

599
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:57,085
Speaker 1:  Justine, thank you so much. Appreciate you doing this.

600
00:35:57,315 --> 00:36:01,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah, thanks. Oh, sorry. The other thing for the non-tech thing I forgot

601
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:05,245
Speaker 6:  was our, our 2004 package was incredible

602
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:09,285
Speaker 6:  this year. Like just, it just brought me back to high school. And even

603
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:13,085
Speaker 6:  just our talking about making that happen

604
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:17,365
Speaker 6:  was just so much fun. Like all of us on The Verge staff liked combing

605
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:21,285
Speaker 6:  through our pictures, trying to find them from 2004 and discovering that

606
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:23,925
Speaker 6:  they've all vanished and then seeing the story that came out of that was,

607
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:24,405
Speaker 6:  was awesome.

608
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:28,965
Speaker 1:  The first run of people's pictures from 2004 was pretty spectacular.

609
00:36:28,995 --> 00:36:32,885
Speaker 1:  Everybody seemed to have like one photo from that year, and

610
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:36,765
Speaker 1:  it's always incredibly embarrassing and it

611
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:38,405
Speaker 1:  just Terrific. Loved it. Very much

612
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:39,685
Speaker 6:  Love.

613
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:43,365
Speaker 1:  Yeah. All love it. All of my 2004 photos are just like me wearing two popped

614
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:46,925
Speaker 1:  collars and like a pukka shell necklace. It was not, yes. Not like a cool

615
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:48,845
Speaker 1:  time in my history. I wouldn't say.

616
00:36:48,865 --> 00:36:51,525
Speaker 6:  Oh my God. Yeah, I can see that so clearly.

617
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:58,045
Speaker 1:  Well, that's the meanest thing you've ever said to me. Ine hurts my feelings.

618
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:03,365
Speaker 6:  No, no, that was, I mean, who didn't have a pook shell necklace? Right.

619
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:07,045
Speaker 1:  Listen, I got out of it. That's all I can say. It's, there you go. It took

620
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:08,485
Speaker 1:  too long to get out of it. Is

621
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:11,685
Speaker 6:  It back yet? I'm like, all that stuff is coming back. Right? I'm just waiting

622
00:37:11,715 --> 00:37:13,885
Speaker 6:  till I see the high school students rocking it again.

623
00:37:14,085 --> 00:37:17,365
Speaker 1:  I assume So. My I have two nephews in high school right now, and neither

624
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:21,125
Speaker 1:  of them are wearing puka, but like frosted tips I think are starting to come

625
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:24,565
Speaker 1:  back. So like, it's, it's coming. Yeah. The, the pukas are coming. It's,

626
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:25,485
Speaker 1:  it's a terrifying thought.

627
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:37,435
Speaker 1:  our supervising producer on our video team. Veen. Hello.

628
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:38,275
Speaker 7:  Hello.

629
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:41,995
Speaker 1:  You told us before we started recording that you didn't prepare at all, so

630
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:44,915
Speaker 1:  this is gonna go really great or really terribly. Yeah, either way. I'm very

631
00:42:44,915 --> 00:42:46,195
Speaker 1:  excited. It's,

632
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:46,915
Speaker 7:  It's gonna go great.

633
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:48,515
Speaker 1:  I, I feel good about it.

634
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:52,675
Speaker 7:  I'm always under-prepared for everything that we do. So it's

635
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:55,515
Speaker 1:  Under promise and overdeliver. That's the, the VE end story.

636
00:42:55,855 --> 00:42:59,715
Speaker 7:  It usually ends up pretty good. So, you know, let's let,

637
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:00,315
Speaker 7:  let's try it out.

638
00:43:00,535 --> 00:43:03,635
Speaker 1:  I'm into it. So thing number one was the Story of the year. What's your Story

639
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:04,195
Speaker 1:  of the year? Yeah.

640
00:43:05,295 --> 00:43:09,135
Speaker 7:  I'm immediately coming with a curve ball here. I'm gonna pick

641
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:12,775
Speaker 7:  a video of the year. I am a supervising producer at The Verge So I. Feel

642
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:16,295
Speaker 7:  like, I feel like I can pick a video. Is that okay? Can I break the rules

643
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:16,575
Speaker 7:  here?

644
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,575
Speaker 1:  You, yeah, you can pick whatever you want. Okay.

645
00:43:18,955 --> 00:43:22,495
Speaker 7:  For video of the year, I have to go with the Vision

646
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:26,655
Speaker 7:  Pro Review because it was just like one of those like classic

647
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,575
Speaker 7:  VERGE reviews that was just like way overproduced

648
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:35,695
Speaker 7:  in a short period of time. It was a whole team just

649
00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:40,055
Speaker 7:  working together. Like late into the night. The script

650
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:43,695
Speaker 7:  that Neli delivered came in incredibly late

651
00:43:44,115 --> 00:43:47,935
Speaker 7:  and was incredibly good. It was just like one read and it was like,

652
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:51,855
Speaker 7:  this is amazing. The only problem is it's currently 35 minutes long,

653
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:56,135
Speaker 7:  we're gonna have to cut like a third of it out, which we did. But

654
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:59,175
Speaker 7:  it was such a strong script, it was really good. And then just, you know,

655
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:03,135
Speaker 7:  it was a new, new product category for Apple. A lot

656
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:07,055
Speaker 7:  of eyes on it. Yeah. It just felt like, I, I love

657
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:10,335
Speaker 7:  the hustle, I love the time crunch, I love embargoes, I love all that stuff.

658
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:14,615
Speaker 7:  It is exhausting, but it was very exciting time

659
00:44:14,615 --> 00:44:17,895
Speaker 7:  of the year and it was like very much at the beginning of 2024. And it feels

660
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:21,815
Speaker 7:  like, I don't know, it feels like it was either like two days ago or

661
00:44:21,845 --> 00:44:24,175
Speaker 7:  like seven years ago. I can decide. Yeah,

662
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:28,055
Speaker 1:  I hear that. I feel like if, if we had been talking

663
00:44:28,155 --> 00:44:31,525
Speaker 1:  in February, like what are gonna be the, you know, technology

664
00:44:31,995 --> 00:44:35,765
Speaker 1:  stories of the year for 2024, I feel like we all would've picked the Vision

665
00:44:35,825 --> 00:44:37,485
Speaker 1:  Pro to be one of them. And

666
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:43,405
Speaker 1:  our video was very good. The Vision Pro less

667
00:44:43,405 --> 00:44:47,365
Speaker 1:  good. And I think the, what we've seen in the 10 months

668
00:44:47,615 --> 00:44:51,205
Speaker 1:  since that thing came out at this point is it kind of feels like it just

669
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:55,245
Speaker 1:  died. I don't know, like do you, does anyone you know, talk about or care

670
00:44:55,245 --> 00:44:56,365
Speaker 1:  about the Vision Pro anymore?

671
00:44:57,025 --> 00:45:00,845
Speaker 7:  No. There's always like a moment on threads. Maybe

672
00:45:00,955 --> 00:45:04,925
Speaker 7:  when somebody who has the Vision Pro is like, Hey, this cool thing came

673
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:08,605
Speaker 7:  out, you should look at it. And I see a screen recording, I'm like, oh, that's

674
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,595
Speaker 7:  great. Move on. But

675
00:45:12,385 --> 00:45:16,275
Speaker 7:  like, like two weeks ago. Yeah, the Ultra Wide Monitor support came out.

676
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:16,635
Speaker 7:  People

677
00:45:16,635 --> 00:45:17,795
Speaker 1:  Are excited about this. Yeah.

678
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:21,795
Speaker 7:  Looks pretty sick. Like pairing it with a Mac Mini and having that, like,

679
00:45:22,225 --> 00:45:26,075
Speaker 7:  that work space incredibly amazing. You'll still need a

680
00:45:26,075 --> 00:45:29,595
Speaker 7:  monitor. It's, it's not like you can just live in Vision Pro

681
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:33,835
Speaker 7:  and like fully beat yourself into it. I did

682
00:45:33,935 --> 00:45:37,555
Speaker 7:  use it, you know, during our testing period

683
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,715
Speaker 7:  and, and everything. And that was the thing that I actually enjoyed the most.

684
00:45:42,185 --> 00:45:46,155
Speaker 7:  Just external monitor, using it as just like an

685
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:49,995
Speaker 7:  extra monitor, like leaning into a

686
00:45:49,995 --> 00:45:53,835
Speaker 7:  Lightroom photo, right? Or like just

687
00:45:53,905 --> 00:45:57,515
Speaker 7:  getting closer to it and doing some like brushes and

688
00:45:57,515 --> 00:46:01,435
Speaker 7:  coloring and everything did actually feel incredibly fun.

689
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,035
Speaker 7:  Like I thoroughly enjoyed that. I don't know if I can do it for hours and

690
00:46:05,035 --> 00:46:08,635
Speaker 7:  hours and hours. But being in the Vision Pro, like virtual

691
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:12,275
Speaker 7:  monitor, using it, that was like, that was for me the, the

692
00:46:12,345 --> 00:46:15,435
Speaker 7:  best use case for it. I do wish,

693
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:19,875
Speaker 7:  like Apple Pencil gets some kind of support there.

694
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:23,155
Speaker 7:  'cause it does, it takes you away when you have to like go back to keyboard

695
00:46:23,175 --> 00:46:27,075
Speaker 7:  and mouse sort of thing. You know, like it's just, it's like, oh, okay.

696
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:30,075
Speaker 7:  I'm still using kind of a similar input here. Even though the,

697
00:46:31,085 --> 00:46:34,495
Speaker 7:  like the feature is good. So I, I wish there was like more there to do,

698
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:38,935
Speaker 7:  even just like zooming in or like doing more stuff with it. So

699
00:46:38,935 --> 00:46:42,015
Speaker 7:  that was like a good use case. So, I do, do understand why people are very

700
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:45,495
Speaker 7:  excited about the ultra wide monitor. But yeah, the price is just

701
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:50,215
Speaker 7:  too extreme for anyone to like buy this and,

702
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:54,015
Speaker 7:  and use it. But, you know, it's, it's impressive and

703
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:55,295
Speaker 7:  it's just too expensive.

704
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:59,135
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I, I could not agree more. And the improvement

705
00:46:59,435 --> 00:47:03,135
Speaker 1:  is increasingly far away. It seems like, like the, the

706
00:47:03,135 --> 00:47:06,775
Speaker 1:  solutions to this problem seem like they keep slipping out, but let's move

707
00:47:06,775 --> 00:47:10,695
Speaker 1:  on. No thing number two, your favorite New thing of the

708
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:10,855
Speaker 1:  year.

709
00:47:11,925 --> 00:47:13,135
Speaker 7:  It's Division Pro. No, I'm kidding.

710
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:15,175
Speaker 7:  How

711
00:47:15,175 --> 00:47:15,855
Speaker 1:  Do this Good twist.

712
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:20,655
Speaker 7:  Yeah, by the way. All right. I struggle with this one

713
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:24,495
Speaker 7:  a little bit because there are like two things. One also came

714
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:28,295
Speaker 7:  out a long time ago, or at least it was announced a long time ago. It's the

715
00:47:28,455 --> 00:47:30,485
Speaker 7:  Fuji X 106. Yep.

716
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:32,125
Speaker 1:  I figured that might be your answer.

717
00:47:32,605 --> 00:47:35,165
Speaker 7:  I, I, I know, I'm, I'm so predictable.

718
00:47:36,745 --> 00:47:40,725
Speaker 7:  The thing about it is that, you know, I've had the X 100, I

719
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:44,085
Speaker 7:  don't know, second or third generation long time ago and

720
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:49,005
Speaker 7:  decided to get rid of it. And I've been missing it ever since.

721
00:47:49,305 --> 00:47:53,195
Speaker 7:  So when this one came out, I was still a little hesitant, like,

722
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:56,555
Speaker 7:  oh, do I really to spend money on yet another camera? And I did it,

723
00:47:57,535 --> 00:48:01,115
Speaker 7:  it took eight months for it to get delivered. So I just got it like last

724
00:48:01,115 --> 00:48:03,995
Speaker 7:  month, right? It was like eight months. Oh wow. Yeah. I order, I ordered

725
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,005
Speaker 7:  on like the day that it came out. Think, yeah,

726
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:10,725
Speaker 1:  We talked about it on this show, how you, you were like in the middle of

727
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:12,085
Speaker 1:  talking yourself into buying it.

728
00:48:12,465 --> 00:48:16,405
Speaker 7:  Oh my God, that is very true. I forgot I for look at this. What a, what a

729
00:48:16,405 --> 00:48:20,365
Speaker 7:  beautiful first circle. So I've only been using it for a little bit and I've

730
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:23,045
Speaker 7:  had a couple of trips, couple of work trips, and it's just like, oh yeah,

731
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:27,445
Speaker 7:  the, this is, this is my favorite thing. Like I just love this

732
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:31,285
Speaker 7:  camera so much. I've been also reviewing some bigger cameras and

733
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:35,245
Speaker 7:  they like that difference between like, hey, a tiny little 35 millimeter

734
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:38,245
Speaker 7:  camera and a big full frame camera. It's like,

735
00:48:39,605 --> 00:48:43,485
Speaker 7:  I still love this little tiny camera so much. So that

736
00:48:43,605 --> 00:48:47,285
Speaker 7:  was pr, that, that's probably my pick. I'm also like incredibly like

737
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:48,805
Speaker 7:  indecisive person. So.

738
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:51,925
Speaker 1:  Okay. What was your other one? Just gimme, gimme 10 seconds on the, on your

739
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:52,965
Speaker 1:  Honorable Mention here.

740
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:54,525
Speaker 7:  Keynote app.

741
00:48:55,305 --> 00:48:57,845
Speaker 1:  Ooh, the Hali video one, right? Yeah.

742
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:01,765
Speaker 7:  Okay. Like, you know, I did the iPhone review in tandem with

743
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:05,645
Speaker 7:  Neli this year, and it was kind of the first time

744
00:49:06,525 --> 00:49:10,045
Speaker 7:  a little bit disclaimer. I, my first, my, my, my personal phone was like

745
00:49:10,045 --> 00:49:13,645
Speaker 7:  a 13 Pro. It didn't have any of the fancy recording features.

746
00:49:14,065 --> 00:49:17,885
Speaker 7:  So it was like, oh, now I have pros, now I have Apple Log. Wow. Pro

747
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:21,885
Speaker 7:  is is like so huge. I can't work with this. So Keynote was

748
00:49:21,945 --> 00:49:25,445
Speaker 7:  the option that had the, you know, HEVC files

749
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:30,045
Speaker 7:  use that. The LUTs that they have built in are really good.

750
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:34,725
Speaker 7:  I like Tyler Salman's lut the most. It's just

751
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:38,685
Speaker 7:  really nice. I've been using it a lot more. So finally I have an action button.

752
00:49:39,345 --> 00:49:43,205
Speaker 7:  It is programmed to open Keynote. I use an

753
00:49:43,205 --> 00:49:46,645
Speaker 7:  iPhone as a camera a lot more this year than ever before.

754
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:50,965
Speaker 1:  That's a good one. I like that. All right, last thing. Your favorite non-tech

755
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:54,245
Speaker 1:  thing of the year. This can be any, anything you want. It just can't be tech.

756
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:58,565
Speaker 7:  This was tough. Liam was helping me out 'cause because I did ask him like

757
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:02,125
Speaker 7:  ahead of time, we just walked away from a meeting and I was like, do you

758
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:04,005
Speaker 7:  know what I should do? He's like, I don't know. It can be anything. Like

759
00:50:04,005 --> 00:50:07,525
Speaker 7:  maybe you got good at making coffee. In fact, yes, I did get a coffee machine.

760
00:50:07,645 --> 00:50:11,165
Speaker 7:  Did you? Yeah. So that's one of the things. The other one is,

761
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:15,325
Speaker 7:  yeah, it's good to step away from our tech bubble. We're all in our tech

762
00:50:15,325 --> 00:50:18,845
Speaker 7:  bubble and the way that I do it recently is this

763
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:22,885
Speaker 7:  magazine called Mounting Gazette. It is absolutely massive.

764
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,885
Speaker 7:  And I do mean like physically it's just like a, a big magazine. Oh wow.

765
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:27,685
Speaker 1:  Okay. Sure.

766
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:31,605
Speaker 7:  But yeah, it's all about outdoorsy stuff. It's all about like ski, well it

767
00:50:31,605 --> 00:50:35,165
Speaker 7:  depends on the season, but skiing, snowboarding, just being

768
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:39,085
Speaker 7:  outdoors. It is, it used to be a magazine

769
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:43,645
Speaker 7:  long, long time ago and someone who lives up in

770
00:50:43,735 --> 00:50:47,725
Speaker 7:  Tahoe area, he decided to buy the brand back and now he's

771
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:51,525
Speaker 7:  making this really beautifully crafted magazine

772
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:55,865
Speaker 7:  and I feel like, I don't know, I'm, I am a print

773
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:59,705
Speaker 7:  person. So, I do like print products and it

774
00:50:59,705 --> 00:51:03,665
Speaker 7:  just feels nice to kick back, open it up, look at some

775
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:07,665
Speaker 7:  beautiful photography and read about

776
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:11,385
Speaker 7:  stuff that I really like, which is skiing and snowboarding. So,

777
00:51:11,545 --> 00:51:14,265
Speaker 1:  I. Love that. You know what I was thinking about the other day? I

778
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:18,865
Speaker 1:  haven't bought a coffee table book in a million years make, because it just

779
00:51:18,865 --> 00:51:22,345
Speaker 1:  feels like those don't exist anymore. A we should make one. I agree. Yeah,

780
00:51:22,385 --> 00:51:26,225
Speaker 1:  we should. But b like magazine as coffee table

781
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:29,745
Speaker 1:  book is kind of an incredible idea. Just like, give me a big, giant thing

782
00:51:29,905 --> 00:51:31,465
Speaker 1:  I can bring into my house.

783
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:35,465
Speaker 7:  I think that would be it. I don't, I don't know. I don't know. I don't, I,

784
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,025
Speaker 7:  I don't know. I got into That's good.

785
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:39,905
Speaker 1:  These are good answers. What's the, what coffee machine did you buy? Tell

786
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:40,985
Speaker 1:  me that and then I'll let you go.

787
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:44,985
Speaker 7:  It is a, it's one of the Breville ones that has a grinder

788
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,825
Speaker 7:  on top and a milk thing onto the side.

789
00:51:49,285 --> 00:51:53,025
Speaker 1:  Oh, the whole, you got the whole pipeline going now. Yes. Yes. Once you,

790
00:51:53,055 --> 00:51:55,945
Speaker 1:  once a milk frother becomes part of your coffee experience. There's just

791
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:59,785
Speaker 1:  no going back. Yeah. It life is better and it will never go

792
00:51:59,785 --> 00:51:59,985
Speaker 1:  back.

793
00:52:00,415 --> 00:52:04,065
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it is very nice. But I did struggle at first, like, it took a while

794
00:52:04,085 --> 00:52:06,745
Speaker 7:  to like figure out like, all right, what do you want me to do here? I like

795
00:52:06,745 --> 00:52:10,705
Speaker 7:  went through many like bags, like beans and bags of coffee and I'm

796
00:52:10,705 --> 00:52:14,545
Speaker 7:  like, great. I spent like $16 in these beans and I've got like

797
00:52:14,555 --> 00:52:18,305
Speaker 7:  three cups of coffee. This is bullshit. I'm gonna go back to my

798
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:22,225
Speaker 7:  Nespresso pots. No, but I finally figured it out

799
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:25,065
Speaker 7:  and I, there's a lot of coffee shops in the neighborhood that I really like,

800
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:28,745
Speaker 7:  and every time I like to visit in New York, I go to a few of them as well.

801
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:32,785
Speaker 7:  I'm like, I need those beans. So yeah, I really became a little bit of a

802
00:52:32,905 --> 00:52:34,865
Speaker 7:  snob, but not, not an annoying snob,

803
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:39,345
Speaker 1:  But welcome because again, there is no going

804
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:43,305
Speaker 1:  back. It costs a fortune and it takes forever, but

805
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:44,425
Speaker 1:  it is, it is worth

806
00:52:44,425 --> 00:52:48,025
Speaker 7:  It. I still think it costs less than buying coffee anywhere else.

807
00:52:48,405 --> 00:52:48,625
Speaker 7:  So

808
00:52:49,185 --> 00:52:51,225
Speaker 1:  Veer, thank you as always. Appreciate it.

809
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:52,225
Speaker 7:  See ya.

810
00:52:53,165 --> 00:52:56,735
Speaker 1:  Next up on my list, Kylie Robinson, our senior AI reporter.

811
00:52:57,445 --> 00:53:01,315
Speaker 1:  Kylie. Hello. Hello. How you feeling? You sound like you

812

814
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:08,475
Speaker 7:  bit of a cold, but I'm happy to

815
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:11,195
Speaker 1:  Be here. Good. All right. Well, we won't keep you long. Let's just, let's

816
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:15,115
Speaker 1:  just blast through this. Cool. So I'm just gonna preface this

817
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:19,115
Speaker 1:  with, someone else already picked AI as the Story of the year,

818
00:53:19,135 --> 00:53:22,915
Speaker 1:  so you can pick it If you want to, but just know that you'll be copying

819
00:53:22,915 --> 00:53:26,515
Speaker 1:  Jake. All that said, what's your Story of the year?

820
00:53:26,905 --> 00:53:30,715
Speaker 8:  It's gonna be just a common theme of Billionaire. crybabies.

821
00:53:33,725 --> 00:53:37,595
Speaker 8:  Sorry. Sorry guys. But that's true. Like the common theme of the year. All

822
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:41,555
Speaker 8:  I'm thinking about is Jeff Bezos stomping his feet. Elon stomping his

823
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:44,235
Speaker 8:  feet, Sam stomping his feet. Sam Altman,

824
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:49,515
Speaker 8:  lots of billionaires stomping their feet over issues and

825
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:53,715
Speaker 8:  wanting their way and less regulation. That's the common theme of the year

826
00:53:53,975 --> 00:53:57,795
Speaker 8:  for sure. Whether it's AI or, you know, energy or,

827
00:53:58,175 --> 00:53:59,595
Speaker 8:  you know, what have you. Hardware

828
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:02,395
Speaker 1:  Or American politics, American politic, like it really is American politics.

829
00:54:02,715 --> 00:54:06,305
Speaker 1:  There are like several childish billionaires

830
00:54:06,565 --> 00:54:09,625
Speaker 1:  who seem to just be everywhere doing everything all the time. They're making

831
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:13,465
Speaker 1:  popular podcasts now. Yes. It's like, just leave us, let us have this one.

832
00:54:13,775 --> 00:54:14,065
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

833
00:54:14,205 --> 00:54:17,705
Speaker 8:  You put a tariff on straight men with podcasts,

834
00:54:18,405 --> 00:54:21,265
Speaker 8:  put under mics, put a tariff. 200%. That's a good idea.

835
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:25,665
Speaker 8:  But yeah, I think that's probably something we're gonna continue seeing.

836
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:29,785
Speaker 8:  I feel like with the incoming Trump administration, that's something

837
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:33,345
Speaker 8:  that's only gonna strengthen is billionaires

838
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:37,145
Speaker 8:  saying, you know, let's, let's be chill. Be chill with my products, my company

839
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:42,305
Speaker 8:  please you like, you like iPhones. Right. Come on man. So that was the

840
00:54:42,305 --> 00:54:44,265
Speaker 8:  theme of this year, and I think we're just gonna continue seeing that.

841
00:54:44,645 --> 00:54:47,345
Speaker 1:  Do you think it's gonna be that, or do you think the billionaires are now

842
00:54:47,345 --> 00:54:50,945
Speaker 1:  gonna be like, we've won, let's go

843
00:54:51,495 --> 00:54:51,785
Speaker 1:  away.

844
00:54:52,575 --> 00:54:54,505
Speaker 8:  Like, like hide. Like be it, not

845
00:54:54,505 --> 00:54:57,985
Speaker 1:  Even hide, but like it some point it's like they did it right, like they

846
00:54:57,985 --> 00:55:01,785
Speaker 1:  got everything they wanted and now go enjoy

847
00:55:01,845 --> 00:55:03,905
Speaker 1:  all of your money in yachts or whatever.

848
00:55:04,955 --> 00:55:08,075
Speaker 8:  Hmm. Interesting. I think they're still gonna have to argue with Trump again.

849
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:11,915
Speaker 8:  These tariffs are so weird and Elon has his ear. And that's something I'm

850
00:55:11,915 --> 00:55:15,315
Speaker 8:  thinking a a lot about because I was reading the OpenAI

851
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:19,435
Speaker 8:  Elon lawsuit and to me it reads like, you know, I

852
00:55:19,665 --> 00:55:23,115
Speaker 8:  have the incoming president's ear and look, they're being

853
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:26,595
Speaker 8:  anti-competitive and you know, So I think these people, if

854
00:55:26,815 --> 00:55:29,395
Speaker 8:  Elon's on Trump's side, these people are still gonna have to like, you know,

855
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:30,795
Speaker 8:  kiss up, if that makes sense.

856
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:34,915
Speaker 1:  True. Or in the, on the flip side, they get to start pointing

857
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:38,275
Speaker 1:  at their enemies from right inside of the White House and Exactly. Picking

858
00:55:38,275 --> 00:55:39,075
Speaker 1:  fights that way. Yeah,

859
00:55:39,105 --> 00:55:39,595
Speaker 8:  Exactly.

860
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:43,275
Speaker 1:  Okay. Well that's not the most uplifting one I've heard, but yeah, unfortunately,

861
00:55:43,475 --> 00:55:46,515
Speaker 1:  I think you can, you can describe a lot of what's happening in the world

862
00:55:46,535 --> 00:55:47,795
Speaker 1:  to that small group of people.

863
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:51,155
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I'm sort of delirious on Sudafed and that is of course the first thing

864
00:55:51,155 --> 00:55:54,195
Speaker 8:  that came to mind. It's just, it, it's what?

865
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:58,115
Speaker 1:  It's Love it. All right. What was your favorite new tech thing of the year?

866
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,515
Speaker 8:  It, it was Stardew Valley.

867
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:01,995
Speaker 1:  Woo. Okay.

868
00:56:02,715 --> 00:56:05,355
Speaker 8:  It's very, like, whenever I say that, they're like, people are like, oh,

869
00:56:05,355 --> 00:56:08,475
Speaker 8:  I played that in Covid. Like, why are you playing it now? The new update

870
00:56:08,475 --> 00:56:12,355
Speaker 8:  just came out for the switch, which means I get different colored cats

871
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:15,395
Speaker 8:  and all sorts of new ways to explore

872
00:56:16,295 --> 00:56:19,475
Speaker 8:  the town. But yeah, that cozy comfort games.

873
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:24,485
Speaker 8:  I have a very cozy comfort house. I just love Stardy

874
00:56:24,485 --> 00:56:25,125
Speaker 8:  Valley. It's,

875
00:56:25,345 --> 00:56:28,485
Speaker 1:  Can you just explain Stardy Valley to me? I've never played it. Of course.

876
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:32,445
Speaker 1:  And I feel like everyone describes it in a way that almost

877
00:56:32,445 --> 00:56:36,285
Speaker 1:  never makes any sense. Wow. Everybody says very nice things like you

878
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:39,285
Speaker 1:  just said, but the the, you just were like, now I have different colored

879
00:56:39,285 --> 00:56:42,125
Speaker 1:  cats. Yeah. And that's like the explanation for why this game is better.

880
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:44,485
Speaker 1:  Explain this to me. Teach me about Stary Valley.

881
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:47,845
Speaker 8:  Do you know what animal crossing is? I do animal crossing with combat.

882
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:52,045
Speaker 1:  Oh, that is very compelling. Yeah, it's really fun. That's a, that's a good

883
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:52,285
Speaker 1:  case.

884
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:56,885
Speaker 8:  Yeah, you get to like, beat up monsters and caves and you know, like

885
00:56:56,885 --> 00:57:00,285
Speaker 8:  you have to grind really hard for resources, almost like a Minecraft

886
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:03,565
Speaker 8:  situation. You have to grant for these resources and then you get to make

887
00:57:03,565 --> 00:57:07,005
Speaker 8:  like your cool little farm. You get to marry someone in the game.

888
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:11,565
Speaker 8:  I just did an interview with somebody for The Verge that is yet to come out,

889
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:14,045
Speaker 8:  but they said that they were really into Star Du and the first thing we ask

890
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:17,885
Speaker 8:  each other is, who did you marry? Mine is Harvey. He's the doctor at the

891
00:57:18,045 --> 00:57:18,965
Speaker 8:  town's doctor. Nice.

892
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:19,925
Speaker 1:  Good for you.

893
00:57:20,195 --> 00:57:23,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah, actually V asked me that when I first started at The Verge. She said,

894
00:57:23,805 --> 00:57:25,125
Speaker 8:  who did you marry and star you? I can't remember.

895
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:27,685
Speaker 1:  This is like a personality test, do you think? Like, can you tell a lot about

896
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:30,405
Speaker 1:  somebody? Exactly. Based on who they marry and star you. Okay, interesting.

897
00:57:30,545 --> 00:57:34,285
Speaker 8:  But yeah, there was a new update. You can sink ungodly

898
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:37,965
Speaker 8:  amounts of hours into it 'cause it is so fun and chill and yeah.

899
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:38,765
Speaker 8:  Cozy comfort games.

900
00:57:39,085 --> 00:57:42,685
Speaker 1:  I really have developed an affinity for games that are

901
00:57:42,955 --> 00:57:46,765
Speaker 1:  like pointless in the best way. Yes. Like for, for forever.

902
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,965
Speaker 1:  All the games I liked were like games where you work up to the big boss and

903
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:53,285
Speaker 1:  then you beat the big boss and then the game is over. Right. Hell yeah. Like

904
00:57:53,285 --> 00:57:56,965
Speaker 1:  that was what I always played. And I would

905
00:57:57,155 --> 00:58:00,765
Speaker 1:  encounter games like Star do, or even like Animal Crossing or Minecraft in

906
00:58:00,765 --> 00:58:03,405
Speaker 1:  these games. And I would just be like, what's the point of this game? And

907
00:58:03,405 --> 00:58:06,845
Speaker 1:  it took me so long to wrap my head around the idea that the point of the

908
00:58:06,845 --> 00:58:09,765
Speaker 1:  game is just to play the game. Yes. And it's like, it's fun to play the game

909
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:13,845
Speaker 1:  and that's actually enough. And there's a real, like, it's the friends

910
00:58:13,905 --> 00:58:17,765
Speaker 1:  we made along the way kind of vibe to these games that I have like really

911
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:20,285
Speaker 1:  come to appreciate in the last couple of years. Totally.

912
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:23,605
Speaker 8:  Animal Crossing was a bit too pointless for me. Like I was getting too figety

913
00:58:23,605 --> 00:58:27,565
Speaker 8:  with that one. But Star do has like, you know, stuff to work towards

914
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,645
Speaker 8:  like goals and quests, which I really appreciate. I restarted

915
00:58:31,905 --> 00:58:35,845
Speaker 8:  Skyrim this year too, which is like another pointless time sink

916
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,525
Speaker 8:  from 2011. But you, you gotta love it.

917
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:42,845
Speaker 1:  I, yeah, I agree. I've also recently gone back all in on the switch.

918
00:58:43,435 --> 00:58:43,725
Speaker 8:  Nice.

919
00:58:43,905 --> 00:58:45,405
Speaker 1:  And it's gonna be Stardy time. Good

920
00:58:45,405 --> 00:58:46,085
Speaker 8:  Choice. Hell

921
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:49,845
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I have this old yellow original switch. Wow. The

922
00:58:49,845 --> 00:58:53,405
Speaker 1:  battery is trash. Wow. But the games are awesome. I don't care. It's amazing.

923
00:58:53,605 --> 00:58:56,365
Speaker 8:  I love it. I, I hear we might be getting another switch next year, but they've

924
00:58:56,365 --> 00:58:57,525
Speaker 8:  said that every year for many years.

925
00:58:58,205 --> 00:59:01,245
Speaker 1:  Honestly, it's getting to the point now where like every one of these Nintendo

926
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:05,125
Speaker 1:  head fakes is a, a little funnier than the last because it's a very,

927
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:08,205
Speaker 1:  very funny thing that Nintendo is doing where everybody wants a switch and

928
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:11,605
Speaker 1:  they're like, just kidding. We did a museum and an alarm clock and a music

929
00:59:11,665 --> 00:59:15,645
Speaker 1:  app. Fucking a like, very funny, but also just release the

930
00:59:15,675 --> 00:59:18,525
Speaker 1:  damn switch. Please gimme the switch. Yeah, I do. I would like to have it

931
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:21,325
Speaker 1:  in my house. Like, give me one Exactly. And then keep doing these funny jokes

932
00:59:21,345 --> 00:59:21,845
Speaker 1:  and I'm ready.

933
00:59:21,845 --> 00:59:22,405
Speaker 8:  Right, exactly.

934
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,245
Speaker 1:  That's fine.

935
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:25,085
Speaker 8:  As long as I'm in on it. Yeah, just

936
00:59:25,085 --> 00:59:28,685
Speaker 1:  Give just you and me just the two of us. Right. Perfect. Not Andrew Webster

937
00:59:28,685 --> 00:59:32,605
Speaker 1:  because he, he doesn't want one at all and doesn't spend all his time

938
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:33,205
Speaker 1:  thinking about this.

939
00:59:33,235 --> 00:59:33,725
Speaker 8:  Perfect.

940
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:37,605
Speaker 1:  All right, last thing. Your favorite non-tech thing of the year.

941
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,805
Speaker 8:  My favorite non-tech thing has been, oh, it's gonna sound so

942
00:59:41,805 --> 00:59:44,245
Speaker 8:  lame. 'cause I wrote it down and now it sounds more lame on a podcast.

943
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:48,925
Speaker 8:  Curated playlists in fresh flowers. Okay.

944
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:53,045
Speaker 8:  That's all you need in life is a nice little playlist. I made one for November

945
00:59:53,045 --> 00:59:56,165
Speaker 8:  because I've been traveling so much. I was in New York seeing you guys.

946
00:59:57,365 --> 01:00:01,245
Speaker 8:  I went on another reporting trip out of the state and I'm going to Texas

947
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:05,445
Speaker 8:  for Thanksgiving break. And you need a playlist for

948
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:09,325
Speaker 8:  that. And then getting to share that with everyone you like is a good time.

949
01:00:09,465 --> 01:00:13,125
Speaker 8:  So a little playlist to get you through and validation from your friends

950
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:13,965
Speaker 8:  about it. What's

951
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:17,885
Speaker 1:  Your playlisting process? Do you like spend hours? Oh no. Okay.

952
01:00:18,185 --> 01:00:22,125
Speaker 8:  No, no. Purely vibes based. The, the one that I have right now

953
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:25,605
Speaker 8:  is called Nonstop November, and it's mostly

954
01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:29,365
Speaker 8:  like indeed, you know who Suki Waterhouse is?

955
01:00:29,915 --> 01:00:33,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Lots of Suki Waterhouse, you know, sad,

956
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:37,805
Speaker 8:  fun Autumn vibes. Yeah.

957
01:00:37,995 --> 01:00:41,805
Speaker 8:  Nonstop November. Just, just what I'm looping, basically. Like I am

958
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,045
Speaker 8:  addicted to these songs and I need them in a playlist. And here is of, you

959
01:00:45,045 --> 01:00:48,445
Speaker 8:  know, a hundred songs. They're just like, that one is sort of my playlist

960
01:00:48,555 --> 01:00:52,445
Speaker 8:  vibe and fresh flowers. They're cheap. They make you happy.

961
01:00:53,205 --> 01:00:56,925
Speaker 8:  I have a vase next to my front door and then

962
01:00:57,345 --> 01:01:00,845
Speaker 8:  one on my desk. So I get to flex it and my

963
01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:05,005
Speaker 8:  What's on your desk series? But yeah, they're, they're simple. They make

964
01:01:05,005 --> 01:01:07,565
Speaker 8:  you happy. That's all you need is music and fresh flowers.

965
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:11,165
Speaker 1:  Do you have a favorite kind of flower or is it just whatever, whatever they're

966
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:12,205
Speaker 1:  selling at the bodega.

967
01:01:12,745 --> 01:01:15,365
Speaker 8:  Oh wow. The bodega. The bodega. Okay.

968
01:01:15,545 --> 01:01:18,685
Speaker 1:  You're gonna move to New York. You have to learn the word bodega Kylie. That's

969
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:19,325
Speaker 8:  True. That's

970
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:20,525
Speaker 1:  True. We're just starting this now.

971
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:23,645
Speaker 8:  VERGE casters If. you have a sublet with fresh tulips.

972
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:28,085
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's, it's tulips. I think that they're really pretty. Okay. And then

973
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:29,445
Speaker 8:  they open slowly and yeah.

974
01:01:30,385 --> 01:01:31,185
Speaker 1:  I love this for you.

975
01:01:31,475 --> 01:01:31,905
Speaker 8:  Thank you.

976
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:34,985
Speaker 1:  It's just a cozy fall full of fresh flowers. This sounds so nice.

977
01:01:35,585 --> 01:01:39,425
Speaker 8:  I know. It is. And it's pouring rain here and I have a slight cold and

978
01:01:39,425 --> 01:01:42,945
Speaker 8:  that's okay. And I'll play my cozy games. I'll write my, you know,

979
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:45,025
Speaker 8:  weird AI stories about billionaires. It's a good time.

980
01:01:45,045 --> 01:01:48,865
Speaker 1:  You're like one oversized thing of soup away from being

981
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:50,465
Speaker 1:  like a rom-com character right

982
01:01:50,465 --> 01:01:50,545
Speaker 8:  Now.

983
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:54,185
Speaker 1:  Oh my God. Wow. And that's, that's what we should all aspire to, I think.

984
01:01:54,205 --> 01:01:57,065
Speaker 1:  Wow. Okay. You're like, you're at the beginning of a Christmas movie is what's

985
01:01:57,065 --> 01:01:58,825
Speaker 1:  happening right now. It's gonna be amazing.

986
01:01:59,945 --> 01:02:02,065
Speaker 8:  I would hope that, you know, in the Christmas movies, you don't have the

987
01:02:02,065 --> 01:02:04,625
Speaker 8:  winter cold. They, they leave that out for some reason. This

988
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:07,625
Speaker 1:  Is true. Once you come out of that and then, then everything's better,

989
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:08,545
Speaker 8:  Obviously.

990
01:02:09,135 --> 01:02:11,665
Speaker 1:  Awesome. Kylie, feel better. Thank you. Thank

991
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:11,745
Speaker 8:  You.

992
01:02:12,865 --> 01:02:16,845
Speaker 1:  All right, moving on. Barbara Krasnoff reviews editor. Here we go.

993
01:02:17,335 --> 01:02:18,505
Speaker 1:  Barbara. Hello.

994
01:02:19,185 --> 01:02:19,645
Speaker 9:  Hey there.

995
01:02:20,315 --> 01:02:24,125
Speaker 1:  Okay, we gave you some homework. Let's do your Story of the year first. Let's

996
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,445
Speaker 1:  start there. What was your Story of the year?

997
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:30,005
Speaker 9:  Well, actually it's two or more stories of the year. It's the election

998
01:02:30,285 --> 01:02:34,085
Speaker 9:  coverage that we had. Hmm. I was especially

999
01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:38,045
Speaker 9:  impressed by Addie's, the pragmatist guy to the 2024

1000
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:41,605
Speaker 9:  presidential election. I mean, I read that about five times.

1001
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:45,645
Speaker 9:  It gave more information about what the

1002
01:02:45,645 --> 01:02:49,365
Speaker 9:  candidates had done in the past and what they were saying now about various

1003
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,845
Speaker 9:  important issues. I I just wanted to sort of print it out and mail it to

1004
01:02:52,845 --> 01:02:56,525
Speaker 9:  everybody I knew. And that of course, Neely's

1005
01:02:56,535 --> 01:03:00,125
Speaker 9:  essay vote for Donald Trump is a vote for school shootings and measles. I

1006
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:03,765
Speaker 9:  mean, you, you gotta mention that. I mean, that, that was just amazing.

1007
01:03:04,805 --> 01:03:07,205
Speaker 1:  Probably the best headline we ran this year. I don't know how you topped

1008
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:07,925
Speaker 1:  that as a headline.

1009
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:11,925
Speaker 9:  I, I, I honestly don't. I certainly couldn't and I wouldn't have had, I wouldn't

1010
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:15,765
Speaker 9:  have had the gut suit to put it up E either. So I'm very

1011
01:03:15,765 --> 01:03:19,645
Speaker 9:  glad that our editor in chief did. So those were my favorites for the

1012
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:19,845
Speaker 9:  year.

1013
01:03:20,145 --> 01:03:23,765
Speaker 1:  The, those are good ones. I, I agree with all of those. What was your tech

1014
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:26,965
Speaker 1:  thing of the year? I found this of all three pieces of homework we all had

1015
01:03:26,965 --> 01:03:30,125
Speaker 1:  to do. I found this to be by far the hardest. What was, what was yours?

1016
01:03:30,675 --> 01:03:34,605
Speaker 9:  Well, I bought myself a little steam deck. Hmm. It's, it's

1017
01:03:34,605 --> 01:03:37,925
Speaker 9:  not brand new. Here. I'll show it to you. I forgot it unplugged right now

1018
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:41,885
Speaker 9:  'cause I was playing with some stuff, but, you know, there it is.

1019
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:45,245
Speaker 1:  I love it. The stream deck has, I think everyone at The Verge I think has

1020
01:03:45,245 --> 01:03:48,805
Speaker 1:  had a stream deck at one point or another. I, I think it's very good. Yeah.

1021
01:03:48,865 --> 01:03:50,605
Speaker 9:  And I, I love playing with it.

1022
01:03:51,155 --> 01:03:54,485
Speaker 1:  What are you doing with it? What's, what's on the, what's on the board right

1023
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:54,605
Speaker 1:  now?

1024
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:56,725
Speaker 9:  Well, nothing because it's unplugged, but

1025
01:03:58,145 --> 01:04:00,845
Speaker 1:  Not a great sign for the stream deck. I have to tell you the fact that it's

1026
01:04:00,845 --> 01:04:01,365
Speaker 1:  unplugged

1027
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:05,485
Speaker 9:  Not a great sign. Well that's 'cause I was moving it from computer

1028
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:08,605
Speaker 9:  to computer, but I basically use it for

1029
01:04:09,435 --> 01:04:12,645
Speaker 9:  very quick answers to things,

1030
01:04:13,505 --> 01:04:17,445
Speaker 9:  so that's cool. And just to get places from one to the other. Hmm. My

1031
01:04:17,445 --> 01:04:21,285
Speaker 9:  problem is I do not have a smart home. So I can't use it for

1032
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:24,925
Speaker 9:  the really sexy things that Jen uses it for, for example.

1033
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:28,925
Speaker 9:  Yeah. But also I just like playing with it. I, I

1034
01:04:29,085 --> 01:04:31,405
Speaker 9:  like playing with different things and I'm gonna play with it some more.

1035
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,325
Speaker 1:  What, what fun stuff have you discovered? Even things that haven't stuck?

1036
01:04:34,525 --> 01:04:38,285
Speaker 1:  I feel like I, I'm with you just in the sense that having a bunch of

1037
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:42,045
Speaker 1:  buttons in front of me is just endlessly fun. And I will find a bunch

1038
01:04:42,065 --> 01:04:45,805
Speaker 1:  of wildly unproductive things to do with them just because it's fun to press

1039
01:04:45,805 --> 01:04:46,645
Speaker 1:  buttons. Well,

1040
01:04:46,645 --> 01:04:49,205
Speaker 9:  I've been trying to attach it to my Chromecast.

1041
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:50,885
Speaker 1:  Ooh, that's good.

1042
01:04:51,165 --> 01:04:53,925
Speaker 9:  I haven't done it yet, but that's my next project because

1043
01:04:54,985 --> 01:04:58,725
Speaker 9:  at home, well we have just the one TV and

1044
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:01,805
Speaker 9:  what we tend to do is we run these

1045
01:05:02,735 --> 01:05:06,525
Speaker 9:  constantly, this background stuff on birds in various

1046
01:05:07,005 --> 01:05:10,925
Speaker 9:  interesting places or cute kittens because it gets the,

1047
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:14,405
Speaker 9:  the blood pressure down. And what I wanna do is to be able to just press

1048
01:05:14,445 --> 01:05:18,125
Speaker 9:  a button and have the cute kittens pop up up on the tv. So

1049
01:05:18,225 --> 01:05:19,605
Speaker 9:  that's, that's my next project.

1050
01:05:20,075 --> 01:05:23,285
Speaker 1:  That is an extremely good idea. I have been

1051
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:27,685
Speaker 1:  spending all year trying to figure out how to more quickly

1052
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:32,085
Speaker 1:  play a specific set of YouTube videos. My problem is I have a toddler who

1053
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:36,205
Speaker 1:  between three and 12,000 times a day

1054
01:05:36,555 --> 01:05:40,525
Speaker 1:  just stares at me and demands Moana. And I've like

1055
01:05:40,745 --> 01:05:44,445
Speaker 1:  mapped the shortcut button on the Roku remote to get there.

1056
01:05:44,795 --> 01:05:48,565
Speaker 1:  I've done a bunch of stuff. I've tried to figure out like, you know, all

1057
01:05:48,565 --> 01:05:51,845
Speaker 1:  these macros that will do it. I love the idea of just having a button that

1058
01:05:51,845 --> 01:05:55,365
Speaker 1:  is just like, play the happy video and it's, and then he can do it himself.

1059
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:56,365
Speaker 1:  Just play the video.

1060
01:05:57,345 --> 01:06:01,085
Speaker 9:  And also because we are, we are unfortunately a Google

1061
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:04,965
Speaker 9:  Voice household and sometimes that just does

1062
01:06:05,145 --> 01:06:08,485
Speaker 9:  not work. And I'd much rather just press a button

1063
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:12,885
Speaker 9:  and have Netflix or whatever come up than have to try to

1064
01:06:13,185 --> 01:06:17,165
Speaker 9:  say it or have to do it the really old fashioned way and do it on

1065
01:06:17,165 --> 01:06:19,005
Speaker 9:  the remote. So that's where I am right now.

1066
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:22,405
Speaker 1:  I like that a lot. Can I give you one other tip as a, as a person I know,

1067
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:26,365
Speaker 1:  oh, please. Who has to also use slack all day? Using the stream deck

1068
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:30,245
Speaker 1:  to change my Slack status has been wonderful and also has

1069
01:06:30,245 --> 01:06:34,085
Speaker 1:  made me a better coworker because I now reliably change my Slack status.

1070
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:37,925
Speaker 1:  So just to have a thing that's like, I have one that's like a BRB with the

1071
01:06:37,925 --> 01:06:41,365
Speaker 1:  little hanging BRB sign. Yeah. And I just have a button on it that I can

1072
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:45,165
Speaker 1:  press on the stream deck and it puts me up at BRB for 60 minutes. Oh, that's

1073
01:06:45,165 --> 01:06:45,365
Speaker 9:  Perfect.

1074
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:46,485
Speaker 1:  Game changer. That

1075
01:06:46,505 --> 01:06:50,445
Speaker 9:  Is perfect. Thank you. I will definitely take that into

1076
01:06:50,725 --> 01:06:51,085
Speaker 9:  consideration.

1077
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,525
Speaker 1:  Happy to help. All right. What's your other thing? Non-tech thing.

1078
01:06:53,995 --> 01:06:56,565
Speaker 9:  Totally. Non-tech thing is Googly eyes

1079
01:06:57,985 --> 01:06:58,365
Speaker 9:  see this.

1080
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:00,005
Speaker 1:  That's so good.

1081
01:07:01,145 --> 01:07:04,485
Speaker 9:  And the reason is basically when we had our meeting,

1082
01:07:05,685 --> 01:07:09,525
Speaker 9:  I had been to the office for like a year and so when we had

1083
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:13,165
Speaker 9:  our meeting, I was sitting around at one of the stations and

1084
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:17,045
Speaker 9:  one of our colleagues basically said, I have this bag full of

1085
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:20,765
Speaker 9:  Googly eyes. Does anyone want any? And I said, sure, I'll take a couple.

1086
01:07:20,865 --> 01:07:24,725
Speaker 9:  And I stuck it to the back of my phone and it's

1087
01:07:25,225 --> 01:07:29,045
Speaker 9:  the most relaxing thing that I, anytime

1088
01:07:29,205 --> 01:07:32,805
Speaker 9:  I get like tense or upset or whatever, I just look at these,

1089
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:37,205
Speaker 9:  these really wide sympathetic Googly eyes

1090
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:41,165
Speaker 9:  and I go, oh, things aren't too bad. So that's my totally favorite

1091
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:42,845
Speaker 9:  non tech thing for right now. It does

1092
01:07:42,845 --> 01:07:46,725
Speaker 1:  Make your phone feel much nicer. Like, I feel like I like your phone

1093
01:07:46,755 --> 01:07:48,405
Speaker 1:  more than I like most phones now. Well,

1094
01:07:48,405 --> 01:07:51,845
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Look, I mean, look at this poor, cute little thing. I, I basically,

1095
01:07:52,505 --> 01:07:55,285
Speaker 9:  for those who, who aren't looking, I've got a dark blue

1096
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:59,605
Speaker 9:  backing on my Pixel six

1097
01:07:59,905 --> 01:08:03,685
Speaker 9:  and they're two little lies against the dark blue backing it just, just

1098
01:08:03,845 --> 01:08:07,645
Speaker 9:  looking at you wide, almost like kit and eyes, you know, and

1099
01:08:07,665 --> 01:08:10,445
Speaker 9:  saying, hi, I love you, you are nice.

1100
01:08:10,955 --> 01:08:14,205
Speaker 1:  It's adorable. And they're like almost perfectly aligned, but just slightly.

1101
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:18,165
Speaker 1:  It's great. Great. I'm, I'm a big fan. There's a real Googly eyes thing

1102
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:22,005
Speaker 1:  happening in our newsroom now that I love very much v

1103
01:08:22,005 --> 01:08:25,805
Speaker 1:  song on our team. I know instead of getting the new Mac mini just put Googly

1104
01:08:25,805 --> 01:08:28,725
Speaker 1:  eyes on her old Mac mini to make herself feel better about it. And that seems

1105
01:08:28,725 --> 01:08:29,685
Speaker 1:  to have worked very well for her.

1106
01:08:30,325 --> 01:08:32,205
Speaker 9:  V is the one who gave me these, so there you

1107
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:35,485
Speaker 1:  Go. She's starting a trend here. Googly eyes, all the things. Do you now

1108
01:08:35,485 --> 01:08:38,125
Speaker 1:  look around your house being like, what else can I Googly eyes? I feel like

1109
01:08:38,165 --> 01:08:40,725
Speaker 1:  a, a bag of Googly eyes makes someone very dangerous.

1110
01:08:40,865 --> 01:08:44,485
Speaker 9:  Oh, oh yeah. Well, yeah, absolutely. In fact, you know, I'm, I'm looking

1111
01:08:44,485 --> 01:08:48,285
Speaker 9:  on Amazon or someplace I'm gonna get a bag of those so, so that I can not

1112
01:08:48,285 --> 01:08:51,805
Speaker 9:  only use them on things here, but So I can carry them with me. So if I meet

1113
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:55,565
Speaker 9:  somebody who's like, not in a good way, I'll just hand them a couple of Googly

1114
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:56,845
Speaker 9:  eyes. That's

1115
01:08:56,905 --> 01:09:00,845
Speaker 1:  So good. Just just hand them to Googly eyes and walk away with no explanation.

1116
01:09:00,965 --> 01:09:03,245
Speaker 1:  I feel like people would instantly understand what you meant. I love it.

1117
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:04,845
Speaker 9:  I think so. That's

1118
01:09:04,845 --> 01:09:07,765
Speaker 1:  Really good. All right, Barbara, thank you very much. Alright,

1119
01:09:07,765 --> 01:09:08,205
Speaker 9:  Very good.

1120
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:12,085
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take one more break and then we have a couple more people

1121
01:09:12,085 --> 01:09:15,605
Speaker 1:  to talk to about all the favorite and biggest stuff from the air. We'll be

1122
01:09:15,605 --> 01:09:15,925
Speaker 1:  right back.

1123
01:12:55,775 --> 01:12:59,715
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back up next. Alex Heath, deputy editor at The Verge

1124
01:12:59,715 --> 01:13:03,635
Speaker 1:  and the author of the very good Command Line newsletter. Alex Heath.

1125
01:13:03,685 --> 01:13:04,035
Speaker 1:  Hello.

1126
01:13:04,655 --> 01:13:04,875
Speaker 12:  Hi.

1127
01:13:05,655 --> 01:13:09,515
Speaker 1:  You have an AI background and you just alerted us to the

1128
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:12,995
Speaker 1:  Riverside Mac app and this is the greatest day of my life. So I. Just all

1129
01:13:12,995 --> 01:13:16,395
Speaker 1:  of my answers before have changed. My thing of the year is that Riverside,

1130
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:19,595
Speaker 1:  which we use to record this podcast now has a desktop app and everything

1131
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:20,195
Speaker 1:  will be wonderful.

1132
01:13:20,325 --> 01:13:21,435
Speaker 12:  Happy Thanksgiving, David.

1133
01:13:21,905 --> 01:13:25,675
Speaker 1:  Seriously, this is what we do here. All right, so we gave you some homework.

1134
01:13:26,385 --> 01:13:27,515
Speaker 1:  What was your Story of the year?

1135
01:13:28,235 --> 01:13:31,445
Speaker 12:  It's a theme and I'm calling it The AI rat race,

1136
01:13:31,895 --> 01:13:35,685
Speaker 12:  which is just this idea that all of the big tech companies

1137
01:13:35,785 --> 01:13:39,205
Speaker 12:  and OpenAI anthropic have just been

1138
01:13:39,745 --> 01:13:43,205
Speaker 12:  trying to one up each other all year long with all of these

1139
01:13:43,445 --> 01:13:46,765
Speaker 12:  announcements to a kind of petty, hilarious degree.

1140
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:51,285
Speaker 12:  And I expect that to only continue next year, but this year

1141
01:13:51,285 --> 01:13:55,115
Speaker 12:  really felt like it ratcheted up quite a bit. And apologies

1142
01:13:55,175 --> 01:13:58,435
Speaker 12:  if others have said something along these lines, but that's, I I just, I

1143
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:02,335
Speaker 12:  don't think you can like seriously say there was a bigger

1144
01:14:02,335 --> 01:14:03,695
Speaker 12:  story in tech this year than that.

1145
01:14:04,535 --> 01:14:07,775
Speaker 1:  I agree. And I, I actually think I, I like that way of thinking about it

1146
01:14:07,775 --> 01:14:10,975
Speaker 1:  too, that what we've had is this like incredibly high stakes,

1147
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:15,485
Speaker 1:  expensive game of like teeny tiny one-upsmanship all year. Yeah.

1148
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:19,645
Speaker 1:  Like everybody's just doing 5% better than everybody else

1149
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:23,645
Speaker 1:  every three weeks all year and spending ungodly amounts of

1150
01:14:23,645 --> 01:14:23,765
Speaker 1:  money.

1151
01:14:23,995 --> 01:14:27,165
Speaker 12:  Yeah. And it's, and it all blurs together and you reflect back on the year

1152
01:14:27,165 --> 01:14:30,605
Speaker 12:  and it's like, I guess Chad CPT is a

1153
01:14:31,065 --> 01:14:34,965
Speaker 12:  little better to use, Claude is better. Like all of these

1154
01:14:34,965 --> 01:14:38,885
Speaker 12:  things feel better. But I haven't felt

1155
01:14:39,025 --> 01:14:42,525
Speaker 12:  the kind of aha, early iPhone moment

1156
01:14:42,755 --> 01:14:46,685
Speaker 12:  this year. It's just felt very kind of constantly iterative.

1157
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:50,885
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We, we like skipped straight to the iPhone 14 era of

1158
01:14:51,165 --> 01:14:54,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah. ai. So you, you said you think it's gonna

1159
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:58,405
Speaker 1:  continue next year? Yeah. Do you, you think so like there, there's another

1160
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:01,965
Speaker 1:  case to be made that like we're, we're hitting sort of a slowdown with these

1161
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:05,525
Speaker 1:  models. Maybe there's like a bubble that's gonna burst. Maybe everybody's

1162
01:15:05,525 --> 01:15:09,315
Speaker 1:  going to finally like take a deep breath and start to ask real

1163
01:15:09,515 --> 01:15:11,915
Speaker 1:  questions about ai. You don't think any of that's coming?

1164
01:15:12,535 --> 01:15:15,755
Speaker 12:  Oh, David, it's like you were reading my newsletter before it even comes

1165
01:15:15,755 --> 01:15:19,635
Speaker 12:  out. It will have come out by this time. There you go. No,

1166
01:15:19,635 --> 01:15:23,195
Speaker 12:  that is actually an interesting point. There is this concept in AI called

1167
01:15:23,295 --> 01:15:27,195
Speaker 12:  the Scaling Wall that seems to be hitting everyone in the

1168
01:15:27,195 --> 01:15:30,915
Speaker 12:  face, which is just this idea that everyone thought that

1169
01:15:30,975 --> 01:15:34,355
Speaker 12:  new models would get dramatically smarter the more

1170
01:15:34,945 --> 01:15:38,915
Speaker 12:  compute and money you threw into training them. And that's turning

1171
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:42,955
Speaker 12:  out now to not be the case. So I and others have reported that Google and

1172
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,875
Speaker 12:  others are seeing diminishing returns from training their

1173
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:50,595
Speaker 12:  next kind of frontier models. And the

1174
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:54,275
Speaker 12:  consensus seems to be that that's okay because

1175
01:15:54,705 --> 01:15:58,675
Speaker 12:  there's a lot of work that needs to be done with just building good experiences

1176
01:15:58,675 --> 01:16:02,115
Speaker 12:  around the models that exist today. Yeah. And agents

1177
01:16:02,815 --> 01:16:06,315
Speaker 12:  are a thing I think we're gonna be hearing a lot more about next year, which

1178
01:16:06,315 --> 01:16:10,115
Speaker 12:  are basically LLMs that do things on your behalf that can chain together

1179
01:16:10,555 --> 01:16:14,315
Speaker 12:  multiple actions, take over a desktop interface

1180
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:17,875
Speaker 12:  or a phone or something like that. And you can achieve

1181
01:16:17,975 --> 01:16:21,275
Speaker 12:  agents with the models that exist today. It's all

1182
01:16:21,775 --> 01:16:25,675
Speaker 12:  the magic is done in post training and what happens after you've trained

1183
01:16:25,695 --> 01:16:29,275
Speaker 12:  one of these large models. And the scaling wall seems to be

1184
01:16:29,555 --> 01:16:33,235
Speaker 12:  applying to, to training new models, but not necessarily

1185
01:16:33,345 --> 01:16:35,035
Speaker 12:  improving the ones that exist today.

1186
01:16:35,535 --> 01:16:39,355
Speaker 1:  That's fair. Do you think the leaderboard has changed this year? Like as

1187
01:16:39,355 --> 01:16:42,915
Speaker 1:  we look at who is winning this race, it, it's been

1188
01:16:43,555 --> 01:16:47,475
Speaker 1:  a wild game of kind of leapfrog, but looking back, do you

1189
01:16:47,475 --> 01:16:50,595
Speaker 1:  feel like we're in a different spot than we were 12 months ago?

1190
01:16:51,595 --> 01:16:55,355
Speaker 12:  I think it's hard to say with a straight face that anyone other than

1191
01:16:55,355 --> 01:16:59,305
Speaker 12:  open AI is the winner right now. I would say

1192
01:16:59,405 --> 01:17:03,265
Speaker 12:  OpenAI, especially with its oh one reasoning model release is

1193
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:07,225
Speaker 12:  still kind of ahead of where the puck is going. Everyone

1194
01:17:07,225 --> 01:17:11,005
Speaker 12:  is gonna be doing, I say reasoning with air quotes, reasoning models

1195
01:17:12,115 --> 01:17:15,765
Speaker 12:  next year, I will say it does feel like Meta has significantly

1196
01:17:15,775 --> 01:17:19,725
Speaker 12:  moved up the leaderboard this year with, with Llama and

1197
01:17:19,945 --> 01:17:23,685
Speaker 12:  the excitement around it and the adoption of it. Gemini seems to be doing

1198
01:17:23,715 --> 01:17:27,645
Speaker 12:  okay. I think Google's happy with it, but wishes

1199
01:17:27,755 --> 01:17:31,565
Speaker 12:  that more businesses were using it, anthropic is killing it

1200
01:17:31,565 --> 01:17:35,045
Speaker 12:  on the business side on, you know, just being accessible through every cloud

1201
01:17:35,325 --> 01:17:39,245
Speaker 12:  provider. And OpenAI is the big consumer bet. You know, that that

1202
01:17:39,245 --> 01:17:42,885
Speaker 12:  chat GPT is gonna be the next Google or the next Facebook. It kind of has

1203
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:46,605
Speaker 12:  to be to justify open AI's insane valuation.

1204
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,765
Speaker 12:  Yeah. So it's a lot of the same players. They all kind of

1205
01:17:50,765 --> 01:17:54,245
Speaker 12:  constantly move up and down. That's why I call it a rat race. But going

1206
01:17:54,275 --> 01:17:58,085
Speaker 12:  into the new year, going into December, and I caveat all this

1207
01:17:58,085 --> 01:18:01,805
Speaker 12:  with saying a year ago my Thanksgiving was ruined because Sam

1208
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:03,965
Speaker 12:  Elman got suddenly fired from Open AI

1209
01:18:04,165 --> 01:18:07,125
Speaker 1:  Fair. I guess in that sense, an awful lot has changed in 12 months.

1210
01:18:07,505 --> 01:18:11,405
Speaker 12:  And I, and Neli was at, I think Disneyland and we were just constantly

1211
01:18:11,405 --> 01:18:15,365
Speaker 12:  calling each other while he was in between rides, trying to confirm reporting

1212
01:18:15,365 --> 01:18:19,245
Speaker 12:  that we had all week long on The Verge. So, you know, who knows what could

1213
01:18:19,245 --> 01:18:22,845
Speaker 12:  happen. The AI industry moves very fast, but as of right now, feels like

1214
01:18:22,905 --> 01:18:26,405
Speaker 12:  OpenAI still has a little bit of an edge, but that edge is rapidly

1215
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:28,365
Speaker 12:  dulling, which is interesting.

1216
01:18:28,515 --> 01:18:32,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah, yeah. I agree. All right, next thing on the list, your favorite tech

1217
01:18:32,485 --> 01:18:33,085
Speaker 1:  thing of the year.

1218
01:18:34,635 --> 01:18:38,245
Speaker 12:  This is not, it's not Riverside for Mac though. I am also very happy about

1219
01:18:38,245 --> 01:18:41,805
Speaker 12:  this. It's another app that, you know,

1220
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:45,805
Speaker 12:  I just think a lot of AI apps aren't very good. But there's this one I've

1221
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:49,085
Speaker 12:  found that I use on my Mac all day long called Granola.

1222
01:18:49,705 --> 01:18:53,685
Speaker 12:  And it's a Granola meeting note taking app. It

1223
01:18:53,685 --> 01:18:57,605
Speaker 12:  gets around wiretapping laws by not actually recording your calls, but what

1224
01:18:57,605 --> 01:19:01,565
Speaker 12:  it does is it runs a hyper miniaturized LLM

1225
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:05,485
Speaker 12:  live while you're on a Google meet, a Zoom, whatever, FaceTime

1226
01:19:05,515 --> 01:19:09,485
Speaker 12:  call and transcribes it in real time so it doesn't

1227
01:19:09,485 --> 01:19:12,925
Speaker 12:  save the audio file or let you listen to it after, but it gives you a transcript.

1228
01:19:12,945 --> 01:19:16,405
Speaker 12:  And then it has been kind of post trained to really focus on

1229
01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:20,805
Speaker 12:  summarizing, summarizing in an actionable way how

1230
01:19:20,825 --> 01:19:24,725
Speaker 12:  you would want to see notes from a meeting. Almost like

1231
01:19:24,725 --> 01:19:28,085
Speaker 12:  you've got a personal assistant that's like in the meeting with you. I've

1232
01:19:28,085 --> 01:19:30,645
Speaker 12:  been using it for like, our editor calls for interviews

1233
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:36,085
Speaker 12:  and it's got, you know, a pretty nice interface and it's fairly

1234
01:19:36,155 --> 01:19:40,125
Speaker 12:  well integrated into, into Mac os. So that's

1235
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:44,085
Speaker 12:  my pick. It's like a simple, actually useful application of AI

1236
01:19:44,545 --> 01:19:46,525
Speaker 12:  in a work kind of setting. Does

1237
01:19:46,525 --> 01:19:49,845
Speaker 1:  The action items thing actually work? I feel like yeah, the, we've gotten

1238
01:19:49,845 --> 01:19:52,405
Speaker 1:  to the point where the transcription stuff on a lot of these services is

1239
01:19:52,405 --> 01:19:56,005
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Is very fast and very good. But I'm, I'm so skeptical of the thing

1240
01:19:56,045 --> 01:19:58,245
Speaker 1:  where it's like, we're gonna tell you the three most important things that

1241
01:19:58,245 --> 01:20:00,725
Speaker 1:  happen in this meeting. Pretty is does Granola actually do pretty well? Good.

1242
01:20:00,725 --> 01:20:00,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

1243
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:04,565
Speaker 12:  It's pretty good. And it recognizes voices and it knows how to make distinctions

1244
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:09,005
Speaker 12:  and, you know, it gives me like next steps after a meeting based

1245
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:12,685
Speaker 12:  on how we talked about it. You know, like for example, like really long

1246
01:20:12,755 --> 01:20:15,885
Speaker 12:  ones where a lot is said, it's actually pretty helpful at breaking all of

1247
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:18,805
Speaker 12:  that down. You know, it's not perfect, but it's definitely the best I've

1248
01:20:18,805 --> 01:20:22,605
Speaker 12:  used in this context. And then it's got a bunch of like, integrations with

1249
01:20:22,615 --> 01:20:26,485
Speaker 12:  other apps. Like you can drop a summary straight into Slack or

1250
01:20:26,485 --> 01:20:29,845
Speaker 12:  your email app or something like that. So they're, they're, they're continuing

1251
01:20:29,845 --> 01:20:32,805
Speaker 12:  to build on it. And I'm, I'm pretty bullish on it as a product, honestly,

1252
01:20:32,805 --> 01:20:36,605
Speaker 12:  just because it's, it's a very good niche application

1253
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:37,445
Speaker 12:  of, of ai.

1254
01:20:37,795 --> 01:20:41,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That's, that's, that's pretty cool actually. What about non-tech things?

1255
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:45,605
Speaker 12:  I went to Japan Yeah. This summer

1256
01:20:46,455 --> 01:20:50,205
Speaker 12:  slash fall, and I'm just gonna pick alcohol, you know, that kind of

1257
01:20:50,235 --> 01:20:53,085
Speaker 12:  sums up my, my year anyway.

1258
01:20:53,485 --> 01:20:56,125
Speaker 1:  I thought you were gonna just pick Japan, but I like just picking alcohol

1259
01:20:56,555 --> 01:20:58,085
Speaker 1:  just as much. That's pretty good. Yeah.

1260
01:20:58,195 --> 01:21:02,005
Speaker 12:  Yeah. I mean, Japan is awesome, but I, I fell in love with Shochu in Japan,

1261
01:21:02,015 --> 01:21:06,005
Speaker 12:  which is like, it's not sake, it's not soju,

1262
01:21:06,075 --> 01:21:08,645
Speaker 12:  it's like a higher a BV almost like whiskey

1263
01:21:10,415 --> 01:21:14,365
Speaker 12:  clear, very easy to drink, earthy, smoky

1264
01:21:15,525 --> 01:21:19,325
Speaker 12:  Japanese spirit. And I want to find more of it in the States.

1265
01:21:19,425 --> 01:21:23,165
Speaker 12:  But yeah, anytime I see Shochu now, I, I ordered immediately.

1266
01:21:23,465 --> 01:21:24,925
Speaker 1:  How easy is it to find in the States?

1267
01:21:25,665 --> 01:21:29,485
Speaker 12:  You know, I thought it would be easier. It's, it's, I'm in LA and it's,

1268
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:33,165
Speaker 12:  so, it's a little bit easier here. We, we just, we have a lot of Japanese

1269
01:21:33,165 --> 01:21:36,285
Speaker 12:  people in really good restaurants that are Japanese in la but

1270
01:21:37,315 --> 01:21:40,885
Speaker 12:  it's harder to find when I travel, but Yeah.

1271
01:21:41,305 --> 01:21:43,645
Speaker 12:  Showed you it's, it's good. All right. And

1272
01:21:43,645 --> 01:21:47,405
Speaker 1:  Strong. I'm gonna have to try this. I, yeah, very briefly, a couple of years

1273
01:21:47,405 --> 01:21:50,765
Speaker 1:  ago during the pandemic was like, I'm gonna get into Japanese whiskey, and

1274
01:21:50,765 --> 01:21:54,685
Speaker 1:  I, it's so good, man. It, it was, it's so good. But it was, it's such

1275
01:21:54,885 --> 01:21:58,765
Speaker 1:  a different world Yeah. Of booze that I just, I eventually was

1276
01:21:58,765 --> 01:22:01,165
Speaker 1:  like, I'm gonna go back to learning about like Kentucky Bourbon, because

1277
01:22:01,165 --> 01:22:03,045
Speaker 1:  that's, that's as much as I can handle right now.

1278
01:22:03,045 --> 01:22:05,405
Speaker 12:  Well, I'm from Kentucky. I can, we can have a whole convo about

1279
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:08,645
Speaker 1:  Bourbon at some point. We'll have to do that sometime. I like it. All right,

1280
01:22:08,645 --> 01:22:10,365
Speaker 1:  Alex, thank you as always. Appreciate it.

1281
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:11,045
Speaker 12:  Thanks man.

1282
01:22:12,035 --> 01:22:15,815
Speaker 1:  All right. Last but certainly not least, Ash, Parrish, The

1283
01:22:15,935 --> 01:22:19,635
Speaker 1:  Verge video games reporter. Here we go. Ash. Hello.

1284
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:23,635
Speaker 1:  Hi. It's been a minute. We haven't done this in a while. You need to come

1285
01:22:23,635 --> 01:22:24,395
Speaker 1:  on the show more often.

1286
01:22:24,835 --> 01:22:27,355
Speaker 13:  I think the last time I was on, I was talking about tears of the Kingdom

1287
01:22:28,205 --> 01:22:31,995
Speaker 1:  Maybe. I think that's right. We also talked about GTA six like a hundred

1288
01:22:31,995 --> 01:22:33,315
Speaker 1:  years ago. We did.

1289
01:22:33,555 --> 01:22:34,555
Speaker 13:  I don't remember that one I

1290
01:22:34,555 --> 01:22:38,035
Speaker 1:  Like very much because there was like that weird leak that happened forever

1291
01:22:38,295 --> 01:22:38,515
Speaker 1:  ago.

1292
01:22:38,825 --> 01:22:41,635
Speaker 13:  Okay. I do remember that. But I don't remember being on The Vergecast about

1293
01:22:41,635 --> 01:22:41,715
Speaker 13:  it.

1294
01:22:42,095 --> 01:22:44,835
Speaker 1:  You were, it was great. We had a terrific time. I believe I enjoyed every

1295
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:48,595
Speaker 1:  second of it. So we gave you some homework. What was the

1296
01:22:48,595 --> 01:22:49,435
Speaker 1:  Story of the year for you?

1297
01:22:50,295 --> 01:22:53,715
Speaker 13:  So the Story of the year for me, I'm gonna do something a little bit different

1298
01:22:53,715 --> 01:22:57,515
Speaker 13:  and I'm gonna choose a story from my beat, which is video games, which

1299
01:22:57,525 --> 01:23:01,475
Speaker 13:  isn't necessarily like the biggest story for The Verge overall because No,

1300
01:23:01,555 --> 01:23:04,595
Speaker 13:  I love it. It's like a tech website and there are a lot more important things

1301
01:23:04,595 --> 01:23:07,450
Speaker 13:  happening in the tech world than what's going on in the world of video games.

1302
01:23:07,905 --> 01:23:11,805
Speaker 13:  But I have like two buckets for biggest Story of the

1303
01:23:11,805 --> 01:23:15,085
Speaker 13:  year on my beat. I've got like the actual factual,

1304
01:23:15,675 --> 01:23:18,485
Speaker 13:  this is objectively the biggest story and then the biggest story, like to

1305
01:23:18,485 --> 01:23:22,445
Speaker 13:  me personally, okay, so the biggest story Objectual, actual factual, is

1306
01:23:22,505 --> 01:23:26,485
Speaker 13:  the switch to N GT six. They are these like almost

1307
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:30,445
Speaker 13:  oppressive figures looming in the distance that

1308
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:34,485
Speaker 13:  is like slowly coming towards the video game industry. And

1309
01:23:34,485 --> 01:23:37,845
Speaker 13:  when it hits, it's gonna be this like massive

1310
01:23:38,895 --> 01:23:42,765
Speaker 13:  event. And both of those things are supposed to happen

1311
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:46,725
Speaker 13:  next year. Like Nintendo is not, you know, they're being

1312
01:23:46,945 --> 01:23:50,685
Speaker 13:  coy about exactly when, but they're saying we are definitely,

1313
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:54,605
Speaker 13:  definitely going to announce the switch successor sometime before

1314
01:23:54,705 --> 01:23:58,365
Speaker 13:  the end of Q1 2025. And that's, and it's just been like a

1315
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:02,485
Speaker 13:  constant, like, not deluge, but like Nintendo

1316
01:24:02,775 --> 01:24:06,525
Speaker 13:  feels like with everything that they're doing now, it's like we're clearing

1317
01:24:06,785 --> 01:24:10,485
Speaker 13:  the books. We are getting everything off of our plate

1318
01:24:10,995 --> 01:24:14,925
Speaker 13:  just clearing the runway for when this massive story hits. And so that's

1319
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:18,245
Speaker 13:  on the hardware side and on the software side you have GTA six,

1320
01:24:18,655 --> 01:24:22,165
Speaker 13:  which is probably going to be the biggest video game

1321
01:24:22,195 --> 01:24:26,045
Speaker 13:  release in our lifetimes. I

1322
01:24:26,415 --> 01:24:30,365
Speaker 13:  don't know how else to explain it. It's

1323
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:34,125
Speaker 13:  just this GTS six is just this massive, crazy, insanely

1324
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:38,325
Speaker 13:  popular thing that has been hyped

1325
01:24:38,325 --> 01:24:42,165
Speaker 13:  up possibly too much. Hopefully Rockstar

1326
01:24:42,345 --> 01:24:46,285
Speaker 13:  can deliver on not their promises, but at

1327
01:24:46,285 --> 01:24:50,205
Speaker 13:  least the idea or that people have in their head for what

1328
01:24:50,205 --> 01:24:51,885
Speaker 13:  this video game is supposed to be. Well,

1329
01:24:51,885 --> 01:24:54,925
Speaker 1:  So let me, let me actually pause on that because Yeah, this is a, a thing

1330
01:24:54,925 --> 01:24:58,605
Speaker 1:  that I have been wondering about a lot recently, which is

1331
01:24:59,325 --> 01:25:02,765
Speaker 1:  a, it's sort of wild that the two biggest things in video games right now

1332
01:25:02,785 --> 01:25:05,365
Speaker 1:  are things that don't exist yet. And I think you're absolutely right that

1333
01:25:05,365 --> 01:25:09,285
Speaker 1:  they have like, been the stories of the year all year despite not

1334
01:25:09,725 --> 01:25:12,445
Speaker 1:  existing. And there's like a lot of existential questions you could ask about

1335
01:25:12,445 --> 01:25:16,365
Speaker 1:  games as a result. But I do wonder after all of

1336
01:25:16,365 --> 01:25:20,285
Speaker 1:  this, is it even possible for these two things to live

1337
01:25:20,285 --> 01:25:22,645
Speaker 1:  up to the hype? Like, yes, you think

1338
01:25:22,965 --> 01:25:25,565
Speaker 13:  I do? Okay, good. Nintendo is Nintendo.

1339
01:25:26,745 --> 01:25:29,685
Speaker 13:  Yes, they've had some stinkers like with the OU and, and things like that

1340
01:25:29,685 --> 01:25:33,465
Speaker 13:  in the past. But I think no matter what

1341
01:25:33,585 --> 01:25:37,465
Speaker 13:  it is, no matter what it does, it will be big because it's

1342
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:41,185
Speaker 13:  Nintendo. Like Nintendo had that alarm o thing out. Like it's,

1343
01:25:41,275 --> 01:25:43,585
Speaker 13:  which was just like little, you know, chintzy

1344
01:25:45,035 --> 01:25:47,905
Speaker 13:  alarm clock that was just like nothing. And it's sold out within seconds.

1345
01:25:48,175 --> 01:25:51,705
Speaker 13:  Okay. And that's true. And it's just an alarm clock that plays like Nintendo

1346
01:25:51,705 --> 01:25:55,425
Speaker 13:  beeps and boobs. People want it because of who

1347
01:25:55,425 --> 01:25:58,625
Speaker 13:  makes it. And that's exactly the case for both of those things.

1348
01:25:59,295 --> 01:26:03,285
Speaker 13:  It's a rockstar game. It's a Nintendo system, no matter what the

1349
01:26:03,285 --> 01:26:07,245
Speaker 13:  kind of quality it is, it's still gonna sell like gangbusters may not perform

1350
01:26:07,465 --> 01:26:10,925
Speaker 13:  the way that the bookkeepers want them to perform if they are lower quality.

1351
01:26:11,265 --> 01:26:14,965
Speaker 13:  But it's still gonna be like the massive, massive million

1352
01:26:14,965 --> 01:26:17,125
Speaker 13:  dollar, million copy thing selling thing.

1353
01:26:17,475 --> 01:26:21,245
Speaker 1:  Okay. I just like, I don't know, I feel like we, we've been

1354
01:26:21,245 --> 01:26:25,125
Speaker 1:  burned especially on the, on the game side by

1355
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:29,045
Speaker 1:  these huge things that just turned out to be even

1356
01:26:30,365 --> 01:26:33,885
Speaker 1:  slightly worse than we expected. And it, it becomes this whole giant catastrophe.

1357
01:26:33,885 --> 01:26:37,685
Speaker 1:  And it's like, if, if GT six does what, like cyberpunk 2077 did,

1358
01:26:38,185 --> 01:26:42,005
Speaker 1:  the world will collapse in on itself. Yeah. And I'm,

1359
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:45,925
Speaker 1:  I think maybe I'm just hardening myself against that possibility as somebody

1360
01:26:45,925 --> 01:26:47,165
Speaker 1:  who's very excited about this game.

1361
01:26:48,205 --> 01:26:51,565
Speaker 13:  I understand that I, you know, we haven't

1362
01:26:52,235 --> 01:26:56,205
Speaker 13:  seen very much of GTA six outside of a trailer and leaked

1363
01:26:56,485 --> 01:27:00,445
Speaker 13:  materials Rockstar hasn't really told us all that much

1364
01:27:00,445 --> 01:27:04,325
Speaker 13:  about what the game is. We haven't really seen official gameplay

1365
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:08,365
Speaker 13:  yet. So we, we actually have no idea what to expect from

1366
01:27:08,365 --> 01:27:12,285
Speaker 13:  them. And I think that's probably smart on there end to kind

1367
01:27:12,285 --> 01:27:15,805
Speaker 13:  of like manage expectations. Like, you can't get mad at us for something

1368
01:27:16,135 --> 01:27:19,085
Speaker 13:  about this because we never actually told you what this thing was. We just

1369
01:27:19,085 --> 01:27:21,925
Speaker 13:  said it was GTA six, we gave you the trailer, we put, put it out there.

1370
01:27:22,185 --> 01:27:25,765
Speaker 13:  We didn't tell you to expect this, this, this, this or this. We just, you

1371
01:27:25,765 --> 01:27:29,685
Speaker 13:  know, did our thing and put it out there. But, you know, I don't know

1372
01:27:29,825 --> 01:27:33,085
Speaker 13:  it, you're right in that there have been these big huge releases that have

1373
01:27:33,085 --> 01:27:36,885
Speaker 13:  been kind of underwhelming. But I don't know,

1374
01:27:37,315 --> 01:27:40,925
Speaker 13:  like I said, doesn't matter what kind of quality it is because it's rockstar,

1375
01:27:40,925 --> 01:27:44,765
Speaker 13:  because it says GTA six on the box, it's gonna sell 10 billion copies.

1376
01:27:45,155 --> 01:27:48,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah, fair enough. Alright. I I I believe you. Okay, so those are the big

1377
01:27:48,165 --> 01:27:52,005
Speaker 1:  stories. What's the, what's the one nearest and dearest to your heart? So

1378
01:27:52,005 --> 01:27:55,805
Speaker 13:  The thing that is important to me that I think is, like

1379
01:27:55,805 --> 01:27:59,725
Speaker 13:  my personal big story for the year is the story of the video

1380
01:27:59,725 --> 01:28:03,605
Speaker 13:  game industry layoffs and the rise of Gamergate 2.0, as it

1381
01:28:03,605 --> 01:28:07,205
Speaker 13:  were. We are in the second year

1382
01:28:07,545 --> 01:28:11,285
Speaker 13:  of this like trend of studios being shut down

1383
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:15,525
Speaker 13:  of massive, massive, massive amounts of people being laid off.

1384
01:28:15,935 --> 01:28:19,885
Speaker 13:  We're really gonna start feeling it. I believe in 2025, there was

1385
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:23,605
Speaker 13:  Embracer group put out, went there with their earning statement

1386
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:27,525
Speaker 13:  maybe a couple weeks ago stating that, you know, we've got this

1387
01:28:27,775 --> 01:28:31,685
Speaker 13:  dried up release pipeline without really qualifying that

1388
01:28:31,845 --> 01:28:35,805
Speaker 13:  with the fact that we closed like six different studios and laid off

1389
01:28:35,835 --> 01:28:38,925
Speaker 13:  over a thousand of our employees. And like If, you don't have people working

1390
01:28:38,985 --> 01:28:42,405
Speaker 13:  for you anymore because you close everything down and fire everybody. Yeah,

1391
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:45,845
Speaker 13:  of course. Your, your, your production pipeline is gonna suffer and you're

1392
01:28:45,845 --> 01:28:48,845
Speaker 13:  not gonna have games out that are gonna make the money that you need to

1393
01:28:48,845 --> 01:28:52,685
Speaker 13:  appease your shareholders. Like, we're starting to see the, the, the

1394
01:28:52,685 --> 01:28:56,485
Speaker 13:  knock on effects of this, like this layoff last two years,

1395
01:28:56,515 --> 01:29:00,285
Speaker 13:  like really starting to hurt and pinch these big corporations because now

1396
01:29:00,285 --> 01:29:03,725
Speaker 13:  they have nothing to show for it. They laid off everybody, they closed these

1397
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:06,925
Speaker 13:  studios and now they have no product anymore because there's nobody around

1398
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:10,725
Speaker 13:  to make it. Right. On the other end of that, you've got this

1399
01:29:10,785 --> 01:29:14,765
Speaker 13:  rising culture war thing within video games where

1400
01:29:14,765 --> 01:29:18,645
Speaker 13:  people are trying to attribute the problems of

1401
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:22,605
Speaker 13:  the video game industry with the layoffs and the closures and all, and

1402
01:29:22,605 --> 01:29:26,565
Speaker 13:  like, you know, games failing with the idea that it's minorities and people

1403
01:29:26,565 --> 01:29:30,485
Speaker 13:  of color's fault, which is absolutely patently absurd. Yeah. Because, you

1404
01:29:30,485 --> 01:29:31,805
Speaker 1:  Know, we're just doing this again somehow.

1405
01:29:32,155 --> 01:29:35,365
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Pretty much. We're, we're doing this again. Ugh. And these people,

1406
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:39,805
Speaker 13:  you know, they have nothing interesting to say. They're not really paying

1407
01:29:39,805 --> 01:29:43,445
Speaker 13:  attention to facts. They're just really upset that the culture

1408
01:29:43,585 --> 01:29:47,525
Speaker 13:  of storytelling in video games, both like on the screen and in the

1409
01:29:47,525 --> 01:29:50,805
Speaker 13:  development room, is shifting away from trying to

1410
01:29:51,145 --> 01:29:55,005
Speaker 13:  appeal to, I'm going to use extremely heavy quotes

1411
01:29:55,005 --> 01:29:58,765
Speaker 13:  because it's not true. Traditional gamers, which have always been straight

1412
01:29:59,105 --> 01:30:02,605
Speaker 13:  cis heterosexual white men, and into this more diverse

1413
01:30:02,685 --> 01:30:06,645
Speaker 13:  tapestry where we're making stories that appeal to people of color,

1414
01:30:07,805 --> 01:30:11,685
Speaker 13:  L-G-B-T-Q people, disabled folks. And we're

1415
01:30:11,805 --> 01:30:15,405
Speaker 13:  starting to see development rooms also reflect that diversity as well.

1416
01:30:15,865 --> 01:30:19,205
Speaker 13:  And, you know, people can't handle change like that and they get really

1417
01:30:19,345 --> 01:30:22,725
Speaker 13:  mad and they start getting mad at people for the wrong reasons. And

1418
01:30:23,435 --> 01:30:27,285
Speaker 13:  it's important to me that these stories get covered so we

1419
01:30:27,285 --> 01:30:30,965
Speaker 13:  can understand why they're happening and why it is not true.

1420
01:30:31,465 --> 01:30:35,325
Speaker 13:  We can counteract their narratives that like, oh, this game failed because

1421
01:30:35,905 --> 01:30:39,725
Speaker 13:  it was woke, you know, which is ridiculous. And then this woke game that

1422
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:43,605
Speaker 13:  was really, really good succeeded because actually it wasn't woke that,

1423
01:30:43,885 --> 01:30:46,805
Speaker 13:  which is very funny. Another like the other side of that argument,

1424
01:30:47,015 --> 01:30:50,605
Speaker 1:  Right? The democrat secretly Republican. Exactly. Yeah.

1425
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:54,565
Speaker 1:  Somehow it just like, do you ever look at this industry and you're like,

1426
01:30:54,565 --> 01:30:57,805
Speaker 1:  oh, we're, it just is all the same. Like how many times in history

1427
01:30:58,345 --> 01:31:02,085
Speaker 1:  is it like Grand Theft Auto Nintendo is doing a thing and

1428
01:31:02,085 --> 01:31:05,725
Speaker 1:  everybody is losing their minds and mad and we're kind of doing

1429
01:31:05,725 --> 01:31:09,045
Speaker 1:  Gamergate. Like, it just, this is just the cycle. We're just doing it all

1430
01:31:09,045 --> 01:31:09,405
Speaker 1:  over again.

1431
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:13,925
Speaker 13:  I think the, the problem with that is specific

1432
01:31:13,925 --> 01:31:17,605
Speaker 13:  to the video game industry is that we do not have the kind of

1433
01:31:18,835 --> 01:31:22,645
Speaker 13:  like institutional memory that other industries have

1434
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:26,445
Speaker 13:  because of the way that the industry is currently working in terms of journalism

1435
01:31:26,545 --> 01:31:30,485
Speaker 13:  and in terms of like, you know, having a dedicated group

1436
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:34,285
Speaker 13:  of people that are covering these kinds of issues, but we fire them all

1437
01:31:34,285 --> 01:31:38,245
Speaker 13:  the next day. Like, it's really, really hard to keep a job in

1438
01:31:38,245 --> 01:31:42,165
Speaker 13:  video games journalism right now. And that, and because of that,

1439
01:31:42,165 --> 01:31:45,685
Speaker 13:  because it is so hard to, you know, maintain a steady job

1440
01:31:46,385 --> 01:31:49,565
Speaker 13:  and because the, these kinds of reportings doesn't necessarily move the

1441
01:31:49,565 --> 01:31:52,765
Speaker 13:  needle like top 10 ways you can get the most out of your switch or, you

1442
01:31:52,765 --> 01:31:55,725
Speaker 13:  know, that kind of shit. Right. We don't have the institutional memory say

1443
01:31:55,785 --> 01:31:59,685
Speaker 13:  the way, I don't know, movies do or any other kind of

1444
01:31:59,685 --> 01:32:03,605
Speaker 13:  like, cultural thing because everybody's gone.

1445
01:32:03,605 --> 01:32:06,405
Speaker 13:  They have to move on and go somewhere else so they can make money and pay

1446
01:32:06,405 --> 01:32:08,245
Speaker 13:  their bills and not, you know, be destitute.

1447
01:32:08,515 --> 01:32:12,205
Speaker 1:  Totally. All right, well these are good things and again,

1448
01:32:12,305 --> 01:32:14,685
Speaker 1:  we, we need, you need to come on the show more often. This is all, you know,

1449
01:32:14,685 --> 01:32:14,765
Speaker 1:  where

1450
01:32:14,765 --> 01:32:17,965
Speaker 13:  I, you know, where I metaphorically live my desk

1451
01:32:18,105 --> 01:32:20,605
Speaker 1:  Is why I do. Now we were talking about this before. I do now. This is great

1452
01:32:20,605 --> 01:32:23,965
Speaker 1:  news. All right, let's, let's keep going through this. So the next thing

1453
01:32:24,065 --> 01:32:27,485
Speaker 1:  was your favorite New thing of the year. And for most people, we've been

1454
01:32:27,485 --> 01:32:31,445
Speaker 1:  making them say tech, but If, you wanna do like, you know, games or

1455
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:34,165
Speaker 1:  tech enough. So If, you wanna do games, we can do games, tech, whatever you

1456
01:32:34,165 --> 01:32:34,285
Speaker 1:  want.

1457
01:32:34,705 --> 01:32:38,525
Speaker 13:  The tech thing, it's not necessarily this year, but it came out

1458
01:32:38,525 --> 01:32:42,125
Speaker 13:  late enough last year where I think it counts kind of like that window where

1459
01:32:42,235 --> 01:32:45,965
Speaker 13:  this movie came out in 2024, but it's not eligible for the Oscars

1460
01:32:46,015 --> 01:32:50,005
Speaker 13:  until the next year. It's that it's The, Playstation Portal. Oh

1461
01:32:50,005 --> 01:32:53,325
Speaker 1:  My god. Yeah. You're The Playstation Portal fan. The one that's out there.

1462
01:32:53,925 --> 01:32:57,085
Speaker 13:  I am the one PlayStation portal fan. Now this is so exciting because of

1463
01:32:57,085 --> 01:33:00,885
Speaker 13:  the recent news that PlayStation portal will now let you stream games

1464
01:33:00,915 --> 01:33:04,245
Speaker 13:  from the cloud. Mm. Before that, like, I already

1465
01:33:04,355 --> 01:33:08,125
Speaker 13:  appreciated the device because it allowed me to play my

1466
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:11,405
Speaker 13:  PlayStation games on the couch and still be in the same room with my husband

1467
01:33:11,425 --> 01:33:15,165
Speaker 13:  and we can like watch TV or do whatever. And I appreciate that. Like, I,

1468
01:33:15,165 --> 01:33:18,805
Speaker 13:  like, I don't like being sequestered or taking away like the living room

1469
01:33:18,805 --> 01:33:21,605
Speaker 13:  television from him. So like, you know, because I have to do this thing

1470
01:33:21,605 --> 01:33:25,325
Speaker 13:  because I am literally working, you know, he can't watch, you know, whatever

1471
01:33:25,575 --> 01:33:28,285
Speaker 13:  silly thing that he wants to watch. Right. And so that kind of, that makes

1472
01:33:28,285 --> 01:33:32,045
Speaker 13:  it easier for me. But the big thing is that that kind of like breaks

1473
01:33:32,045 --> 01:33:35,805
Speaker 13:  open this device and now makes it kind of like a must own for like anybody

1474
01:33:35,825 --> 01:33:39,725
Speaker 13:  who has a PlayStation five is the idea that now you can stream games

1475
01:33:39,955 --> 01:33:43,565
Speaker 13:  without the need of being tethered to a PlayStation five

1476
01:33:43,715 --> 01:33:47,325
Speaker 13:  because it's gonna let you stream cloud games, If, you've got a PlayStation

1477
01:33:47,715 --> 01:33:51,165
Speaker 13:  premium plus membership. I don't remember exactly how that works,

1478
01:33:51,545 --> 01:33:55,445
Speaker 13:  but yeah. That, that makes it like, okay, now this is on the

1479
01:33:55,445 --> 01:33:59,325
Speaker 13:  level of the steam deck. Maybe not the same technical heavy lifting specs

1480
01:33:59,325 --> 01:34:03,165
Speaker 13:  as a steam deck may have, but definitely the utility that I think is gonna

1481
01:34:03,165 --> 01:34:05,685
Speaker 13:  make it like, okay, this is, this is something that I need to, that I need

1482
01:34:05,685 --> 01:34:06,205
Speaker 13:  to own now.

1483
01:34:06,945 --> 01:34:10,685
Speaker 1:  That's really good. That's fair. And I, I have to say I'm also personally

1484
01:34:10,685 --> 01:34:14,405
Speaker 1:  very excited about this because the portal is such a like, lovely little

1485
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:17,965
Speaker 1:  thing. Like they made a nice object and they just

1486
01:34:18,245 --> 01:34:21,165
Speaker 1:  hamstrung it in such a stupid way. Yeah. So it's like, it's nice to see it

1487
01:34:21,605 --> 01:34:23,925
Speaker 1:  actually start to do the thing. It should have been doing all along. Correct.

1488
01:34:23,955 --> 01:34:27,565
Speaker 13:  Correct. Now if we can make it such that, you know, it doesn't drop the

1489
01:34:27,565 --> 01:34:31,125
Speaker 13:  connection because I can't wire my PlayStation where it is. Mm.

1490
01:34:31,315 --> 01:34:35,205
Speaker 13:  Like where I have it, like, so we can like beef up the way that it,

1491
01:34:35,265 --> 01:34:39,045
Speaker 13:  you know, streams from the PlayStation and So I don't have to like

1492
01:34:39,365 --> 01:34:43,165
Speaker 13:  reconnect every, you know, couple minutes, then we'll we'll be like cooking

1493
01:34:43,165 --> 01:34:46,365
Speaker 13:  with gas, but until then, you know what, I can live with this.

1494
01:34:46,665 --> 01:34:49,725
Speaker 1:  All right. I'll buy it. I love it. All right. And then last thing, your,

1495
01:34:49,875 --> 01:34:51,405
Speaker 1:  your non-tech thing of the year.

1496
01:34:51,965 --> 01:34:55,605
Speaker 13:  I think you might already know what the answer to that question is. It's

1497
01:34:55,665 --> 01:34:59,485
Speaker 13:  my new Corgi puppy boo. His,

1498
01:34:59,785 --> 01:35:03,245
Speaker 13:  his real name is Syphilis because I named him after my favorite

1499
01:35:03,255 --> 01:35:07,245
Speaker 13:  historical horse, Alexander the greats horse syphilis. But we call him

1500
01:35:07,305 --> 01:35:08,045
Speaker 13:  Boo for short.

1501
01:35:08,305 --> 01:35:11,005
Speaker 1:  Do you call him Phyliss when you're mad at him? Like, is that when you're

1502
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:13,285
Speaker 1:  like, you know, sternly talking to him? You

1503
01:35:13,285 --> 01:35:16,765
Speaker 13:  Know, I haven't yet, but I think that might be a thing that happens.

1504
01:35:16,795 --> 01:35:19,085
Speaker 1:  Okay. Because I feel like that's a, like if I heard someone yelling that

1505
01:35:19,085 --> 01:35:21,805
Speaker 1:  at the dog park, like who, that's serious stuff. Then

1506
01:35:21,805 --> 01:35:24,605
Speaker 13:  When you hear someone yelling at, at the dog park, you're like, that is

1507
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:26,245
Speaker 13:  the biggest nerd that I've ever

1508
01:35:26,835 --> 01:35:28,765
Speaker 1:  Seen. Also, my mice also that also that,

1509
01:35:29,545 --> 01:35:32,445
Speaker 13:  But yeah, he's a, he's a three month old Corgi who

1510
01:35:33,215 --> 01:35:37,045
Speaker 13:  loves chewing on feet and he's trying to chew on mine now because he's

1511
01:35:37,045 --> 01:35:40,845
Speaker 13:  teething and he is absolutely shit monster. But I love him to death. So

1512
01:35:40,845 --> 01:35:42,805
Speaker 13:  that is my favorite non-tech thing of the year.

1513
01:35:43,285 --> 01:35:47,245
Speaker 1:  I love it. So three months. He's just a terror. He's just,

1514
01:35:47,385 --> 01:35:49,045
Speaker 1:  he is just a destroyer. He's,

1515
01:35:49,045 --> 01:35:50,765
Speaker 13:  He is a, he's a toe chewing terror. Okay. That's for sure.

1516
01:35:51,105 --> 01:35:54,205
Speaker 1:  But then he like sleeps on top of your head and you're like, all right, we're

1517
01:35:54,205 --> 01:35:54,885
Speaker 1:  cool. Everything's fine.

1518
01:35:54,885 --> 01:35:58,605
Speaker 13:  Pretty much. Yeah. I love this. Then yeah, then he makes his little noise

1519
01:35:58,675 --> 01:36:02,565
Speaker 13:  when he's like yawning or something like that, and it's so, so

1520
01:36:02,565 --> 01:36:03,045
Speaker 13:  dang cute.

1521
01:36:03,665 --> 01:36:07,525
Speaker 1:  He is very cute. There are a bunch of dog dedicated Slack

1522
01:36:07,525 --> 01:36:11,125
Speaker 1:  channels at The, Verge and Vox Media in general. And like,

1523
01:36:11,955 --> 01:36:15,925
Speaker 1:  it's not so much that you've like won those channels with Boo,

1524
01:36:15,985 --> 01:36:19,925
Speaker 1:  but like, you, you, you did it. It's like pretty hard to compete with with

1525
01:36:20,015 --> 01:36:21,125
Speaker 1:  Boo's situation right now.

1526
01:36:21,555 --> 01:36:22,925
Speaker 13:  Yeah. That, you know, that's the goal.

1527
01:36:24,235 --> 01:36:27,965
Speaker 1:  He's doing good work. All right, Ash, thank you as always. It was great to
